[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Hot damn why I gotta be so
Hot damn a nigga got street flow
My man I'm sick in the cerebral
Sixteen bars worth more than a kilo
You know my steelo, chrome desert eagle
When I drop by say hi to my amigo
Give 'em two shots and I don't mean a free throw
This young nigga living by the G code
Haters talk that shit but I don't give a fuck
Say you better than me then where the money what
Funny what a motherfucker gotta say in an interview
But I bet that punk ain't running up
C.O.B. nigga that's the clique
You don't like that suck a massive dick
Watch the plasma drip all on your Reebok Classics
When I'm letting loose with that Jurassic clip
Now I'm looking for another ass to kick
Mark ass rapper I crack your bitch
Have that ho showing ass and tits
Playing my song saying that's the shit
I don't know why you comfortable fucking with me though
That's when my pistol get to singing like it's Ne-yo
Walking through different parts of my city I'm a hero
Let me tell you again it's C.O.B. ho
Crooked I do that shit the west way
Weed from Jamaicans, coke from eses
My Phillipino homey gave me an SK
Want to hear some gangsta shit then press play
These niggas couldn't fuck with me on their best day
Especially niggas who boney as an x-ray
That ain't no diss homey that's a segue
Buy the album Boss of the West (ayy)
Off probation how you like me now
Pistol whipping niggas in Lakewood, wow
Prosecute a man cause he couldn't prove how
That snitch lucky that I didn't go blow
He wasn't worth my bullets and I knew it
He gang banged on me homey that's when he blew it
Beat him in his grill 'til his face turned bluish
Clean up in aisle nine, this nigga's leaking fluids
Enough of that motherfucking crime scene
Crooked I's all about a rhyme scheme
Bling bling shining like high beams
White tee and TK ice creams
They ask me when I'ma stop using the N word
Same time Houston stop sipping the sizzurp
And if I do it'll be my own decision
Not because of Don Imus or Michael Richards
Sharp to know you can't stop the operation
Don't like rap, good it ain't your occupation
When I spit it's for the hip hop nation
So quit eavesdropping on a hood conversation
