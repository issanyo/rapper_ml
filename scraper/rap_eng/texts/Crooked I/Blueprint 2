[Hook: Crooked I]
C-R double O and K
That B-O-S-S is on his way
Soon as I drop my album I'ma own LA
All you bitch made niggas better so behave
(x2)

[Verse 1: Crooked I]

This is what it do, how you do and fuck you
Razor in my mouth, switchblade in my shoe
Soon as you niggas act bitch made is my cue
To part you like french braids and dip with my crew
C.O.B. underworld menaces
System want to put us young niggas in the mix like Jena Six
America been prejudice since its genesis
Guilty until proven innocent that's what niggas is
I try to understand they fury
I put myself in they shoes facing an all white jury
And they attitude to me was sour as a Midori
Injustice ain't blind, bitch vision ain't even blurry
Out by the tree I wanted to sit in the grass
That Louisiana sunshine was kicking my ass
Now these students are making racist comments I'm getting harassed
Damn thought we left that bullshit in the past
Just to piss 'em off I bought a platinum noose
I ain't fighting no racist I'm letting that magnum loose
I'll leave your prejudice ass leaking that plasma juice
And then I fuck a snow bunny just to mass produce
I'm in that Aston Coupe
There go that rap phenomenon
I treat Crenshaw Blvd. like the Autobahn
Engine so hungry that it's eating the street
Nigga the speakers so violent that they beating the beat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
I'm on my way to the Treacherous office (Why?)
I got a meeting with the Circle of Bosses (C.O.B.)
We gotta take over the game whatever the cost is
So all you record executives better be cautious
Gangstas don't dance thought I told you boy
Going to war, that's when I do the Soulja Boy
Jesus piece I iced out Jehova's boy
It's over boy, you finished and I'm overjoyed
I'm the illegitimate son of Khalid Muhammed
Militant tongue similar to Talib and Common
Sick as they come spitting like I live to vomit
Hollow tip ebonics nigga my shit's atomic
I saddle up like them wild west cowboys
400 horses nigga 20 inch alloys
Video vixens always popping that wild noise
For them I got nothing but hard dick and Altoids
Speaking of Altoids I'm out to make a mint
We got to have bigger dreams than trying to pay the rent
You scared to dig in your pocket cause you afraid of lint
So when you struggling wondering where your paper went
Remember Crooked I you can meet the person
Who grew up so fucked up it had preachers cursing
We used to walk 'til our feet was hurting
Use sheets for curtains
Now I'm balling off beats I'm mercing
My side hustle got me and my team emerging
Tell the feds suck a dick, hands clean as surgeons
Jigga did it first, I had to squeeze a verse in
To get them Long Beach fucking streets a version

[Hook]
