Extra extra! Read all about it!
Extra extra! Read all about it!
Sucker stepped up and got murdered

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]

The architect before the hour begins
I bring storm to your valley of death
Without fear with my pistol up to your head
Your life is an illusion, a mirage, and a perversion
Of God, orgies and morbid sorcery shall arise
From the Judas Priest, the altar of madness
Join us at the darkest Sabbath
Pick hollowtips, harvest Magnums
My crops is Glocks, farmer tan’s tropical
My arms are black metal with threaded barrels and chopper screws
Electric skull up in the wall of voodoo
Felt like clips based all upon call of ktulu
A real dude AKA Bill Duke, I kill crews
Big goons homie shoot up the casket, we fill tombs
Make shit move, twist truth, never will lose
Pull out the big Uz, let the clips cruise
Every word I speak causes explosions
I torture soldiers, hearts frozen
AR-15s and roses, stiffening decomposing
You got murdered

[Chorus x 2]

[Verse 2: Crooked I]

Yo thirty-nine ounce pistol rosewood handle
Five heads thrown to the barrels spitting new ammo
If it’s over my money that’ll make a dude scramble
I’m dough, cheese, and bread, I’m the fucking food channel
Putting two through your flannel, man I murderlize you
My Tech ex your clan like the grand verbalizer
You piss in the wind, my pistol will circumcise you
While I’m talking more shit than people selling fertilizer
For you to be on a higher level than Crooked I
You’d have to hire a pilot to write your rhymes in the sky
Then tell the pilot to crash the plane, burn, and fry
Now even he’s like me cause I’m fly till I die
C-O-B yeah who got a problem with me?
Your eyes are skinny as the body of Whitney
To survive when I’m popping semis
I’m dropping any, God forgive me
Now Long Beach is Gotham City

[Chorus x 2]
