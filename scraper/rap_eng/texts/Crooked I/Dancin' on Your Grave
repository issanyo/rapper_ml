SSUT SSUT (x4) (COB!)

[Hook: Brevi]
We ain’t afraid of gettin' dirty 'round here
Layin the sand middle finger in the air (Yeahh)
Anticipate when the rain gon' come
Dancin' on your grave, covered in the ssuutt
Covered in the ssutt [3x]
Dancin' on your grave, covered in the mud

[Verse: Crooked I]
Put a deuce up, when Crooked cruise up-
I pull a coupe up, bullet proofed up
You bullies tool up?
Fully full what?
I’ve been on California corners-
Longer than the bottom of a hookers shoe-
I'll fuck a dude up!
I’m so proper with the chrome chopper..
And if my hand gun is horny, don’t think I won’t cock her!
Cock-a-roaches better phone coppers
If I get shot I call my own doctors
A stone cold COBster..
You niggas playing with this G shit?
It’s different levels of this street shit
Automatic heat spit, maggots picked the wrong one to beef with
And Perez Hilton won’t be the only faggot in deep shit!
The ratchet hit ya like a Packer tackling Steve Smith
Or leave the clapper, and get it Crack-a-lackin with these fists!
Peep this, got chronic cloud for your weed spliff
My street team pushing more loud than Steve Riff!
Biggie died when they laid son to rest
It's like the Industry blamed us labels running from the west!
I decided to invest street money and it brought success
I was thinkin, "Fuck Execs, 'til them fuckers cut the checks!"
So, what does that shit mean?
It means I risked doing 16 to bring you these 16’s..
I grew up with, niggas who threw up shit
Gang bangers, hustlers, all I used to fuck with..
Charcoal Murcielago, parked oh at the Wilshire Margot
Arco, hoes gas me up, way faster than the car go
Bitches yell, "Mr. Wells Fargo, he's rich as hell.."
Let the cigar blow, I don’t tip 'em well
Crooked? He's different he tipped the Richter scale..
I’m an earthquake, I’m the best ever in the first place
Unless June 16 is your birthday!
(R.I.P. PAC!)

(Chorus)
