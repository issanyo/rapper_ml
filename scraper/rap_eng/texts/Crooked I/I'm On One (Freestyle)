[Intro: Crooked I]

[Verse One: Crooked I]
Fuck it I'm on one
Slaughterhouse we on 2, point oh shit
Point your shit to the garbage now bitch, y'all ain't it
Everybody talking about that and this
Crooked did a song with Canibus
Am I supposed to be beefing with him?
Let me tell you all what the answer is:
No, no, no. Nowadays do I listen to half his shit?
No, no, no, and I bet the internet say that's a diss
Gotta keep it real man I will not flip flop
Grind every day I'mma go hard get guap
Cops wanna track me, but fans won’t be happy
Until I kill a nigga on World Star Hip Hop
But, but, but your boy ain't going out like no wankster
Cause intelligence is the brand new gangster
The number one spot is in danger
Let me tell you why you rappers ain't fucking with the Slaughterhouse gang
You got a little flow that's cool with me
Got a little ice, little jewel-er-y
But none of you can fool with the crew to me
Name a nigga rapping better, maybe 2 or 3... and that's it
All the above, you call it circle love
Homie I merk a thug
Wait a minute this purple bud
This pink drink, that's a lot of bottles
Ace of Spade is celebrated
Cause we made it
I'mma drank it
‘Til my cadence
Sound sedated
Cause I'm faded
You can hate it
Ask me if I give a fuck
Homeboy I came from nothing, this time I'mma live it up
I'm so real, I'm a needle in a haystack
When I drive by tell your people it’s the payback
Yeah I got paper, still doing drive-bys
What? This time Desert Eagle in a Maybach
Cause we don't play that
We don't play that shit
Nigga I'm on one
