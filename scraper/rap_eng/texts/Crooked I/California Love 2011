[Hook: K. Young]
I don't feel like turning my speakers down
Got a bad bitch sitting right next to me
Two friends in the back pop ecstasy, ohh
That sound like sex to me
Now I'm fiending on her body
I don't even know her name
She whispered in my ear
Said baby call me Mary Jane
Smart than a motherfucker
Where'd she get her brains from?

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Loaded as hell, I'm on this coconut Ciroc leaning
A 100 % alcohol in my pops semen
Living the life of a COB star
Hands behind my back, cuffed up in a squad car, a dropped charge
They try to show me another meaning of hot bars
Spent a whole summer in a cell cause the block's ours
Ain't nothing changed since Pac was with Dre
Coppers today wish they could lock us away in Guantanamo Bay
Call us domestic terrorists, get us out of the way
With no trial or delay, but no your honour, you ain't getting me
Cause even if I break the murder code
I bet I keep my hands cleaner than a Germaphobe
I'm trying to rule the world, I'm trying to turn the globe
With the palm of my hands while I'm getting Kurtis Blow
Life is too short so I keep a loaded pistol
Born to mack, two stepping to blow the whistle
Ass stripes to whistle now I'm so official
C.O.B. is my religion, Cash Over Brizzles
And I put that on a good book
I'm preaching to the choir
Let me get a Ssuutt Ssuutt

[Hook: K. Young]
I don't feel like turning my speakers down
Got a bad bitch sitting right next to me
Two friends in the back pop ecstasy, ohh
That sound like sex to me
Now I'm fiending on her body
I don't even know her name
She whispered in my ear
Said baby call me Mary Jane
Smart than a motherfucker
Where'd she get her brains from?

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
They call me Mr. Chase-Money, then I taste honey
Women ain't dummies so bitches wait for me
Gotta make cake man get a damn job
That'll make her hit you with shake weight handjob
You're smoking Prop 19 playing Call Of Duty
She work a 10 hour shift, she better call your beauty
Maybe it's your own actions that brought her to me
Your broad's a cutie, it was a wrap when I saw the booty
She Wade Phillip'd your ass, now man listen
You wouldn't have got fired if you had some ambition
Lazy dudes ass, what the heck does he mean?
Stay on the grind like the teeth of an ecstasy fiend
Regular thing, the deck could be mean
You expect to be King when every Jack's sexing your Queen
Play your cards right, I gotta play mine right
I got a hard life and I don't need a hard future
Light my cigar like I'm Winston Churchill and record all night
So many punchlines in my 16's, they'll bar fight
Go ahead hate Crooked, you ain't got to love me
I teach you niggas to rap if you teach me how to dougie
When I'm gone I bet you they paint a mural of me
Them verses be cracking them mirrors nigga my lyrics ugly
Uglier than me pulling up on your grey ?
With my Beretta popping your fake leather
Talking more reckless than sixty ?
Cause talking reckless like sixty Mayweather
When you shoot it just make it way better
Yeah, I might be married to this hellish business
But the hood is my jealous mistress nigga
