[Intro]
Yeah man, the west ain't the same without you (it ain't the same)
Its crazy out here
Write this letter to my nigga 2Pac real quick
We straight bosses
Yeah, C.O.B. nigga

[Verse]
Yeah, Dear Makaveli: what it dont do?
Know its your boss day nigga, that's why I wrote you
All Eyez On Me, yeah I'm taking over the coast too
Your songs still theme music for the things that I go through
Me Against the World so all I could do is breath fire
Death Around The Corner, I grab my ruger and squeeze tighter
For my Ambitionz Az an east sida, Rida
Were inspired by you so now I'mma reach higher
Probably shed So Many Tears before I retire
When Thugs Cry just increase our desire
To get what we require till the choir sings for me
Even when I earn my wings, I'mma be flyer
Picture Me Rolling in a navy blue Mercedes
Time has passed, Brenda's baby got a baby
I tell her keep her head up
Tell me that she fed up
Say rappers are soft now
What are these niggas scared of?
And your music used to warm her like a bear hug
I tell her I'm putting my grizzly down like a bear rug
Don't worry I ride or die
Nigga lalalalalalalala
I'm repping Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z Never Ignorant in Getting Goals Accomplished
And I'm tossing bitches up man, I'm fucking hoes unconscious
Since you been gone the whole coast is on some nonsense
Not enough unity, holding up the progress
Everybody got killers on the payroll
Should be killing the industry and making pesos
And sipping Thug Passion by the case lows
Pac watch how I make the coast change clothes
Like Chuck Taylors but I ain't in 'em
The new gangsta due to products sneaks and high in denim
Why the fuck should I follow trends when I invent 'em
The Louie V, Huey P, roll by in linen (fly nigga)
I tell 'em like you say, "I Ain't Mad at Cha"
I tell 'em if I was mad at cha, I'd point a mag at cha
All I need is this life of sin
Is a Mack 10 and a black pen
So I could write something to inspire the black men
Cops wanna shoot because they got black skin like you did back then
Perhaps then
I could reach out to our brothers from another mother of other colors and grab them
I'm on a misson down here to reach kids
Kids listen to me down here I tell em to dream big
Not a role model though, I'm what a G is
My last day free could beef with shooting 3 pigs [?]
I'm rebel minded like Geronimo Pratt
I carry on in your tradition
I let your mama know that
When I was at her house with the Outlawz
I'm out spoken but I'm not a rebel without cause
I'm not a monster without claws
I'm a beast, razor sharp teeth
I eat beats nigga swallow and sounds raw
Naw, they ain't fucking with me Makaveli
I'm after my bread and cheese even if I have to jack a deli
I'm a lunatic, fuck it I should rap with Nelly
I'm in the belly of a spider of black [?]
Trying inspire a new nations of young thugs
Illmatic, number seven, nigga one love(one love, one love)

[Outro]
One love my nigga
Boss in peace, Thug in peace
Makeveli
West coast stand the fuck up!
Yeah
I forgot to say this:
C.O.B!
