(VERSE 1) Crooked I
Let me buy you a drink
We got something in common
I see the pain your eyes
And I got my mind on my problems
I'm probably high as you think
And I'm about to sink to the bottom
She said, "I bet you're a fighter
I could tell a rider when I spot em, so tell me what's on your mind,"
Told her, "where do I start?"
Said, "I don't even know you,"
Than I started spillin my heart
Somebody gimme a spark
I'm feeling empty and dark
Said, "I just made a mistake
And it's about to rip me apart
Man, I cheated on my baby and I broke up my cribs
Somebody told what I did
She looked up and woke up my kids
Left a note on the mirror,"
"You'll never know where we live
And if you ever go to court
Nigga you know what it is"
Yea, pushed drugs for a living
"You know how that custody works
Before they give you our children
They'll put you in custody first,"
That's the hustlers curse
I'm getting fucked in reverse
I know that women is hurt
I wonder what's in her purse
How she feedin my kids
Every second she gone
Got me checkin my phone
Should have left them heffers alone
Now my best friend is gone
And I just needed to think
She said, "I feel you for real,"
As we proceeded to drink
Drown our pain in our drinks man

(Hook)
And Ima buy you a drink
Go ahead and drown your sorrows
Let tomorrow take care of tomorrow
Let me buy you a drink
We got something in common
See the pain in your eyes
Leave my mind on my problems
Are you shy as I think?
Are we gonna get to the bottom
Of what's disturbin your soul
The next round, I got em

(VERSE 2) Crooked I
"Tell me what's on your mind
" She said, "inside I'm dyin,"
Said she needed some space
I could tell she was cryin
Tear tracks on her face
"Baby boy I ain't lyin
Had to cruise in my ride
Cause my dude on the side
Was protectin me best
Was respectin me best
Did a precnancy test
Was it pregnancy? yes
"How can I tell my fiance?
I'm scared of him now,"
She said, "my character's foul
I'm not bearin his child
And I'm steadily stressed
He think it's his and he love it
He's pulin out books
Readin stories to my stomach
Wish I wasn't creepin on my man but I done it
He wasn't makin me feel wanted
To keep it one hundred
He used to bring me flowers
Sing me songs in the shower
Before I got pregnant we used to argue every hour
Now our house is a love nest
So I gotta confess
I don't want my future decided by a blood test"
Hey bartender..

(Hook)
And Ima buy you a drink
Go ahead and drown your sorrows
Let tomorrow take care of tomorrow
Let me buy you a drink
We got something in common
See the pain in your eyes
Leave my mind on my problems
Are you shy as I think?
Are we gonna get to the bottom
Of what's disturbin your soul
The next round, I got em
