[Verse 1: Crooked I]
I've been underground for years, it made me a monster
Fuck one artist, I'll ghostwrite for your whole roster
Whether they backpackers, finger snappers or mobsters
I'll give 'em sound advice, make 'em sound nice
Number 1, you got to be slick with the tongue
Like lesbians and lawyers when you spit with the drums
How you gonna be sick with the spit if you dumb
Sharp wit is just as important as wind in your lungs
Number 2, come up with different rhyme schemes and rhythms
I'm 'posed to rhyme with rhythm in this line but see I'm
Changing up the pattern but a rhyme I still give 'em
Like that one in this bar, you follow me so far
Number 3, don't give all your raps away for free
Unless it's a promo or unless you're me
No 401Ks and no pension
I know platinum rappers who can't afford to pay attention
Now did I mention number 4?
I know you heard this one before
Get your cash right before your ass go to war
Cause beefing on wax could turn into them gats clapping
Better have a good answer when the captain asked you what happened
Number 5, don't take this hobby light, copyright
Don't be sloppy because if you tight somebody probably bite
I've been bitten in the past by artists you probably like
But they didn't rock it right, bite me now we gotta fight
Number 6, if the beat sound pathetic, forget it
You won't move the crowd unless you telekinetic
Number 7, business and your bitch don't mix
Baby mama managing you ain't the shit since a twist
She see you taking flicks with them big titty chicks
Then she fix you, put a dent in your chips, sink your ship
Number 8, if you wear a lot of jewels, keep your tools
The chain-snatching fools, they ain't playing by the rules
Number 9, don't put yourself in the position
Cause hip hop cops listen to everything you're spitting
Write a song about yesterday's shit, man you tripping
Rap about real niggas' pitching, you dry snitching
Number 10, it's something known as a contract
Without a lawyer that could penetrate your ass crack
Have you on the bus, yeah you and your gold plaque
Record companies pimping every ho on the whole track
Follow these rules, you could become that nigga
Make history like Biggie and make a wax figure
Or lyrically be compared to hottest rap spitters
Perhaps get an endorsement deal and stack chippers
Bag strippers two at a time like Jack Tripper
Keep your clothes fly like pants that don't lack zippers
I don't know, maybe be that wack nigga
Either way it go, I'll be back nigga
