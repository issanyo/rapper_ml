[Intro: Crooked I]
I rep my city (x7)

[Hook: B.o.B]
I take my city everywhere that I go
So when you see me you then you already know
It’s on my hat, you can tell by the clothes
It’s in my talk, so It’s in my flow
I take my city everywhere that I go!
(x2)

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
I’m from the L-O-N-G-B-E-A-C-H
C-I-T-Y See I, got a paper chase
City by the sea, it’s the 562
That’s why every coupe I hop into, is aqua blue
And I thought you knew, rock with me and I’ll rock with you
This for my (city, city)
I rep my (city, city)
We 50 deep in the club, ‘cause I brought my (city) wit’ me
Throwing them things in a octagon
Louis Vuitton and Vacheron, In Babylon
I’m flippin’ that dough like Pappa John’s, ‘cause I’m the don
So throw some cheese up
Snoopy told you “G’s up.”
Dominic feels, like he’s vomiting pills, throwing E’s up
All my east sider riders throw them E’s up
This LBC What? (huh)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
I’m from the E-A-S-T-S-I-D-E, ride with me
East sider long beach
R-T-C and I-C-G
O-M-G and Y-M-C
Owin’ me I’m COB
Ima take my clique to the T-O-P on G-O-D with B.o.B
Tell by the hat, you could tell by the tat, you could tell how I act, you could tell how I rap that I represent the L-B-C
M-A-P we back on the map
M-A-P mean Money And Power
Uh-huh we back on the map
Can’t be poor son, no Nordstrom, but its racks on racks
SAT put me to the test, no tutor, and glutted cause the future gone show you who the best
This is how I view success
Givin’ you my music, yes
Stepped on stage in Budapest
Made em all salute the west!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
In the Chi-town, I’m keeping it G from the get go
Windy city killers, man they shootin’ when the wind blow
From Oklahoma to New York, I rep my kinfolk
Thought I was in the six-four, nope. I’m in that Enzo!
When I’m in Houston, that purple stuff is in my purple cup
When I’m in Miami, I’m in South Beach with my circle, uhh
When I’m in Atlanta, my fans be grabbing them cameras
Then I’m in out in Detriot with my G, Royce. And them D boys
In every single hood, I’m so hood that I think I’m good
South Central, Hawthorne, Gardena, Compton, Watson, Englewood
Places that I’ve been to
Look at my clothes when I’m mobbin’ through
Laker purple, dodger blue

[Hook]
