[Verse 1]
This is how it happens, somebody yell your name
You turn around and look, you see a barrel flame
You fall against the wall while the hammer nail your frame
Try to get up then you stumble, you sitting there in pain
Thought you was a thug, all it got you was a slug
Crowd goes wild cause they shot you in the club
Killer comes closer, pop you in the mug
Gravity and the Grim Reaper both drop you in your blood
Wilding on Instagram showing you pack heat
Tripping on Twitter, they split you 'til ya black meat
People love a role player, so you act street
Til you in your homie car dying in the back seat
Living on the edge, now them killers on your head
Soon as you get it twisted they put a million on your dreads
ER is too far now you a corpse in the car
Before you left you heard death
And this is what he said

[Hook]
You only die once my nigga, you only die once
You only die once my nigga, you only die once
The motto is YODO

[Verse 2]
Now you popping rubber bands talking bout you got it all
Flexing for the strippers, one is sending out a call
Some niggas slide up on you, quietly pull it out and draw
Walk you into the bathroom, surround you by the stall
One watch the door, other going in your pocket
One snatching your jewels, ain't shit you can do to stop it
Thinking bout swinging on the nigga, nigga stop it
You robbed by some pros, that stripper ho gon' get a profit
Your ego feel pathetic, telling you not to dead it
Expression on your face, them other niggas read it
You walking to your car, they knew where you was headed
They parked you in the parking lot before you can even set it
I seen it all unfold from a corner dimly lit
With a Worldstar bunny bouncing on a nigga dick
See I got my Ruger, couple extended clips
And when I passed security, I hit 'em with some chips

[Hook]
