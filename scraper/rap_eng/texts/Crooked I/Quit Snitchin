[Intro]
Whoo Y'all know we had to flip this shit right
We to ghetto to let this one sneak past us
Fuck that Ey Vegas, let's tell 'em what we say
Evrytime we see a stool pigeon rat


Don't snitch, don't be a bitch
West Coast let's get rich
Flood the industry with gangsta hits
Count some cash, stack some chips
Don't snitch, don't be a bitch
East Coast let's get rich
Flood the industry with gangsta hits
Smack some ass and grab some tits
Don't snitch, don't be a bitch
West Coast let's get rich
Flood the industry with gangsta hits
Count some cash, stack some chips
Don't snitch, don't be a bitch
East Coast let's get rich
Flood the industry with gangsta hits
Smack some ass and grab some tits

[Verse 1:]
What's it all about?
You dudes can't come out the house
Made to many enemies, you runnin' ya mouth
Now you on lock down, sittin' on the couch
Talkin' too cops you need really to cut it out man
Picture Crooked I lovin' a snake, you get robbed for dough
You get shot fo' sho' you know
That ain't gangsta you son of a bitch
Givin' cops the info they not suppose to know
And they own every block from coast to coast
Tellin' on who ever cock and grows the most
Send a, nigga, up the, river, if a snitch is around
You better lock and close ya doors
See I'mma rep my city for ever, yeah
Roll whips on twenties or better
Pointin' many machine guns, semi or Beretta
And my enemies sweater like gimme the cheddar, yeah
Crooked live illegal as hell
Send a couple kites to my people in jail
Think about this when you readin' your mail
These niggas be eager to tell

[Hook]
See I been hopin' and wishin'
All you rappers Quit Snitchin'
Always talkin' to the police
Tryna send my homeboyz to prison
That ain't good where I'm from
Whoever hang around you is dumb
Cuz they know you work wit' the po-po
Crooked I, ain't the one
See I been hopin' and wishin'
All you rappers Quit Snitchin'
Always talkin' to the police
Tryna send my homeboyz to prison
That ain't good where I'm from
Whoever hang around you is dumb
Cuz they know you work wit' the po-po
Crooked I, ain't the one

[Verse 2:]
Now I done seen you on the TV screen
Snitchin' to cops, you was on Channel 13
Now you try to say that you the west coast king
What tha' fuck does this skinny nigga mean
So damn cheap, you won't pay ya own team
Shoulda let me out ya whole little scheme
Mention my name and when you see me better swing
Talkin' 'bout peace in the Source magazine
Nope, too late for that, I wanna break your back
I can't wait to scrap, catch you in the alley
Just a snake and rat you need to face the fact
You ain't gangsta rap, you a federal√©
Need to live by the code of the street
I think about you when I'm loadin' my heat
But I'd rather throw blows to ya teeth
Cuz I was always taught shootin' hoes is weak
I'm still:
Feelin' adrenaline with the pistol and the penalty
Killin' 'em like I'm fillin' 'em with Penicillin
When the bullets are drillin' 'em, spinnin' 'em
A-round and I'm peelin' 'em the villain is willin'
To keep beef to a minimum
WOOOO!
Crooked I's the one
Snitch ass niggas need to hide and run
Go to the club and we ride wit' guns
But really we just wanna have fun...

[Hook]
See I been hopin' and wishin'
All you rappers Quit Snitchin'
Always talkin' to the police
Tryna send my homeboyz to prison
That ain't good where I'm from
Whoever hang around you is dumb
Cuz they know you work with the po-po
Crooked I, ain't the one
See I been hopin' and wishin'
All you rappers Quit Snitchin'
Always talkin' to the police
Tryna send my homeboyz to prison
That ain't good where I'm from
Whoever hang around you is dumb
Cuz they know you work with the po-po
Crooked I, ain't the one
