[Verse 1: Crooked I]
I'm hitting corners in the rich part of town
The part of town where people of color are not around
And if they are, then them niggas watered down
I’m not a clown, they lookin at me like I’m out of bounds
I’m sorry, I’m smelly like maguary
Smoking Coheeba cigars In the yellow Ferarri
Eating them lobster tails and calamari
We’re not supposed to live that American dream, are we?
You’d rather see me in cuffs than see me wrist glow
Valet the Porsche Carrera Grand Turismo
You cry a Motherfucking river when I get dough
Give me your standing O, when it’s lookin livin low
Your kids jumping on my band wagon
You nazi cops, the sheriff’s a Grand Dragon
I’m in the restaurant, pants sagging
Man them jackasses act like they never seen a nigga before

[Hook]
I got money, I can buy what I want
When I walk in the door it’s like they never seen a nigga before
The upper class always lookin at me funny everywhere I go
It’s like they never seen a nigga before
Police steady harassing a young nigga with no cash flow
It’s like they never seen a nigga before
But I can do what I wants to do, you asshole
Have you ever seen a nigga before?

[Verse 2]
I know some other minorities understand me
I fly first class, they ask if I won a grammy
We can’t be corporate, can we?
I’m in the Trump and the National out in Sunny Isles, Miami
People looking at me like I was from Mars cause I’m pulling Louis luggage outta stretch double R's
We business minded ghetto stars but niggas like Bill O'Reilly, he want us behind bars
They getting mad if I flip me a sack
But Reagan he gave us crack, so miss me with that
In fact, the RICO Act’s a mystery, it’s whack
And these Hip-Hop cops, they wanna kill the industry of rap
Treat me equally, that’d be nice
Until then I’ll write a song and see your salary twice
The diamond district keep handing me ice
While bouji customers act like they never seen a nigga before

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I see confederate flags are still around
When we move in they say the neighborhood is going down
Well I’m a genius in my field profound
I push property value up any town I’m around
And I never had a job in sports, just drive these sports cars
And subscribing to rob report
I’m in the islands sleepin' in the 5 star resort
I’m a baller, homie, hoes call me child support
At the bistro, I let the waiter pull out my chair
Before I sit down, the tension's already there
Out the corner of their eyes they stare
Discrimination's alive, I can feel it in the air
Yeah, then you know them racial slurs, while you looking at G’s
Soon as they coming out your mouth, that’s where a bullet'll be
Why you callin' the cops, they as crooked as me
This must be 1863

[Hook]
I got money I can buy what I want
When I walk in the door it’s like they never seen a nigga before
The upper class always lookin at me funny everywhere I go
It’s like they never seen a nigga before
Police steady harassing a young nigga with no cash flow
It’s like they never seen a nigga before
But I can do what I wants to do, you asshole
Have you ever seen a nigga before?
