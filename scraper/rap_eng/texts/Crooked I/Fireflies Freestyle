(Intro)
Yo, (C.O.B), Remember when back in the day Nigga's didn't wanna go pop?
This some pop shit, fuck y'all im going pop
Why y'all niggas can't smile, gangsta's can't smile?

Shinin’ like I’m ten million fireflies
If I fall, Crooked I will rise
I arrive in the fliest rides
Sittin’ on wires, the tires wide
The process of shittin’ on you has been finalized
But I ain’t nobody to idolize
They didn’t expect this nut to bust in the game
But I came by surprise
I came from the gutter
Now nothin’ can stop me from speakin’ not even a stutter
Nothin’ on the bread but butter
Nothin’ but government cheese in the cupboard
I used to hate it but it made me stronger so now I love it
Before I was hoppin’ in ‘64’s
Momma was shoppin’ in thrift stores, coppin’ her kids’ clothes
Popular kids know little Dominick’s piss poor
Look now, Dominick Intriago get dough
And I still get harassed by them Nazi cops
That used to chase a lil’ nigga when the block was hot
Choke me out with a baton, how many rocks you got
Then they wonder why we grow up and bust shots with Glocks
Go police your own hood, get the fuck outta mine
Guess you wanna see us dead one thug at a time
No food in your fridge inspires a hustler’s grind
Watchin’ your Momma cry over bills will fuck with your mind
Started runnin’ with some armed robbin’ home invaders
Them rich folks, they took a look at the chrome and paid us
The whole ghetto was criminals, it was so contagious
When in Rome, look at what becoming Roman made us
Dark-hearted, I just hit a lick
Then I hopped in the whip and couldn’t get the car started
Them niggas that I robbed, they gathered up their guns
They came out shootin’, I wasn’t a hard target
Shots came rippin’ through the metal and glass
The engine cranked, I ducked, hit the petal and smashed
Bullet holes in the front, bullet holes in the rear
I jumped out without a scratch, guess I’m supposed to be here
I’m thinkin’ my mother’s prayers probably kept me alive
God let me come out the car, coulda left me inside
But, uh, sometimes I wonder why he let me survive
Especially since so many done met a deadly demise
Damn, prolly to tell the world my million-dollar story
When it come to lyrics, the shit that you spittin’ kinda corny
Your written’s kinda bore me
I’m raisin’ the bar from nigga’s who were spittin’ hot before me
Fuck getting’ the Top 40
I’m magic on the mic, every verse you hear is voodoo
I’ma Gang Starr nigga, the world premier Guru
I’m still a pimp; your girl her rear coo-coo
Come here take off that La Pearl brassiere boo-boo
And now you fuckin’ with a ridah
Both started singin’ when I stuck the shit inside ‘em
Like
