[Intro]
This is the Invasion
The Evil Genius Green Lantern!
Immortal Technique, "The 3rd World"
It's on now motherfucker - ha, ha drop
You know you got the right to bear arms, huh
Sometimes you might have to brandish a motherfuckin firearm
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots

[Hook]
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the revolution!
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
But watch, where the fuck you shootin'!
Yo, where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
Where the fuck you niggas aimin' at?
Where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
This is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Volume 1, cop killer, hip-hop has never been realer
Volume 2 shot up the president like a guerilla
New York police state capital tried to swallow me
Locked me longer than Puerto Rico been a colony
Thirteenth Amendment slavery property
And now they signin rappers that promote their philosophy
Fuck that, nigga hip-hop is not Republican
That's just the white motherfuckers that own the publishin
And get the fuck out, if you want the foreigners gone
I paint the White House black and park my car on the lawn
Marry a Muslim girl and fuck her five times a day
Every time right before we shower and pray
You damn right the AK, symbolizes Jihad
But a holy war, is a conversation with God
You bitch niggas misinterpret what you don't understand
Stackin' the wrong sign can end up, shootin' your man
Shootin' each other, shootin' your brother
Aim the gun at the right motherfucker
And leave him colder than the prison in Russia
Or America's white power structure
Niggas love to say "Fuck revolution!"
Until the jury come in and move for the prosecution
And then brothers act like a born-again Huey Newton
Forgot about the bullshit music they was producin'
But my niggas aim precisely, through the confusion and

[Hook]
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the revolution!
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
But watch, where the fuck you shootin'!
Yo, where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
Where the fuck you niggas aimin' at?
Where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
This is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah

[Verse 2: Crooked-I]
I got a hundred shooters with me, Ruger shoot you through the kidney
Stand in front of the judge and lie quicker than Scooter Libby
I'm runnin' through the city, dear God
If I murk the racist Rush Limbaugh I wonder would you forgive me
Somebody told me Glenn Beck is the Klanâ€™s overseer
See ya, time to let him see a damn soldier
Flip your Landrover, I told ya I blam toasters
Gun pop off like the mouth of Ann Coulter
This is my gangsta religion
See I aim with precision, point blank the position
I'm black as them ancient Egyptians
Before European historians went and changed the description
I'm blamed for the 'caine in the kitchen
The C.I.A. playin' with the pigeons, same pain that I'm pitchin'
Listen, you dudes better watch the hook
I'm a boxer, coppers'll come up, Hoffa, look
They wanna get rid of this conscious crook
Like I'm an agnostic, apocryphal, non-canonical Gospel book
But I ain't goin' nowhere, that's the motherfuckin' truth
America don't care for its inner city youth, so I

[Hook]
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the revolution!
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
But watch, where the fuck you shootin'!
Yo, where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
Where the fuck you niggas aimin' at?
Where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
This is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
Puerto Rican superhero!
XL eternal, my journal, Sojourner, Nat Turner
Cop murdered by the certain burner turned in the back of his sternum
He flirted with pullin' me over for bein' brown, I bust
Now he in the back of the truck with Don Imus
I must, take aim when I lick shots
Throw stray bullets like when Nas got off of Pharoahe Monch
These pigs wanna see us dead inside a jail cell
Turn us from Shawn Carter to Sean Combs to Sean Bell
My temper 'bout to break like levees in New Orleans
Catch Jimmy Iovine when he refinance his mortgages
Kid illusion is dead, we movin' with the blue and the red
Latin Kings, Giuliani with a gat to his head
Y'all don't lick shots like killers aimin' at the Feds
Y'all lick shots like Jenna Jameson and Superhead
Pigs slice to Venice and beef at the benefits meet
Buried him on Venice Beach with the flies and the bees
Chino and Immortal Tech'
Kill shit like the Chinito at Virginia Tech
And Jacob ain't your friend, he's a fuckin' jeweler
Blap! Blap! I shoot the cats off your fuckin' Pumas

[Hook]
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the revolution!
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
But watch, where the fuck you shootin'!
Yo, where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
Where the fuck you niggas aimin' at?
Where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
This is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah
