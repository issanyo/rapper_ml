Take off...
I, I'm feelin' myself
I, I'm feelin' myself
And I'm feelin' myself, all black everything feelin' myself
Got a drop top Phantom and a chauffeur on deck
I could send 'em to your house if you really want that (Take that)
And she's feignin' for me, Ciroc in the air and my fitted on lean
I could take you anywhere, tell me where you wanna be
To the port 7:30, be you waitin' on me

If you, if you, want it.. Don't be, afraid I got it
I'll be there for ya, don't worry 'bout nothin'
I wanna give you my all
Girl if you, if you, want it, don't be, afraid I got it
I'll be there for ya, don't worry 'bout money
I gotta give you my all
You gotta be crazy, love drunk, caught up, baby to be with me
To be with me
You gotta be crazy, strung out, addicted, baby to be with me (be with me)
Be with me

Got my own crib, own cars, on everything
Helicopter pilot G5 on everything
We could fly to the by girl on everything
Then turn around, hit Vegas for a wedding ring
Now shawty elope with me, I treat it like my black car, she go with me
Now come and get it shawty, hop up on my spaceship
We spend dirty money, now don't get crazy

Girl if you, if you, want it, don't be, afraid I got it
I'll be there for ya, don't worry 'bout money
I gotta give you my all
You gotta be crazy, love drunk, caught up, baby to be with me
To be with me
You gotta be crazy, strung out, addicted, baby to be with me (be with me)
Be with me

[Crooked I]

Valet the phantom, me and Tiko on the Vegas Strip
Thought we was some aliens cause we jumped out of spaceships
People starin', waitin' for me to shapeshift
Into a normal person, but I ain't on the same shit
Crooked is a different dude, I stick and move
Know the cops want me eatin' that federal prison food
I'ma hustla, but yo that really isn't news
I'm just lookin' for a chick who envision with in the nude
Is it you?
I could tell the first time we hung out
You was crazy, addicted, and strung out
Now every time you come around my tongue out
Every part of you in my mouth, know what I'm talm bout
We can have sex in the sky, land on a helipad
Rippin' each other's clothes off, we want it hella bad
Cause baby you hella bad
I'm 'bout to put you in the yellow Jag, with Cinderella tags
