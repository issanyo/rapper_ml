[Intro]
Predator shit, PREDATOR!
("You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be?
You need people like me.")

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Let me get it
They let a Cali boy in Slaughterhouse, it's a wrap
38 specialist, rounds in the strap
Tryna get off the last ounce in the trap
My OG's in the 'Lac, bouncing to Zapp
That's our lifestyle, stunt hard, gun large
Picking 'em up not giving a fuck about a gun charge
Zipping 'em up in a body bag, fuck niggas mad
Welcome to our house, dead rappers in the front yard
I ain't Steve Nash, nobody get a pass
I found the nigga that made a top 50 hot MC list
And my Glock committed sodomy and shot him in the ass
Standing over his body I probably shoulda asked
Why the greatest rappers gotta be somebody from the past
Compared to Slaughterhouse, a lot of niggas trash
Following a fad, what would I do if they follow the Slaughter
They prolly swallow this hollow and a mag
Tongue full of dung, it's shit talking
Niggas want me dead, fuck it I'm still walking
Enemies in the club, fuck it I'm still parking the coupe
First put the roof on a milk carton
Walked in, they hand me the mic
Told baby girl it gotta be tonight
My bed or your bed?
Yeah I'm thinking with both heads
You know, great minds think alike

[Hook: Crooked I]
What you got under that skirt? (let me get it)
Vodka, Henny and that purp (let me get it)
Cribs, cars and net worth (let me get it)
Slaughterhouse gang, Tech N9ne go and get it

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Lot of molly, an out of body experience
I'm feeling kind of Gotti and all y'all into weird events
A party you prolly jolly counsel me when I'm inherent
With the shotty riding when I party it's Abu Dhabi
Who gonna pick it up, we gonna rip it up
And I'mma get up in my zone now
Fucking the women I'm up in her winning no money, I'm her bone pal
Pussy pounding I'm pushing polygamy procedures
Packing and popping pretty penis pockets I please her
These I ease, Techa Neez got the bees of an evil deed
But I'mma G, never see us
With a telescope nigga 'cause it's hella dope
I got so many worshipers with me, I could sell a quote
I yell the most, I tell the goat
I'm gonna take it even if they hate it and fill the boat
Fellas, you tell us to gel it, we're gonna quell his hope
Embellish ya melon fail to be real and develop rope de la throat
When I rhyme I'm conniving 'cause I bring
Live wickedness brightening your high beams
Frightening life like some lye in your Visine
Psyche swiped clean, high as the hygiene
Let me get it
Pussy, weed, or liquor yo, let me hit it
I don't kick it if you be messy with it
Tecca Nina keeping KCMO on the fitted
Any Slaughterhouse gang affiliation I'm fucking with it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Nobody seconding what I be spitting, we misfits
Gonorrhea mixed with diarrhea, that sick shit
You fuckers wack, need them Puffy plaques, them big hits
Them R. Kelly, I'm so rich I piss on a bitch hits
And bitches get the business
In a convertible eating big dick
While I'm parked like a picnic
Wrapping their big lips around my stick shift rocking French tips
Sucking me hollow after they swallow my kids
I'm asking

[Hook]
