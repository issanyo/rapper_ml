Punk ass music niggas is making, fuck that nigga

[Hook]
Realest niggas in the club (yeah)
In None We Trust

That's on everything I love
I really don't give a fuck
This is Sssutt Sssutt COB
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt if you're fuckin' with me

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Circle of Bosses, same kind of bosses, Slim Thug and Rosses
I see you dogs trynna walk in my paw prints
I'm throwin' bullets like the dolphins on offense
I know you cops probably want me in a cage
But my future so bright, it's even sunny in the shade
You thought I'd get this money and behave
Niggas left me for dead, did the Dougie on my grave
You rappers hatin' that I'm back again
I-D-G-A-F, my favourite acronym
Last of a dyin' breed, none created after him
Hustle god, chillin' with my Mary Magdalene
What's a god to a non-believer, he's still a god
COB, 'til the death, the realest squad nigga
A hundred deep in the club yellin' "Sssutt Sssutt"
The movement's bigger than music, Sssutt Sssutt

[Hook]
Realest niggas in the club (Horseshoe)
In None We Trust (Sauce The Boss)
COB, Crip Or Blood (Coniyac) they both ridin' with us (Iceman)
I graduated from a thug
Now I'm bossin' up
That's on everything I love (COB)
I really don't give a fuck
This is Sssutt Sssutt COB
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt if you're fuckin' with me
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt when I'm up in the club
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt, show your nigga some love
This is Sssutt Sssutt COB (COB)
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt if you're fuckin' with me
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt when I'm up in the club
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt, show your nigga some love
(Fuck you)


[Verse 2]
2012, Stanley Burrell, we got those blammers
You can't touch this, you got them old hammers
I work a Mac better than some computer programmers
I'll shoot your Entourage like HBO's cameras
Fake beggin' rappers, leave them bustas dead
If the Klan come for 'em, they be runnin' scared
If the COB come for you, and we on your head
It's goin' downhill from there like you on a sled
You don't give a fuck, it's the same here
I'm so ahead of my time that me and moms were born in the same year
COB bitch, live niggas never lose
I'll put you on the first 5 minutes of the news
Hand-me-down nigga, die in your brother's shoes
What I live by, my mothafuckin' rules
Some of the old west rappers, they fear him
Take your co-sign and shove it up your rear end (faggot)

[Hook]
Realest niggas in the club (yeah)
In None We Trust
COB, Crip Or Blood (COB), they both ridin' with us (yeah)
I graduated from a thug (to a boss)
Now I'm bossin' up (to a boss)
That's on everything I love
I really don't give a fuck
This is Sssutt Sssutt COB
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt if you're fuckin' with me
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt when I'm up in the club
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt, show your nigga some love
This is Sssutt Sssutt (yeah) COB
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt if you're fuckin' with me
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt when I'm up in the club
Let me hear the Sssutt Sssutt, show your nigga some love

[Outro]
COB is a religion
We believe in each other, yeah
COB!
