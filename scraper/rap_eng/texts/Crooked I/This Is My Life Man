Life As A Shorty shouldn't Be So Rough Every
Life As A Shorty shouldn't Be So Rough Every Every
Life As A Shorty shouldn't Be So Rough
Every Life As A shouldn't Shakin Be So Rough Every Every
Life As A Shorty Shouldn't Be So Rough
Here's How It Started Out
1 Day My Fathers Out
And he Nevr Came Back
7 Kidz In My Mamaz House
So Now We Drama'd Out
Money Wise We caught a Drought
Get That Green Paper By any means
Now Thats What Im About
And Here's Another Reason
Its Not The Summer Season
Ain't No Utilities On In My House
My Little Brother Freezin
How Can I Hustle Sleepin
Late Night To The Cud Im Creeping
I Can Hear That Money Breathing
I Leave U Bust In Sleeping
Them Streets Were Under Handed
Too Young To Understand It
It Makes My Nerves Bad
Thugin As The Youngest Bandit
But I Could Not Run And Had It
I Had To Man Up
I Wanted To Go To College Probably Fucked My Plans Up
I Wanted To Be A Scholar How I Ended In Hand Cuffs
Every Night My Mamaz Cryin
But I Got To Stand Tough
Look At Me Im Waving Pistols
Gimmi Every Thing U Got I Screaming
15 And Im On A Mission
God Help Me Get Away From These Demons
This Is My Life Man U Say U Understand
U Claim U Feelin My Pain But U Really Dont Give A Damn
U C Me In Them Streets
No Lyin On These Beach
I Speak The Truth And the Proof
Man Ima Tell U Who I Am
This Is My Life Man U Say U Understand
U Claim U Feelin My Pain But U Really Dont Give A Damn
U C Me In Them Streets
No Lyin On These Beach
I Speak The Truth And the Proof
Man Ima Tell U Who I Am
15 And Im On A Mission
God Help Me Get Away From These Demons
They Block My Rightous Vision
I Can C Them Even When I Dreamin
Wish We Was The Cause To Struggle
Wish We Was All In Trouble
Wish We Get Pass All The Mysteries
Wish We Can Solve The Puzzle
People Dont Understand Me
I Got To Help My Family
My Focus Is Uncanny
What Caused For The Future Hand me
Enimies Wouldn't Care To Twist Me
Gun Shots and they Barely Miss Me
When U Thugin Out There Its Risky
But The Man Upstairs Is With Me
Ive Lost So Many Homies
Some Even Burned Alive
We all Been Part Of This sick War B4 We Learnt To Drive
Only Thing U Hearing In Both Ears Is That we survived
Cuz When U Leave On With Ur Chrome U Want to Return Alive
What Kind Of Person Am I
Growin Up In This Savage Hood
Wish I Was Average Man
Crooked Is Damaged Goods
My Past Is Not The Best
Its Bad And I Confess
But I Gotta Make It since So Many depend On My Success
This Is My Life Man U Say U Understand
U Claim U Feelin My Pain But U Really Dont Give A Damn
U C Me In Them Streets
No Lyin On These Beach
I Speak The Truth And the Proof
Man I Tell U Who Ima Am
This Is My Life Man U Say U Understand
U Claim U Feelin My Pain But U Really Dont Give A Damn
U C Me In Them Streets
No Lyin On These Beach
I Speak The Truth And the Proof
Man Ima Tell U Who I Am
This Is My Life Man Its Much More Than Music Homie
Stare At Me This Is The Young Mans Medicine Right Here
This Is My Life Homie
U Know Im Talkin About
Way More Than Music
Ghetto America
Ghetto Mother Fuckin America
This Is The Life He Gave Me
This Is My Life Homie
Life As A Shorty shouldn't Be So Rough
Life As A Shorty shouldn't Be So Rough Every Every
Life As A Shorty shouldn't Be So Rough Every Every
Life As A Shorty Shouldn't Be So Rough
