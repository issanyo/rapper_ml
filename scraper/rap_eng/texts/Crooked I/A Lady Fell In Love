[Intro]
Fuck man. Damn man, I was fucking a lot of bitches on Death Row
But god damn man, I'm fucking way more bitches on this Shady shit
Man this shit ain't even cool man like these bitches falling in love
Man I need to come clean, not even bitches man, like women man
I need to come clean with this shit, damn Dominick

[Verse 1]
Dear women in my life
Past, present, and future I'm giving you the right
To judge me now, bringing my sinning to the light
Even the women I might be swimming in tonight
Even the women that wanna kill me with the knife
Cause they heard about other women I'm givin' em the pipe
I'm knowing the way that a nigga living isn't right
But my angels and demons they keep getting in a fight
Half of me wants to be happily married with a family, just like plenty of dudes
But the other half wanna keep fucking these bad ass bitches out here who keep sendin' me nudes
I know a lot of men been in my shoes
Crooked so confused, when he winning he lose
He winning in the fuck a bad bitch category
But he losing with the shallow ass women he choose
I mean, god almighty, look at the body
On little mommy, fo sho, you a hotty
Knew where I was stayin' so she waited in the lobby
She a predator, I'm her prey and she shot me
Now we in the room man, working the sheets
We going half on some twins, that's a person a piece
She kept coming on strong but my woman back home gon' be hurting for weeks
Got the dirt in the streets, cause

[Hook]
This temptation is a real situation
And my chick been patient for all my of fornication
Hop in your panties, I'm risking it all
Cheating so how can my family evolve
Real good girl in a fucked up world
A lady fell in love with a god damned dog
Once upon a time in the LBC, a lady fell in love with a god damned dog
Once upon a time in the LBC, a lady fell in love with a god damned me
Hop in your panties, I'm risking it all
Cheating so how can my family evolve
Real good girl in a fucked up world
A lady fell in love with a god damned dog

[Verse 2]
You there? You ask if I care? The answer is yeah
You ask me to swear, I know it ain't fair, I know I'm a player
You where? Why are you there?
How can I be mad if she flipped the script
Tired of lies and decide to hop dick-to-dick
Crying her eyes out in my house
Decide to find out how I feel if another nigga lick the uh
Some niggas won't admit it but I'm telling you that we don't give a fuck if we've been cheating
We don't want you getting even
We don't even want you leaving even though we been creeping and meeting people in the mother fucking hotel
We be like "oh well", wax that ho tail, then I make a song about it
I give the bitch some bars like no bail, Peace Prize Nobel
Feeling fucked up when it's all over the real shit begin
A guilt trip again, and she sick of going through thick and thin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Can anybody feel me? Can anybody feel me?
I'm talking bout the real me
And the real me is guilty of putting many women in the eye of the storm
Is it truth serum Crooked I is on
Every song ain't gon' have a happy ending, the old lady said I would die alone
If I don't change all of my ways, I'mma live all of my days
In a daze under the haze of a cloud full of darkness
Can't swallow the pain and the pain's all in my brain
And I can't follow the maze, man I'm lost, I ain't heartless
I looked in the crystal ball and the only thing I saw
Was me standing all alone, me standing on my own
I looked in the crystal ball and the only thing I saw
Was me standing all alone, how did I end up all alone

[Hook]
