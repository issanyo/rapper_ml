[Verse 1]
C.O.B in this bitch, wave the black flag
Different kind of gang member, house nigga, back back
I tell my bitch pussy pop on a handstand
While the world going to hell in her Louis handbag
It ain't the end of the world, but it's like the end is starting
Adam Lanza killing 20 children in a kindergarten
Wade Michael Page shooting up a Sikh Temple
George Zimmerman the reason I'mma keep pistols
Even though I don't fuck with the NRA
Cause the CEO Wayne LaPierre, yo what he say
Man he try to blame violence on rap music and video games
Like we out here killing for any old thing
If I was reckless I would tell you rappers give me your chain
A million views on Vimeo
I creep low through the Savannah, I'm hunting you, gazelle and deer
What's that? I can smell your fear
I'm a apex predator

[Hook]
Ridin' in the Coupe, man
Real niggas, we the top of the food chain
Don't make me turn the whole club into a shootin' range
King of the jungle, fuck with me my gun go bang
My gun go bang, my gun go bang, and my gun go
Fuck with me my gun go bang, my gun go bang, and my gun go bang
My gun go bang!

[Verse 2]
I'm a apex predator, pineal gland in forefront
On your third eye, graduated to my fourth one
You cross us in the street nigga, you're done
Like a child support judge, we hold court son
Glen Beck want us all to die
And Ted Nugent want us all to die
But real niggas don't die
We like that shopping center bag full of tissue, we multiply
I know I reached for that one
No serial numbers, you know I reach for that gun
I call on Bonnie, she my right hand girl
I can't even turn my music up in this white man's world
If I do, I get shot by a psycho's favorite gun
Sorta like Jordan David was my Michael David Dunn
We need help, won't nobody listen to them hollow tips that's hittin' politicians
I'm a apex predator

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bang, hit em up, perfect execution
I'm in the underground training for the revolution, you niggas scared of shootin'
You ain't gotta agree with Darwin to stand your monkey ass up, this is evolution
I knew that rebel G shit would be back soon
For you thousand dollar house, niggas call you rap coons
I hang with foreign mobsters and black goons
Type of people that'll strike fear into a packed room
They ain't afraid of my nine though
They in fear of what my mind know
They know I ain't walkin' with my eyes closed
My entourage is camouflaged by nice clothes
Blood in our veins is ice cold cause we apex predators!

[Hook]
