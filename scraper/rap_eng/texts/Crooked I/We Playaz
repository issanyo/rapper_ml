(Intro) TipToe

Tha streets need us come on
Its your boy TipToe
I got my nigga Crooked I rollin with me tonight
What up nigga
Circle of Bosses nigga
You know the love is bulletproof
Hey Crooked-I let's ride out
You know how we do!

(Verse 1) Crooked-I

Yo
I keep a chrome clapper
The jeans sag hard
I am no actor
Don't need a SAG card
But I keep a lotta green in the backyard
I don't mean grass
Bitch I mean cash
Fuck street cred
In the ghetto
I got a Steve Nash
That's a mean pass
Some code red
Some suit blue
I C.O.B.,
And I shoot too
The TEC-22
Shoot through your neck
Boo-hoo
The set's cuckoo
Wanna disrespect do you
I'll be flying over Maui
While you lyin in Cali
You'll be dyin in an ally
If he do you a hit good
I'll buy him a Denali
Fuck it the hit costs less than all the ice in my medallion
Long
And I know I'm wrong
East Side
Godzilla
Long Beach
King Kong
Crooked gone

(Hook)

You's a hater
I heard what you said
We playerz
We go and get the bread
You hater
Wanna see a nigga dead
We playaz
We can put a price on your head
Niggas can hate me
But niggas can't stop me
Niggas can try
But niggas can't copy
I know there's niggas out there
That wanna kill me
We gettin money
So I know the streets feel me

(Verse 2) TipToe

I'm young, black and rich
I got an MTV crib
I'm not big
But ever car I roll in
Got big rims
I wave to my rich neighbors
Smiling like Ima made man
You won't find the crib
I'm tucked away like a cave man
I live like a pop-star
Party like a rock-star
All I do is cop cars
And have bitches drop drawers
New money, new shoes
Body full of tattoos
I'm fresh
I'll make a white girl love a black dude
I get money with boss niggas
With million dollar stashes
I bought my bitch the same whip
MAC-10 bought Glasses
Ima black mans dream
Niggas love me in the streets
Ima females dream
Bitches love me in the sheets
I'm a cop hater
Judge killer
Hustle like a drug dealer
All I fuck with
Is these crazy ass thug niggas
I fuck with real niggas
Kill you for a loud mouth
I'll get you whacked in Cali
While we down south

(Hook)

You's a hater
I heard what you said
We playerz
We go and get the bread
You hater
Wanna see a nigga dead
We playaz
We can put a price on your head
Niggas can hate me
But niggas can't stop me
Niggas can try
But niggas can't copy
I know there's niggas out there
That wanna kill me
We gettin money
So I know the streets feel me
You's a hater
I heard what you said
We playerz
We go and get the bread
You hater
Wanna see a nigga dead
We playaz
We can put a price on your head
Niggas can hate me
But niggas can't stop me
Niggas can try
But niggas can't copy
I know there's niggas out there
That wanna kill me
We gettin money
So I know the streets feel me
