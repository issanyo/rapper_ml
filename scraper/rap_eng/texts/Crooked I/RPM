[Verse One: Paypa]
Look, our street is rapping like I’m trapping, fuck a hobby
Trapeze artist, shit I’m into catching bodies
Asking for a verse is like asking for a hearse
Asking for a feature, should be asking for a preacher
My nigga, I’m ether, heavy weight, no bar bells
Me, more sweet 16’s than an Tarheel
I be really up at night, serving like a bar grill
Swerving on that 60, trying not to hit that guard rail
Mmm, bitches want that molly, they be popping twos
Pull up in that 50, watch them bitches choose
Hit my nigga Jason when we copping jewels
Pull up to the party, jewelry godly, you can tell I’m new
Stunting on these niggas like I never had nothing
Taking pictures of these bitches while they Instagram fronting
Show me something I ain’t never seen, baby fuck etiquette
Rap, pussy, money, pussy, money, that’s a definite down

[Hook]
Mmm, everything I be talking bout, I really mean that shit
Pull up in the truck let them hoes out, you ain’t never seen that shit
I’m talking rap, pussy, money, rap, pussy, money
Rap, pussy, money, rap, pussy, money
Rap, pussy, money, rap, pussy, money
Rap, pussy, money, I would take it all down

[Verse Two: Crooked I]
A rubber band around a hundred grand I got from some hookers
That’s how a real nigga rap, pussy, money
I don’t write my nigga, I go and gas
Last time I wrote was a note to a holding class
Hate when an ashy face bitch show her ass
It’s called make up, shout out to Hov and Dash
I smash the pedal to the floor, bored of the Porsche
I’m from the four quarters of course, guns galore
So many magazines, you think the board ordered the Source
A whore hoarder giving raw orders to restore order
A Rolex make my time fly a lot faster
Took me from a slave ship to a yacht master
Amber Rose my hoes, blond baldy like they fuck cancer
The block answer, I am the…
Coming for your neck like a guillotine
Getting money with Billy Jay, not Billy Jean, Paypa

[Hook 2]
Mmm, everything I be talking bout, I really mean that shit
Pull up in the truck let them hoes out, you ain’t never seen that shit
I’m talking rap, pussy, money, rap, pussy, money
Rap, pussy, money, rap, pussy, money
Rap, pussy, money, rap, pussy, money
Rap, pussy, money, no particular order but damn
