[Intro]
You out grown Nikki up

Bet she can say she was sex fiend
You out grown Nikki up

[Verse 1]
Strictly models and bottles
Bitches gargle and swallow
Strictly models and bottles
Bitches gargle and swallow
Strictly models and bottles
Bitches gargle and swallow
Hit the throttles get over that pothole
In auto and I know
Haters followin' squabble
When I go mano y mano
Fuck my models, I kill you
My guns I fill autos with hollows
Tuck it in my waist
In case you thinking I'mma
Punch 'em in his face
Swinging I'mma squeeze the llama
We piranhas, leave you on a street
You wanna see mañana
Pre-Madonna season 1 of CSI
I bring the drama
Hard, body and I
Hit a nigga with a couple of bullets like a
John Gotti in disguise
That's a rapper, click clack your
Somebody gon' die
Physical with your physical deflict won't mess with me
And I'mma gonna get it on Nikki
We Bonnie and Clyde
We Lil' Kim and Biggie, we Hennessy and Sticky
Made for each other, you haters come and get me
You haters coming with me, she gon' give you a hickie
That red bean on your neck, a kiss of death from Nikki

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck around I surround you
Couple rounds when that howl
Surveilled crawl the shit out you
Down on the ground where they found you
We devour you cowards now
Cause our power allow us
We don't bounce with you slouchers
Life's outstanding without you
And I don't even care
What's you busters planning
My pistol's in the air
Call out the upper hand and
Bust my cannon gun gigantic
Suckers running, mothers panic
Brother franning, come god damn it
Hump the granite, fuck this planet
Nikki take the control
She be cumming when I play with her click click
Strip you naked for show
Then she blow you, black hole you
Biggest gangster I know
Soon as you choose for me to shoot you
In the future
I introduce you to my baby Nicole
She likes ménage à trois, mardi gras, ADIDAS
All day she dreamin' about sex
She even body broads
You think you can handle us
Say under your breath
Cause you gon' fall for her
When she love you to death

[Hook]
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(I love my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(Meet my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(I love my baby Nikki)
You out grown Nikki up
Bet she can say she was sex fiend
(Meet my baby Nikki)

[Interlude]
Two love birds riding in the streets
K-I-L-L-I-N-G
Two love birds riding in the streets
K-I-L-L-I-N-G
Two love birds riding in the streets
K-I-L-L-I-N-G
Two love birds riding in the streets
K-I-L-L-I-N-G
