[Verse 1: Crooked I]

I heard they put a noose around the neck of 2Pac's statue in Georgia
Man, I would've clapped you and floored ya
Crooked got an attitude that due to morgue ya
Fuck your body, my shots pass through your aura
Adapt to the horror
Bitches get shot in they baby fat
Run and tell that to Kimora
Shots get to jumping out the automatic strokes
And you somebody who took the hypocratic oath
A doctor I gotchya, then I disappear like I got a magic cloak
Still Dodger hatted low
Ridin' through the Eastside, Crooked I's so hood
Slidin' down Keen when I see my nigga no good
I don't know you but I know niggas from yo hood
Ask if I dump them things, they say he sho' would
On the internet a rapper is in fear
Tried to disrespect me, said I ain't his peer
But he was correct see cause Crooked ain't his peer
He never pushed a whip in his whole fucking career
He never had a crystal clear diamond in his ear
I kick you in your motherfuckin' rear, listen here
I kidnap him, put him in a trunk then I steer
Strip him butt naked, put a brassiere on a queer
Put him on Youtube, this is a world premier
No you ain't my peer, I toss you off a pier
You fucking with a dropout, sitting at the rockhouse
Me and Big Doc watching cluckers get knocked out
Ask my cousin Trigger Loc, I pull Glocks out
Once had to go and shoot my girlfriend's pop's house
I ain't ask to live this crazy ass life man
You ain't met a nigga like me in your life span
Niggas be frontin' when they in front of the mic stand
I won't touch you, you'll get socked out by Dice man
This year Halloween fell on a Weekly
Me and my Eastsiders are beastly
If you a real Eastsider then you Easty
But if you ain't been here in ten years then you can't see me
I'm from the ghetto where they fight in the park
Cut the lights out, niggas shoot dice in the dark
Like twins joined at the hip, I got twice the heart
If somebody die in this movie, I'm writing the part

[Outro]
Yeah, irst of all to the nigga who put that motherfuckin' noose around 2pac's statue
You's a bitch
And I use the word nigga cause nigga apply to any motherfuckin' race
And you niggas on the internet
Talking shit, I'm watching you nigga
If I see you, you better bow down nigga
New West movement nigga
I'm class of '94 nigga

[Refrain]
