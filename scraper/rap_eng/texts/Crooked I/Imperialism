[Verse 1: Niqle]
Lord knows what I'm bout to do
I'm bout to put those Forgiato's on that Beamer Coupe
I got my Teflon vest and now I feel invincible
Gotta still protect my neck cause I ain't got no roof
Police just kicked in the door
After I sold a brick
They heard a nigga got more spots than a doberman
And I remember selling dope till it was over with
When I ran out of crack cocaine I sold deodorant
See I'm going to get this fucking money by any means
I got these fucking quarter pounder's like Mickey D's
My only claim of the thing is I serve the feins
32 around my waist like those skinny jeans
I'll let it breathe on you bitches niggas that still be hating
Because I ride on three-piece rims, they still on Dayton's
To keep it real ...I don't know, I'm kind of still debating
If I should wash money in rap or do some real estate-ing

[Hook: Niqle]
Would like to give a special thank you for who made me famous
And want to give a special fuck you to them fucking haters....HA
I know you waiting on me just to fall
These niggas left me in these streets they thought that I would starve.....HA
Me and Satan had some conversations
I'm gone send your ass to hell
Now you got reservations...HA
You sold your soul for materialism
C.O.B taking over this imperialism
HA

[Verse 2: Niqle]
That new Bugatti cost a million dollars
So tell illuminati I'm going need a billion dollars
My bitch mastered given brain like she done went to college
She stuff that don't inside her pussy when we hit the projects
I told the kids stay in school don't take for granted
I played my fucking calls right to them I'm fucking Gambit
I want to be like Niqle Nut because he keep his cannon
That nigga diamonds clear blue, same colors Captain Planet
I beg to differ but I never ever begged those bitches
Momma Jehovah witness so I never had a Christmas
The only thing I had close was a ghetto vision
My father told me skies the limit if you keep on living
I got my back against the wall, I get it in
After my moved right out the hood I gotta a Benz
I thank God every day cuz I seen many men
Lose their life between the 405 and 710 haaa

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Poppin since I came in the door, got me a record deal
Then I put half of that shit in my niggas that's slangin' the blow
Double my hustle I'm making fasho'
Stuff A380 for popping these suckers
Fucking these hoes not rocking no rubbers
Wanted to be like my uncles and cousins
Thought that my brother was rocket on colors
All I wanted to do was get that paper, fuck what a pig say
Whipping around in the Benz, aye, ballin' until my chin gray
Hundred thousand a month on rent
I be moonwalkin' all across the mothafuckin' floor
Pray to god when I go that a nigga die just like MJ
That's balling it out (COB!!!)
Bitches on in the house (COB!!!)
Dick is all in her mouth (COB!!!)
Pop bottles while y'all in a drought
It's Niqle and Crook
We taking over you niggas is shook
Grill in my mouth to give it the look
Here come the hook

[Hook]
