[Intro: Crooked I]
Uhh... Yeah
Naw I ain't tryin' to say that you nigga's is dead and gone
But uhh... A lot done change since you put LBC on the map
You feel me?
I mean, lil' nigga's is riding skateboards and roll up and blast you
You Know?
We done changed them Impalas for Chargers and mothafuckin' 300C's
We done turned them Chuck Taylor's into Ice Creams and Vans
Niggas is gettin' money
We bosses now

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
This is how you get to Long Beach if you never been
Take the 405 Freeway or the 7-10
A clever spot's but you better put your weapons in
Illegal search, cops looking for that evidence
Let me tell you bout the city that I represent
You can find my footprints covered in every inch
My nigga's hold me down lovely when I'm in a pinch
When shits ugly in the trenches, we getting drenched
Long Beach we ain't fucking with the shooting range
Practice shooting at each other to improve our aim
I wish it wasn't but it is I know who to blame
Them crooked feds gave us guns and said "do ya thang"
It never rains in California is what they say though
We made it snow in the 80's with all that yayo
Ask Pedro, he built a tunnel in Mexico
When you come out that bitch you in San Diego
Bring the work to the hood and nigga's stunt hard
Put the DuPont Registry in your front yard
Spend a Harvard education, that's on one car
And you ain't even put no rims on it thus far
When you riding through my hood bring your ammunition
You in Long Beach nigga, read the vandalism
Where you and your big homie share the same mannerisms
In the school of hard knocks is teachin' scandlisms

[Hook: Crooked I]
All my nigga's if ya feel me
We gets busy over here (LBC)
Selling purple on the corner (on the corner)
LBC I thought I told ya (I thought I told ya)
All my bitches if ya feel me
We gets busy over here (LBC)
We get our dough like we supposed to (like we supposed to)
Still keep it gangsta I thought I told ya (I thought I told ya)

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Long Beach bitches got a lot of swag in 'em
Lot of Dolce and Gabbana, a lot of Prada bag in 'em
We got some bad women
All I know is them jeans ain't nothin' but denim unless they got some ass in 'em
Girls pass by nigga's quick to try and spit
They don't give us action and we start talking shit
Like keep the steppin' bitch
You can eat a dick, with them hitch hiker tittes
Look like they need a lift
Go buy some Clearasil
Why I gotta say you ugly when a mirror will?
Bitch busted as a stolen car steering wheel
Damn just a minute ago she had whip appeal
Uh! That's nigga's for ya
Now we getting drunk over my home girls house
I'm posted like a slouch til' I hurled on the couch
Aw hell to the naw
First thing out her mouth, "What the hell is that about"
Naw you nigga's gotta bounce
Don't let that nigga drive
Last thing she hollered out
Cause she care about her homies safety
That's without a doubt
Long Beach gangsta bitches in the park fighting
Squares never know what kinda hoe they start liking
Give they heart to a bitch that's ready to start diking
They catch her in bed with a chick stronger then Mike Tyson
Every body in the city's cheating on each other
At the Residents Inn nigga's skeeting on the cover
White girls say they like creepin' with the brothers
But they fathers say don't let me catch you sleeping with them others
That's Long Beach you got to love us
Hahahaha... Mufuckas

[Hook: Crooked I]
All my nigga's if ya feel me
We gets busy over here (LBC)
Sellin' purple on the corner (on the corner)
LBC I thought I told ya (I thought I told ya)
All my bitches if ya feel me
We gets busy over here (LBC)
We get our dough like we supposed to (like we supposed to)
Still keep it gangsta I thought I told ya (I thought I told ya)
