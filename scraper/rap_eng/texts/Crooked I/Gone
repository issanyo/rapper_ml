[Intro: DJ Drama]
Truthfully
It's what the game did to us
It's what it made me
Be myself
I just tried to get my name on the flyer
That's it
You look back, like "Damn, I did it"
Came with a price though
At some point we all gone

[Chorus: K-Young]
The room is spinnin’
My mind's runnin' around in circles
I can’t even hear the thoughts I’m thinkin’
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Talkin’ to myself, I tell me Crooked is real as this
Life is a bitch and death wanna steal a kiss
Slap you when you’re born, when you’re gone they feel your wrist
To see if your pulse still exist
Livin' in the belly of the beast is a real abyss
Yeah, walk in a straight line is what you entertain
Then you slang to pay your bills, that‘s your yin and yang
The daily challenge to find balance within your brain
There’s something else livin' inside your heart other than your pain
I look as life as a lesson
For me to change is like a Rolex for a gift: no better time than the present
If not, I’ma be smokin’ chronic
Drinkin’ on vodka 'til I choke on my own vomit 'cause life’s a broken promise (gone)

[Chorus: K-Young]
The room is spinnin’
My mind's runnin' around in circles
I can’t even hear the thoughts I’m thinkin’ (Gangsta)
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone
'Cause I’m gone (I need help)
I’m gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
When that Slaughterhouse album comin’? What’s the ETA?
Where that good music at? Where that beat from Ye?
Is Crooked and Yaowa only in that group to keep from bein'
In the streets to distribute yay? Is Royce and Marshall
'Bout to link and go their secret way? Is Joe gon' start a show
With all his ho's like he the protégé of Stevie J for easy pay?
Before y’all become a memory
Would y’all please do a song with Kendrick, Young Money, and MMG?
These questions and suggestions they hard to maintain
When you fuck with Flex, but you worry ‘bout what Charlemagne think?
'Cause you from the D and you don’t get no radio play in ya own home
Long as y’all playing Sean I’m good, I’m grown
Nigga, I’m gone

[Chorus: K-Young]
The room is spinnin’
My mind's runnin' around in circles
I can’t even hear the thoughts I’m thinkin’
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Have you ever tried to
Stop crying but couldn’t? Them shots fly in my hood and
Sometimes it'll force a guy to say bye-bye to a good one
Dust them slacks from in the back of that closet and button up
Don’t crumble up when you approachin' his mother, that hug is tough
It'll make you asthmatic, some can’t hack it, but look at me
I wear my hat backwards and rap fantastic, 'cause I’m a G
Royce, far as that block I ride past that for them B’s
But my niggas mathematics? Bad traffic, still in the streets
Long as they there, I’m there, survivin’ for them ones
But they won’t stay there, I swear I'ma write ‘em out the slums
So when a gun is drawn in the hood, man, they good on my tour bus
Puffing, bumping this song, fucking fans feeling lucky, we gone

[Chorus: K-Young]
The room is spinnin’
My mind's runnin' around in circles
I can’t even hear the thoughts I’m thinkin’
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Thought we were defying the odds, I thought that we weathered the storm
I thought that we'd travel the same road, I thought that we’d never conform
Don’t tell me you bastards tricked me, don’t tell me that I was just wrong
'Cause now I'm maskin', it gets to me whenever we 'bout to perform
Though we was about to heat up, it’s taking a while to get warm
If not for the fact that I love you niggas, and we all get along
I swear I'd been got
Thought we could all see the writin' on the wall
Now I’m disheveled, we was rebels, it ain’t as exciting as before
Maybe the fact that I been solo so long has kinda spoiled me
Or when I’m annoyed do I try to avoid becoming a victim of loyalty?
We was so cutting edge— (yeah)
—my address is this fucking ledge
Won’t be unhappy, I know how I get when in this state
If I let her fuck me this time it'll be considered rape
We were saviours on our own terms, I’ve learned
If any three of you have wavered let me know so I can wave good... nah

[Chorus: K-Young]
The room is spinnin’
My mind's runnin' around in circles
I can’t even hear the thoughts I’m thinkin’
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone
'Cause I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone
