[Verse 1: Crooked I]
I look out my window, I see homeless people sleeping
Catching Z's on the cement, wonder if they even dreaming
Meanwhile PETA beefin' over who should be a vegan
Feeding animals better food than these people are eating
One of em told me Walmart just fired 20 workers
For 6 months straight, nobody would hire any workers
I'm so hungry I could cry, wouldn't lie for any purpose
Could you find it in your heart to buy me any Churches
Bottom of 20 pieces, shitty in these city streets
Too many penniless peeps, plenty Remy in your reach
That could be a enemy to man cause really when he drinks he thinks
Fuck a 50 dollar billy gimme brinks
You know how it goes, no nuts no glory
Bitches on my dick, hoe what's your story?
Probably want kids, no luck, no Maury
Looking for a Joe, go fuck Joe Torre
I'm from a place where, snakes never play fair
The ninth dude at the table but it's only 8 chairs
A stand-up guy til I'm rocking gray hairs
Giving lame squares a blank stare, like I ain't there
Cause lames swear they getting bank, but can't share with a char-ity
You can't care, then homie change your game player
Best believe we all bleed and breathe the same air
From here to St. Claire, I speak my mind because I ain't scared
Somebody gotta tell you this
Cancer kills way more Americans than any Arabic terrorist
We use more money to fight them than finding a cure
So a little kid sits there with his chemo-therapist
Hair falling out while his vital signs weaken
He'll be dead while his parent are in debt for his treatment
It's a cold world, O M G
If I was God, I'd be like Oh My Me
Some of us humans are so grimy
I'm thinking out loud homie don't mind me
Week 8, you wasn't expecting this
I gotta give you jewels can't keep em all on my neck and wrist
And fuck the police you triple 6'd Nero Caesar
Overseers and Luc-i-fers, we don't need ya, heroes neither
C.O.B's a secret society from here to Rio de Ja-neiro
Man the truths already known
Religion been fucking my people way before Eddie Long
Niggas ain't got tomato sauce to put spaghetti on
Preachers live in fat houses, call em they Larry Holmes
You see our maximums might of been your minimums
Prayed for baby food having a diaper was a miracle
Sugar water bottle man, no vitamins and minerals
Future of a fireman ain't brighter than a criminals
That's how we feel, niggas starving navel touching your spine
Putting food on the table wasn't a crime
You unable to get signed to a label
Life ain't a fucking rap video so watch the cable fuck with ya mind
But what you do in the dark'll come to the light
So I shine all day because I grind all night
Seven series Beamer now I need to bring my team up
Street sweepers on the block cause we in this thing to clean up
SSUTT SSUTT C.O.B my nigga yeah
SSUTT SSUTT C.O.B my nigga yeah
SSUTT SSUTT, SSUTT SSUTT, SSUTT SSUTT
