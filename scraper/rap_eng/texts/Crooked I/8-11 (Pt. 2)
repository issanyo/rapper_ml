[Intro: Crooked I]

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
I’m smarter than you niggas
I’m harder than you niggas
I’m sonnin’ and I’m daughterin’ you niggas. Oh yeah
Slaughterhouse so I’m slaughterin’ you niggas. Oh yeah
Slaughterhouse so I brought ‘em out
My guns and my notebooks
Qwest on the beats
We just tryna keep the West on its feet
We the best ‘cause the rest don’t compete
You the stress on the street
We the Kush, push the ink pen
Fresh on the sheets, keep your pets on a leash
I’m a beast, and nothing’s outside of my reach
I sit on a plateau designed for kings and high priests
That’s the peak that I’ve reached
That’s the reason I preach
The way the words bless you
You should sneeze when I speak, nephew
And I’m back, just me and my peeps
Through the keyhole in your soul the all-seeing eye peeks
My mind state so calm it could redefine peace
My rhyme flow so hot it can even fry grease
Sit low in your ‘vette
You can pimp hoes, bet
But you don’t know the secret mysteries of Imhotep
Jim Crow, can’t follow in big bro’s steps
Kinfolk didn’t know I’m a sick flow vet
I just sit and watch the Internet ride rappers’ dicks
Givin’ ‘em five stars, I kill ‘em in five bars
What difference do it make if I’m rich or if I’m living in my car?
Long as I’m out spittin’ I’m by far
Top 5 dead or alive, your list is buggin’ me
Count myself twice, the rest of Slaughterhouse the other three
Lollipop at no charge: man I’m sucker-free
Molly Wop at no charge: they don’t come with fees
Hip-Hop needs a balanced diet nowadays:
There need to be the Lupe’s and the Kanye’s
There need to be the Bun B’s and the Andre’s
Put Mickey Factz and Wale on your entrée
Don’t get it twisted: I ain’t mad at a tasty biscuit
Just know your place on the plate when I’m gravy-dipping
“Man I hate them C.O.B. niggas, they be trippin’
They came in the station gooned up and they made me listen”
That’s the DJ, I make ‘em hear what they be missin’
I got bars for you pussies like a lady prison
Heh, like a lady prison
8-11: You can see me live in HaterVision
