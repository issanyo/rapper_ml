[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Ay, S-L-A, U-G-H, T-E-R, H-O-U-S-E
Yes we are, the best in the biz, the West in the bitch, this East side LB
Money over coochie, mayne, 645 when dip through the burbs
I be on my Gucci Mane, smash on the gas, kick a bitch to the curb
House in the hills, thousands and mill's
Getting wild in the field with your spouse in Brazil
On ounces and pills, how does it feel?
To count dollar bills that I piled off skills
Check it out, Jets fly private
Nigga S5 Hybrid, baby test drive my whip
I’m in Bed Stuy with my chick
On my West side fly shit
Pulling out minks when the weather get chilly
Left Eye side kick
Now don’t you niggas go chasing waterfalls
These bitches wall to wall and they love them Slaughter's y'all

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my motherfucking life
My life, oh yeah
This is my motherfucking life
(Jets fly private, Nigga S5 Hybrid, Baby test drive my whip)

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Sometimes I look around and I just, I just can’t believe it
I’m on a high like a falsetto, maybe that’s why I feel like I’m dreaming
My eyes just quit, look what I’m seeing
My life just shifted, I feel like I’m breathing
Light that spliff
Nah, I don’t even smoke cause it burn my throat but tonight I’m steaming
Patron in my cup, holding mine up
Toasting with a slut, that I know I'm gon' fuck
In these five star sheets, put her right to sleep, then kick the bitch out when I wake up
Even though baby girl got a large ol' ass
I remember praying that my cargo's last
Now my car so fast, I don't think you understand in a Murcielago dash
When it hurts but you ride through the dirt, and you work till it hurt, and you end up on Marshall’s staff
Hoping that your granny get to see you at the Grammy’s, get a call from your family that your grandma passed
Then you know what you promised her
So you stay hot as a, thermometer, dipped in lava
So proud to be part of a, conglomerate, like this

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah

[Bridge: Cee-Lo]
Every time that they play this
Put your hands up high if
You're happy you made it
It's bittersweet when I say it
But since I'm alive, might as well celebrate

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
What a success story, when the film plays it gets less gory
My son didn’t know who his pop was for years, now it's less Maury
God put it there as a test for me
Used to walk around with the vest and 40
Cops tryna mess hall me
Now babes with the 34F’s adore me
I took the rock and a hard place and made the best orgy
Now the fans approach, I get paranoid
Where I’m from, they tell me never let your guard rest
But it’s simple to disregard stress
Hoes run to the bone and it ain’t farfetched

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
Now jets fly high shit
That Panamera Porsche that’s Ryan’s fly whip
As a kid I was poor, playing tag, now I’m it!
For those of yall that don’t remember me
I’m a Detroit Oak Parker
Went from no office to offers
I told ya’ll I would get my daddy out the post office
And so far I don’t really need to own my city
Just as long as the D is on my fitted
My sons and my daughter and my wife is along for the ride
This is the motherfucking life

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah
