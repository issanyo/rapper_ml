[Verse]
Ah, Yeah, I feel good as a motherfucker
I came up I'm still hood as a motherfucker
Said I wouldn't make it, I'm kickin'
And your baby mama wanna get naked and let me take it
I should, I'm a motherfucker
Uh, I'm in a place niggas pray to be
Mercedes-B S63 AMG
I call my mama on cell, I'm like, ask me
You raise the G, I owe you everything A to Z
From Amos to Zachariah you ride biblical
Pray that your son will survive and not die criminal
I got it all from you, my high spiritude
Thankful for the little things while others desire miracles
Worked like a slave, to get what a king got
I'm 'bout to drop industry giants with one sling shot
Until the time run out on my G shock
'Til I'm walking with God like Enoch I'mma let the beat rock
When I'm on my death bed, I'mma wreck rhymes
'Til the machines beeping my vital signs, flat line
Long as I live as a real nigga, that's fine
Some people got loftier goals, well that's mine
Yeah, we barge in Vegas, party in Miami
Rock stages in New York, me and my fucking family
Spit on Eminem's album, I almost won a Grammy
Plus it got me panty, so that song was a double whammy
For you to understand me, you gotta look it where I took it
I got artist sayin', I'm finna pull a Crooked
That's when an underground rapper don't blow up over night
But he's in it for the fight, duck his head, throw the right
I was sluggin' in the ring, blood dripping out of my mouth
'Til I knocked failure down for the count
And now I can inspire you
I can finally shit on my nay sayers
But I out grew the desire to
Yeah, I out grew the desire to
Calms in her rail, I think I'll hire you

[Outro]
Yeah, come work for a nigga man
It's gonna be all good tho
Straight up dog, to be in this position
I feel good as a motherfucker
I feel good as a motherfucker
For real man
Nigga grew up fucked up ,you know homeless, sleeping in the park
Not knowing where my next meal coming from
I mean, walking inside a fucking grocery store stealing dinner
Running trucks into the front windows of pawn shops
Stealing everything they had in that motherfucker you know
Everybody got a story
You probably heard this one before but you know
I could only be though y'know
I can't tell nobody else story to entertain niggas
I just got to be me
I can,I can call my mama right now nigga
And she be sayin'
I need this, I need that
And I can give it to her my nigga
That feel good to me
Cause I came a long fucking way
Came a long way
I'm just keeping in for it with you niggas out there
I feel good as a motherfucker
