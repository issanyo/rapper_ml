I heard you want me to give it up, bitch you crazy
Grind til I make it, no if’s or maybe's
If a motherfucker really want me stop
You better make me, make me, make me
All black tints on the black Mercedes
Ride around town with my shit off safety
Last thing you wanna hear is this thing pop
You gonna make me, make me, don’t make me

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Why I still rap my nigga cause I'm the truth
The way I spit I had to make the booth fireproof
Why I still rap my nigga cause I'm the truth
The way I spit I had to make the booth fireproof
Why I still rap my nigga cause I'm the truth
The way I spit I had to make the booth fireproof
Riding on the train when I couldn't buy a coupe
I was inspired by Cube, just like I admired Snoop
Digging in the crates I'm just tryin' to find a loop
Then I rhyme over your head like I'm trying to design a roof
You only get one shot, I'm the type to shoot
No disrespect to LeBron but Kobe gon' find the hoop
I'mma do it, my homie say wassup, nigga listen
I ain't dissing but this is constructive criticism
You been rapping all your life my nigga
I think it's time to drop the mic my nigga
I ain't wanna knock advice
So every time I spit a hot a capella on stage
I drop the mic my nigga
See I'm out on boxing life
And I won't throw in the towel
And stop the fight, not tonight, nigga

All black tints on the black Mercedes

Last thing you wanna hear is this thing pop
You gonna make me, make me, don’t make me

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Ain't no quitter in me
Bullshitter in me
Forfeiter in me if I'm chasing more Benjies
Please don't condemn me, it's the poor nigga in me
Waging a war against pennies
If I get it from sinning, may the Lord forgive me
So much game in the hood I'm absorbing plenty
From OG's. As I reach in I pour some in Henny
In a cup, It's Pac and Eminem
It's against all odds. And I don't give a fuck man
I don't give a fuck
Yeah that's what's up
I slap hands with Hov
I gave dap to Puff
I got game from Russel, I think that's enough
Motivation. to never let success pass me up
Master P told me, keep both feet in the game
Inspiration came from too many people to name
Now that I'm up yeah I got to keep it the same
I gave new rappers a brand new meaning for game
