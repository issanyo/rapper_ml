[Intro]
What's up Hip Hop?
It's ya boy, Crooked I
I’ve just been like
I’ve been thinking about this music shit
A whole lot
All this fake-ass niggas man
They always talk about the money, cars and clothes
But they will never talk about you know being broke
If he was born rich how you so hood nigga? you ain't hood nigga
Fake ass mothafucka
In None We Trust EP – The Prelude December 13
Y'all know what it is hah, C.O.B. nigga
Yo, shouts out to Mack Maine from YMCMB
Hell niggas down and live in Miami

[Verse 1]
I’m off that match box 20, I need to hit the jackpot
I’m broke so I’m low enough to black block semi
Taking back shots of Henny, cause that’s my remedy
I’m wondering how much money we robbing a crack spot give me
If they only [?] and cues, kicking the door and they start squeezing tools
Next time you’ll see me on TV will be the news
Rapper found slain for the past people choose
Mom seem to blues and nobody wouldn’t give a fuck
Excess wait for the word to nip and tuck
Man I start thinking crazy when I’m the rut
I know I come from seamen and I’m still a nut
Welcome to the inferno, when a gun start touching you kids like Sandusky
Look the other way like Paterno
Ain’t writing rhymes but I’m writing in my journal
Letters to god but I don’t know if he concern them
They say hell waiting on the sinner
All my life feel like Satan hating on a nigga
No paddle travel up a defecating river
Shits creek, shit’s weak, ..praying on my level
Tracking the vicious cycle, this is life
But my life is my biggest rival
Shit is try but I can’t pick a different life
So grip a mic, tell you what go a nigga psycho
Tell the world, it ain’t nothing you can do with me
I call you no class-ass niggas truancy
I came out of ugly situations beautifully
I built a house out of bricks, haters through with me
I’m from the beach city bitch

[Hook]
Beach-Beach City bitch, Beach City bitch
Beach-Beach City bitch, Beach City bitch
Beach-Beach City bitch, Beach City bitch
Beach-Beach City bitch, Beach City bitch

[Bridge]
Now work the pole
Strip to some real shit, you shoe model
Ya naked, modelling shoes
Got that one from my nigga, Jazzy [?]
BITCH! Sssutt Sssutt and all that
Ok, bye!

[Hook]
