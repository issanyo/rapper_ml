[Verse 1 - Sir Aah]
And the beat rocks on
She ain't had a feeling like this
In so long. She never had a love
So strong. Other dudes came, but
They did her so wrong. But they gone
I'm finna get on, and when I get on
I'mma give her my all. "Sir Aah!"
I wonder what she moan for
Don't swim, but I can do the breast crawl
Let's go, I'm thinking about Carribbean
And my money long like hair that's Indian
Slum dog, about to make a Bentley and
The beats rock on, I know you be feeling it
Come hit me and she got a big wardrobe
Suitcases, she got em by the boatload
Bootleg, she got em on the low and the
Beats rock on in the home of the go-go

[Hook]
And the beat rocks on
Get fucked with your Reeboks on
And the beat rocks on
She ain't had a feeling like this in so long
The beat rocks on
Cause she never had a man that's so strong

[Verse 2 - Royce da 5'9'']
And the beat rocks on
You couldn't walk in my shoes
With 3 socks on. Ha!
Sitting on grain, getting my treetop on
Fully-loading pistol whistling like a teapot
Uh! No T's on it if ?
I'm giving orders like I'm hanging
In the drive-thru, you know how I do
I'm like a Moonwalking Mike Jackson
I'm entertaining when I slide through
I keep the iron where my waist at
I keep my eye ? on the face tag
Trying to fine rhymes is like trying
To find hair from the top of the head of
A giant in a haystack. Shallow grave
Body placemat. You draw that, I'll erase that
It's called "My Bach" not "Maybach"
A lot of niggas be wyling, but mama they wack

[Hook]
And the beat rocks on
Get fucked with your Reeboks on
And the beat rocks on
She ain't had a feeling like this in so long
The beat rocks on
Cause she never had a man that's so strong

[Verse 3 - Crooked I]
Short hair, don't care. Platinum Patron
The cologne I'm gonna wear
And I'm walking on air, oh
There she go over there, so rare
Oh yeah, a dude gonna stare. No she
Can't hide under that high hat
Her face fine, and her waistline
Is the bassline. She'll be gone
In 3 1/2 minutes when I finish
So I won't waste time, give her
16 straight lines. Comments? I got em
I'll write her poetry if she let me
Feel that 808 bottom
Bending it over, now getting it on
Is that a snare? Or is her bed hitting the wall?
Go live and her nigga's gonna call
Surround sound speakers? Yeah, I'm blaming y'all
Baby don't scream when I'm deep up in it
Her heart beating at 113 beats per minute

[Hook]
And the beat rocks on
Get fucked with your Reeboks on
And the beat rocks on
She ain't had a feeling like this in so long
The beat rocks on
Cause she never had a man that's so strong
