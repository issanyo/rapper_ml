[Intro: Tech N9ne]
This one uhh, is from a song I did with Crooked I
Called Blammers and Burners
It's dope as hell, his verse was killer too
I wish I had his verse
But I'm 'bout to play these acapellas for you while I beast
Check this out man, check it out

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Molotov an' I'm offin' 'em in a coffin for the double crossin'
We toss em off in the mossy talkin' boss when he solvin' 'em
We causin' problem after problem we got 'em
Put them at the bottom in the sodom column we fraud 'em we shot 'em
Is anybody listenin', I'm on a mission to dig his ditch 'n
Picture many christening with the pistol 'n poppin
The second I'm 'bout to cock it
Get ready for the rocket then it's off with his head
He running off with the mouth then he dead
Straight raw with it, I'mma get saw with it
Rip a little snitch when he drippin' now bitch crawl in it
Tattle-tale and you got the whole hood shook
Tell the people we evil that the whole hood cook, that is no good look
The penalty for the pussy that put us in
Penitentiaries, rolled, shook, whooped
His motherfuckin' ass for givin' Po's good crooks
We put'em in a section where there was no good books
Understandable why your body is flammable
Handle your famo with ammo nigga animaly cannibal
Man oh man I'mma damage every stran' of botanicals
With Barry Manilow playin' man my hand is mechanical
Stuck repeatedly heated me and serviced 'n cheated me
So he bleeded immediately depleted me deity
Creepy I'm feeling deeply when I'm speaking of sleeping
The recently deceased peeps, he defeated so easily
Hush when you're rollin through KC-MO
Better bust or they gonna lose their people
Nigga killa city we hella for real and gritty
Itty bitty you shitty we let the stray heat go
Anybody trying get over can never see us
Put your money over your mouth or get beat up
Bloody murder we got it comin through your speakers
Tecca N9na with Crooked I busting niggas and we just *Explosion*
