[Verse 1]
(Go In)
I send a 100 pounds out of town, still I rep the west turf
I'm about to make my whole coast put on a fresh shirt
Hustler music, export expert
If I walk away with more than you, I did the leg work
Bread thirst, I ain't thinkin' of nothin' else
Hi hater, vibrator, fuck ya' self
My paper, skyscraper, you're just a elf
5 acres, white neighbours, (OK Bye)
I like my music bangin' out of control
To all my strippers swingin' 'round on that pole
(Let's get it)
Yeah, leanin' in my Benz Coupe
Yeah, I think your bitch cute
Take her out them gym shoes
Put her in some sick boots
Blow money, spend loot
Louis V her swimsuit
Hump her and her friends too
Dump her when the rent's due
You know how us pimps do
Diamonds blind your chick's view
Icy like a igloo
Ask your wifey, it's true
Way before them Slaughterhouse boys was with Eminem
Had to get that worked out, I ain't talkin' in the gym

[Hook]
Pocket full of money
P-Pocket full of money
Pocket full of money
(Still I need more)
I got a pocket full of money
P-Pocket full of money
Pocket full of money
(Still I need more)

[Verse 2]
Bag the product up, then we seal it with the vacuum
Cost me a 100 racks, but it's coming back soon
Do it for a living, on the side sling these rap tunes
Cause I'm stil the shit, (Y-Y-Y'all), welcome to my bathroom
I'mma play the stylist, sewing up the block
Give photographers the money shot, focus on my guap
It's a photoshoot, baby hold this coconut Ciroc
(And then)pour it on the rocks
(And then) open up your box
Cash Over Bitches, that's what my niggas say
My chicks say it's Monday, Money Over Niggas Day
I can't even sleep, gotta grind, man I've been this way
All about my business (aayyy)
(Let's get it)

[Hook]
Pocket full of money
P-Pocket full of money
Pocket full of money
(Still I need more)
I got a pocket full of money
P-Pocket full of money
Pocket full of money
(Still I need more)

[Bridge]
Now lean left with it, lean right with it
Lean left with it, lean right with it
Lean left with it,(aayyy) lean right with it(aayyy)
Lean left with it,lean right with it

[Verse 3]
Ayo, on the road to wealth, you ain't got no suckas with you
Note to self: "Crooked they ain't fuckin' with you"
Some real shit I remember to remember
If I'm gone 'til November
Bet I'll binge in December
Outta state plates, niggas put Virginia on the fender
Heavy weights on my agenda, don't pretend you a contender
And I ain't on tour yet, get it to your door step
Need a 100 more, bet I need another Corvette

[Hook]
Pocket full of money
P-Pocket full of money
Pocket full of money
(Still I need more)
I got a pocket full of money
P-Pocket full of money
Pocket full of money
(Still I need more)
