I see 'em tryna shine like Tech
'Cause I shine like I be grindin' on the set, d-d-diamonds on my neck
Most talked about when I hit that strip, watch it bounce when I hit that dip
Come too close, might get that clip, click bang
Don't trip, Tech don't slip, let's up the road, go get my bitch
Get my grip, talk my shit, hit my switch and dip
Switchin' lanes on them Dana-Danes, same color as that candy paint
Tangerine, wit' metal plates...
I tried to tell you never sober, chalupa, longer than a roller coaster
Out here a hub a head a do-ya, for a quarter ounce of yola
Venomous snakes, like some cobras
Up top is where I'm from, we lettin' out nuts hang over our shoulders
Figure-8 and goin' dumb
Drivin' wit' all four doors open, gassin' and brakin' and yokin'
We hyphy, we stupid, Vallejo, Richmond, 'Frisco, Oakland
We 'Niners, we Raiders, we some hustlas and some playas
We got '64's and low-low's, but most of us ridin' scrapers
Please Lord forgive me, it's in me to toke Semi's
Grope Penny and Remy, my pockets was so skinny
Now I blow pennies on four Hemi's
Run the whole city, hoes, I put dough before any
My 6th sense helped me view better cheddar kid
I f*cks more hoes than Hugh Hefner ever did
That new leather shit, the coupe hella sick
Dude move ahead of whoever 'cause dude never quit

Cranberry Impala, that's my lowrider
Slide by ya, North sider, rider wit' a hoe driver
G'd up, from the feet up, plus the heat tough
Toe game, crack the Grey Goose, and spark the weed up
When I'm in L.A., I go in Crenshaw and floss a little
Slot a lot thang and them Black Wall Street
Double-U and P and C-P-T, we keepin' it G
In our lowriders, riders, riders
We put them cracks up on the wall, cucarachas crawl
I keep my head up and it won't fall, no not at all
I'll break yo' jaw like I break the law, leave you all in all
And the ride is so clean, you won't know what you saw
I sit low with a tall can, in a brown bag
With a brown rag, bouncin' a brown rag
Wit' the Mexican flag and the American flag
Hittin' the fronts and the backs, watchin' out for the badge
Home boy, Big T, better known as Tyrone
Is the first person I ever seen wit' a Chevy on chrome
My partner got it, bought the slab, wine berry over gold
With screens in the head rests, just to let you know we holdin'
I fell in love wit' it, and I dropped off some cash
Now that's me you see, flippin' slab, ridin' on glass
How much it cost? Don't ask, baby just know this
I could've bout a Benz instead wit' the money I spent

My '64 sittin' on that chrome, chrome Glock sittin' on my lap
Three hoes ridin' in the back, candy paint, nigga f*ck with that
Three-wheel motion I'm sittin' high, Daytona's that's all we ride
Hit that switch it's do or die, ride on me, that's suicide
I be in the hood smokin' that green, Dr. Dre know what I mean
Swisha Sweet and them purple leaves, California, we got that weed
Black diamonds off in my chain, ask around niggas know my name
Compton's own, the rap LeBron James, ridin' low, I'm switchin' lanes
Make that brain splat, 30 thang-thang clap
Known for the game rap, wit' the chrome frame wrap
From Harley-Davidson's to low-low's, we do tip 'em
13-hundred spokes wit' that blue nipple, get the picture
Disrespect, I'ma draw slugs
But ain't no set trippin' 'cause nigga it's all love
Dub-C drop the real on 'em, Chevy chrome grill on 'em
Posin' in the intersection, three-wheelin' on 'em nigga
Raspberry '64 bring your cherry, and
We can make a Sunday, come home Monday
I'm sittin' on the one-way, up on the boulevard
Act hard, put yo' thoughts on the dashboard
'Cause if I come through wit' the little homie
Nobody better f*ck wit' the little homie
I hope Compton unite, South Central unite
I hope my chrome, dance wit' the moonlight
