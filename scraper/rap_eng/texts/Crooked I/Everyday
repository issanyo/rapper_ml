How many times I gotta tell you niggas?
I'm not like you!

[Verse 1]
I ain't never love a cop, they some arrogant devils
Wanna bury me since birth, gave my parents a shovel
Real niggas don't die, So they scared of the ghetto
What's a puppet compared to Geppetto (hello)
And you Uncle Tom niggas you nowhere on my level
Rather talk to baby girl over there in the yellow
I'mma tell her get naked but she can wear the stilettos
Got a round jiggly ass but I ain't sharing my Jell-O
It's an alien abduction, Put her in my spaceship
Demeanour of a boss, I ain't gotta say shit
I just wanna make it
Get my new bitch a pair of Sarah Palin fake tits (you hear me?)
I'm a Long Beach nigga, riding down Crenshaw
Read my bumper sticker it say fuck Rush Limbaugh
Got hood credit, the streets is my co-signer
I talk shit like Mel Gibson, my ghostwriter

[Hook]
I'm in the streets, tell me where you at
Put a hundred killers in front of you, I could do that
Me and you ain't the same, but you knew that
If you don't give a fuck, throw your middle finger up
Real niggas fuck with real niggas, everyday
Live niggas fuck with live niggas, everyday
Real bitches fuck with real bitches, everyday
Live bitches fuck with live bitches, everyday

[Verse 2]
It's just me against the world, soldier on the mainline
How can I be militant and ignorant at the same time
I love liquor but I hate swine
Blame it on the complexities of a great mind
I think I'm stuck somewhere in between Malcolm X and Detroit Red
Still chasing after d-boy bread
And I'm hardcore
Lay a snitch flatter than that cardboard
Sitting underneath the spinning d-boy's head
I keep a Glock, I be telling degenerates
It'll eat you pussies quick as Ellen DeGeneres
I mix drinks like a hell of a chemistist
If you a bitch nigga, you forever my nemesis
Killing youths on my itinerary
Shouts out to Bun B and Chamillitary
I'm a Nas Illmatic nigga, Jay Blueprint nigga
Curtis Jackson with an opinion 52 cent nigga

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I don't live like you, I don't think like you do
Mother fuckers say I'm crazy
See I grew up in the hood where the cops try to kill a dude
Ever since I was a baby
And on top of all that these gangbang niggas tripping too
I kept a loaded 380
They tried to brainwash me with the curriculum in high school
I never let them fools play me
C.O.B. I got a religious career
It's the Van Gogh flow, nigga lend me your ear
Ain't no rally for the feminists, the women are here
Pull your cock out quit living in fear
Probably see a nigga chilling with a porn star
Use her like the all star... in my 4 car
In other words I only call her when I need help
Give me brains while I buckle up my seatbelt
That's when she told me she was Glen Beck's daughter
Said she couldn't take a molested incest father
Get it off your chest bench press harder
I gave her a new name called her Princess slaughter
Her dad's the devil, she a hottie still
Made a mandingo like the way the human body feel
Quick question, who embodies skills
If you don't buy my shit I bet the Illuminati will nigga

[Hook]
