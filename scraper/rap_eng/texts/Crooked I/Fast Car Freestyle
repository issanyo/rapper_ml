[Hook: Tracy Chapman]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Started from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove

[Verse: Crooked I]
Ridin' on a bus
A nigga broke
I wish I was invisible;
I need a cloak
Everybody staring, feeling eyes from afar
Even if they ain't man I still think they are
Lookin' for them jobs, a hundred in a week
Couldn't find one now I'm on government relief
Told the caseworker, "man I'm living in a rat trap"
And everything I fuckin' own is right here in this backpack
Lemme backtrack
See I dropped out of school early, tried to make the chronic weed sack crack
Customers ride up, money divide up
I helped my mama pay some bills, then my hustle dried up
Fuck
At least a nigga saw some "C" notes
Didn't get caught, cops shipped me to Los Padrinos
Mama left town, I didn't wanna go
So I stayed in the beach sleeping on my homey's floor
Had my shoes stacked next to me
Had a Smith and Wesson .38 revolver for the east siders testing me
I had a little flow but I didn't know
A mad few knows to help a child with his destiny
So it was left to me, had to do it all
Homelessness, hunger, I went through it all
I need inspiration, I'm walking to the mall
I stole CD's man, it's time to evolve
Hard times, when you're gone I'mma miss you
I can't wait 'til spending money's not an issue
The train stops by the Benz dealership
And I be talking to them cars like, "yeah I'mma get you"
Dreaming 'bout a fast car while the train's racin'
The cops woke me up at the PCA station
Asked for my ticket
Damn that dream was vivid
Fuck you bring me back to this whack situation?
Back to reality, no salary
Pockets low calorie
Fuck
Can't live my whole life like this and suffer losses
That's when it hit me: Circle of fuckin' Bosses
Fast forward to now
We went downtown to the fashion district and just bought us another office
Not enough time to tell the whole story
But the gist of the shit's "No nuts, no glory"
Plus, I'm using music as a find art
Yeah, the fine's with a "D" cause it's hard to find art
And yours? I put my heart in every line
Wanna stop Crooked's heart, rip his notebook apart
Peace

[Hook]

[Outro: Crooked I]
If I can do it, you can do it
And I'd do it again
