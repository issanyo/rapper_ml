Ssuutt Ssuutt! [4x]

[Hook: Brevi]
We ain’t afraid of gettin' dirty 'round here
Hand in the sand middle finger in the air
Anticipate when the rain gon' come
Dancin' on your grave, covered in the ssuutt
Covered in the ssuutt [3x]
Dancin' on your grave, covered in ya mud

[Verse: Crooked I]
Put a deuce up, when Crooked cruise up
I pull a coupe up, bullet-proofed up
You bullies tool up, fully fool what?
I’ve been on California corners
Longer than the bottom of a hooker's shoe
I fuck a dude up!
I’m so proper with the chrome chopper
And if my hand gun is horny, don’t think I won’t cock her
Cock-a-roaches better phone coppers
If I get shot I call my own doctors, a stone cold COBster
You niggas playin' with this G shit
It’s different levels of this street shit, automatic king spit
Maggots picked the wrong one to beef with and
Perez Hilton won’t be the only faggot in deep shit!
The ratchet hit ya like a Packer tacklin' Steve Smith
Or leave the clapper and get it crack-a-lackin' with these fists
Peep this, got chronic clouds for your weed spliff
My street team pushin' more loud than Steve Riff
Biggie died when they laid son to rest
Just like the industry blamed us labels running from the west
I decided to invest street money and it brought success
I was thinking 'Fuck execs' 'til them fuckers cut the checks!
So, what does the shit mean?
It means I risk doing 16 to bring you these 16’s
I grew up with, niggas who threw up shit
Gangbangers, hustlers, all I used to fuck with
Charcoal Murcielago, parked-o, at the Wilshire Margot, arco
Hoes gas me up, way faster than the car go
Bitches yell, 'Mr. Wells Fargo', he's rich as hell
Let the cigar blow! I don’t tip 'em well
Crooked is different, he tipped the Richter scale
I’m a earthquake, I’m the best ever in the first place
Unless June sixteenth is your birth date

[Hook: Brevi]
We ain’t afraid of gettin' dirty 'round here
Hand in the sand middle finger in the air
Anticipate when the rain gon' come
Dancin' on your grave, covered in the ssuutt
Covered in the ssuutt [3x]
Dancin' on your grave, covered in the mud
