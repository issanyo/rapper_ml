[Ashanti]
I remember feelin like this...

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin...
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin...

[Ashanti]
I got the jomes forming in my bones (From a man)
Who indeed took over my soul (Understand)
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (He would leave)
Get on my knees, til they're bloody red (Baby please)
See I don't know if you get it yet (Just don't know)
He's like the lighter to my cigarette (Watch me smoke)
I never knew another human life (Didn't know)
Who got the power to take over mine, so baby, baby

[Crooked I]
Yo, I love my R&B piece man
She be in the shower singin "Chaka Khan Sweet Thang"
But I'm on the block, gutter thuggin where the G's hang
Cuz all of my father figures came from a street gang
It's Crooked I, ridin wit me more
She top notch, dog a Bentley Azure
She keep her body covered in Christian Dior (Wow)
Plus she's ready to ride wit me in war
Who can ask for more? Me and my...

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin...
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin...

[Ashanti]
See I can never feel alone with you (In my life)
I'll give up everything I own for you (Won't think twice)
Almost a shame how I'm mesmerised (Such a shame)
I lose my thought lookin in your eyes (I know, I)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver (And that's real)
And when you touch me my whole body shivers (I can feel)
Now I can see how another life (Another life)
Could the power to take over mine (Cuz your my)

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin...
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin...

[Ashanti] (Crooked I)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(You wit the I, we gon ride til we die ya know)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Yeah with you by my side we always gon survive fo'-sho')
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Yo, yo lets get this money huh, let's get this paper right)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Whenever it's the ROW and Murder Inc it's a done deal when we link)

[Crooked I] (Ashanti)
And tell me, who could ever picture
That me and you would be together forever
I'm a gangsta, they said I'd never get ya (Baby)
I'm runnin the turf, you want me comin to church
How can I come, when I know I keep a gun under my shirt?
I love the street life, But that there love is a curse
And when I think about livin' without you
(Baby, I love you) Nothin is worse
I got my lil' mommaz back, it's more than just hoppin' in the sack
I guess opposites attract, you my...

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin...

[Ashanti] (Crooked I)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(You wit the I, we gon' ride 'til we die ya know)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Yeah wit you by my side we gon' always survive fo'-sho')
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Yo, yo lets get this money huh, let's get this paper right)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Whenever it's the ROW and Murder Inc it's a done deal when we link)

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin...
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
