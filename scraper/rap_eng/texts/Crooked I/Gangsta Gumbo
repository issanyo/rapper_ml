[Intro: Brainiac]
What up?
Brainiac, nigga
Off this Jim Gittum "Gangsta Gumbo"
Dynasty, bitch!
The hardest nigga in the booth, nigga
He go by the name of Crooked-motherfucking-I
And he's so Treacherous

[Verse: Crooked I]
So many niggas wanna come at the Crooked and let a couple of shots
Spin me around like I’m a featherweight, knowing that I’m heavyweight
My Smith & Wesson weapon will make you elevate and levitate
When I regulate I hit the streets like I never ate
I click heat and I never wait, I wouldn’t hesitate
To strap a time bomb to myself and hug you until it detonates
You’re 6 feet, I’m 11'8'‘
And if I told you once, I told you twice
I hold the guns, I’m so precise (so run nigga run)
When the soldier come, I’m cold as ice
So hold your tongue or roll the dice (you’re done when I come)
I’m a poltergeist, send them the venom quick as a cobra strikes
Kill 'em and kill 'em again
The shots stole your life, you should’ve known the price
A killer that holds the knife to your throat and slice
And when I’m creepin’ by, dippin' the ‘Lac
Nigga the reason I’m rippin’ the gat is to go BRRAT BRRAT
And your people die, nigga, blink your eyes
I'll put you on your back quicker than that
Somebody tell me what's sicker than that
You coward niggas need to get rid of that ridiculous act
When I give you the Mack, It's ripping your back
Like Dominique Dawes, you gonna be flipping no different than that
Then we acting reckless, snatch your necklace, ratchet death wish
Eat your ass for breakfast when you bastards mess with
The master that'll blast ya ass with
Any hand selected, cause the man is ambidextrous
Still keep a pump with me
For any punk motherfucker that wanna fuck with me
Still get slumped uncomfortably and touch the streets
So fuck police, I dump the heat
So what you got props in a magazine
You think your better than me, don't you nigga?
I see you try to freestyle on the TV screen
You think your better than me, don't you nigga?
I put holes in your floor like it ain't nothing
You think your better than me, don't you nigga?
You better duck and run, you better tuck your gun
Cause on the mic I murder niggas for fun
(Murder niggas for fun...)
