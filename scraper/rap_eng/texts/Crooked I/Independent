[Intro]
Now.. I can match ya
Put the paper in the paperwork [3x]

[Hook]
We independent homie
We independent boy
We independent shawty
We independent boy
We independent baby, them independent boys
Still buy expensive toys, we self employed
And they might own you, but they don't own me though
And they probably own you, nobody owns me though
And they might own you, but they don't own me though
And they probably own you, nobody owns me though

[Verse 1]
They wanna see a boss in the sewer, crawl through manure
But they can't stop a hood entrepreneur
I'm somethin' like Cody, I'm a monster for sure
The flow is raw blow man, the product is pure
I'm certified when I'm reppin', I'm not you
Gettin' 35's in a record, I come through
And that's birth shinin' every second, I gotta crew
And them skirts high, gettin' naked, so what it do?
We fuck a couple hoes, am I sweet at the Trump?
I cash checks every time I get your speakers to bump
I'm a B-O double S, why beef with a chump
The way the heater hit the geek, he might think it's a pump
Mad cause my wrist freeze like snow on skis
I put his ho on knees, then tell her go home please
I used to push kush just so you could blow on leaves
That's how I proved money did grow on trees

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Crooked I, everybody on the streets know me
Fresh Nikes with them ink slinger jeans on me
COB, and our membership is G's only
I paid dues, now it's time for me to eat homie
Keep my lawyers happy, you know what the biz is
Paper rape me, nah, that ain't the business
I was made for the streets like my rims is
He tried to play with my life, I gotta end his
I don't want nothin' much, just respect
A thug exec, a rough neck cut the check
I flex muscle on the net with a weekly freestyle
Spreadin' that hustle to the TV screen now
My rings are bling blow, I'm screamin out, C-O-B!
We ruthless, we makin' Eazy E proud (Wow)
Makin' all the real street OG's smile
I'm L-B-C's top D-O-G

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I said nigga, nobody owns me
Got a problem with that, guess where your bodys gon' be
In the dirt mighty goon, ain't nobody gon' see
Gotta bye bye you before you adios me
Got that ra-ra heater with the slugs when you hear that (Ay!)
C-O-B is in the club when you hear that (Ay!)
That mean we deep, give us love
We lookin' for some freaks we can rub, creep with a thug
Bring ya sexy ass to the L-B-C
When you ready jerk me on the next Tell CB
I be outside in that eggshell GT
Next rap star you fuck might as well be me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Treacherous is ballin', every time I see 'em they be throwin' up paper
That's the Circle of Bosses, straight independent but they still do it major
Treacherous is ballin', every time I see 'em they be throwin' up paper
That's the Circle of Bosses, straight independent but they still do it major
