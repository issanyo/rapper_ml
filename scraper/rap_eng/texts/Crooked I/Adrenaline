[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Adrenaline
Open up the vein get a bit insane better train
Jane to be shelling me in sentimental cellophane
Wrek is aimed higher than the heavens on a weather vane
Better stay ready man if you sleeping get a lane
(Wake up) Time to get a better brain
Fly over rooftops i don't need to shed a thang
Lighter than a feather when I fly cause I'm clever
But I still drop bombs like a military aero plane
This'll be epitome of energy get up
And get it physically or bleed for the remedy
I think it's gonna be a murder of the gimmicky
Silliest motherfuckers who been acting like they getting g's
Let the conquest go critics and cynics in it to bomb Wrek's flow
Millions of minutes we get them all left low
I been on that show with a Comcast soul
I'll connect you get your extra decks to lecture necks snapping the best of
People in Miami out over into the rest of the world wide sector

[Hook: Wrekonize]
I never felt this free before in all my freaking life
These inhibitions clearly need to cease to be denied
Cause you and I will ride until the sun is in our sights
I don't know how else to describe it but it's nice
When it's all up in my bloodstream (Bloodstream)
Deep inside my bloodstream (Bloodstream)
I can feel it in my bloodstream (Bloodstream)
It's been released into the bloodstream
Let's hope this kind of feeling never dies

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
(You can feel it in your veins, adrenaline)
Shake shack vibe with a payback line
Tell 'em to leave him be in the cave that's fine
Reclusive dude with loosey tunes a nuisance
All up in the business with an 8 track grind
I sat up with a boombox and threw thoughts
In Hollywood Miamis little version of the boondocks
We beat up on the trash cans and who thought
I'd take it the level we all know only a few rock
Better than the beef ends
Tell 'em to get packing with the backing of the defense
I wanna just see a sequence decent
These motherfuckers coming up to challenge us in sequins
I came to change the lame brains
Refrain the same game and stake the name claim
Let's see if they can get it with no credit overzealous
And they bet it all down on the fake estate fame

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
So many niggas wanna come at the Crooked and let a couple of shots
Spin me around like I’m a featherweight, not knowing that I’m heavyweight
Smith & Wesson weapon will make you elevate and levitate
When I regulate, I hit the streets like I never ate
I click heat and I never wait, I wouldn’t hesitate
To strap a time bomb to myself and hug you until it detonate
You’re 6 feet, I’m 11'8'‘
And if I told you once, I told you twice
I hold the guns, I’m so precise, so run, nigga, run
When the soldier come, I’m cold as ice
So hold your tongue or roll the dice, you’re done when I come
I’m a poltergeist, I’m givin’ ‘em rhythm quick as a cobra strikes
Kill 'em and kill 'em again
The shots stole your life, you should’ve known the price
Killer that holds the knife to your throat and slice
And when I’m creepin’ by, I'm dippin' the ‘Lac
Homie the reason I’m, rippin’ the gat is to go "BRRAT, BRRAT"
Then your people die, nigga, blink your eye
I'll put you on your back quicker than that, uh
