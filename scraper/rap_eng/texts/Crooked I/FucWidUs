Up against the West Coast Nigga that squeezed the most triggas
And Fucked the most Bitches and touched the most riches
The four is on switches, the Benzes is so vicious
We stay ghetto for life...MY Nigga
Crooked Ain't Real? You Confusing me my Nigga
How you double cross me? You used to be my Nigga
Niggas cry rivers, soon as we fly triggas, Five hit you, that's how lead
Poison travel inside livers
Tie you to a bumper, drag you by your adam's apple
And laugh as your skin unravels as you travel across gravel
So Why You Wanna Fuck Wit Me? I keep a Ak, a P-90 and Desert E
I pop up quick, Be where you thought I never Be
From outta nowhere I giver your Coogi sweater three
