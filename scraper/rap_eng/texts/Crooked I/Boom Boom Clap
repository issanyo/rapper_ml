[Intro]
Yeah, this is for gangsters only
The dance floor's packed and them thangs is on me
These cats wanna hate cause they dames is on me
We strapped in the club, so it's dangerous, homie
(Boom boom clap, clap, boom clap)

[Verse 1]
This is Dodger Music, this the new blue hat
This the bulletproof coupe with the moon roof back
With the deuce deuce strap, this is new school crack
(Boom boom clap, clap, boom clap)
Make way for young boss, dude move back
Cause dude pack enough heat to remove two Shaqs
Keep his quarters and Jimmy Choo shoes, now who's back
Dynasty for life, y'all know what's good
Middle finger's how we throw up our hood
Bone crushers ready, eating wimps for dinner
Them bullets is blood suckers like a ten percenter
Man, Crooked bomb first boy, please do not this
Nine years later, I'm still on some Pac ish
Got my own label, let's pop Cris'
I'm feeling like Dre at the Vibe Awards, can't nobody stop this

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm two stepping with your freak, yo
We in the club twenty deep, yo
Everybody on the streets know
Beef with us homie my heat go (Boom boom clap, clap boom clap)

[Interlude]
Yeah, pay your rent girl
Drop down to the ground, pay your rent girl
Do the freak to the beat, pay your rent girl
Lap dance that man, pay your rent girl

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Long Beach got nothing to hide
East side, 5-6-2, I say it with pride
Chicks see the C-N-S and they get inside
I use my cars to get broads, I pimp my ride
Nigga, black Mercedes packed with ladies
Half they crazy asses is asking to have my baby
Rappers lately acting shady, have me clap three eighties
You backwards cats amaze me
Nope, I don't feel you fags
Money in the safe but I gotta fill new bags
I don't feel too bad, got beef? Holla
I'll put money on your head like a dollar bill doo-rag

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I don't need no ex, still getting more sex
Hit it, then I let the Horseshoe Gang go next
Still sipping Moet, still hitting your ex
Still got diamonds in that Bill Clinton Rolex
How you living? Is that really your crib?
I got rich, never sat on Rap City with Tig
Actually, you dig, I'll mac milli your wig
I'm black William Bonnie, that's Billy the Kid
I keep clips like them Virginia boys
First you get money man, then you score
I'm waiting for a bad chick to walk in the door
With a body like Kenya Moore, I get in ya more

[Hook]
