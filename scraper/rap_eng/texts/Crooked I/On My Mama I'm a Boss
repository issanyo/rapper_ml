[Hook]
Imma rock that ice, I put that on my mama
Imma shine like lights, I put that on my mama
Imma ride big wheels, I put that on my mama
Imma count dollar bills, I put that on my mama
Imma boss

[Verse: 1]
I know you thinking you're getting cash without Crooked I
I think you rappers need to ask about Crooked I
I'm in the Aston Martin smashing out laughing while niggas cry
Ice mixed with platinum how sick am I?
I let the watch bling bloaw it ain't playin' wit cha
Now that's the way you freeze time without taking pictures
What up baby? Yeah you got the right shape system
Now you need a boss about his change like a shape shifter
I hit you strip club freak with them racks
Throwing dough up in the air like I'm making pizza from scratch
That's why them gold diggers want a piece of my scraps
Got no cheese for you rats baby these are the facts
Crooked is hood money chasing industry paper
If you don't know the biz go listen to vapers
I keep an extra fly bitch in the scraper
Sharpton and Jesse hate me fuck it this is for gangsters

[Hook]
Imma rock that ice, I put that on my mama
Imma shine like lights, I put that on my mama
Imma ride big wheels, I put that on my mama
Imma count dollar bills, I put that on my mama
Imma boss


[Verse: 2]
Boss, a two seater when you see me come
I floss, these freaks must be thinking he's the one
You loud mouths 'bout to see the gun
Then become silent like the "B" in dumb just for bein' dumb
I caught the boys slick talkin' and it been on since
I'm from the LBC but I don't hang around no old pimps
Your old ass fell off, you need a pace maker
Your clothes didn't sell nah you ain't a taste maker
OK now let me hit you with some real talk
I'm pimping my ride before the price sticker gets peeled off
OK now if I say how much the wheels cost
You would say that I was a lil' off, Imma real boss
My flow is like liquid like I got too much fluid in the lungs
Nah screw it I'm just fluent with the tongue
Soon as I walk into the club the foolishness begun
My dude I'm street money son doing this for fun

[Hook]
Imma rock that ice, I put that on my mama
Imma shine like lights, I put that on my mama
Imma ride big wheels, I put that on my mama
Imma count dollar bills, I put that on my mama
Imma boss


[Verse: 3]
