It's game time, game time (game time)
I can't change my frame of mind, it's game time
I been at it jumping I got hang-time
Cause I'm a dude that can't lose the game mine
It's game time, game time (game time)
I can't change my frame of mind, it's game time
I been at it jumping I got hang-time
That's why I ball and go hard at the same time

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
It's game time but ain't no games getting played
Me going broke is like Michael Jordan getting braids
I do my thing, my chain frozen lemonade
The ice on my Breitling remind me of frozen Minute Maid
I still shine when I'm in the shade
I got a chef, a chauffer, a gopher, and a maid
And I don't like whats on the radio getting played
Or none of those videos thats getting made
I ain't trying to misbehave I'm trying to straighten up
So don't believe nothing that the media making up
I'm trying to get my paper up and ball like 2K
You're only good as your last game I came to play

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I'mma let the people know why I feel this way
I've got sons I got to feed I got bills to pay
Aye ain't go do what the game will do
But see I'm trying to maintain I've got things to do
And just to name a few of the moves I make
I ball and refuse to hate, I refuse to take a loss
I'm a boss so my schedule tight
But at least I ain't in the precinct getting read my rights
Life's short so I know that my time will come
That I'mma try to shine 'til my time is done
So come on, you got keep going keep improving
Slow motions better than no motion, keep it moving
