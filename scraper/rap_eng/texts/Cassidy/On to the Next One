[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey
I got a million ways to get it
Choose one
Ay, bring it back, bring it back
Now double your money and make a stack
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
(Hold up) Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey

[Verse 1: Chubby Jag]
Jag on some blessed shit, rookie out the West shit
Reckless, rolling with a East Coast vet
Larsiny, yes that's who I'm cutting cheques with
Cats act a fool and I'mma let the hex spit
Listen up, check this, he was on some next shit
I was doing drops on the blocks like Tetris
Shining nigga, E-Class, diamonds in my necklace
Courtesy of Cass, he got Jag in the net shit
I ain't talking web homes, I was talking jet shit
Room full of goons, man I ain't the one to eff with
Grimey and I'm cooking on some chef shit, got a bitch Nicki
Think she Minaj, I call her my bestest
Never had a Benz, never had a Lexus
First car was a Jag, I pass into sections
Yelling out niggas run this like I'm sexist
Jag is a beast get the message, nigga hit the exit

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I just signed a new deal, I had to get my shit straight
If you want the old Cass, buy my old mixtapes
Yeah I used to flip weight, I was trying to get cake
(??), small heads, paper with the big face
That's why I get face from chicks 'til they lips ache
Never fucked ya bitch, but she know how my dick taste
I ate of Swizz plate, but changed my direction
Now my chain so bright it could change my complexion
The game had me stressing, but now I'm an owner
I own my old company, cause man I'm a grown up
I used to get (??), standing on the corners
Now I'm in the booth with my hand on my cajones
My homie said my head bigger then ya man Homer
Exactly, but I'm not a sucker like Maggie
I play my part and get (d'oh) like Bart daddy
I know where the money at, I keep money coming back
