Got a thousand grams so I ride around with my chopper
Keep the dutch full of kush and keep a cup full of vodka
My closet got more sneaks than a foot locker
And every day I stuff my face with steak and lobsters
Got a kilo on my wrist bitch I’m cashin’ out
Got a kilo on my neck yes I’m cashin’ out
Got a thousand grams so I ride around with my chopper
Keep the dutch full of kush and keep a cup full of vodka

[Verse 1]
I’m high that’s why I be in my zone
Grams of that grand daddy I be getting stoned
This chick said damn, daddy why you never call my phone?
Don’t you kids got a damn daddy bitch leave me alone
I’m not tryna hear your problems, I’ve got problems of my own
Like mixing syrup with ciroc and mixing mollys with patron
If you fuck the first night then I might probably take you home
And if you swallowing the pipe then you could probly get a loan
You could owe me but you gotta blow me like a saxophone
’Cause you wasn’t with me rappin on that microphone
Bitch, you need a lot but you don’t think a lot
’Cause you drink a lot and smoke weed a lot
But I can tell you don’t read a lot
’Cause you’re talking stupid you need to stop
Just call me when you need the cock
And I’ll call you when I need to pop
I need the gwuap so I need a chick
That Don’t need shit she just need the dick
The weed get lit til' I'm passing out
Bitch I'm about to put another classic out
I’m spazzing out, I'm not a has been
I get the cash in then I’m cashin’ out

[Verse 2]
Louie’s got the grams but still we gotta heat ‘em
I’mma pill it if you say that I’mma deal your wrist watch
I’mma chill it, I’mma make you niggas feel it
If it’s lookin’, I’mma grill it, told you niggas I’mma kill it
Jag keep it real, chubby pocket swole up
The whole know as soon as we roll up
I’m like roll up, a ho hold up
Cuz these bitches out tonight, they know us
They lean on me, they, they called up
They stand around cuz we poured up
I’m turnt up like so what
Shit movin fast but I'm slowed up
She loose loose, fat'o thang like Bruce Bruce
Fuck nearly she assed out
Cuz we rackin’ up, Yup we cashed out
Chubby
