Did my time in a county jail just when
Just when things started goin' well
And I paid the price for the crimes I did
Wanna change my life, wanna raise my kids

I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood

I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?

I do the damn thing, bezel and the damn bling
Sling grams, spend 10 grand on a damn ring
I run Philly, I ain't tryin' to be the damn king
But the damn thing could get pulled like a hamstring

I used to hang with these niggas from my hood man
Yeah, I showed them the world, I took 'em out the hood man
Yeah, it cost some change but it's all good man
Cause I got money to burn like backwoods man

And we was smokin', jokin' and poppin' bottles
Gettin' open, strokin', pokin' and poppin' models
I was hopin', that they could get paper with me
But when I started gettin' cake they started hatin' on me

They showed up to the crib that my mother was at
My son, my baby mother and my brother was at
And they was strapped, actin' tough and started bustin' they gat
To protect my family I started bustin' it back

I'm an innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood

I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?

Jail vicious, it's hard to be patient and stay strong
When you get pictures of chicks half naked in they thongs
The anticipation be makin' the days long
I waited cause I just gotta make it like Trey Songz

My lawyers couldn't lose, they proved the D.A. wrong
I smiled at the trial, kept cool and stayed calm
I waved at my mom and swallowed my pride man
Them guys on the stand brought tears to my eyes man

The stuff they was discussin' was nothin' but lies man
They said I bust the chrome at homie that died man
I thought them lil' dudes was part of my squad man
'Til they started actin' up but they must've been high man

You see that I ain't shook from the look in my eyes man
But bein' booked was a blessin' in disguise man
I needed time to get my life organized man
So everythin' that happened was part of my God's plan, understand?

I'm an innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood

I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man
Just from the hood but the man is good, understood?

Involuntary manslaughter, just parole
I spanked the murder like a bad ass 6 year old
I knew that I was gon' be rich since I was 6 years old
Now I'm the richest rapper under 26 years old

So it's on now, I'm home now, it's a celebration
I got my drink and my 2 step cause I'm elevatin'
I'm gettin' hella cake and with the number 1 record
But I'll still bust my gun if you come test it

Change the life that I, that I live
Got me livin' fine, livin' negative
Need to leave the game that is destroyin' me
So I pray to God that He has mercy

I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man
I'm an innocent man
