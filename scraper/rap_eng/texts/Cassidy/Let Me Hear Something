I don't think nobody better than me in this whole world
I'm so thorough, I'm the hottest in this cold world
Oh shit I'm so sick I gotta go earl
And I be on some ho shit ask my old girl
If this was your world it wouldn't be no girls
Cause you only like men aight then go girl
You triflin pussy like and hermaphrodite
I'm straight like 6'oclock you not so pass the mic
It's a recession I copped my watch for half the price
But the ice still see-through like a glass of sprite
I'm a hustla, I had da white, but I had to quit, cause for bricks
They will lock you up for half your life, I'm the truth you ain't
Half as nice, I mean the source magazine gon prolly give you half a mic
When you die they might try bring you back to life
But if they not successful I'll catch you in the afterlife
Right, we all gotta die someday, one day we all gon be dead
Yeah one way or another all you motherfuckers gon pass away
That's why I live everday like it's my last day
I'm on the grind trynna get money the fast way
I'm on my job all the time I never had a half day
AR get cash cause he bag Yay, they move bags like the strash lay down halfway
I used to run with rock the dame dash way, but had to stop cause im on point
Like Steve Nash play, I'm a gorilla and I'm hotter than the sun, I'm a killer
My gun be shooting like Steve Nash J, run in your crib like Big, the scheme ass way
That big ass cape push your wig back halfway, I throw bullets like I'm pass play
And yoo, you could be wide receiver, you gotta buy a heater


I keep the pipe like Mario (Mamma mia)
And everytime I'm in the booth I got some kind of fever
I'm a thoroughbred you just red the don Diva
Mamasita give me brain like a mind reader
I'm ether, so me battlin yall, is like a nigga with no arm seein a palm reader
You can't see me like Stevie you ain't blind either
You got good vision, but you still couldn't listen
Keep your hood, that's a hood tradition, but if you rich lookin in the hood
You ain't in a good position, cause niggas in the hood twisted
You leave something unattended in the hood, it's as good as missin
You could be the best muslim or the goodest christian
But you still gon sin it's never gon end
Life's short that's the reason why I'm goin in, Imma do me
Motheruckers can keep doin 'em
I'm born to win, you were born loser pussy
I pull it, have them fuckin bullets goin through ya
That's how I'm goin through I show you how the Heckler feel
I'm real healthy but I'm extra ill
And when I got my first record deal I was payin them
I was on the block movin that rock like cavemen
And I was still spendin days in and days in
Still gettin cased in cooked that causcasian
I be lookin amazin, And that chocolate chip truck been told 'em raise in
I was raised in the hood where niggas is caged in
Been through a lot that hot since finger ways was in
And I been a crook I put decades in, got a stash on my truck i cook the esacades in
Let me tell you what they trynna do
Look they invented the swine flu so we don't let the ese's in
My homie Manolo keep the best haze in, that purple get me high as shit
That's why I buy that shit, He always give me a couple of buds extra
I get high so I don't get high blood pressure, They right, pressure do bust pipes
But I love pressure and I'm applyin it I'm a scientist, mother-f'er
I'm bout my business in kitchen I'm a chemist, but the knife an actuality I be doin
Biology
FATALITY it's over finish him, You a male but you a bitch like lil kim and 'em
Yall grown men but yall softer than all my women friends, I stop spittin crack
But relapse like I was eminem, who your favorite rapper, why you trynna mimic him?
You a copycat, holmes, you a clone a synonym, look up that other aritist name in a thesaurus
And your stupid name will be right next to it you garbage
Who the hardest, the next rapper that try to battle me, assault and battery
Automaticly
You so sweet I prolly get another cavity, but fuck it, I got dentist money
That's why you mad at me, I'm on my grind from saturday to saturday
My block jump like charge and a dead car battery, I'm the hustla I gotta grind
I'm CA double dollar sign, I'm the best bottom line
You must be out your mind, if you think you fuckin with me

You know how to ball play, I come around your way, hand on my cannon man I'm standin
In your door way, I know your address your whore told me where yall stay

Or your 4-4 spray, hip hip hooray, you saw get your head blown off like four play

Cracked man

No red card joke, when I did B.A.R.S I was in recovery you still see the head scars
Thank god I ain't die I hit my head hard, but ay when I was a kid my mom did say
Boy your head hard, the problems I always had was followin rules, I'm a dude that always bad
