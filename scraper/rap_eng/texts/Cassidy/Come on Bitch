[Intro]
Lets go
Tha Hustla
Larsiny Family
Full Surface!
I'm dead serious

[Hook]
You don't love me, I know you hate me
You wanna tie me up, and duct tape me
I'm tryin' not to, they tryin' make me
So I can snap, they rat and incarcerate me

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to find me nigga, I been grindin' since the 90's nigga
But I'm a 80's baby, crazy grimy nigga, you a bitch, you'll take it in a hommy nigga
I spit that shit, that's why SwizZz signed me nigga, ain't no replacements
I just bought a bracelet, but can't even put that shit on it'll blind me nigga
I did jail time I just beat a hommy nigga, you did time for a bundle and a johnny nigga
You used to steal cars, now you tryna steal bars?
You used to grind packs, now you tryna rhyme raps?
You and your man was goin half on a dime sack
You ain't start to shine till you signed your little contract
If you in Philly then I'm the nigga to contact
I palm gats and I'm always ready for combat
If Cass miss you a snitch like Cass did it
So Cass won't miss imma split you in half with it

[Hook]
You don't love me, I know you hate me
You wanna tie me up, and duct tape me
I'm tryin' not to, they tryin' make me
So I can snap, they rat and incarcerate me

[Verse 2]
I'm the man they can't stand cause they know I'm the damn man
But look the heater put you to sleep like sand man
Your guns go PLATT PLATT, mine go BAM BAM
Y'all be talkin slick but y'all get on the damn stand
I got some bad news, I'll ruin your damn plan
I know you on my dick, just admit you a damn fan
All my raps crack, every bar is a damn gram
My chain so bright, it'll prolly give you a damn tan
Canary bezel I love pebbles like bam bam
My ring so large it's hard to lift up my damn hand
But I ain't tryna box a nigga, I'm tryna to ox a nigga
Pop a nigga up wit da choppa I'm tryna to rock a nigga
Yeah I'm tryna to pine box a nigga
I start lettin' off rounds make it sound like a helicopter nigga
All they tryna to do is stop a nigga
Yeah I keep makin' money, but they keep tryna take it from me

[Hook]
You don't love me, I know you hate me
You wanna tie me up, and duct tape me
I'm tryin' not to, they tryin' make me
So I can snap, they rat and incarcerate me

[Verse 3]
I might not have got a plat, but that's not a factor
How my label gone drop me I'm the hottest rapper
Sony BMG still workin' with 'em
SwizZz is too cause I started Full Surface with him
Everything is the same way, but if I got dropped then I woulda got signed again the same day
I still spit it the same way, and every team gone need they star player when it's game day

[Hook]
You don't love me, I know you hate me
You wanna tie me up, and duct tape me
I'm tryin' not to, they tryin' make me
So I can snap, they rat and incarcerate me
