[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm from the big city of dreams, plenty of hustlers, plenty of feends
Plenty of cash, get plenty of cream
Cocaine City, the city of dreams
I'm from the big city of dreams, plenty of hustlers, plenty of feends
Plenty of cash, get plenty of cream
Cocaine City, the city of dreams

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Got Coke cameras, loaf in the cameras
Keep the stash box for the hammers
Nigga picture bricks, killers, Os
? gorillas, wolves
Ar with the AR, I ain't biefin
You niggas ain't even in my radar
Young Bob Barker, Mozzy Parker
All over the beat, Travis Barker
Fif bust, concussion, your ribs crack
Eyes close, the moons like pot holes
Catch a whole round, niggas stick around
That'll lift m up, or sit m down
Niggas rapping the same, but they really twat
We were really hot, when we ran A Block
Slang caine, heavy chain hang, heavy bop
Maintain thangs ame, millys pop

[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm from the big city of dreams, plenty of hustlers, plenty of feends
Plenty of cash, get plenty of cream
Cocaine City, the city of dreams
I'm from the big city of dreams, plenty of hustlers, plenty of feends
Plenty of cash, get plenty of cream
Cocaine City, the city of dreams

[Verse 2: AR-AB]
I'm tryna get established
If not rappin, I'm in the crack house givin work to an addict
Let niggas fall, til they lookin at a Magnom
Get something straight, Imma take it if I don't have it
You'll see the shotgun, wip twin pipes
Or get the hawk stuck in your windpipe
That's how it go when you live like me
I ain't wanna do the right thing, Spike Lee
I was on the trap, puttin nicks on the block
Or in the clear, stuffing clips to the top
Niggas gonna drop, when I pull the pound
Make your insides show, like an ultrasound
Disrespect fams,  sparkin the k, shooten out artery glands
Cause AR keep a pipe full of hollos
Tryna see green, like night vision goggles

[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm from the big city of dreams, plenty of hustlers, plenty of feends
Plenty of cash, get plenty of cream
Cocaine City, the city of dreams
I'm from the big city of dreams, plenty of hustlers, plenty of feends
Plenty of cash, get plenty of cream
Cocaine City, the city of dreams

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
You ain't gotta ask me what I hustle for
What you think Def Jam need Russle for?
What you think a body builder need muscle for?
I'm worth a couple mill, but still want a couple more
So I count my money, then count it over
I sold plenty coke, but I don't mean fountin soda
I'm rich, call my acountent over
I started off moving bolders, but now I knock mountains over
I told you, me and AB from the same city
And Frenchy came with me, and he from Cocaine City
Loss is the fam, I brought the whole gang with me
And I got them thangs with me, ain't nothing change with me
I ain't never been a dummy man, I'm a farmisist selling drugs, and the perscription is money, man
I need food for the tummy, man
So I go to Cocaine City where it jump like a bunny, man

[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm from the big city of dreams, plenty of hustlers, plenty of feends
Plenty of cash, get plenty of cream
Cocaine City, the city of dreams
I'm from the big city of dreams, plenty of hustlers, plenty of feends
Plenty of cash, get plenty of cream
Cocaine City, the city of dreams
