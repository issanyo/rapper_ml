Shake it i want to see you shake it
I ain't gon fake it i want to see you naked it
Girl you got figure make a nigga want to taste it
Lay your face on the pillow cases
And see if you can Take it

Verse 1
Yeah dis cat in the business
600 on the back of my benzes
It's nothin
I lay back in my drop and get my roll on
I took my old jon back to the lot like take it
And my ****** be mind blown
Big face watch 5 different time zones
And they ain't rinestones
They a couple of thou
And this just one of my styles so take it

(chorus)
(girl)
Daddy you know i want to shake it
The way i shake it make you want to break it
(cassidy)
Ain't nothin stop frontin what's poppin boo
If you want it all you got to do is come take it
(girl)
Daddy i know you gon make it
And when you make it you still gon take it
(cassidy)
Stand up if you makin somethin
Stand up if you takin somethin OK?

Verse 2
Some niggas want to live this life but can't live it
I know what it's like to want it and can't get it
I know what it's like to be broke
That's why everytime i get a good price on a *****
Ima take it
Everything i write is a quote
And for that butta you be bitin the toast
I'm back on my grissel and my raps official
Any chance i get to clap my ***** man ima take it
You should ride for ya man and if worst come to worst
You should die for ya man
But if i run up and pull it and shoot at your man
Would you jump in front of the bullet and take it

(chorus)
If it ain't one thing damn it's anotha
Hand in hand i sold grams of butta
Man i was drug dealin cuz i love the feelin of handin a couple grand
To my motha like take it
Look i'm off the chain
I get all the bitches all the brain
My sound goin down in the hall of fame
And all yall gon call the name CASSIDY
And ima take it flip it bounce it and switch it up
I take herbs by tha ounces and twist it up
Listen up wit the mic in my hand it's like i got ya life in my hands and
Ima take it

(chorus)
TAKE IT!
