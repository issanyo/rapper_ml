[Verse 1 - Cassidy]
We gettin' money, ain't nobody broke up in here, we smokin' in here
Yeah, we puttin' smoke in the air
Yeah, we rollin' pot and poppin' bottles open in here
So everything movin' slow motion in here
Yeah, I had to hustle, my back to the wall ashy knuckles, did anybody bring some lotion in here?
Yeah, I'm just jokin' but I hope you can hear
That I'm focus, I'm the dopest, nigga open your ears
I could do a magic trick, throw some coke in the air
Then do some hokus-pokus, make the coke disappear
Everywhere I go I'm tryna bring my toaster in there
'Cause everywhere I go, I know there's gon' be vultures in there
You got a frown on your face, what I'm s'posed to be scared?
We can rumble or we can put the gun smoke in the air
Yeah, the shit I'm smokin' got me chokin' in here
I married money but I'm havin' a smokin' affair

[Hook - Cassidy]
Yeah, yeah put ya dutch in the air
Smoke haze, let the smoke raise up in the air
Put ya dutch in the air, put ya dutch in the air
Smoke haze, let the smoke raise up in the air
Put ya dutch in the air, put ya dutch in the air

Put ya dutch in the air, put ya dutch in the air

[Verse 3 - Cassidy]
Put your dutch in the sky, if you puffin the li'
La, la, la, la, la nigga fuck it I'm high
High up in the sky but I'm like fuck it I'm fly
Me and Chub in the strip club throwin' bucks in the sky
If you sippin' that good liquor throw your cup in the sky
Throw your drink in the air, that weed stinkin' in here
Yeah, all night I roll that Peppy Le Pew up
I used to drink till I threw up but I grew up
I blew up on the low like a crew cut
New car, new truck your car need a tune up
Yup, I'm a veteran not an amateur
I get cannisters a out of space from Los Ianaga
Plus I could order the piff straight from Florida
Been sellin' hand-to-hand and strip like Amsterdam
Man, I'm tryna feel how a pimp feel
I'm off the hook that's why I'm higher than the Spring bill
