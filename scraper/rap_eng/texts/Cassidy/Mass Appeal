[Intro]
R.I.P Guru, Cassidy I'm talkin' it back to straight hip hop
No more of that watered down music these dudes puttin' out
Just straight bars

[Hook]
X4 Niggas know Cass got the mass appeal

[Verse 1]

I ain't tryin' to go broke
Cause when your money funny its no joke
I want cash to come fast I'm not a slow poke
Chief in the dro smoke till I'm weezin' like old folk
And I can't breath like my nose broke
My flow dope if you don't like then go vote
Before ? my flow is so china
White like a bitch but I'ma get the vagina
For real till my bank account get another comma
I'ma grinda thats word to my mama
I been a G, so why change my identity
I'm sinister, nicer words like a minister
And you a miniature version of my mini me
If its either him or me? he gonna get it first
You a pussy like a bitch givin' birth, get a purse
You a battle rapper? (What?) spit a verse
Cause I eat a rapper up then shit a verse

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Yeah, I been gettin' cash money since a juvenile
I got a soap opera face and a movie smile
My wife pretty nice titties big booty style
We stuck together I'mma love her for ever
She so sweet to me she said if you gone be with me
Why cheat on me when we can fuck em together
Thats even better what more could I ask for
If I ask I'm sure I could get what ever I ask for
With the chick I got I'm straight like 6 o clock
But you niggas not you get cock in your ass boul
Dag boul what you mad at Cass for
Cause I know you a homo and your ass sore?
Wait hold it I'm not homophobic
But if you gay come out the closet don't close it
I only fuck women, and everybody knows it
You fuck men but holdin' it in I'm gone expose it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Ayo tryin' rhyme dope as me
Is like tryin' to run a marathon with a broken knee
See, I been was what you hope to be
I'mma dope MC hopefully you recognize it
You only live one life don't jeopardize it
Livin' the thug life somebody with your blood type
Gone have to go to the blood bank and make a direct deposits
Cause when you heart beat weak you can't exercise it
My life like a movie shoot you fruity dude
Don't get your ass beat like fruity loops
If its beef to tell you the truth I let the Ruger shoot
Ceiling just spinnin' like a hoola hoop
I got fans in every continent I'm confident
So when you criticize I take it as a complement
I play with the heavy metal like a rock event
Its common sense I live a life you should document
