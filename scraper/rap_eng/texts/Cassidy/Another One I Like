[Hook]
I get a whip then see another one I like
I get a bad bitch then see another one I like
I get a outfit then see another one I like
So you know I gotta go and get the other one I like
Get the other one I like, other other one I like
Get the other one I like, other other one I like
It’s like I got everything I wanted in my life
But when I get what I want I see another one I like

[Verse 1]
As a youngin', I would agonize
Get sad and cry, when I realized what I wanted I will have to buy
Cause I ain't even had a job
So you know I felt mad, The Prob – I was never satisfied
I wouldn't say that I was ungrateful
I had food on the table but my income was unstable
Now I'm a grown man
Some people say that if they could have mine they would cut off they own hand (Damn)
Cause I had the first platinum ringtone man
And you ain’t got enough bars, switch your phone plan
I understand when they say that you gotta play the card you was dealt, but I'd rather deal my own hand
I be stressin' a lot, instead of investin' in gwop
I went shoppin' with every cheque that I got
I'm thankful for the success that I got
But you could never have enough no matter you successful or not

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to get rich, nigga
Look, I don't think you see the big picture
Even Bill Gates tryna get richer
The quickest runner tryna get quicker
Thick chicks tryna get thinner
Thinner chicks tryna get thicker
Why do pretty chicks Photoshop Twit pictures?
And niggas take pills tryna make they dick bigger
Cause everybody tryna make improvements
I'm the best ever, still tryna get better at making music
And that'll never switch
Everybody strike out but I'mma never quit
I’m swingin' that every pitch
We live in poverty
That’s why niggas play the lottery
Knowing that they probably will never hit
That shit robbery
See the economy ain’t for you, it's made to destroy you psychologically
That's why people want more than they could possibly deal with
But on some real shit that's how I gotta be

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I moved out my mom crib, I had to get a host
‘Cause soon as I moved I was tryna buy a bigger house
I stay low key
But if the pigs knew all the things I did they would never let me go free
I’m an OG, in '01 I bought a '02 but in '02 I wanted a '03
You know me, I’m tryna make some more cream
Cause in a couple months I won the 24 Team

[Hook]

[Interlude]
That's real talk man
No matter what you get in life you gon' always want more
I mean the brokest niggas wanna get rich
And the richest niggas wanna get even richer
You could never be satisfied
Not that you ungrateful but you always tryna get more
You always tryna strive for more
So no matter what condition you in, you gotta learn to live with yourself and be comfortable with life
Or else you will never be satisfied no matter what level you reach
And that's why I put this song together man
No matter what you ever get in life, you always gon' need some more
So the grind never stop, you gotta keep hustlin' man
You gotta stay on yo motherfuckin' job
Yea, real rap

[Hook]
I get a whip then see another one I like

Get the other one I like, other other one I like
Get the other one I like, other other one I like
It’s like I got everything I wanted in my life
But when I get what I want I see another one I like
