[Verse 1: Cassidy]

Look bitch, I'm not feeling your shit
Every song that im on, I be killing the shit
Your flow wack, I throw packs, still on the bricks
I'm dealing with six figures, but niggas still on the strip
No ceiling when I'm wheeling the whip
Your bitchass is trash, but im feeling her lips
That slut probably got my nut still on lips
So much ice in my watch im not feeling my wrist
Dont care if you clap and you filling them clips
Get a slug in your hat, gat still on your hips

If you a thug in your rap why you pussy in real life
A pimp on the mic and buy pussy in real life

Nah, I lay my mack down I ain't tripping
I ain't slipping, I rap now I aaint tricking
I dont care if she pretty ho, and I got Diddy Dough
And I done had every bad bitch in the city yo
And I learnt it from Biggie yo
I got the chicks why the shit went gold off 1 video
And I'mma go platinum of number 2
And im gonna drop another album when the summers through

What you gonna do I know how to humble you
I ain't gonna rumble you I 'll put a gun to you
Look Dog, Im small kinda slinky
Thats why I alway have my paws on the blinky
And I brawl like Winky
The Radiant Rock you can't see no flaws on my pinky
And I stunt coz I pump crack
If you cats wore my chain for a month you'd be Hunchback
Duke I shoot, the pump make you jump back
Im in the coupe, and the roof where the trunk at

See im the truth man I leave dudes nauseous
I had to prove who was the harderst and who's garbage
I'mma make moves regardless
Coz I sound better than them veterans and im a new artist

Cass the bomb, ask ya mom
Coz all you pretty women think Cass a dime
And all your little sisters think Cass is fine
Coz my rhyme Acid and your asinine, Bastard
Everybody know Cass can rhyme
Thats not a question, I was born with it, got a blessing

Im a King everything that I say hot
You shit sad, niggas just mad coz they not
The shit sad niggas just mad coz they flop
That coz they ain't have no bars when they drop
Im on top like 'fuck you pay me"
And when I rock my jewels I dont use my A.C
I get down B? and get kilos of the C.O.K.E
No you not me, you an imposter duke
Getting fucked for your money like a prostitute

Im the C.A. crooked letter crooked letter .I.D.Y
Who you know cook a better pie?
And My birds have em hooked when I let em fly
I get the cheddar why, Im a crook and I never lie
And I ain't never shook, niggas look but they never try
Just like in the stores, niggas look but they never buy

I, seen it I like, I get it nothing all
Coz I be hustling raw and ducking the law
I'll be shopping till its nothing to fuck in the mall
I'll ain't flossing and fronting, its nothign to ball
You say you don't love them hoes, but cuffing them all
And she still fucking me while she fucking with y'all
Yep Dog, im worth hundreds od thousands, and I'm starving my stomach is growling

I m home brand!
Im on the strip with the workhorse grinding
Truck, White leather gutsd turquoise lining
Watch, White leather band turquoise diamonds
White T, Evisu's with the turquoise sign in
I can't lie Hov put me on Evisu
But when I put em on I be looking better than he do!
Cats out there who bought a pair like me too
Threw blue stones in the chain, the ring see through
And you play with them things im like me too
I put a hole in a nigga big enough to see through

But we all gotta go when it's time
Im pro niggas know I can rhyme
I be in the booth with the dro in the air and the dough on my mind
I'mma blow niggas know I'm the bomb

I'm, The best that ever did it
The best that gon' do it
The rest ain't ever live it, the rest ain't gon' through it
I was born to do it, I spit like im on fluid
I wish someone else dissed this, just to respond to it
And every chick I hit be going through it
I dont know if my girl going wild or going stupid
My bars better that yours, and im gon' prove it
And put pressure on every nigga doing music
Coz I been doing this for way too long
The pay too short, and the days to long

I be
Acting a fool, packing a tool
Back to the dude I was before the black and the Jews
Im, slinging the drugs, slinging the drugs
Hanging with thugs I knew before the fame and the love
Im one of the first artists, who get love from the younguns
And the ones that was in it when it first started

Coz I do with skill, I'm not just rapping
Coz I really happen I do it for real
I move pills and I sold Caine
Cops know me by my whole name
My weed purple like the Soul Plane
And if you dont know, you know now
Its a showdown, on the the low it gonna go down

Baby, my 3.80, hold 1 in the dome
And some of it chrome
Avoid the beef your you running alone
Should have brought your piece your gun is at home
"Thats where you left your gat"?
You'd be dead, trying to run to crib where you left it at
With your chest and your face numb
I'mma keep taking shells out the case to a catch one
Thats dumb, you should have brought your gun
If you never had a hammer should have bought you one
You gotta take it when you travel
And make it so hot that you could fry bacon on the barrel, Pussy

[Verse 2: Cassidy, rolling a blunt throughout]

Nigga swell up so big
That if you live you would probably have stretch marks
? hurt it with pistols
Your bodyguards probably broad, but ain't no murders with you
Thats pathetic I got a fetish for purchasing pistols
I murder every person thats with you
Rounds from the case running down your legs ?
Im a crook I put in work its official
In 9-3 I used to grind tree, now I working with nickels
Times change so the grind change I working sniffles
Do my dirt on the grizzle, focussed on the flip
Coke potent, it got the fiends open of the sniff
When they cook it and smoke it they be open off the hit

Shit fresh compressed just broker it off the brick
Lavender haze got you coughing off the joint
Chicks getting emotions getting open off the dick
Im blowing in the whip and like 6 stacks on me
Half a brick of crack with like 6 gats on me

About to dropoff nigga
And I'm flipping weight
So I'm strapped just in case it pop off nigga
I came a long way from knocking nickel rocks of nigga
So for the dough I blow your top of nigga
And they always knew you'd be a bitch
Coz you pop soft nigga, you're frail
Or be in jail getting knocked off nigga
The bezel and the band rocked off nigga
So my body temperature would rise if I take my watch off nigga
Im the boy you should cop off nigga
You can smell it through the jar
You ain't gotta take the top off nigga
I stack change, the rap game got it locked off nigga
Enough bitches on my dick
You can hop off nigga
You wouldn't believe how many chicks I popped off nigga
My cock been in more buns that a hot dog nigga
Im not y'all niggas I ain't snitching or bitching up
Im a straight cannon dont get it twisted or mix it up

Listen up, there ain't no nigga as ill as me
Im cocky coz I know niggas feeling me

Their niggas doing life with no possibility of parole
Digging my flows coz ain't no nigga real as me
Thats how it feel to be on top of the world
If he don't like, I'm probably popping his girl
My flow hot and I'm thorough I'm one of kind
And nah, I ain't off my job none of the time
You write some of the time, I keep coming with rhymes
I spit and make you quit with just one of my lines
And dont even battle no more
If you ain't got a quarter million bucks
"what the fuck I'mma battle you for?"

If you saw some of the broad and thongs that I been in
You would realize why I'm doing songs for the women
All my songs winning, I m commercial and all that
With no rehearsal I will still murk you so fall back
Even if y'all strapped, I can bang with the best of you
Coz I stay in the range, my aim is impeccable
And you the target get all this in the clip
The shells in the 9 Taurus got garlic on the tips
