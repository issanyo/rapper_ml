But I don't move pharmaceuticals, I'm mo' musical
I be rhymin' 'cause findin' a job is unusual
And workin' a 9 to 5 ain't cool to do
Da pay they pay you today is unsuitable
Dat's why workin' at a job, I refuse to do
For real, but da media be confusin' you
They said I had price on mah head, dem niggas foolin' you
If I had a price on mah head
I'd put twice da bread and they'll be dead
Dey gon' shoot at who?
I got da loot to get plenty niggas to shoot at you
And I'll shoot it too, but you know dem lil' dudes'll do
Dey ain't sparkin they barkin' just like a poodle do
And I could prove it too dat da problem is unsolutional

[Hook: D.V. Alias Khryst {Maino} (Uncle Murda)]
