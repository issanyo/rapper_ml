[Intro]
Are you gonna take me home tonight
Oh down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go 'round

[Verse 1]
I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman, you made a bad boy out of me

[Verse 2]
I've been singing with my band
Across the wire, across the land
I seen every blue-eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

[Chorus]
Oh won't you take me home tonight
Oh down beside your red firelight?
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go r'ound
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round

[Verse 2]
Now your mortgages and homes
I've got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality
I still get my pleasure
Still get my greatest treasure
Hey, big woman, you gonna make a bad boy out of me
Yeah

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight
Oh down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round

Get on your bikes and ride!

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight (please)
Oh down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round (yeah)
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go 'round

[Outro fades out]
Are you gonna take me home tonight (Fat bottom)
Are you gonna take me home tonight (Said you gonna take me home tonight)
Are you gonna take me home tonight (Gonna take me home tonight, yeah he's gonna take me--)
Are you gonna take me home tonight (home tonight)
