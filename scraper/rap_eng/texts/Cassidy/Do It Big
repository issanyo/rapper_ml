Little that we know that in the middle of little littly
Little that we know that in the middle of little littly
Little that we know that in the middle of little littly
Little that we know that we riddle to middle man that didn't do didly
Let's get it popping like a GUN
I hustle cause I'm tryna bubble like GUM
The kid do it big like PUN
Cause I'm nice like PAC with the PEN
Let's get it popping like a GUN
I hustle cause I'm tryna bubble like GUM
The kid do it big like PUN
Cause I'm nice like B.I.G. with the PEN
Rest in peace Big Pun, free remmy
You're not that tough. Stick to the script
If you act up you're sliced with a knife and I'm payin' the dudes, call me tax cut
For them racks you get snatched up
For that cash shot, get your ass shot like a bitch with a flat but
I'm in the kitchen cutting crack up
We up the ball, track more crack than some lips that's jacked up
I'm tryna shine like lip vime
I'm not tryna get time but I commit crimes, I'm tryna get mine
When I was 16 my dream was to get signed and spit rhymes
Mean 16's, nothin' but sick lines
Make my neck, my pinky and both wrists shine
Buy mad whips and stay on a bad chick's mind
I'm just grindin', my dream came true
But things wasn't the same when that cream came through
Plenty things came through, our triple B came too
It's like if you was on my team then you'd see change too
Yo I spared no expense when my team came through
So everywhere I went, yea my team came too
If there was drama I'm the nigga that the team came to
Cause they know I'm not sane, I got a box game
I got a ox game and the mean ain't 2
But my team let the things and the jeans bang too
We all together, if I fall we fall together
Cause we all ball together, this a team game too
We've seen sunny days and we've seen rain too
But whatever weather we get, we've got cedar to give
Bein' broke is just something I could never forget
Now that I'm fly I can buy shit I never could get
I'd've done some shit in life that I'da never admit
But some shit would happen in life that you could never predict
No, I was never a trick but I spit cedar on chicks
Cause most hoes rather have cash instead of the dick
No, I was never of blood, I was never of crick
But I've always been a gangsta, I was never a bitch
I don't think you ever heard a rapper better than this
I'm so great I hold weight like a pregnant bitch
'Bout to go in labor. I'm a pro, niggas know I'm major
No one can save ya. You might as well swallow a razor
And kill your damn self. Cause when I write I make the pen in my hand melt
That's why I got the damn belt
For real cash real bad for your damn health
All your rhymes pre-recorded and sound pre-historic
He mad my mom ain't get my aborted
Cause to battle me would cost him his life
I'm like: can he afford it? Not at all dog
Get your skull cracked with a bottle of alcohol. You soft like a cotton ball
Before I squeeze the HI, take the stocking off
And let you see my face before I pop it off
Little that we know that in the middle of little littly
Little that we know that in the middle of little littly
Little that we know that in the middle of little littly
Little that we know that we riddle to middle man that didn't do didly
