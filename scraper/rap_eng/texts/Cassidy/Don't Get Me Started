[Hook]
I got molly stones Patrone and zones of that [?]
Niggas done started somethin'
Tired of whack cats rappin' I'm back snappin' on rap artists
Niggas done started somethin'
Yo they know they scared of Cass they trash they raps garbage
Niggas done started somethin'
Ay the way I murder beats I'm surprised I ain't catch charges
Niggas done started somethin'
Niggas done started somethin'
Niggas done niggas done started somethin'
Don't start what you can't finish
Niggas done started somethin'
Niggas done niggas done  started somethin'
You start it and I'ma end it

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I drink liquor twist a lot of [?]
I got a woman now but took a lot of women down Ronda Rousey
You had sex with me its like the UFC
I give a chick the two until she quit like it's a mission move
Oooo you dudes just confused like a transvestite
Grown men movin' how bitches move
And you the type to get your dick removed
Get implants and butt shots to suck cock you a vicious dude
You ain't get the news I got plenty bars
Like when you go to jail I'm like a hotel, two mini bars
You cats can't rap I write a rap fast
Like Usain Bolt when I'm gettin' on the damn track
But damn that you cats finished Saran wrap
Cause you soft and hang around pussies Tampax
And I ridin' the damn track Amtrak
So you know I'ma blow like them Taliban cats

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I leave your body floatin' in the ocean like beach ball
You sweet dog jump jump then if you a leap frog
My homie Will said you need to bite the leash off
You a beast dog you need some meat under your teeth dog
I'm like you right nigga I'ma bite niggas
Take a life nigga I ain't a racist but I don't like niggas
I'm like screw you I'm a pit you a fuckin' poodle
Eat you up eat you up quick like a cup of noodles
Yup its truthful that's somethin' you can fuckin' Google
Hear it from me first then go do your research
I bear arms like a t-shirt
Cause I'm from a wild block and got more beef then a halal spot
Y'all niggas not tough I let that .40 cal pop
And y'all niggas dial cops and get a nigga locked up
I'm guaped up it look like my pockets knocked up
I flip work pockets fat like they bout to give birth

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Everything you hearin' is dope
I'm hotter than a fat man in a steam room wearing a coat
That there was a joke
But on a more serious note my money dirty
After I count it I use anti-bacterial soap
Listen niggas and the bitches love me
I'm on Worldstar no video just audio and a picture of me
They gone be mad when this song stop
Cause they ain't hear no bars like this since this original song dropped
Yo this song hot so hatin' on me'll be dumb
Like wearing short shorts and some long socks
I'm on fire I don't need no light
So I know cats gone have this track bumpin' like mosquito bites

Niggas done niggas done  started somethin'
You start it and I'ma end it
