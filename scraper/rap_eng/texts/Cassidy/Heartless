[Hook: Cassidy]
In the hood, I hear em tell
The coldest story ever told
On the strip where drugs get sold, he lost control
And shot a many so heartless
How could he be so heartless
How could he be so heartless

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I ain't never been a rat, ain't nothing change
So in the story I'mma call the boy what's a name
What's a name used to hustle caine
But he stopped n' just started robbing niggas that was touching change
He couldn't sleep at night, cause he wasn't eating right
N' said "Fuck it man I'm tryna step up my game"
What's a name would put in work if the pay was good
So he went to rob the richest guy in the neighborhood
He had a frown on his face, he was mad stressed
He was strapped right at the bols' address
He knocked on the door with a large pizza out
N' went he open the door he pulled a larger heater out
He was there with his two daughters n' his wife
So he begged what's a name to not end his life
N' whats a name wasn't in his right
Say the mind cause he knew he needed more money in his life
He tied up his wife, older n younger kid
Said "Take me to the safe if you wanna live"
You better show me where at least a couple hundred is
Or I'mma put the hole clip where your stomach is
To make a long story short, he a wanted man
But what's a name worth at least 800 grand
Before he left he put his fam on the damn couch
N put tape on there damn mouth so they can't shout
It ain't no telling what he might do
So he behaved, Cause he tryna save his daughters n his wife too
He said "Damn you I show you the safe, please let my fam go so that I know that there safe"
He was scared he at tears all over his face
But what's a name blew his brains all over the place
And his wife, ewww, he removed most of the face
Then let his daughters live but they both was raped
This a re-love company, but dark love darkness
But damn how could a man be so heartless

[Hook: Cassidy]

[Outro: Cassidy]
Damn, I don't like to run my mouth
But I had to tell y'all that story man
That's crazy
Like how can you kill a man, kills his wife, rape his daughters, take his money
I mean that's crazy
I had to let ch'all know that theres niggas out there
So you gotta watch your self man
It's crazy out there man
For real...
