[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I'm quick to choke, I hit the smoke
And cough like people that catch a cold
I just left the stove, cooking rock
It look like the snot in a messy nose
We Eskimos, my chest is cold
And my neck is cold cause my necklace froze
Messy hoes, I can't mess with those
If I mess with hoes, then they sexy hoes
The bezzy glows, I'm making money
Try to take it from me, that Dezzy blows
You already know what my life like nigga
Hey, you ready to go night night nigga
Both my left and my right nice nigga
I whip your ass like this fight night nigga
I'm a boxer, that wear boxers
But you on my cock like them tight whites nigga
You only trap on the mic type nigga
Never sold that crack in real life type nigga
I call the squad, they all arrive, and you horrified like this fright night nigga
You ain't never been hard in your life type nigga
You the type that like your clothes tight tight nigga
I'm a type of nigga that's gonna ride
I'm always working, I'm on my job
I got to working, I'm doing my job
How much is you buying boy
You know how it work when you got that work that they be dying for
I'll be in my back, I'll be spazzing, I'll be murking
Every person I'll be rapping on the track with cause I'm working
