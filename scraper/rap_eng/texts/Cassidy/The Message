It's a real bad time for black celebrities, they lockin everybody up:

Michael Jackson, James Brown, 2Pac, R. Kelly, OJ Simpson, Mike Tyson
Kobe Bryant, Jay-Z, Mystikal, P. Diddy, Allen Iverson, Snoop Dogg, DMX
Styles P, Shine, Beanie Segal, Lil' Kim

[Hook:]
Is it because I'm Black
Is it because I'm Black

When you black you got to hustle, got to struggle and strive
And not every cat that goes through that struggle survive
But he got to stay stronger and keep the struggle alive
They say the struggle died, I say the struggle revived
My profession is going through oppression
That's why I'm so stressed and Im working with no rest
And no question ima fight for yall cause I don't like it yall
We make half as much as them, we workin twice as hard yall
It ain't fair sometimes you seein heaven signs, I ain't Pharaohcon
But I got knowledge and I'm sharing mines. I swear its time to
Be aware that they fear you mind, and they fear your heart. You
Want to change heres the start. I'm tired of watching cops outline
My peers and yall, I'm trying to make a move, I'm not trying to make
The news. They say the consequences worst when we break the
Rules. To get back and right you got to make a sacrifice

[Hook:]
Is it because I'm Black
Is it because I'm Black

We got some problems we need solve, heres our chance to get them handle
Just take the boycott in Alabama for example. They stop ridin the bus till they
Address their affairs. And they ended segregation in less then a year. So imagine
What our status if we made a contribution, we'll probably be able to change the
Constitution. I can't see no other kind of solution we deserve our reparation, its
Time for a revolutions. I'm a step ahead of Satan, I read it in Revelation. Forget
Your reputation, lets make it a better nation, cause they trying to cage us in
Make us slaves again, eventually its meant to be the new plantation, the penitentiary
For centuries they had a plan we let them executed, everyday another brother getting
Executed. And all our artist getting arrested I aspect improvement. It's a message
In the music, I suggest you use it

[Hook:]
Somebody tell me what can I do
Will I survive or will I die

On the streets its hard to survive
Why, is it because I'm black
Hot Shot got rock, I can't bring my cousin back
Five-hundred thousand sold, gold, yeah it wasn't platinum
But Clyde gave me another try, cause I wasn't whack
And now im buzzin back, yeah I got my budget back
Renegotiating got a mil to do a dozen tracks
Yea I'm eatin only reason is because I rap, my homies eatin only reason is because of crack
They can't get a job so them niggas quick to rob, quick to steal
Quick to kill, grip the steal, quick to ride
Malcolm X, Martin Luther King we can't forget them guys
These politician, hypocrites they got us hypnotize
That why I kiss rick, why, we got to lift our eyes
Cause if we keep'em close they just goin keep control
And hold our sisters and brothers in the pen and we was born guilty
Cause the color of our skin
