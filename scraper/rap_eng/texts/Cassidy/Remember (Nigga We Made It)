[Intro]
Motherfuckers used to love us
USED TO LOVE US
You're never gonna be
You're not now, and you niggas never was us
REMEMBER? Motherfuckers used to love us
REMEMBER? Motherfuckers used to love us

[Hook]
I been had a buzz
The streets been showing me mad love
But none of you cats never had love
Nowhere, so don't go there, yeah
REMEMBER? Motherfuckers used to love us
REMEMBER? Motherfuckers used to love us

[Verse: 1]
Motherfuckers used to love us
Used to love us
Anytime we hit the club up
Remember all the motherfucking chicks used to wanna kiss and hug us
We used to pop models
And pop bottles till the sun's up
And we would stink the club up like fuck the bouncers
Roll the ounces of bud up
And my ice can't melt
But if it could fucking fill a tub up
You could take a bath in it
And my safe filled up, got a whole lot of cash in it
And they say time is money
So I'm trying getting money every last minute
If you a snake in the grass, get buried
The cemetery got a lot of grass in it
Say hello to the bad guy
I'mma make cats cry when this rap is finished
Cause in this rap business you shouldn't try to be a good guy
That's bad business
I'm with my wife and this groupie
She can eat my wife coochie while I'm smashing it
She look mean in them jeans
But had a hard time tryin' to fit her ass in it
I get T-O-P
Then get more pussy than the O-B-G-Y-N
But slide it condom style
Even though I like it raw like O-D-B
So when I H-I-T I'm gonna put the Magnum on
Cause I ain't trying to get H-I-V or A-I-D-S
I'll protect my dick
This stick can move like the great Ali
Aww

Motherfuckers! I'm on my worst behavior
Motherfuckers! This gonna hurt you haters

Ayo, I'm on
I play with them toys even though I'm grown (damn)
So hold my phone
And take pics for the fans
I do it for the Gram, man
I can hold my own
I got security but still hold my chrome
Real rap, that's a fact
Cats like (man i can't call his bluff
Somebody stole my phone) holmes

I'm on my worst behavior
This gonna hurt you haters

[Verse: 2]
Get your hate on
They like Cassidy, he be straight drawn
And he falling off like an Akon
Why he remix Nicki Minaj track
That Beyonce track and that Drake song
But if you're not a hater, you enjoy this shit
Cause I remix it and destroy this shit
Your boy is thick, I take broads down
And knock walls down, I destroy the bitch
They gonna remember my name forever
But pain is pleasure, they enjoy the dick
I'm about to drop this little broad off
She ride shotgun like a sawn-off
With her bra off, her titties out
She used a pretty mouth to clean my balls off
She took her draws off and played with the twat
And got a kiss on top, I got scarred off
She's far to sucking till I started busting
She used her tongue to clean it all up
I crash tracks
I'll be spitting so much crack I'm pissing the law off
So even rappers that's atheists
Be on their knees praying I fall off

[Hook]
Motherfuckers used to love us
USED TO LOVE US
You're never gonna be
You're not now, you niggas never was us
REMEMBER? Motherfuckers used to love us
REMEMBER? Motherfuckers used to love us
I been had a buzz
The streets been showing me mad love
But none of you cats never had love
Nowhere, so don't go there, yeah
REMEMBER? Motherfuckers used to love us
REMEMBER? Motherfuckers used to love us
This gonna hurt you haters, motherfuckers
I'm on my worst behavior, motherfuckers
This is gonna hurt you haters

[DJ]
Man I told you man Cass spit the punchlines boi boi
That shit was fire but I need to hear some more!

[SWITCHES BEATS]

[Verse: 3]
I wanted success now I'm one of the best
Yes I'm one of the greatest
Put bastards in caskets or turn them to ashes
You wanna get cremated
Trunk you then dump you in one of them swamps
Then leave you and feed you to one of them gators
Fuck all you haters
You fuckers should do me a favor
And swallow a couple of razors
I made it, they mentioned the greatest
Them niggas not leaving me out
I'm a spitter like Jigga when that nigga came out with reasonable doubt
Your girl gave me head, fucked your girl on the bed
Made you sleep on the couch
Fall back for I pull the heat out and smack you
Fracture your nose, make you breathe through your mouth
I'm not a Ciroc boy, I'm on Patrone
But the rocks that I rock boy, blinging like Diddy
I'm icy but niggas is shisty
So yeah, everywhere I go, yo I'm bringing my blicky
Yeah, I'm bringing it with me
It's beef then I reach for that thing and get busy
Know you not squeezing, you go to the precinct and rat
You cats will be singing like Drizzy
You niggas is ash, you niggas is trash
You niggas is garbage
But my flow so hot I can raise the degree like tuition in college
You been knew what it is
I'm doing it big like I'm Cristopher Wallace
The bars coming out Cass mouth, might leave you assed out
Like a broad stripping for dollars
I'm stacking my gravy
Back in the days I was trapping all crazy
But stopped so the judge and the court can't send me up North
Like Kim Kardashian baby
My flow is so sickenin' cause yo, I been spitting since back in the 80's
I stay on my job and been doing this longer than they was alive
Let's get back to work to get cash, your ass probly' snatch a purse
But to tell the time on the watch that I rock
I gotta put on my sunglasses first
Niggas can love it and niggas can hate it
But bitch, I'm the greatest
Admit I'm your favorite
[DJ]You killed lookin' ass bitches and that Drake shit
Nigga, we made it
