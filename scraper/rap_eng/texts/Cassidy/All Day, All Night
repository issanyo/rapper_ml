[Second Verse]

[The Game]
Yo if Cass don't get em
Then the 44 Mag gon split him
Till the tag gon fit him
Hundred Grand on my denim
Im the man of my denim
Purple Haze, Kush, (?) Japan on my denim
But I pac you and yo man and my denim
Be somewhere on the beach Write sand on my denim

[Cassidy]
I keep the blam blam and my denim
That's why I ain't got a fear
But then the game is a lot of quiz
I keep the poker face even playing Solitaire
For the cheese I went through more trees than Koala Bears

[The Game]
Ski mask and the gloves ya I got a pairs
Run around empty out the pound

[Cassidy]
And we outta here
Ya I keep a lot of sneaks and a lot of gear
