[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm on my [?], go hard over everything
I sound like a boss over everything
I do it big, do it large over everything
You know the motto yo, bars over everything!
Bars over, bars over everything
Bars over, bars over everything
I do it big, do it large over everything
You know the motto yo, bars over everything!

[Verse 1: Jesse Acosta]
At 16, I started to rip beats
Since 16, I spit heat, them 16's lay you down 6 feet
I'm doin' it for NY, you about to witness history
Modern day Joe Dimmagio, I'm on a hit streak
Bars over everything, the motto you could see why
Smashin' this track with Cass-I to the D Y
He said he needed bars on this shit? I said I got em' fam
All these other rappers bitch niggas like Juwanna Mann
The games gross, I'm disgusted with the way it go
These days lyrics don't matter up on the radio
I'm bringing bars back, looks, hooks and a crazy flow
Word to Em' , there's a slim chance I'm with a shady ho
The kush got my eyes low behind the Ray Bans
Put the Beats on rappers, same vision Dre had
They mad? Ya'll ain't competin' but you could try it
Young rookie, spittin' dope till I die, I'm like Len Bias motherfucker

[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm on my [?], go hard over everything
I sound like a boss over everything
I do it big, do it large over everything
You know the motto yo, bars over everything!
Bars over, bars over everything
Bars over, bars over everything
I do it big, do it large over everything
You know the motto yo, bars over everything!

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I'm spazzin' out, got a dragon mouth, I'll spit fire at you
You jerks puttin' in work? The bars fire rappers
I inspire rappers.. If it's drama Imma clap the chrome, crackin' their bones like I'm a chiropractor
I'm a title snatcher, the champ in the flesh
And big on the internet, a go viral rapper
Yeah the Ice Tweety Bird, The canery sprite
On my job, never strike, on my grind every night
I push keys but don't ever type
Got old money, been playin' with that white girl.. Betty White
Right? Lyrics over everything
Chicks with asses, and big tits over everything
She lick dick, put her lips over everything
She lick clit, but prefer dick over everything
I stay switching flows, with more bars than that nigga upstate that'll never get parole

[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm on my [?], go hard over everything
I sound like a boss over everything
I do it big, do it large over everything
You know the motto yo, bars over everything!
Bars over, bars over everything
Bars over, bars over everything
I do it big, do it large over everything
You know the motto yo, bars over everything!

[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm on my [?], go hard over everything
I sound like a boss over everything
I do it big, do it large over everything
You know the motto yo, bars over everything!
Bars over, bars over everything
Bars over, bars over everything
I do it big, do it large over everything
You know the motto yo, bars over everything!
