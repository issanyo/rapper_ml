[Hook]
Brraah, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill
Brraah, brraah, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill
Brraah, brraah, mothafucka I'm ill, mothafucka I'm ill, mothafucka I'm ill
Brraah, brraah, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill

[Verse 1 - Chubby Jag]
Time to let you niggas know
Every single bar full of crack, yeah this nigga dope
I get you niggas smoked
Clap until you down, in the Cadi and I'm laughin' at you clowns like you niggas jokes
I'm on top homie hit the flo'
Think it's good till that 'hood nigga disappear like Gorilla Zoe
Cali mad at me, niggas say I got a Jigga flow
Lil bit of Biggie in me, Henny in me mixed with dro
Chubby, yeah I stay in the streets
Speed passed, ski mask, yeah I'm blazin' police
Thank Mob Duke for raising a G
So I can cut a nigga off a D Wade team, wavin' the heat
Try beat me, niggas need a code
You fuckin' with the wrong nigga like Keyshia Cole
I'll buy the lot, you can't even lease the Rolls
Way below a bomb flow, probably never see the gold
Probably wonder why I'm fuckin' with Cass
Or why he fuckin' with Jag, got bars, both fuckin' with cash
Thats a bro though don't get it twisted out
Quickly I'll grip the shot, chh-chh, split ya top
I took all the shots you ain't even get the rock
Probably never come out, you're lucky if you get the flock
Yeah, point 'em out, I'ma fire hood
Labels tryna pay me to stay with mommy and Tiger Woods
Homie talkin crap, I'ma snap just like a liger wood
Homie say I'm crack from the jump, you can't deny he good
Cats so soft that you can't show off
And that gat go off in your back rolls off
That's my back down mojo
Trust if I run out of bullets, we gon' turn this into Pacquiao, Cotto
I'm livin' a movie, this is an outtake
I'm ill, probably never get cured, I got the outbreak

[Hook]
Brraah, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill
Brraah, brraah, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill
Brraah, brraah, mothafucka I'm ill, mothafucka I'm ill, mothafucka I'm ill
Brraah, brraah, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill, I'm ill

[Verse 2 - Cassidy]
I know you folks seen dope fiends
Folks scream they dope but they more like codeine
I know you bluffin' I'm Heron, you Robitussin
My punchlines disgusting and my flow mean
Ayo my new hoe so mean
That when I hit it from the back, I be tryna tap the whole spleen
I just like to hear a hoe scream
When I'm poppin', I be rockin' that thing like the Bo Dream
I'm fresh to death, I'm so clean
And you cats like black coffee, never had no cream
There's no team on the face of this earth
That could fuck with my family, we hotter than Miami
Beach, memorial week with my eye candy
We half naked, I talk reckless, they can't stand me
But I get it poppin' like Zanny
So they be like "Damn, he cute, he could get inside my panties"
I got my dick sucked and fucked, your son mad at me
I'm a Cadi truck and you a Camry, hand me
Any damn gun and I can shoot that shit
I'm a soldier, salute that shit, you a bitch
Anytime they play your song, dawg I mute that shit
Fuck you and the cat that produced that shit
Listen, I could put my hands around a niggas collar
Or whip his ass like his dad, make him get his father
In Philly, I got it jumpin' like Iguodala
I'm in the street, if there's beef you'll get devoured
'Cause your ride with a whole click of cowards
I could get you smoked and I don't mean piff or sour
I twist piff up and spit for hours
You cats washed up, hit the showers
Yo, my flow so hot I could melt plastic
I'm so sick, I'm a health hazard
