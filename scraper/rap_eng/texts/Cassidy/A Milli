[Verse 1:]
Them awards rappers usually bring home I ain't get
Cause I ain't shit and I ain't sell enough ringtones
You can't be the King on the throne unless you mess with males
I'm not a homo, so I don't expect to sell
But I expect to get respect f*ck record sells
If a nigga direspect me he can catch a shell
But for first degree you get the death penalty
Or life without the posibility
Dat mean death in jail, unless you tell
And rat on somebody else
And put ya body on somebody else yea dat'll probaly help
But if you snitch just body yourself
Put the chrome to your own dome and hollow yourself
Man my style so smooth dat my trial made the news
I came home and spent a couple hundred thou on some jewels
I'm a pimp, but I don't rock crocidile shoes
I pop the tool and make a nigga crocidile food

Yea [x2]

Wat

[Verse 2:]
I'm steady grindin, steady rhymin, steady puffin
Steady drinkin, steady thinkin, Steady hustlin
Chicks niggas trynna get I'm already f*ckin
I'm steady pipin and u steady wifin, steady cuffin
Dog you just barking, talking very tough and
Catch a case and start talkin like Teddy Ruxpin
Homey said he had a body but he probaly bluffin
He don't clap lead dat cat just a crackhead
An that sh*t right thurr leave cats dead
I don't fuck with that, I'm jus a haze and cognac head
I used to stack bread before the heads was that big
That's why you hear my music bumpin like blackheads
I don't think rap dead but cats just doin it wrong
I don't know wat be goin on when he doin the song
I don't why he even put that verse on the song
He probaly high and that shit he be doin is strong
He been moved out the hood he been gone too long
He don't know wats goin on that nigga cotton soft
But I'm from phila we really lettin them choppers off
U keep claimin u a hustler who you coppin off
Or who coppin from you wat you knockin off
U don't sell nothin but records nigga knock it off
Your girl mock me off yea I knocked her off
And ya'll start kissin like right after I dropped her off

Yea

The Hustler
