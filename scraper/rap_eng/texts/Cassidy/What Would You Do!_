[Verse 1: Freeway]
Forget Freezer call me Mr. Moves
Making I'm making moves
Blatant, take these hatin' rappers to school
The new KRS criminal minded, I am possessing a tool
I am possessed by the spirits of Langston Hughes
A true pioneer, I am here
Free At Last ??? rhyming
For those who thought rapping was a pastime, it's perfect timing
For me to flash my
Freezer ??? like a blood diamond
This is hip-hop rhyming, in its truest essence
'07 Roc-A-Fella veterans, in them new SS's
600 ???, who can do it better
I'm connected, got some new investors
'Bout to make niggas very jealous, ice on every litter
They say music is the root of all evil
But my music reachin' the people so you can say whatever
If you ain't talking 'bout that cheddar you ain't saying nothing
They say diamonds last forever, I'ma ??? forever
That's right, get cash forever
If a nigga come at Freezer I'ma blast my weapon
What would you do, if you was in my shoes
You would get cheese, young Free and Statik Selektah

Free at last

(Jadakiss)
But everybody got they hand in the pot
So either you cut them off or hand them a knot

(Cassidy)
Yeah, I get money
The hustler home, I know the game miss me

(Jadakiss)
But everybody got they hand in the pot
So either you cut them off, cut them off...

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
Ayyo, the pictures that I paint in the booth
Is like Michelangelo's when he painted the roof
I make classic masterpieces and my chain flash
Like stained glass smashed to pieces
The strong gon' always outlast the weakest
And on your way to success, everyday is a test
It's like playing chess, with only half the pieces
You at a disadvantage and you playing with death
Better make your next move your best move
Cause if you make the wrong move, you gon' lose
There's a couple strong moves I been watching you make
But I seen a few too that could've got you in mate
Now I'm not Bobby Fisher or Joshua Waitzkin, but I'm great with the pen, flow tougher than snakeskin
And I roll with the big tote in the '06, so you know my beats is so sick
Cuz Swizz like the Quincy of his time, nothing he do garbage
And I'm a true artist like DaVinci in his prime
So if you need a track, he Peter Max, and yo, if you need a hot flow I'm Picasso, I need a plaque
My fever back, I spit with a throat virus
The most quoted, most recited, I get excited when I'm in the booth
I been the truth, so when I write it, it's crack just for saying this rap I could get indicted

[Outro: Cassidy]
Damn, damn
Cassidy, Cassidy
Freeway, Freeway
Statik Selektah
What up, what up
It's going down
Philadelphia, Pistolvania
Brrrtttt
We making history right now, this is beautiful music
At least I feel so

So either you cut them off, cut them off...
