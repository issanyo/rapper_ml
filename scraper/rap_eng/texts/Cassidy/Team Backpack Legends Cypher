[Intro]
Oh this it right here?
This the beat right here?
Yeaaaaaaah
Aw
Get ya'll phones out, ya'll gotta snap this, ya'll gotta gram this, is nothing but real bars
Heard Ghostface was here
Twista
Shout out to them:
Legends
I go by the name of Cassidy though
Let's get to it

[Verse]
My flow been ill
I never took it to the doctor before
I never had my own shoe in Foot Locker before
But I'm ballin
The streets rock wit the bull
My life a movie if I wasn't black I woulda won an Oscar before
Did you ever pop the chopper before?
My bull shot it before 'n' pulled his arm out the socket before
The chopper never played soccer before-
But it got kick though
Shoot to kill
Blue steel
But I ain't Crip tho
Clips no sell three
Go and buy six mo'
Then cook it till it oils no Crisco
And make the loot
I never hesitate to shoot I let a clip go
Quick as Eddie Murphie
'Member when he shot that bitch toe?
I ain't from the 6, no
I'm from Philly but I'm still wrappin raps back to back if I get dissed, yo
I started from the bottom
But now I'm on top'a niggas lists so I know they hate when I kill em with this flow
Just know I'm in the trap holdin' the key
Hold my own strap nobody gotta hold it for me
I was 15 on the strip with niggas that was 15 years older than me-
So you know Imma G
They say money don't grow on a tree-
But I think they all dumb
Cause I been, rakin it in when the fall come
I told my pac-boys trap till it's all done
But y'all betta act like y'all dumb if the law come
You catch a lil' case that lil' cake somethin' small son
Yes I always accept when that collect call come
I tell a hoe all tongue, no teeth
Take off my polo briefs then go so deep
I grind a whole week
I ain't get no sleep
I been up for seven days straight but I made cake
Yeah
And I microwave weight
Cook it up hard enough to make a razorblade break
Wait
I'm wrapped tight but I ain't wrapped tight
Yeah
Bring it back
Look
I rap tight but I ain't wrapped tight
Fire ya ghostwriter cause he ain't write yo raps right
We can rap fight or clap gats if you don't act right
How these niggas frontin' but they backbite
If y'all pussy, 'n' both y'all beefin, that's a cat fight
Don't make me get my dogs involved they take cats' life
I rap like I got an alien brain
I think alienatin' thoughts I take a L to the brain-
You can tell I'm insane
But I'm from earth I'll shit on you
I had a spaceship or two
Aliens could get it too
Listen zoo I'm from ins-

Yeah
Listen zoo I'm on the plane with the shit I grew
My homie work at TSA he let me get it thru
A brick or two, couple pounds, lots of pills
Same shit that got me rich coulda got me killed
I copped a wheel with no roof like a soccer field
The goal was to score and see green the scheme soccer still
I smoke cohibas on them poppy fields
Cause I got that hustler block appeal that papi feel
I'm forreal, you think an alligator brave-
I'm cold-blooded, fuck it throw me in an alligator cage
My patience short like alligator legs
Take the gauge and lay you out like alligator eggs
Of course my patience short like alligator legs
Take the gauge and lay you out like alligator eggs
I'on't wear suits, my shoes ain't alligator made
But I'm definitely a mack
And I definitely can rap
You need food for thought I got the recipe for that
To be the best in rappin' 's a necessity for that
Yeah there's levels to this shit but if you tryina get on mine?
You gotta get on yo grind you need equity for that
Hip-hop ain't dead and they respectin' me for that
My worst better than your best and the best of me is back
Facts
I'm on some back when I was young shit
Cause the radio keep playing that same dumb shit
That's that bum shit-
Cat's that can't rap run shit
But they won't cut no mo' checks if you protest
You enjoy hot and the boy not?
Boycott
Get that boy dropped put 'em in that unemployed spot
His girl enjoy cock
She let niggas with money from my team train her ass like Floyd's pop
Yikes
They like, 'When will the boy stop?
Yo, son is the greatest, he underrated'
You gotta be retarded if I ain't one of ya favorite
I was told that I'm the greatest alive by some of the greatest
Some of my haters
Transitioning now
Listenin' now
They whole perspective is switchin' around
Imma draw the line, if niggas keep fishin' around
Bitch yo'a drown be a body that some fisherman found
Clown

[Outro]
Bars
Yeaaaaaah
