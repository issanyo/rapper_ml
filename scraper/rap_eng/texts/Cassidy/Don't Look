VERSE 1 - KING MAGNETIC
I don't really give a fuck anymore, Never did Chinese kid kill every pho, I'm pushing 40 like an 80 cut in half, Had the molly rocking molly wop 'em on the math, They was popping tabs, Youngings pop and stab, You can get it all my nigga but not the cash, Baby mom's ass couldn't keep me in relationships, Then we took different color pills on some matrix shit, When I say took em, Talking bout juxxin, Charge different prices now we auctioning in Brooklyn, Y'all overlooking, White girl my best friend, I be in the hood but my parents live in west end, Built like a mountain avalanche ya chest in, Don't kill the messenger satellite the message, Handle every handle so I always got to stress shit, Get away with murder but average is arrested!

HOOK
Look - I told you don't look, Al Capone statue my stature a Stone crook, I'm the type of rapper that's savage they won't book, Things get out of hand your answer is don't look! Don't look, If I rob ya man don't look, If You don't pop the can, Homie can't catch Juxx, You don't understand what the plan don't look, Grown man where I be don't know don't look!

VERSE 2 - KING MAGNETIC
Oh my god, Niggas get religious, I robbed everybody but you don't get suspicious, Wifey like state parole she got conditions, Hit the lion share of my lair ya'll can split this, What's 29%, Multiplied by zero when you fuckin with my rent, Let's take a pole like we fuckin up a tent, Crash small towns with the double up intent, Rather have a killer than a shooter with attempts, Bent on point that's including the events, Face on the window like a temp plate registered, Mad bitches kneeling feelin' like an emperor, She ain't got to kneel, That bitch can sit down, OT is LT, Niggas just blitz now, Got a little work picking up a shift now, Most of my close friends looking like a Vic now

HOOK
Look - I told you don't look, Al Capone statue my stature a Stone crook, I'm the type of rapper that's savage they won't book, Things get out of hand your answer is don't look! Don't look, If I rob ya man don't look, If You don't pop the can, Homie can't catch Juxx, You don't understand what the plan don't look, Grown man where I be don't know don't look!

VERSE 3 - CASSIDY
I got too much crook in me, Don't look at me, Cook a key with my eyes closed what niggas took from me, Nothing at all they fuck with the law them niggas shook of me, I'm throwing slugs but I know the judge will throw the book at me, You just a rookie I got hookers throwing me pussy free, The chic that cook for me keep the heat by where her pussy be, King Cass got with King Mag, He came to look for me, He said he got some beats, some bars and hard hooks for me, You can look and see ain't a nigga alive cooking me, But it can get hot as a frying pan when I fry ya man, He just thinking bout tricking bitches and buying grams, Me I'm thinking about bigger business and buying land, Went from dealing weight to real estate getting building cake, I feel the hate but ya'll know the difference between real and fake, I body rappers when I'm rapping ain't feeling safe, And I conceal the 8 so don't look in a killer's face!

HOOK
Look - I told you don't look, Al Capone statue my stature a Stone crook, I'm the type of rapper that's savage they won't book, Things get out of hand your answer is don't look! Don't look, If I rob ya man don't look, If You don't pop the can, Homie can't catch Juxx, You don't understand what the plan don't look, Grown man where I be don't know don't look!
