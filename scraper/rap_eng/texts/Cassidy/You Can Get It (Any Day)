[Hook]
You want it? Then you can get it any day
You want it? Then you can get it any day
You want it? Then you can get it any day
'Cause I stays in the streets, 7 days of the week
You want it? Then you can get it any day
You want it? Then you can get it any day
You want it? Then you can get it any day
'Cause I stays in the streets, 7 days of the week

[Verse 1]
If you want it, you can get it any day (any way)
You better stay in this lane, 'cause he in the way (any day)
I give him every bullet in the k
Have the gun smokin' like a chimney when the semi spray
If he say that he nicer than me (he lying)
He act up and get hyper with me (he dying)
This nigga weak, it's like a sheep against a fuckin' (lion)
Only queers shed tears, why you fuckin' cryin'
I'll throw you off a plane while it's fuckin' flyin'
Watch you skydive and smack the ground like a hi-five
If it's beef like five thighs
Then I'ma go hamburger, and I'ma get that man murdered
Reach for the damn weapon to teach him a damn lesson
Blaze the Smith 'n' Wesson that can cave a caveman chest in
I've got an infection, I'm ill. Y'all can't rhyme
If you want it you can get it dawg, any damn time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm off the hook, like the choruses you hear
I'm off the hook, like a cordless to ya ear
I ride 'til the wheels fall off, but you know I brought a spare
I keep it pushin', I know you read the tortoise and the hare
But homie only tell lies
'Cause he'll only let a shell fly if he throw a tortoise in the air
Lead pop, head shots, now his thoughts is in the air
I shoot the heater, you can either be the corpse or enter cheer
Yeah, this man must've lost his damn mind
He only hang around pussies like a tampon, and he can't rhyme
I go to a sword fight with a hand nine
So fuck you, yo' mom, yo' pop and both of yo' grandmoms
A real nigga you will never be
So you can choose to pay your dues or get bullets out the Beretta free
Let's spray it out, it's whatever with me
I'll lay you out, have you looking like the lowercase letter t

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Life like a roll of the dice but you never seen me crack
Get cash and my chick ass extremely fat
I'm about to get my zucchini waxed
'Cause there's a lotta pussy here, so I'm on it I'm like bikini wax
I held my city down for years ask Beanie Mac
Ten straight summers, you fake. I hate fronters
I deal with straight numbers like a calculus class
And you just be talkin' shit, get ya mouth out ya ass
You ain't been through what I've been through
So when you spin through
I clap through the back window, put ya scalp on the dash
I don't care about the cars and all the houses you have
'Cause you a bitch, you should get a skirt, blouse and a bag
Cass iller than every fuckin' body
And I roll with killers, if you think you realer come and fuckin' try me
'Cause they won't hesitate
To hack a nigga with the machete and separate his lower from his upper body
