Henny and Bacardi, Henny, Henny and Bacardi
Henny and Bacardi, Henny, Henny and Bacardi
Henny and Bacardi, Henny, Henny and Bacardi
Henny and Bacardi, Henny, Henny and Bacardi

Henny and Bacardi, Henny, Henny and Bacardi (Yeah, get yeah drank on)
Henny and Bacardi, Henny, Henny and Bacardi (Yeah, get yeah drank on)
(Yeah, get drunk)

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Grey Goose or the Rémy, Bacardi or the Henny
Play the Gucci, Louis, Fendi and my Beamer, Benz and Bentley
And I just grab the magnum, but it ain't got no Henny
So if a nigga tempt me, I'm a squeeze it 'till it's empty
And while your jeans is skinny, his shirt is size mini
While you drawn I be like, "How you doing", like Im Wendy
See people wasn't friendly, when I ain't have a penny
But now I got plenty balls, and or course I got too many
You mighta won a Grammy, But you should win an Emmy
I dont use autotune, I use the auto on the semi
That purple got my sun roof looking like a chimney
I smoke 'till the stank gone, and me get my drink on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
Yeah all the ladies go crazy when they in party
Twisting plenty Marleys', sip the Henny and Barcardi
And I done drove plenty cars, Benzs' and Ferraris'
Beamers', Lamborghini, the Bentlys' and Bugattis'
Yo the chick that's with me that look pretty with the body
Tryna' find another chick so she can give me a ménage
Mami with whatever, hit me wetter than tsunami
She thicker than a Snicker, Im like give me the Punani
I know how much time they can give me for a homi
But I'll prolly' catch a body if a nigga try and rob me
I dont need a body guard, Bob guarding my body
I smoke 'till the stank gone, and me get my drink on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Im better than you yo, that's one thing I do know
You might be number two yo, but I'm numero uno
Success ain't about who the best, It's who you know
Yea you might have sold more records, but me and you know
I'm sumo, I hold weight, I could make a new flow
Every verse I put in work, this what I do yo
You know that I'm way better than you so
I'm way better than any rapper that you know
You know I rap about what I really do yo
And you know you just rapping, thats not you yo
I really go to the Hotel, but where you go?
I smoke 'till the stank gone, and me get my drink on
