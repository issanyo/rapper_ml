Sometimes we make wrong decisions that affect us
When we need em, They reject us
They say don't push that music, cos I'm on
Don't let em take u down when I'm gone
I know u can fight, cos u strong
Don't let em take u down when I'm gone
Go for gold, Go like green
Never stop, Never seize
Haters can watch, they never gone see;
That u flying, cos u gone

Chorus
U got million reasons to win. (Million reasons to win 2x)
U got zero reasons to fail. (Zero reasons to fail 2x)

I got million reasons to win. (Million reasons to win 2x)
I got zero reasons to fail. (Zero reasons to fail 2x)

Cassidy Verse

We've seen sunny days and we've seen rain too

But whatever weather we get, we've got cedar to get

See Bein' broke is just something I could never forget

Now that I'm fly And I can buy shit I never could get

I spend cheddar on chicks, But I was never a trick

But most hoes rather have cash instead of the dick

See I was never of blood, I was never of crip
But I always been a gangsta, I was never a bitch

I don't think you ever heard a flow better than this

I'm so great I hold weight like a pregnant bitch, about to go in labor

Pro niggas know I'm major, No one can save ya

Cause when I write I make the pen in my hand melt
That's why I got the damn belt

U're too young to give up son, u were made for greatness
Go for greatness, And always remember that the only time u fail is when u give up
So go son, Go for greatness
U've got zero reasons to fail
