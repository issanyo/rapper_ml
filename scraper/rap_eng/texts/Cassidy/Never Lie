Hook: CASSIDY]
C-A crooked letter,crooked letter I-D-Y the best you ever better die
C-A crooked letter,crooked letter I-D-Y the best you ever better die
No I ain't never lie,no I ain't never lie
No I ain't never lie,no I ain't never lie
C-A crooked letter,crooked letter I-D-Y the best you ever better die

[Verse:cassidy]
I seen some things some people never get to see
I sold drugs cause you can't get shit for free
Give a brick to me I'll show you how to flip a key
I dont know nobody that get rid of coke quick as me
I used to go through the drive-through at Mickey D
Now the chick with me feeding me chicken frickasy
I was grinding, now Im shining like a christmas tree
Yea I wear a lot of chains like Mr. T
See some haters said they getting sick of me
Now they talk about my accident I ain't let it geet to me
I suffered brain damage mentally and physically
So my recovery wasn't normal scientifically
I rap about guns but you should know my history
You might of seen what I done on unsolved mysteries
Misery love company, thats the reason why its a bunch of you, but theres only one of me
'Yall seen what I done to free, I never been a ginner, Im authentic not a wanna be
I got the top spot every body under me, if I ain't in your top 5 fuck it I dont want to be
Cause you dumb to me, nothing but an idiot, stupid, good for nothing, fucking degenerate
You been a bitch, trynna get tough, hold up
One combination leave ya whole shit swolled up
Some time I rap about god but so what
The lord open up doors nobody can close up
I started off at the bottom then I rose up
I only went gold, no I never sold much
But so what I ain't making no excuses
I needed beats but now you can't hate on my producers
Top notch finals, hating on the useless
Cause you know the ball sick, Im back on my bull shit
