[Cassidy]
If you down for me then I'm down for you
I'll lay a nigga down if he fuck around with you
And if you there for me then I'm there for you
Thru the laughter and tears I'll care for you
And if you ride wit me then I'll ride wit you
Stick by ya side and provide for you
And if you roll wit me I'll roll wit you
Be ya friend till the end and grow old wit you
Peep it tho, I'm a pimp and I keep a ho
I met this on the low freak bout a week ago
Yo I'm on the avenue, and she was walkin by
While I'm comin out the store wit a bag or two
Yo I woulda passed on her, but shorty had a ass on her
That'll have you spendin cash on her
I moved fast on her like come here boo
And she was nice from her shoes to her hair do
Bracelet was bright she had ice in her ears too
Type that you might make your wife in a year or two
Yea boo, you officially nice, thass why I'm tryna git wit you tonight, ima

[Cassidy]
Now when I got to the crib I was ringin her phone
Like I'm thinkin bout bringin you home
But thass not whut its all about, unless thass whut you make it about
