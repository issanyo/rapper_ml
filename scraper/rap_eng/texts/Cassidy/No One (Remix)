(Cassidy)
Pretty lady you so feminine
My adrenaline
Be racin, You be tastin like an MnM
You melt in my mouth and not in my hands
So I'm a put a rock on your hand
I'm playing to be swimming in
Your ocean and I'm hoping
We can get it in
Cause your pretty skin is vanilla mixed with cinnamon
But then again we might argue and fight
But I want you to be my wife
It'll be all right aight

I Just Want Chu Close
Where You Can Stay Forever
You Can Be Sure
That It Will Only Get Better

[Hook:]
You And Me Together Through The Days And Nights
I Don't Worry Cause
Everything Is Gonna Be Alright
People Keep Talking
They Can Say What They Like _let em talk let em talk)
But All I Know Is That Everything

[Hook:]
No One
No One
No One
Can Get In The Way Of What I Feeling
No One
No One
No One
Can Get In The Way Of What I Feel For You
You You
Get In The Way Of What I Feel For U

When The Rain Is Pourin Down...
And My Heart Is Hurting
You Will Always Be Around
This I Know For Certain
(oh my god)

[Hook:]
You And Me Together (you and me) Through The Days And Nights
I Don't Worry Cause (why)
Everything Is Gonna Be Alright (yeah yeah)
People Keep Talking
They Can Say What They Like (let em talk let em talk)
But All I Know Is That Everything Is Gonna Be
Alright

[Cassidy:]
Cutie you my real wife
This ain't a movie this real life
They could say what they feel like
But things still right
I feel like they can never ever break us up
And if I'm dreamin I pray they can never wake us up
They hate on us trying to ruin our relationship
They make me sick
But they can never make us split
As long as we conversate and straight talk together
We'll be together forever
Like salt and pepper

I Know
Some People Search The World
To Find
Something Like What We Have
I Know
People Will Try Try To Divide Something So Real
So Till The End Of Time
I'm Telling You their ain't no one

No One
No One
No One
Can Get In The Way Of What I Feeling
(you want the remix)
