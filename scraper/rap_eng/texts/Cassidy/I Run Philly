[Hook]
Killidelphia, Pistolvania
Put your bangers in the air
Yeah, I run Philly
I get it, yeah
I get it, yeah
I get it, yeah
I run Philly

[Verse 1]
All you niggas know I'm gettin' the bread
Cause everything I spill ill I'm kinda sick in my head
The gun I grip so big
Even if it hit you fingertip you'd be dead
But you get hit in your head, prrrat
Cause I ain't from the city of suckas
Philly is the city with plenty of gun busters
And I go by the name of the hustler
My life rough, but I seen niggas with rougher
Look, I'm not a lyin' kniever, I'm not a bluffer
I'm ballin', but be in the street just like the Rucker
And this nothin' new, this what I do
I blew then crossed over like skip to my lou
So you could bet it all in a battle, I never lost
Cause I was never soft, I'm a predator, I set it off
You know the feds involved when sprayin' the lead involved
But I'm marryin' my gun, I ain't callin' the weddin' off
Never ya'll, cause my fiance my gat
And you can say we been attached since way way back
It's like I can't stay away, every day I'm strapped
They say the MAC go prrring, but the K go prrrat
When I was locked in the cling you was better off
Whatever I said it dog, it ain't nothin' to set it off
And if it's beef, it ain't nothin' to let it off
Big, small, short, tall, I'm like it's whatever dog
I'm a boss, I got cheddar to floss
I don't look at the price cause whatever it cost, I got it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ay yo I go by the name of the problem
I wanna thank my fans for supportin' my albums
Look, y'all went and got 'em, I appreciate that
I appreciate cats that appreciate crack, prrrat
I caught a case, but at least I ain't rat
I might not have went plat, but at least I ain't wack
Cause cats that be sellin' records sound pathetic
And cats that be movin' units sound foolish
And I don't feel I'm the illest, I'm just the truest
You rookies underground like sewage, I really do this
Been the coolest, been the flyest, been the smoothest
Been the cutest, but the meanest and the rudest
And I can fight in Philly, we fish users
But I just grip Rugers, split medullas
When I was in a coma, you was better off
Whatever I said it dog, it ain't nothin' to set it off

[Outro]
On my last album
Y'all know the hustler battled the problem
Now everybody battlin' theyself
Everybody takin' my dances
When I was locked up I used to be like, "Damn"
But now I'm this?
Come on man, be original
The hustler home, Larsiny Family
Full Surface, it's about to go down man
B.A.R.S. be in stores real soon
Scream at me, easy
