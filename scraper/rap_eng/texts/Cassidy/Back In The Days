[Hook] (x2)
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Philly where I'm from, but back in the days when I was a young boy
I had fun back in the days, when I was a young boy
I used to love Duck Hunt, I always was a gun boy
But now I got bills, I pay 'em, and here come more
I got one son and I'm about to have one more
These young acting grown ups, and grown acting young boys
If you a old man, what you tryna' act young for?
I know 30 ain't the new 20, I ain't a dumb boy
I did some crimes, and I'mma do some more
I slung raw, and my basement look like a gun store
I get it in, when I was young, I wanted to be grown
But now I'm grown, and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I used to box and shoot the cow
I was confused as juvenile
I used to vow, but now I'm non-violent, Martin Luther style
Cass got a swag, and I'm kinda cute to smile
Driving ladies crazy, but I'm hood like Coo Coo Cal
I ain't from the projects, but I got it jumping like Mario
Cause I spit fire, King Koopa style
I did better then most kids, I came up
So I try to go and coach kids, Mr. Cooper style
Tell 'em how I tryna' where another suit to trial
Cause that was killing me, I hope y'all feeling me
More money, more problems, more responsibilities
It's like when you humble, you get more hostility, (for real)

[Hook] (x4)

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Some days I just reminisce on my childhood
And wish I could have as much fun as a child could
I was wild bad, but turned out wild good
I ain't had a silver spoon, but made sure my child would
I'm a real dad that make sure my child could
Have anything he asks for, n' that feel wild good
We living in a wild world, and I'm from a wild hood
But now I got a wild crib with more rides then Wildwood
