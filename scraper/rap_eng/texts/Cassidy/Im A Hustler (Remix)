Check it, you can fear or respect it
I wanna thank Hov for clearin' the record
If you don't like this song right here, then your ears infected
You need to get your hearing corrected
Stones clear in the necklace, I wear so much plat on my neck
It put bruises on the back of my neck, that's why Cat's is upset
But I told you I'ma shine when it's time to
I put too much time and I been rhymin' since nine too
I knew I'm a Hustla was a hit
'Cause everything I ever got I had to hustle to get
Ain't nobody give me nothing for free
But I'd probably be dead or in jail if it wasn't for T
Gettin' booked is a bitch and catchin' a slug, scary
