[Chorus]

A lot of drugs gettin' sold
I just got off a roll
But I'm on the stove
Tryna turn a half to a whole thing
Nigga, I'm a goon
So I'm in the kitchen whippin' with the spoon
Tryna turn a half to a whole thing
Half to a whole thing
Half, half, to a whole thing
I'm whip, whippin'
Tryna turn a half to a whole thing
Half to a whole thing
Half, half to a whole thing
I'm in the kitchen
Tryna turn a half to a whole thing


[verse 1]

The stove lit
I'm tryna turn a half into a whole brick
I'm tryna hop in a new car and out my old whip
I'm tryna get my cake up
Break up, with my old chicks
Then go get a model and make her swallow the whole dick
I'm not gay but I fuck with some homo chicks
I give her whole dick bout long as a polo stick
I'm a true G with that Gucci and Polo shit
If I ain't in the YSLT it's LV
Drinkin' purple drink in that purple sneak, you smell me
I inhale tree and get high as David Chapelle be
I'm half baked
Cuttin up on a glass plate
Tryna make a fiend OD
Half to a whole key

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Yo, I'm tryna turn a half to a whole one
But I'll let you hold some
Empty out the whole trunk
First I'll choke you like Mauricio Shogun Rua
Then hit you with the Ruger
That ain't no fun
You don't want no war
You a young boy, I'm your old gun
You took your whole style
And I'm the nigga you stole from
You damn thief
I'ma knock out your damn teeth
I keep the pipe
But I don't street fight like Zangief
You a bitch
When you piss, you sit on the damn seat
I'm tryna get a thousand grams cheap
So my fam eat
I'm a hustla
I could sell sand to a damn beach
But my coke look like it got cooked in some damn bleach

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

I take the coker, a pyrex bowl, and some baking soda
Whip it, and give it to niggas that hate being sober
The wait is over, nigga, I'm taking over
I'm back on my bullshit so I ain't gonna bullshit you [?]
I'm the boy known to pull pistols [?]
And that's the truth too
I'll shoot you and the boy with you
I've been official ever since I wrote my first rhyme
Been a problem since I first signed with the boy Swizzy [?]
Back in 2000 they was like you wild
I had the greatest flow over a decade ago
Your latest flow ain't better than my old shit
That's why Cass tryna turn a half to a whole brick

[Chorus]
