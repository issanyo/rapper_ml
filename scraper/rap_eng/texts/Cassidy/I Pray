[Hook:]
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some cheese and get out these crazy streets
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some guap and get off this crazy block
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some cake and get out this crazy place
To get away I got to pray that it'll
Be all good if I get out this crazy hood and I pray

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I pray everyday for a better life
But it's never a night I ain't trying to get my cheddar right
Make it better Christ, I'm on both of my knees
I'm trying to stop copping coke by the ki's
Forgive me Father, but I got to keep a toaster to squeeze
I be stressing cause the blessings I'm supposed to receive
I ain't getting yo, I'm supposed to succeed, but I didn't yo
I didn't know, cause I was naive but now I'm getting dough
My song getting played, I hit the stage and spit a flow
Rip the show and make enough money to buy a brick of snow
I get to travel to places you never get to go
So I got to move from the block, I'm a lot richer yo
I'm a lot sicker yo, I make hits quicker yo
When I blaze the haze and mix it with the liquor yo
Niggas know to get cheese I need these streets
So I'm a stay, but I pray that I could leave these streets everyday

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shiz Lansky]
For a life full of transgressions, is Heaven harder to enter
Are the roads to the pearly gates, all for repenters'
Is the harder the winter, the harder the sinner
Lord I blow so much kush, the answers hard to remember
I'm a win the game hands down if y'all are contenders
Cause see y'all far from the real thing, see y'all are pretenders
I know I ought to go to church and pay my ties
But I'd rather play the hand I'm dealt and weigh my odds
But I drop to my knees, and I pray my God
That when you save my soul, you save my squad
Cause they some viscous killers that'll spare no life
They don't pray to Allah, and they don't fear no Christ
So don't where no ice, cause they'll run up and clap you dummy
Which proves my theory the route of evil's the lack of money
So that's the reason why I stack my money
I'm trying to move from these streets and concentrate on this rapper money

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Man it's Larsiny Family, and we all hood
If we all could get money it'll be all good cause
We all street, but we all deep
I'm trying to make more, to make sure that we all eat
Until we all fall, then we get fed
Then get bread, we hustling to try to stop suffering
Yea I put my L in the air, I got love for them
And everyday I pray that they stop struggling, for real

[Hook]
