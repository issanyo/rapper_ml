(feat. Mark Morrison)

Did My Time In A County Jail
Just When Fiens Started Goin There
And I Paied The Price For The Crimes I Did

[Chorus:]
I'm A Innocent Man... misunderstood
I'm A Innocent Man... just From The Hood
I'm A Innocent Man... misunderstood
I'm A Innocent Man... just From The Hood

[Verse 1:]
I Do The Damn Thing
Bezzel And The Band Bling
Sling Grams Spend 10 Grand On A Damn Ring
I Run Philly, I Ain't Tryin Be The Damn King
But The Damn Thing Can Get Pulled Like A Hamstring
I Use To Hang With These Niggas From My Hood Mane
Yea I Showed Them The World I Took Them Out The Hood Mane
Yea It Cost Some Cahnge But It's All Good Mane
Cause I Got Money To Burn Like Pack Woods Mane
And We Was Smoking, Joking And Poppin Bottles
Getting Open Storking Poking And Poppin Modles
I Was Hoping That They Could Get Paper With Me
But When I Start Gettin Cake They Start Hating On Me
They Showed Up To The Crib That My Mother Was At, My Son Baby Mother And My Brother Was At
And The Was Straped Acting Tuff And Start Busting The Gak
And Th Protect My Family I Start Busting It Back... bllllllaaaaakkk

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Jail Vecios It's Hard To Be Paitencnt And Stay Strong
When You Get Pictures Of Chicks Half Naked In They Thongs
The Anticipation Be Makin The Days Long
I Waited Cause I Just Gotta Make It Like Trey Songs
My Lawyers Could'ntLoose The Prooved The D-a Wrong
I Smilled At The Trial, Kept Cool And Stayed Clam
I Waved At My Mom And Swolloed My Pride Man
Them Guys On The Stand Brought Tears To My Eyes Man
The Stuff They Was Disscussing Was Notheing But Lies Man
They Said I Bust The Chrome At Homie That Died Man
I Thought Them Lil Dudes Was Apart Of My Squad Man
They Started Actin Up But They Musta Been High Man
You See That I Ain't Shook From The Look In My Eyes Man
But Being Booked Was A Blessing In Disquise Man
I Needed Time To Get My Life Organized Man
So Everything That Happend Was Part Of My Gods Plan

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Involentary Manslaughter Just Porole
I Spanked The Murder Like A Bad Ass 6 Year Old
I Knew That I Was Gone Be Rich Since I Was 6 Years Old
Now I'm The Richest Rapper Under 26 Years Old
So It's On Now, I'm Home Now It's A Celebration
I Got My Drink And My 2 Step Cause I'm Elevating
I'm Gettin Hela Cakin With The Number One Record
But I'll Still Bust My Gun If You Come Test It... yea

Change The Life... that I Live
Got Me Living Fine... negative
Is The Game... destroying Me?
So I Pray To God That He Has My Seed

[Chorus x2: with Talking Form Cassidy]
Tea I'm A Innocent Man
They Tried To Give Me The Death Penalty Or Life Witout The Possibility Of Porole
But Thanks To God I'm Here Now
And I Wanna Say Rest In Peace To Desmond Hawkins And I Wanna Give Respects Out To His Family Cause They Didn't Have Nothing To Do With It I Apologize But You Really Can't Knock Me For Riding For My Famliy Cause You Would Do The Same... fa Real
