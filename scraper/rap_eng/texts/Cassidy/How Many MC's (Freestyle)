(Intro)
This hip-hop right here
Duck down
I know all yall young bohl don’t know what the fuck this is
But I’mma bring it back to life
Let’s get it

(Verse)
How many? I’m not gon allow any-
Body they come try me, I’m wild, you crowd friendly
I’m probly on the molly, that loud and wild Henny
Who better? Nobody!
Like bitches that’s wild skinny
I shit on dudes, move all the bowels in me
I’m battle rappin like rabbit from 8 Mile in me
Yea but I’m from Philly, I come from a wild city
Since a child they was like "Shorty wild, his style gritty"
Now I walk around with the 40 cal semi
If it’s beef grip the piece that could make a cow semi
You guessed it, I’m not the one to mess with
I could grant it if you got a death wish
I’m finger fuckin the gun, the trigger getting sexually molested
Get the message, not Twitter, nigga I’m reckless
I get rid of niggas spittin stuff like this
So how many MCs must get dissed yo?

(Hook)
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
These niggas must get dissed

(Verse)
Every song I drop – they call it a diss record
‘Cus the bars so hard that rappers feel disrespected
I’m the truth, prick just accept it
You can never call my bluff like ya phone got disconnected
I picked ya bitch up and stripped her naked
She got my dick erected I put on a Magnum so my dick protected
I made her cum so many times I broke a freakin record
Man I had her wet as the Niagara
I popped a molly but she probably thought it was a Viagra
The bed was more than soaked, you would think her water broke
When I beat she came quicker than a quarter note
I pound, I put my sons and my daughters down shorty throat
Every song that I record is dope
When I rhyme my rap, cats be like ‘let me sniff a line of that’
Ain’t nobody got time for that
They be sayin ‘Lord Jesus has survived’ every time I rap

(Hook)
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
These niggas must get dissed

(Verse)
These rap cats better play dead
‘Cus if I snap and kill you on a track you gon stay dead
I got a hot flow, I jumped on Picasso
And niggas tellin me that I sound better than Jay did
Yo I say punch lines that’s unforgettable
So me dissin you will make yo life miserable
What you tryna get into? I ain’t hospitable
But I’ll spit at you and hospital you
Now they admittin you and I say you cuz you in critical condition
Now listen to these next two syllables
Fuck yall! Ya fuckin bars is pitiful
If I ain’t rap cats wouldn’t have shit to listen to
Even ya fans getting sick of you
They be tweeting you like ‘Damn! I ain’t bullshittin! Bull shit on you’
I don’t care if we get along or not
You pop shit then you gon get dissed in the next song I drop

(Hook)
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
How many MCs must get dissed?
These niggas must get dissed
