(Verse 1: Jag)

Chubby, I be ballin' I got mean game
But got bills, I'm always needing cream mane
Stash get low, I'm in the bank with the thing mane
Mad scope but na I ain't Bruce Wayne or Dean Cain
And I ain't Liu Kang or Ving Rhames
So no I don't know karate baby boy but got a mean aim
I'm straight real all these other niggas fake as hell
Spit I can tell you about bars like I escaped from jail, Killed Tracks
I bet you snitches can't wait to tell
Certified try and check my weight I'll probably break the scale
Niggas sooner found in line homie keep the hating
I'm bout to drop after Cass and the streets is waiting
Chill if I think that you can fight like when I see you're asian
Then fuck boxing nigga heat is blazin' he amazing
Chubby, They don't wan't let the guy shine
I'm in that Royce, but I ain't 5'9"
See I'm a boss nigga read between the guidelines
I'm prime time nigga all you do is ride pine
I give you one shot two shot three shot four of dem
Shoot and don't leave until the morgue start exploring him
We in here, hit the A&R's we need more of them
Try and get stupid rich a mill will still poor to him
Crazy with the it ins money got me buying shit I know I can't fit in
That's just because I like the whip
I'm dark skinned ya'll you know I had to light my wrist
Dumb good I rap like a nun would, nice as shit
Since a youngin' I was pipin' chicks
You couldn't mack the bitches already fucked in your nicest fit
The newest king and I'm coming for the ring Frodo
I'm on that ass like a chilo go poppin' shit
Hot as shit, bless you just acknowledge it
He movin' them ostriches
Plus keep two in the Glock to spit
Caveman jewels gotta chain to put some rocks in it
Turn into a theif and I will turn into Stojakovic, Jag
I'm gettin' money and my bread up
I wear shit you can't rock
You can't cop so you fed up
And no I never had relations with the feds but
My 5-0 a make yo head bust stiff and rotten
Fuck the law and fuck ya'll we can get it poppin'
Niggas drop and die or get killed homie pick a option
Ya I'm hot like slaves when they was picking cotton
But I was pimpin' pickin' breezys before this shit was poppin'
I gave her dick and knocked the bitch unconscious
So you see now
She wit you for the rebound like Dennis Rodman
I'm in the Maybach tv watchin'
And I'm talkin' bout the CD droppin'
I can't see me stoppin'
I'm in the strip club breezys flockin'
Bitch's asscrack beedy poppin'
See I got hella cake
We made men see us celebrate
That car jet away
Watch money elevate, Chubby
And I ain't sweet
I ain't homo I ain't eyeing dude
But try and move look stupid see this iron move
I ain't a hater what you tryna' prove
I'm in there buying shoes
Shining on the island with my diamond jewels
Fuck with me I can triple what you tryna' move
Take your cake throw you in the lake you be pyranha food
I'm from the streets but I be rhymin' smooth
Old School glasses got the bitches yellin' chubby lookin' kind of smooth
This gettin' money shit is kinda' cool
Me and Cass chandelier shoppin' buyin' houses with designer pools
And to the top where niggas tryna' move
You wanna play, you must be tryna' lose, I'm standing in Obama's shoes
And for them Presies nigga triggas will blow
It's the flyest fat nigga you know
I'm that nigga you know

(Verse 2: Cassidy)
Your heart pump fear you look scared every time I see you
You're see through and bitch I'm the shit nigga Pee You
I'm a gangsta I do the shit that a G do
I'm not Omarion but stay with the K like B2
You can't run I keep the hand gun with me to
The Desert Eagle will blow your mind like SP do
I gotta eat and got kids I gotta feed to
I'm in the street like Swiss Beats I got keys to
I get brain like an SAT do
Your girl tongue be licking the little hole that I pee through
My jury make ya rum colder than MR. Freeze do
But I spit hot as the liquid that killed the T to
Don't go to Philly less you need to
Cus they a kill you dog thats why Vick play for the Eagles
It's like watching a state property sequal
My young gunner kill you for free like B Siegel
O he a spark it crack your head wide open
Clap lead make you die with your eyes wide open
I'm high smokin', drunk drinkin' and hungry eatin'
Me being nice is the only reason that homie breathing
Homie even open his mouth I'll have my homie squeeze
A homie bleed a hole in his head it's over he dead
My bars go over your head cus you don't know much
You never sold coke or sold smoke to fill up no dutch
They say I rap about guns to much but so what
If they had a gun class in school I would've showed up
All my fans like damn man what's the hold up
We need to hear the message
You left the game slowed up
I know but I'm better than ever I stepped my flow up
I signed at 17 na mean I had to grow up
I'm niggas favorite but my business wasn't situated
Fuck if niggas hate it I refuse to get manipulated
A decade a nigga waited but a nigga made it
Soon as I walked in the strip club it precipitated
Ya thunderstorm my dick they jumpin' on
After a couple lap dances, your couple hundred is gone
I love hanging around woman with nothing on
Cus I been a pimp ever since I was fucking born
Lamborghinis Ferraris a couple hundred a jawn
And what the fuck you niggas doin, you fucking drawn
When I was in the county jail if a nigga act a
Fool I'll lose y cool and then smack the
Shit out a nigga
Get niggas to kidnap ya
And stab you the fuck up for a couple suits and some backer
I stay high and I'm fly as a high jacker
And I should be in everybody top five rappers
Cus I ain't just rappin' that shouldn't happen
Let's get it crackin'
Like chiropractors and poppin' like firecrackers
I spit fire I really inspire rappers
And I'm in the street, I should've been one of the wire actors
HAHAHA
A lot of rappers can't stand me now
Cus I'm better than every rapper I stand around
My new chain the same color as a banana now
And you got on your man watch, that's a handmedown
Yo I'm the CEO of Larsiny Family now
When I'm a family man trying to hold my whole family down
I'm making money, take it from me I don't think so
My hammer blaze like the man I made on Saints Row
Crystal head vodka, the cup where the drank go
The dutch where I put in the haze and that shit stank yo
Some niggas stupid, they don't think yo
So I keep the AK-47 like Kirilenko
Even niggas in Utah know I'm to raw
And all you a shoot is a cue ball, screw ya'll
Who ya'll, nobody man I chew ya'll
I'm the best that mean I"m way better than you are
Ya I'm the truth and you a fraud
You a broad the new version of RuPaul
Man I see right through ya'll
