The Diary of a Hustla
Yeah

[Verse]
Don't believe this nigga hustlin', this nigga bluffin'
Look him in his eyes, the only time he cookin' pies is in a kitchen oven
He a born liar, I'm on fire like the piff I'm puffin'
I'm hot so I'm 'bout to blow, volcanic eruption
This dude fake so his fake ass betta break-fast 'fore he get his food ate like a Egg McMuffin
He ain't the only nigga fuckin' that chick he cuffin'
Yup and homie dick ain’t the only dick she suckin'
I'll scrape his wife, but I'll take ya life
Cause she could barely take the pipe
She told me I need a dick reduction
I'm so official
I let her blow the whistle
Then send her home to you so she can kiss you
That shit disgustin'
Niggas frontin' like they straight pimpin'
I take women to the telly and get it jumpin' like Blake Griffin
I'm on point like Chris Paul
When she taste that Ace or that Crystal, she cut like a jigsaw
The kid ball, so you mad as fuck
But I let the gat blow at yo afro, give you a Cassie cut
I'm tired of rap niggas actin' tough
Yup, I rap but I been actin' up since I came out my daddy nuts
I’m on my grind, I do not sleep
Too much adrenaline, my heart pumps insulin, bitch I’m not sweet
But you a sweetie, you got diabetes
So you easily coulda died, your sugar high
I rap a verse, if that don't work I'mma cook a pie
Or try to make a dollar bill sellin Molly pills
Even though I know that somebody will prolly squeal
I'mma still push weight like a nigga that body build
And everybody real, they say they trigga blow
But I doubt them niggas know how catchin' a body feel
If a prick say that he don't snitch, he prolly will
Snitchin' on my clique will prolly get somebody killed
For real
I’m placin a damn order
The next day that saw comin across the damn border
You ain’t seen the shit that I seen
There’s a big difference between gettin a man slaughtered
And manslaughter
And you don't want them goons kidnappin your damn daughter
Tyin yo damn son up if that money don’t come up
I'm tryin'-I'm tryin' come up
So I run around from when the sun goes down
Till the fuckin' sun come up
Them Molly crystals fuckin' my damn tongue up
And the dutch that I'm puffin'
Fuckin' my damn lung up
But don't compare me to these young bucks
That ain't done much
After we lock ass
I’ll whip they pop ass
I’m your old head, you better show respect to me
Definitely, 'fore I give you pussies a hysterectomy
Ayo, none of these rap niggas could mess with me
Them niggas is my sons, I'm 'bout to get a vasectomy
Punchlines is my specialty
Ever since I learned my ABC's
Them C's couldn't F with me
I'll pop ya ass, but I don't mean sexually
Cause my trigga finger itchin' like it got a STD
All my lyrics is dumb
You niggas pussy
I'll put a hole in you, make yo period come (Haha)
I still pop shit, say a lot of hot shit
I got hits, I just ain't poppin 'cause I ain't got Swizz
Shit, I chop bricks
I can't give you stock tips
But I can show you how to cut keys like a locksmith
Pot whip then go to the block with rock bagged up
Make the junkies grab up, then make yo money add up
Yup, I wouldn’t say I had bad luck
But bad things can happen to good dudes doin' bad stuff
But I never been shot or got stabbed up
And even when I ain't had much I was still swagged up
But you can't judge a book by its cover
That's why I put together the Diary of a Hustla
You can't-You can’t judge a book by it's cover
That's why I put together the Diary of a Hustla

[Outro]
I've been in this game for years
But I'm feeling better than ever
I'm in a whole 'nother bag right now
I'm real cocky with my shit
Cause I know niggas ain't fucking with me
I produced this track and I just tore that fuck apart
Y'all niggas better show me the respect I deserve
'Fore I smack the shit out of one of you niggas man
You already know what I'm reppin'
Larsiny Family is in the buildin'
Philly pistol venge is in the buildin'
Shout out to my nigga Bishop
Shout out to my nigga Chubby Swag Jack
Shout out to my nigga Ar-Ab
And shout out to all the real goons in the street that got respect for a nigga like me
