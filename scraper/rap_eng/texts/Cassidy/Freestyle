{Cassidy}
Yall already know what it is
Lets get em

Tha block pop so tha strip full
Rocks-got a fist full
Bull pop shit that hot shit I got a clip for
When I start sparkin' it be barkin like pitbulls
Matter fact rottweilers when I let them shots holla
Chicks on my cock
I'm still on tha block holla
Its cops on tha block, they still gon cop holla
Ock I got cents and that's why i got dollars
I was told tha rules
I'm old school like my pop father
I was showed tha moves
Schooled by the older dudes
How to show and prove
So I move like a soldier move
Real militant
I'm ill, still killin it
Im real guys thats paralyzed thats still feelin it
Yea im still on my feet and my toes
Gettin higher than tha presidential suite at tha nose
Gettin higher than tha nose bleed seats to my shows
F**k a Maybach I play tha back seats of the Rolls
F**k a GT I pull up in CLS
Tha butt soft like my females breast
Is it a V12?
Yes
I cop the uncoppable nigga
You can't stop the unstoppable nigga
I pop a shot threw u niggas
And I was like a Pop to you niggas I gave you a flow
Adopted you niggas
I did alot for you niggas
And this tha f**kin thanks I get?
You my son you should thank my dick!
You take my shit, flip it around and now you think you sick?
I guess you think you Cass but I think you trash
And I'a spank dat ass you ain't f**kin wit me
You wouldn't even rap like dat if it wasn't for me
Wow
I been had my weight up
How you gon battle me wit a style dat i made up?
Wow
When I'm home it's envy
I'm feelin like tha boy Pac when he was on tha phone wit Biggie
Wow
What tha f**k is goin on out here?
What tha f**k is niggas doin out here?
Niggas drawn out here
Ya block hot, I put a jawn out there
My block hot ya shit warm out there
So we goin out there
Set up shop and get it on out there
Pop shots and get it on out there
I'm on point like a thorn out here
Come to philly I'm a don out here
Yea you know I'm a boss dog
Nah diss ain't izod, it's lacrosse dog
I floss dog and I stay wit my juelz on
You probably wouldn't see this much ice in a hail storm
Its nuttin to flash but f**kin wit Cass a get you bucked or bucked and a half
'cause its only a handful of rappers thats touchin the cash
And most of them getting f**ked in they ass
The snakes up in the grass
But Cass gone blast when the beef is on
I walk wit the shells and i ain't got no adidas on
And I squeeze tha join' even when tha law watchin
I'm too hard, tha rap version of bernard hopkins, nigga...

Cassidy, bitch!
Scream at me
