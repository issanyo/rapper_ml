[Intro: Mya + (Cassidy)]
Damn baby
(Wassup with ya)
I really didn't wanna believe it, but you know
(What, what you talking about)
It's all good, I guess a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do right
(A man gotta do what)
I mean you you couldn't just wait like 3 more days 'till I got back to town
(I don't even understand)
Should have known better
(What is you talking about)
You went behind my back and you had to mess with something like that
(Awwwhhh man)

[Hook: Mya]
My love grew to hatred, your love is not the (??)
I've been rehabilitated
You had a real woman, but you ain't appreciate it
Why you cheating on me with a girl like her
My love grew to hatred, I know you and me
Shouldn't be affiliated
I just really want a boy, (??) what I made it
Why you cheating on me with a girl like her

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
The first night was a love at first sight
I liked you when I first saw you, when I first called you
The first conversation was making my blood boil
So now you gonna get spoiled, enjoy it cause boy loyal
You a beautiful rose that grew out of some bad soil
Any place, anywhere, I don't care, I'm here for you
Them girlfriends you got, they really don't care for you
They just trying make up shit to ruin our relationship
But think about it, what they shouting out ain't making sense
They just hating, tryna break us up, but I don't take offence
They hoodrats, they the type that'd take the Benz
But if I'm lying, you can lock me up and take my keys

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I can't lie, was a pimp, yeah I had a squad
That's why I never been married, never had a bride
But look ma, that was the past, you don't have to cry
You're financially stable and you sexually satisfied
The ladies always be on my feast
But don't believe what they be putting on they Twitter and MySpace
Why you hate me, cause a little rumor started
Is you retarded, that's just what they do to artists
I'm the hottest rapper out, them mother dudes is garbage
That's why the ladies love me, but I want you regardless
The girl they say I'm cheating with, I ain't sleeping with
The media say I'm creeping with every girl they see me with

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mya]
And now I understand if you just wasn't ready
But all you had to do is just be honest and tell me
That you needed some time
Tell me space (??) and have fun
Why did you take into eat or two
Said it's not the fact you cheated, it's the fact with who
That's why I'm so heated
And I was so disappointed when I finally seen it

[Hook]
