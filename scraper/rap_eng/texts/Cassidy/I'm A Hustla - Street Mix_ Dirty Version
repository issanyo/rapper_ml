[Verse 1 - Cassidy]
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey

I got the product, narcotics for the customers homey

Fiend's open they be smokin like a muffler homey

Niggaz phoney so I only got a couple of homies

If you a hustler I could-I could fuck wit you homey

You spend a couple of bucks I'll stay in touch with you homey

I get money I get 20 a K, I got 20 strips all doin 20 a day - ay!

I get cake from buds and haze I'm makin dubs

They hatin cause I'm on the grind like I'm makin love

Wit cops got the block hot like a Jamaican clubs

Cop wait, wait for a drought and then I make a flood

Try to take my cake you gon' take a slug

But you can take my information if you takin drugs

'Cause I could sell Raid to a bug

I'm a hustler I can sell salt to a slug, 'cause

[Chorus - Jay-Z]

[Verse 2 - Cassidy]
I'm married to the game, same bride just a new groom

I do more then just do tunes

'Cause my bills come in too soon, my son gon' be two soon

Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon

But I'm gettin my dough from doin shows

I made more dough on the grind than goin' gold

That's why I stay fly and I'm flagon on hoes

Floss is so cool, in Austin no shoes

Just a rubberband on my wrist no jewels

I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool

I know the rules and, I ain't got time for it

But a nigga will shine, when it's time for it

And they will hate you deal with the real cake

And they on the corner from mornin to real late

I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me

I'm a hustler ask about, ask about me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Cassidy]
Yeah paid you got saved don't be spend the change

In fifth grade I was hustlin my Genesis games

I was dumb young sellin chewin gum to my classmates

On the cash chase movin at a fast pace

Never been a dummy never did what the dummies do

So I had a mill' to burn before I turned 22

"More money, more problems" is true

Because the more money I make, the more problems for you

Yeah I used dude voice props to the boy Shawn

He made it a hot line I made a hot song

So, stop drawin man you got to respect it

I'm the best Swizz got to perfected don't mess wit

C-A-double-S-I-D-Y

'Cause I became the best when B-I-G died

The Kid do it big like P-U-N

'Cause I'm nice P-A-C with the P-E-N, and

[Chorus]

[Outro - Cassidy]
This for all my niggaz that's goin through

The struggle that's on the grind

All my niggaz that ever had to hustle to get at a dollar

This for y'all man, personality change, man

He Kid Cassidy, this for the hood {*echoes*}
