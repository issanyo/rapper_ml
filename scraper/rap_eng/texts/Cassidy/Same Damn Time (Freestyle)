Wearin’ Polo, wearin’ Gucci, at the same damn time
Gettin’ head, eatin’ coochy, at the same damn time
Smokin’ kush, smokin’ sour at the same damn time
Sellin’ hard, sell powder, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
Countin’ money, twistin’ green, at the same damn time
Drinkin’ liquor, sippin’ lean, at the same damn time

[Verse]
If y’all try to rob be, got to shoot me first
The gun is under my Gucci shirt
The boy a G, I got a ho with me
And she keep the heat in her Gucci purse
I got dough to give, yea yo to flip
And I might throw the dick in this groupie first
I like the bitch cause her coochy squirt
I'mma hit it, I’m lickin’ that coochy first
Chicks like me now and they wipe me down
I might go buy a Free Boosie shirt
I'mma pipe it down till that coochy hurt
I'mma hit but I’m gettin’ that coofee first
I’m on the strip with that fish scale
This raw, we call that sushi work
A closet full of that (Gucci)
Li-like the adlibs in a Gucci verse
I I I sling bricks they can’t flip
The same shit that got pookie murk
I’m a G but not on that gang shit
That’s the same shit that got tookie murked
I’m a Gang Starr like Guru
With the seaman freezed that’s true blue
You cheatin’ on your boo boo
But your girl cheatin’ on you too
I said I wanna fuck you, boo
And she said I wanna fuck you too
But all you can do is give head tonight
Cause at a red light I’m like soo woo
I I I ain’t gotta front
It’s a lot of things I want
So I’m grindin’, t-tr-tryna do a lot of things at once
