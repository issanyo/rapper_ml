[Hook: Naila Boss]
Your all I need that's all
I'm addicted to your laugh, your love
But when you leave, I don't feel withdrawls
Because I'm addicted to your laugh, your love
I'm addicted

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I was driving down Nice town to pick up Keyshia
And I almost crashed when I passed this chick named Rachel
She ain't have a ring on her finger but really faithful
To some big bully, but I'm really getting cake too
Mami a hottie, gotta body and a face too
But she tasteful, I could probably give her fellatio
She had a ass that'll probably intimidate you
But I called her like Rachel, come here, don't make me chase you
She stopped and said Cass', "I always wanted to date you
Since the Hotel video I wanted to rape you"
Boy I wanna taste you" I said, "Well we leaving"
And I took her to the top floor of the Four Seasons
And got right, that twat tight, I know you feel me
She was like, "I'm dying, you are trying to kill me"
I made her cum so many times, I feel guilty
I hit it, now shorty addicted you figure, feel me?

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
Chicks is addicted to my dick, they can't leave that
Like a crackhead need a hit, the chicks need that
Diamonds is a girls best friend, don't believe that
Dick is a chick best friend, better believe that
It's diamonds on my wrist, neck, diamonds on my hand
If I'm your best friend, you could get diamonds and a man
But Pam say she'd rather have diamonds then a man
And she'd rather use the rabbit than put time in with a man

[Nalia Boss]
Well a vibrator's safe then grinding on a man and I'm disease free
I don't use condoms on my hand, understand?

[Cassidy]
I said, "Yes Pam I respect that"
But if you take a chance with the boy, you won't regret that
She thought for a while and smiled like

[Nalia Boss]
"I accept that"
You can get the wet cap, but you gotta protect that

[Cassidy]
Pam I protect myself, don't even sweat that
I hit it now shorty addicted, she always check that

[Hook: Naila Boss]

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Yo my love like a drug, she addicted to me
She addicted cause I'm hittin' it ridiculousy
And she know that it's a lot of fish in the sea
But I'm a fisherman, I reel in every chick I see
She addicted (I'm addicted)
She addicted, she addicted, she addicted (I'm addicted)
She addicted, she addicted, she addicted (I'm addicted)
She addicted, she addicted, she addicted (I'm addicted)
She can't quit it, cause she addicted (I'm addicted)

[Nalia Boss:]
Definitely wanna love you 'til I overdose
I'm up for aquatics, it's like I lose control
Never go away promise me you'll stand beside me baby
And even if you ever get locked up, I will come and set you free
Baby I'm all you need, more then a regular chick you see, truly

[Hook: Naila Boss]
