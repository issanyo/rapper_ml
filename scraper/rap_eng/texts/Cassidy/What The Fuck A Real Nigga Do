[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I've got grams of white, that Vanna White
Get a tan of white if you can stand the price
The ice in my watch is rocky, bright like paparazzi camera lights
Bitch I grip that hammer tight
If cats ever try to rob me dog
I'm a probably clap my shotty off
The gat I pack is my bodyguard
Dome shot get bodied dog
The chrome pop and your body fall
I'm cold but my nose ain't snotty y'all
I'm with a chick, tits bigger than a volley ball
I'm a probly break somebody jaw
One punch and this over with
Jump up to punch with both my fists
Like both your eyes and bust both your lips
I fucked both your chicks and they both was thick
I had both my hands on both their tits
They had both their hands on both my nuts
I made both the sluts deep throat the dick
I got coke to flip, I'm movin' drugs
You using drugs you smoke the shit
I was broke as shit till I moved around
Then move the pound like who smoked the shit
Got a half brick of that coke and shit
Got a whole slab of that dope n shit
I push weight than my back is sore
What the fuck is y'all boys strappin' for?
You pack the gat, you never clapped before
What the fuck is you wastin' that ratchet for?
You wack and you never spit crack before
You cats is weak so what you keep rappin' for?

[Verse 2: Chubby Jag]
I run the point, nigga I'm pass the rock
Feel so out of this world from the outer space but I ain't no astronaut
Can a nigga come and cook jab if a bitch look bad you know I had the pop
Grab a Glock. Just in case a nigga wanna hate and I had to blast a shot
Yea, told everybody this nigga don't play
Known to call shots, tell the nigga ok
Stabbed in the pussy, you nigga so gay
My eye on the throne, no Jigga no Ye
Now chill, you see a nigga though
Probably why the haters wanna steal a nigga show
You got that dirt and I got that work
If a nigga need a job betta let a nigga know
Chubby, yep, I do this easy ho
You don't wanna see me get greezy ho
Oh you think you ballin' ha?
Got the boy feelin' like jeezy huh
Real and you better believe me ho
Make the ball work like a sissy ho
I'm out block anything, go with the ho
Get your bitch took like Yeezy ho
Hope you niggas know, nigga getting' dough, Mr. Hityourho
Girl popped, nigga wanna shot, nigga hit the flo'
My plot nigga dumb hot niggas flip the nose
I don't wanna talk about bars I be spittin' those
Man I thought you niggas knew
Since I'm here you nigga through
Fuck with him and his niggas shoot
That's what the fuck a real nigga do
