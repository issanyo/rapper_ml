Hook:
I only wear my clothes once every day I get some more
And Nike same sneakers before they hit the store, look at him
Nothing less, nothing more
I'm happen out the coop I spit about a hundred for, look at him
I got a house by the shore cast in the condo
On the tiffin the weapon floor, look at him
Nigga look up to the hore and chicks wanna hook up with the ball
Look at the ball, look at him

I had to switch my language, rapping each style
Cause I'm rich and famous
People keep telling me the streets is dangerous
It is what it is man I keep my stateness
My new ranges is awfully gorgeous
I'm a damn..logic paying the mortgage
The poor rich yeah I'm point like a selfish just look at him
The ball I bullshit, yeah I had to switch my accent
I'm rich like the lady great mister Jackson
And I don't think the police can stop me from trapping
I'm getting rich on the street making transactions
Selling crap that's what crack
That's why my pocket is fat like re-running that's what's happening
These other rats killers and the buff but they rappin

[Hook:]

I had to switch my sling up
Sign a new record deal step mark game up
It's like the media be tryin fuck my name up
Cause I remain famous the shit won't change up
I just cup the new watch my chain up
So happen in the rain just tryin to step my aim up
Lost in the family we fucking the game up
Y'all look at me, they came up yeah I had to switch my style up
You want a high verse I'm the person to dial up
You bring tone rappers and hard enough
We got enough bars you might been shot before
But they ain't get shot enough
Time you ain't got enough rhyme so you out of love
My money all but I still grind like I ain't got to bug
You're grindin in the coop but your roof ain't gotta cut
My head bar yeah I'm ross the cocking up
