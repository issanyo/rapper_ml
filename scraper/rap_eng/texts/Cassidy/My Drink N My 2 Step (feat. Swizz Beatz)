[Chorus x2]
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patrone on and tell them that it's on

I got my drink and my dutchie
I just be the murda
People think that I'm lucky
My link lookin huskie
Get stoned
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patrone on and tell them that it's on

Put the smoke in the air and get stoned
The lips sittin' on 2 6s the lips chrome
My money used to be immature now my shit grown
Big wheels big chromes
I'm doin' it big Homes

It's on, it's on, it's on the kid home
Get tell the patrone on and tell them that it's on
I do my 2 step
And let the link swing
Hold the drink with the left hand and show the pink ring(bling)

[Chorusx2]
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patrone on and tell them that it's on

Ay, yo, they wanna be like me
Recreate my flow, immitate my flow, the relate my flow
By while they try and take my flow I make my dough
Ay, yo, I can make it rain, 'cause I been making it snow
But yo, I been takin' it slow I wasn't around
But the car crash couldn't lay the hustla down
Na I'm still here for real, I'm still here
It wasn't looking pretty, but Swizzy I'm still here
They said I coulda been brain-dead in a wheelchair
But I'm standin' in the booth and the skills are still here
Yeah, the hustla home, the hustla home
Let's celebrate a toast with a cup of patrone

[Chorus x2]
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patrone on and tell them that it's on

Yeah, yeah, put your dutch in the air
Smoke haze, let the smoke raise up in the air
You might have seen me in the guiene at a couple of fairs
The engine in the trunk the doors go up in the air
Yeah and I been gone for a couple of years
I done sweat I done bled, shed a couple of tears
I ain't stressin' it's a blessing that the hustla here
Let's celebrate a toast, put ya cup in the air

[Chorus x2]
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patrone on and tell them that it's on
