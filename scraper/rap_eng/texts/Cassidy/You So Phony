[Hook]
If you in the industry, you ain't my homie, motherfucker
Cause the industry is full of phony motherfuckers
Real niggas in the industry is lonely motherfuckers
Cause the industry is full of phony motherfuckers
You so phony (Who so phony?)
Homie, you make me sick cause you as fake as it get
You so phony

[Verse 1]
Homie, I'm official, you a gimmick
You a snitch, just admit it
You a bitch, switch your image
Real rap, real cats is hard to find in the business
I was taught to keep my mind on my business and mind my business
Cause you dudes fake
For that food on your plate, get your food ate
Delicious! You niggas soft like Martin mama biscuits
I buck shots like BDP, my heater squeeze
I'm cold with the Tommy -- if you try me, you could easily bleed
What came first, the weed plant or the seed of weed?
Put a Magnum on when you smash a jawn or get Eazy-E
Time ticking
You can't judge a book by its cover
But motherfuckers know my life story non-fiction
Your punchlines fiction, my punchlines sickening
I'm legendary; my parents rap, it's hereditary
The greatest line you could ever say, I done said already
If I ain't the best, then whoever better is dead already

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You gotta watch the dudes that move with you
Cause your worst enemy will front like he cool with you
My only friend my gat
Cause cats act like they your friend then stab you in the back
Now, what type of friend is that?
My friend a rat, I'm not defending that
I ain't into that
My friend a snitch, I'm ending the friendship
It's a Reynolds Wrap
When I rap, cats get intimidated
I renovated my flow so niggas could imitate it
I been your favorite
I used to cut so much coke that I'd been a razor
Now I got pull like slot machines -- you ever been to Vegas?
The Hustler been hustling since the beginning stages
I rent from Avis or Enterprise and go get the pies
Hit the road, come back to the kitchen stove and whip the pies
Break it down, bag it up, add it up and then flip the pies
Forget the lies -- coke to broke folk is like shit to flies
Don't let this business get you hypnotized

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Homie, I just took a pay cut
When shit hit the fan, I hit my man that's moving weight up
To get my cake up, I take a bitch that got some A-cups
Then stuff her bra with the bricks
Now she got some bigger tits
That's the best way -- TSA don't even frisk the bitch
Cause now she got some double D's, titties worth a couple ki's
Loafers with the double G's, jacket worth a couple G's
I hustle trees cause I made a dub off a couple p's
Trust and believe, I'm in the mood for some new bitches
Dude, you sent the bitches I got nude some nude pictures
In this crew business, I ain't got no homies
Cause niggas so fake, so phony
I'm so lonely

[Hook]
