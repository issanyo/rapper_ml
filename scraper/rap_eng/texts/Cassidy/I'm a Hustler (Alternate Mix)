[Chorus - Jay-Z]
Nigga ask about me nigga ask about me
Nigga ask about me nigga ask about me
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey

Nigga ask a... nigga-nigga ask about me
Nigga ask a... nigga-nigga ask about me
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey
Nigga ask a... nigga-nigga ask about me
Nigga ask a... nigga-nigga ask about me
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey

[Verse 1 - Cassidy]
I'm so nice that I'd bet my life I guess I got gambling problems
You scramblers can't handle the problems
STOP, I win a lot when I bet so I spend a lot
The rocks on my neck they weigh more than a cinder block
To move forward I had to guard and defend the rock
And I got more blocks than a center got
Shaq style the gat loud when I send the shots
If it's drama I'm like Dahmer do dinner ock
Cause you's not no contender ock
I make um sick to they gut when I pick up the pen and jot
I grind all summer hustle all winter ock
You working wit a bird or two, you still a beginner ock
They bring the ships in when I cop
Scarface got 'em for 14/5 I get 'em 10 a wop
It's cake around break it down get 10 a rock
My click switch shifts at 6 and 10 o'clock
I'm workin with the raw dog and I be in the spot
You working with the law thug you should of been a cop
I don't care if you've been shot or been to the pen or not
Pussy I'll pull it, give you a bullet in a box

[Chorus - Jay-Z]
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey
Nigga ask a... nigga-nigga ask about me
Nigga ask a... nigga-nigga ask about me
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey
Nigga ask a... nigga-nigga ask about me
Nigga ask a... nigga-nigga ask about me
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a-I'm a hustler homey

[Verse 2 - Cassidy]
You a bitch ass nigga, snitch ass nigga
I'm the type to get cash quick fast nigga
Cass is a rich ass nigga
I got it on smash I make hits and your shit trash nigga
Maw you ain't hot at all
So when the media asks if I fuck wit a lot of y'all I'm like not at all
The last cat I heard rapping I knotted off
So I ain't fucking with nothing if I'm not involved
My one liners make rhymers need Tylenol
And I've been sick with the hook since I wrote "Got it All"
For Kiss and Eve, I flip the keys
I got 20's of the Christmas trees with no sticks and seeds
That'll get you higher than a motherfucker
I'm a pretty type guy flyer than a mother
I'm a hustler wit talent and a plan
When I perform it's more than 10,000 in the stands
I been getting thousands for the grams
That's why I'm on the cover of the Source with 10,000 in my hand
The reason I be smiling for my fans
Is because I ain't trying lose my deal like I'm Dylon from The Band
Man, these niggaz acting like thugs, but they ain't never squeeze
These niggaz acting like bloods it's cause they ain't never bleed
We all dogs I'm a better breed; and you can't say
That I don't come back to the hood cause I ain't never leave
And shit change, shit the same wit this cheddar cheese
I just cop betta coke and smoke betta weed
I'm single so I get the hoes that I want
I had the #1 single and went gold in a month what you want
