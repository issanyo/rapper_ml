[Hook]
Baby, do you understand now? (YEAH!!)
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But, don't you know that no one alive can always be an
Angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1]
I'm from the streets if it's beef I don't wanna talk
The gun'll spark it'll make you do a summersault
Then back hand send me when I clap the damn semi
I spark steel that'll have you doing cartwheels
I give your man the Tony Starks grill
Then show your homie how getting stabbed in the fucking heart feel
I ain't box in twelve years but I'm sharp still
They can't stand me I never lost like ya man Manny
Pop yow pop pow you I'm mad nice
You seen B-Hop last fight? That's how Cass fight
Jab Jab, right, left hook, uppercut
I broke a couple knuckles in the past I fuck you up
How you a gangster, when you ain't kill nothin' but a couple bugs
You ain't bussin' slugs you a fuckin' nut
And you ain't never been fuckin' tough
But try to front like you a fuckin' goon yo you fuckin' up
Ten years ago I prolly would've stuck you up
You always been pussy man and you was never pushin' grams
It's a recession yeah I know how shit lookin' man
But I follow the motto you gotta keep it pushin' man
Ay yo I been in the studio cookin' man
Look when my shit drop the top spot tookin' man
I don't use auto toon I don't sing songs
I'm King Kong I just body everything I'm on
And everybody still fuck wit everything I'm doin'
If you think somebody better than me, then bring em on
Lets get it crackin' I been rappin' my whole life
When swiss said that I was a problem he was so right
Life rough and I'm hopin' everything go right
I hope that all these other rap cats could get they flow right
My flow tight like them clothes niggas been wearin' lately
So I don't fuck wit none of the stuff I been hearin' lately

[Hook]
Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
