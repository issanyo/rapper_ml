And my chicks get it hard, get it all night
So ladies if you wit me say alright (Alright) say alright

'Cuz if we don't do that then it's a wrap baby
So if you from the gutter where you at baby (Oh yeah) where you at baby

We all gone shine when the time right (Alright) so get ya mind right

'Cuz you ain't gettin' fed like you should nigga
And that ain't good nigga
This for the rock hustlers

And in the jails are my cell block hustlers
And most cops just wanna knock hustlers 'cuz they not hustlers

Man you gotta work hard for a meal homie
Man cats still hungry wit a deal homie, and that's real homie

[VERSE 3]
I was born in Philly
We really get it on in Philly
If you from where I'm from I know you feel me
I'mma rep where I'm from until they kill me, until they kill me
And this for N.Y
It's like my second home when I spin by
And them ATL niggas show me love too
They ladies act crazy when the club do, show me love boo
This for my collie cats
My Baltimore stashin' the ollie cats
From Florida back up to D.C
And Virginia sendin' love when they see me, and that's for GP
I send the rest out
To any other place that I left out
From the north to the east to the west south
Cassidy gone rep 'till he repped out, until he repped out
Yeah yeah

[Chorus 2x] (Swizz Beats)
To my ladies around the world, world
To my thugs around the world, world
I do this around the world, world
You can't miss me, I'm comin' through
