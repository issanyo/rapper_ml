To my supa fly girls, all around the world
Shake ya ass in the club, make it twist and twirl

And ya shinin' (Shinin' like lipstick!)

(Jazze Pha + (Female))
To my fellas in the club, if u ya know ya fly
Put some cash in the air, and wave it side to side
Ya so beautiful (Boy ya know ya doin it)
And ya shinin' (Shinin' like chrome rims!)

(Cassidy)
Im shinin', doin it big
I spend more time in the club, then I do in my crib
The kid is a ladies man, but I get called shady
'Cause im alot of ladies man
And I can't be commited to none, I hit it and run
With my hand glitter, and I get ha to come
I floss on a chick, put the frost on her wrist
My diamonds shinin' like the gloss on her lips
This Frankie B, thanks to me
When we get to the bar, all drinks is free
I own the party, 'cause I chrome the Farrari Maranello, in this canary yellow

(Chorus)
To my supa fly girls, all around the world
Shake ya ass in the club, make it twist and twirl
Ya so beautiful (Girl Ya so Beautiful!)
And ya shinin' (Shinin' like lipstick!)

(Jazze Pha + (Female))
To my fellas in the club, if ya know ya fly
Put some cash in the air, wave it side to side
Ya so beautiful (Boy ya know ya doin it)
And ya shinin' (Shinin' like chrome rims!)

(Cassidy)
To all my chicks thats strippin, makin the cash
Thats beautiful, keep on shakin ya ass
Even though you get naked, and you takin it off
You be rakin in the cake, when they be breakin you off (PUNKS!)
Now where are all my girls in school?, You will lose in this world if ya girl a fool
You need brain in ya life, some change in ya life, some cognac and champagne in ya life
Or you might need a working lady
You go girl!, twist and twirl twerk it baby (LADIES!)
We all gone shine tonight, get blind and have a good time tonight, right!

(Chorus)
To my supa fly girls, all around the world
Shake ya ass in the club, make it twist and twirl
Ya so beautiful (Girl Ya so Beautiful!)
And ya shinin' (Shinin' like lipstick!)

(Jazze Pha + (Female))
To my fellas in the club, if ya know ya fly
Put some cash in the air,and wave it side to side
Ya so beautiful (Boy ya know ya doin it)
And ya shinin' (Shinin' like chrome rims!)

(Cassidy)

You can't help but to notice the chain, Ching! Ching! (Bling Bling)
In my fist it bling, I just gave a chick cold sore when she kissed the ring, sing
I got girls all around the world, Dog i'll hit i'll get around ya girl
Don't take it personal though
'Cause i'll look good, and im good person to know
So Pop ya bottles pop ya E's, and I got the dutches got the trees
The kid, get his jig on bumpin and grindin'
And I hit the hotel, with a slut and a condom

(Chorus)
To my supa fly girls, all around the world
Shake ya ass in the club, make it twist and twirl
Ya so beautiful (Girl Ya so Beautiful!) (Come on ya'll)
And ya shinin' (Shinin' like lipstick!)
