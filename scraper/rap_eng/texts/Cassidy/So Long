[Intro: Raekwon (Cassidy)]
Yo, Cas' what up son? (What's going on, Playboy
I was looking over there) Yo, I got me a good one and all that
What's up with you? (Oh ok, ok, you know I got me something
Lovely too, you know how we do it) You know how we that, man
Super official, right? (All day, if it ain't official
I ain't fucking with it) That's right, son, (Hahah, yeah) real

[Chorus: Mashonda]
So many nights I felt crying (can't get you off my mind)
All this time I felt like dying (love's so hard to find)
So I, had to move on, yes I, had to stay and strong
And I, got to keep it going, so long, so long

[Cassidy]
It's usually the beauty that attract me
But perhaps she was the right place
And her personality made me happy
And that's why I persued her, I'm a dude that make manuevers
If I choose her then she whipped, cuz my dick as long as a ruler
She made me kinda crazy, it's cool, as long as I school her
I'm smooth as Grand Puba, and I can charm a computer
For us to converstate, all it take to make an impression
Like a teacher lecturing, when I'm speaking she taking lessons
But everytime we argue and fight, I feel I'm dying
I feel like kinda tell you the truth, you feel like I'm lying
But I'mma move on cuz I'm strong as ever without you
I can do better, but I can never forget about you

[Chorus]

[Raekwon]
Aiyo, I laced you with the girl brittle shoes, when was young
Doing your thing, I want that and fire, buying the businesses
Queen in the temple, with the scent of a lemon
Ordering Lennon shit, at time, I'm just deserving your living
With all that long hair, sexy little walk in your thong gear
We at the car, you all up under my arm, where --
We shopping, embracing you with locks, and Glocks and Timbs
Flying from Africa, yo, back to the block
We just a sah-dodja, that's why your ones is owes up
Just when I needed you, you'll never get frozed up
A laced out lady with taste, I got to just taste your face
Keep it underground, and peace to the breaks, one, one

[Chorus]

[Cassidy]
Without her being crazy depressent, they say her body perfect
But her honey burst the complexion, close to perfection
Plus you got a body that can probably turn a gay man straight
You stay in shape, mami, started taking karate
So while she did her bid in the gym, running the treadmill
I'm running from feds still, keep one in the head, still
I be reminiscing, boo, whistlin', that's real, real
Is you nice in the bed, and you nice with the head skills
You awfully fine, I can't get you off my mind
I ain't frontin', yeah, I lost a dime
But you crossed the line and made me follow directions
Gone, getting back together is out of the question, I've moved on

[Chorus]
