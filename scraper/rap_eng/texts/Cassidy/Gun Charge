(Chorus)
Gun charge (gun charge)
Dope Case (dope case)
Couple lawyers
I'm in that money race
My niggas good
Stacking that paper
Benjamins in my pocket
Hundred racks for the haters
Yeah
Gun charge (gun charge)
Dope Case (dope case)
Couple lawyers
I'm in that money race
My niggas good
Stacking that paper
Benjamins in my pocket
Hundred racks for the haters

(Verse 1: Compton Menace)
I had a gun charge and a dope case
They know my money good
My Lawyer run a race
He preachin' about that shit and I'm sippin' Mascato
He talkin' bills while I'm inside clubs poppin' the bottles
You see my bitches my bitches look like they strip
My bitches like that water I whip em till its the shit
If I'm whippin some it's the shit
Hoppin out with my chick
Tear that ass up on the whip and call that shit ride the whip
Now I'm flippin O's I got em
Keep a pistol I pop it
Keep it gangsta can't stop it
I'm runnin round with fat pockets
And I'm reppin' shit when it go down
The whole west coast is my part of town
Cause it goes down
You throw the six up
And this fo' pound make ya bitch up
(It's The Menace)

(Chorus)

(Verse 2:Cassidy)
Now I ain't tryin' to catch a gun charge
But always got my gun dog
My Squad in the ghetto with more metal than the junkyard
I'm not a punk dog
I'm a menace to society
And Menace he'll ride for me
Give niggas a colostomy
Bad Cass give that ass the business if you bother me
Cause I go hard like niggas in the business of pornography
I'm bout to send this bitch to get a bottle of Ciroc for me
Then twist up a big dutch of broccoli
Copy me?
You can come and cop from me
I got it for sale boy
I sell more coke than folks do life in jail for
But I ain't tryna go to jail boy
What you think I go the lawyer number on speed dial in the cell for

(Chorus)
