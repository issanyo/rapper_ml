[Hook: Meek Mill]
She ain't never seen a nigga so fly like me
Know the swagger so mean and I ride like me
I'm fresh ya I'm a cool dude
I be getting that money them bunnies be like who are you
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I I I I I

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm in my bag no ain't I
I know you mad ya hater
Remix I see the way just like a navigator
Ridding past you all in the Aston color mashed potato
Sitting all on that butter shitting like none other
Pull up to the club niggas they show me love
Pockets be on dub my watch it be on studs
Them haters be like uh, them bitches be like ya
Yellow diamonds in the Breitling looking like beer
I'm in my bag like Santa
Diamonds flash no cameras
White prada can't stand us
Got your chick at the tele and she wilding Nick Cannon
Throw the op to Omelly and he probably gon' slam her
Like score, cooler than the shore
Smoother that Velor
You was a loser from the door
I take the groupies on tour
Fresh but my jewelry [?]
Tell the haters calm down cause the Ruger on pour

[Hook: Meek Mill]
She ain't never seen a nigga so fly like me
Know the swagger so mean and I ride like me
I'm fresh ya I'm a cool dude
I be getting that money them bunnies be like who are you
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I I I I I

[Verse 2: Gillie Da Kid]
I be in my bag my misses be in her's
So when we hit the club all the other bitches stare
I pull up in that Bently, fold off in it
Outfit so fly know I spent a good penny
I'm fresh see I'm a cool dude
Them bitches looking at your like who the fuck are you
Them women Gillie I'm staying close to you
I'm like ok fuck it I'm leaving with both of you, let's go
Pretty little things fresh out of college on it
Bouncing that ass like it's hot [?] on it
Bout to wax that thing let me put some polish on it
I killed this beat go and throw some flowers on it
I came in the door I said it before
Never ever will I ever spend a penny on a whore
Never will never take sand to the shore
I'm fresh out the lab know that boy got his swag

[Hook: Meek Mill]
She ain't never seen a nigga so fly like me
Know the swagger so mean and I ride like me
I'm fresh ya I'm a cool dude
I be getting that money them bunnies be like who are you
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I I I I I

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Yes, you know how we play C8 double s
Cut the check nigga see my neck and say what the heck
It's nothing less I wear nothing but baguettes
But I VVS the necklace I'm a fucking mess
Don't make me jump in my bag I'm too fucking fresh
No lie I'm so fly I need a fucking [?]
Look you not a crook this real life not a book
When I see I go on my bag it's not a pop up book
I don't [?] first with the Gucci or Prada
That's for girls they ain't even through so that's not the hook
I could on my bag and show you how the chopper look
I could then pass it too my man like pop it Mook
Or pop it AB, both of them popping off
They'll chop ya and burn your chest like alcohol
Unless you rocking the vest then they'll pop your skull
If you ain't me or Meek Millz you ain't hot at all

[Hook: Meek Mill]
She ain't never seen a nigga so fly like me
Know the swagger so mean and I ride like me
I'm fresh ya I'm a cool dude
I be getting that money them bunnies be like who are you
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I'm in bag no ain't I
I'm in bag I'm in my, I I I I I
