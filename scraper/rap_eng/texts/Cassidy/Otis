[Cassidy]
I'm so street, keep birds with no beat
Keep the piece between my jeans and polo briefs,
Don't flow to no beat if your flow weak
That's like wearing a mouth piece with no teeth

[Chubby Jag]
I be throwing bullets like, go deep
I clap mine, flat line, I'm hearing that slow beep,
My squad is in the spinning boy, you niggas is so cheap
With no heat, still be calling shots like Mo Cheeks

[Cassidy]
You so weak, so sweet, n' you don't shoot yo' heat
My yayo go cheap, I don't get no sleep
I told you I'd air you our like a slow leak
But now on my gat fire, flat tire

[Chubby Jag]
There ain't a cat flier, you niggas see the cheese
Lie, haters be wanting me to bleed 'till the heat is squeezed
Show me guap, nigga then I'll let you see the ki's
International player, we balling like the FIBA league

[Cassidy]
I got kids to need to feed, so I need the ki's
But the judge throw a book at you, you don't need to read,
Please, I stay in dirt like a seed of weed
But to start my truck up, you don't even need the keys

[Chubby Jag]
Larsiny, we in this bitch now, niggas need to leave
Apply Pressure 2 a niggas neck, he don't need to breathe
Feeling it, addicted to killing shit, gotta feed the need
I'll be quick to take a rat out, a nigga need the cheese

[Cassidy]
Nah'mean, scream at me if you need the trees,
Or the white bitch, I work the morning and the night shift
And Philly, I'm a wheelie like a bike trick
I like chicks that like chicks, but like dicks

[Chubby Jag]
Swear they don't do it like this, I'm on some ice shit
Cold, beat a nigga like night sticks, I write sick
Why I got the game in a tight grip
You nigga been done, you Vince Young, I'm Mike Vick

[Cassidy]
I drive all type whips, ice on my left and my right wrist
To open up my jury box, I gotta ice pick shit
I let the white flip, I don't just write hits,
I let the knife flick, and keep the pipe on my right hip

[Chubby Jag]
And for the right price, I can get you the right brick
White wrists, a plushed out house, and a nice whip
Hustled man chef, everything that I make good, bake good
You Mr. Go N Get It like Ace Hood

[Cassidy]
I'm from a get shot in the face hood
Get bodied with the shotty, shit you gon' need a bullet proof body suit
I'll fuck an ugly bitch if her body cute
If a bitch got tits, and a fatty, it get nasty

[Chubby Jag]
Tell 'em get at me, probs then I got to shoot
Yeah I got the work, and it's good, come and cop a few
Plus I got a crib, got a Jag, and a chopper to
A1, shit you selling ass, like a prostitute

[Cassidy]
And I'll let the chopper shoot if I need it to
I spit the stuff niggas shooting up with the needles do
To get some illegal money what you need to do
You can't judge a book by it's cover, you gotta read it through

[Chubby Jag]
Best out to me and you, winning niggas see the ring
Everybody on the squad, shooting niggas, we the team
Straight, all I run with is apes, do my caesar thing
Everybody watching the throne, should know that we the King
