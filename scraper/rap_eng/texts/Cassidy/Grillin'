Get put in ya place that look on ya face 'll get u smacked in it
Cuz u'z a fuckin clown And I don’t fuck around I’m abstinent
I got gats and im blastin it
You like a car with no gas in it
Cause you will never ride so all that steerin will cause an accident
You’re steering still, put your face on the steering wheel when that ratched spit
With the strapashit
Im goneyarich cuz im on the strip with that crack a bitch
Pitchin that white girl
In the kitchen whippin that white girl
I twist it up i hit the blunt then get so drunk i might hurl
Bout to get with these dike girls one white girl one black bitch
She not that thick her stomach flat but she got a ass like a fat bitch
Yup i like when she suck the pipe
While she gettin that cat licked
I'mma busta ass on that mattress
Then roll up a bag of that cat piss
This rap shit ain't hard to do i go harder than all u artist do
I grill u like a barbeque then cut your face like your barber do
When i call the crew u here gun shots them guns pop like your father do
I shoot you like a director dog
I ain't got no respect for yall
