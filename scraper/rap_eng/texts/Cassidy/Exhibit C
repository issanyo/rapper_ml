Call me Cass the hustler, or Cass the governor
Cass the motherfucker that gets cash from customers
Cass be puffin that smoke, call me Cass the muffler
Cass will cut your throat with the knife, slice your jugular
Cass to much for ya'
Cass is a couple of cars short from full deck, he'll break your neck
Cass will tussle ya, But won't Michael Buffer ya'
(lets get ready to rumble), Cass snuffing ya'
It's nothing to put up my hands and straight knuckle you, i'll ride out like a trucker do
You too weak for Cass i'll beat your ass if I don't fuck with you
Box you and knock you the fuck out! Chris Tucker you
You a sucker you do the shit that a sucker do
You a bitch just like your wife and she a sucker too!
I got my pipe sucked and fucked her too
While she still fuck with you, your wife is biting my peanut juice
She lick that hole I be peeing through
She said if you don't use your tongue she never cum when she sleep with you
She keep staring at me like the Mona Lisa do
She said she wanna go home and do what grown people do
"I cheat with you cause my man can't compete with you
You look better got a bigger dick and you eat it too"
True, I should be sleeping in a freaking zoo
This an animal you speaking too, I'll Ether you
You can get burned fast like a joint of reefer do, What you make in a year I make in like a week or two
I stay fresh like kids on Easter do, that's why i get more bitches than Queen Latifah do
Pounds of weed I used to keep a few, I made deliveries and made cheese like dominoes pizza do
Please, you say you touch keys like Alicia do, but only grab four and a half, we don't believe its true
I get Franklins like Aretha do, you be out on the strip just to keep your outfit and your sneakers new
[?] called me today and said what you waiting on? Swiss sent me a twit said what you waiting on?
Swiss without you they said I couldn't make a song, that's why i'm in the booth with a chef hat and an apron on
Even though I go hard like a park bench, i'm still fly like Clark Kent when his cape is on!
I'm the rapper that every rapper is hating on, cause I do it big like biz when he did the vapor song
Melo hit me every hour on the dot like "When you gonna drop that mixtape? you taking long"
Every time I turn the radio station on, all I hear is nonsense no lyrical content
I'm saving hip-hop go online and read the comments, I know it ain't my job to save it but I feel obligated
Listen my competition getting abominated, and the top spot spot is getting confiscated
It ain't complicated, ya'll ain't ready for this pressure we about to apply
(Ya'll ain't ready), we making hard for you rap niggas to breathe, (Larceny,)
