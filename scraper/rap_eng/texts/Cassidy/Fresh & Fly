[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I used to rob folks' striped Adidas, now I got three
I used to rob for his toes, now I rock True jeans
Dirty shoes all my life, but now them bitches clean
And I don't give a fuck 'bout money 'cause I know I'm fly

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bitch, I know I'm fly, bitch, I know I'm fly
If you know you fly, hands up in the sky
Bitch, I know I'm fly, bitch, I know I'm fly
If you know you fly, hands up in the sky
Bitch, I know I'm fly, wave them side to side
'Cause you know you fly, bitch, I know I'm fly
If you know you fly, hands up in the sky
And wave them side to side and say, "I know I'm fly"

[Verse 2: Kebo Gotti]
Bitch, I'm so fly, I nosedived off a building
This is no lie: Kebo Gotti worth a million
Money to the ceiling, I got my bank up

Never got my chain took, try to take my chain, bruh
I wish you would, you'd get Waka Flocka Flame'd up
Big truck, Range truck, I'm Cartier framed up
Y'all niggas broke, how could y'all blame us?

[Verse 3: Lil Capp]
I'm from College Park, Apple City
Swag to the max, higher than the pigeons
Hotter than the kitchen, got your stove off
I'm so ahead of you niggas, I done dozed off
Plus I stay fly, Monday through Sunday
Niggas say they took off, but they still on the runway

[Verse 4: Slim Dunkin]
Take notes, you will be fly like me one day
"Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaattt!" That's what the gun say
We here now, they let me out the shelter
We in the sky, you can call me Slim Delta
Take your bitch breath away, I'm so asthmatic
I can't stop balling, got a "spend cash" habit
Dunk

[Verse 5: Bama 2 Cups]
You say you super fly? Well bitch, I'm stupid fly
True ones and Adidas, got the heater if you wanna try
Grandma off the meter, kush reefer, yeah, I'm stupid high
Shoot me as I'm moving by, cruising on them 29's
Plug broke, I'm cooling out, I got them things for 29
We so turnt up, hit Nieman's and blow twenty pounds
Get it right back, got the pot once I spin it 'round
You ain't fly, sit it down, you can't even buy a pound

[Verse 6: Cassidy]
Dropped out when I left school
But I'm rocked out, keep that neck cool
'Cause I made a little cheese
Now I feel a little breeze every time my neck move
I go hard like dress shoes
Keep dudes in check like a Chess move
'Cause I'm always fly and I'm always high
That pack round just like jet fuel
Yes, I'm the best dude
I'm an animal and y'all pet food
I'm sleeping with your spouse
I treat her mouth like it's a test tube
'Cause I got major figures
You only had rock in your hand when you was playing rock-paper-scissors
Niggas
