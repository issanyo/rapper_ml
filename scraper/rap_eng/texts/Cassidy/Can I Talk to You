Yea I'm talkin reckless but you gotta respect it
Its in my DNA man, I was born to be a gangsta
Kiss talk to 'em man

[Jadakiss]
Yo, you know me K-I-S-S
Kiss of Death LP soon come for ya, bless bless
Metalic green paint on the Impala, the S.S
And I figured the more niggas dead the less stress
You love how I'm hurtin the track
You wanna polly but I'm sort of hard to reach like the dirt on ya back
Hand to hand like I'm workin the sack
And I work out on my arms, so I have no problem workin the mack (uh)
Neva been a toe steppa, side switcher
A fence jumper, I was ten wit ten pumpers
Hustled wit the best of dem
Did watever it took to make a quarter I charged niggas to watch wrestlin
I'm a heavy threat, D-Block, Double R, Full surface yall niggas ain't ready yet
YEA, NEW YORK IS MINE, PHILLY IS CASS
HOLLA BACK

[Cassidy]
You know me, C-A-S-S, fresh dressed
Just coped some new 4-5's and a fresh vest
I get scalp, cuz a bitch mouth is the best sex
But less talk, you ain't got no heart in ya left breast
Go head, get ya beef on
I let my wolves get they eat on
And leave you wit nothin but ya sneaks on
But it don't matter cuz ya feets gonn
Now thats restin in peices so go meet Jesus
You lil boys better ease up
Cuz them dudes you think hot, will see Cass and then freeze up
You wanna scrap? role ya sleeves up
But, I'd rather squeeze cuz I ain't trynna fuck my trees up
Or wrinkle my dickie, I crack the dutch sprinkle the sticky
I know you pissed, I got kiss and them wit me, dig me?
Cuz you dudes is haters
And if you bet that I was gonn flop, you gonn LOSE YA PAPER

Ayo, get it thru ya head it's no stoppin me
Nigga the "R" is Double, the Surface is Full, the Block is D
All it take is a trey 8 and a mask
Nigga its Jada and Cas I vision ya face, watin to blast
If money was food yall niggas be fastin
And we stuffin our face, we eatin wit passion
In the hood like we runnin numbers
Cass ask these mothafuckas why they runnin from us

[Cassidy]
They runnin from us cuz they petrified
I lift guns for the exercise
And I spray like insectosides
You bullz better recognize
When the weapon rise
You can catch slugs in ya chest thru ya vest and die
You on some sucka shit
So I'll leave a scar on ya face
Longer than the knife that I cut you wit
I done paid my dews
So I'll blow ya brains out
And then feed it to ya seed like baby food
