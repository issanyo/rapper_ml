[Hook]
I'm what you call a veteran
Y'all should call it off cuz all of y'all i'm better than
My flow dope, all my bars is heroin
And my tongue crack, the buls a barbarian
I'm undefeated, i'm getting better with every win
A loser just something i've never been
I've got a cemetery to get y'all buried in
Tombstone rap, the buls a barbarian

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Is you strapped cuz i carry two gats, they brother and sister
I call the sister Missy, I call her brother Mister
Got another sister, I call her Ms. Niny
Cuz brother Smith and Wesson spitting [?]
They kind of nice but Mister meaner
I fuck with Missy cuz Mister meaner better than her sister nina
Last time niggas seen her, she got trained by a gang full of shooters with bar hands and a bitches [?]
But they ain't silence her, all they did was pop her
Wipe her off then threw her in the back of the challenger
They cousin Tech said "Let's go dance"
He heard drums and started jamming, Techno dance
Man i'm the only human in my house, but missy and mister
Is having a family reunion in my house
I'm about to go ham in this verse
But I had to talk about that family first cuz family first
I can get your whole family murked, or call my Haitian bitch
That do voodoo and get your whole family cursed
I'm crazy with this shit, that crazy shit that I spit
Proves you can't get this sick without losing your sanity first
I don't need the chance to rehearse, cuz no flow tighter
And no ghostwriter never hand me a verse
I got this shit that work for me, I pay with xanies and percs
Fill a pocketbook with coke and put the can in her purse
Before the binge you might got to buy the camry first
Baby I been the shiz since I was pampered at birth
Dog I'm a boss cuz I put my hammer to work
To stop the blood a baby pamper will work
I'm on a strip with a baby bottle, diaper bag full of crazy pit
And the baby doll wrapped in a blanket I babysit
You a real tough talker but softer than baby shit
If i'm not your favorite rapper, you must be on Shady dick
Or maybe Kiss but big jif you got eyes
You can see i'm top 5
So fuck them niggas that made the list
Why you bitches getting paid to strip
I was in China eating chinese food with these twin Asian chicks
They gave me pics, caption "Black cocks matter"
Cuz after I gave 'em dick they think they ass got fatter
That was crack (that's a hot rap)
That's a fact, matter fact, nowadays the facts do not matter
We all got bladders, but I get pissed off quick
I cop up getting boxed up
The grower on my call list, I get that shit Fed-Ex
You like a fed-ex, you was fucking with the FBI
Snitch, lift they right hand and testify
They extra [?] they say time got 'em petrified
They scared, I don't fear nothing except for God
So if i come around tuck your chain, make your necklace hide
I wouldn't care if you left us bye
Or a bullet hole make you take your last breath
Hold your breath and die
Breath ease these bars will have you punch drunk
Play this record and drive, get pulled over and breathalyze
Yo my whole team I personally train
And I be giving work out everyday
You trying to exercise?
Cuz when you get your health up, you get your wealth up
Before you can help somebody else, help yourself up
Parents stopped beating they kids, they put the belts up
We used to get beat until we welped up
And it helped us
On any night I perform like Mike
I got that Tyson, Jordan, Jackson and Phelps touch
Yup, them niggas died they should of been in [?]
You beefing with any of them guys is genocide
I put my faith into God, cuz he bless me with a gift
And what was in the prize was an enterprise
I got a Jesus piece from my jeweler, then sent it to Medusa
And told that bitch "Look that man in his eyes"
Nah my rocks not costume but they bright
Like a bunch of stars that's in the sky was in disquise
Hotel drop I hopped on the women's side
Hustla was a hit cuz the husters identified
2 Step had 'em drink a Patron, put the Henn aside
My pen provide me proof I was sent from God
I ain't mad at the fact that you gay and you into guys
I'm mad that somebody writing 'em raps that you memorize
I've been deprived, I see an island ima buy soon
Cuz I had 'em tuned in before iTunes
Off my shrooms, you can plan a trip to Mars
I'm high off the moon, I'm really dancing with the stars
I'm from another planet with the bars
After this verse I might have to get researched by NASA
These rappers an example of what goofy is
Nowadays these rappers more groupied out than the groupies is
Cuz first all he had was his man with him
And then he drop a hot song and every rapper want a gram with him
Nigga I couldn't picture that, with a filter on
He the cash cow, they trying to squeeze til the milk is gone
Money I like to keep y'all niggas might be sleep
Well say goodnight to this beat, cuz I just killed this song
