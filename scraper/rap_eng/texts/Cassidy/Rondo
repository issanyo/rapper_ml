I'm bout that,  niggas know the motto
You can it cheap homie if you know who I know
‘Bout to make it rain, get your poncho
Niggas start the trip in 9 zone man, Rondo
Rondo Rondo (I run the team) Rondo Rondo
(Ball for the green) Rondo Rondo
I’m known to make a swish I'm the man out this bitch (Rondo Rondo

Couple racks, nice whip
Blood would droll roll like a night stick
I’m talkin’ sides, I’m talkin’ left
I’m a star, blue chip
Bangin’ that Rosay, money make you come
Say your head dumb? Well bitch come give me some
Catch me in the club where them bottles pop
My goons packin’ more metal than Robocop
No pat downs, we pass security
So we can be a whole lot of foolery
I see a bad chick, I’m on the pronto
She’d better be a 9, Rondo

I’m ‘bout that, niggas know the motto
You can it cheap homie if you know who I know
‘Bout to make it rain, get your poncho
Niggas start the trip in 9 zone man, Rondo
Rondo Rondo (I run the team) Rondo Rondo
(Ball for the green) Rondo Rondo
I’m known to make a swish Im the man out this bitch (Rondo Rondo)

I’m ballin’ like Rondo, I’m on the grind yo
Tryna make a dollar out a nickel and a dime yo
That money on my mind yo, large car smaller than the condo
I put that on my mind yo
If it’s beef I left the 9 blow
Stay with the Heat like Alonso
Change your name to John Doe
I could I could box and I could rhyme so
When I rhyme yo you hear a bunch of punches like a combo
Yo you scaredy cats and I’m here to rob your scary ass
I wear the mask and ask where the cash
If your pockets fat like your Tahiry ass
I was grindin’ white from Limekiln Pike to Erie Ave
You could tell them grindin’ by the yella diamonds
From now on call me Canary Cass
Ain’t no bitch with me, plus I got a click with me
And my click strapped, big gats
Big max, Mickey D
In this world you can’t get shit for free
So I get the key and then whip the key
Bag the rock the pass the rock
Nobody got more resist than me

I’m ‘bout that, niggas know the motto
You can it cheap homie if you know who I know
‘Bout to make it rain, get your poncho
Niggas start the trip in 9 zone man, Rondo
Rondo Rondo (I run the team) Rondo Rondo
(Ball for the green) Rondo Rondo
I’m known to make a swish I'm the man out this bitch (Rondo Rondo)
