[Intro - Cassidy] (Mario)
(Aiyyo y'all ready man?)
Yeah I'm ready (Mario!)
Cassidy, 3rd Street, Full Surface (uh!)
(All I wanna do - is do me, feel me? c'mon!)

[Hook - Mario] (Cassidy)
Next time, y'all niggas try and compare me
Remember I just turned 18 (18!)
That means I got 7 years to catch up, so what's up?!
Next time y'all underestimate me (Don't do that)
Recognize I just turned 18 (I'm still young)
That means I got 7 years to catch up, so what's up?

[Verse - Mario]
I brush the dirt off my shoulder
Push through the city in an all pearl Rover
One day I wanna be just like my nigga Hova
But they don't wanna let me be
Haters they been hatin
Sayin what I can't be
But I'm a stay up on they bumper
Keeping the radios jumpin all summer
Having your girl screaming just to take a picture
I'm settin up my features
My bank account's reachin
And everybody's peeking

[Hook - Mario] (Cassidy)
Next time, y'all niggas try and compare me
Remember I just turned 18 (18!)
That means I got 7 years to catch up, so what's up?!
Next time y'all underestimate me (Don't do that)
Recognize I just turned 18 (I'm still young)
That means I got 7 years to catch up, so what's up?

[Verse - Mario]
This is a funny situation
These guys I grew up havin crazy admiration for
Got the feelin that I'm trying replace them
But that ain't the case
I'm in a whole 'nother place
Trying build my estate
I gotta keep my Nike's nice and clean
Keep the women up to 25 chasing me
Got Mr. Davis pushin buttons in the Captains seat
That means more dough before I'm too old
That they seen before

[Hook - Mario] (Cassidy)
Next time, y'all niggas try and compare me
Remember I just turned 18 (18!)
That means I got 7 years to catch up, so what's up?!
Next time y'all underestimate me (Don't do that)
Recognize I just turned 18 (I'm still young)
That means I got 7 years to catch up, so what's up?

[Verse - Cassidy]
Hey yo Mario!
Don't let em get you heated homie
Just only go harder
Let em underestimate you like you Antonio Tarver
Plus the dudes that be hating is as old as your father
You got plenty time, you gone get plenty shine
I don't pay 'em any mind
They been trying critcize
But you can't live your life through another nigga's eyes
I'm the best and you young boys know so
I'mma fall back and let my young boy blow, let's go

[Hook - Mario] (Cassidy)

Next time y'all underestimate me (Don't do that)

[Outro - Cassidy] (Mario)
Yeah! I told y'all don't underestimate a young boy
Yeah! haha, ya heard me?!
My man Mario coming next!
(Next time - y'all want to compare me)
(To somebody else, haha, hey man let's get out of here)
They already know what to expect (we're not done!) one!
