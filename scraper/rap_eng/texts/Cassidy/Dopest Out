I'm the dopest nigga out, I'm the dopest nigga out
I'm the dopest nigga out, dopest nigga out
That stupid nigga never should'a opened up his mouth
What the fuck is nigga smoking? I'm the dopest nigga out
Dope, the dopest nigga out, the dopest nigga out
I'm the dopest nigga out, I'm the dopest nigga out
I'm 'bout to make 'em scatter like the roaches in their house
What the fuck is nigga smoking? I'm the dopest nigga out

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
If they put me up in that ring (ring), put me up in that square (square)
They gon' put me up in that bing (bing), put me up in that chair (yeah)
Homie dies if this battle happen, far as battle rapping I'm bonified
Homes ain't making it home alive, send him home to God it's homicide
It's fear when you looking at homie's eyes
I scared the boy, he paranoid
(Don't spare the boy catch a body Cass!)
Body bags I'mma bury boy
Rest in peace to that dearly departed
You beef with me then you clearly retarded
I don't see how they compare me to artists
When lyrically them niggas seriously garbage
He overrated I'm underrated, my son done made it
One of the sperm out my cum done made it
Him and the other sperm in my cum related
You can go place to place, state to state, town to town
I'm the best pound for pound
And we can go round for round right now if y'all clowns is down

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
You ran your mouth, is you man or mouse, goon or bitch?
I'm a lunatic I been doing this since a fetus in my mam's uterus
I'm ludicrus, my flow been crack since kangol hats and Puma kicks
I can move my lips
And what you'll hear can make New Years feel like June the 5th
I'm-I'm hot as hell, I'm the shit but I ain't got the smell
I got bars but I'm not in jail, I spit the same shit that I got for sale
I wear gear I cannot spell, get outfits I cannot pronunciate
You got Lou, I got Lou too but I'm cute too, you got a monkey face
Chimpanzee you need to come up with a plan B
You can't stay with your plan A, fuck what you and your fans say
You-you in the damn way, I battle you any damn day
Chew you up and then spit you out, so man up stop bitching out

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
While you was watching Nick at Nite
I was pitchin' getting that chicken right
Flippin' white I sold the coke
I was throwin' throwin' yoke like it's mischief night
I be with bitches the bitches like
And I be twistin' that kryptonite
I don't hit the pipe but keep weed to twist
The trees get lit like it's Christmas night
You might can rap but don't risk your life
I ain't playing around with you
If we get in the square I'mma end your career
The most you would last is a round or two
Cause lyrically you can't compare to me
But I ain't battling voluntarily
We could come to rap for that 100 stacks
And then give some of that to charity
You scared of me...
