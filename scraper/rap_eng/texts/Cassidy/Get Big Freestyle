[Hook: Dourrough]

[Verse One: Cassidy]
You ain't even got a car, (nah) I just got a coupe
But do it got a roof? Not at all I gotta ball
My chain blingin' name ringin' like I got a call
Always got a broad, get more head then a Tylenol
And I'm sippin' on that block n' fall
They call it that cause you gon' take a sip, walk a block and fall
Thats a drink were they just mix a lot of alcohol
And I'm smokin sour thats so powerful you got to cough
I do it bigga' than the nigga that you coppin' off
You a'int even bricks cuz you a bitch and youu a'int got the balls
I'm coppin' up and no I'm not the Law
I just bought a crib bigga' than a shoppin' mall
Listen cassy kick yo' ass like a soccer ball
Grab a Glock and pop it off and knock a nigga noggin off
A lot of y'all think you hot but you a'int hot at all
Y'all never did what my click did, get big
