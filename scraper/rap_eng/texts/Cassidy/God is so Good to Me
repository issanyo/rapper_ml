Yeah. Cassidy
Man, in my lifetime I done did so many crazy things
Been to so many crazy places
Made so many mistakes
Its definitely a blessing that I'm still here
I could definitely be in a different position

Everybody had to take something they ain't wanna take
And make decisions they ain't wanna make to get their numbers straight
In life you've got to be patient but it ain't fun to wait
The grind a marathon but run the race don't run in place
I wanna take advice from someone who won a race
If they got food for thought of course I want a plate
You give a man a hamburger he gon' want a steak
Why people hate showin' love but they love to hate?
This world a mess yo, I need to drink some Pepto
Cause I done seen some things that'd make your stomach ache
I come from a place where nobody good should be
But I'm good cause see, God is so good to me

I've got friends that got killed, that I'll never see again
And got friends in jail that'll never be free again
That's why I thank God cause that could be me
But God's so good to me (yes, He is)
I got family that died, we will never talk again
And friends paralyzed that'll never walk again
That's why I thank God cause that could be me
But God's so good to me (yes, He is)

I've made my mark in the street, played my part in the street
But I'm still here, I could be deceased or in a wheelchair
Yea, I hear Christ talk when He speak
So He bless me and protect me when I'm walkin' the street
Yo the devil in disguise, he be stalkin' the weak
You gotta read about the mark of the beast
Illuminati, I ain't tryna catch a body but I walk with the heat
If you try me homicide be putttin' chalk in the street
I never realized why they say talkin' is cheap
It's expensive when your co-defendant talk to police
Regardless if I'm walkin' in peace or crossin' the line
God good all of the time (yes, He is)

I've got friends that got killed, that I'll never see again
And got friends in jail that'll never be free again
That's why I thank God cause that could be me
But God's so good to me (yes, He is)
I got family that died, we will never talk again
And friends paralyzed that'll never walk again
That's why I thank God cause that could be me
But God's so good to me (yes, He is)

The devil's still testin' me, bills still stressin' me
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' the berg
Yea, I sold some grams. I was determined to own some land
When I see a homeless man sleep on a curb
Reason why I'm speakin' these words is so
You ain't gotta go to church to hear somebody preachin' the word
Word. If you ever read the scripture before
You could develop your own relationship with the Lord
Yep, stay prayed up in politic with the Lord
Cause people could pray for you but they can't pray FOR you
If you stay faithful and stay loyal
G O D will be there every day for you

I've got friends that got killed, that I'll never see again
And got friends in jail that'll never be free again
That's why I thank God cause that could be me
But God's so good to me (yes, He is)
I got family that died, we will never talk again
And friends paralyzed that'll never walk again
That's why I thank God cause that could be me
But God's so good to me (yes, He is)
