Hey you know what you remind me of
The sun that shines above I think that I'm in
Love cuz every time I look in your eyes
They be dumb bright like the sunlight
When I look in the sky and you always look fly
You stay with a mean outfit
And got shoes that didn't even come out yet
Always got your your nails done, always got yourself fixed
You da type of chick I can see me going out wit
And I ain't knockin yo hustle but you should be
Somebody's wifey icey wit a rock on your knuckle
And we would look hot as a couple
Cuz you shaped so beautifully and
You almost as cute as me
