They say your word is everything
Everything in who's eyes?
Guys confuse lies with truth
Truth with True lies
My two eyes seen plenty of dudes die
But I survive
You guys can't walk in My shoes
I'm not Your shoe size
I flipped a couple bricks
Couple birds flew by
Coke white like it got
Blonde hair and blue eyes
Pies, I's moving them
In the Hood I'm a hoodlum
I jury shop, My jewelry box
Remind me of Jerusalem
Cats let they Gats Blast fast
Like a Muslim
I call my nine Ramadan
When I'm introducing them
I smoke pot like snoop and them
Pockets fat like Bruce Bruce and them
Fat man Scooping them
All my shooters I keep losing them
They either in a box or cell block
Prosecutors accusing them
Cats is ratting prosecution confusing them
Of course they get rectified
Go to court and Testify
Lift they right hand on a stand
Snitch on they right man and
Blame it on the white man damn
Look I took 100 grand
Out this white man hand
And gave him three K's
Like that white man Klan
My Band Rocking out like a White man band
I'm a choke...... ( HE MESSED UP PROVING THAT IT"S A FREESTYLE)

My watch is rocking out like a white man band
That's a Joke, I hope I don't offend my white man fans
The smoke is in the air like a hype man's hands
The Mic is a deadly weapon in the right man's hands
I'm not a hater, but I'm not a tight pants fan
Tight pants I can't stand, I dress like a damn man
If you dress like the opposite sex, you a damn Tran
Aluminum bat. CRACK! Grand Slam
I'm might be in a bent, might be in a damn van
The turtle getting top because I'm freaky like can man
The truth be told, The whole industry is a damn scam
Ran by pricks with big heads like a NBA jam man
Im the Sand Man, You a Lack, You Grand M
Fall back and get smacked by the back of my damn hand
Man I ain't mumble neither
You don't want to rumble neither
Float like a Butterfly
I be done Bumblbee'd ya
I'm a Winter warmer
And a Summer Freezer
Shining, Black and White Diamonds
Jungle fever
I'm a Jungle Lion, You a Jungle Zebra
You just run around the jungle
I'm the jungle leader
You just eat Grass
Cass eat Fucking zebras
SO I don't need to hear nothing
I'm off the Fucking meter
I ain't bluffing either
I'm on fire, got a fucking fever
I'm the Hustler
You a Fucking Diva
If Life a Bitch then
Fucking leave her
It's like if you don't like living then
Break up with her then
But once you break up
You can't make up with her and
Start acting right, come back to life and live again
I live Life like it's sweet until the bitter end
And until I am a Heavenly Citizen
I'm a Get it in

My name Cassidy, Say Hello to Your Majesty
When it's time to spit
The Marijuana Lit
I got to have it, I got a Habit
And I ain't trying to quit
My flow so tough, I crush nigga's confidence
My flow Hot Like a Pot of your Grand mama grits
I get it popping like Pork Bacon
If You need food for thought
The spoon and the fork waiting
Of course I praise the Lord
I don't support satan
I support showing love
I don't support hating
I'm wiser, more humble, and more patient
I'm making more cake, I'm here for the duration
You hear the music the boy making? the boy faking
I ain't buying that that bullshit man the boy lying
I don't care about the gear that the boy buying
I could care less about the jets that the boy flying
I'm not concerned with the cars he cop
I want to know how may bars he got
Or if his bars hard or not
I'm sorry yoc, I was just trying to make the party pop
Round the time the drummer bass, the Henny and Bacardi drops
You only gonna be hot for a little while
But you see through like a coffee pot
