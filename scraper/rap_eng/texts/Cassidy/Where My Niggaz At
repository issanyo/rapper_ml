Where my niggas at? (HUH?!) Cock that yo (HUH?!)
Squeeze them triggers back (HUH?!) Pop that yo
If I got it, I'mma pop a nigga, lay a nigga down
I ain't playin, I'll spray a nigga, lay a nigga down

Where my niggas at? (HUH?!) Cock that yo (HUH?!)
Squeeze them triggers back (HUH?!) Pop that yo
If I got it, I'mma pop a nigga, lay a nigga down

Niggas ain't ready to die, they ready to tell
That's why my squad ready to ride and ready for jail
They'll give you every shell in the K
A couple rounds from the pipe'll make it sound like Independence Day
And I can talk that gun shit cuz I done shit
My nickname should be diarehhea how I run shit
And I done seen niggas gun spit over dumb shit
I got young bitch named Nina that you could tongue kiss
When it come to this gun shit I'm the man son
Niggas gon' show me respect - cuz I DEMAND SOME
I play with bullets bout as big as my damn thumb
And I spit the AR handgun til my hand numb
I ain't a hypocrit who spit he he never did
I'mma speak the truth whether positive or negative
Don't get me wrong I put songs that was conscious out
But I'll still grab the Thompson and blow your conscious out

Where my niggas at? (HUH?!) Cock that yo (HUH?!)
Squeeze them triggers back (HUH?!) Pop that yo
If I got it, I'mma pop a nigga, lay a nigga down
I ain't playin, I'll spray a nigga, lay a nigga down

My flow so raw I thought about baggin' it up
E'ry word like a bird and I'm just addin' it up
But with the burner I'll burn ya like a bag and a dutch
I just, blast at ya gut, light ya abdomen up - YUP
But I ain't the same Cass from the past
I be tryna chill but I'll still blast at ya ass
I got cash in the stash and money in the bank y'all
Hatin' on me makin' me rich, I wanna thank y'all
I leave the biscuit on my hip and just shank y'all
Only thing you niggas ever shot was a paintball
Or a cap gun, you could get your hat spun
You gotta know I clap my gun and you ain't that dumb
Back when I was young, no bull, I pulled triggers back
I be in the hood cuz I'm good where my niggas at
I'm the general I'll let my military get you
With their military pistols, that's military issued

Where my niggas at? (HUH?!) Cock that yo (HUH?!)
Squeeze them triggers back (HUH?!) Pop that yo
If I got it, I'mma pop a nigga, lay a nigga down
I ain't playin, I'll spray a nigga, lay a nigga down

Where my niggas at? (HUH?!) Cock that yo (HUH?!)
Squeeze them triggers back (HUH?!) Pop that yo
If I got it, I'mma pop a nigga, lay a nigga down

I got a lot of gats, and I just fought a homocide
And I ain't make one statement, you know I'm not a rat
So what you got a gat, when it start poppin' off
You'll probably shoot your fucking self trying to pop it off
You ain't got the balls, you soft like cottonballs
You just think you hard cuz the pills and the alcohol
But dog you ain't hard as you say you is
You need to tell your fans how soft and gay you is
S, H, A, no matter what K it is
I'mma still keep poppin' and bodies'll keep droppin'
But I don't want to have to injure nobody
Grip the pipe or stick the knife into somebody
And I don't walk around now pretending I'm Gotti
But I'll still clap the mac 10 at somebody
I took my life and put it all in a rap
For my dogs with they paws on a gat
Prrrraaaatt!

Where my niggas at? (HUH?!) Cock that yo (HUH?!)
