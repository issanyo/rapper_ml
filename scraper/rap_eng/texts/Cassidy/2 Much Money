Hook:
It’s too much money in here
Yeah, it’s too much money in here
It's money over there, it's money over here
It's money everywhere
It’s too much money in here
I get get money, I’m bout getting the cash
I get get the money, I’m bout getting the cash
I get get money, I’m bout getting the cash
That’s why niggas getting the money, its in the cash

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
It’s hard to play your part if you ain’t got no heart
The glistenin chain got me getting brain that’s why I’m so smart
You in a smart car, dog that’s a go-cart, you might as well go park, hitch-hike or go walk
I keep the razor like a barber I’m so sharp
My car got a ball head, I chopped off the Mo-Hawk
I’m already legendary like Mozart my cash up you just gassed up
Nigga go fart
I be amusing myself
But I carry my own tool, and I'll use it myself
If you want it done right, you gotta do it yaself
That piff was gettin expensive so I grew it myself
I’m executive producing all my music myself
My flow tight I gotta loosen my belt
Its stupid people you can truthfully help
But if you hang around a bunch of broke people
Then you stupid yaself
Get the cash

[Hook:]
It’s too much money in here
Yeah, it’s too much money in here
It's money over there, it's money over here
It's money everywhere
It’s too much money in here
I get get money, I’m bout getting the cash
I get get the money, I’m bout getting the cash
I get get money, I’m bout getting the cash
That’s why niggas getting the money, its in the cash

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I’m so icy like Gucci, but I don’t’ wear Gucci bags
I’m a "G", I don’t do the Louie and Gucci rags
Ya clothes tighter than your wife's with her groupie ass
Homes you soft, I'll strangle you with ya own scarf
I’m signed to my own label I’m my own boss
But ya'll paychecks less than what my phone cost
If you ain’t got my ringtone turn ya phone off
Cause all these very clear, canary stones cost
I be making your chick Bedrock
I nicknamed her headshot, I be gettin my top blown off
I’m not a bad person but I put mad work in
These motherfuckers got cass cursin
Everybody say they aliens I guess I’m the last earthling
But you will never catch me jerking or swag surfing
No ‘cause I don’t do the shit kids do
My flow sicker than the pig flu
Get the cash

[Hook:]
It’s too much money in here
Yeah, it’s too much money in here
It's money over there, it's money over here
It's money everywhere
It’s too much money in here
I get get money, I’m bout getting the cash
I get get the money, I’m bout getting the cash
I get get money, I’m bout getting the cash
That’s why niggas getting the money, its in the cash

[Verse 3: AR-AB]
I get to the money, no pit stopping
Forty grand on me, two brick profit
Think about robbin, that’s no option
Hangin out the window, two big rockets
I just say go
If he say snow
Got it, for the low
8 hundred four a "o"
Orders get covered
44 snubber
Hit him one time, Make his ass hover
All my money come fast like a lambo
I can turn from AB, into Rambo
Hollow tips in the clip for the ammo
They'll leave teddy bears and the candle
I surround sound ya, with the four pounder
I cop white girl, then I go drown her
Vision ware whippin, culinary chemist
Pockets look like a dictionary in it
All black mazi, all black shotty
Shit, I done lost count on my last body
M16, hit him too clean
Wig shot, he ain't get a chance to scream
Empty out then reload up, my gun hit like a Dee-Bo punch
And I ain’t gotta wait til next Friday to get my pay
Cause my yay the same complexion as Sade

[Hook:]
It’s too much money in here
Yeah, it’s too much money in here
It's money over there, it's money over here
It's money everywhere
It’s too much money in here
I get get money, I’m bout getting the cash
I get get the money, I’m bout getting the cash
I get get money, I’m bout getting the cash
That’s why niggas getting the money, its in the cash
