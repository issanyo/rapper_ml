(Hook x2)
Ayo, all I spit is yayo
Spittin' coke, you could quote like everything I say, yo
And all these other rappers swear to God they sounding dumb', yo
Bars they ain't got none, yo, so I'mma have some fun, yo

(Verse)
Ayo, I'm hustlin' everyday yo, coke white as a cracker
I got trappers on the pay-roll

Cass been spazzin since they had me layin in the cradle
Wildin been a problem ever since i was a day old

I used to play with Playdoh, etch a sketch and Legos
Now I'm the man, im countin' bands from playin with that yayo

I'm hungry tryna figure out what I'mma eat today yo
Cream cheese on my bagel, pancakes or a eggo

Lenguini with the preggo, fedacini with alfredo
A hoggie, extra mayo, turkey, lettuce, and tomato

I rap but I'm still slangin', my connect real name is Pedro
I want it, I confront it, I don't even got to pay-o

If we got beef, stay off the streets, you niggas better lay low
I never lose a fight, i choose to fight, I get a K.O
Plus, I move with shootas, that strap with that AK-o
The outcome will be fatal they gon' put a tag on they toe

I'm bout to blow like waco, and I could fight the law
I play with base, that's why I ball, just like Jose canseco

Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo I keep sayin ayo cause I forgot what to say yo
But they know I got more bars than them boys they send up state yo
In espanol,  I'm fuego, that's fire, I'm bilingual
I stay on my j-yo, gettin' bucks like Oj mayo
You ain't gone shoot me, this ain't call of duty, this ain't halo
Yo cass with a bad bitch, out in Sandro pello
Her face resemble Halle, but her ass resemble J-Lo
She say her man don't matter, she would rather fuck with me though
Cause when he cum he bust too quick, (pya) torpedo
When son smash, he cum too fast, that's why he wear a speedo
I wear boxers so i beat the pussy up no referee though

Ayo Kanye hoe did a porno with Ray J yo
I know she with Kanye yo I still wanna fuck Kim K though

These niggas frontin like they fuckin bitches but they gay though
Bendin over backwards takin penis in they a hole
All my niggas shoot it and movin if i say so
They ruthless so they movin any nigga in my way yo
