[Hook]
Yo my money was small, now my money is growin’
I throw that coke on the strip and make it look like it’s snowin’
Took my profit, went shoppin’, spent a couple of dollars
Then hit the block out there poppin’ and made it back in a hour
I’ve got the mind of a grinda, that’s right, the mind of a grinda
I’ve got the mind of a grinda, mi-mi-mind of a grinda
I think like a hustla, I put that on my mama
I’ve got the mind of a grinda, mi-mi-mind of a grinda

[Verse 1]
I was born to shine, money on my mind
And I’m doin’ to crime but I ain’t doin’ the time
Cookin’ white, put my life on the line
I should have blue balls how I’m on the grind
I’m makin’ the call, pickin’ it up
Weighing it raw and I’m whippin’ it up
Got a dutch of the green, I’m twistin’ it up
Lean off codeine, I’m sippin’ a cup
I’m ridin’ around with the chick in the truck
She got some big tits and a butt
I’mma get my dick sucked, put the dick in her gut
I’m poppin’ her off and then I’m droppin’ her off
You wanna strip and you knockin’ it off
And I'm the nigga that you coppin’ it off
I’m coppin' this up and sellin’ it hard
Tryn' no to get another felony charge
I get the coke, 10 birds at a time
And 20 pounds of the herb at a time
Even though I get paid from the words that I rhyme
I’m on the grind and that’s word to my mom
I’m still twistin’ up Ganja, I’m still spittin’ that China
I’m still pitchin’ Madonna cuz I’ve got the mind of a grinda

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I cook up the crack then cut the crack
Bag up the crack then bust the trap
Move the work faster than Busta rap
The hustla back, where the hustlers at?
I paid half price but I cop it whole
My pockets swole, too much guap to fold
Cuz the rockets sold, I make the profit
Then take the profit, start coppin’ clothes
I stay shopin’ and poppin’ hoes
My cock is always getting mop and glow
Cuz I cup the rose, my watch is froze
And I roll a hose to pop oxies whole
The pocket roll that hurt your chest
I sip patrone, I’m getting stoned
I work the best when I'm on percocets
And these bitches can’t leave my dick alone
They call my phone and Twitter me
Like why you tryna get rid of me
I’m like go to hell with all that
Bitch fall back and don’t call back
They be all on my ball sack
Tryna give me that vagina
But I ain't with all that drama cuz I’ve got the mind of a grinda

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I pinch bills that fish scale when move that marijuana
Cuz I got the mind of a grinda, go-go-got the mind of a grinda
I wear LV, that double G, that Dolce & Gabbana
Cuz I got the mind of a grinda, go-go-got the mind of a grinda
My bank account got 2 commas but I walk around with that lama
Cuz I got the mind of a grinda, go-go-got the mind of a grinda
I fucked a chick, let her suck the dick but I’m not gon wine and dine her
Cuz I got the mind of a grinda, go-go-got the mind of a grinda
