{Intro}
Mayhem Music, Uhhhh
Cassidy, Shawn G, Semzo (ahhhhh, ahhhhhh)
I ain't never comin down (Down)
I ain't comin' down

[Hook]
I'm so high, I ain't comin' down
I'm so high I ain't comin' down
I'm on a molly and I'm bout to pop another now
Rollin', hit the loud, I'm in the clouds, I ain't comin' down
I'm so high, I ain't comin' down
I'm so high, I ain't comin' down
Yeah, I'm drunk, but I'm about to take another round
Drink and hit the loud, I'm in the clouds, I ain't comin' down
I ain't comin' down
I ain't comin' down
I ain't comin' down
I ain't comin' down

[MUSIC BREAK]

[Verse 1]
I'm in the party, startin' the party jumpin', yeah I'm gettin' my pogo on
Advertising that polo gear, yeah I'm gettin' my promo on
For Instagram, gettin' my photo on
Only foams no [?]'s on
I'm tired of seein' the ho with clothes on, rather see her with no clothes on
It's in my DNA I'm all about that TNA
I'm on that MDMA
Juice for the [?]EMA
And they see me in expensive C-A-R-S
Hip Hop and EDM, Still nothing but B-A-R-S (BARS)

[Music Break] - Beat Change
Uhhhhhhhh - Ahhhhhhhh x2

[Verse 2]
Yo, you know I'm so high, still tryin' to get more high
Every minute that go by, No lie, I stay bent from Monday to Sunday
Diamonds shine like a sun ray
Try to rob me, it's gun play, I promise
Like Speedy Gonzalez, better run away like
Etta etta, Arriba Arriba, Andale Andale
So-So don't act dumb today , I came to have fun today
Instead of comin' down, I'm gonna get higher than what I am now!
