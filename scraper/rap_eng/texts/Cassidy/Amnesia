[Hook: Cassidy]
Look man, I am who you pretend to be
I got the best punchlines, the best similes
I got the best metaphors, you just a mini-me
And I see you got amnesia, you don't remember me?
You don't remember me, I'mma refresh your memory [x3]
You forgot who the best? I'mma refresh your memory

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
You must got amnesia if you forgot about me
But you could google my name and learn a lot about me
And you can see my face all over myspace
You can see me battle and chew dudes on youtube
I been the best before ringtones was in effect
I been the best before downloads on the internet
I used to sell crack rock, but hit the jack pot
Now all I do is type raps on my Mac laptop

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
Ey yo, that punchline flow? I invented that
IF you wasn't Lord Finess and Big L, you wasn't into that
How you the best, and your breath smells like Similac?
When it comes to getting gravy, you just a baby
Everything I spit is crazy, you can't contend with that
Cats fucking up Hip-Hop I'mma put an end to that
I pack gun cause I'm from where niggas act dumb
I'm from trap street where the smokers getting their crack from
Even if its broad day light I still clap one
The Idaho potato make it sound like a cap gun
If I see a cat flossin' and I'm strapped son?
I play my part like Samuel L and jack son

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
You cats in the industry not men to me
Too much femininity wheres the masculinity?
If I get my enemy in my vacinity
I spray gats, cause I stay strapped like Yosemite
I'm from the street my gun keep sayin' empty me
They say you can't pass away unless its meant to be
We all gotta die eventually but instantly
You could take shots, but its not Hennessy
I run up on you like remember me?
Pull the heat out, and knock your teeth out I do dentistry
I ride around in the truck with the Mac-10 on me
Fuck a drop, that's how they got John F Kennedy
I'm getting bread but I ain't rich as I intend to be
Benjamin is my friend, being broke is my enemy
I'm tryna get that cash that lasts centuries
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense to me

[Hook]
