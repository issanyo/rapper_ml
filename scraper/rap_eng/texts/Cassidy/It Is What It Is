Night Niggas Need 2 Get They Mind Rite
2 Get Signed Niggas Probably Take They Mom Life
Things People Do Just 2 Get In The Rhyme Life
But They Each Your Zone
It Is What It Is
Man Understand This
Their Is A Big Difference Between Advantage And Avanquish
The Alogo And The Mercialago
I Ain't Gotta Lie Yo
It Is What It Is
If U See Me Wit Some Niggas They All Grimy
I Put Time In Time Diamonds All Shiny
Paid A 100 Grand For A Chain That Cost 90
And Let Them Keep The Change
It Is What It Is
And Every Song Niggas Doin The Work
Talkin About A Million Niggas That They Willin 2 Murk
But How Many Niggas U Gon Kill In A Verse
U Gotta Convince Me Dog
It Is What It Is
My Squad Luv Me Cause I Dont Ride Dick
U Gotta Keep It Real Wit The Niggas U Ride Wit
Ladies Luv Me Cause Im Cool As Todd Smith
So Hide Yo Chick
It Is What It Is
If U A Skinny Woman Than Thats Thorough
But If Uz A Big Woman I Got Ur Back Girl
Fuck All Them Niggas That Consider U Fat Girl
U Ain't Gotta Lose Weight
It Is What It Is
All Im Makin Is More Hits
But I Was Drunk Wen I Came In2 The Booth 2 Record This
Swizz Sed Cass U Gotta Think Of The Chorus
But I Dont Need No Hook
It Is What It Is
My Worse Verse Hot As Ur Best Rhyme
Damn I Can't Think Of The Next Line
But Fuck It Ill Remember It Next Time
Cause Im Compressed For Time
It Is What It Is
These Fake Niggas Would Strait Front
I Did 2 County Bids But Ain't Been Upstate Once
For A Murder Charge I Only Did 8 Months
My Lawyer The Truth
It Is What It Is
U Ain't Gotta Like It But U Gotta Respect It
Theirs Things In The Past That U Upset Wit
But I Woundnt Change Nuttin I Dont Regret Shit
We All Make Mistakes
It Is What It Is
Cause Government Dont Do Shit For U
But Send U To War Man They Tryin To Destroy U
The President Tryin 2 Get To All U
He Worse Than Sadam
It Is What It Is
They Should Put My Picture Next 2 The Definition Of Hip Hop
But Im Not Getting No Recognition From Dick Jocks
Even Sum Of The Best Ammiting That My Shit Hot
