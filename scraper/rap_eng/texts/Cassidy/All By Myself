[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I'm in the zone all by myself
I'm alone all by myself, I'm on my own
But holmes I could set the tone myself
And make the track that I could rap on myself
I wrote the rap myself, did the track myself
Went in the booth, produced that myself
I did the bass, did the claps myself
Did the drums, snares, and the high hats myself
Uh I play each sound I'm banging out beats now
The only one with heat now, holding the streets down
I paint pictures everybody could see
But besides God I ain't got nobody but me

[Hook: Cassidy] (x2)
I'm in the zone all by myself
I'm alone all by myself
But I don't need nobody else
And God

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I wanna thank my fans, good looking for the mail
Cause I was going through it when they put me in the jail
They put me in the cell, just me and the rats
And my relationship with God is what kept me relaxed
D.A. will say anything except for the facts
And they had a lot of evidence except for the gats
Before they prove you guilty they will treat you like a criminal
They tried to give me first degree, they said it was intentional
I had to get shit together on my own
The media was talking like I'm never coming home
Me and my Mom used to talk together on the phone
She said keep your faith and you will beat this case, yup

[Hook: Cassidy] (x2)

[Verse 3:]
I gotta clique that'll grip steel for me
I gotta squad that'll ride that'll kill for me
But I argue and fight with my own mother
And now a days you can't even trust your own brother
So make sure you keep your enemies the closest to you
Cause your friends will the ones who put the toasters to you
That's why you gotta watch your surroundings
Cause niggas that can swim love watching you drowning
So only real niggas chill with me
But ain't nobody gonna pay my bills but me
See, you might got a crew that can help
But if you want it done right you gotta do it yourself

[Hook: Cassidy] (x2)
