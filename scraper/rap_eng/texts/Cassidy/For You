[Verse 1]
Reasons why you ran don't make you a good man
Yes, I understand
You were on time at the wrong time
I was debating, but tried and I don't know why
You can act cold on a dime and so outta line

[Chorus]
For you
I’d do anything for you
Nail my heart to the ceiling
Put my fist through a wall
How come (how come) I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)?
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion, but I get nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Reasons for my hope all make me a big joke
I already know
You were just fine, I was just fine
Why did we turn a good time to a dark one?
I give you a chance, but the better man never comes

[Chorus]
For you (for you)
I’d do anything for you (for you, for you)
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)
I'd put my fist through a wall
How come (how come) I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)?
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion, but I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all

[Bridge]
For you
I'd do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do (put my fist through a wall) anything for you
I would do anything

[Chorus]
For you (for you)
I’d do anything for you (for you, for you)
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)
I'd put my fist through a wall
How come (how come) I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)?
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion, but I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all
But I get nothing at all

[Outro]
For you
I'd do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
