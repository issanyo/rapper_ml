[Intro]

[Verse 1: Da Hustla]
You just a performer, I was on the corner grinding the packet
I'm a Ryder, If there's drama I'm palming the ratchet
And you could find me in traffic, I'm in the streets
10 years ago I was moving like 10 a week
You just a family man, tryna settle down
You on parole so you scared to hold the metal now
You moved away from the hood, I'm in the ghetto now
Yea, I grip pipes, I just like how the metal sound
I got the metal now, nigga, I ain't never scared
How the fuck you run Philly and you ain't never there!?
And I ain't never feared nothing but God
You went to jail, came home, and ain't do nothing but hide
But fuck it, I'm a ride, I might start sparking the H
I send rap cats to God like Mase
And like the car accident, I'll put another scar on your face
But when the 5 clap, you ain't gonna survive that
Nigga

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: BARS]
Oh, you ruthless, the record I'm a Hustla was stupid
Cause Jay made more off the record than you did
And Swizz made more off the record than you did
So you did something for nothing you doofus
I'm too sick for, any nigga with 2 lips
And 1 tongue in his mouth, I talk too slick
You only got a few hits and a couple fans
And I could prolly get you bodied for a couple grand
I caught a murder attempts, I had a couple man
But I could knuckle man, and knock you out with a couple hands
Every bar I spit raw like a couple grams
You the Hustla, but I'll show you how to hustle man

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Da Hustla]
Look, I'm a give this guy an applause
But It's a lotta lies in a lot of his BARS
Cause I'm a hustla, I sold pies of the raw
Plus, the hustla gon' ride if it's war
But you the type of boy that'll hide if it's war
You the type boy that never come outside if it's war
So, you a nut to me, you know you can't fuck with me
And BARS you was locked up on protective custody
You like my son, but I don't want custody
You a mutt to me, I'm a pit, And you a pup to me
You in the street cause you beat the case luckily
But you ain't tough as me, I'll burn you like a dutch of trees, nigga

[Interlude]

[Verse 4: BARS]
You a snitch, you a rat, you'll sing, you'll hold the note
I sold the coke, and smoke weed 'till I'm comatose
I live by the rules, I was schooled by the older folks
I was showed the ropes by the cats that was holding toast
Lord knows even goons get the Holy Ghost
Yea, I believe in Christ, but I'll still squeeze a pipe
And I don't even need to write, or switch the flow
You niggas know I ain't Murder Fluke or Cicero
I'm way sicker yo, so who ever supposed to be nice
Get two choices, the toast or the knife
And if you think you a hustler, then you the one smokin the pipe
Cause you ain't never sold no coke in you life, trust me!
You must be giving money away
If you got 20 strips all doin 20 a day!
Cause you ain't worth shit, you went gold on your first disc
And I'm a Hustla sold less then your first shit, nigga

[Outro]
