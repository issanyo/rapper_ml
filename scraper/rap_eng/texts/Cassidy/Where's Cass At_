Where's Cass At? [x7]
I'm Right Here
We Know You Producing We Hear You Rapping
You Gotta A Lot Of Hits SwizZz You Got Shit Cracking But
Where's Cass At? [x4]

A Lotta Cats Rap About Gats But Never Pop None
A Lotta Cats Rap About Crack But Never Cop None
I Eat Even When It's A Drought Because I'm Not Dumb
When Ain't Nobody Else Got None I Still Got Some
But I Ain't The One The Smoker's Getting The Rock From
I'm The One The Connect Cop From, And I'm A Top Gun
Coke Got Slum Time Cruise Complexion
So When I'm Driving To My Crib My Phone Lose Reception (Hello?)
But Yo Lemme Ask You Dudes A Question
Did You Ever Use A Weapon That Removed A Method?
Fed A Meen At The Feinds On The Block Of Love
Did You Ever Go To War Did You Pop A Slug?
I Think Not Because You A Pussy Hole
You Used To Do The Tootsie Roll Yo You Not A Thug
I Gotta A Lot Of Cake But I Gotta Lot Of Love
Cause I'll Take A Nigga Plate If I Ain't Gotta Grub
I'm Tryna Eat Like Dama Cause
If It's Drama You Get Buried Cause I Carry Choppas Like Osama Does
It's A Drought If You Grinding Drugs
And If You Work It's Recession So I Voted For Obama Cause
I'm Not A Supporter Of John McCain, He Wants The Rich To Get Richer and The Poor To Get Poorer
It's Time For Change, Everybody Hustling Know That They Can't Go Vote For No Republican
And No I'm Not A Republican Or Democrat You Can Say I'm Independent Cause I Ain't Into That
But Right Now The Democrats Can Bring Us Back Any Black Sorry John McCain It's A Rental's Wrap
But On Another Note, I've Been Into Rap, Since Like 89' That Have Been A Crazy Time
On The Grind Like I'm Tryna See Better Days, I Sold My First Record Deal In The 11th Grade
I Dropped Out So I Ain't Get The Diploma, But If You Wear My Chain You Will Get The Imonia
The Car Accident Put The Kid In A Coma, But I'm Still The Shit You Could Smell The Aroma (Stinky)
Ya'll Niggas Know I'm Dumb Nice Ya'll Could Ask Escobar All I Need Is one Mic
I Never Got Shot Never Lost One Fight, I Make It Do What It Do But I Make Sure It's Done Right
I Just Had A Dream, Now I'm The East Coast Artist Of The Year In The Foundation Magazine
I Spit Carasine My Hump Pump Gasoline? Vocab Is Mean Talk Slick Like Vaseline
I'm a PlayBoy You Could Ask Jazzline, She The Next Top The Terror The Next Stop
Cause All Them Other Models Stank Like Dress Socks, Yea I'm A Lil Nigga But Like 'Em A Lil Thicker
I'm Bout To Shine Like A Lil Dipper Cause You Niggas Falling Off And My Shit Getting A Lil Sicker
Yeah I'm Still SwizZz Lil Nigga
But Yo Where's Cass At Man Everybody Ask That

Where's Cass At? [x7]

We Know You Producing We Hear You Rapping
You Gotta A Lot Of Hits SwizZz You Got Shit Cracking But
Where's Cass At? [x4]
