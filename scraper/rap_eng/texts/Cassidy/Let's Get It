The block pop so the strip full
Rocks, got a fist full
Ball pop shit, that hot shit I gotta click for
When I start sparking
It be barking like pit bulls
Matter fact rockwallas
When I let them shots holler
Chicks on my cock
I'm still on the block holla
It's Cops on the block
They still gone cop colla
I got god sense and that's why I got dollars
I was told the rules
I'm old school like My pop father
I was showed the moves
Schooled by the older dudes
How to show improve
So I move like a solder move
Real militant, I'm I'll still killing it
Them real guys that's paralyzed and still peeling it
Yeah I'm still on my feet and my toes
Getting higher than the presidential suit at the nose
Getting higher than the nose bleed seats at my Shows
Fuck a maybach I play the back seats to the rows
Fuck a GT I pull up in a CLS
The butt soft like my female breast
Is it a b12 yes
I cop the uncoppable
Nigga you can't stop the unstoppable
Nigga I pop a shot through you niggas
And and I was like a pop for you niggas
I gave you a flow adopted you niggas
I did a lot 4 you niggas
And this the fucking thanks I get
You my son you should thank my dick
You take my shit, flip it around
And Now you think you sick
I guess you think you cass
But I think u trash
And I spank that ass
You ain't fucking with me
You wouldn't even rap like that if it wasn't 4 me
I been had my weight up
How you gone battle me
With a style that I made up
When I'm home it's envy
I'm feeling like the ball
When he was on the phone with
What the fuck is goin on out hea
What the fuck is niggas doin out hea
Niggas drawn out hea
Ya block hot, I put a drawn out thea
My block hot, Ya shit warm out there
So we gone out there
Set up shop and get it on out there
I'm on point like a thorn out here
Come to Philly I'm a don out here
Yeah you know I'm a boss dog
Live than st ives I've
It's lacrose dog
I floss dog, and I stay with my jewelz on
You prolly wouldn't see this much ice in a hell storm
It's nothing 2 flash, But fucking with cass
Would get you bucked or bumbed in tha ass
Cause it's only a handful a rappers
That's touchinq the cash
And most of them getting fucked in they ass
It's snakes up in the grass
But cass gone blast when the beef is on
I walk w| the shells & I ain't got no adidas on
I squeeze the john even if the law watchen
I'm 2 hard the rap version of banard hoppkins
