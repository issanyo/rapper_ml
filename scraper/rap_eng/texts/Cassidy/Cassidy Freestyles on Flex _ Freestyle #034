[Verse 1: : Cassidy & Funk Flex]
Yo, Look
I ball but I ain't got a locker
I just got a lot of work, a lot of percs
Got wild loud and a lot of choppers
I got a shotta on my call list
I seen ackee eat some ackee and the eyeballs out the saltfish
That boul sick, he'll grip the john
And fire at your grill 'til it's hot enough to make some jerk chicken on
Before this spliff is gone I'm gon' stop at the bud spot
This J makin' me feel Jamaican, what the blood clot
I'm from a drug block where niggas let them slugs pop
Mean mug cops, catch a case, get the judge shot
I love guap, I used to hug blocks, now I'm the plug, ock
Like that shit that make the water in the tub stop
Flex we play robbers and robbers and we never love cops
You rat, cats will shoot you in your face like a mugshot
Turn you to a ghost when them slugs shot
Or the doc gotta use stitches and bolts to make the blood stop
I'm married with children, I need hella money
That's why my niggas moving Kelly Bundy by the dub rock
Just got in some loud and I'll make the bud pop
It got red hair like Peggy, my eyes bloodshot
I got a zip in the glovebox that's straight piff
That's prettier than Vivica before she got the facelift
I cook straight bricks, took out of state trips
Hustle, did it from the muscle on some get in shape shit
I look great, push weight, but I ain't never weightlift
I exercise rocking that heavy watch and that bracelet
My out-of-date shit on some outer space shit
To find somebody doper, hope a nigga got a spaceship
Banana shaped clip, food for a ape clip
You assed out like a baboon if I go ape shit
My gorillas on some punch you in the face shit
Straight fists, right now they probably beating down somebody
When they found your body you was kinda drowsy
'Cus I got a man to knock your ass out even quicker than Ronda Rousey (Word, that's quick)
When Swizz say "it's showtime," I'm ready
'Cus I put in time already, 2017 mine already
Facts

[Verse 2: : Cassidy & Funk Flex]
Hold on
Master Flex, I'm cookin' like a master chef
If Fif' or Floyd give Cass a check I'll beat a boy half to death
Grab his neck, punch him with the other hand fast as heck
Until he bleed and he can't breathe tryin' to gasp for breath
Off top get shot or stabbed to death
The only favor that I'm giving out to haters is a faster death
You gon' need a pastor next, your body what the pastor bless
Bastard, now you in the casket dressed the way the pastor dress
You a nut tryin' to float around
So when I see you dickheads it's goin' down like after sex
I bought the Bentley 'fore I cashed the check
Now I'm tryin' to decide if I'm a buy the Beamer, Benz or Aston next
Shut down the parking lot before I drove it off the lot
I told 'em take off the top, that bitch half undressed
Gamblin' with your life a nasty bet, so play the cards right
Or you know the deal, I'll cut you like half the deck
You better have a shuffle game or a knuckle game
I'm only like a buck and change but I don't play no fuckin' games
We ain't cut the same, your ho told me we don't fuck the same
I got my dick sucked, came, left a couple cover stains
Yo [Stupid, Stupid]

[Verse 3: Cassidy & Funk Flex]
Yo
I told you I got my dick sucked, came, left a couple cover stains
Every flow on the radio sound the fuck the same
Yup, young such and such sound like lil' what's her name (MUMBLE!)
But with us ain't nothing changed, I'm 'bout to level up
Got back with Swizz, that nigga lit my whole bezel up
Yo, when it snow, tryin' to shovel suck
'Cus all I see is dead rappers every time I pick a shovel up
Dig me? I shine like the sun do
'Cus son I been sonned you, plus I look younger than your son do
The Art of War I was taught before by Sun Tzu
I hold bread and hang around hole heads who guns new
Yeah, what you wanna do? I don't fight fair
You get left right there just like a one, two (Hot 97)
Or I could tell 'em like this Flex
I signed my first deal in 2000, I was 17
Now its 2017, that was 17 years ago
You hear the flow? I put together schemes
You're life a movie? My life a movie, it just got better scenes
Sometime the dirtiest people could seem very clean
The doc cheated on Coretta Scott, we could bet a bean
