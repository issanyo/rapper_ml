[Hook]
You can hate me or love me (Hate, hate me or love me)
You can hate me or love me (Hate me or love me)
I'm grinding still making this money
I'm making this guap
No you ain't taking it from me
You ain't taking my spot
You can hate me or love me (Hate, hate me or love me)
You can hate me or love me (Hate me or love me)
I'm grinding still making this money
I'm making this cake
No you ain't taking it from me
You ain't taking my place
So you can hate me or love me

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I'm still spending my clientele cheese
I ain't gotta sell ki's
I'm a boss, I own companies, LLC's
I floss the ice on my Cross, could make Hell freeze
My wheel cost a quarter mil, my rims cost 12 G's
I had paper before I was selling LP's
That's why I get more head than the female weave
I inhale weed till' I could barely to hell breathe
Anytime you turn around I'm smoking, I burn it down
I'm burning now, what I steam green as Kermit now
I seen so much money my eyes like Eric Sermon's now
Life a bitch but shit, I can't turn her down
I'm addicted to the biscuit, can't put the burner down
I got Mount Airy, Oak Lane, Germantown
North, West and South Philly riding out with me
So I doubt you dudes wanna shoot it out with me
We Bad Boys getting Dirty Money without Diddy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I want more riches and more bitches, the boy vicious
Everyday different gear, every year my car switches
I just bought a house bout as large as a Strawbridge's
Ridiculous, four floors big as a department store
Yours the size of the garage where I park my car
Cause you only sold a Little Rock, like Arkansas
I mess with Aki's that'll spark at y'all
They'll catch a body, then get back on they ding and scream "Strafella"
I ain't selfish y'all, I'm more of a boss than y'all
I look better, got more cheddar, and got more heart than y'all
You from the projects, but you ain't never walked the hall
Plus you wasn't in the streets, you only hustle in your sleep
That's why they call it street dreams you niggas sweet
I ain't skip a beat, I'm still spitting like I'm missing teeth
I'm so sick man, I took it over with no permission
I'm getting money, hate me or love me, it's your decision

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
I really made it, you really love it, or really hate it
I'm sick a lunatic, I need to be facilitated
You niggas gon' flop if you not affiliated
I'm a Philly native for real, don't get humiliated
I make a brick sell fast as rock a dish mail
I spit fish-scale when my fans ain't rehabilitated
All the songs I brang out got 'em strung out
You had your chance to shine but your time bout to run out

[Hook]
