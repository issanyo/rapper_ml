I'm looking at the baddest, I know it
Take you shopping, drop a stack, I throw it
Give you good love, I show it
Anything she needs for her, I blow it, yeah
No need to go against it
She had me at the start, let's go and finish it
I never seen it come in
I never thought I'd be with just one woman
But I, never had this feeling
Never ever thought I'd slow down, and that's some real shit
Never seen it coming, I'm used to running all around with fiends
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
I said I'm throwing other chicks, I don't need em no more
Baby you're the one I can't let go
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
Miss independent, I can send her on a mission
Take her of me and my money, nothing ever missing
Don't talk much, she listen
Try to find another like her, keep wishing
Yeah she a star, when she step out she a star
With my baby on my arm, no I can't go wrong
And she got her own car, check, got her own crib, check
My baby feed me good and that's why
I, never had this feeling
Never ever thought I'd slow down, and that's some real shit
Never seen it coming, I'm used to running around with fiends
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
I said I'm throwing other chicks, I don't need em no more
Baby you're the one I can't let go
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
She got it all she got her own
Every chick that know me, try to blow me like a xylophone
But I don't never dial any phone
'Cause I ain't interested
I ain't never been rejected, cause I'm a good catch
But I guess I got intercepted
I used to ball before, knew it was never hard to score
But I never met a broad before, that had it all before
Yes she the sexiest chick I ever saw before
I never seen nothing like her, so I'ma cuff and wife her
These other chicks I'm cutting off, cause I'm cut from a different cloth
Time is money but chicks tick me off
Broads that hit me off, I ain't satisfied with
I need a girl that I could ride and die with
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
I said I'm throwing other chicks, I don't need em no more
Baby you're the one I can't let go
She got it all, all, all that I want
She got it all, all, all that I need
