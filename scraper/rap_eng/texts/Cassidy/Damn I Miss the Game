[Hook: Cassidy + (Rell sings along)] (x2)
Damn I miss the damn I miss the damn I miss the game
Game, when it's gon' come back, come back
I'm gettin tired of the dumb rap, dumb rap
Man I done been there and done that, let's move on

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Damn I used to love this rap shit
When it was on some gold rope, Kangol hat shit
Now e'ry rapper on some bust-that-gat shit
Cut-that-crack shit, fuck that whack shit
Public Enemy was on some power to black shit
Rap cats need to get back on that shit (real tough)
They need to try switching they flows
Cause all of our women ain't bitches and hoes
And e'ry rapper out got a brick on the stove
And his wrists all froze, and he whippin the Rolls
To hear that, I can listen to Hov'
You bullshit and then you gettin exposed (y'knahmtalkinbout)

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
Yo what happened to the game?
All these niggas rapping the same and that's lame
Cats hustling, busting they gat
But Kurtis Blow wasn't talkin 'bout hustlin crack
Now e'rybody on the grind (uh-huh)
But Run-D.M.C. never killed nobody in their rhyme (nah nah)
They wasn't on that beef shit (uh-uh)
And Melle Mel was the first one to talk that street shit
But e'ry since N.W.A. came out
Cats turned gangster and took that same route
To hear that I could listen to 'Pac
You bullshitting and I'm wishin it'd stop

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
I don't even listen to rap now
It make my head hurt when I listen to cats now
They sound like they all rhymin in one booth
So take the industry and put 'em all in one group
Since they on the same page (yeah)
We should be able to boo them dudes offa the same stage (boo)
F'real, I still love this rap shit
Even though the A runnin with that snap shit
Even though the Bay running with that hyphy
When I get on the mic niggas still won't like me
The headcrack, you can listen to me
You bullshittin, you ain't sicker than me, uh-huh

[Hook] (x2)

[Bridge: Rell]
Onnnnnnnnnnnnn
Let's move oh-onnnn
Let's move onnnnn
Let's move ohhhhhhhhh-onnnnnnnnn
Aww yeah
We gotta move onnnnnnnnnnnn
