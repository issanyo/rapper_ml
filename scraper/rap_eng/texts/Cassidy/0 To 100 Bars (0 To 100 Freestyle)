Imma keep it a bean, pinto
Life is a bitch but I'm that bimbo best friend tho
I stay finger fuckin the nina she a nympho
I stick a clip in her the long kind extendo
This chick I'm with get it in yo
She said she love it when I cum in her face it make her skin glow
I like the girl cuz she like girls but she love men tho
She play with the Wii Wii Nintendo
Im real not pretend yo you know my MO
I spaz get your ass beat like a instrumental
You ain't get the memo?
I ain't have a pot to piss in
Or a window to throw out the urine yo
So I don't give a fuck bout not near one of y'all
I dont bite my tongue at all I say it right in front of y'all
Imma do my thing nigga spring winter summer fall
Till I'm six feet under dog cuz I'm the underdog
24/7 365 each year
I don't even take a day off on a leap year
Yeah
And niggas sayin that I fell off
Why is y'all niggas on my dick get the hell off
Cuz y'all so wrong I still make dope songs
Been the shit for so long I can't get the smell off
Ewwww
I still kill every beat I'm on
Used to hide money in the mattress I was sleepin' on
Whippin'
Cooking coke in my moms kitchen
Cuttin' up on the same table we was eatin' on
Yo I know I made bad decisions
But fuck it I was stuck in a bad position and I had a mission
If you actually listen every nigga rappin' say he trappin'
But the shit ain't adding up and I'm a mathematician
They say numbers don't lie right
But more cats say they trap then fiends comin' to buy white
A blind man can see that that's a lie right
Believe nothin' that you hear and half of whats in your eye sight
Lemme elaborate
Rappers exaggerate
Fabricate believe in them a bad mistake cats is fake
Wait, since the accident I got back in shape
But every time I put on my chain my back will ache
That's a true story
If you ain't talkin' money what the fuck can a conversation with you do for me
Nothin', I be hustlin' I ain't wastin' time
Cuz time money so you owe me if you wastin' mine
And these hoes love Barry but I'm married
So I let em know I can make you cum I can't make you mine
My wife come first so she gotta cum first
You the runner up you wanna fuck you gotta wait in line
My wife like vagina too
She be havin' hoes slidin' thru bodies be phenomenal
Them pretty face women
Nah I can't lie my wife get more bitches then I do she straight pimpin'
My bars too hard for these rap cats
I'm from the school of hard knocks no backpacks
I clap gats I cock it back clatt cLATTTT
PDDAAAT PDDDAAAAT blow ya head off, Katstacks
Facts, I fuckin' murk ya
I keep hammers and ladders on me like construction workers
I never fold when the hand dealt
They wanna see me battle but I ain't battlin' for my damn health
Plus why would a giant battle a damn elf
That can't help man I rather battle my damn self
I ain't never slackin'
But without cheddar the chicken and better competition it will never happen
Who got the nerve to hate
I ain't scared to battle I'm scared if i battle Imma catch a murder case
Cuz them niggas can't fuck with me
If I was layin' on the ground clowns will still look up to me
Yup, and they don't even stand up to pee
To piss they sit on the toilet seat them buls is sweet
Faggot, look pussy what I call niggas
That chick Nicki Minaj harder then y'all niggas
I got a 50 cal I call tiger woods it will put holes in you the size of golf balls nigga
Y'all ball naw nigga not at all nigga
You ain't gettin' ka-reem like abdu jabar nigga
You will need 10 bricks to get this car nigga
I stay rollin' with paper I got that raw nigga
See my diamonds shinin from afar nigga
The watch I rock today you can see from a block away
I pop the k shells telleport
When the chopper start choppin' it sound like you at a heliport
A dead man can't tell in court
If you dump the body in battery acid you can't smell the corpse
To keep it real you better keep ya mouth closed
I knock you out cold
My knuckles is like sleepin' pills
Throw the left twice
Black both eyes
Then the right will make it look like you got a nose job
I can see you niggas pussy with closed eyes
That's why I'm comin' at niggas necks, Bow-ties
Ah
If you think I ain't the greatest ever
You the biggest hater ever
I was born on 7 7 the 7th letter my favorite letter
Cuz I'm a G boy a real MC boy
The 4 5th pop get rocked like d-boy
The pound have you spinnin' on the ground like a b-boy
Break-dancers
Man you can't ask funny questions and expect to get straight answers
Another beat gettin' killt to day
You can't find a rapper better than me in the whole milky way
To prove to y'all that I'm still sick got on 0 to 100 with 100 bars all ill shit
Aww

[Outro]
Huh
I told y'all a'int no 'be safe'
I seen niggas hittin' me on the social media tellin' me to kill this shit
So I had to jump on it
I'm in my bed right now
And I'm disappointed with the industry cause these niggas is garbage
Even the niggas that used to be sayin' shit back in the day
They sound horrible now
I'm like, what the fuck happened
I a'int even got no inspiration
I mean, back in they day I used to be inspired by what niggas was sayin', now I hear niggas and I get disappointed
I gotta listen to my own songs and inspire my damn self
If you wanna hear real bars, real punches, a nigga talkin' that real street shit, you gotta listen to ME
If you listen to them other niggas you settlin' for less
I'm the best
Cassidy
Ye-ah
Uh
