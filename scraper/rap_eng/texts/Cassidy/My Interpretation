Okay. This joint is knockin' right here
I don't even need to write to this joint this easy
I'mma just talk to 'em off the top, listen

My interpretation of what the game facin'
I'm basin' my facts on ancient civilization
And my proclamation plus the world and its foundation
My education is statin' black unification
Debatin' whether Satin is situatin'
And placin' me in a state of mind that can't be shaken
It's like a leech slurrin' my specch, energy taken
It's brakin' my fiberglass thoughts that pass through my mental
Lettin' off frustration through meditation in conventional
Dimension in teleportation
And like the length between words in the first grade my mind is spacin'
Out on route like telephone communications through nations
Give me 360 degree rotations my occupation
Spittin' flows and creatin' a creation through experimental situations
They drug me 'cuz my thoughts bloody like menstruations
Makin' my temperature heat up like incubation
They tracin' and chasin' from location to location
I'm stationed at a hotel accomidation
Waitin' to start me and my squad organization
But I'm hesitatin', too many outside irritations
Makin' me pause and might cause altercations
But I'm penetratin', surpassin' so-called limitations
Dedication, motivation and concentration
Manifestation is the key to escalation
And fluctuation of cheese might cause MC's suffocation
Or tax on cats 'cuz no jacks is bein' fakin'
They typically pissin' me off like urination
Deflation and toleration is in consideration
But me in my rankin' is like Bob Marley to Jamaicans
I might be...slightly exaggeratin' but eliminatin'
These snakes wit affiliation got the system scared
Like mice durin' extermination
Erasin' the rhymes rapper's lines wit time and patience
Takin' no shorts, thoughts like woo blunts I'm lacin'
Comin' down like condensation givin' proper information
My interpretation of the rap business
Since my christenin' I wanted to be a rap technician
Splittin' mics in half for my fans when I'm spittin'
Never forgettin' how rap started from the beginnin'
But most of these ignorant rappers talkin' 'bout money they gettin'
Bars they spittin', cars they whippin', nice clothes they dipped in
Hoes they hittin', 9's they grippin'
But they gotta expand they mind and rhyme somethin' different
For instance, that's what I be kickin' in my writtens
But if you listen pay attention positivity's mentioned
My composition has a 50 slash 50 division
I can please both crowds no vocals is my intentions
When I do that wit rap I expand my comprehension
Extendin' my knowledge like goin' to college at Princeton
The industry's missin' and interpretation that's sickenin'
They was wishin' I presented so now I'm forever in it
The business...
