We got room keys (Whoooo!)

[Hook - R. Kelly] w/ {Swizz Beatz in background}
Girl you wanna come to my hotel
Baby I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin the way, you carry yo self girl
And I wanna get wit you, cause you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me

Well then I'm gon' take her friend (Say whaaa?!)
But if, mami is wit it then, mami could get it if
Mami a rider, I'mma slide up inside the bomb

I know you tryin to get yo freak on too (c'mon)

Cause see, we could go get it crackin, but you know what'll happen
