[Hook – Cassidy]
Bitch I jump on beats and body shit, I body shit
I fuck an ugly bitch, her body thick, her body thick
Homo, I’ll let you and the tommy kiss, the tommy kiss
Don’t make me cross you off my body list, my body list
You fuck with us, I catch a body bitch, a body bitch
You try your luck, I catch a body bitch, a body bitch
Don’t give a fuck, I catch a body bitch, a body bitch
I catch the dutch then catch a body bitch, a body bitch

[Verse 1 – Chubby Jag]
You ain’t heard I keep the Smith around, niggas flipping pounds
Tryna ride but you gon hit the ground, leave you missing clown
I got hella niggas tripping now cause niggas chipping now
Get you wet then make you bitches drown, like I’m fishing now
Hustler got me on my chicken now, in the kitchen now
Flow so coke they think I’m sniffing now, think I’m whipping now
I got all these bitches stripping now, groupies wishing now
On my grind it ain’t no sitting down, ain’t no switching now
My big bro just made em 250 I’m on a mission now
Wear that crown because it’s fitting now, catch you slipping now
Used to hate, I bet they listen now, clock is ticking now
Battle rappers mad, they dissing now, cats is hissing now
In the field, look like I’m pitching now
Hands is itching now
Tell that ho that I’m on point tonight, I got my fencing down
Push that rock, I’m like a Piston now, fiends is sticking round
Move that weight, they think I’m lifting now
My muscle ripping out, spitting now
I catch a body bitch, mister body shit
Shotty spit and make this body lift, 2 shots his body split
If I’m Shaquille, Cortez is Vadi bitch
Tell em stop me bitch, watch your mouth or shit get sloppy bitch
Catch a body quick, body bitch

[Verse 2 - Cassidy]
It’s C A double dollar sign, I got to grind
I started from the bottom, bottom line
Don’t get out of line
My trigger finger need some [?]
This 50 cal of mine, will remind you cats of Columbine
Get shot a lot of times, a lot of times
My mind set, is complex
I’m on the grind so I ain’t tryna rest
I’m tryna sign checks
I been the bird man since you was sucking on your mom’s breasts
Playing with the heat and I don’t mean that team Lebron left
I’m the clouds cause I hit that loud and take a big breath
Imma never pass a piss test, I make them bricks stretch
So many bullet hoes from this tec, your shirt look fish net
When I shoot ya, I’m your present, past, and future, Christmas
I know some little dudes still in middle school that ain’t got shit to lose
You piss em off they let that pistol off, they think that shit is cool
It’s not a joke, I got to smoke
I’m stressed, if I ain’t had no pot to smoke I would’ve got a stroke
Y’all forgot I’m dope, I got to spaz, body bags
I’m the truth, I take a polygraph, you too cocky Cass
Cause my cocky ass deserve to be, I do it purposely
I’m not a copycat that copies cats, that shit is perjury
You still could rap then why you stealing raps? That shit is burglary
You a burglar, you get murdered, first second and third degree
That shit disturbing me, why would you hate on me and Chub raps
That’s hard to understand like the words to a Young Thug rap
