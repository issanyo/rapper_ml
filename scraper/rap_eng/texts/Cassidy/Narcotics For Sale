[Hook: Cassidy]
I put in work in the street, I put in work in the street
I got that kush, got that (??), and that purple for cheap
Narcotic for sale, narcotic for sale
Is what we tell them dudes moving all (??)
I put in work in the street, I put in work in the street
I got that boy and that girl you could purchase for cheap
Narcotic for sale, narcotic for sale
I'm the hustler, if you want it, then I got it for sale

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
My trap game and my gat game is phenomenal
I still got that Phil Donahue and that Madonna too
I did done a crime or two, been to prison a time or two
Listen, if it's drama I'mma show you what the llama do
I spit, cook crack, and I put that on my Mamma to
You remind me of a comic on Comic View, you's a fucking comedian
Put a slug in skull, spray blood on the wall like I'm fucking graffiti-ing
You need Red Cross, cause you dead soft dog
I'll pop the damn led off, and knock ya' damn head off
I got two whores in a two door, with the head off
Chill homie, you mad cause my wheels chromey
And I got enough on me to cop another wheel homie
I'm a winner, you ain't even eat dinner, you still hungry
I real homies and homies that's real phony
So, fuck how niggas feel, I'm keeping my steel on me

[Verse 2: Chubby Jag]
Look, yeah I'm the truth boy why lie
Stay around goons, why try, tell the guy bye
Teeth to, fly by, windows down, drive-by
Peach copper coloured jet, cause I make the pies fly
Could smell that (??) when my niggas ride by
Used to move the nickel bags, hand in hand, high five
Chubby, the shotty rounds will make your head rot
Red dot will shut a nigga body down, head shot
Led pop, we gunning boy, see you niggas running boy
Put the work in the streets, how the fuck is we unemployed
Boss you should know me nigga, bring the cash home
Get the blast on with my mask on, like a goalie nigga
Popping, with a style you niggas can't steal, you niggas ain't real
Me nigga, looking at the king nigga, (??)
Paint your whole house red, I deserve a paint deal
Freddy Kruger, fuck 'em niggas dreams, I'm what you can't kill

[Hook]
