The block pop, so da strip fall

Rocks got a fist full. Bull pop shit, dat hot shit I got a clip fo'

When I start sparkin', it be barkin' like pitbulls

Matta fact rotweilers when I let dem shots holla

Chicks on my cock, I'm still on the block holla

S'Cops on da block, they still gon' cop holla
I g-got sense, and dass why I got dollas

I was told the rules, I'm old school, like my pop fatha

I was showed da moves, schooled by the olda dudes

How to show improve, so I move like a soldier move

Real militant, I'm I'll still killin' it
I'm real. Guys dass paralyzed and still feelin' it

Yeah I'm still on feet and my toes
Gettin' higher den da President, you sweeta den doze
Gettin' higher den a nose bleed, see to muh shows
Fuck a mayback, I pull da back seats to da rolls
Fuck a GT, I pull up in a CLS
The guts soft like muh female breats
Is it a D-12? Yes
I cop da un-copable nigga, you can't stop the un-stopable nigga, I pop a shot thru you niggas
And I was like a pop to you niggas. I gave you a flow. Adopted you niggas. I did a lot fo' you niggas
And this da fuckin' thanks I get?
You my son, you should thank my dick
You take my shit, flip it around, and now you think you sick?
I guess you think you Cas, but I think you trash
And I spank dat ass. You ain't fuckin' with me
You wouldn't even rap like dat if it wasn't fer me
Wow! I been had my weight up
How you gon' battle me with a style dat I made up?
Wow! When I'm home, it's envy
I feelin' like the? Bob?, when he was on da fone with Jimmy
Wow! What the fuck is goin' on out hea'?
What the fuck is niggas doin' out hea'?
Niggas drawn out hea'. Ya block hot? I put a drawin' out thea'
My block hot, your shit warm out thea'
So we goin' out thea'. Set up shop and get it on out thea'
I'm on point like a thorn out hea'. Come to Philly, I'm a don out hea'
Yeah youh know I'm a boss dawg. Nah, this ain't IZOD, it's LaCross dawg
I floss dawg and I stay with my jewels on
You prolly wouldn't see dis much ice in a hail storm
It's nuttin to flash, but fuckin' with Cas will get you buck or buck --n- a half
Cause' it's only a hand full of rappers dass touchin' da cash
And most of dem are getting' fucked in they ass
There's snakes up in the grass, but Cass gon' blast when da beef is on
I walk with the shells, and I ain't got no Adidas on
And I squeezed da John, even if da law watchin'
I'm too hard. Da rap version of Bernard Hopkins. Nigga
