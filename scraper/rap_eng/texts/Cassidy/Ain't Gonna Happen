[Intro]
But it ain’t gonna happen
Oh shit, never
Niggas talking about I fell off
What?
You can’t be serious
So I’m about to jump in my bag
Just in case y’all niggas forgot
How I give you music, yeah

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I was a kid hustling, ribs touching, grinding for a grub
3 wings will hurt you when I’m in the hub
Hand to hand in the drub with my hand on the snub
Cause man I’m thug, is you a man or a bug
I’m back in that damn bar with my hand in the glove
On my grizzle, I give you a half grand for a dub
I’m working now, got the sour kush and the purple now
I got it if you tryna cop it
You ain’t gotta search around
I purchase pounds and flirt around with that white chick
That white shit will have your nose red like a circus clown
If I ain’t laying verses down, then I’m on the strip
I got that work flipping like them bitches in the circus now
Its like the universal soul when that work is sold
And I got the roxies and perks if you tryna purchase those
Thirsty hoes popping pills like it’s birth control
500 milligrams, I’m a drug dealer man
You gotta play your cards right but if you deal a hand
You could make a killing man and blow like a ceiling fan
Listen, sipping liquors' a good feeling man
I was a Cognac cat, now I’m a Tequila man
I’m wrapping grands up in my son's silly bands
And my pinky ring cost bout a half of kilogram
I was on some living in my mama house shit
Now I’m in Neiman spending mortage money on an outfit
I clean my jewels with the shit you clean your mouth with
Either Crest or Colgate success is my soul mate
You so fake, I’m the truth, not a pretender
I got one-liners niggas with Alzheimer's remember
And I could fight, but even a ninja could get injured
So I keep the hammer on me like Thor from the Avengers
I’m like a super hero, you’s a weirdo
So I get you robbed like De Niro
When you say hustle birds
That get on my fucking nerves
Cause you ain't never fuck with them birds, you like a scarecrow
My weed green but got orange hairs though
And it’s real strong like that man Samson when his hair grow
I put in years, yo years ago
You could barely flow so prepare for your burial
You hear me, yo?
Cause I’m the illest alive
You want my title, then you must be suicidal nigga, Willing to die
I’m still on my job, I ain’t retire nigga
I’m fire nigga, you say you hot
But stop singing to the choir nigga
I still eat you up, I ain’t on a diet nigga
You could get your ass chewed, quick like fast food
The last dude that tried to body Cass
Got every bone in his body smashed
And thrown in a body cast
I kick somebody ass like karate class
Be cash jumping in this Jet Li bag
If you owe me cash, I’m grabbing the ski mask
And the Glock you in hot water like a tea bag
I don’t need a G pass, I go where I wanna go
Cause I could rumble yo, and niggas know my gun will blow
I’m undefeated fighting murder cases, I'm 1 and 0
It was a set back, but you gotta respect that
Before I took 10 steps forward I had to step back
If you doubt that I’ma step up, you got me f’d up
I’m still regretting all the chicken that I messed up
But still start spending the chicken soon as the check cut
I’m dressed up, snap back and a fresh cut
Guess what, my flow so sick, I should go get checked up
Cause I’m real ill, feel where I’m coming from
I’m in the Escalade, rims taller than my youngest son
I just bought another gun, if you talk stupid
I’ma start to shoot it, and I put that on my other son
I’m not pressed to catch another case
But you a son of a bitch and I'll say it to your mother face
The boy rhymes got the best lines
But this next line is an oxymoron
Niggas love to hate
Feel me nigga, I’m from Philly nigga
Still repping my city nigga, I just hustle in another state
You motherfuckers fake, I can’t fucking wait
To see you, confront you then punch you in your fucking face

[Outro]
I mean, there’s a big difference
Between what they do and what we do, mayhem music!
Damn that shit was dope!
There’s a wide variety of mayhem here
