[Hook: Cassidy]
I'm on the grind for the money
They say time money, so a nigga can't afford to waste (time)
I had to write this song, cause life ain't wrong
You be gone in a matter of (time)
Sex, money and drugs, you wanna be a thug
Well the judge going to give yo' ass (time)
But no matter what happens, you can't go back in
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I'm the best that ever did, admit it
If you don't feel I'm a threat, then I'm willing to bet that I'm better with it
The rest better forget it
Cause they ain't never did it like I'm doing it now, I'm through screwing around
I'm a prove they all lose, they flows is old school
I'm a show them old dudes how a new nigga sound
I'm trying to feel Hov's shoes when he through with the crown
So when I'm saying a rhyme, I'm like Jay in his prime
'Till the day I resign, I'm a stay on the grind
And just take it one day at a time
I'm tryna play my position, I could be sitting on the T-O-P
Not in prison with my D-O-G's
But I could achieve it as long as I leave it to G-O-D
And stay away from all those C-O-P's, cause we O-G's
And ayo, I could teach you how to get richer without sitting behind bars like a bottle of liquor, nigga

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
This for the dudes in the spot now, holding the block down
Making moves, thinking it's cool to be locked down
You dudes better play it cool when the cops 'round
Cause them boys in blue refuse to be stopped now
You gotta eat dog, but ain't sweet dog
You could be liviing in the prison or deceased dog
And in the hood is like a little Middle East dog
You getting cheddar and you better keep the peace dog
Before they bury you and never get released dog
They'll destroy yah if your lawyer ain't a beast dog
But when you be starving, it be hard to keep the peace dog
The poor people need to eat, not a speech dog
Shit it's real, niggas bills ain't cheap dog
There's families without no water or no heat dog
There's kids freezing that can't even go to sleep dog
They nose runny, close bummy, and they sneaks dogged
Mothers crying, brothers dying in the streets dog
That's why they turning into murderers and thieves dog
They also turn to the drugs for relief dog
Rules of the streets, what the schools don't teach dog
I ain't gotta be a minister to preach dog
But you can make it through your faith and your belief dog
It ain't a myth that history repeats dog
So you gotta grind 'till your time is complete dog

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Neo did the beat, I'm just rhyming to it
But to write every rhyme, I put time into it
Put my heart, put my time into it
There's a lot of things I wanna do, but don't got time to do it
Cause there's only 24 hours in a day
And 6 of them hours I'm sleep
I need about 2 more hours just to shower and eat
To pray I need an hour at least
And the rest of the day, I'm in the studio devouring beats
