Swizz Beats & The Game:
Swizz Beats:
Aim 4 the head
When you see 'em go get 'em nigga
Aim 4 the head
When you see 'em go get 'em nigga
Aim 4 the head
When you see 'em go get 'em nigga
The Game:
Cass let they ass know you ain't playin' wit' 'em
Swizz Beats:
Aim 4 the head
When you see 'em go get 'em nigga
Aim 4 the head
When you see 'em go get 'em nigga
Aim 4 the head
When you see 'em go get 'em nigga
Cassidy:
Game let them lames know you ain't playin' wit' 'em

Verse 1
The Game:
I got my slugs on
Gettin' my thug on
New Aero prim low Giovanni rims, oh
The Phantom got curtains you can't see through the tint so
Bought a 45 put the beer on the window
It's me and Swiggle for shizzle
V twizzle the pistols
Cock it back if you carry a missile
Then cross both of your arms nigga fold it back
If you missed Soulja Slim do da Nolia Clap
All recliner seats in the Rover back
Yeah it's me and Young Cass 'til HOV come back
You wanna see us both dead then load ya gat
We be da first niggas to bring Pennyloafers back
Why niggas wanna see my R-I-P
Empty the clip in a nigga before I D-I-E
Prayin' on my downfall like B-I-G
I be in da cockpit ride dirty like T-I-P
Po-po pull me over wanna see ID
Searchin' my shit, tryna find my 3 times 3
They don't know I got 4 times 4 in the back seat
With enough bodies on to get a nigga 5 times 5
Other niggas snitch on 'em
Like if you got the Rover parked crooked in the front he might have bricks on 'em
I send the lamp back like a brotha in Rich Porter
When I bone you again you a buck 50 like 6 Quarters, yeah

Verse 2
Cassidy:
Shit real I know how baggin' a whole brick feel
Big deal hit da garage and switch wheels
My chicks real with the MÃ©nage and tip drills
Gimmie a massage then show me how them lips feel
And I'ma grind cuz im shinein' on the strip steel
And I grip steel, still keep the clips filled
Everything I spit real
Everything I spit ill
Everything I spit sick for real
Ain't shit switch
Ain't shit change
Like Rick James I'm rich bitch
Get change, big chain to wrist glist
I'm with Game I'ma make cake like biscuits
My album went gold in a month, that was a quick flip
Don't say shit bitch
Cuz niggas with the lip get
Every one in the gun 'til it go click click
And I'ma switch clips and squeeze like toothpaste
Palm over my forearm so I could shoot straight
I'm 'bout to make it hard to eat like toothaches
My flow dope like i go in the booth and shoot base
Deuce deuce the 'scapes in the coupe grape
I ain't broke I got coke by the suitcase
My boots laced I got the base in them white keys
I'ma bout to cop the Convertible crib like Ice-T's
And dat ice on your sleeve dat's light cheese
I spend 100 Gs a year on white Tees

Hook

Bridge
The Game:
If you wanna go to war then pop sumthin'
If you wanna go to war then pop sumthin'
If you wanna go to war then pop sumthin'
You can't afford a Swizz track nigga stop frontin'
(Repeat)
