[Hook]
You think it can't happen?
Even Kennedy got shot
Think you untouchable?
Even Kennedy got shot
Think you Big Willie?
Even Kennedy got shot
This ain't a dance record
This is real hip hop
Rather eat crumbs with bums
Then stakes with snakes
Look me in my eyes, face to face
I hit you on camera and take the take
Even Kennedy got shot (blaow) stay in yo' place

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
You not The President, You not the Pope, you not the king
So it's not a thing
For you to get shot and them shots to sting
They shot Abe Lincoln, Kennedy, Dr. King, Malcolm X, Biggie and 2Pac when they popped the thing
So yo, you should know if it's goons that want you dead
And they comin' for your head
When they see them shots will bring
Shells will make you yell and it sound like an Opera singing
When the pistol hits you with more rounds than a boxing ring
Man, they could give a damn if your chains and watches bling
All them clothes and them cars ain't gonna stop a thing
Seriously, this Murder rap, I murder cats lyrically
I'm reckless, Papoose might get arrested for Conspiracy
You should be scared of me
I'll embarrass ya
Listen if you think you are competition then you tripping like a traveler
I was a battler
But I made it so you stranglers could get assassinated
For assassinating my Character

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Papoose]
I got bullets with rappers names on 'em
All loaded up in my black fifth
Boy, my clip look like a track list
How you gonna stop me from popping hammers, dropping proper grammar?
I'm a tell you like Kanye told Sway, "You ain't got the answers!"
Big Gun Terminator searching for Syracona
Gangsters move in silence just like they J in Marijuana
I pack a weapon
A grown man with underage guns, my teck 9 and my MAC 11
I'm a pimp boy particular
Penmanship distributor
Period at the end of a Paragraph finisher
Always been on the grind of my work, drive is vehicular
Homicide with the Horse Power of Six Cylinders
Drown in your own blood, die slow, you deserve it
You can suck a big fat dick, swallow, slurp it and burp it
Your a serpent of the devil
You serpent, don't want your service
Because you rather serve swine instead of serving a purpose

[Hook]
