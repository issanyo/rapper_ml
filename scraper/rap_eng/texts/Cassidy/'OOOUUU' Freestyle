"Ooouuu"
Yeah...
Turn me up a little bit bish
Alot of niggas jumped on this Young M.A joint and used tough flow...
I got little something a little different I'm gonna do to this joint, I ain't want to but they made me

About to get ugly, the bar barbarian!

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Check it man, I ball out like a naked man
Yes your man is wild high (how high?)
I'm looking down on Method Man
When I catch a man, it's going down like nine eleven
I'm not going to dial nine eleven like "COME ARREST A MAN!"
I'm pulling bullets the size of a pepsi can
I'll let the can shake so the spray can wet your man
My new heater's bullets as big as a two litre
I spray rounds and turn the greyhound into a two seater
I'll let you neither, put a hole in you?
I should've put you in a hole that's a few metres
I don't like you neither, pop shit get your mommy shot
You a son of a bitch I blame your mom and pop
Run in your mommy's spot, choke the bitch out like Tommy dot
Your mom will drop, hit your pop with the tommy, then let the tommy pop
I know there's some slimy cops but they work for me
I'd rather pay what they charge then get charged with first degree
They searching me but he fly with both of his gats
Soon as we landing he ain't need one, now both of us strapped
If you don't close or open the trap, don't open your trap
I'm turning weed into oil, turning coke into crack
I'm in the Ghost with the toast in my lap
Watching Power, rooting for 50 because that nigga Ghost is a rat, facts
Scope on the gat, I can't see far, woah
Everyday a black rapper get robbed, ask BR
Chicks go to DR, get alot of ass shots
Then all they going to post on the Gram is alot of ass shots
I can tell it ain't real girl, but with all these shemales it's hard For me to tell if you a real girl
We living in a real world, where some men steal girls panties
The trannies more feminine than real girls
I did alot of dirt, and it's hard to get past that
Sometimes I just have flashbacks and still hurl
I'm real thorough, known to break a bitches heart
If she tries to get too close I gotta break this shit apart
Because the key to getting smart, is learning how to play dumb
And the key to getting old, is learning how to stay young
The key is to get A gun, you might not need to spray one
But at least you got it to grab in case a bad day come
I'm A One, your life is at stake because my youngin's wild
Snatch your son, make his ransom a couple hundred thou'
Don't get him rocked, playing around with them Benz
Because my hands make the stick go (BRAP!) drummer style
Whole case, closed case, I ain't gotta come to trial
Shed so much blood it'd make a vampire stomach growl
Wow, get your son's neck wrung
Hold him by his ears, throw him down the stairs
Now you gotta step-son
Imma' make a suggestion, come up with the fucking cash
And run that
Before you get your son back, cut in half
I'm busting gats, I'm with this shit, bubble guts
I'm about to get a jump and it's my turn, double dutch
Yo I'm about to switch the hustle up
Because these rats fuck with these undercovers like they're trying to snuggle up
My ratchet, ratchet, we don't ever cuddle up
All I do is feed her, cock her then finger pop her
It's me and my girlfriend so I bring the choppa
Everywhere I go at, but you already know that
Scar shot, bald spot, your hair will never grow back
People jaw drop if you ain't wearing no hat
I moved out of Philly, but every time I go back
I thank God because I done been all over the whole map
I chose rap, so that, my kids
Could live way better than I did before rap
I'm pro-black I know our lives matter
But if a black man try me he probably gonna die after
Don't fuck with me, I'm cocky because I get it popping
And I go so hard, no Viagra
I got a Thai platter, Bangkok beef steak
Wait, my bars so hard if you bite them your teeth hurt
I'm coming out the trap, cuffed to a brief case
If you don't think I'm dope then you must be smoking that free base
I gotta lot of homies and alot of them is hungry
So I could get you killed for some french fries and a cheese steak
From my first single release date, I was making up bands
And they ain't walk to Brooklyn for no cheese cake
People say they need cake to buy hats and sneakers
I need cake to buy gats, I'm an action seeker
I used to go to school with folders and trapper keepers
Until I got older, started trapping and selling crack to teachers
Talking back to teachers
Then go bust out the car window of all my wackest teachers
I dropped out and got it popping in the game, grinding
Now the diamonds milli rocking in the chain, shining
I'm arguably on some nicer than Eminem shit
But you ain't in bottom five dead or alive, you should've been quit
'Ew', when I'm writing I make the pen sick
It vomit ink all on the paper
My penmanship been sick
When I come to your hospital and poison your ivy
It's going to do more than make your skin itch, nimwit
I been the best in the game
So when you talking about BARS put respect on my name

Outro:

Ooouuu, these haters on my body shake them off
Ooouuu, these haters on my body shake them off
I got the flow, I got the bars
These haters on my body shake them off
I'm undefeated, never lost
These haters on my body shake them off
Ooouuu
Ooouuu
Ooouuu
These haters on my body shake them off
