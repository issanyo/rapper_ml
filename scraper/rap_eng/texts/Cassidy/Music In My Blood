(I can feel it)
Music be flowing through my veins
(Oh I can feel it)
Music be flowing through my veins
The game change people, they don't love me the same
But music in my blood, I got love for the game(x2)

I've played the drugs scene, thats sold drugs to drug fiends
Coz I love cream but music is in my blood stream
Im heavy'O on the radio in the club scene
My fans don't understand what say no to drugs mean

Blood diamonds, bentley love like dove cream
I watch dirty money, but make sure the tub clean
Nigga my bars off the richter
Is the dude that rock a lotta jews like (Hitler)

If a nigga try stop me from getting richer
I spit them shots, and pop niggas like ur sister
I clap it, me and the ratchett a bad mixture
When I hit ya your gonna need more than talinor lixor

I spit the chopper doc won't be able to fix ya, brother
Your mother, and all your babies will miss ya
I'm from philly, I ball but no im not a sixer
Barry not illegal either, I carry illegal heaters

You not about what you said you were 'bout
My lifes a movie don't get edited out

And, you should watch who your wife let in the house
Coz I ain't sleep with her but I slept with her mouth

Im pathetic, hell-a-don, contastetics in her mouth
Skeet skeet, got onna dem teeth pregnant in her mouth
Niggas complain bout the rap game
Cats in the game, ain't rapping the same, raps changed

They like Cas we need you to come back man
Raps so lame, you got that crack cocaine
My flow flames, caroesine and phutane, gasoline and propane
I ain't playin no games

Back when I started to rap, I ain't had no change
I was commited with, stuck with it until the dough came
Thats why I got love for this music
Not only did I write it I produced it
This Exclusive

Music be flowing through my veins
(I can feel it)
Music be flowing through my veins
The game change people dont love me the same
But music in my blood, I got love for the game (x3)

Music be flowing through my veins (x4)
