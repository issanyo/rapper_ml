[Intro: Cassidy]
Whose side are you leanin' on
I'm leanin' on the Lord's side
I lean, I lean, I lean, I lean
I'm leanin' on the Lord's side

[Hook: Angie Stone] (x2)
Whose side are you leanin' on
I'm leanin' on the Lord's side
I lean, I lean, I lean, I lean
I'm leanin' on the Lord's side

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Here's a story about a youngin' that started off strugglin'
He didn't like his life so he started off hustlin'
He was doin good in the hood with the cane
Whole hood knew his name, he had neighborhood fame
Now he stays dressed up
Just copped the fresh trucks
Stepped his rep up, plus he stepped his connect up
But guess what, he don't even mess with his old niggas
They hatin' cause he makin' more money those niggas
So one day when he was chillin on the block, dealin' rock
Tryin' to make a killin' on the block
Some dudes came, masks down, told him lay his ass down
Then they blasts rounds and started fillin' him with shots
He can't feel his legs, got grazed in his head yo
He might be paralyzed but he could've been dead though
He on his bed yo, prayin' to God
If he survives that he promise to stay on his side

[Hook: Angie Stone] (x2)

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
Here's a story about a shorty chasin' the cream
Her daddy was an inmate, her mommy was a fiend
Her grandmoms old so she couldn't get control of her
It was all love 'til the drugs took a hold of her
First it was liquor then it was weed
Then next came the wet then the syrup and V's, E's
Oxy Contin, she poppin' them pills
And if you got a couple dollars she'll hop in your wheel (For real)
Until one day a nigga with paper
Took her out, got her pilled up then he raped up
Fam even had a camcorder and taped her
As soon as her high faded, shorty felt violated
So she stopped gettin' high all the damn time
Only person she could talk to was her grandmom
Now every Sunday she be goin' to church with her
She leaned on the Lord, now he startin' to work with her

[Hook: Angie Stone] (x2)

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Here's a story about a young rapper named Cassidy
He started off at 13, I mean he actually
Signed his first deal when he was still goin' to high school
10th grade, way back then he was a fly dude
He played by the rules, determined to get cake
He started off battlin' and rippin' the mixtapes
But he didn't take the same path that the rest do
He dropped a debut that was highly successful
That's when the respect came, that's when the checks came
He realized life is like playin' a chess game
Him and Swizz, they started makin' the next album
They say when you make more money expect problems
But the problem that he faced was unheard of
They locked him up, no bail and charged him with murder
But now he got his freedom restored
And he livin' his dream that's why he leanin' on the side of the Lord
