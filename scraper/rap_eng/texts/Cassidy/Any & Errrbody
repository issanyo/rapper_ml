[Hook: Fred Money (w/ Cassidy)]
Errrbody want to rap, Errrbody want to trap
Errrbody got a strap (PPBBBLLLAATT!!, PPBBBLLLAATT!!)
Errrbody in the bag, Errrbody want to battle
Errrbody calling Cass (Yeeeaaahhh!!)
Errrbody's trash
Go to errrbody page, errrbody counting cash (uh)
Errrbody getting tagged
Potato on the [?] errrbody getting mashed (facts)
Errrbody, errrbody
(What these fuck niggas talking 'bout)
Errrbody
(Nigga I'm talking to you
You ain't got to ask who I'm talking 'bout)
Errrbody, errrbody
(What these fuck niggas talking 'bout)
Errrbody
(Nigga I'm talking to you
You ain't got to ask who I'm talking 'bout)

[Verse: Cassidy]
I'm high off the molly I popped
That loud got my eyes red, fuck an eyedrop
We got more syrup than the fucking IHOP
Pulling liquor out the box like the fucking high top
Why not? Somebody gon' get killed
I'm on niggas' heels yeah like a pair of high tops
He think he fly 'til the slugs spray
Like bug spray, the cig hit him hard like a fly swat
Uh, slugs everywhere
Blood everywhere, the paramedics couldn't find a dry spot
Put his thoughts in the sky
Having him looking like 4th of July when I let the 4 5 pop
I got him hustling on my block
A nigga getting to the chicken, got a pocket full of livestock
Try to plot, I catch a nigga creeping
I'm sleeping with one eye open like a Cyclops
They want to see me do my thing again
Ars like, "You need to step back in the ring again"
Yo the nerve of that nigga, I'll murder that nigga
I ain't tryna go back to the bing again
Battle rap my cup of tea
But yo that nigga know he can't fuck with me
At the battle a couple days ago
Yo he told me out his own mouth that he look up to me
I heard when he was in the fucking D
That Trick Trick jumped on the damn stage
He ain't got a shotgun or a calico
The bul had piss dripping down his pants leg
I ain't with the BS
I'm not the game but I play with the 4, no PS
I ride out, no brake light
I strip a nigga naked in the daylight, no T-Rex
So show respect
Or get smacked cause I put in grind time, no Drect
You know how shit be
I got him tight like Big T in an XL V-neck
If you push the wrong buttons, the don will shoot hollows
All you gon' hear is the gun sounds
I got the Winchester deluxe loaded
So it will be a murder after one round
Yo, I'm 5000 and oh
Undefeated, err' body want a shot at me
But I got it mastered, it will be a disaster
And ain't nobody gonna Math Hoffa me
On the internet, niggas talk greasy
But soon as they see me, they cop a plea
Like, "I know I said a lot
But if we battled, that will be the biggest shot that I ever got"
Niggas better stop with all the babbling
Battling in Cass DNA
I'm in my bag like Frito Lay
If they don't cut the check, what the fuck you expect me to say
"Get 'em the fuck outta here"
I've been spending change, I been in the game for a lot of years
Yeah, yo you little niggas featherweight
And I'm a big heavyweight, Vladimir
Yo I know that I got 'em scared
Yeah, but they can't do shit about it
I'm a problem with bars, how can niggas doubt it
And I've been a hustler, yo forget about it
Man, I used to stand in the corner
With the marijuana and pitch hard
Tryna make cash, like I need straight cash
No coupons, no gift card
Hustling is a gift
I had more trees and snow on me than a Christmas card
Aw, all these rap niggas pussy
Thinking 'bout eating niggas up get my dick hard
Pause, don't nobody think y'all hot
You got a hard head but be dead from a scar shot
Y'all never strapped like a mall cop
And every song y'all drop, I ain't tryna hear like a bald spot
When them shots blaze, if you not saved
You better pray to the child of God
Before I bang you and send you to the angels
Leave you in the dust like formaldehyde
Yo, I ain't got no real beef
But if I do, I kill beef like a cow done died
Shorty the 40 cal will rise
And put a hole in your head, silver dollar size
The hustler on some trap shit
This rap shit just a alibi
I sling cocaine, like King James
Right before the game, let the powder fly
And my clientele loving it
I got straight drop butter shit
And I'm spitting that cook up
To pick my rap book up, I need an oven mit
I'm on some gutter shit
I don't even understand how niggas listen to that other shit
"Yo that's hard" "Nah that's bars"
But niggas already know my government
I'm getting gwap and I'm loving it
My wide body can't fit in the parking spot
And they won't let me park it in the parking lot
Cause they know that their insurance can't cover it
For the fuck of it
I'm the type of guy to put cyanide in a cup of piss
To show you niggas love in the club
Like you don't fuck with Cris, want a cup of this
Errrbody talking shit, errrbody on my dick
Errrbody got to chill
Errrbody know I'm nice
Catch a body on the mic, errrbody getting killed
Errrbody know I'm ill
Eat any rapper up, errrbody is a meal
Errrbody know the deal
I'll body anybody, fuck how errrbody feel
(feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel)
Fuck how errrbody feel
(feel, feel, feel, feel, feel)
Fuck how errrbody feel

[Hook]

[Outro: Cassidy]
(What I'm talking 'bout
What I'm talking 'bout)
Yeah errrbody can get it man
I'm on my shit right now
I don't give a fuck who take it personal
Who feels some type of way
I'm right here man, come holler at me
And I ain't just directing this at battle rap niggas
Cause I used to be in the same bag battling all day everyday
So I feel where y'all coming from
But why is y'all niggas on my dick?
Keep talking about
"I want to see Cass get back in the ring
I want to see him battle again"
Don't worry about what the fuck I'm doing
Y'all just keep battling them corny ass niggas y'all been battling
And do what the fuck y'all want to do
Im'ma do what the fuck I want to do
I ain't gonna let no nigga influence me
I'm a made nigga
I do what the fuck I want to do
And until they get the chicken up and make it worth me stepping back in the ring
You'll probably never see it
I know y'all want to see it
I know even my fans want to see it
But there's a lot of shit that I wanted to see that I couldn't see
Like I wanted to see LeBron get in the Slam Dunk competition
I wanted to see Allen Iverson come back to the league
I wanted to see Pacquiao fight Floyd
It's a lot of shit that I wanted to happen that ain't happened
So that if it don't happen, fuck it
