[Hook]
They expected us to be on DVDs talking reckless
They never expected for us to get connected
But you gotta respect it, expect the unexpected
But you gotta respect it, expect the unexpected
Ayo I’ve been sick everybody getting infected
They never expected for us to get connected
But you gotta respect it, expect the unexpected
But you gotta respect it, expect the unexpected

[Verse 1: Murda Mook]
I’m Murda Mook and Cass track on you niggas
Yeah, pulled the rabbit out the hat on you niggas
Back track to the past smack on you niggas
That was half flat, Nelson ran rap on you niggas
You thought you would've never saw this
But I probably would've have a better chance driving next to your car seeing a swordfish
Applaud this, this is history
Real niggas meet each other and connect instantly
It was never no beef it was crabmeat
But watch your speak or you could sleep where the crabs sleep
When I was young I used to wanna be an athlete
But I admit I really couldn't shoot plus I had bad feet
Hardly sleep so I meditate more
I still spit sick like what’s the medication for
I still spit clips that'll levitate your boy
Open up his top floor like the elevator door, ding!!!
I'm just tryna get millions
Tryna get bread off squares like Sicilian
Trynna get straight but I gotta keep dealin’
Damn the rock landed on me, I'm a pilgrim
I got the juice believe it’s that raw
Niggas ask me what’s shaking the leaves in that jar
Was down in Miami, Khaled tried to scoop me
I'm a S550 though Khaled had a hooptie
All you niggas groupies, you could call me Mookie
Playrock cats stay cocked and they shoot me
Bet yall, when I let off, got a better arm than Bret Favre
Bullets hit yo chest watch yo chest fall
Watch yo breath leave up out yo chest when that tec spark
Mets par that’s ready to sketch y’all
Heckler & Koch that'll dead y’all, infrared wreck y’all
Plus I got an eagle that'll peck y’all, BOOM!!!
I'm a detonator, Schwarzenegger
Strong as a nigga on that OJ flavor
No, no neighbors, God I'm the Christian
And the Catholic don't hate uh, I'm the savior
Spit it like Satan, Hell you forsaken
Cooking motherfuckers in my apron, DAMN!!!
Murda known for spitting raw bars
That'll deck a nigga like 54 cards, EASY!!!

[Cassidy]
Ayo Mook they wanted us to battle, talk reckless, spark weapons
But we met and we got connected, so niggas better expect the unexpected
For real

[Hook]
Ayo I’ve been sick everybody getting infected
They never expected for us to get connected
But you gotta respect it, expect the unexpected
But you gotta respect it, expect the unexpected
They expected us to be on DVDs talking reckless
They never expected for us to get connected
But you gotta respect it, expect the unexpected
But you gotta respect it, expect the unexpected

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
I got shit sold, like Michael Jackson with the big nose
Before he turned white like the shit I whip on a lit stove
I sold rock and got sick flows
About to take the game over like Hova, ask Ms. Knowles
I'm on the grind til the strip close
That’s why my crib so big they gave it its own zip code
Bricks get sold every day I’m good
I just bought a house about the size of my old neighborhood
One button could remove the Mercedes hood
I’m on my job and the pay is good, you dig me?
But I'm tryna run my city like the mayor should
I’ve been on my grind ever since they elected Mayor Goode
If you play the hood its gon eventually move
So I started hustling in elementary school
Getting cold cash, the richest nigga in my whole class
I was so cool, name known through the whole school
I’m no fool so drugs I wasn't selling none
I wasn't tryna catch a felony cause I was hella young
I was selling gum and bags of potato chips
But even back then I was on some get paper shit
You see me, I'm on some “hi hater” shit
I'm on the top floor, my condo on some sky scraper shit
And my crib is on some 18-acre shit
That’s a large house but yours the size of my doghouse
That’s a small house, that shit there cheap
My rottweiler spot got more square feet
I'm the one they wanna hear speak
Cause everybody out here weak, and niggas wanna hear heat
It’s like my knife keep cutting like Jazzy Jeff
And my guns keep banging like Premier beats
I got the most punchlines the most analogies
And the shit I'm rapping happened in actuality
I hold weight no calories
So my jewels frozen like a Sub Zero fatality
And where I'm at, it’s Mortal Kombat
But when you take shots ock it’s not gon be cognac
When I role up you get smoked like a dime sack
I’ll clap at you every time we come in contact
Or I'll put a contract on your head man
And give it like a day or two and you'll be a dead man
I ain't scared man, we could do this shit
I been ludicrous since fetus in mom’s uterus
And you a bitch you ain't never have heart nigga
You ain't the shit just ‘cause you on the charts nigga
I'm the shit you a fart nigga
Man I can't stop shining like I'm scared of the dark nigga
Every day I play my part nigga
All I do is smoke piff and get brain, I'm a smart nigga
I got too many fans now
Even people with no arms say that I'm the best, hands down
Man up, stand up or stand down
Expect the unexpected Mook they fans now
