[Chorus: Cassidy]
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up  [ 2X ]
Now we can lay em' down
Or we can cut em' up
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up [ 2X ]
{Shsss}
{Hush}
We gon'  shut em' up
{Shsss}
{Hush}
We gon'  shut em' up
Now we can lay em' down
Or we can cut em' up
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up

[Verse 1:  A.R.-ab]
God forbid
My name come out of your mouth
I have 10 goons
Run inside of your house
I like when a rap nigga
Try to think he hard
A neck shot
Make him breath
Out a drinking straw
If a nigga say my name
You know it’s on
I got a gun
The size of hulk Hogan arm
And if a nigga snitch
Kills his ass right there
I don’t care
If its daytime
In times square
When the cops come
I don’t stop sparking the pound
Boom
Then you hear officer down
And I can shut his ass up
When the eagle spraying
Or climb through his kids window
Like Peter Pan

[Verse 2: Luck-E]
Talk slick
I bet the Moss berg
I’ll shut your lips
Just the size of the hawk
I’ll make you cut your wrist
Suicide
You can lie
In a fucking ditch
Or a hundred niggas firing off
A hundred clip
Either or you don’t want that
I’m not a dentist
But I put a few caps
Where your gums at
Pussy nigga you can run that
Erday lucky in the hood
With the dealers and the guns at
You lil niggas
Need acting rehearsal
Internet thugs
Your rapping is virtual
I cut your tongue out, lil nigga
Then clap till I murk you
You dude softer than the bear
On the Downy commercial

[Chorus: Cassidy]
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up  [ 2X ]
Now we can lay em' down
Or we can cut em' up
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up [ 2X ]
{Shsss}
{Hush}
We gon'  shut em' up
{Shsss}
{Hush}
We gon'  shut em' up
Now we can lay em' down
Or we can cut em' up
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up....yeah

[Verse 3: Drag-On]
Hush homie
I’m a timberland tree
Y'all hush puppies
Nigga my twin desert eagles
Like fuck buddies
I finger pop
That pussy
And pop
You pussy
40 cal
40 blocks
Down you gushy {eeew}
Make a nigga kiss the concrete
Before he kiss his wife
I grip the Glock up
Pussy niggas
Piss they boxers
I hit the block up
The cops wanna watch us
Cuz H.E I’ll
Get a nigga chopped up
Then choppers,Yeah
I’m probably
The only rapper that’s a goon
We hogtied
Leave niggas wrapped in they room
Niggas running
They mouth
We gon'
Clap em' with the tool

[Verse 4: Jugga]
Keep Jugga out the topic
When your dentures bumping
Niggas got my name in they mouth
Like is dick or something
I caught a charge
With a snitch confessing
Just his names in your mouth
Try Smith & Wesson
A gun in your mouth
Will shut your cowards up
I put metal in your grill
Like your jaw wired shut
P.O is hating
Cuz Jugga lead a good life
Snitches putting niggas on death row
Like Suge Knight
Snitch on me
I get you shot
Or get you stabbed
Put this eagle on your head
Now you Donovan Mcnabb
I don’t want nobody knows
They missing
I’m with niggas that beat murders
Like O.J Simpson

[Chorus: Cassidy]
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up  [ 2X ]
Now we can lay em' down
Or we can cut em' up
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up [ 2X ]
{Shsss}
{Hush}
We gon'  shut em' up
{Shsss}
{Hush}
We gon'  shut em' up
Now we can lay em' down
Or we can cut em' up
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up

[Verse 5: Cassidy]
Man a nigga running his mouth
Get a gun in his mouth
Man a nigga running his lips
Get err one in the clip
I ain't tryina go to jail
But keep the gun on my hip
Cuz I’m dumb young
And I’m rich
You dumb son of a bitch
I got the deal
Still running the strip
Still slanging the butter
The same colour
As the cum in my dick
Man I just copped
Another whip
And another home
But if I ever need a loan
I’m just running to swizz
I’m with larceny family
I’m running with pits
I can either run in your crib
Or run in your bitch
Which one will you pick
Matter fact
Imma do em both
Run in your spot
Pop your wife
Then give you the toast

[Chorus: Cassidy]
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up  [ 2X ]
Now we can lay em' down
Or we can cut em' up
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up [ 2X ]
{Shsss}
{Hush}
We gon'  shut em' up
{Shsss}
{Hush}
We gon'  shut em' up
Now we can lay em' down
Or we can cut em' up
If niggas running they mouth now
We gon'  shut em' up
