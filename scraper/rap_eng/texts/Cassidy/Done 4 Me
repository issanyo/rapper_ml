[Hook: Cassidy]
It's a blessin that I'm even alive
It's a reason that I'm breathin, I believe there's a God
Hey... look what he done for me
Look-look-look, look-look-look, look what he done for me
Hey, some people choose not to believe
But I pray e'ry day when I drop to my knees
I say - look what you done for me
Look-look-look, look-look-look, look what you done for me

[Cassidy]
Hey, I wake up e'ry day and say thank you
When I'm floatin off course then the Lord is my anchor
I know you feelin me ain'tcha?
When I kill time with my son that's keeping it gangster
I'm done beefing cause I'm eating
I feel bein a father to my son that's keepin it real (ill)
And I'm the one providin at home
So I can't leave my seed to survive on his own, NOOO~!
No, it's not optional man
That's why I maneuver through the obstacles man
And, I watch for the snakes that's in the grass
So I can stay alive and be a daddy to Cas

[Cassidy]
Hey! I pray another rapper don't get shot
Cause the media's gon' blame it on hip-hop
Look at Big L, Soulja Slim and Big Pop'
Jam Master Jay, the boy Proof and the kid 'Pac
You and me gon' have to see to it the (shit) stop
If not, they gon' bring rap to a pitstop
Plus the hip-hop cops ain't a myth ock
They'll love to sit you in the box if you slip ock
You a big shot, you will get more time
Look at C-Murder, Cool C and the boy Shyne
Beans and Kim got a day and a year
It's rules to the game and they ain't playin it fair, yeah

[Hook]

[Cassidy]
Hey! God is good, God is great
It's a reason that I'm breathin and it gotta be faith
And I'm thankful that I'm eatin, there's a lot on my plate
If the Lord wasn't watchin I'd be ridin upstate
Hey, so I wake up e'ry day and say thank you
When I'm floatin off course, then the Lord is my anchor
I know you feelin me ain'tcha?
See Christ died on the cross, that's keeping it gangster
