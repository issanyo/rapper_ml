[Verse 1: Cassidy]
I get beats with Swizz Beatz, he the best producer
And I'm the executioner, I'll execute yah
I won't get you an injection or electrocute yah
Military style, I'll get upset and shoot yah
I got an army full of soldiers, I'm the best recruiter
You went to jail and did yah best impression of Luther
But if I ever get arrested, my connect'll shoot yah
Cause as far as pushing bass, I'm the best producer
Since the past made me mad, I'm a upset the future
I'm my own AR and executive producer
I make beats now, it's hard to respect producer
The way I murder beats, I usually upset producers
The boy Neo the next best producer
But y'all pitiful, cause y'all ain't individual
Ay line I rhyme at least four or five syllables
But you still rhyming one word, you got some nerve
I'm so cool with it, you old school with it
If it was '86, you probably coulda made a hit
They used to rap like that back when I was a baby bitch
I'm grown now, I can come up with my own sound
I'm in the zone now, I'm on that Patr√≥n now
The (??), the haze in me
I'm a menace, I got old dog ways in me
But I'm not a fool, you don't let your 2Pac
I'll get you like they did them dudes at the food spot
You watch (??), I'll get you what them dudes got
Whip yah ass like Kane baby, Mom, cousin
Then kill you like King Cousin with a smooth shot

[Verse 2: AR-AB]
I'm repping O-B to the H
Came up cutting O-Z's on the plate
So I never went to b-ball try outs
I was in the crib letting 9 holes dry out
You meat eaters, I keep heaters
I'm trying to see how many bodies I can fit, in my deep freezer
I keep squeezing 'till the clip don't work no more
And pop twice, to stop like like birth control
Nigga speak my name, I can hear them things
I paid my dues, and told them to keep the change
When you eating, your best friends turn to haters
So I walk with a pump like the Terminator
The left hand hold the Mac when I'm aiming
I let both guns shoot simultaneous
So niggas better be prepared for extortion
Or be twins with the headless horsemen
I'm in the Benz getting head till I'm nauseous
Niggas get booking 'till they start talking
And all I need is life of sin
It's some good coke that'll bring the pipers in
I started off 13, knocking packs off
Selling hard, you gotta cut with a hacksaw
Y'all was in school, cutting in the back hall
I was letting macs off, shooting heads off

[Verse 3: Luck-E]
If I cock it and pop it I tear limbs off
Shotgun pellets the size of a damn pinball
Ain't nothing stopping the shot when the thing ring off
One shot in a closed box, I send men off
I dug yah grave E, so why you lay and sleep
I put the steel to your face then spray the cheek
I'm from where niggas get a body every day a week
Where they'll kill you for a hobby when they craving beef
I know your past, cause you nothing harder
And in your hood, you niggas get chopped on like cutting boards
My heart cold, so I don't love a bride
I wife my chips, and yeah that's by bitch, cause I love to ball
I come to far to just fail on 'em
Fuck making it rain, we 'bout to make it thunder and hail on 'em
These niggas to hoarded down, we just sail on 'em
Larsiny ain't giving them bars, we spit jails on 'em
You little niggas get hunted down, we bloodhounds
We sniff you out, then gun you down
Twist you out 'till you tumble down
And leave your face in a puddle down
A hundred rounds when I grip the mag
I got a tank and a missile bag
So when it's beef you turn victims fast
Them goons'll kill you for a nickel bag
So go ahead with yah pigeon ass
Before this shotty pump lift yah ass
