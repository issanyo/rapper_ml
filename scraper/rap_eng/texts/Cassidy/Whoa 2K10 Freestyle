[Verse 1: Cassidy]
First of all you're not hard
You're a bitch
You're too emotional
You're my son?
I should Maury Povich you
How old are you?
I'm a bad dad, i ain't mean to cold shoulder you
But damn man a magnum ain't do what they say Trojans do
I'm hot, I'm not as cold as you
I'm exposing you
I know you're not really a killer
It's all promotional
Larsiny taking it over, its not negotiable
But don't be mad at me cause I'm dope and not as broke as you
Im a thinker, im a drinker and im a smoker too
I tell a chick a joke or two, that make her screw most the crew
Cass get more ass than most sofas do
I get face like proactive repair lotion do
My fans feenin' like smokers do
They need me to come back out and put some more crack out
I was sick of taking a rat route
But im feeling better got my business together im about to black out
You might of pull the gatt out but who cares
You scared like a rat trapped in a cat house
You scared like a cat trapped in a dog house
My dogs in your house wearing masks with AR's out
Fuck what you all about
My homies started trial a day
I'm really in the street
You niggas sweet like Alize
Eh, shorty i made 40 thousand a day
My bedroom and my kitchen a quarter mile away
And they say its a new style today
That tight clothes style is gay
Fuck what a stylist say
I made more money than more with it
I get it my account balance got more digits
But im the wrong one to come rob
You a square like sponge-bob
I carry shells like the boss squid-ward get it?
So when you see me nigga try something
And get smacked like Mary J. Blige husband

[Verse 2: Chubby Jag]
Look, i told cass i need extra cash
I can't wait i need it extra fast
Got me watching who around me
Quick to let the heckler blast
Cause niggas fucking they own fam like precious' dad
Whoa, should have told them from the door man
You dead if I'm coming for that bread , like bruhman
Show up at your door, arms up 4-4 blam [?]
Stand and clap rims, i don't back down for no man
You looking at the drough-man, a snowman , i move ki's
Im so fly, its no lie I'm the truth please
Think you gon' stick me, rob me, recoup ki's
'til we make it rain in your house, like the roof sneeze
Yeah you going to be Reggie Bush, and im Drew Breeze
Niggas keep talking that bullshit, like two three
You know me nigga, i expose beats nigga
Im all about green like grove street nigga
No i don't need a jet, or Bugatti
But a tech and a new shotty and a net
So i can catch me a new body
Moms told me to fetch me a new hobbies
I went to cockblock, then i went to drop top the new [?]
Every mic i touch got shit stains on it
Yellow things in them chains like piss stains on it
Nigga we don't add up
You boring , you trippin'
Im soaring you slipping
Im Jordan you Pipen
Do the math you sick, im into getting cheese
Im Kobe you Vick, I'm in a different league, read me?
In other words i ain't gon' stand to let you jab and hook me
You guys sweet, im Tyreke i ain't your average rookie
Two seater, skinny nigga jag
Shall be banging broads, that the skinny niggas had
Dress baggy but, i ain't in my skinny nigga bag
Try me nigga, ill smack any niggas ass
No homo, JAG
