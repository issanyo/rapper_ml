[Verse 1]
This bad chick, her name Stephanie
Said her destiny is to fuck with me
She pressing me to have sex with me
But Stephanie could have STD
She start to kissing and caressing me
Yes, she was sexually molesting me
But having sex unprotectedly is like putting your life in jeopardy
So I'm strapping up, open the wrapper up,
And put the Magnum on before I smash the junk
She was kind of mad that I had it on
But no, I ain't going raw on that nasty junk
I don't care if she said “I'm not infected”
Cause I don't wanna have her say that “you got me pregnant”

[Hook]
A lot of bad ones want you to go off
But you don’t know, you out of luck
And I don’t act tough, she told me go off
But I say no, you never know
She could share the club tomorrow, I don’t care
Stroke ‘em condom style
Condom style
Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke
Stroke ‘em condom style
Condom style
Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke
Stroke ‘em condom style
Hey, sexy lady
Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke
Stroke ‘em condom style
Hey, sexy lady
Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke

[Verse 2]
I see this bad Spanish chick
So I had to approach her
She had a pretty face, a skinny waist
But her ass was fat as Oprah’s
So I'mma get that bulk up
Then I'mma stroke a cho-cho
But if she want me to go on without a trojan, esta loca
No, I don’t care, I never stroke unprotected
No, I don’t care, it’s real, you got to respect it
No, I don’t care if she say I’m not infected
Cause I don’t wanna have her say that “you got me pregnant”

[Hook]

[Bridge]
The day before, but I ain’t popping raw
Baby, baby, not, no more
I ain’t popping raw
I did before, but I ain’t popping raw
Baby, baby, not, no more
I ain’t popping raw

Now I say hey, stroking condom style

Hey, sexy lady
Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke
Stroke ‘em condom style
Hey, sexy lady
Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke
