(feat. Shiz Lansky from Larsiny)

[Chorus:]
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some cheese and get out these crazy streets
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some gwop and get off this crazy block
To get away I got to pray that I'll
Make some cake and get out this crazy place
To get away I got to pray that it'll
Be all good if I get oout this crazy hood and I pray

[Verse 1:]
I pray everyday for a better life but it's never a night I ain't trying to get my cheddar right make it better christ I'm on both of my knees I"m trying to stop coppin' cope by the keys I'm sorry father but I got to keep a toaster to squeeze I be stressin' 'cause the blessings I'm supposed to recieve I ain't gettin' yo I'm supposed to succeed but I didn't yo I didn't know 'cause I was naive but now I'm gettin' dough my son gettin' plead I hit the stage and spit a flow I rip the show and make enough monet to but a brick of snowI get to travel to places you never get to go so I got to move from the block I'm a lot richer yo I'm a lot sicker yo I make hits quicker yo when I blaze the haze and mix it with the liquor yo niggas know to get cake I need these streets so I'm a stay but I pray that I could leave these streets everyday

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
For a life full of transgressions is heaven harder than inner are the roads to the pearly gates all for repenters is the harder the winter the harder the sinner lord I blow so much kush the answers hard to remember I knowI ought to go to church and pay my tides but I'd rather pay the hand I'm delt and wake my eyes and I drop to my knees and I pray my god that when you save my soul you save my squad 'cause they some viscious killas that'll spare no life they don't pray to our lie and they don't fear no christ so don't where no ice 'cause they'll run up and clap you dummy which proves my thoery the route to evil's the lack of money so that's the reason why I stack my monet I'm tryin to move from these streets and consentrate on this rapper money

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]

[Chorus]
