[Verse 2: Cassidy]
The King Cassidy
Y'all how I get when I'm in the booth baby

I could write the best verse you ever heard in your life
And then rip it up
Your greatest hits like mixtape ish to us
Stay with a spliff and a cup
Stay twistin up, liquored up
Off the hawk, I henny and hip it up
And my wrist, man I lit it up
My bezel got so many pebbles, Bam Bam couldn't lift it up
But try stick me up, blam man stiffen up
And ain't no stitchin up them holes, your soul liftin up
But I'm still pitchin on the stove, whippin up
Thinkin about them Franklins, stankin the kitchen up
Yup I be dealin and fillin them coke bags
And been ill with the pencil and the notepad
I been hot from the start
And I ain't just a battle rapper, Hotel on the top of the charts
I deal in weight, got real estate, and go shoppin for art
And dog, I cock it and spark
For real

[Verse 3: Big Tigga]
Be clear, me and this kid do sales
We both got hot joints with my man R. Kells
It's going down right now you seen us
Flossin at the sanctuary out in Phoenix
What up Swizz? Can I ride one of the whips?
I know you got the car lot and this is the shit
Big Tig and Cassidy back in the spot
Reppin BX to Philly straight keepin it hot
Rap City four-o'clock every afternoon
Grab the mic with five fingers of doom
Yes indeed, album for Tigga is comin soon
Yall better start runnin, call your whole platoon
Yes indeed, aye Cassidy
He be with me riding right now on the booth, BET
Cmon Cass bust that ass one time
And come through with that next hype rhyme!

[Verse 4: Cassidy]
Look Tigga I was never garbage
That's why I'm Swizz first artist
My verse is retarded (okay!)
Look I had em in a frenzy baby
Since the lovers with the Frenchies baby
But now I got chedda so it's all about the Benjies baby
I'm in the Presidential getting Lewinksi'd Baby
Ladies, my room got a spinning bed in it
And my watch look like it got lemonheads in it
It's exquisite, bright like ambulance lights
You couldn't get this if you spent your advance twice
Dude glance at the ice and be hot cuz the ish blingin
But try plot and I'll pop, have your shit ringing
Or get pistol whipped, have your shit stinging
I don't fight, you get hit with the knife while your fist swinging
All of the chicks singing come to my hotel
Cause I make they cum when they come to my hotel
I get neck then Tigga is next
I guess 'cause I'm so live, chicks love me to death
I got powder, power, money, respect
You in debt, I get twenty a check
That's why I'm just laughing
I blow dough, forget stashin
'Cause long as I know what I know, Imma get cash in
I got pills for sale and they not Aspirin
That's why I put a stash in the dash of the drop Aston
