Ooh hey

You look so good mad
And then I look mad good
You're in a good band
And I'm a good look
You got a quick hand
But a tougher tongue
You'll be a lot of bitches
But I'm the only one
You wanna small talk
Try and catch my eye
As I've got a hard court
Lotta boys who've tried
Run a tight crew girl
Spend 'em nights loose
Run a rat hang em selves with a slack noose
But I won't name who
In other news:
I wanna run your world big
Kiss you where the light caught
Get caught up in a world with
Tryna do the girl thing and fall in love tonight
Whaddya say me and you for life?

A: every breath I take I inhale this night
Every kiss you gave just makes me feel all right
B: I wanna let you in, wanna take you home
Wanna make you mine
So please don't go and let this night just pass us
By...

(oh when it comes won't you cut my chain
Oh pretty boy won't you change my fate)

He got a red cup, but I don't drink none
He got a dead wish, and I have lived some
He got a hollow heart, I try and hide inside
He got a lot a friends, who I seem to like

We take a long walk, he open car doors
He got me all shook, and I am not sure
I let him hold my hand, but he wants more
I wanna whisper things but I'm tryna stay calm
Got my eyes locked the night is so fun
Wanna grab his neck show him what he's missed
Lean in gentle get lost in his kiss
Breathe in our existence, never let it go so

(oh when it comes won't you cut my chain
Oh pretty boy won't you change my fate)

Oh I could breathe you in, (I'll breathe you in)
Let this night pass us by would be a sin
He loves me, he loves me not
Boys on my dot gonna jump you
I can't figure out but I know you and i will be
Together tonight...

A, a, b, a, b, x2
Oh by... let this night just pass us by-ya-ya-yeah
Ohhhh oh woah oh oh
Just let this night just pass us by
