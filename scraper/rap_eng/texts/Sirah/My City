Welcome to my city city city
Yeah it looks so pretty pretty pretty
Until you get robbed quickly
Oops, oops, oops, oops oops
My crew is all with me

Felt empty in this place a few times too many
Wind blowing through the harbored dusk
Pickin up dropped penny’s
My thoughts collected
I'm all for reckless when your life’s at stake
I'd stake claim with a vengeance
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I can bench press your bitch
Carried the burden of these songs, didn't let it kill me yet
My fate came to doorsteps made of plywood
Ya'll try to swear I'm hipster to the core
Come visit my hood
Not tryna be hard cause I'm that in fact
Tryna love you while you hate
Soften blows with tact
Survived attacks, getting kidnapped
Till the blacks of my blues seemed to hit hard as crack

Welcome to my city city city
Yeah it looks so pretty pretty pretty
Until you get robbed quickly
Oops, oops, oops, oops oops
Welcome to my city city city
Yeah it looks so pretty pretty pretty
Until you get robbed quickly
Oops, oops, oops, oops oops
My crew is all with me

Take a picture love, it'll last longer
My inhibitions go harder than your dude tryna smash on you
Ghetto birds perched on my windowsill singin sad songs
About cash, guns & armored cars, I sing along
Yeah, I've wronged a few times, life got hard
Slept on a few tiles always bounce back like my beats bangin in your cars
My dudes bang your broads
You think a little girl like me wouldn't really know huh?
Get on your wiki search if you're tryna throw them blows
What glimmers ain't always gold
I'm a diamond in the rough
Coal under a lot of pressure, came out well enough
But you little sluts wanna run your gums
That’s how I leave em'
Like your teeth then play nice with me I mean it

Welcome to my city city city
Yeah it looks so pretty pretty pretty
Until you get robbed quickly
Oops, oops, oops, oops oops
Welcome to my city city city

Oops, oops, oops, oops oops
