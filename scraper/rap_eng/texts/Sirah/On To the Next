Alright, need the time for you
But you never took a second
Always on to the next
But I'm good, I'm good
Time itself crying over stealth milk
Try to take back what it was that we will
The days so long but boy I'm torn
Funny what you fell in love with his return
Off you barking at the wrong bitch
Never let'em tone down
5 in the morning try to lay my tracks
Winding in the background
This whole town
Alright, made the time for you
But you never took a second
Always on to the next bitch
But I'm good, I'm good
Ow I I I
Made the time for you
Now I'm through
Ow I made the time for you
Yeah we fought, yeah I'm wrong
Two outlines and I blow take a Nash tour
And the toes who cried
Cope anecdote I don't regret
Mine's got...but I do
What was hurt on my nerves
Don't taste the floor
No more call
These nights but I hate some more
Ow I I I, made the time for you
But you never took a second
Always on to the next bitch
But I'm good, I'm good
Woooo now I'm through
Woooo now I'm through
Ow I I I, made the time for you
But you never took a second
Always on to the next bitch
But I'm good, I'm good
Ow I I I
Made the time for you
Now I'm through
Ow I made the time for you
Woooo now I'm through
Woooo now I'm through
Woooo now I'm through
Woooo now I'm through
