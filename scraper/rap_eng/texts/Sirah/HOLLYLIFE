[Intro :  Bastion Yotta]
I don't call it hollyday, I call it hollylife
Because hollydays means just a few single days in a years
Hollylife means every single day is hollyday

[Verse 1 : Sirah]
Where my heavy hitters?
Are you wid it, where ya'll at?
Calling out the daddies who be buying me my bags
Shoutout to my shawties who straight bodyin' the mat
We know that getting it when you [?]

[Verse 2 : Elliphant]
I blind you with my shine, with my fresh, you must see
You're seeing what I want you to see cause I pay
Hey Guapa, I'mma pay a papa
Hey Yata put that sweet nose toppa in my big bag of coca
C'mon dance it for us (dance it for us)
Money, pimp these bitches and the line never stops

[Pre-hook : Bastion Yotta & Elliphant]
Everyday is hollyday, I call it hollylife
(Everyday is hollyday, I call it hollylife)
Everyday is hollyday, I call it hollylife
Everyday is hollyday, I call it hollylife

[Hook : Bastion Yotta & Elliphant]
Hollylife, hollylife
I call it hollylife
Hollylife, hollylife

[Verse 3 : Elliphant]
They call me winner, go Vegas with me
I smell of caviar and got a pool full of cream
King bling got bitches, I pimp them so fast
Cause Sirah got the money and the money got that ass

[Verse 4 : Sirah]
I'm on a private jet on my way to an island
Getting hand fed by a private [?] private bitch in designers
[?] shots bring the range rove quick
Running baywatch while I get baywatch
Hittin detox, need a spa day, grab the pay out
Hit the strip club, make it rain, I'm on holiday
Queen of a Sirah
Only rap diamonds
I'mma be timeless
You know you like it
(Yoda!)

[Pre-hook : Bastion Yotta & Elliphant]
Everyday is hollyday, I call it hollylife
