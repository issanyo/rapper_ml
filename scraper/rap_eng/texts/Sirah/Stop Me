[Hook: Sirah]
Can't nobody stop me

[Bridge: Sirah]
Queen from Queens doing big girl things
In a big girl jeep as I switch them blings
I don't know who you came to see
But now it's all eyes on me, on me

[Verse: Sirah]
Bitches try to go fold, I just try to get scoped
Everybody went home, I went in that [?]
Where the fuck's my throne? I don't know who dope
All I know is me, all I see is gold
It's about to be a new reign, I'm about to be it
Girl, it's a new day, so pack up all your shit
I'mma have my way, you gon' have to get
Fuck out of my way 'cause I'm a queen pin
