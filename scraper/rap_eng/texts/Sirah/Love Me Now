I grew up super duper poor, poverty
Had a junkie daddy, sad story, got me a lot of Socrates wisdom
No shot at being popular see
They don’t like you if you’re fat, rap & don’t let your snatch hang, obviously, duh
I got my title stole by little biddy bitches with a lot of hype but no soul
Lotta big dick interests, get you signed, but know your role
Its called pimpin, chicken headed syphilis
Catch it then you gotta get some medicine

Lets talk, what’s the latest gossip?
Did you see her with him and what she was wearing?
Oh my gosh, its sacrilegious
Maybe it’s exactly that, I need an exacto knife
To cut up this new cocaine batch
I’m tryna snort it all, save the world, leave no pebble unturned
I think I love what I think I love
Am I high? Or is this earth?
What’s the word, oh that’s right, self-esteem
I never understood what that was supposed to really mean
I can't breath I can’t see, is this happening to me?

They don’t really seem to like me, naw
Is it cause of the hype and all
Don’t judge me, don’t judge me
Cause you’ve never been in my shoes (2x)
