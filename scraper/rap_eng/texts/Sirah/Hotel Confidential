Tattoo of a black snake slithers up your left leg
Dancing a burlesque on the front desk
Looking so bad, girl
Oh, I could go for a bad girl

Waltzed up to me with a little red room key
Slipped it in my pocket
I wanna rock with you, bad girl
Won't kiss and tell on you, bad girl

Nobody needs to know what we do alone
In Hotel Confidential
In Hotel Confidential

Silk sheets and champagne flowing
Privacy, please, 'til morning, baby
Nobody needs to know what we do alone
In Hotel Confidential

Three in the morning
Plus two for room service
One for the money, but tonight I'm only hungry for a bad girl
I got you now
I'll make you howl like an animal

They don't need to know what we do alone
In Hotel Confidential
In Hotel Confidential

Silk sheets and champagne flowing
Privacy, please, 'til morning, baby
Nobody needs to know what we do alone
In Hotel Confidential

(Sirah)
Know you got a type, boy
Let me be your right
I slip you my room key
I give you some advice
You should take me up
Tie me up
Blindfold it
Sleep with one eye shut
Second on my motions
Let me hold your focus
Show you where to go next
Whisper in your ear
Tell you what you want to know, yes
Keep it on the hush
I'll be the girl of your dreams for the night
Making you blush
Take a seat and I'll ride this
Ain't loving
Just fun
Tell me your room, what you want, when it's done

(Sirah) [spoken]
Shh
Nobody needs to know
Max?
Max?
