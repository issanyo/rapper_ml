The night runs fast from us
We’ve got our whole lives
Oh running never fixed us
But god knows we tried
A dusty motel bible
And a pocket full of nights
We are too young
We are too young to die

We ran our silhouettes etched upon these painted walls
Catchin scribes upon your busses never feeling that we'd fall
We broke upon the wrongs as we broke our mothers backs
Stepping upon what we sold, whoops slangin those cracks
We’ve got the time; time has gotten us holdin hands up in the dark
Stealin kisses at our lunches, double dutching like its written in our stars
Hearts painted edges of our notebooks as we'd drift
We do it for them nights like this

The night runs fast from us
We’ve got our whole lives
Oh running never fixed us
But god knows we tried
A dusty motel bible
And a pocket full of nights
We are too young
We are too young to die

Hennessy is menacing, Natty Ice is Oh so cold
A boy for every drink I took
A line for all they stole
A break upon the curves as we barreled out of sight
Sliding fast around the edges
Maybe my mom was right
Boys like this only want one thing
And girls like miss only want to bring
A plump stuffed heart and something to ride
So jump in the hatchback
Paint pictures while we drive
I do it to feel alive oh these nights

The night runs fast from us
We’ve got our whole lives
Oh running never fixed us
But god knows we tried
A dusty motel bible
And a pocket full of nights
We are too young
We are too young to die

Oh whoa yea we are too young
We are too young to die

The night runs fast from us
We’ve got our whole lives
Oh running never fixed us
But god knows we tried
A dusty motel bible
And a pocket full of nights
We are too young
We are too young to die
