[Verse 1: R I L E Y]
I used to be the one who'd steal your heart and never bring it on back to you
Used to be the one who'd pick you up after work, had it bad for you
You say I changed since I been out here on my own
You're feeling played when I don't pick up my phone

[PreChorus: R I L E Y]
Take a little more from me
Take another shot at me
Love was never enough for you
Love was never enough for you

Take another part of me
I know it's what you want from me
Love was never enough for you

[Chorus: R I L E Y & Sirah]
I, I swear you only do this for revenge
Oh baby, always tryna get under my skin

Yeah you, you swear I only do this for revenge
Oh baby, always tryna get under your skin

[Verse 2: Sirah]
I been looking through your pictures on the gram and I'm losing my mind I know
You don't love me like you say you love me and now it's time I go
You said "I never fucked that bitch" I'm haunted by your ghost
You said "I never crossed the line" now I'm drawing mine in coke

[PreChorus: R I L E Y & Sirah]
Take a little more from me
Take another shot at me
Love was never enough for you
Love was never enough for you

Take another part of me
I know it's what you want from me
Love was never enough for you

[Chorus: R I L E Y & Sirah]
I, I swear you only do this for revenge
Oh baby, always tryna get under my skin

Yeah you, you swear I only do this for revenge
Oh baby, always tryna get under your skin

[Bridge: R I L E Y & Sirah]
Yeah, she's better than you ever was
She loves me more than you ever could, than you ever could
I, I swear you only do this for revenge
Oh baby, always tryna get under my skin
Yeah you, you swear I only do this for revenge
Oh baby, always tryna get under you skin

[Chorus: R I L E Y & Sirah]
I, I swear you only do this for revenge
Oh baby, always tryna get under my skin

Yeah you, you swear I only do this for revenge
Oh baby, always tryna get under you skin
