If I wanted to see him, I would have parted with the cash
But singing a knock off can bring him back. The real rapper
Has left me rather mad so my bad but go to college
Originality get started [?] jargon and carbon copies
From the innovators
My real live imitators from the front to back
And where my bitches is at? Where my gimmicks is at?
Stylistically vast, you ain't doing shit to me. Fast
Moving when you rap exits looking good to be dashed
Usually, I'm on some love tamper quick [?] for the art
But an image and a gimmick got me dissing you hard
Flavorless to plug. I'm not biting styles or my tongue
You're not worth the time
There's more from where you come from, love
So climb the bottom rungs of the food chain
Chain letters on MySpace ain't about to do a damn thing

You probably think this song is about you and it is
Every single one of you kids
You probably think this song is about you and it is
Every single one of you kids
You probably think this song is about you and it is

I'm facing the same sound every night
Broken records skipping
Look, there's Sage and living legends
Oh no wait I'm tripping
That's a kid named Dan with the same name
Who stole styles from them things
Ringed through the holes of these empty bars
I got so much to say but you're [?] making it hard
Just give up you'll never get further than the free beer cup
And this here son is honest truth and if no one's ever told you
I'm the first to. I'm telling you to pursue you
So who's who and who's me and who's you?
Cause the same dude sounds like him and he sounds like you
And your crew sounds like boo-boo
Shoo buku the boot I'm giving you a little slack with the ropes
In the hopes that you'll noose you
Blues clues to piece together whose style this is
You probably think this song is about you and it is

You probably think this song is about you and it is
Every single one of you kids
You probably think this song is about you and it is
Every single one of you kids
You probably think this song is about you and it is
Every single one of you kids
You probably think this song is about you and it is
Every single one of you kids
