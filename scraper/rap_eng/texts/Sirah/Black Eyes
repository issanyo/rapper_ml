Your body floated to the top like they’d promised
A mouth full of marbles, look that’s so honest
When the patrons parted
Saints all gossiped
Heart fluttered like a butterfly breakin from cocoons
Bodies all in tune with the song that my head croons
Swoon a saloon sing-along
A bic, and naw I ain’t the trigger cupid got all liquored up
Pretty smut attached to lips & fun
I’m a bigger con than I admitted to prior
Night fuller than you figured, a goner, a liar

Pretty little girl
Don’t you waste your time
I know your living in a world
With your black eyes dripping down on the sides
We can brace ourselves
& We can learn to fly
But you talk talk talk talk out of your side
Such a waste of life
The night called, wanted its inhibitions back
40 and a shadow of ourselves on the wall our parts intact
You left receipts, no forwarding address
A piece of both our hearts sewn together with this mess
I miss you like I miss me when my life had more meaning
An empty shell, a carton, no name for what I’m feeling
Left the door ajar just in case you change your mind
Made a promise and then broke it, what’s the difference in our lives
Kissed an envelope puckered with goodbyes
You’ve already left & died

Pretty little girl
Don’t you waste your time
I know your living in a world
With your black eyes dripping down on the sides
We can brace ourselves
& We can learn to fly
But you talk talk talk talk out of your side
Such a waste of life
