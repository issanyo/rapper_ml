[Chorus]
I grew up lost in the land of the sinners
Paradise cold like the snow in the winter
Told my folks ring [?] time you can get it
My ex keep calling 'cause he know that I'm winning
Grew up lost in the land of the sinners
Paradise cold like the snow in the winter
Told my folks ring anytime you can get it
These labels keep calling 'cause they know that I'm winning

[Verse 1]
I don't need 'em, I don't want 'em independent
Whole life in the battle for dependence
When I'm [?], yeah my presence is a present
I been travellin' the globe makin' connections
Why you tryna act like I haven't got a Grammy plaque
Hanging from my wall, let 'em drink out of my trophy
Please don't act like you know me, bitch it's Sirah sound the sirens
I've been chillin' in the islands, making money rocking diamonds, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was young, yeah I ain't got no guidance
But you know I got this down to a science
Everybody [?], now silent
All they blowin' up my phone trying to buy me
You know I'm lowkey chilling in the Hills
You won't find me because I'm lowkey forreal
Fast money, fast cars and cheap thrills
Broken hearts, hard drugs this shit kills

[Chorus]
I grew up lost in the land of the sinners
Paradise cold like the snow in the winter
Told my folks ring, [?] time you can get it
My ex keep calling 'cause she know that I'm winning
Grew up lost in the land of the sinners
Paradise cold like the snow in the winter
Told my folks ring anytime you can get it
These labels keep calling 'cause they know that I'm winning

[Verse 2]
We was never supposed to be out here [?]
Where I'm from they don't do [?]
I was living with some hoes in the city, now I tell my momma go and cop the [?]
Yeah I made from the bottom to the top
Hollywood but you know I'm still Sirah from the block, yeah
We could talk money, I don't do small talk, yeah
I pray for my haters when they come on my block, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was young, yeah I ain't got no guidance
But you know I got this down to a science
Everybody [?], now silent
All they blowin' up my phone trying to buy me
You know I'm lowkey chilling in the Hills
You won't find me because I'm lowkey forreal
Fast money, fast cars and cheap thrills
Broken hearts, hard drugs this shit kills

[Chorus]
I grew up lost in the land of the sinners
Paradise cold like the snow in the winter
Told my folks ring, [?] time you can get it
My ex keep calling 'cause he know that I'm winning
Grew up lost in the land of the sinners
Paradise cold like the snow in the winter
Told my folks ring anytime you can get it
These labels keep calling 'cause they know that I'm winning

[Outro]
Hard drugs, shit kills
Hard drugs, shit kills
Hard drugs, they feel
