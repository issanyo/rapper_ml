I'll let you take a second
Cause I blew your mind
I know you're confused
But it’s about fucking time

They could never hold me down
I keep run run running away
And they've tried to slow me down
But I lose them on these breaks
These bitches fake
This here is fate
Don’t ask just let me tell
I've been doing it so long these songs write themselves
And when the pawn arrives at king
I yell cause I'm a beast
I'm checkin all your mates
Took so long but its for keeps

I'll let you take a second
Cause I blew your mind
I know you're confused
But it’s about fucking time

They've tried to hold me down
I keep run run running away
& They’ve tried to slow me down
But I lose them on these breaks
These dudes are cake
Their part is played
Going fast cause I feel timed
Minute’s tick can't hit rewind
When the dawn arrives at break I scream to let me through
I was put here for a reason let me do what I came to

I'll let you take a second
Cause I blew your mind
I know you're confused
But it’s about fucking time 2 x

You barter wit it
What you came here with & how hard you present it
These bad cards I sell em
Like kids want my up bringing
Hard knock sexy what you think a vendetta is
Must a lot to prove & even more to push
Dope slanger, words can't touch mine
Internet kiddy banger, push slander
I'm a bitch; get on my bad side, tush smacker
Don’t give a fuck about smacking the fuck out of an 8 year old
I’m crazy, oh you didn’t know

I'll let you take a second
Cause I blew your mind
I know you're confused
But its about fucking time 2x
