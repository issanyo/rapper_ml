[Verse 1- Eamon]
Even tho if I gotta lay low
Decisions that I pay for
Coming back to you

Hate me love me it's the same sound
Say them just to throw down
And it lights the fuse

[Pre Chorus]
'Cause I been on some dumb shit
All these good girls I can't fuck wit
You're the poison I been drugged wit
On & on & on

[Chorus]
So even when I try to cut you off
Running thru my veins but I still need more
Looking for that high that I got before
I'm slipping, I'm kicking, I think I need a detox

[Post Chorus]
Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh

[Verse 2 â€“ Eamon]
Got me wrapped up in a blind fold
No telling where the time go
Cause it's lost wit you

Going downward in a spiral
Darkness when the light go
And I'm so confused

[Pre Chorus]
'Cause I been on some dumb shit
All these good girls I can't fuck wit
You're the poison I been drugged wit
On & on & on

[Chorus]
So even when I try to cut you off
Running thru my veins but I still need more
Looking for that high that I got before
I'm slipping, I'm kicking, I think I need a detox

[Bridge - Sirah]
Your friends say I'm bad news so what
They ain't never understood, understood our love
And the struggle of the run, it's the chase that we crave
Can't live with or without you either way
It's insane I can't stay away but boy I swear I've tried
You got your hand up on the grip just pull the trigger kill our vibe
Can't stand to take a hit but no longer get that high
I love you so much it just feels like suicide

[Pre Chorus]
'Cause I been on some dumb shit
All these good girls I can't fuck wit
You're the poison I been drugged wit
On & on & on

[Chorus]
So even when I try to cut you off
Running thru my veins but I still need more
Looking for that high that I got before
I'm slipping, I'm kicking, I think I need a detox

[Post Chorus]
Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Ahh
