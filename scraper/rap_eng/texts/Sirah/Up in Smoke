I’m up in smoke
My mind’s on fire

I’m up in smoke
Watch me by like the sky
It’s a danger but beautiful sight

Tonight we’ll learn to play with fire
Don’t you know you my life
You create the rush
Fire fire fire

[Chorus]
My mind’s on fire
Implore your hands to the light
I’m up in smoke
Watch me by like the sky
It’s a danger but beautiful sight
To me it’s just us
Light me up
Tonight we’ll learn to play with fire
Create the rush
I’ve [?]
Tonight we’ll learn to play with fire
Don’t you know you my life
You create the [?]
Fire fire fire

[Chorus]
My mind’s on fire
Implore your hands to the light
I’m up in smoke
Watch me by like the sky
It’s a danger but beautiful sight
