I’d rather not talk about it
But be about it
My momma did not raise me better so I do what I need
To get my needs all countered
You say I’m the best, I know you’re not lying
World could pass by my window
Feel like I’m the time flying by-bye
To all my Internet haters
Talk about my daddy one more time
Gonna get your face caved in
My faith is what made this
So I let em run their mouths in circles
Till I square up and take aim bitch

We could lie here never ever break, yeah
You my baby, nothing left to say, yeah
Let em talk cause hate is what made me
We’ve got nothing to lose so let’s move (2x)

Money over bitches
These bitches are over money
Lookin for some substance
Turning rocks
Tryna get rent & food for stomachs
You’ve never had to be hard why would you see far
I’m tryna provide for my whole life
Your tryna hate on these stars
I’m over your head
Over your accusations
You don’t know shit about me except some kids think I’m famous
Its all talk and story till that shit is real for me
Baby on my side ain't really seeing Sai
It’s his story until we make history

We could lie here never ever break, yeah
You my baby, nothing left to say, yeah
Let em talk cause hate is what made me
We’ve got nothing to lose so let’s move (2x)
