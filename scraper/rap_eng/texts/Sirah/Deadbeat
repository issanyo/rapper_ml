Row of baddies with Daddy issues
Jack and Xany, shit'll kill you
All my crew
All we know is misuse
RIP
You know I miss you

I love them dope boys
Sick on that lean
Fuck'em all
To the indie iron
Love the gold teeth
Saying "all me"
Didn't know the old me
Boy, I was a beast

I'mma leave ya
I'mma leave ya like a deadbeat (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'mma leave ya
I'mma leave ya like a deadbeat
I'mma leave ya like a deadbeat dad

None of my crew got a father figure (nah)
But all of my crew make a father figure (yeah)
The bigger the figure
The more that they listen (listen)
They listen and figures
They seeing a vision (yeah)

Young Oprah on the track
Grew up in the trailer, singing peppermints just like
All the money Daddy sent them to them trap
Now, I'm talking on this track
Tell you where I'm really at
With Demi up in Kenya, building
Now I'll never call you back

I'mma leave ya
I'mma leave ya like a deadbeat (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'mma leave ya
I'mma leave ya like a deadbeat (yeah, yeah)
I'mma leave ya like a deadbeat dad
Dad
Dad
Dad
I'mma leave you like a deadbeat
Dad
Dad
Dad
I'mma leave you like a deadbeat

Back at it with my bad habits, yeah
Back at it with my bad, yeah
Back at it with my bad habits
I'mma leave you like a deadbeat dad
