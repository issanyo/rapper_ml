I remember how you caught my breath , needing to be saved fell into your depths , i saw you in the distance
An aquarius a drifter eyes like silver ..????
You were the one they warned about so i had to do it i knew that you'd take off the way that you play god cuz that is your M.O.. i tried to warn you you just might of let go let go
I saw you go up oh but i never ever saw you come down (but i never ever saw you come down)
I saw you go up oh but i never ever saw you come down (but i never ever saw you come down)
Don't let the sun burn you icarus, I am the deserves it wish id said there before you went down in flames don't let the sun burn you please just stay
Blackened in my eyes the war paint slides melted off the angles of our faces as we cried too
Caught up in vanity the way it wasn't fair to me
Dark times dark place how could you prepare me
But you didn't think you had to and i didn't think the bathroom would be the place we'd find u , drowning your own self heavens always up high way on the top shelf wish you would have said goodbye
I saw you go up oh but i never ever saw you come down (but i never ever saw you come down)
I saw you go up oh but i never ever saw you come down (but i never ever saw you come down)
Don't let the sun burn you icarus, I am the one who deserves it. Wish id said that before you went down in flames dont let the sun burn you please just stay
I saw you go up up up up up
But you never came down down down down down
I saw you go up but you never came down dont you know the made of all thats left is your darkness
Don't let the sun burn you icarus( Icarus!), I am the one who deserves it (deserves it!). Wish id said that before you went down in flames dont let the sun burn you please just stay
Dont let the sun burn you icarus (icarus!), I am the one who deserves it .Wish I'd said that before you went down in flames dont let the sun burn you please just stay...
