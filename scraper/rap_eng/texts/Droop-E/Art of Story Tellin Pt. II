[Verse 1:]
We was club hoppin last night the homie got in a fight
He was drunk i hate wakin up to fuck
All kinda a text messages and voicemails on my jack
The nigga real into sayin they goin push my shit back
When they see me it’s on onsite no talk
This dog got a bite that will back up his bark
It’s started all over a broad no chedda
She was a site for sore eyes cool little put together
I kept tellin the homies that she was bad news
Knew a few dudes that been in her fallopian tubes
But he didn’t listen thought i was trippin
Know he bout to be dead or either in the prison
Most of the times it’s over some kitten man i ain't kiddin
If you slippin and trippin then good riddance
They think got ammunition but we got more
Assault weapons tear the head off a dinosaur
Bitch

[Chorus:]
I hate wakin up to funk, funk, funk, funk, funk [x3]
But i can’t let them think that i’m a punk
I hate wakin up to funk, funk, funk, funk, funk [x6]
I’m still story tellin [x2]
The art of story tellin [x2]
I’m still story  tellin [x2]
Bitch this is story tellin [x2]
Bitch

[Verse 2:]
Rally up or should i say molly up
Had a little bit of lemon, a little bit of sprite in my styrofoam cup
To fuck em, get on em, fallet em, debone em
Scout them bitches for even thinkin about going to war with a boss
One a them punks forgot to turn they location off
So we found out where they sleepin rest they noggin
Parked right down the street in the bucket
Waited till they tweeted, post a picture man
Erry other minute they on instagram
Showcasing they showin they faces, braggin
Perpetrating  outta bounds laggin
Gotta be careful what you say they’ll research where you stay
Ain't no resets in the bay them nigga ain't for play
The element of surprise will bust a dusk or dime
Slaughter a motherfucker in his front lines

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Ugh ah
Meanwhile back at the crimescene
The hellacopters and homicide and forensics team
Takin reports and talkin to the neighbours
Porch to porch but the neighbours don’t wanna be on paper
So they keep they mouths zip, what they say
We was in the house watchin netfilx we didn’t see shit
Was it random or a hit that’s what the detectives say to victim family cryin throwin a fit
The new game if i tell his mama who did that ain't snitching
Yea it is my nigga get out in the street and handle business
Can’t be no powder puff just because he light skinned don’t think he ain't tuff
He’s gonna bust, imagine it, 9 times out off 10 his aim is accurate
They think they got ammunition but we got more
What you got assault weapons tear the head off a dinosaurs

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Hello

Hey what’s up frost
Yeah man, get on up man
