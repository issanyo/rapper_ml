"You're a barbarian, a savage"

[Verse 1]
I'm a barbarian, a savage, fully and semi automatic
A mannish hustler with the package, rock like Lenny Kravitz
On a mission about my mail, peddlin' chickens, Burney's and 12's
Rob a nigga if I have to, if all else fails
But that ain't really my get-down plus I know the laws of nature
It might not come back on me now but this will come back on me later
I'm from it, built for battle, the Bay made me a beast
Same Levis for weeks - 501's, no crease
I pack a cannon, .44 like Clint Eastwood you see
A cannon? Yeah but not the Canon camera 7D
I'm whiskey off this Landy
I don't know when I'll be sober again
I'm just now falling down from the sky
Finally coming down off my high
If it wasn't for the water the rap game would be dry
So I feed the soil life, resuscitate the game
Breathe life back into every real nigga that we lost, mane

[Hook: Cousin Fik]
Uh, he an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks

[Verse 2]
Do the development while I might better tetch it don't wanna get caught loose
Some of these niggas act ill when they get on pills and courage juice
A lot of these dudes ain't real, lot of these cats are synthetic
Swervo, counterfeit, yeah nigga I said it
I just scribble on top of suckers up on my solid-dude list
I don't need no liabilities, I can't be taking no risks
Gotta say I found, go hard like them Marion Barbarians
When there's beef can't be no vegan or vegetarian
In the streets of Calif-harm-ia donâ€™t let the palm trees mislead ya
Come out here with that tough guy attitude and we'll bleed you
Every time I look around I hear the streets blocked up
It's just like where you say send ya back in a pine box
I take my shirt off in this bitch, stretch marks and all
Turn into something, put my back against the wall
Get to jacking and punching until I break a nigga jaw
Keep swinging and swinging until my enemy fall
Biatch!

[Hook: Cousin Fik]
He an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks

[Verse 3]
Mommy and daddy never home so we raised ourselves
No dental plan, medical insurance and health
So I'm out here with the zombies, dope fiends and tweaks
Bodies in the streets covered with sheets
Unlicensed drunk drivers, sex offenders in prides
Supposed to be saved folks, sinners and backsliders
It ain't for play, one thing about Los Angeles, San Diego and The Bay
We quick to throw it all away in one day
Over some he-say, she-say
Lock me up and throw the key away, give me L-I-F-E
Give a fuck, "I'ma die out here" became my mentality
Be a barbarian till I'm old and grey for eternity
Ghetto celebrity, hey, specializing in selling D
But right now it's a drought, so I'm selling tree
Zips, zaps, zubbles, peas for three
Thou-wow a pound, nigga holla at me
Biatch!

[Hook: Cousin Fik]
He an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks
