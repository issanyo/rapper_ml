Stompdown JB is actually C the P
Live and in technicolor
There’s many dimensions of the fast track
And there’s many dimensions of the game
It’s the teal tap, short change, con game
Dope game, pimp game, street game
The Wichita switch long range, short change
Con game plum
All this here where the street game came from
