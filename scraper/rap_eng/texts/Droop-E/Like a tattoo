[Intro: Sade]
The light shot diamonds from his eyes
Hungry for life
And thirsty for the distant river

Sick Wid It 4 Life
Sick Wid It 4 Life
Sick Wid It 4 Life
Sick Wid It 4 Life
Sick Wid It 4 Life
Sick Wid It 4 Life
Sick Wid It 4 Life
Sick Wid It 4 Life

[Verse 1: Droop-E]
Im 22 ain't trust nuthin' since peek-a-boo
So treachery ain't shocking me like pikachu
Swear that they the truth I think they unbelievable
Its Sick Wid It Hogs up mayne we them dudes
I try to keep it simple but its really complex
Got my partna' out the hood got him rockn' crew-necks
Progress and Peace is what I preech
Put them goons on your head like vidal sassoon
Cuz' they just wanna' shine like the moon so bright
I just wanna chill get scrill and live life
They say I making history check my past dues
Its Sick Wid It so I wear it like a tattoo

[Hook: Sade]
I wear it like a tattoo
I wear it like a tattoo
I wear it like a tattoo
I wear it like a tattoo

[Verse 2: Droop-E]
Look at my right arm
Look at the other one
Lieutenant of the die hard
Imma' hold it down for my lil' brother
I thank God every day that I wake
If I die then my soul he take
Can see it in my eyes I really hate to say
That every girl I ever been with was a snake (Period!)
Last of a dying breed loyal like a pit bull
Shit I got the same partna' since pre-school
Never change, stay the same like a statue
Die Hard mayne I wear it like a tattoo
