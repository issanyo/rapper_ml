Fuck niggas get away from me
Fuck niggas get away, get away from me
Bitch niggas stay away from me
Bitch niggas stay away, stay away from me
Fuck niggas get away from me
Fuck niggas get away, get away from me
Broke niggas keep away from me
Broke niggas keep away, keep away from me
Back back back back
Back back back back, nigga give me 40 feet
Back back back back
Back back back back, nigga give me 40 feet

[Verse 1: E-40]
Hustlers up, busters down
Real niggas make the world go round
Macahi in the shop in the town
Gettin' sprayed root beer brown
My bezzle chain ain't for play
Cost a tenth of a million, 100k
Cartier white buffalo sticks, winnin'
Lookin' like a D-Boy from Michigan
We eatin' over here, no scraps
Shout out to my niggas in the flaps
It's gudda in the ghetto, in the traps
Bentley's, Audis, Ferraris, Rolls Royces and Cadillacs

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Fuck niggas get away from me
Fuck niggas get away, get away from me
Bitch niggas stay away from me
Bitch niggas stay away, stay away from me
Fuck niggas get away from me
Fuck niggas get away, get away from me
Broke niggas keep away from me
Broke niggas keep away, keep away from me
Back back back back
Back back back back, nigga give me 40 feet
Back back back back
Back back back back, nigga give me 40 feet

[Verse 2: E-40]
Another day, another dollar
Your bitch want me in her throat like a lozenge
Neck game sick, she a slobberer
Got her coochie hella hot with my thermomater
I been spittin' game since I was 2
I back a 22 like Shaq shoot
At the box, everything new
Drink Piruet Jiet, new
These Balenciagas, not Adidas
These ain't Ray Bans, these Ditas
Fuck Satan, shout out to Jesus
I ain't scared of niggas, I'm scared of police

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Fuck niggas get away from me
Fuck niggas get away, get away from me
Bitch niggas stay away from me
Bitch niggas stay away, stay away from me
Fuck niggas get away from me
Fuck niggas get away, get away from me
Broke niggas keep away from me
Broke niggas keep away, keep away from me
Back back back back
Back back back back, nigga give me 40 feet
Back back back back
Back back back back, nigga give me 40 feet

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
I could tell a real from a lame in a minute
I could turn a spark to a flame in a minute
Listen to a boss, big game for a minute
Back back back back
I could tell the truth from a lie in a minute
I could spot a mark in the sky in a minute
I done kept my pistol in my side for a minute
Back back

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Fuck niggas get away from me
Fuck niggas get away, get away from me
Bitch niggas stay away from me
Bitch niggas stay away, stay away from me
Fuck niggas get away from me
Fuck niggas get away, get away from me
Broke niggas keep away from me
Broke niggas keep away, keep away from me
Back back back back
Back back back back, nigga give me 40 feet
Back back back back
Back back back back, nigga give me 40 feet
