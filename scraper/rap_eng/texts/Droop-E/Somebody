[Verse 1: E-40]
I knew when I came in the game it wasn't gonna be a cakewalk
I wanted the money and fame I told the Lord I'm gon' stop
Selling that candy cane 'fore I get caught by a cop
Shackles and cuffs add chains, might get set up by a narc
Got a couple of kids to raise so it's a Catch-23
Should I get a job or go back to pushin' the D?
Should I call my plug and ask him to front me a key?
Should I get my recommendation papers for trees
I got bounce-back abilities, get-back skills and ideals
Buy a food truck and start selling Meals on Wheels
Drive a tow truck so that it can help pay the bills
Create an app, get in the tech world and makes some scrill
Make a blap-rider hit record and get a deal
Get out the trap, buy me a house on top of a hill
Sharp as a tack, intelligent hoodlum, that's how I feel
Platinum plaques all on the wall for real, for real

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
Yeah, I'm just somebody
Tryin' to really be somebody, yeah
With everything that I do
Stop pocket watching
Hater, baller blocking, yeah
And let me do what I do
(I'm talking about getting to the money)
(E-40 ad-lib: Real walkie talkie)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Deal with it, deal with it
I told 'em that one day that I'ma get it
I'm stubborn, ambitious and money driven
I drank Mangoscoto, that's what I'm sippin'
Take a swig out the bottle, I'm still ignorant
I smoke gelato like a immigrant
[?], incinerate
Suckas can't stop us, we motivate
I got hustle in my bones, in my body and my genetics
Wake up in the morning, do burpees and calisthenics
Hater try to hurt me, gon' need some paramedics
Might not make it through surgery, IVs and anesthetics
Fresh off the lot, not out the Autotrader
My 2017 cost a half an acre
License, insurance and registration on the dash
Case the po-po try to blast (If they blast)

[Bridge: Ricco Barrino]
Look, I'm just a man who wants it all
So if you ain't talking paper around me
Go, get the hell up
I don't need no one
That don't got any paper

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
Yeah, I'm just somebody
Tryin' to really be somebody, yeah
With everything that I do
Stop pocket watching
Hater, baller blocking, yeah
And let me do what I do
(I'm talking about getting to the money)

Yeah, I'm just somebody
Tryin' to really be somebody, yeah
With everything that I do
Stop pocket watching
Hater, baller blocking, yeah
And let me do what I do
(I'm talking about getting to the money)
