[Verse 1: E-40]
Everyday is a weekend and every weekend is a day
In the mornin' before I go to bed, I get on my knees and pray
Thankin' Him for my life, faith and my strength
'Fore I die, give me time to repent
I'm tryna get out this life, I want the best for my family
The way I used to hustle, won a couple hood Grammies
I stayed up out of the way and made a way from nowhere
I used to whip that weight as white as Colgate
40 why you ain't sippin' that Rossi no more, you in they shadows?
Shit, I looked up to them dudes, shout out to Gallo
Used to ride by slurrercane, now I'm the owner
Black man, hill side, California

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh & E-40]
The grit don't quit, it don't quit
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker
The grit don't quit, it don't quit man
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker

[Verse 2: E-40]
Takin' pictures without the paint, doin' what haters ain't
Drinkin' all of my drink, clockin' in this bank
I'm serious 'bout money like the shark tank
Your money is funny like a grenade
I slept on the rug, wish I had a couch
But now I get love from the north, east and south
I got people who used to say they never care for my music
But now they fuck with me, what I talk 'bout, they been through it
I rap like everybody else and I'm low key, I don't flaunt
If I wanted to, I could buy a Bentley every month
Niggas be overdoin' it with their gudda
Every time I turn on the computer
Steady yourself, be careful who you rockin' with
Might be funky mane, might be hair in it
Always look over your shoulder and your clavicle
My 1911 timber tactile

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh & E-40]
The grit don't quit, it don't quit
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker
The grit don't quit, it don't quit man
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker

[Verse 3: Nef The Pharaoh]
Comin' up out the sewer, where it's shitty like manure
Now I'm best friends with the dealers and the jewelers
Chains on my neck feelin' like the Rick Ruler
I'm in it for respect, don't let this rap shit do ya
Ain't no funny about my money, I let the iron mean madula
Big ass gun look like a 12 inch ruler
It's the fero for DiNero, had my lil nigga do ya
I'm a scallop for that dollar, let a real nigga school ya
He got it all outchea and left you stranded
I ain't lookin' like a orphan kid who need a daddy
Baby I can get you up and make you hella happy
All you gotta do is throw that cheddar at me
I said he got it all outchea and left you stranded
I ain't lookin' like a orphan kid who need a daddy
Baby I can get you up and make you hella happy
All you gotta do is throw that cheddar at me

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh & E-40]
The grit don't quit, it don't quit
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker
The grit don't quit, it don't quit man
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker
