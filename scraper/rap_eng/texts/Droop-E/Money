Money in my jeans goin' stupid on hoes
Money, ballin' like this, you don't gotta pack clubs, ballin'
Money in my jeans goin' stupid on hoes
Money, ballin' like this, you don't gotta pack clubs, ballin'
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

[Verse 1: E-40]
Talkers, they say I won't last, but I surpass
Every nigga that hated, look at me momma I made it
I started with a pinch of that yowda when I was jugglin'
Then my yapers started tripling, quadrupling then sextupling
North California where the hustlers reside
Where we learn to keep our silence like carbon monoxide
Some of my homies go to school to be a cook or a chef
Some of my fellas in the slums sell marijuana and meth
Never met Condoleezza, but I got rice for sale
On the Hillside of Vallejo helping my momma pay her bills
Taking my chances on going to jail, avoiding them prison walls and them cells
E'ery now and then I like to spoil myself
Got rich thrice, then I did it again
Shoutout to Obama for letting my folks up out the pen
Everyday my birthday I don't know about you
Sometimes I act my age sometimes the size of my shoe
Bitch

Money in my jeans goin' stupid on hoes
Money, ballin' like this, you don't gotta pack clubs, ballin'
Money in my jeans goin' stupid on her
Money, ballin' like this, you don't gotta pack clubs, ballin'
Money in my jeans goin' stupid on her
Money, ballin' like this, you don't gotta pack clubs, ballin'
Money in my jeans goin' stupid on her
Money, ballin' like this, you don't gotta pack clubs, ballin'
My nigga, I got money, I need money, I got money, I need money
I got money, we need money, I got money, I need money

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
(bandit?) cause your Chicken McNuggets been getting guala
Ain't no telling what nigga do for a dolla
On my momma and them kids I was down on my dick
Took 20 to the lot dropped down on the bid
Security at the gate hold it down where I live
He probably hit for 10,000 in tips
Remember to be encircled when I'm hounding a bitch
Better run (?) when I'm housing a bitch
Forreal, quarter million no deal my nigga
Scrambling in the field for chicken I gotta get it
Rubber band wrapped around wads full of digits
I'm just tryna move my mom out the trenches
750 for this liquid that I'm kissing
Deposit for the show was pocketed, can't miss it
Me and 40 been chasing the same mission
Mozzarella fetching the fella be go to (?) forreal

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
American gangsta got nothing on him
Check my resume stronger than a triple shot of gin, shit
I play to win (?)
Got 12 zips of that and a pack of Virgina Slims
Don't care my nigga me no scared
Get the whole spraying two gun (?) I got your head
Code red, be my practical tactic
Like when she was on the flight getting back to the capital right
(?) say she working under pressure
Stripping after hours to cover the next semester
Buy my only concern about sex when I text her
Brighten up a lecture 22s hop out fresher than Clyde Drexler
Hustling professor, automatic chamber, night vision and suppressor
Couple bands extra
40 water told me it's at least 100 tucked in the back of the (?)
