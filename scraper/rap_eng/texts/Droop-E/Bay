[Hook: Nelly]
I was out in the - Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay
Met some niggas from the - Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay
Met some girls from the - Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay
Lot of folks in the - Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay
And they all go - dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get - dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all go - dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum
They all get - dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum
Ohh!

[Nelly - impersonating Spice 1]
Uh, uh, uh
Aiyyo I represent that Derrty E-N-T all the way
But I'mma rip this shit up like I'm straight from the Bay
But no it ain't the Spiggity 1 from back in the day
It's the diggity-diggity Derrty one, they call him Nelly
Leanin' on his Cutlass with his cellular phone
You could tell that the St. Lou' was his home
More mail than the rest of them rappers
Cause they did more stompin than the cappers
And that's why Ice clique was it
First name St., last name 'Tics
Half-brothers and they name Murph' and Ky'
Slo had a mask, City and Ali
Old school rep, color cranberry
Up in the abyss with homie E-40
Orange juice, mix it with the Tang-and-a-ray
Hey, what can I say? (huh?)
I was out in the..

[Hook]

[Nelly - impersonating Too $hort]
Who you think this is?
This ain't Short, this St. Louis
+Born to Mack+, ma that's my biz
Life's +Too Short+, baby catch my drift
I was told not long ago
"Nelly, don't stop that rap
If you do it well enough
She just might bring it back"
Then I yelled out BIATCH! I go on and on
Baby girl skills on the level of porn
A freaky tail that I met out on tour
Mama was bad like Lena Horne
$hort then said I got a dirty mouth
Sometimes that might be true
But I'm the CEO of Derrty mayne
So, I ain't trippin off you
I'm just out in the..

[Hook]

[Nelly - impersonating E-40]
Rock a green fitted, with a yellow A
Yeah I'm from the Lou', but today I'm reppin Bay
Bring the yellow tape, he ain't gettin far
Mirror in my pocket so I practice lookin hard
And you don't wanna be around when them boys pullin out them thangs
All my niggas is pimps, man they all carryin canes
I met this girl up in the club, she told me call her Wassie
Red bone thick, with a bangin-ass body
Now is I, now is I, should I save her?
Think about it, no way, UGHH!
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
What's his crew name? Derrty E-N-T mayne!
I just wanna know (know) tell me when to go (go)
Price is on the Cavi', but I can get it low
Pocket full of fatty and sippin that hurricane
So just sprinkle me mayne

[Hook]

[Outro]
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
