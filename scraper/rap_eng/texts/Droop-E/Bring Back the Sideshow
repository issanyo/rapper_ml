[Hook:  Mistah F.A.B.]
We still ride sideways
This way, that away
Meet me in The East on Saturday
Still ride sideways
This way, that away
Meet me in The East on Saturday
And we gonna, bring, bring, bring
Bring back the sideshow (bring back the sideshow)
What it do nigga? (bring it back)
Bring, bring, bring
Bring back the sideshow

[Verse 1:  E-40]
Uhhhhhhhh
Figure eight, figure eight (figure eight, figure eight)
Two shoes I skate (two shoes I skate)
All gas no brakes (all gas no brakes)
Burnin' rubber in your face
Bring back the sideshow
Blowin on this hydro
Progressive, not Geico
We can race for titles
Sideshows, goin' nutty, dumbin' out (dumbin' out)
Take the wrong turn and get your roof stomped out
Skeee skert, skeee skert, skeee skert, skeee skert
Middle East turban on their face (white t-shirt)
They might get to squirtin' in the place (with the squeezer)
Whites, blacks, every color race (smoke reefer)
The Bay gone so crazy bitch
We ain't lazy, we wavy man
Keep your eye on your lady
She tryin' to pay me, she cakey
Ho don't mistake me for fakery
Got more bread than the bakery
Got them cookies, no DoubleTree
Solid gonna be the death of me

[Hook:  Mistah F.A.B.]
We still ride sideways
This way, that away
Meet me in The East on Saturday
Still ride sideways
This way, that away
Meet me in The East on Saturday
And we gonna, bring, bring, bring
Bring back the sideshow (bring back the sideshow)
What it do nigga? (bring it back)
Bring, bring, bring
Bring back the sideshow (Bring the sideshow back!)

[Verse 2:  Mistah F.A.B.]
I'm still feelin' it
Only right I'm still sideshowin'
Bang bang bang, gang, gang gang
North Side throwin'
Purple hydro'n is the shit that I'm blowin'
That's the reason, why both of my eyes glowin'
Oooh, shit, that nigga shit wack
What the little nigga said when I slid through the set
Got an LS-3 in a box Chevy
And I wish the police would try to get on me
I be like wuh-wuh-wuh-woo
Was outta there
And I got handles, I was drivin without a care
Down south, you get caught, you was not in there
Polar bear, polar bear, boy we are not a square
Damn, I'm feelin' like the man daddy
Fuck all that cookie shit, get me some Grand Daddy!
'Cause I'm still hyphy in my white tee
With your wifey and I know she like me

[Hook:  Mistah F.A.B.]
We still ride sideways
This way, that away
Meet me in The East on Saturday
Still ride sideways
This way, that away
Meet me in The East on Saturday
And we gonna, bring, bring, bring
Bring back the sideshow (bring back the sideshow)
What it do nigga? (bring it back)
Bring, bring, bring
Bring back the sideshow (bring the sideshow back!)

[Verse 3:  Nef the Pharaoh]
Straight heem, no chase, all to me face
I turn a Benz to a scrape and be on my way
There's a sideshow yankin' in The Town tonight
And I'm gonna show 'em how Vallejo get down tonight
But there's cherries and berries all in my rear view
Yerk left, yerk right, I'm tryin' to shake dude
Bustin' figure eights, the car be movin' like a snake
I'm bendin' off every corner, pullin' emergency brakes
Big timer, timer
Get rich of sliders
My nigga bought a scraper off a credit card scam
Dog get out and he burnt it, insurance just paid the man
Bring the sideshows back
Like FUBU in '05 on 'em
I'm too live for 'em
Hit the sideshow and high side on 'em
18, 19, 20 and up
If she bleedin', she get fucked

[Hook:  Mistah F.A.B.]

Bring, bring, bring
