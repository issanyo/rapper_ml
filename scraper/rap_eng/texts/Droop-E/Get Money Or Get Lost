[Verse 1]
The way they made me, I could never be cotton
Won't tell a hoe what I know, I slap a bitch with my dough
I tell her get up out my mix, sour cock-hoe bitch
If some shit go down, you'll be the first to snitch
I'm a bonafide barbarian, out the Seven-Oh-Sev
By any means necessary, get that bread
Just smoked a turkey-bag of broccoli, and I'm off of that fluid
Niggas wanna pop me, but I can't let 'em do it
He Thundercat trainer, trained Thundercats to go
A pro at gettin' doe, he a GoPro
I wrote a letter to myself when I was six-and-a-half
One day I'll be sittin' on a big pile of cash
I pop my P's and she fell for the okie-dokie
Took her to miniature golf and karaoke
He did the bitch wrong, I did her right
She gave me some dome, I laid the pipe

[Chorus]
Get it right, don't get it wrong
Me and broke don't get along
I broke up with being broke
I cut that bitch off, get money or get lost

[Hook]
Get money (get money) get money or get lost
Get money (get money) get money or get lost
Get money (get money) get money or get lost
Get money (get money) get money or get lost

[Verse 2]
Bitch, this another muthafuckin' no doubter
I'm in my off-white Charger, clam chowder
Fuckin' around on my smartphone, on my browser
Bringin' home a thousand bucks an hour
He a yesterday nigga, I'm a right-now nigga
He holdin' on to the past, I'm holdin' on to some cash
I'm makin' my moves, and I'm doin' it fast
Gotta get in and get out, if you expectin' to last
My little nigga be rappin', and he about his dough
His beats be slappin' like he dominoes
He from the streets, the tar, the gravel
But he can put them words together like Scrabble
Comin' around the corner with the blapper
Marijuana aroma smoke and laughter
She told me she diggin' me like a tractor
These earrings in my ear might have attracted her

[Chorus]
Get it right, don't get it wrong
Me and broke don't get along
I broke up with being broke
I cut that bitch off, get money or get lost

[Hook]
Get money (get money) get money or get lost
Get money (get money) get money or get lost
Get money (get money) get money or get lost
Get money (get money) get money or get lost

[Outro]
Bitch!
Get lost
Get lost
Get lost
Get lost
