[Verse 1:  E-40]
If you from the ghetto, show your ghetto smile
From the projects like Coo Coo Cal
Got a Rolex with the diamond dial
17 X spend a hundred thou'
Bought it brand new at eleven mile
My granddaddy had eleven child
I told him I'ma make him proud
He told me "Don't let me down"
I'm heavy like a Chevy, like a kilogram
Blow big weed like Amsterdam
Arizona Tea, mix it with Crown
You can find me on Instagram
Get it understood I could knock your ho
Nigga-rich nigga, bitch, I ain't poor
??? flyer than a UFO
Make her stand outside forever like a scarecrow

[Verse 2:  E-40]
I'm a real nigga you a novelty
My nigga you should do stand-up comedy
Your crew sorry like apology
All washed up like laundry
Stay away from squares no geometry
My niggas go nutty like an almond tree
It can get ugly don't be botherin' me
Bitch give me room like the Omni
I'm a tycoon, don't fuck for free
I don't pay for pussy, pussy pay for me
Promoters hire me for their pool parties
Just so I can be in the facility
All about the green like parsley
Lay your lane flat like carpentry
Favorite weaponry .223
Put a motha fucka out his misery

[Verse 3:  E-40]
I'm the weatherman, I can make it snow
In the summertime, make it twenty below
These little niggas mainy and they trained to go
Xanny Bars, Belushis and they sip that bo
Smoke a cigarette after they tag your toe
Then buy a pack of 'woods at the liquor store
Them boys in the hood tryin' to make that dough
Wish a nigga would like a two by four
Nigga you a square, I'm a triangle
Got more fur than an Eskimo
When it comes to hustlin' bitch, I'm the go
Meet me at the parking lot at Trader Joes
Re-up and re-cop on the holiday
But not Easter or Christmas day
Watch out for the cops when you push that yay
Livin' out here in this dirty bay
Biatch
