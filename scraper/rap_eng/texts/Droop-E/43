[Verse 1:]
I duck behind the pills 'n tha liquor, hide behind tha broccoli
I feel like can’t nobody stop me
From a little young mustache, hella curious and nosey
To a big ol’ ballin ass nigga, e'erybody know me
I'm up all night like a Trucka, ready to pluck a sucka
Befo’ I short stop maself, I'ma send his ass to hell
Wit' dese 78’s two shells, double deuce 3 pails
In front a e'rery fuckin body,betta not aim at nobody
Else you be sleepin wit d snails, d worms to be precise
I be fuckin wit d scales, I got the lowest price
Put a few gaysyou are vagabon on ice, if I must
When we tell it (tell it), ain’t no such thing as trust trust)
Don’t think think that I won’t bust (bust) a nigga head to da temper fat
Split his cooler pack, push his helmet back
I get d pleasure when I pop my powder, pennies on da dollar
I’ve been on ma block forever ma nigga, ain't one deal went sour
I’m in da hood like a motor
The neighbourhood mechanic houses
Where I keep my yola
Same soup just warmed over
Dumbin' out with my toaster, microwave or roast ya
I’m out here wit dese spiders, tarantulas and roaches

[Chorus:]
I break d back off a king, mix some soda wit da A1D
I ziploc an flip flop four 3
I ziploc an flip flop 43[x2]
I break d back off a king, mix some soda wit da A1D
I ziploc an flip flop four 3
I ziploc an flip flop 43[x2]

[Verse 2:]
I originate from rich niggas bank deir dope
Get rich an straight pitch, straight up off da post
I keep a banger in a pea-coat, stack c-notes
Lil niggas on da lookout dats child support
Keep ma dope at Ms Kings, right across from tha store
See her husband is a CO an already know
Got a cold when a got a young bitch, twentyfo’
Sniff sniff blow, an sipp sip bo
I’m pro an gettin doe, see d money love beelah
Got a Lisa fever errtime a nigga see her
An I don’ play either, I play wit millimeters
Modern day heaters, call em black spleazers
I beat d block down, hella rounds a ball blasts
White Range Rover supercharged an all dat
You ain't wit d shit,then nigga you fall back
Or come to da spot an see what I call crack

[Chorus:]
I break d back off a king, mix some soda wit da A1D
I ziploc an flip flop four 3
I ziploc an flip flop 43[x2]

[Verse 3:]
One a ma rebellers was askin me hella questions (darn it)
I say ‘what is you a CI,a confidential informant?’
Meet me at 711, act like you gonna buy some medicine
An I be posted up in da parkin lot wit da inventory
If the popos get on ma ankles like a shoe (like a shoe)
I ain't have no other choice but to blame you (blame you)
Blame you, bang you, let tha thang do what tha thang do
Ain't you, hit ya frame in yo brain too
I break backs off the soft packs, turn em hard
Get it in wit da Mexican walk d yard
An in d end when ma next a kin pull yo card
Have your whole wind take yo nigga free a charge

[Chorus]
