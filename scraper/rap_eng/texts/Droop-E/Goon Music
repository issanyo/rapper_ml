[Hook:  Stressmatic & *E-40*]
Up all night, things I gotta pull night
If you pull a gun man you better use it
Got one life, it's easy to lose it
*What is it?*
This is goon music
This is goon music

[Verse 1:  E-40]
Goon music at its best
From the west where they will open up your chest
Leave your brains in your lap right by your Fendi belt
With your bitch in the passenger seat, yellin' for help
Gotta stay prayed up, 'cause your life can be taken
Niggas be phone pimpin' and infiltratin'
Unfortunate situation
They'll catch you at a gas station
Or on a freeway takin' your exit
Pop one of your loved ones, send a message (uuuuh)
It's bad where I reside
These streets will swallow you up and eat your ass alive (uuuuh)
Hammers and nails
Funkin' over females
Metal detectors and pat downs ain't safe enough
Sneak in the club with a thumper twisted in his dreadlocks
(Biatch)

Up all night, things I gotta pull night
If you pull a gun man you better use it

This is goon music

[Verse 2:  E-40]
Tattoos on my skin
Bible verses, family and friends
Prepaid calls ??? and kites
Toilet tissue and water behind them walls makin' dice
Uuuuh, give a fuck
Me and my niggas be cuttin' up
Admirin' older cousins hot wirin' and stealin' stoleys
Joy ridin', high sidin', turnin' donuts in front of police
It's do or die on the soil it's ugly all year round
I swear I know some females that would knock your ass down
They don't care, they ain't listenin', ignore you can't hear a sound
??? my beef from Richmond, to Sco' to VR the Town
Over the stove in the kitchen, posted up with the 30 round
Everybody get down
Yellow, white, black and brown
Uuuh, don't believe it bitch I can show you , I can prove it
What is it?  This is goon music

[Verse 3:  E-40]
Not from Pittsburgh, but used to be a stealer
Ex-D-boy, now he a hope dealer (a hope dealer)
A youth activist, work with the children (with the children)
Certified from the soil, he a real one (he a real one)
Make sure it's right out where it's wrong
Talk to the orphans and foster kids from the group homes
A positive influence on the streets (on the streets)
Involved with the teachers and athletes (athletes)
Uuuuh, good guy goals
Sent a couple to law school, a couple to the pros (to the pros)
Uuuuh, used to powder his nose
Funk with the cream as a teen
Now he's twenty years clean (twenty years clean)
The lord is amazing
Unity over separation
Got relatives in Fairfield and ???
Who he cool with?
Cool with all the goons
