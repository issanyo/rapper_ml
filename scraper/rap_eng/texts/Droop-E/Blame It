[Chorus: The Click]
(B-Legit) Niggas gettin’ smoked for no reas’
(D-Shot) Niggas livin’ broke, no cheese
(Suga T) They ain’t got no hope, no dreams
(E-40) Man, I blame these niggas’ OG’s
The Mekanix
(E-40) Man, I blame these niggas’ OG’s
(E-40) Man, I blame it on the OG’s

[Verse 1: E-40]
I’ve poppin’ for a minute now, and it ain’t no stoppin’
Spittin’ game all over the popper stopper
Mobbin’, P’s poppin’
I love my lilttle niggas, I promise you, I ain’t hatin’
But I swear to mob, my nigga, it’s like they skipped a generation
A lot of my little ninjas is polished, no debate
They don’t do sucka shit that we don’t tolerate
Man, I blame these niggas’ OG’s, hope it haunt ‘em
They analyze you but you dropped the ball on ‘em

[Verse 2: D-Shot]
The future look bright on a sunny day
Real ass niggas paved the way
Shoutout to the youngstas, papered up
Little young playas, off the cuff
Y’all peeped out the map that us G’s wrote
Influenced by the swag that us G’s wrote
Homie, we done learned from the city streets
I’m still a young monster packin’ heat

[Chorus: The Click]
(B-Legit) Niggas gettin’ smoked for no reas’
(D-Shot) Niggas livin’ broke, no cheese
(Suga T) They ain’t got no hope, no dreams
(E-40) Man, I blame these niggas’ OG’s
(E-40) Man, I blame these niggas’ OG’s
(E-40) Man, I blame it on the OG’s

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Now I done seen a lot, even dreamed of it
Put it on for my block and the team love it
Exotic smoke bag 1300
Humble dude, never rude, never even stunted
I tell a young lad, “Boy, get your bag
And fuck livin’ lav, nigga, make it last
Fertilize the stash, homie, grow the grass
Gotta take it real slow when you’re livin’ fast”

[Verse 4: Suga T]
I skipped recess, I don’t ever play
Bring the bag, break me off, make your nigga break the bread
She be that bad chick, she schooled your daughters
Rockin’ with the mob, Magazine, where it’s ordered
Some people call me “Tee-Tee”, some people call me Shiniko
Back in the mannish days, I used to live my life illegal (Yee!)
Back in the glory days, I used to cock
Got in the rap game and then I stopped, ugh!

[Chorus: The Click]
(B-Legit) Niggas gettin’ smoked for no reas’
(D-Shot) Niggas livin’ broke, no cheese
(Suga T) They ain’t got no hope, no dreams
(E-40) Man, I blame these niggas’ OG’s
(E-40) Man, I blame these niggas’ OG’s
(E-40) Man, I blame it on the OG’s
