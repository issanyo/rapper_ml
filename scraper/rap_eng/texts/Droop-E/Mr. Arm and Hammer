[Commercial narrator]
Arm & Hammer baking soda
Countless uses for pennies a day!

[E-40]
That Arm & Hammer mane
That orange box of baking soda

[Hook: Stressmatic]
Cook so much, I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
Cook so much, I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
I'ma need a new wrist
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)
Mister Arm and Hammer
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)

Mister Arm and Hammer

[Verse 1: E-40]
Mister Arm and Hammer in the trenches in the zone
Mister Arm and Hammer outside with his pajamas on
Mister Arm and Hammer never pissin' in a cup
'Cause he fuckin' his probation officer, thick as fuck
Got the district sewed up, got the goonies on the squad
Got the hammer loaded up, case the janky try to rob
Nigga's sittin' on some paper, nigga's sittin' on some scratch
Got that dirty, bloody money, nigga don't pay tax
Mister Arm & Hammer mannish, got bitches and resources
Out here eatin' good, feastin' on four courses
Squat in rental buckets, keep the foreigns in storage
More trees than a forest, more drums than the armed forces
Pull up to the throat, thirty deep with the whole block
Them boys play for keeps, put your head on the chopping block
If you feel froggish leap, they'll bust your snot box
Pay the enforcers to put you in a pine box

[Hook: Stressmatic]
Cook so much, I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
Cook so much, I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
I'ma need a new wrist
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)
Mister Arm and Hammer
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Uuuuuhhhhhh
Quality over quantity, algebra and geometry
Loyalty, not dishonesty, livin' in this economy
Gotta be with the shiznit, they'll take your kindness for weakness
They'll gaffle you if you slinnip, they savages and they beastes
They savages and they beastes, they mannishness increases
They cannabis dish decreases, and I ain't bein' facetious
Tryin' to get by 'cause she stresses, smokin' on a loosie
'Cause her aunties and uncle and all of them on Belushi
In The Bay, they sell coochie
All the bitches got a big booty
Hella niggas ridin' with a "rugey"
FN-57 or an Uzi
A-1 not no bammer, not tryin' to go to the slammer
Don't work for construction, but pack a nail and a hammer
They'll do some destruction, don't care if they're on the camera
Dudes get to bustin' over slander and gander

[Hook: Stressmatic]
Cook so much, I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
Cook so much, I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
I'ma need a new wrist
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)
Mister Arm and Hammer
Mister Arm and Hammer (hammer)

[Verse 3: E-40]
That orange box of baking soda, hustlas use it for their yola
Anything that you request and it can help your inner jest
It all purpose, ain't no secret, you can brush your teeth with it
You can put it in the tub, you can take a bath and scrub
Mister Arm and Hammer show the soil hella love
Mister Arm and Hammer wealthy, got enough to buy the club
Natural like an afro, cooler than an air conditioner
Don't want to go to battle, if you start it, he gonna finish it
Mister Arm and Hammer 'bout his business and the foolery
Mister Arm and Hammer buyin' property and jewelry
Mister Arm and Hammer give the people opportunity
Mister Arm and Hammer givin' back to the community
Congratulator, not a hater, money up like an escalator
He don't ever do it minor, everything he do is major
Mister Arm and Hammer keep a spoon up in his fist
Cook so much that he gonna probably need a new wrist

[Hook: Stressmatic]
Cook so much, I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
Cook so much, I'ma need a new wrist (wrist)
I'ma need a new wrist
