[Verse 1: E-40]
It’s hard for me to go soft
Back me up in a corner and I’ma get off
Get you gone if you double cross
Niggas jealous ‘cause I’m saucy like spaghetti sauce
Or should I say lemon caper, diamonds giggin’ like a drum major
I go this little bitch, I be milkin’ the bitch for all her paper
Thick like cake mix, all the ballers wanna pay her, save her
Charlie Check a Chick is what they call me, not a caped crusader
I’m plugged in, I know everything, keep my ear to the gravel
I know these streets like my muthafuckin’ shadow
Under certain circumstances, it’s manda-, stay with a stapler
You never know who a hater ‘cause ain’t no congratulators
Where I’m from, gotta be a quick decision-maker
In the slum, put holes in your car like a cheese grater
As of lately, it’s crazy, it’s been a spark up in crime
The murder rate inflate in the heat of the summertime

[Chorus: Stresmatic + (E-40)]
What’s-his-name told, ol’ boy got popped (popped)
They stripped some nigga last night at the spot (spot)
Potna went down, now everybody hot
That’s what I heard at the barbershop
What’s-his-name told, ol’ boy got popped (popped)
They stripped some nigga last night at the spot (shot)
Potna went down, now everybody hot (What you heard?)
That’s what I heard at the barbershop (The barbershop)

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
I’ll get to knockin’ like a rock band
Heavy metal shit, drumsticks in niggas’ hands
They say he ran off with half a man
And they don’t want him dead, just to understand
You keep playing with this Bay shit
Where niggas see the plan, don’t say shit
Go the wrong day to get your taper fixed
Could put you in the mix over paper quick
Yeah, in the chair, you gon’ hear the drama
Side bitch and her mama jumped the baby mama
She was being messy all in the comments
Talking ‘bout, “Excuse me, he left his condoms”
Man, these bitches ain’t playing fair
That told the welfare she be doing hair
Be havin’ hella niggas in and outta there
And they be smokin’ with the kids, they ain’t even player

[Chorus: Stresmatic + (E-40)]
What’s-his-name told, ol’ boy got popped (popped)
They stripped some nigga last night at the spot (shot)
Potna went down, now everybody hot
That’s what I heard at the barbershop
What’s-his-name told, ol’ boy got popped (popped)
They stripped some nigga last night at the spot (shot)
Potna went down, now everybody hot (What you heard?)
That’s what I heard at the barbershop (Ugh!)

[Verse 3: E-40 + B-Legit]
Goons, goons
Pistols be poppin’ just like balloons, balloons
Niggas be dropped in emergency rooms, rooms
The smirkish be plottin’ on the tycoons, tycoons
They’ll kick in your door in the afternoon, the noon
Be strapped with mini-Macs
See me, mama snaps, already know where them pennies at
Real life hittas don’t come in a beanie cap
They do it bare-faced off powder and Henny yak
Niggas gon’ give him that, run him and shit
You either take the L or get shot in your lip
Suckas lay low but a boss’ll flip
Put a hundred on the Lamb’, 50 more on the wrist
The niggas is pissed; if they move, it’s fonk
Them boys got them problems niggas really don’t want
Flexin’ in the thang, park it right out front
Be the talk in barbershop for the next three months (BIATCH!)

[Chorus: Stresmatic + (E-40)]
What’s-his-name told, ol’ boy got popped (popped)
They stripped some nigga last night at the spot (shot)
Potna went down, now everybody hot
That’s what I heard at the barbershop
What’s-his-name told, ol’ boy got popped (popped)
They stripped some nigga last night at the spot (shot)
Potna went down, now everybody hot (What you heard?)
That’s what I heard at the barbershop (The barbershop)
