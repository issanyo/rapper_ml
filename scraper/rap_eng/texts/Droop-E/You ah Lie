The Mekanix

[Verse 1: E-40]
He say that he rich and got all the bitches
His niggas don’t like him and they his niggas
In jail, they’ll write him and they’ll send him a kite
Tell him in the bing, he ain’t liked
First one to sing, last to blast
Tell on his team, he ain’t gon’ last
A person, place or thing is a noun
I ain’t lyin’, my nigga, I’m not a clown
I ain’t perfect, I promise, but bitch, I’m truthful and honest
They ain’t got no respect for and they refuse to pay homage
They think my favorite rapper garbage, they ah lie
“E-40 the greatest rapper alive”
He talk that shit, no rehearsin’, not commercial, be smokin’ purple
He flippin’ them styles, actin’ bad, and he might slow up and go to turbo
Crack you with his verbal, he’ll never turn on his circle
He’ll drink with you, blow the herbal
He be courtside up in the Oracle

[Chorus: 4rAx]
There’s only one rule (break it)
There’s only one rule
See me, I do what the fuck I want
(I do what the fuck I want)
You ain’t a real one, you be fakin’
(You ain’t a real one)
I could tell he was a fraud from the jump
Nigga, you ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie) (Biatch!)
You ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie)
You ain’t a real nigga, you ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie) (Biatch!)
You ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, lie)
You ah lie

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
Niggas pump fake like they getting cake
Holds the homie cop money on the ‘Gram
He say, “It’s lit like ‘88”
Hashtag: Nigga, I’ve been getting bands
But you ain’t got no grams
No P’s, no pills, nigga, no plans, nah
Only good when you wit’ your mans
And when you from where I’m from, they’ll peep the scam
Watch who you fuckin’ with
Suckas always on some sucka shit
Type of nigga like to move his lips
Actin’ like he got it locked, moving zips
But a real nigga know better
I could tell by the shoes and the sweater
Like, you ain’t having no cheddar
The type that always take the twelfth letter (L’s)

[Chorus: 4rAx]
There’s only one rule (break it)
There’s only one rule
See me, I do what the fuck I want
(I do what the fuck I want)
You ain’t a real one, you be fakin’
(You ain’t a real one)
I could tell he was a fraud from the jump
Nigga, you ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie) (Biatch!)
You ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie)
You ain’t a real nigga, you ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie) (Biatch!)
You ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, lie)
You ah lie

[Verse 3: E-40 + B-Legit]
You sold dope for a week and then you quit
According to your raps, you was it
You got ‘em thinking you savvy and hella beasty and hard
You ain’t been block approved and tested on the boulevard
Your ghetto pass ain’t revoked ‘cause you never had one
You a fraud, you a joke, real niggas laughin’
You get your game from the net, I get my game from the vets
You the type that’ll break up with your bitch with a text
A sucka in the flesh just like all the rest
A hater at his best stay in mess
Talking too much’ll get your gums knocked in
For lip service, you shootin’ and jawsin’
Some of you niggas can’t tell a peach from an apricot
All you do is throw salt and cock block
Goaltending and baller blockin’, you could keep it
Nigga, you lie so good, you make your own self believe it…BIATCH!

[Chorus: 4rAx]
There’s only one rule (break it)
There’s only one rule
See me, I do what the fuck I want
(I do what the fuck I want)
You ain’t a real one, you be fakin’
(You ain’t a real one)
I could tell he was a fraud from the jump
Nigga, you ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie) (Biatch!)
You ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie)
You ain’t a real nigga, you ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, you ah lie) (Biatch!)
You ah lie
(You ah lie, you ah lie, lie)
You ah lie
