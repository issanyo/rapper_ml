[Hook: E-40]
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
Outta control
He outta control
He outta control

[Verse 1: E-40]
UH, the braff art of this rap shit
Body and smack shit, avenue animal solar savage
Money under the mattress money pillow case loot
You can find me in the hoody or you can find me in a suit
Decimals, commas, all about my dollars
Like to squeeze titties, like to squeeze lamas
A smith jet fuel I'll gas anybody
Can't be duplicating can't be carbon copy
Far from a sucka, never been a sap
Coming around the corner with undeniable slap
Coming around the corner with a super bad batch
Coming around the corner with a pocket full of stacks
Revenue Retrievin', currency collected
Goon a getting feddi for snetching, cheddar checking
Yoking, marijuana smoking
Desert eagle tooting, I don't think they know

[Hook: E-40]
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
Outta control
He outta control
He outta control

[Verse 2: Dem Hoodstarz]
Red nose pitbull no leash or a bite, no bark, straight beef
We outta control
Like a sunked up Chevy in a brand new race fish chill sideways in the lake
We outta control
Clear looking on mix with the kush push petal to the floor man
[?] I got that
We like Puffy and Shyne on New Years
I got it in the club with me you don't wanna fuck with me
We took bulls like Spade running in the air
Real goon niggas run Cali
I'm fresh out the pro-jects stuff still lonely ridin' dirty off the gnome don't stop at no light
It's beef on sight middle finger to the law
Ain't tryna be the screet got the chopper on the seat
Active, the young boys bout that action, smacking
Jump em niggas stretch em like elastic
We outta control

[Hook: E-40]
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
Outta control
He outta control
He outta control

[Verse 3: Mistah F.A.B.]
I'm a fixture, factor, more than a rapper
Gritter, grinder, hustle like a trapper
Paper, stacker, forever what I'm after
If it ain't about them cases paseos it don't even matter
40 The Ambassador and Fabby is the prince
I shake yo hand but hold up pimpin' please no finger prints
Bossy, flossy, groovier than groovy
A walker reality show a box office movie
Mackin, bobbin' got bad bitches poppin'
Models on my line night and them bitches they be jockin'
Watchin', clockin', steady 'bout my paper
Just like Stevie Wonder I don't never see these haters
Look for 'em, throw 'em, yep, pass 'em
Lot of niggas mad because I l-l-l-latinum
Elmer Fudder thug now, watch me ga-ga-ga-ga-gas em
Who the nigga in the Bay baby boy just ask 'em

[Hook: E-40]
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
I'm outta control
Outta control
He outta control
He outta control
