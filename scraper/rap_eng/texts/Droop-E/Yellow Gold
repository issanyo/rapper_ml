[Chorus]
Chain on top a chain,on top a chain
Yellow gold (x5)
Diamonds dancing all on ma ring
Yellow gold (x5)

[Verse 1]
In d streets like a oil stain (soil)
Yellow brick road that’s what I call ma chain
Still in d hood like a motor
Had to walk before I crawled, fuck a stroller
Built for battle like a solja, staple a sucka like a poster (du-du!)
I started off a dollar layer, dodo stains in ma underwear
Now I’m balling like a rapper (40!)
Pulling up wit d slapper (Steve Meade)
Breaking up the block (blappin)
Speakers bout to pop (clappin)
Giuseppes on ma feet, trues on ma keys
Table diamonds on ma chains, Easter
Chanel,Celine, Prada,Karl Lagerfeld,Versace, Ascata

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Keep it all the way a milli
Really I just want a billi
Chains same color as Aborigini
Hair shining like an African heir
It’s in ma roots, my geneology
Smoke in da air, getting high as the patchies
Our cherokee, I’m wit a centerfold
She need vitamin D I give her vegetables
Bring d pedal to da flow, still hustling
Livings hella slow, still buffering
Telling Quinn CBD strings, losing in da OG game
Now I got chain on top a chain, you lame on top a lame
Don’t run it cause if you fucking for young true B
Sit with it going broke, putting change on next brains behind me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Growing up I was a skinny ass broke nigga
Now I’m on ma fifth flight out nigga
Guess ma pockets wouldn't crew wit ma appetite
Touch ma change, I'ma touch yo life
Birdie niggas fading out like a outro
An they ain't got no power like some mondo
Got the Chevy wit d niggas who you hitting for
Trying gamble with a false you will go broke
Shawty give good pussy wid some good head
But she be playing with niggas, coed
Gold Jesus piece like the Pope
Loafer vinegar on verse selling dope
I ain’t perfect, he working on me
But lil mama keep tweaking on me
All dis dream make a nigga feel decided
I stick with it, there’s no treatment

[Chorus]
