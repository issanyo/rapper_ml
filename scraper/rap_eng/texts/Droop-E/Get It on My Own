[Intro: E-40]
Uh
This blap right here

[Verse 1: E-40]
Life livin' in the cage in the tridnap
Posted with the gauge in the guitar stridnap
Hard-boiled eggs and a tuna fish sandwich
Dopefiends with AIDS 'cause they can't afford their medicine
No veins in their legs, in their toes, in their nizneck
Dreadlocks and braids in apartments and projects
Alleys and creeps, speed bumps in the street
Tarps and sheets, crime scenes deceased

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
Peace don't exist, we ain't used to it
Give a nigga a eighth, I bet he gon' do it
To tell the whole truth, but he goin' through it
X-rays of his lungs show a little fluid
And he ain't got no insurance
Nigga need one, they ain't tryna do it
Suffering, he ain't tryna do it
Rather go out and pull it and catch a few bullets

[Chorus: Ocky + E-40]
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (lost one, bossed up)
Now I'm doin' what I want
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (cross me, trust me)
I'll do a nigga wrong
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (We had to get it on our own, mayne)
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (Had to get it on my own, bruh)

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Team winnin', I been pitchin' since the beginning
Tryna hit a home run every other inning
Had to make a way, had to do it fast
Runnin' out of bullets, runnin' out of cash
Look up in the stash, only had a Rollie
Sold it to the plug, made about 40
Spent it right back, made another 40
It was off to the races like "Get 'em, Tony"

[Verse 4: E-40]
Back in the day, po-po was easily outsmarted
But now they got some new and improved, state-of-the-art shit
Now they got body cameras, robots, and spike strips
Now they got cars with front and back surveilance
Grit my teeth and rub on my temple, got a lotta stress inside
Won't ask family for money 'cause it's hard to swallow my pride
Loved ones can act kinda funny, and two-faceded and cold-blooded
Kick you when you down on the ground, the haters love it

[Chorus: Ocky + E-40]
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (lost one, bossed up)
Now I'm doin' what I want
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (cross me, trust me)
I'll do a nigga wrong
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (We had to get it on our own, mayne)
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (Had to get it on my own, bruh)

[Verse 5: E-40]
I like my weed loud, hella Noisey like Viceland
Refuse to live like a coward, I'd rather die like a man
My niggas ain't playin', they got more K's than the Klan
And they'll stand on the hood of your sedan
If you my enemy, you might not wanna be
They won't show no sympathy, got drums like a symphony
Might stand over you, potna ain't got no conscience
Fuck around and get found unresponsive

[Verse 6: B-Legit]
He was flatlined, 'til they hit him on his Batline
And told him it was that time
Had exact kind, wedding cakes or the packed line
Same place at exact time
You niggas killin' the game, mayne, be swearin' you with it
Put the orders in but be scared to come get it
We gon' keep it litted, baby, sittin' and dumpin'
Only way to get it, they ain't handed me nothin'

[Chorus: Ocky]
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (lost one, bossed up)
Now I'm doin' what I want
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (cross me, trust me)
I'll do a nigga wrong
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (Hey...hey)
Ain't nobody handed me nothin'
I had to get it on my own (Yeah, yeah, hey)
