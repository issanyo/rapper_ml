[Hook: Big Scoob]
I hope that K-9 don't patrol today
Blood, I got yay, yay, yay, yay
I'm on the road to get a load today
Blood, I'm on my way, ay, ay, ay

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I'm on the road to get it
No thinkin' 'bout it, just go and get it






[Hook: Big Scoob]
I hope that K-9 don't patrol today
Blood, I got yay, yay, yay, yay
I'm on the road to get a load today
Blood, I'm on my way, ay, ay, ay

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Trapped off in the middle map with a grind bigger than a [?]
And my mind working like a quarterback








[Hook: Big Scoob]
I hope that K-9 don't patrol today
Blood, I got yay, yay, yay, yay
I'm on the road to get a load today
Blood, I'm on my way, ay, ay, ay

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Ten runs with ten loads, paper grows 'bout tenfold








[Hook: Big Scoob]
I hope that K-9 don't patrol today
Blood, I got yay, yay, yay, yay
I'm on the road to get a load today
Blood, I'm on my way, ay, ay, ay

[Outro]
Scoob! Scoob!
