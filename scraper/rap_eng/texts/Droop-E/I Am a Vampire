[Chorus]
I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire
I lost my fang

[Verse 1: Cousin Fik]
I woke up this evening, it was about six
I had a couple texts from a couple chicks
Took my first sip, then I grab my hat
I don't need a whip, I just turn into a bat
It don't matter where I'm at, I'm a get up in her brain
Rubbing my rings, sucking my fangs
She told me I was awesome, met her at the club
I took her to the coffin, then I went for blood
You are listening to danger, straight out Transylvania
Where you better have a silver bullet in the chamber of your banger
Stay away from strangers, because there's no escape on a late night when they throw you off into a cape
A vampire life can be a lonely mission
Let the eating be discreet be the only vision
And before I fly through the roof
Ladies and gentlemen, I must reveal the truth

[Chorus]
I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire

I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire
I lost my fang

[Verse 2: Droop-E]
Droop-E while you were sleeping, me and my niggas eating
Getting money all night, 'til the sunlight
While you was snoozing, your chick was out choosing
Check the scoreboard my nigga, we ain't loosing
King of the castle, call me Count Droop-E
All black Gucci, I don't fuck with Kool G(?)
Never been fruity, I got a lot of groupies
Sue me
I am a vampire, sick witted empire
Up all night, bitch I ain't tired
I'm on my fucking grind
Trying to get what's mine
You think I ain't gon' get it
Then you out you fucking mind
I wake up at 8, p.m that is
Thank the one in heaven, for making me the biz
I am a vampire, that is what I be
Ask about me

[Chorus]
I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire

I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, I am a vampire
I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire
I lost my fang

Lost my fang
Lost my fang
