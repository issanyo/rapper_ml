[Verse 1]
(I am your)
Inspirator, money motivator
The starter to your ignition, the engine and generator
Hoe ass haters never got no place, they fall short
They don’t wanna listen to me and the robbery part (I am your)
I’m concrete from ma head to ma fuckin feet
One of the solidest niggas that ever gon wanna meet (ugh)
Pick your place or pick your drug of choices
I can’t explain how I feelin right now, I keep hearin voices (I am your)
Affiliation to the real nigga, D-boys dance and ma neighbourhood
Making my descent on the flight, I’m your night light
When it come to hood shit I’m your insight
(look)
(I am your)
Star in the 4th quarter,back boy slapper with a bad bitch winning (winning)
I’m you club investor line with a blow, quit playing shorty holla at a nigga though
(I am Your)

[Chorus]
National d-boy, solo representer
Hustle all summer, and grind all winter (x2)
Never been a quitter, money motivator,real gouda getter
Hustle all summer, and grind all winter (x2)

[Verse 2]
My money is jumbo, your money is frodo
Hoes go below the belt, that’s what I call a low blow
What else, Matter a fact I got hoes like a bell (like a bell?)
Cause I got stroke like Phelps, plus I smoke like Phelps (what else)
Smokin on sativa wid a bad senorita, body like guida but her face is way prettier
Hoes can't see her, even in their peripheral (I am your)
Yeah guy with the steel wheel, tail on the star craft, foes on the back door
Double shot a yag landocious, not a lambo coupe, 3 for the energizer (I am your)
To the death I die wit this, real nigga from the grid, bread over sucker shit
Always in the fuckin mix, fixture in the hollar games, sick wid it harder chain
(I am Your)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All winter
Soundtrack to your life, man outta mice
Where a 12 year old kill you for stripes, not a price
Where niggas die over dice and the fiends smoke pipes
The dirty, the dusty, the musty beany wearing types, yea (I am your)
Play where the girls walk, powered by the slick talk mirrored like a mohawk
Flashy, push like a bullet train
I’m a wreck the boy man, fire up the best strain
The pitter patter and chitter chatter don’t matter
When the clapper get to closing, the clatter them have to scatter
I used to call an tell em rippers it’s a rap
Now come slippers, slide in
No strings attached, them niggas ESPN, never in the game (I am your)
They just talkin

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I am your
I am your
