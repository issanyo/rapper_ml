[Intro: E-40 & Lil B]
For the soil
Yeah, mane! Ay, I'm sick with it! Let's get it!

[Hook: Lil B]
Flash on these bitches
Smash on these bitches
Get the dollars out that bitch 'cause she's a real live whore
Get the dollars out that bitch 'cause she's a real live whore

[Verse 1: E-40]
I'm tripping!
I'm trippin', I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
My profit, my money, I'm flippin'
You can find me in the kitchen
Cooking and whippin' and twistin'
Spinnin' the pot with my wrist in
Pushing that weight without liftin'
Johnny on the spot, Kimmy on the case
Johnny on the spot, Kimmy on the case
Fucking with my guap, you will get erased
Fucking with my guap, you will get erased
45 Glock, shoot you in the face
45 Glock, shoot you in the face
You won't have time, to say your grace
Say your grace, say your grace
You won't have time to say your grace
Always on the rush, like I'm in a race
Pull up in the cut with the Tomahawk steaks
Pull up with the chops with the Tomahawk steak
Turn you to a ghost, I ain't talking 'bout a Wraith
Try to play me close, I'ma put her in her place
Honey thick as fuck, baby got cakes
Mack them O's, coast to coast
Decimals, close to close
Best of hoes on my testicles
Smoke vegetables, sell rice bowls
See through a sucker with a blindfold
Step on my bitches then your mind gone
At a side show on hydro
Tryna get richer like Lionel

[Hook: Lil B]
Flash on these bitches
Smash on these bitches
Get the dollars out that bitch 'cause she's a real live whore
Get the dollars out that bitch 'cause she's a real live whore

[Interlude: Lil B]
Ay, shout out to E-40, man
It's your boy, Lil B, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil B]
I know the BasedGod, bitch
Shake your ass for them dollars, stupid bitch
Bitches in line, now these niggas in line
These bitches in line, I'll kill a fucking bitch
Word around town, man, these bitches suck dick
Word around town, bitch, I don't give a shit
I'm tryna get paid, bitch, tryna get laid
Bitches left me, now she gotta catch a fade
(Figaro) Las Vegas with the roof off
Jackie Chan on my wrist with that "wa-cha!"
Push bricks out of state for the Audemar
Cave a bitch face in just for talking smart
And bitch, you don't have to call (No, you don't)
'Cause I'm gon' be a player for life (Be a player, mane)

[Hook: Lil B]
Flash on these bitches
Smash on these bitches
Get the dollars out that bitch 'cause she's a real live whore
Get the dollars out that bitch 'cause she's a real live whore

[Outro: Lil B]
