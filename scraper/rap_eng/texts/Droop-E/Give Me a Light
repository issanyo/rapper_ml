[Intro]
Just give me a light
Just give me a light
Just give me a light
Just give me a light

[Verse 1:  Droop-E]
Somethin' like a player puttin' Cherry Pie in a paper plane
Keep it lit like a stadium, premium octane
Gas straight to the brainium, my girl Lithuanian
Get it? She stay litted, get it? Forget it you know what I'm sayin'
Can't be duplicated, I'm illuminated
We do this frequently so the frequency's raisin'
I consume so much green feel like Piccolo mane
Sippin' Slur' with a ho that look like she could be in videos
Lemonaded, catch me shinin' like a lamp, faded
Always motivated toastin' to the cultivation
Bosses over here, gettin' dollars over here
Peaceful, but you don't want no problems over here
I'm everything [?] colder than Icees
Cleaner than sanitizer, you're sweeter than Hi-C
Ha, what you mean?
My money blue, my bud green

[Chorus: ProHoeZak]
Put some Kush up in the air
And blow the smoke out everywhere
Just give me a light
If we gon' make this party right
Then everybody let's get high
Just give me a light

[E-40]
Yeah, let me holla at 'em Droop-E

[Verse 2:  E-40]
It's April dub, we posted up in the club
With a bucket of that there vodka
In VIP poppin' collars
We smokin' that marijuana with somebody's baby mama
Come get her, don't want no drama, her coochie hot like a sauna
Big reefer in the air, Sativa (Sativa)
The owner don't care, me neither
Prop sixty-fo, I got a seventy-oh, what?
Cutlass Oldsmobile, stick in the floor
I'm a brand, I got my own liquor man
Some spirits, some wine and beer you can buy in a tall can
My heart it don't pump no fear, I'll fuck you up, I got hands
Don't let suckas get in my ear, love my family and all my fans
Bread Over Sucker Shit - BOSS
I got pneumonia, this turtle makin' me cough
I'll say it once again if you don't know
We call it turtle 'cause it's green and makes you move slow
Biatch!

[Chorus: ProHoeZak]
Let's put some Kush up in the air
And blow the smoke out everywhere
Just give me a light
If we gon' make this party right
Then everybody let's get high
Just give me a light

[Bridge:  ProHoeZak]
Hey my nigga
Can I hitch your funky ride to the dispensary?
I got my canibus card
'Cause I'm ready to go and cop me about an eighth of weed
I got thirty dollars
A case of Slurricane and some Swisher Sweets
I'm 'bout to pop my collar
Get the baddest bitch around me, baby that's all I need

[Chorus:  ProHoeZak]
Let's put some Kush up in the air
And blow the smoke out everywhere
Just give me a light
If we gon' make this party right
Then everybody let's get high
Just give me a light

[Verse 3:  Berner]
I need a Bic and a Thai stick
Yeah it's hit, but it's fly shit
Two hits make my mind flip
Yeah, all the way in The Yay-o
Big bank roll, here where the dank grow
Where the Cookie from?  Where the [?] from?
And that pelli shit, I wish I could taste some
Big whale in the water, I be way too high to even worry 'bout drama
Cookied down from head to toe
I start a new grow, everywhere I go
Las Vegas and the city of trees
Keep a real fly bitch just to twist you some weed
I'm out in L.A. flexin' all bitches in my section
Three growth spots, we ain't worried about sessions
Fuck Trump, don't pass him the blunt
Exotic weed smoke got the club smellin' like a skunk

[Bridge:  ProHoeZak]
