[Verse 1:]
I’m from d bay, process of elimination
Where they won’t hesitate, to put down d demonstration
Consequences an repercussions, they bussin
Put da bitch ass nigga in half like a english muffin
They gone on the brown and will do u some harm
Snortin heroin in the powder form
No respect for a cop in the uniform
Chemical babies, dropped on his head when he was born
Nigga crazy
Out here in d Ye
No recess cause dem boys don’t play
Betta get up out da way
If you calm down tryna see another day
Persuade a bitch to play which way
Give up her punani berry, I’m actin in full effect now she callin me dada
Not a sandwhich but I used to be a poboy yow
Holes in ma socks, just stains ya know

[Chorus:]
Both ways don’t cross that bridge
Cause every city in the bay wit this shit
Yea we wit this shit
Yea we wit this shit
Every city in the bay wit this shit[x2]

[Verse 2:]
Ma game infested, from d soil
Up in Houston sippin on oil
Up in KC fuckin wit d royals
Up in d kitchen waitin for d water to boil
You know a nigga still move yirl
An all ya’ll knocked your game from Earl
I’m a fresco nigga like Boobie an JB
Dem 80’s ladies is what made me mainly
I used to sit on d blocks sellin rocks to AT
Dis for d most Sony, Dell an HP
Dem lakeview niggas yea we still crazy
Be-tray hear the veegies an alimany
A legend like the Giants an 9ers
Tryna get dat bitch to sell her vagina
All I know is countin stacks
All I know is blowin racks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I got money in ma duffel, money in ma sock
Keep d 50’s in d honies an d rest for the back
Ma lil niggas love it when I take em to da spot
When they see dem handhelds and bold out shots
Rule number 1, neva be d aggressor
Cause any little weez can bring d Glock off d dresser
Some get knocked off d block or way lesser
Leave d whole family, cryin, stressin
Funk in d summatime, funk in d winter
Where killers be invite, invitin you to dinner
Duct tape, tea parties an notes for da ransom
Duggin ain’t pretty but da payoff is handsome
Find me in da projects, sippin on coolaid
Twistin up afgan keepin d crew paid
Bounty on yo head then we come fo’ d payoff
Then fuck you like Bernie, in d Chevy we made off

[Chorus]
