Droop-E on the beat

[Hook]
Me and my niggas in this thang and you know we bout to pour up
Me and my niggas in this thang and you know we bout to pour up
We bout to pour up; we bout to pour up
We bout to pour up; we bout to pour up
We bout to pour up; we bout to pour up
We bout to pour up; we bout to pour up

[Verse 1: E-40]
UH, hella marijuana and alcohol
Talking more shit than a bathroom stall
Got a thingamajig on me
That’ll split your wig, homie
Turn your brain to pastrami
Fry you like bacon, bitch, when we beef, no bologna
Every day I get a kite (What’s that?)
A will or a letter they write
Free my niggas in the pot
Counting they calendars, steady watching the clock
Three hots and a cot
Ear to the street, Doctor Spock
Dropped out of school at 1-3
Went to jail at 23
Thanks to the jailhouse library
Took up welding, got his GED

[Hook]
Me and my niggas in this thang and you know we bout to pour up
Me and my niggas in this thang and you know we bout to pour up
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
UH!

[Verse 2]
Hella jewelry around my arms, we call it furniture
She said ‘My man get on my nerves like acupuncture’
She’s sick of that sucker, she cussin’
She say he lazy as fuck, a piece of nothin’
Walking around this muthafucka gleamin’
Block boomin’, phone ringing
‘What do you need? Whatever you need, I got it, elbows’
‘Meet me at 6 o’clock in the parking lot at Trader Joe’s’
When you’re hustling, there’s certain things you gotta do
When you’re hustling, don’t let ‘em sit in back of you
Stay in contact with the smirkish and the grimey
Been having the same plug since the ‘90s
Profit flippin’, my profit is what I flip, committed to the grit
Pushing the skunk, it smell like an armpit
Walking around this muthafucka thuggin’
Mean-muggin’ off alcohol, I ain’t talking rubbing…BIATCH!

[Hook]
Me and my niggas in this thang and you know we bout to pour up
Me and my niggas in this thang and you know we bout to pour up
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
UH!

[Verse 3]
Suckers need to miss us—avoid me
Either you with us or against us—the enemy
Pour out a little liquor—Sluricane
For our loved ones that’s no long with us—pay homage, mayne
RIP Makaveli, mayne (2PAC!)
Since you’ve been gone, shit ain’t been the same (It’s fucked up!)
Your nigga 40 in this bitch (E-Feezy)
I’m still on like a light switch (Longevity)
Playing ball, heavy hitter, not a bunter (Ripping’)
Rapping circles around these youngsters (Spittin’)
Sucker shit is contagious these days like the flu
I told a sucker the other day ‘Your mama shoulda swallowed you!’
Bitch, we ain’t gotta shoot it out, we could scrap
Then after I beat your, shake my hand like after a tennis match, bitch
I’d give it to one of you niggas
Don’t make me come up outta retirement and get up in your business

[Hook]
Me and my niggas in this thang and you know we bout to pour up
Me and my niggas in this thang and you know we bout to pour up
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
We bout to pour up (We bout to pour up)
