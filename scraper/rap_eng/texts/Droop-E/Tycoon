[Intro]
T-Y-C-double-O-N
Tycoon

Tycoon
Tycoon

[Chorus]
40 Water, your player partner
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon

40 Water, your player partner
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon

[Verse 1]
I was born to win
Whenever I'm up in Vegas, I rest my head at the Wynn
Casino, right off the strip, Las Vegas Boulevard
Gotta have some chips, most people can't afford
The jacket that I got on is called Goyard
Customized by Exclusive Game, made out of scarves
The jewelry that I'm rockin' cost a grip
Hyena shit from Iceman Nick
I'm a heavyset dude with swagger out of this universe
I can persuade your bitch to give me her purse
I keep my mouthpiece cocked and loaded like weaponry
I can talk a monkey off a banana tree
Everywhere that I go, people notice me
Nigga-rich nigga, ghetto celebrity
I'm a gamed-up individual, it's embedded
Down-to-earth brother, not big-headed
Tycoon, bitch!

[Chorus]
40 Water, your player partner
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon

40 Water, your player partner
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna brag about what they get, I don't give a fuck if you're 25
If you ain't teaching the yougsters how to go legit, you ain't shit
I been having money for a minute, for a while
Soaked up game from my G's like a beach towel
I did one year in college, then back to thuggin'
I'm too polished for you dusty-ass piece of nothin's
I know I got too much to lose, but I'll take it there
I'm playing with some change, I'll make you disappear
My big homie looked me directly in my eye
Said sometimes you gotta take lives to save lives
I told him that I'm a rapper, that's all I do
My past is behind me, I'm through
My family prayin' for me, I'm a fixture
Auntie-nem texting me some scriptures
I got pistols in my house like Daniel Boone
Bitch! I'm a tycoon
Tycoon!

[Chorus]
40 Water, your player partner
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon

40 Water, your player partner
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon

[Bridge]
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon

Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Bitch!

[Chorus]
40 Water, your player partner
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon

40 Water, your player partner
Ever since the womb, I been a tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
Tycoon, Ty-Ty-Tycoon, Tycoon
