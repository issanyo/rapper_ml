[Verse 1]
It’s a game of cat-and-mouse in the Bay
Everybody know where everybody stay
Somebody didn’t make it to the house
Somebody got shot in they mouth
Gotta keep you a thumper, on the tuck, on the under
Can’t be shinin’ too flossy, they’ll turn you into a body
Can’t be stuntin’ too often, they’ll turn your car to a coffin
Have you coughin’ up blood while you was smokin’ your bud
And sippin’ your barre, or should I say lean
Him and his hoe, now it’s a crime scene
I’m a master of reality
Rap about good times and casualties…UH!

[Chorus 2X]
From the bottom, and I ain’t ever changed
From broke to having my change, mayne
Get up and get it, don’t always place blame
I’ve been blessed by the game

[Verse 2]
This morning, the Lord tapped on my head
Said ‘If it wasn’t for me, you would be dead’
Got up out my bed, got on my knees and thanked Him
I was hecka scared, it was cloudy and rainy
When it come to communication, you gotta be smart
Put your pride to the side and have a heart-to-heart
With your family and folks, your friends and your foes
Life can be short or taller than a stripper pole
I’mma get my shit together, bruh, I promise, I betcha
I’m slappin’ E-40, don’t shoot the messenger
Pack a Mac or a 40 just in case they test ya
Watch out for the Porky, pigs, they arrest ya
Some crooked, corrupted, attitude like ‘fuck it’
Some do they job and care about the public
I’m a master of reality
Rap about good times and casualties…BIATCH!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Techniques and tactics, mammoth mathematics
Runnin’ through paper like it’s a laxative
Since I toddler valued a dollar, ya hear me?
I’m the same the dude, I ain’t an impostor, ya feel me?
When you get on your feet, don’t forget your peeps
‘Cause they the ones that hold a nigga down in the streets
When it’s all said and done my testimony ain’t gon’ be phony
Sometimes I lose count on how many people owe me money
Forget about it, hustla, just love ‘em and keep it pushin’
Never know when you gon’ need a brother, we hoodlum
Boss, not a sucker, I love my loved ones, we folks
My bloods and my cousins grew up together, so dope

[Chorus]
