[Hook: Nite Jewel]
Come take it slow, in your fast ride
Stop up on the road, red lights in a long line

[Verse 1: Droop-E]
I'm in the traffic slapping classics in my new school blasting
With the sunroof open on my way to check money
Sunny day, fly nights, every day shining bright
White bitch, half black, right wrist, NASDAQ
Sick Wid It, that's that, roll it up and pass that
Life is moving faster, heart is getting blacker
Climbing up the ladder, step by step, don't slip
Rep my set, bitch, checks to get flex and whips
With the stick-shift, I ain't trying to brag, but
I can't lie I'm still hungry and greedy
And unsatisfied, trying for the platinum
With the beat bumping Droop-E on the way to smack something
And I hope I don't get pulled over, marijuana aroma
[?], thought I told you we some soldiers
"Are you on parole?" "No, sir." [?]
In it to win it, period, end of sentence

[Hook: Nite Jewel]
Come take it slow, in your fast ride
Stop up on the road, red lights in a long line
So kiss me baby, cause we got time

[Verse 2: J. Stalin]
Smoking and riding, nigga, cause Livewire still mobbin'
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Banger under my garment, make a nigga be quiet
[?] all black tints, [?]
She fuckin' with me, she might as well commit suicide
"Who am I?" Just a little nigga on the paper chase
A.D.D., but money the only thing make me concentrate
Fucking with these haters, these haters they get deflated
If they was [?], they get paid to not participated
Pupils dilated, I ain't smoking on that basic
Pretty black bitch, but she's sucking like she Asian
I think her name was Malaysia, I met her in Malaysia
She was doing tricks, so she popped it for a player
Swag on point, never threw a dollar in the air
Fuck with the real, I put you on like a pill
Just a ghetto-ass nigga shining like I got a deal

[Hook: Nite Jewel]
Come take it slow, in your fast ride
Stop up on the road, red lights in a long line
So kiss me baby, cause we got time
In the traffic
In the traffic
In the traffic
