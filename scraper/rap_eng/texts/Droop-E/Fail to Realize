[Hook:  E-40]
You niggas fail to realize (realize)
We do it king size (king size)
Watch what you say, might be the cause of your demise
Get your money up (money up)
Put some ketchup on your fries (on your fries)
You fail to realize

We do it king size (king size)
Watch what you say, might be the cause of your demise

[Verse 1:  Droop-E]
My game is potent as a pack, I stay as high as a condo
Bottle after bottle, just got back from Morocco
My motto "full throttle" and my niggas are hostile
Stomp you into a waffle for all that talkin' bravado
Got to actin' irrational, turned his dome to pistachio
Left his brain on the patio, all my savages savvy, bro
I fly like an eagle, I'ma shark you a seal
Smokin' on strong, we be sparkin' for real
You ride with them people, you shitty, you fecal
We the sickest niggas healthy, shout out to my Cousin Fik though
Tryin' to get more chips than a casino in Reno
Jealous ass suckas hella salty like miso (jealous motha fuckas)
I be incognito, gettin' Gouda and scootin'
Rollin' in the traffic, plottin' and movin'
Medium rare salmon with the lemon butter sauce
All I gotta do is cough to have your scalp moved off

[Verse 2:  Bandz Talk]
What you fail to realize is, it ain't no switchin' sides
I'm locked in Sick Wid It Records, them hog ties
450, bang four-fifths
And runned it up fresh out the box on a broke bitch
I'm so sick, I'm so sick, 'cause I been around some cold shit
All these late bloomin' ass niggas be on some ho shit
That bitch finna get turnt quick
Niggas ain't gettin' no chips
Pullin' up with that turf bitch, I'm pullin' up with that make bitch
Her little brother set trip, I'm up on this band shit
Bandz Talk bands bitch, king size king shit
Realize a real bitch gonna always do some real shit
What you fail to realize that every bitch ain't no real bitch
On that fake bitch, I'll hit that kill switch (I'll hit that kill switch)
Can you motherfuckas stunt back like a spine?
Little bitch, put some ketchup on them french fries

[Verse 3:  Nef the Pharaoh]
Hey yo Trax, let me see what you got

Ain't nothin' on my wrist but my neck on heavy
Nas off Belly with a little Makaveli

You niggas fail to realize ain't nothin' this is real life
Pull up in that Bruce Wayne, shit a movie, I'm the Dark Knight
