[Chorus: E-40]
They wanna take it there
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Scalp a ho, get on a nigga hair
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Run a nigga down with the 30 round
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Mama outside cryin’ in her gown
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare

[Verse 1: B-Legit]
I don’t think about, I don’t be without it
I could give you what you want if you really ‘bout it
Got 30 and a 40, nigga, you could count it
Get a line on your living room, then surround it
Right-hand man and he don’t like to listen
Choppa get to kickin’, cookin’ in the kitchen
Rockin’ me a fisherman like I’m fishin’
Tackle box, pole, hella ammunition
I really hate to take it there
But I promise you, nigga, we ain’t playin’ fair
We don’t care if your daddy there
I’ma nail you to a chair, we’ll do it bare

[Chorus: E-40]
They wanna take it there
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Scalp a ho, get on a nigga hair
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Run a nigga down with the 30 round
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Mama outside cryin’ in her gown
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare

[Verse 2: E-40]
Run you down with the Kater
Double up, then come back later
Shut it down like a breaker
Hide behind the back of your neighbor car with the sprayer
One thing I hate is a hater
Two things I hate is a traitor…ugh!
Bullets ain’t got no name
Slugs talk a different slang, need a translator
Niggas callin’ my phone, temperature checkin’, fishin’
“I’ma merge him in, shh, be quiet, baby, listen”
I could tell in their tone they’re up to something slickin’
They ain’t doin’ no talking, they trippin’…BIATCH!

[Chorus: E-40]
They wanna take it there
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Scalp a ho, get on a nigga hair
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Run a nigga down with the 30 round
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
Mama outside cryin’ in her gown
Fuck a mask, we’ll do it bare
