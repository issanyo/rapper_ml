[Intro]
Thigh highs on I'm getting it 
I look like I’m 21 
I don't even go to clubs 
It's ok to party at home

[Chorus]
Tonight I throw a house party
18 and I'm stunting
18 and I'm getting it
Who's coming to my house party?
18 and I'm getting it
18 and I'm getting it

[Verse 1]
Calling all girls from across the world
Who goes out there and get it like me
Who got that body and style and that wiki waw 
And soul just pretty as she

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fuckin' with you, I fucks with you, I fucks with you
I'm fuckin' with you, I fucks with you, I fucks with you

[Chorus]
Tonight I throw a house party
18 and I'm stunting
18 and I'm getting it
Who's coming to my house party?
18 and I'm getting it
18 and I'm getting it
Tonight I throw a house party
18 and I'm stunting
18 and I'm getting it
Who's coming to my house party?
18 and I'm getting it
18 and I'm getting it

[Verse 2]
Bottles with my girls from all across the world
And tonight we're gonna have a lil fun
Got the DJ burning up and that floor turning up
And this music got me like I’m on one

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fuckin' with you, I fucks with you, I fucks with you
I'm fuckin' with you, I fucks with you, I fucks with you

[Chorus]
Tonight I throw a house party
18 and I'm stunting
18 and I'm getting it
Who's coming to my house party?
18 and I'm getting it
18 and I'm getting it

[Bridge]
Come check at the front, remove all your sneakers at the door 
You be cool if you come, you just don't come in and act superficial
Make yourself at home

Thigh highs on I'm getting it 
I look like I'm 21
I look like I'm 21

[Chorus]
Tonight I throw a house party
18 and I'm stunting
18 and I'm getting it
Who's coming to my house party?
18 and I'm getting it
18 and I'm getting it

[Outro]
Big black shades, I'm back from Belgium
I'm not even 21
I don't need to go get drunk
I'm already too much fun
