[Verse One: Gilbere Forte]
I’m usually on some first name basis
But niggas fuck my name up so much, I wanna change it
A wise man told me to live what my mama gave me
A chance to see life outside of a lady
I’m 24 now, no rain in my clouds so my sky stay true
Purer than ice blue, when you closer to your dreams
People that surround you start hating on your team
They wanna wear a crown too
You try to chase a life that don’t wanna find you
It’s hard to gain credit for something that’s not you
The price people paying to make it as a fan
Keep you closer to the game but you lost in the stands
I ain’t no missionary but your girl love dictionary
It’s clear that I’m able to tell it all
The truth is a weapon, I’m the quickest on the draw
Race a life and playing chicken, I ain’t getting out the car bitch

[Hook]
You riding so cold, treble real low, bass keep thumping, we nodding
Niggas turned up, smoke in the air, Kush rolled up, we mobbing
You riding so cold, treble real low, bass keep thumping, we nodding
Niggas turned up, smoke in the air, Kush rolled up, we mobbing

[Verse Two: Droop-E]
Me, I’m a pro, they? Proteges, I’m from the Bay
I got more game than Milton Bradley
Sadly, I tell you a lot of these fools fakers
No soul like some Chuck Taylors, high in the sky
Smoking cherry pie on a flight, red eye
Land at 11:45, I tell her relax, recline, kick back like recoil
Now she spoiled, it’s a wrap like foil
Shout out to rapping forte, Gilbere and E-40
The sick with it lieutenant about to bring it back like Rogaine
The niggas square like cubicles, girl, you beautiful
From your hair to your cuticles, uh, I was built for this
I was born in this shit, I was made for this uh
I don’t think y’all understand, since H3, already been a made man

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Casey Veggies]
Homie, my generation fucked over, I give out luck to four leaf clovers
At least I can save up, cop a Range Rover, got a chick in the back
And she a grade over, a little older ‘cause I’m fresher than a Folgers
My girls all in the front row, they all having good times
Wrote it down, took ten minutes to spit all good rhymes
Just trying to shine my nigga, I’m three years strong on that grind my nigga
One hand to the sky for those no longer with us
All daps and handshakes, if you paying, you’ll get us
Girl, if you come to the hotel, you laying with winners
And Inglewood killing but I stay away from splinters
And niggas hating on it ‘cause they can’t ball with us
Girl, you know that you come here and take your pictures
I’m a star, I would too if I was you especially that I know what I’m gon’ do, Veggies

[Hook 2X]
