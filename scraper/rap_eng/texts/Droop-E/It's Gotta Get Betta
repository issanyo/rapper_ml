[Intro: E-40]
It's tight out here man it's real tight
'It's real tight mane'
I don't know if it's goin get no better man
'It gotta get better man'
I mean
'What'chu mean?'
It's just seem like it keep getting worse and worse man
'It is though to be honest with you though family
It's crazy, it's ugly out here'
Uhh!

[Verse: E-40]
Pocket full of lent, a bucket with a dent
Bill collectors calling all day barely paying the rent
Eviction notice on the door landlord acting just like an anus
On the phone with PG and E try'na make payment arrangements
Glue codes high, higher than it's ever been
Cold part about it, can't afford my medicine
We gotta new president, hopefully he's heaven sent
A young black man highly educated intelligent
I was raised in the hood so what the fuck
When we a do anything to make a buck
I got the potentials but I ain't got the credentials
They say that it's simple they say it's all in my mento
My grandma just passed and I'm just leaving her funeral
The martition did a heck of a job, she look beautiful
Shortly after that bout a month in a half long
The good Lord called for my granddaddy to come home

[Hook: Mike Marshall]
I go hard all day
But I can't sleep at night
I got money on my mind
And right now everything's tight
It's gotta get betta
It's gotta get betta round here
Cause it can't get no worse
It's gotta get betta
It's gotta get betta, aye
It's gotta get betta
It's gotta get betta, aye
Cause it can't get no worse

[Verse 2: E-40]
Uhh! Have you ever fell out with your folks that'chu co-sign
Cause you wanted to borrow some money but'chu didn't have it at the time?
Well I did and the little bit that I got I earned it
But family, I can't squeeze juice out of attorney
Should I start selling trees, or should I keep my job at Applebee's
Why set up for pennies, when I can make G's
My bank killing with these overdraft fees, bouncing checks and
My credit already fucked up so send me to collections
And to make things worse, I just found out
They called me at work the doctor say I got gout
When got tested the other day wasn't feeling too great
Cause gout feels ten times worse than a toothache
Car broke down, cell phone off
But I ain't goin kill myself, I ain't soft
Even when I be drinking I be talking to the man up above
Lord, when my time is up, will you let me into your club?

[Hook: Mike Marshall/E-40]
I go hard all day (I go hard)
But I can't sleep at night (I can't sleep)
I got money on my mind (money on my mind)
And right now everything's tight (it's tight mane)
It's gotta get betta (It's gotta get betta)
It's gotta get betta round here (that's real)
Cause it can't get no worse (can't get no worse)

[Bridge: Mike Marshall/E-40]
Blessed are the meek
For they shall inherit the earth (what else mane)
But people on the street (what they doing)
Still self-medicating away the hurt (that's real)
Marvin warned us (what Marvin tell us)
To save the babies (save the babies)
Have you looked in these kids eyes they are all so angry (all so angry)
Things are gotta get better (what else mane) Better
It gonna get better (it gotta get betta) Better
I don't really know (yeah) what it's coming to
(I don't know what it's coming to)
But it's gotta get better, better
It gotta get better round here, better (yeah)
I don't really know (I don't know mane) what it's coming to
(But uh)
