[Chorus]
Miss mary jane got me feelin like oooo miss mary jane got me feelin like ooo
Roll her up roll her up everybody roll her up all the roller on deck
Let her essence fill you up like ooo
Miss mary jane got me feelin like ooo

Yo im there where Iâ€™m gone (gone) I'm on jupiter perfect zone sucked her like a lozenger
Feeling like philosophers and I ain't hit her too hard I tapped tapped tapped that
I'm just a young g perking on vice c burgundy grab a cup feel free to copy currently
Im stuck playing call of duty my lady loves mary jane too but she ain't fruity ashtrays
Full of booties my eyes looking like rubies my lids naturally droopy and Im loaded and
I ain't in the mood for talking mary jane got me coughing try to put me in the coffin

[Chorus]

Higher than a satellite full of that dro holla at a player when you ready to go
I was a boy scout you was a girl scout cookie, member that time we played hookie and
I gave you a hickey and it was purple and we smelled like grass so we got in trouble ?
Well that was then and this is now miss mary jane ( does you needs 1:45) would you have my child?
So I can light a cigar and celebrate life plant my seeds in the yard make you my wife
My mighty clouds enjoy a secret garden northern lights watching reruns of Martin
Takin first class flights, vacation I heard they legalized reefer why go to Costa Rica
When we can chief in Eureka, vegetation I heard they have the best chiva cannabis sativa is way up here in Menasita

[Chorus]

Uh I met chu in the womb and I'll be with you till my tomb ( forever )
Is like i'm holdin ten thousand helium balloons is you're the most that I consume
When they smell you in the room i tell em this shit perfume say she take me anywhere so
I told her to the moon lets go and we hopped on a plane fired up went  zoom
This shits you smokin on ain't all that you assume you was gone till november
But we stayed till June every bit I let in my eyes start reddin when
I got my card it was sorta like a wedding ( congratulations)
And I ain't even had to put a ring on yo fist, the only female in the street
I feel safe enough to kiss (muah) moving to the music the beat we ever miss(miss )
But we dont dance all we do is twist sticking to the script uz
I know she won't switch and she don't trip if I call them my bitch

[Chorus]
