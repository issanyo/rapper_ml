[Verse 1: E-40]
Rock, paper, scissors
Last resort a dull butter knife
Try'na get rich twice
Taking my chances rolling the dice
Grittin' all day
Califor-nye-aye
Where we love the kids but we don't play
Like my nigga Keak Da Sneak say
I make my money fast
I stay gone like the past
Try'na make my money greener
Greener than my grass
See that brall right there she got ass
I met this chick from Poland
I'm all up in her colon
Left the pussy swollen
When I was poking

[Hook: DecadeZ]
I just need just one more sip to-to-to take home
I been in the streets I just can't leave em alone
Make my money fast yeah I'm in my zone
Better catch me while I'm moving baby I'm on the go
I stay gone
Stay gone (x3)
I stay gone
Stay gone (x3)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Uhh!
It ain't enough hours in the day to get what I need done
The breadwinner of the family, the chosen one
Imagine a car without a motor
I carry the world on my shoulder
Errday since I was a kid age 12
Throwing papers from Vallejo Times Herald
On the Hillside of Vallejo
I went to Franklin Junior High
English and reading not always fail
But when it came to math I was the God
Uhh, I be busy
I ain't got time to watch TV
I ain't got time to play Call of Duty
I ain't got time to watch a movie
I ain't got time to listen to what's going on in your home I got problems on my own
BEATCH!

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: E-40]
Uhh!
I got gouda to get that's what I told my tendo
I'll be gone till Decembo
About a half a year
Don't nothing come to a sleeper but a nightmare
I'm a hustler not a loser
Try'na make our lifes better for the future
I'm a pimp polly gamish up in Curle
On my way to the Nevtherlands, Amsterdam, Eurail
Me and a couple of my hoe bitches
Finna go in to buisness
No bullshit all legit
Brought the step-up shop in the red light district
The red light district like Ludacris' song?
Yeah, and I'll be sending y'all some money home
I'll fly ya out if your horny I know you gone be lonely
But if ya cheat on me I'm going upside your dormitory
BEATCH!

[Hook:]
