[Chorus:  D-Day & Tamoya Bell]
Hey
Pocket full a dough, headed to the store
Like what it's gone be with it
Hey, had the pedal to the floor and the Chevy on 4's
Like I'm rollin' with me with it
Hey, what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Hey
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be

[Verse 1:  E-40]
I roast a ho
I'm Lieutenant Roast-a-Botch, ask about me though
I don't play no childish games and I don't fuck with lames
I'm a top hat in the game, playin' with a little change
On the 1300 block is where I learned my knowledge
Narcotic vendor, A-1 yola, not that garbage
Me love to smoke the reefer, make me feel so ???
Me love to blow sativa keep me woke and hyphy
Sometimes the quietest one in the room is the loudest
Sometimes the loudest one in the room is the cowardest
When there's a play in motion, best believe I'm in it
Long as it makes good business sense and we winnin'
I landed on Earth in a spaceship coming from Mars
With a pencil and a notepad full of bars
Started cookin' up coke in pots and pickle jars
If I wanted to every day I could buy a new car
Biatch!

[Chorus:  D-Day & Tamoya Bell]
Hey
Pocket full a dough, headed to the store
Like what it's gone be with it
Hey, had the pedal to the floor and the Chevy on 4's
Like I'm rollin' with me with it
Hey, what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Hey
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be

[Verse 2:  D Day]
In the store, like what it's gone be
Either ??? Or Hennessey homie let's see
Two packs of the wraps for that loud pack
And a fat pack of Magnums, how 'bout that
Whoa, had a pocket full of dough
Headed to the store, like what it's gone be nigga
Whoa, had the pedal to the floor and the Chevy on 4's
Like I'm rollin' with me nigga
Uh, had to stop and check my profile
For the ones who ain't knowin', bet they know now
I'm the one used to kick it with the slow style
While I kick back and let the dough pile, wow
Yeah, got me chillin' with my folks
And these niggas know I'm fittin' to smoke, where your lighters at?
Whoa, got me puffin' on the do'
And these niggas know I be lovin' when it's like that
Uh, right back to business
In other words, yeah we still on fitness
Take a sip of my drink when I finish
Y'all know how I'm gonna end this

[Chorus:  D-Day & Tamoya Bell]
Hey
Pocket full a dough, headed to the store
Like what it's gone be with it
Hey, had the pedal to the floor and the Chevy on 4's
Like I'm rollin' with me with it
Hey, what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Hey
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be

[Verse 3:  E-40]
Uh, what it's gone be
I could sell honey to a bee
I could sell a locksmith a key
Sell a dispensary some tree
I got the mouthpiece of a P
A pimp
A bitch I'll never be
A simp
Used to be underprivileged
Now I drink Privilege
Release my love ones in the penitentiary
Buyin' my music through CorrLinks and JPay
Hella swole, come up out the shirt
Calisthenics, burpees and bar work
Was raised in a quicksand habitat
Where the majority was Pilipino and black
You pickin' up what I'm puttin' down?
If you can't swim, you bound to drown
Biatch!

[Chorus:  D-Day & Tamoya Bell]
Hey
Pocket full a dough, headed to the store
Like what it's gone be with it
Hey, had the pedal to the floor and the Chevy on 4's
Like I'm rollin' with me with it
Hey, what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Hey
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
Tell me what it's gone be
