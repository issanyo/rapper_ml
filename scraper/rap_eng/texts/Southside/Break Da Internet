[Intro]
I walk and talk like a check my nigga, like
Don't slip on the drip
Error, error, she might fuck around and crash, hahaha

[Chorus]
If they found out who I'm fuckin' I'ma break the internet (hey)
She shake ass on the gram, time to break the internet
He want attention, chasing clout, tryna break the internet (pussy)
If I upload my account, I'ma break the internet (crash)
If I post a million cash I'ma break the internet
They like damn look at Bagg, he just broke the internet
When she walk she know she bad, she gon' break the internet
Skrrt skrrt skrrt, that whip fast, bet it break the internet

[Verse 1]
Ayy my bitch look like a Kardash'
She trippin', all in the car mad (why?)
Keep bringin' up hoes from the past
I told her shut up and bought her a bag (lil bitch)
Then I proceed to get to the cheese
My pockets on full but my tank on E
I walk around with all this goddamn money
I don't need no teller, got the bank on me (hey)
They like how I'm dressin' (I'm dressin', I'm stylin')
Racks bleu cheese (racks blue, ooh)
Water, water on me (swim and splash)
These blue seas (ocean)
Yellow my diamonds, they butter (ugh)
I'm in the coupe with the cutter
Nut on her face, I'ma slut her (ugh)
Then sell a brick to her brother (hah)
I got my name out the concrete (concrete)
You in the back like the carseat (pussy)
Paint you a picture, artist
Might show my bitch on my IG (hey)
She topped me out of a knapsack (hey)
These bitches poison, anthrax (hey)
I want that cap like a snapback (ugh)
Let me record it on Snapchat (snap)

[Chorus]
If they found out who I'm fuckin' I'ma break the internet (hey)
She shake ass on the gram, time to break the internet
He want attention, chasing clout, tryna break the internet (pussy)
If I upload my account, I'ma break the internet (crash)
If I post a million cash I'ma break the internet
They like damn look at Bagg, he just broke the internet
When she walk she know she bad, she gon' break the internet
Skrrt skrrt skrrt, that whip fast, bet it break the internet

[Verse 2]
I might just make her my missus (wifey)
Get her some ass and some titties (surgery)
Then I'ma Rollie her wrists (bust down)
I'll have her shit on these bitches (ugh)
She want the dick from the front (front)
She gon' make your boy give her the junk
He can't make a hit like a blunt (so what?)
So he tryin' publicity stunt
I know that you notice me (notice me)
These bitches all over me like I was Jodeci (singer)
Got the stick in the coat with me (coat with me)
It ain't no foldin' me, it ain't no ho in me
I'ma break the social sites, ridin' in a creature, parasite
Look how my teeth flare at night
Ruger, NuNu, scary sight (bop bop)

[Chorus]
If they found out who I'm fuckin' I'ma break the internet (hey)
She shake ass on the gram, time to break the internet
He want attention, chasing clout, tryna break the internet (pussy)
If I upload my account, I'ma break the internet (crash)
If I post a million cash I'ma break the internet
They like damn look at Bagg, he just broke the internet
When she walk she know she bad, she gon' break the internet
Skrrt skrrt skrrt, that whip fast, bet it break the internet
