[Intro]
Yeah
A nigga come for your spot
Take that shit
He supposed to
Southside

[Chorus]
Firin' at niggas, firin' at niggas
Firin' at niggas outside
I feel like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' back firing at niggas, boom! Firin' at niggas
I hear sirens, I'm firin', I'm firin' at niggas
I'm like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' back

[Verse 1]
I'm slick, I flick my wrist, she see, I snatch yo bitch
That's it, put my hand up on her hip, I hit, I dip
Who you with? You say him and him and him and him and him
But when drama come, who comin' with you?
Cricket chirp None of them
I just make fun of them, how you gon' run with them, maybe doin' the running man
They stay in place, they place the bat on base, they love to play them games
You pace & pace, you don't know who is who, so glad I can't relate
Pretty good at seein' who is real and who is anime
Especially with a bitch, I'm never messy with a bitch, look
Most of these hoes is just a quiz, so don't try and test me with a bitch, stress me with a bitch
I am not the one, matter fact, I take it back, I'm number one
Hit the lotto with the rapper number one
DJ Khaled with the racks, another one, look how far we come
Last year I made 6 figures, most niggas say "That ain't shit, nigga"
But I still ain't got a hit, nigga, I got fans, HXLY be the clique nigga
When I get bigger, that's the plan though, Plan B, that's not a plan, hoe
So you dickridin' niggas gettin' pregnant with the twins, you gon' have to have those

[Verse 2]
Do not try to play with me, you better watch what you say to me
Lately, my mind has been crazy, my mama ain't here so my heart got a vacancy
"Woooo!" like the pastor be, my favorite fooood is the mac & cheese
And bitch, I ain't talkin' bout mac & greens, I'm talking "kla-kla-kla ping ping
Ping" for the shots that missed you (who?), you better drop that pistol (shit)
Might as well pop that pussy (why?), Korea gon' drop that missile (bang)
I'll probably be in UK, though, I'm still alive, you halo
Alhamdulillah to my akhs locked up that'll still come wet you with the Draco
Fuck that, get on all-fours when she bust that
Say she on birth control, don't touch that
I'ma just bust on her mouth like a nutcrack
Jordan Howard all up in a hoe like run-back
Back it up and she gon' clap like a jump jack
Jack a nigga spot like she tryna make him cum, yap
Now I'm at the top like a layer, when you sun tan
Flow give a nigga pussy sun tan, run man
Know I'm the best, if you look back at history they be ignorin' the best
And you show 'em the sweat, bitch I done been in the sauna for years, I ain't passin' out yet
Pass me the crown, I'ma stomp on that shit
I don't do hand me downs, had the pot and I pissed
Got some pots for my clique, so we all gon' be rich
But my plans is so big that it's so hard to quit

[Chorus]
Firin' at niggas, firin' at niggas
Firin' at niggas outside
I feel like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' back firin' at niggas, boom! Firin' at niggas
I hear sirens, I'm firin', I'm firin' at niggas
I'm like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm comin' back

[Outro]
Click clack, pow pow, bow, man down
Click clack, pow pow, who your man now?
Click, click, click, click, click, pow pow..
