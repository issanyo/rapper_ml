[Hook x2]
I done teamed up like goddamn
Got these hoes like goddamn
All these ice that I'm rockin'
Got a nigga like goddamn
Light the city up goddamn
Fresh as hell like goddamn

[Verse 1]
All these goons and these goblins
They don't care about nothin'
Bitch you suckin' and fuckin'
After that you get nothin'
After that you get nothin'
Ain't no kissin' and huggin'
Ain't no lovin' and dovin'
No no no no
I'm constantly stackin' this dough
You could be here with me reaping these benefits if you wasn't such a hoe
Pimpin' ain't dead, it's just niggas that scared
Lemme show you how I go
I give out line after line after line after line like a nigga out here with the blow
Switchin' lanes like I'm switchin' the flow
Give me brain, put the stick in her throat
And this chain cost a brick of the coke
All these rings cost a brick of the coke
You out of your mind, must be goin' insane
See we not the same, come from different cloth
Ain't talkin' 'bout planes, I'm takin' off
But when we on the plane she take it off
Ayyy

[Hook x2]
I done teamed up like goddamn
Got these hoes like goddamn
All these ice that I'm rockin'
Got a nigga like goddamn
Light the city up goddamn
Fresh as hell like goddamn

[Verse 2]
Got the whole city rockin'
Got the whole club poppin'
12's in my trunk knockin'
Heard them niggas been plottin' (fuck them niggas mayne)
You signed to me you ain't floppin'
Your album comin', it's droppin'
Ace of Spades what we poppin'
[?]
300000 for that drop in
Half the time I don't hop in
Half the time I just cop it
Just cause it's on the margain
My girl say I need to stop it
But she gon' fuck 'soon as I park it

[Hook x2]
I done teamed up like goddamn
Got these hoes like goddamn
All these ice that I'm rockin'
Got a nigga like goddamn
Light the city up goddamn
Fresh as hell like goddamn
