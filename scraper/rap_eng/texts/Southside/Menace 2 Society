[Verse 1:]
These rap niggas claim they real, but the streets don’t vouch
I keep the real niggas with me boy when we go out
I keep the bad bitch with me low and she go south
And ain’t no bullshit popping boy in Rico house
I heard the judge tryna gon and pull the R.I.C.O. out
I heard some niggas whispering they want Rico down
Well I’ll only sell a soul, cause he’s no clown
Pick up the microphone and put them kilos down
I’m the man in the streets, I don’t need no crown
All about the cash money nigga, need no brown
And all about the cash money nigga, need no brown
If you playing with it, pussy, catch an extendo round

[Chorus:}
Menace to society
Menace to society
Menace to society
Menace to society
Judge wanna label me a menace to society
(Judge wanna label me a menace to society)
Menace to society
Menace to society
Menace to society
Menace to society
Judge wanna label me a menace to society
(Judge wanna label me a menace to society) [Let’s get it]

[Verse 2:]
Them people came and got me when I was poppin for the sake of time
But they ain’t stop at nothing, show them niggas you got next in line
Bands on me, got them bands on me like a second line
Grra on a nigga, pop a nigga that’s a homicide
Ride for my niggas, die for my niggas, La Familia
High with my niggas, fly with my niggas, La Familia
Stripes with my niggas, pipe with my niggas, La Familia
Never argue with a nigga, Richie he a nasty dealer
Six shots of Remy got me faded off the liquor
Club going crazy, going crazy off the liquor
These niggas think they raw but I’m so mufuckin sicker
Now put your hands up like this a mufuckin stick up (Richie!)

[Chorus:}
Menace to society
Menace to society
Menace to society (Tryna keep a real nigga down)
Menace to society
Judge wanna label me a menace to society  (Bullshit ain’t bout nothing nigga. We ain’t going for non of that)
(Judge wanna label me a menace to society)
Menace to society (We ain’t playing with you niggas no more man. These niggas out here playing firing ain’t finna play fair fuck em.)
Menace to society
Menace to society
Menace to society
Judge wanna label me a menace to society (These niggas ain’t playing fair man fuck em. Gotta earn my respect nigga.)
(Judge wanna label me a menace to society)

[Outro:]
It’s La Familia over everything nigga
It’s La Familia forever
Real nigga time in the dirt man
These niggas wanna talk about what they did in the streets nigga
What they did in the hustle game
When talk about the rest they got in they pocket man, I don’t see it
These niggas posin man I don’t see it
Niggas ain’t smoking better gas than us
Niggas ain’t fucking badder bitches than us
It’s the mufuckin family nigga
Y’all niggas don’t know where this shit came from man
See I wasn’t here to push my first shit
Shit a classic, but I’m finna mufuckin rip the streets with this
Ay Sizzle, we gon feed the streets with this my nigga (Hey!)
