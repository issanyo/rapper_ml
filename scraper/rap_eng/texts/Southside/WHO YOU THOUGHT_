[Chorus]
Who the fuck you thought I was?
We riding through the city with some tommy guns
We pull up on address we shoot with no practice get laid no mattress uh
You talkin’ that shit we got extended clips that’s attached to those tommy guns
Who the fuck you thought I was?
Who the fuck you thought I was?
Who the fuck you thought I was?

[Verse 1]
I swear if you show up tonight it is bound to get violent
These guns loud, no silence
They spray like a hydrant
I got enough money that I could buy islands
Fuck you mean?
I am just really a god amongst men
No I’m not washing my sins
Yes I am guilty, I’d do it again
And it doesn’t depend
Here my story begins
I am not fuckin’ wit you
I don’t care how you do
Fuck out my face
Or I be whippin' those tanks
Make your ass go to space
Leave you dead with no trace

[Chorus]
Who the fuck you thought I was?
We riding through the city with some tommy guns
We pull up on address we shoot with no practice get laid no mattress uh
You talkin’ that shit we got extended clips that’s attached to those tommy guns
Who the fuck you thought I was?
Who the fuck you thought I was?
Who the fuck you thought I was?

[Verse 2]
That "gang, gang, gang" shit get on my nerves
I should cop me a Porsche just to see me swerve
I see yo ass talkin’ and barking, oh man here your door comes a knockin’
It isn’t that shocking, that I do a walk in and head mama’s room
Yeah
This bitch better stop playin'
Go super saiyan on her
I get to my slaying  I have her ass prayin' that she get to stayin', I call that Uber
I told her ass please
Get your ass steppin' just leave
Pussy wasn’t good enough for ol’ me

[Chorus]
Who the fuck you thought I was?
We riding through the city with some tommy guns
We pull up on address we shoot with no practice get laid no mattress uh
You talkin’ that shit we got extended clips that’s attached to those tommy guns
Who the fuck you thought I was?
Who the fuck you thought I was?
Who the fuck you thought I was?

[Bridge]
I chop yo damn head off you done pissed my ass off you did
I come to your house with a sawed and unload some shots off
And blood stain your carpet I did

[Chorus]
Who the fuck you thought I was?
We riding through the city with some tommy guns
We pull up on address we shoot with no practice get laid no mattress uh
You talkin’ that shit we got extended clips that’s attached to those tommy guns
Who the fuck you thought I was?
Who the fuck you thought I was?
Who the fuck you thought I was?
