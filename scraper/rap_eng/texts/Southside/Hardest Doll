[Intro]
Southside on the track, yeah

[Chorus]
Bitch, she think I need her, uh
Remember they ain't want to feed me, uh
Ain't got to knock no bitch, I hold my own
You late, ain't keeping up
Bounce right back like cross them folk?
Can't you see I'm conceited, uh
If these hoes ain’t wear designer
Watch them fakes expose themselves
Ain't no dolly house in Asian Town
Over 30, passed around
Pretty face and chopper, send a big bitch in an ambulance
Play me like a rookie
Watch this chopper blow your Birkin down
Speaking on my name
When bitches know I make that drumming sound

[Verse 1]
Bag Chanel, tags
Fly to Hawaii, relax
Fendi, I'm spending this cash
Young, baddest, making 'em mad
Bitches be hating, snakes, jakes, envy and wanting your place
I had to move states to chill, vibe out at crib by the lake
You dissing? I’m honored
Pussy dripping, Arnold Palmer
They wishin' Gucci sun up
Ain’t no bitch like me, I promise
Play with them racks
Venus, Serena, beat a ho up like she Tina
Speak on my name, toting my Nina, it was a pleasure to meet you
Off Addys, I'm rollin, no emotions, I won't show 'em
These diamonds, VV, glow up
Sick of niggas, just might throw up
Cut off the fake, took all the cake
Switching my nigga, like Bape
All in my face, riding my wave
Say that you tough, really ain’t

[Chorus]
Bitch, she think I need her, uh
Remember they ain't want to feed me, uh
Ain't got to knock no bitch, I hold my own
You late, ain't keeping up
Bounce right back like cross them folk?
Can't you see I'm conceited, uh
If these hoes ain't wear designer
Watch them fakes expose themselves
Ain't no dolly house in Asian Town
Over 30, passed around
Pretty face and chopper, send a big bitch in an ambulance
Play me like a rookie
Watch this chopper blow your Birkin down
Speaking on my name
When bitches know I make that drumming sound

[Verse 2]
Ooh, that my bitch
New Cs on my fit
I got all the drip
Recipes, I turn and whip
Say you just got hip
I'm wavy, hop aboard my ship
Set a trend in every picture
Bitch, I'm really lit
Dropping the bag off
Water the cash fall
Shooters, they mask off
Put on my shoes, now I’m mad tall
Blow my back down
Eat me like a hash brown
I got racks now
I smoke out the pack now
I'm pretty and hood
Made the way? You wish you could
You bark? I wish you would
Watch me leave these bitches shook
Saddity and cool
Pussy, it's gon' overrule
Thinking I'ma fool
Play yourself, I never lose

[Chorus]
Bitch, she think I need her, uh
Remember they ain't want to feed me, uh
Ain't got to knock no bitch, I hold my own
You late, ain't keeping up
Bounce right back like cross them folk?
Can't you see I'm conceited, uh
If these hoes ain't wear designer
Watch them fakes expose themselves
Ain't no dolly house in Asian Town
Over 30, passed around
Pretty face and chopper, send a big bitch in an ambulance
Play me like a rookie
Watch this chopper blow your Birkin down
Speaking on my name
When bitches know I make that drumming sound
