[Hook]
I got the T H C [x8]
Higher plane
You know im  bout what i preach [x8]


[Verse]
Talk is cheap ima show and prove it
You talk about it ima go and do it
Im actin wild cause im under pressure
But i keep my composure when goin through it
Time to appear, no longer a student
Im'a fly in my lane like im Tony Stewart
Man im always doin' while you barely movin'
You suckas losin' fast i ain't even lookin'
Every minute yea you know im cookin'
You say you a player but you plain shook
While im flyin' you playin on facebook
Why you lyin' im sick of you can't look
Yea im fried every day i feel damn good
I get high everywhere like i never could
They gon' try to imprison me never would
Im a man on a mission i ain't a crook
Ima speak the truth, you know thats how i do when i hit the booth
If you fuck with the kid ima break your tooth
If they wanna find you they gon' need a sleuth and a way to prove it
Cause im never slowin down
Only goofin off i do is smokin pounds
Make your way around, go ahead and follow
I'm the mothafuckin king of Higher Sound
