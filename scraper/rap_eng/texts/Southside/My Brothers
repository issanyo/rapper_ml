[Intro: Future]
You know this shit adding up right now, you know what I'm sayin' like Freebandz Gang, Taliban Gang. Same thing, same difference, dig what I'm sayin'? I'm finna spazz out right quick though, check gang though

[Hook: Future]
My brother, my goon, my goon, my nigga, my partners
Hold up, we try to be cool but cool you niggas want problems
Hold up, please don't enter Atlanta, we gotta get to 'em
Aye, ride up and load up them hammers nigga we been doin' it
That check, that check, that check on me away
Aye, I just took a dab of some molly bars
Aye, I just fucked a stripper out at Follies bar
And I'm still running with the same gang

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Op shit, pop shit
12 can't stop shit
Please name one bitch
I cannot hit
She my main squeeze, these other bitches can't be
I need you to thank me cause other niggas ain't me
My brothers, my brothers, my goons, my goons
You better not touch 'em, or be hit with the brooms
Better not make me mad
Got the things that'll make the news
I don't mean to break the rules
But look at what you made me do
Never heard of dog food until they heard of Ralo
Every time I buy a brick it like I hit the lotto
I got more cheese than a nacho
Please free El Chapo
Tell 'em that I don't cuff 'em
I ain't fuckin' with these thot hoes

[Hook: Future]
My brother, my goon, my goon, my nigga, my partners
Hold up, we try to be cool but cool you niggas want problems
Hold up, please don't enter Atlanta, we gotta get to 'em
Aye, ride up and load up them hammers nigga we been doin' it
That check, that check, that check on me away
Aye, I just took a dab of some molly bars
Aye, I just fucked a stripper out at Follies bar
And I'm still running with the same gang

[Verse 2: Ralo]
Same niggas with me, every day I recount
Only way I ever seen your bitch was on her kneecaps
Every nigga in my car strapped, fuck a seatbelt
All these pussy niggas join a gang because they need help
(Help me it's mayday, it's mayday)
You fuckin' on shit in the club
Ain't hard for a bitch to sleep when she sleep with a thug
See me a bowl or see me with nothin' at all
Give me the role, got people they want me to fall
I never turn my back on my brother and I never will
He know I never steal and I would never tell on him
Anything I got or ever had he can get half of
Even when I'm mad, it's all love, we call it mad love

[Hook: Future]
My brother, my goon, my goon, my nigga, my partners
Hold up, we try to be cool but cool you niggas want problems
Hold up, please don't enter Atlanta, we gotta get to 'em
Aye, ride up and load up them hammers nigga we been doin' it
That check, that check, that check on me away
Aye, I just took a dab of some molly bars
Aye, I just fucked a stripper out at Follies bar
And I'm still running with the same gang

[Verse 3: Future]
I got that money in the bag, the money like uh
I got that money in the bag, the money like uh
Hold up, Ralo got that check and ran it up
We don't give a fuck about you, what you worth?
Look at my wrist, that's a foreign car on me
I get to flickin' my wrist with that Audemars on me, woah
Gotta be a real real shooter to stand by us, uh
Taliban Gang, we wet this party up
All my niggas still wanna gang bang
And I'm still runnin' with the same gang
I just empty the clip and flip the clip, brp
Fit the big bullets in the clip, brp

[Hook: Future]
My brother, my goon, my goon, my nigga, my partners
Hold up, we try to be cool but cool you niggas want problems
Hold up, please don't enter Atlanta, we gotta get to 'em
Aye, ride up and load up them hammers nigga we been doin' it
That check, that check, that check on me away
Aye, I just took a dab of some molly bars
Aye, I just fucked a stripper out at Follies bar

[Outro: Future]
Ralo got that check and ran it up
Fit the big bullets in the clip, brp
