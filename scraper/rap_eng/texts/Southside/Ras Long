[verse 1]
Eh watch
In Trinidad
Everybody's burn
If you'z a pushaman
Jed you sure to earn
A rocket launch
We go pass it, zoom
A legalize law
Hope they pass it soon
Seen lawyers roll
Smoke and pass it too
Have men in government
Getting frass since school
Jails loaded with men
Who use grass like tools
They're in jail
Yet the ganja passing through
Look: and it's not from sheer dumb luck
It's 'cause Trini people they love bucks
People poor yet they love much
Mauby pockets but want guts
Filled up with that champagne
And they don't care about young ones
How much fatherless homes
Allyuh wah leave 'cause he take some puffs?
Nah boy

[Hook]

[verse 2]
Allyuh party on the streets for like 2 days straight
Drinking 'nuff alco just to make the 2 days great
Trinis does probably drink about 2k crates
To beat tiredness and sunburn, yet u hate grade?
Huh?
Allyuh ass could even drive home?
Head movin like a cyclone
Tell me how that ain't worse
Than puffin on de hyrdro?
Allyuh attitude Tyronn
Yeah it's blase, quite wrong
That's the reason that I smoke
My thoughts' be heights tho
Yours common like rice though
Herbs the plug to mother earth
That's why rasta them ital
Expand your knowledge, it's vital
Love a kush that's grown clean
Smell like I spray Lysol
That's a thriller like Michael
Bun colly, that's Nyquil
I'z a man I like to work
Even though I'z be high still
We have an oil crisis
I'z burn it, that's my drill
Let the people smoke every strain
Stop lettin rich greedy Trinis profit off we pain
Blaze again

[Hook]

[Outro]
Zoom yeah, mmm nah nah nah nah nah
Roll a spliff, and get fucking high
