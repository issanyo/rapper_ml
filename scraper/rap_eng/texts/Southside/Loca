[Hook]
I break a brick, I bag yo' bitch, I tell ya ho come over
All I know is coke so where the hell my baking soda?
Yeah, I got a Chevy with a exquisite motor
And they call me crazy cause I'm livin' la vida loca!
Loca, li-livin' la vida loca! Loca, li-livin' la vida loca!
And they call me Tony cause I'm plugged up with Sosa
Skrr! Skrr! Skrr! Skrr! Livin' la vida loca!

[Verse 1]
All I whip is coca, whip it with the soda
Skrr! Skrr! Skrr! Skrr! Not Coca-Cola
Ferrari Testarossa, ride it, rollercoaster
Never leave the toaster if you fuck me over
All a mi tugs, dey my soldier, drive by in-a the Rover
Skrr! Pull over, bullet, heat take you over
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Laugh like a joker, huh!
Speed off (skrr!) like mi supposed to, hey!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You ain't talk no money, tell 'em callate la boca
Break a brick, I bag yo' bitch and fuck her on the sofa
Never leave my chopper and I always got my cobra
Nigga, you a pussy so I'mma call you a chocha
Play with these niggas like poker, skrr skrr in my 'Rosta
Doggin' ya ho like a Dober, never leave the super soaker
Ridin' on ya like a vulture, all my killers on payola
Double cuppin', no Crayola, all my niggas movin' Yoda

[Hook]

[Outro]
Loca! (break a brick) Loca! (bag yo' bitch)
Loca! Livin' la vida loca!
Loca! (break a brick) Loca!
Where my baking soda? Livin' la vida loca!
