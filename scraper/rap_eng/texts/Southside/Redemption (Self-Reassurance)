[Verse]
Today should've been a good day
But ya boy missed, never had a good game
And if I wasn't metaphorically speaking
Chances are I could all blame a foot sprain
Fuck an excuse though, I'm still the numero uno
You know, Mayweather for these Chris Eubanks and Brunos
New spitters ain't better, but nowadays just being new is a loophole
When it comes to words, I've got a masters in Scrabble
It's like Columbo playing Cluedo
Plus the new flow, nouveaux
Crystal clear, and I'm a boss like you know
What's the name again? Hugo
Had a little mainstream light this year
Still I'm underground, I'm getting tube home
People looking at me like say man a terrorist
Cuh this kind of beard could snap a fine toothcomb
My, I be [?] Rudolph
I just might reindeer on a few folks
Tell a nigga lay there, don't move, no
Freestyling on the pavement
Trade pound for the Pagans
Bitch slaps, gift wrap
Kidnapped, tryna break out of the basement
They're saying that you got a chain round without a blade in
I find all of you fake clowns entertaining
Your mothers ain't proud of you wastemen
Big man bruddas ain't loud when I face em
I contact
I like combat
Who's been sipping the badman juice?
I know a few niggas who've died from that
Haters, man are doing well
And I'm hearing everything besides congrats
They don't wanna see a nigga like me
Getting this money and sign contracts
Fuck it, I've already got a metaphor like this
But I'm killing this mic, I'm like Conrad
Tell that girl "bill a spliff for me"
And tell my man "pass the Cognac"
Celebration
Hard work pays off
I define dedication
Look at my CV
Check my reputation
I'm probably overreacting
But today was devastating
Now I've gotta come back harder
It's all about elevation
How you mean, ease up?
(Blud, are you mad?)
How you think Wiley survived for generations?
Perseverance
Preparation
There's only a few that are bust
Who are still penetrating
The rappers rap but the MCs MC
The one everybody rates but they never say it in public
Fuck it, my nigga, it ain't nothing
Everybody in the industry pushing the same button
Overlooking Ghetto, looking for something that ain't coming
Hammering the only MC that they ain't touching
Niggas doubted and doubted and now they wanna eat with me but
I ain't even putting my food in the same oven
Everybody knows J's stubborn
Some cook said that a change soon come
Sorry, someone can't see a change coming
Game in the game, gunning anybody in my way
You see the way I got anybody in my way running?
Moment of silence for that flow, you know
That's enough, no delay, burning
Every time I squeeze, I hit the target like I'm meant to
All I heard was "holy shit, he's bleeding from his temple"
I don't wanna roll with this but nigga, it's essential
He came out the pen, I filled his head full of pencil

[Outro]
Mental
Not every day 110%, you know
Sometimes 80, 75
Realise you're human
Come back and give it to them
