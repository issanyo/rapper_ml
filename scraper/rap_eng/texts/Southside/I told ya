[Pre-Hook: Momrelle & Camzino]

I told ya (this time would be different)
I told ya (but girl you made your decision)
I told ya (but girl you gotta nigga trippin)
I just might slip up and fit your position
Your friends know, your girls know that I am the realest

[Hook x2: Camzino]

I’m tired of the late-night fights, So wrong but you feel so right
Tryna hit you on a late night ting, no games you can stay the night


[Verse1: Camzino]

Tryna hit you on a late night ting
Late night tings, two rolled spliffs, we hella faded
I told you come to my zone way before I made zone
Tell these niggas I’m back on my basics
Gyal got me back on my bae shit, ex girl she back on that bullshit
I’m tired of excuses, I’m tired of these fake ass niggas sending half hearted shots
For them niggas man, I gotta use a full clip, Brrrr!

She get the flick of the wrist
That gyal gon flip when I switch, oh she crazy
Talking bout issues I write on the page
Then I say “bun the page” cos my freestyles are crazy

Bro, I go so hard on a daily
No, I don’t do any more favours
Niggas saw me working hard now they hating
Now the line ringing, ringing, ringing I’m famous

Blocking, blocking, blocking, blocking, blocking, blocking numbers, numbers now I’m too busy

Spare room, made an EP, my nigga momrelle, I know that nigga feel me
Woah! These niggas, these niggas they feel me
Woah! These women, these women, they feel me
Woo! I made a tune for the gyaldem
Now they wanna see the real me like… woah!

[Pre-Hook: Momrelle & Camzino]

I told ya (this time would be different)
I told ya (but girl you made your decision)
I told ya (but girl you gotta nigga trippin)
I just might slip up and fit your position
Your friends know, your girls know that I am the realest


[Verse2: Camzino]

I must of told you about a thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand times you need to fix your act

Old girls playing N.F.L, you shoulda seen the way I had them running back
Running, running laps, never running back
Hit it, hit it, finish never text her back
She hate me, hate me that ain’t nothing new
I might just put her dargie on the interlude
Never into them, girl I was into you
Now we separate I don’t fuck with you

Woo!

[Bridge: Camzino & Momrelle]

We coulda been something baby, now your friends dem are talkin’ crazy
I’m on a roll now, keep it all on a low down
She wanna know what I know now
But she don’t mess with me no more
She don’t mess with me, I thought I told you
I thought I told you


[Verse3: Camzino & Momrelle]

I thought I told ya, thought I told ya
You don’t listen to me
I tried my best to make it work but you don’t see the vision
You’re talking crazy, talking crazy
Round your friends you’re different
You’re acting up, acting weird, girl you seem suspicious
Plenty people in our business, girl, you love attention
Where are all them people now? They got up and left you
Now you’re searching for something, I hope you find it
I ain’t bitter I’m just saying, was it worth it?

[Outro: Momrelle &; Camzino]

I told ya (this time would be different)
I told ya (but girl you made your decision)
I told ya (but girl you gotta nigga trippin)
I just might slip up and fit your position
Your friends know, your girls know that I am the realest
