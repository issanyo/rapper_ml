[Hook: Molly Murk]
Oh that's your bitch, I don't need her
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her
Oh that's your bitch, you can keep her
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her
Are you cuffing? Am I cursing?
Why you look like that I make you nervous?
She for the gang, which one you working?
Baby, go find you a clown and join the circus

[Verse 1: 600Breezy]
Breezy what you doing? Smoking reefer
That ratchet ass bitch, yeah you can keep her
This pistol on my hip just like a beeper
And I ride around with this sweeper
Why you looking nervous?
The five on my hip, I'm tryna burn some
You steady cuffing hoes, you ain't gon' learn none
And plus we piped in this bitch, we might turn some
Green vision, 600
You ain't got no money, 100 in my tomma
There gon' be no fucking don me, you niggas looking bummy
Ain't got no job like Tommy, you niggas still it with your mommy, that hoe you cuff ain't nothing

[Hook: Molly Murk]
Oh that's your bitch, I don't need her
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her
Oh that's your bitch, you can keep her
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her
Are you cuffing? Am I cursing?
Why you look like that I make you nervous?
She for the gang, which one you working?
Baby, go buy you a car and join the circus



[Verse 2: Molly Murk]
Molly Murk, I bet your bitch know me
Ask me was I cuffing, I told her to call the police
Bitch I'm 100 so I don't fuck with 5 O
Bitch don't look like nothing, I wouldn't hit her with a tahoe
Give Joe The strap he shoot 2 times that's a free throw
La for 600 bitch and Im wit breezo
Riding up, them bullets hurt, just like a cheetoh
Ran off on the plug twice, bitch give me burritos
Now I feel like plies I got my rob on
Think about robbing your shit gon' get postponed
600 green vision, Now the shows on

[Hook: Molly Murk]
Oh that's your bitch, I don't need her
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her
Oh that's your bitch, you can keep her
Blinded by the 100s, I can't see her
Oh you cuffing? I might curve some ?
Why you look like that I make you nervous?
She for the gang, which one you working?
Baby, go find you a clown and join the circus
