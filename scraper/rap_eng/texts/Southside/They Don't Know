[Intro]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Woo, shit
Codeine got me geeking
Hold up bitch, hold up bitch
Molly got me mind speaking
I just wanna fuck ho
Suck this dick up ho

[Verse 1]
Count that bread, I want some more
Fuck her face then tell her no
I can’t spend no time with you
This shit not on my schedule
Spend a check like it’s a sport
Them hoes look like child support
Poppin’ ‘bout Lil Sizzle
Bitch you meet up with that life support
I been the bag, I been the sauce, yeah
I’m movin’ fast, let’s switch the course, yeah
Ayy, hot on flame, I got the torch, yeah
Ayy, chain gang, they hit abort, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They don’t know, they don’t know that I been stackin’ high
They don’t know, they don’t know that’s why they always high
They don’t know, they don’t know ‘cause I be switchin’ rides
They don’t know, they don’t know when I’m gon’ send them boys
They don’t know, they don’t know how I done stacked up all these millions
They don’t know how I walked up, South in the building
They don’t know I’m gon’ get a whole billion
They don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know
They don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know
They don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know
They don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, yeah

[Verse 2]
She like to talk a lot
I’m high, I’m off the pot
Some niggas don’t know what they got
I’m watching you niggas go plot
I’m tryna go buy me a lot
I’m taking these rappers lil spot
Plenty figures got my mind blown
Got a spot in every time zone
Spray it up, get my shine on
Spray it up, get my shine on
I don’t like your attitude, you should show some gratitude
Fuck you like I’m mad at you
I clap shit in my beddy boo
I don’t wanna hear that shit
You dodgin’ niggas, pay your tab
Wonderin’ why you broke as fuck
All you do is lay around
My lil niggas runnin’ up
They quick to tell ‘em lay it down
My lil niggas pullin’ up
I don’t have to say spray it down
Thirty bands all in my miniature Fendi bag
Them lil niggas know I’m the god
You stealing my nigga, I think you should give it back
My youngins say they are not feelin’ that
I spend what you took and they send it back
My wrist and my ears, that’s a hundred racks
My chain and my rings is a hundred pack
They know I be snappin’ like run it back
I spin and I move like a running back

[Chorus]
They don’t know, they don’t know how I done stacked up all these millions
They don’t know how I walked up, South in the building
They don’t know I’m gon’ get a whole billion
They don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know
They don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know
They don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know
They don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, they don’t know, ah
