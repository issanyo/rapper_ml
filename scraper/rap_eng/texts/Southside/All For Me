[Intro]
Southside on the Track, yeah
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Chorus]
I can't find no time to rest (Rest)
Cognac on my breath, all this molly I ingest (Ingest)
Time that I invest, yeah
You've been through it all (All)
Right there when you call for me (Call for me)
You knew that shit would fall
You pull up and do it all for me (All for me)

[Verse]
Yeah, the drugs made us suffocate (Suffocate)
Not quite as much as the love and hate (Love and hate)
Down for whatever and up for a couple days
When did you become this way?
I guess I ruined you (Ruined you)
Damn, what the fuck did I do to you?
The truth is it's nothing unusual (Unusual)
At times the lie is more suitable (It's true)
You're like flowers at a funeral (Funeral)
No one could see you were beautiful (Beautiful)
I know this life must be new to you (New to you)
I can't say the feeling is mutual (Mutual)
This shit getting old
Half of these woman is missing they soul (Soul)
I can't leave these bitches alone (Alone)
It's like an addiction, this shit need some different control
I might need a different approach

[Chorus]
I can't find no time to rest (Rest)
Cognac on my breath, all this molly I ingest (Ingest)
Time that I invest, yeah
You've been through it all (All)
Right there when you call for me (Call for me)
You knew that shit would fall
You pull up and do it all for me (All for me)

[Outro]
All for me
Ah, you pull up and do it all for me
All for me
Ah, you pull up and do it all for me
All for me
Ah, you pull up and do it all for me
Now I just can't get you off of me
I've been, I've been drinkin', I've been smokin' on my own
I've been doin' anything just to get back in my zone
I got ten hours left, I got drip, diamonds, ayy
A new Patek on me, ayy, I don't wanna make amends
