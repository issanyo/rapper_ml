He said he got enough room for a boss lady to sit shotgun
Cause he want to drive
And if them boys see us swerving and they want to try
Argue with him, we’ll be like Bonnie and Clyde
He’s gangster [x3]
And he’s gonna try
His bitch is pillow talking bout me
Cause all they see is us in these streets
Looked him in his eyes
Told him it was real
Your homies can’t hold you down like a chick will
Foot up on the gas, let’s keep this shit trill
Sit up on his lap while he’s handling the wheel
