[Intro: Juice WRLD]
And we sippin' purple nigga, yeah

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & G Herbo]
Honestly (Ayy, Southside, where you get all that drip?)
Honestly
Everything I wanna be
Gotta work 'til it come to me
Ain't wanna be no wannabe
Enemies they under me
Honestly I wanna be
On the beach, white sand up under me
Comfortably (comfortably)
I just want 100 G's (100 G's), foreign V's (foreign V's), Louis V (Louis V)
They like, "who is he?"

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Honestly when I was broke as fuck, you ain't notice me
You thought days I was posted up at the county jail where I'm 'posed to be
Now young nigga eating overly
I got hunnids old as trees
And money don't grow on trees
But I'm gon' blow it like leaves, ayy
Pull up with turbo V's, ayy
Two-door AMG's, ayy
I started witnessing some of the shit that felt like it was make-believe, ayy
Lil' nigga neck on freeze, ayy
Spent 100 racks on these, ayy
Seen't 'em tryna keep up and then lost everything, I can't let that happen to me, ayy
Feeling alive, I'm so happy to be, ayy
You killing my vibe, fuck how long you bitches you see me
Be happy for me, ayy
I'm fresh all the time, but you know my kicks ain't Buscemi
Capital G Fazos
Nike need me on the payroll
I just took these off a day ago
Killers gon' do what I say so
Angels gon' give you a halo
And we got money to lay low
Now when it come to the bread, I go with it like mayo
Can't let it go to my head
I had way too many days, broke

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & G Herbo]
Honestly
Honestly
Everything I wanna be
Gotta work 'til it come to me
Ain't wanna be no wannabe
Enemies, they under me
Honestly I wanna be
On the beach, white sand up under me
Comfortably (comfortably)
I just want 100 G's (100 G's), foreign V's (foreign V's), Louis V (Louis V)
They like, "who is he?"

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
I say honestly
I need honesty
Get rich and I make my mama proud of me
A young rich nigga, that's what I'm 'bout to be
Rolling gas, boy, yo shit not loud to me
I'm getting used to the fame, niggas crowding me
I got demons and these niggas brought 'em out of me
I'm on my boss shit, ain't no clowning me
Let's fuck up Saks Fifth, hit the town on me
Me and Herbo pull up in a Bentley coupe
Ain't not telling what we'll say or what we'll do
Smoke Gelato out the zip, feel like jet fuel
We'll never let a fuck nigga know our next move
Run up them big bags, that's what we into
We just some real niggas, look what we been through
I put Gucci on my backpack, but I don't like school
I know you may love me, but bitch I don't like you

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & G Herbo]
Honestly
Honestly
Everything I wanna be
Gotta work 'til it come to me
Ain't wanna be no wannabe
Enemies, they under me
Honestly I wanna be
On the beach, white sand up under me
Comfortably (comfortably)
I just want 100 G's (100 G's), foreign V's (foreign V's), Louis V (Louis V)
They like, "who is he?"
