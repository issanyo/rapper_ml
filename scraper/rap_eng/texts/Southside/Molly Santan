[Hook: Dufflebag Boogie]
I got the Molly Santan
Hang with the drum but I'm not in a band
Track the number on the work tryna know when it land
Got a plug from Japan
Free my nigga Bo out the can
My nigga got 20 for chasin them bands
My shooters pull up and they hop out in vans
These Givenchys I ain't rockin no vans

[Verse 1: Rudy Cash]
Up the 40 I won't give them no chance
True Religion on my shirt and my pants
I been juggin out here tryna get bands
Off the percs and I still want some xans
Bootup comin from the A in Santan
I been plugged in, what the fuck is you sayin?
Grab the pumps then the ARP sprayin
Pull up on him so he know I'm not playin

[Verse 2: Shabazz]
I'm off double percs, don't fuck with no xans
Might grab the Beamer just to do the dash
I facetime your bitch just to see that lil' ass
I keep losing count when I count up them bands
I remember being broke with a mag
Had a .380 that bitch never jammed
We just shoot it out before we shake hands
Blew the cash so the plug threw me 10 bands
Pull up and you know I'm takin your bitch
Damn them niggas always takin them risks
160 zips I made that shit flip
Swear that pussy torch, I hit it and dip

[Verse 3: Tae Dawg]
I got more shit on sale than Black Friday
Dej Loaf, let a nigga try me
Shoot him with the 9 11 times
Xan or a perc I popped both cause I couldn't decide

[Hook: DuffleBag Boogie]
I got the Molly Santan
Hang with the drum but I'm not in a band
Track the number on the work tryna know when it land
Got a plug from Japan
Free my nigga Bo out the can
My nigga got 20 for chasin them bands
My shooters pull up and they hop out in vans
These Givenchys I ain't rockin no vans

[Verse 4: Tae Dawg]
I got a vick in my blunt
Switch it up, step on the wood like a stump
14 ridin round with a pump
Young nigga servin gas out the trunk
I serve you the gas and I'm whippin up bump
I'm poppin these xannies I don't give a fuck
Every hit that I make, bitch I double up
And you know that we stay with them glizzys all tucked

[Verse 5: Rudy Cash]
On the highway watchin' out for state troopers
Bitch you know you how you know you a state trooper
Bitch we stay with them Glocks like we some state troopers
Better watch your mouth before you say something to us
Say you gone do something but you ain't never do it

[Verse 6: Dufflebag Boogie]
Free my nigga Bo that's why I pour a 4
I got gas like a Texaco
I just met a plug out in Mexico
Got them gas bags and purp for the low
My trap boomin like a corner store
Call me Dufflebag Don Corleone
When I'm in the club, I got that 40 on me

[Verse 7: Trill Castro]
50 in the glick, you know it's always on me
Got that drum all on the hollow tip explosive
We was jumpin fences tryna duck a sentence
Got them rackets on us like we playin tennis
I'm a cash addict, got a money fetish
I'm good with the rock just like Monta Ellis
Step out in Margiela, make these niggas jealous
Stay far from the pussy niggas cause they tellin

[Hook: Dufflebag Boogie]
I got the Molly Santan
Hang with the drum but I'm not in a band
Track the number on the work tryna know when it land
Got a plug from Japan
Free my nigga Bo out the can
My nigga got 20 for chasin them bands
My shooters pull up and they hop out in vans
These Givenchys I ain't rockin no vans
