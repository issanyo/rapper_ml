[Hook]
Word around town is we got them pounds
Word around town is you talking down
Word around town is my young niggas wildin'
We be riding through the opps with them young niggas hiding
Word around town is we got them pounds
Word around town is you talking down
Word around town is them young niggas strapped and they looking for me tell em nigga pull up where I'm at

[Verse 1]
This a real rap rest in peace to Cap
Pistol on my lap, gotta keep a gat
Word around town is I got them racks
Bibby he a stain, Bibby this and that
My niggas they don't have a conscience, heard you been talking that nonsense
Hit em up thirteen times now they been calling 'em Harden
I kept his head for a trophy, you left his arms by the garbage
I hang with killers and robbers mess up your chain cause they starving
He in the hood with his ice on
All of his youngins got pipes on
I get them piece from my white homies
I could really buy your life homie
I've just been stacking my cheddar
She gon' do just what I tell her
I love my niggas forever
For me they killing whatever

[Verse 2]
Everybody know the kid getting it
Young niggas still doing [?]
These rap niggas looking like Sisqo
VVS shine like a disco
Carlisle got a lot of rich folk popping like Crisco they hate me like Chris though
Still in the hood like Briscoe
Never got robbed for my shit though
Gucci shirt I got double G's on me
Shoes Chanel I got double C's on me
'Bout to go and cop a double R
Gonna fuck the world and I'ma do it raw
Riding around with that Glock on me
Pockets fat I got knots on me
If you let a nigga diss me
When I wasn't around then we not homies
Probably could've been a mathematician
But a nigga made bad decisions
Momma told me but I didn't listen
Judge sent my bad ass to prison
So till the world blow it's fuck the judge
Never show the nigga no fucking love
Take his ass down I say fuck the plug with the Crips cooling but I fuck with Bloods
