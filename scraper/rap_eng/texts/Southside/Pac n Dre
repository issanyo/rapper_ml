[Intro: Southside]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
You know what I'm saying?
Swerv, Swervo in this mothafucka
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Hol' up, woo
Yeah, hol' up
Yeah

[Chorus: G Herbo & Southside]
I pull up 250, I'm rolling the pressure, yeah
She suck it and swallow it, that be the reason I'm calling her special
I'm balling for real
Blow me a mill', lil' nigga, it's levels
And I'm off a pill, bitch it's for real
They dig it, no shovel
This perky be having me itching
This money be snatching they bitches
We pull up to Barney's, no riches
I beat up a jawn, then I switch it
I grind for that paper, I'm gifted
I'm geeking lil' baby, I'm lifted
And nothing can't make me stop getting (this money)
No matter the status, I'm with it

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Before you niggas smelled Actavis, I was cracking the seals
Hi-Tec pints turn upside down in the crib on the hill like Jack and Jill
This 'fore a nigga started rapping for real
I don't diss niggas, know what happen, we kill you
And I prefer Percocet for the pill
Dove off the 30, it beat like Jahlil
Fuck that, nah I'ma be like Metro
958, 100 plus in the petro
You wanna beef with the gang then leggo
Me and Sizzle brothers like Melo and [?]
Thousands, I stack by the hundreds like legos
Choppers shells pop out, then tote them like eggos
Say this mimosa, we blowing the best smoke
That Gelato got me high like stilettos
Me and Southside we like Dre and 'Pac or whatever
Wanna get some money, then come sign to Death Row
I got some niggas doing 100's on death row
I told some youngins just pull up and let go
Kick down your door, kick you right in your threshold
Shot to the head, what you rocking a vest for?
Trapped out of Shell, we ain't have no Texaco
I got niggas buying acres in Mexico
For real

[Chorus: G Herbo & Southside]
I pull up 250, I'm rolling the pressure, yeah
She suck it and swallow it, that be the reason I'm calling her special
I'm balling for real
Blow me a mill', lil' nigga, it's levels
And I'm off a pill, bitch it's for real
They dig it, no shovel
This perky be having me itching
This money be snatching they bitches
We pull up to Barney's, no riches
I beat up a jawn, then I switch it
I grind for that paper, I'm gifted
I'm geeking lil' baby, I'm lifted
And nothing can't make me stop getting (this money)
No matter the status, I'm with it

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Run it up, run it up
Go and put 100 on your wrist or something
I done went and got double-time Sky Dwellers (two of 'em)
Yeah, she checking, she like how it glisten, huh
Bust checks, nothing less than a 50, huh
Drop 40 on my 808 pendant like, "ooh"
That young nigga still independent, uh
And best believe I'ma count every penny like, "uh, bitch, ooh"
And I fucked yo bitch, ooh
And Sizzle fucked yo bitch (folks too)
Blood said he got that lil' head by the pool
Had to tell a bitch, "be bool"
Wanna fuck wit us, gotta play by the rules
You know a bunch of you come in twos
Count up that money, my mood
Fuck 'round and buy you some shoes, ooh
Fuck 'round and buy you a new coupe
Fuck 'round, let you meet the crew
They rocking diamonds too
Put that lil' face in the news
I'm on the west with the 'Rus
My neck and wrist water, no cruise
Pass out all the 20s, keep blues

[Chorus: G Herbo & Southside]
I pull up 250, I'm rolling the pressure, yeah
She suck it and swallow it, that be the reason I'm calling her special
I'm balling for real
Blow me a mill', lil' nigga, it's levels
And I'm off a pill, bitch it's for real
They dig it, no shovel
This perky be having me itching
This money be snatching they bitches
We pull up to Barney's, no riches
I beat up a jawn, then I switch it
I grind for that paper, I'm gifted
I'm geeking lil' baby, I'm lifted
And nothing can't make me stop gettong (this money)
No matter the status, I'm with it
