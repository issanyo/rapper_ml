[verse:]

Under played not underrated
Most these rappers sounding basic
Tell em I got verses, I got verses, I got hella verses for their playlist
Mandem hate but women rate me
That's why singing on a daily
I do R&B, but still wrap a rapper on like any beat
This thing is crazy

Sang them keys and did bando
Most these trappers they ain't really trapping
Do it all for image, bun your trap phone
I just murder beats and pray it die slow

Feel like I'm living on a tight rope
I make one mistake and they gon dead me off
So now I feel the pressure, can't lie though
Middle finger to the 5'O

Black lives matter, where your manners at?
Find a black man better, where he really at?

Said he's really on beef, but it's never that
Cah I spin rappers like I spin verses
Treat em like they worthless
Where the body bags?

Tell KAYG, go gimme a beat
Give it 10mins watch me body that
Even ex tings tryna holla man

Yo, they don't like me but it's cool cah darg I feel myself
Even in the summer I be cold as hell

All black that's the dress code
Burn bridges man that ship sailed
Couple girls try bait me out
I only like girl that don't kiss and tell

Shawty wanna be my main ting
Word to Yung Fume she a side hoe
She do drugs on a weekday
I gave her dope D now she a sycho
Balling, Jordan like i'm Michael
Music got me feeling Cristiano
You should see the way I hit my right though
Bernabeu is where I might go

I ain't really tryna skype though
Shawty foreign, yeah she over seas
She in love with me, it's alright though
Hit it once then I had to leave
I ain't even had to stay the night though
I been feeling alright though

In my zone, spliff pre-roll
Cah my life better I'm high though

[verse2:]

Killing rappers with my killer flows
Tell him “back up, back up” I’mma loose cannon
Kill the pussy when I dip up in it
Man that bitch was tripping, now she tapping out

My old girl she wanna rapper now
My new girl she gotta rapper now
Tryna get them bitches well acquainted
Fucking in the whizzer, they so dirty now

Dirty soda with the dirty lyrics
I just mix the fizzy with the purple in it, it’s so purple init?
I just mix it,mix it, whipping up a banger
Know my niggas feel it, making minds explode when you niggas hear it
She go low if my nigga say it

I ain't really with the talking darg
Straight from the heart, I might murk a nigga

Faded faded off the purple, nigga
My young g just murked a nigga
Really eating with the savages
You can’t manage this, I was born triller

She just, she just, she just gimme ooh, yeah yeah yeah
They got me spazzing out in the booth, yeah yeah
