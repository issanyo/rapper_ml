Everything you talk about me, all that bullshit is make believe
All you niggas talkin' 'bout the streets, nigga I'm a real OG

Everything you talk about me, all that bullshit is make believe
All you niggas talkin' 'bout the streets, nigga I'm a real OG

[Verse 1]
Caught up with the feds, you instagramming your money
Taking pictures of these bitches with your witches yous a dummy
I been up for 25 years hungry
Counting Euros from Memphis, I'm international money
O-riginal G, the hustler you wanna be
They made me a CEO, these companies work for me
My nigga that just a title
White people money they callin' me Jordan Michael
Got shooters from outer space that satellite up your ass
Got camos off in the west, still transportin' cash
Blowin' hash out my cabana
White girls with me, the real Hannah Montana
Obama callin' me 'bout his barbecues in Atlanta
Flyin' G6 if its big enough to park my Phantom
I'm still tippin', I'm drippin', still trippin', for, for that ass
I done touched a  100 mill in cash
Scratch and sniff my ass

[Hook]
Everything you talk about me, all that bullshit is make believe
All you niggas talkin' 'bout the streets, nigga I'm a real OG

Everything you talk about me, all that bullshit is make believe
All you niggas talkin' 'bout the streets, nigga I'm a real OG

[Verse 2]
Oh, hold up, now you niggas killers
You ain't hard enough to stomp a caterpillar
I throw a alligator in yo bed now you finna to watch this bitch nigga dance
Avoir some shit they say in France
100% I need mine with ass
So high, can't hit the ground
Looking up, can't find me down
Binoculars fiberoptics, helicopters, you never gonna find me 'round
I'm some 100 million dollar man shit
I got baby mommas of kings, all over the world tryna suck my dick
Talking 'like she know 'bout Memphis
Talking like she know that Three 6
Talking 'bout she want my baby, nigga you need to check your bitch
I been a boss now, ain't no time for chillin'
Sprayin' champagne on the conference call
Columbian bitch on the phone, decoding my details

[Hook]
Everything you talk about me, all that bullshit is make believe
All you niggas talkin' 'bout the streets, nigga I'm a real OG

Everything you talk about me, all that bullshit is make believe
All you niggas talkin' 'bout the streets, nigga I'm a real OG
