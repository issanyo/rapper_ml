You nigga, 10K, going on a rampage
Where you from? Clayton County, Riverdale, shawty
Beat his ass up, then I shot up the party
Catch another body, yes, catch another body, yes
Hundred round clips going in everybody
Yes, if you want respect respect
Shoot him from the chest to the fucking neck
Now you on your way
Whole place screaming out "aye!"
"Aye!"
Yes, we from the A, home of the Braves
Yes, we brave, screaming out "So Icey"
We on the way, yes, we on the way

[Verse 2]
Who that tall ass negro
With that big-ass pistol?
Blowing on that indo
What the fuck I need a friend for?
Riding with my four-four
Bullets same size as Deebo
Five shots, fuck a reload
Five-point, that's my star, baby
Fucking with the boss, then I'm going crazy
Girls in the hood say they want my baby
Aye, she want my baby
Aye, you want my baby
Waka Flocka Flame got them going crazy
But I call my K my bust it baby
Niggas talking shit, they must be crazy
Pow, pow, pow, that's my bust it baby
