[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame and girl]
You just like my swag
Nah, girl, I like that ass
Nothing but that cash in that Gucci duffel bag
'Til that pussy bring back my cash, so that's your ass
That's your ass, baby girl, that's your ass
Pimp, pimp, pimp shit
Pimp, pimp, pimp shit
Pimp, pimp, pimp shit
Pimp, pimp, pimp shit
Pimp, pimp, pimp shit
Pimp, pimp, pimp shit
Pimp, pimp, pimp shit
Pimp shit, pimp shit

[Verse 1] Waka Flocka Flame]
I need a down south, gold-wearing, Micro-wearing bitch
Oooh, I like that project shit
Hold a brick, walk the Strip, make my money fucking flip
Oh shit, twelve years on the Strip, baby, gon' and dip
G-Unit shawty, got them fifties on the block
More money in the bank off the yayo, fucking rock
D-boy life, keep them goons on the block
You might end up shot if your ass try to rob
Sideshow Bob 'cause your ass is a fraud
Mob up, squad up, bring your roll, we get money
Fetti, green, cheddar, mooca, lucha, moola, and the dollar
Hoes always scream out Waka Flocka Flame

[Verse 2: Jurrarri]
Flocka, stupid pimp shit, yeah, that's me
Ju and D4L, then So Icey
I'm something like a pimp and they don't like me
D4L and So Icey, yeah, we run the streets
My diamond is so icy and my chain on freeze
My pinky ring is shining like something, like she like me
Erica and Tasha like to do the [?]
And plus they like me ('cause so, we so icy)
Don't rock no white tee 'cause we saggy over here
Don't do no tight jeans 'cause we baggy over here
Louie, Gucci, Prada, yeah, we keep that type here
Ju and Waka Flocka pimp a bitch every year
Ju
