Thinking about my family how I miss them
Thinking about them times when I ain’t listen
I been out here balling like a piston
Looking at my wrist like how its glistening
I been getting lost up in the money bag
Do a show in cali get my money back
Everybody talking like i’m mad cool
I guess that’s why they telling me the cash rules (turn up)
I guess that’s why they telling me to sign too
Is money only thing that’s on they mind too
But I been steady tryna get this rap right
So I can go and get my brothers out the trap life

When I hit that microphone I never lie
When I hit that gas you know i’m hella high
Thinking about them struggles we would go through
And I ain’t want to say it but I told you…
I told you that we’d be here from the start tho
Cause every single thing I spit is from the heart tho
Im looking at this music like its art tho
Im listening to this music off a bar tho
I ain’t got no time I ain’t got no time
To waste it on this shit I’m focused on the grind
And i been smoking heavy, lightly sippin’
And lately i’ve been feeling hella different

I’ve been on a vibe I’ve been on a vibe
Thinking about my life when I be 25
Shit I guess i’m already 21 on the west coast soaking up the sunny sun
On the west coast but i’m from the middle
Mama used to cook them eggs upon the griddle
I remember ball when I was little
I used to have it all when I was little

I used to have it all but I wanted more
So when i get ahead i’m running up the score
When i get ahead i’m taking over
You'd best believe when i get head i’m never sober
Colder this world is getting colder
That’s why I keep this chip up on my shoulder
Talk is hella cheap so imma show ya
Im ready for this war just like a soldier
The industry be flocking like some vultures
The government they wanna just control us
That’s why I always gotta keep one rolled up (I do)
Know them other drugs are always so cut
So cut but i’m thinking so what
Imma try it anyways i’m dying so what
So what, what you really here for
Tell me what’s your purpose what you’d kill for
And tell me who you really fucking care for
And make sure that you watch the ones you care for (????)
Cause ain’t nobody safe upon this battle field
People snitching left and right they on some tattle tales
Go and board a plane go and board plane
Go and fly to another state

Forget about that shit, forget about them hoes
Forget about them bricks, forget about them O’s
Forget about that life, forget about them drugs
Forget about that wife, forget about that love
Forget about that bruh, forget about that cuz
Forget about that banging shit it's nothing much
And I can't talk about what I don’t know
I wasn’t from the streets so I don’t know
But I was never given anything
You know I had to work for everything…
You know I had to work for everything…
You know I had to work for everything…
You know I had to work for everything…
You know I had to work for everything…
Know I had to work for everything…
Everything
