[Verse 1]
Let you niggas tell it, y’all be stacking hella cake
I’m out here on my own shit, I think it’s time to elevate
I’m killing shit, I bodied this, you should’ve brought the yellow tape
You love that bitch, you stick around, I’m out of here, I fuck her face
I get that guap, that’s just my fate, aye

Y’all can push them Phantoms and them Wraiths, aye

Had to kick ‘em out the game, you know I ran ‘em out the real
I told them folks to give me millions ‘cause I’m running up the seal
And I’m lonely at the top, it’s like a nigga broke the still
Woah woah, woah shit

Niggas like my old shit, and shit I like my old shit
Still the same, still the same

Brand new wrist, I’ll never switch, I’ll never switch

Let that money flow, let that money flow
Got a couple mil, want a hundred more
That’s that money flow, that’s that money flow
Let that money flow, let that money flow
