[Verse]
I’m a flaming ball of rhymes comin' straight through your headphones
We gone get turnt, because Breydawg said so
Hate on me, fake boy don’t you even try
Cause you know I’ll take yo girl in the blink of an eye
Take her in a heart beat
Mad cause you not me
Get you haters mad till you all wanna drop me
Red solo cup, cause you know that’s wassup
It's a 14 year old but they still gone play this in the club
Gold chain on my neck, yea I'm flexin on you fella’s
Hateful stuff that y’all tell us cause y’all salty and y’all jealous
You can hate on the crew, cuz we never rocked with you
If you keep talking that mess tho we gone beat you black and blue
Yea that’s true (yea that’s true)
And I’m feeling this beat
Bomb enough to hit my ears and I’ll feel it at my feet
Try and run up on my boys, but better come prepared
Or get faded on sight, cause we don’t even care
We come through with the bangerz and you hear em
I come through with my boys and you fear ‘em
I come through and don’t care about what you think
We come through to your girl with that boonk gang
Not sorry, you could have her back tomorrow
I made her fall in love with these bars tho
Helping her up is gone be hard tho
I guess it’s never too late to start tho
And I wrote this in a night
And it’s still sounding aight
Naw it’s still sounding tight
And you know I come with flames
So recognize you better put respect on my name
It's Breydawg
