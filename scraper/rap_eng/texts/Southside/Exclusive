[Hook x2]
Why you tricking that? She ain't exclusive news
She only care about the money, she don't care 'bout you
Why you chasing that? She ain't exclusive news
She only care about the money, she don't care 'bout you
She ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no
She ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no
She ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no
She ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no

[Verse 1]
I had to swerve on the bitch, cause I'm 'bout my dollars
That's that same nasty bitch in that dirty Impala
I'm all in every city cause I'm 'bout my dough
That ho used to fuck with Dan Marino
She ride your wave like a dolphin till you lay in the coffin
She always silent in the house but in the streets just talking
Better off passing her to one of your bros
You can't be sad in the streets when we don't love them hoes

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Why you tricking that? Why you chasing that?
Why you tricking that? She ain't exclusive
