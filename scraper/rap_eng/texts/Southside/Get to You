[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Metro Boomin' make it boom
Yeah, Metro Boomin' make it boom, make it boom

[Chorus 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Don't be telling me you're through
'Cause I be thinking, that it's true, that it's true
Telling me about your new boo
When I don't wanna face the truth, if it's true
I just wanna get to you
Anything to get to you, get to you
I just wanna get to you
Anything to get to you, get to you

[Verse: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I always had you in some new Loubs
Never let you complain about your shoes, 'bout your shoes
When nobody would listen to me
I know, that I can talk to you, talk to you
'Cause everybody else is clueless, no excuses
Keep on saying they gon' do shit, never do shit
She keep saying she gon' use me, I'ma use her
I got on so many jewels, I feel like a jeweler
I pulled up in a Patek, you pulled up in a Muller
Double wedding band ring, she pulled up in a new fur
Metro Boomin' on the beat, I feel like I'm cheating
Showing me that nipple ring, I feel like you teasing
You keep begging me to eat, girl, why you beasting?
Can I take you to my suite? Yeah, for a weekend
Can you come and give me brain? Make me a genius
I could make that pussy beatbox, while I'm singing

[Chorus 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
But when you tell me you're through
I start to think, that shit is true, is it true?
Telling me about your new boo
When I don't wanna face the truth, if it's true
I just wanna get to you
Anything to get to you, get to you
I just wanna get to you
Anything to get to you, get to you
I just wanna get to...

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Future]
I need to care to you, carefully, carefully
I'm moving carefully, iggin' me, iggin' me
It don't make sense to me, send for me, send for me
Need you to win for me, care for me, care for me
And if you care, make time for me, make time for me
And when you lie to me, it just be killing me
You're acting differently, I need to get to you
I need you there for me, I need to get to you
I need to get to you, carefully, carefully
I'm moving carefully, iggin' me, iggin' me
It don't make sense to me, sin for me, sin for me
Need you to win for me, care for me, care for me
And if you care, make time for me, make time for me
And when you lie to me it just be killing me
You're acting differently, I need to care to you
I need you there for me
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
