[Intro]

Gats under my Gucci belt
Tats all on my arm
Sliding up her ocean drive
Coming down like, "Uhhhn"
Sliding up her ocean drive
Coming down like, "Uhhhn"

[Verse 1]

Gat under my belt, capital murder in my palm
My thoughts be so perverted thinking of fucking all your moms
Cause I'm a motherfucking big dog
And I don't fuck with law
Shape up your set
Snip, get clipped off
Black cloud over my head
Black Label in my veins
Black 40 on my lap
Black future in this game
It's crucial out here mane
Staying sane, trying to sustain
Coward no such thing
My bounty more than my chain
Swastika on my tat
Smoking tropical crack
I pave way in her rap
Get weight-gained, get racks
Talking shit in my tenants
All my turf charging these tenants
I been broke before
Beating yoke with broken antennas

[Outro]

Gats under my Gucci belt
Tats all on my arm
Sliding up her ocean drive
Coming down like, "Uhhhn"
Sliding up her ocean drive
Coming down like, "Uhhhn"

Gats under my Gucci belt
Gats under my Gucci belt
Tats all on my arm
Sliding up her ocean drive
Coming down like, "Uhhhn"

Bogota bitch, I told you
I'm bogota rich, ah ha yeah
Nigga, Don Adolph, Logan
Hail Logan! Hahaha
