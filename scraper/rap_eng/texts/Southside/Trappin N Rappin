[Hook]
Trapping and I'm rapping 'till I go fed
I told her clap that ass shawty go ahead
Trapping and I'm rapping 'till I go fed
I told her clap that ass shawty go ahead
Diamond Rollie cost an Audi
I came to fuck up the party
I came with lean, gas and molly
Xannies they all in my body
Trapping and I'm rapping 'till I go fed
I told her clap that ass shawty go ahead

[Verse 1]
I should be throwing on purple
I swear to god they gon' murk you
My youngin' made 300 racks
Just in 1 month
How much you get in the front?
Hit after hit and you puntin'
I'm quarterback and you puntin'
Young nigga yo check is nothing
She say she love you, she frontin'
She not gon' fuck you for nothing
Shawty out here hustling
She can't come home with nothing
You gon' do what you bluffin'
My flag red yeah it's bleeding nigga
I put pounds in the Beamer nigga
She gon' drive it up the interstate
Trap houses, I got real estate
More money than a killer case
40 pointers in my Rollie face
No capitals, you got lower case
Trap rolling like roller skates
That work [?]
J's line up like release dates
Looked at the judge tell 'em to his face

[Hook]
Trapping and I'm rapping 'till I go fed
I told her clap that ass shawty go ahead
Trapping and I'm rapping 'till I go fed
I told her clap that ass shawty go ahead
Diamond Rollie cost an Audi
I came to fuck up the party
I came with lean, gas and molly
Xannies they all in my body
Trapping and I'm rapping 'till I go fed
I told her clap that ass shawty go ahead

[Verse 2]
I can't give a shit, she gotta work for it
Big blue 100's told her twerk for it
Change the situation now she on vacation
Diamonds black and white, call it segregation
Head super good, call it education
I'm on percocets, that's my medication
High as fuck feel like I'm levitating
Off a couple M's bitch my life's amazing
For my niggas [juggin' Ronald Raegen]
You just rapping pussy, niggas hibernating
Pockets stuffed up with them big heads
Rap and trap 'till I go fed
Got pure white for the coke heads
Cookie kush for the weed heads
Playing with a check, rich recess
Gettin' carwashes by the dope heads
Flocka
