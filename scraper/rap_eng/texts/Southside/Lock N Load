[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
My little nigga trapped out
All he wanna do is rob and hit licks, uh
He like bruh, I don't rap, I don't got no features
I don't get paid for no downloads
Niggas gotta lay it down, lock and load
Niggas gotta lay it down, lock and load
Niggas gotta lay it down, lock and load
Niggas gotta lay it down, down, uh

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Thugged out, trapped out, playing with a check
Waka Flocka Flame, I'll die for my respect
They ign'ant and they skitzo', they gon' die for their set
Bricksquad Monopoly, send them goonie's at your neck
Put your dick in the dirt, put a whole in your head
I'll ride on your pussy ass even if your flag red
Lay it down, lay it down, put that forty in your face
Lay it down, lay it down, put that four-four in your face
Niggas cutthroat 'round my way
Kicking doors, stealing things 'round my way
Selling pills, molly's and yay'
You a freebie, you can die any day
If I say go and get them, got them bands on his head
My young niggas, they gon' get him, golden rule: don't turn Fed
Squad!

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 2: Bambino Gold]
Rich Chris, ain't nothing but the hood safe
Get your skull shot off for an ounce of 'caine
Get your whole head bust for wearing a diamond ring
Young niggas don't give a fuck, they like taking things
I'm the young boss that you don't wanna tick off
Have them youngin's jump on you like criss cross
Have you leaving out the club, looking pitiful
Cause you done get your ass jugged out them Louis shoes
My young nigga said "Bambino, it's a go"
We don't give a fuck no more, we raping hoes
They say you got them bricks and you on the mound
My youngin's kick your door in and check your trap

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 3: Cartel MGM]
All I want to do is trap, I'm trying to bring that money back
Waka, he be kicking doors, Cartel supply the trap
Welcome to mi casa, that's what it says on my doormat
Ring the doorbell, if you want to see them packs
Partner in the kitchen, got a partner in the back
My partner's down to bust shit, so tell me what you want to do
Trying to bag the work up, but you can get bagged up too
I know you a bitch, I see right through you
I keep a burner every time I come through
My circle filled with plugs, that's just what bosses do
Pockets on racks and my diamonds on igloo
You do what you can, but I do what I want to do
