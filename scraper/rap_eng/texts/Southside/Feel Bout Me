[Verse 1]
Light the block up like Times Square
You a killer, who the fuck care
Riverdale, we in here
That fuck touched my underwear
What come around goes around
Don't pop shit, just gun rounds
[?] blood hounds
Cook a brick, hey bust a pound
[?] in the ground
One phone call get your dome cold
Like TI boy I ball
I'm rich and black, hey fuck the law
I'm too real, can't G check
Worldwide get respect
You got [?] then you a reject
Elm Street, my G set
Suwoo to the P gang
Kept it real, stuck to the code
Under presser I won't fold
Lock and load til the block explode
Young nigga, my chopper old
Bust down it's all gold
Young nigga, my chopper old
Bust down rolie it's all gold

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
