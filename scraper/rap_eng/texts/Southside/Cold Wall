[Intro]
Why you call me?
Why you call?..
Baby, what you want?
I said I'm sorry, I mean I'm sorry
For what I've done

[Chorus]
But bae it's over
We're not together
Our love is gone
So please don't text me
And please don't call me anymore

[Verse 1]
We've used to argue on some shit
That I still can't explain
We've never appreciated moments and love we shared
I know I hurt you baby
Sometimes I was lame
And you still can't realize our love won't be the same

I gave you everything you wanted
There's nothing left
I bought some shit you can't afford
(You)Gotta thank for that

I knew you got a nigga
Hoe I don't care
He was nothing like me
But you was still complaining

I was focused on making money, building life for us
All you shoulda do was waiting for me and trust
I don't take our time for granted baby we were nice
Drinking too much molly closing my eyes

[Chorus]
But bae it's over
We're not together
Our love is gone
So please don't text me
And please don't call me anymore

[Verse 2]
I know you wanted a ring but I wasn't ready
When you're in front of me girl always hold steady
I passed on lean like Tom Brady
Just to spend some time with you, my lady

Time flies now I gotta ignore you
I don't wanna see you so bae please don't call me
I should never cheat on you
Now it's like you owe me
I know you wanna see me going back to old me

But I feel like it's perfect time to move on
And you're still on a gram tapping on your phone
Forgive me bae I know I did you wrong
Now after all the shit that happened I'm VLONE

[Chorus]
But bae it's over
We're not together
Our love is gone
So please don't text me
And please don't call me anymore

[Verse 3]
I told you baby stop snorting
Wake up shawty
I was trapping on the block to get you life you wanted
"Hard work pays off"- yeah that's what they say
Took my day off just to ease my mind and pray

Pulling out of the back of the Bach
My life's amazing without you
I still counting up stacks
I play wide receiver cause I'm receiving the cash
And these models around me they wanna give me some smash

You're still with your loser
And I ain't gonna lose it
I hopped out of Wraith
Balenciaga shoes on
Real life, gotta prove em
My wrist Franck muller
More life for my family
Shoutout Royal Gang movement

[Chorus]
But bae it's over
We're not together
Our love is gone
So please don't text me
And please don't call me anymore

[Verse 4]
Now baby tell me if u love me,please show me
I don't really miss you but I want you
Your body is like a magnet, your soul my delight
Your heart my treasure, your love my pleasure
You're so hot I want undress you

I wanna squeeze you, wanna kiss you
Girl I got amnesia I got no reason
Why should I leave you, it's our season
My mind on acids, I count my blessings
You stole my heart baby stop finessing me
