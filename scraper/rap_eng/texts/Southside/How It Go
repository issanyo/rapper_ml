[Intro]
A lot of niggas can't handle the truth. They don't wanna deal with they situations in life. They wanna blame everybody else for they downfall and shit. You know how that shit go man

[Chorus]
You know how it go, you know how it go
Niggas say you changed, you know how it go
They gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go
They gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go
You know how it go, you know how it go
They gon' sell they soul for the price of gold
They get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold
You already know, you know how it go

[Verse 1]
They love you when you down, they hate you when you up
Especially when you can't always help them up
Don't give out no hand outs cause' that'll mess em' up
After a while, you gon' find yourself catching up
Pay attention to the ones that imitate ya
Never fear one that try to intimidate ya
Self preservation, that's the first law of nature
They can't get none of your paper they assassinate ya
It's just a vicious cycle, look what they did to Michael
Look what they did to Martin Luther, nigga they a shoot ya
Look what they did to Malcolm X don't wanna be your idol
Just don't go against the grain this shit is suicidal

[Chorus]
You know how it go, you know how it go
Niggas say you changed, you know how it go
They gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go
They gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go
You know how it go, you know how it go
They gon' sell they soul for the price of gold
They get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold
You already know, you know how it go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, so I still keep that kush lit
Real nigga, I still be on that hood shit
And I'm still sippin that good shit
Still be gettin' that money give me one reason I should quit (hell nah)
I might boss up and get mo' dough
Feeling presidential so I'm ridin' round' in that four door
Lookin' like a lick you get a couple of racks on my photo
If that bag there, then there ain't nowhere that I won't go
But everything ain't what it seem, you know what I mean
Just cause' niggas always on the scene don't mean they with the team
It started with a dream, wish you could see what I seen
Wish that I could go diamond and put it in my ring

[Chorus]
You know how it go, you know how it go
Niggas say you changed, you know how it go
They gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go
They gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go
You know how it go, you know how it go
They gon' sell they soul for the price of gold
They get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold
You already know, you know how it go

[Verse 3]
Last of my kind, ain't no mo' niggas like me
Say my name around your bitch she get over excited
Give me head with no hands, hoe you know how I like it
I keep a tool with some rubbers, bitch I'm strapped like I'm ISIS
I know niggas in they feelings, meanwhile I'm in these millions
Gotta GPS my house, ain't been home in a minute
Ain't been home in like forever, I been getting to the cash
Sendin' Kate to touch the stage, pussy nigga do the math
My fingers, they itchin' for that paper like a rash
Silly bitches call me broke, must be tryna make me laugh
Niggas say I changed, if I did, why you mad?
Niggas still ain't bout' they paper gotta leave em' in the past

[Chorus]
You know how it go, you know how it go
Niggas say you changed, you know how it go
They gon' switch up for the fame, you know how it go
They gon' throw dirt on yo name, you know how it go
You know how it go, you know how it go
They gon' sell they soul for the price of gold
They get caught up in the jam, you know they gon' fold
You already know, you know how it go

(Outro: Juicy J & DJ Blak)
You know how it go, you know how it go
Niggas don't be wantin' you to [?] shit out here man. You know the fucked up part about it? They be madder than a mother fucker man. Don't you post nothin' on Instagram or nothing, oh they really gon' get mad. Niggas have a fit, niggas be wantin' to kill they selves. Man fuck em'. Keep smokin
Juicy said "aye Blak! Let's go to a foreign country some shit we ain't never been before"
I said "iight man let's gas up the jet. Where you wanna go?"
He said "man let's go to Sri Lanka"
I said "cool man let's go"
Juicy J, DJ Blak nigga fix your face
