[Verse]
The trap, I can go back any minute
Henny Privilege, got me lookin' at these bitches really different
Shot a video in the 30's, guess he really crippin'
Never penny pitchin', the Henny gone then we Remy sippin'
Hard to kill, sober brought painkillers on any mission
Paranoia ready, Miami just to let Diddy listen
Back and forth about who the hottest, got the whole city riffin'
I ain't never laced foamposites I wore my penny's different
Gave my couso life so fuck it, I take a million visits
Diamond district, I left with water now I got women kissin'
Follow niggas right where they livin', nothing about me timid
Foreign drop, dash 2 20 moving a mile a minute
Mama disappointed with my mugshot I was smilin' in it
We blessed on the Benz plates, King Khaled it
Dirty project kids and A-List parties, we be wildin' in it
Steak medium well, mashed potatoes and salmon with it
True father won't even cop it unless his child can get it
Talking my shit, walking up Lennox just cause Malcolm did it
Snoop said no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm in it
These niggas loud and they losin' and I'm in silence winnin'
Percocet, I'm still poppin' percocet
If I punch 'em they gon' sue me they ain't even worth the threat
Ambidextrous drive with my right, I can work the left
I ain't learned shit in college in the streets I learned finesse
Earn respect, learned that way before I ever earned a check
Feel like Nino, big cuban right over the turtleneck
Not concerned with what you roll with, my backwoods burn the best
Stuntin' on your chest, speak on it only bitches got breast my nigga
She make the dick disappear, I call that magic
Louis Vutton all of my fabric, catch me in traffic
Where I'm from dead by 21 that was the average
I'm 28 coolin' try not to repeat the madness
Stashed the work in my jacket
Feet was hurtin' from calice, every day eatin' at palace
Got some freaks at the Radison, fall asleep if they chattin'
Potential that the streets can't imagine, I came from baggin'
Got a thing for them trucks, got the Rover I want the Wagen
And I ain't steppin' in that club until I get the backend
She tried to parallel park the Ferrari, hard to back in
Westside connection, ice cubes plus a Mac-10
Call me anything what you want, but broke or a bad friend
I'm a fucking cash cow, I bring a lotta cash in
I really made my dad smile, reason that nigga braggin'
I ain't have to ask him, me broke that's past tense
Shot out to my landlord, know I was late with mad rent
You blew settlement money, now you wonderin' where the cash went
30 plus ain't nothing in your pockets but mad lint
Never made nothing out yourself, I know your dad's sick
Mask off, mask on I hope this mask fit
Way too many miles on that pussy, mami got bad grip
Harlem taught me to cop a new car after you crashed whips
Look at Trump if you wonder the power that the cash get's
