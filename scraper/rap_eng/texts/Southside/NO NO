[Chorus]
You ain't got no drip, that's a no no (you don't)
Come get your girl, she want a kiss, oh no, no, no, no (no)
Yeah, you ain't got no sauce, that's a no no (sauce)
Y-y-you ain't got no drip, that's a no no (no)
That's a no no (no), you already know, know (know)
That's a no no (no), oh, no, no, no (no)
That's a no no (no), you already know, know (know)
That's a no no (no), oh, no, no, no (no)

[Verse 1]
Balcony, I don't got a backyard (backyard)
But I got a Frenchie in my Goyard (I do)
Louis V Supreme, freshest in my school (yeah)
[?] Baby Sizzle, 808 my crew (yup)
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, pull up in that coupe ('Rari)
Your daughter like me 'cause I'm fresher than her daddy (yup)
Eight years old and she call me "Big Daddy" (I am)
I bought Pizza Hut for the whole third grade (that's true)
You wearin' fake Yeezys, I got Balenciagas on (what?)
I told mama I'm tryna bring Blue Carter home (what?)
Yeah, Baby Sizzle at his best
And northwest, Trap Ye my daddy
Your girlfriend aggy, Rolex for [?]
Rolex for [?], Rolex for Journey (ayy)
Rolex for mama, my family richer (ayy)
Than your broke family (ayy)

[Chorus]
You ain't got no drip, that's a no no (you don't)
Come get your girl, she want a kiss, oh no, no, no, no (no)
Yeah, you ain't got no sauce, that's a no no (sauce)
Y-y-you ain't got no drip, that's a no no (no)
That's a no no (no), you already know, know (know)
That's a no no (no), oh, no, no, no (no)
That's a no no (no), you already know, know (know)
That's a no no (no), oh, no, no, no (no)

[Verse 2]
Recess, I'm too flexed, A+ on my tests
A+ when I test, standin' on top of my desk
Take your girlfriend shoppin', her homegirl shoppin'
Baby Sizzle poppin', [?] got it poppin' (yeah)
Next year I'ma turn up, call it pep rally (what?)
The type of drip to make your mama leave your step daddy (huh?)
All white [?] 'bout to take another trip
Too much flavor, too much drip, [?]
Another photo, no drip, that's a no no
No sauce, that's a no no, no flavor, a no no
Another photo, no drip, that's a no no
No sauce, that's a no no, no flavor, a no no

[Chorus]
You ain't got no drip, that's a no no (you don't)
Come get your girl, she want a kiss, oh no, no, no, no (no)
Yeah, you ain't got no sauce, that's a no no (sauce)
Y-y-you ain't got no drip, that's a no no (no)
That's a no no (no), you already know, know (know)
That's a no no (no), oh, no, no, no (no)
That's a no no (no), you already know, know (know)
That's a no no (no), oh, no, no, no (no)
