Zoo'd Cryst. at Benihana's
Stop flexin
You be in a Honda
Squad in the king
The giant will spend about a hundred
They got that long bread
You got that short caine
Only thing i miss is money and my court date
Feel sick
Need a checkup nigga
I can't spend it all
Cuz my check a nigga
Dumpin the ball
Better check up nigga
I don't need no stress
My respect up nigga
I'm up early in the morning
Get my cab before the cereal
Said I gotta eat
But I ain't talking cafeteria
Imperial
Killa cam in the cup
Southside beat with the whammie in tha trunk
Bitches in the back
Got my man's in the front
Baseball bat's 3 gram 1 hun
This ain't your ordinary pistol
Semi with the drums
Flocka smoke like he got a chimney in his lungs
------------------------------------------
They call me inky, inky
Write on me, write on me call me
Couple ounces of that purple got that Sprite on me (X4)

And a cup of paint

Tell em write on me
No limit to my ink
