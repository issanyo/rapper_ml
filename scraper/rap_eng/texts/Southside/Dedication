[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
If it wasn’t for Wayne, it wouldn’t be
A lot of dudes in the game, including me
We was smoking that gas in ’03
Was gon’ sell a few bags to Lil Fee
Couple years removed from HBs
Tatted lyrics from Jigga to Jay-Z
I went to Eastover before Katrina
Remember going to Magic riding in my Beamer
And this was way before FEMA, and you was rappin’ and singin’
And I was slanging the Ps and smoking nigga like Newport
Comin up off of Too Short, my underwear was my hoop shorts
And then I went on tour and recorded songs on your tour bus
And that was ’08
That’s the first time I met Drake
When I hit your cup with that drank
Had a nigga stomach like, "Wait, wait wait, wait", mm

[Hook]
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg

[Verse 2]
You relocated to MIA
You told me, "Shawty this where I stay"
I came down to pay a visit
You told me Zoe Pound and them was trippin'
And you, you wasn’t dippin’
Had the M-16 and with the extra clip, ready to act ignorant
Ridin’ off in the Phantom and Mr. G he was driving
Pumpin’ that Playaz Circle, you told me that we was riding
I told you that I was rappin’, told you I wasn’t writing
You said Luda was foolish because he wasn’t excited
That was way before Tyga, I saw Nicki with Gucci
You said, "You can make a million rappin' 'bout some pussy
I did", T, Fuke, Marley Marl, shining like Armor Oil
You can ask Mack, I was YM ‘fore all of y’all
Stunna said I reminded him of Johnny
In this world you either selling or you buying

[Hook]
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg

[Verse 3]
You tatted your face and changed the culture
You screamed "Suu whoop" and them gangstas loved you
You bought a Bugatti so you can flex
And most of the bad bitches your ex
Ride 'til the wheels fall off and they got wobbly
"Duffle Bag" video, we shot that bitch on Godby
You was holding a sty-ry, I had more gold than a pirate
They said it ain’t about stylin’, what they tryna kick knowledge?
Duffle Bag Boys, yeah I can’t forget Dolla
And going to get the money is some words that I follow
I swallowed my pride, smoking endo outside
Straight from ColleGrove, I’m reporting live

[Hook]
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
That my dawg, uhh, that my dawg
That my dawg, yeah, that my dawg
