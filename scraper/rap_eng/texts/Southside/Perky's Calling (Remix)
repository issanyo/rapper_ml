[Intro]
I decided to get a piece of this
On track for some hoes my nigga
Or at least make dough my nigga

[Verse 1]
All you little niggas ain't shit, you bullshit
And your bitch ain't even bad man, she just a bitch
You ain't even make no money yeah and I'm fucking rich
They label me an asshole and I know I is
So shut the fuck up hoe and suck this dick
I'm busy with my fans taking pics
Why you sleeping outside for some kicks?
If they ain't got 'em when I want 'em, than that's it
But I fuck the chick behind the register I'm lit
I get her into shows with her friends (Thanks Z!)
I even let 'em ride in the Benz
Now they backstage, mixing up the Henny
I'm going Godmode, Yeah I know
I'm on a whole nother level then before
I can pin the tail with my eyes closed
You can take this L I tied it in a bow
I keep it cool, I keep it real
I ain't trynna end up in jail
Call me if you needa post bail
If you my nigga, you my nigga till in Hell
I gotta call my ma and let her know
That her babyboy rolling round the dough
If the bills need paying lemme know
If my nieces need clothes lemme know
I'm grown up now lemme know (2x)
I'm doing what the fuck I am supposed to
So smile for the camera here I go

PreHISTORIC
Imma fuck it up my nigga
Imma switch the game, make it mine my nigga
Imma smoke weed til I die my nigga
I'm high my nigga

Fuck off
