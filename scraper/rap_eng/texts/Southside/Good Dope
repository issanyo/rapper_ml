[Verse 1]
Ballin like a bitch
Hoe you know I been a savage
Bitch, im known to cop a drop
Hoe im known to fuck a maggot aye
Sizzle man the god, five kids i come with baggage, aye
I been stackin large, stacking large I got cabbage
Aye(x4)
30 clips and pole action, hey
Yea, yea, yea
And my cousin (?)
Bitch I build my own status, yea
Make them millions, I do magic, woah woah
Bitch you like to talk a lot, I'm the one they talk about
We don't wanna talk it out
Parking lot dead from the 'rarri hoe I chalked it out
Left you dead, hoe I chalked it out

[Hook]
Ball game jumping, too much swear I'm flexin' hoe
I just bought a ZO-6
Just so I can wreck it hoe
Down with the poppin shit, just know that I'm connected, hoe
Hating nigga, hating bitch, you 'bout to miss your blessing hoe
Flexing ass nigga poppin' know he on the metro
Flexing ass bitch, flying even though he don't got no petrol
I've been killing shawty, think it's time for you to let go
Shawty been the shit, I been on drugs, I'm on the good dope

[Verse 2]
Proposition for you niggas, give us hell we let you live
Niggas chasing bitches, 30 bottles (?)
January 2017, bitch I made a mill
I was in a 'rarri, lost the top, screaming fuck a deal
(Talk x2)
Please don't talk to me bitch
Act the same way you acting when you was off on me, bitch
Hoe this fully got you hatin, got you salty and shit
Know I fucked that nigga bitch, and he ain't called me shit
Nigga worth a million dollars hit his hoe and his shit
Really started from the bottom, got 'em mad that I'm rich
Niggas say they want them problems, let them young niggas blitz
I'm on percys with them addies but that molly don't mix

[Hook]
Yeah
Ball game jumping, too much swear I'm flexin' hoe
I just bought a ZO-6
Just so I can wreck it hoe
Down with the poppin shit, just know that I'm connected, hoe
Hating nigga, hating bitch, you 'bout to miss your blessing hoe
Flexing ass nigga poppin' know he on the metro
Flexing ass bitch, flying even though he don't got no petrol
I've been killing shawty, think it's time for you to let go
Shawty been the shit, I been on drugs, I'm on the good dope
