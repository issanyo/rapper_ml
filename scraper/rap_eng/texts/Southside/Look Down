[Intro]
Z Money
You know how i'm comin' nigga
Four E.P
All my rich niggas stand up
On the interstate, any day
How i'm different paid (different paid)
On another day, that's another day (another way)
Sellin' dope today (out the way)

[Verse]
On the interstate, like different state
Gettin' new different cake, any way
Fuck what he gotta say, he broke anyway
E-way
I be in the trap, I get ten K a day
I'm gettin' paid
No I cannot lose, that's the hater way
I bring ten, bricks of heroin to come and sell a day
What you gotta' say
We pull up and shoot ya in ya face
And we fightin' the case
We got guap so we gon' beat the case
Keep them lawyers paid
I'm in the streets, gotta' keep them lawyers paid
Send my shorties to spray
Hit yo' block and come destroy yo' day
Didn't even pay 'em eight
They was with me and I made forty K
That's the loyal way
Kill a nigga for my brother way
Use to board the gate
Cook it, it's gon' come back more than great
I need to snort a eight
He need to snort, I come and take the ticks
I sold some dope today
Bitch i'm hustlin' my house gettin' paid
What ya daughter say
She love me because I ain't into fake
These niggas in the way
In they feeling's, I don't care 'bout feeling's
Trappin'
I don't care 'bout, drug, dealin', out the public buildin'
Make a killin'
Swear I love this feelin', I could make a billion
Thug, livin'
Pleased to meet my semi, not too fuckin' friendly
Niggas dissin'
Heard these niggas dissin', y'all gon' find 'em fishin'
Dope man in my city
Ain't gon' kill you, but I sent the killers
Cut a nigga off
It be so crazy, how they come back weirdly
My guap to the ceilin'
I ain't worried, 'bout no nigga feeling's
Bitch I take the fifty
I ain't worried, 'bout no nigga pennies
Trap in front of Denny's
Got me takin' trips inside of Lennox
Man they're bunch of cameras
You can see what I be fuckin' handlin'
All my traps abandoned
Work three months, and then we fuckin' vanish
Young nigga went cappin'
To a trap house to a trapped out mansion
Cookin' dope so fast
Was on my knee's with pans, and now i'm dancin'
Main thing is don't panic
My FN is my fan, don't make me fan it
This beat is some damage
When I heard it, I start damage plannin'
I don't think i'm landin', I'm so high up on another planet (I)
Won't see me, five a gram
If you want it, you can meet my manage'
But that's for the ten
For the great, I need eighty a gram
These bitches, they'll fuck on ya best man, if they had a chance
Said she want a nigga with the bands, nigga who the man

[Outro]
I can't even look down on her (bitch)
I can't even look down on her (dirty bitch)
I can't even look down on her (slutty bitch)
I can't even look down on her (dirty bitch)
I can't even look down on her (naw)
I can't even look down on her (yah)
I can't even look down on her (yah yah)
I can't even look down on her (slutty bitch)
I can't even look down on her (yah)
Down on her
Can't even look down on her
I can't even look down on her
