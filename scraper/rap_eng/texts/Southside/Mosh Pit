[Hook x4]
Move around, push the crowd
Cause' it's going down
Like (?) we gon' jump around
My Clique(2 counts)
Mosh Pit(2 counts)
All we Do is Fight
We don't pop shit(2 counts)

[Verse 1: Wooh Da Kid]
New Hip Hop
We smokin' out the ziplock
And all my niggas, push up fingaz and just grip Glock
You shoulda stayed down
When they had you laid down
Now, bullets moon walking at'cha like James Brown
Tear drops on your face don't make you a killah
Banana clips in the "K" when I spray I go gorilla
Wooh Da Kid, thats my nickname, im wild as fuck
Wooh Da King, keep a Glock
So dont push ya luck
I move around, and push the crowd, when its crunch time
And eat a nigga food quick when it's lunch time
Left Hand paralyzed
Right hand, deaf
And Every (?) like linguini to a chef

[Hook x2]
Move around, push the crowd
Cause' it's going down
Like (?) we gon' jump around
My Clique(2 counts)
Mosh Pit(2 counts)
All we Do is Fight
We don't pop shit(2 counts)

[Verse 2: Nino Cahoots]
They don't know Nino
But Nino keep that steele, nigga
Cahoots wit tha green flag
Ask'em what the deal, nigga?
74, until the world blow
A buncha ill niggas
A goon to a goblin? wait til' that goblin meet a real nigga
Niggas tried ta take off
Rolling feel like my face off
Oh so you wanna face off? Run up, I'll knock yo face off
A buncha gangsta' people wit me, plus I got amigo wit me
Bangin' in yo mosh pit, black Flag, B.O.S. shit
Different colored bandana's you'd think the Ninja Turtles here
All that bucking in the club patna', get you murdered here
Hundred niggas strong bandana's in every pocket
Thung yo block, thug yo set, my nigga was poppin'

[Hook x2]
Move around, push the crowd
Cause' it's going down
Like (?) we gon' jump around
My Clique(2 counts)
Mosh Pit(2 counts)
All we Do is Fight
We don't pop shit(2 counts)

[Verse 3: YG Hootie]
New Chuck Tee's, turn tha club into a mosh pit
We gon riot in bitch, on some ride or die shit
I been popin', I been thinking, I been on some profit
Turn psycho, on my enemies I miss my patna's!
Cross the kid, we gon jump around like Kriss/Kross
All on yo face! Left a star from my chuck star
Tie a flag round my face, dont wanna see the reaper
Don't got my strap up in the club?
Hit you wit my sleeper
Move around, move around
It's YG Hoo Tha Clown
My clique so deep
Put you to sleep, like a root canal
We on some "G" shit
Real Mob shit
Get slapped, bitch, for steppin' in my mosh pit
