[Chorus]
Came a long way from the bottom to the top
Look at what we had, look at what we got
That whip ain't park itself in the driveway
Skrrt skrrt, hit the gas, that bitch sideways
Came a long way, from the bottom to the top
Look at what we had, look at what we got
That chain ain't hang itself, on my neck
That watch ain't wrap itself, 'round my wrist

[Verse 1]
I'm from the Southside like Sizzle is
And wherever I go, just know that pistol is
All my bitches bad like Crystal is
Playing spin the bottle, kissing pussy lips
Bags in here, passing gas in here, excuse me
We blowing loud, y'all smoke mid, pootin'
We having paper, better get your ho 'cause she choosing
Jaw game crazy, she on my dick, 'bout to lose it
We boolin' it, and coolin' it, at the same time
I got Bloods with me, got Crips with me, on the same line
You got a problem with it, you thought about it, then change mind
'Cause if one swing then we all swing at the same time, damn

[Chorus]
Came a long way from the bottom to the top
Look at what we had, look at what we got
That whip ain't park itself in the driveway
Skrrt skrrt, hit the gas, that bitch sideways
Came a long way, from the bottom to the top
Look at what we had, look at what we got
That chain ain't hang itself, on my neck
That watch ain't wrap itself, 'round my wrist

[Verse 2]
Just broke the money counter now I'm thumbing through it
Zero zero zero, add a comma to it
Zero zero, comma doin' numbers, understood
I'm the same fat broke nigga from the hood
I remember eating canned goods, TV dinners
Now when I'm in the restaurant I want the menu
Need my money in my hand 'fore I hit the venue
Crank the stage, bust the speaker (who?), me and TM
Leave the parking lot, all you hear is skrrt
On the tour bus, bitches lifting up they skirt
When I leave the booth, get a hearse
RIP, DOA, I just killed the verse

[Chorus]
Came a long way from the bottom to the top
Look at what we had, look at what we got
That whip ain't park itself in the driveway
Skrrt skrrt, hit the gas, that bitch sideways
Came a long way, from the bottom to the top
Look at what we had, look at what we got
That chain ain't hang itself, on my neck
That watch ain't wrap itself, 'round my wrist

[Outro]
Came a long way from the bottom to the top
Look at what we had, look at what we got
That whip ain't park itself in the driveway
Skrrt skrrt, hit the gas, that bitch sideways
