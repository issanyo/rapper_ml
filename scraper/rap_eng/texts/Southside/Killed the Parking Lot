Call the police (3x)
I just killed the parking lot
Call the police (3x)
I just killed the parking lot
Call the police (3x)
I just killed the parking lot
Cut my top, rock ice, pop bottles
This my life, Brick Squad Monopoly

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
They think I'm from Philly how I'm rapping off the temple
Long hair bad bitch with Lauren London dimples
Me and West Side Daddy, 2 in 2 fly Caddies
Hopped out, all black Bally's, man they love me out in Cali
Think they love my lingo, got a big ego
Waka Flocka Flame, I'm one rich-ass negro
Girls love my steelo, at my shows they be yellin'
After the show, tour bus, I be bustin'
Killin', drillin' all them bad bitches
Blair, pass the blunt, I'm trying to get fucked up
Cartier Kitten, that's my little sister
Kodak, take a picture, man I love that little nigga
Unh!

[Verse 2: Blair Maxberry]
In the car, my girl already know
To let the windows up cause we finna smoke
Granddaddy purp all down her throat
She take me to my truck and it's bigger than a boat
I pull up in the club, valet move the ropes
My grill laughing at 'em while my rims telling jokes
But I'm chilling in the truck just continuing to smoke
With a lap full of weave cause now I'm in her throat
But now she don't get to hit the blunt no mo'
And I don't even wanna go in no mo'
Cause I'm already killing, I can't sin no mo'
Yeah, call the police, yeah, call the po-po

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 3: P. Smurf]
P. Smurf, I go hard in the paint
Like my bitch car keys when she catch me cheatin'
And every time she catch me, my neck be blingin'
Niggas acting like they deaf so my Tec be screamin'
I'm so hot, I gotta take a bath in cold water
I sure gotta whole lotta beat up in my low rider
Cali nigga, more bitches in Miami than Flo-Rida
I done had to holler at your bitch nigga, my flow got her
West Side Daddy go hard on a bitch nigga
When I pick her up, she better have her grip with her
Old school Chevy paint that bitch Coca-Cola
White leather seats feel like I'm sitting on a sofa

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Call the police (3x)
I just killed the parking lot
Call the police (3x)
I just killed the parking lot
Call the police (3x)
Flocka! Waka! Flocka! Waka! Yuh!
Cut my top, rock ice, pop bottles
This my life, Brick Squad Monopoly
