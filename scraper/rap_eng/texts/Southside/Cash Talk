[Verse 1]
Pull up in the Bentley (skrt)
Hop out with your missy
I'm blowing her kisses
She blow on my dickie
Pour in that pussy
She douche it with tissue
I can go slow like I'm old
I can go fast like a fiddle
Hop in the Bentley, 20 inches in up under me (yea, racks)
I'm a big dawg, I got real red black diamonds, stingray, no bumble bee (skrt!?)
I'mma spend racks on the red bottoms for all the people under me
When I leave outta the club I feel high cause the way they wanted me
Abra cadabra I turn up on these bastards (Turn up)
My jewelry wet, baby, bring me some napkins (Turn up)
I don't like cameras but feel my action
My green, I'mma poke it bitch, I'mma cactus
Hey

[Verse 2]
Pull up in the hearse, your head I'mma burst
I slow down your trap, Young Thugga the curse
I'm serving the patients, get head from the nurse
I put in that work, I throw what you worth
No basket, I'm balling - she calling
I pull up with Gators and we take your water
Like a dolphin
The Lord don't know what to do with me
I'm in Memphis with Boo Dirty nigga ten-a-key (OG)
Dirty nigga, throw him that DOA
Chop peso, peso, pays what more than yay
You don't sit down in the spot nigga, we gonna shoot up the place
Pop, cop, copping Maseratis, they like oh Kemosabe
Hey
