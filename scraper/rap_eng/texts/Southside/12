[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Brick Squad Monopoly, that's my company
Bitch, I'm buying all the property in Clayco
Niggas' mommas working for Waka Flocka
Niggas' daddies working for Waka Flocka
Snakes in the grass
I cut it
Shit, he might be a cop
Is he wired?

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I open my eyes, I don't trust these niggas
I swear to God they 12
I open my eyes, I don't trust these niggas
I swear to God they 12
They got wires in they belts, they got wires in they hats
They got wires in they shirts, man I swear to God they 12
I don't trust these niggas
I can't trust ya'll niggas
Man, y'all talking like bitches

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Pillow talking to the strippers
Man, y'all talking like bitches
Pillow talking to these freaks
Got my ears to the street in a heartbeat
This a Southside beat, so they feeling that
Hundred round clip, bet you feel all that
Eat that nigga
Take that nigga
Brick Squad Monopoly, that's my company
Bitch, I'm buying all the property in Clayco
Niggas' mommas working for Waka Flocka
Niggas' daddies working for Waka Flocka
Red dope man's, 505 Levis
Chinese eyes, been thugging since knee high
You need about three guys
All ya'll fake, I swear to God ya'll three lies
And ya'll live about three lives
I can see it in your eyes, real nigga disguise
I despise you bastards
Can't wait to see your caskets

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 2: YG Hootie]
They call me YG, I'mma need about three wives
Shut your hood down, you can't even reply
Call that a direct message
Do you follow me? These snitches got me restless
No necklace, just pants, ho
I'm a real nigga, can't play me like no banjo
Twenty bands, just dance, ho
Flocka with me, no hands, ho
And you know me I'm from 142
Love to rock red, other niggas rock blue
Twenty on my wrist, thirty in my Trues
Two line nigga in a two door coupe
Niggas be snitching, hands out too
Blast your ass, that's what I gotta do
Like Christmas, shots to a bitch nigga's kidneys

[Hook]
