(Intro)
Xan Quilt
I'm pouring up right now nigga
Like for real, for real tho
Bandz on me right now nigga

(Hook)
Always, Always, Always OK
Always keep them bandz 'cause you know I never had shit Always keep a bad bitch, my life is well established
Always (x4)
OK I always keep it with me 'cause the shit could get tragic
Always pouring pints I told my plug I gotta have it
Always (x4)
Always keep them bandz 'cause you know I never had shit Always keep a bad bitch, my life is well established
Always (x4)
OK I always keep it with me 'cause the shit could get tragic Always pouring pints I told my plug I gotta have it

(Verse 1)
Always fuck 'em on the first night so pussy don't excite me
I never called her back, she told her homegirl she don't like me I told 'em both "Let's have a threesome, pop some molly, let's get feisty"
I don't sip no alcohol, promethazine and Sprite me
I always keep it on me I heard niggas wanna try me
Nothing but them hunnids he gon shoot then flee the crime scene
Always riding foreign with your bitch so now you mad
I'm always popping tags I can sell yo ass some swag
I'm always counting cash I got a plug you wish you had
All my bitches bad, I fucked your bitch and gave her back
Real bitch getter I bought my Rollies just to dag
Bread winner, ain't no excuses bout my cash
Always (x4)

(Hook)
OK always keep them bandz 'cause you know I never had shit Always keep a bad bitch, my life is well established
Always (x4)
OK I always keep it with me 'cause the shit could get tragic Always pouring pints I told my plug I gotta have it
Always (x4)
Always keep them bandz 'cause you know I never had shit Always keep a bad bitch, my life is well established

(Verse 2)
I always ride with G 'cause I don't trust nobody else
Them niggas doubted me so I went and did it by myself
Spent a thousand on my shoes and spent a thousand on my belt
Young Rich Nigga, spend it up then get it back
Wrap it up and send it just to make a couple racks
If it don't make it in three days that means the Feds snatched the pack
Make sure you throw your phone away and never call this number back
Watch out for them boys and hit me on your other trap
Ain't no first class seats when you riding on a jet
I used to love that 'Rari 'fore I jumped inside the 'Vette
Rich nigga, I seen shit that you ain't never seen before
Wake up in the morning just to get the dough
Fuck her then I gotta go
Always (x4)

(Hook)
OK always keep them bandz 'cause you know I never had shit Always keep a bad bitch, my life is well established
Always (x4)
OK I always keep it with me 'cause the shit could get tragic Always pouring pints I told my plug I gotta have it
Always (x4)
Always keep them bandz 'cause you know I never had shit Always keep a bad bitch, my life is well established
