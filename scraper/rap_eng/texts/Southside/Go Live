[Intro: Caper Boy]
Aye, Wop go grab that Tec, man (oh yeah)
Tray Savage load that FN up (mmmm)
Lil Boss po' that shit up man (bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)
Y'all know we smoke out the 448 (let's get it)
Pourin' out the pints
Aye, Ball bring that money counter out, boy (yeah)
You know what the fuck time it is, man (bang)

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Splashin' on these bitches, yeah that's that sea salt (uh, uh)
All the horses in this foreign I'm like, "Yeehaw!" (skrrt, skrrt)
You know we got that defense, let's play B-ball (bitch)
I think I'm going Ray Charles, I can't see y'all (nah)
Stunna shads on, bitch, these the new capper's (let's get it)
This our shit, nigga, ain't no new trappers
Going forward in the foreign like I can't move backwards (skrrt, skrrt)
You on that fuck shit and take that button it a tap ya
I'm with a white bitch, she a coke head (yeah)
My mentality (let's get it), is get more bread (uh, uh)
I'm in a fast car (skrrt), like it's a snow sled (skrrt)
Stick stickin' out (skrrt), like it's a forehead
Let's get it, bang

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
No Instagram, it can go live
I don't fuck with niggas that play both sides
Ikey smelt the dope when we drove past
Stopped to get some Backwoods and some more gas
Bitch, I'm fresher than a fuckin' Hebrew
If you owe me, I see you (uh, uh)
Walk in Valentino, get a tee or two
Yellow black whip, that's that Pikachu (skrrt, skrrt)

[Verse 2: Ballout]
Ran off on the plug in '09 (gang)
Just fucked a mob wife with a bow tie (gang)
I'm with blood now might as well call 'em slime
All I see is money, I think I'm goin' blind
Hater blockers on my face, I call these specs (specs)
Hit Neimans, we just ran through a check (check)
Grab some F&Ns, we just ran through the Tec's (Tec's)
I just fucked her from the back on a fuckin' jet

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
No Instagram, it can go live
I don't fuck with niggas that play both sides
Ikey smelt the dope when we drove past
Stopped to get some Backwoods and some more gas
Bitch, I'm fresher than a fuckin' Hebrew
If you owe me, I see you (uh, uh)
Walk in Valentino, get a tee or two
Yellow black whip, that's that Pikachu (skrrt, skrrt)

[Bridge : Caper Boy]
Ball bring that money counter out boy
Y'all know what time it is
All we wanna see is red and blue, nigga
Or I should say red and green, nigga
Blood and money, nigga
Uh, uh

[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
Rob a fuck nigga, take his whole shit
Ran off with yo' pack, you a whole bitch
Bitches in the trap, I make them hoes strip
Them hoes don't wanna fuck? I make them hoes dip
I been gettin' money since like '06
Phone boomin', I just moved a whole brick
Got a 100 shot, I shoot at yo' whole clique
Got a 100 shot, I shoot up yo' whole whip
Phone ringin', damn, all this money comin' in
'Member bein' on the block, sellin' 3 for 10
Try to rob shit, I put one up in yo' wig
I don't carry .38, all I tote is SIGs
Let this beef get serious, I'll smoke yo' kids
These niggas ain't did what I done did
'Member runnin' from the cops, had to hop the fence
And you can't hang around, if you ain't poppin' shit

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
No Instagram, it can go live
I don't fuck with niggas that play both sides
Ikey smelt the dope when we drove past
Stopped to get some Backwoods and some more gas
Bitch, I'm fresher than a fuckin' Hebrew
If you owe me, I see you (uh, uh)
Walk in Valentino, get a tee or two
Yellow black whip, that's that Pikachu

[Verse 4: Tadoe]
Boy I'm on that savage shit (what?), stop that rappin' shit
I'll hit yo' block, up then chops, automatic spit (grrah)
Nigga we gon' blast off, fuck it, mask off
Niggas said they wit' it, boy stop it, they look mad soft
In the trap get bags off (let's get it), we got mad salt
Bitch you ain't off molly, nigga (huh), that's some bath salt
Try to rob a back off, get you mad offed
Bitch I get that gaup like a cash crow (ffff, beep)

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
No Instagram, it can go live
I don't fuck with niggas that play both sides
Ikey smelt the dope when we drove past
Stopped to get some Backwoods and some more gas
