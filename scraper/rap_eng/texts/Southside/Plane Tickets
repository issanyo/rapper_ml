Wavy off that drank Frenchy Montana

Blunt after blunt shot after shot
If he talking money nigga I got a lot
Bitches do what I say nigga I got robots
Got a party on the ocean nigga I got a yacht

Niggas throwin' ones I'm throwin' twenty dolla bills
Fuck it fifty dolla bills fuck it hunred dolla bills

Buy Louis luggage and send her ass a plane ticket
