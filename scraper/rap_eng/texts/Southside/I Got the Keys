I belched on the mother fucking track at first
Rich took it off, I wanted to keep it because I felt like I belch after I ate this mother fucker

[Verse 1]
People always askin' me the key
Tell you on they own you not a G
Keys as old as 1963
All the way to 2017
I done drove the shit you never seen
Never sellin', I keep everything
Never trade it, wanna buy another
I just paid for all them motherfuckers
Had to buy another house just to park the cars at
Had to buy a storage space just so I could stash all them Cadillacs
Trucks and all that, bad bitch been fuckin' all that
Dropped her jaw when she saw that
Big Benz with the curtains drawn back
Big business, that's what you call that
My dawg called me last night
Said you gotta get on this beat that
That I got the keys, the keys
Cause you really got some keys
Carry a horse, the tops come off
Or I might hop in the business piece
4.6 Range Rover with fog lights, bitch I'm Jay Z
Might give 'em that hot boy style
Bentley all large with the TVs
Bitch, it don't matter to me
Just let me know what you want see
Cause I really got them keys
From slinging' that audio D
96, double S like Master P
And that Cali-o back in the G
I'm doin' this shit for the Gs
Dippin' on Ds like Easy E
Fly and spurt like Pimp C
2 cars, that's Iced T
Parkin' lot outside my house
From the sky, it's not hard to spot
I been runnin' too hard to stop
With my switch, I make that 4 drop
