[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
He selling dope out his grandma house, now that's a no no
He selling dope out his mama house, now that's a no no
Stupid nigga, you don't shit where you sleep at
Killers kidnap your sibling's, kick your door, all you heard was click clack

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
He calling 'round town, where my shit at?
He trying to pay, he don't want no get back
He all Pro Tools, that nigga all rap
You a pussy nigga just to be exact
Boy, you ain't ever trap (Flexing!)
You the type of nigga that'll fuck up your pack
My youngin's palms peeling cause he selling too much crack
Deodorize these niggas, choppers spraying like some Axe
Still punching niggas, Mortal Kombat, call me Jax
Rule number one, don't shit where you sleep at
Rule number two, keep a motherfucking strap
Turn your niggas on, get a youngin' some packs

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
He selling dope out his grandma house, now that's a no no
He selling dope out his mama house, now that's a no no
Stupid nigga, you don't shit where you sleep at
Killers kidnap your sibling's, kick your door, all you heard was click clack (bow!)
Click-clack (bow!)
Click-clack (bow!)
All you heard was click-clack
All you heard was click-clack
Nigga gimme that, D.O.A

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
I say young boys out here lurking
Murking a nigga on purpose
Pulling up in that rental
One shot from the Glock, he jerking
Got to watch who you call your folk
Can't sell to a nigga you don't know
That's rule number one, no using
Get ghost when you see the po-po
Oh no, these little niggas out here tripping
Talking how they cocaine whipping
Claim that they trap be jumping
Selling dope, watch your mama's, you dummy
Man y'all niggas really ain't on shit
Niggas ain't selling no bricks
Niggas ain't moving no weight
You ain't never caught no case
I'mma have my Haitians at your door
Ain't talking Domino's
Couple Glocks and one .45
And they kick the door and they lay it down
Click clack, oh, they scared now
If you move quick, then you a dead guy
That red dot

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
He selling dope out his grandma house, now that's a no no
He selling dope out his mama house, now that's a no no
Stupid nigga, you don't shit where you sleep at
Killers kidnap your sibling's, kick your door, all you heard was click clack (bow!)
Click-clack (bow!)
Click-clack (bow!)
All you heard was click-clack
All you heard was click-clack
Nigga gimme that, D.O.A
