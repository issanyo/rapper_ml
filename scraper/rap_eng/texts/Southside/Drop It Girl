[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Double-T 2
Me and Slim Dunkin, got Capp and Wooh
Stickup kid, BSM
Uh

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & Wooh da Kid]
Big faced hundreds (yes)
And old twenties (yes
All my niggas thugging and they in their twenties
They say 30's the new 20, I'm like, "Boy, stop"
I don't do too much talking, just let the bands drop (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (what?)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (what?)
You with the squad, you got options, girl (what? what? yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
She with the squad, she got options, girl (what? what?)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Pulled up, hopped out, my rims start dougieing, I'm thugging it
Richer that your husband, ex, and brother them
I'm with the Grove and them and the cran gang
Made 23 thousand for these earrings
15 thousand for this big old ring, all i know is flex
Bodybuilder swag, I got muscle, motherfucker
Came a long way from jugging weed and serving smokers
Life la vida loca, all I know is flash, Flocka
Money, money, money, I'm like, "Feed me some more money"
I feel like John Belushi, I might break me a snow bunny

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
At the zone 3 days, still fresher than you
Start rapping and robbing is what I'm destined to do
All that loud talking, better have your weapon with you
Niggas ain't jumping shit, I was blessed in the crew
Be like "Why not break some? Why not check some?
Semi-automatic 9, why not take some?"
See me in your hood, boy, you better respect some
Send them firefighters to your block, get wet some
Robbing in my Robins, fuck a conversation
Fucking niggas' bitches, that's my occupation
Think I'm Puerto Rican, hair nappy like a Haitian
Keeping all the money, them bitches, I'm replacing
This just how I do it, this how a nigga shine
February, shirt off like it's summertime
Dunk

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & Wooh da Kid]
Big faced hundreds (yes)
And old twenties (yes
All my niggas thugging and they in their twenties
They say 30's the new 20, I'm like, "Boy, stop"
I don't do too much talking, just let the bands drop (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (what?)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (what?)
You with the squad, you got options, girl (what? what? yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
She with the squad, she got options, girl (what? what?)

[Verse 3: Lil Capp]
I'm headed to the top and I'll never fall
I'm hotter that the Devil's drawers
Money on my mind and I don't move unless the cheddar call
Coach told me I need to ball
Told my teammate pass me the ball, let him haul
Watch me ball, nigga
Pulled up, top back, the whip bald, nigga
I got them shooters with me, round of applause, nigga
Yeah, we clapping, know we 'bout that action
All-out blitz, we'll sack him
Kidnap your princess, shoot up all your captains
Yeah, we love the beef, pussy nigga, pass the napkins
Running with them birds, I ain't talking 'bout them Falcons
I'm talking 'bout B-S (Brick Squad)
Nigga, this is G-S (Grove Street)
Everything green and cranberry when you see us, see us

[Verse 4: P-Ceeze]
Money on the table, money on the floor
Stash in the attic, call it money galore
Never give it all up 'cause my hunger for more
Give me more, give me, give me, give me more dough
Name speak for itself, all about the cash
Stickup kid, bitch nigga, where the money at?
Yeah, I came through the hole like a running back
You see them junkies on a stroll and they coming back
Yeah, they coming back, south side, yeah, we running that
Southside, yeah, he on the track
No, my team ain't fumbling
Oh, we ain't fumbling, try to shoot, we busting that
President, press the green button [?] we bumming that

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & Wooh da Kid]
Big faced hundreds (yes)
And old twenties (yes
All my niggas thugging and they in their twenties
They say 30's the new 20, I'm like, "Boy, stop"
I don't do too much talking, just let the bands drop (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (what?)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (what?)
You with the squad, you got options, girl (what? what? yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
Dr-dr-drop it, girl (yes)
She with the squad, she got options, girl (what? what?)

[Verse 5: Just Rich Gates]
Catch me in VIP with Dirt Gang, my brother Dae Dae strapped with the [?] K
Just Rich Gates AKA Nike, making swishes
I ain't rolling, but I'm picking dimes up everywhere
Girls choosing chain shawty like I'm shooting [?]
803, Merk City, Merk Star
Fuck the parking lot, we having shootouts at the bar
Brick Squad, JCE, balling MVP
So much haters on my dick, I thought they hoes [?]
Cash money with these racks, I'll take your lady
Been a hot boy, call me Weezy Juvie Turk Baby Gates, bow
Gates

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame & Wooh da Kid]
