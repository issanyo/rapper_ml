[Hook:SD]
I'm used to playing on the block
Where you gotta be up
And if you think about shooting get your batteries up
You want to hide in the cut we shoot yo mama crib up
Boy I be thinking about this money that I gotta get up
Re-up re-up aye I gotta get up
Re-up aye I gotta get up
Re-up aye I gotta get up
Boy I be thinking about this money that I gotta get up re-up

[Verse 1]
These niggas bitches they be tripping, they can't make a decision
I'ma boss in this bitch boy I'll embarrass your business
I need money to discuss boy I ain't no good for business
And it's a shame when the money fall in love with a nigga
I love money more than hoes
It's all a commitment and you ain't fucking with the squad boy just stop with the gimmicks
Couple craters in your face boy just stay out my business
And boy I be wildin' with this money boy I stay on my pivot
When you thinking about finessing boy you better get plenty
You a robber, we some killers boy we strapped with No Limit
I got bitches down the line boy they all want to see me and you fugazy ass niggas your whole squad want to be me

Boy I be thinking about this money that I gotta get up
Re-up re-up aye I gotta get up
Re-up aye I gotta get up
Re-up aye I gotta get up
Boy I be thinking about this money that I gotta get up re-up
