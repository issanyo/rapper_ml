[Intro: Lil Baby]
Southside on the track, yeah
Southside
Southside
Yeah
Strapped!

[Chorus: Henry Draw]
I just pulled up in your hood with Yamborghini trucks
A huge influx of bucks and schmucks tryna steal from us
A plus, you ride a school bus, we ride around in Bentley trucks
You postin’ up and tryna shim Malone and fix yo’ luck

[Verse 1: Henry Draw]
White boy, yeah he makin’ trends
First one makin’ rounds since Slim Shady
I got a crew, and I got friends
And I only had one leading lady
You actin’ crazy, hide in tupaiidae
And you pray-ay for me to sway
I got the weights, and I got the training
To make sure your relevance waning
I ain’t complaining, I maintain that
But I do think I’m underrated
Got wordplay, got references
But you all just keep on hatin’, don’t care
Unlike 44, I don’t care
44 the Ferrari boy count of pears
44 More points of Logic
In my fanny pack
And I stay smooth, like the Men in Black
He feelin’ B.L.U.E. but he really black
And I steer myself on the right track
Do what I want, not for the racks
And I’m too, packed up
And I’m too, strapped up
And you lackin’, you boolin’
You bloody, I’m coolin’, from the heat
In the comfort of my home
Mansion look like Rome
You move evidence, Syndrome
And I got perfect genomes
And my pockets full, my four poured
Protect myself with styrofoam
While you run, bitch I Bolt
And I haven’t signed myself to a cult just yet

[Chorus: Henry Draw]
I just pulled up in your hood with Yamborghini trucks
A huge influx of bucks and schmucks tryna steal from us
A plus, you ride a school bus, we ride around in Bentley trucks
You postin’ up and tryna shim Malone and fix yo’ luck

[Verse 2: Henry Draw]
I’m top ten, not bottom five
Only got four other dudes that precede me
They Bad and Boujee, they got a Bambi
Live in this country, and love to BOOGIE
I’m so round and white, I’m a white blood cell
My enemies, yeah I will quell
I understand that there’s no need to dwell
But I can break into your room in the hotel
You way too sweet, you caramel
You lackluster, need cowbell
You scaredy-cat, hide in your shell
Then come out, you’ll be shocked
Hit you with a cannon, then you blocked
Supreme Court had to come and concoct
Say that I need to unlock
You did that, so now you chalk
On my grind, 6 EP’s a year
Bad quality is something I don’t fear
I don’t throw on wall, hope adhere
I know it will cause a smear
‘Round the sphere
Hide in your hole like meerkat
Girl just like B.O.B., flat
My mind I need to clear, stat
I don’t know about the rap game no more
We lettin’ mumble people into the doors
This just as a hobby feel like a chore
I hate mixing and mastering, and I went on a rant again, god damn

[Chorus: Henry Draw]
I just pulled up in your hood with Yamborghini trucks
A huge influx of bucks and schmucks tryna steal from us
A plus, you ride a school bus, we ride around in Bentley trucks
You postin’ up and tryna shim Malone and fix yo’ luck
