[Hook]
I'm a Frontstreet savage, all my niggas super grimy
Run off with that work don't make me come and find you
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera

[Verse 1]
Get too close then I might just shoot you
You ain't a street nigga you a mothafuckin goofy
Should I come outside with my 40 or my uzi
Should i come outside with that 40 or the ak
I don't need no mask I'll do this shit bareface
Keep some shooters in the hallway, by the staircase
It ain't gotta be dark kill him up in broad day
Kick a nigga door kill his ass in his own place
Savage Squad bitch we some mothafuckin terrorists
Savage Squad bitch most wanted in America
I stay on the road, like I drive for Uber
You can't hang with me, cause you ain't a shooter
Doowop got my tec and Doowop he gone shoot you
Watch his brain hit the floor and we gone keep it moving
Rain sleet or snow shit we gone keep it moving
Rain sleet or snow shit we gone keep on shooting

[Hook]
I'm a Frontstreet savage, all my niggas super grimy
Run off with that work don't make me come and find you
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Frontstreet savage, all my niggas super grimy
Run off with that work don't make me come and find you
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning I'm like where my drugs
Wake up in the morning I'm like where my gun
When I cop some work I'm tryna double up
When I cop some work I'm tryna double up
If your bitch want me to fuck I only want her tongue
Everywhere I go you know I got a gun
If a nigga tweak Ima shoot it up
All my fuckin Glocks come with big ass drums
We gone fight the case if we gotta run
Bitch I jumped off the porch since I was fuckin young
I was only 10 when I was selling drugs
Been up in the streets, ain't did what I had done

[Hook]
I'm a Frontstreet savage, all my niggas super grimy
Run off with that work don't make me come and find you
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Frontstreet savage, all my niggas super grimy
Run off with that work don't make me come and find you
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
Don't make me kill you on camera
Ooh, don't make me kill you on camera
