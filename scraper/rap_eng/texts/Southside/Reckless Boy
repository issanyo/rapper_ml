[Hook]
Yo bitch yo bitch you can call me Sal
Haters sweat me get em' a towel
Imma reckless boy, imma reckless boy
Yo bitch yo bitch you can call me Sal
Haters sweat me get em' a towel
Imma wreck this, imma reckless boy

[Verse 1]
You it's west side, i'm an o-side boy
How i ride, get washed away in my tide boy
Go hard til there's blood like charles louboutin
So gamy the rappers i'm chewing on
Whos more ynr, i got em' beat by far
Flip shit more than a supersonic car
Elicit the spirit of george barnes for a minute
Can't halt explicits when you flow like a spicket
Kellz the only great white, now that ain't right
I've been here, y'all blinded by my light
My shine illuminates, yours just dissipates
Put me on blast are you trying to instigate
Walk a mile and learn why i'm so volatile
Clearly a beast without the x, man
The only top gun that ain't robbing none
Papa nambu, y'all are just my sons

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Imma stay high all the time or die trying
I take that wild shit while sighing
You think this weed makes me paranoid
Boy you don't even compare to me
Get jammed up we holding court in the street
Fuzz bust me for having a slight buzz
P.d. continue their efforts to impede me
Their will and determination just feeds me
Can you read me, good then head me
Cash rules everything around me
Pigs crave cream, same as you and me
Only rat i'll ever be is in the gym
Every action i take sparks a revolution
Turned out to be a blessing in disguise
On my hustle and flow it was no jive
Even locked up keeping the dream alive

[Hook]
