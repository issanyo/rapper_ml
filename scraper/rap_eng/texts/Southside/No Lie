No lie, yeah

[Verse 1]
No lie, I be high as hell every interview
Fuck your bitch for an hour, call that shit an interlude
No lie, I really plugged in with them intertubes
You the type to talk before the judge even sentence you

[Hook]
No lie, no lie, no lie
Bitches yellin' like I'm Ne-Yo
No lie, this fifty [?]
[?] boosts my ego
[?] shout out to my Migos
No lie, no lie, no lie
We in this bitch
No lie, no lie, no lie
We in this bitch
No lie, all the money I spent
No lie, we in this bitch
No lie, no lie, no lie
We in this bitch
No lie

[Verse 2]
Your bitch basic but you screaming foreign
You an't neer do that shit you talkin'
All that [?] that shit ain't yours
Boy that jewelry fake, what the fuck that costs
No lie, no lie, all these niggas tell is lies
You ain't trappin', you just rappin'

That designer ain't on your back
Boy you [?]
No lie, no lie, i'm too rich why lie

Quick to say you got my back, same nigga that testify
Quick to say you gon' shoot for me, same nigga scared to ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You gon' lose your life I squeeze this
