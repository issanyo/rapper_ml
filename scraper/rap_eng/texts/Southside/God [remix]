[Intro)]
Yeah, that's that volume nigga, Turnup, Whoooooooooh, I'm God in the hood, High Mind, Out There nigga, Yo

[Verse 1]
I’m God and a hood nigga, call me Pablo, El Chapo, de capo
I got yo whole block screaming “yo te amo”
Word is born nigga, met di yo te pale w
No better picture 2 paint so yo efase w
I'm what’s happening, no need 4 lo que paso
My future’s lit, pa mande m kote pase w
2 advance, don’t pretend yo ko depase w, yeah
So how many perished in Paris, the parents repairing the trauma they sharing, impairing their logic n carry a pair of .44 magnums, no clearance, I’m tearing down thru their rectums and exit thru they mouth
Terrorize a terrorist group, guess who blew them out
On my way 2 skool, seen ’em shoot 2 man down
Brains all over the floor like Campbell's soup & chow
Wow I’m God man, only believe in myself
I possess these flows like a demon from Hell
And I’m all about those bars like I live in a cell, nigga
All about these capitals, call it freedom of wealth...

[Hook]
GOD….(4x) sa ki Christ la, O Granmet, m’sel met, m’fe (sakifris la)

[Verse 2]
I was left broke naked on a bench, who thought so
Instead of note taking for them yams, who thought so
There’s no hope 4 Haitians in this game, who thought so
Now I’m basically an oasis in the sand, or urinal
Cuz water more important than gold, flow's imported from Rome
Dunno where this side of my family roams
I’m truly an abandoned Lord
Most tryna reach my vibe with an extension chord
Sum throw God in the mix, hoping 2 blend in more
When nw babies twerking, fuck u need senses for but u can’t ignore
That I answered all my callings, wanking while massaging my cannonballs
Yeah, meaning I’m feeling myself
Spit nasty maybe tooth filling might help
God complex, ain't no fiction nor tales
No less than picture perfect like filming hi-def...

[Hook + Outro]
GOD….(4x) sa ki Christ la, O Granmet, m’sel met, m’fe Ouuuuut There nigga, Gaaawd On Fleek, coming soon, Gaaaawd On Fleek nigga, Steady Tek-Nick nigga, Out There in the streets nigga, whoooh, hunh, holla....
