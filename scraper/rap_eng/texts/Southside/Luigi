[Hook: Jay J]

I am smoking on Luigi/
Pause/
Bruh I got that fire/
If you need to come and see me/
I stay smoking on Luigi/
Pause/
If you don't believe me/
I invite you to out chief me/

I be smoking on Luigi/
Right/
Come and smoke with me I'll have you floating through the ceiling/
I love smoking on Luigi/
Right/
The high I get from this I swear there is no better feeling/

[Verse 1: Jay J]

There is no better feeling/
I'm higher than a building/
This not for the children/
Stack money if you listening/

Green here like it's Christmas/
More green on my wish list/
I have been a naughty kid/
Lil mama can you fix it/

Ya'll smoking on some incense/
I see you hiding spice packets/
I'm smoking on some dank shit/
My neighbors call the cops/
They say we loud and ratchet/
My smoke is magic/
Watch me bring a bad bitch/
Duplicate the bad bitch/

Bad bitch slayer, I'm a maverick/
She notice my unorthodox antics/
She had to throw away her wet panties/
She slid me here home digits when she passed me/

The way that pussy sings to me it's demanding/
If you ask me that pussy deserves a grammy/
Gimme' that princess peach right there needs my branding/
I might light a blunt while I hit that pussy standing/
