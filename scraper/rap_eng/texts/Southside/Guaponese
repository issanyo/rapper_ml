[Hook: Jose Guapo]
Told her bring that bi-nack
Pull upï»¿ with that pi-nack
Meet me in the tri-nap
Tell Stri-nap "bring that stri-nap"
Tell Ali-ni "we need wi-need"
Got goons riding with mi-ne
Got gui-nap with Qui-nez
And you know what I si-naid ayeee
That's that Guaponese, yeah we speak Guaponese (x4)

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
All about a chi-neck
Cash out on that v-neck
Pull up at the spi-not
You know I'm with Shaina
Rolling out the pi-nound
Yeah it's going di-nown
Hold up we need sy-nurp
Shoot dice on the ci-nurb
Word to my mother, we don't give a di-namn
And if I'm with your daughter, you know I'm going hi-nam
Don't have no feelings for her, I'm just tryna smi-nash
I treat her like the reefa, I hit her then I pi-nass
28 flow, coolin at the ti-nill
Big weed nigga I'm talking bout them bi-nills
Red bone with a tatto on her wi-naist
I wonder will she let me paint her fi-nace

[Hook: Jose Guapo]
