[Intro]
Haha
Squad
God bless, man
Squad
One-zero-one-seven

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka]
19 years old, just met the plug (Flocka)
Black ass nigga, mouth full of golds (Flex)
No top Vert, yellow Corvette (What?)
Fresh out of a Jeep, plug at my doorstep (Turn up)
He said I got to a show tonight, bring all your friends (Huh?)
All y'all getting in, everything on me (I got it)
So I call my niggas from the dealer CP (Turn up)
I do 25 if he fucking with Gucci (Pow-pow-pow)
The loyalty's forever never think different, G (I salute)
Brick Squad Monopoly, we do it B-I-G (We real)
I do it for my friends, fans and my family (Uh)
Young ass nigga getting money, got 'em hating (Hahahaha)
Contemplating on they next move, they need a Flocka (Squad)
Kid, don't kick yo' feet, I'ma bring them M's back
That's some real shit (Flocka)

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Against all odds
Yeah, we made it
Made through the storm and rain
Against all odds
So shout out to my haters (Whoo Kid)
Ain't nobody stopping me

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Ain't too many niggas I trust
They don't make niggas like us (Nah)
I'ma OG, I don't know me, but three young niggas in my trust (Squad)
I got AK's on my van, I got AR's on my bus (B-r-r-r)
I won't let a nigga, I bet a nigga that'll wet a nigga ass up (Yup)
These niggas just mad at the squad because they broke as a joke
You get mad at the TV, nigga go break the remote
I put my feet up and smoke, Flock got the game and the yolk
I got yo' bitch in the blender, I got that ho on the ropes
I had Woo go get the scope and shoot yo' ass in the throat
On ma, I was outside walkin' calm but we four deep in the Ghost
And you gon' smoke on regular weed because you are what you smoke
'Cause I'm trapping and rapping, I'm pouring a four
You smoking a ounce but I'm blowing a boat
Cooking and jugging and charging the low
I'm serving the dope and I'm swinging the dope

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Against all odds
Yeah, we made it
Made through the storm and rain
Against all odds
So shout out to my haters
Ain't nobody stopping me

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
Some say I'm good, other say I'm average
Tryna duck these haters, beat the eyes and live life
Damn, lil bruh, they gave Ty ten to life
Now we up on trial for another fucking murder
Free my nigga P, I say free my nigga P
It's funny how they salute you when you in these fucking streets
And throw dirt on you when you get locked up
Always keep it real, never had my chain tucked
I'm from Riverdale, Clayton County, nigga did you hear me?
Just bought a Ghost and Bentley, pussy do you see me?
Money not the topic 'cause cash I got plenty
Salute my nigga Gucci, salute my nigga Gucci
Had to say it two times, the third I'ma bust
In the squad I trust, can't cross my niggas
Money can't buy this loyalty
Money can't buy this loyalty
D-I-E for this loyalty
D-I-E for this loyalty
Squad

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Against all odds
Yeah, we made it
Made through the storm and rain
Against all odds
So shout out to my haters
Ain't nobody stopping me

[Outro: Bobby V]
Ain't nobody stopping me
Against all odds
Fatality
Ain't nobody stopping me
Against all odds
Ain't nobody stopping me
Against all odds
