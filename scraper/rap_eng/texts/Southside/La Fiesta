[Hook]
La fiesta, La fiesta
It get real lit at the La Fiesta
Diamonds in ya chain need a lie detector
Shawty ain't pass she be always flexed up
I just need the money right now for breakfast
Lunch and dinner i got obsessions
Shawty said she love me, she always flexing
I just need the money right now, a blessing

[Verse 1]
All my plugs in zone 6 is black, not mexican
Dont take business personal but Benjamin my best friend
Cashed out on a chain but that was an investment
If they talking mud, yeah thats just a refreshement
Ion sip dope, that was just a reference
If i tip the hoe, that was just a blessing
When u take some more than a little thats finessing
Glock, Bible, Prayer all the same, Thats protection
And to the ones hating cause we flexing
The message still fucking you like we sexting
Im still giving pointers like directions
She fell in love at the party like a wedding

[Hook]
La fiesta, La fiesta
It get real lit at the La Fiesta
Diamonds in ya chain need a lie detector
Shawty ain't pass she be always flexed up
I just need the money right now for breakfast
Lunch and dinner i got obsessions
Shawty said she love me, she always flexing
I just need the money right now, a blessing

[Verse 2]
I just need the money right now, on schedule
Racks lookin like a book pile no med school
Shawty bad, look like wow
She friended you
Yall niggas some clowns like red shoes
Who you hang around is essential
My face card good, bitch i got credentials
I got her in the party just off ishtrumentals
She ain't even mine, shawty just a rental

[Outro]
Im always on time, thats coincidental
Shawty love lying she just incidental
Money on my mind, yeah in the middle
Money on my mind
