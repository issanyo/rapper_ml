[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Riding 'round town, smoking race car gas
Broke niggas screaming, "I hate y'all ass"
Got a Bankhead swag, popping Buckhead tags
Drop top Jag, getting south side cash
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
Ay, ay, ay, get it girl
Riding 'round town, smoking race car gas
Broke niggas screaming, "I hate y'all ass"
Got a Bankhead swag, popping Buckhead tags
Drop top Jag, getting south side cash
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
Ay, ay, ay, get it girl

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Walked in the club, it's like I fucked all these bitches
Camera phones out, broke niggas snapping pictures
Thinking to their self like, "I wanna be them niggas"
Trueys sagging low, thousand dollar boxers
Bitches love my posture
In the strip club, got these bitches eating pasta
Steak, shrimp, and lobster
AK-47 got it smelling like a locker
She say she love me, but she want Dunkin's number
I get so much money, I'm like comma after comma
Baby, you a monster, nicknamed her Pam
Pussy, ass, and mouth, she can do it with no hands
When them bands pop, them pants drop
Waka Flock

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Riding 'round town, smoking race car gas
Broke niggas screaming, "I hate y'all ass"
Got a Bankhead swag, popping Buckhead tags
Drop top Jag, getting south side cash
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
Ay, ay, ay, get it girl
Riding 'round town, smoking race car gas
Broke niggas screaming, "I hate y'all ass"
Got a Bankhead swag, popping Buckhead tags
Drop top Jag, getting south side cash
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
Ay, ay, ay, get it girl

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Octane fuel, 93
Race car gas, riding with me
Shop Tru Religion, he lying to me
He ain't got jet lag, ain't higher than me
No bodyguard riding like the government with Doublemint
Twins, getting head, man, I swear I need a double dick
Double click, diamonds Fruity Pebbles, Barney Rubble shit
I be getting geeked, throwed off on some other shit
In the hood, fucking with them scums and them parasites
Sipping lean, got a nigga feeling like it's paradise
Called Flock, I just had a threesome with a pair of dykes
2Pac, picture me rolling like a pair of dice
Long clip, you can get it all, I'm the sharing type
Nigga get wrong, Glock 40 raised the Fahrenheit
Dunk

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Riding 'round town, smoking race car gas
Broke niggas screaming, "I hate y'all ass"
Got a Bankhead swag, popping Buckhead tags
Drop top Jag, getting south side cash
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
Ay, ay, ay, get it girl
Riding 'round town, smoking race car gas
Broke niggas screaming, "I hate y'all ass"
Got a Bankhead swag, popping Buckhead tags
Drop top Jag, getting south side cash
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
When them bands pop, them pants drop
Ay, ay, ay, get it girl
