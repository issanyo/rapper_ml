[Studio chatter]
Due to like 1,000 requests
This was a necessary do for Fo' 20 Massacre
I checked my comments and nigga
I done seen 1 million muhfuckers ask for this one

[Verse]
Yo
Midnight, paddle shiftin' my Modena
Hoes thought I sold it 'cause I ain't been seen in it
But it's out, we turn the corner smokin' weed in it
Bape Jeans, 30 G's in them, it come with leadership
You switchin' cars 'cause you always leasin' shit
I'm switchin' cars, I got 30, all me, bitch
Money on the flo' magnetize your hoe
My team finna leave, she askin' if she can roll
Can she roll up the weed?
Can she roll over after we fuck?
Can she get ready to roll out and leave?
Type of bitch that I need
She can keep a secret, she can keep it G
She gon' hold a couple P's at her house for me
Fast cars, nigga took the traction off
Smashed hard I smoke out the boulevard
Niggas is broad and they feelin's mad soft
Them pussies need a box of tampons
We poppin' bottles every day we win the game seven
We ridin' foreign, duckin' charges like we 'cane sellin
Avoidin' 12 in my Porsche 911
Livin' in hell on earth but gettin' high as heaven

Chill

That oughta do it
Fo' 20 Massacre
Shout out to the homies
Smoke somethin' for 'em

[Ad libs]
Fast cars, nigga
Took the traction off
Smashed off
Smoked out the boulevard
Rag top, nigga
Took the rag off
Give 'em what they ask for
Rag off
Nigga, Smashed off
Bought a fast car
Nigga, took the traction off
Slid down Canal Boulevard

Wait...
(Got a garage full of NASCARs
Im'ma give you what you ask for
Show you I work maaad hard
Jet Life)

[studio talk]

We might have to get some more bottles man
Let me see where Rita 'n Valerie at
