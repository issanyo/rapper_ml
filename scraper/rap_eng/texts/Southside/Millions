(808 Mafia!)

[Chorus:]
I woke up I was sleeping on a million
I’m tryna stack up paper to the ceiling
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings, nigga
I woke up I was sleeping on a million
I’m tryna stack up paper to the ceiling
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings, nigga

[Verse 1:]
I just made a ten off a walk through
Walk through to the trap nigga selling dog food
I just called my young bitch to file through
She like to argue so I sent that bitch to law school
I ain’t going back and forth with cha
She like to argue so I took the bitch to court with me
Beat the cases got the lawyer with me
Still switching up the cards, a paranoid nigga
Rolling Wiz Khalifa, we dem boyz nigga
Got it from the fuckin muscle, had no choice nigga
I woke up from a nap worth 7 figures
I’m a paper chaser, I’ma go yeah (Richie!)

[Chorus:]
I woke up I was sleeping on a million
I’m tryna stack up paper to the ceiling
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings, nigga
I woke up I was sleeping on a million
I’m tryna stack up paper to the ceiling
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings, nigga

[Verse 2:]
I turned a dollar to a hundred man
Then I turn a thousand to a hundred grand
This a light show bring a hundred bottles in
I got it out the mud like the boogieman
If it ain’t money, got nothing to do with that
I hear you poppin, where your bitches, where your shooters at?
Somewhere mama care about a pussy chaser racks
I catch a plane, count the money just to double check

[Bridge:]
Yeah dope boy shit, nigga bring the packs in
Fuck a label, get the front and the back end
Made a million dollars, all the crack shit
I made a million dollars, all the gas shit! (millie!)

[Chorus:]
I woke up I was sleeping on a million
I’m tryna stack up paper to the ceiling
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings, nigga
I woke up I was sleeping on a million
I’m tryna stack up paper to the ceiling
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings
Get money nigga, get up out your feelings, nigga
