[Chorus]
Word Play off the chain, you know that
Word Play like a gun, imma mack
Word Play on the track, that shit slap
Word Play he just talk, he don’t rap
Yelling LDV, throw them L’s Up ! (x4)

[Verse 1]
Every fucking beat, never lack
Always doing white, but I’m black
Only do that pure, never crack
Drinking on some brown, or some Pabst
Bitch you irritating, like some crabs
Bitch you so annoying, in all caps
Always playing games, this ain’t craps
Always on ya knees, like you Kaep
Soaring through the sky, in a raft
Pockets gon be fat, William Taft
Astrophysicist, I do math
I’m a scientist, I’m exact

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I don't fuck with humans, you know that
Always act like Harden, I step back
Monet how I paint, on the track
Appalachian State, I ran track
Still was writing songs, up in class
Framing my diploma, see I passed
Becky walking in, big ole ass
But all the colored girls, I would smash
Got a Volkswagen, and it’s fast
80 times 2 on the dash
Eating around Remy, while he fast
Call me Bandicoot, imma crash

[Chorus]
