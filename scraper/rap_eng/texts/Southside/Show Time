[Verse 1: Juicy J]
It's show time, no Apollo
My .44 fillin' up with hollows
That ain't your bitch, that's our ho
I swerve that bitch like a pothole
Me and Paul stuff hoes in the Tahoe
I ain't ever stuff shit up my nose
Your bitch at the show, come in my clothes
Borrow that ho, give her back tomorrow
When it's show time, I show out
Let 'em in, fuck 'em all, kick 'em all out
Me and Big Trees hold that block down
Put the word in, get a nigga knocked down
Show out, get knocked out
I got this shit on lockdown
That's your hood? This my town
I'm up, yeah, bitch, I'm back down

[Chorus: Juicy J & XXXTENTACION]
Wake up (wake up,) get high (get high)

Show out, it's show time
Wake up (wake up,) get high (get high)
Spin five (spin five,) get fly (get fly)
Roll up (roll up,) ten times (ten times)
Get out (get out,) no lie (no line, no line, no line, no line, no line, no line)Rollie, that's show time

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
I got ebola, yes I got ebola
My dick touch her lip and that bitch hit a stutter
I'm not a prototype, I'm not a prototype
I am original, I'm the original
I took the chopper in half, that's a sawed-off
I put a piece on the beam, motherfucker
Don't relax, don't want the beast, motherfucker
Carnivore, I want the beef, motherfucka (brrraw-pow-pow!)
Wind it up, forehead in paint, mm
Bet you I'm right in the paint, mm
These fuckboys sick in the brain, mm
Yuh, what, ayy, I put my dick in her face, mm
She suck the tip not the base, mm
She suck the tip not the base

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Wake up (wake up,) get high (get high)
Spin five (spin five,) get fly (get fly)
Roll up (roll up,) ten times (ten times)
Get out (get out,) no lie (no lie, no lie, no lie, no lie, no lie, no lie)
Show out, it's show time
(Show time, show time, show time, show time, show time)
Show out, it's show time
Wake up (wake up,) get high (get high)
Spin five (spin five,) get fly (get fly)
Roll up (roll up,) ten times (ten times)
