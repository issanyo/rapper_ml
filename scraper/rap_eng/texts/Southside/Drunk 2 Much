I've got an addiction

Drink until I throw up (uhhh)

I've got an addiction

Drink until I throw up (uhhh)

[Verse 2: Blair Maxberry]

Brick Squad!
Brick Squad!

Call her Mrs. White Remy
I'mma rock her like Lenny
Kravitz
If I want it gotta have it
I'm so spoiled like old milk
???
My girl's soft like old quilts
I'm so drunk, I'm so pilled
Like the top, on the drop, when the streets is getting killed
I'm drinking and I'm driving and I'm swerving on the pill
I've got an addiction, man this shit is for real
When I add it all up, man I probably spent a mill
I probably spent a million, on the drinks
I probably spent a million, on the drugs
I probably spent a million, on the drinks
I probably spent a million, on the drugs

[Hook]

I've got an addiction
I just love this liquor, liquor
I just love this liquor, liquor
I just love this liquor
Drink until I throw up (uhhh)
I drunk too much (uhhh)

[Verse 3: P Smurf]

Ciroc bottles, no chaser
Shorty straight, no chaser
John Belushi, they be all up in my chain face
Red flag, I got on my Lil Wayne face
Condo on the beach, call it final destination
Maserati move so fast they can't see what the place is
Bitches think I'm racist, all white diamonds
So many rocks around my neck feel like I'm mountain climbin'
West side, daddy should have been a bartender
If you're looking for your bitch I'm at the bar with her
? hundred
Now where's my prescription?
I need liqour, liqour, liqour
Liquor, liqour, liqour
