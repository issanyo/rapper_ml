[Intro: Future]
Spin, spin
Southside in this muhfucka
They gon' come down and do it all
ATL Jacob
They gon' turn back around too, they-they coming back around
Atlanta to the Chi', all the way around
Yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Spin the block, spin it one more time (All the way, all the way)
Got the drop on you, sittin' outside (Skrrt, skrrt)
Me and Durkio go back to back (Back to back)
Hangin' out the window, MAC to MAC (Brr)
Spin the block, nigga, spin it one more time
Unload that Glock, nigga, load that one more time
Fuck them cops, nigga, spin it one more time (One more time)
Hit the spot then I'm hittin' it one more time (Let's get it)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I'm a southside Englewood nigga with a check (Nigga with a check)
How the fuck you into it with us and you ain't kill nobody yet? (Kill nobody yet)
You was holdin' up diplomas, they was holdin' up a Tec (For real)
While my 'migos drink Corona, we was pourin' up the Tech (Yeah)
So don't ever front your move, 'cause Booka catch you through the back (Let's get it)
Ain't no rumors for no school, paperwork, and spittin' facts (Facts)
And they goin' off my word, only time they give it back (Huh)
And my brother lost that trial time, he tryna give it back (Gang)
We be rollin' in the lobby, we be mixin' it with Fatz
That's why they don't play with me 'cause I'm not friendly with the threats (Let's go)
Only The Family in my eyes, I got it tatted on my neck (Let's get it)
I just took a flight to Detroit, got some head playin' Dex (Osama)
While my baby mamas trippin', think they made my life a wreck (Ooh)
And they all thought I was tripping 'cause I said his ass a wreck (Hoe)
Why they steady ask for cash, and they know their ass in debt (Let's get it)
And that shit we did with 9, that shit first flight to the feds
They wanna kill us (Kill us)
Foenem geekin' off them dots, they wanna drill up (Drill up)
I know some niggas payin' rent, doin' fill ups
Before they talk to me, these niggas rather talk to pillows (Talk)
We talkin' to these trenches, niggas act like they don't hear
I throw my set up with that draco 'cause we bang
These niggas mad, they turned to opps 'cause they can't hang (Facts)
They tried to drag my name through mud 'cause they ain't gang (Facts)
They say they family but they don't understand my pain (Facts)
Told them old-heads, sit back, just don't get involved (Let's get it)
And that dope they got ain't sellin', they brought fentanyl (Bought fentanyl)
23 and 1, no visits, I ain't get a call (I ain't get a call)
Foenem put them beams on you, look like chicken pox (Look like cicken pox)
And that gun I got, that shit don't even come in stocks (Brrah)
And that nigga I call my plug, his shit don't come in rocks (Don't come in rocks)
And I heard my ex-bitch out here bad, I heard she full of cocks (She full of cocks)
And you'd think he fuck with Craig the way he flippin' cars (Brr)

[Bridge: Lil Durk]
Ooh, ridin' 'round with your Draco (Ridin' 'round with a Draco)
Ooh, ridin' 'round with your mask on (I'm ridin' 'round with my mask on)
Ooh, ridin' 'round with your Glock out (I'm ridin' 'round with that Glock out)
Ooh, shout-out niggas who gon' rock out (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, I ride around with that Draco (Ridin' 'round with that Draco)
Ooh, I ride around with my mask on (With my mask on)
Ooh, I ride around my check up ('Round that my check up)
Ooh, I ride around with my mask on (Let's get it)

[Chorus: Future]
Spin the block, spin it one more time (All the way, all the way)
Got the drop on you, sittin' outside (Skrrt, skrrt)
Me and Durkio go back to back (Back to back)
Hangin' out the window, MAC to MAC (Brr)
Spin the block, nigga, spin it one more time
Unload that Glock, nigga, load that one more time
Fuck them cops, nigga, spin it one more time
Hit the spot then I'm hittin' it one more time

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm a hot nigga, somethin' like Juvenile
Hit the pot, nigga, hold the other side
Off that block, where the shit get pop-popped
Bullet brr, sprinkle, sprinkle, bodies drop, drop (Brr, brr)
Every hour, there's a homicide (Brr, brr)
Fuck them cowards, they can't come outside (Brr, brr)
Soon as you up the tool, oh, ain't 'bout to let it fly (Brr, brr)
Niggas get out of line, gotta let it die
Spin the block and spin it one more time (Yeah, yeah, woo)
Hit the top, hit it one more time (Woo, woo, let's go)
Spin the block, spin it one more time (Woo)
Drop the top, it's a Aston Martin (Drop that top)
Ask my Zoe, he gon' ride or die
Kick a door, we go eye for eye
Split the goal, blood on your mind
Aventador, I can touch the sky
Out the dungeon, like no dragon fear
Baby gangster, get it how you live
RondoNumbaNine, get you out of here (Woo)
I just turned the Gucci socks to a ski-mask
I stopped drankin' for a month, then I relapsed
Got my hood sewed up and I don't be there (I got dawgs)
Bought some chains for my niggas, what they be 'bout
Give a bitch 10 Gs when she leave out (Woo, woo)
Catch the bullet from the stick, cut your sleeves out
Going straight for the hit, then you ease out (Brr)
Do a U-turn, hit 'em up, then speed off (Speed off)
Ain't no lead, just somethin' to read 'bout

[Chorus: Future]
Spin the block, spin it one more time
Hit your block, say it's man down
Hit his top, hit him one more time
Spin the block, hit it one more time

[Outro: Future]
All the way, all the way
