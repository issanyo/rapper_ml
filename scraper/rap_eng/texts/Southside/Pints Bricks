[Verse 1]
Ok, I woke up in the morn'
Bitch, roll my weed up (biil, bill, bill)
NBA, yeah, I be ballin' for no reason (swish!)
Ok, they hatin' cause they really wanna be us
Plug talkin' blood, walkin' for no reason (cash!)
Catch me juggin' in the lobby, 4 seasons (okay, okay)
Send my youngins to your hood, to leave you bleeding (brrrat)
I'm in the club, in the VIP like a freezer (bling, bling)
I might give your bitch the molly just to please her
Pop-pop-pop that booty, thing gon' turn up in the DM's (turn up, turn up)
She be sneaking, and be geeking to The Weeknd
I've been juggin' all weekend got no sleep yet (ya heard?)
You want them drugs hit my line if you need that (ya dig?)

[Verse 2]
It's early in the morning, I'm still leaning
Curse out my bitch then choke her out for no reason
I take a model bitch and fill 'er throat up with semen
Jump off a private plane I drive it straight to Neimanâ€™s
Okay, I really live the life these niggas dreamin'
Call my jeweler up and ask him "Where my bling at?"
If I said it, then I meant it, and I mean it
Pull up in foreigns that these bitches haven't seen yet
I said I'm pourin' 4's countin doughs, smoking out the O
Designer clothes, designer drugs for designer hoes
I'm pourin' 4's countin doughs, smoking out the O
Designer clothes, designer drugs for designer hoes
