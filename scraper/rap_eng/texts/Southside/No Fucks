(Young Thug)
Aye, Bloody Jay
Let's hit the club and order a 100 bottles of Rosé
We ain't Ku Klux Klan but that jet hold 3 K's
I spent 100k on my ring so she can skate
Thugga-Thugga
(Bloody Jay)
I Don't Give No Fuck
I Don't Give No Fuck
I Don't Give No Fuck
I Don't Give No Fuck

[Verse 1:Young Thug]
I don't give no motherfuckin' fuck
Mud on my shoes. steppin on a $100,000 fuckin rug
Bitches just wanna take pictures of these $20,000 slugs (mwah mwah)
SMM don't have a leader everyone we be look like the plug
Woke up and bought a pimpin' Bentley
Learned that from OG Double D
Nigga we killin witnesses, R.I.P. OGD
She know she not winnin' if she stray away from me
She says she's not with it, I see straight through her like linen
Havin' babies, (what)  cookin' babies, (what) water whipping
Casting call, for this porn I need a leading lady
Serving J's alka seltzer, Bloody Jay gon' tell em
(Bloody Jay: I dont give no fuck)
I don't either

[Verse 2:Bloody Jay]
You know Thug, you're my brother
You know it's love, motherfucka
And death to anybody that oppose blood motherfucka
So that go for Thug motherfucka, he blood motherfucka
I'mma wet a nigga block until that bitch flood motherfucka
You know I don't give no fuck, Like a virgin ho that won't fuck
My neck and my wrist froze up, like a scary nigga that won't buss
Any body get it nigga you know we gone buss
Like a pipe with pressure
Me and blood posted at the spot
With more P's than Peter Piper Pick a Pepper
We crime bosses, no goodfella
We bad guys, convicted felons
Quick to buss a niggas watermelon
Let the snitches do the talkin and the stick do the yellin
Put holes all in his cerebellum
I don't give no fuck, Thug tell em
