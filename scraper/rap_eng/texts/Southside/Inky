[Hook]
They call me inky, inky, write on me, write on me
Couple ounces of that purple, got that Sprite on me (X4)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka]
Red Polo, red 'Rari, my shirt and car be horsin'
Baby, bring three friends so we can have a foursome
I fucked 'em to my anthem "Hard in the Paint"
Fuck them 'til the bed break, make that right leg shake
You know how I do, bring a couple friends through
Lemme know if it's cool
Girl you a fool how you ride dick
Got me sweatin' and shit
I'm on that gutta shit
Man I need a gutta bitch
Triple cuts on the phone
I'm on that purple shit
I'm out
Gotta take another sip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Zoo’d Cryst. at Benihana's
Stop flexin you be in a Honda
Squad in the King of Diamonds will spend about a hundred
They got that long bread
You got that short cake
Only thing i miss is money and my court date
Feel sick need a checkup nigga
I can’t spend it all cuz my check up nigga
Dumpin the ball better check up nigga
I don’t need no stress my respect up nigga
I’m up early in the morning
Get my cab before the cereal
Said I gotta eat but I ain’t talking cafeteria
Imperial
Killa cam in the cup
Southside beat with the whammie in tha trunk
Bitches in the back
Got my man’s in the front
Baseball bat’s 3 gram one blunt
This ain’t your ordinary pistol
Semi with the drums
Flocka smoke like he got a chimney in his lungs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wooh Da Kid]

4ozs of that drink
Zoo me the sprite
Bad bitches all around
So we gonna fuck tonight
A couple black
A couple spanish
Got a cup a white
An' they all jumpin dick
At the speed of light
She say she lov me
All because my body filled with ink
I think king filled em with crazy
Need to see a shrink
Lot of smoke
Got a cup a yopps
And a cup of paint
Got my mind trippin out
And I can’t think
I’m inked up
Tell em write on me
No limit to my ink
Call me master p
BSM Boys
We worth a million
You standin at the bottom
That’s a fuckin filler
