[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Aw man, they 'round here talking crazy 'bout the kid man...
You know I don't do no [?] for promotion
Social media for promotion man
When I see you, I'ma pull right up on your li'l stupid ass
I'ma direct this to every nigga on my dick
SQUAD!

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Ain't shit sweet nigga (4x)
Told these motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet nigga
Told these motherfuckers, I'ma show these motherfuckers
Told these motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Told these motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet
Jugging with the rock like [?]
Got a bitch, got a condo out on 10th Street
Sipping codeine like Pimp C
If a nigga really really wanna tempt me
I'm a bust the choppa 'til it's empty
Pussy nigga really don't offend me
Whole body red up in this Fendi
Young nigga walking with the pocket monster
I can get ya hit up with the rocket launcher
Chilling in the cut rolling up ganga
Niggas really fake, really need a Oscar
Niggas see my swag like they got binoculars
BSM the mob but my niggas robbers
Say you getting money but you really toddlers
Only way to do it, I'ma sell it proper
Rollie presidential watch, I gotta have it
Chilling in the kitchen with a automatic
Coming from the city turn you to a savage
Golds in my mouth, Ol' Dirty Bastard
Really [?] for the gusto
Turn your baby momma to a custo'
When I flip out, go nutso
Hit a motherfucker for the truckload

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Told these motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga
Really undercover, ain't shit sweet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga
Told these motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet nigga
Told these motherfuckers, I'ma show these motherfuckers
Told these motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga

[Verse 2: Sizzle]
Spend a li'l hundred, baby girl I got the money
Come and pull up on a pussy nigga, bunkin' and I make [?]
Sizzle still getting it, pussy nigga you ain't saying nothing
Claiming that you shot shit, nigga you ain't spraying nothing
Sizzle still getting it, I'll never ever stop
Took a old hundred grand and went and bought a rich Glock
Bought a new house off the motherfucking crop
Walk around this motherfucker with a hundred and some crocs
Niggas talking beef and they don't really wanna see this shit
I been getting to it, walking 'round not speaking shit
Got a real choppa for you nigga with the sneaky shit
Fuck her one time then I tell the hoe to beat it bitch
Still with the motherfucking madness
I been thumbing through it and I'm counting with a passion
All about a check so a nigga living savage
I been getting rich while you niggas living average
Took my neck and wrist and went and filled it up with karats
Swear you niggas telling shit, you niggas like a parrot
Got a nigga reaching cause the haters keep staring
Low to the earth, got a young nigga [?]
[?] Flexing, got your main bitch famine
Put her on a plane while another bitch landing
Nigga keep it real, you a motherfucking standard
I been getting to it, bitch them motherfucking bands in

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Told you motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga
Really undercover, ain't shit sweet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga
Living in the trenches, leave ya six feet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga (3x)

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Told you motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet nigga
Sitting on top where I'm meant to be, nigga
Yeah I really know I'm killing these niggas
I'm 'bout to start revealing these niggas
[?] with a European stitch
[?] white girl, that's a European bitch
Cuban linked up, I ain't feeling these haters
Tryna count a cool hundred mill on these haters
Hats on hats got me feeling these vapors
Put him on a shirt, send him to the funny papers (Bow! Bow!)
Living in a mansion, got some big money neighbors
Rolling like a fool, palm trees like a Laker
Balling like majors, walking on gators
I could make [?] by the trailer
Turn the bitch in to a tractor trailer
Slid up in that pussy like a sailor
Fuck all these niggas, chase paper
Cross me, you meeting your maker
Come get a hit of this molly (nigga)
I sell it in 4 different flavors
Fully all up with the lasers
I get my lean from Decatur
Thumbing through hundreds, thumbing through hundreds
Don't get it twisted, we gangsta

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Told you motherfuckers, ain't shit sweet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga
Really undercover, ain't shit sweet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga
Living in the trenches, leave ya six feet nigga
Ain't shit sweet nigga (3x)
