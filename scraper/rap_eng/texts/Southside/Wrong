Instrumental: F*ck Up Some Commas by Future

[Hook] x2
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

[First Verse]
I’m feeling so offbeat
Every step expecting to drop
Knees down to the floor
And the ground couldn’t stop these thoughts
If I fell face flat/ can’t fail/ hate that
I’m back up on my feet that’s not me
Run back to my comfort zone but I refuse to quit
‘Cause I’m cool with this
Take all my flaws/ make music with
I don’t know how these standard emcees
Are reaching a point where they’re setting these standards
Oh well/ hands off their coattails
Eyes on your prize/ don’t gloat when your foes fail
‘Cause it’s not about them
It’s all about you
Don’t jump all smug at the front
And emerge as a prick
Keep going/ ignore what they say
Then do it like Jay and just fuck up the world like…

[Hook] x2
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world

Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

[Second Verse]
Feel like I’m overly critical
Show it through poems and flow like I’m lyrical
Fact is I map this anger out to a banger
And attack anyone who’s coming my way
Like I’m doing right now
Everything I write down
Know it’s so typical
Stone cold cynical
Hope so miniscule
Feel so lost but I feel so invincible
Feel I can do it my way
Thinking every minute
“KD, why wait?”
Know I’ve got a talent but I’m still unsure
But that’s life in a cold world
Just love yours; I tell myself
But still fail to accept any help
I feel like I’m doing it wrong
The newer the song
The better I feel
But never reveal
How I feel when I see they’re all moving along

[Hook]
Fuck up with me?

But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world

Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

[Third Verse]
Fuck this
Frustrated, everything is too much
And I erupt in a rage/ can’t function
Doused in a ‘bout of confusion and numbness
Why do I care what the fuck you want?
I’m doing my thing so fuck you mugs
Can’t dumb down when the gloves come off
I don’t care, either way, you’re getting punched up bruv
Emcees throw a dismal punch
Can’t spit/ no pistol when fists go up
So they talk slick/ tweet with their lips all shut
Hidden when the villains let their pitbulls run
Sniffing out their minimal ability
And kill ‘em within minutes of revealing where they stay
Finish them/ it’s vicious/ unh
Spit all I envision in my inner chamber
Door’s locked/ no entry
I enter only when I vent I know me
I need that fuel and I ignore the danger
I go to God when I feel deranged
And I feel that anger and I can’t contain it
I slowly feel I might go insane
‘Cause I’m running in circles inside my brain
It’s just madness/ climaxing
A hyperactive overload of life and passion so

[Hook]
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

[Outro: Daniel Quartey]
Rah!
Yeah
For those who don’t know
Now you do
Yo KD you’re a fucking genius for this one boy
Let’s finish this off and get to the next one
