[Intro]
I just told Richie we rich

[Chorus]
Lately I've been speedin' in a NASCAR
Sippin' the dirty Fanta, I might crash off
Throw these hunnids, made lil' shawty wipe the racks off
Brought the 20 20 out, that's why he mad, dawg
I been passin' on these niggas like I'm Brett Favre
Feel like Future, I'm about to take my mask off
Got a bad bitch with me, we pulled off in the NASCAR
Livin' fast on these niggas like a NASCAR

[Verse 1]
21 Savage, I just shitted on my ex bitch
Had a threesome with her best friend watchin' Netflix
These niggas mad 'cause the Rollie on froze
The whole time, she been plottin' on the low
Young nigga, I was down bad, came from these trenches
Nigga got a million dollars, made it rain on these bitches
When the feds did a sweep, I lost hope
Remember my uncle in the kitchen, whippin' dope
Ayy, had to go and get it, I'm wrappin' up them bales now
Ricch is in the city, I'm hoppin' off the Lear now
Traphouse boomin', I went up on the sale now
VVS got the water, I'm swimmin' like a whale now
V12 niggas, we was livin' too fast
Niggas pushin' work, we was skippin' through class
She can't even see me, I'm like Flash on these bitches
Hoppin' in the Masi', do the dash on these bitches, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Lately I've been speedin' in a NASCAR
Sippin' the dirty Fanta, I might crash off
Throw these hunnids, made lil' shawty wipe the racks off
Brought the 20 20 out, that's why he mad, dawg
I been passin' on these niggas like I'm Brett Favre
Feel like Future, I'm about to take my mask off
Got a bad bitch with me, we pulled off in the NASCAR
Livin' fast on these niggas like a NASCAR

[Verse 2]
I was at Crazy Girls, I had to throw my racks, yeah
I had the section poppin', since you wanna pop it, yeah
Once I get it started, I can't even stop it, yeah
All these stripper bitches fillin' up their stockings, yeah
I had a stripper's thick body in the big body
Had two friends followin' me in the Maserati
Can't let you cuff that bitch, that's on my dead body
I can bet you 10 bands she gave me head, prolly
I was at Houston's eatin' that filet mignon
Bitch, I done ran these racks up out the bando on my own
I was in the streets, so that's what I stand for
I can pull strings like I'm playin' banjo
You can keep on hittin' switches, I'll be in the Lambo
I'ma paint her face in the 'Rari like Van Gogh
I done hit it from the back, now she sing soprano, ayy
Hop in my two-seater with me, out my Range Rove'

[Chorus]
Lately I've been speedin' in a NASCAR
Sippin' the dirty Fanta, I might crash off
Throw these hunnids, made lil' shawty wipe the racks off
Brought the 20 20 out, that's why he mad, dawg
I been passin' on these niggas like I'm Brett Favre
Feel like Future, I'm about to take my mask off
Got a bad bitch with me, we pulled off in the NASCAR
Livin' fast on these niggas like a NASCAR

[Outro]
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
