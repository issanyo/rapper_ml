Like fuck what you heard, nigga, Zoo Gang winnin', baby
1738

[Hook]
'Fore a nigga ever got a job, I got a gun, nigga
Only if you hear "whoop whoop" then you run, nigga
Reppin' 22nd, screamin', "Fuck where you from, nigga"
All hundreds, never 1s, nigga
'Fore a nigga ever got a job, I got a gun, nigga
Only if you hear "whoop whoop" then you run, nigga
Reppin' 22nd, screamin', "Fuck where you from, nigga"
All hundreds, never 1s

[Verse 1]
I'm a trap nigga, all I know is stack
I hit the plug up, then get right at it
Vacuums suck the drugs up, bitch you ain't trappin'
They know that I'm gettin' bucks now and Monty causing havoc
You niggas broke and Iâ€™m up now, I don't give a fuck now
Tell me what is what now, you can catch a slug now
ZooGang gettin' drugged out, memories what this war 'bout
I just left the club now, this bitch had me bugged out
Fuck her on the rug now, fuck her in the tub now
Fuck her in the shower
I just popped a perc, man I've been fuckin' her for hours
Take a break, light a wood, take a pull up on this loud
Bitch tryna fall in love now, bitch tryna give me a rub down
I just got the drop from your bitch, my niggas gon' run down
Runner be puttin' his gun down, this ain't what you want now
Shoot him, I'm leavin' him slumped now
Scary you know they gon' run down
ZooGang niggas, they know yahhhhh

[Hook]
'Fore a nigga ever got a job, I got a gun, nigga

[Verse 2]
ZooGang, niggas on the way
I thought I told these mothafuckas when I'm beginnin'
Now when you see me in my benzo, I be switchin'
I got a black one and a white one cause I'm different
I got a 'Rari, niggas screamin', "Sorry"
ZooGang turnt up, gnarly, I'm life of the party
Shoot him, I'm leavin' him slumped now
This ain't what he want now
Niggas ain't drinkin', they drunk now
17 holdin' my son, yeah baby
I do this in my sleep, yeah
Think he better than me, no
Nigga you need to go
Get your fuckin' stacks up, nigga
Nigga I got my bands up, nigga
To catch me you need a ladder, baby
I'm makin' these niggas matter, baby
To catch me you need a ladder
