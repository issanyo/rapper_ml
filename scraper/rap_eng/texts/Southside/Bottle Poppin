Uh
[Hook]
Bottle Poppin', bottle poppin'
I fall up in the club with my niggas wildin'
Just order 15 bottles that cost 15 thousand
The money pilin', bottle poppin'

Bottle Poppin', bottle poppin'
I fall up in the club with my niggas wildin'
Just order 15 bottles that cost 15 thousand
It's a celebration bitches, bottle poppin'

[Verse 1]
I ball out of control, I used to have nothin'
I put it in the microwave and turned it into somethin!
Work, work work, I'm the modern day construction worker
Twerk, twerk, twerk, my bitch booty be bouncin' like Drama's
Shawty say she on YouTube, you can type in that 'Twerk Team'
And I just got my iPhone, I'mma do that thing for certain
Me likey, me likey, let me know if you dykin'
I got bitches galore, and you don't have to be frightening
I'm the pimp in the back, you can find me on twitter
If I'm up in the club, I'm poppin' bottles my nigga!
Say what's snoozin' my noodle, what's churchin' my chicken
It ain't nothin' but money, but y'all ain't payin' attention, cheers!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shout out to my bad bitches, we don't love them fake hoes
AKA them club hoppers, you got on your friend's clothes
How you want a real nigga? Your hair fake, your nails fake
Your booty fake, you cut your eyebrows off and draw them right back on the way
Hey fellas, you gotta stop playin'
Do the damn thing, fuck what anybody sayin'
Get up off your ass, make yo mama and yo family proud
Haters are your cancers, smoke 'em like a black and mild
Life is pretty hard, but easy at the same time
Stag nation outcome, if you keep the same grind
Speak up, keep up, pat the back of your team and turn the heat up
Pop a bottle just because we was down, look at us now, nigga we up, cheers!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Waitress, hey waitress, I don't like them sparklers
That's just for them cornballs, they do what they oughta do
Lame niggas be quiet, broke niggas don't bother
Rap niggas I got a secret (What?) I am your father
My bitch has burfew, I'm issuing curfews
My leather is too hot, I don't do rehearsals
Smokin' on that grandaddy, rest in peace to my grandaddy
Put his ashes in a swisher sweets, now I'm smokin' my grandaddy
1972 Caddy, hamburger like beef patty
Finger dealin' in Cincinnati, down for life like laffy taffy
Poppin' bottles like I won a Championship Ring yeah
Michael Jordan, Scotty Vincent, you know what I mean yeah (Sosa!)
