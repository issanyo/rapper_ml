(Hook) X2
Two grams of molly got a nigga going brazy
Geekin like a motherfucker paranoid im praying
New Maserati  truck damn i'm going ape shit
I ain't stand no petty bitch we know these hoes ain't shit

(Verse 1)
Niggas clocking pockets like I dont see them watching me
I can get your bitch right fuck her real properly
I can sell your bitch like treat her like she property
Flock called me earlier and told me that hes proud of me
Told him that I got him and its fuck the ones that doubted me
Really really balling nigga thought that you was clowning me
80 new patek its water water like its drowning me
I just got another check that's why these bitches handle me (Yeah)
That's why these bitches handle me (Yeah)
Make em drive a thousand miles for me
They said I won't be the one well i'm on a million three
Made so much money from beats we get a rap for free

(Verse 2)
Fuck the petty waiting Ima chase this money by myself
40 by my waist I got it tucked between the fendi belt
Sizzle going off I think you niggas need to call for help
Real niggas where im feeling like my clique the last left
Walking through the millions tryna run and that's my last step
Never never back down I'd rather take my last breath
Mama told me stack this money trust a bitch never never
Came from eating noodles now my houses got elevators
Swear my money going up that's why i got hella haters
Rich gang throwing up they know i spend hella paper. (Yeah) (Yeah)
Fuck them hoes i'm going in bitches popping money
Hoe don't make me blow a ten
