[Verse 1]
I get mad zooted, I got this bad thing I recruited
My passion is a movie, I say fuck her 'cause I screwed her
I stay on Miley Cyrus, every where I go I'm screwed up
I know my Texas niggas got my back and that's for sure though
Sippin' on Easter Pink like it's Tanqueray
We ain't never gon' give this fucking life up
I know the boys saying they getting into the money over there
Baby trust me, these niggas not like us
I put charisma in my lingo and she fell for me
I gave her realness, and thatâ€™s all she gonna get from me
Bonafide superstar I'm straight up out the hood, uh
I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers

[Hook]
I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good

[Verse 2]
Treasure bring misery, codeine in my delivery
I pulled up in a big B, swerving like a hippie
Moving with the dopers and pushers
In the Rover ducking undercover, hugging the Interstate
Copping a couple cakes and the drum hanging under me
Got a chain hanging over me
God watching over me, all my angels watch over me
I bag it like groceries, keep some cash flowing over me
Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me
The young niggas under me they gon' stand up in any war
We built this shit ground up like the head of a seminar
I talk for the real ones
I talk for them niggas that feel this shit out in Belgium
Freeband Gang

[Hook]
I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good
