[Hook] (2x)
I said I'm balling like I'm J. Well
I said I'm balling like I'm J. Well (Bitch!)
Bitch I'm balling like I'm J. Well
I'm a get money nigga, it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 1]
I'm from River-River-Riverdale
This the land of the lost, welcome to hell
Middle finger cops, fuck jail
I'm shooting back nigga, it ain't hard to tell
What the fuck you trying to sell young'un?
I got weed, I got molly's and them nigga's gunnin'
Disrespect the squad, you know the young'uns comin'
Twenty grand flat and they dome checkin'
No disrespecting
Finger fuck Nina, watch her have erections
President of Clay County nigga
September coming, holding all elections

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Waka Flocka in this mother fucker
Fuck your little sister and your baby mother
I'm a get money young nigga
Factories on the Phantom Ghost, no rims nigga
Diamonds in my mouth, no golds nigga
Under pressure, I won't fold nigga
Ok, that's what they want
Bust a couple of a bottles, roll a couple blunts
OK, that's what they want
Hit the club in the parking lot, I live to stunt
I'm balling like I'm J. Well
Finesse 'em for a brick, serve a dummy bale

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He said he looking for the ?
Call my nigga Diego tell him bring ten hoes
My boys they go crazy, no bath salt
Just popped a fucking molly, bout to blast off
Three shows, four ? that's a slam dunk
Hit the club, make the frat boys fist pump

All I know is keep it real, my money running up, Flocka
