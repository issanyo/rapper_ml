[Intro]
Give me black diamonds

[Verse 1]
Bad boy, tattooed
White boy, raps too
Okay, that's cool
Same shit, what's new?
Find an O and I wrote the song
I was more stoned than a statue
Crazy huh? Amazin' star
Famous off of my first two
Southside, they see we crazy
TM, you see 'em hatin'
Them bad hoes, I see you baby
Bout to run the game like Walter Payton
I'm the shit, you constipation
Hoes mad 'cause I stopped datin'
Bout to take a damn vacay
Now this rap shit is my occupation

[Pre-Hook]
Every time I put them diamonds in my ears, man
It's like I always knew I'd make it happen
A dream come true, swear to God I made a wish, man
Everything I said I'd do, I made it happen

[Hook]
So I'ma run this bitch until it's over
And I'ma party hard, fuck bein' sober
Pull up in the Rover, gon' and bring them women over
I be drivin' bitches crazy, baby, lately I'm a chauffeur
Black diamonds
I need black diamonds
So many black diamonds
Gimme black diamonds

[Verse 2]
I'm gettin' money now
I think it's funny how
The more I'm turnin' up
The more these hoes start goin' down
Stackin' to the ceilin', folk like, "Really now?"
I just think it's funny how them folk be catchin' feelings now
Fuck 'em
Super gone, I don't know if I can stand up
I just smoked two hours back to back, I call it handcuffed
I heard you a singer, won't you come and join my band, girl?
If you good with your hands I'll teach you how to play my banjo

[Pre-Hook]
Every time I put them diamonds in my ears, man
It's like I always knew I'd make it happen
A dream come true, swear to God I made a wish, man
Everything I said I'd do, I made it happen

[Hook]
So I'ma run this bitch until it's over
And I'ma party hard, fuck bein' sober
Pull up in the Rover, gon' and bring them women over
I be drivin' bitches crazy, baby, lately I'm a chauffeur
Black diamonds
I need black diamonds
So many black diamonds
Gimme black diamonds

[Verse 3]
Couldn't tell you where my head is, bitch I lost it
Please don't try to warm my heart, I swear that bitch is frostbit
Flow sick, let me go spread like a disease
All these rappers ain't a problem, I'm worried 'bout them the least
Chanel shoes, Cartier watch
Tryna get 'em to to go and turn this up a notch
Truth be told, I ain't ever have shit
But some paper and a pen, and bitches are gettin' rich
I will, and she can run them fingers down my scar
I told her, "this what makes us who we are"
She asked me what it is I'm always thinkin' 'bout
How to rule the world, foreign whips and foreign broads

[Pre-Hook]
Every time I put them diamonds in my ears, man
It's like I always knew I'd make it happen
A dream come true, swear to God I made a wish, man
Everything I said I'd do, I made it happen

[Hook]
So I'ma run this bitch until it's over
And I'ma party hard, fuck bein' sober
Pull up in the Rover, gon' and bring them women over
I be drivin' bitches crazy, baby, lately I'm a chauffeur
Black diamonds
I need black diamonds
So many black diamonds
Gimme black diamonds

[Outro]
Fly, fly, fly shit, for my squad a five star
Wonder if a legend dies, every time a star's born
I can tell you want it girl, now tell me what you lyin' for
Come a little closer, gunner can you make that lion roar?
I'm just tryna lay you down until you've had enough
I know you will but I'm not tryna make you fall in love
Cause I be knockin' bitches down just like Geronimo
Tell these girls turn around, baby ride with us
