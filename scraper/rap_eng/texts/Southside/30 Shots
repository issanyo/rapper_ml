[Intro]
Shout out Capo, man
He told me, "Fuck this shit up"

[Chorus]
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
Make 'em flip, then I take a trip
'Bout my chips, I don't wait for dip
Assed out, niggas assed out
Assed out, niggas assed out
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
Make 'em flip, then I take a trip

[Verse 1]
Two poles, out here with my bros
You too slow, I'll show yo ass the ropes
In the way, you a walking limit
Super Saiyan, I'm a fucking villain
Phone knock, we gon' get this cream
Switch flows like I switch my jeans
Wanna roll? Know I got them beans
Not alone, know I'm with my team
For 2 Pap, gon' keep a few straps
They shoot craps, I shoot first, no shoot-backs
Facebook got you feeling relevant
In real life, you just a bitch, and you was never

[Chorus]
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
Make 'em flip, then I take a trip
'Bout my chips, I don't wait for dip
Assed out, niggas assed out
Assed out, niggas assed out
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
Make 'em flip, then I take a trip

[Interlude]
For Anton, PBG gon' stand
Losing Pep, I never understand
We gon' reach the type, man
Motherfuckers already know how we coming, PBG shit

[Verse 2]
It's fuck them niggas that be clicking up with niggas
I'm done with niggas, finna start just son-ing niggas
Mosey World, what I'm living in
If you deaf, it's merched, you still listening
Buying Philly, Midnite know it's only Henny
Let's shoot a movie, you can call me Sean Penn
Take it easy, you know you got me bent
Silly niggas, make 'em pay that rent
Bitch, I'm sitchy
Nickel, tank, or .50
Guns we got many
That fake shit, never near me
Most these niggas fear me
All my opps is scary
We used to be by Jerry's
These niggas Tyler Perry

[Chorus]
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
Make 'em flip, then I take a trip
'Bout my chips, I don't wait for dip
Assed out, niggas assed out
Assed out, niggas assed out
30 clips, lot of 30 clips
Make 'em flip, then I take a trip

[Outro]
Niggas already know how we coming, man
Be on the look out, man
3 P'Z Part 2, coming soon
Shout out them niggas, free Dutty
