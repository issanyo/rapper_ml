[Hook]
Pull up lemme get my shit to go
Let me talk about the times I played with G.I. Joe's
It's funny how I'm fucking models, my friends call 'em hoes
Now everywhere we go, my homies that's for dough yeah yeah
I am such a player, I am such a player (2x)
And you are such a hater, you are such a hater (2x)

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
Now homie where was you when I was growing up
Now you popping up because I'm blowing up
Really you and I are on some different stuff
But you will never beat me, you don't think as much

[Chorus]
Cause I am such a player, I am such a player (2x)
You are such a hater, you are such a hater
Let a nigga get his shit to go
Cuz you niggas is some hoes yeah, yeah, yeah (4x)

[Verse 2: Azizi Gibson]
When I was living on no couches you could've told me so
I had to focus on my shit I had to give up all the hoes
I had to make up for the time that I was spending with the foes
I've felt it in my soul I had to let go off the joints
I had to get the megaphone and make sure that my voice was known
You wanna jack and steal my shit had to make myself a clone
They try to tell me this and that they try to get me for my gold
They tryna take me all apart they tryna get me out my zone
But fuck no I will not be stopped by that
No no, I will just adapt to that
No no turn around and rock your ass and go gold
Because you ain't bout to drop my ass fuck no
I'm getting rich and this I know, It's my lifestyle I gotta glow
Gotta go guard, If I switch I moved
I ain't in my zone, please leave me alone

Aye, why you always talk so much
Goddamn you fucking up
Why would you call me bro
Dawg we don't even talk
Like we don't got enough
Oh oh you think it's funny baby
You think that I ain't buy shit
You think of money baby
You think I'm on some fuckshit
I never heard maybe baby
You crazy girl I got this
All I see clear here is we don't stunt enough
Ya'll niggas underestimate us (we don't stunt enough)
Fuck being humble ya'll can hate us (we don't stunt enough)
Put you monkeys back up in your cages (we don't stunt enough)
Man you niggas cannot even fade us (we don't stunt enough)
? (we don't stunt enough)
? (we don't stunt enough)
I'm just tryna make the right moves (we don't stunt enough)
Give a fuck if I like you, give fuck if I like you
We just tryna make the right moves
