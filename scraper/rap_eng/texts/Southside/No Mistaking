[Chorus]
No mistakin me for them, all this Fendi that I'm in
Circle gettin' small, now a dot is all it is
Talkin like she mine, I don't know why she did
All I got is hundreds usin' em to wipe the tears
All I got is gunners with me, I ain't got no friends
Hatin' in abundance and I don't know where it stems
Smokin' on this blunt, hopin' it could the edge off
I just changed my number, hopefully they shake the feds off

[Verse 1]
Bitch you playin' innocent, I know you got some demons
I just told my gunners pick out what they want at Neiman's
All I keep is hundreds on me, I can't fuck with singles
Every time that we come around they look like they single
She know the routine I'm just gone hit it once and leave
Fell out with so many friends I wonder was it me
Fendi on my belt and got the gun tucked underneath
He don't watch his mouth I'm just gone dump on him and leave
Them boys are so broke ain't no mistakin' us for them
And they really not mistakes if you don't make 'em all again
I don't need too many people, got this thang to call my friend
And some gunners by my side I'm always thanking God for them

[Chorus]
No mistakin me for them, all this Fendi that I'm in
Circle gettin' small, now a dot is all it is
Talkin like she mine, I don't know why she did
All I got is hundreds usin' em to wipe the tears
All I got is gunners with me, I ain't got no friends
Hatin' in abundance and I don't know where it stems
Smokin' on this blunt, hopin' it could the edge off
I just changed my number, hopefully they shake the feds off

[Verse 2]
I quit seein' eye-to-eye with all my broke friends
Then I saw my rich ones take off to go on a coke binge
All that meant to Skizzy and me is we flyin' coach again
'Til we get that pack off once or twice and all the dope come in
Saw the opp and let my dogs attack 'em like a Doberman
Music wasn't workin' so we back to sellin' dope again
I quit poppin' pills and doin' blow, I felt more social then
Dirty got that thirty on him, you don't want no smoke with him
We had all the odds against us and we weren't supposed to win
We got all the opps against us speakin' up like hoes and shit
Police got behind us in the whip I told her hold the shit
Bankin' all my game, I'm cashin' it in like a poker chip

[Chorus]
No mistakin me for them, all this Fendi that I'm in
Circle gettin' small, now a dot is all it is
Talkin like she mine, I don't know why she did
All I got is hundreds usin' em to wipe the tears
All I got is gunners with me, I ain't got no friends
Hatin' in abundance and I don't know where it stems
Smokin' on this blunt, hopin' it could the edge off
I just changed my number, hopefully they shake the feds off
