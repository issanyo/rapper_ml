Follow my money, lead you to a vault full of cash
Fuck with the plug he lead you to a house full of bags

Drip out the lot and brand new paper tags
Drip out the pot and still bring it back
She follow my drippin' I smash and I pass
He mad cause I dripped on his hoe, give her back
More to come back cause my arm look like Jacks
The Act I pour up, need the last drip of that
I stack up the money and then drip with the sack
You look at the money, can't get to the sack

[Verse 2: Sauce Walka]
Follow the drip
White bitch with me, blue eyes like a crip
All she do is get the blood money
Sauce Gotti; I want all the money
She gon' make a big bank roll
I got shooters and they all snipers
Hoes follow me like Pied the Piper
I got a Benz worth two Vipers
That's expensive Bling Bling, all my diamonds glisten
I remember sending bitches out the hotel, driving Expeditions
Had to get a bank
Ran out of oil, lookin' for the drank
Going hard in the paint
They hated on the Sauce, but now they splashing every day

[Hook: Quavo]

Kickin' flavor like Now and Later, middle finger up to a fuckin' hater

[Verse 3: Sosamann]
Gotta explain what you need to do
Try to take my guape and I'ma shoot
Lil' mama bring me all the loot
Kickin', drippin' with my Migo crew
Flippin' bitches, nigga, how about you?
Flippin' bricks is what I used to do
Free my niggas, kill
Rocket launcher on my hip
Aiming at you if you trip
You done tripped out, now you gone
You racing where you can't see 'em
I swear you wouldn't wanna be 'em
Big Sosa, spend ether
But this ain't north, pause for the cause
Got Versace all on my drawers
Where your money lil' mama, cause that's all I want
