Check me for a choker, turn you to a smoker
Better yet a schnauzer, Put it on a saucer
No I'm not lawyer, make your wife the divorce ya
Roll up in a porsche, you can call it torture
Tatted like a biker, smokin like a marley
Bale of bubble kush cost me damn near 'bout a Harley
Waka Flocka Flame my right hand, Green Flag same color sprite can
Gucci mane call me the ice man, Beefin with niggas no sight man
