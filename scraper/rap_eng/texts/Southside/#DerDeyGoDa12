{Chorus}
Came a long way
I was smokin inna sunny
I dun flared up of all of des junkie
Der dey go the 12
But des niggas acting funny
All des niggas funny
Can't pee str8 dummy
Der dey go the 12
But des niggas acting funny
Der dey go the 12
But des niggas acting funny
Der dey go the 12
But des niggas acting funny
All these niggas funny
Can't pee straight dummy

{Verse}
Listen dummy , you ain't got it from me
Dontchu throw it out the window eat it , get it in ya tummy
If dey putchu ina room you just keep quiet
If they keep a flare mane whole city gon riot
If the 12 pull us over mane ima do the talking
If dey deport me home you know dey gon make me walk it
Im from where they kill you 4 it
Save up cells
You betta pay bribe
Cuz you can't post bail
Lawyer can't getchu out this shit
They won't let you out , even if you get to snitching
School put me on a blacklist
Worse than suspension
Cuz im trappin too hot for detention
Trappin out da 1st floor paid on the 2nd
Cuz want my name onna 20 story building
Ak la flare, and the flare gang villians
All des cops sinnig im just yung n im living

{Chorus}
Came a long way
I was smokin inna sunny
I dun flared up of all of des junkie
Der dey go the 12
But des niggas acting funny
All des niggas funny
Can't pee str8 dummy
Der dey go the 12
But des niggas acting funny
Der dey go the 12
But des niggas acting funny
Der dey go the 12
But des niggas acting funny
All these niggas funny
Can't pee straight dummy
