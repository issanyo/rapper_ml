[Hook: Rico Richie]
I'm standing at a table full of bottles
I'm standing at a table full of robbers
Trust me nigga, you don't want no problems
You gon' make them choppas blocka-blocka yea
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Look I got forty thou on my robin's
Postin' in the town with the goblins
Catch a nigga flexin' we gon' rob him
Tell 'em up the chain or we gon' pop 'em
Got 300 hundreds shot when we be mobbin'
Move the fuck around if you ain't shoppin'
Bibby gambino, I'mma mobster
Made man at the table eatin' lobsters
These niggas ain't savage, they impostors
My shooters like Max off of Shottas
Been around the world, I ain't have no problems
Try'na rob, take the strap like I'm Waka

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Bitch I'm going hard and I ain't stoppin'
Play this in the club, get it rockin'
My youngins in the cut with the carbon
Hit his top, knock his brain out his noggin
They know I run the town while you joggin'
Pussies want to go to war, send some shots then
In the kitchen, whippin' with the wrist!
At 15, Credo taught me this shit
Told me bibby, you got to do it like this!
Shake the dope, seroquels in the mix
And my young niggas steady catchin' bodies
Flip on, they can't do me like I'm Bobby, Huh!

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
My young niggas they rockin' out
No drive-bys, we hoppin' out
Got thirty shots in my clip then it's about 25 I'm poppin' out
I'mma get low but I'mma keep five, never know might need mine
Just in case shit get real, have to let them off and have speed time
My bitch bad like Keisha, and every night I'll eat her
Her hair long, her ass fat, she ain't even got no visa
35 for a beat, give me like 8 bands for a feature
Every time that I step out, be fresh as fuck like Easter
I'm gone...
