[Hook x2: Waka Flocka Flames]
Playing with them hunnids, playing with them hunnids
Playing with them hunnids, I'm playing with them hunnids
Working with a check, working with a check
Working with a check, I'm working with a check

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Playing with them hunnids, playing with your woman
Sprayed like a gunner, playing ferragumo
Worked a whole bundle, for the low numbers
Trapped the whole summer, I'm a road runner
I got hoes, I got hoes, I got hoes for ya
Leave ya froze, strike a pose, In my low, low
Riding around the city with the motherfucking hunnids
Riding around the city feeling like I'm Obama
Playing with them bells like a motherfucking farmer
Certified street nigga, you can ask my momma
I can get 'em to you nigga quicker than [?]
I finesse the plug just to switching up the numbers
Working with a check, working shit to death
Hit it with the right, hit it with the left
I'm a young nigga but I'm worth a check
I just poured a 4 up [?] purple Tec

[Hook x2: Waka Flocka Flames]
Playing with them hunnids, playing with them hunnids
Playing with them hunnids, I'm playing with them hunnids
Working with a check, working with a check
Working with a check, I'm working with a check

[Verse 2: Young Sizzle]
Playing with them hunnids, I'm in love with money
[?]
Spent your whole damn life on a fucking monday
Flew your little bitch out, she came on the runway
50k, that's one day, you can play the walle
I'ma pull up with a choppa on that bitch like gunplay
Niggas hoes like runways, balling on the replay
Lavish shit like relay, quarter mill, a freeway
We can talk a check though, cash out on that condo
I just made a milli, sleep, woke up and made one mo'
You can fuck a dolo, she gon' fuck the bro, bro
Diamonds sexy while I [?] bitches coco

[Hook x2: Waka Flocka Flames]
Playing with them hunnids, playing with them hunnids
Playing with them hunnids, I'm playing with them hunnids
Working with a check, working with a check
Working with a check, I'm working with a check

[Verse 3: Chaz Gotti]
Work my wrist a check, Birkin bag my bitch
Million dollar trap, I got these hoes on check
[?] hunnid round drum on a motherfucking snitch
Better watch out when that motherfucker rip
My baby bottle got Act in that bitch
Niggas with me, might acting a bitch
No comprehend that act in that bitch
She in her feelings, still paying that bitch
White racks for that sizzle bitch
White bezel, my diamonds pissing
Working my wrist and I'm chopping a brick
[?] just road trips
Hunnid pound, that's a road trip
I ain't leaving 'till they all flipped
No paper tag, got a pink slip
Real blood, still roll with crips
You trapping, your pockets got holes in 'em
Playing with hunnid, got your hoe in here
40 on me, my shoulder here
[?]
Blue hunnids, got the snow in here

[Hook x2: Waka Flocka Flames]
Playing with them hunnids, playing with them hunnids
Playing with them hunnids, I'm playing with them hunnids
Working with a check, working with a check
Working with a check, I'm working with a check
