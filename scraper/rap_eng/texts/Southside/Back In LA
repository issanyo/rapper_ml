[Hook: Sonny Digital]
I just got back in motherfucking LA
The world is so motherfucking great
The bitches so motherfucking great
The motherfucking food is amazing
The weed is so motherfucking great
I might not never fly away
I can't never stay awake
I can't never stay awake
Back in LA
Yeah we back in molly hood
Yeah we call that Hollywood
God we know this shit ain't good
Back in LA
Where my migos speakin' spanish
I don't really understand it
Yeah I'm still from Atlanta

[Verse 1 : Sonny Digital]
Back in them Holly wood hill
Looking for thrills nigga for real
Every house worth like a mill
How can I chill this shit is surreal
Theres so much we did they don't give
Everyday it feel like live
My partners for bottles for sips
But any day it can get real
We in the field, it is what it is
You got what you live by
I love some roses
And chicken and waffles
So that's what I live by
Counting the killers thats in LA
Move round the city like tidal waves
Too much traffic on the interstate
I might never catch a flight away

[Verse 2: Southside]
Imma call up a chauffeur
Take me to barnes and nobles
Erin she whip the rolla
RSVP at Bally
Got a show at Santa Ana man
They showing love like I'm in Atlanta man
All these shows in Santa Ana man
Fuck around and buy myself a phantom man
Drive an hour back to sunset
Counting up another dumb check
Smoke a lid with my lungs hit
In the hills is where the fun at
Ain't no telling what youll probably see
A couple white girls doing ecstasy
I told em noble why they pressing me
This and weed thats enough for me
