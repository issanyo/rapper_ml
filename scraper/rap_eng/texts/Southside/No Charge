[Intro]
Yeah, Super Future
Feel That Wave
Yeah, see what I'm saying?

[Chorus]
Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
I'ma give them xans to you baby, no charge
Get that Perky to you no charge
I give prescriptions to you no charge
We gon' have fun baby, no charge, yeah

[Verse 1]
I look inside your eyes, I see the same things I'm going through
Tryna take your heart away, you gotta be bulletproof
Trapping Penny Hardaway's, I can take a screen or two
All I do is gravitate, Iâ€™m rolling on the pinnacle
I get in the trenches for this paper each and every day
I'm gon' make another hit and then go buy another Wraith
Anytime you see me with some jewelry got it custom made
Most the time you see me, I'm done coolin', bustin' down in Bape
Drop top Spyder, that's in the entourage
Travel places they look at you like an alien
Started off my first check I bought some David Yurman
Try to get the recipe to you no charge

[Chorus]
Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
Drug dealers and strippers, they in my entourage
I'ma give them xans to you baby, no charge
Get that perky to you no charge
I give prescriptions to you no charge
I give prescriptions to you no charge
We gon' have fun baby no charge, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pyrex and the soda give you no charge
Come like a bulldozer on the full charge
Trappers and gamblers that's in my entourage
Trappers and gamblers that's in my entourage
I never did trade, never did one time
Still posted on the corner ducking one time
I know you still in your BM nigga time to time
I know you still check your DMs from time to time

[Chorus]
Drug dealers and strippers they in my entourage
Drug dealers and strippers they in my entourage
I'mma give them xans to you baby no charge
I give prescriptions to you no charge
I give prescriptions to you no charge
We gon' have fun baby no charge, yeah
