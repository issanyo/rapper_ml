[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
Ayy Sizzle
I still don't know what to call it, haha

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
I been fuckin' with this real little trill little ho
We been like this for a minute 'cause she concealed with it though
Told my bitch I cut her off but we still creepin' on the low
She got an nigga, I got a bitch, but this y'all already know
She be askin' what to call it, I'm like I still don't know
He might question her 'bout niggas but he still won't know
She gon' play him to the left (how?), like she coolin' with her friend
Then I pull up like get in, in my baby mama's Benz
Ooh, I'm foul foul (ooh ooh), I ain't shit (I ain't nothin')
Hope she don't find out (out), she gon' clip (she gon' spazz, ooh)
This shit getting serious (how?), her nigga gettin' on to us (damn)
Message come through like she text, don't know if it's him or her (what you do?)

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
No reply, so he still don't know
She like what is we doin', I'm like I still don't know
Neither one of us slip up so our spouses can't trip up
Hit me like when we gon' get up, I'm like I still don't know

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
It's confidential how we link, gotta keep it on the low
Told my dog to get the room, he hit me back like it's a go
This time just use a rubber bro, seven kids you don't need no more
She pulled up naked, looked so sexy when she took off the trenchcoat, ooh
My bitch happened to drive by and just spot my car outside
I can't put this on my nigga, she know every car I drive
Now she callin', hittin' the line, let it ring, don't hit decline
So I can play like I was sleep, that's a nigga's favorite line

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & Yo Gotti]
No reply, so she still don't know
She like what is we doin', I'm like I still don't know
Neither one of us slip up so our spouses can't trip up
Hit me like when we gon' get up, I'm like I still don't know
I don't know
No reply, so he still don't know
She like what is we doin', I'm like I still don't know
Neither one of us slip up so our spouses can't trip up
Hit me like when we gon' get up, I'm like I still don't know

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
They say you caught (I'm like with who?), because I still don't know
I'm in Dubai with my guys and some other nigga's ho
And the blogs want to report me but they still don't know
And my plug still support me so I still got coke
I keep swappin' out these hoes, I can't make up my lil mind
I don't know which one I like so I'm dividing up my time
(What happened in Paris? I don't know)
Man I still don't know
You can fall in love and marry her but she still gon' go (damn)
Had a crush on Mira (Mira), had a crush on Lira (Lira)
Had a crush on that seven figures 'til I touched that million (touched it, skrrt skrrt)
Louis V, Supreme, Rari in Dubai (what the shit)
What you tell your bitch when she ask who you with?

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
No reply, so she still don't know
She like what is we doin', I'm like I still don't know
Neither one of us slip up so our spouses can't trip up
Hit me like when we gon' get up, I'm like I still don't know
(I don't know)
No reply, so he still don't know
She like what is we doin', I'm like I still don't know
Neither one of us slip up so our spouses can't trip up
Hit me like when we gon' get up, I'm like I still don't know
(I don't know)
