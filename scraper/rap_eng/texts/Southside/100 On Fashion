[Intro]
Bruh I don't know what y'all talking about
I got about 5, 6, 7, 8 bags on me!
How the hell am I supposed to fit this shit in the trunk?
I don't know but I'm about to look fly as a motherfucka this Monday my nigga, best believe that!
I ain't never been a motherfucking wack ass nigga
I ain't wearing no motherfucking Rocawear, fufu looking ass motherfucka
Fuck that lame ass shit boy!
I'm starting these motherfucking trends boy!

[Hook]
100 on fashion, 100 on fashion aye
100 on fashion, 100 on fashion aye
H&M to PacSun
Bags packing, male Maxim
They stacking, I maxed 'em
Flannel game on slashed 'em

[Verse]
Lifestyle exquisite
Taste expensive mouth explicit
Heather on black, in the back
Boys is mad like it's shit where they sat
Subtweeting FUBU modelling
What really the problem is?
You'll be solving for ex in a minute
Cargos the reason the relationship finished
R.I.P. all this cotton and suede on me
I'm fitted with capital Ts
Capital F for I'm fashionable, G
Close to Ben Franks, we're blood like B
He stay in my wallet, he golddigging me
Pockets deeper than voice of Barry
Aberrance apparent I'm still innovating
Apparel aerial it's so educating
