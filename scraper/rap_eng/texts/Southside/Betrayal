[Refrain]
They tried play me
My own squad tried betray me
Never love these bitches 'cause they played me
Can't leave these streets because they paid me
I can't believe they tried betray me
I can't believe they tried betray me
I can't believe they tried betray me
I won't let these niggas faze me

[Verse 1]
I just got a phone call, it got me rethinking shit
Homeboys and my enemies been on some linking shit
An OG big homie, sucker shit can't condone it
Catch a body, I'm on it
It's CMG, now who want it?
I can't believe you tried betray me
Oh that's the way you gon' repay me
Got to stay two steps ahead, too many cats in the fed
Think I broke too much this bread, too many suckers got fed, for real

[Refrain]
I can't believe they tried betray me
I can't believe they tried betray me
I can't believe they tried betray me
I won't let these niggas faze me

[Verse 2]
Death before dishonor how they raised me
Seen the double cross, that shit didn't faze me
Had the FN with me, upped it on 'em daily
Baow baow baow baow baow, crazy
Double cross, double cross
They killed my lil partner, it's another loss
It's murder on my mind, I got bloody thoughts
I hope none of these niggas come piss me off
I heard my lil bitch been out fuckin' on 'em
Yeah that's my lil bitch but I cut her off
The hitters gon' fire when I say
Off with her head, I really mean take it off, literally

[Refrain]
Ayy, they tried betray me
I can't believe this ho just played me
You made a me, you-you made me a savage
(I'ma make you regret it)
Ayy, you made me a savage (savage)
You had my heart on automatic (automatic, brr)
I used to think you were the baddest
Damn I think your ass just average

[Verse 3]
Ayy, you shouldn't betray me
Now I'm fuckin' on your friends on the daily
I'm betrayin' you
Nah, I'm repayin' you
I grew up with these niggas from the motherfuckin' mud
Despite whatever I have and always showed these niggas love
We all was coppin' bricks and with the shit, we all was thugs
We always had them dreams of bein' the man and meetin' the plug
This rap shit jumped off for me, I thought niggas would support me
Instead, they tried to bring a nigga down, federal court me
You my man, you can't take no stand, you can't make no statement
We been rockin' since the sixth grade, how you gon' betray me?

[Refrain]
Damn, my own partner tried betray me
Thought you would be the one to save me
You played yourself when you played me
I got the key, yeah that's how they raised me

[Verse 4]
Had to learn the hard way that these bitches just gon' be bitches
Just fuck 'em, keep it movin' my nigga, get out your feelings
Yeah, shout out to Sonja, shout out to Sandra
She was married, I still put dick all down her tonsil
These hoes be hateful and these hoes be petty
These hoes ain't boujee but they always ready
Then act like they regret it
I guess you sorry for the head the other day
All that complaining but all you do is betray
If I was your nigga, bitch you have to find somewhere to stay
Bitch you gon' have to get the fuck out my house right here today

[Refrain]
'cause you betrayed me
I can't believe this ho just played me
But in a way this ho just saved me
'cause you played yourself when you played me

[Outro]
I'll never cross on my niggas
And I, I'll never cross on my niggas
Played yourself, you played yourself, you played yourself ho
Yo played yourself, you played yourself, you played yourself ho
I am, still
And when the help come here, homie don't you confuse it
Lames gon' copy, D boys gon' abuse it
