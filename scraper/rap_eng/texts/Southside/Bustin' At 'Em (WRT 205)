[Verse 1]
I been gettin' this, since back then like my name was Gillie
Grow a sumo on my face, call me Flocka-Philly
N**** what's the deally, Lemme know what's brackin'
Ain't no cameras around here n**** stop that actin'
Bitch I'm 'bout that action, subtract em' like a fraction
Everybody packin, like hit miss Minaj ass
Kush smell like garbage, n**** take some homage

Yellow diamond fuzzy chain, shit that bitch like butter
Bitch I'm like no otha', rap n****
You can call me cut-throat ass trap n****

[Verse 2]
KY Engineerin', fuzzy got 'em staring
Fuzzy diamond earrings, M6 what I'm steering
Woke up to next year in, bring back diamond earrings
That some John Deerin, n**** who you scaring
Shawty I'm tatted up, you can call me inky
All I do is get brains, you can call me pinky
My gooch is like winky, right n****
I got my swag up, right n****
I heard they got a price tag on a n**** head
You got a better chance snitching, n**** going feds
You dug your own grave, let me make your death bed
Suicide shorty shot his own self dead
Riverdale Flocka!

[Hook]
