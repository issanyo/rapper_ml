[Verse 1]
I swear you niggas on some starvin shit, this Rolex is so marvelous
I bought a coupe and parked that shit, I love this money fuck a bitch
Bitches put they heart in shit and i dont need no parts of it
You petty niggas garden shit, we got them bands they guardin shit
You niggas prayin, that I fold, AK with me centerfold
Fuck that bitch got plenty hoes, fuck that bitch got plenty hoes

[Verse 2]
Dirty money magnet, Im a million dollar savage
Smoke the gas by the pound, you lil niggas smokin babbage
Tried to kill that lil pussy, told her friends I did some damage
Im the same ol nigga drinkin Kool Aid with a sandwich
Got the youngns with me, know that them lil fuckas is some bandits
I been ballin like a bitch and I know these haters can't stand it
Screamin motherfuck a grammy , posted thirty on me, grammy
Keep that choppa in the back you know that fucka come in handy
I swear you niggas stuck like photo's, ? out yo mojo
Say you want it with the kid, Im pullin up, dolo
Choppa in the chokehold, pass that bitch like Romo
Neck n wrist a hundo, kush come by the truck load

[Hook]
