[Verse]
That bitch, she a fan, she gon' blow me, keep me cool
I'ma fold in her pussy, whirlpool
Pull up on your bitch, uh-huh, carpool
Got a formula, uh-huh, molecule
Her friends asking her, uh-huh, how I do
Girl, don't lie to her, nuh-uh, tell the truth
I'm not tryna have, nuh-uh, no youth
Pull out game spectacular, it's glue
Then I lay a nigga with a attitude
You ain't got no game, got no attributes
I'm a gentleman, I fuck your bitch right after you

[Chorus]
Man, these hoes like TMZ, taking pics of me
Said she want a kid with me (No way), only in your dreams
Yeah, I still fuck her to sleep, fuck that bitch to sleep, woo
Fuck that bitch to sleep, woo, fuck that bitch to sleep
Man, these hoes like TMZ, taking pics of me
Said she want a kid with me (No way), only in your dreams
Yeah, I still fuck her to sleep, fuck that bitch to sleep, woo
Fuck that bitch to sleep, woo, fuck that bitch to sleep
