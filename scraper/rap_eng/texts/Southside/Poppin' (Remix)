[Verse 1 : Price]
Look
Ayo my mamma said "pray for them niggas that hate
Cause they just wanna be in your place"
You already know what time it is
Look, Let’s go

I'm standin' at the table throwin' dollas
I see it in your eyes boy you plotting
Thug Life you don't wanna wake my Pac (don't you do it)
Got some shottas that make choppas go ch-blocka
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga
I came up out the West like Eazy-E
I’m rapping like the Carter Weezy Wee yeah
Respected on the East I feel like Beans
Respected on the streets I feel like Meech yeah
Larry Hoover like hallelujah
You clutch, and never bussin' cause you’re not a shooter
I go to chase the cake soon as I hear that cock-a-doodle
Playin' with my cake don’t make me have to sock it to you
I need a light skin with some diet frame
They all gon' be kissing before the night end
They all gon'  be fuckin' for the sunrise
Send 'em to Roscoe grab a omelet with a sunrise
Wake up horny and that bagel get finagled
She a freak but on ground the girl an angel
Selfie stick she gotta arch to get the angle
All that ass you must have parked it in the stable, damn
Tell them play this in the club I'm off a lot of drugs
Middle of July ain't nothing hot as us
We bout to do the tour with Snow Tha Product bruh
I’m just a Warrior tryna stack my Iguodala’s up
Cause we been trippin' see our mind they precondition
To think we the victims when we see one of our people winning
That's a weak position y'all seek permission for weak religions
Me I need the mission call me Mister I complete the mission
Lil bitches

[Hook : Price]
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga

[Verse 2 : Oktane]

Uuh okay okay
I think they mad cause I’m living lavish they living average
Need pesos by the case loads
All cash cause it's grind time hustle prime time, really active
I'm trynna let you live boy don't turn me to no sauvage
I understand you want it, I understand I got it
I understand that everytime I move you lowkey watchin'
She know that I’m a female connoisseur she a option
And mamma told me haters only hate you cause you poppin'
Tell 'em do not say my name if they don't really you know me
I told her talk and shut the fuck up! Show me
And yeah it's really emotion I got it really goin'
Got it glowin' Westside nigga gotta keep it coastin'
Finna fuck the club up
Play this back to back and turn that sub up
And watch a young nigga chuck his dub up
They don't know how to act they see the West is back
Wheel it back like old school Cadillacs on four flats
Now who's that that pullin' up with a clique of niggas
They got the women lookin' just to get the look of winners
Yeah it's in the game I never have to fuck to give
Except my middle finger hop up out that trucks and leave
That's just how it is
I told 'em this
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters nigga stop it
You just want to feel important bout your project
Now we really are here to it your shit really out here flappin' uhh

[Hook : Price]
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
