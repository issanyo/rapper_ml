Hook Repeats

[Verse One] (Young VL):
We are not the same but who you fooling ?
Kayy grabbing the oozy ... boi you niggas was snoozing
I'm smashing your bitch, lemme borrow her lips, she knows how to use it
And if you want that beef boi then send it to me
YMG -- I'm higher than a parakeet
Yo baby mama's pussy , she just offered me
If you goose sauce, please get lost from me
Nigga you a goon you ain't no boss to me
I'm smoking on that Poison Tree
Marrying my strap when I shoot , I might take a knee
Boi you flaw to me , If you stealing out the mall your money's smaller than me
I'm placing orders and if yo ass broke, Pussy nigga, don't make that call to me

[Hook 2] (Kshaun):
Bought A Pound & Now We're Smoking With The Groupies (With the fans)

Bad Bitches Round My Cousin At The Reunion (Is they family)

[Hook] (Young VL)

[Verse Two] (Kshaun):
Young nigga playing with a check , I pay taxes (Yep)
Block Boyz flaggin in the club & they stackin
Riot start, all my bros, Full Metal Jacket
Kick us out like muthafucka, I ain't even trapping
They say. My ass. Off the chain. Like Django
Throw the West. Upside. Like I got 3 fingers. (3 Fingers !)
Suck me down, clear her throat, hitting notes, she's a singer
Tap dance, in that pussy, Greg Hines. Bojangles
Wattzgoiinonyo ! Good Evening Sir, My name's Kshaun
