[Intro]
Rich in a bitch
Uh
Bank account looking rich than a bitch
If I go broke, I'm gonna hit me a lick
Bank account looking rich than a bitch
If I go broke

[Pre-Chorus]
Bank account looking rich than a bitch
If I go broke, I’mma hit me a lick, yeah
Bank account looking rich than a bitch
If I go broke, I'mma hit me a lick, yeah

[Chorus]
In the studio, hit after hit
Orgy in the bedroom, bitch after bitch, yeah
So many hoes, who to pick, who to pick
When I hit the scene, they like, damn who is this? yeah

[Verse 1]
Aye, aye, what's your name?
Are you from around this way?
Ball out like Kyrie, aye
Off the top like Afro Sheen
Hella bands, no shame just be
Tryna shoot while I drive, I’ma crash my Benz
Pour a deuce in a sprite no green just red
No pets, I'm sorry, no cat just head
Neck me up, uh huh
Just don't try set me up, uh huh
Sticky tucked in the Tesla, uh huh
I run it cause they both don't make no sounds, (shh) yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Bank account looking rich than a bitch
If I go broke, I'mma hit me a lick, yeah
Bank account looking rich than a bitch
If I go broke, I'mma hit me a lick, yeah

[Chorus]
In the studio, hit after hit
Orgy in the bedroom, bitch after bitch, yeah
So many hoes, who to pick, who to pick
When I hit the scene, they like, damn who is this? yeah
