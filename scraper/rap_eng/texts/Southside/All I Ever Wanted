All I ever wanted was a main squeeze
All I ever wanted was a nigga cheese
Adios, see you later, gone with the breeze
She try to spend a nigga' money like it grow on trees
All I ever wanted was to fuck your friends
All I ever wanted was to park my Benz
I'm just chilling in the back while she parkin' up
I say you fearless, she like yeah, I'm like that’s what's up

[Verse 1: Wooh Da Kid]
All I need is a G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Bitch that’s gonna load them clips and gon' let it spray
She gon' set it off quick, no J to pick it
No keys to your heart but I know how to pick it
Tell your friend to tell a friend that y'all can hop on in
I heard your brother had that work, I got the drop on him
She gold diggin' but she diggin' up the wrong shit
She think she got me cause she thick and she can suck a dick
Book smart, street smart, that’s my type of girl
Fuck them good, fuck them great, take her out this world
All I really need is a girlfriend
Everything else good, money out to spend

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Where should I begin, all I need in this life is a girl that can play my main mistress and my best friend
Rollin', smokin' to the end, all she do is wanna spend my money
She don't love me, got me feeling like I'm ugly
Insecure about myself, God will I find a girl to love me?
For me or my wealth, got me feeling like myself
She always want this and that, newest shoe, newest hat
Got me in sittin' in the back, lowkey, gettin' numbers
But undercover me, her best friend under covers havin' sex like we are lovers
Now we fuckin' with no rubbers, I done slipped up got her pregnant
Plus my girlfriend caught me fuckin' naked
Damn, I'm in some deep shit
(Waka Flocka)

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
She all I ever wanted and all I ever needed
My money got me walkin' around, yo' bitch actin' conceited
The pussy, I don't need it, the cash got me fiendin'
I'm passin' out the paper, you could call me Mr. Phoenix
I'm lookin' for ??? in the club with the banga
Martin I [?] lookin' for my Gina
My partner say I'm Hollywood but I don't give a fuck
I'm shittin' on you niggas every time I pull up
Leave weed around the squad and them boys gon' smoke it up
If I get another bitch, then my girl gon' fuck me up
All I ever wanted was a main bitch, all they ever got was a mattress
