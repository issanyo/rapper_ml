[Intro]
Just making magic
All day, All night, Yeah nigga

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
Pussy popping for the paper (Woo)
Then she upgraded, got into the major (Nice)
Shorty said, "It's fuck with a ball player"
No prenup, no signed papers (Swish)
No baby either, damn she a heathen
Must be a demon
Guess he ain't sees it, that's my fault
Meant to say Neiman's
Passed on the test and got herself a beamer, word
Coming down she got the need to swerve
Big ol' booty, she got all the curves
Other bitches tryna hate on her
Stupid cool, she a super nerd
Give a fuck what you niggas heard
Why you bitches tryna hate?
Ya'll the ones that are fake
She just stepped into the plate

[Hook] 2x
Shorty I can make you famous
Girl tell me what your name is
And all the women that you came with
What you thinking, where your brain at?
If you're in school, what's your major
Are you interested in a player
Are you interested in this paper
Are you interested in this flavour

[Chorus]
Like Ray J. did to Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim (Oh my God!)
Somethin' like a ho to a pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp
You'll be eating steak, eating shrimp shrimp shrimp shrimp
You can have that new ass and some tits, tits, tits, tits (Ahh!)

[Verse 2: Azizi Gibson]
Pussy popping for the paper, but
She gonna have to call you later, yup
Twerking up a tornado (Woo)
Got the stripper pole on the ladle, yeah
And nope that's not a rental (Nope)
The top's gone like a kettle
And all you hoes is Gepetto's
Haters come and get your medals, yup
She been acting brand new
So I been acting brand new
Gotta get this fondue
Whatever you wanna do
Baby what can I do, because I understand you
And you're livin' proof that your past won't haunt you

[Hook] 2x
