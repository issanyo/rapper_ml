[Hook: (x2)]
I got that digital dash, I got that digital dash
I got that digital cash, Kill Off Killy
I got that digital dash, I got that digital dash
I got that digital mach, Kill Off Killy

[Verse 1:]
I got that digital flow, I got that digital wave
I was the six foot deep, without the grave
I was the labour, without the slave
But I don't mean that I won't bark two shots at the rave
Digital Dash, sorry, I was the photo without the flash
MCs talking trash
I spoke to Jammer, he was like "Have you got a secret stash?"
I was like, "Please, can I get a decent clash?"
I don't really know, maybe killing off MCs is all that matters
When I say foil, they better know that I ain't talking platters

[Hook: (x2)]
I got that digital dash, I got that digital dash
I got that digital cash, Kill Off Killy
I got that digital dash, I got that digital dash
I got that digital mach, Kill Off Killy

[Verse 2:]
Shout out to Bloodline, it's all gravy
On a presidential stance, you would've thought I was part of the Navy
But little does he know, I was like top rank
They never knew, that I was smoking dank
Please, put down the shank
I mean, point blank
None of these MCs holding p's, let-alone using the bank
"Prez, when you going to stop talking like your run the streets?"
Sorry, old school Vectra without the seats
They want to know if I'm carrying heat
Yeah, if I'm in a bad one, Stranger Returns completes

[Bridge:]
I got that digital dash, I got that digital dash
I got that digital dash, I got that digital dash

[Hook: (x2)]
I got that digital dash, I got that digital dash
I got that digital cash, Kill Off Killy
I got that digital dash, I got that digital dash
I got that digital mach, Kill Off Killy

[Outro:]
You know, when we're talking greats of Grime
Or the greatest to ever do it
If you are up and coming and you don't mention my name
You're a hater
As a matter of fact, if you don't mention my name
I'm gonna come and find ya
Track you down
Digital Dash, Kill Off Killy
