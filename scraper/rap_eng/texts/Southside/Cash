Sold crack right out my palms
Won’t leave ‘til the whole palm gone
Too trapped off in my past
Hustle for the cash
Grind for this cash
Hustle for the cash
Grind for this cash
All I know is..

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I gotta get it, gotta get it, on the money marathon
All I know is flex and grind, Waka Flock, I gotta shine
I wanna hit it, wanna hit it, got that bullshit on my mind
Ain’t no fair ones over here, you gon' get stomped out every time
Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka, keep the crowd crunk every time
When a nigga hit the stage, it’s a rave, they lose they mind
Lame ass nigga, you not my kind
Big-ass belly, porcupine
All I know is taking paper, I'ma motherfucking grind
Always in the hood, I ain’t hard to find
Beat a nigga ass, nigga sell a dime
Hit the backdoor, nigga, one time
Worry about yours, I'm a worry bout mine
Keep on trying, can’t stop me, I'm too rich, too cocky
Where you from? Throw it up
My squad, Brick Monopoly
Squaaaaad!

[Verse 2: Wooh Da Kid]
All I know is gwalla, hurry, bring cash
I need all my money, hurry quick fast (Ch-yes!)
Pistols gon' blast, if you playing with my check
He just head and shoulders, bullets ate his neck
I got dead guys to leave you guys dead
Know if I put money on your head, you’ll be found dead (Adios!)
Enough of all this he say, she said
I say you gon' die, you just made your bed
All he want is fame, put him on a poster
Playing with my bread will get you burnt by the toaster
Grind for the cash, hustle for the hell of it
Smoke all day, like I just like the smell of it
