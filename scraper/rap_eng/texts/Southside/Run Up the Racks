[Intro]
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Countin' hunnits

[Verse 1]
Countin' hunnits, yeah nigga
Diamonds froze, chill nigga
I went platinum independent then I signed my deal, nigga
Young nigga, 17, all he do is kill, nigga
And I'm drinking on that mud like an oil spill, nigga
Gucci jacket, oh yeah
Saint Laurent, oh yeah
Bust down, cost a hunnit, nigga
That's a trophy
Balling like I'm Kobe
Shoot you like Ginobili
Sitting on the court side, never in the nosebleed
In the hot box yeah, with a hot Glock, yeah
In the trap car yeah, get your block shot, yeah
When it's time to blow smoke, we do not stop, yeah
Pulled up in paradise, they got them Glocks out, yeah (yeah)

[Pre-Hook]
Time to blast off, mask off like I'm mad dog
Turned it to a murder trap
Then robbed 'em for a bag dog
Police always fucking with a nigga 'cause I'm black, dawg
Full court press, we won't show your ass no slack, dawg

[Hook]
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it, nigga

[Verse 2]
Another nigga dead, now the family's scared
Tryna duck the feds, tryna duck the feds
Paint the city red, paint the city red
Glocks in the mattress, choppers in the shed
Broad day smoke, late night smoke
All day smoke, bitch we want the smoke
I'm from the east side where they cutthroat
Young niggas killing, and they taking dope
And they taking chain, they not taking names
Gang gang gang, nigga, gang gang
Pause the beat, free my niggas in the chain gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang

[Hook]
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
Run up the racks, I'm doin' it
