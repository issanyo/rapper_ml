[Hook x2]
It's alright, it's ok
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way

[Verse 1]
Got my grind on, came up errway
Roll this blame up, let's flame up errday
Got a side bitch, her name is Mary Jane
Bitches look like twins, Ashley [?]
Double [?] she nasty anyway
She gon' act like she classy till she see the cake
Never seen so many blue faces look at a face
Then she let me kill it
Now it's in a better place
Ain't no better feelin' than gettin' some better face
Nigga ain't no difference I just got better taste
Make another milli how I'm feelin' errday
Niggas in their feelings, I don't feel no type of way

[Hook x2]
It's alright, it's ok
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way

[Verse 2]
It's alright, it's ok
I'm gettin' cake like it's my birthday
Errday, 5 ways
Used to have split it up 9 ways
Nowadays crime pays
Niggas lookin' at you sideways
I bet they wish they would've did it my way
I'm gettin' high on the highway
You want it then you gotta go and get it, why wait?
Throw a couple dollars, watch the freaky bitches migrate
Told the bitch don't be thirsty, she might dehydrate
Bitch, everyday is my day
And I never gave a fuck about what they might think

[Hook x2]
It's alright, it's ok
Y'all hate, I'm gettin' paid
It's alright, I don't feel no type of way
It's ok, I don't feel no type of way
