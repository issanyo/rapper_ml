[Piece of 1st Verse]
Quarter million dollars cash in my guest room (turn up)
Thumbing through the bands, I be playin' with the check (flocka!)
Count a cool two mill' without breaking sweats
Bitch I'm always fucking flexing, wearing gold Rolex

[Hook]
I'm rocking Rollies, I'm talking three of those
Bad bitches, I got plenty of those
Diamond grill, I can't do the golds
I'm riding sixes, I can't do the fours
Keep it real 'til I die, put it on my set
Keep it real 'til I die, put it on my set
Thumbing through the bands I be playin' with the check
Keep it real 'til I die, put it on my set

[Verse 1]
Quarter million dollars cash in my guest room (turn up)
Thumbing through the bands, I be playin' with the check (flocka!)
Count a cool two mill' without breaking sweats
Bitch I'm always fucking flexing, wearing gold Rolex
Chinnin through this work, I don't have to benchpress
When it come to work, my dogs always love to flex (FLEX)
You see me, he a stone cold killer with the pistol (commando)
Run up in my stash house, your mama gon' miss you
Stay up on my grizzle, thumbing through a check (okay)
Stay a real nigga, I'm a put it on my set
Fell in love in fast cars since Gucci Corvette (yeeoom)
Nigga disrespect me, I'll just leave his ass wet

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
He ain't never been scared to a hundred on his head
Cash, that bastard, where his son is?(It's yo ass!)
If I catch you slipping, where my gun is?
I'm always fucking hanging with the Robin's
Thumbing through the bands, I be doing that
I'm a real nigga, bitch, break your fucking back
You a pussy nigga, you don't want no get back
I got robbed, bounce back, had to live with that
Same situation, get it how you live, bitch
Worth a couple of commas, you ain't even average
I'm flexing, Randy Savage
Free my nigga Boosie, I'm a fucking savage

[Hook]
