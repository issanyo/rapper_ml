And I only fuck with thick hoes
White ho, let's go, that's my type though
White ho, let's go, white hoes
And I only fuck with-
Let's go

She just need a nigga, ah, with a check though
Movin' too slow move to the left, ho
Movin' too slow move to the left, ho
Hurry up, we hoppin' on this jet though
And I only fuck with thick ho
I'm a skinny nigga, you see these tight clothes
Piped up, yeah, I'm piped, ho
Come and get piped for the night, ho
Designer drugs and I need some ice, ho
A lot of hoes, yeah, I need some condoms
Fuckin' with Young Carti, you'll get high, ho
You ridin too slow, are you high, ho?
Are you high, ho?
Come and sip some drank, pop some pills, come get high, ho
We been on a jet, we so high, we on fly mode
I be flexin' on these niggas, pop, but they pop mode
With my eyes closed

[Verse 2]
Ho, I'm flexed up
Lookin' like who next up, called your face up
I just got my check up, got my cash up
You can't get no check, cuz', get your bands up
Face down, ass up
Walk around the club with your hands up
Walk around the club, I'm no dancer
Keep that pole on me, I might just blam ya (Blatt-blatt-blatt)
Keep that pole on me, I told him man up (Blatt-blatt-blatt)
Walk inside that bitch, I made them stand up
I'm a walkin' lick, bitch, where your camera?
If she want that whole thing, I gave her sample
The way I stole that, bitch, like where your man go?
Fuckin' on this bitch inside the bando
Suckin' on this dick, they use no hands though
I just turned this bitch into my main ho

[Chorus]
And I only fuck with rich ho
And I only fuck with thick hoes
White ho, let's go
White ho, let's go
And I only fuck with thick hoes
And I only fuck with thick hoes
Black ho, let's go
Black ho, let's go

[Bridge]
And I only fuck with rich ho
And I only fuck with thick hoes
White ho, let's go
White ho, let's go
And I only fuck with thick ho
And I only fuck with thick hoes
Black ho, let's go
Black ho, let's go

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my main ho, take that dirty money, ho
To the bank, ho
First you flip a birdy, ho, make a name, ho
I go seven-thirty, ho
On the drank, ho (ooh, lean)
Like what you drank, ho?
I pour up that pink ho, Easter Pink though
All up in my Styrofoam, I'm on lean, ho
She say she so lonely doe
Lean on me, ho
I might give your bitch the bone, not no leash, ho
I just want lil' dome from a freak ho
I ain't with the cuffin', ho, that ain't me, ho
I just like to press a ho, like that me, ho
Feelin' in yo' chest, ho, that's OG, ho
Think I need a G4, this for me, ho
Designer shit, no cheap clothes
You a thief, ho
I throw out the bank roll
Then that thang go, uh
(Yah!)
