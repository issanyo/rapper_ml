[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Twisting fingers in the club, I'm a young nigga
I got them young niggas that'll hide your body parts
Pants sagging, flag hanging, I'm a young nigga (x2)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, most my niggas rob, they don't got a job
I got a couple young niggas that’ll take the charge
So I don’t bring a bodyguard, I bring my entourage
Stop the track, pause, R.I.P. to Camoflague
I'm 'bout to pull my yellow 'Rari out the car garage
I got some young niggas that’ll hide your body parts

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Twisting fingers in the club, I'm a young nigga
Got them old niggas saying I love that young nigga
Your whole clique buying shots, y'all some broke niggas
Pants sagging, flag hanging, I'm a young nigga
In the car, strapped up with them guns, nigga
We shooting at the police just for fun, nigga

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
My pants sagging low like a young nigga
I'm twisting up the dro like a young nigga
I'm in the club, thirty deep, like a young nigga
I'm still in the streets like a young nigga
Like a young nigga, this one for the young niggas
Where you from, this one for them young niggas
This one is for the young niggas
Where you from, nigga, this one's for the young niggas

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Ray Charles vision, screaming where's the competition
Lot of rappers on a carton, man, they swag missing
I'm on that young nigga shit, shiesty ass niggas at my shows rob for bricks
Gucci said I'm going hard, Flocka on this shit
Old-school swag, got these hoes on my dick
I'm a lotto pick, I'm like which girl to get
Pulled up on some onset, yellow and black whip
I'm on my Wiz Khalifa shit, I don't do no papers
Fresh up on them papers, haters catch the vapors
Shoes alligator, I'm talking about Jordans
She ain't got enough swag, shawty can't afford 'em

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
