[Verse 1]
Don't put me on no time, I ain't late (No)
Still rockin' Balmain and BAPE (BAPE)
Sit back and roll a whole eighth (Eighth)
Smokin' that shit to the face (Face)
All color coupes, different race (Races)
Skrrt on a car, hit a gate (Gate)
Ain't seein' no slime with the day (Nah)
Gon' tell her we come from the A (The A)
Stripper gettin' off, I ain't waitin' (Waitin')
Skrrtin' off in the fast lane (Lane)
Smoke a whole pack to the brain (Brain)
Slide in that Bentley Mulsanne (Mulsanne)
2018, a new Range (Range)
Thumb through the check, ease the pain (Pain)
Crack you a seal, pour a pint (A pint)
He goin' psycho, insane (Sane)
Doin' the shit that you can't (Can't)
Drip on your bitch like a saint (Saint)
I dropped a stack on my ring (Ring)
I'm 'bout to blow like a tank (Tank)
Wire that shit to the bank (Wire)
How much you want for that Wraith? (Wraith)
Twenty-four inches, and I'm finna skate (Skate)
Rollie, Sky-Dweller the face (Face)
Still gettin' them racks out of state (State)
Put that lil' bitch in her place (Place)

[Chorus]
I put them hoes in order (Hoes)
I put them hoes in order (Hoes in order)
I went and blowed a quarter (Blowed a quarter)
Diamonds is cold as water (Cold)
Diamonds is cold as water (Cold)
We're tryna own the border (Own the border)
Already sold her off (Yeah, damn)

[Verse 2]
Bring out them racks, I'ma bet it (Bet it)
Still shootin' dice at the palace (Palace)
All kind of coupes, come with gadgets (Yeah, yeah)
Young Gunna, he still livin' lavish (Young Gunna)
I treat these lil' hoes like some maggots (Some maggots)
They stick to the king like a magnet (A magnet)
And suck up on me, call me daddy (Call me daddy)
Slept first, I'll never forget it (They slept first)
You prolly didn't know she was with it (With it)
Now she drip from her mouth to the titties (Drippin')
Had to move, 'cause she fucked the whole city (Fucked the whole city)
Designer, that shit gon' be litty (Litty)
You a hater, why won't you admit it? (Why you won't you admit it?)
I mix pleasure with personal business (Business)
Want a verse, it's gon' cost you some Benjis (Benjis, racks)
I put them hoes in Jimmy (Hoes in Jimmy)
They tryna mow the millions (Mow, mow)
My OG was old and stingy (Ah)
Young nigga, I had to go get it (Uh, I had to go get it)
They wouldn't let me hold the fifty (Nah)
The clip put a hole in your kidney (Hole)
She play with her nose, look like Whitney (Uh)
And she hopeful for more than a penny (Penny)
Damn

[Chorus]
I put them hoes in order
I put them hoes in order (Hoes)
I went and blowed a quarter (Blowed)
Diamonds is cold as water (Cold)
Diamonds is cold as water (Cold)
We're tryna own the border (Own the border)
Already sold her off (Yeah)
I put them hoes in order (Hoes in order)
I put them hoes in order (Hoes in order)
I went and blowed a quarter (Blowed a quarter)
Diamonds is cold as water (Cold)
Diamonds is cold as water (Cold)
We're tryna own the border
Already sold her off (Sold her off)
I put them hoes in order
I put them hoes in order
I went and blowed a quarter
Diamonds is cold as water
Diamonds is cold as water
We're tryna own the border
Already sold her off
