[Intro: Future]
I got the birds chirpin’, both lines
Bentley or the Rari, they both mine

[Bridge: Future]
What’s the deal with that? No cosign
Leaving out the dealership, burning both tires
Jeopardizing these checks behind these gang signs
Came out of Lil Mexico, now I’m an icon
Popstar, whatever dog, I’m really him
I sit back and I plotted and waited, I’m going bonkers
Fishscale profits, I swear it made me a monster
Criticized the day when I came, and then I conquered

[Hook: Future]
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’

[Verse 2: Quicktrip]
Got a condo off of peach street
Got a bad bitch off of leaf street
She can’t call me, she got to meet me
Getting real money, call me Big Meech
Got my gang here from Peewee
Like my bricks clean, I’m a neat freak
Like a fuck nigga or the [?]
All you hear the pot sayin’ squeak squeak
Made a couple mil off the first pack
Got the hellcat then I fell back
I’m a young nigga making boss moves
One slip nigga, nigga cost you
Plug talk in codes
I want 36 for a walkthrough
I’m a street nigga, no Street Execs
They gon’ pay for it when they get the [?]
One thing about me, I’m solid
Me and my uncle talk in private
My plane gon’ fly and it’s private
These bitches know that I got it
I’m a hood legend, call me Master P
All the OGs gon’ vouch for me
All the old heads gotta shout me
I was 21, gettin’ ‘em for 33

[Hook: Future]
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’

[Verse 3: Quicktrip]
Make the bricks swim, call ‘em Michael Phelps
Got some bloods with me, crips on the left
Seen some niggas get right or get left
I’m a boss man, move by myself
I know Rio with me, nobody else
That nigga Future showed me he solid
He the first nigga to let a young nigga from the hood ride on a private
These hoes ain’t callin’ back yet
Ain’t no Wi-Fi, where the hoes at?
Yeah my uncle watch three B’s
Done told you I moved the B’s
You ain’t never had no real plug then you really can’t fuck with me
All the young niggas in my hood, yeah they still look up to me

[Hook: Future]
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’
And I got them birds chirpin’

[Bridge: Future]
What’s the deal with that? No cosign
Leaving out the dealership, burning both tires
Jeopardizing these checks behind these gang signs
Came out of Lil Mexico, now I’m an icon
Popstar, whatever dog, I’m really him
I sit back and I plotted and waited, I’m going bonkers
Fishscale profits, I swear it made me a monster
Criticized the day when I came, and then I conquered

[Outro: Future]
Don’t I got them birds chirpin’?
Don’t I got them birds chirpin’?
You can hear them birds chirpin’, both lines
Bentley and the Rari and they both mine
