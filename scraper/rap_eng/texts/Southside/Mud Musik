( Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame )

Half a pint for my two liter…
I just slow sip
Dis that mud drink, my rarri go hard in the paint
Pulled up flexin right, Hopped out flexin ice
Niggers would give their life, just to live my life
Bitches yelling loud, walking through the crowd
With a triple cup, p-p-pour me up
Bird Gang clique,Flags in the sky, walking through the crowd
With a triple cup (p-p-pour me up) I swear to god I’m in sky
Astronaut high, I’m that guy
Stacks on stacks, racks on racks
I keep mud on standby
Got some real niggers that you can’t even stand by!

( Hook: Waka Flocka Flame )

I just slow sip, p-p-pour me up
Styrofoam cup, t-t-tripled up
Dis that mud drink, four ounces in my one liter
Dis that mud drink, half a pint for my 2 liter
P-p-pour me up, styrofoam cup, Tripled up
Dis that mud music, dis that mud drank
Styrofoam cup, t-t-tripled upp

( Verse 2: Gucci Mane )

Styrofoam cup, we pourin' up

( Verse 3: 2 Chainz )

This that Kickstand campaign, over their heads like an airplane
Bring your girl to the club round me and my nigga's then she fair game…
I'm 2 Chainz, I’m too much
Every time I fuck her I give two nuts!
Everytime you see me, I'm with two sluts
I ain’t eatin' her out unless the coochi cut
Promethazine contraband, tell them folks we'll contraband
BrickSquad.. Duffle-bag, bunch of knucklehead nigga's saying fuck the feds
Got bread long like Subway, Louis' on, un-lace 'em
And I ain't talking money when I hit you with this one k.(Brrrap)
I need two more, two liters, I got bass like two speakers
It must be do-or-die, cause these nigga's out here po-pimping!
All we’re doing is slow sipping
I be on that codeine, got four zips
About to pour it on his ice-cream
