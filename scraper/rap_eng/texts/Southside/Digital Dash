[Intro: Future & Metro Boomin']
Metro Boomin' want some more, nigga
Yeah, yeah, get it, get it get it
My dope in the bushes
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Future]
I did the digital dash
I fucked that bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I sell that dope to your momma, though
Hot on the street like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'm a kid of my word
I hustle the first to the first

[Verse 1: Future]
These bitches be naggin' the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed up with racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack and I'm muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work, it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes, I keep em' comin'
Fuck all these bitches, I keep em' comin'
I pull up right now, I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You can't come around here, cause it's dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that car, trick
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got Bape on my back with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she latch on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom? We did it
I see how they counted us out
Bet they never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I poured up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it?
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treat me
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons

[Hook: Future]
I did the digital dash
I fucked that bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I sell that dope to your momma tho
Hot on the street like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'm a kid of my word
I hustle the first to the first

[Verse 2: Drake]
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don’t let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I’m Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might gone fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that’s making triple what I’m making, what a entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin, they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I

[Hook: Future]
I did the digital dash
I fucked that bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I sell that dope to your momma tho
