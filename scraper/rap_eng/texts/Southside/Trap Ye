Earrings template
Ball hard, ball hard
Gym play, gym play
Chick-Fil-A, kid play
Sensei, sensei
She shy, mid way
I'm fire, new day
Roll one, move
Blow the roof
Hundred proof
Hundred proof
Sit down, 10 rounds
10 pounds, been round
Turn around
Soldiers, soldiers
Make 'em spin round

[Verse 1]
Go boy
Four way
Boomin' doorway
Two hoes, foreplay
I'm broke, no way
She fire, whole play
I'm fire, whole hay
New whip, showcase
My money, my pace
Fuck you, you weak
I'm rich, I'm geeked
I'm ballin', I'm street
She jawin', no teeth
I'm gon' OT
They gon' OD
We in it so deep
We with it, no peace
I'm spinnin', no lease
More money, more beef
My niggas gon' eat
1000, no lease
My Rollie on fleek
Ran that, new V
New shirt, new seats
New cars, new freaks

[Verse 2]
Top money, I'm signed
We bunky, no runnin'
Fat ass, no stunnin'
We sick, so vomit
No lights, so amish
10 million, I promise
So honest, fuck goddess
Too modest, who shot him? We work
We work, she hurt
On syrup, more verts
More percs, no thirst
Broke nigga blow her
Big money, net worth
Fuck pussy, net first
Stay winnin', no curse
Big Glocks, good burst
Big waves, no surf
Good vibes, we lurk
We fuck, me first
We bought t-shirt
Pull up, be sure
Cuz' we brought hitters
And them hoes teachers
And I'm high, free bird
