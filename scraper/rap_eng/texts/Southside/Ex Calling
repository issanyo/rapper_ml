[Intro]
Scrolling through these mother fucking texts
They ain't say nothing but the same shit
Put that shit on do not disturb
Bitch I'm in the studio
Three in the morning I'm on "do not disturb"
My last little fling I put that shit in the dirt
Pop out the car screamin'

[Chorus]
I can hear my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
Why the fuck my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
I can see my ex calling
Hold up why my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
Why the fuck my ex calling

[Bridge]
I can see my ex calling
Oh no, now my next calling
I don't know why I stress all 'em
I just want the best out 'em

[Verse 1]
We been through some things yeah
Thought I could restrain ya
I don't wanna tame ya
Impossible to change ya
Every time I try to put the fire out it boosts the flames up
You text me like I called ya
Well I don't mean to stall ya
But I cannot afford ya
So I gotta ignore ya
Cause I just want to ball yeah and you just want to fall yeah
I pick up my phone what the heck
Coming at my neck
Tripping via text disrespect
I don't fuck with that
Can't put me in check
You the ex calling for the sex
Want me cause I'm next
I'm the future where the Percocets

[Bridge]
I can see my ex calling
Oh no, now my next calling
I don't know why I stress all 'em
I just want the best out 'em

[Verse 2]
There's something wrong with my hand
Can't pick up the phone, goddamn
Hope you understand
I can't have you fuck up the plans
And if you gotta choose then you better choose the other man
See I weighed out that good side and that bad side so I'm done
I broke it down it was crunch time got focused and we won
Your favorite rapper gon want to join it the dream team and we come
Don't do this shit just for fun
Do this shit just to run
Run it back like a punt
Run that shit like Chris Breez'
All these hoes is on me
All this ice on me
All these lights on me
Not really, I like to stay lowkey
But still all that vice is on me
Never been 'bout that bird talk
To me that's that absurd talk
Always been 'bout the splurge talk
Back when we used to Bird Walk
And knocked off of my course man that one time and I  swear
I never wanna go there
That's unless she got nice brown skin good credit man and long hair

[Bridge]
I can see my ex calling
Oh no, now my next calling
I don't know why I stress all 'em
I just want the best out 'em

[Chorus]
I can hear my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
Why the fuck my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
I can see my ex calling
Hold up why my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
Why the fuck my ex calling
