[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Southside
Sonny Digital
Yeah
Lil Purpp, Lil Peep
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Aye, I do what I want and they hate it (ah)
Yeah, I keep me a 10, not a basic
Aye, I put all the pounds in the basement
Aye, my bitch like a juice 'cause she naked
I see what they want from me
I keep me a tool, I'ma squeeze
I'm sipping, I'm popping on E
Shout out my bro Lil Peep
I flex on my ex's still
I'm popping on molly still
Trust nobody in the deal
I count up that money still

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
We droppin' drugs in the champagne
Cocaine on a weekday
Propane what I smoke
You say you're rich but you're broke
Damn, why the fuck you even spoke?
Yeah, I think I'ma die, no joke
Take a couple xans with the coke
She want me now but she didn't when I was broke

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
I think I'ma die, no joke
I sip 'til I overdose
All these bitches love the coke
Pull up on 'em, wipe they nose
I can't even feel the pain
I feel the lean in my veins
I fell in love with the gang
I fell in love with the pain
I need me a 'Rari coupe
Margiela all over my shoes
Bitches booted up the boot
Bitches booted in the booth
I can't even feel the pain
I feel the lean in my veins
I fell in love with the gang
I fell in love with the pain, yeah

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
Aye, I do what I want and they hate it (ah)
Yeah, I keep me a 10, not a basic
Aye, I put all the pounds in the basement
Aye, my bitch like a juice 'cause she naked
I see what they want from me
I keep me a tool, I'ma squeeze
I'm sipping, I'm popping on E
Shout out my bro Lil Peep
I flex on my exes still
I'm popping on molly still
Trust nobody in the deal
I count up that money still

[Verse 3: Lil Peep]
Pussy made me feel like, them drugs made me feel too
Tell me if you feeling this, baby, you know I'm feeling you
Pull up to the club with a bad bitch, see through
Dress on, I'ma fuck her twice like a redo
Fuck your boyfriend and fuck your friends too
I've been through a lot so I need two
Girl, I need you but I cannot believe you
I cannot believe you, so I fucked your friends too

[Outro: Lil Peep]
Yeah
