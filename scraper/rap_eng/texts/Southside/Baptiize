[Part I]

[Chorus]
Went and baptized my wrist in VVS', oh
Stackin' this mula up to Avatar
Bentayga, Rolls Royces, etcetera, etcetera
High profile drug dealers, oh
Canary yellow stones on the Amazon
I'm workin' every day like I'm the last don
Fuck the investigation, we some Talibans
And when it come to emotions, I'm playin' camouflage

[Verse 1]
Too bad, she want diamonds on her ankles (Uh)
Balencis when you wear them cross trainers with me
In Milano, all my money exchangin'
I gave her so much money she got my ex still claimin' me
I ordered the jet because I hope she ain't tryna frame me
I'ma keep a dirty stick, you ever think I ain't the same me
Got a Bel Air address, but this money never changed me
I stay next to Uncle Will, but I'm still the same me
I done seen Jada Pinkett sittin' out on her blanket
Came up around murderers and most of 'em shiesty
She was already bad, but my money made her feisty
She done been in love before, but I done got her icy
I done sold drugs before and couldn't bust out of Rice Street
I came from off the floor, you won't find no nigga like me
I done told you once before, you gotta say it's spicy
Makin' money is the only thing excite me

[Chorus]
Went and baptized my wrist in VVS', oh
Stackin' this mula up to Avatar
Bentayga, Rolls Royces, etcetera, etcetera
High profile drug dealers, oh
Canary yellow stones on the Amazon
I'm workin' every day like I'm the last don
Fuck the investigation, we some Talibans
And when it come to emotions, I'm playin' camouflage

[Interlude]
I'ma keep a dirty stick, you ever think I ain't the same me
I'ma keep a dirty stick, you ever think I ain't the same me
She done been in love before, but I done got her icy
High profile drug dealers, oh

[Part II]

[Chorus]
I need a freak on sight, I got ice on ice on ice on ice
I got ice on ice on ice on ice
Keep that white on white on white on white
Keep some white on white on white on white
We rockin' Rollies for real, we rockin' Rollies for real
We rockin' Rollies for real, we rockin' Rollies for real

[Verse 2]
I was just gettin' me some mula, I come from the streets and I jump on a Lear
I don't wanna do nothin' but profit, I see it, I want it, I cop it
I got several different options, you don't want it with these horses
You don't wanna get to poppin', you don't wanna start sparkin'
Ain't no renegotiatin', we ain't even tryna bargain
They runnin' out of the Ace, anything else, we don't even want it
Peep how we came up the interstate, peep how we never gon' lose
Peep how they peepin' and watchin' me runnin' off with everything that I do
We didn't do this for the fun, I didn't do this just to slack
I did it all for the love, I put the gang on the map
We takin' cash at the door, oh wait, you can't even get through the door
We rollin' up in the police face, we got some cash to blow
20 dollars for a gram, tryna stuff a 2.5 in a Backwood
Niggas know who I am all through your city 'cause they know the cash good

[Chorus]
I need a freak on sight, I got ice on ice on ice on ice
I got ice on ice on ice on ice
No you can't sit in the trap
Keep that white on white on white on white
Keep some white on white on white on white
We rockin' Rollies for real, we rockin' Rollies for real
We rockin' Rollies for real, we rockin' Rollies for real

[Outro]
You watchin' the style, bite on bite on bite
We don't want nothin' but some hundreds and 50s, some hundreds and 50s
(You watchin' the style, bite on bite on bite)
