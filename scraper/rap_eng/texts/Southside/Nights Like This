[Intro: Gucci Mane]

Night like this, on a night like this
On a night like this? On a night like this
On a night like this? On a night like this
On a night like this? On a night like this

[Verse 1: Gucci]

Might get that on a night like this, get car-jacked on a night like this
I don't wanna dap, but you know I wanna scrap, and you might get whacked on a night like this
On a night like this? Yeah my nigga on a night like this
On a night like this...

On a night like this a nigga might get killed, whack that nigga, give his ass the whole clip
Might send a bitch to attract that nigga. Tease that nigga. Distract that nigga
Ran off on the third, get killed on the fifth. Hit him in the head with the damn four-fifth
Later in the club he was smoking that piff', shot him in the head he ain't leave no tip
Got my lean in the car, (you) can't take no sip. Can't lean, can't walk, can't crawl, can't limp
One of them nights when you don't get right, don't fix your face then your ass get killed
That's what you get trynna act all stiff, coming up the hill too swift I'll rip one
Blood or a crip, (don't) give a damn. I'll hit one. If you don't got a gun, then you better go get one
One of them nights when I don't wanna fight, put your hands on me, and I'm ending your life
Say it to my left, cause you know it ain't right. Call me Tyronne, cause I know I ain't right
I'm the type of nigga that get in a fight, by the end of the night they'll be reading my rights
I got the right to shoot your ass on sight, I got the right to put an end to your life
If they rob you once, they'll rob you twice. You a pussy ass nigga, you ain't bout that life

[Chorus: Gucci]

On a night like this, on a night like this
On a night like this, man a nigga killed on a night like this
On a night like this, on a night like this
On a night like this, I'll kidnap your wife on a night like this
Car-jack me a nigga on a night like this, on a night like this
Might whack me a nigga on a night like this, on a night like this
Put some goons on a nigga, they'll be in your house on a night like this

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka]

Uh huh (where he at? where he at?), on a night like this you could lose your life
Uh huh (where he at? where he at?), on a night like this you could lose your life
Most my niggas rock red, some rock blue. Backdoor a nigga, leave him sick: bird-flu
Sell it in the two's, next flip by a coupe. You saying fuck me? Nah pussy nigga, fuck you
I'm still the same nigga on the blocks selling rocks, rule number 1 - don't fuck with the cops
50 for a show, 80,000 for the watch.  I'm a real game spitter, shawty slicker than a fox
With a phone call, boy I could get you hit. My niggas hold pistols like they legit
Send them killers at your ass, better hope they miss. You ain't bout that life, you just pop this shit
I could see through the mist, shawty snakes in the grass. Dropped out of school, still above my class
Real right now, even realer in my past. You don't like what I've become, shawty kiss my ass
I'm my own boss, that's why these niggas mad. Phantom ghost, paid it off cash, that's why they mad
Hahah, SQUAD, SQUAD, SQUAD, FLOCKA!

[Chorus: Gucci]

On a night like this, on a night like this
On a night like this, man a nigga killed on a night like this
On a night like this, on a night like this
On a night like this, I'll kidnap your wife on a night like this
Car-jack me a nigga on a night like this, on a night like this
Might whack me a nigga on a night like this, on a night like this
Put some goons on a nigga, they'll be in your house on a night like this
