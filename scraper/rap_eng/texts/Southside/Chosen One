[Intro]
Told y'all bro... It’ll never be a crew full of real niggas, like us
Get at me!

[Chorus]
Bought a couple ice cold chains 'cause of global warming
Go to Bottom's Up and watch these strippers straight performing
All my bitches foul, you can call them one and one
All my niggas with me so this is a 4x1
Got a bunch of Retro 5’s, you only got but one
All my rap niggas raw you bet not sleep on one
And we can have 10 cars we wouldn't drive one
'Cause we flying to the top since we the chosen ones

[Pre-Verse]
LDV the lifestyle, y'all basic muthafuckas would never understand that bruh... Check me out one time

[Verse 1]
Fresh nigga since birth, my waves wanna make you surf
Smoking some new weed, call that astroturf
Young and I'm getting it, that ass I'm feeling it
Bumping that new Gotti, I woke up in a new Bugatti
Each day new bitch, throw that pussy she pitch
You might see me on the news 'cause I just killed a snitch
Getting money so I can buy some weed by the ton
And I'm the first round draft pick ’cause these bitches say I’m the chosen one

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Fucking this beat like Lacey, Duval and I'm crazy
Like Kevin, I’m Spacey, smoking this weed, nigga I laced it
Drinking straight no chaser, stealing hoes like bases
Straight raps no braces, I'm the best embrace it
I told y'all niggas before, and I ain't gon say it no more
When I make it in the game, imma be flexing on y’all hoes
Hating when you see me, 'cause you can't stand my success
Sending threats at me, but I ignored the text
I'm the chosen one on these tracks so these beats I had to bless
You looking all confused, why your ass be looking perplexed?
Just a young Saint Louis nigga that's inspired by the West
I'm the fucking best, you clearly ain't see the S up on my chest
I'm the chosen one in this rap game, I was chosen by God
Going hard up on the mic and I stroke like A-Rod
All these fake niggas in the game you gotta watch
When I clock your ass nigga I'll be the one to watch

[Chorus]
