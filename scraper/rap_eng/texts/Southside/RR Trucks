LaFlare
And Pluto

[Intro: Future]
I looked the devil in his eyes like the Reaper
We start finessin', now we glidin' on 'em
I got a bag and cancelled my last ho
Got on 200, sit on the dashboard
You know them M&Ms we stash those
Brand new shoe laces for the transport
That double R truck, nigga we waitin' on it
That double R truck, nigga we waitin' on it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm Gucci Mane, La Flare and to diss me is risky
Future pourin' lean like it's motherfuckin' whisky
I'm the type of rich, they know I'm strapped but don't frisk me
It's 2016 I'm on my sixteenth Bentley
When I get a chance to vote, I'm votin' for Monica Lewinsky
'Cause I'ma paint her face like Leonardo DaVinci
Ain't nothin' special 'bout you baby I ain't finna miss you
Let the next nigga hit you, bitch I can't do nothin' with you
I'm the God of the trap so every verse is like a scripture
I'm picture perfect pay-per-view you still don't get the picture
I just want the cash, don't need the gas, not even a drop of liquor
I forgot your name, forgot your face, but won't forget to tip ya

[Chorus: Future]
That double R truck, nigga we waitin' on it
That double R truck, nigga I'm waitin' on it
That Rolls Royce truck, nigga I'm waitin' on it
That Rolls Royce truck, nigga I'm waitin' on it

[Verse 2: Future]
Used to run from the Task 'cause I had the glass on me
Nigga talkin' all bad 'cause I got this stash on me
I'ma pour out this lean like Ace of Spade, it's on me
You should see my Patek, lightin' up, I'm on fleek
I like my Freaks Niq, I like my money neat
She gave me throat, shawty couldn't have had no teeth
I'm sittin' in a black Lamb' but my cup pink
I did the transaction, 10 M's this week
Made a film, now I got to eat
I got a dealership at the crib
I got prescriptions sittin' in my system
Percocets, Mollies, they stay in my system
I gotta pour and pour for my mental
I gotta fly in a private, in general
Giorgio Armani, I'm the first one to get it
Me and Guwop be the first ones to get 'em

[Chorus: Future]
That double R truck, nigga we waitin' on it
That double R truck, nigga I'm waitin' on it
That Rolls Royce truck, nigga I'm waitin' on it
That Rolls Royce truck, nigga I'm waitin' on it

[Outro: Future]
I got a bag and cancelled my last ho
Got on 200, sit on the dashboard
You know them M&Ms we stash those
Brand new shoe laces for the transport
That double R truck, nigga we waitin' on it
That double R truck, nigga we waitin' on it
