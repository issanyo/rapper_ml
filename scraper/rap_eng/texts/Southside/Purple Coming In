[Verse 1]
That purple be coming in, yeah
I poured up a dirty Sprite again
I pop on these Percs and Vicodins
They check on that check like a Yeezy
Came from straight out them trenches, they greasy
Fuck a bitch I'm the shit, I don't need her
Fell in love with that drank and I need it
I sip out my cup and I need it
I grew up in the rut and I seized it
Sip the four of that Tuss' out in Cleveland
They can't blame me for takin' these doses
Poured it raw out the pint in the Fanta
Tryna dodge all these scandalous heathens
They never gone doubt me, now they believe me
They try to forget about me now I'm kinging
The greatest story ever told
These pretty hoes gettin' exposed
Got my styrofoam in my hand
Fuck all these bands up

Coming in, coming in, coming in

[Verse 2]
Walk into Barney's I'm drinkin' on yellow
Valet the four-door, a hundred at the door tho
I speak the lingo, they know ‘bout the lingo
Fuck you lil nigga, I'mma fill up arenas
Washin' the money at the cleaners, it's dirty
You drink out my cup and it's dirty, I come from the dirty
You drink out this cup and it's dirty
I got codeine in my bladder
I get it in like a real one
You whip in a Benz and they feel you
It's too much finnessin' you feel me?
I went at that money, no supervision
They love me the day they gon' really feel me
I see how they act when they playin' dirty
Forgivin' me, never forgettin' me
I know that paper gone be there, I stack it
A monster, a beast, I'm corrupted, a savage
That 2016 gotta have it
That bitch want Celiné, she can have it
Pay three for that purple, if you want it, you get it
Two dollars a drink, on that purp you can get it
Fuck on me, suck on me, baby lets pour up
Fuck on me, suck on me, baby lets pour up

[Hook]
