[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Okay, all I know is flex and stunt, seven different checks this month
Shawty sucked my dick, can't hit the weed, I need an extra blunt
Spare tire in the trunk, riding with a extra shunt
Spent your rent money at that Benihana restaurant
Gucci, Louis, Polo, diamond dancing, go-go
Whole squad flexing like that Arm & Hammer logo
Karate kicking, dojo, paparazzi photo
Aggravated flexing, got these niggas pleading nolo

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
We against being broke, Dirt Gang protest
We gon' stunting harder than the motherfucking Bowflex
On this shit period, come test
Waterfall money in the club, got your hoe wet
D-Bo

[Chorus: Lil Capp & Waka Flocka Flame]
You see the whole crew ball, pulled up to the mall
Bought everything we saw, this the life of a boss, watch us
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex
Ayy, you see them bands over here, everybody gotta check
Pulled up to the club, by the hoe, got wet in time to
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Came to the club, seven chains doing too much
Flat white Rarri paint, Waka Flocka Flame flexed up
Hopped out valet, smoking kush, boy, I'm fucked up
Two claps for my haters, put your cups up
White Remy Martin, but we buy it by the caseload
Smoke back to back 'til our motherfucking eyes closed
Paparazzi follow us everywhere go
He know, she know I be flexing, nigga
All this Remy Martin, I might mix it with some Ros√©
Heavy rotation on the radio, you get no play
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, go and get it, nigga
You dream about it, I live it, nigga
Flex

[Chorus: Lil Capp & Waka Flocka Flame]
You see the whole crew ball, pulled up to the mall
Bought everything we saw, this the life of a boss, watch us
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex
Ayy, you see them bands over here, everybody gotta check
Pulled up to the club, by the hoe, got wet in time to
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex

[Verse 4: Lil Capp]
You see them bands in my pocket got me walking bowlegged
I'm a Ace of spaces, nigga, you get more [?]
Try to outshine us? Nigga, you can forget it
It won't happen, y'all niggas better get some more lettuce
Cheese and the fetty 'cause you can't do what we do
Nigga, you a shrimp, boy, your whole crew seafood
Can't hang with the big dogs
Oh, you pissed off 'cause I got your bitch drawers
Tag Team, Kris Kross
Alley-oop to Flock, alley-oop to Slim
That means I pass them all, I'm balling out the gym
All I know is stunt, all I know is flex
Bitch, I got a check, shout out to my set

[Chorus: Lil Capp & Waka Flocka Flame]
You see the whole crew ball, pulled up to the mall
Bought everything we saw, this the life of a boss, watch us
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex
Ayy, you see them bands over here, everybody gotta check
Pulled up to the club, by the hoe, got wet in time to
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Flex, flex, flex
