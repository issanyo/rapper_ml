Married to the game, I got 5 rings nigga
Carried through the pain; that's what life brings nigga
You gotta show'em your glory; go be a man, man
Flip it on em like handstands, and keep swinging like Bam Bam
I'm riding round my side of town, southside to be exact
Outside my people strapped and inside got a regal pad
And a bad chick laying on her back like count that, count that
Got a bad chick laying right there like count that...
I bring it straight from the heart, arteries and the veins
All these leaves keep me sane, hard to see how we changed
Marathon Man Swain, nigga headed to the check
Let my dawgs get the rest, if your a boss you dont rest
I been low as a Reebok I been high as the treetops
Mamma say I should detox, lil mama want the sex
OK I'm certain whats next
Whip up the pussy like personal chef
Leave her with shakes like a person on meth
Blessed blessed blessed yes
I prayed for it i prayed for it i prayed for it i prayed
I slaved for it then paid for it then made more than I paid
I stayed for it then gave for it now look at what we saved
I knew I had to wait
But you just don't know how
I prayed for it i prayed for it i prayed for it i prayed
I slaved for it then paid for it then made more than I paid
I stayed for it then gave for it now look at what we saved
I knew I had to wait ...
Last night took a L, turned that bish into a lesson
Started with a ho, now I got that ho finessing
Bounce back game strong, I ain't even stressing
When the money fall down made it look like a recession
And this is just a session- i got one between my fingers
Had to tune her up, now I turned her to a singer
Married to the game I got 10 rings nigga
Moon walk in Balmain Billie jeans nigga
