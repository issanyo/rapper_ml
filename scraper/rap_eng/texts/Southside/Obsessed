[Hook: SD/Blood Money]
These niggas talk about money, but they never seem to got it
Man this shit don't make no sense
I fucked a lot of nigga's hoes
Got money by the load
Seen money, so I had get rich
I been whippin all week
I ain't had no sleep
Got a hunnid 8-balls on the strip
Got an alley full of cluckers
I'm a bad mothafucka, you can catch me with the 40 on my hip

[Verse 1: Blood Money]
Call me "Blood the Mechanic"
Way I'm whippin that candy
Fiens can't understand it
Got yo' bitch out her panties
Strapped up at the Grammy's
Niggas live with they Mammy
Give no fuck, I'm with the shit, banana clip at his family
I'm a dog wit it
All y'all gettin it
Kill all witness'
Bond outta prison
Got down, got the crack pot back-flippin
Water whippin, 3 fo' 10, fiens say I'm trippin
Nah, I ain't trippin, b-bullet holes drippin
I'm a Goon, been a Goon, y'all Scottie Pippen
Get a nigga knocked down from the penitentiary
Pop a pill, fuck a deal, Savage Squad livin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SD]
See me, I be different, all that stuntin' on hoes
I'm gettin' kinda fat because I ain't doing low
These bitches want me, she know her boy won't Glo
This money coming in, I got yo miss on a boat
This shit just crazy, cause you might get smoked
And you might not live another night
You got a gun and a knife
We got 2 30's, wanna fight?
Boy yo ass might lose another life
These niggas talk about money, but they never seem to got it
If we rob em do we leave his ass slump?
These niggas talk about money, but I always wonder
"if we rob him do we leave his ass wit nothin?"
