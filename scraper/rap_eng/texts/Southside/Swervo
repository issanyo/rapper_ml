[Intro]
Swervo, ayy

[Chorus]
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Your bitch wanna fuck 'cause I'm Swervo
I drive nuts 'cause I'm Swervo
Got the whip with the clutch and the turbo
Spent six bucks on a fur coat
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
My name's Swervo 'cause I be the G (G Herbo)
Used to do shows for a G
Came from toting gats over east
I'ma spend 30 racks on a piece

[Verse 1]
G Swervo, I keep a meat roll
Dracos under the peacoat
Heard the police was looking for me though
But I'm on a PJ with Squeezo
Remember I was just living illegal
Now the kids look at me like a hero
Told them I was just like 'em once before
Now my account got some commas and zeros
We ain't living on welfare no more
Im eating steak at the bistro
Foreign coupe with a red head lil ho
Lemme pull on her hair while she deepthroat
And I'm from Chiraq where it go down
Young nigga sheisty and low down
I'ma pull up and aim at your forehead
I took a foot shot with a four-oh round
Yeah you know I bounce back with that lil shot
Shit if you ask me it was a good shot
I'm from the 9, sendin' shots straight to the 5
Yeah I'ma call it a hook shot
And when I ride, 40 Glock right by my side
Fly past your whip, get your hood shot
Find out where a nigga hang, slide with the gang
Fuck around get your whole hood shot

[Chorus]
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Your bitch wanna fuck 'cause I'm Swervo
I drive nuts 'cause I'm Swervo
Got the whip with the clutch and the turbo
Spent six bucks on a fur coat
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
My name's Swervo 'cause I be the G (G Herbo)
Used to do shows for a G
Came from toting gats over east
I'ma spend 30 racks on a piece

[Verse 2]
Used to eat fried bologna, now I'm eating Rigatoni
G Wag' with my homies, might ride by my lonely
Two door with my bitch, me, her, and my stick
She tryna suck my dick, we got limo tint
And the Posto lit, AC out the vent
Traphouse pay the rent, P serves off the Sprint
Rap pay my mama rent, YouTube pay my ho rent
Merch will pay your ho rent, iTunes pay some more shit
Humble Beast, that's Herbo, Swervo talk that dope shit
Swervo talk that cash shit, money in that bag shit
Spent two K for these Versace glasses, on my swag shit
They call me Swervo 'cause I did that when I crashed my last whip

[Chorus]
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Your bitch wanna fuck 'cause I'm Swervo
I drive nuts 'cause I'm Swervo
Got the whip with the clutch and the turbo
Spent six bucks on a fur coat
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
Swervo, Swervo, Swervo, Swervo
My name's Swervo 'cause I be the G (G Herbo)
Used to do shows for a G
Came from toting gats over east
I'ma spend 30 racks on a piece
