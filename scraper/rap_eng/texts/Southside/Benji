[Intro]

[Verse 1: Wooh Da Kid]
I'm on a different chapter
You in another book
Came a long way from your neighborhood crook
Bounce that ass baby pussy wet and she thick
And I really mean it when I say she on my dick
So she on my "D.I." so I "C" her the "K"
Real hood bitch picked her up from 'round the way
Tattoos and pills, I'm a fuck her till she pass out
Bag full of Benji's, cause we fucking in my stash house

[Hook: Wooh Da Kid]
I keep it a Benji (what)
I keep it a hundred (what)
I keep it a Benji, nigga I keep it a hundred (yes)
I keep it a Benji (yes)
I keep it a Benji (yes)
I keep it a hundred, nigga I keep it a Benji
I keep it a hundred (what)
I keep it a hundred (what)
I keep it a Benji, nigga I keep it a hundred (yes)
I keep it a Benji (yes)
I keep it a Benji (yes)
I keep it a hundred, nigga I keep it a Benji

[Verse 2: Wooh Da Kid]
Niggas stealing swag I'm like fuck 'em all
Sacks sacks 5th Ave, I'm like fuck 'em all
Ball all day no drinking like a damn rutger
She suck me and my brother, now that's a blood sucker
All about a Benji, I keep it a hundred
Hating niggas envy, broke niggas dont want it
Hundred Benji's on your head, 10,000 in hundreds
Just because he had sticky fingers like onix

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ar Quest]
Hey y'all ain't never flex
I keep this shit on hundred
My shooters they stand by, my youngins they be gunning
See if they rob my... then I bust them
Like what then
These niggas pussy so fuck them
These niggas ass, I bust them
I ride around with that AR
My....
Twin towers Siamese
Five bloods that's five "B's"
Five bricks that's five keys
Five hundreds, get your stacks up
And I could get your body for 5 beads

[Hook]
