[Chorus]

Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act


I’m counting these hundreds
These niggas running
I’m 1500
Keep it 100

Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act


[Verse]


Back on the act
I’m counting these racks
I throwing up stacks
I shoot with air Macs
Your girl on my dick
She throw out her back
I said that’s a fact
Southside on the track
Counting these hunnids
They said I was nothin
Blue diamonds, no touchin
You girl was just fuckin
My pistol was bustin
I deal with Russians
Nobody love me
There’s no one above me
Woah
Runnin like Adidas on the track
I might go all Saipan or vegeta for the bag
All these niggas lurking and they stealing my whole swag
I might go young jeter how I ball on all these cats


[Chorus]


Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act


I’m counting these hundreds
These niggas running
I’m 1500
Keep it 100

Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act

[Outro]

Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act
Back on the act

(Fade out)

Back on the act
