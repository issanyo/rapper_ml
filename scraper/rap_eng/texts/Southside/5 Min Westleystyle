[Intro: Paul Pierce, Nick Wright, Cris Carter, Matthew Nemeth]
Jordan is the is the greatest player to ever play the game
So for LeBron to pass Jordan, he needs a time machine to go back when he passed him the first time. He can do everything Jordan could do, but better. He already done passed Michael Jordan as far as who's the best player ever
I disagree with Nick. Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball ever
