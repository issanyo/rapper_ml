[Intro: Tyga]
Zaytoven
Say I'm flossing, say I'm bossing
Now I'm flossing, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Tyga & King]
Yeah I'm flossing, flossing, flossing, flossing
Floss, floss, I'ma a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)
Say I'm bossing (I'm bossing)
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting
We at Bosonova
I'm bossing, I'm flossing
I'm flossing, I'm bossing
But this ain't Hugo Boss
Bitch we flossing, flossing, yeah we flossing, flossing
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting

[Verse 1: Tyga]
You had it, you lost it
You lost it, yeah you lost it
I found it, I got it, got the plug and the sake
My vanilla girl like chocolate
My chocolate girl like caramel
My caramel girl like dairy flavored
Drippin' like the faucet
I'm flossing, I'm flossing
I'm floss and flossing
She just got her ass shots, we into the soften
She bossing, she boss and send five texts at ???
Everytime we hit the mall, they should bring a coffin
I'm cocky, I'm flossing, put a porch to the Porsche
It can get exhausting, all this fucking flossing
Diamonds in my teeth, when I smile I sparkle
I should be a dentist, I could teach you how to floss it

[Chorus: Tyga & King]
Yeah I'm flossing, flossing, flossing, flossing
Floss, floss, I'ma a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)
Say I'm bossing (I'm bossing)
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting
We at Bosonova
I'm bossing, I'm flossing
I'm flossing, I'm bossing
But this ain't Hugo Boss
Bitch we flossing, flossing, yeah we flossing, flossing
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Called up some hoochies, I'm 'bout to throw a party
Where'd she get that ass, she got it from her mama
I'm saucy, I'm flossing, I'm saucy, balsamic
And I'm paid in full, I should be from Harlem
Just pulled up on Rocky, we both was in ferraris
Whoa kemo- (whoa kemo-), flossing is a hobby
And I'm on your TV, whoa hashetashe
All my ice is water, yours is wishy-washy

[Chorus: Tyga & King]
Yeah I'm flossing, flossing, flossing, flossing
Floss, floss, I'ma a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)
Say I'm bossing (I'm bossing)
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting
We at Bosonova
I'm bossing, I'm flossing
I'm flossing, I'm bossing
But this ain't Hugo Boss
Bitch we flossing, flossing, yeah we flossing, flossing
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting
