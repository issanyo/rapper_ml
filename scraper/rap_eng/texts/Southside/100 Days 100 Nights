100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 200 nights

I gotta get my money right

[Verse 1]
It's hard growin' up in the struggle
Apartment buildings, low budget, I turned nothin' to somethin'
My mama lived with her mother, I grew up with my cousins
In the streets been through soo much, cause I ain't runnin' from nothin'
Lil nigga with big attitude, I'm gon' do what I gotta do
You don't know how good it feels it to throw my mom's a stack or 2
Be gone for months, come back with food and right back on that avenue
Spent years on that avenue, shed tears on that avenue
My niggas made decisions and did bids for  that avenue, free Crazy James
Go to sleep, wake up with nothin' to eat, yeah that's a crazy thing
Sometimes I think I can just blink out this crazy dream
But reality it really ain't easy as I make it seem
Lost my nigga, why they off, my nigga?
I give it all up, what it cost, my nigga?
I ain't really ever give a fuck 'bout shit, but now  I ain't ever gon' cross my niggas
Say Kobe, without you in these streets feel like I'm lost, my nigga
Shed soo many tears, make me feel weak, but I ain't soft, my nigga

[Verse 2]
We ignorant, we immigrants, we murders, we prisoners
We burglars, we hustlers, you start it off, we finish it
Like fuck this rap, I'm in this shit, it's over, cause I'm killin' it
In the trap I'm like "fuck this", but I'm right back where I finished it
I'm a fly nigga, fuck a sack up, If I like that, make it right back
For my niggas, keep my mouth closed, I'mma make bail, I'mma fight that
Free T-Slick, free Lil Bruce, free G Gill cause he ain't tell
Took 20 years with no fear, then like 4 year get no mail
Like A money might call real, know it's all bad, but he's all well
But back to me, as long as I'm alive, that's all I got to be
I swear where Iâ€™m from, I'm happy from all the years a nigga got to see
All the bread I got to make, all the hands I got to shake
I'm tryna live it up, cause sad to say, I know I got a date
But for my mama sake, I just pray that it ain't right away
I got to see her better days
All the shit I put her through still put smiles up on her face
She worried when I leave the house with them cals up on my waist
Like she she know what's goin' down
Keep one in the head cause when it rains, I know what's pourin' down
I love my block, but when they ask I say I do it for my town
And money niggas hate, but then they mad when you don't come around
My niggas know what's up if you don't then move the fuck around
Move the fuck around, fool, 'fore lil Mally buck you down
My niggas know what's up if you don't then move the fuck around
Move the fuck around
