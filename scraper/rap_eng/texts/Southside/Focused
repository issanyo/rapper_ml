Yeah, Swervo
You know I'm in Miami right now, this the Miami section (Swervo)
It's the L.A. section, Chiraq section, you know?

Stay rockin' G Fazos, we got a hunnid G Fazos
Put the Maison Margiela's on, we callin' them the caps

[Verse]
I rock that Gucci shit and Prada (ayy)
Hit the scene lookin' like a million dollars
I was dead broke, made no excuses
Fuck, nigga, I don't wanna hear about it ('bout it)
I was on the block, you ain't care 'bout it
When they killed Roc you ain't care 'bout it (care 'bout it)
Now I'm on top, tell me how, nigga lookin' for me
Turn my phone off on everybody
Since they killed Cap, I been B's, B's
Flame the opps up with a red lighter
Keep your bitch on her knees
She ain't got potential to wife her but fuck it, her head like it (woo)
Bitch ain't fuckin', why you on my bed like it?

Handle your business, young man, how you do all that shit independent, and win? Ayy
Count up them digits again, every month I get residuals in
Here for the hustlers, stack all the shit that come in, and take care of your mama (take care of your mama)
Take care of your children, take care of your niggas, stay out that drama (for real)
Go watch everybody, the moment they do somethin' funny, then fuck 'em (for real)
Nigga run up on you, then buck it (for real)
Kill a fuck nigga, it's nothin' (ayy)
Wanna run with me? It's nothin'
Ran it up, a milli with nothin' (with nothin')
I don't cooperate with the police, I ain't tellin' 'em nothin' (I ain't tellin' 'em nothin')
I'ma blow this bitch in public, fuck it
Yeah, that ain't no discussion
I ain't with none of the bluffin'
I ain't with the yellin' and arguin', fightin' and tusslin' (at all)
I'ma just up, get to bustin', buyin' out whatever, who want it? (who want it?)
Nigga want smoke, we on it (we on it)

And I put in work by my lonely (my lonely)
Get put on a shirt if you wanna (get put on a shirt)
Whole lotta haters, I know it (I know)
Wish I still had work on the corner (wish I had work on the corner)

In the stu', gotta lil' twenty on me (gotta lil' twenty on me)
In the field gotta watch for the phonies
Kobe told me to watch for the homies
Man right now I just gotta stay focused (stay focused)
Then put somethin' on the block for the homies (uh)

[Chorus]
Tell all my real niggas, "stay focused" (stay focused)
All my niggas fightin' time, stay focused (they focused)
If you do it for the fam, stay focused (stay focused)
Tryna slam a lil' cuz, they bogus (they bogus)
Out my room window, see lakes and the ocean
'Member couldn't sleep, seein' rats and roaches (seein' rats and roaches)
Yeah, but let you tell, nigga, it was all fame and fortune (it was all fame and fortune)
Tell all my real niggas, "stay focused" (stay focused)
All my niggas fightin' time, stay focused (they focused)
If you do it for the fam, stay focused (stay focused)
Tryna slam a lil' cuz, they bogus (they bogus)
Out my room window, see lakes and the ocean
