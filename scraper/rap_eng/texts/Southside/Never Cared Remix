[Verse 1]

Before I make a move I think ahead
Rapping bout your opp won't get you bread
Indictments in them raps inform the feds
Now you out there flatlined with a body full of lead
I took the hustlers route instead
I’ll leave a bitch won't ever beg
I know my cards I play my hand
Lay hand on one of mines and it get uglier than meg
The whole family guy
Even the dog as well
We know what's real and what’s pretend me and my dogs can tell
Don't claim your dog your dog when your dog will tail
Life a bitch and that bitch made me hard as nails
Masonry
Detectives out tracing me
It's not mistakenly
Black charger changing speed
Makes me angry
In Knoxville
They pulled me called the K9's up
Scratch my car up
On rock I should've kicked that mutt
Fuck
They asking bout bucks
And drugs and such
Like I'll be dumb to use my car for a move to buss
They asked questions bout associates
Convient amnesia
Phone going crazy shit shaking like seizures
It's my OG
I'm fine mom
Stash good for a high bond
I’m move in silence
But the moves I’m making sound ticking like a time bomb

Protegido con el ala de mi angel

[ Verse 2]
Vamos!
Rappers always talking to Diego
But they don't even speak el tipo lingo
(No)
Mi hermano told me watch from all the angles
El juego esta encerrado Kurt angle
No estamos cortados por el mismo de mantel
Canciones adictivas como un betel
Mi escuadron en la puerta como un dintel
Remember days when I had to mis meals
Starving, homeless all that
Sleeping at rest stops
In my Pontiac
When I spit man this shit more than rap
I went super broke then got a bag I’m not going back
2019 I'm not holding back
Nah..
