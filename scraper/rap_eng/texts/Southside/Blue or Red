[Hook]
All my niggas sell dope, all my niggas gang bang
Where you from, what set you claim
Who your partner, where you hang
Still that old me, I ain't changed
Still grab them chopsticks, go insane
Wish you disrespect the set, I turn your block into a range
Hangin' out that window with that stick
Extendos for my clips, nigga
Can't war with no rich nigga
I drop a rollie on your motherfuckin' head
Ride on a nigga, it don't matter blue or red
Blue or red, blue or red
Ride on a nigga, it don't matter blue or red
Blue or red, blue or red
Ride on a nigga, it don't matter blue or red

[Verse 1]
BrickSquad got the best dope, all my niggas cut throat
Bangin' like the West Boast rob 'em just to stay afloat
Punch him in his face for that motherfuckin' necklace
Wrong gang sign, we gon' eat 'em like some breakfast
'X' that nigga out, another nigga off my check list
Been rocking Nikes, can't no motherfucker check this
Hire BrickSquad if you really need protection
My young niggas reckless, they shooting at detectives

All my niggas sell dope, all my niggas gang bang
Where you from, what set you claim
Who your partner, where you hang
Still that on me, I ain't changed
Still grab them chopsticks, go insane
Wish you disrespect the set I turn your block into range
Hangin' out that window with that stick
Extendos for my clips, nigga
Can't war with no rich nigga
I drop a rollie on your motherfuckin' head
Ride on a nigga, it don't matter blue or red
Blue or red, blue or red
Ride on a nigga, it don't matter blue or red
Blue or red, blue or red
Ride on a nigga, it don't matter blue or red

[Verse 2]
I'm still screamin' "Fuck cops"
Shooter like I'm Boss Top
Send them boys from O'Block to come shoot up your whole block
In your building lurking through the halls like a cough drop
Big homie Flock, I still call all the shots
Got a gun like RoboCop
I crop you out, no photoshop
I ain't shooting at no legs bitch, I'm aiming at the top
And I'm taking off fades, niggas know I love to box
You with this gangsta shit or not
We beat his ass then stomp him out
Squad!
