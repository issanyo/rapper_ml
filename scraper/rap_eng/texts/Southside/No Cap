[Intro: Future]
Southside on the track, yeah
Haha
We just choppin' it up
Yeah

[Verse 1: Future]
Take it out the bank, go put it up
Got my main ho put up
Straight off the lot, go put it up
My last two foreigns pulled up
Straight out the bank, go put it up
Everybody in the hood gon' pull up
I got 'em on Xans and the Roxy's
The homie done ran with the thotties
Every week I change my closet
Got a Fendi store in my house
Got a Bentley garage in my house
Got a watch on my wrist, cost a house
My bitch can't sleep at my house
Make her sleep at a hotel now
And when you talk, man, you talkin' all cap
And your diamonds, they lookin' like tap
I was always duckin' from the paps
Keep an R&B bitch in my lap
Out in Beverly Hills, I adapt
But I still had to ride with that strap

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Yellow diamonds like banana, that's cap
Put some dirt in Mello Yello, no cap
Rockin' Maison Margielas, that's cap
Red bitch, Cinderella, no cap
I can turn perro
I can turn petrol
Bad bitch out a ghetto
East Lake Meadows
I was 'bout to get better
Still trappin', fuck Berettas
Rolls Royce umbrella
Gettin' dome at Coachella
Yeah, hop out the coupe and titty-fuck her
Yeah, free Bobby Shmurda, motherfuck the Rikers
I'ma lean back in the 'Bach, she suck like lolli-suckers
I lied when I said I love her
Backstabbed the bitch, like I'm Myer Michaels

[Verse 3: Future]
My lil' blooda keep a stick on the seat
He gon' brrrt, brrrt, brrrt 'til your heart stop beat
I'm a Zone 6 nigga and I'm riding in a foreign
Fuck a bad yellow bitch anytime I get bored, nigga, uh
I'm a giant on these streets, nigga, uh
Switch my bitch once a week, nigga, uh
One-point-five in my Goyard, uh
Gon' need a way bigger surfboard, uh
I bust down my plain Yachtmaster with bezels
I flew her out to Vegas, swear to God, forgot to hit her
I made 'em quit they jobs, then I gave 'em to my niggas
I gave her a little start-up money and put her in a rental
I send my Ethiopian to go pray at the temple
I flood her heart with diamonds, just to pray, it's so expensive
She tastin' holy water, so for me, it's beneficial
She caught the holy ghost when I gave her the Presidential

[Outro: Young Thug]
Rockin' Maison Margielas, that's cap
