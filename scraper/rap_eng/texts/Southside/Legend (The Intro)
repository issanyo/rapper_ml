[Intro: Kanye West]
I wanna go to Africa, I'm standing up and I'm telling you I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney, Nike, Google. Now who's gonna be the Medici family and stand up and let me create more? Or do you want to marginalize me until I'm out of my moment?

You ain't got the answers man! You ain't got the answers!
You ain't got answers! You ain't got the answers!
I been doin' this more than you!
You ain't got- You ain't got answers! You ain't got the answers!
You ain't been doin' the education

[Verse]
Yeah, I said
I ain't never listen nigga
That's why I got millions nigga
Niggas talk a whole lot
We don't really feel them nigga
Me and mine don't deal with niggas
Plenty hoes, don't chill with niggas
Really fell in love with figures
I just made a beat for Jigga
I'll never turn on mines
Stackin' money, time flies
One hundred K, ten times
Trap Ye, I didn't sign
I'ma fuck her insides
Never will I switch sides
Youngin say he really with it
I can see it in his eyes
Know a nigga stay committed
I'ma blessing in disguise
Lam or the Rari nigga?
Help a nigga choose sides
Niggas try to hold the kid
Let a nigga move by
Really want to trust a bitch
Keep it real, she too shy

[Outro: Kanye West]
Ain't nobody ever broke down. Ain't nobody broke down. We all slaves. you ain't spend 13 million dollars of your own money trying to empower yourself!

Integrity, money and relevance. This is the moment in the matrix bro, the vines is back!
