[Verse 1: Avatar Darko

We ride around with them Robocop toolies
A little purp deuce turn the soda pop blue
Your bitch see me balling like a sky box view
No wrinkles in my damier, Botox flu
All these bad bitches flocking would have swore they were some seagulls
I be working in her deeper than Latinos at Home Depot
Wake up skip the Listerine go straight to the Clicquot
I ain't shit yet bitch but to you I got a ego
Look, AK-47 that's my main bitch?, she left me for the ocean cause I can't miss?
That's T.M.I. my lawyer probably pissed
I'm just tryna see more S's than a gay lisp
Double S's on the 'Maro, Double S's on the payroll
Talking ? to that Salvatore Faro'
'Gamo bout denero I'm so pronto
Got air holes on the chopper
It go rah rah if it's rif raff in your convo
Look, she gave me 30 racks, I ain't kiss her once
She's my mistress I just pop up every couple months
She just blow my socks off then she rubbed my feet
She said boy you taste like fruit but you are nothing sweet
(Blao!) Sincerely Darko Blazevich
Man I cut these ho's off I never chase a bitch
Vertigo, told her "Hit the deck!"
Convertible got a turtle neck
I'm at the terminal bout to board a jet
(We're like bahhh)

[Hook: Avatar Darko & Nacho Picasso]

When you see me on the block
Counting quotas sipping Stoli
Just know I got that Glock on me
I be on them backstreets
Smoking kush going fast windows down
Just know I got that chopper on me
I'm a scumbag, I'm a dirtbag
I be all over the place I bet you heard that

[Verse 2: Nacho Picasso]

She be clinging to the balls of a scumbag
Nachos I be poking at her walls like a thumbtack
And that's hell or high water like young slacks
Busting brats all over your bitches fun bags
She love the dick she blowing it like a comeback
She ask my balls if they'll ever get her tongue back
I'm a asshole, thumbs in her but crack
Fuck fag, you spit everything but crack
Fuck rap duct tape up your rugrat
Tell-tale heart, body's where the rugs at
Minion? Ave kids ask us where the drugs at
I got the Glock Av' tell me where the snubs at (right here)
Swear to Godzilla, I'm fly as Mothra
Sniffing waka, getting tatted on my chakra
I been a problem since "Boom Shakalaka"
My way I've been doing my Sinatra
21 Jump street, doing my piñata
My bitch possessed she doing that stigmata
That's when I hit her with that hasta mañana
My autograph hangs up in Benihana's
Moor Gang, Fang Gang, what it do hooker?
She not a bitch nor a cunt? Guess we mistook her
Nacho P, I'm a fucking piece of trash
You can think it, if you speak it I'mma come and beat your ass
