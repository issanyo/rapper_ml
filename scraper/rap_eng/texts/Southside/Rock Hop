[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
You know the name, Waka Flocka Flame
Drunk, crunk, and off the chain 'cause I'm a wild boy
Two pistols on my hip like a cowboy
Beat his ass up, the crowd like, "Oww, boy"
Who hotter than us? So Icey Rock Boys
Beat your ass up, make your eye vision rock, boy
Flock, boy, duck, boy, he a rock boy
Tats like a biker, I'm a rock boy

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Hex-O]
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Let's party! Everybody, let's
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Let's party! Everybody, let's

[Verse 2: Hex-O]
I rock, I drink, I party, go hard
In the back of the bar, V.I.P., I'm a star
I pop, I smoke, I ain't no joke
I'm up in smoke, on fire 'til I croak
I mosh, I pit, I just won't quit
I'm on a roll, man, what, you can't tell me shit
I get it, I got it, you better it right
Broken glass bottles stayed throwed all night
Wake up with the bottle cuts tight in my grip
No matter how fucked I get, you'll never see me slip
Pump your fist, get amped like this
Yes, I'm tatted up, from my chest to my wrists
Hex-O, Waka Flocka do the thing like this
Gutter in the game, maintain like this
Jump off the stage, bussing skulls like this
The club owners mad and security pissed

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Hex-O]
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Let's party! Everybody, let's
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Let's party! Everybody, let's

[Verse 3: Wooh da Kid]
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Man, this kush, is so, loud
I'm geeked, I'm fucked up, I'm bent, down
My lungs, is gone, I blew, pounds
My Glock 4-5 for the wild boy
I've been that way since a child, boy
D.C., snipe from a mile, boy
Just mean mug, we don't smile, boy

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Hex-O]
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Shake, your head, and act, wild
Let's party! Everybody, let's
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Drink, smoke, then get, wild
Let's party! Everybody, let's
