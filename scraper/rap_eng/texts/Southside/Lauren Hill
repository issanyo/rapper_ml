(Verse 1)
I need 3 million bitch
Bought a brand new lamb just so I can park it
Told a bitch to bend it over let a nigga pork it
Niggas cuffin
And you niggas ain't shit
Pull up on em niggas new ferrarris extra horses
I swear this molly got me geekin I been hearin' voices
What you
Told my momma imma get it talkin top of Forbes list
I been ballin like a bitch I might go buy the hornets
She been suckin' on my dick I swear it's gettin borin'
Imma put er a Uber while another board it

(Chorus)
Way up the hill like I'm miss Lauryn
Said I'm way up the hill like miss Lauren
Way up the hill like I'm miss Lauren
