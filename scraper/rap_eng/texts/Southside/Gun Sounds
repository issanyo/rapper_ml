Ring alarm, them boys in the town
Like Joc, lay that pussy nigga down
I don't talk, I don't laugh, I just frown
From the eagle to the chopper, love that gun sound
Love that gun sound, love that, love that gun sound
Love that gun sound, love that, love that gun sound
Love that gun sound, love that, love that gun sound
Love that gun sound, love that, love that gun sound

[Verse 1]
Run up on Gucci, you might lose your life
I'll do 7, you in Heaven, I won't think twice
Murda Man Flocka, I keep a heavy chopper
I'm down with So Icey, I'm a real top shotter
Light skin Rasta, move like the mobsters
Rob your ass for ganja, so give it up, partner
I hang with the killers, we go ape like gorillas
Yes, we gonna rob you and then we might kill you
Shot his ass at breakfast, eating some cereal
Bow! Flocka
Waka Flocka
Ay, Eazy you hear this shit?
Ay, Gucci you hear this shit, man?
Gangsta rap back, this murder

Love that gun sound, love that, love that gun sound
Love that gun sound, love that, love that gun sound
Love that gun sound, love that, love that gun sound

[Verse 2]
We street thugging, what the fuck is corporate thugging??
Homie better stop all that mean mugging
I say 2 words: shawty, bust
Love the trap, love to cuss
I will talk to a nigga 'fore I put them in the dirt
Tell them what the fuck he did and why the fuck he getting murked
50 rounds flat make your lifeline flat
.45 a nigga quick, call that head crack
I'll fart a nigga quick, I'll leave his ass stinking
Murda Man Flocka, what the fuck these niggas thinking?
Point blank range, do this shit without blinking
I'm thinking to myself, why the fuck these niggas hating?
