If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga

[Verse 1: m0ney.marc0]
If you ain't got no haters u ain't poppin
If he holdin on that work them hittas rob em
My boys ready for that war if it's a problem
Bring my hammer camera out and he'll solve em

All that hating is apparent don't understand it
And bet when I get them bands Imma leave you stranded

All these haters wanna do me and shoot me like a movie
But see I'm the 3rd damnation while yall still in 2d
I swear u is a groupie boy i swear you is a coochie
And I been up in the game while you still a noobie

What I spit is true show u what that choppa do

We be balling hard take yo girl to Malibu
If he run up they gon spray em like confetti foo
