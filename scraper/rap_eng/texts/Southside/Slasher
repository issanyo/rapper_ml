[Intro]
Southside on the track, yeah

[Chorus]
Damn, mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, that bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I been runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I been pourin' that Act’ up
Mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, the bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I'll be runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I'll be pourin' that Act’ up

[Verse 1]
She turned me to an activist, Actavis
She told me that she broke my heart on accident
We California-catin’, that’s my residence
I’m turning into Satan, kill the evidence
I fall in love easy, that shit evident
I’m takin' codeine with all my medicine
She doin’ morphine to numb the pain again
Feelin' like Prince with Purple Rain again

[Refrain]
I say the right things at the wrong times
Her head's fucked up, snort the wrong lines
Remember when you said you were all mine?
“All mine” turned to all lies (all lies)

[Chorus]
Damn, mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, that bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I been runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I been pourin' that Act’ up
Mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, the bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I'll be runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I'll be pourin' that Act’ up

[Verse 2]
Damn, mayday, mayday, I need two cups
I get so damn high, I don’t feel much
I say, kids, do drugs, but don’t do too much
Last time I heard that I did too much
Too much isn’t enough, I’m not giving a fuck
I’m done believin’ in love, yeah I’m givin' it up
I fell in love with the lean, shit be slowin’ me up
But keep on pouring me up until the pain numbs
I’m popping perc-ys, until I throw up
You don’t know me, you may know of me
So what, I’m giving no fucks
Say you get real love
I say, “Bitch show me”

[Refrain]
I say the right things at the wrong times
Her head's fucked up, snort the wrong lines
Remember when you said you were all mine?
“All mine” turned to all lies (all lies)

[Chorus]
Damn, mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, that bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I been runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I been pourin' that Act’ up
Mayday, mayday, I need backup
She broke my heart, the bitch a slasher
In the meantime, I'll be runnin’ the racks up
In the lean time, I'll be pourin' that Act’ up
