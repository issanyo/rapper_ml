[Hook]
Sometimes
Through the clouds I can see the sunshine
And through the downs I can see the upside
I see your frown cause you've had hard life
But it's okay because we all go through some hard times
I done been there before
Went down that road
I can't steer anymore, no
But, baby, sometimes

[Bridge]
Sometimes you need some love
Sometimes you need a friend
Sometimes you need a hug
So, baby, bring it in
To let you know I'm here, girl
Go ahead and dry them tears, girl
Sometimes you want to cry
Sometimes you want to hide
Sometimes you need a man
To teach you how to fly
So go and spread your wings, girl
And when you landed on your feet, girl

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm fucked up, down bad
Hyperventilating in a brown bag
I've been staring in the damn mirror tryna find me but all I see is a clown, man
You's a clown then
Ain't no halo over my head, only dark clouds there
