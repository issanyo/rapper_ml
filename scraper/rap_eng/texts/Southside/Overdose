[Intro]
This shit, this shit, this shit, it's like Velveeta
You see what I'm sayin'?
It's, it's, it's overload, overload, overload

[Chorus]
Swag overdose (Yeah), swag to the most
Bodybag Dior, as well as Saint Laurent
Balenciaga, run it up (Balenci'), pop collar with a slut
Top shotta in the guts, double M, it's a must
Maybach, sippin' mud, matte black with the guts
Blasted off, enjoy it, blast off in a toy
They gon' really get destroyed, they gon' really get employed
Transport a lot of guns (Uh huh), take a bad bitch to lunch (Uh huh)

[Verse]
I'm too rich to be sober
I done fucked off in Gucci, I done bought over ten Rovers
Gave a thousand bags to the soldiers
I done put a lot on my shoulders (Yeah)
I ain't holdin' out, I'm the coldest (Ain't holdin' back)
I ain't holdin' back, I'm devoted (Ain't holdin' back)
You can be the wave, I'm the ocean (You be the wave)
I done ran away with the bands (Yeah)
I done fucked the face of a fan (I fucked her face)
I done gave away a Cayenne (I gave away)
Got the whole world takin' Xans (The world)
Ben Franky out the gang gang, turnt up to the max (The max)
My lil' goon made a million dollars, now she ain't gettin' whacked
My wrist must be on drugs, my ears must be on drugs
My chain must be on drugs, I'm lookin' like I'm on drugs
My right pocket got drugs, my left side pocket got drugs
My pinky finger on drugs, I'm flooded out on drugs

[Chorus]
Swag overdose (Yeah), swag to the most
Bodybag Dior, as well as Saint Laurent
Balenciaga, run it up (Balenci'), pop collar with a slut
Top shotta in the guts, double M, it's a must
Maybach, sippin' mud, matte black with the guts
Blasted off, enjoy it, blast off in a toy
They gon' really get destroyed, they gon' really get employed
Transport a lot of guns (Uh huh), take a bad bitch to lunch (Uh huh)

[Outro]
Blast off in a toy (Uh huh)
Whip the soft 'til it's hard (Uh huh)
Sadity shit like McCartney (Huh)
My whip crazy in the Forgis (Uh-Huh)
All my white bitches like it (Uh-Huh)
Sendin' a tip where to strike it (Uh-Huh)
