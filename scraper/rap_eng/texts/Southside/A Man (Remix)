[Intro: Indica & MadeInTYO]
Yeah ah yuh

Niggas be actin' like act like, a lil dâ€”

[Hook: Travis Scott]
People tryna say I'm only into me
Got a code with my dawgs, can't get in between
I can't give them life, no more energy
Man, man, a man

[Verse 1: Indica]
How do I feel?
I don't feel nothing
Bought her a meal
After our fucking
Wining and dining
Then I declined it
I love to chase it
Cook and I bake it
She think I'm famous
I cannot blame her
That baddie basic
Instagram famous
Put you on spot
(?)
I cannot freeze
I sip teapot

[Hook 2: Indica]
Yuh yuh
Two drugs
One hand
One man
A man

[Verse 2: Indica]
Looking at my wrist today
Just met a bitch today
She sucking dick today
It's hella lit today

[Hook 2: Indica]
Yuh yuh
Two drugs
One hand
One man
A man
A man
Yuh yuh

[Verse 3: Indica]
Indica all on her wish list
Indica all on the VIP list
Indica all on the guest list
I just put myself all on the flex list

[Hook 2: Indica]
Yuh yuh

Yuh yuh
Man man
Man man
Two jugs
One hand
One man
A man
