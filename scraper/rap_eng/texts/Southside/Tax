Gang, gang...
CYN is on the rise...

As for the fee, know, its a tax
They sendin' shots, we gon react
Party all white, we come in black
All in my biz, check my location, see where i'm at
I'm on the gram, showin' my face, never the snap
They show me love, they giving hugs, they giving daps
Niggas is sleep, we let em rest, go take a nap
Chasing the bags, never get stuck, watch for the traps

[Verse 1]
Overtime with the shifts
7 days out the week
Everything got a price
Live my life, I ain't cheap
Whole team like the socks
So we all been elite
Stand up tall on my feet
How you ball from the bleach'? (Aw shit)
I gon be honest, never be modest
High school finished with honors
Made it to college, working my hardest
Bet I go get it regardless
Fuck your job, and yo 'pinion
We never needed permission
We will not split no division
We do not live with a limit man
Been that nigga, still that nigga, shit don't change
Bitch ass niggas gon take shoots, fix yo aim
This champagne, we pour down, shit like rain
Take up lanes, with my god, same old gang

[Verse 2]
New shit on the way
Word to bank roll
Niggas can't fold (aye)
Fuck what niggas gotta say (aye)
Send some goons to your place (aye)
See I'm just tryna make a play (aye)
Niggas ain't know the game go
Fuck you mean, they talking crazy
Well think its time they meet the pavement (yea, yea)
Niggas jealous cause the numbers up
Same ones tryna run with us
I could care less bout you runnin' up
I'm still in the set countin' hunnids up
Boy you nigga straight flooky
Remember when we was selling hoopties
Real jack boys school me
So no remorse for a goofy
Don't sleep, niggas talk tough but don't be
I was raised by some real made men, prolly slapped your damn O.G
So you niggas don't know me
From the bay, not Oakland
I see an opp, I'mma smoke em
Just say a prayer and keep it going
