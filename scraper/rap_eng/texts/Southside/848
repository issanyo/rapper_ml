[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Half of milli all in the bag, if this was Philly they would say I'm in my bag (Meek whattup?)
Quarter milli with the paper tag
And I keep the nine milli playing laser tag
Condo in Miami that's my favorite pad
Watching Rondo vs Miami he just made a pass
Gotta coupe it when we racing past
Body stupid with a crazy ass (hey baby)
High heels, red bottoms
And I miss my nigga Zoe for real cause the feds gottem
You doing 30 pray for 65 percent
In a car dirty, bitch you know im riding bent

[Hook]
Kingpin, 848, lights camera action, first 48
Fly bitches, meet me at the bar
And when they catch us we gonna get the biggest charge
Kingpin 848, sex money murder, first 48
Live niggas buy the biggest cars
And when they catch us we gonna get the biggest charge

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Still slanging cocaine boy, still gang bangin' with my gang boys
Swagged up, still rocking big chains boy
Who wanna hear that chopper make noise?
I'm smoking dope, straight out the gas mask
It's big b's nine tray billy bad ass
I'm selling coke whats the quote, I match that
Matter fact, I got them for half that
How many mug shots they gonna taking me
Before they understand they ain't gonna pin a case on me
Kush stay rolled up, pocket full of fast money shirt say slowbucks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
I pulled up, hopped out, through the deuces
Love that smell and that these haters blowing kush
I got muscle with my hood call me flocka bush
Get your head knocked off for a couple bands
And hear the ... my youngest, let them ... around
Told them keep shooting no stopping unless you're gun jam
We got automatic big guns like call of duty
Keep it ... that's my call of duty
Fly young niggas rob you in some louie
When upon my bus got burned now he trying to sue me
Free my brother gucci, and my nigga boosie
I swear to god my life is like a fucking movie

[Hook]
