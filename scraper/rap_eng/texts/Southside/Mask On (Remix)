[Intro]
Uh
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Sober minds
Dead silence
Yuh, listen, look

[Chorus]
I don't take no fucking percocets
Molly, Percocets
No ecstasy, promethazine
No lean, no purple mess
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step
If you don't think that I'm the shit, it's just cause you ain't heard me yet
I'm 'bout to put my mask on, my mask on
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it

[Verse 1]
I'm about to grab niggas by the throat
I'm about to crash Lil Yachty boat
I'm about to drag niggas by the coat
Take out your trash, sit it by the door
Shit, I got the mask on me, I'm 'bout to go
I hate when niggas act funny when I'm alone
And try to give daps to me and tip their hats to me
And they act gully when they at home
Yeah, I don't do Xannies or Mollys
Don't come near me with problems
And don't you compare me to Logic (never)
Go listen to Sriracha
Yeah, that's Amanda to Ronda
And that's a Benz to a Honda
Yeah, that's a dance with the devil
And I ain't dancing behind ya
My nigga, I'm a muthafucking entity
You don't get it, even landlords gotta pay rent to me
Gingerbread man fuckers ain't catchin' me
Sick and tired of niggas sickening, depressing me
Go to church, I testify
Pray to God I bless the beat
Kanye said "Touch the Sky"
Future might come for me
But I'm a fucking beast and if I die, that sucks for me
But where the crown I'ma kill the king
I bet a lot of haters won't feel the same
I dug the ground, I built the ring
I cut the cow I milked the game, nigga
I should cut a hole in the sky
Make you feel the rain, nigga feel the pain, nigga
A lot of rap niggas get nervous when they hear my name, nigga
I'm insane, nigga
Back when you was watching Leave It To Beaver
I was crushing on Tila Tequila
I was swagging in Adidas and Filas
Fuckin' divas call 'em Venus, Serena
Signed my deal and told em Cesar's a beater
Hope you didn't think I needed you neither
Take it back and told 'em I didn't mean it
'Cause my uncle said it's cheaper to keep it

[Post-Chorus]
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard
But are you funny to me
None of you niggas half hard
You think you comin' for but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me
And I come up some shit that I {Imitates mumble rap flow}
Ain't that mumble rap shit? (laugh)
Whoo, whoo!
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard
But are you funny to me
None of you nigga half hard
You runnin comin' for me but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me
And I come with some shit
That'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons
And be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean
What's up with you mumble niggas that never say nothin'?
I'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven
I go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother
And you ain't telling me nothing
I mean I'm very disgustin'
I mean I'm ready to bust and
Put an end to you fucker, now what's what?
How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?
Huh?

[Bridge]
Look, all you a lie
I don't cuff no hoes, you can have my bitch
I don't even mind
It seems like all these hoes wanna do is switch up
They rather be a guy
If she could suck my dick everyday for a living
Then that'd be her job, yuh
I said candy paint in yo fuckin' rims
.38 in yo fuckin' Benz
I was broke as fuck had a couple friends
A refrigerator and a cup of gin
Let's drink it up, me and you
'Cause these niggas fake, and I see it too
And they try to get me to pop Percocets and Molly
And I said

[Chorus]
I don't take no fucking percocets
Molly, Percocets
No ecstasy, promethazine
No lean, no purple mess
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step
If you don't think that I'm the shit its just cause you ain't heard me yet
I'm about to put my mask on, my mask on
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it

[Post-Chorus]
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard
But are you funny to me
None of you niggas half hard
You think you comin' for but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me
And I come up some shit I (inaudible)
Whoo, whoo!
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard
But are you funny to me
None of you niggas half hard
You think you comin' for but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me
And I come with some shit
That'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons
And be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean
What's up with you mumble niggas that never say nothin'?
I'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven
I go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother
And you ain't telling me nothing
I mean I'm very disgustin'
I mean I'm ready to bust and
Put an end to you fucker, now what's what?
How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?
What the fuck? Fuck!
