[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
I keep chrome on that motherfucking Yamaha
Big booty stripper had take that ass to comic con
Whoop I'm the brand new phenomenon
Reppin' for the nerds, we the wave no Kameha
They say I should shut my music down
I said that's cool, but put my dick inside your mouth
And really I don't do good at crowds
And I don't go to games cause I can't spark the loud bitch
Azizi fucking Gibson's what they call me
Don't you shoot the rock, oh we gon take that as you ballin'
Chicken Little said the sky was falling
But don't you get confused boy, that's just money talking
If I said it then I motherfucking meant it
If your boy can't ball make the call nigga bench him
Kick back and let's talk about these chickens
And everything is everything, especially when you winnin' nigga
And we ain't tryna trump on you niggas
We just want a nice little cheap with our bitches (Whatever that is)
Mobsters and creatures for dinner
In the beginning we were sinnin' but shit now we winnin'

[Hook] 2x
Fuck that, bitch
We so fuckin' rich, you should learn from this
Ain't no diss, it's just niggas juggin' 'til they don't exist
Cus I just wanna roll with my niggas
I just wanna crack a few hoes with my niggas

[Verse 2: Azizi Gibson]
Someone call the ambulance, I need help
Doc I think I got a problem, I keep worryin' bout myself
And I can't blame this shit on mama belt
But it taught me ups and downs, so I can't afford to melt
Think about them days I used to be in Thailand
Sticky rice, sauteed boy we out here
Pad Thai 'fore I shut my eyelids
Sorry lil' bitch I was thinkin' bout my childhood
Get no love 'less your blood
I've had too many friends fuck me over for some dumb stuff
Why you think we all the way up?
It's because my niggas never gave a fuck

[Hook] 2x
