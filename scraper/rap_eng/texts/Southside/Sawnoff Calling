[Verse 1]
Me and Corey go back from like Year 1
And Joseph too he always was the clear one
[?] is my big sister but she younger tho'
Me and Mikayla haven't spoken but I love her tho'
Courtney used to fall asleep by like lunch time
Charlie Archer had my back when it's crunch time, huh
Who'd have thought I would've been king of the hood now
I push three 'cause I hear Sawnoff calling
Kayne and that's too they all was calling
I reminisce but I don't do this often
I reminisce but I don't do this often
Kylie loves the fact I blew without him
Used to look after Ky I don't know what I'd do without him
And Pablo knows I wouldn't go out on a move without him
They're like "fuck Cadell he keeps too many yutes around him"

[Verse 2]
Year 9 was me, Deonte and Wayland
Whole time I hear the roller came for pagans
Looking back I wish I never did none
Cousin's looking at a bird and he just rid one
Name me a nigga that I'm prang off
Lansbury in this bitch won't hesitate to bang off
Think you're the man 'cause you know the man (man, man)
But I'm the man you got the link for the man off (for the man off)
I'm out here and Tanch is fucking the can up
I need a reload he needs a Rihanna
I could have ten of her, she rings me and I hang up
This life I live is too explicit for the camera
Everybody shots or they do construction
I did the road on bigger scales how can I trust 'em
These my niggas tho' and I ain't tryna cuss them
I just wanna change the ways that we're accustomed to

Smoking a lot right now
High 'til I'm going for my re-up
Smoking a lot right
Lemme tell the truth, aight cool

[Verse 3]
My niggas criminal's that's their story
First time I used my ting was very gory
I'm lucky that that nigga ain't report me
I was a terror when I was a shorty
If you can't love me for who I am then don't try
Where was you when I staring death with both eyes
Crying to my mother she knows that I don't cry
You only touch the road when souls are made I don't like
Don't lie
I remember having Feltham calling
And now I got Thameside calling
On prison phones I don't like talking
They should do music if they like recording
Now all these girls are out here balling
I changed the game in one day I guess that it's my calling
It's either I'm getting taller, or the sky is falling
And if the money crossed the world then see how I afford it
See me in Roman or in Poplar or the island border
She might be priceless to you, but I just bought her
I did some nights in the zoo so I'm writing movies
Already networking, no need to find a scorer
Still the one your favourite MC looks up to
But if they can't control you how can they love you
Videos in police cars that's a fuck move
Lying in all of your lyrics that's a fuck move too
