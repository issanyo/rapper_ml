[Hook: Gucci Mane - Trap Back]
I don't wanna have to push your cap back
Homie, he just say he want his girl back
In a drop top, I'mma push the top back
I was gone for a second, but the kid back
If you ever cross me I'mma get some payback
Close the curtain on them haters in my Maybach
Put a hole in your motherfuckin' snapback
It's Gucci Mane bitch, so you can say the trap back

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm back at it, nah I just started
Rappers can act however they want because I love drama (get it)
I've kept it real and never sold my soul
The kids playing in the A League goal for goal
Fuck the fame, I'm a team player
I'm the one who passes off the ball, the striker lands into the net
Me I go down with the ship while you abandon what you wrecked
Yous are dogs and I'm a man until my death
I ain't goin anywhere like terminal illness
I'm gettin paid I bet my ex regrets burning my pictures
I let em hate, jealousy makes men turn into bitches
So get it straight, I don't give a fuck I'm hurtin their feelings (yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I was born to lose but I ain't built to break
So I won't stop until I've bought my mum a bigger place
My fam is so big we don't fit in a picture frame
Strong and Loyal all across the country, we're interstate
This is real life, I ain't playin games
All you actors try to play the part while I stay the same
My loyalty is something you can't take away
It's laughable when all these rappers tell me I should change my name
Flowz One, I'm in a league of my own, MVP these scouts won't leave my alone
Even when I'm on the bench, your whole team is a joke
Times up ya striked out that's three in a row (yeah)

[Hook]
