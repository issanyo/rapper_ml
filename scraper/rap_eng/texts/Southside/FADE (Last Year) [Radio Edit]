Yo shout out to Roe, man

What you thinking 'bout?

I was thinking about the cash I made LAST YEAR
I was thinking about this girl I met LAST YEAR
I'm going hard I'm in the FAST GEAR
And I'm going hard like it's my LAST YEAR

What's the move?
My people, we looking rude
Friday night, what to do?
And we tryna get into something
Riding in all night I ain't ever bluffin'
That's word to my brother, and my other cousin

Ayy, Yep, Yep
Vibing on the beat
Riding on the beat
Like a trolley on the street
Yeah, I'm grinding every week
Just, tryna get paid
If, he don't got that money, then
He gon' catch a FADE (Woah)

Ayyyy
Yeah, you could catch a FADE
You could catch a FADE

Yeah, you could make my day
You could catch a FADE

On the block all day
People out there selling rocks all day
Gotta watch both ways
Gotta watch out for the cops all day

Smash that safe
Run before you catch a case
If I don't get paid
He might catch another FADE (Woah!)

And I'm busy man
Know the kid stay busy man
S.L.I.M.E Season man
I'm S.L.I.M.E like the deacon man

If I catch that case
Then I might just go upstate!
Kick him like Johnny Cage
FADE him like a razor blade!

Hello? Woah, can I call you back?

My girlfriend
Said I won't be famous
Going nowhere aimless
I should've known that little girl
Was brainless

She's looking at the picture
Who is that there?
I look up in her eyes with a deep stare
Don't worry that's the girl I met LAST YEAR

(Shawty drinking mad beer)

Yeah, you could catch a FADE!
