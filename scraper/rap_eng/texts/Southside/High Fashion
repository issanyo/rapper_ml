[Intro: Future]
We, we, we predicted this, you hear me?
We predicted this

[Hook: Future]
See how y'all at me? You see how they at me?
They tryna catch me, tryna snatch shit
Fly and flashy, say I'm fashion
I'm high fashion, I'm on acid
I move like I'm on acid, and I'm high fashion
I do it real drastic, I do it real drastic
Everything everlasting, money stretch like elastic
Oh, oh, oh, and I'm strapped with that plastic
And I'm strapped with that plastic
I love this music with a passion

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Maison Margiela blunts, Louis Vuitton double cups
Designer drugs, you get seamed up if it tastes cut
Niggas rollin' like rollers, might roll up in dun-ta-duns (straight up)
Don't think that I've had enough (La Flame!)
Cause I been on the binge
Scored a coke model, that's a high fashion win
Splurgin' in the mall got me spendin' all my ends
Yeah, we made it to the hills now (straight up)
Coke costs a couple bills now
Yeah, tell me how it feels now
Tired of motherfuckers who wanna be trill
Yeah, down south, it get real
Diamonds two steppin' every time I crack the grill
Niggas still hate hatin' niggas how I live

[Hook: Future]
See how y'all at me? You see how they at me?
They tryna catch me, tryna snatch shit
Fly and flashy, say I'm fashion
I'm high fashion, I'm on acid
I move like I'm on acid, and I'm high fashion
I do it real drastic, I do it real drastic
Everything everlasting, money stretch like elastic
Oh, oh, oh, and I'm strapped with that plastic
And I'm strapped with that plastic
Fly and flashy, fly and flashy
Fly and flashy, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Future]
Ain't no recession bitch, I got collections bitch
I don't respect the bitch, I might say fuck the bitch
And then go and fuck the bitch, I seen a psychiatrist
The devil inside me and I'm tryin' to hide it
This lean got me nauseous, but I keep on usin' it
I wear so much Givenchy, that they say I'm abusin' it
I went and tried to sit down with the Pope
And tell him I was usin' too much dope
The only way I tell him anything, he gotta plug me in with the coke

[Hook: Future]
See how y'all at me? You see how they at me?
They tryna catch me, tryna snatch shit
Fly and flashy, say I'm fashion
I'm high fashion, I'm on acid
I move like I'm on acid, and I'm high fashion
I do it real drastic, I do it real drastic
Everything everlasting, money stretch like elastic
Oh, oh, oh, and I'm strapped with that plastic
And I'm strapped with that plastic
I love this music with a passion
