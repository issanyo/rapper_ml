[Intro]
Aye man
You know I'm a fiend for them bricks man
Chop and screw me till I'm in pieces
I don't even know who I am anymore

[Hook x4]
I can hear them Xannies callin
I can hear them Xannies callin all night

[Verse]
I can hear them Xannies callin
I need them Xannies every mornin
I be goin up and down I'm so
So up and down that I don't even know
I can't feel my feet I'm fallin
I wonder why my phone keep callin?
I need a Xan, I need a up the dose man
Ten bricks a day now I don't even know man
I can hear them Xannies callin
Pop a couple then I'm talkin slow
Drop a couple bricks until I slow down
Face white man I'm lookin like a ghost now
I can hear them Xannies callin
I can hear them Xannies talkin
I need them Xannies every mornin ohh
Cause you don't wanna see me if I don't
I can hear the devil callin
Or is it just them Xannies talkin?
I just called my brother but he's sold out
Just to get them Xans I went and sold my soul now
I can hear them Xannies callin
I can hear them Xannies talkin
I need a Xan, I need a up the dose man
Ten bricks a day now I don't even know man

[Hook x4]
I can hear them Xannies callin
I can hear them Xannies callin all night
