[Intro: Juicy J]
Mafia
Trippy vibes nigga
Shut the fuck up

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I'm in the club throwin' bread with my savages
Got this lil' bitch on some ratchet shit
This ain't no accident, bitch you been havin' that
I keep that thing on the passenger
I'm in the club throwin' bread with my savages
Got this lil' bitch on some ratchet shit
This ain't no accident, she know I'm havin' it
Now this lil' bitch in my passenger
I'm in the trap blowin' dope with the savages
You need a pound if you matchin' it
That's how you smoke when you havin' it
3.5 in every joint that I be passin'
I'm in the trap pourin' drink with the savages
2 pints or better imagine it
That ain't no drink, you ain't havin' it
Can't finesse me nigga, I ain't havin' it

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
What it is? What it do?
She gotta fuck the whole crew
My bitch ain't a Christian
But I keep her in the Loub's
Don't try to walk in my shoes
Like the rest of these fools
You can't do what I do
You might end up on the news
In the club with them savages
We come from movin' them packages
In the hood they be clappin' shit
Bitch I invented the ratchet shit
We on that trappin' shit
We on that rappin' shit, niggas be mad 'cause we havin' it
Could find me posted with the baddest bitch
She gon' go and get her badder bitch
Pass it to my youngin', look at that assist
Smokin' that gas I ain't passin' it
Keep one on me, I ain't with the lackin' shit
How you trappin', you ain't even packin' shit
This chopper won't but the MAC'll fit
You ain't killin' shit, you ain't whackin' shit
Get the fuck on with that actin' shit
Get my pimpin' on, I'll smack a bitch

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I'm in the club throwin' bread with my savages
Got this lil' bitch on some ratchet shit
This ain't no accident, bitch you been havin' that
I keep that thing on the passenger
I'm in the club throwin' bread with my savages
Got this lil' bitch on some ratchet shit
This ain't no accident, she know I'm havin' it
Now this lil' bitch in my passenger
I'm in the trap blowin' dope with the savages
You need a pound if you matchin' it
That's how you smoke when you havin' it
3.5 in every joint that I be passin'
I'm in the trap pourin' drink with the savages
2 pints or better imagine it
That ain't no drink, you ain't havin' it
Can't finesse me nigga, I ain't havin' it

[Verse 2: Young Nudy]
Double cup drippin' and slippin'
And everybody know they fuck with slums
Anybody try to try the slums
Slums gon' let a fuckin' bullet fly
[?] before this here, when I made it right
Dollar bet with the ave
[?]
Middle finger with the fire
Bitch I come from the 6
East Atlanta nigga, North of the bricks
You movin' the shit, then you sellin' the shit
You tell my body then you [?] the shit
After be livin' in life, a young nigga from the dirt life
Son Nudy live a rough life, stick got a nigga upright
If you don't look like the [?]
Ask around nigga, I run the five
I'll have alot of niggas pull up with fire
You talkin' that shit somebody gonna die
I am the nigga in the screet
[?] me with the 30 hangin' on
And I keep a bitch with me
Know she bad with a double cup filled with me

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I'm in the club throwin' bread with my savages
Got this lil' bitch on some ratchet shit
This ain't no accident, bitch you been havin' that
I keep that thing on the passenger
I'm in the club throwin' bread with my savages
Got this lil' bitch on some ratchet shit
This ain't no accident, she know I'm havin' it
Now this lil' bitch in my passenger
I'm in the trap blowin' dope with the savages
You need a pound if you matchin' it
That's how you smoke when you havin' it
3.5 in every joint that I be passin'
I'm in the trap pourin' drink with the savages
2 pints or better imagine it
That ain't no drink, you ain't havin' it
Can't finesse me nigga, I ain't havin' it
