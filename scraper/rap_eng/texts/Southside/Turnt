[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
You talking money, I got that, his new bitch my old ho
They sending boxes, don’t buy clothes, got a diamond grill, can't do gold
When I pop shit, it’s a drumroll, extendos, nigga case closed
Assist the bully like rondo, sixty four thousand for the rollie, hello
Got a bad bitch with me every state I go
Million dollar nigga at the corner store
That cold cut, I need one of those
Everywhere I go, crowd follow me
Turnt up, young black nigga
Flexed up with a stack, nigga
Ghost up got a Bentley, and my chain cost 'bout 40
Them bad bitches, can't do one, I need eight of those
Rolls gold
My rollie, smoking Bob Marley
Bad bitches, they notice me
Front row, no nosebleed
Paparazzi been following me
Everywhere I go, it’s a party

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

Throwing racks, clap that ass
Throwing racks, clap that ass
Throwing racks, clap that ass

[Verse 2: Wale]
D.O.A., with B.O.A., B.S.M. here, so we ok
Don’t be on B.S., might beat off brake
Then I D.I.P., like I be on skates
Just be on G shit, don’t be on dates
Throw out racks, you might throw out change
Blow our backs, you might know my dames
They don’t know y’all tracks, they just know y’all lame
Work. Let me do my thing
Couldn’t tie my shoes, couldn’t do my strings
Nigga, please, you cold, blew out flame
Ain't cool, they bull, Luol Deng
Dreads out, fuck it, though
Longer the badge's on comfortable
Blowing so much my lungs are through
I’m the one for they rap like the number two
Ooh
What up, Brick Squad? Never sold work, but I gets off
Sick boss, 'bout big cars, puff a whole blunt, nigga pimp hard
Little pimp stroke, it’s like limp doe
Tight wrist glow, when it get dark
Got your lady hot, Wale and Flock
And I cut hoes like a tit job, whoa

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
This mafucka turnt, this mafucka turnt

This mafucka turnt, this mafucka turnt

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Okay, done went and I got me a new car to go along with my new house
To go along with my new chick that I just hit on my new couch
Then Flock calls like "Yo, dog," said it’s bout time we put the part 2 out
I ain’t even spend that old money, I was actually thinking about cooling out
I got strange clouds in my section, you would think I’m B.o.B
I got Bombay and lemonade, in my V.I.P. like I’ m Chiali
Bad hoes all pass go, but it’s cash flow, can I see I.D.?
She showed me her navel tats and the piercings on her T.I.T
That work for me? Well, certainly
I make it rain, she works for me
I’m Major Payne, she worships me
She say my name like she cursing me
I get no hands to a slow jam
It’s like 4 bands in that [?]
She down to be fucking with a real nigga
She know every time I come around and she with me
