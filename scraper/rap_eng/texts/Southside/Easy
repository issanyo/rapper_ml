[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Never said it's easy, was never easy (yahh)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (yahh)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (yahh)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (yeah, yeah)
I been on the lean, man, I been up dreamin' (straight up)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (straight up)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (yeah, yeah)
Never said it's easy, was never ea-

[Verse 1: Rook Monroe]
Fornicate inside the bus, to a life's the life we love
All my life's the life they want, all my life I'd knew it come
Products that I oversee, I don't have to oversell
Private jet to cut the coast, we don't have to cut the cost
Bounce it, bounce it for the realest, you just wanna know the feelin'
Take your bets and make suggestions, bet your ass I make a killing top?
Booty how I'm droppin' singles, all my money so bilingual
All my hoes, they do me nice, little do they know they ain't no [?]
Poppin', my shooter's poppin', I get it [?]
Talkin', do too much talkin', I get a hundred
Notes, I gotta know, raising an octave
Bodies, I'm droppin' bodies, you better chug it
Shh, chh, lose it

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Never said it's easy, was never easy (yahh)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (yahh)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (yahh)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (yeah, yeah)
I been on the lean, man, I been up dreamin' (straight up)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (straight up)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (yeah, yeah)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (yahh)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Gotta watch these hoes, yeah, these hoes be sleazy (oh, yeah)
Had to drop my old bitch, that ho was sneaky
Put that on my tongue, that shit got me tweakin'
Let's just have some-
Thaw that bih, thaw that bih, thaw that bih
Raw that bih, raw that bih, raw that bih
Stroke that ho, stroke that ho a lil' bit, yeah, on a pole
Work that ass a lil' bit, yah, yah, yah
I been on the road, I been in the TV
I just need some head, got some head, no reason
We been on a roll, counting money, geekin'
She-she-she-she-she, she molly geekin'
She think she peaked, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Travis Scott]
I wish you-
