[Intro: Enhomnom]
S/O to Enayett my older brother
S/O to Mrs. Wadley
Hashtag I am Enhom

[Hook: Enhomnom]
Really I'm Enhom, really I'm Enhom
I can be annoying, I can be the bomb
Really I'm Enhom, really I'm Enhom
I like to make jokes yeah I like puns

[Verse 1: Enhomnom]
I play rugby so I'm a rugger
I got three siblings I'm a brother
Live with my father and my mother
At 5:30 we eating supper

I'm a deep sleeper but I don't drool
I wake up at 8 and go to school
Hands on learner, yeah I'm good with tools
And I'm not a bully, I don't ridicule

I play with basketballs, I don't like bats
Rather talk in person I don't like chats
I'm a dog person I don't like cats
But I've still got my pride I'm a Wildcat

[Pre-Hook: Enhomnom]
You can find me wearing Ferragamo flip flops
If you see me on the court I go criss-cross
I'm insecure, I don't take my shirt off
This ain't ?????, this ain't a rip-off

[Hook: Enhomnom]
Really Fareghi, really Fareghi
Coming through the streets with the freaking heat
Really Fareghi, really Fareghi
I'm spazzing on this freaking beat

[Verse 2: Enhomnom]
Always rocking name brand
Brown skin no spray tan
Momma whippin' that caravan
Got brown rice I'm an Afghan
I'm cool as hell like Batman
Not a litter-bug I use trash cans
Twice a year I do Ramadhan

My momma says she loves me
She always comes hugs me
She says you're so lucky
'Cause your face so lovely
These girls do not love me
They just want to touch me
My standards are too high
So I don't let it bug me

[Outro: Enayett]
