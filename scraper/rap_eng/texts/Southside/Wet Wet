[Waka Flocka Flame]
*intro*
Like my life got hard wood floors on it
I don't walk on concrete man
I walk on hard wood floors and ballin'
Like a person with no watch I ain't go no time for the bullsh*t
FLOCKA

[Waka Flocka Flame Verse 1]
20/20 vision
Shoot with good precision
Make the wrong decision
Flat line you missin'
Time is money so you only got 5 minutes
New drop top, that sh*t look like Carly
It's so f*ckin' sexy, smokin' weed just like I'm Marley
Dread Head slangin', so them hoes dig it
If my spike look like my charm you no know imma' sip it
They call me doctor feel good
Beat that p*ssy up make em' feel good
She screamin' pull my hair
Flocka slap my ass
P*ssy so wet it feel like I'm takin' a bath
Slip and slide p*ssy, you would think she know trick daddy
FLOCKA

[Waka Flocka Verse 2]
Now I'm in the club [FLOCKA]
Rollin' on them beanz [ROLLIN']
Remy Martin got me walkin' with a gangsta lean [GANGSTA]
You know my team [GANGSTA]
I ain't gotta say the name
They throwin' money make it rain
My boys make it hurricane

[Blair Maxberry]
She wet nigga
Just like my car paint
I got my moby dick all in her shark tank
She tryin' to eat me up
She's a man eater
I got more wood to swing than A-Rod and Jeter [Homerun]
You're on the charts
But I'm off the meter
Where your girl at?
Cause I'm off to meet her
You often eat her
I often beat her
You so cousin Skeeter
Boy I'm off to lead her
Got your girl sippin'
Yeah, she leanin' low
Got your girl strippin'
Jean jeans on the flow
She got that wet wet
She got that super soak
Fuck a supa head
I call this girl super throat

[Cartier Kitten]
I got that mmm mmm
That comeback
That make a n*gga want what he just had
Catier keep a c*nt on his mustache
Make him smoke a blunt when he done ask
That come fast
Dive so deep no lifeguard
All white two seats
That's my car [x2]
Don't touch shit that's my car
And since he a freak let the top down
While he top me down
And it taste so good he wanna lock me down
If he got hard wood I'll mop it down
Scratch my meow every time he goes down
Hello kitty come hurr
And he makes it go purr
Scratch scratch
Better watch my claws imma' cat cat
But I like them dogs
Imma' Pisces
But no fishy fishy
Just wet wet
That squishy squishy

That wet wet
See that that squishy squishy
That wet wet
See that squishy squishy
That squishy squishy
