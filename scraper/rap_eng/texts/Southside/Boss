[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
This morning I woke up on some boss shit
Roll a blunt and have my balls licked
Counting money on the toilet (Woo)
Don't you pull up to my doorstep
Fuck around and get your head split
We'll just take that as a deathwish (Woo)
This shit could turn you into a ghost
So you need to chill out with the bullshit
Had to pull up on my bros (Skrrt)
Had to pull up on my woes
Hit the streets, get some hoes
On the way we get some clothes
New ring for my nose
I will, definitely get chose
Now your girl is lookin' Farsi
Satisfied like Benassi
Don't be mad ya baby want me
Anime until the morning
Yellow women that's my potion
We don't even gotta know ya
We'll just fuck around and show ya
I am far from a poser
We don't do this shit for doja, getting rich for me is closure
Fuck with me and then it's over

[Bridge]
All my niggas on some boss shit
All my bitches on some boss shit
All my niggas on some
All my bitches on some
Pullin' up we on some
Ballin' on you till you
Want a boss, I'm a
All these commas

[Hook]
All my niggas on some boss shit
All my bitches on some boss shit
Pullin' up we on some boss shit
Ballin' on you till you nauseous
Want a boss, I'm a boss bitch
All these commas, bitch we boss rich
You just mad you not a boss bitch
Boss enough to get my balls licked
What the fuck you niggas know?
Whip this shit and shave and go
Thanks for turning off the stove
Might've died on the low
Dollar signs on my dome
Find my own way home
Give a fuck what it cost me
I'm just being real bossy
I'm just being real bossy

[Bridge] (x2)
Come through and fuck up your city
Spend me some fifty's
Get it and suck on some titties
Really we not used to winning
So all my niggas gon' come through and ? at some niggas

[Verse 2: Azizi Gibson]
Sometimes I think someone is watching me, oh
There's just some things I can't believe, no
We getting up outta this bitch, I think it's time for us to dip
Shawty you're free to get lit, but I don'tÂ  wanna do that shit here
Niggas is plotting in here, the jealousy's thick in the air
I am a level myself, there is no point in kickin' it here

[Hook]
All my niggas on some boss shit
All my bitches on some boss shit
Pullin' up we on some boss shit
Ballin' on you till you nauseous
Want a boss, I'm a boss bitch
All these commas, bitch we boss rich
You just mad you not a boss bitch
Boss enough to get my balls licked
What the fuck you niggas know?
Whip this shit and shave and go
Thanks for turning off the stove
Might've died on the low
Dollar signs on my dome
Find my own way home
Give a fuck what it cost me
I'm just being real bossy
I'm just being real bossy
