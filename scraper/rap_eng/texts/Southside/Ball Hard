[Intro: Waka Flocka]
SQUAD Rari's back to back, me & Sizzle
Throwing rack after rack, me & Sizzle
We fuck your bitch from the back, me & Sizzle
And if that nigga look again, up the pistol

[Interlude: Waka Flocka]
You thought we was done nigga? You thought this shit was gon' stop nigga? Fuck y'all thinkin' out here man. Big homie Flock man, aka Big dog pussy

[Verse 1: Sizzle]
Jolly Rancher Panamera
Bullets through your New Era
Bitch we’re running new era
Wishing you could do better
Thumbin thru that mozzarella
Bitch I got that extra cheddar
Sizzle such a Off setter
Sizzle such a boss nigga
Bottles poppin', bitches toppin'
Money stackin' molly poppin'
Molly woppin, fuck a wallet
Fuck a stylist, Sizzle wildin'
Sizzle geekin', bitch I’m peakin'
Bitch I’m eatin', fuck the defense
Off the deep end, never sleepin'
Niggas creepin', choppers sweepin'

[Hook: Sizzle & Waka Flocka]
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Gotta keep it one thou', bitch I'm all in
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
She say money make her cum, that's her best friend

[Post-Hook: Waka Flocka]
Rari's back to back, me & Sizzle
Throwing rack after rack, me & Sizzle
We fuck your bitch from the back, me & Sizzle
And if that nigga look again, up the pistol

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka]
And how a nigga get 'em racks is like a riddle
I remember way back poppin' Skittles
Early morning trapping got McGriddles
In the trap pray to god for a miracle
I was 14, shot my first pistol
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Shoot with the right whip with the left hand
Baby how you fit all that ass in them pants
I'ma throw a couple bands if you start to dance
We just fuckin' for the night, ain't no romance
And if you let my dog hit, that's some bromance
I got some white girl for sale, Lindsay Lohan
Flexin' hard on you niggas, Hulk Hogan
I heard Sizzle signing bonus was a million

[Hook: Sizzle & Waka Flocka]
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Gotta keep it one thou', bitch I'm all in
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
Ball hard nigga, ball hard then
She say money make her cum, that's her best friend
