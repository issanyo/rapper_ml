[Intro]
In the war zone with the hittas
Yeah, check gang though
I'ma pop up on you in the latest

[Chorus]
Count my racks up, take a little dope
Get my pistol, I don't trust these folk
I fuck with shawty 'cause she don't post (Post, post)
These niggas, yeah, yeah, know I'm the GOAT

[Verse]
St. Regis, 27th floor
I'm with some heathens, they doin' the most (Most, most)
Christian Louboutin, blood on the floor (Floor, floor)
I'm so militant, Valentino camo
Maserati (Woo), that's a body
I be fresh (Woo), Osh B'gosh
Poor or pimp, do or die
Buyin' presidential by the ten pack, ran an M up in the Cadillac
I was gettin' it on the air mattress, servin' rocks in some Air Maxes
Blendin' in with my habitat, hit it hard, then double back
Credit card, that was scammer time, undecided then I drove by it
Benz coupe with the white tires, was a prototype
In the 305, drivin' 105
On the 95, hammer on my side
I've been way too quiet, I get way too fly
I got water diamonds, throw 'em on a dyke
I got an orange light, I got some green kush
I got some clear ice, you need to stay put
I got on white socks, give me some white top
I got a white Richard Mille, cost a whole car
I came up from out the field, workin' that ol' boy
Servin' Killa Cam, bought a new toy
This that Juelz Santana, rockin' them Gucci bandanas
Bought a pink poodle for a stack, gave it to shawty for her birthday
Had her posted up on the runway, I'm gettin' like Floyd with the grand√©
Slangin' that raw on the runway, pourin' up drank on a Tuesday
I was on a yacht on a Tuesday, keep it on God, come Tuesday
Maserati truck on Tuesday, better keep up, don't lose me
Gettin' geeked up, I'm exclusive
Two cell phones, and I'm ruthless
Two cups on, and I'm vicious
In the war zone with the hittas
I was goin' in the house with the vision
I done came back out with a million
I was hypnotizin' yay', I was cookin' up powder yay'
I was makin' it shower yay', for 43 hours, yay
I'm proud to say I made it, got the whole damn world invaded
3K hit the phone, I ain't save it
I be sittin' in the 'yo when they hatin'
I'ma pop up on you in the latest
She was talkin' that shit and I paid it

[Chorus]
Count my racks up, take a little dope
Get my pistol, I don't trust these folk
I fuck with shawty 'cause she don't post (Post, post)
These niggas, yeah, yeah, know I'm the GOAT

[Outro]
In the 305, drivin' 105
On the 95, hammer on my side
This that Juelz Santana, rockin' them Gucci bandanas
Servin' Killa Cam, bought a new toy
Bought a new toy
Bought a new toy
Servin' Killa Cam
This that Juelz Santana, rockin' them Gucci bandanas
