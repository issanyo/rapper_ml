[intro: Young Money]
You niggas ain't spelling nothing fire
Fuck all you niggas
You niggas ain't shit
Kill yourself niggas


[verse: Young Money]
Nobody can be me I'm one of a kind
I can see you fuck niggas out here doin time
Spreading all the bullshit spreading all the lies
Taking cheap shots trying to have a good time
Fucking up your main bitch fucking up a line
Take it to a new level take it back to mine
Hit her doggy raw and she screaming man
She screaming man
Now I got my chainz and she bouncin up and down
She ain't got no shame she say she do it all the time
Why u act surprised man this the real her
She dippin front back man she fuckin front back she dippin for the team
Man she winning for the team
This ain't something new man I had to tell my self
Man I had to learn myself
Got the drugs in my hand
It ain't right but someone gotta do it
I don't need to speak man I already knew it

[hook: Young Money]
Tellin my self are thes hoes always down
Tellin my self are thes hoes always down
Tellin my self are thes hoes always down
Tellin my self are thes hoes always down
I don't need to speak man I already know

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Southside from the south side, Gucci from the E-A-G
East Atlanta Georgia, was raised up on the B-C-T
Bouldercrest Road, and you know I got them P-I-E’s
Know the streets like my ABC’s but I’ma keep the K with me
Grah, grah grah grah, wish a nigga play with me
RIP to Dunk, used to kick it every day with me
Please don’t check the trunk, police know I got AR’s on me
You niggas need to chill, you don’t want to go to war with me
Baow baow baow, G-L-O-C-K on me
Got a thirty round in it and a nigga that’ll spray for free
Baow baow baow, G-L-O-C-K on me
Got a thirty round in it and a nigga that’ll spray for free

[outro: Young Sizzle]
Niggas say they lookin’ for me, bitch I’m at the T-O-P
I just spent a nigga’s budget, that’s what they don’t G-E-T
Bitches know I’m gettin’ money, baby you my P-E-T
You just spell that nigga’s whole name like a spelling bee
Bitch I’m tryna run the whole game, what you sellin’ me?
Bitch I’m tryna run the whole game, what you sellin’ me?
Never do I know these ho’s names, such a D-O-G
Know a nigga want the whole thing, got to E-A-T
