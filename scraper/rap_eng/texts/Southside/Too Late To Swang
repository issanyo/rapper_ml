[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin & Derez De'Shon]
Ain't no tryna break it up, get your ass knocked the fuck out
A bunch of young niggas bring the ambulance truck out
These niggas better duck, I'm a fool with the 40
Them hands nice too, call me Sucka Punch Shawty
Oh shit, there goes security
Tell 'em they can get it too
Got some Grove Street patna's that'll get rid of you
Everybody know, nigga I don't give a fuck
Put your head on a swivel, tell a nigga better duck
One swang, all swang, nigga what's up
Go and act up, everybody strapped up
Man down, oh shit, heard some shots fired
Last nigga ran his mouth, left his jaw wired
I was the problem child, nigga never went to class
Keep my pants on the ground so y'all can kiss my ass

Pull up in that Range truck, bet ya'll can't tame us
100 in the whole crowd, ain't no witnesses came up
And that was just yesterday, dump on the whole crowd

[Verse 3: B. Ceezy]
Its too late to swang up, too bad your ass in the scope

Shake um get some [?] to me, my choppa got the best of me
Smash on these niggas who be thinking that they extra deep
What's all that talkin' loud 'fore, that Soufboi said the crowd so
Nigga I mean, I Bet I bust, like that T.I. flow
Concrete, flow hard

It ain't no running out, its a half a minute later
And I'm still dumping
