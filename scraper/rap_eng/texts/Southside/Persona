Real street nigga, ain't no flaw in my persona
Real street nigga, man they treat me like Obama
Real street nigga, got this 30 it ain't gon' rumble
Real street nigga, I'm good up in that jungle
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
Rob you with no mask just to show you that's it me nigga

[Verse 1]
First I find my target, then I get to shootin'
You could call me Fredo Curry when I got that Ruger
You only take pics with your strap, you ain't gon' use it
You only take pics with your strap, yous not a shooter
Flexin' hard, got your baby mama down with my movement
She suckin' dick with her bestfriend and they cool in my Jacuzzi
She say I'm a trap nigga, she say you a loser
Can't name one time I took a bitch to the movies
You the type of goofy that'll fall in love with a groupie
I'm a type of trap nigga, in the hallway with a uzi
Broad day shoot outs you would of thought it was a movie
Scarface paint the fool, I got the juice, I ain't gotta prove it

[Hook]
Real street nigga, ain't no flaw in my persona
Real street nigga, man they treat me like Obama
Real street nigga, got this 30 it ain't gon' rumble
Real street nigga, I'm good up in that jungle
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
Rob you with no mask just to show you that's it me nigga

[Verse 2]
I don't fuck with niggas, co defendants turn to witness
Real trap king nigga, this is not a gimmick
Pistol smack my plug til he show me where his shipments
Shoot him in the head, got his whole family attention
I'mma say this once, everybody pay attention
Nigga fuck with me, now his whole family missin'
Real trap nigga, real street nigga
Real fuckin' killa, real drug dealer
I was only 12 when I first start sellin' dope
You was on the porch with your mama jumpin' rope
Trap just did a triple double, weed, molly and coke
Police run up in my trap, I'm shootin' through the door

[Hook]
Real street nigga, ain't no flaw in my persona
Real street nigga, man they treat me like Obama
Real street nigga, got this 30 it ain't gon' rumble
Real street nigga, I'm good up in that jungle
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
I'm a real street nigga, real street nigga
Rob you with no mask just to show you that's it me nigga
