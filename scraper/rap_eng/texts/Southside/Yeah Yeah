All these hoes on my dick ‘cause I signed me a deal
Better sign to Big Wop if you want you a mil’
Bust down on my left wrist, I should’ve bought a crib (ice)
The pack just touched down, that’s a football field
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Pocket full of crip blue hundreds, need a wheelchair
We ain’t had shit, we were waitin’ on some welfare
Now we up, bitch, we got racks tucked everywhere
Wifey made it, diamonds crystal clear, yeah
Got so much cash, this shit not fair
I fucked the bitch once, but I ain’t bought no hair
We can take a trip, might fly on the Lear
Hop out the bitch and I’m fresh in Moncler
Yeah, ride with the stick on the front door
Yeah, 75 on my neck and I ain’t near done yet
Try to reach for my shit, boy I dare
Can’t show no love to no nigga, wouldn’t dare
All the bullshit goin’ in and out one ear
They broke, I don’t care
