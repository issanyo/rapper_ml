[Intro: Assorted People]
Southside on the track, yeah
Jersey rest stop turned into a crime scene tonight. One shot in the head... Moneybagg Yo in this camp... Man, fuck Moneybagg... Drugs, guns, and gangs... Moneybagg, yeah that's my baby daddy... He won't even come back in the club

[Verse]
They try the best to provoke me, the killer want to be relevant
Kevin Gates told me stay focused, Yo don't get out your element
Okay cool, ridin' with a chopper with a nose like an elephant
Only thing that keep me sane when I'm pourin' up medicine
Put an address on your words, pullin' up at your residence
Hundred thou' in presidents, and drugs on me, that's evident
Showed his hand through a text, switched up for a position
For you to let some shit like that go on, bitch you been the opposition (bitch)
Saw the flaw from the beginning, should've knew it existed (knew it)
Should've fell back when I heard that you be talkin' like snitches
Shout out my fans who didn't switch up, I was readin' them comments (what happened?)
When they took shots and didn't respond, some got on that dumb shit
I was gettin' my dick ate, countin' up new cake, I was on some more shit
How you gon' go off what you hear? man you don't know shit (nothin')
Bitches hold on to pride, niggas sayin' they gon' ride
Niggas tellin' lies
Say you lookin' for me here and there (where?)
How nigga, when I don't hide
I can start the car without the key (skrrt)
I want the Chanel on the seat (seat)
All this money turned me to a beast (urr)
Now I'm out of reach, they want to reach (huh?)
Niggas turned hippie, they want peace
Hit 'em with the urn, get 'em creased (urr)
Hottest nigga movin' through these streets
All at my shows with the heat
Dealt with more crosses than a priest
I ain't let it break me like the least
Drippin' Louis V underneath
Told 'em eat it up, it's a feast (2 Heartless)
