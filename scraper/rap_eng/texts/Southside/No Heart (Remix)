[Hook: Ace Century]
Young Ace why you rapping so hard?
Why these niggas claim they be trapping so hard?
They ain't got no choppas, why they lacking so hard?
How you getting to the top they said you wouldn't go far
They hating but I be laughing so hard
I be so high up just like a star
I'm a young king that's why they hating so hard
They looking for the album why they waiting so hard

[Verse: Ace Century]
Iron on me like I'm pressing clothes
Need some walls, got so many flows
People with me and they trained to go
Wearing all black like they a crow
I don't fuck with you nigga we ain't bros
Ain't prostitutes but these niggas hoes
It's that NPE if you didn't know
Remember me like John though
Give you wings ya ain't Paul McCartney
Uprising like Bob Marley
Can't see me, call me John Cena
I cause disasters call FEMA
Cats sleepwalking, Annasophia
Mean daydreaming, wouldn't wanna be ya
KHII, these niggas nobodies
Ride with a girl that's Brown like Bobby
But nigga we ain't using dope
Not mouthwash but choppa got a Scope
You should off yourself, I'll pass you the rope
I need that bread, ain't talking bout no loafs
I'll leave you missing and that's an oath
Niggas lying just like a hoax
Getting bread, no aunt Millie's though
Not Weezy, but need a milli though
No cheesesteaks, but they Phillie though
On that Cube shit, I'm like Really Doe
She wanna Smash, no Nintendo
3 players, smash her friend too though
Got them Big Macs if you hating though
Clown around but ain't playing though
Bring you hell, but ain't Satan though
God MC, they still waiting though
Been said I'm "Divine" what you waiting for
I'm the coolest, no Jaden though
No Paul McCrane, want Fame though
Like Google, these niggas play though
These niggas softer than Play-Doh
These niggas faker than asses though
I'm getting mine, no Cashis though
Burner turn your ass to ashes though
Albums 2, 3 and 4 is some classics though
Stay tripping like I took acid though
Kill every track is just a habit though
No Richard Reeds, Mr. Fantastic though
No Alex Summers, cause Havok though
Spit crack and y'all the addicts though
Y'all rappers is jokes, why I stay laughing for
