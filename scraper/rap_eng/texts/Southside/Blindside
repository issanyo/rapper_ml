[Verse 1]
Shut the fuck up, nobody make a sound
Keep talking, put his brains in the lost and found
Put that Glock down before I bring that chopper around
Hear that chopper sound and it'll chop you down
We the robbing crew, don't do the sale cases
Usual suspect when the shell cases
First name basis with all the bail places
I ain't picking faces, them my fucking Aces

[Chorus]
Tell them niggas get they mind right, know I got that iron tight
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside
Diamonds in the limelight, 50 make them shine bright
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside
Blind-blind-blindside
Blind-blind-blindside
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside

[Verse 2]
Dunk, bitch I run my city (shitting me?)
Nah, for real
Clayton County, I think I'm Victor Hill
Nigga, sit still, whole clique trill
Yeah, I got them dummies, but them bricks real
Man down, damn right
'Cause I got that chopper, don't mean I can't fight

[Chorus]
Tell them niggas get they mind right, know I got that iron tight
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside
Diamonds in the limelight, 50 make them shine bright
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside
Blind-blind-blindside
Blind-blind-blindside
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside

[Verse 3]
Thunderstorm storm ice, my chain looking tropical
Reach, that's your first class ticket to the hospital
Brand new .45, choppers is your obstacle
Tom Cruise with the Tommy, Mission Impossible
Bitch, I'm in the hood, these rap niggas never there
Mac catch him slipping, shoot his ass in the computer chair
Dirt Gang, bunch of wild niggas, love to buck
Keep the pump to blow your motherfucking stomach up
I ain't never fucked with y'all, we were never partners
You ain't ever pull no tool, never bought no chopper
All that acting front of these gangstas need a fucking Oscar
Nigga try to rob me, he gon' meet the Fockers
Leave you in Jurassic Park, nothing but your fossils
See that pussy nigga coming through my Gucci goggles

[Chorus]
Tell them niggas get they mind right, know I got that iron tight
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside
Diamonds in the limelight, 50 make them shine bright
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside
Blind-blind-blindside
Blind-blind-blindside
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside
Blind-blind-blindside
Blind-blind-blindside
Pussy nigga coming, I can see him from my blindside
