[Refrain]

Sak Pase, where ya been, whats happening (whats happening)
Told the feds, where ya been I need a challenge
Like a vulture, on these niggas i'ma scavenge
This for the culture, where ya at
I got the reds and the blues like a Chaffinch
I'm not average

[Verse 1]

I'ma run up on these niggas when I just got out
Free from court, led by Crackers where they badges give clout
On parole, don't give a fuck, nigga i'm high as a cloud
Don't give a fuck, tell me what is and what's not allowed
I was smart, pick me to read aloud
I'm about
To expose all the fakes who give me a thundercloud
Put on your raincoat, poncho and umbrella
Cause there's always a brainstorm when I think out loud
Where ya from, where ya at, tell me all your whereabouts
And I don't give a fuck if these niggas have a doubt
And just listen, to what I'm bout to say
Once a nigga talk 'bout me
He'll never see another day
Just vibe, just dance, just bob ya head and sway
Red dot on his nose like Rudolph, i'ma make him ride a sleigh
I'm a Haitian, I'm from Broward County where the thugs lay
Don't make it obvious, tell em to, meet me there halfway
And remember, the fakes and the snakes are gon' betray

[Refrain]

Sak Pase, where ya been, whats happening (whats happening)
Told the feds, where ya been I need a challenge
Like a vulture, on these niggas i'ma scavenge
This for the culture, where ya at
I got the reds and the blues like a Chaffinch
I'm not average
Sak Pase, where ya been, whats happening (whats happening)
Told the feds, where ya been I need a challenge
Like a vulture, on these niggas I'ma scavenge
This for the culture, where ya at
I got the reds and the blues like a Chaffinch
I'm not average

[Hook]

When I touched down in land like the Angels let me down
They was snapping all the pictures, yeah they got the angles down
I got the water on my neck, thought I was bout to drown
Told them folks leave me alone, cause I gotta rebound
Told them niggas leave me a loan, here's my bank account
Now where ya at
Now where ya at, yeah
Now where ya at, now
Where ya at, right now
Now where ya at
Now where ya at
Now where ya at, yeah
Now where ya at, now
Where ya at, right now
Now where ya at

[Verse 2]

Court hearings, driving German Engineering
Self-moving cars, fell asleep I wasn't steering
But a nigga feel like a Jedi, I could probably use the force
I ain't on no saddle but I'm whipping on a horse, yeah
And I knew there was some beef I just had to find the source
Till I found it homies came through, like the 7 Dwarves
And the drugs got me moody, all like the 7 Dwarves
And a rose ain't a rose unless it's got it's thorns
And when it's all over I gone win the awards
And when one of them closes, there gon' be an open door

[Hook]

When I touched down in land like the Angels let me down
They was snapping all the pictures, yeah they got the angles down
I got the water on my neck, thought I was bout to drown
Told them folks leave me alone, cause I gotta rebound
Told them niggas leave me a loan, here's my bank account
Now where ya at
Now where ya at, yeah
Now where ya at, now
Where ya at, right now
Now where ya at
Now where ya at
Now where ya at, yeah
Now where ya at, now
Where ya at, right now
Now where ya at
Now where ya at
Now where ya at, yeah
Now where ya at, now
Where ya at, right now
Now where ya at
