[Verse 1]
I mo' fuck 'em, and I don't even touch 'em
I pass 'em to my boys, and I don't even think about 'em
Real G's up in my squad, that's why I don't fuck with you
I beat that pussy up, like he's supposed to do
On my squad, wait you better get your check up
They say that KayO Redd, next up
No doubt ? look like my C.O. necklace
I met a ? now she say I'm flexing

[Hook x2]
I'm plowing, living life like Californication
I'm in the XBOX, next I'm in the Playstation
Waking up with a bad ass Blasian
Weed astrology all I need, my education

[Verse 2]
So many biddy's in my life, can't stick to one and I'mma slow 'em back
I just really wanna have some fun, I'mma live life to the fullest
A young rich dude but I'm looking for a hood bitch
I keep 'em hood like doe
On the magic stick, ? baby come work this dick
Excuse me, could you pardon my french
I'm so loud, could you smell my stench
I'm a starter, your boyfriend sitting on the bench
I mastered the game at nineteen, why you still sitting on him
I'm shitting on you everywhere I go
And I bet, you gon' smell my stench

[Hook]
