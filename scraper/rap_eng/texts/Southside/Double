[Chorus: Offset]
The styrofoam is double
These old ass niggas in trouble
Got racks in the Goyard duffle
Different bezel, a whole new level
Droppin' a check, spendin' a check
Cashin' a check on a bad bitch
The pussy get wet and the mouth is on deck
Meanwhile lil shawty a savage
Hop in the Ghost, a casket
The Lambo, the Rari the fastest
My bitches they made of plastic
They asses just be the fattest
Droppin' a check, spendin' a check
Cashin' a check on a bad bitch
The pussy get wet and the mouth is on deck
Meanwhile lil shawty a savage

[Verse 1: Offset]
Beat on my chest, a gorilla
The diamonds is different, on Phillipe (Patek)
I'm workin' on gettin' her richer (milly)
I'm Picasso, I'm paintin' a picture
I'm too official, I don't need a whistle
I been in a pickle then came out with wisdom
I stand on the stage and it's making me tickle
Showin' her nipples, as cold as a blizzard
I told y'all niggas that I am the wizard
I can put pulse on the pole when I feel it
It's a murder so tell me who did it
What you talkin' 'bout Willis?
No porta potty but I shitted
Patek a hundred, can you dig it?
Stuffin' that dick in your mouth
Spit on it, lick it and lick it
I know that your friends is with it
I fucked all her friends and didn't admit it
The molly santan done did it
Pass the bitch, let me hit it
That bitch ain't even bad, the makeup done did it
Hop in the lab and rap me a milly
Whole lot of cash when I'm in the mirror
I do not play with that cash, no period

[Chorus: Offset]
The styrofoam is double
These old ass niggas in trouble
Got racks in the Goyard duffle
Different bezel, a whole new level
Droppin' a check, spendin' a check
Cashin' a check on a bad bitch
The pussy get wet and the mouth is on deck
Meanwhile lil shawty a savage
Hop in the Ghost, a casket
The Lambo, the Rari the fastest
My bitches they made of plastic
They asses just be the fattest
Droppin' a check, spendin' a check
Cashin' a check on a bad bitch
The pussy get wet and the mouth is on deck
Meanwhile lil shawty a savage

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Fuck on these bitches and switch
I can't go out 'bout no bitch
Came out that jungle, my niggas hit licks
I want a milly, I'm straight out the trenches
I'm double cup, I didn't measure this shit
Can't mix the business with pleasure and shit
Had to stay down and get better this year
Big booty bitches, she fine and ain't shit
No liftin' weights but lil bitch on the muscle
And we just bust 'em we don't gotta tuss 'em
Fuck on these bitches but I cannot love 'em
I know that you dig this shit like a shovel
Don't fuck with police so I cannot cuff 'em
Just want to grind and we want us a duffle
Came a long way out that struggle
And we can't starve, we gon' eat you like suckers
Droppin' a check, run up a check
Fuck up a check on a bad bitch
Stunt on these bitches
Every time I get a chance 'cause I ain't never had shit
Throw hundreds on that bitch, I'm petty
I just want that mouth and I said it
I go the hardest, I go the hardest
Give me my credit or debit
Sippin' on Act got me activated
These rappers ain't shit and they animated
Hop on a private jet, ride out to Vegas
We toastin' it up 'cause we finally done made it
They chasing us after the show
I want the money, it's bros over hoes
Came a long way from that pot and that stove
White little thotties that play with they nose
I'ma keep kickin' this shit 'cross the coast
You want it cheaper, then harder to bowl
This one too much, put ten racks on a coat
You cuffin' that bitch, I came in her throat
From rags to them riches, they asking for pictures
Roll me a backwood, don't roll me no swishers
All out of town, on the road with them killers
Money over bitches, fuck all the feelings
Remember them days that I used to be dealing
Taking niggas' shit and robbing and killing
Came out the mud, that's a wonderful feeling
I'm sippin' on lean, 'bout to fuck up my kidney

[Chorus: Offset]
The styrofoam is double

Meanwhile lil shawty a savage
