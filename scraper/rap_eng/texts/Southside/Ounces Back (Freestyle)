[Verse- Cash Sinatra]

Yeah I'm the new bull
They callin' me D wade
This beat was just too good
I'm Finessin the remake
Now Bring me my weed plate
That sweet with that sour
They call it loud pack
I call it that LoudER
I see em in passin'
No praise but they jackin' the fashion (Mmm)
But me I'm relaxin'
Just get right back up in my bag then (Uhh)
There's more where that came from
Creators creating since day one
I see it all & I don't say nun
You cuttin' up & then the fade come
So don't play dumb
I be schemin'
& women just get in the way of the chicken don't  need it
Da white around yo lips I see ya, ya feenin'
The dough yeah I need it
The dough yeah I kneading
Lyrical genius
With spiritual meaning
The route lookin scenic
Women from Venus
The green is from Pluto
I'm Smokin that gas
Feel like a seamstress
They givin' me kudos
You know that's it's Cash
I need a bag with a fat amount
Bring it back to mom's havin her passin' out
Can't deny when the facts amount
