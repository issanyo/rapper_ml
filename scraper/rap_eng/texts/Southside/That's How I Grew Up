Money callin' me (whoa, whoa), trouble followin' me

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
On the Eastside of Chiraq, that's where I grew up
OG ain't let me on Essex until I grew up
When G Fazo died in 2010, I just ain't give a fuck
'Member me and Manski on the phone an hour T'ing up
Fourteen, we was young as fuck, all ready to fuck shit up
Comin' up, no fear in us, we ready to kill some
Lil Roc died, Rellski turned himself in for a year or some
Trappin' so hard, told 'em leave the line and watch us still run it
Back then I was sixteen, probably runnin' up a fifteen
Then I started spittin' 16s, rappin' 16s by my 16th
Nigga 16, yeah, them my blocks
Four blocks, can't switch, four blocks that way
Four blocks up, four blocks back
We run our shit and the opp's
