[Chorus: Tega & Smada]
Money turned me to a Savage (Ayy ayy)
Girlfriend be asking for a marriage
Made the money, made it plenty (Tada tada tada tada)
I be wearing Gucci wearing Fenty (Oh nana na)

[Verse 1: Smada]
Shout-out to bitches from Babcock
Shout-out to niggas in Unilag
Everybody wants the action
I make it turn back like a boomerang
Only T**** got my password
Because she my only Mutumina
I'm giving them all that they ask for
Because I'm the king of their universe
Money turned me to a Savage
Money gave me all the package
Money hid me from the garbage
Money showed me I'm an asset
Money told me I'm the baddest (yeah)
I ain't got time for the bullshit
All I just want is the pussy
Tight and sweet and also juicy
You should all know I'm from Mushin
So when I'm coming, You would excuse me!

[Chorus: Tega & Smada]
Money turned me to a Savage (Money fucking turned me to a Savage)
Girlfriend be asking for a marriage (Girls Girls Girls)
Made the money, made it plenty (Tada tada tada tada)
I be wearing Gucci wearing Fenty (Oh nana na)

[Verse 2: Tega]
I'ma pull up on your ass no doubt about it
I'ma stunt my new chain, I'm an Athlete
Cannot whip in my new ride, You got no balance
You ain't got no balance, You ain't got no talent
Bitch I am so Savage
Bank account so balance
I be eating Cornflakes
Niggas eating garbage
Please don't mind my manners, I'm a flirt no doubt about It
I'm not tryna change but Money got me change bruh
Fuck all these attitudes
I did the things that you wouldn't do
I got the money in a swimming pool
You done go write in your chronicles  (They be like)
Hey money change Nigga
Money fucking change Nigga
I'ma get my whip with the rains
It's my aim Nigga (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Smada]
I be making money everyday
I be making money every way
I be killing shows in every state
I be doing things you appreciate
I be making you hate me like an Alligator
Oh no I'm a boss (Boss)
Oh no you a wrecker (Wrecker)
All of my niggas are cold
Bibi, Sunkanmi and Tega (Scrr)

[Chorus: Tega]
Money turned me to a Savage (Money money money)
Girlfriend be asking for a marriage (Many girls Many girls)
Made the money, made it plenty (Made the money made it plenty)
I be wearing Gucci wearing Fenty (Oh nana na)

[Outro: Smada]
Homeboy, Tega ayy
