[Intro]
Fake nigga lie to a real nigga, that's just some shit that you don't do
Imma stay riding for my real niggas, that's just some shit that I'm gon' do
Fuck all the commas, let's fuck up some commas nigga
Let's fuck up some commas, let's do that shit random
Yeah, Future
Future Hendrix, it's some shit you don't do

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Have you ever felt like you've been here before
I just ain't for sale, they try and put my soul on clearance though
Momma told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't feel it, but they feelin' us I trust
Most of y'all done heard the news
Vic went rogue and signed to Hov
I ain't Tookie Williams though, I ain't come up out the blue
This for the folks in the morgue, niggas back home still hoping it close
Ugh 17 years old, I used to carry warm piss for my P.O
Now I'm savemoney and C-E-O, this beat so cold
I should do the show in a fucking mink with the tail so low my feet don't show
Snow, now clear the silence like the loud we blowing sirens
I've been killing with the truth, critics only hear the violence
I would say we out here wildin' but that be an understatement
I'm on vacation and it's in places I get paid in
That's a blessing and a curse
Real shit put family first
I made a plan I planned to ball so boss up nigga and it worked, now get that work

[Break]
Chitown in this bitch man
Shoutout to my nigga Justincredible
LA Leakers man, every time I come through the city you know who I gotta rock with
Savemoney we ain't never stop and we here day one to the last day
Turn up

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I told Justin warm the beat up
Shit is freezing, he ain't got no chill
I ain't got none either
Swear the flow straight off the heater
In my town I'm Derek Jeter, I got hits I'm in the field
With a halo on my deal I signed to Hov I'm lightskin jesus
Hallelujah hallelujah, you do you, more power to ya
I'mma fuck her in that x-drive, pussy wetter just got baptized
I'm a franchise, you a fraction
Niggas broke, can't pay attention
I got drive she tryna screwdrive, guess I gotta do it drill yeah
We've been up since Friday getting drunk and popping pills
Magic stick all on that ass, bitch I'm David Copperfield
You a fan, don't it blow you cause your boy just hot as hell
I'm with Leakers and we chilling, but I still ain't got no chill
That's forreal, way before I ever signed my fucking deal
I was in the city, I know niggas out here that got killed
I got Dare all on my wrist, that's to my homie lost his life
That's why I do this everyday, I swear I'm praying every night
Off the top it ain't light, but I'm sipping on some Sean Don
Shout my nigga Big Sean, these niggas wearing Sean john
You old school, I'm new school, we the leader of that shit
Shoutout to Future, man I'm next, I can't believe i'm this sick
