[Intro: Fabolous]
They ask why we move like that
I mean you know how it is
If you really been out here (that's how you really gotta move)
Shit wicked boy
Brooklyn forever

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Hold up, hold up
Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
These streets wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
(I be telling 'em)
You hoes wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
I won't show no mercy niggas ask for it
I can't show no mercy niggas ask for it (for real)
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
(Let's get to it though)
These streets wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked (yeah)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Swear if I ain't hit it then my dog kilt her
Bitches think they slick using that dog filter
Shorty know no matter what my piece is hitting
She pillow talking telling me your pieces didn't
Fuck that friendly nonsense keep it monetary
Rocking Fendi monster, I'm so fly it's scary
Twin cannons with him, that Mariah Carey
My nigga make a movie, that's that Tyler Perry
That's that Spike Lee, F. Gary Gray
Chopper beat your face, call it Mary Kay
Two birds of white girl, Ashley, Mary-Kate
Drop them chickens in the flour, let them birds marinate
All my day ones rocking Day-Dates
My son wear a Rollie to his play dates
Say they out the picture shorty photo cropping
I be more concerned bout' when that photo dropping
Cool on all these mixy niggas photo hopping
They post it but don't buy niggas photoshopping
Everything you niggas wanna get I done had that
Know I'm sonning niggas so I started wearing dad hats

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
These streets wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
You hoes wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
I won't show no mercy niggas asked for it
I can't show no mercy niggas asked for it (show no mercy)
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
These streets wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
HA-HAAAEEH! Uhh, yeah
I just went to get it they said I was selfish
Your best songs are somebody else's
Stay away from 'em, allergic to shellfish
It's all good long as you know where the wealth is
Used to play the lobby with the best raw
Then leave the after party with the best whore
Now I'm getting ready for my next tour
Kyrie party right next door
Go on let the pump do that
Art of War you just gotta Sun Tzu that
Got the Cuban sitting on the fuck Trump crewneck
I was in the hood you ain't never come through that
There's a reward if they find where we dumped you at
And let a clip off wherever your punk crew at
Far as that work go, yeah you know son move that
The whole Tri-state is my state, yeah true that
Okay see I'm just reminding y'all
These streets'll throw your timing off
Feels like a needle in your spinal cord
And the stamp on the diesel say Final Four
Wicked
