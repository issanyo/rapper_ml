...check
I'm whippin' in the mirror, check
I'm whippin' in the mirror, check
I'm bangin' that [?], check
I'm bangin' that [?], check

[Future]
Young nigga gangbangin', manslaughter
Yeah, serve the trap in front of my grandmother
Yeah, she affiliated with drug smugglers
Yeah, I'm a menace to society
Bury shit, Kylie Jenner, that's a side piece
Yeah, I got 20 mothafuckin' Kylies
Nigga, I got 20 damn Kylies

[Drake]
Yeah, I got 20 damn Kendalls (20, ayy)
Young slim baddies and they en vogue
Yeah, I got 20 fuckin' Gigis
