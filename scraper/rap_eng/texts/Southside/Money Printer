[Chorus]
I been taking niggas since I was a youngin Kylie Jenner
I grew up in the jungle all my niggas is gorillas
My mama hate I smoke but I ain't never been a quitter
Got my neighbors watching me they think I got a money printer

Last time a bitch snitched I can't even remember
Never took my ice
For all you niggas that won't surrender you gone lose like you fighting with a public defender

I pay the bills then hustle like I'm broke, I got the skills, don't that make you choke don't kill but I ain't no joke. I been taking niggas since I was a youngin Kylie Jenner I grew in the jungle all my niggas is gorillas my mama hate I smoke but I ain't Neva been a quitter got my neighbors watching me they think I got a money printer. I been taking niggas since I was a youngin Kylie Jenner grew up in the jungle all my niggas is gorillas mama hate I smoke but I ain't Neva been a quitter got my neighbors watching me they think I got a money printer
