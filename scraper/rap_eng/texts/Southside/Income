All day, all night for des income

{Ak Debris}
I know a nigga named Tunie n this bitch Josalina
She called him an addict, I just called em heavy leaner
Lean in the cooler, weed for a heater
You ain't smoke reefer
Ak gas greener
Klashinkov shawty fuck yo millimetre
King z is a farmer he got loud by the meter
Z love geekin, he a outgeek a geeker
Fuckin molly, fuckin mary, swear dat boy is a freaker
I wait for my vato, smokin tobbaco
Cologne 1 million, breath on colorado

{Chorus}
Income, Income, Income, Income
I gives a fuck if you like me, I like
Income, Income, Income, Income, Income
All day, all night for des income
