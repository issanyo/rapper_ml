Ay, Herbo...
G Herbo, G Swervo

[Hook]
You know I keep them Yerkys on me
My bitch bad she twerking on me
I stay strapped, no girdle on me
Tryna quit that drank, I'm workin' on it

[Bridge]
Nigga you don't know my problems, this shit ain't easy
Nigga I might die tomorrow, they don't believe me
Don't show no remorse or sorrow, like I'm a Demon
I put money over everything, and I really mean it

[Verse 1]
Ain't a nigga could fuck with G Herbo, if so put him on me
Every time I pop out bitches on me, see fuck niggas on me
50k all hundreds, 50's on me, them lil digits on me
Ain't even gotta have a nickel on me, that shit still is on me
Cause my bank account is overloaded, pull up motor rollin'
50 rounds with 1 in the chamber, had to overload it
2014 we had straight A's, Ranges, smacked them up and sold it
60 racks I got lined up in back-ends, and I'm gonna blow it
Pull up, get the back-end, I can't slide the Mac in
I paid 2, 3 car notes for my Uber, just to ride to 'Raq in
I pop 1, 2 Percs they make me super
Southside bring the sack in
Don't play tough with me cause I'ma shoot ya
I don't got time for scrapping

[Hook]
You know I keep them Yerkys on me
My bitch bad she twerking on me
I stay strapped, no girdle on me
Tryna quit that drank, I'm workin on it

[Bridge]
Nigga you don't know my problems, this shit ain't easy
Nigga I might die tomorrow, they don't believe me
Don't show no remorse or sorrow, like I'm a Demon
I put money over everything, and I really mean it

[Verse 2]
Throwing B's and I really mean it, I'm really bleedin'
I might turn the week to killer season, give me a reason
I heard niggas out there switching sides, committing treason
I'll take 10 of yours for 1 of mine, that's getting even
Sipping drank, I'm popping Perkys, I might do a 30
Hear fuck nigga mention Herbie, we gon' do him dirty
They don't understand the codes I live by
Just because I get high, I'ma bounce back, watch soon as
I quit high, they'll be on my dick now
I'm like "fuck it though" they can't say I don't get duckets
Though, I'm tryna pour up a 6 now, I don't got a M
I'm stackin' shit by the hundreds though
Broke niggas act like I'm rich now, and since I pay 1 or 2
Stacks for my jeans, I could spend that on my bitch now
That Givenchy, Versace, Goyard, and Balmain
Look like a manikin mixmatch

[Hook]
You know I keep them Yerkys on me
My bitch bad she twerking on me
I stay strapped, no girdle on me
Tryna quit that drank, I'm workin on it

[Bridge]
Nigga you don't know my problems, this shit ain't easy
Nigga I might die tomorrow, they don't believe me
Don't show no remorse or sorrow, like I'm a Demon
I put money over everything, and I really mean it
