[Verse]
Look, they don't wanna see me winnin at all
They don't wanna see my crooked smile grinnin at all
They don't want me in Bal Harbour spendin ten in the mall
Got hit with a few shells but they ain't finish me off
Parlayzed a nigga face up and twisted my jaw
I'm still the illest, still killin, still spittin the raw
Write about the shit I did or the shit that I saw
I was really in the streets, you ain't live it at all
You ain't never come to the hood, you ain't visit at all
You ain't have to say rest in peace cause your nigga was gone
Only time you bust your gun is when you get on a song
I got the scope on the rifle I can hit 'em from long
Yeah, Westside said, "keep killin 'em, I employ you
Kill everything and make it hard for them to ignore you"
Listen to New York radio, bet the shit bore you
They playin all the corny niggas like the shit normal
It's crazy, niggas can paint they nails
Niggas dress like bitches and the shit still sells
Beads in they dreads and dyin they hair colours
I hit you with this guage, you fly in the air, fucker
I'm from a city where you die if you stare, fucker
I'ma be rider until I get the chair, fuck it
Wrist watches glisten
I learn from OGs, instead of runnin my mouth
I would just sit watch and listen
I quick pop the clip in
And we get the shit poppin
And get to clippin niggas like Chris, Doc and Griffin
You get hit in your top 'til your shit drop in liquid, uhh
A straight hollow hit your bitch top and lift it
Griselda by Fashion Rebels, bitch I'm a misfit
The streets say I remind 'em of Chris Wallace mix with
Sean Price and Sigel, my shit popped just listen
The jewels in every bar you just gotta listen
My family never had shit, I switched our condition
I'm 'bout to get my momma a big pot to piss in
Used to get the yay and use the big pot to whip it
Ziplock it, then I use my bitch pot to pitch it, haha
