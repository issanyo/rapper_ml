[Intro]
8-8-8-8-808 Mafia

[Chorus: G Herbo, Chief Keef & Both]
Niggas bitches, yeah I know
Pop out, scared to tote they poles
Remember 2012, we was selling blow
See 4-7, had to tuck and roll
Used to walk our blocks, upping poles
Now we pop out, up them rolls
Foe'nem gon jump out, Hollows blow
Know where I go the Hummers go
To all my dead guys, I say, "rest up"
Mama told me, "step up"
Know you gotta catch up, feds can't even catch us
Get on our bad side, that's bad luck, nigga
I'm here, then I'm there, I'm Casper, nigga

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
And my niggas lurking, they catch you right there
That's the last spot, nigga (skrr)
Ride with them 30’s on our lap, I ain't using no stash box, nigga
We loading up fat Glocks
These whips, these masks hot, red dots
All fuck niggas see red dots
Everybody receive head shots

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Ayy
You Hail Mary fuck nigga toe tags
Doing them bitches like quarterbacks
Ring on your bell, did you order that shit?
Shit ain't enough, need more than that
Gotta take a Fiji water, pour it in that
Big shells on top, big Norbit fat
Foe'nem two blocks away, a little more than that

[Verse 3: G Herbo]
Hop out the whips, it's a light show
That's what it looks like
Folks calling me, I'ma bang on some lil' ice
Glizzy on me, but he told me, "Big bro, I'ma kill a fuck nigga on sight, what he look like?"
100 years in the whip, we in traffic
The Jakes on the left, so I'm busting a ri'night
Stepped over niggas gon' hop on the E-way and sit at the table, we waiting on some ribeyes

[Verse 4: Chief Keef]
[?] block on ri'night, we busting a li'neft
Closing a [?], busting up in there
Cup in my hand What's up in there
Got a new [?] she eat me up in there
Seen your spot, meet me up in there
Got [?], 'fore you even get there
Duck duck goose with a scope, you just sittin' there (Ha ha)

[Chorus: Chief Keef, G Herbo & Both]
To all my dead guys, I say, "rest up"
Mama told me, "step up"
Know you gotta catch up, feds can't even catch us, nigga
Get on our bad side, that's bad luck, nigga
I'm here, then I'm there, I'm Casper, nigga
Niggas bitches, yeah I know
Pop out, scared to tote they poles
Remember 2012, we was selling blow
See 4-7, had to tuck and roll
Used to walk our blocks, upping poles
Now we pop out, up them rolls
Foe'nem gon jump out, Hollows blow
Know I go where the bums go

[Verse 5: G Herbo, Chief Keef & Both]
You ain't even gonna see it when we hop out, windows tinted
They scared to look in the back, but we in it
I ain't even been on the hill in a minute
But i said don't play with GloLimit
Slow up, Swervo, let me get it
Nigga's ain't even got legs, tryna kick it
Smokin' loud, how we sound?
[?] don't party around
Bust down shit, 60k on my wrist wear
You said she loyal, but your bitch just stared
2500 to buy what i wear
1200 just to get head, I don't care
We hit your block from the rear (from the rear)
You can get shot like a deer (like a deer)
Assault rifle black like my hair (like my hair)
This shit is clearer than air (clearer than air)
And we hittin' I swear
Draco airin' out everybody out there (everybody out there)
Nigga ridin' with it, I swear (swear)
Pull on your block, but ain't nobody out there (nobody out there)
FaceTime (FaceTime)
A sign (a sign)
Tell us (tell us)
That you're outside (you're outside)
Slow up (slow up)
That’s his house, right?
Nigga's been bitches whole life (whole life)
See him, gonna kill him on sight (on sight)
