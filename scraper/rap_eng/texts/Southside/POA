[Intro]
Oh yeah, Super Super
Astronaut, yeah

[Chorus]
Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin’ too specific
10 black whips, I'm too consistent
To my foreign bitches, tell me if I'm too persistent
All my baby mamas, I just bought ‘em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney, I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's
I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym

[Verse 1]
I’m 'bout to fuck up some mula
But you ain't owe me no check
I don’t care if you was my daddy
Bitch I'ma cut off your neck
We rockin' VV's and SS's
I swear they get a lil’ crowded
My chains; they fight for attention
My neck'll get a lil’ rowdy
I'm doin' my thizzle my nizzle
I work me the price down the middle
I keep me a bag of those Skittles
Tryna get you a radical feelin'
Automatic, it came with no ceiling
All this trappin' it got you offended
Hit a 3-6-0 in a minute
Then I punch on the gas a lil harder
I be whippin' the Lamb like a Charger
Get that money in the bag like a robber
When I whip it? I whip it up harder
To the young niggas rockin' the Starters
I was sittin' in the back of the MARTA
Now I sit in the back of a foreign
Soon as I took off the ‘Rari
I got the clutch in the carbon (Brr, brr)

[Chorus]
Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin’ too specific
10 black whips, I’m too consistent
To my foreign bitches...tell me if I’m too persistent
All my baby mamas, I just bought ‘em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney, I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's
I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film
I'm 'bout to push me a weight, you won’t catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won’t catch me in the gym

[Verse 2]
Why you be lookin' so foul? Whoa (Whoa)
I put the hundreds in piles (Whoa, whoa)
We 'bout to roll up some Franklins (Yeah)
We 'bout to roll up some loud (Yeah)
You better stay in your lane (Yeah)
I'm swervin' all over the map (Ya)
I got a Panamanian
With her lil' pretty face all in my lap (Ya)
I let her go to Sak's Fifth Avenue
Runnin' some laps (I swerve)
Sometimes I go to Chanel
And I sit in the bitch like it’s a trap (Yeah)
Rolex store's in my bando (Pluto)
Boy George Bush with the ammo (Yeah)
I spent an M on indo (Scrilla)
Put it on an 18-wheeler (Re'd up)
Trappin' and rappin', finessin' (Talk to her)
I go beyond for the scrilla (Add it up)
Freezin' that ice out your chest (Talk to her)
You lookin’ just like a dealer (Yeah)
Add it all up on an iPad (Add it up)
Talk to the plug on a car phone (Talk to her)
Went to Miami and re'd up (Ballin')
Rovers (Woah), Porsches (Porsches)

[Chorus]
Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin’ too specific
10 black whips, I'm too consistent
To my foreign bitches, tell me if I’m too persistent
All my baby mamas, I just bought ‘em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney, I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's
I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym

[Verse 3]
I'm 'bout to water whip it (Whip it up)
So I could fuck up a bag (Fuck up a sack)
I'm 'bout to cop me a Mazzi (Cop me a Mazzi)
I'm ‘bout to cop me a Jag (Cop me a Jag)
I done made 21 million (21)
I got Ezekiel stacks (Ezekiel stacks)
I done made 21 million (What?)
I had to run up a sack (I ran up a bag)
I'm 'bout to twerk dem numbers (Twerk)
'Bout to go get me a hundred (Yeah)
I done went gram from gram (Gram)
I done been workin' a hundred (Workin' a hundred)
I made a fair amount (A fair amount)
Stunted and doubled my digits (I doubled 'em)
Just know that Pluto is hungry (Pluto)
Like when I worked the midget (I worked)
I'm an original gang member (Original)
I'm not a New Edition (Yeah)
They ain’t gonna never be able to see me
I'm ‘bout to make them admit it (Make 'em admit it)
Everywhere I go is Fiji (Fiji)
Everywhere shine for the city (Shine)
Everywhere I go is foreign (Foreign)
Wake up, and take off the ceilin' (Take off the ceilin')

[Chorus]
Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
Shit gettin’ too specific
10 black whips, I'm too consistent
To my foreign bitches, tell me if I’m too persistent
All my baby mamas, I just bought ‘em brand new Benzes
I need a power of attorney, I'm 'bout to fuck up some M's
I need a power of attorney, you need to get this on film
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym
