[Intro: Havoc, (Fredro Starr)]
Yeah nigga, haha yeah
(South Suicide Queens)
That’s right! Uh, uh! QU nigga
(Yeah, yeah, shit like that)
Knowhamsayin’ put these drinks up
Yaheard? Let’s do this right, what yo

[Verse 1: X-1]
Hold up, this is for my thugs on the block
For my one stop niggas that be huggin’ the spot
Sittin’ on crates, gettin loaded, get that cake
Dodgin’ drinks, spit and hafta cover they face
Kick some tye, big truck with tricks inside
In too deep, tryna sell bricks from the side
See no games, with real niggas from other hoods
Car titles get lost, some niggas get jooked
But God forgive me if a nigga cross the fam
Holdin’ the heat, the streets’ll make me force ya hand
From my wild crew, sets the new guns off the roof
To them slick dudes, hot and they workin the phone booth
Cuz Lord knows I’m gonna reload and bust back
Incredible gats, indicted for a federal rap
They ain’t duck low enough, shots shredded they hat
Murdered and gone, nigga it’s a medical fact

[Chorus: Havoc]
Hold up, this is for my gangsta team
And my dime little mamis rockin’ Timbs and jeans
When it’s on, know we ain’t afraid to clap them things
In the club, gettin’ bent, goin’ cra-zay!
Hold up, this is for my gangsta team
And my dime little mamis rockin’ Timbs and jeans
When it’s on, know we ain’t afraid to clap them things
In the club, gettin’ bent, goin’ cra-zay!

[Verse 2: Fredro Starr]
Hold up, this is for my chicks in the spot
All my bus stop bitches that be pushin’ them drops
Playin’ the gate, get it ma, get those papes
Hustle that face, seven G’s below ya waist
Project chick, dippin’ whips, cruisin’ the strip
Gettin’ money for tuition, go to school and she strip
Kill in the club, when niggas dicks get hard
Murda mami set you up and niggas bricks get robbed
Help her soul if a chick try to set my team
I’m tying her up, rep till the death of Queens
All my staircase niggas keep flippin’ the jun’s
All my outta state niggas keep gettin’ them ones
Guns in the air, hit you with invisible Glocks
That mean you never see it comin’ nigga, 52 shots
I’m takin’ ya block nigga, if you like it or not
You either roll or get rushed, I guess not

[Chorus: Havoc]
Hold up, this is for my gangsta team
And my dime little mamis rockin’ Timbs and jeans
When it’s on, know we ain’t afraid to clap them things
In the club, gettin’ bent, goin’ cra-zay!
Hold up, this is for my gangsta team
And my dime little mamis rockin’ Timbs and jeans
When it’s on, know we ain’t afraid to clap them things
In the club, gettin’ bent, goin’ cra-zay!

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Sticky Fingaz, the nigga that be stickin’ them spots
For all my gun-cock niggas that be bustin’ off shots
Lay in the straight, black mask raidin’ ya gate
Show me ya safe before I put two in ya face
Dirt on my kicks, hoodies all lookin’ for whips
Catch a rat nigga, leave his Bentley sittin’ on bricks
Bloody ice-pick fights in the yard ten times
Outta ten, step to me and ya life get scarred
Shoot-outs in broad daylight, bustin’ at feds
Dirty cops with a ki of coke, bring ’em out dead
For my jail niggas, stashin’ bangers deep in they cots
For my grimy niggas, hidin’ under cars from cops
Empty the Glock, hitchu with disposable gats
Bust you, wipe it off, throw it away, it’s a rap
What nigga? I see you back in the hood scrap
Turn ya Benz to a coffin’ nigga, straight like that

[Chorus: Havoc]
Hold up, this is for my gangsta team
And my dime little mamis rockin’ Timbs and jeans
When it’s on, know we ain’t afraid to clap them things
In the club, gettin’ bent, goin’ cra-zay!
Hold up, this is for my gangsta team
And my dime little mamis rockin’ Timbs and jeans
When it’s on, know we ain’t afraid to clap them things
In the club, gettin’ bent, goin’ cra-zay!
Hold up…
