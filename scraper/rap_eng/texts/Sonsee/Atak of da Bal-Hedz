What’s the matter with my brain?
I can’t think clear, oh it’s the hair
Run and get the razor gotta make it disappear
There, now I got an open mind, plus some grease to give it shine

[Fredro Starr]
Bald heads and hoodies, black jeans and boots scuffed
Move by the millions and children stay rough for the
One for the road, sell outs get wetted
Wild to rip and conflicts get deaded
Gats and backwards baseball caps
When I react I set traps, no haps they get jacked

[Hook: Onyx]
It's attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)

[Sonee Seeza]
Most times I get dirty, down low
Scandalous, crazy conniving, wild, suckers know I’ll smoke em like the bloody buddah
Bless bald head style, triple zero against ya grain I shaved em close and nicked em
Cause it’s just another victim

[Sticky Fingaz]
Shhh, what, what’s up? Listen do you hear what I hear? [Yeah!]
Sounds like an intruder comin in the rear
[Come on Sticky, stick em!] nah I wanna kick em
I got the Glock cocked I’m with it, now they gonna get it

[Big DS]
I got ‘em, I shot ‘em, he hit rock bottom
I flip it, get wicked and wild when I spot em
DS knows best, yep I pack a heater
Twenty bags of cheeba, slow up ya damn speeder

[F] We rush on 'em hard (Bring 'em out dead!)
[S] Onyx rush on 'em hard (Bring 'em out dead!)
[SF] Bald heads rush on 'em hard (Bring 'em out dead!)
[DS] Stinkin, what the hell was they thinkin?

[Hook: Onyx]
The bald heads..
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
.. bald headz, ATTACK!

[Fredro Starr]
I got news now,  for crews  no way no how
(So GIVE IT AWAY, GIVE IT AWAY, GIVE IT AWAY NOW!)
Smooth as a baby’s ass, headed for the body blast buddy
Escaping through the ghetto, kicks muddy
Wilder than Wolverine, run with the scheme team, meaner than Mean Gene
Obscene and heads clean, so well aware, farewell
There goes the big bell, and that means see ya hate to be ya

[Sonee Seeza]
My clean bean production, so damn disgusting
In the cut bust ya gut and head bustin
Ain’t no escapin the madface invasion
Hot ice and cold steel pressin up in your grill
Word to God I get odd, and even
Leave a punk dead out
Slice up the scalp, man I’ll leave ya head in shreds
Attack of the bald heads, attack of the bald heads

[Sticky Fingaz]
AIYYO!!! What's goin on with the world?
Yesterday, seen a bald head girl
WHAT? MOVE!! You heard what I said
I wouldn't be caught dead without a bald head
Make one false move and I'mma fill ya with lead
Cause there's enough dum-dum bullets for ya whole bum bum-rush crew, who should I do?
Attack of the bald heads, WE COMIN THROUGH!

[Hook: Onyx]
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)

[Sonee Seeza]

[Sticky Fingaz]
