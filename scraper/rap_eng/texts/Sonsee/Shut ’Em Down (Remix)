[Intro: Noreaga & Fredro Starr]
Yeah-yeah-yeah! Yeah-yeah
Southside Queens shit!
Official Naz, word up!
South Bronx shit, hah!
Yo, Big Pun, Noreaga, what the deal?
Official Naz in here, yo!

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
This is it now, you get shut down
Official Naz got the whole game locked down
Noreaga, Big Pun holding’ it down
This is it now, you get shut down

[Verse 1: Noreaga]
Yo, aiyyo I smoke weed from housing pa, Phillies is hot one
Niggas beta stop dunn, or catch a hot one
I’m like the Top Gun, Mohawk shit, rock my hat back
As long you don’t fuck with Onyx then you safe in Iraq
I like to dubba, all of my niggas, we tear the cover up
From Iraq to Baltimore we do a song
Keep the shit fuckin’ ghetto like a hood see-saw
So what what, fuckin dick, what’s the recall for?
Yo, every other week you got a brand new law
Yo, them crackheads not, knowing, what to do wit they time
That’s why they really wanna, focus on Iraq crime
So what what, fuck you, nigga yo we taking shine

[Verse 2: Sonee Seeza]
Shut ’em down, second wave desert BX style
We rep wow, up close, hoes be ya mom’s dead child
Fucked up like blowing fed trial, it’s set now
Get blown down, you sped (Pow) Exile
My cartel drop shells, burn a 100 L’s
You frail, we raise hell, you, niggas, get blazed well
You get closed now, hosed down, verbal semi mad a cap
With a Henny habit, I murk any static
Like a madman going Postal, Postal
Touch mics, froze you fuck it, son I Gosu

[Verse 3: Fredro Starr]
Word up, I’m not a killa, I just bust a lot
Run in the spot with a rusted Glock, then I bust a shot
It’s not a game, don't be in it for life
Shit is hot son, send ’em to Christ, surrender ya ice
Criminal life is dangerous ill
Trained to kill in the stainless steel, your brain spilled
The game is real, you playing wit death
Got grimy niggas that’ll label you West and lay you to rest
South to a side wake the dead, hate is spread
Spread three eights and let it raise ya head
Jail bound eternally hell bound
22 shots of shell round, rock ya head in the ground

[Chorus: Fredro Starr, (Noreaga)]
(So what-what) This is it now, you get shut down
Official Naz got the whole game locked down
(So what-what) Noreaga, Big Pun holding’ it down
This is it now, you get shut down

[Verse 4: Big Pun]
Yo, I’m the livest nigga alive, watch me show you
I’ll blow your head of your shoulders, your own mother won’t know you
My squad is supernatural, don’t make me blast you with a Ruger capsule
My crew will catch you and trap you inside of Koopa’s Castle
I turn ya soon to statue like Medusa’s looking at you,
Produce the future raps or subtract you like dudes in math do
I’m always moving past you, even when I use the bathroom
Wipin’ my asshole with pages straight out the book of Matthew
I’m looking at you with my third optical vision
I hop out of prison and find me a hot little tropical woman
Now I’m locked in position, ready to rock with conviction
Chewbacca’s descendants hitting you with cosmical weapons
You might as well listen cuz you out of suggestions
Out of submission, if you can’t stand the heat get out of the kitchen
Peace to Onyx, I miss them for they knowledge and wisdom
Pay homage and listen to hip-hop’s newest and most violent addition

[Verse 5: Sticky Fingaz]
Yeah, Sticky Fingaz, I’m still alive
That mean the greatest rapper of all time ain’t never died
I’m underground, too hard for the radio
MTV won’t even play my video
They scared to death mothafuckuz trying to ban me
I’m the one who told Ol’ Dirty to shut down the Grammys
You think that they can get with me, Stick
I burn all o’ya, I don’t care if Puffy do ya remix
I’m crazy, running up in Def Jam with a handgun
Fuck a royalty, I’m a hold Russell for ransom
I’ll make you sleep where the worms do
I couldn’t care less if you ate shit and died and turned blue
Niggas like us gonna bring the game back
There’s so many wack rappers out here, I don’t know where to aim at
I swear to God ain’t nobody touching me
Next time you see me gonna be the last thing you ever see

[Chorus: Fredro Starr, (Noreaga)]
Word up, this is it now, you get shut down
Official Naz got the whole game locked down
(So what-what) Noreaga, Big Pun holding’ it down
This is it now, you get shut down
(So what-what) This is it now, you get shut down
Official Naz got the whole game locked down
(So what-what) Noreaga, Big Pun holding’ it down
This is it now, you get shut down
(So what-what)
