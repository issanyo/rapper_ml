[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!) We the niggas that call the shots
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!) We the niggas that call the shots

[Verse 1: X-1]
Street niggas love to flip, puttin' slugs in clips
While in out with Bloods and Crips, on some shit
Leavin' you ripped is totally sick
I sue pricks on mysterious trips, makin' serious chips
You on a curious a trip way out of your whack
Blow you out of your back, the game of crack, how 'bout that?
Holdin' my aim, with ways to wreck
Never know what to expect, respect a hole in you chest
My mind is set, it's time for death, rewind your steps
The way that I'm doin' you is everyday screwin' you
Off the top, make money off of rocks
On and off the block, bouncin' off on cops
Whose the next street star? Kid, you'd love to be next
But it's X-1, kid, in the luxury Lex'
Wit' a ghetto type style
Heat for beef that we can settle right now… street niggas

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!) We the niggas that call the shots
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!) We the niggas that call the shots

[Verse 2: Fredro Starr]
Street niggas spend they last on weed, smoke to the roach
Dead broke, some flip coke, sell soap
Bust fo' guns off the roof, drink overproof
Roll dice, stick niggas for ice, up all night
Everyday niggas gamblin, pumpin drugs scramblin'
My nigga got shot, that same spot you standin' in
Bitch nigga hate, rich nigga sniff a eight
Suffocate, jail nigga liftin' weight. Fuck the Jake!
We break laws, snuffin motherfuckers breakin jaws
Robbin liquor stores, reppin' ghetto niggas dirty drawers
Never hesitate to blast; kick your fuckin' ass
Fuck work! Nigga take cash, with the quick fast
Open cases, where razors, lay open faces
Paid niggas got guns wit lasers, SkyPagers
Chrome rims and loud systems, so at the light
To make the white people listen you 5 days out the prison
We…

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!) We the niggas that call the shots
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!) We the niggas that call the shots

[Verse 3: Sonsee]
Street niggas have your shit pushed back, plush act
Bust jacks out the windowplex, and lust that
We back, we at the place, contact react
Call back, be on the concrete flat, we stomp cats
For violation of [?] whichever come first
Love for money could hurt, it's a thirst, we splurge
In Suburbans, to niggas deep, want pissy early
Swervin', packin' big power, maxin' six hours
Up in the Expo, [E Bauer?]. For beef, the heat, the vowel
Caught up in them street showers
Buckun' the same clips, fuckin' the same chicks
The game sticks, so remain slick or get slain quick
Street niggas regulatin', doe and hoes
And North states, and flip whips high speed car chases
The inner belly beast dwellin', born and raised
Extortin' for days, leavin' motherfuckers more than grazed

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!) We the niggas that call the shots
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!) We the niggas that call the shots

[Verse 4: Sticky Fingaz]
I'm a street nigga, fuck wit me get shot in the brains
They call me Sticky Fingaz, how you think I got my name?!
This is not a game, kid I know my math
I walk around with my pants hangin' off my ass
I don't give a fuck! This nigga here's too rugged
I pull out my dick and take a piss in public
Smokin' weed, drinkin' brew, that's all I do
Fuck bitches, get money, was all I knew!
Police in the rearview, always runnin' my plates
I kept a, poker face and a gun in my waist
Off safety, cocked with, one in the head
The first nigga frontin' gettin' dropped with one in the head
I got no respect for life, my mind's on drugs
You scared to look me in the eyes, I roll wit nuttin' but thugs
I'm so trife, hope I can live another night
And I fear no man, I swear on my mother's life
Cuz I'm a…

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
(Street niggas!) Gettin' high all the time
(Street niggas!) Fuck beef and draw the nine
(Street niggas!) Always yellin' fuck the cops
(Street niggas!)
