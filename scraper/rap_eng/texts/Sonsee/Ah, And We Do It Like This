[Hook]
Ah, and we do it like this
Ah, and we do it like this
Ah, and we do it like this
Ah, and we do it like this

[Verse 1]
Days like scenery rap in our radar
Got no time, my problem is debater
Due to circumstances my mind trip
Grab a stage and puff, puff that spliff
Dance with the ladies, fellas and kin
The one who claims is not your friend
To be concerned of taking a earn
No use in cheating, and don’t you act stern
Mindless brother going to rot
A freshly dip from that old rap pot
The big bang theory marching our theory
A mother's heart is a heart that's weary
All show-stoppers, national known
Better hold yours cause I'm holding my own
[?]
Some say Ty, some say Tyrone

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Well, here's a little something for you all to learn
Money to make, cheeba to burn
First you feel the high then you feel the low
Down on your luck and you know how it goes
Now you sitting down at home watching cartoons
Fred Flinstone, Tom & Jerry too
Had three kids and a beautiful wife
But then you went crazy and stabbed them with a knife
Now you sitting in a jail sitting in a cell
Feeling fired up, but you going through hell
Oh, I'm that brother that makes you all shiver
I'm the MC that always deliver

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I’m a smooth fellow, back is not yellow
Playing it safe like a game of othello
Mellow as a cello, never bulges like Jello
Papa got a 40, I sip on my mellow
Put it in a order, [?] slaughter
Jimmy had a nickel, Fredro had a quarter
Start moving, rappers is improving
Party so loud the mannequins start moving
People are enjoying jiving around
A country sound that’ll make you get down

[Hook]


[Verse 4]
Check me out to distinguish, all the time genius
Hit suave [?]
Tryna get small
Better dress warm cause a brother like me takes the place by storm
Leaving no ends for brothers I doubt
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
Should respect like the Pope and leave your mouth open
Pull the biggest drive cause I got the longest rope in

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
Check it out everybody, a new fly tune
[?]
People, people jumping around
People, people getting down
But all they hearing is my high tune sounds
Back in the days, people used to say
That's the crew was lazy
But then he got a gun, had him on the run
Now they calling him crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
Check one, we don't care how we gon' slay it
What to learn and what to obey
How to feel great when you’re feeling blue
What to do when your day is through
My nigga make, make things to get
Yeah, it’s time to get righ, it’s time to get nice
You gotta get ready for the sacrifice
Ain’t no half stepping, ain’t no weapon
[?] gets all the respect

[Hook]

[Verse 7]
Cool Suave and I’m on the mic
Kick fly raps cause you know I’m like
I’m hyper, this the cat that’s best to go sniper
And I’mma have to get piper
Just like a typer, coon kind of brother
Cool Suave is the late night lover

[Hook]

[Verse 8]
What’s a man to do after living in fear
Reach for a gun at 20 years in life
Shit, can’t see his wife
She gets caught for trying to slip in a knife
That’s not for me as you can all see
So ain’t no gun around that table
But I’m barely here living and able
Throw up your fist, shall get bliss
Blast, now you in a body cast

[Hook]

[Verse 9]
Smooth as ballet on a warm sunny day
Smooth operator like Sade would say
Hit the bass in your voice, tone like [?]
Get on the mic, put on your dance shoes
Quest for the fire burns my desire
Like a baritone in ya damn church choir

[Hook]
