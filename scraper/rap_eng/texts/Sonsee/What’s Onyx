[Intro: Fredro Starr]
Yo what's the problem?
That's what I thought nigga
What the fuck you lookin’ at? Yeah!
Yo for all the our street niggas
All my project niggas
All the niggas out on the corners
And the fuckin’ everyday struggle
Come on! Yeah! What! Yeah!
Tired of these niggas man
Straight like that
Fuck that! Yeah! What! Yeah!
Survive for these niggas
Onyx to the death mutherfuckers

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Onyx is gritty, grimey, the gutter, projects
Techs, nines, black Escalades
Low down, shiftee, mad at the world
Straight gully, villians, crooks, thieves
Terrorists, killers, drug dealers
Hennessey, ecstasy, weed, Queens
Brooklyn, robbin’, stealin’, stabbin’
Shootin’, wylin’, criminals, thugs

[Verse 2: Sonsee]
Bloods, Crips, disaster, war
One gun, two gun, three gun, four
Rich, poor, life, death
God the devil, Onyx the rebels
Pain, anger, danger, real
Chicks banger, knives, guns
Streets, gutters, robbers, mothers
Bacdafucup, move back motherfuckers

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz, sample]
Onyx is love and hate
Onyx is motherfuckin’ spit in your face
Onyx is a highspeed police car chase
Onyx is puttin’ a hot gun in your waist
Move back motherfuckers!
Onyx is pride
Onyx is shootouts with your moms inside
Onyx is robbery turned homicide
Onyx is livin’ when you thought you’s gon die
Move back motherfuckers!

[Verse 3: Sonsee]
We spicks, rivals, braids, heads
We bang, murderous, metaphor, dance
Newer, quicker, hyper, calmer
Bigger, faster, better, stronger
Obnoxious, filthy, villians, thieves
Tougher, enormous, higher performance
Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Manhattan
Long Island, shinnin’, we rhymin’, [?] it

[Verse 4: Fredro Starr]
Ayo we wild ass niggas
Jump over the stage in the crowd ass niggas
Scream on the mic, fuckin’ loud ass niggas
Smackin’ all hoes, yo they foul ass niggas
Proud ass niggas, real ass niggas
Bring it to the streets, they kill y’all niggas
Killed for them Cadilac grill ass niggas
Throw your guns up if you feel my niggas
They still my niggas

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz, sample]
Onyx is thugs
Onyx is nuthin’ to ever come before blood
Onyx is betrayal by the one that you love
Onyx is lookin’ in the eyes of the judge
Move back motherfuckers!
Onyx is guns
Onyx is black jeans and air force ones
Onyx is niggas on the block sellin’ junk
Onyx is fugitives liven on the run
Move back motherfuckers!
