[Chorus:]
Phat, phat, phat-at-at-at-at-at-at-at-a-dat-dat-at and all dat

[Fredro Starr]
It’s the phat funky blunt roller, the rock ripper
Rude, ruff and right damn right the gun gripper
Look no hands but damn do I got a handle
Vandalistic, sarcastic phat tricks
Ah oh yeah, they’re a dime a dozen
Then discussin who to be bustin with my crews and crimeys
How you like that, phatter datter da datter huh
Ratta-tat-tat splatter one jump if you bad son
Phat as a blue bag of boom for you buddah bandits
I know you’re breakin on the phat tracks we’re makin
So Sonee Seeza you next up to bat
Phatter dat dat stay strapped
Peace out phat

[Chorus]

[Sonsee:]
Boy you besta move over cause we takin up crazy space
Phat ready for combat stacked with all that tracks
Not a rerun but it’s phatter than Freddy Stubbs
I rock at the grimy clubs, get blunted with phat buds
I’m here to let you know Onyx won’t lack what it take
I scrape and scruff cause I’m in the rough
Kinda like a diamond, I’m a hard rock
Can’t move me, think you’re scheming then get the semen
Out my cock a doodle do
Huh?  Who you think you’re kidding, these four villains’
Skills win and have crews through dealin
Straight up, you had enough, I’m calling your bluff
Body and fender so surrender kid you ain’t tough
You can get some phatter stuff? Huh I doubt it
But first just purchase my joint, you can’t be without it, it’s

[Chorus 2:]
P-phat-H-phat-A-phat-T-phat
P-H-A-T, P-H-A-T
P-phat-H-phat-A-phat-T-phat
P-H-A-T, P-H-A-T
P-phat-H-phat-A-phat-T-phat
P-H-A-T, P-H-A-T
P-H-A-T

[Sticky Fingaz]
Every ten years, they unleash phat sound
Well this time it’s Sticky Fingaz, God’s gift to the underground
For cryin out loud, sell outs are makin me sick
And I want revenge kid, I die for my music
You don’t understand, I worship hardcore
Ya never shoulda let me get my boot in the door
And if you think that’s a bluff then you got me all wrong son
Gettin phat like this is easier said than done
Raise up, rise and shine
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this time
Now it’s time to get phat and all of that

[Sonsee]
Ah hell, the phat rap scripts tips scales
Go longer than endless trails, play my part stay sharp as darts and nails

[Sticky Fingaz]
Ahh shut the hell up and don’t hold me back black
I’m foamin at the grill piece cause I’m ready to rip the track
Onyx is phat, so phat we need Slim Fast
With the boom shaka boom shaka boom body crash

[Chorus]
