[Verse 1: IZA Lach]
I see you standing behind the closed door
Are you afraid of me?
Or is it just your way of showing me that you’re the one?
This is insane
We both know what causes that
It's our constant playing
Instead of constant saying, you’re the one I love the most

[Chorus: IZA Lach]
I see us walking alone
It's just a matter of time
It's just want everyone wants
Us being undecided
Our hearts, they can't be so wrong
When all of it feels so right
It's just what everyone wants
Us being undecided

[Verse 2: IZA Lach]
It's so clear
That this is our own fault
No matter how we say it
No matter when we say it, it's still us who've built the wall
This is insane
We both know what causes that
It's our constant playing
Instead of constant saying  you’re the one I love the most

[Verse 3: Soopafly]
Universal law: love your all
Light go out, turn another on
Used to have a spark when the love was good
But now it might blow up if I touch it wrong
I'm only trying to change up
But that the same love, the comfort zone
I'm trying to step my game up
But you just claiming that the love is gone
She say it hurt too bad
And right now, she really can't make her mind up
And she a valley girl
So that mountain might be too hard to climb up
With the fussing and the fighting
Yelling out what I should've kept private
Struggling when we should've been striving
I just want to start smiling
But it's hard with the silence
I remember making love was timeless
Now our world is divided
And she's undecided

[Chorus: IZA Lach]
I see us walking alone
It's just a matter of time
It's just want everyone wants
Us being undecided
Our hearts, they can't be so wrong
When all of it feels so right
It's just what everyone wants
Us being undecided
I see us walking alone
It's just a matter of time
It's just want everyone wants
Us being undecided
Our hearts, they can't be so wrong
When all of it feels so right
It's just what everyone wants
Us being undecided

[Outro: IZA Lach]
Undecided
Undecided
Being undecided (everyone)
Being undecided
Being undecided (everyone)
Being undecided (it's just what everyone wants)
Undecided
