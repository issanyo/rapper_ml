[Chorus: LaToiya Williams]
We gonna take this right up to the top
(I know that you wanna hang)
We gonna make it so good you don't wanna stop
(Cause it's a party)
We gonna take this right up to the top
(I know that you wanna hang)
We gonna make it so good you don't wanna stop
(Cause it's a party..
It's a party... it's a party..
It's a party... it's a party)

[Soopafly]
Now it's a party over here, a party over there
I got hoes in a circle, bitch stop bein' square
Loosen up a bit, c'mon learn how to share
Hey hey, don't talk like that, you fuckin' with a player
You fuckin' with a real mack, when I talk they feel that
I'm chill-matic, better yet a real pimp at it
Baby don't panic, the club is just crackin'
I bust black and white bitches when I'm just actin' -
A fool like I usually do, with shooby-doo's
When you see me, you usually see two
Flyest thing on two feet, like too sweet
With so many hoes I need a boutique
Low-key to a certain degree
I'm just chillin' homeboy, your bitch flirtin' with me..

[Chorus: LaToiya Williams]
We gonna take this right up to the top
(I know that you wanna hang)
We gonna make it so good you don't wanna stop
(Cause it's a party)
We gonna take this right up to the top
(I know that you wanna hang)
We gonna make it so good you don't wanna stop
(Cause it's a party..
It's a party... it's a party..
It's a party... it's a party)

[Bad Azz]
Money, houses and cars, clothes, hats and shoes
Hoes, gats and jewels, knows that you lose
Fuckin' with his earnin's how the world get to turnin'
Niggas die over other people money, we ain't learnin'?
Paper probably pay you, but people gonna hate ya
This paper'll hurt ya and have somebody kill you
Look at how the real do
Will we ever make it through the storm?
Because of last night I don't watch the news in the mornin'
Last week the cops shot some little girl
It gave a drug dealer a chance to put some dope in the world
Since I talk about this shit they wanna come and shut me down
It's all political, like I had teflon rounds
If they cop killers, give 'em all death by injection
If they kill each other, not to give a fuck is they perfection
If they die then they clone 'em, when we ride then they on us
How we slide hittin' corners they'll rarely ever see us

[Chorus: LaToiya Williams]
We gonna take this right up to the top
(I know that you wanna hang)
We gonna make it so good you don't wanna stop
(Cause it's a party)
We gonna take this right up to the top
(I know that you wanna hang)
We gonna make it so good you don't wanna stop
(Cause it's a party)
We gonna take this right up to the top
(I know that you wanna hang)
We gonna make it so good you don't wanna stop
(Cause it's a party)
We gonna take this right up to the top
(I know that you wanna hang)
We gonna make it so good you don't wanna stop
(Cause it's a party..
It's a party... it's a party..
It's a party... it's a party)
