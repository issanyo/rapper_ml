[Kurupt]
Now I can't trust none of these hoes nowadays
'Cause they be runnin' 'round with that shit called AIDS
And every girl I meet nowadays is new
So I can't to do them what I would to do you, so...

Another session, check in session
Dogg Pound Gangstaz

[Dat Nigga Daz]
I'm on top of the world, with niggas with perms and jheri curls
Runnin' around town with the flyest girls
Ain't no place like home, nigga, that I can call my own
Smokin' dub sacks from quarter pounds down to ozones
(Who you?) I'm Dat, Nigga, D-A to the Z (uh-huh)
A motherfuckin' playa, from the D-P to the G

[Kurupt]
Connectin' lyrics like dot to dot, connectin' blocks
I concoct vocals that's libel to make your heart stop
Termination completed, and I'm out like the seasons
Murderin' MC's for no fuckin' apparent reason (motherfucker)
This, lyricist, kicks lyrics
So intent to disable to kill your whole vocal existence
Like in for instance, the murderous methods of my ridin'
The Thunderdome, niggas head I'm squabbin'
Shit, all I know is you could talk that talk (this Dogg Pound)
And you best to be able to walk that walk, because
We ride right, daylight, or after midnight
Game Trump tight, down to dump on sight
Call me the sniper with mo' chips than Wesley Snipes
Niggas oppose me, they get cracked like the pipe
Born in the East, raised a G on the West
Westside, smokin' and rollin' with a S on my chest

[Dat Nigga Daz]
I roll swift as a pigeon, diggin' niggas graves in tombstones alone
One on one, microphone or phone
Stampedin' like a heard of buffalo you tumble
Now when you try to get up, motherfucker, you stumbled
Now it's a must that I can bust, from the shots from my 12 gauge
Dust to get you high blown in the meanwhile my profile
Of my styles unusual from a buckwild child
But in the meanwhile...
I can kill that ass softly like an Al B. song
I maul fifty MC's, divided just by one
Now who's the greatest motherfucker other than myself?
Droppin' lyrical vitamins for your health, motherfucker

[Chorus]
One by one, we'll start to subtract
And see how many motherfuckers got your back
'Cause when it comes down to it, we outs to clown
It's them Dogg Pound Gangstaz, puttin' it down
One by one, we'll start to subtract
And see how many motherfuckers got your back
'Cause when it comes down to it, we outs to clown
It's them Dogg Pound Gangstaz, puttin' it down

[Dat Nigga Daz]
Now picture that ass and frame it, what a shame
Motherfucker to remain to obtain game

[Kurupt]
I'm on another journey, my mindset on twisted
Gettin' twisted and twist this fool for his grip then dash
Daz in the G, set to chirp
Strapped 'cause he don't give a fuck, and down to put in work
And this is how it's done like one, two, three
Kurupt, and I'm quick to fuck shit up on G.P., lethal
There's no stoppin' me, top notch, there's no equal
To the philosophies I concoct

[Dat Nigga Daz]
We makin' examples out of motherfuckers like you
Nigga, there's no idea, nigga, and there's no clue, you're through
You're outta here motherfucker, you finished, you scared, admit it
Your new album... shiiiit!
So realize with your two eyes that my rhyme hypnotize
Just like Jim Jones bapnitized his followers
The wrath, there's a slaughter, have you ever heard of one
Serve from my homey now he rhyme for baby sharks (and I)
I load for ammo for ammo the young hollow is dippin'
To Pomona as I ride up on you on the corner
It's kinda cold how his ass got smoked (well alright)
And now you know that we ain't no joke

[Kurupt]
I never trust a busta, so I never trust your ass
Hope via satellites around when we bust your ass
I peeped you out the side of my eyes, 'cause I be peepin'
Murderous situations, you got yourself knee deep in
You're walkin' around while you're sleepin'
So awake yourself, nigga, then break yourself
And I don't give a fuck if your money is spent
I want your hat to your clothes 'cause dollars make sense
I got so many hoes on my dick, I gotta shake hoes
And I'm controlling minds like Waco
Texas, Mr. Flossy in the Lexus
Super supreme, I plot schemes like Stephen King and

[Chorus]
One by one, we'll start to subtract
And see how many motherfuckers got your back
'Cause when it comes down to it, we outs to clown
It's them Dogg Pound Gangstaz, puttin' it down
One by one, we'll start to subtract
And see how many motherfuckers got your back
'Cause when it comes down to it, we outs to clown
It's them Dogg Pound Gangstaz, puttin' it down

[Outro: Kurupt]
DPG, yeah I thought you knew, DPG
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, DPG
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, DPG
Uh-huh, everywhere I look I see a Dogg Pound Gangsta, yeah
Every corner that I turn I see a Dogg Pound Gangsta, yeah
Every studio that I go to's a Dogg Pound Gangsta, yeah
In the cut, the Kingpin Kurupt
Biggest dick, nigga with the biggest nuts, hahahaha...
Dogg Pound Gangstaz...
