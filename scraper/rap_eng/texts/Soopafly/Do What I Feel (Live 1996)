[Chorus 1: Prince Ital]
Respect to the Death Row Inmates
Death Row Inmates lawd dem never hesitate
To bust a gun shot, in a idiot face
Dis is Dogg Pound and your life goes to waste

Free Dogg Pound territory
Dat Nigga Daz put you inna di cemetery
Snoop Dogg, di criminal mentality
Fuck wit Dirty Kurupt and yuh dead each way

[Bridge 1]
Now the D.P.'s, if ya down with this shit say "hell yeah"
Pack your heat, if you equipped say "hell yeah"
Hit a corner, hit a switch, say "hell yeah"
Fuck a hoe, fuck a bitch, say "hell yeah"
To all my G's that slang, say "hell yeah"
To all my bangers that bang, say "hell yeah"
No matter where the fuck ya hang, say "hell yeah"
Yeah, check it out

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Now here's the perfect mix to let it bubble and foam
Wait these seconds then watch the microphone get blown
It's the mischevious, lyrical genius on the loose
And I pack the deuce-deuce of some act-right juice
I'm in my own, space and time
The elevation of my rhymes elevates your mind
It's a clear blue sky and a clear blue day
For a G from DPG to wear clear blue and gray
I come, I came, I am, I ain't
The nigga ya wants to fuck with, get peeled like paint
Bottoms up, nigga, give it all ya got
From the bottom to the top or get shanked, get shot
Provocative footage of this lyrical abuse transgression
From this infectious enemy, they on a loose (What)
And unstoppable, Daz
My motherfuckin' nigga from back in the past

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz]
Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit
With no way your climbin' out, and this ain't the punishment
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react
With intentions to keep on mashin', strap to strap
Is this my boundary from county to county?
Your homies wanna try to soak me like Bounty?
Dogg Poung Gangsta all day, all night
Partying like a motherfuckin' now all night
But uhh, simple as fact I been wanting to serve your whole fucking crew
Now what you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
Load up your weapon slowly step in caught your homey straight slippin'
You shoulda known from the jump nigga that I was trippin'
I gets to bustin you gets to duckin' (Blaow blaow)
Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dippin' in the cut
My performance is enormous the way that I stayed up on em
I catch em and let em have it what's up, with my opponents
I hold it down for the two and I'll be gunned down by no one
Forever I reign, top Dogg number one
My rhyme to some explainable and Doggs that's untrainable
Uncontainable, my mind state's so strainable

[Chorus 2]
I'm a D.P.G.C. for life
I do what I feel and, I do what I like (C'mon)
I'm a D.P.G.C. for life
I do what I feel and, I do what I like (Sing it)
I'm a D.P.G.C. for life
I do what I feel and, I do what I like (Fuck that)
I'm a D.P.G.C. for life
I do what I feel and, I do what I like

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I hits it like shots, from the homey strap
I smoke indo, and I sip cognac
Give a FUCK whatcha name is, I tell ya quick
Face to face, punk you can eat a dick
Cause you're all out of time, out of sight
Out of mind, something I wouldn't do without a nine
I got a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of beat
Mashing all through the streets rollin wit some heat
I'm heated, repeat it, day after day
Daily survival tactics in L.A
I'm on point and alert
With skills like a huntin expert, fuck around and get hurt
Lurked, I puts in work like a chemist
Mentally known to cause motherfucking dilemmas
See me in black and beware
It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose out there

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, it's your shit, say "hell yeah"
Dogg Pound gangstas say "hell yeah"
When I roll throughout your block say "hell yeah"
For all my niggas that gang say "hell yeah"

[Verse 4]
If it was on where you reside, what would you do?
If you looked outside and the homies came through
Would you ride? (I ride) Would you ride (I ride)
Or would you think or by chance the circumstances of a mark
And get your ass whooped in the middle of a park?
Would you ride? (I ride) Would you ride (I ride)

[Outro]
Motherfuckers, yeah
Ya don't doubt that Snoop
Don't doubt that Snoop
Don't doubt that Snoop
