[Snoop Dogg : Intro]
Ayo Dogg
Can you give some of that shit to go a little something like
Herb is a plant

[Spanky Danky : Verse 1]
We live by the motto
There you know, Dank we trust
It’s a smoky movement
With q-pees to prove it
Maintaining our cruise speed
Smokin only OG
Lift it up, like the trees
Higher than Bee Gees
Bitches want to meet me
But they can’t smoke for free
Aroma, we you can’t be part of it
If you wasn’t there when I started it
Alcohol in my bong, is a harder it
Give a fuck right up punk ass compliment
I’m as hard as an OG
Back in the days
I got J for days in a major way smokin’ major pain and bathe ape

[Hook : x2]
We’re smoking that shit
In a major way
Say
Never want to hit
That’s Spank ‘n’ Dank
So, I get the hit
And something on the split
Down with you lick
Smoking on
Yeah

Turn it up Wanch
Turn it up Wanch
Turn it up Wanch
Turn it up Wanch

[Spanky Danky : Verse 2]
What’s life without that dirty sprite
How do you sleep without OG at night
Rest in peace Bob Barker
I guess the price was finally right
Young hippies do come out at night
Ready to party, but not starting fights
Cause that’s not what hippies do
We just smoke up any dose
The closest thing to mushrooms
My flow is bigger than this room
Big hitting hoes, get out of room
I don’t base with no clues
The devil dress is really blue
So you all just put more stress in your dose
In your dose
In your dose
In your dose

While I’m just smoking cash
Rolling hash
Twisting shit that you never had
Puffing OG man
The opposite is why I’m glad
And I’m still switching it up, twisting them blunts
Burnt everything that the one left for you chump
And even if it was I got a OG cush buzz

We’re smoking that shit
In a major way
Say
Never want to hit
That’s Spank ‘n’ Dank
So, I get the hit
And something on the split
Down with you lick
Smoking on
Yeah

[Hook : x2]

Hold it up, blow it up
Cops smell it, they know it’s us
In Dank we trust
In Dank we trust
In Dank we trust
In Dank we trust

Didn’t we ask that herb
Didn’t we ask that for us
Alright
And even that shit, believe me
You asked that herb
Herb, isn’t that that you did it four times
But it’ll be more important with me

Herb is a plant
I mean, herbs are good for everything
Why, why these people wanting so much good for everyone
For everyone, who call themselves governments and this and that
Why they say must not use the herb
