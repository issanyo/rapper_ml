Daz:
Yeah, right about now me myself, Daz Dillinger, along with The Gang
Mister Tray Deee, mister Bad Bad Carabino, and Soopafly The High Priest
Ah, letting you know that this gang banging is serious business
So thank god for your lifes, and keep on striving and struggling

I thank god for my life
What I wanted y'all to do is live right
You pray for me, I pray for you
Cause together we can get it, what else can we do?
I thank god for my life... (and that's real)

Tray Deee:
So you think drinking and chilling, big willing and dealing
Is the life for the righteous cause it's so appealing
Dealing, stealing and killing is the way to succeed
So you're illing and willing to take whatever you need
You're the villain indeed but you pleed your innocence
Say that in society you gotta be militant
It's (??) and (??) just for too damn long
You need to get in business, sing a new damn song
Like (??) and (??) as you learn to leave
So you should learn to give, that's how you earn your deeds

Big Pimpin:
Tray Deee, I gotta tell the truth: never cherish the day
Till I open up my eyes and discover the ways
This life is hard, treats you cold, plus life don't last
And plus we're dying fast and plus these fools is blasting
Yo grace is what I'm asking for
It's no chilling when that man in black is at my door
I thought I'd seen him a couple of times before
Ran back the other way, took off course and forced to cherish the day

Bad A$$:
God help us out here, we're falling down
And everything that we did build is falling down
I'm calling out cause you can help us if you touch us
And we need you, why we're bleeding
Any second we can meet you, lifestyles of earth mislead you
Have mercy on my soul, please lay me down easy
God watches, and he knows the life we live ain't easy
At least try to live right, cause life ain't long
And ain't nothing like living life all day long
Mister Bad is all good like the songs we sing
I simply gotta thank god for the life I live

Daz:
You never know what's going on in this world
Thank god I'm just still in this world
We're in the streets everyday, that's where we live
We was thaught to perceive and to give
Don't be stingy, give a little cause I do
Don't be fake and be yourself to stay true
When you see me in the streets oh get me
Don't play hate and dump at me
Don't be sad homie, only be happy
I sing this song to the streets with The Gang
Gotta live a uncut to the streets, Daz Dillinger
Will our struggle ever be over? From the wrath of the street
I pray for you, let's pray for me, let's keep it real, peace

And there you have it
A little something from The Gang and Daz Dillinger
Letting you know that life is real serious
And the situation at hand is a real situation
So think...
