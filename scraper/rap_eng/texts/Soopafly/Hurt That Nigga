[Jayo Felony]
Shut up nigga. Pass that muthafuckin weed
Let's go ride on this nigga homie, cuz
There go one right there loc
Get that nigga
Bring your muthafuckin ass, NIGGA!

I knew I was gonna have a whole lot of drama
After the first baby mama
Rob four all the titty member how they did beloved mama
Killed the bitch (?) come back from the dead with flies in ya mouth
Buried the body, sold the house, then I fly down south
My family don't understand me
Killed them and me
Punchin holes in the wall forgot a ran and nose candy
We cold-hearted and strong, you heartless and wrong
And I'm sniffin in shit tell the cartilage is gone
I'm the stone cold heavyweight that'll bait you in
Put you down with my team fool, and make you win
I laid the Cut with mouth shut 47 sprayed
Prepare for the outcome and pray for my prey
Then we getting shotty kill a bitin nigga with Young Gotti
Then we eat a pork chop meal and we all dead body
With extra gravy nigga, bottles said he couldn't save me nigga
Ya man done tried to grab the gun and made me killa, yeah!

[Chorus: Jayo] (2x)
Y'all better tell, cuz I hurt that nigga
I'll make six men carry and dirt that nigga
Put some bitches all in to work that nigga
Take my .38 special and red shirt that nigga

[Soopafly]
Niggas better step the fuck back I'm ready for war
Napalm bomb strickin close range I'm raw
You can't star, blinded by the gleam of the par
I teach y'all the Soopafly ways of the law
Let me shimmy shake rock whether you like it or not
You lay up with hoes I make a bitch sleep on a cot
Top of the chart, the underground straight from the pound
I bust by round by round by round and round
I'm in concert for servin niggas get yo ticket
I lock a nigga out, good cop giminy cricket
Watch out, I stick like stuck-o
Make 'em say "uh oh"
Motto is to trust no bitch you let the mutt go
Yo, I stay crackin, shut yo trap black and stay back in
Yo I break 'em you rack 'em
Bitches, I mack 'em
Bit game, I'm gonna teach you latnum
Niggas talk shit I put on my dance shoes and tap 'em
Niggas get broked up crapped out
Bent over with your backs out
I circle like a track route
I screw more niggas than a frat house
Joined to camp to step up to get stepped, Yo

[Chorus: Soopafly] (2x) (3rd line changes to bitches 2nd time)
Y'all better tell, cuz I hurt that nigga
I'll make six men carry and dirt that nigga
I send some hoes, man, to work that nigga
Pull out the .4-5 special and red shirt that nigga

[Bridge: ??]
Some niggas come right some niggas come wrong
We can (?) until the dawn
On and on and on and on
Blast until the breath is gone

[Soopafly]
If it's death that you want it's death that you gettin
Good life and good riddins, get them wigs to splittin
I measure niggas for they casket fits
Past tenants get erased off the face of the earth
Killin for turf
The "Cha cha" give it up quick
Double up, I double my grip
Quicker than set trip
Get wet tip of my tech rips ya neck
Gents fall it hit y'all
Like six draw, leavin bullets on the wall

[Jayo Felony]
Try to set me up and blast me
Couldn't get past me
I heard someone shot 'im up with body acid, nasty
Talk shit but you ran, nigga you shook wit it
I take the RI Saprano and shoot you wit it
Killa, I spit this shit fo' real, nigga get back
No more eattin egg yolk I put sick to the six pack
I'm harder than the hardest hardcore nigga get ya shit right
Or get your project bricks clipped tonight, bitch

[Chorus: Jayo]
Y'all better tell, cuz I hurt that nigga
I'll make six men carry and dirt that nigga
Put some bitches all in to work that nigga
Take my .38 special and red shirt that nigga

[Chorus: Soopafly]
Y'all better tell, cuz I hurt that nigga
I'll make six men carry and dirt that nigga
I'll send some hoes over to work that nigga
Pull out the .4-5 special and red shirt that nigga
