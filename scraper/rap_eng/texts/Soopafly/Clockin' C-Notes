[Intro: Soopafly]
Aw yeea, ha ha ha, yeea

D-A-Z, Tray Deee, know what I'm saying?
Kurupt, what's happening?

Check it out

[Benzino]
Oh damn, I almost forgot - I gotta go back home and get my two extra clips
For these niggas that be talking shit
See, I don't think these niggas understand me - I pledge allegience...
To kill their army for no reason

[Antonio Twice Thou]
Yeah, they gon feel this Beretta pop, vendettas never stop
I walked with a Glock, 17 when the weather drops
You want to flex with this next shit?
Bring your best shit, you fucking with machine gun specialists

[Mr. Gzus]
Nigga, to the death of this, no mask, click it and blast
Bout to blow while your powederkeg escelate, defuse it late when I mash
Throw the thing in the stash, proceed to steppin
To make a motherfucker bleed, succeed with whippin

[Daz Dillinger]
And we blast 'em motherfuckers who be snitchin and tippin

[Hook: Tray Deee]
We Made Men
Slayin punk niggas just cavemen
Act up, we spray them
Matching since we came in
All the way to get two G's, see the...
Ray Benzino with Mr. Gzus Clockin' C-Notes
All my niggas throw up they shit, like a G though
Bitches get nothin but dick, and the heave-ho
Pack up while I stack my grit, check the steel-o
Pushin weight state to state, like a kilo
We Made Men, motherfuckers

[Soopafly talking]
Aw yeea, and that's how we do it
Y'all don't want none of this
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, here we go

[Mr. Gzus]
See we on some on sound Dogg Pound Gangsta shit
You on some fucking child pranksta shit
If you can't throw thangs you can't hang - raise the fuck up
You might find yourself stuck up, then fucked up

[Benzino]
It's 2 o'clock, I'm around the corner from this niggas crib
Waitin to kill this bitch for some shit he did
I think I hear this nigga comin down the street with his music bangin
It's time to leave his brains hangin

[Antonio Twice Thou]
Word, how y'all niggas tryin to creep up?
Like we won't let the heat bust, 3 fuss make you eat dust
Platinum Cuban around your throat
A Made Men neck tie - that's all she wrote

[Hook]

[Benzino]
Use your weapon, my lethal left hand.. blows are fatal
I won't betray you, my dog it's time to rearrange you
It's time to ride you, the same niggas who dispise you.. are still breathin
Oh Lord I give you good reason to let my nigga come back to ride one more mission
Like my Soul's given, the situations Hell driven
RSO, murder episode on that 10 starring DPG and the undisputed Made Men!

[Mr. Gzus]
Made Men murdering, brought back veteran
Little black menace, to squeeze on sets again
Slangin and bangin since the age of 10
Bad seed specimen grown into men
Fast cash, fast life livin like that
Plus whip, big gat and on the cage and at the crap that
Undiscript, violent, circle then we run you
A bomb and you wakin and another life is take in

[Antonio Twice Thou]
It's all enough an, stick somethin, spit somethin
Hit somethin, if you see some shit comin.. start gunnin
Fully automatic thunder, shoot me - truth'lly leave 1000 in ya
Have it your way like Burger King, the murder king
Murdering your first string, first to bring the war
Got the 6 saw with tail squeeze it real frequent
Watch ya fuckin mouth when your speakin

[Hook]

[Kurupt]
