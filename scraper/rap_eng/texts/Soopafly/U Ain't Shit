[Daz talking]
Uh, yea
Dat Nigga Daz
Uh, Soopafly on the motherfucking track
Yea, we gon DPG it up, ya knaw what I mean
Shit don't stop, ya knaw what I mean
Yea, check it out

[Daz verse]
Guess who's back, Daz
With a little bit more than the last time
Bringing your ass some more dope rhymes
As I climb from the bottom of the pile
Watch me bubble up, double up, everybody ain't rough enough up
You need some more gangsta in you nigga just toughen up
You see these DPGC's they loving us
I'm Dogg Pound out, and your boy Doggystyled out
Every club I step foot in, nigga I turned out
Ever since I was a youngster, nigga I earn cloud
Learn route, yea I'm pimp-knocking hoes out
Working on a nigga
Just let me bust a nut
Just let me bust them guts
Bitch, that's what's up
For you to keep on tricking it didn't cost much
After she leave you (Ashanti) nigga she call us
We had a ball wit her, she ducked we all hit it, she seesawed wit us

[Bad Azz verse]
Hey y'all, all I'm tryna do is stay ballin
Thick papers in my pockets, credit cards in my wallet
Ben Franklin on my answer machine
Cuz money calling, I'ma call back, I'm aquimilating all that
I stash every single bill here, meetin tall stacks
I'm a mobster, DPG boogie monster
When I die, then my lyrical essence is going haunt ya
'til I die I'm a lyrical legend that's what I brought you
Youse a snitch if you tell 'em what happened, when they caught you
Youse a liar if you switch what happened (Kurupt) in your talkin
You gon die if I get you bitch, so just watch it
6 banana clips, each with 50 rockets
Niggas don't have no hits, niggas got empty pockets
Niggas can't handle this, you bitches just need to watch it
It's a wrap cause nigga you can't rap, so get a strap and jack
Or get a sack and crack

[Daz - Chorus]
Kurupt.. you ain't shit!
Suge Knight you bitch ass nigga.. you ain't shit!
And all your motherfuckers around the world.. you ain't shit!
All the boys and all them lil girls.. you ain't shit!
Ja Rule you sucka ass.. you ain't shit!
You little Bitin ass 2Pac.. you ain't shit!
You tryin to tell me somethin this my nigga.. you ain't shit!
You fuckin wit D-A-Z my nigga.. you ain't shit!

[Daz verse]
It's a new time and a new day, a new way and a new era
A new mind a new 9 I had to cock back and spray
Lay ya down for that title and crown
And that's why we X'ed your bitch ass from the pound (Kurupt, Kurupt)
Switch sides like that, cuz we can't fuck with no niggas like that (sucka)
And that what I call a bitch
I second that emotion he was dropped from the click
Better start your own gang, better watch where you hang
Real G's do real thangs
Hang out of the window blow out your mothafuckin brains
And let you know about this Long beach gang
Motherfucker I'm a Death Row Killa, Suge Knight can die too
Kurupt Dumb Gotti, It's on when we find you
Transformin niggas don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to ride with me (yay yay)
I'm a West coast ridah, comin up besdie you
Bash you nigga to let you know I got the fire
When it comes down to it Diggy Daz is the livest
When it comes down to us gettin bombed I'm the highest
I said it once, no Imma tell your ass
Now gimmie the microphone and lemme give you a blast
I'm Snoop lil cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck us we don't love y'all ass

[Daz - Chorus]
Kurupt.. you ain't shit!
Suge Knight you bitch ass nigga.. you ain't shit!
And All your motherfuckers around the world.. you ain't shit!
All the boys and all them lil girls.. you ain't shit!
Ja Rule you sucka ass.. you ain't shit!
You little Bitin ass 2Pac.. you ain't shit!
You tryin to tell me somethin this my nigga.. you ain't shit!
You fuckin wit D-A-Z my nigga.. you ain't shit!

[Daz talking]
Awwww shit
I wanna say what's up to that pussy-eating Marion
You know you done sucked my dick plenty of times, boy, ya knaw what I mean
Suge like eatin' after people ya knaw what I mean
He like leftovers, ya knaw what I mean
You continue to keep payin my bills you bitch ass nigga
