I never said that you had to offer the world to me
I didn't think that you could, no
I can't recall asking you to promise these things to
Me
I didn't think that you should, no

No one could ever persuade me from comin' around too
Long
Even though it sounds, sounds so good
But good is only as good as {How much you give me
Boy}
But there is not too much that I can see, what
Happened

What happened to the way (We used to be)
You used to love me, baby (Yeah)
I wish down deep to find a way (To bring it back to
Me)
No chance for love (When there's no guarantee)
My mother said we need to wait
I wish that we could find a way (To bring it back to
Me)

You promised me Saturn, Venus and Mars
But all I got was bulls*** and a fallen star (Fallen
Star)
Out of this world (Yeah...), galaxy so far (So far)
Constellation tells me it's not from the heart

Something tells me it's not really (Meant to be you
And me)
Boy, you kill me with those silly (Games you play)
So I prepare myself for the worse, so when it comes
I will surely understand, but please tell me, what
Happened

Promised me)

You promised me Saturn, Venus and Mars

Far)

Promised me, you promised me)

Something tells me it's not really

You, you
