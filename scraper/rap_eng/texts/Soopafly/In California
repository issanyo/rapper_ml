[Tray Deee]
Comin' from the city where no pity is shown shown shown shown

[Lady "V" and Daz]
In California
In Californ-i-a
Rollin' down Crenshaw Boulevard
Starin' at these suckers who claim to be hard
Daz Dillinger and Tha Gang
Who can blast and gangbang, hahaa
In California
In Californ-i-a


[Verse 1: Daz]
Who gives it up and who be rocking all that rough stuff
All in the cut it's young Daz with the pimp strut
Struck game on those who act lame
See, ain't a damn thang changed
You know I ride the neighborhood slow
Floss on you and let the wind blow
True indeed I'm havin' a ball
Pick up the phone and give my homies a call
What's up with y'all? (What's up y'all?)
Livin' in the city where we born to ball
Roll up a Philly, we pack it tight
What a pity, what a sight
Inhaling something all damn night
Got what I need, it got me kinda feelin' so live
Hennessy got a brother so feelin' so high
Peel out and skate, enjoy my day and I love to burn rubber
Pump up the jam for the summer
Gimme your Regal, Snoop got the Hummer
Kinda make you wanna sit back and wonder for the summer

[Chorus: Lady "V"]
(In California, in California)
The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods
(In Californ-i-a, Californ-i-a)
Where you can get got for who they thought you was
(In California, California)
The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods
(In Californ-i-a, Californ-i-a)
Where you can get shot over who they thought you was

[Verse 2: Daz]
Who there? back by a popular demand
Daz Dillinger back in effect, homie, once again
The question is why y'all got a problem with me gettin' live
Say the wrong thing, get fried
Prepare in effect, homie so prepare and beware
Causin' ruckus, all bein' fair
Daz Dillinger finally alone in my zone
Be by myself in a place that I call home
Check it out, peep out the scenery
Ya mean to mean nuthin' to me, ya keep frontin' to me
I hit you up Dogg Pound all come around
Lay 'em all down homies be frontin' for they town
Throw it up, East side, West side bumpin'
California's the state where we be causing ruckus and I love it

[Chorus: Lady "V"]
(In California, in California)
The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods
(In Californ-i-a, Californ-i-a)
Where you can get got for who they thought you was
(In California, California)
The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods
(In Californ-i-a, Californ-i-a)
Where you can get shot over who they thought you was
(The only ill scene to do somethin' for ya
It's a place where everybody wanna see
Once that you visit see all the places
You may never wanna leave)

[Verse 3: Daz]
Here I am stompin' down choppin' down yo compound
Knockin' all y'all out thirty seconds in the first round
Who come around get destroyed off contact
Realize and understand homie you don't want that
Peep me out, let's engage in military action
Women, dope and drama keep me active
Bump all that bullsh- you yappin'
Them beats and that bullsh- you yappin'
I'm about walkin', G walkin' and smackin'
Trippin', actin, you don't really want none of this action
Homie, you better watch out, cause nothin' can save ya
Tattooin' y'all with razors
Mashin' on it getting penetrated him but I grazed him
Now they callin' Daz the usual playa hater
Back on the spot, feelin' live
Watchin' as the cops pass by, feelin' live
Homie I ain't lyin'
Who the man from Long Beach, California to Japan
Rockin' like Run DMC, homie, without a band in hand I rock and control the whole scene
Watch it unfold, get scold, get blown away
Any other rapper pay dearly, severely, y'all come and hear me
Damn, you get bruised, battered and slammed
People tryin' to see who I am, Im Diggy Daz

[Chorus: Lady "V"]
(In California, in California)
The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods
(In Californ-i-a, Californ-i-a)
Where you can get got for who they thought you was
(In California, California)
The home of the city of the Crips and the Bloods
(In Californ-i-a, Californ-i-a)
Where you can get shot over who they thought you was
(The only ill scene to do somethin' for ya
It's a place where everybody wanna see
Once that you visit see all the places
You may never wanna leave)
