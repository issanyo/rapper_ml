[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Me and my homies Loc
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low, I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Me and my homies Loc
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us parted
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snitches
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self-sufficient
So we suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police takin' our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my muthafuckin homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
It's like we kin we known, for getting the party poppin'
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop actin' phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, duckin' bullets
Snatchin' guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world know me
But I ain't shit without my fuckin' homies
Me and my fuckin' homies

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Me and my homies Loc
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[Bridge: Nate Dogg & Nancy Fletcher]
Me and my homies
Constantly we mash
Me and my homies
Gotta make that cash
Me and my homies
There's no need to ask
Me and my homies
We are still the best

[Break: Nate Dogg]
That's my homie
That's my homie, DPGC only
All my homie
That's my homie, DPGC only
That's my homie
That's my homie, DPGC only
All my homie
That's my homie, DPGC only
That's my homie
That's my homie, DPGC only
All my homie
That's my homie, DPGC only
That's my homie
That's my homie, DPGC only
All my homie
That's my homie, DPGC only

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Me and my homies Loc
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday
Me and my homies Loc
You know we kick it like everyday
