[Spoken Word Intro]
It's about that time
Check it out

[Song Intro]
Yeah, bend over
Yeah, yeah, bend over
Yeah, yeah, bend over
Bend over
Just rollin' (C'mon)
Just rollin' (Ayy what you do?)
Just rollin' (Ayy nigga, what you do?)
Just rollin' (What's up Snoop?)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breach through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (But what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this (Sing that shit!)
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Chorus]
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be my little nigga's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze, because I'm just…

[Chorus]
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', 'cause I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I get through, I gotta hit the dope spot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be

[Chorus]
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Outro: 2Pac & (Snoop Dogg)]
Yo, we represent to y'all to the fullest
Y'all know we be representin' for y'all
We bringin' it to another level
Nigga shot me five times
I came outta jail and sold five million
Niggas can't fuck with us
That fat fuck only sold two million
He had half of New York rappin' on that shit
I fucked his bitch and sold five million
That's Death Row style, West side
That's how we do it, you know the playas is on the West side
That peace shit, I ain't even tryna make peace, fuck 'em all
The playas are on this side
That nigga tried to play that gangsta shit but we M-O-B for motherfuckin' real
Fat motherfucker Biggie came into the game, tryna cross a nigga
Then they gonna make a song called "LA, LA"
Them niggas don't know, they gang bang in LA, they love fighting
(Killin' and shootin')
Stupid fucks (Sons of bitches)
That's why we drop it like we drop it
So don't think a nigga be trippin'
We just be tryna represent it for y'all to the fullest
When they say something to us, we wanna make sure we mash they ass
Like we did to Biggie, see that nigga quiet as a fuckin' church mouse
Dropped, hit him up, that nigga quiet as fuck
He ain't got shit to say
His wife pregnant, that nigga waitin' like an expecting father
Not knowing who the baby is (Ha, ha, ha)
The world don't know I use the rubber so it ain't mine
Tell you straight
I didn't wanna fuck that fat bitch no way (Just out of spite)
But you know, that's the secret to war
He my enemy, so she looked a'ight
Then they tried to put my nigga on a case for murder and just lock his ass down forever
Like it was kill-a-nigga season
Snoop freaked they ass though, got out not guilty
We gonna drop his shit in a couple of months
Snoop runnin' for president, he representin' the gangsta out here
So make some noise for Snoop, definitely runnin' for president
(The gangsta party)
