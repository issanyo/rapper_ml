[Intro]
We would like for you to help us welcome
A very distinguished speaker
He hails from the DPG
Would you please stand and welcome the one, the only
OG Nate Dogg

[Verse 1]
Now I was about eight when I caught my first case
My mother she turned her back and bowed her head in disgrace
Now I didn't do a thing
I was just standin' by
Here's a message to the youngsters today
Standin' by - you can die
Usually I'm in the house but today I snuck off
And when I walk down the Long Beach streets
What a lesson they taught
While walkin' to the corner store a big mistake was made
My big homey I was walking with decided he needed to get paid
So he loaded up his .32 and walked right in the store
He said, dear God forgive me please but I can't be broke no more
Now remember, I was just eight
I thought this was a joke
What I'm sayin' I ain't playin'
It was funny 'til that nigga got smoked
Can you guess who that could've been quite easily
But it wasn't so I'm lucky to be standing right here to see

[Hook]
One more day, one more
One more day
One more day, one more
One more day

[Verse 2]
One more day, I'm hangin' around so I can see
Little Nate have a pocket full of money just like his daddy
Everyday I'm sellin big dope, it's all that I know
I ain't workin and I got a baby so don't ask me what for
One more day, gather round everybody and listen to me
I gotta another story about the penitentiary
One more day, see while I was servin cavi I forgot to think
Say for instance they catch me, little Nate'll never see
Now remember I'm sellin' big dope but I'm packin' my thangs
And every corner police watchin'
I ain't crazy so I'm leaving the game
But I guess I waited too late cause they just caught me
Now I'm locked up, every morning I am praying for my son's safety
One more day
I'd like to thank you for watchin over my D-O-double G's
And would you keep an extra eye on Nate Dogg especially
I guess I'll just continue lifting from day to day
And if I live to see tomorrow
Thank you for one more day
