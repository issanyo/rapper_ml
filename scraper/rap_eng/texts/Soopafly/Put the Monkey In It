[Soopafly]
Nigga Daz, Soopafly
Sewin up best friends until we die mash
Cash right thinking oh forever we high
Stepped out the house too cold, G'd up
From feet up to head rockin the blue brim
Sippin on Henny I'm too fly
I'm crackin whatcha gond do smoked all your bud
But love my nigga came through

[Daz]
Here I am Daz diligent on the mission
Comin through like I intend to do
And I slam captured your whole frame of mind
For mind kick your behind when the games on the grind
Yellin

[Soopafly]
Hoe when the part is quick as a dove
And who'll make the beats that bump
We just smash if you ain't got weight
Too small too skinny to rock around many
I got plenty take em all takin many sides
Turn back loose surprise Soopafly right between your eyes

[Daz]
I slap ya down in the middle of the street
For that beat kick the dopest rhymes ever polluted
On the streets not stop check it the way that I dro pit
Check everything in your pocket you can't stop it
Young sucka

Daz & Soopafly(chorus):
Hey yo Daz(what?)
I keep doing what I do
And can't stop what Im doin
Soopafly
I keep giving how Im giving
Gots to stay high gots to keep pimpin
On the one break it down with that dance you do
On the two get funky with it
Now put the monkey with it
I wonda if I can hit it, or let the homie get it
I promise suga once we get started well never quit it

[Daz]
Girl won't you shake it don't fight it don't shake it
Break it down it's your world it's only how you make it
What it is? (What?) It's all about let's see
How the hell we can rock the house I grab the microphone
And niggas cavi start to sing along all day night and all day long
Baby what do you consider fun?
Bout some cali stackin paper multplying huh?

[Soopafly]
I make em great when I rate my state
To make em shake break down your image
Run you like a scrimmage Soopafly still the shh with game
Magnificent got to get on top of the ladder
It don't matter things don't go our way
We gon ratta tatta stomp down your compound
Make your dreams shatter
Observe the way I run through a track but never meet
More Rock than Pete from the block to the street
Make your hood complete let that gangsta shh
Be like beating your ass take the goods and the cash

[Daz]
Now when I dip out for this
When I dip out for that when I see what up
With this to see what up with that
All my homies wanna see where I'm at
I'ma pack the gat in the strap, I can't stop
Quit to be legit and make him worry bout a trick
Trying to get witcha in the rap game
Everyday gang bang check out my homie
Soopafly we do the same thing

[Soopafly]
Now hoe when the party is quick as a dove
And who'll make the beats make the beats that bump
Like Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, you can't do this
Man you don't mean nothing to us you never knew us
You can't see Daz I got my life on it
He put it down for me now I'ma always rhyme for him
We last outclass everybody who ask us
Don't pass the test, now who the best?

Daz & Soopafly(chorus):
Hey yo Daz(what?)
I keep doing what I do
And can't stop what Im doin
Soopafly
I keep giving how Im giving
Gots to stay high gots to keep pimpin
On the one break it down with that dance you do
On the two get funky with it
Now put the monkey with it
I wonda if I can hit it, or let the homie get it
I promise suga once we get started well never quit it

Daz & Soopafly(chorus):
Hey yo Daz(what?)
I keep doing what I do
And can't stop what Im doin
Soopafly
I keep giving how Im giving
Gots to stay high gots to keep pimpin
On the one break it down with that dance you do
On the two get funky with it
Now put the monkey with it
I wonda if I can hit it, or let the homie get it
I promise suga once we get started well never quit it
Daz(outro):
I keep it gangsta (repeat to end)
