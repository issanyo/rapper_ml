[Chorus]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all these multis on you
Your trade list like a shit-show, got leaked by the boatload
Come with the Captain Coco for clowns and all the bozos

My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all these multis on you
Your trade list like a shit-show, got leaked by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm scrolling through my instrus

[VERSE 1]
You stuck in the sellling, I trade that four-five the fifth, ayy
Money in my paypal yeah it came from the list, ayy
Try to trade it all, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that Its been leaked since 2006, ayy
I made my first trade, I'm like, this shit is it," ayy
200 for a multi, that's some overpriced shit, ayy
Had so many intrus gave ugly girl a snip
Out the server of the Discord, we get leaks and bullshit
