[Intro] (Della)
"Hey Sam, this is something you've been requesting along with others being super excited about. So I hope y'all are shook over this"

[Verse 1] (D.R.)
Let me buy like I have actual money
But I know I'll have to ask for it
On the Sunday morning, tea is spilling
Lemme dox some kids on discord

[Pre-Chorus] (Della)
Something in the
Way you look
This feeling won't let me sleep
Cause I'm lost in
The way you talk, the way you stalk

[Chorus] (Della)
One trade it's all it takes
To find out who you are
Possibilities
To find you a doxer

[Post Chorus]
Shook
Wig
We been knew
Tea

[Verse 2] (D.R.)
I just want to make a mix on time
Use the stems, don't even listen
Lashing at the comments when they're vile
Never take my time

[Pre-Chorus] (Della)
Something in the
Way you look
This feeling won't let me sleep
Cause I'm lost in
The way you talk, the way you stalk

[Chorus] (Della)
One trade it's all it takes
To find out who you are
Possibilities
To find you a doxer

[Post Chorus]
Shook
Wig
We been knew
Tea

[Bridge]
Shook
Wig
But that's none of my business
We been knew
Tea

[Chorus] (Della)
One trade it's all it takes
To find out who you are
Possibilities
To find you a doxer

[Post Chorus]
Shook
Wig
We been knew
Tea
