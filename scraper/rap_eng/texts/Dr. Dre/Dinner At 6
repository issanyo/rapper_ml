Dinner at 6 I can no longer wait for your call
I've been waiting for days
What's hard for me to think you've forgotten my number
When we had such a nice chat the other day
Nothing serious has happened
It's been a good weekend
Called my mother 3 times
Streak's finally broken
It's been awhile since I've seen such a lovely face
Will nothing spoil my day
Let nothing spoil my day

I'm afraid to look
Only to find
You could be just like the rest
Give me a sign

You think you've figured me out
I'm a mess you still want to stay
Like fine wine this keeps getting better with time
What's the delay

Well I know this all looks bad, but underneath it all
But your timing couldn't be any better this is my curtain call
Well I know you know my name
That little look you gave, you gave it away
So behave I'll be nice
Mother I don't need to be told twice

6 in the morning and I'm still here
I'm still here
What you read in the paper
Yes I tell you their lies
Stop looking me with those vanishing eyes
The gods have spoken and I'm forced to fib
It was the night of night
So I went out for a little drink
Met up with an old friend, said hello
Goodbye, I gotta go home
Only to find nobody
You're afraid to take a hard look
Let me sell you my story
It's tragic

You think you've figured me out
I'm a mess you still want to stay
Save your tears for later I've got something cooking
Let's not delay

Well I know this all looks bad, but underneath it all
But your timing couldn't be any better this is my curtain call
Well I know you know my name
That little look you gave, you gave it away
So behave I'll be nice
Mother I don't need to be told twice

You better behave
Take a better look at yourself
You better behave
Take a better look at yourself
This is a shame
This is a shame

That I've fallen from grace
That I've fallen from grace
That I've fallen from grace
That I've fallen from grace
That I've fallen from grace
That I've fallen from grace

That I've fallen
That I've fallen
That I've fallen
That I've fallen

Such a shame
Such a shame
Such a shame
Such a shame
Such a shame

How far have you fallen
How far have you fallen
How far... Have you...
