[Verse 1: Hopeless]
My vocal range is 6 octaves high, my stans wish they were me
They wanna know if I use Melodyne, but just wait til’ you see
I was born with talent babe, perfect pitch and everything
Normal soundclouders mix and trade, but I could only sing
You don’t even know what to do with me
I came from your cotton candy dreams, oh

[Hook 1: Kieran S and Hopeless]
I’m more talented than Katy Perry
She sued me but she lip syncs
I’m Hopeless, mashups, baby!
That’s how God made me
Not everyone can sing an A8
Lady Gaga could never
I’m hopeless, mashups, baby!
That’s how God made me

[Verse 2: D.R.]
Say her name three times and prepare your blonde wig
Think of her before you sleep and wake up as a twig
One day her face will be on a million dollar bill
Snatching our weaves every day, well that’s her only skill
You don’t even know, what to do with me
I came from your Ben Array memes

[Hook 2: Kieran S and Hopeless]
I’m more talented than Katy Perry
She sued me but she lip syncs
I’m Hopeless, mashups, baby!
That’s how God made me
Not everyone can sing an A8
Lady Gaga could never
I’m hopeless, mashups, baby!
That’s how God made me

[Verse 3: Crazypadles]
I listen to her songs everywhere I go, I love her so much
I'm her biggest fan, yeah, I stalk her social medias
I wish I had talent but I could only make memes
One day I want to hug her but I'll just have to wait and see

[Bridge: Hopeless]
They say, "How can she be born with it?"
They say, "How can she be so legit?"
They say her producers spend a year autotuning
One song (you wish!)
They say how can she be born with it
They say how can she be so legit
They say her producers spend a year autotuning
Haha, you thought! Th-th-th-thought-
