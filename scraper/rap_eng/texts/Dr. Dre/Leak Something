[Intro]
This is a track
I made
For Ben Array
The King of Filters

[Pre Chorus]
Everyone knows all about my begging
I just DM DR

(He'll go there)

[Chorus]
Everybody please Leak Something, Leak Something
Leak something, then Leak Something
Leak something, then Leak Something

I don't wanna get caught up in the trading of it

No I can't buy it myself
No I can't buy it myself
No, no
Cause I'm broke as fuuuck

No I can't buy it myself
No I can't buy it myself
No, no
Cause I'm broke as fuuuck

[Post-Chorus]
Looking for something I can buy
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't buy

[Verse 2]
Everyone knows
All about my betrayals
With DR
There's Sam Hunt and One Direction

[Post-Chorus: DR & Justin Timberlake]
You and me, tonight...
