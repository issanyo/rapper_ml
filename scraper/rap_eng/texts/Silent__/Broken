[Hook]
I have been broken
Heart has been stolen
Don't know why
I been lost and falling
Happens too often
When will it all end
Don't know why
I can't keep this all in
I have been broken

[Verse]
I've been broken
Heart is so frozen, It's hopeless
Emotions are gone
I need focus
/
Never will I love again
Know they all pretend
I put all my time on the line
You push it aside
Tell me if im lying
/
And my love one of a kind
It is so divine
I'd do anything I can just to keep you mine
Told me everything was fine
You was really lying
Everyday I kept on trying
Then I realized
/
I don't wanna fall in love just to fall apart
I don't wanna put in time just to break a heart
Funny thing is that I told you that right from the start
Now you got me in a trance since you broke it all
And everything about the past brought me feelings of depression
I won't take it as a loss
But I'll treat it as a lesson
And move along
Wore my heart on my sleeve
I was too involved
Where were you at all?

[Hook] (x2)
[INTERLUDE]
Ye
All the feelings I put in to you
I never got any of them back
But it's cool though
$afra, (Alright)

[OUTRO]
Cuz your love, your love, brings me under
Girl your love, your love, keeps me under
