[Click here to read how Who Is Fancy teamed up with Meghan Trainor and Ariana Grande for “Boys Like You”]

[Verse 1: Who Is Fancy]
I'm in the deep end, cannonball jump
Thinking of your love and my heart beats like a drum
Not feeling guilty, cause the water's just right
Oh, it might be wrong, might be the time of your life

[Pre-Chorus: Who Is Fancy]
So jump on in with me
Let me set you free
I'll make you feel like you're dreaming

[Chorus: Who Is Fancy]
Try try try, to follow the rules
I break every one of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what I always do
Yeah I'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor]
It's getting hot out under that summer sun
I'm not playing games, I'm just a girl having fun
I need to cool down, cause I know we're just friends
But one look from you baby then I'm falling back in

[Pre-Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
What's a girl to do?
I got it mad for you
You make me feel like I'm dreaming

[Chorus: Who Is Fancy & Meghan Trainor]
Try try try, to follow the rules
I break every one of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what I always do
Yeah I'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
I get a feeling, looking you in the eye
Know you wanna take a bite of my cherry pie
Get so excited, boy you’re making me blush
Let's just take our time now, there ain't no need to rush, no

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Why don't you make a move?
You got nothing else to lose
Just make me feel like I'm dreaming

[Chorus: Who Is Fancy, Meghan Trainor, Ariana Grande]
Try try try, to follow the rules
I break every one of them with boys like you
My oh my, doing what I always do
Yeah I'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
Boys like you, you, tripping, freaking falling over boys like you

[Outro: Who Is Fancy, Meghan Trainor, Ariana Grande]
I got that something I know you can't resist
I'm gonna make you feel it when I blow you that kiss
