[Hook]
Have you gone trippy trippy? [x3]
Have you gone trippy trippy? [x3]
Say I have gone gone and never come back and never ever come back
Have you gone trippy trippy? [x3]
Have you gone trippy trippy? [x3]

[Verse 1: KiD CuDi]
Feel it in my veins
Feel it in my soul
Feel it in mind
Feel it my heart
Feel it in my soul
Feel it in my space
Feel it in my life
Feel it in my eyes, In my eyes I'm tripping, In my eyes, I'm tripping in my eyes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Hil]
I can't see the sun if it doesn't come through my shades
I don't wanna see no one but myself today
Now I'm just tripping on the love I had yesterday
Time passes by me day by day
I feel it in my bones, Feel it in my lungs
Feel it in my brain, Feel it in a day Feel it a night
Feel it in a day
Never feel the same, I always feel different
Never feel the same
Now I'm just tripping Going on my trippy
Going on my trippy trippy trippy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich Hil]
No I can't get my radio to play no songs
No I can't get my spaceship to fly away
I think I can make it work but today is not my day
So now I think its time for us to fly away
Yeah
I can't see the sun if it doesn't come through my shades
I don't wanna see no one but myself today
I'm just tripping on the love I had yesterday
Time passes by me day by day
