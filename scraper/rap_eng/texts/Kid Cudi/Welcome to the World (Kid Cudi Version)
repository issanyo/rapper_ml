[Intro]
Welcome to the world, welcome to the world

[Verse 1]
You got your popstar, I'll be your rockstar
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast, predictions won't stop
You'll get your fifteen, and then they take the spot

[Pre-Hook]
(Let's go, let's go) And then you're ready to go
(Let's go, let's go) Cause it's the end of the show
(Let's go, let's go) So just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

[Hook]
All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Ok, hello, welcome to the world

[Verse 2]
She saw the bright lights, she caught the fever
She got contagious, she never leave it
So no more time spent, and no more free shit
In fact this free ride has reached its destination

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Oh no, y'all see I am the double O representer
Baby girl have you ever seen heaven at night?
Or felt Summer in the Winter
See now I can give you the new this, go get it or get gone
Most other niggas spit wrong, poof poof, be gone, so long, dream on
I am keeping it no more, you can live how you wanna
In fact you need a man you can name if you wanna
You gave me the ass, I would whip it when I wanna
Now you wanna talk down and clown, you can't phase a nigga
I told you I really want it to better for me and you wouldn't let me picture
But you shouldn't have tried to play me, now I bet you hate me
Told you girl let's go and you act like you ain't hearing me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
