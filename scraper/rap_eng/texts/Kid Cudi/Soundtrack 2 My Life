[Verse 1: Hiatus]
I got ninety-nine problems, and they're all women
Too emotional, and I'm trying to fix it
But hold up, maybe that's not broken to begin with
Maybe I just gotta learn to control them feelings
I'm not just talking love, I'm talking anger too
I'm talking vengeful, and copping attitude
I'm talking about it ain't right what I put them through
Irregular heartbeat is the rhythm that I play them to
Now back to myself, I like to play the victim
Confusing chicks, man am I that sadistic
My rough surface be the sandpaper causing all the friction
Maybe it's a rush, a high, maybe it's my addiction
Sociable sociopath, the blessing and the curse
The callused soul accustomed to hurt
In order to reciprocate love, you gotta feel it first
And it's gonna take more than love to make love work

[Hook: Hiatus & Kid Cudi]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 2: Hiatus]
I started from the bottom, not talking Drake though
I'm talking hunger pains while he was on a TV show
I was hearing stories bout people making dough
With Hip-Hop, and I knew that I could flow
So I decided it was time to get serious
I said keep your soul, never give in to the pyramid
Scheme, never allow it to become a pipe dream, steady building with
The talent God gave me 'til everybody feels the kid
Reaching a new mountain top, because the way I rock a beat
Now I work with people I never even thought I'd meet
Kinda awestruck, kinda shell shocked
Meeting fellow warriors, all the while friends lost
Hear it in my voice, know the wars I've fought
Know in my heart it's my time like Flava's clock
Thanks a lot, thanks to you, I can feel the hunger
No games, this a storm, can't you hear the thunder

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hiatus]
The soundtrack to my life, sound like a sad song right
Feeling like Annie and HOV with a hard knock life
The way I'm spitting on a beat, every verse sound like a title fight
Demons in my mind, so I never get to sleep at night
Role reversal, Like I take joy in pain
Lost my girl and my sister in the same day
How Ironic, the instant it happened it began to rain
Nothing I could do except for be ashamed
This was not the plan, I'm fighting Destiny
Smooth-talking fate, persuading her to set me free
Hand drew a picture, maybe that could make you see
The kind of monster that you're making me
See the kinds of things that I see on a day-to-day
Lucid dreams, longing just to run away
Once you think there's nothing left for me to say
It's on to the next song, let my soundtrack play

[Hook]
