[Verse 1: Santogold]
Go ahead, you know you want it
You'll have no other way
You just want to take us down
Go ahead
I'll be the one hit
If I can take you, boy, it just might throw this town
Oh, you want to get it
You make us bleed, it'll prove there's life somewhere
And oh, no, I want to yell it
But do we speak or are we just nodding our heads?

[Hook]
No way, not me, what you got
It's not for me, but you'll find a way
No way not me, what you got
It's not for me
Don't reach too far
You will fall over
Don't be surprised what you discover
Don't fear your call
Can't pull us under
You better watch out, run for cover

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Catch a breath, the beat pump hard
Understand my mind, I'ma let down my guards
Place a nigga soul, open your arms
Intergalact attack is mixed with the charm
I let you lead the way
I be sure [?] all night and day
Kid Cudi lovin', all day and night
You get left girl if your mind ain't right

[Outro]
