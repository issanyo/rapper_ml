I need yall to know I got so many haters within the industry and these clowns know Im bout to crush their entire existance. Everyone thinks they're soooo great. Talkin top 5 and be having 30 people write songs for them. Let me tell you something. The days of the fuckery are over. The fake ones wont be lasting too much longer.

Im the one they worry about cause they know I dont give a fuck about the corny shit they do. All my youngins out here reppin, Asap Rocky and the whole ASAP family, Travis Scott, SuperDuper Kyle, Audio Push, Hit Boy, etc, I see yall. And all u jealous chicken hearted shits I see you too.

I am the culture.

I keep silent because I dont ever wanna come off like some angry hater, but today, not only do I feel fantastic, Im feelin like taking over. I already have.

My tweets apply to who they apply. Ye, Drake, whoever. These niggas dont give a fuck about me. And they aint fuckin with me. Niggas keep you close when they see how powerful you are by yourself. When they see your greatness. Out of fear

Ive been loyal to those who haven't been to me and that ends now. Now im your threat.

Anybody got a issue with my words im glad. If you feel me, dont be scared to use your voice. I was for so long out of blind loyalty.

From here Ill let the music speak. As you were, peace and love to my supporters and true ones.  ü§òüèæüåπ‚ù§Ô∏è
