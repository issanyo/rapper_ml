This is the song for me, call it my biography
This is the song for me, just let me be
It's what I am, yea it's what I am
Just let me go, please just let me go
Just let me flow, Jerz just let me flow

[Verse 1]
When I was kid I wanted to run the play ground
Show them it was my town and if not you'd be chased around
When I was kid I was a social butterfly
My parents always asked me why I'd shrug my shoulders living life
My parents split up that had my feelings mixed up
Always wanting to ask mommy why daddy still don't live with us
Then times got harder that's when I moved with my father
Always been close with my mom now it seems we finna be farther
I packed my bags moving to a new place
Got me driving cross the country to put on a new face
That's when I learned and discover new ways
To better myself and change to become a stronger Zay]

This is the song for me, call it my biography
This is the song for me, just let me be
It's what I am, yea it's what I am
Just let me go, please just let me go
Just let me flow, Jerz just let me flow

[Verse 2]
[Being the new kid it was scary trying to make new friends it was daring
All of this stress on a little one it was over bearing
Because now it wasn't about sharing it was more about comparing
And being vulnerable at that age so you could bet it was impairing
I was so caught up in appearance it was causing interference
In who I was and I didn't want to be incoherent
Only in 8th grade but I'm searing I'm a bad driver so I'm veering
Off this bad road and to another one that's more appealing
Temps with the fan got hotter relationships were searing
Everything was unappealing then things blew up no more ceilings
In my stomach i had this weird sinking feeling
I was in Lynden hooks its reeling now it's Lynden where I'm healing]

This is the song for me, call it my biography
This is the song for me, just let me be
It's what I am, yea it's what I am
Just let me go, please just let me go
Just let me flow, Jerz just let me flow

[Verse 3]
[Nowadays I'm the nerdy black kid in Lynden
Comfortable with who I am so I don't have to try and fit in
Kid Cudi, Urkel, and Wiz's image I am spittin
And on this mio flavored water you can catch me sippin
Around here all we have is backstabbing drama
So many really tight cliques it's causing outsiders drama
Everyone is secretly racist so they hate Obama
Parents are like their kids they dabble in marijuana
All I'm really doing is telling you who I am
You say that you don't like please you're a closet fan think I have a cookie Flow like green eggs and ham
And damn I'm kinda hungry]
