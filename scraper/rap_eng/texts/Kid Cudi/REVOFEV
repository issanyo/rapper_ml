[Intro]
Yeah, welcome, welcome you, hey
I am your big brother
What do I have to say to the kids?

[Verse 1]
Let go, life does get tough
No need to stress, hold you back too much
Let's go, I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the Revolution?

[Interlude]
What do I have to say to the kids?

[Verse 2]
Wake up, things might get rough
No need to stress, keeps you down too much
Wake up, I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the Revolution?

[Bridge]
I'm so high up, so high up and I like it, hey
I'm so high up, so high up and I like it, hey
I am happy today, this not like other days
Somehow I feel okay, somehow I feel okay

[Interlude]
I am your big brother, I am your big brother

[Verse 3]
Let go, life does get tough
No need to stress, hold you back too much
Let's go, I heard they found a solution
Where will you be for the Revolution?

[Outro]
Ok, Ok
We are
You are here
Where will you be for the Revolution?
Where will you be for the Revolution?
Where will you be for the Revolution?
