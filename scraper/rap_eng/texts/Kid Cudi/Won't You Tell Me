Won't you tell me
What you need from me
Won't you tell me
What you want from me

[Rich Hil]
Tell me what is going on
Tell me where my mind has gone
Tell me why my mom ain't home
Keep calling my momma's phone
She keeps sending me the message tone (tone, tone)
Tell me what I did was wrong
I don't think I did you wrong
Tell me what you see in me
I'mma be gone but I can't stay long
I'mma stay on like I can stay on
I'mma put on like I can put on
Don't say that our love is gone
You know that our love is strong
All I really want is peace and love
All I really need is love and peace
Tell my baby "love me. please"
Why she wanna get out of me
What these bitches see in me (me, me)

[Hook] [KiD CuDi]

And I'm alone
Now the past is stressing me
Now girls just stand next to me
And feed off of my energy
Tell me why you leaving me
Tell me what you expect from me
Wait 'till there's nothing left of me
Now you see I'm ecstacy
See life is gold
Love is pearl
Everything else just hurts (it hurts)
Now I'm in dimension (dimension)
Drugs are my intention (intention)
