[Verse 1]
Day 'n' nite...
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace and see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play...play..
Now look at this...
Madness to magnets keeps attractin me, me
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first, but surely finish last...last...

[Hook]
Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite

[Verse 2]
Hold the phone, the lonely stoner Mr. solo dolo
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep, a silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Hook]
Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite

[Verse 3]
Slow mo, when the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive, though he is feelin blue
The sun is shinnin man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...

[Hook]
Day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite

Day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite
At nite...

Free his mind at nite
