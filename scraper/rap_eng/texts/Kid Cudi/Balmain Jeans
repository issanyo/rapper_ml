[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Help me take off my Balmain jeans, I’ll undo yours
You can lick it after I’m done licking you first
I wanna taste it, tired of waiting, are you tasty?
Yahm yahm, come on baby, yahm
Hope you can feel that vibe, the vibes of the night
Your body is warm in my arms, we're under the stars
Can I come inside your vortex?
Can I come inside your vortex, let me baby

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
It’s been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body
I need you to protect my heart
Gimme your hand, put it here
This is where you start
Keep feelin’ on me, don't stop

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Lord help me, lord help me
I got a lover under my covers, I don’t want her to leave
She says I'm perfect, perfectly kissing on my neck
She is the sexiest, she said she loves my scent
Hope you can feel that vibe, the vibes in the night
Her body is warm in my arms, we're under the stars
I wanna taste it, tired of waiting, are you tasty?
Yahm yahm, come on baby, yahm

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
It’s been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body
I need you to protect my heart
Gimme your hand, put it here
This is where you start
Keep feelin’ on me, don't stop

[Verse 3: Raphael Saadiq]
Zoom with me baby, yeah

Oh girl you’re so sweet to me
I love it when you’re zoomin'
Oh girl you’re so sweet to me
I love it when we're zoomin'
Oh girl you’re so sweet to me
I love it when you’re zoomin'
Oh girl you’re so sweet to me

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
It’s been so long, been such a hobby
Finding someone who electrifies my body

Gimme your hand, put it here
This is where you start
Keep feelin’ on me, don't stop
