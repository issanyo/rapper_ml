Kid Cudi
She wanna have whatever she like
She can if she bring her friend
& we can have one hell of a night
Through the day
Eh, I mean starin' like a creeper 'cause you gotta peep 'her
I mean you probably might be sayin' you ain't jockin' either
But man, ol' girl got a bad old ass
Yeah, the type that make you tell a bitch just dance
& fuck them other niggas 'cause you down for her bitches
Fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for the stickin'
& fuck them other niggas hope she down for some lickin'
& fuck them other bitches
'Cause she's down for the trickin' up
I'm hopin' she a rider
When it's said & done
& she spit it up & swallow now
I ain't got a trip about them niggas who like her
But me & mommy know who can really make her go...

She said she want whatever she like
She said she gon' bring her friend
Now we gon' have a hell of a night
Through the day
I Made Her Say
Hold up, born in '88
How old is that? Old enough
I got seniority with the sorority
So that explain why I love college
Gettin' brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your Medulla Oblongata
& give me scoliosis until I comatoses
& do it while I sleep yeah a little osmosis
& that’s my commandment you ain’t gotta ask Moses
More champagne more toastes
More damn planes, more coastes
& fuck a bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa, Osa …

(Oh, oh oh oh)

I Make Her Say

Common
She said she want whatever she like
But she gotta bring your friend
& We could have 1 hell of a night, through the day
She blamed it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
A pokerface book I already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the south lookin' for a payday
Said bitch you should do it for the love like Ray Jay
But they say you be on that conscious tip
Get your hair right & get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the Gali to the party
It's the way I was raised on the south side safari, so...

(Oh, oh oh oh)
