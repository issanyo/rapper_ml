Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me)
How you stopped needing me (needing me)
When she came along (along, along)
Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day)
Just up and walked away (walked away)
When she came along

Hey, uh, uh, oh baby, baby
I was upset and you know you shady
Blame it on me like I'm fugazi
I put in work and then you got lazy
Now you sayin' it's shame on me
You left with a chick with a set of double D's
Why should we separate like Siamese?
Didn't anybody tell you sex better in threes?
I can be the reason that you both knock knees
If I tell my homie Zulee, he wouldn't knock me
Try to tell me lies, but you're so sloppy
When you leave with your friends, they all jock me
I understand if she know how to please you
I understand if she lovin' and tease you
In my right mind, I should probably leave you
Why can't all three of us be peoples?

Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me)

Yo, please listen
Uh, uh, don't dip out, baby
I can live life fine with two ladies
Two heads are better than the one God gave me
And I'm messed up, been stressin' lately
Please tell me, know you gotta feel how I feel
Imagine us lounging together
And I feel you, while you feel her, and she feel me
Love triangle, love in all angles
If you spend more time, I won't trip or spazz out
'Long as when we home, we freak out
And let your friends know exactly what we 'bout
More heavy fam, we living our dreams out
Sexy, I know you probably think you can be stress-free
Without K.I.D., but you gon' see if you ever left, never get it better
You'll miss me

Ohh baby, ohh baby, just talk to me, just tell me let's work it out
Hey baby, I need you baby
(Both of y'all)
Baby, I need you, baby
(Both of y'all)
I need you, baby

Take my hand, baby girl, let's roll
I can make you feel okay
Just take my hand, both of you, I can make you feel okay
Okay
Let's work it out
