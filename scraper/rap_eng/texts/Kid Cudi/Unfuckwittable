[Intro]
You could fly
Nobody can touch youâ€¦ Nobody
You could fly
Nobody can touch you

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question, ain't no conspiracy
Keep on searching for love, who else is incomplete?
There's so many good vibes just floatin' around in the world
And when the ground and sky combine, oh yeah
I'm feeling more than fine
I'm so Rock and Rollie

[Hook]
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel It?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable?
Don't you feel it?
You know that I'm unfuckwittable?

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
One day I knew no one could help me in Hell
Not many people are true, fake as the lies they tell
The world is filled with good vibes, and that is what I seek
And now I'm feeling more than cool, oh yeah
I'm feeling more than cool
Them Jokers can't hold me

[Hook]
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel It?
You know that I'm unfuckwittable?
Don't you feel it?
You know that I'm unfuckwittable?

[Hook]
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel It?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable?
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable?
