The last time we talked
Alright. Turn it up a little. Turn it up
Yo Cudi, you wanna get it on this?
Yes whatever man

[Asher Roth]
I think I got something special for you two
Let me introduce you
Cause Cudi and I we go all over the place
We, We cross over
We walked in on some foreign talk
So my shit is like this when people walk in

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
We do this, we do that, we do rock, we do rap
We do jazz, we do funk and classical
With a clash to Outkast, back to Johney Cash
?? and Black Dawn and ??? called west
Less from promise, Mos Def, and quay lee
Zep Lin, eye nix, Beck and Chuck D
Feeling of Bob Dylan, hints of Jon Lenon
Mixed with a bead of Pepsi and bumbi
Marli and my heart and parts of Charlie Parker
Mozart's art and all of Sean Carter
Bjork to Thom Yorke, Europe to New York
Morsen of the door, morsell too short
Short the List is long and just goes on ya'll
Me and Cudi we unstoppable

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I'll be the freshman, next tin
Kicking off the dirt I'll be blessed and
When you come arrest him
We be out eminets
I don't give a fuck what Bill Bond's man is spitting
I'm a legend, niggas they know they well wishing
Kid Cudi fall off
Never bossy, I'm getting money
Bounce all around the world selim to Bunny
Wrap it, You want my dick come grab it
I will break skull motherfucker
Kid Cudi's in the mall popping tags and I'm talking him
Everytime the trying to play the game all the model girls claim they running round town and they fucking him
No, they ain't fucking with him, no, not on that level
Another love this hoes, cause I'm nigga got several
I'm not trying to be caught up like I'm in this movie that you know

No Nigga I'm just trying to sit back is on my cush
You already know what you know is coss
Wishing to be nigga, my nigga Asher Roth
We the motherfucking possy as the boss
What you know about that, boy I let the
Let these motherfuckers

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
Yeah
And this is it, down to this, to the nitty gritty
My fingernails is dirty as any
But anyway, we slice it is going get some
Finding some show frenzy
I'm trying but no one lets me
I'm tired so don't upset me
Cause I'm Trying to fight with both arms tied behind me
With a blindfold on
Throwing shots at my body
But I, continue on like I carry the cross
Strove past the crossroads till the Land of the loss
And um, Skip right up the satan
Throw some pennies at his feet
Say I give him my soul but I sold it to the industry
So, not up to me, attached a couple of strings
And before this made
I'm in Different directions
There's nothing but raps in
Records execs and
You and the next man, go get your investment
Cause, now more than ever I'm hot with hostility
It's now or never and never's never a possibility

[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]
If you listen to Day 'n Night in reverse You probably think I'm suicidal
With a knife in the bible
I don't give a fuck why niggas sit in the back are so idle
I'm the nigga, I'm you're father, get in your room and study
I'm the nigga in the back you can call me your buddy
Cause I'm rolling up the weeds, we can smoking next plenty
Hey, so talk records homie
We do it bigger than you ever could imagine
I'm something like Big Pun and Biggi Smalls combined but unhappy
I let these niggas know I dry heave when I spit the heat
Motherfuckers better bundle up big tight
I'll be in the club all day till the midnight
You can get a spit right
Yeah, I'm trying to let these motherfos something wrong in here
There's something wrong with my brain, I'm not the same as everyone else
Niggas know the flow is the best in the elf and stilf
Metal and you're silent
Move and I'm running in the game can't stop him
Asthma, Nigga Asher Roth, and Hamilton
We trying to put the game over every gonna win
The losing the game and we choosing
We up and playing beer pong all day we boozin
We choosing the and night hoes
We trying to get it popping after every show
