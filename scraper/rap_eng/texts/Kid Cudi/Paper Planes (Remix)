[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I'm super duper Cudi and the one and only Cudi
Them hoes they be popping but they getting nothing from me
They see me in the 'lac with my boy Plain Pat
We got a couple model girls lounging in the back (hey, hey)

Never gave a fuck about a hater or a groupie
In the double O, your boy touch down
My door's swinging open, a nigga must clown
Hey you sucka nigga you ain't got to screw face me
Even if I die, no nigga could replace me
Mind on the level- no other nigga could touch
And it's all fuckin natural now cause of the weed of dutch (ay)
And we get back, sip that gin
Pour another glass, gettin' it in
All my niggas in the front, my people in the back
Show me love dog, tell me where you at
