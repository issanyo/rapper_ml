[Intro]
(yawn)
Shit...
Man...
Dream on, dream on
Hey

[Verse 1]
These voices they tell me go
Why should I ever go
Man I'm so comfortable here
Why should I head to a place where people live in fear
Standoff-ish to really hear
Somethin' they can really feel
But see I'll never get
Why the earth is a puzzle that I'll never fit
I'm not of their world, so why should I leave my sanctuary
Man, the whole thought of that is scary
How do I know that their kind will truly hear me out
Will they understand I'm flyin' from a different route
Posed as a human being, mother moon tells me that people need my help
I guess these other cards she threw out and dealt

[Bridge]
She said I gotta do it alone
She said I gotta do it alone
I guess I gotta go

[Hook]
You gotta do it alone mane
You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone mane
Go on your own
It's bigger than you mane
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than you mane

[Verse 2]
She said to pack my bags dog and never look back
This is something that I have to do
A hero to save the world
A hero with no girl or no family just sacrifice as a friend
And struggle is the enemy
But weed is the remedy
And if you get lonely boy you can just roll up a dutch and
Keep your head high
You wanna see home look at the sky
Remember you're not strange
But you are not the same mane

[Hook]
You gotta do it alone mane
You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone mane
Go on your own
Its bigger than you mane
Its bigger than you
Its bigger than you mane
