[Intro]
Why, why, why, why
Yeah, why, why
Yeah, why, why

[Verse 1]
No doubt about it I'm melting, ooh melting
World full of wonder if you open those eyes
Shed yourself, get out the disguise
Slow mo we all want acceptance
Truth, fuck that, get off that
Accept truth, be free, and carry on baby
Hey

[Verse 2]
No doubt about it I'm crumbling, ooh crumbling
No issue I got it, X-Ray through the lies
To enter the void got to lose more of your mind
It happens the same old downward spiral
And I weep, to sleep, give it all I've got in the morning
So good night my baby
Instant pain, hey
