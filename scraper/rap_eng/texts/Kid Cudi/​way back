[Part I]

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Woah, yeah boy
Woah, yeah boy
Woah, yeah boy
Don't wet no more

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I need fake niggas to get way back
James Harden with the range on me nigga way back
Homie start switchin' lanes, I thought we went way back

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott & Swizz Beatz]
(Wooo)
I can't get no rest (We in the house)
I fall asleep with a Tec (Rack)
Stashin' all the pills in my desk (Rack)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (We in the house) (Come on)
I can't get no rest (Come on)
I ride around with a Tec (Champ)
Stashin' all the pills in my desk (Champ)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (Go crazy on 'em)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Woah, wait
It's summer time, why they tryna throw shade?
All these wins I can never golden state (Yeah!)
UFC I'm tapping to my old ways (Alright!)
I'm addressing shit like I'm on Waze
Showed ya love, ain't show it back in OK
Like the girl, that she go both ways
Dropped the Rodeo, I dodged a bull like ol√©
Hopped in the Bronco, skrrt off like OJ (Yeah!)
Flew with that sound, nigga, got that Coldplay
I be (Yeah!) makin' mils, made it to a hobby (It's lit!)
Don't bring that to the crib, keep that in the lobby
You never seen the city unless you land at Hobby
I'm so loaded off the pills, so don't ever try me
So if you see me solo dolo, you know what that mean

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I need fake niggas to get way back (Way back)
James Harden with the range on me nigga way back
Homie start switchin' lanes, I thought we went way back

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott & Swizz Beatz]
Whew
I can't get no rest (We in the house)
I fall asleep with a Tec (Rack)
If I take a sip, take the rest (Rack)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (We in the house)
I can't get no rest (Come on)
I ride around with a Tec (Champ)
Stashin' all the pills in my desk (Champ)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (Go crazy on 'em)
(We in the house)

[Part II]

[Segue: Travis Scott]
Look boy, boy don't believe what's on your TV
Look boy, don't you sit close to the TV
Look boy, seeing is believing
Look boy, look boy (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Would it be unlawful (Yeah!)
To spend this honeymoon in a brothel?
And share pics from the camera
But they'll be quick to turn that into a scandal
I'm down in the Meadows
Slidin' down the Waterfall, creep to the ghetto
Need my Rio de Janeiro
And I'm swimmin' out that bitch
Michael Phelps with the medals
So visit me (Yeah!)
I just built a castle deep (Yah, yah)
In them trees (Yeah!)
That's how I get them backwoods free (Yah, yah)
This right here some savagery (Yah, yah)
Bend it back from me (Yah, yah)
Way, way back for me (Yah, yah)
Way, way back for me
Way, way back for me
Way, way back for me

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Woah-ohhh-ohhhh-woah
