[Hook: Kid Cudi]
These dreams, struggles
Riches and sins
Make me wonder, wonder
Who I am
These dreams, struggles
Riches and sins
Make me wonder, wonder
Who I am

[Verse 1: Stevie McFly]
Twenty-three years old, but I'm still childish like Gambino
Got to get to Vegas ASAP and eat clams in a casino
This emo negro's ego be more grande than the Rio
Some say hero, some say zero, burnin' niggas, call me Nero
And you Romans can't step to this
Spitting fire on the track, nigga, sweat to this
I am the best there is. Yeah, nigga, I am the best there is
If you're looking for Jesus, you got the wrong song
Cause I've been called a sinner more than Daughters Spelled Wrong, nigga
I'll take the bottle, you can keep the fucking bong
And I be pissing on you niggas like my name was Emotron, nigga
Members Only on the track, nigga
Don't think you can fuck with that, nigga
Son of Sam
Motherfucking murderer, that's who I am

[Hook]
These dreams, struggles
Riches and sins
Make me wonder, wonder
Who I am
These dreams, struggles
Riches and sins
Make me wonder, wonder
Who I am

[Verse 2: Stevie McFly]
Haters starting to realize I'm a problem
But it's like Weezy said, "What's a goon to a goblin?"
These little kids just acting like they're Robin
Always right behind me like they following my blog, son
These niggas desperate to get to me
But I just fly over them; pilot, synecdoche
Because I'm so much better than their motherfucking best could be
My niggas is beside me, and all these girls is next to me
I party hard, but nigga, don't get it twisted
I'm young, black, and gifted even when I get lifted
Sinning and grinning while I'm winning
But don't call me Charlie Sheen; I never beat women
Some niggas call me feminazi
But they can kiss my ass in a flash; paparazzi
These niggas tripping but they better understand
That they never in a million years changing who I am, nigga
