[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Hands up, we back in, born in the rage
Untamed, break free, beast out of the cage
Sky rainin' down flames, it's a war on the heavens
A beautiful scene in the night behind light
And much like that, when I'm dreamin', I'm in flight
Coast out of site, though I'm feelin' I'm not right
And Hell's got one hell of a grip, no shit
Your boy best not slip, get stuck in your grave
Just to live another day, fightin' through decay
Call on my angels and I kneel as I pray
Got my mind, my soul and my heart on the same wave
It took me a minute, now I'm all in it, damn
While I'm out of the dark, I push it to the limit, friend
So ready, I'm sharp, here comes the demolition man
Pack 'em up and just hittin', aimin' and never missin'
Servin' up the prescription, no time for intermission
Rippin'

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Findin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Fight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me

[Chorus: Billy Corgan & Kid Cudi]
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oh, no
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Nooooooo, oh
Then someone will say, what is lost can never be saved
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, yo
Yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
The world's got hope in the city with a reward
Made for the pain, it's a battle I'm runnin' toward
Call to the don, I'm embracin' it to the core
Forced into fightin', get ready for many more
And I'm for mine from the jump, I ride or die with the pump
I'm squeezin' for that release, I aim and let it dump
I hear a roar of a sound, I'm feelin' it through the ground
Mayhem in the city, escapin' but I am found
I rise up amongst the many with no fear
Full squad, we at it, we finish 'em all, clear
Through the rubble, we rumble, never runnin' from trouble
Keep my head on a swivel, you know I'm scorin' for double
Searchin' for that release, swimmin' at it, repeat
Wash your hands of them sins and fightin' 'til we see peace
It's the least we could do in a world that needs the brave
Know the lost can be saved, survivin' the end of days

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Findin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Fight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me

[Chorus: Billy Corgan & Kid Cudi]
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oh, no
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Nooooooo, oh
Then someone will say, what is lost can never be saved
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh
