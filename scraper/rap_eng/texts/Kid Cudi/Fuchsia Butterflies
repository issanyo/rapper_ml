[Intro]
Yeah, da-dum-dum-da-dum
Dum-dum-da-dum-dum

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm feeling I'm a goner, I'm feeling I'm a goner
I'm feeling I'm a goner and I don't know where I am
I'm feeling I'm a goner, I'm feeling I'm a goner
I'm feeling I'm a goner, na-na-na-na
And I got my bed made, so long, sweet dreams (Sweet dreams)
Fuchsia butterflies dizzy, now what am I?
Climb in the shadows, honey, I'm home (I'm home)
It's all by design if I pass out on the lawn

[Chorus]
Then I'll be happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic luxury
Happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic company

[Verse 2]
I got my mind gone, but I love you and you know
Fumble and mess things up, I can be such an asshole
I said I'm sorry, my lady, I'm so sorry (so sorry, yeah)
Keep doing the right thing, you just stay, stay away

[Chorus]
And I'll be happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic luxury
Happy, happy getting shitfaced by myself
Just loathing in my sweet misery
Oh, such manic company
Such manic company

[Outro]
I got my daddy's gun, oh
Such manic company
I got my daddy's gun, oh
