[Verse 1]
How would you feel if you heard the news that I was dead?
What would you do if you found out from your friends that I was dead?
Would you cycle through your mind think of all the things you should've said
Or coulda did differently.. if I was dead?

[Hook]
I'm just tryna say life is too short
Though I make mistakes, baby I'm tryna make it right
All I'm tryina say is life is too short
All we've got is love - baby and the time to make it right

If I'm alive that is.. If I'm alive that is
Do you think of me at all? Would you think of me at all?

[Verse 2]
Who would you talk to? Who would be your friend if I was dead?
Who would you run to? Who would kiss your face if I was dead?
Would you cycle through your mind, think of all the things, the good and bad
Seeing things differently.. if I was dead?

[Hook]
I'm just tryna say life is too short
Though I make mistakes, baby I'm tryna make it right
All I'm tryna say is life is too short
All we've got is love - baby and the time to make it right

If I'm alive that is.. If I'm alive that is
Do you think of me at all? Would you think of me at all?

[Outro]
Goodbye
