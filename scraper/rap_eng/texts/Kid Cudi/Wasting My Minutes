[Hook]
I talk to my baby on a telephone long distance
I never would've guessed I could miss someone so bad, yeah
I really only met her bout a week ago
But, it doesn't seem to matter to my heart I know
That I love her
I'm hoping that I never recover
Cause she's good

[Verse 1:KiD CuDi]
She's so cool, shes so hot
But a scholar she's not
Word, she pretty, pretty but she's dumb as a rock
But honestly see she's all that I got, and what not
She very genuine and very feminine
But when we on the phone I think her brain is sleepin in
I try and tell her friends but they as dumb as her
Birds of a feather I guess, but see that makes it worst
I hit her up to say whattup she said "the sky"
I say what's good she said "mcdonald's apple pie"
I try to justify it but she ain't get the lingo
But then I peep she ain't sleep I date a bimbo
Why oh why
Why must she be so damn fly
Then turn around and be so dumb
Where the fuck this broad come from?
See I don't understand
How it happened man
How did this occur the whole realtionship is blur
I even need to quit smokin my weed
Or make surely she got a GED

[Hook: Kid Cudi and 88keys]
(Only met about a week ago, but a little bit busy on the telephone)
She's so fine, see we talk all the time
But sometimes I think she's missin her mind
(We only met about a week ago, but a little bit busy on the telephone)
She's a dime, and she's faithfully mine
But something wrong with her head cause she ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
(We only met about a week ago, but a little bit busy on the telephone)
She's so fine, see we talk all the time

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
You know I called her
And I was just like, damn like she sounded so dumb as hell
Like she ain't got no fuckin brain, you know what I mean?
And I'm just like, your wasting my minutes and shit!
