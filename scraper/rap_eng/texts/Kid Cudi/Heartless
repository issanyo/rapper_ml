In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless

How could you be so heartless? Oh
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talking to me, though
You need to watch the way you talking to me, yeah

So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well, I got homies
In the end it's still so lonely

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless

How could you be so heartless?
Yeah, how could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
I know you can't believe

I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless

How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
