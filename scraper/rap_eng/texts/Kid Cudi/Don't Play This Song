[Intro]
Hey, let's have some fun this time

[Hook : Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right-right-right
Tryin to get my mind, my mind, my mind right right
People think they really being helpful
By tellin me to please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, r-right-right-right
Please please don't play this song

[Verse 1]
Pain, hurt, sadness and loneliness
Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how a teach had a son
That never gave a fuck about a Scantron
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide

[Hook : Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right-right-right
Tryin to get my mind, my mind, my mind right right
People think they really being helpful
By tellin me to please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, r-right-right-right
Please please don't play this song

[Verse 2]
Black Robin Hood
Riding high just like we should
You know the saying, ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the getting while the getting's good
Yeah demented, my brain was forced to transform
Wise up, I'm checking the gate
On humble tales and minimum wage
The blogs tell it – Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt, he must be gay
Let's keep it trill, fuck being discreet
But some girls tweet how they miss my meat
Yeah, Cudders – HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit, you can blame my ma
I'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it
I'm lockin' in my rocketship
I'll be a blip on your radar bitch
Feels like things can be covered
Until the day I'm above myself hovered

[Hook: Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right-right-right
Tryin to get my mind, my mind, my mind right right
People think they really being helpful
By tellin me to please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, r-right-right-right
Please please don't play this song
