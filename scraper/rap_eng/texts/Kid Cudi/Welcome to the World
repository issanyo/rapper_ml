(Welcome to the world, welcome to the world)
You got your pop star, I'll be your rock star
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast, predictions won't stop
You get your fifteen, and then they take the spot
Lets go, lets go and then you're ready to go
Lets go lets go 'cause it's the end of the show
Lets go lets go so just get ready to go
Lets go lets go, lets go lets go

[Chorus]
All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Okay, hello, welcome to the world
She saw the bright lights, she caught the fever
She got contagious, she never leave it
So no more time spent and no more free shit
In fact this free ride has reached its destination
Lets go, lets go and then you're ready to go
Lets go lets go 'cause it's the end of the show
Lets go lets go and when its over, you'll know
Lets go lets go, lets go lets go

[Chorus]
Life's a tour, I'm so sure
The ex so pure before you exit girl
No more games, I confess
Far from lame I'm just so fresh
Who but me? It's the big boss
New kid on the block, Mr. Rudolf (Kevin)
Two stars, hold your applause
I hold it down he holds all guitars
Half my life I sacrificed, but I only came to party tonight
New chicks, get my drinks up
Every weekend we can link up
New rings, with the pink cuts
You'll need a passport, get your Minks up
Took my turn she love it, each touch
And when she closes her eyes this what she thinks of, Boss

[Chorus]
Welcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world
