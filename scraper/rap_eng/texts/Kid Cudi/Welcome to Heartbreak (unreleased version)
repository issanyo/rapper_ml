Kanye (verse):
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all i could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all i got was a brand new sports car

Kid cudi (chorus):
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo

Kanye(verse):
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But i couldn't hear 'em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone... where did I go wrong?

Kid cudi (chorus):
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo

Kanye (Bridge):
I seen it
I seen it before (+ 3x)

Kanye (verse):
My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I wanna take
Bad enough that i showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak

Kid cudi (chorus):
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions I gottaget with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
And my head keeps spinning
I can't keep having these visions I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions I gottaget with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
Ohhhhoooo
Ohhoooo
Ohhoooo

Kanye (outro):
And I, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, I can't stop
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it
Ohhoo ohhoo
Ohhhhoooo
