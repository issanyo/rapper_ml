She gon give it up to me
She falling in love with me

Can't get enough of me

I know she the one for me
She not just company

She not just come for me


As it start grippin she startin to whisper

She say she want me but she just want me deeper

Baby we deeper than that

Me and you baby, i be dreaming of that

You share my name because you be screamin out that

All that shit in your past you can leave me out that

Because i'm here for the future

Me and you looking like kama sutra

Ima do ya, just how i do ya

Have ya ass screaming out, "hallelujah"

Ima do ya just how i do ya

Have ya ass screaming out, "halleluja"

Addicted, conflicted she is. envy's her friends

She needs me she sees it she dont need a lens

She's happy with me, it depends

Im giving her headaches or head

She dont go slow, she's so used to the fast pace

She poppin that back like champagne, i give her my last name

I give her the back pain, ever since her last man

She looking how her life change

She think that we perfect she dont think she worth it

She so down to earthy but her past still hurting

The future will soothe her she know that im in it

She been there before but she know that im different

She heard that before but she know that im with it

Can't leave her alone for not even a minute

She dont see what she sees in me

That's the vibes and frequencies
