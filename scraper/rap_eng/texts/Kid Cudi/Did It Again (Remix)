[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Ay, Shakira boo
Why don't you let them know what the deal is, baby?

[Verse 1: Shakira]
First floor (ah)
Room sixteen (ah)
Smells like danger (let's go)
Even better (let's go)
Set your goals (ah)
Bless our souls (ah)
I'm in trouble (yes, I know)
But it feels like heaven, hey!

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
You were like one of those guys
The kind with the wandering eyes
But I said, "Hey what the hell?
Once in my life, I'll take a ride on the wild side"
You were so full of yourself
But damn, were you cute as well
You liked my legs, I liked your moves
Anyone could tell that it's hard to deny that

[Chorus: Shakira & Kid Cudi]
Did it again, love, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete it
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Are you O.K.? Are you O.K.?
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Are you O.K.? Are you O.K.?

[Verse 2: Shakira]
Second night (ah)
In a row (ah)
Back in trouble (let's go)
I don't get it (let's go)
Gotta keep it down
'Cause the lobby called
We ignore it (yes, I know)
It's getting better
When it comes to men, it's known
That I end up choosing wrong
Cause I always trip and fall
On the same old rock and repeat and go back
How blind a girl can be
To miss you hide your ring
Thought about everything
I'm so naive imagining and all that

[Chorus: Shakira & Kid Cudi]
Did it again, love, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete it
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Are you O.K.? Are you O.K.?
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Are you O.K.? Are you O.K.?

[Bridge: Shakira]
It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
"Right back at ya," 'cause I'll survive...

[Interlude: Kid Cudi]
Now, see, I can put you where you want to be, believe that
See, now I can put you where you need to be
You can believe that
Ah, whenever with everything
If you let me don't try to keep again
If you considerin' by stoppin' this flow
You need a friend
So break me off a piece of that
So sweet so wet, the kitty cat
And you cruising home, remember that
I need you soon, I'll be your groom
You feeling this vibe this night in June
I remember you said your hips don't lie
Love it when they move
All I wanna to bring is good vibes in your life
Your love consumes
All day, every day I dream I think of only you
And those hips... ohhh

[Chorus: Shakira & Kid Cudi]
Did it again, love, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete it
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Are you O.K.? Are you O.K.?
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Are you O.K.? Are you O.K.?
