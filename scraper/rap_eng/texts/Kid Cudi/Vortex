Just one look at your body girl
I want to move with your body girl
I want to live in your vortex
You know what is coming next
I'm close to your body girl
Can I have it? Can I? Please?
Can I have it? Can I? Please?

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I gots to have it, just let me grab it
Got an ass so big she gotta drag it
Don't mean to come off like a savage
But this the talk when you tricking like it's magic
This is London (YES), this is Harrod's (YES)
Missed opportunities could be tragic
And once I bag it, you know I bags it
Celine section of your closet look like a Parrot
All colors, all shapes, all sizes
Bows on 'em knowing how you like surprises (YEUGH)
The world is yours baby, more or less
Anything just to lay up in your vortex (GO)

[Verse 2: King Chip]
I've never been so ready to be caught off guard
Had a menage in a car parked in the yard
She a thug, she keep a weapon, she look angelic
Her skin tone is hypnotizing, let you tell it
She Doctor Romaneli my telly and suck me heavy
She gross heavy, her net worth is ever steady
When she was young I gave her game, now she cold
Yea she keep them whips, mama live alone
She took me shopping, we got it popping, her body nice
My time is money, she want to spend it, she got a price
She got a home girl just as bad and uber-rich
The world usually cold, mama you a glitch
My neck hurt from double taking a second look
Even though you got money, was hoping you could cook
Was hoping you'd make a nigga squirm on the couch
Put this in your soul 'til you whisper ouch
