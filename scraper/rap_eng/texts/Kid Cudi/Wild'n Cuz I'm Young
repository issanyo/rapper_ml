[Chorus]
I be wild'n cause I'm young, wil-wild'n cause I'm young
Wild'n cause I'm young, wil-wild'n cause I'm young
I be wild'n cause I'm young, I be wild'n cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old

[Verse 1]
Liquor all night, love it
Untamed youth, the Coupes moves like bullets
I guess the fact my father smoked and drank
Made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wild'n all, me and my Codys
Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me
Dark skin China doll with the fake tits
Ice grillin my Spanish chick, word
We all in together, now we off it
Cops be buggin', shotguns on the whip
Fuck 'em, I would never sweat for a piggie
You can catch me high, it's all good, no biggie

[Chorus]
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old

[Verse 2]
Four in the morning, gettin' cozy
So much Goose I let the fries soak it up some
Tuesday weekly, the Legend of the Rager
Most have witnessed the Cud in the club
We don't have Plain Pat ready
Ice is thrown and the whole crew gone
Done off for better and very celebratory
Fuck the blogs, I'mma tell my story
No matter the phase, my name is engraved
In the minds of the young'ns who be livin' to they graves
You live and you learn
Doing bumps in the day and keep blunts to burn

[Chorus]
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old

[Verse 3]
Rage, cause I'm paid
Take the grey, and create another shade
Awesome, no more bitches playin' possum
Pop and lock 'em and send 'em on home
Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose
Know the code, want a woman with some toes
Optimos, takin' trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make it through the show
Hands, high
Go with your soul and try floatin through the sky
Hide the pain with some pussy and Mimosas
Costa Rica next on the agenda

[Chorus]
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
