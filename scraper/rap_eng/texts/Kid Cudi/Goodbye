[Intro: 2Pac Shakur]
Everything starts from now. You're crazy, man. You know what? When you said that last time, I was kinda trippin', right? But now, you're right. I am crazy. But you know what else? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about myself. You remember that, motherfucker. Cause I'm the one y'all need to be worried about

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
You knowin' I'm vicious
Daddy home niggas ain't doing the dishes
What is this?
For years I've been feelin' suspicious
Bout certain niggas motives and morals
And such, and like that
I done landed the ship
Parallel parked in the park in the dark
Don't be concerned if I'm makin' a grip
Own half of my masters, so muthafuck you bastards
Clones all a fuckin' round
When I step on the scene don't hear a sound
What more could I do?
So much, too much
The Chosen One has said stand up, be proud of you
And I'm here, no fear
Been hearin' all the calls, the chants, the cheers
We're clear
When I'm leavin' the show
You knew I was gon' be back to go yam on these hoes

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear the madness
I pray I lean towards the light, ya know?
I'm just livin'
Tryna stay outta' trouble, minding my own
The angels they protect me from the horror in my dome
I don't wanna have to tell you again friend
Please, leave a real nigga alone

[Bridge: Pink Floyd]
Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye, Goodbye

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Psych ya mind, who hit'cha?
Thought I would be dead
Yea, I figured
Nah, I'll be pullin' the trigger
Until then I'm coastin', roastin', leavin' you Ghostin'
Now, Check the approach
Finesse, the best, hittin' reps
Sets, gains
Call me whatever you like
But remember one thing
Forever no matter what, I reign
We don't care about your money
You corny on and off the cob
A shame, A 1 lame
A cover-up, you got no personality
Hide behind your wealth to hide oneself, sad
The shit is so twilight zone
Batman left Gotham now shits all wrong
Jokes on you Luke
Here is the Demolition Man
A nigga got a plan and I gotta
Get em 1 by 1, 2 by 2
The kids need the guidance
That real life
All in bitch you know my face
My name
The style
The catalog
Ahhhh
Cud Life the #1, 1
Cud Life the #1, 1
Cud Life the #1, 1 under the sun
The Chosen
Fucker

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear the madness
I pray I lean towards the light, ya know?
I'm just livin'
Tryna' stay outta trouble, minding my own
The angels they protect me from the horror in my dome
I don't wanna have to tell you again friend
Please, leave a real nigga alone

[Bridge: Pink Floyd]
Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye, Goodbye
