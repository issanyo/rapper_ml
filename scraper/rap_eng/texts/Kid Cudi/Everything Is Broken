[Verse 1: Mr. Hudson]
Everyday is just another crazy, anyway
I think I'm winning when you walk away
With all your trophies and your accolades
From the beginning, darling

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
I was just your token, token (token)
Everything is broken, broken (broken)
I was just your token, token (token)
Everything is broken, broken (broken)

[Verse 2: Mr. Hudson]
Travesty, you're at the top of your academy
Don't get too used to looking down on me
Soon you'll be calling me your majesty
From the beginning, darling

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
I was just your token, token (token)
Everything is broken, broken (broken)
I was just your token, token (token)
Everything is broken, broken (broken)

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Easy now, I tell you easy now
Before you say something that you don't mean to say
Easy now, she tell me easy now
Before I lose something, I'll never find again
Yeah, that's what she want me believin'
See me alone, looks can be deceivin'
One girl comin' in, two or three leavin'
Steamin', Willy Demon, they're screamin'
And I bet they all love him
In the Midwest, so they girls M Dub him
Met them way back when I posed for the Kodak
Tell me, how does it feel, unreal, real?

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
I was just your token, token (token)
Everything is broken, broken (broken)
I was just your token, token (token)
Everything is broken
Gonna take you for a ride

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
I was just your token, token (token)
Everything is broken, broken (broken)
I was just your token, token (token)
Everything is broken, broken

[Outro: Mr. Hudson]
Gonna take you for a ride
Gonna take you for a ride
Gonna take you for a ride
Take you for a ride
