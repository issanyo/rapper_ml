Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' light, 2 am summer night
I don't care, hands on the wheel, drivin drunk, I'm doin' my thing
Rollin the Midwest side and out livin' my life getting' out dreams
People told me slow my roll I'm screaming out fuck that
I'm gonna do just what I want and there ain't no turnin' back
If I fall if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and
I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

Tell me what you know about dreamin' dreamin'
You don't really know about nothin' nothin'
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 am, cold sweats wakin' up to the skies
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams
Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothin'
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
You rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and
I know everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and
I know everything that shines ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

Hands on the wheel
Uh uh, Fuck that

Hands on the wheel
Kick drum, hi-hat

Hands on the wheel
Uh uh, Fuck that

Hands on the wheel
Uh uh, yeah

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine, once I get it, yeah
I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it, yeah
I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and
Everything that shines always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it, yeah
I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness
Everything that shines always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it, yeah
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
