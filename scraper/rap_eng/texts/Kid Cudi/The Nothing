[Intro]
Can someone, anyone give me candy?
Someone, anyone give me candy

[Verse 1]
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
You aren't going to cut it
Scary, scary, growing weary
Chop, chop, chop it up, cut it
Eerie, eerie, darkness nearing
No one hears you suffer
Purely, purely, there's no curing
Chop, chop, chop it up, cut it

[Bridge]
The nothing, the nothing
Chasing something, don't know what
The nothing, the nothing

[Verse 2]
Moving, moving, darkness moving
Near me sleepless running
Scary, scary, growing weary
Chop, chop, chop it up, cut it
Clearly, clearly, don't come near me
Don't you see what's coming?
Fury, fury, there's no curing
Chop, chop, chop it up, cut it

[Outro]
The nothing, the nothing
I'll cut you now
Fucking waste
