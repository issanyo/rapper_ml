[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I hate when it rains... all I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking of the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinkin about cash, nigga I'm thinking bout' life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rain dayz and the pain, just rest on my veins
Can't go to sleep, somebodys looking through my window pain
Mane, I swear I'm going catch em' but maybe I'm trippin like scarface
My minds playing tricks on me homie, will it
Rain, shit! I just wanna know where do' is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements, mommy let him come home
I think a niggas done doing wrong I get scared of the days when the soul will be gone
It's spoken word but thoughts never been spittin in vein
Seems like the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading the change, ask God if he feels my pain
And please would you stop the Rain...

[Hook: repeats]
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain

[Verse 2]
Grey clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul, on this earth, was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears runnin' down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
While my uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained
Sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play, I just wished I would die
Things
Rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy
Straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs...
To stop the rain

[Hook:]
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Can Feel My Pain

[Verse 3]
Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see...
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life
While every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
There mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantel
But I'm that boy to use the hand of evil dreams
God realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just somthin you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause I'm a just deal with the rain!

[Hook:]
I'm a Deal With The Rain
Tell God Just To Keep It The Same
