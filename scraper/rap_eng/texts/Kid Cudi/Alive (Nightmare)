[Intro]
So mean

[Hook]
Every time
The moon shines
I become alive
Yeah
And every time
The moon shines
I become alive
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling strange in the night
I'm not myself, I feel I'm thrown into a fight
Ah
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, nothing's right
My skin is burning and my heart begins to speed
There's something going wrong with me
I am changing rapidly
Ay
I'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move
Mm
I smell her scent, and I know I will find her soon, soon, soon
The one to come and free me from this fate
I'll find her, it's not too late
Hey-hey

[Hook]
Every time
The moon shines
I become alive
Yeah
And every time
The moon shines
I become alive
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm a beast in the night
I'm on the prowl while I'm hoping to find some light
You call it Heaven, I do too, we feel the same
Ain't nothing wrong, I'll be feasting on something brave
Ay
A sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure
Ah
I hope she can find the man within the beast
And
I hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat
Hey
I hope she figures out a way to save my soul
Yeah, to save my heart
Hey

[Hook]
Every time
The moon shines
I become alive
Yeah
And every time
The moon shines
I become alive
Yeah

[Bridge]
Nananananananana-na
Whoa, nananananana-na
Nananananananana-na
Whoa, nananananana-na

[Verse 3]
I watch the sun collapse
And took up in the clizzoud
I am the lone wolf, go where I wanna
Let the moon shine, be the guide to the lizzight
Even when I stray away the light never left me
Uh
I learn to follow my instinct
Blinded by the light, rather that than the evil
Feelin' out of place in a room full of people
Try and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel
Your fate will be whatever it shall be, be, be, be, be
Won't fight no more, I let these things just be, be, be, be

[Hook]
Every time
The moon shines
I become alive
Yeah
And every time
The moon shines
I become alive
Yeah

[Outro]
Nananananananana-na
Whoooa, nananananana-na
Nananananananana-na
Whoooa, nananananana-na
