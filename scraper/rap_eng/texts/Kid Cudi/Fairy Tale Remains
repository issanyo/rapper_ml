[Intro]
Tell 'em, tell 'em
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Cuts and burns, cuts and burns
My turn, shove it, your fake concern
The lesson is served, a lesson is learned
So much avoiding, memories fading
This shit is so weak, so weak
Suddenly, suddenly

[Chorus x2]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are

[Verse 2]
Nothing left, there's nothing left
Your turn, shove it, your fake concern
Fractured emotion, zero devotion
The elements fading, remains remaining
Oh, this is so us, this is so us
Unfortunately

[Chorus]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em where we are

[Outro]
No, no, she don't love him
No, no, she don't know what that is
No, no, no, he cannot love
No, no, no, he not quite sure what that is
Just kiss
No, no, he don't love him
No, no, he don't know what that is
No, no, she don't love her
No, no, she not quite sure what that is
Just kiss
