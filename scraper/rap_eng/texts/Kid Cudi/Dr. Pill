[Song Background]

[Verse 1]
My head is always busy
Stuck in a place I've been way far too long
It's not paranoia
I'm stuck in this hell
In this shell, I'm securely locked away losing who I is, in a coma
Tell me how to fix it cause baby I have tried it all
Where did I go wrong, or out of order?
Doctor give me help, can you help me Dr. Pill?

[Pre-Hook]
Oh feeling strange feeling strange feeling strange
Oh feeling strange feeling strange feeling strange

[Hook]
Wake up in the morning feelin iffy
(What is going on with me?)
When I look in the mirror I don't know who this dude is
(Staring right back at me)
Dr. Pill, Dr. Pill, give me something, I'm feeling ill now
(What can you prescribe for me?)
Cause when I look in the mirror, I don't know who this dude is
(Staring right back at me)

[Verse 2]
I admit I have been slipping
Stuck in a human-like cell
And it's got legs and arms
It's not me talking, bro, that is my face
I have not known who that face belongs to in a while
Keeping composure
Tell me what to do cause just talking it ticks me out
I want to turn me down
I'm out of order
Doctor give me help, can you help me Dr. Pill?

[Pre-Hook]
Oh feeling strange feeling strange feeling strange
Oh feeling strange feeling strange feeling strange

[Hook]
Wake up in the morning feelin iffy
(What is going on with me?)
When I look in the mirror I don't know who this dude is
(Staring right back at me)
Dr. Pill, Dr. Pill, give me something, I'm feeling ill now
(What can you prescribe for me?)
Cause when I look in the mirror, I don't know who this dude is
(Staring right back at me)
