(Check this out, DJ E-V)

Heeey, she say I'm different
I'm zoned like, how bitch?
She say, I dress cool
And cause my accent
Oh shit, this girl must want a nut
I'mma jizz up in her face
While I'm palming the butt
Didn't do my struck, cowboy mid-western
She did it all for me, now it's her friends turn
A young for more money, more models with asses
More heat, to spread to the masses
Funky glasses of a freakish nature
I'm crazy cool, nigga's need to learn paper

(Hahahaha, hahahah, hahahahah)
(That's a Cudi free style right there!)
