[Kid Cudi]
Have you heard the story (Hey Hey Hey)
About a man who had a plan, A plan ohh to keep it movin (Oh Yeah Livin)
Stress free, No he ain't trippin, Trippin no more, I'll tell you how he do it (How He Do It Hey)
Gotta keep it too trill, No soul and love for affection, Learnin from lifes lessons
Be different on the scene, And you will truly see, A different you, and me

[Hook]
(Oh, Hey Ho)
Do you remember me, (Oh) Ohh (Hey Ho)
I bet you don't don't (Oh, Hey Ho)
It's just the pimp in me (Oh) Ohh (Hey Ho)
A different me, For you

[88-Keys]
Hey Honey you remember me
I'm the one you burnt to the third degree
I'm the one you sent to the emergency
I'm the one who text you it's urgent please
Call back, And you reply "Fall Back" with a bunch of LOL's you typed in all caps
And I'm like "Aww snap is this who I dealt with?
Such Immaturity on this slim pelvis?"
You split, and shit I'm selfish?
You head to the next dude crib he felt it
He paid 40 bucks to the dick she sells it
And now he's irritated like Hitch with the shellfish
Tell this to wife "we will never get married"
Cause I was runnin' game like Larry to a Bird
Who can score alot of points while she dribbles on my balls but she go home with the green like Celtics

[Hook]

They say sticks and stones will break some bones
But am I in the wrong? I piss "come on"
I bitch and moan but I won't call you up bitch in this song
Cause you ain't feelin' that pain
You play alot of games so I call out your name like Paul Revere, For all to hear
But I had to chill on the curse so I (Love) On this verse just so I could get the sample cleared

[Hook]
