[Intro]
Plain Pat, what up?

[Verse 1]
My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dreamed of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

[Hook]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

[Verse 2]
My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bro
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

[Hook]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

[Outro]
I'm ready for that
I'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey
I'm ready for the funeral, hey
I'm ready for the funeral
Hey, I'm ready for it
I'm ready for it
I'm ready for the funeral
