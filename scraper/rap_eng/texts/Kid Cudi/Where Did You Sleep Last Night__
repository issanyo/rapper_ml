[Song Background]

[Hook]
My girl, my girl don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through

[Verse 1]
Her husband was a hard workin' man
Just found one mile from here
His head was found in the driving wheel
But his body never was found

[Hook]
My girl, my girl don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through

[Bridge]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through

[Hook]
My girl, my girl don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through
