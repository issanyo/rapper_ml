[Hook]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Verse 1]
Hip Hop ain't dead, it never died
[?] they flossin' commercial rhymes
And I ain't tryna be the savior
I just wanna read Cudi the Moon Man headlining on a paper
And I'm chilling, watching niggas fuck it up for me
Wanna make it dude, rap about selling D
Nope, I don't fuck with the dope
But I could if I wanted to, all the tips I get off the radio
And I ain't knocking the hustlers, never that
But when I don't rap that, they say my music is whack?
Damn, we got some fuck priorities
Hip Hop revolution should be top of the priority
I'm the minority, in my own minority
All the other bullshit bottom line is boring me
I'm here to make a change like Jigga to his clothes
I'mma make it a big deal so everybody knows

[Hook]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Verse 2]
Everybody gon' follow the bandwagon
And even the phony cats that be prepatratin' and actin'
They got a couple girls, thinking they mackin'
Instead of these hoes who these jerks usually slappin'
Super coolin' it up for the white man's Jiggy
Gettin' go, sellin' his soul deep in the city
This all talk about lil' ass shakin' in clubs
On every song that you got, be about the clubs
Niggas using samples, rapping on samples
Which is cool but it's bad when you don't know who you sample
Don't care who you sample, and that's just simple sense
We can't progress, we lack the knowledge of ignorance, well
In street, better see me for me
Give me some hot tracks, watch me R.I.P
Midwest Action ain't far from the lead
Who more than Kid Mesc could you possibly mean? Nigga

[Hook]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Verse 3]
Man, you know it's hard with the drama
Everybody wanna be hard, startin' a drama
Well I got some advice, be a gentleman first
Then next you should get it to some gangster shit
Make sure it's all real, no waste of shit
Be versatile, flip on some other shit
The only way hip-hop will progress
Is if we all put our all into a track [?]
Underneath the sternum to the lungs to the heart
This what everybody shoulda been doing from the start
Wish I from it, gave what the industry wanted
Just cause I'm black a nigga gotta stay drunk and blunted
Well, I do drink and I do get drunk
But you won't catch me coppin', [?]
But you will catch me droppin' the truth with the trunk
Kid Mesc got knowledge, Cleveland get him up

[Hook]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Hook]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your [?] wet
