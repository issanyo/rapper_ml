[Intro]
"Kill 'em, kill all them things"
Allow it
Dennis, you gotta hook me up with some more of this whiskey
Turnt up

[Verse 1]
Now I don't give a fuck what niggas doing
I'm wearin' Balmain thousand dollar pants
Wake up, bake up, then I'm in my Benz
Come to think about it, don't have many friends
Go to brunch by my damn self
Flirt with girls when they see my car
Fuck 'em when they see that I'm a star
Never ever open up or show my heart
It's the coldest winter in the summer, dawg
Many women, mothafuck 'em all
They just really want to train a dog
I'm a real nigga to the core
Off top baby girl further more
Pedal to the metal to the floor
On Mulholland while I'm hitting corners hard
Yeah I gotta hit them corners hard

[Break]
I guess I'm just a lost cause
Just a skinny nigga with so many flaws
Starin' in that night, tight jawed
Fingers digging right inside my palm
Waitin' waitin' for the calm
Seem to think I know what's goin' on
I'm finally comin' alive
And it seems the ghost is movin' on

[Interlude]
You know what that is? I told you what that is, that's a alien bruv, believe it
(Those guys didn't think I would do it, I told you I was gonna do it)

[Verse 2]
See, I could never have a desk job
My work take a nigga abroad
Meeting up late with foreign broads
Relaxing cause a nigga hustle hard
Man I gotta take a load off
Need a dime that'll take her clothes off
Took a trip out to Doha
Filmin' short films on a whim
Got dinner in a few with prince Sheikh
Kanye changed a nigga life twice
Gotta ride, gotta rep, ay
Getting rid of all the dead weight
Niggas really want me dead, hate
Not my fault I'm intriguing
Drinkin' and drivin': no weavin'
Pop a molly, feelin' ten again
Project X type weekend
Except a nigga damn near thirty
Like twenty one had never ended
Here I go with my second wind, bitch
You already know I'm goin' in
And I've been waitin'
I've been waitin' to shit on you

[Outro]
Yeah, G.O.O.D. music we the family
Kid motherfuckin' Cudi
