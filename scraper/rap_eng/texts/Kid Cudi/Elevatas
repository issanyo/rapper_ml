[Intro: Female Voice, Kid Cudi (Robin Thicke)]
Oh doctor, what are you doing?
Doctor, oh my!
Na na na na na, na na na na na, woah woah
Nice! (Ooh!)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Oh no, done did it
Kid Cudder
Move in the game like that, rockstar
None other, Cleveland representer
I inter galactic
Playing eight balls with a goon in a pool hall
And I got a little jar in my pocket
Baby girl on all my balls trying to hold it all
Lot of girls crazy you know they want a bum of it
I feel damaged fuck it, who doesnt
You show me somebody I show you a liar
Show me his niggas and I show you a whiner
No no no, we dont need no lighters
Get liquor for the balance the balance
Never get trees so I climb to the atmos
See this is exactly what happens
When girls in the room and the asses and masses

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
Come take a ride these elevators in my mind
Taking you up to floors you'd never thought you'd find (do it)
I'm at your front door (do it), I need an Encore (do it)
Please let me in, let me in, let me in

[Pre-Hook: Robin Thicke]
I can't stop it, drop it, leave it alone
I can't use it, abuse it
It's taking my soul
I can't stop it
Off the ledge now, (stop it)
I'm off the edge now (stop it)
I'm in the air now (stop it)
I can't stop falling

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
I'm fallin' fallin'
And Im moving so fast I might never go back
And I'm fallin' fallin'
Don't you give up on me
I keep calling for you, calling for you

[Interlude: Robin Thicke]
Baby (baby) baby (baby)
I said baby (baby)
I said baby (baby)
I said baby (baby)
Baby (baby)
Baby (baby)
Baby (baby)
Ooh!

[Verse 3: Robin Thicke]
Thinking about what am I doing with myself
My guilty pleasures have been out weighing my good health
(Stop it) I'm running bad lies
(Stop it) I'm on the wrong side
(Stop it) It's after midnight
(Stop it) It's after midnight

[Interlude: Robin Thicke]

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Feels like I'm all alive (Whoa!)
Feels like another why (Whoa!)
Feels like I'm gonna die, (Whoa!)
Feels like I'm going crazy (Whoa!)
I just can't let it go (Whoa!)
I just can't get control
I keep holding onto you
Please baby don't let go now!
