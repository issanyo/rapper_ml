[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Life is like a long love song so I vibe
Yellow brick road on 24's as I ride
Shorty is a winner, when I'm in her I get lost
Make her tremble like the middle of December on the frost
UGG boots in a coupe dual exhaust
As I fall deep in love, Mr. West check my pulse
Paintings on the wall, Basquiat is her favorite
Black Maybach way trilla than a slave ship
How can I not spazz, questions that I'm asked
Home owner at nineteen, yo I done learned fast
My first love cheated on me, she was heartless
She fucked the quarterback and seperated partners
I took my quarter back and played another cartridge
I took my locket back and threw it in the garbage
I sang a melody, it sounded nice as T-Pain's
Okay I'm playing follow me, just to peep game
We party hard and fall asleep on the airplane
If she flirty in the dirty, then she fair game
Checkerboard luggage as they holler all aboard!
Portishead in the iPod until I reach a snore
In the clouds of the lear, thinking of Shakir
Run the game like my nigga still was here
In the clouds of the lear thinking of Shakir
We run the game like my nigga here, Baous

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Talk, and talk, and talk, and talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gonna keep hating me
And we just gonna be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gonna take off tonight into the night

[Hook: Kanye West]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
