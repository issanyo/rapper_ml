[Intro: Rexx Life Raj]
Shout out my nigga Cudi

[Hook]
I look around, see my friends
Are not my friends, not anymore

[Verse 1]
I look around see my friendships
Dwindling in the wind, 'bout to fall down
Pick the phone up, put the phone down
Pick the phone up, who I call now
Switching, I thought you were all down
Niggas change like a cashier
I came a long way from last year
I upshifted to a fast gear
I, found it
I'm surrounded
Looking down down, from the mountain
Popping uppers, keep me grounded
My cup overflow like a fountain
See the stress in the money both piling
Keeping up with it all is a challenge
When you're popping their medallions

[Bridge]
Hanging, ay
Look at your face you look like a stranger
You can tell by my face that shit getting stranger
But I'll get it done, I ain't a complainer
But, lately I'm feeling anxious 'cause

[Hook]
I look around, see my friends
Are not my friends, not anymore
I look around, see my friends
Aren't the same friends, they were before
I look around, see my friends
Are not my friends, not anymore

[Verse 2]
I look around and some of my friends, a lot of 'em changing
I look around and everyone treating me like I'm famous
What's going on, what's going on

[Verse 3]
I see niggas talking 'bout a lot of shit on instagram with all them fake accomplishments
I like bitches like morning mimosas, that's bottomless
I been BS intolerant
Looking around, don't know where my partners is
I lose 'em, the more that I gain a following
The universe give and it take, it's given me a lot of shit
I guess it's just a concequence
Roll up my dope when I'm on the edge again
My girlfriend be trippin', I never let her in
I got my heartbroken, I won't do that again
Unless her booty fat again
I don't learn my lesson, never B
I don't believe anything, question everything
This is a god dream, this is heavenly
I fall out the sky just so it could level me
I'm too far ahead, you can never measure me
All this shit is written, don't ever question me
You gotta be kidding, you think you threaten me
If I die today, I'd live forever b
I'd live forever b, I'd live forever b
I'll live forever and a day, never get away
I been sitting back, watchin' niggas change
I been sitting back, for the simple fact that

[Hook]
I look around, see my friends
Are not my friends, not anymore
I look around, see my friends
Aren't the same friends, they were before
I look around, see my friends
Are not my friends, not anymore
I look around, see my friends

[Outro]
The cream of the crop, man
The cream of the crop, you definitely are
Just keep pushin'
