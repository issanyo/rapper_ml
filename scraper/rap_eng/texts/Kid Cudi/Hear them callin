Hear em callin:
I hear them calling me
My ear's aren't deceived tho
Im paranoid from the weed
Fucking extremely stoned
Barely speakin' without the stutter
The Blurry red and blue
Lights from behind
Smash the line
Thrash my ride
Need to get outta sight
I own two strikes
Under-going a third
If I can't provide and answer
For my high!
Lookin' eyes
Need to find a vice
Before stoppin' this ride
Debatin'
Hittin' over overdrive
Thinkin' 'bout
Racin' the piggy
Ch-ch-checkin' 
On the fuel gauge
While the car is revvin'
See it drainin'
Lookin' like its leakin'
It's enragin'
But it's that happen
When ur speedin' 
Like a high!
...speed demon..
Absolutely no gas left
No juice, to boost
No where left, too cruise
Everything to lose
Time to face the music
Pulled over now
I'm stressin'
Meltin' a fuse
One last tast
Before return'
To my quest
Swint as if
I'm starrin'
At zues's lightin' bolt
Just try explain I'd been theift
Of sleep
No abuse
Didn't get accused
Nothin' from my past
He leaves, a sigh of relief
Feelin' blessed
This didn't end
With me been subclassed
He took off first
And I waited n left, last
Can't believe
He didn't question my mask
Or my potent  high!
Musk
Not from the exhaust
I thought, I was toast
This was way too close
I'm glad
I didn't do like most
And dose..
