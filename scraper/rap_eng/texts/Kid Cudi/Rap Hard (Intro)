Y’all know how we do it, and me and my partner (Melwisky), we got this hot shit for you and we gon’ give it to you. Alright? So, you know, I been working on this album for a span of a year and a half and I hope you all get out of it of what I put into it. (If not, I don’t give a fuck.) So without further ado, let’s get it right into this shit. Holla at me, Midwest Action. Let’s go.
