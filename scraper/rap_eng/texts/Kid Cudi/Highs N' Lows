[Verse 1]
I be high when I split a dutch and fill it up
I be high when I get my money doubled up
I be high when a model wanna let me cut
I be high when I'm shinin' cause my diamonds blush

I be low when a nigga can't get away
I be low when I can't seem to make a way
I be low when I can't even feed myself
I be low when I realize I'm by myself

But I be high when I'm shopping for expensive clothes
I be high when I get what I couldn't before
I be high in the club while I'm poppin bub
I be high when I'm cruisin, sittin' on them dubs

But I be low at the shows in my dressing room
I be low when I see that I'm a different dude
I be low on the plane looking at the sky
I be low but my highs keep a nigga tight

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

[Verse 2]
I be low when I gotta get ready for work
I be low cause after bills my pockets be hurt
I be low when I can't take a girl out
I be low cause they can't even figure me out

But I be high when the phony chicks show me love
Cause in my mind I read em' but don't give a fuck
I be high when a nigga get attention
I be high when ya girl catch feelings

Then I be low when I go into the empty space
I be low when I'm lookin' at a stressed face
I be low cause my brother face through hard time
I be low with my nigga ridin close behind

Then I'm high when I know the places we can go
I be high when I think of what the future hold
I be high when she ask for my room number
I be high but my lows keep a nigga humble

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

[Verse 3]
I was high when the label said that I was dope
I was high in my eyes cause I had hope
I was high When I first had the taste of love
I was high when I left the city I was from

And I was low when I had a recent heartbreak
I was low cause I truly thought I had a mate
I was low when I lost her over silliness
I was low cause she twisted what my words meant

But I was high when I finally had the chance to see
Everything that's pretty ain't always good for me
I was high when she first said I like you
Man I must be too high to even write, dude
And these things show you growth
Some niggas show a little
But I'll show you the most

Highs and lows and succeed for sho
The only thing left to do is say a toast
Cause...

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

Won't you please save Scotty?
Help me, please
