[Sample]
I am the smartest man alive!

[Intro]
I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers and nobody wanted to believe me
All right

[Bridge]
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

[Verse 1]
Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

[Chorus]
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, whoh

[Bridge]
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

[Verse 2]
Bet you want to see me weak, not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day and night, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

[Chorus]
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah

[Bridge]
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah-ah
Ohh, I, ohh

[Outro]
Dont Fuck with me. Fuck with me. Don't, don't fuck with me. Fuck with me
