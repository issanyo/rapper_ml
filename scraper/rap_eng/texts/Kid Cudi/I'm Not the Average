[Intro]
So so so sweet, yeah
So so so sweet (CL, CL)
Come on!
Just come and ride with me (Head bang nigga, head bang nigga)
Yeah! Cudi nice nigga!
I'm different
Yeah

[Verse 1]
What the fuck ya'll niggas ponder when you think of K-I-D-C
Another motherfucker tryna flow up 'bout the ce-ze
That's right bitch, you need to pay respect
The checks on my Nikes these ain't the only checks I hope to get
Critics talk about there ain't no talent in the land
But tell it to your man who would spread it to where he can
Y'all niggas street dreamin', that's probably where it ends
I look down at you rappers and I'm only 5'10" nigga
Tired of niggas talkin' fly shit out of they mouth
Acting like they know me and the city I'm comin' out
I’m not a Bone Thug, don’t study to rhyme fast
I rhyme at a steady pace and I'ma make the same cash
Instead of talkin' bullshit, tit for tat
Hearin' these other niggas spittin' wack on these tracks
Instead of smirking and laughing when you think of Cleveland rap
Bow down, to Kid Mesc nigga, y'all know we did that
'Cause I'm

[Hook]
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average
'Cause they don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga

[Verse 2]
Don't stereotype Kid Mesc dawg, I'm not them
Don't be like "Damn my nigga, you sound like him!"
What you niggas know now wish y'all niggas knew then
I'm not that nigga
I'm the other Kid!
And you best be believin' my heat gon' simmer
I'm a special deliver while it hits you in your liver
I'll make your soul shiver, lay you still at your wake
Give these pussy ass niggas a solid reason to hate
I done leaped over the gate, but y'all scared to hop it
Speakin' about all these guns but y'all lames don't pop it
My album's so hot even your moms will go cop it
It'll take you millenniums for your mark ass to top it
Look look, now check here what your boy boy speaks
"Michael Johnson with the flow, work at your own speed", oh
You can't hate on a nigga that's great
Now y'all can't fuck with me I'm tryna get this cake 'cause

[Hook]
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average
'Cause they don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga

[Outro]
Nana, yeah
K-I, K-I, K-I, K-I-D
K-I (oh), K-I (sing it), K-I (oh), K-I-D
K-I (rock), K-I (oh), K-I (sing it), K-I-D
K-I (rock), K-I (one), K-I (two), K-I-D
Haha
Yeah, CL
Cudi
Rock with me, rock with me, come on
Bang pop nigga
It's the real, Midwest Action
Melwisky, I see you nigga
I'm not the average, I'm not the average
They don't know
CBD13
I'm not the average, I'm not the average
