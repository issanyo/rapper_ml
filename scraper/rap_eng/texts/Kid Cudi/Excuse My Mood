[Intro]
Every body put your peace signs up
Your blunts up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Excuse my mood, my nigga, but I feel a bit Decepticon
Revenge is sweet, years I was shitted on
I'm a cancerous lump in the throat of the game
Any hatin' niggas chemo flow, can never intervene
Already in veins, damn its a note under these shame
Mister skinny jeans, takin' things on another plane
They love it, they need it, and even if I'm never weeded
They will still seek it
I write it on crypt leaf
So the, the people read it, when I'm gone and dead
What is in his head, Complex magazine
Couldn't craft a better sketch of the depths that linger above
I talk to my dads corpse when I'm stoned enough
I be rollin' up, he see me shine see me holdin' up
They wasn't lyin' bout me takin' the train
Before I had the chain catch me on the jmc
I know some niggas hate me, I see you muggin' hard
Ah, you can't deny me, they all salute the underdog
I ain't gotta say it, I'm kinda like a big kid
Yeah

[Hook]
Excuse me, excuse my mood my nigga, yeah
Excuse my mood baby, yeah
Excuse my mood baby

[Outro]
Now, we told you all a year ago
That we weren't playin' anymore
And we mean what we say at dream on GOOD
This is gorilla
You can call me Moon Man
Bow
Peace and love by the way
