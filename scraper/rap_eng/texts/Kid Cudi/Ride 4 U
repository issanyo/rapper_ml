[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, you-mhm, you know what, girl, mhm
You, yeah, you, you know it, you, you know it, girl
Yeah, don't be silly, you you, you know it, boo

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
I'm here, I'm here as your friend baby, I'm here for you
Here, I'm here as your friend baby, I'm here for you

[Interlude: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, yeah yeah, no no, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? Yeah yeah
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? You know

[Verse 1: Far East Movement]
Look, I'll burn a dollar bill, I'll put my whip for sale
Girl if we was Eskimos, for you I'd kill a killer whale
I'd try to ace a test but cheat and get a C at best
I'd sling a bag of crack in Singapore and beat the death, ha
Anything to please you, feel success
I'd go beyond the bed and bath just to relieve your stress
The realest sex, no next, delete the rest
I'll call up DJ Khaled for your voicemail so you feel the best
Look I love you but you love a lime
Leaving sour face Skittle trails all over my mind
My imagination never leaves me far behind
So when you wake up from your shake up, you'll see who's down to ride for you

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? Yeah yeah
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? You know
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? Yeah yeah
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? You know

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
Yeah, ooh girl, don't be silly, don't be stubborn
Don't be spoiled rotten, I know what you want, you got it coming
If you can cooperate with the laws and the vision
We could be really good friends
I know I can give you what you're missing
If you listen, the littlest things are so colossal
If you could treat my world like it's gold, then boo I got you
You could be my homegirl lover, ain't no other
You ain't got to wonder, I am here, I am down for you
If you act right, you know I got you, you my girl
You got to understand my world, keep it so real, keep it girl
You and I, anything we do, we do it fly, you my A'est boo
If you by my side, I'm gon' ride for you

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? Yeah yeah
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? You know
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? Yeah yeah
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? (Who gon' do that?) You know (Yeah, uh)

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
It's just a simple thing, a simple thing
Baby if you hold me down, baby if you hold me down
I will give you everything, everything
You could be my road dog, I'll be your homie
It's just a simple thing, a simple thing
Baby if you hold me down, baby if you hold me down
I will give you everything, everything
You could be my road dog, I'll be your homie

[Verse 3: Far East Movement]
My baby don't trip 'cause she on the grown tip
I keep her on the hush hush, treat her like my home chick
You know she rather die, living life on the edge
A million miles a minute, living life no regrets

[Verse 4: Far East Movement]
Yo, her friends they be texting sometimes, but I don't
Ever give 'em replies 'cause they won't
Ever have what we have
Our conversations are crack, the little face at your laugh
You've got me fiending for that, that, that

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? Yeah yeah
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? You know
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? Yeah yeah
Tell me now who gon' ride for you? You know
