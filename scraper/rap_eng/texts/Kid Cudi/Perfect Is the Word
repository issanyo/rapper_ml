[Verse 1]
Perfect is the word
It’s the main thing that the lost souls want
Well not me I've seen things
Seen things, things that I wish I had not
No worries, it is my destiny to be where I am
I said listen to tick go tock on the clock, waiting

[Hook]
Cause I won’t runaway, nah
I won’t runaway, cowards runaway (Not me baby)

[Verse 2]
Safety is the word
It’s the main thing that the lost souls want
Well not me I know things
Know things, things that I wish I had not
Don’t cry for me, It is my destiny to be where I am
I said listen to tick go tock on the bomb, waiting

[Hook]
Cause I won’t runaway, nah
I won’t runaway, cowards runaway (Not me baby)
