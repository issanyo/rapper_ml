[Verse 1]
I might go losing it and drive off of a cliff
Fall in the void
And if I blow my brains out all over the scene
That's madness curing sadness
These walls ain't talking back, might as well finally paint them black
I'm out of ideas
The ceiling is all I have, downward from here
I'm ripping apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?

[Chorus]
Confused, truth is what I choose
Heal I never do
Asking, "Who are you?"
I don't have one clue
Seems I hate him, too
Seems my color's blue
Who?

[Verse 2]
I always end up back in a cycle of shame
Looking in the mirror is hard
Some days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction
That's madness fixing sadness
Go on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain
But there's comfort in tears
Decoding my sacred heart, flying from here
No more falling apart, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?

[Bridge]
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun

[Chorus]
Confused, truth is what I choose (truth is what I choose)
Heal I never do (heal, I never do)
Asking, "Who are you?" (asking, "Who are you?")
I don't have one clue (I don't have one clue)
Seems I hate him, too (seems I hate him, too)
Seems my color's blue, ooh
Who?

[Bridge]
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
