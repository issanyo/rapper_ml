The rain, They say I'm crazy in the rain
But I'm thinking to change. oh, oh
She know that I'm lonely and I'm just trying to take some change
Girl is so fine as she wanna be
Hope that she sees me for me
Open your eyes to reality, oh
Taking this ride, oh its me and you, you
Your a sight and oooo
No need to worry about the people back home
We gonna fly to the sky and be gone
Don't be scared baby just hold on my arm, arm
Oh oh oh, hold on my arm, arm, oh

If you dont wanna see me spaz out
Its two sides of me thats nice and bad route
So talk the **** up out ya mouth
Ill my niggas air you out like window
What the **** you know about me
Nigga that in the window
As when I ride threw with the windows down in the winter
When I come threw i pop a sentence like I'm a senator
Kid Cudi the Terminator, the Predator
Aim for the **** niggas that would be talking down

They come around I'm looking at these niggas with a tilted grin

Walking down on Broadway in broad day
Though I feel something is wrong with me, me
And they say "Hey I don't know what's wrong with you,man
Understand this life was meant for you"
"Word. I'm cursed"
I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
