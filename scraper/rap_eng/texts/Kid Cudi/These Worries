[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, the crazy, the wizard
So much whiskey all in my liver
I really like the punch it delivers
Makes me warm while I high five sinners
All alone, trying to hide from the shadows
Ain't no use, it seems everywhere they follow
They know where I be at
Infect my mind tryna get me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Kid Cudi]
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride it won't let me fall victim no more

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Life is like that
Beat me up and I'll fight right back
Poof-poof, be gone
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, stuck in my hell
Lied to my mom and I ain't doing so well
Lord let me in
I feel like he's my only friend

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, the rager, the menace
Hate me now then hate me when I'm winning
Work so hard to not go insane
It's a full time job to not lose my faith
Okay, I've been here before
Alone for the umpteenth time or more
I'm tired of motherfuckers saying that they worry about me
When in fact they probably never gave a fuck about me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Kid Cudi]
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride it won't let me fall victim no more

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Yeah, life is like that
Beat me up and I'm fighting right back
Poof poof - be gone
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, I wanna win
As long as I can do the work within'
Lord let me in
I feel like you're my only friend

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Kid Cudi]
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride it won't let me fall victim no more

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, the rager, the menace
