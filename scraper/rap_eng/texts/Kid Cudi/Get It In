[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Hot damn, I am the man, I don't even need a scheme
I don't need a planI just say "Hi" then grab her hand
Told her I'm a dog with a birch to relax him
Say she want to window shop, I just laugh
Girl thought I was trickin', baby that's just sad
I pop so many tags, like I give grab bags
So when they see me, bitches do the mad dash
He will motion approaching up in the slab
Drink and smoking when they come to the pad
She just looking at me cuz she know I wanna smash
Eyes on my pockets now she checking out for my stash
Now this is the part where personalities clash
I subtract her then a nigga must add
I just need another to be ahead of the class
Cudi McLovin bitch I'm Superbad

[Hook: ?]
When they street or see me in the club (in the club)
All the girls always wanna show me love
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
You don't got to know my name to know ?
But You know I'm gonna do my thing
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Just young nigga on my motherfuckin' grizzle
Other cats simple but your boy Cudi sizzle
Got your main line when I'm all up in the middle
All because of my songs, all because of riddles
That is amusing to me cuz I'm the niggy
All these women they all so pretty
Which one I need? Which one I want?
The one that like drinkin' and good rolling blunts
I had one chick she called herself Tila
She was so hood kept a chrome nina
When I first met her we was over on mulas
Said she was interested on getting on some new cock
She was so cool jumped right in my coupa
All of this ? Tila threw my a loopa
Gave me neck while I gripped up on the wheel
Eyes looking at me like :"Cudi how it feel?"
I'm probably the coolest motherfucker ever rappin'
Next to Snoop Dogg and Devin the Dude
When I touchdown I won't clown and do the Deion
I'mma keep winning because the rest of them are peons
Plus I'm a fool for gold, so I'm shinin'
Ferris in a bimmer, sittin' back reclinin'
Back in the day bitches told me "Dream on!"
Now at the shows in the front screaming "Lean on!"
Ain't that something? (Haha haha)
Ain't that something?

[Hook: ?]
When they street or see me in the club (in the club)
All the girls always wanna show me love
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
You don't got to know my name to know ?
But You know I'm gonna do my thing
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
