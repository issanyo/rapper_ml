Born to do it
Even though my friends looking at me like who knew it
Run to it
The hoods just picked thy new nigga
Feel cats talking like who nigga
Is he
Where did he come from: CL
My mom prayed for me on my journey
Treat me like an alien something like Sigourney
Live through the game for the fame and the gurney
Tried to put me on the pedestal
Hoes treated me like who are you
Now I get to choose like you and her too
I just like girls not whores
But I have a chill time, make s'mores
But if I wanna plow something like a snowblower
I can work that ass like a workout plan
And then I holla at fam
Talkin bout Ye Don C Jigga man
Been represent since I met Quince and I get style tips from my homeboy Vin and
Com is the homie
Really doe is the homie
GLC is the homie
And Big Sean what up Gwan
I go monkeypaw on the record and they think I'm cuckoo
Niggas is sounding dated like they recorded in FUBU
Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words, man
'Til you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow, man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can't erase
Or eat what's on the devil's plate
I just tell the devil wait
Cause murder will not be the case
In London with Hudson
And them girls want some cutting
I'm with him so I'm cool
Plus my face on the telly
But I'm pissed at the moment
I got charged for some roaming
AT&T is on bullshit man I wish they'd stop fronting
But when I roll back to Brooklyn
Hit the store for a dutchie
They say homie keep rappin'
I say homie it's nothing
Now when I roll back to Cleveland
Hit the store for a philly
Niggas tell me keep rappin'
Cause them young niggas feel me
When I roll out to Cali
Hit the store for a Swisher
Niggas tell me keep rappin'
I say homie I get ya
