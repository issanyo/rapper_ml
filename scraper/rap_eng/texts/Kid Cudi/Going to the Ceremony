"Now certainly, we all recognize the extremely, extremely low probability of life existing on the moon."

[Intro]
Hmm, hmm, alright
Hmm, hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
Drinking again, drinking again
Bottles up, I'm in it to win
With none of my friends, just me and this bottle
People say that I'm off, say that I'm off
I wouldn't doubt it if you were me
Free as a bird, flying over mountains
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm going

[Hook]
It's all happening
I'm going
It's all happening

[Verse 2]
Hate what I see, hate what I see
I'm over it, I need me some change
Something to feel good, get me on a level
No, no, no need to cry, no need to cry
You straighten up, you're such an adult
You pay all your bills, yet you are a zombie
And you don't know where you're going
But you're going

[Hook]
It's all happening
I'm going
It's all happening
We're going
It's all happening
