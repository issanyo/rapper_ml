[Intro: Kid Cudi]
KC: Tassho Pearce and Kid Cudi
Dream on good
TP: Flip the bird, Air Yeezys on my feet
Check, No I.D. on the beat, check
KC: That that that that good good

[Verse 1: Tassho Pearce]
Hello, aloha it's Cudi and brother Sho
No I.D. on the beat so tell everybody you know
Still grateful for every bill I fold
May our haters live long so we can kill them slow
Father forgive my foes, have mercy on them hoes
They know not what they do the music make them lose control
They say tomorrow isn't promised, and may never come
But when she does, Niagra Falls forever sprung
These are the moments you could wait your whole life for
Standin' next to Bob Barker trying to pick the right door
More Henny, more Swishers, more kush, uh
The more I drink the more better she look
Sell a sweater in a desert, sell a diabetic dessert
I'm higher than a piece of snow flyin' in a blizzard
So high up in the air I'm hittin' satellites
Movin' at the speed of light, ain't hard to see we live this life

[Hook: Tassho Pearce]
Right now I'm so high
I could almost touch the sky
I could almost touch the sky
I could almost touch the sky

Right now I'm higher than I ever been
Higher than I ever been
Higher than you ever been
Higher

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I'm I'm I'm right back in it
Took a few to cook up, I'm surfin' in it
My demeanor they observe, love to mimic
Once a skinny nigga rippin' I ain't skippin' a word
Put some minutes in my phone so my momma can get me
She had held a nigga down, now I keep her together
Was Celine'n on the reg now she lives with the Chanel
I just want her to forget the past that we call hell
I can't say it enough, supply for my fam
At the end of the day, they make me all what I am
My fans they keep me level, it's way beyond the weed
We connect I know we special, We connect I know we cool
I know we fly them native motherfuckers love the tribe
Whatever I know we flavor, motivated gettin' this paper
Straight shining, motivated getting this paper
Straight shining, we winin' and dinin'

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tassho Pearce]
I witnessed the inner makings of a classic
Now every time I do it I'm comparing it to that shit
And haters hate it, that I made it with a passion
Feelin' like a mother fucker made it into NASA
Uh huh, I'm back up on my starship
Takin' it way too far, I'm always on that Mars shit
But still grateful for every bill that I fold
May our haters live long so we can kill them slow

[Hook x2]
