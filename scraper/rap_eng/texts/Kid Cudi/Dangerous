[Intro: Rich Hill]
The hairs on your neck...stand up

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Yea, getting busy, homie getting busy

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Nigga
Double O representer
I come through
I pull the song into a whole nother dimension
Cudi be rippin' when they mention
I never really gave a fuck about the bitchin'
I was bout delivery
Man these niggas mad at me, must be actin feminine
I don't give a fuck niggas talking about
Let's get it in
If you're talking reckless
I will snatch you for your neckless
And be shiny tomorrow in your neighborhood life is good nigga
You never play me on any given Sunday
To your dismay, I rip apart what you say
And I don't give a fuck about that man
Your bloggery is weak
Talk about that fam

[Hook: Rich Hill & Kid Cudi] (Previous hook overlapping)
Why you lookin' at me huh?
Dangerous
Everything's dark
Dangerous
Something feels wrong with me I'm...
Dangerous
Oh baby get out of here it's..
Dangerous

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Kid Cudi boss hogga
Cleveland representer double O I spit farther
Aim farther
I got my ignorant swag from my father
Try to ka pop, pop, pop your father
Niggas drop bombs on these bitches sucks
Dick suck, faggots thinkin' they gettin tough
Until they get sucked under the rug
Like they're in the rubble
Look what you know about Kid Cudi
Is no one better uh
I got my niggas in the back, when we be spark shit, spart shit
Everyday we're Rich and Marcus
I wish these niggas would start shit
Salute the boy's scout honors

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
What you know about Scott
Drop, drop ,drop it like it's hot, Ma
Yeah and when I flip it with the melody
These niggas try to play with me
Like I'm not the really illy
Oh, oh, oh when I was big
Accappella no body smoother than this young nigga
Bring the beat back
Nigga I will rip it and I won't miss a beat
It once was written man like Nas said Jones
Tell me what you know about this shit up off the dome
I don't even need a pen or pad, nigga gone
Catch me in any weather no one can do it better
I'm in the sun with the leather
Even when I'm hot, and I spit at these niggas could never stop me
I be with it
Treadmill flows never going nowhere

[Outro: Kid Cudi & Rich Hill]
Everything's dark
Dangerous
Never going nowhere
Something feels wrong with me I'm
Dangerous
Oh baby get out of here it's
Dangerous
