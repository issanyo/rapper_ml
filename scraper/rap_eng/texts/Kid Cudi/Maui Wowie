[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, back up in the mix
Aloha nigga, Cudi lookin' for a fix
Got enough dough, just to take a trip
To get a little pinch of the Maui Wowie
Oh man, here we go again
If you ever get a chance, smoke it with a friend
Me and Pat on a mission to get
Lifted like John Legend and shit
Get Lifted
Let's get lifted
What you gon' cop
Maybe a dub, maybe a zone
No matter what you cop, you should smoke it 'til it's gone
Walkin' on the beach with the sand between your feet
And all the Hawaiian girls singin' to the beat
"Hey, what it do boo?
You smoke good?
Yeah, me too"
Livin' in paradise
All through the night
And even in the day
Smoke 'til I can't see
What can I say
Nothin' like this in the world homie
Make you feel great
You forget you in the States, might relocate
So you smoke all the Maui Wowie you could take
Like

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
I know, I know, I know
I really need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Really need to go, go
Really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I know, I know, I know
You really need to go, go
You really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
