[Intro]
I can see through you
I can see through you

[Chorus]
Amen, amen
I will slay them, I won't save men
The demons walk around with an appetite
I see them demons walk around in daylight, I see 'em
Amen, I will slay them

[Verse]
Oh, beware of the manic man
A man can equal bandstand
Rip faces up with my bare hands
You fake niggas and bitches
Yeah, I know you're wearing a mask
Yeah, I know you're wearing a mask
Get out with your phony ass
With your stories and your phony plans

[Chorus]
Amen, amen
I will slay them, I won't save me
Demons walk around with an appetite
Demons walk around in daylight
And I will slay them, I won't save men

[Verse]
Oh, beware of the manic man
A man can equal bandstand
Rip faces up with my bare hands
You fake niggas and bitches
Yeah, I know you're wearing a mask
Yeah, I know you're wearing a mask
Get out with your phony ass
With your stories and your phony plans

[Chorus]
Amen, amen
I will slay them, I won't save men
Demons walk around with an appetite
Demons walk around in daylight
Amen, I will slay them
