[Intro]
Hello, hello, doctor, doctor
Doctor, there's something wrong inside of me
There's something, I don't know doctor, help me
Well is there, is there something I can do?

[Verse 1]
No remorse, no remorse
Got a couple bundles of dynamite
And some hand grenades
No remorse, no remorse
You never should've angered the kids

[Chorus]
The darkness is coming
The darkness is coming

[Verse 2]
No remorse, no remorse
Sounds like you wouldn't believe

[Chorus]
The darkness is coming
The darkness is coming
Oh you fools start running
Dead man walking

[Bridge]
Right foot, left foot
Left foot, right foot
Doctor, what am I to do?
What am I to do?

[Chorus]
The darkness is coming
And guess what it's wanting
Fools start running
Dead man walking
