[Hook]
Since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Surrounded by infinite light, surrounded by infinite light
Since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Cosmic Warrior, surrounded by infinite light
Surrounded by infinite light

[Bridge]
Legend goes

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I took a swan dive
Need to say I'm okay
War all behind me
Metaphor for the life of mine
Searchin' far and wide
Never needed to, overdrive
Kept it close, no ends
Must have stayed true to who I am
I always knew, what to do

[Hook]
'Cause since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Surrounded by infinite light, surrounded by infinite light
Hmm, Since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Cosmic Warrior, surrounded by infinite light
Surrounded by infinite liight

[Bridge]
Legend goes
Legend goes
Legend goes
Legend goes

[Hook]
Since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Surrounded by infinite light, surrounded by infinite light (hmm) Since birth it was prophecy, the Cosmic Warrior
Cosmic Warrior, surrounded by infinite light
Surrounded by infinite light

[Harmonizing]
Mmmm
Mmmm

[Outro]
I t-t-took a swan dive
T-took a swan dive, took a swan dive
Hmmm, mhmm, mhmm
