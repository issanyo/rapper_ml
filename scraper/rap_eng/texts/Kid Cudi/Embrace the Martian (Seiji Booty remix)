Ex-nay on the bullshit man
When I roll back to Cleveland
And I can't believe them
The sounds of the nonbelievers
Outcast til I'm in dirt, before it did hurt
Now I can understand how you could dismiss and front on
Ask me how I feel about the ones with closed eyes
My words how I feel exactly
Off o' that
I don't give a damn about "ne" one
Hater talkin' down
Don't be afraid at all y'all
All I ask of y'all is to please

Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' with me
Please
Embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

See I must tell you all now
Keep on acting funny
Who am me?
I am here to change that
How you're thinking often and it's startin'
I am here to show you how it feels to be new
Look at what I made you God to teach you
Honest been insecure cool
And you are cool
Brought a heavy, heavy amount some
Malarkey mixed with carbide
Sorry to admit it dawg
Don't be afraid at all y'all
All I ask about y'all is to please

Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' with me
Please
Embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' with me
Please
Embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

Licensed to ill
I promise I won't turn the whole world to Cloverfield
On the real, yeah I will
I'll destroy it and then rebuild
Just for thrills
Sometimes you got to do it
Sometimes you show the tough love
No one is above what you are hearin' now dude
No matter who else included

I'm saluted
I'm saluted
No matter who else included
I'm saluted(Yeah, Yeah)
I'm saluted

Oh
Whether you appeal
Or not
This is the real
Real recognized real
You
You are me
Like it or not
And I
I am you-o-o-o

Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' with me
Please
Embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' with me
Please
Embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

Oooo
Oooo
And this is how it sounds
In my mind
Ooooo
