[Hook] x2
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons

[Verse 1]
I was born on the pirate ship
Hold your tongue to say that
Super duper nervous all the time
Never chill back
Never caught slippin', even in my kicks made of ice
All day, all day lookin foward to the night
Feel like I'mma die any minute, so I live on tracks beyond these limits
You should stay free when I partyin and wippin
I can hear them coming, the demons like to listen
I trip out sippin, I re-lax stoned
Never feel safe even if I'm at my home
They can still find me, we ridin all the time
Hot damn she is fine, hope she party all the time
I can be your Eddie, my dick is up and ready
The lust takes over, merging all the hours
Before I go sour, I step back and look at
The evils got me tooken, most cats be shooken
