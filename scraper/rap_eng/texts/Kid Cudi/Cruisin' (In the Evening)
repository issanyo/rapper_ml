[Hook](x2)
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I've been drinking all night, but I'm cool to roll
Red lights, stop at 'em very slow
Playing, "Feel So Good" by Mase
I got three chicks, one in the back, it's never up
Two chicks up in the front with me
They love the midwest accent thing
So I'm steady on my game talk
Steady on my good side
Love the Cleveland swag
Doors swinging, we some clowns right?
Girlies all around as we pull up to the Mirage
And I just open up the doors on 'em
Cudder lean got 'em in my Bathing Apes
Got 'em all intrigued
All I can do is just smile and wave
Cause that's how it be, when you paid

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Now the mood is good, the champagne's flowin'
And she's feeling me, I'm digging where we goin' (and uh)
After the club we headed straight to the IHOP (the IHOP)
But I'm sipping slow, trying to remain at ease
Waving my hand, doing my dance at peeps (what it do)
Me and my leaners we gon' party and all that, and all that (and we will)
So we gather on a zip, my shit rock
I rap hard, Kid Cudi got that mean mean, the crackheads
Hoes look who when I whip whip the cutlass, the cutlass
So I can't even trip because I love it when I'm ridin'
That Cleveland city whip appeal I need it I ain't lyin'
I love it just as much as model girls and Hennessy cognac
And it's all that, so I be

[Verse 3: In-Doe]
(Cudi man we gotta tell 'em how we do it in the NY)
Hey hey, yeah your boy stay fade
Higher than you sire, yes that's how I stay
About to blow fast you could call it Minute Maid
But I've never been that minute man I'm in it to amaze
Cudi killed the track, the flowers in the vase
Dude so cold you could put him in a grave
Here with some leaners
Dude's washed up, you could call us the cleaners
About to see home boy, sitting in the Beamer
With a dime chick cause she love my demeanor
Cudi, that's my buddy
He get a full discount, nigga just like a senior
Floatin', smoking on that funky cold me-haze
You see, we cruisin' like the Nina and the Pinta
Crack the Dutch, got light green with magenta
I'll show ya how to do this
Yes I'm the instructor
Come ride with a nigga cuz I'm the conductor
