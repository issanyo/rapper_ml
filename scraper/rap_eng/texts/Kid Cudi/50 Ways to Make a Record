[Verse 1]
You sit and think about how you can hit the scene
Take one look inside, your mirror clear to see
You need to find yourself as honest as can be
There must be 50 ways to make a record
Now don't get wrapped into the hype and what they think
This shit ain't rocket science and the scene changes with beats
And now you ask yourself, how you want to be seen
There must be 50 ways to make a record
He's up inside the clubs, they like to lean and rock, oh
Stands around and looks intrigued by what he saw, now he asks me
How he can make hit songs to reach the top
There must be 50 ways to make a record
50 ways to make a record

[Verse 2]
You got talent and your soul cannot be bought
He looked and smiled at me and told me "Thanks a lot."
See I could use your help
And would you please explain about the 50 ways
It's kind of easy if you have a open mind
This game is more than spending money and fucking dimes
It's all within your words, some shit that outlives time
There must be 50 ways to make a record
50 ways to make a record
