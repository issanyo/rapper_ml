I'd like to welcome everybody to the wonderful world of Kid Mes-Cudi
You know what I'm saying

You know we get it in
Chillin', drinkin' , and smokin' that 10 K

We party all the time

[Verse 1]
When it's over with, the heats comin' in
Chillin', drinkin' and smokin', we gon' get it in
Comin' out the house down tees and some jeans
I'm at my people's strips, something we can tease
Now I ain't gettin' drunk Nigga, but I'm gettin' right
I gotta keep my compose before the nightlight fam
In the night life, yeah that's some shit right
Clowin' in the streets livin' up all night
Money's good cause I stacked up all week
We gon' cop a bottle other then the soft drinks?
Mix it up right, mix it up slick
It's the mystery mix make them girls turn tricks
But we rollin' now, headed downtown
And I'm drinkin' and drivin', but I'mma hold it down
Malt whiskey, pass me the cup
And while your at it my nigga open the doors up

[Chorus]
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 2]
We do laps around Flats
Just to check out the clubs
And we sippin' our drinks
They can our lungs
Girls poppin' cause they Curious George
They can't master ours
Made available in stores for sure
They don't even know it's a store
Them other niggas is lame they makin' you poor
Nigga we scream down the strip
How I beam on a bitch
In my head, like a sandman I'm already rich
But um — The lines are thick so girls take a pick
"So how it standing Boo?" — Come take a sip
Yeah take a sip, got lots to go round
What we headed to? You know we Telly-bound
I'mma put it in you so you like it
Then I'm gone, like the wind
Don't be mad girl, I got other friends
"Will I call you boo?" That depends
If I remember or forget how the night ends

[Chorus]
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
We going to party all the time
Party all the time
