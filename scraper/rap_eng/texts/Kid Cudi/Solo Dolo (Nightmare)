[Verse 1]
Listen good
I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, no, no

[Hook]
Oh-whoa-whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right, do right?
Oh-whoa-whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Look at me
You tell me just what you see
Am I someone whom you may love, or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?
I need some answers, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Oh-whoa-whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right, do right?
Oh-whoa-whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
My world turns
Flippin' the bird
To the ones who figure
Me outcast, no, not the duo
Back in Shaker Heights where they knew who
Do's little brother was a strange one, boo-hoo
Cry me a river, hater look who
Traveled out an igloo
Cold-cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizz-alls
Mute motherfuckers back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind, no sail
Ahoy...
Ahoy...

[Verse 4]
Listen good
I don't need nobody
This is, what you feel, are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid, hey, hey

[Hook]
Oh-whoa-whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right, do right?
Oh-whoa-whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo

[Outro]
Why must it feel so right
When I know that it's wrong, it's wrong?
When will I ever learn
From the words in my songs?
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
