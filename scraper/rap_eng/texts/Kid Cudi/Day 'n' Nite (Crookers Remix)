Day n nite. I toss and turn, I keep stressin’ my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see I don’t attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see I’m not that fast
I think I’m first but surely finish last, last

‘Cause day n nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He’s all alone through the day n nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite
Day n nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He’s all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner- Mr. Solo Dolo
He’s on the move, can’t seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made
Made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won’t hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don’t seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through
Through

Cause day n nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He’s all alone through the day n nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite
Day n nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He’s all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite

Slow mo
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive, though he is feelin blue
The sun is shinin man he’s super cool
Cool
The lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he’s on the way
To free his mind in search of…
To free his mind in search of…
To free his mind in search of…

Day n nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He’s all alone through the day n nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite
Day n nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He’s all alone, some things
Will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at
Night
