[Refrain: will.i.am]
I got some money in my pocket and I wanna go shopping
And go buy me some things I like
I saw some kicks up in the mall that I just gotta be rocking
I love to rock them things I like
I'm your material guy, I just wanna look fly
Cool suits, dope boots
Get them the things I like
Cause when I get my gear straight them honeys gonna be jocking, yeah

[Chorus: Natalia Kills]
I'm free
I just spent all my money
But I rock that like it don't cost a thing
Free
Burnt a hole in my pocket
But I rock that like it don't cost a thing

[Verse 2: Natalia Kills]
Call me a perfectionist
Addicted to immaculate
The hair right, shoes tight
Got to look the dress the part
I've nothing in my pocket
Got a catwalk for a closet
On my last lonely dollar
Lock me up before I hit the store

[Pre-Chorus 1: Natalia Kills]
Wanna be like Midas when my bank account is minus
Gotta stretch that dollar bill, stretch that dollar
Need a genie in a bottle, change a quarter to a hundred
Gotta stretch that dollar bill, stretch that dollar

[Chorus: Natalia Kills]
I'm free
I just spent all my money
But I rock that like it don't cost a thing
Free
Burnt a hole in my pocket
But I rock that like it don't cost a thing

[Verse 3: Natalia Kills]
I wear it once and I don't pop the tag
The next day I'ma bring it back
I'm at the store
Can't find nothing cheaper than my credit score
My wallet's anorexic
Can I pay my rent the next month?
I can hear my name calling from stilettos on display

[Pre-Chorus 2: Natalia Kills]
Window shopping's overrated, If I see it I'ma take it
Gotta stretch that dollar bill, stretch that dollar
This Vogue is only paper, I can't wear the glossy pages
Gotta stretch that dollar bill, stretch that dollar

[Chorus: Natalia Kills]
I'm free
I just spent all my money
But I rock that like it don't cost a thing
Free
Burnt a hole in my pocket
But I rock that like it don't cost a thing

[B-Section: Natalia Kills]
Get ya 5's, get ya 10's, get ya 20's out
Get ya 5's, get ya 10's, get ya 20's out
Get ya 5's, get ya 10's, get ya 50's out
Get ya 5's, get ya 10's, get ya 50's out

[Refrain: will.i.am]
I got some money in my pocket and I wanna go shopping
And go buy me some things I like
I saw some kicks up in the mall that I just gotta be rocking
I love to rock them things I like
I'm your material guy, I just wanna look fly
Cool suits, dope boots
Get them the things I like
Cause when I get my gear straight them honeys gonna be jocking, yeah

[Bridge: Natalia Kills]
I need to marry a man from Bel Air
One rack, two rack, ladies cleared
I can fill an aircraft hanger with my coat hangers
Bankrupt? It don't matter
Girls cut their eye cause they so mad
I could look fresh in a potato sack
Need an overdraft on my overdraft
If the bank man calls, just tell him

[Chorus: Natalia Kills]
I'm free
I just spent all my money
But I rock that like it don't cost a thing
Free
Burnt a hole in my pocket
But I rock that like it don't cost a thing

[B-Section: Natalia Kills]
Get ya 5's, get ya 10's, get ya 20's out
Get ya 5's, get ya 10's, get ya 20's out
Get ya 5's, get ya 10's, get ya 50's out
Get ya 5's, get ya 10's, get ya 50's out

[Outro: Natalia Kills]
I'm free free
I'm free free free, yeah
I just spent all my money
But I rock that like it don't, don't cost a thing
Oh, it don't cost a thing
Don't cost a thing
