It seems
No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
So it seems
No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
I’ve learned
No one wants a troubled boy
All they know is trouble boy
And I’ve learned
No one wants a troubled boy
Show them you’re a stronger boy

Awesome hums :)

It seems
No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
So it seems
No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
And I’ve learned
No one wants a troubled boy
All they know is trouble boy
And I’ve learned
No one wants a troubled boy
Show them you’re a stronger boy

Still have
(NO ONE)
Still have
(NO ONE)

It seems
No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
It seems
No one wants a troubled boy
Leave alone the troubled boy
And I’ve learned
No one wants a troubled boy
All they know is trouble boy
And I’ve learned
No one wants a troubled boy
Show them you’re a stronger boy

Goodbye
