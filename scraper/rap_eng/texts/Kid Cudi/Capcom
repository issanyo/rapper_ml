[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow

You think you can take me?
See this is what makes me (Come on)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I look into you toothless until you know what's your past
To try it, it would be stupid, your choice of technique is foolish
Battle be strong the new kid
Don’t matter my scars were leaking
I’ll be standing still demanding, I’ll be winner
Rapid punches delivered
Your soul is feeling weaker by the moment
I stood before opponents all my energy I’m holding
Victory to me you see those other main components
Pow Pow Pow I knock em down
I am flawless in every round

[Hook]
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
No, no, no, I won't get bodied
My heart is powered with power from cowards
I may be tired from steppin up to a champion
Hit them up and break them down
I’m aiming to break some bones
I’m focused and overdosed on adrenaline
And I strengthen them with confidence
Every hit and every kick is rapid fire
And my thoughts is sour if I feel there is no lighter
Here, summon every single bit of courage
In my lion heart
They start it then I finish it
We’ll finish it

[Hook]
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
