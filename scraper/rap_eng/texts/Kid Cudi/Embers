[Verse]
Sit and watch the embers, claw marks on the sleeve
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
I realize there are no answers to rid me of this cancer
Still I really gotta leave, see I really gotta leave
Float in a sea of emotions, taken over by fatigue
I told you I had to leave, I told you I had to leave
Hold my hand in heaven, count the heartbeats and count the seconds
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave

[Verse]
Sit and watch the embers, claw marks on the sleeve
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
I realize there are no answers to rid me of this cancer
Still I really gotta leave, see I really gotta leave
Drown in a sea of emotions, taken over by fatigue
I told you I had to leave, I told you I had to leave
Hold my hand in heaven, count the heartbeats and count the seconds
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave

[Outro]
I told you I had to leave
I told you I had to leave
I'm happy when I'm alone
Thank you ladies and gentlemen, bye
