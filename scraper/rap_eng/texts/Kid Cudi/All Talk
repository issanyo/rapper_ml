[Intro: Christian Bale]
Think for one fucking second, what the fuck are you doing? Are you professional or not? No! No! Don't shut me up!

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Ex-juvenile delinquent
Yes, relapse when I fuck with Jameson
I'm thinking 'bout death like it's pussy in my mind
And the vibe, and I'm feelin like life's so lame
Heaven's probably iller, with way more babes
Way more ways to get faded
My first album was emo? What the fuck
Cats tryna play me, now I gotta show 'em what is what
I'm the one who comes when you're feeling so numb
You're the one who runs so I'm the one who hunts you
Hoes try to remember it's so fun to confront you
I am the rager, I am forever
Half of the time most the time I'm blunted
If I die it wouldn't all be for nothing
And all my life I'm doin what I wanna
So I'm livin' in the moment til God push the button on me

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half stepping
Over here we ain't half stepping
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half stepping
Over here we ain't half stepping

[Verse 2: Chip tha Ripper]
I'm a cold young man Midwest Cleveland representer
My bitch could take your bitch home with her
I'm hot and cold, but never lukewarm
And niggas always talking 'bout what they can do for 'em
I'm the prince I came royal penis stay clean
All the shit that I seen you can only day dream
Runnin my city since I was 18
The coldest, so fuck what a hater might think
Chillin on the higher side of the clouds
Life was nothing like life is now
Just wanna have a couple dollars on deck
And change their perspec I'mma aim for the neck
In the club I see you niggas jumping up and down sweating
Only for attention
Pathetic
You only paid twelve hundred dollars for that old school
Name dropping ass nigga, don't nobody know you

[Hook]
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin
Hmm, these niggas all talk hey
Hmm, these niggas all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin

[Bridge]
I can show you how to do this lame nigga
Uneducated nigga I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do this lame nigga
Uneducated nigga I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do this lame nigga
Uncultured motha fucka I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do it lame nigga
Over here we ain't half steppin

[Outro: LCD Soundsystem]
Talking like a jerk except you are an actual jerk and living proof
