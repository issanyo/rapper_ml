Yeah, I see you hatin' over there
See you jockin' over there, see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout this girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Come on, hey, I see you hatin' over there
I see you jockin' over there, think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo

[Verse]
I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix
I don't need a bitch try'na tear my mind on my grip
If I had one wish, it'd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme
Throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed
I stand alone, alone I'll be
Heart of a lion still shining on your sucka ass
Workin', workin', workin', for inner peace
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin on so many pills
Hah, they figured that they know a nigga

[Hook]
Yeah, I see you hatin' over there
See you jockin' over there, see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout this girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Come on, hey, I see you hatin' over there
I see you jockin' over there, think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo
