[Intro]
I was wondering if you could possibly help me
I'm looking for something, I need a fix
I need something that will give me a little bit of a boost

[Verse]
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Start the s√©ance
Them weirding things are vicing
Till I finally say alright
Never will I close my eyes
I like to see my speaker smile
Hello birdie, what's the wording?
How do you do, how do you play?
Climb your mountain, think you're a fountain
Don't you get to ride my face
Play the teacher, I'll play the student
Play the asshole on stage
Play the clitoris code is morse
A thousand thank you's way too late (what's the case?)

[Outro]
Through the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life
Through the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life
Through the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life
Through the agony and strife, I see my so called stinking life
