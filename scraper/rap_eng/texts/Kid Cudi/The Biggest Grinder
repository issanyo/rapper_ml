[Intro]
I had to do it Mr. Ross
I had to

[Interlude]
I am the man so proud I am
Came here as a boy, staying here as a man
People they don't get it, try to see it if you can
Livin' in la la land ain't all that bad
Because...

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the stars

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I tap dance on the cloud like I'm Savion Glover
In tune with my roots like the Reading Rainbow nigga
I'm here to give the kids new li-ter-ature
I am the cure to the wack juice over flow
Gettin' a new beat, recycle' their old flows
What were they thinkin' when they wrote it?
The Lord knows, but I suppose raps hungry hungry hippos
Decided to look over Kid Cudi with the glow
Cool beans though, 10 Deep jeans hoes
Stampede fitted, in the Range with a knitted
No gimmick, real time, real heart, real words, elegant, a piece of art
I never be retro or like a cool kid
With only two songs, look at what I did
No famous name vouch and I'm still the shit
Nigga, first couple songs, no guest appearances
No big names, no big chains
Just Plain Pat visions with some sick aim
Now you sick mane, I ain't taking stabs
I'm just taking names then I'm kickin' ass
Me & my nigga Wale let them suckas pass
Until we fed up & wed up
Where niggas keep they swag to the heart
Ruin niggas hopes for success
After Lebron, I'm what's next
Next, next... to pass the baton of success
I pass an event, hoes seem to forget
My only cash flow was from bape
Now these hoes can't stunt pictures of my face
They know

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the stars

[Interlude: Kid Cudi]
I am the man so proud I am
Came here as a boy, staying here as a man
People they don't get it, try to see it if you can
Livin' in la la land ain't all that bad
Because...

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the stars
