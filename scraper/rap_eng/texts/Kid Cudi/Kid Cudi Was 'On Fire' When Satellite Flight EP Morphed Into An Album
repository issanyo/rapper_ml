Its official, Kid Cudi's new ep Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon is now slated to be a full length album! He hasn't given us an exact release date but it'll be for sure next month.

After announcing it'll just be an EP, Cudders shocked fans and told them it's going to be a full length album. I'm pretty excited for this!

To have a taste of what's to come from this new album listen to Satellite Flight!

In an interview with MTV, Cudi talked a bit more about the project.

"It was supposed to be this mini little thing for the fans and it ended up forming a life of its own," he told MTV News' Josh Horowitz. "I'm really excited because it's my best work and it's a surprise. People weren't really expecting it. I was just on fire creatively." - Kid Cudi

He also talked about where the album where intertwine with the Man On The Moon story:

"It starts where Indicud left off perfectly, and takes you right into MOTM III. It's like a TV show that ends with that cliffhanger. The album ends that way, where you get that one song and before you know it, the song is over and the album is over, but there's a 'to be continued...' There's more to the story."

The new project will be released in February to digital retailers first. Cudi also stated that the physical copy of the album might contain "flashbacks," meaning tracks that he recorded previously but never released.
