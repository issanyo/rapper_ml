[Intro: Hopsin, Nay Nay]
Yo (Tell ‘em how it is Hop)
For all you young rappers out there
Who think about blowin up one day
Just be careful man
This shit ain’t all fun and smiles and giggles and all that shit
(It really isn’t)
It hurts and it’s scary
Shit you can learn from my mistakes

[Hook: Kid Cudi, Hopsin]
I hear them callin me
(I can hear them callin)
Will I answer
(Will they answer, will they answer)
I see them chasin me
(I see them chasin me)
Will I run from them
(Will I run from them, will I run from them)

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Yo, this rap game is shady
It's trifling what they did it to me
Took away my whole fucking life
And then showed no sympathy
They'll trash you in a blink of an eye for another entity
And I always thought that me and this rap game were meant to be
Every day I sit alone in a dark room
Mad at my fucking career, just hoping it starts soon
So I put these white contacts in that I go berzerk wit'
Then wile out on rappers who made it that don't deserve it
I needed cash so I signed over my soul to earn it
I'm writing flows dead as I lay in a hole of curses
They promised fame
I ain't spend five minutes on its surface
My life is a bogus circus
I'm trying to hold my purpose
I'm writing the dopest verses inspired and so assertive
But I'm broke as fuck
Washing my laundry with no detergent
They told me "Hopsin your the best MC
The next big thing to blow up from the west indeed”
Shit..

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nay Nay]
To music my life was dedicated
I never hesitated
Givin up my friends for these beats, mics, plus pens and pages
Now each day seems like the worst day ever
I sit and think bout how they say it always gets better
But I don't see it like they do
How come my dreams never came true
And how come every time I walk around I never get waved to
See this industry is shifty
With their deals and it's a pity
Even though I'm spittin gritty
In this city that don't get me
Its like, lookin back at all my work
Was it worth all the effort I put forth
Trying to heal and change the earth
And make some use out of my birth
Or was it all for nothin
Puttin my name out in public
The times I spent writin something
Through the night while wolves were huntin
Yeah these blood thirsty record labels
With contracts stapled on tables
Won't go for one though I'm able
Cause I can't fall for their fables
So Imma do it independent
Imma try until I get it
When I do then Imma spend it
On what I want, I'm through pretendin

[Hook]

[Outro: Nay Nay]
Yeah
So just take warning
The world isn’t always as it seems
Not everybody out there’s good man
Yeah
Nay Nay
Hopsin
Kid Cudi
Yeah
