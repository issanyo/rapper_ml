[Verse 1:Kid Cudi]
Wow this career is so so commercial
I would say no
More after school special
Another story about an unruly teen
Become a triumphant
More than what it seemed
All of the glorious things that he dreamed
Made the life that he saw seem so sub par
A star that was shooting didn’t seem too far
All he needed was some rockets on the side of a car
Maybe a little weed to intensify the scene
To provide a solid answer to the question “why I lean?’
A bonafide fiend that be taking by the beams of light
Man on the moon ain’t a name it’s a way of life
And it’s a swag I hated
Until I found myself and embraced it
Its something I denied
Why lie to my soul
Truth be told…

[Hook]
Oh no
I thought my mind was capped
Until I open my eyes
And see what finally happened for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me to it for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
Oh no
These niggas thought I was capped
Until they open their eyes
And see what finally happen for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me to it for a reason god
I think I know why (why)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I’m just a dreamer
Turned true to life leaner
Born to do good
So others can be believers
Once had a lover, but I had to leave her
My life is much bigger
The plan I mean
Its all set in motion, the plan I’ve seen
Couldn’t figure out my purpose till the sky changed scenes
While them other niggas ride watching screens
I was getting off of work daydreaming all alone
Daydream till I’m home
In my bed in my zone
Nobody would call
Not a ring on my phone
Raps so boring
I can’t buy ringtones
I’d rather have the Nokia alert
I’m so gone
Man I’m never alert
But I feel so good
No more hurt
I’m whole completely complete
Rainy days completely delete
I see…

[Hook]
Oh no
I thought my mind was capped
Until I open my eyes
And see what finally happened for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me to it for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
Oh no
These niggas thought I was capped
Until they open their eyes
And see what finally happen for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me to it for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
