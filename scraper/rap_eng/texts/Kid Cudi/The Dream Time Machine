[Song Background]

[Hook]
It's like a dream to me
All the things that I see
(Oh ho ho) It starts from something small
Yeah, I am the man now
It's like a dream to me
All the things that I see
Started from something small
Yeah, I am the man now

[Verse 1]
See (yeah)
All of the things they said could not be
Complete (yeah)
So in control of who I want to be
Yeahh Whoaa Whoa

[Pre-Hook]
Times have changed now
I've changed, a good difference
More champagne now
What I'm seeing for the world I wouldn't miss it

[Hook]
It's like a dream to me
All the things that I see
(Oh ho ho) It starts from something small
Yeah, I am the man now
It's like a dream to me (it's like a dream to me)
All the things that I see (all the things that I see)
(Oh ho ho) It starts from something small (from someting small)
Yeah, I am the man now

[Verse 2]
Go (yeah)
Far beyond the mind hopes to go
Fly (yeah)
You got places to be, can't let the time speed by

[Pre-Hook]
Times have changed now
I'm strong, a good difference
More champagne now
What I'm seeing, for the world, I wouldn't miss it

[Hook]
It's like a dream to me
All the things that I see (oh ho ho)
Start from something small
Yeah, I am the man now
It's like a dream to me (it's like a dream to me)
All the things that I see (all the things that I see)
(Oh ho ho) It starts from something small (start from something small)
Yeah, I am the man now
