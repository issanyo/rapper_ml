[Intro]
Another one!
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man (Midwest action)
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man (Midwest action)
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man

[Verse 1]
Never
Fold for nah nigga
Understand me, raps is intact
Like a perfect blunt rap, I take that
And getcha contact on my lyrical poetry
I rip shit down
[?] when I run around
Tryin' hold me back from greatness
I shake them quicker than puppets can do any man
Fuck them, I just stick with my mission, control
Niggas is clowns
Niggas wanna hold me up
Like security in an airport
Should I board now
Y’all got me wrong
Cause I'm dripping like the H1 documentaries, man
Who can fuck with me now?
Cudi ain't a fucking gimmick
[?] and vivid, baby don’t hold back
I live it, I breath it, won’t fade out
I spit fireball straight from my mouth
Bitches love my style

[Hook]
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

[Verse 2]
Homie
You ain't even gotta know me
Kill the raps and tracks
Get them buried in a hurry
Drink out beats, with the heat, just like a Honda
Keep rap hard, and my guards up
So doggy, what’s good?
Keep flowing just like a waterfall, faucet
Breaking niggas down like a brick
I toss it, jerks tellin’ fairytales
What would they dwell, say oh well
Most niggas are lame
I don’t even have time [?]
Like bananas that pick up they brain
I show you the big pick up in the frame
I’m bringing the flame, I’m bringing the heat
Lame niggas duck down
Cudi apocalypse now
I get around like 2Pac [?]
Niggas tongue-tied like nights, I take flight
[?]
These flows’ll melt ya

[Hook]
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

[Verse 3]
Simp
Get the guards attack
Kick niggas in the grill like [?]
Get ready for ace like a fine wine is made
Metaphorically speaking the flow
Niggas is slow
And I know
[?], run it back
But fuck that, take it to the hill off
[?] a nigga was built
MVP’s and [?] possibly, yeah
I be the one
Got the glow like Leroy Green
Directing your feet, son
Cudi hot shit, son
People be dumb as rocks cause Cudi was born a rock
And all they say is “Cudi rap, bitches and panties gon' drop”
No...
Nigga understand my mind
A nigga will see, homie understand my grind
[?] and just to see the cash money
Life attempts to estop Mesc
My niggas know me, know me
Scott nigga!

[Hook]
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

[Outro]
