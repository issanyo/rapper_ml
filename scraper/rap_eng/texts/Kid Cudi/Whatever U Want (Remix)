[Kanye West] [x4]
G.O.O.D. Music has arrived

[Kid Cudi] [x3]
I said its time to put your hands in the air
And wave them around like you just don't care

Yeah

Okay, Mr. Moon Man, has arrived
And to them lame niggas keep the middle finger high
I'm kinda like my mind, would you mind if we fly
Not rhymin' in metaphor, talkin 'bout G4
But

[Hook]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want

[Common]
Whatever you want, you could quit your day job
You could be my Kate, I could be your A-Rod
Christian Louboutin, ma telling you could model
Not you, a Real Housewife of Chicago

[Hook]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want

[Big Sean]
Yeah, B-I, G, look
To all the Halle Berrys and the younger Tony Braxtons
It's time to cut, glad you made the casting
Look at my jewelry, damn that shit's flashin'
Not only do I love it, I love it with a passion

[Hook]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want

[Kanye West]
Ayo I pull up in the, errr umm, Benz
And the girls say, "Ahh", like they imitatin' Prince
Okay, when I circle the block, hop in
Me, you and your friends
That's a win win win
Do whatever you

[Hook]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want

[Consequence]
Ladies this is in your best interest like a feminist
If going out with him don't come with benefits
Then why would you even wanna reminisce?
When you could apply in time for a membership
And get whatever you want, want, want, want, want

[Kanye West]
Now its time to put your hands in the air
And wave them around like you just don't care

[Consequence]
And once your done with that keep your hands up high
And if you with your girl let me see you get live

[John Legend]
Hey girl, we 'gon live it up tonight
Hey girl, welcome to the grammy life
Hey girl, you know how this goes
Doesn't get old, centerfold
Is all I know
Whatever you want

[Consequence]
You would think I would recycle by the way I found my last chick
Cause all she want is paper or plastic
And won't be happy until she find herself a draft pick
Or a D-boy with money in the mattress
So raise up your glasses

And lets toast to the good life

[Hook]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want

[Big Sean]
So go ahead, you can drink whatever that you like to
Champagne, Remy, or a little bit of Sky Blu
Yeah we up in VI, I'm right beside you
Scream like you like to
You're lucky that I like you
So get what you want to

[Hook]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want

[Common]
Whatever you want, you know that I want you
Be my turntable, lemme spin somethin' on you
It's the good life, that I wanna loan you
You know what its like for you to come home to

[Hook]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want

[Kanye West]
Now as soon as I change up
Everybody else tryna step they game up
Won't they, don't they, will they, nah
Still niggas feel Ye
So do whatever y'all want, whats the deal, eh?

[Hook]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want

[Kid Cudi]
I see them hoes over there they ain't you
And all the superficials want to trade your shoes
I see and never mind everything they might say
Baby girl sex good as well as the BJs
And a nigga can't front

[John Legend]
Hey girl, we gon live it up tonight
Hey girl, welcome to the Grammy life
Hey girl, you know hows this goes
Doesn't get old, centerfold
Is all I know
Whatever you want
La la la la
Whatever you want
La la la la la la
La la la la
