[Intro]
God, I thought I loved you so
God, I thought I loved you so

[Verse 1]
They done let in the skinny jean wearing
Fro for days in an old AA
Ballin' so low most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn, shout out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights I don’t sleep, figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo brain ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Want to know what I think

[Hook]
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch, my mojo so dope
Yep we live it, live it, yeah we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause nigga
We, we live this shit
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause nigga, hey

[Verse 2]
I live through words not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art, and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, passed the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
A lot of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga
Hey, we live this shit

[Hook]
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch, my mojo so dope
Yep we live it, live it, yeah we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause nigga
We, we live this shit
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause nigga
Yeah, oh, oh

[Outro]
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, 'cause nigga
We live this shit, hey
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, nigga
Yeah, here we go
On, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
And we dream
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and...
