[Song Background]

[Verse 1]
Move through time since birth I've been speeding
My lifes always been on coast
The things I think that I need and not was needed
The things I needed the most
My mama told me live my life and learn from lessons
I'll teach my daughter the same
Right and wrong is really always what you make it
I understand my place
Yea I will live and learn

[Hook]
Where did I come from. Where did I come from
Is it the moon or a planet I heard of
I don't know. I don't know

[Verse 2]
Feeling numb, no I don't roll with simple people
They don't seem to understand
I'm mostly happy, but sometimes I do feel evil
Sometimes I like feelin' bad
I like whiskey, black leather, and diamonds
Sue me! I like bein' fresh
Float on by, I'm in my zone and I'm zonin'
Live how I wanna live
Yea you will live and learn

[Outro]
Hey gotta take that ride baby. Woohoohoo!!
No regrets ain't got no time baby
Hey gonna take that ride baby
No regrets ain't got no time baby
Where did I come from. Where did I come from
Is it the moon or a planet I heard of
I don't know. I don't know
Where did I come from. Where did I come from
Is it the moon or a planet I heard of
