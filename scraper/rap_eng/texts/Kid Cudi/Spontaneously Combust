[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wassup nigga, this is how we guna do it
Let me round the back
Gimme your ID imma roll up in this bitch
Meet me round the back
I'll open up the door for you niggas
We gon do it like this lets go
Holla


[Verse 1]
We the sickest it don't matter, the same we spit game
[?] the front nine, my flows [?]
Chamber full of my rage, lames better not start
Ending this shit here and them lyrics rip you apart
[?], your boy he is the one
Nigga born from rap, the only begotten son
2Pac and Biggie up in me like mini who's flow is strong
Hitting your bitches up, all night I'm ripping through thongs
And later I'm ripping songs, consistent when I be spitting
Lyrically I'm a mac, [?] once it's written
Ya'll niggas are still ain't getting the point, you'll all fall
As soon as you jump that bridge, you suckas ain't getting across
Pay the cost to be the boss, pay my payments in full
Your game is worse than the Cavs, I guess that make you the Bulls
[?] I'm a fool, I done used a full clip
Gotta reload quick, get ready hold this

[Hook]
I spontaneously combust when other rappers would rust
Niggas say I got a problem, I wil' out too much
Dude, you know your nigga stay hotta than June
Leave other rappers under the tomb, holla back
I spontaneously combust when other rappers would rust
Niggas say I got a problem, I wil' out too much
Dude, you know your nigga stay hotta than June
Leave other rappers under the tomb, holla back

[Verse 2]
Get on my level, clap bitches grease up the middle
Lyrical riddle, jump in that skillet I'm bound to sizzle
I ain't cop a deal now, so imma stand the ground
Like a basket child until I get found
Gucci stick with it like a McLaren, It's all fitted
Illest nigga to spit it in the Indians [?]
City where niggas can split it, and stogies get split
Burners get lit where gully niggas carry the clips, the pits
Can't stop the genes in my cerebellum
Dumb niggas they don't understand hard to tell em
Niggas I know around the block, all felons
Freestylin with my boys, our flow is off the melons
See ya man, we been in the streets rule you fools
Gotta be filthy with burgundy Bentley by the pool
Got em at 8 figures, though expelled from school
Gotta keep myself skippy with them marvelous jewels

[Hook]


This is all metaphorically
If you wanna be in this class you gotta study me
This is the final, drink brew, get chewed, then I spit on some vinyl
And niggas tryna hate on mine though
And Imma have to chop em up bag em
Faster than Tony Soprano
I want keys like a fucking piano
Just call me Leroy I got the glow and them haters can't stand it
Young boy Kid must be the bandit, look nigga I planned it
Say your hot, ya'll niggas don't burn
Say you're sick but you don't spread germs
When ya'll niggas gon' learn?
K. I. D.'s gonna leave you under the dirt
Or cremated leave your ash in the urn
Nah I'm sick and tired of sitting back watching these lames get rich
Ya'll niggas pussies all ya'll need is a clit, get in where you fit
Around here, ain't no vacancies
I spit flows and rip shows in streets
Holla back

[Hook] X 3

[Outro]
2 step niggas, 2 step nigga
