(Verse 1)
At the end of the day
It will never go away
It will never leave my head
Will always dream it in bed
What can I do?
What if I was in those shoes?
What if that was me?
I don’t wanna bleed

(Instrumental)

(Verse 2)
Now I gotta chose careful
Only be with a handful
I don’t wanna end up dead
Gotta have caution with my friends
Who knows what’ll happen?
Who knows the future?
Only god knows
Only god knows the future
I hope I stay for a while
I hope I stay til’ god comes down
Fuck Corey, a cold blooded killer
His mugshot really ain’t a thriller
Why it gotta be this way?
Hope peace will come one day
I hope it will come soon
In a cocoon, opposite of Cancun

(Instrumental)
