[Song Background]

[Verse 1]
This is important, y'all
So please turn it up, real loud
I got a question and I need you to answer, now
If you walked in my shoes, would you survive?
If you said yea then I'mma call you a lie
You see, I don't believe your words
Most people are pussies
Scared to be what God had made them to be

[Hook]
There's someone way up in the sky looking out for all of us
Yeaaaa mmhhmmm, in the upper room
I don't believe in miracles
I do believe in fate, I do believe in destiny

[Verse 2]
This is important, y'all
So please turn it up if you can
I have matured so much, the boy has became a man
Finally I can say I'm feeling proper
No need to worry, I'm a happy new me
Cause I know

[Hook]

Most people are pussies
