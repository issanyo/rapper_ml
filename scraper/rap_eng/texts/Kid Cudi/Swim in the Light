[Hook]
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away

[Verse 1]
Damage control
The same old tricks won't work no more
Smarter, stronger, hmmm
A nigga gon' make it through
What is to do, I've been low enough
Who knew I'd make it out?
Been trapped for too long, I'm out on the way

[Hook]
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
Ey, yeah

[Verse 2]
Calls from the dark
I got hope in my eyes
No help in sight
I'ma swim in the light
She's tryna pull me in
But the same old tricks can't work no more
I'm out on the way

[Hook]
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
Ey, yeah

[Musical breakdown - Harmonizing]

[Outro]
When you're in love
Swim in the light
Swim in your love
Wish me well
Yeah
