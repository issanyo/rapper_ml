Wake up and see just what, what could be
My life as, as good as it ever be, ever be
Close, close my mind, to the outside light
I’m fuck fucked up and I can’t leave, can’t leave

You can’t, can’t be, where I,I be
Follow me and you’ll see and you’ll see
You can’t, can’t see, what I, I see
Follow me and you’ll be free, you’ll be free

So hard to cope it hurt, hurt my hope
My pride deep inside is fading slow
Fall, fall asleep my brain runs at speeds
I’m lost, lost in dreams and reality, reality
Please save me Lord, my life is such a chore
But I, I need this to be ok, be ok

What, what they think of me it ain’t no thing
My heart, heart is broke completely

[Hook]

Take time, and see where I’m at
Take, take, take time and see where I’m at

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

[Hook]
