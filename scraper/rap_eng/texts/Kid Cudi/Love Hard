[Verse 1]
What you gon' say to me?? Hmm??
You want to tell me something??
Let it please be true
Now what you want from me??
Never mind don't say a thing to me
I want to see what's in your eyes
See they never lie
Hmm, well I'll be satisfied. Will you complete my life??
The blueprint of peace, the solution to love. I found you now will you be true??

[Hook]
Oh, if you love soft, then you already lost
But oh, if you love hard
You should let down your guard and follow your heart
Follow your heart
Follow your heart
Follow your heart

[Verse 2]
Now w-what you say to me??
Girl if you get mad at me and we lost our groove
Would you build me up, oh just to break me down
I need me some stability
I need consistency
The way you promise me I promise I'll upgrade your life
It's the blueprint of peace and the solution to love
I can protect you if you protect me too

Yeah. Do you love me?? No wait, tell me do you love me?? Yeah
Love hard
Love hard
Oh if you love hard
Oh if you love hard
