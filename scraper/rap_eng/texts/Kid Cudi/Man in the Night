[Verse 1]
This is the time to be in the moment
Ain't no room for stalling, who gon' live in the moment?
Slip inside the rhythm, let's get 'em
Tell the world this is what I call living
As I ride in my car and I'm blinded by the lights
And we're on a quest, we're running off in the night
Got some girlies in here and we're out for love
No no, don't judge, be my friend, smoke some bud

[Pre-Chorus]
See I sell my hell
Listen to no avail
Don't bother I'm not avail
No marriage, keep the veil

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the night
Yeah, she's great for some fun
Yeah, she's dope for my head
Oh, she's good for me, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh she's good for me yeah
Oh she's good for me
Oh she's good for me

[Verse 2]
This is the time to be in the moment
Ain't no room for stalling, who gon' live in the moment?
Slip inside the rhythm, let's get 'em
Tell the world this is what I call living
As I ride through the stars and I'm blinded by the lights
And we're on a quest, we're running off in the night
Going up from here, and we run from love
No no, don't budge, be my friend, be my friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I have been living in hell
Listen to no avail
Don't bother I'm not avail
No marriage, keep the veil

[Chorus x3]
I'm in love with the night
Yeah, she's great for some fun
Yeah, she's dope for my head
Oh, she's good for me, yeah

Beavis: "That was cool."
Butthead: "That kicks ass."
Beavis: "How come it stopped? How come it's not still going?"
Butthead: "Because it's over. Beavis, this is perhaps the coolest album that has ever been made."
Beavis: "I think you're right Butthead. Come on, come on, let's play that one again."
Butthead: "Yeah, that would rule."
Beavis: "Can we hear more punk rock? I want to break something. Can we hear more of that stuff like that stuff was?"
Butthead: "Hello ladies. Tonight, we bring you the greatest album that has ever been made in the history of man. It is called 'Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven.' Beavis, punk rock is not dead."
Beavis: "It sure isn't. Word to Kurt. Yeah, word, Butthead, word to Kurt."
