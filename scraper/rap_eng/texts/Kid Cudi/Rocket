[Verse 1]
Have you heard the story about the boy who made a rocket?
He had all the things he needed, blueprints and all the science
Gathered all his homies up to form a strong alliance
They're cool and noble men, they're honest, with hearts of lions
They worked together, piece-by-piece, to finish the project
He made it all work, boy's a genius, he kissed his loved ones
And they all climbed aboard it and strapped in
Born to go where no one's gone before
Will they know?

[Hook]
How far can we really go?
How far can we really go?
How do we go?
I'd surely like to know
How far can we really go?

Yeah
[Verse 2]
The boy was saddened yet excited he finished the rocket
He thought of home, the girl who occupied his locket
There was no good, he needed a change, and thus he found it
A place called Earth, blue and green, it was their arrival
The plants, the trees, extraordinary things, great place for science
So overwhelmed by this, he cut off the people who loved him
His mind corrupted, boy transformed into a wizard
All alone, he thinks about the days
He was born to go where no one's gone before
And so he thought

[Hook]
How far can we really go?
How far can we really go?
How do we go?
I'd surely like to know
How far can we really go?

How far can we really go?
