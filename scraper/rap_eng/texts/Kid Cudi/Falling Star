[Intro:]

A falling star fell from your heart
And landed in my eyes
I scream for love
As it tore through them
And now it's left me blind

[Kid Cudi:]

Hmmmmmm, yeah
I'm here, super duper dooder cud
All up in the mix like yeah, nigga what?
Boy, I Stay blazed like Broadus
Even If I never said it
You should probably know this by now
Ta-Dow, what they go and make up
Every time I read about stupid shit they make up
If I ever saw them, black dynamite 'em
Then they'd have a reason to say why they never like them
Ain't no need to seek it
I am content, dream like content
So unconscious, just me and my conscience
I'm runnin' with them wild things
Livin' to do wild things, Cudder

[Outro:]

I live, I live, I live, I live for symphonies
I know that there's some place just right for me
