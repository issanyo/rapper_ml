[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Mmmm, ay-oh
Hey... Ratatat, yeah!
Na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-nah

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling in the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'mma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Hook: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreaming, dreaming?
You don't really know about nothing, nothing
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

[Hook: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shine ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Guitar Solo: Ratatat]

[Hook: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I gon' get it, I'll be good
Oh... oh man, oh, ugh
Room's spinning, room's spinning
Pat, Zuli...
Oh fuck, oh my God
Why'd I drink so much and smoke so much? Oh
Oh, fuck
