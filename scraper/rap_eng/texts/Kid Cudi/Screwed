[Verse]
I've been trying to steer, been trying to steer it right
It's fairly clear how I might be screwed
The end is near, said the end is nearing
It's fairly clear we might be screwed
When life loses appeal, when the ghosts appear
Just a kid in the moonlight, just a kid in the moonlight
Headlights on a deer, headlights on the fear
Just a kid in the moonlight

[Outro: Chords with vocal emphasis]
Rahm, rahm
Rahm, rahm
Rahm, rahm
Rahm, rahm
