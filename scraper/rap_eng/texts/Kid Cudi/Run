[Kid Cudi]
Where you goin'?

[Hook: The Knux]
I said she's gonna run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run (and she's gonna run)
Run run run, that girl's gonna run

[Verse 1: Joey]
(Yo, yo)
She's an actress, know how to dump the rain
Her eyes are timed, like blue fluorescents in front the range
Now that's constructed pain, Major Payne, like Damon Wayans (hoo hoo)
I cut her like Serato 'cause she Fruity Loops
Oh Joey, oh Joey, you the only one like Obi, Kenobi
Can't blame me for your missing daddy's cold feet
But, I must admit you got me hooked like Peter Pan
I'm on to your back just like the man
She said catch me if you can

[Hook: The Knux]
I said she's gonna run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run (and she's gonna run)
Run run run, that girl's gonna run

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Hey girl I know that
You gon' run, but see I know you'll be back, back, back, back
Hey girl I know that
You gon' run, but see they always come back, back, back, back
Nigga like me smoke entirely too much tree and can't be chasin' you, so
Why the fuck you got me over here runnin' up to you
Let's keep it cool baby, let's talk about this
You can look all over though, you'll never find a dick like mine

[Hook: The Knux]
I said she's gonna run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run (and she's gonna run)
Run run run, that girl's gonna run

[Bridge: The Knux]
And she's gonna run
And she's gonna run
And she's gonna run

[Hook: The Knux]
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run (and she's gonna run)
Run run run, that girl's gonna run

[Verse 3: Krispy]
(Hahahaha, this Krispy, yeah)
She say she want to be my friend
But I ain't tryin' to be her friend
I'm just tryin' to be up in her beat like kicks and snares
Well shit, look at the stares when she switched that there, she walkin' away
Believe her, a diva, ask Lauren and Geneva
Geneva? Geneva, I really need to see her
Tell your friend Jalisa, that I been tryin' to reach her
But she don't even care like leave him there
Layin' on your back like weave and hair
Don't even dare

[Hook: The Knux]
I said she's gonna run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run (and she's gonna run)
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run (and she's gonna run)

[Outro: Kid Cudi & (The Knux)]
Hey, that girl's gonna run
Hey, that girl's gonna run
Run run run, that girl's gonna run
Run run run
(And she's gonna run)

[Kid Cudi]
Yeah
Go on baby
Go on
You'll be back
