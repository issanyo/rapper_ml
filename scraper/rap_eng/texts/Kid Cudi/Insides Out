I keep crying
I keep crying inside
I keep dying
I keep dying and
Ooh I'm not afraid
Ooh I'm not afraid
Ooh I'm not afraid
Of the pain
Of the pain
Of the pain
Of the pain
Ooh I'm not afraid
Ooh am I insane?
Ooh I'm not the same
I keep crying
I keep crying inside
I keep dying
I keep dying and
Ooh I'm not afraid
Ooh I'm not afraid
Ooh I'm not afraid
Of the pain
Of the pain
Of the pain
Of the pain
Ooh I'm not afraid
Ooh am I insane?
Ooh I'm not the same
I keep crying
I keep crying inside
I keep dying
I keep dying
