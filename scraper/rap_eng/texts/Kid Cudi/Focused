[Intro - Kid Cudi]
Shawty no joking
And I'm hoping
'Cuz I'm not slowing
Gotta just keep on rolling..

[Hook - Kid Cudi]
I’m joking (young boy moving fast)
And I’m hoping (praying that I don’t crash)
(All I know is) I’m not slowing
Gotta just keep on rolling
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused

Moving fast
And I’m hoping, praying I don’t crash
All I know is I’m not slowing
Gotta just keep on rolling
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused

[Verse 1 - Wale]
Only live once, I'mma live mine up
Fill up the cup, lemme light my blunt
I don't really know what the fuck's in my cup
But a couple shots of it got a nigga on stuck
I'm just here to have a good time
A little white chick, a little white wine..
Out of town, spent a couple nights at TAOs
Smoking weed in the suite 'til we out of towels
And don't bother me, high as shit from my broccoli
Fly as shit for no goddamn reason
And y'all aiite - but y'all not like me
MMG and that's my clique
That's BOA, see that's my set
CDG shit match my kicks
An apostrophe I'm behind that S
Or the black Beemer back to pick me up
Back wood, the tree I’m ashing out
See I be kicking my raps good, with or without sales
I'm killing these blackheads, my rap is Noxema
Light it up for a nigga
One or two hoes ain't enough for a nigga
One or two bottles ain't enough for a nigga
Red Berry everywhere, got Puff getting jealous

[Hook]
I’m joking (young boy moving fast)
And I’m hoping (praying that I don’t crash)

Gotta just keep on rolling
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused

[Verse 2 - Wale]
One night love: I'mma need that
He could own that, shawty, I'mma lease that
I'mma put you in the game where your cleats at
I'mma sign that work and release that
I don't be where the crabs or police at
I just be where the cash and the freaks at
Smoking Green Bay nigga, I'm a cheesehead
In a Lambo, see me where the G's at
$10K in my camos
Word. 10 Js and I can't move
Shades: LV was a little dough
I'm going hard for the days I was piss poor
And go hard cause I feel it's only right to
Maybach. G.O.O.D music: the right move
Girls say everything that I write smooth
Fuck rap, I'm getting pussy off a Haiku
One time for the girls with the right shoes
Fuckin with a dude probably the right move
Two times for the chicks with the right bag
If it's right tonight, I might bite that
3 times, show me your peace sign
Not with your hand girl
Open your knees out!
Look, money what we 'bout
Stuntin when we out
Double M-G - out!
