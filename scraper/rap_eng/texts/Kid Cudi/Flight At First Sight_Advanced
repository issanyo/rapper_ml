Part I: Flight at First Sight

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, I like that
I'm into it (I like that)
She's a hypnotist (I like that)
And I'm on the list (Right on top)
Looks, can't resist
(You can no longer, you can no longer, wait, wait)
Flight at first sight, flight at first sight, flight at first sight
Oh my, my, my, oh my, my, my
(You can no longer, you can no longer, wait, wait)
Mmm, mmm, mmm, I like that
I'm into it, I like that
She's a hypnotist, I like that
And I'm on the list (Right on top)
(You can no longer, you can no longer, wait, wait)
And no she can't resist
Flight at first sight, flight at first sight, flight at first sight
Oh my, my, my, oh my, my, my
(You can no longer, you can no longer, wait, wait)
Mmm, mmm, hm-mm hey

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
One look what it took, one look what it took
One look I was took, one look at this crook
Taking flight at first site, mmm, talking flight at first sight
Flight at first site, mmm, taking flight at first sight
Oh my, my, my
One look what it took, one look what it took
One look I was took, one look at this crook
(You can no longer, you can no longer, wait, wait)
Flight at first site, mmm, talking flight at first sight
Talking light at first site, mmm, taking flight at first sight
Oh my, my, my (You can no longer, you can no longer)
Come with me
