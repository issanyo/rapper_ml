[Song Background]

[Verse 1]
Getting in from the airport
You getting in from the study group
The only thing missing at this point
Is bona fide chillin' time with you
I can't stand the times when I'm alone at night
And I feel your side of the bed and itâ€™s cold
Wide awake, I don't know the time
'Cause I'm too busy texting you on my phone
Saying

[Chorus]
I want you girl, I need your body right here
Won't you teleport to me?
I want you girl, I need your body right here
Won't you teleport to me?
I want you girl
Right here, right here
Won't you teleport to me?
I want you girl
Right here, right here
Won't you teleport to me, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey hey
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey hey

[Verse 2]
You call out to me through the light
I know you must be close
The moment when I realize it's all in my mind
The moment I hate the most
Somebody help me out, does anyone care?
Can anyone hear me? Is there anyone there?
I'm over the loneliness and I can't close my eyes
Without you by my side

[Chorus]
And I want you girl, I need your body right here
Won't you teleport to me?
I want you girl, I need your body right here
Won't you teleport to me?
I want you girl
Right here, right here
Won't you teleport to me?
I want you girl
Right here, right here
Won't you teleport to me, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey hey
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey hey

[Outro]
Hey hey
Teleport to me
Right here
Won't you teleport to me, baby?
