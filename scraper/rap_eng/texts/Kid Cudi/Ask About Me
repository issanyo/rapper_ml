[Hook x2]
Rollin' puffin' indo, roll up all my windows
Wildin' with my kinfolk, for real tho'
Aye it's just chip tha rip and kiddo
It's just chip the rip and kiddo, (yeah)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Dawg it's the weirdo again
I packed my bags back up in the land
Hoes talk down and then shake your hand
Believe me my nigga, supply and demand
I walked that line I learned them ropes
Did my thing I prayed and hoped
Now I'm getting back cuz my thick hoes wanna date
Put no limit just twerkin' and movin'
I stick and probe when I get it in then I might dip fast
If you focused you might cash
But not like Ray so please fall back
Live your life don't focus on money
Hello girl you can call me the moon man
Up above I fly fast anywhere nigga any given time a couple lines
Homeboy I ain't gotta rhyme so nice with it
And I keep that wahoo fitted
Flow was gravy, Bape, beige and navys
Back in high school hoes tried to diss me
Now all I gotta do is sing for a pretty thing
Give me five minutes, she all on my ding-a-ling
Can't live if you ain't about something
Can't talk if you live life frontin'
Boss life from invisible see a model then it's go time
Never handed it so I took mine
I didn't have a watch so I took time
Format it now they gotta jock it
My slim cut jeans haters try to knock it
Now them same mother fuckers keep 501's
10 Deep, bumpin' that slab up

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
I be on that-that-that monster shit
RAWR bitch, lot's of dick
If hoes get to beggin' that front door shall be their consequence
Get up outta here bitch, Cudi got some hoes comin'
And when them hoes come all they talkin' cummin'
Turn pike hustler that'll be I
Pullin' up to your city pretty high
And it's all for the rent, it's all for the fits
The money goes to the kush packs and the cigs
And the music I do it for the hoods and the kids
And the baby mamas who be in the hood with the kids
Do shit for the money fuck a favor
Text the address I'll see you later
M-I-A that's where I'll be
But for now I'mma G-R-I-N-D
Til a nigga caked up ain't worried bout shit
Meantime nigga better worry about Chip
Meantime nigga better worry bout clips
They gone be up in your ass if you talkin' that shit
To the wrong motherfucker from the jungle dog
Niggas out here come and hunt you down
Doors still be wide as a mother fucker
And them 15s be jumpin dog
Mister Don't-Give-A-Fuck is in the place
Louis shades, 700 on my face
Fresh scampi I'm loving that taste
Neva snitch, 12 hundred for the case
Me and Cudi here now what's good
You done fell off like we knew you would
Now I can show you how to be a real nigga be the coldest and still be true to your hood
