[Intro]
Uh
Yeah
Hello
Hey

[Verse]
I be high
When I split a dutch and fill it up
I be high
When I get my money doubled up, I be high
When a model wanna let me cut, I be high
When I'm shinin' cause my diamonds blush, I be low
When a nigga can't get away, I be low
When I can't seem to make a way, I be low
When I can't even feed myself, I be low
When I realize I'm by myself
But I be high
When I'm shopping for expensive clothes
I be high
When I get what I couldn't before, I be high
In the club while I'm poppin bub
I be high
When I'm cruisin, sittin' on them dubs But I be low
At the shows in my dressing room, I be low
When I see that I'm a different dude, I be low
On the plane looking at the sky, I be low
But my highs keep the rhythm tight

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
That's the story of my life

[Verse]
When I gotta get ready for work
I be low
Cause after bills my pockets be hurt
I be low
When I can't take a girl out
I be low
Cause they can't even figure me out
But I be high
When the phony chicks show me love
Cause in my mind I read em' but don't give a fuck
I be high
When a nigga get attention
I be high
When ya girl catch feelings
Then I be low
When I go into the empty space
I be low
When I'm lookin' at a stressed face
I be low
Cause my brother face through hard time
I be low
With my nigga' ridin close behind
Then I'm high
When I know the places we can go
I be high
When I think of what the future hold
I be high
When she ask for my room number
I be high
But my lows keep a nigga' humble


[Hook]
I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
That's the story of my life

[Verse 2]
I was high
When the label said that I was dope
I was high
In my eyes cause I had hope
I was high
When I first had the taste of love
I was high
When I left the city I was from
And I was low
When I had a recent heartbreak
I was low
Cause I truly thought I had a mate
I was low
When I lost her over silliness
I was low
Cause she twisted what my words meant
But I was high
When I finally had the chance to see
Everything that's pretty ain't always good for me
I was high
When she first said I like you
Man I must be too high to even write, dude
And these things show you growth
Some niggas show a little
But I'll show you the most
Highs and lows
And succeed for sho
The only thing left to do is say a toast
Cause...

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
That's the story of my life

[Outro]

Now won't you please save Scotty, Lord?
Won't you please save Scotty?
Help me, please
