[Verse One: Jaden Smith]
Some would say that I was lost
Will someone tell me if I’m lost ‘cause I’m lost
If you saw us, you should see us in the stars
Spitting bars with my dogs, (?)
Fly at all costs
And I’m not one to get involved
I’mma kick it, then I’m off
I'm not slipping in your draws
I don’t care about the laws, I spit bars, get tossed
Joker, I’m a boss
So hit soft, I live soft
Not even from this planet
They won’t understand it till they see me vanish
I put you jokers in panic
You can’t admit it, don’t catch my plane ‘cause it landed
I’m sorry, where are my manners like…
I’mma give you a breath of that nextness
See young prep taking a step ‘cause my chest gets heavy
When you re-rapping except
When you gon’ spit the real ‘cause I’ma give you what's left of
Me and these jokers’ll never finish me
Give ‘em all my imagery
They too caught up in Hennessey
Huh, well I’ll be keeping my dignity
And every time you talking, you jokers never gon’ mention me
But my steeze is 100 degrees
Said he at the school getting D’s
I do it with ease
MSFTS read it on our tees
And we stay up in the palace like you just wouldn’t believe like jeez

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Tell me who’s all ready to go, who’s all ready to go
Higher up, higher up, said higher up
Tell me who’s all ready to go, who’s all ready to go
Higher up, higher up, said higher up

[Verse Two: Jaden Smith]
Uhh
Don’t ain’t nobody know
But my clique cover like ghost
Chilling in the rolls
Scheme falls close and then we expose ya
Wear the same clothes everyday like you supposed to
I’m just a kid who’s not really a kid
And told some really bad fibs
It’s hard to forgive
Man, I’m sorry mom and dad, I’m just tryna live
Tell ‘em buggers if they see me, get out of my business
What is this, MSFTS?
They rich kids
I spit the quickness
I beat you, it’s only physics
You want this stuff
And I live it
I live on the moon, come visit
Your cliché description, I’m sorry dawg, I don’t fit it, I’m different
Dawg I wear dresses this, I’m not upset, you don’t mess with my style
‘Cause this stuff’s aggressive
I keep it reckless
No diamond ring or a necklace
So while you jokers keep hating, I write myself on the set list
I don’t care that I’m not accepted with who you thinking at is cool
Or who be rappin the freshest
Huh, I’ll always just be neglected, dang

[Outro]
Man I make this music for y’all and no one really messes with me like that
But like who needs them, for my republic, I stand, MSFTS over all

[Hook]
