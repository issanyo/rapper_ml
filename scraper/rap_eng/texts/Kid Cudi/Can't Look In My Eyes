[Intro]
Hmmm,mmm,mmm,mmm
FYI, I haven't smoked one ounce of weed today
(That's wild right)
Yeah, I figured that out

[Hook]
People talk shit about me
Deep down they knowing they ain't right
Hmmm, When I walk into the room they can't look in my eyes
When I walk into the room they can't look in my eyes
(You know who the fuck you is)
People talk shit about me and they know that I know
And they also knowing they ain't right
Hmmm, when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
Cause when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I be laughing at you niggas, Taunting you niggas
Who the winner of this shit?
Surrounded by fake niggas and fake bitches
Tryna' get in my ear
What about gold diggers? Yeah, all them
You Tryna get them some gig
Give me coochie from the gooch
Set your sights too low
Hah, you coulda had you some lean
I got someone, na, na
I ain't never met a bitch, ain't a bitch ain't need 10 G's
Hah, I ain't ever met a fool full of somethin' that ain't out for me
Well I know, na,na
One day you'll say, one day you'll see me

[Hook]
People talk shit about me, deep down they knowin' they ain't right
Hmmm, when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
When I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
(You know who the fuck you is)
People talk shit about me and they know that I know
And they also know that they ain't right
Hmmm, when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Rejuvenated, recreated, rebooted, in a new program
Prada calf’s, black skinnies, T and hoody
Y’all niggas know the brand, GQ mustachin’ I’m in LA
Soaking up the sun and I’m laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it’s all because my God above me
But damn I’m feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain’t stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin’ my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated
I got my own empire, I’m the baby
I ain’t taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I’m winnin’ livin’ life, skippin’ grinnin’ on em
All hail King Wizard in the fuckin’ house
Been chill for a minute quiet as a mouse
Now I got the juice, call me Bishop when you see me round
I be showin’ love, showin’ love baby, dap and pound

[Hook]
(WOO)
People talk shit about me
Deep down they knowing they ain't right
Hmmm, When I walk into the room they can't look in my eyes
When I walk into the room they can't look in my eyes
(Know what you did to me baby, you know who the fuck you is)
People talk shit about me and they know that I know
And they also know that they ain't right
Hmmm, when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes
Cause when I walk in the room they can't look in my eyes

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
