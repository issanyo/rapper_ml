Yeah we in the mix
What up London, UK

Saw me with some other girls told her that she's next
She says she wants to hear my songs, holla' at Semtex
Understand I'm different and she listen what I spit
Met her at a club normally that ain't Cudi but
She was the cutest swag was tru-tru-tru-truest
Honest to the call I need 'em all
And she was leaving I had caught her at the door
She told me save I told her wait
I can't believe how she in my brain
Barely know her name
I love her facts, she ain't trippin on the fame
Day n' Nite thang the fools gold chain
The Crookers club banging and Plain Pat what up
So on my roster she was number one up
If the life was Mario she would be a 1-up
And she don't bark when the other girls wanna
Sign autographs then I'm on her ass

I'm done pimping for you
I'm done pimping for you
Cause I'm all about you
I'm done pimping for you
I'm done pimping for you
I'm done pimping for you
Cause I'm all about you
I'm done pimping for you

Wised up, now I'm with a dame
Nice butt, rolling in the Range
Love me even when I'm broke
Stay with me and never let me go
Wised up, now I'm with a dame
Nice butt, rolling in the Range
Love me even when I'm broke
Stay with me and never let me go
