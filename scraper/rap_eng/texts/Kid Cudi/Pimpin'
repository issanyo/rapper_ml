(Verse 1)
It's all cool when they meet Mr. K-I-D
Automatically head in the VIP
Turn it up beats blazing hot as hell
I got the dank put it in the burner roll it well
Smooth skinny nigga left bitch on my arm
Hoes be jealous, they like, nigga who's that ho?
I'm like the law and you're under arrest
You give me some neck and then I'm like you're the best
Straight pimpin'
Serving nut by the quart for the freaky ass hoes
That'll fuck in a Porsche
Clap and ditch 'em
That ho? I never mention (I don't know you)
Til you clap in the kitchen and she making me grits
Not to mention she be loving my hits (I love you Scotty)
Doe taught me some shit I shadow box with the tits
I'mma speak on this to the ones that be shy
If you ain't down with the rules
You can ride, ride, ride

(Chorus)
Cause we pimpin'
Ohhhhhhhhh
We be pimpin'
Ohhhhhhhhh
We be pimpin'
Wanna know why the niggas ride by
Getting high, Cadillac, looking fly nigga
Cause we pimpin'
Ohhhhhhhhh
We be pimpin'
Ohhhhhhhhh
We be pimpin'
Wanna know why the niggas ride by
Getting high, Cadillac, looking fly nigga
Cause we pimpin'

(Verse 2)
Some of these bitches be actin' funny
When I get loot they'll be on my money
If a ho thick I'm caking serving' up blue
In Timberland boots, bitch you're wrong
Be my down asshole, take off the thong
You can sip on some juice if the goose too strong
Cognac and all that, rollin' along
Rubbers in the (?), she know where we're going
She be chill about me cheating but still (be cool)
I'm tryna relax, in ten years I make you one in a mill
I got game bitches love to get
And I never mess a pussy (for sure)
That a nigga didn't have to hit
My gamepoint sick when I fuck with a chick
I never fuck 'em raw, so the cum never drips
I like 'em caramel with some sexy ass lips
Not (?), I'm talking 'bout both sets
And I play it low
I do it [?] juice

(Chorus)
Cause we pimpin'
Ohhhhhhhhh
We be pimpin'
Ohhhhhhhhh
We be pimpin'
Wanna know why the niggas ride by
Getting high, Cadillac, looking fly nigga
Cause we pimpin'
Ohhhhhhhhh
We be pimpin'
Ohhhhhhhhh
We be pimpin'
Wanna know why the niggas ride by
Getting high, Cadillac, looking fly nigga
Cause we pimpin'
