[Hook: Ricky Hil] (x2)
Electric psychedelic shit you listen to
For those of you who don’t do what you suppose to do
And anything that you might be going through
We can keep it moving, just for you

(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
See her, want her
All I got to give her, is this blunt
Hope she like to chill back, grow up
Oooh, this women you love, this women you knew
She chilling with me and we zonin' it out
She liking to tail me, what [-] turn her out
What turn her out, we turn off the light
You can float on
You can float on

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ricky Hil]
Somebody said they were going to take me off my cloud
Now I’m just flying, trying to figure out how, how, how
How could they do that?
You know I’m still on it, you I’m still on it
I’m trying to get back over too
But I know that’s not the point
Smoking joints, I',m smoking joints
No complications, just me and Cudi
And Mary Jane, she’s our little buddy
So fly, and fly
Even if you don’t have wings

[Hook]
