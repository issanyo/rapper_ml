You can run, You can run, but you can't hide...from my love
You can run, You can run, but you can't hide...from my love

You hear me on the radio, coming though so clear in stereo
And you know there is nowhere to go....from my love

You tried to forget about me, but I told you to never doubt me
How's your life right now without me?

(KiD CuDi)

You can run. You can run but you can't hide... from my love
You can run. You can run but you can't hide... from my love

You're tuning me out. Now you're turning me up?
I tried so hard but you just gave up
You're tuning me out. Now you're turning me up?

I'm not mad, pretend you're wrong
You'll come around, yeah I knew it all along
Turn me up?

You see me in the paper. Thought I'd always be a waiter
Got heart for all the haters... cause that's my love...

(Kid Cudi)

I keep it cool babe, you know you talking down yo
I keep it cool with you, you think I'm lying to ya though
I know you love me too, because I love you girl
You talk and dont runï»¿ around, I'm all about you girl
You think I'm cheating with her, nah I'm just talking to the girl
You think I'm running around crazy, no Im bout you word
I'm all in your world baby, we can roll to the moon
You try and call me later, Ima see you soon

Cause You can run. You can run. But you can't hide ....for my love
You can run. You can run. But you can't hide... for my love

You're tuning me out. Now you're turning me up?
I tried so hard but you just gave up
You're tuning me out. Now you're turning me up?

You see me in the paper. Thought I'd always be a waiter
Got heart for all the haters... cause that's my love...

You see us on the TV screen. You scream "Is this really happening?"
It's as real as all our dreams. And so is my love
