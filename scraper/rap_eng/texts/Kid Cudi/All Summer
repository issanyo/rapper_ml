[Intro: Bethany Cosentino]
All year long, we wait for sun
At the beach, we come undone

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Hey, hello world, hello sweet summer Cudder
Ain't nobody rowdy, the cops won't hound me
The women of the women of the Chucks I'm wearin'
They slave through my artistry, can't stop starin'
So nice, Swishers for the roll-up, the grape Cigarillo
Little Mama roll'em good though
Everybody chillin' we ain't worried 'bout shit
Everybody chillin' we ain't worried 'bout a thing
I understand life of the beggar
Lookin' at the ocean, on shrooms is way iller
Callin my mama, tell her not to worry
I'm a man in the wild, and the wild is the best
I digress, this might just be hit or miss
My intentions all summer have certain just been missed
Maintain, they keep my brain 'sane
With a little rage

[Hook: Bethany Cosentino] (x2)
All summer drinking water
Trying to keep your eyes dry
Trying to keep your eyes dry

[Interlude: Bethany Cosentino] (x2)
All year long, we wait for sun
At the beach, we come undone

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi] (x2)
Hey the stars are gone
Everybody come on
Come on, come one, come all
Come one, come all
Come on, come on
[X2]

[Hook: Bethany Cosentino]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Mmm ain't worried bout a thang
Mmm give a damn we ain't worried bout a thang
Ain't worried bout a thang
Ain't worried bout a thang
Everybody good we ain't worried bout a thang
Everybody good we ain't worried bout shit

[Hook: Bethany Cosentino]
