[Intro: N.O.R.E]
I be floatin in the sky
I be floatin in the sky
I be floatin in the sky
I be floatin in the sky
I be floatin in the sky
I be floatin in the sky
I be floatin in the sky
I be floatin in the sky


[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Yea it sounds like charm
Please recognize the shit that we on
[?], my niggas stay gone
Rolling kush, we taking off
Rolling kush, we taking off
Rolling kush, we taking off
Baby, rolling kush we taking off

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E]
Yea, I guess I'm just a different person
Round these kids I try no cursin'
No more n word, try my ninja
I lead turtles call me Splinter
No =PB, but I adventure
Got my spacesuit, I just enter (Woo!)
And I float off gravely, float off in the galaxy
See I won't stop
I am different, you are not
Just one pill and I get spacey
Do my Jay Z, fuck you, pay me
On the flight in the spaceship
From the block on the late shift
See I deal with the greatness and you deal with the fakeness

[Hook: Kid Cudi]

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E]
See I float off, I use my rockets
I be high, Spacely Sprockets
Plug you in just like some sockets
Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Projects
They got hoods up in space too
Aliens, Police, face blue
It's like Total Recall but I don't recall totally
There's no gravity, so I hopefully
Stay high don't come down
If you ain't high don't come 'round
Astronauts, autobots
There's no water, we chew rocks
Women bagging, they're robots
There's no time, no G Shocks
There's no ocean, there's no yachts

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I'm a designated driver
Designated to be high when I'm driving
Suited and booted, ain't no lying
If I'm lying then nigga I'm dying
This what I'm smoking sir, [?] Hawaiian
Don't judge a nigga, you don't know how I go in
Better than the man that's a [?]
Never care about niggas who be smoking behind me man
You be smoking up, you don't give a fuck
See I don't give a fuck man
Give me one puff on billy bong
Smoke strong, smokin' long
No matter how you smoke, smoke it all
These silly hoes bore me
Ceiling to the other room, let em buy the [?]
One shawty passed out slobbing and snoring
Life is a game and nigga I'm scoring

[Hook]
