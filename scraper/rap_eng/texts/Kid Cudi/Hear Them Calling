[Intro]
Stay, RUN
We can help you, WE WON'T HELP YOU
We want you to live, WE WANT YOU TO DIE
We're your friend, WE'RE YOUR ENEMY
We won't leave you, WE WILL DESTROY YOU
We can be trusted, WE CAN'T BE TRUSTED
We'll never let you down, WE'LL LET YOU DOWN
WE'RE ALWAYS HERE!

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it (answer it)
Answer it, (answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it, (answer it)
Answer it (Answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)

[Verse 1: Truth]
It's like I have an angel and devil on each shoulder
The pills I stopped taking didn't help, It's never over
Always cackling and chattering, why is it to me It's happening?!
Try travelling but I end up back with them, I'm not with the average men
No way to escape the voices exploiting my brain
Insane til I rage at a point of joining in their game
Following my leaders til I stop hearing them
Probably a reason but not one here with them
Sweat trickles down my neck when I detect their presence
I'd best listen or instead be left for dead, in essence
That's the only true way that I'd be fully left alone
No one would listen if I shouted it out with a megaphone
So whilst I complain and feel trapped with what they've done to me
They're actually the only thing around that keeps me company
Finally then I am released into freedom
But for a short time til again they're speaking
(and I hear them)

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it (answer it)
Answer it, (answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it, (answer it)
Answer it (Answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)

[Verse 2: Truth]
I turn my head to see writing on the wall
How did it get there, I'm frightened to the core
Telling me, I'd better be, ready for the enemy
Yelling speech, that puts a spell on me, I'm terribly
Ashamed to admit there's a problem to be dealt with
The pain has no limits, I've lost it, have you felt it?
Your soul being touched and tainted, suppose it mustn't be painless
Corrodes your trust in faces, told to look another way which
Ruins your views on everything that used to be true
Approve those who are for you, only to be removed
The resident evil within turns you into a zombie
Just wandering aimlessly with my sanity taken from me
In my mind there's voices filled with hatred
There's a shadow with nothing around to make it
I can run away at the fastest of speeds
But I can't escape all these things cos they're ME
(and still I hear them)

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it (answer it)
Answer it, (answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)
I hear them calling me
Will I answer it, (answer it)
Answer it (Answer it)
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them (run from them)
Run from them, (run from them)
