[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Day and night
I toss and turn
I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace
But see I don't attain
What I need for keeps
This silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet
Keeps attracting me, me
I try to run
But see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first
But surely finish last, last

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner
Seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone
Through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner
Seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner
Seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone
Some things will never change
The lonely loner
Seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Verse 2]
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner
Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move
Can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams
He sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper
You won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants
Don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings
That she had are through, through

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner
Seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone
Through the day and night
The lonely loner
Seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner
Seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone
Some things will never change
The lonely loner
Seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Verse 3]
Slow mo
When the tempo slows up
And creates that new, new
He seems alive
Though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin'
Man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away
He slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip
And then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

[Chorus]
Day and night
The lonely stoner
Seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone
Through the day and night
The lonely loner
Seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner
Seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone
Some things will never change
The lonely loner
Seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night, night
At, at, at night, night

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-na-na, Kid Cudi
Cleveland status, grind all day
Cleveland status, grind all night
Cleveland status, grind all day
Cleveland status, grind all night
