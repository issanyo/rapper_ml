[Song Background]

[Bridge]
No light to guide my way
I'm going blind down the hill
Nothing that no one can say
I'm gonna find my will to live

No light to guide my way
I'm goin' blind down the hill
There's nothing that no one can say
I'm gonna find my will to live

[Hook]
No, I won't brake
No, I won't brake, yaauw

[Bridge]
No light to guide my way
Im' goin blind down the hill
There's nothing that no one can say
Im gonna find my will to live

[Hook]
No, I won't brake, yeaaa
