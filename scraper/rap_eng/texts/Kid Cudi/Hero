[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Burns me down in the soul that I'm riding alone
Yeah, I'm riding alone, yeah
See the sun ducking down and the nights get cold
Yeah, the nights get cold

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Know the truth cannot wait for me
I know I can't slow, Yeah, I know I can't slow
And the future's uncertain
But there's only one way and it's down this road, so
I'm speeding away, away, away

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Things they don't seem to bother me
I've become so numb, I've become so numb, yeah
Disconnecting from the love in me
So far I have come, oh so far I have come

[Hook: Kid Cudi]

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Have no fear of falling
Your destiny's calling

[Verse 3: Skylar Grey]
Oh I be scared of what you find
Dug this grave a thousand times
So much fuel to feed the fire
Push so far and then they die
Have no fear of falling
It won't help you in the end
Dug this grave a thousand times

[Bridge: Skylar Grey] x2
See the sun ducking down and the nights get cold
Yeah, the nights get cold

[Verse 4: Skylar Grey]
In my grave, in my bones
No more pain, lonely way
Where it ends is where it starts
In my hands, in my heart
No more playing, right after dark
You must wait, for your moment

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Burns me down in the soul that I'm riding alone
Yeah, I'm riding alone
Your destiny's calling
I'm speeding away, away, away
Have no fear of falling
