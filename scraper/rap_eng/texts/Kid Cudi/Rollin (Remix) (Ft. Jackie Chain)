Poppin bottles, keep em pouring
How we rolling, V.I.Pin
Its Jackie Chan, who da man?
Everybody know its me
I keep myself surrounded by some dime pieces every night
Tall and short, th-thick and skinny, black and white errtight
K-Keep em coming, Make em secret
If she with it, she can get it
But just wait, gi-give me a minute
Ca-Cause right now the room is spinnin
Pourin Juice, and kick it in
Rollin Blunts, and kick it then
Music bumpin, ain't it somethin
How they get the smiffin beer
Feel the bass, its beatin hard
Against our body, make her horny
Guess she heard, i get them skittles
Thats why she be up all on me
5 huffs of purp, and i still ain't high (Bo-Low)
Ten Pack of pills, half way gone, I'm about to (Throw-Up)
Throwin up, its all good
That just keep my buzz in
On the couch, love it
The way these girls keeps rubbin? ***
Blowing on them sweets, have your boy about to peek
I've been rollin, rollin, rollin and I ain't slept in weeks

Wordd....I can't feel the left side of my face
Stressful thoughts have been replaced
With Henny and coke and Jaeger man
Jackie told me, pump my breaks
I told him pass me somethin to bop
Told me not to smoke my weed
I-I should listen, i can't stop
Grabbin models by the arm
I tell em to fuck with Moon Man
They dont even trip on my aggression
Then you slowly take my hand
Then they open up and say
Do you want to play with me
I-I-I say Baby I'm all up on it
My hotel is down the street
This is kind of how it is
When you living young and fast
Managements player alive
Bitches dancin, shakin ass
Zulu try to pass me the blunt
I told em that Im'ma have to pass
Cause if I decide to smoke it
I-I will go to meener land
With my man, not so bad
Diffefernet from reality
I try and tell my nigga man Melwesky
Hope my mom ain't mad at me
My lifestyle is a wild life with style
And my brain on drugs
I won't stop it till im numb
Tellin myself the night is young
Rollin, rollin, rollin (Young-Yeahh, Yeahh)
We Ain't Slept in Weeks
Rollin, rollin, rollin
We Ain't Slept in Weeks
Rollin, rollin, rollin (Yeah, yeah)
