Yea the man and the myth
The whispers the gossip
Words from a chick
He oh so cute
And he down to earth too

You can call me Moon Man

And I'm just visitin'
No beyond the beats
To lyrics you are listenin'
Everything I am is probably everything they not so

You can call me Moon Man

I have no plan
I just landed here to approach those lames
With the weakest of ears
Stop livin' in fear
Even though shits eerie
No matter the cost
Motha fuckas will hear me
And I will out shine and out rhyme Those lames you don't cut it
Midwest cleveland niggas
Please M-Dub it?

You can call me Moon Man

To the haters who still puzzle
It's okay I'm a dog who still muzzle
But once I'm unleashed like Jet Li
I'm kickin' it

You can call me Moon Man

Like a tribe of questin
Supplyin like a radio hot line request on the radio
Somewhat mentally challenged like Radio
Can't fade me
Like a bad barber
It's new sound it's E pill
Take it at your own risk word to Emile
I don't know B that's the words of Patrick

You can call me Moon Man

Shit it so damn sick
No antibiotic can ever fuckin stop it
If you copped it
Please OD

You can call me Moon Man

If not for me please do it for music
I make immortal songs for the mortals to cruise with
For mortals to live with
Expand they realm
For my people free
Find peace in these
You won't be free
'Till you live on the stars
Shootin' by the moon
I'll be seeing you soon
But for now I'm away steppin'
Put me up in your away message
Word for word I keep rollin' on 'em
Rollin' on 'em
Wha wha wha wha
I keep rollin on 'em rollin' on 'em
I'm rollin' on 'em
Next
