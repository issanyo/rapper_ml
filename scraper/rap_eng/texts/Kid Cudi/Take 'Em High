[Verse 1: K. Sparks]
I’m loose to pin up on a paper, hand it, lend it then I take it just
Chicas caught the vapors, steady ballin’ like the Lakers ‘cause
[?] catch your feelings, all the snitches had this bullet rush
Dealin’ ‘til he killin’, set the militants appealin’ plus
Guess he can, not pressioning, confessionin’, interessionin’
It’s like we goin’ deaf again, working like a Mexican
I’d rather be [?], tuck it in my jeans bitch
Proud to keep a [?], what the fuck you mean bitch?
See I was broke and bummy, never had no hope and money
Took a smoke and took a [?], took it, took it, took it from me
What the fuck you wantin’ from me, ‘cause I got nothing to give
Except my motherfuckin’ life that I live
I got the bank account, but think about, the funds, that’s the positive
As quick as he comes, it’s like as quickly runnin’ out of it
Not proud of it, but get the money, ‘cause son I’m soon to be rich
And give a fuck when apparently still [?]

[Hook: K. Sparks]
Ay yo my mellow my man, my mellow my man
It’s mic check, catch breath with the mic in your hand
Take ‘em high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Ay yo my mellow my man, my mellow my man
It’s mic check, catch breath with the mic in your hand
Take ‘em high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I hear ‘em talkin’, pimpin’, they like who this Cudi nigga
I’m not appear to me, an enemy or what you aim
Now you can tell me nothing, but I will show you something
A picture painting using colors you never seen
And on that TV screen, it’s [?]
Dodgin’ poppers and coppers, we keep the money green
I remember Cleveland nights and ‘bout the nights I couldn’t even walk up on her, even talk to chicks I really like
And I was still the same except my name ringing bells
The girls that hated wanna do me ‘til my balls swell
Or at least ‘til they empty, I see you schemin’ sweety
But honestly I like to entertain the love
And make a nigga feel good, ‘cause of where I’m from
A lotta girls hated decide to come, but models don’t
See this a method to my man [?]
You hear this book rapper’s my [?], significant other
I’m at the all is spittin’, yeah she in love with a brother
I wasn’t near twenty gram, yeah that’s to my brother
Hey, he like to waste some, hate to build a foundation
And why I waitin’ he waitin’, I speak to grillers hatin’ this
And on the fuck y’all need to do right at the moment
Is vibe out with your nigga and take a [?]
And on the fuck y’all need to do right at the moment
Stop baby [?], and pass to fuck a hoe man

[Hook: K. Sparks]
Ay yo my mellow my man, my mellow my man

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Ay yo my mellow my man, my mellow my man
It’s mic check, catch breath with the mic in your hand
Take ‘em high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

[Hook: K. Sparks]
Ay yo my mellow my man, my mellow my man
It’s mic check, catch breath with the mic in your hand
Take ‘em high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Ay yo my mellow my man, my mellow my man
It’s mic check, catch breath with the mic in your hand
