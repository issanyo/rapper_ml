[Hook: Nicole Wray]
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again (hey), do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

[Verse 1: GLC]
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable snowman
Old man, when you trying to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was hit with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And Pachanga so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I've tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger
(Chu'ch)

[Hook: Nicole Wray]
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again (hey), do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Chilling, rolling up something to change my feeling
Thinkin about how I came up from nothing while I’m
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene
Not knowing this was all a set up, secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive, kept pressing on
Nine gripped, thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door, they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it
Won't trust him again

[Hook: Nicole Wray]
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again (hey), do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Cheese came through at 3
Salute, at ease, C had supplied the weed
Cause Ibn had OD'd
It's me with a black rockstar steez
Real rock tees, 300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t know me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heinie with my Jamie-boo besides me
That's my fucking best friend
When I'm tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off, I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught, I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think thats the part I find intriguing, I'm fiending

[Outro: Nicole Wray]
I’ll never do it again, do it again
