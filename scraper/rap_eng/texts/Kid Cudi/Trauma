When I was eleven I saw my dad's corpse
Innocence lost, hanging on the front porch
How do I deal?

When I was eleven I saw my dad's corpse
Innocence lost, hanging on the front porch
How do I deal?
I saw my dad's corpse

When I was fifteen I saw a friend's corpse
Innocence gone, love and a blow torch
How do I deal?
I saw a friend's corpse

When I was fifteen I saw a friend's corpse
Innocence gone, love and a blow torch
How do we deal?
I saw a friend's corpse on the way to school today
