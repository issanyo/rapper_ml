[Hook]
These illusions in my head, ohh (I never wanna leave)
Hallucinating, flying through air, ohh, so long
To the demons in my head, ohh (No more misery)
Hallucinating, flying through air, ohh, so long
Free, free

[Bridge]
And I got it, and I got it, and I got it
And I got it, and I got it, and I got it, yeah
And I got it, and I got it, and I got it
And I got it, and I got it, and I got it, yeah

[Verse 1]
I think I was about 13 (Let's go)
The darkness had me diseased (mhmm)
A young warrior on my own (Own)
But I choose to take control (take control)
They say the light keeps the evil at bay (hmm)
As I coast right through my mind (No guide)
In this beauty far as eyes can see
Lotta shit making sense lately, could it be?

[Hook]
These illusions in my head, ohh (I never wanna leave)
Hallucinating, flying through air, ohh, so long
To the demons in my head, ohh (No more misery)
Hallucinating, flying through air, ohh, all so long
Free, free

[Verse 2]
More, more, more, more, more
Around the age of 23 (Let's go)
Is when I finally heard the frequency
And I've been tuned in the line of grace
Livin' an electric dream (electric dream)
Trippin' in the warmth of the love all around me
I'm trippin' in the warmth of the sun

[Hook]
These illusions in my head, ohh (I never wanna leave)
Hallucinating, flying through air, ohh, so long
To the demons in my head, ohh (No more misery)
Hallucinating, flying through air, ohh, so long
Free, free

[Bridge]
And I got it, and I got it, and I got it
And I got it, and I got it, and I got it, yeah
And I got it, and I got it, and I got it, yeah
And I got it, and I got it, and I got it, yeah
Fly (hm-hm), fly (hm-hm), fly (hm-hm), fly (hm-hm)
Fly (hm-hm), fly (hm-hm), fly (hm-hm)

[Hook]
These illusions in my head, ohh (I never wanna leave)
Hallucinating, flying through air, ohh, so long
To the demons in my head, ohh (No more misery)
Hallucinating, flying through air, ohh, so long
Free, free
