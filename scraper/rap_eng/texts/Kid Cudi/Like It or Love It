[Intro: Kreayshawn]
I got strawberry letter, 27
I got gold bananas
Engraved with my grandmother's
Title signature
What you got?

[Verse 1: Kreayshawn]
I got me a bunch of haters
Got me a bunch of faders, be like "Sayonara, see ya later!"
Jordans on with the 808 drum
And you bitches can’t get none, I’m just so done
Don’t say shit though, say you know?
No one know you, I’m in your city like a mayor, ho
I lead by example, your whole life I dismantle
Don’t tell a soul what we did, just keep it stable
I’m dope, you’re on dope, get it?
Run and get the phone and you can’t call for better
I was on the phone tellin’ bitches that I’m wetter
I killed it once, I killed it twice and, no, I don’t regret it

[Hook: Kreayshawn & (Kid Cudi)] (x4)
(What you doing? Do just what you do)
You like it and then you love it
(Do just what you do) Alright

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Livin' a trip, not really, just lookin’ for clues
I’m so important, that when I buy shoes it's news
Custom Porsches, might make bitches take off they shoes
How could I not? If I didn’t, then I wouldn’t be Scott
Broken-hearted, it slowly rots, I hope she knows that heartache sucks
I’m goin' back up, don’t summon me again 'less you're ready for the pain
Chip, better slap up, when you see me in the box, believe it's Balmain
Mags on mags on mags, I don’t have to push, motherfucker, who's bad?
I don’t give a fuck about much, I’m cool and calm just like my dad
Niggas wanna live like us, niggas wanna floss like us
Fuck a bitch good like us, cool the cartier like us
Cruise all night with me, niggas really in Paris

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kreayshawn]
I be on that power, they be on that powder
All these bitches, yeah, they my bastards
They my bastards, they my bastards
Tell Ron Hubbard 50, I'm like "What the fuck?!"
Outside raining kitties, my doctor know what's up
I be groovin’ last dance, I'm the only one
In the sky high shinin’, beamin' like the fuckin’ sun
Throw my shades on, I'm off on a world tour
Get less but a mind wanna give more
Boom boom for my girls on the dance floor
Pour some for the people, they work hard
Closer than her body, she’s throwin' a big party
She’s inviting Cudi, we beat it ’til its bloody

[Hook]
