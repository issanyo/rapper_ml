[Verse 1]
I fell into, I fell into the thing right there
I went into, I went into a deep dark scare
Come and send me, come and send me(?)
I fell into, I fell into a deep dark scare
And then I had to reach up and grab that hand
Proving I was wrong about the last 8 years
Celebrate me, celebrate me
I fell into, I fell into the thing right there
[Chorus]
And then I fell into the fucking thing right there
And I cannot believe what I call a career
End to end to end to end to end to end to end
End to end to end to end to end to end to end
And then I fell into the fucking thing right there
And I cannot believe what I call a career
End to end to end to end to end to end to end
End to end to end to end to end to end to end
[Verse 2]
I sell to you, I sell to you my deep dark scare
Sheltering myself with that thing right there
It's kinda' cozy, kinda' cozy
I think I can live in this thing right here
Oh no, here comes another peer
Claiming I was wrong in (?)
Wanna' be me, wanna' be me
Sorry there's no room in this thing right here
[Chorus](x4)
And then I fell into the fucking thing right there
And I cannot believe what I call a career
End to end to end to end to end to end to end
End to end to end to end to end to end to end
And then I fell into the fucking thing right there
And I cannot believe what I call a career
End to end to end to end to end to end to end
End to end to end to end to end to end to end
