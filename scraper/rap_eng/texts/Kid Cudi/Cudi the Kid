Let the good times roll
Yeah Let the good time roll
We let the good times roll

When I was a youngin', couldn’t wait to get big
All in all, I stayed on my job, and you can call me Cudi the Kid
When I was a youngin', couldn’t wait to get big
All in all, I stayed on my job, and you can call me Cudi the Kid

Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop

Clap, clap, clap, drinking, drinking, smoking, smoking
That’s my daily routine after rocking shows and ho scopin'
It’s … like the outside of your dreams
And it really truly seems that this's supposed to happen
Even if I'm dreamed up or I'm leaned up or high up
All the damn kids that are listening to Gucci Mane

Can't stop won't stop

When I was a youngin', couldn’t wait to get big
All in all, I stayed on my job, and you can call me Cudi the Kid
When I was a youngin', couldn’t wait to get big
All in all, I stayed on my job, and you can call me Cudi the Kid

Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop
Can’t stop, won’t stop

Can't stop, won't stop
