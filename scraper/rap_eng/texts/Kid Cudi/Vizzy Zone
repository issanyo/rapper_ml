[Verse 1: XV]
Uh, headphones blaring loud, I’m in my zone right now
Got a city on my back that I tow around
Every city that Vizzy got to go around
And oh how I hate it ’cause this scene just makes me jaded
Niggas hating, I can taste it like mmm that’s my favorite
Give me two of those, I been out here doing shows
I remember when I couldn’t even fill the first two rows
I thought I was ‘bout to blow, guess I didn’t go to bed
City of the Lost Boys, they be acting so pretend
Niggas throw their deuces twice ’cause they gon be my foe again
I’m behind that super ten and somehow they know it’s him
How can someone so unsocial be so social?
I’m way too out-of-here to be so local
Mom tries telling me keep your praise on
And you’ll get love at the end like my first name was Faizon
I don’t wanna grow old writing rhymes in crayon
I’m so gone, I’m looking for my house on my way home

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
In my, mind sounds like oooooooh
When I'm, gone it feels like ooooooh
When I zone, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
When I zone, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I forget about it all

[Verse 2: XV]
Yeah, you plan to win when till the score changes
Running round to figure out how to get out your maze
Sometimes I board planes with no destination
You should try and play it, we call it board games
And when you this fly, you don’t think what to fall on
So I roam with no minutes, where do I even call home?
No wonder I left this crazy planet y’all on
Life’s like amusement parks and this is my theme’s song
Don’t forget about Me, Molly Ringwald
I do this for Kansas so you know I'mma bring y’all
Don’t get scared when you see those red trees talk and toys walk
That just means that we are…

[Hook]
