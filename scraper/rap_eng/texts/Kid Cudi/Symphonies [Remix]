[Intro]
Hey Mami (This is for you mama)
Hmmmmmuaaahhhh!
Yeah, chh chh
Mnnah, nah nah
Let's go, Cudder
Hmmmmmuaaahhhh!

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, I'm here
Super duper dooder-cud
All up in the mix like yeah, nigga what!
I stay blazed like Broadus
Even if I never said it you should prolly know this by now
Ta-Dow, what they go and make up
Every time I read a blog, see some shit they make up
If I ever saw them, black dynamite 'em
Then they have a reason to say why they never like him

[Bridge: Dan Black]
As the lights of the cars go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

[Chorus: Dan Black]
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up, Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see-eeee

[Verse 2: Dan Black]
I lie down in the dust just under your eye
A scrap of paper, thin as vapor
Filling my clothes like smoke
A couple of the wires in my heart are broke
I throw, I miss, something, nothing but
Dreams, schemes, moments wasted
Taste that tasted
Fate, I'm fated
Re-edited again then copy pasted, as

[Bridge: Dan Black]
As the lights of the cars go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

[Chorus: Dan Black]
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up, Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see-eeee


[Interlude]
You know...

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I live, I live, I live, I live for symphonies
I know that there's some place just right for me
I live, I live, I live, I live for symphonies
Oooohh, I know that there's some place just right for me
Yeah, I'm in it, ain't no need to seek it
I am content, dream like content
So unconscious, just me and my conscience
I'm running with them wild things
Living to do wild things

[Chorus: Dan Black]
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up, Angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see-eeee


[Outro: Dan Black]
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see (x2)
