[Intro]
Yeah
When you meet me, when you see me
You know how to holla
You know who I am

[Verse 1]
Ix-nay on the bullshit, man
When I roll back to Cleveland
I can't believe them
Sounds of the nonbelievers
Outcast 'til I'm in dirt
Before it did hurt
Now I can overstand how
You could dismiss or front on
Ask me how I
Feel about the ones with closed eyes
My words how I feel exactly are "Fuck that"
I don’t give a damn 'bout nay one hater
Talking down
Don't be afraid at all, y'all
All I ask of all y'all
Is to please –

[Hook]
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me
Me, please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

[Verse 2]
See I must tell you all now
Keep on acting funny
Cool with me
I am here to change that
How you're thinking often
And it's startin'
I am here to show you
How it feels to be new
Look at what I made you
Guide to teach you
Honest but insecure, cool
And you are fooled
By the heavy-heavy amounts of
Malarkey mixed with garbage
I am it, dawg
Don't be afraid at all, y'all
All I ask of all y'all
Is to please –

[Hook]
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me
Me, please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me
Me, please, embrace the martian

[Verse 3]
License to ill
I promise I won't turn the whole world to Cloverfield
On the real, yeah I will
I'll destroy it and then rebuild
Just for thrills
Sometimes you got to do it
Sometimes you show the tough love
No one is above
What you are hearing now, dude
No matter who else included, I'm saluted
I'm saluted (Yeah)
No matter who else included
I'm saluted (Yeah)
I'm saluted

[Bridge]
Oh
Whether you appeal
Or not
This is the real
Real recognize real
You
You are me
Like it or not
And I
I am you
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Hook]
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me
Me, please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me
Me, please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

[Outro]
Oooh
Oooh
And this is how it sounds
In my mind
Ooooh
