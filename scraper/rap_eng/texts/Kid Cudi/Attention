[Hook - cudder]
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn

[Verse 1 – cudder]

It’s been a couple days since I started drinking
It’s been a couple days since I started thinking
Bout You Pal How is you in her arms
I want to do a Die in your arms song
Armstrong I’m strong, I’m a reach the moon
I tell tales of the world in my tunes
I’ll show them one day that this my sacrifice
I’ve got the skills to sing crackles crackling 5
I stand here still waiting for rain
Damn I know this life is so painful yet
Hateful but Graceful
I don’t care adjectives, meanings are fateful
My girl faithful before we broke up
She says we were not right her eyes soaked up
She left me there with my heart broken
No matter if she’s taken I’ve got the tokens

[Hook]
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn

[Verse 2]
Look Here Baby It’s me and Don coda
Low on the border high on the soda
Chuck! Don coda really hot!
Me! I’ve got a kind of cold heart
Shawty still bowling
We ain't rolling
Roll some Change in my cart we ain't holding
We ain't folding we are sold in
We are out of the house
It’s too much cold inside
You see that thing bright
That our ring light
Scary looking down because us at much height
We going to fight because we are fighters
May see us running but we not hiders
We burn it to the ground we lighters
Doubles! Sorry Missed Me because it’s My Turn
They’ll maybe burn you again and again
Hey I think in this lane I’ve been playing Baby

[Hook]
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn

[Verse 3]
Hey Girl Long Time No See
Everyone thought you was dead but me
Trust me, you love me
Everything’s going down like the fluffy music Dub-D Ah!
If haters could reach us we’d be flying
World crying! And Attention this is violence
Hey Man Don’t you see this band is dying
Sorry we couldn’t save it a tick of silence
Homie Lean on me
Trust is love you’ve shown me
Without you I’m feeling lonely
Nobody’s there you are the only
I rap about the winning map
Rap about the fastest lap
Lapping and I’m happy
And I’m happy because I’m rapping
Tapping phone calls
My knees have faced fall
I liked baseball
Now, Attention I hate halls

[Hook]
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn
