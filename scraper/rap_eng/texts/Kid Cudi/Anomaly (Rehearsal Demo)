This is another story, another anomaly
We'll make it gory, the ears will bleed
This is another story of an anomaly
I don't know what's taking long, I'm still taking long
I know they see I'm animal, I am the fear of an animal
I am the fear of an animal, and I like to feed
I am the fear of an animal, I am the fear of an animal
I am the fear of an animal, and I like to feed
I see you make that camera, the goose on the beach
Oh beautiful horror, this is a beautiful horror
This is another story of another anomaly
We'll make it gory, the ears will bleed
Save him, save him, save him, save him
