[Verse 1: Dia Frampton]
Have you ever felt like everybody's watchin'
Waiting for you to lose?
Have you ever felt like you're living in a spotlight
Searching for the real you?
Tell me, have you ever woken up
Just to wish you could close your eyes?
Getting hard to find a friend in a city like this where you can't even trust a smile

[Pre-Chorus: Dia Frampton]
There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you're feeling short of breath
Like the whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

[Hook: Dia Frampton]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

[Verse 2: Dia Frampton]
Have you ever felt love, really really felt love
The kind that could save a life?
But right before you know it, you find out in a moment
You're gonna have to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus: Dia Frampton]
There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you're feeling short of breath
Like the whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

[Hook: Dia Frampton]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Yep, yep, you know
If I can make it through, then you can too
Yep, yep, I'm good
Focus like always
Feels like I've been hit, hit by ten brick walls
Some people like you just sit, sit around and wait for you to fall
Then bounce back way quicker than you fell down
Laugh in their face like "what?"
See nothing can break me
No no no no, listen
If you gotta think twice about life
Somethin' really ain't right
You don't need no help
You could be better all by yourself, yup
You could be better all by yourself, yup
You could be better off all by yourself, yeah
You could be better all by yourself ooh

[Hook: Dia Frampton & (Kid Kudi)]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better
Don't kick the chair (yep, yep, you could be better all by yourself)
It's gonna get better (yep, yep, I'm good)
Don't kick the chair (yep, yep, you could be better all by yourself)
It can only get better (whoa, oh, oh)
