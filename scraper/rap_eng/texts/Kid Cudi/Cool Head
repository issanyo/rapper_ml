This is too fresh

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, yeah
Relax and I'm thinkin'
Did I forget to mention
I'm sittin' on a location
I call it Moon Station
Constructing my best opus
Motherfuckers ain't got no life
No vision, no ambition, no will to do a damn thing
They often spit easy
And talk down on a little nigga shinin'
How is that brotherly?
So menstrual, psychology
Tamponic, stressful, overloaded jealous niggas
I'm in my own world, literally, no bullshit baby

[Hook]
I keep a cool head
I keep a cool head now
I keep a cool head
I keep a cool head

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Ain't nobody trippin', no, I'm cool, relaxed
I keep my mojo on, damn, no turnin' me off
I keep makin' that money, that money, that money, yeah
Keep my mojo on, damn, no turnin' me off
Ain't nobody trippin', no, I'm cool, relaxed
I-I keep my mojo on, damn, no turnin' me off
I keep makin' that money, that money, that money, yeah
I keep my mojo on, damn, no turnin' me off

[Hook 3x]

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
They safe livin'
Hide in their own lies
In their own gaze
In their holes
We see beyond their hate
We see a poor soul
Who hasn't been told
They only know what they've been shown
They safe livin'
Hide in their own lies
In their own gaze
In their holes
We see beyond their hate
We see a poor soul
Who hasn't been told
They only know what they've been shown

[Hook 3x]
