(Verse 1-Cheech Petro)
Life limits Life skies
Hard times Trying to persuade Long lifelines
My Peers Walking around light like life's fine
We poor class we feeding off our parents past
Then the ignorant acting all belligerent
Flaunting pistols on ones that's already limited  
Shit get intimate shells drop in increments
Story of what the prisons dwell on Its no incident
The only thing they got for em is incarceration 
U forced him to sit well force him on some education
F1G Gonna Shock Tha whole entire Nation
Call it Albert Einstein
If you worried about me I tell ya I'm fine Just trying to make a cutout in this crazy outline
My main peace motto: live.Love.Life
Dont misconstrue Yolo you don't live twice. I'm good, I'm good 

(Chorus-Kid Cudi)

(Bridge-Cheech Petro Talking)
You got Nighas doing what the pharmacies are doing but they getting life in prison. Dope Dealers Are doing equal or less than what the pharmacy has made since day 1.Biased Judgments. The Pharmacy System Is Wealthy Off Of Deaths And Dependents.. Just Cause Its Legal Its Right?  Dope Dealers Are Doing The Same And Getting Life! I'm Good my Nigha I'm Good

(Verse 2- Cheech Petro)
Life Limits Life Skies Good Times No Worries just don't kill my vibe
Going against the system pray that I stay alive
But then again we live just to rot and die
They Say 2 wrongs don't make a right diverse cases some let off and some getting life
I tell ya This Freedom Is Everything But Right
I exercise my voice every time I write
Real shit hope u catch the scent and wipe
Real as its gets like a Victim Disrespecting the clique
Nonsense I Kick Game Like The Old Michael Vick
Exuberant Tell The labels this flow up for rent
Words powerful give the microphone a dent
Ooraa all u hear is the ooo'sss an the i'ssssss
Money Come With Good Music man I wanna change lives.
