[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Your funny style, wilding out
Up in the club, you lame
Nigga are you kidding me
You killing me

Your funny style, wilding out
Up in the club, you lame
Nigga are you kidding me
You killing me

[Verse 1: Vado]
I catch you not, flow cold but the kid so hot
Hoes know like who dat kid in that kid robot
Rose gold on the watch, I don't window shop
Try roll through my block, get your window shot
You a lame and I can tell it
To me this rap game like 'caine and I can sell it
I paint pictures, you frame and hangnail it
I been that shit it's a shame you ain't smell it
Yeah, I know, I know they feelin' me
Weight of 34 but them skinny jeans ain't fittin' me
I'm known to build a key
How the customers dealing E
Yeah, the hustler still in me
Just make sure they don't steal from me (please)
If so, what in they killing me?
Let a clip lift up his soul like tryna fit a sneak
You need to strengthen your D, see that shit is weak
Gave a fiend a hit, he ain't even lean or miss a beat
Vado

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Two broads, four doors
Who want war?
Coke we pick up from the Northshore (cause my name is Killa B)
Check it [?], smack you, check your broad
Louie kicks look like a checkerboard (cause I'm 'bout scrilla G)
One in your head, one in your ribs, homebody yo come to the crib (something like facility)
I grip pumps, get dumped, get lump
You little motherfuckers are chipmunks (you dealing with gorillas B)
[?] Your girlfriend
She in a whirlwind, jumped in my pearl Benz (That's why you grilling me)
G5, We fly, fly down
Lennox, yes, we live, homeboy (How she not feeling me)
You lost her, I porsched her, then tossed her, then forced her? (Nah, she went willingly)
Now she left your residence, it's evident. She treat me like the president, so... (Yeah I call her hennessy)
