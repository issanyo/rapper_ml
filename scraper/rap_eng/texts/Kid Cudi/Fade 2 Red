[Verse 1]
Born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
Born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
I got the rage pushing through my veins, listen to me
No one's home, no one's home
I can't cope, empty on hope
No one's home, no one's home
My head is now screaming, I'm stuck with these idiots
Got this rage running through my veins, listen to me

[Bridge]
Undoubtably, no saving me
Undoubtably, no saving me
I've got to bleed, no saving me
I've got to bleed, no saving me
No saving me

[Verse 2]
A warrior hurt, a warrior's pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
A warrior cursed, a warrior's pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
I got the rage running through my veins
No one's home, no one's home
Won't leave a note, won't leave hope
No one's home, no one's home
Oh what a nightmare, I'm done with these idiots
Got this rage pushing through my veins, listen to me

[Outro]
Born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
Nobody's home, nobody's home
That was a warning, don't be an idiot
I will fucking bash in your brain
Listen to me, feel the blood boil in my veins
