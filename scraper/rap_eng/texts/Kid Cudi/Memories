All the crazy shit I did tonight
Those would be the best memories
I just wanna let it go for the night
That would be the best therapy for me
All the crazy shit I did tonight
Those would be the best memories
I just wanna let it go for the night
That would be the best therapy for me

All the crazy shit I did tonight
Those would be the best memories
I just wanna let it go for the night
That would be the best therapy for me
