[Intro]
Alright, run it
I never gave a fuck
I never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me
I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man
You gon' love me, man

[Verse 1]
They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind
Everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be OK to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

[Pre-Hook 1]
But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like a bird sitting high, high

[Hook]
I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon

[Interlude]
It's like, I'mma play all my stuff for everybody
And you know, and all my people they give me feedback
You know, and they'll be like
"Yo, yo, why your shit sound so different?"
You know what I'm saying?
"Why your shit, like on another level--
Why's, why's it sound so different?"
Like that's a bad thing
And I be like
"Why not? Nigga"

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes, hide in the dark
It's a curtain call; come one, come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm something different, all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense

[Pre-Hook 2]
My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
But they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame
I got the last laugh, nigga

[Hook]
I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon
