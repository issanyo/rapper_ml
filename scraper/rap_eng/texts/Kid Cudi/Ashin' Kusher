Doing what I need, hater I am A-Okay
How many times must I tell 'em we don't care what people say
Even if I do somethin' unruly

Off top... Honestly

Find my own rhythm while I'm looking through my Viennas

Then I bounce and they saying I'm absurd
You old jive-ass nigga, look around
Ay, we be around, fam, I'm in the cloud
