[Verse 1]
She looks for comfort in whoever
He has to have someone forever
For all of her nights for all of her days
For all of the wet sex and all of the ways
I hate myself but I wanna fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
The evils want to nix it, it could be working
Or it could be worth it, I think it's worth it
Her love is worth it and ya she knows that
There's levels to this shit and ya knows that
Repent for being bent, repent for being spent
Repent for leaving, repent for leaving dents
I hate myself but I wanna fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
It could be worth it, it could be worth it
Love her, love her, yow, I love her
Oh, Baby,  baby electric eyes piercing through me
She said she not worthy
Oh baby cut it with them lies what you want from me
Oh girl I'm not worthy
No words, no words
She said she's not worthy
No words, no words
Oh girl I'm not worthy

[Verse 2]
She looks for comfort in whoever
He has to have someone forever
For all of her nights for all of her days
For all of the wet sex and all of those ways
I hate myself but I want to fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it

Or it could be worth it, it could be working

Repent for being bent, repent for being spent
Repent for being a dick, repent for leaving dents
