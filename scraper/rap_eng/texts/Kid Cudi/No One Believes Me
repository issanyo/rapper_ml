[Verse]
Have you ever felt
Something evil
Lurking around
The moon is full
The streets are empty
Shadows cover the town
You can't call it
You can't shake the feeling
Quiet do not make a sound
But the wind seems to speak
Something's here in the room with me

[Hook]
I know that something is wrong here
I can feel it but no one believes me
I know that something is strange here
I can sense it but no one believes me

[Hook]
I feel like something is wrong here
I can sense it but no one believes me
I'm not crazy hell no I'm not loony
I'm not insane
Take a second
I heard it
I know it
Whispers say my name
Calling for me
Where do I go
Where should I run
