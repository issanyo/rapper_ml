[Song Background]

[Verse 1]
New York loft to the condo in Chicago
Out in LA I got the house in the hills
Hand out the window feel the wind on my fingertips
Cruisin' cruisin', I'm on my way
Searchin' searchin', I need to find some more of it
New things and new places to go
Fiendin' fiendin', oh I want another hit
It takes me up and I never come down

[Hook]
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh, there's so much I haven't seen
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh, there's so much I haven't seen

[Verse 2]
Hey Momma I'm livin' la vida
No need to worry 'bout your baby no more
I am feelin' the rush, takin' hits up off experience
Floatin' floatin', I am on my way
Searchin' searchin', I need to find some more of it
New things and new places to go
Fiendin' fiendin', oh I want another hit
It takes me up and I never come down

[Hook]
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh, there's so much I haven't seen
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh, there's so much I haven't seen

[Bridge]
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me
I'm OD-in', I'm OD-in', I'm OD-in' off the life
Say it
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me
I'm OD-in', I'm OD-in', I'm OD-in' off the life
Say it
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me
I'm OD-in', I'm OD-in', I'm OD-in' off the life
Say it
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me
I'm OD-in', I'm OD-in', I'm OD-in' off the life
Say it

[Hook]
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh, there's so much I haven't seen
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh, there's so much I haven't seen

[Hook]
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh, there's so much I haven't seen
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh, there's so much I haven't seen
