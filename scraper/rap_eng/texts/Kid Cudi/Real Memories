[Verse 1]
9 beers, 8 shots
7 bitches, 1 spot
6 hoes,4 of those
Are ready to blow
Tonight I suppose
3 joints, 1 ashtray
2 girls, chicks get nasty
1 night gonna hit it tight
And if I have memories I
Ain't do it right, so

[Hook x2]
All the girls that I didn't fuck tonight
Please don't take it personally
All my stoners getting high tonight
Go and buy yourself a sack of weed

[Verse 2]
I know they talkin' mad
So they hide their face like a stocking cap
I'm about to get smashed and trashed
Join me while I bake this hash
A lot of vodka, gone till November
You wouldn't have a good night if you remember
So next time you get fucked, listen up, waste that cup

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I spit game like I gotta problem
Tequila bottle with the worm on the bottom
I wanna meet me a girl or a model
Take her to my room and pop that collar
Come back and get fucked up
Sip that cup, throw it up
Throw it up literally
If you know what's up
You ain't shit to me, bitch
