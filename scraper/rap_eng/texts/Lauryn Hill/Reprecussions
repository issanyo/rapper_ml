[Verse 1]
I was born into this world
A little bitty baby girl
Not looking white, looking so black
In a racist world
Now it's a difficult process
The matter is our perception
When I look in the mirror, what do I see
Is it my reflection

[Hook]
See, repercussions
Talkin bout the things we do
You need to know repercussions
Things can come right back to you
You see repercussions
What goes around comes around
Repercussions

[Verse 2]
See I was born into this world, in another space and time
Time has moved on, and death has grown closer
Surely has blown my mind
Ain't that a bitch, the way the world spins around
Everything everything everything that I said and I did
Surely came back around

[Breakdown]
See, repercussions
Talkin bout the things we do
Repercussions, things sure can come right back to you
Repercussions, what goes around comes around
Repercussions, they will get you down

Repercussions,talkin bout the things we do
Repercussions, things sure can come back to y
You need to know that repercussions, what goes around comes around
Repercussions, they will get you down
