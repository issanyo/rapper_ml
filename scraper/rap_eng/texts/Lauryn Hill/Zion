[Intro]

(Ladies and gentlemen)

Yea
Y'all niggas' still talking?
(Lauryn Hill sample...)
Got something for y'all niggas then
Check me out

[Verse 1: Mike Beatz]

I spit that...
Wonder rhymer shit
Me and my conglomerate
Keep the marijuana lit
All these bitches on our dicks...
Must have had a show or something
Showed her something
Silenced all my haters
Now we fucking and there's no discussion
This flow I'm bussin'
Is robitussin with no concussion
It's fuck the world
So she hold my nuts when she know I'm coming
Balls deep in it... no lie
But niggas' bound to catch you slipping if you ever fall asleep in it
Sophisticated mind...
But still street with it
Strike fear in the hearts of these weak niggas'
Beast mode
All i speak is g-code
The pressure of the game could make you fuck up all your free throws
But me i stay cool, calm n' collected
Newborn with the freshness
Then i move on to the next shit
Never heard my shit you must not got your shit connected
Coming for your spot make sure you got your shit protected

[Chorus]

Turn it up...
Uh
Turn me up some...
Uh

(Lauryn Hill sample...)

Smoke something...


[Verse 2: Mike Beatz]

Back in the day i used to feel i was the chosen one
Now I'm so cold i really feel like I'm the frozen one
So many flows you never know who i just stole it from
Smoking on a pound because my homey came and showed me one
What you niggas' want...?
(nothing)
I'm what you niggas' want
So wussup then
Ask these hoes they say your music make em just dance
I come with all the swagger but i got a lot of substance,
Really?
But really not really
Meek milli when i rap
Boy i really pop wheelies
You gangsters?
Poppin' nine milli's not really
Like molly when i flow
How could you really not feel me?
Sicker than your average
If you really think about it nigga' I'm your daddy...
Ugh...
And all these bitches is my sons
Send em' back to square one
When i hit like snare drum
Uh...

[Chorus]
