[Verse 1: Belly]
Topless shows, Tokyo hoes, heart Sake cold, lock and load
Couple pistols in my Versace robes
My Karachi plug gon' cop it, where the poppies grow
Back on my desperado mariachi flow
Cocky hoes give me top like sloppy joes
The feds watching close, my dog Apache know
Grew up, fucked up shit cold, rocky road
Dreams of killing the Apollo like its Rocky four
38., like a ticket to the pearly gates
Leaning on the wall, tryna' hold the world straight
This the dark side, swallow your fear
Even your shadow won't follow you here
I'm taking, trips to the coast, so my bitches can boast
Paparazzi flicking pictures time to switch up the boat
Chasing fuck boys, no wonder why you bitches is broke
Catching glimpses from your city where its fifty below

[Hook: Starrah]
I heard them say, it's all love
Fake hand shakes then they say it's all love
I know they hate, it's all love
And when you see me don't tell me it's all love
You lost one, it's so silly
How come you say it's all love
You don't really, want none

[Verse 2: Belly]
Smoking loud, put the purple up in the air
Boy I'm a nut, I rap circles around these squares boy
You had the whole thing, but you ain't wanna' share it boy
Now you wanna' hang, I'll be the one to kick your chair boy
Rare form, being real is rare for em
Talking wars you ain't prepared for
I'm sick, these rappers wishing it was airborne
Pray for em', these feelings run deep
Seven day ones with me, not a single one weak
Money man, rubber band was my first bracelet
Trapping out the stove when I'd work late shifts
Before I knew about Versaces's and Hermes's
You never forget the pussy when you first taste it
Mmm peach juice, sweet tooth
Fuck pills, I hit the molly with a tea spoon
Look at this bullshit I come back too
Heard these pussies talking tough, that's cute
Wait, I think I heard it all now
You can't walk around the city, how you say you run the town?

[Hook: Starrah]
I heard them say, it's all love
Fake hand shakes and they say it's all love
I know they hate, it's all love
And when you see me don't tell me it's all love
You lost one, it's so silly
How come you say it's all love
You don't really, want none
I heard them say, it's all love
Fake hand shakes then they say it's all love
I know they hate, it's all love
It's all love

[Outro: The Weeknd]
I heard them say, it's all love
It's all love
I know they hate, it's all love
It's all love
It's so silly, how come
You say it's all love
You don't really, want none
