[Intro]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, what did you really gain from?
What you done done, it's so silly, how come? You just lost one

[Verse 1]
Now, don't you understand, man, universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Satan wasn't made that strong
Tryin' to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now, some might mistake this just for simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now, even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely, you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some, but you just lost one

[Hook] (x4)
You might win some, but you just lost one

[Bridge]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, what did you really gain from?
What you done done, it's so silly, how come? You might win one

[Outro]
Yo, this is the full genius
Refugees, they're about to take you on a journey
Into the dimensions of the Book of Basement
The basements were, uh...
Hey, yo, one, two, three, the crew is called Refugees
And if they come for testin' rap stylin'
Stop the violence and just bring it on
Y-O, hey, yo, one, two, three, the crew is called Refugees
And if they come for testin' rap stylin'
Stop the violence and just bring it on, Y-O
