[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, would it be paradise life?
Relaxin', black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, deranged
Cash, lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better-livin' type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the gold child
Seein' things like I was controllin', click rollin
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress-free
No work release, purple M3s and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

[Hook]
If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be? If you could be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still living for today in these last days and times
