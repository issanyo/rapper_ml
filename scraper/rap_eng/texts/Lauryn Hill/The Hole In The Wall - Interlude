As i sit here at this hole in the wall
Do my best to never let you see my jaw hit the floor
I used to think we'd never meet but now I'm here
Now the only thing I fear is the day I go back home and You don't know no more
But right now, tryna decide if i should of my Mack down
Or play it cool and let you choose
Yea I like how that sound
Too busy fantasizing but the worst part is that yo man here
I Play it cool for you but fucks given, they don't live here
Naw, truth be told I'm not opposed to the idea of us leaving right now to get eloped
They say love is hard to find but when you feel it you know
I say love is hard to keep
You get it, don't let it go
I prolly shouldn't be feeling you like dat
But it seem like everytime I like it go you come right back
And right now you don't know but if I keep this bottled up I may explode
My 2 options; magic carpet ride wit you or be alone
Pay attention as my heart sings along

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say okay
Oh pretty baby
Don't let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, oh baby
Let me love you

I wrote these lyrics, knowing you won't respond
But knowing that you'll hear it will maybe help me move on
And I know we got this distance between us but hear me out
Cuz if you do reply I'd give forever to you now
I often imagine you rappin Eve "Gotta Man"
In a tshirt of mine, line for line without no pants
I wish I could tell you all of the things I feel for you
But for now I bite my tongue
Just hoping that you the one
