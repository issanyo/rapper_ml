Strummin' my pain with his fingers
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
With his words killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
With his words killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singin' my life with his words
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
With his words killing me softly with his song
I said whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, la, la, la, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohla, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
(Yes he was)
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
With his words killing me softly with his song
