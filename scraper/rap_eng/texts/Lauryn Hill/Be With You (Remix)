[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Hey love, hey love
Turn yourself ’round
(Turn yourself ’round)
’Cause I got that brown
You're in love

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
They call me L-Mahogany ’cause of the things that I do
Like disappearing for a week with my crew
Like making sure that all my peoples got loot
Like watching out for Babylon in the blue
They be like why do she rock so fly
On the microphone its do or die
Brothers be like oh my
You don't know what you're missing
Its Fugees and Mary

[Mary]
I can't deal with the fact
That you don't want me around
Why you wanna see me down
It's so unusual
That you don't love me no more
Why you wanna close the door
I spend all my days
And all my nights with you
Just tell me what am I gonna do
Without you
If loving you is so right
Tell me how I make it through the night
You know that I don't ever wanna leave you

[Mary]
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna be with you
Nothing else I'd rather do
(I wanna be with you)
I want to spend my life with you, oh

[Mary]
Let's take this time to think about
What was said and done
Now tell me why you had to run away from me
Now I can't sleep at night
Why we have to fight
Every day from you
I look and I see something new
Now tell me what I got to do, uh
To get this through to you
It's the little things you do for me
That make me very happy
You know that I don't wanna leave you

[Lauryn]
I love you I keep
Put your number in parenthesis
So I can know your borough
You mind if I say hello
We can make it healthy, you know
A strong ghetto love
Cause you met me at the club
Grinding to some reggae dub
That ain't where I wanna be
I need a family
(That's what I need, know what I'm saying, word)
Chastity I'll be if you're looking for a refugee
See my love anoints all your joints in the erogenous points
I make ya tipsy, read you your fortune like a gypsy (Ha)
So lift me to this plateau and don't forget the chateau
Cause you without me just ain't natural

[Mary]
You don't want me there
And it's beginning to make me so scared
(I wanna be with you)
So scared that I might lose you
All I wanna do is be with you baby
Baby, baby, baby
(I wanna be with you)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna pick up the phone
I know if you do, do ooh yeah
(I wanna be with you)
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I wanna be with you)
Oh I wanna be with you
