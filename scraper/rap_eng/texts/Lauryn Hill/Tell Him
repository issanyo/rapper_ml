[Verse 1]
Let me be patient
Let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer, I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
Cause he's all that I got and...
Tell him

[Chorus]
Tell him I need him, tell him
Tell him I love him and it'll be alright
Tell him and it'll be alright, and it'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love, then I am nothing at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love, then I have no happiness
I know i'm imperfect, not without sin
But now that i'm older, all childish things end
And tell him

[Chorus]
Tell him I need him, tell him
Tell him I love him and it'll be alright
Tell him and it'll be alright, and it'll be alright

[Verse 3]
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
Oh... and love is not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything's gonna be alright
Ya, ya, ya, ya..ya

[Bridge]
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on earth
But if I speak wrong, then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared
And tell him..

[Outro]
Tell him I need him, tell him
Tell him I love him and it'll be alright
Tell him and it'll be alright
Tell him I need him, tell him
Tell him I love him and it'll be alright
Tell him and it'll be alright, and it'll be alright
Tell him I need him, tell him
Tell him I love him and it'll be alright
Tell him and it'll be alright, and it'll be alright
