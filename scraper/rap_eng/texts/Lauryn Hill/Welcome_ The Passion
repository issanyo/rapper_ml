[Intro] (x5)
This is Lauryn Hill wit' J. Period, this is The Best of Lauryn Hill

[Verse 1]
If they only owned love, shown love, grown love like this before
If they only knew love, true love too long like this before
If they only gave love, saved love, grave love like this before
If they only called love "love", love called "love" like this before
If they'd only shown love, they own love, own love like this before
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-love-love-la-la-la-la-love
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-love like this before, yeah

[Outro]
This is Lauren Hill wit' J. Period, this is The Best of Lauryn Hill
