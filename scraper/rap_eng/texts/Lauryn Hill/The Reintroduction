[Intro]
Allow me to reintroduce myself
L. Boogie, who you gon' scrimmage like you the champion?
L. Boogie spits with perfect syntax, don't check it
Many styles, style so prestigious, make a sinner act religious
Been lifted, lyrically, I'm gifted
L been this way since creation, put the DJ in it
I'm J.Period, I represent the real hip-hop, I'm J.Period
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Boogie on, yo, (-) Lauryn, yo, (-) Lauryn, yo, Lauryn, (-)

[Outro: Rohan Marley]
Rohan Marley talkin' to you
