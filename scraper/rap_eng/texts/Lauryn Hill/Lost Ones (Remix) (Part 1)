[Intro: Rohan Marley]
Yeah, yeah, yo, Lauryn, allow me to talk 'bout them, you see it?
J. Period, as usual, run that again, that one's hot, from the top

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication lead to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some want play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember, not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My t'ing done made your kingdom want run
Now understand L. Boogie non-violent
But if a thing test me, I run for my gun
Can't take a threat to my newborn son
L been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to bawl over separation
Tarnish my image in the conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage like you the champion?
You might win some, but you just lost one

[Hook: Lauryn Hill] (x4)
You might win some, but you just lost one

[Verse 2 Lauryn Hill]
Now, now, how come your talk turned cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm on Hope Road
Every man want to act like he's exempt
He need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick-talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play me straight, now your whole style bent
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change, then the rain soon come
See, you might win some, but you just lost one

[Hook] (x4)
