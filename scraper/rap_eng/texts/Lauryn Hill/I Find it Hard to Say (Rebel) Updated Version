[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say, that everything is alright
Don't look at me that way, like everything is alright
Cuz my own eyes can see, through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see, is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap, and easy to be wasted
As history repeats, so foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it
His life so incomplete, and nothing can replace it

[Refrain]
And what I got to say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, not today, rebel
And what I got to say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, rebel

[Verse 2]
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it
Your lives so incomplete, and nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say, against these laws of man
Cause like the Bible says: "His blood is on their hands"

[Refrain]
And what I got to say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, not today, rebel
And what I got to say, is rebel
It can't go down this way, rebel

[Outro]
Oh are you, oh are you satisfied
Oh are you, oh are you satisfied
Then rebel, then rebel, then rebel, and rebel
Rebel... ohhh rebel
Then rebel, then rebel, then rebel, then rebel
Stand up and live, stand up and live
Stand up and live, stand up and live
Stand up and live, stand up and live
Stand up and live...
