[Verse 1: D Horton]

Let me tell the story how I met a lil shorty almost 20 I was only like 11 years old
She said excuse me lil homie I know you don't know me but, my name's Nayomi and the world is so cold
And she proceeds to drop a tear, I'm grabbing her hand
She said the saddest part is boy one day will turn into man
Gave me a kiss on the cheek, told me to never raise my hand to girl
That's when I knew that I would never understand the world
The neighbors peeking yeah I'm sure they heard all that
You call her bitch and use ya fist she don't deserve all that
And the problem is
Without the antics and the politics
Bottom line is she a woman like ya momma is

Hypocritical, backwards individual
Bastard wouldn't hit a nigga yet and still he hittin you
I mean whoever knew that he would grow up to be
The same thing that made him cry while he's going to sleep
Open the door and peaked
Fear in his heart he looked
And saw the man that gave him life hit the woman that pushed
Takes a look into the mirror with hatred and shame
To see the man he hates the most be the one he became

Listen women, a gift from god to bear ya children
Be a ear when no one listens
Hold ya hand throughout ya sickness til death do ya part
She do her best to play her she even help do ya part
But you just don't appreciate her
So I'm a write this song and maybe help alleviate her
From the thoughts that she has
Like how he love me more than life yet still he hurt me so bad
And it hurts cause I had, a situation I was facing that reminds me of this
I know this song is getting long but do y'all mind if I vent
Cause these are similar events to a time when I went
Off the edge she was getting on my head and I hate
When people yelling over me and not letting me think
She threw a couple plates, but I was cool cause she missed
And for the record let me say I never called you a bitch
I said you need to stop bitchin
And sure I'll admit
That it wasn't very nice but it was all I could get to come out hell I was frustrated
But it was justified
Cause I was being honest ya homegirl and cousin lied
And it's funny cause the girls that made you drop me are the same girls in my inbox

But that's neither here nor there
Just know that I'm aware
Of motives so no I do not think that it was fair
That you could jump to conclusions without hearing me out
But you busy screaming at me yelling telling me how
"you ain't never gone be shit just like ya father, and you think I'm a sit here like sum lil stupid bitch just like ya mother", and I lost it
I mean I swear a nigga lost it
You done crossed the last line turned around and double crossed it
You gone disrespect my momma, after wrecking my home
When she raised you like a daughter treated you like her own
Body starts to tense
Felt a clinching fist
Swear to God this is it
Tired of this shit

And right as I had started to react out of rage
I remembered what Nayomi told me back in the day
I remembered how my mother cried from not just the pain
But when they all say that they told you it rekindled the shame
So I counted to ten
Went to my room and I prayed
And ask The Lord to give me peace from such a miserable day
He was silent at first
But in my dream He appeared
And said I'm proud of how you handled what could've easily been another tragic situation of when boy hits girl
And told me write a song about it just to show this world
That a flower so delicate deserves not hate
The truth is a woman's love's what makes the world so great

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]

Care for me, care for me!
I know you care for me!
There for me, there for me!
Said you'd be there for me!
Cry for me, cry for me!
You said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me!
Why won't you live for me?
(Repeat 4x)
