(Wyclef Jean)
Wait a second, draw back, ban this here I come
Stick this business, stock me up, they took me coat with a stun gun
On a Sunday, a bloody Sunday, so what's the resume?
Heads got felt in the force I heard a Milky Way
I caught a heart attack when I heard my cousin (???)
In Avenue D. in Brooklyn New York City
Ever since I used my man I moved to Jersey
But realistically, God, could of called me early
Cause I got a big bop I'm wanted by the block
I take a ruff-neck chicken make stop in stone top
Cause I roll with the army of sixty-eight
The Privates' don't make the orders it's the General that makes the wig-wack
Buy her back, buy a cat, I got scratched in a day to kidnap
And at night I was back and the Jeep got attacked by a gang that sold crack
But the posse was strapped it was nothin' but CRAP!!
I got cuffed in the back, in the jail there were rats
So I pulled out my mack to get out of this crap
Though I wish I could zap outta here but I quack like a dog
That pass gats so I put the gas mask on the mic
There were blasts cause I do it it's my task
And all the jumper the guys that I see to me pass the class
Check out the vocab it don't got nothin' to do with the gift of gab
If you're good you're good if you're bad you're bad

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)

(Pras)
One, two (ONE, TWO), three, four (THREE, FOUR)
Hardcore (HARDCORE), hardcore (HARDCORE)
Yo, watch yourself for your health I'll snatch your last breath
Then I left you up for another one bites the dust
You couldn't ride me if you went behind the bush, gush
Leave the style alone, don't try to follow me
Cause a life of the hood make it a little triggery
So keep your eyes on the prize, don't be surprised
Cause on my half I may pull out a semi-automatic sixty-eight
Watch around my back it's mainly static
Droppin' emcees like a bad habit
Here come the Pras with a new package

(Wyclef Jean)
Mad and they ignorance, think they can test the performance of an ancient (RAPPER!!)
Let me break it down in a dialect (BADDER!!)
Easier said than what the mono said
Cause there's more than righter rapper, paid for the rapper be-bop
Cause he said everybody's rappin', them and they momma
So when I grab the mic I grab it like a gangster
Microphone sniper cause it'll be the prowler
Launch it, it's trife, no magic, the realistic maggot
Don't leave the gadget or you'll be gat it
Simple - the riddle, who's the monkey in the middle
What's the goose - um!
So let me cut his neck loose yo
I keep it positive and not so negative
These is when you diss, emcees take it
So send it to they call the battle
I'mma raw I let it rappin' now I'm more
Your ball, you're waitin' for me to fall, but I won't, ssss...

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)

(Lauryn Hill)
I gotta jump on the A-Train, I saw cat with a scat he was blowin' like coal-train
My boys' said give him a call, I gave him a dollar, he said are you a rapper?
Kids have a seat and don't miss a beat and listen to the battle of the saxin' in your emcee

(Wyclef Jean)
Now Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock call
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me baby)

(Lauryn Hill)
I rock and shock the dough is show squeeze and cheese and whether pleasin'
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me baby)
I rock and shock the dough is show squeeze and cheese and whether pleasin'
Coolin' breezin' at the teas and how can emcees do was sneeze
(FLOWER, BLOW!!)

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it?...
