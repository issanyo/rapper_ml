[Intro]
Yo, what up? This is Nas with the official (-), J. Period
"If I Ruled the World" was originally a Kurtis Blow record
You know? Somebody who I love and saw him in crèche school
And his song wit' "These are the breaks"...
I used to breakdance to his music, you hear what I'm sayin'?
So "If I Ruled the World" was a tribute to him
And also speakin' out to the world
And, um, I used to work wit' the Fugees on tour
And, you know, they would open up for me wit' our first albums
And our second albums, it flipped
And he sold, like, you know, thirty million albums
And I'm — now I'm openin' up for them
So, um, we was — we was cool like that
And, you know, Lauryn came and got on the record
Who I felt was — would make the record even more incredible
Me and her, I really appreciate her work
And, um, and talked to her well
You know, not just my projects, but every projects in December
Everywhere in the world
So I thought that would be the perfect record

[Outro]
If I ruled the world
Still living for today in these last days and times
