[Intro]
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence
So you monogamous but body positive
Post pills you swallowing, for a following
What he got to offer? He don't see the kids that he fathering
If you don't bother then, why you responding then?
Careful where you plant them seeds, before you water them
Say you empower women, ay
But don't acknowledge them
Feminism not what you embodyin'
You false hope, you false positive, uh
But eat your fruit and drink your water then
Uh, I don't clique up, I don't clique up, nah
I don't clique up, I don't clique up, that's why
I don't clique up, I don't clique up, hey
I don't click up
I don't clique up 'cause you're a kiss up
Rep your set, they all switch up, then don't pick up
But real friends don't ask for favors
Say you betray like you supposed to pay 'em
Copped the White House like you supposed to save 'em
Ungrateful, wonder how I Kanye'd 'em, han
It's pressure to be an icon baby, han
Stressin' to be an icon lately but-

[Chorus]
A lost soul can't lead the people, no
A lost soul can't lead the people, nah
A lost soul can't lead the people, no
A lost soul can't lead the people, uh

[Verse 2]
Confusing the celebrity with your integrity
You drinkin' Hennessy for your therapy
Can't get no peace of mind, can't get no serenity
But the public ain't the enemy it's the inner me so, uh
What you gonna leave with your legacy, uh?
It's like we don't believe in longevity, uh
I was overseas and seems that we the only people with dreams of material things
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence, yeah
We lying to ourself that's what the problem is, no

[Outro]
A lost soul can't lead the people, no
A lost soul can't lead the people, no, no
A lost soul can't lead the people, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
A lost soul can't, lost soul
Can't lead, can't lead
