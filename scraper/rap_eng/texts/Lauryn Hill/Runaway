Verse 1:
Unwind at the end of the day
Clearing up the airway
Put my thoughts on delay
Sorry I'm just now seeing your message
My phone has been on DND all day
I'm so serious
When I say ain't nothing much change

Hook:
Phases and changes is all
Things aren't the  same when they fall
When they fall I don't usually call
I don't say much at all

Verse 2:
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
When all I do, all I do is runaway
Look for escapes

Hook:
Phases and changes is all
Things aren't the  same when they fall
When they fall I don't usually call
I don't say much at all
