[Verse I]
It was never my intention to hurt you or make you cry
Did everything to bring my walls down, everything short of pry
For me to open up I would have to swallow my pride
But I pride myself on not being type of nigga that cry
For me to open up another part would have to die
The guy that got all of the girls so he could sleep better at night
Damn, we're wide awake with our clothes off
And you hate it that I'm closed off

[Chorus]
See the road to hell, is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out, such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional

[Verse II]
Unfair to ask an angel to put up with all my demons
The little that you asked you always had to repeat it
Every day I feel like I need ya, but if you want to leave I ain't gon chase you down to keep ya
So I try and forget you but I still ain't got amnesia
Some memories fade but my hearts still eager
I'm alone in my room, stare at the wall
Wondering how the fuck this even happened at all
Said I would never slip then she got me to fall
And that was way before I even got in them draws
My heart was the coldest and she got it to thaw
And I was warming up she headed right for the door

[Chorus]
See the road to hell, is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out, such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional
