[Verse 1]
Let me be patient let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer, I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
Cause she's all that I got and tell her

[Chorus]
Tell her I need her
Tell her I love her
And it'll be alright
Tell her tell her I need her
Tell her I love her
It'll be alright

[Verse 2]
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
No and love is not loud
Tell her I need her, tell her I love her
Everything's gonna be alright
