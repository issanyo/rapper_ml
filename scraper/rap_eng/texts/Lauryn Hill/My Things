[Hook]
I know, I know i better watch out
These girls, these girls are only about
My things, my things, my things
My things, my things, my things

[Verse]
Dont fuck with my things, just dont fuck with me period
I've got way people tryna take me too serious
Being shameful when they the ones who be acting
Gotta be blameful for all the rules they be snapping
Taking the shade when its thrown the other way
They be bending the truth its the real who setting it straight
Fuck being clique
Im just sticking to my own shit
See im the victim but still im the fucking culprit
How many retry's till you get the message
How many niggas do you have to fuck
With till you stop stressing
I keep telling you, i keep telling you
Its gonna be so much worse for you
But i keep going
Fuck stalling, my music has always been flowing
Just more niggas know it now
OVO want this sound
But i can't hand it over to quick, im only 12 bars in
And im still fucking with niggas with higher budgets
Going bigger than drake until i fucking summit
My tail keeps buzzing
Music is buzzing, fuck tryna catch loving
If shawey gonna come over shell come over
I ain't stressing bout her, well i ain't stressing bout her
But its props down to fa
Scotland finally on the map now, like wondering what he'd say
I've got bigger chances, bigger opportunities
I've got bigger women with bigger properties, bigger niggas
Finally getting it now, and its crazy now
Women feel the need to crave on a nigga now
And i dont see it now
Im the same fucking nigga that was tryna clown
And im gonna be the same nigga when im found
Check it, check it
Im gonna be the same fucking nigga when im found
Im gonna be the same fucking nigga when im found

[Hook]
I know, I know i better watch out
These girls, these girls are only about
My things, my things, my things
My things, my things, my things
