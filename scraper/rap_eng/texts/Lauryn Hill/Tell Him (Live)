[Verse 1]
Let me be patient, let me be kind
Make me unselfish without bein' blind
Though I may suffer, I'll envy it not
And endure what comes, 'cause he's all that I got and tell him

[Chorus]
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
And it'll be alright
And tell him
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Now I may have faith, to make mountains fall
But if I lack love, then I am nothin' at all
If I can give away, everything I possess
But I'm without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect and not without sin
But now that I'm older all childish things end and tell him

[Chorus]
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him and
It'll be alright
Tell him
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

[Verse 3]
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
'Cause love is not boastful
Ooh, and love is not loud

[Chorus]
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything is gonna, gonna be alright
Ooh
Ooh

[Bridge]
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on earth
But if I speak wrong, ooh, then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared and tell him

[Chorus]
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him and
It'll be alright
Tell him
It'll be alright
It'll be alright and
Tell him
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
Ooh
