Got work in the morning I’m
Too gone to even care I’m
Too busy trynna pick out something
Short and tight to wear I
Told my roommate don’t wait up cause
I’m a be out late
Hair and makeup all done up but
Won’t end the night that way I
Know he want my body I know
He don’t know my name I know
He don’t know I got a dick I know
But his mind ain’t gonna change once he know
I’m a work his body
He gon blow my mind
These niggas for everybody
That nigga ain’t mine

Girls you know you better
Girls girls you better better
Watch out
Girls you know you better

Watch out
That thing that thing

Said I’m talking about a thing
That keeps you running back
You can say you love it
But just tell me does it love you back?
Tell me is it something?
Cause that nothing had enough of that
Know you need to cut it
Need to cut it like a lumberjack
Tell me is it real?
Or just in my dreams
I know you deal
A couple of drinks
I know how you feel
Adjust to the wind
Trust in the breeze
You jumping for the love of that thing
Tell me is it worth it now
We light it just to burn it down
You get excited to work it out
Used to be on fire now it’s quiet
We lying how it’s turning out
I said you tired and you tryin
But you turn it down
You don’t wanna hear it
You feel it in the air now
You don’t wanna clear it
Only thing you care about
Want it when you near it
Talking bout that thing
We love it and we fear it

Girls you know you better
Girls girls you better better watch out
Girls you know you better
Girls girls you better better watch out
That thing that thing
That thing that thing
That thing that thing
That thing that thing

So I told him baby
Hold up on it
I’m a G when I drop it
Watch me roll up on it
And I get em so sick man
I have him calling me Drea and Sdot
With an accent
Like a Brisbane
And watch the kid switch it up
Cause everywhere I go
It’s fireworks like my neck
When it’s glistened up
Everybody know the queen
Yes it’s facts
If I want it I’m a get it
And I won’t hold back
I’m a make it rain down
Like my name three stacks
I’m an introverted extrovert
But not outcast
Full package
I’m inclusive man
I like my man to be a king
Rare breed and exclusive man
And yes babe
I got it like that
Put my lips on your lips
And get it poppin like that
I’m not saying I’m the best
But really I’m the best
Even if I let him go
Guarantee he coming back
Sdot
