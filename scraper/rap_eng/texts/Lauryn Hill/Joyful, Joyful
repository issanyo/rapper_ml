[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Joyful, joyful, Lord, we adore Thee
God of Glory, Lord of Love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Clearly as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light
Fill us with the light
Oh, fill us with the light of day

[Hook: St. Francis Choir]
Joyful, joyful, Lord we adore Thee
God of Glory, Lord of Love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Clearly as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin, sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away, drive it away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us, fill us with the light of day
Light of day

[Rapper 1]
Check the rhyme
Joyful, Joyful, Lord we adore Thee
An' in my life, I put none before Thee
Cuz since I was a youngster, I came to know
That you was the only way to go

[Verse: Rapper 2 (St. Francis Choir)]
So I had to grow an' come to an understandin'
That I'm down with the King so now I'm demandin'
That you tell me who you down with, see
Cause all I know is that I'm down with G-O-D

You down with G-O-D? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with G-O-D? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with G-O-D? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with G-O-D? (Everybody)

[Choir Members]
Come and join the chorus
The mighty, mighty chorus
Which the morning star begun
The Father of love is reigning over us

[Lauryn Hill]
By the way

[Choir]
What have you done for Him lately?
Ooh, ooh, ooh yeah
What have you done for Him lately?

He watches over everything
So we sing

[Chorus]
Joyful, Joyful, Lord, we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Hail Thee as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin, sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away, drive it away
Giver of immortal gladness
Won't you [Lauryn Hill]
