[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
You know, love is an incredible thing and we don't know love like we should
We always talk about we have unconditional love
Unconditional love is- We don't even know it
Because if a person stops stimulating us, we stop loving them
You're not interested in talkin' to 'em anymore, "goodbye!"
But that real love, that love that sometimes is difficult, difficult to have, that's that love, and that's the confidence building

[Chorus: G-Haze]
I have some time and I've been thinkin' lately
Are we good or are we slowly fadin'
You did some things to me that's extra shady
I'm not puttin' no living, no longer can I take it
Unanswered prayers, God can you save me?
I've been praying and lately I've been patiently waiting
And I don't want no conversation
And I'm cuttin' off communication

[Verse 1: Millz Davis]
You blame me, why that and put it on my back?
First off, it's not my bad
You let it reach to a peak like a climax
You broke [?] into me like it's [?]
I can't believe I let you get me sidetrack
You did me wrong three times, try it
What's love? Bypass
If you don't wanna know then don't ask
Don't kiss my ass
The time went by so fast that it tzoom'd on a nigga like time lapse
How can a nigga get the time back?
A nigga won't ever get the time back
So I left this on a deathbed to die flat
Yeah

[Chorus: G-Haze]
You've been talkin' and I heard you hate me
And you've been sayin' things that type of crazy
'Cause now it's over and I'm done with you
And now it's over and I'm done with you

[Bridge: Dez]
Yeah
Done with you, yeah
I'm done with you, girl
I'm done with you
I'm done with you, girl
I'm done with you, girl
I'm done with you, girl
I'm done with you, girl
I'm done with you, oh
I'm done with you, girl

[Chorus: G-Haze]
You've been talkin' and I heard you hate me
And you've been sayin' things that type of crazy
'Cause now it's over and I'm done with you
And now it's over and I'm done with you
