Lauryn:
Oh Pirates yes they rob I
Stole I from the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Allmighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption Songs (x3)

Ziggy & Lauryn:
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
But we've got to fulfill the book

Won't you help us sing
Another song of freedom
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption Song (x3)

Lauryn:
Yo, If they can stop this fruit
They would pop this route
Chop this fruit
Treat us like a prostitute
Knock this youth
See me in my cocky suit
God's recruit
From fallin even God's salute
Tribal truth
Ja people can't be mute
Share my youth to Babylon can't regroup
Sing, to Babylon can't regroup
Sing, to Babylon can't regroup

Lauryn & Ziggy:
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

Won't you help to sing
Another song of freedom, yeah
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption song (x 5)
