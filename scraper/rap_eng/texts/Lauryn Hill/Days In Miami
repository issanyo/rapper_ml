[Spoken Intro:Lauryn Hill]

[Verse 1]
Chynna just hit my line, yea
Asking how I'm doing, man I'm doing fine
Before days like this you ain't wanna be mine
Scared to explore love with me cause of what you might find
Not acknowledging that all your friends made you change your mind
Telling you I'm a hoe and not to waste your time
Looks never mattered cause to me you was always a dime
If being real witchu was the only thing I did, I ain't know honesty was a crime
And I ain't know you would switch
I thought I had real bitxh, but you the opposite
I showed you a thrown but you wasn't fit
To sit where a queen a sit, I guess I'm the dick
And I guess you the joker
I guess love is like poker
Never show your hand or tell em where you stand
Gotta keep them guessing until you understand
They true intentions
I learned to never judge a book by its cover and a bitch by the first impression
So don't ask me about my love life
And don't ask me if Ima that bitch my wife
Csuse these bitxhes is trife
And they reason niggas loosing they life
Pillowtalking is the deadliest weapon
She ask me what I do I had to avoid the question
When there's money to be made, I got no time to be laid
Don't get mad you got played, I'm just enjoying the game
You love me no matter what is your number one claim
But if got hit with some time would you love me the same
And if it's really real go ahead and tat my name
And if it's really real you shouldn't have no shame
Days in Miami, I had to get away
From the so called bros, and fake bitches calling me babe
The people who talk the realest shit turn out to be fake
And I thought I had a pack of lions turns out these nighas snakes
Days in Miami, I had to take break
I may crack the exterior, but I never break
I haven't slept in years, so to me it's never late
Never to late but if she wanna leave I'll never tell her wait
