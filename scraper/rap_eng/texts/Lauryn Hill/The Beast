Want to ha ha ha, oh oh

[Hook]
Warn the town the beast is loose (ah ah)
Word 'em up y'all
Warn the town the beast is loose (ah ah)
Word 'em up y'all (come on)

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Conflicts with night sticks
Illegal sales districts
Hand-picked lunatics, keep poli-TRICK-cians rich
Heretics push narcotics amidst its risks and frisks
Cool cliques throw bricks but seldom hit targets
Private-DIC sell hits, like porno-flicks do chicks
The 666 cut W.I.C. like Newt Gingrich SUCKS DICK

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Meanwhile the government brings Star Wars from Glocks to glockers
C.O.P. has an APB out on Chewbacca
Mista Mayor, can I say something in yo honor
Yesterday in Central Park they got the Jogger
Okay, okay
Let's get the confusion straight in ghetto Gotham
The man behind the mask you thought was Batman is Bill Clinton
Who soon retire, the roof is on fire
Connie Chung brung the bomb as it comes from Oklahoma
Things are getting serious, Kuumbaya
On a mountain Satan offered me, Manhattan help me Jah Jah
I can't sleep at night
You can't search me without probable cause
Or that proper ammunition they call reasonable suspicion
Listen I bring friction to your whole jurisdiction
You planted seeds in my seat when I wasn't lookin
Now you ask me for my license registration
"WHERE THE FUCK" do I work
"WHAT THE FUCK" is my occupation
Well I'm an MC, I'm down with the Fugees
Mother Mary caught a flashback like Rodney now the cops got Lolly

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
The subconscious psychology that you use against me
If I lose control will send me to the penitentiary
Such as Alcatraz, or shot up like el Hajj Malik Shabazz
High class get bypassed while my ass gets harassed
And the fuzz treat bruh's like they manhood never was
And if you too powerful, you get bugged like Peter Tosh and Marley was
And my word does nothing against the Feds
So my eyes stay red as I chase crazy bald heads,word up!

[Hook]
Warn the town the beast is loose (ah ah)
Word 'em up y'all
Warn the town the beast is loose (ah ah)
Word 'em up y'all (Luz)

[Verse 4: Wyclef Jean]
The chase is on I feel like the bad guy
Fifth gear 125 like New Jersey Drive
Looked in my rear view mirror
Police was getting closer
Heard a roar in the sky
Looked up and saw the Blue Thunder
My inner conscious says throw your handkerchief and surrender
BUT TO WHO???
The star spangled banner ooh
Say can't you see cops more crooked than we
By the dawn's early night robbin' niggas for kis
Easy low key crooked military
Pay taxes out my ass but they still harrass me
Nigga

[Verse 5: Pras]
The streets of corruption got me bustin and cussin' in the Concrete Jungle
Thoughts being dribbled like that tall kid Mutumbo
Handled by Hannibal
Soon I'm gonna be a fugitive like Dr. Kimble
(Ay yo should I slow down?)
Nah kid go faster (yeah)
Just cause they got a badge, they could still be impostors
Probable cause, got flaws like dirty draws
Meet me at the corner store so we can start the street wars
Aaah
Were to marl ya'll

[Hook]
Warn the town the beast is loose (ah ah)
I can't sleep at night
Word 'em up y'all (come on)
Warn the town the beast is loose (ah ah)
Word 'em up y'all (come on)
