[Intro]
Fearless Vampire Killer
I am a Fearless Vampire Killer
I am a Fearless Vampire Killer
I am a Fearless Vampire Killer

[Verse]
Watch yourself up in the realm
Watch yourself up in the front
You didn't come up with nothing
These are fuckin' liars
Holes in your pocket, and
Now you're a department store buyer
Put some more leaves on the fire
You're not the wheat you're just the chaff
Your whole operation makes me laugh
No Class
You never had money now your whole Op's about cash
Come on find a new topic
You got kids in the street listening to this SHIT
You going to kill them just to make a profit
You're real short term
You don't see the big picture
Just look at the news
I don't need to quote scripture
At you, but I can do that to
Bad boys what you going to do when the come for you
I don't mean the Coppers (Cops)
I mean the Tormentors
A little ackward
They going to pop you in a padded lock
You know you had it coming

[Chorus]
Where you gonna go now? What you gonna do now? Where you gonna go now? What you gonna do now? Where you gonna go now?
