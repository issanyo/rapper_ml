[Verse 1]
What is freedom but a fleeting notion
Is this reality or just emotion
I would rather be a giver then
Be apart of hurting you again

[Chorus 1]
I want to be conformed to love, show me what to do again
Show me to win your love
I want to be conformed to love
So I can perform love

[Verse 2]
My impatience is the part of me
That I realize you hate you say
It complicates the very art of you
Show me what ought to do
I want to be comformed to love
So I can perform love

[Chorus 2]
My Beloved is the greatest Love, yes!
I think of him all the time
My beloved is the greatest love
Please make up my mind
I want to be conformed to love
So I can make more love
I want to be pure pure love
So I can restore love
So I can make more love
So I can be sure love
Help me be secure love
So I can make more love
So I can restore love

[Outro: Talking]
That is the objective, to be conformed to love, to actually be love incarnate
Because that is what I was before, but ya'll got that I think
To be love incarnate, and to not listen to people who might say there's something wrong with being love, you know. I'll give you an example:

You talked about professionalism
But what does professionalism have to do with a real exchange
You are as professional as you have to be right now
You are as professional as you need to be
Your sincerity has offended me in any way
It hasn't confused or complicated things
If anything it's broken down and made the environment more comfortable for everyone else
What did it do, what was the cost of your lack of professionalsim, your so called lack of professionalism, because I don't call it that
I believe a world can exist on honesty, I just do, you know. I'm a believer
