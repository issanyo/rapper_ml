[Verse 1]
Black is the color of my true love's hair
His face so soft and wondrous fair
The purest eyes and the strongest hands
I love the ground on where he stands
I love the ground on where he stands

[Chorus]
Black is the color of my true love's hair

[Verse 2]
I love my lover and well he knows
Yes I love the ground on where he goes
Yes I love the ground on where he goes
And still I hope that the time will come
When he and I will be as one
When he and I will be as one

[Chorus]
So black is the color of my true love's hair

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh I love my lover and well he knows
Yes I love the ground on where he goes
Oh yes I love the ground on where he goes
And still I hope that the time will come
When he and I will be as one
When he and I will be as one

[Chorus]
So black is the color of my true love's hair
