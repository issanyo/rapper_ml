[Intro: Terrance Moore]
Retro Nuveaux

[Verse 1]
If I get a deal, will it make me less real?
Will I spend a couple mill. to live in Hollywood Hills?
Fuck a chick who's never seen the gritty side of life
I'ma need a wife who knows reality from what they write
I'm hoping, I could become the new Paul Robeson
Chosen, for rapping, directing, acting and toking
Spokesman for people who don't have their equal votes in
Braggadocio, but I know how my dough spend
What's Balmain, if you can't ball man?
What's gold standards, if you can't afford a gold chain?
What's old traditions when they're started in vain
We're all cynics, but we can't complain
We got mad loot, new coupes, all the bitches
But what's that without them Carter riches?
I'm talking 500 stacks, untaxed, it excites me
Might be, Phil Knight, Nuveaux is my Nike

[Hook]
Do I have permission
To kick it
And spit it
Exactly the way you been missing?
I've been down for so long
Flipping shit to get on
Until I make my first hit song
It's like my destiny
Yeah, yeah
Feel like my destiny

[Verse 2]
It's the pack over profit
Cause when pennies in my pocket
Only my pack of real niggas around
It's like that when your stacks go to college
And you spending out of pocket
And the college ain't far out of town
It's violence in the city, it's violent in the street
Defiance ain't pretty in this violent industry
You're working just to eat, when you work on that degree
In time, it'll pay off, just stay off the street
Don't be Bernie Madoff get paid off of one man's defeat
That one man, may A-K off your whole team
Money like life
You better use it while you got it
Cause you can't keep it forever
Cuffin' never been a hobby
I'm like, "oh, kemosabe"
Been workin' up on her body
She straight out the party
I'm like who Scotty deferred to
And when I work dude, you know what it is
On that Seabiscuit manure, that's that champion shit

[Hook]

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
And deep in my heart
The answer it was in me
And I made up my mind
To define
My own
Destiny
