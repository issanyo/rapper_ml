[Verse 1:]
Of the world spun by evil men with lies
Only programmed to agree with what we see before our eyes
Running after status quo on a television show
Just a picture-perfect life is the only life we know
And this uncomfortable reality got me chasing, chasing fallacy
And the pace, the pace is killing me, but I so willingly practiced sin
Just like it's my friend when the whole world is a hustle

Exactly where did we arrive in this manufactured life?
To sell my soul just to survive (yes) in the game of numbers I
I must thank the Gods of Industry, oh, for the opportunity
Or I display such loyalty, oh, for the way that they exploit me (yes)

- Oh, to consider life outside of this
Just like a splinter in my mind persists
But the Ministry of Fear exists
Only to keep me from knowing the truth
Stealing my youth when the whole world is a hustle -

Escape familiarity means that I must face the fear in me
Do something with this greed in me in order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess the pride I keep, protect it as if it's my friend
Oh, when will it end? When the whole world is a hustle

To escape this mere analogy means that I must face the fear in me
Do something with this greed in me in order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess the pride I keep, protect it as if it's my friend
Until the bitter end when the whole of the world is a hustle

Everybody’s got it going on (yeah right, yeah right)
Everybody’s so damn strong (yeah right, yeah right)
When the whole of the world is a hustle, a hustle (x5)
I must exercise my faith cuz faith is a muscle
When the whole world is a hustle
