[Verse 1]
Loving you is wonderful
Something like a miracle
Rest assured I feel the same way you do
Needing you, it isn't hard
With you, I can let down my guard
Stay secure that's all I'm asking from you
(Stay secure)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I had words to tell (I wish)
This feeling that I know so well
But I don't, I don't

[Chorus]
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)

[Verse 2]
I've always been curious
Meeting someone serious
Looking for someone who loves like me
But the day I stopped my search
It seemed that you were put on Earth
To show me everything I could not see

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could find a way
To tell you how I felt that day
But I can't (I just can't)
I can't

[Chorus]
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)

[Bridge]
Knowing him, loving him
Showing him that I'm all in
Living and, forgiving and
I would do it all again
Genuine, seraphim
Sweeter than cinnamon
Heaven-sent gentleman
Synonyms for loving him

[Chorus]
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)

[Chorus]
You're all...
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)

[Outro]
He's all that I'll ever need
He's got a hold on me
I love you
Oh, I don't wanna live without you
You're all that I can say, hey
Loving you is wonderful
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I...
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)

All I can say
Loving you is wonderful
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
