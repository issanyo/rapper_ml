[Intro:]
"Every man has the technique; and they're all different. But when you know mine, you'll be DEAD"

Yo... (Can I see you?) Lauryn Hill on the track...
(In the morning) New Ark got my back...
DJ Skribble, just relax, haha! I'm a get you the joint! haha!
Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh!

[Verse:]
As I span the cosmos
Mahogany travel at the speed of sound
Span the mainstream but still esteemed underground
My parameters, and wrap up contaminants
Travel twice Earth's diameter, intimidating amateurs (what?!)
At the Apollo, I played the shepherd, sheep followed
Chicks try to model after me like I'm Tyra
Banks; wanna thank me 'cause my statements are prodigious
Styles so prestigious, make a sinner act religious
Street academics, seen alot of girls mimic (Huh)
But when it's all over you can tell who's the gimmick
L slang-bangs like a dub plate (Bing!)
Jericho Sound System, mash up your club dates!
Sweeter than a cherry on a fruit cocktail
Whenever, Wherever, Whatever like Maxwell (Unh)
My pentium makes more chips than Intel (Intel)
I didn't mean to turn you on like Cherrelle!
Kids move they body like they're tripping off of acid
Anthony, not even fantasy can surpass it
Once you blast it, one starts to feel kinky
I think he, goes by the name of Young Slinky
And just when you thought it was safe to relax
L-Boogie spits with perfect syntax!
Then, DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax (What?)...
DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax!

Can I hear you in the morning
Like I hear you late at night?
Chance to hear you, amp the party
DJ Skribble, keep it tight!
Just a short time in the morning
Like I hear you late at night
Chance to hear you, amp the party
DJ Skribble, keep it tight!
