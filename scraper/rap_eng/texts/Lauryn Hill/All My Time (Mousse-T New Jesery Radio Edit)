Show me why Paid & Live ain't your average click

[Live]
Could it be that dude he DKNY
As I see his majesty's ebony eyes
His clear complexion got me open wide
I'm sayin', "Come on, girl, roll with the ride"
Allow me to introduce to utilize
You need a vibe, I could tell through the eyes
If you decide you wanna roll with the real money
Live, keep it goin', flowin', you know that we go
It's all for the dough and the love for my people
N'I mean, come on we could blow this scene
We the types to make the nigga wanna drop his team
We could force the A/C and let me sack this cream
Cruisin' the Garden State as we conversate
About big time livin' so we both relate
Keepin' it real, honey, if you ain't the one, I can't tell
Sincerely yours, protection, A-N-G-E-L

All my time
It could be spent wit' you
So what you gonna do
Make sure your game is true
See, all my time
It could be spent wit' you
So what you gonna do
Make sure your game is true

[Lauryn Hill {Live}]
Well, could it be the dude he's Cartier, I swear
There's stares, especially smooth as Syndey Portier
Clean cut and dapper, seems he's straight and narrow
Tinglin' the bone marrow, team the almighty apparel
But I ain't that aggressive, instead I act suggestive
Bat my eye lashes right through the sunglasses
Sound perfectly with the classic under my dark glasses
I'm mouthin' all the words to Blue Magic
(You must have put a spell on my mind)
With all due respect till you 'pproached it
Hand off a the roach clip as I respectfully decline to smoke it
Roll get the ice, his demeanor was nice
He tried to freak it to my mental, word
{Hey, yo', it was an accidental}
Yo', his talk was slick, my resume is kinda thick
{So let's blow this scene, girl, and check this flick}
And show me why Paid & Live ain't your average click
{Recognize Paid & Live 'bout to lock this shit}

[Lauryn Hill]
Yeah, yeah, I know you got a car, but we should keep it in the lot
I got a urge to ride the train and do some walkin' in the rain
It sounds the same, but meditate it for the brain
Plus I like to get to see if you as crazy as you claim

[Live]
Dope blown, like iceberg, slim and down goin's
Uncut, it's all raw, dog, hit me off
Paid & Live, baby girl, I'm sayin' this connection
Be in through your burrow, territory in section, true
I come correct in all my agenda
Trump jewels, top gear, and Willie Wear linens
No question, I'll show you affection
As I proceed to lead your direction

[Lauryn Hill]
Well, these procedures that you agree to
I'm gonna need to know a little bit more about yourself and family
Well, who's Paid and who's Live, where you live, what you drive
Never did a homicide let our molecules collide
And time will tell if you can endure with Nell
If you tryin' to knock it down then I'm not the type of girl
My mind's a pearl, and I done been around the world
But if you righteous, I might just let you spend the night and
Tuck me in real tight and watch the fight with Tyson
Kiss me on my cheek
I got the type of shit to make a nigga fight for weeks
Never mess with geeks
Well, mister Live I've decided that I like you
And if you try to get to know me better I won't fight you
