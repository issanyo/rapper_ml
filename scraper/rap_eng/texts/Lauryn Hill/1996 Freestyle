[Intro: Pras]
Yo, this is the Refugees, gonna give you a little vibe of the score
As we bug out in this studio wit' my man, John Peel
You know how we do, bust it

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
How many mikes do we rip on the daily?
Say, me say, "Many, many", say, me say, "Many, many, many"
How many mikes do we rip on the daily?
Many, many, say, me say, "Many, many, many"

[Verse 1: Lauren Hill]
You crossed the line, now there's no comin' back
Emcees are gettin' sucked into my intergalactical pull
I'm the articles on you, on your ass
If you get the microphone, brother, you can just say:
'Pras asked me no questions and I'm tellin' you no lies'
If you're lookin' at me wrong, this wasn't meant for your eyes
Realize you can't knock this cause this style is 'noxious
It's gaseous, I'm turnin' all your rap pages to ashes
Oh, this thing's creative, debated it from here to Asia
Minor rhymers, find your vocabulary
Kind of ordinary, I get tossed up, it's scary
Maybe we're legendary, we roll blunts like Bob Marley
And you sittin' on for Sugarhill, they was a band
My man, learn your history before you try to sham
Oh, shimmy, don't go bar-frontin', jokers need to start
Led to the T-O-Ps where you find the Refugees
Three like Jamaicans say when they feelin' I-R-E
Ha-ha, so Wyclef, won't you touch it?

[Hook]
