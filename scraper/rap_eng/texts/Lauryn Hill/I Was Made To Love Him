[Intro]
Hey, oh, hey hey hey
See I was born in Newark (sure was)

[Verse 1]
We were always hand in hand
He wore high top shoes and shirt tales
Nip wore her pigtails
I knew I loved him even then
You know some disapproved it
They even boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time and time again
You know I was made to love him
Build my world around him and
Hey, hey, hey
He’s been my inspiration
Sho’ nuff appeciation
For the love I gave him through the years

[Bridge]
Like a sweet magnolia trea
My love blossomed tenderly
My love grew sweeter through the years

[Chorus]
I know my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That’s why we made it through the years
I was made to love him
Worship and adore him, yes say
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, oh Lord

All through thick and thin
Our love just won’t end
But I love my baby, love my baby, oh

[Verse 2]
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
I know I ain’t going nowhere
I was just a little thing
The love bug hit me
I had the fever with each passing year

[Bridge]
If all should tumble
And the whole world crumble
By his side I’ll still be standing, yeah

[Chorus]
Because I was made to love him
Made meant for him, say
Hey, hey, hey
I was made to love him
Build my world all around him say
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I love my baby
Nip ain't’ going nowhere
Say hey, hey, hey
