[Chorus]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, what a bum-bum
You might win some, what a bum-bum

[Verse 1: Joan Thiele]
It's funny how the money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble you in every station
Some wan' play  Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand [?] non-violent
But the evil thing test me, run for my gun
Can't take a threat to my new born son
L has been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna bawl over separation
Tarnishing my image in the conversation
Who you gonna scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some

[Chorus]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, what a bum-bum
You might win some, what a bum-bum

[Verse 2: Joan Thiele]
Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin to grab a hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm on a hope road
Every man want to act like he's exempt
When he need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is not coincidence

[Chorus: x2]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, but you really lost one
You might win some, what a bum-bum
You might win some but what a bum-bum
