Trynna fix myself for society
Trynna mix myself for society
But can you tell me where is love in anxiety?
But can you tell me where is love in anxiety?

Yes I'm in love (The gates)
Yes, I'm in love (The gates)

Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're going to
Where you're coming from
What you're going through
Where you're coming from
What you're going through
Where you're coming from

All that you could be is a spectacle
Following after every single miracle
Watch them marvel at
All the joy you have
But they're too important to have all the joy you have
What a tragedy, you can laugh at me, you can laugh at me

But I'm in love (I'm in love)
Yes, I'm in love
So I'm guarding the gates, (Guard)
I'm guarding the gates, (Guarding)
I'm guarding the gates (The gates, The gates)
Oh guarding in the gates (Guard)
I'm guarding the gates, (Gaurding)
I'm guarding the gates (The gates, the gates)


Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're going to
Where you're coming from
What you're going through
Where you're coming from
What you're going through
Where you're coming from

All that you could be is a spectacle
Followin' after every single miracle
Watch them marvel at
All the joy you have
But they're too important to have all the joy you have
What a tragedy, you can laugh at me, you can laugh at me

But I'm in love, I'm protectin' love
These broken thoughts, oh in the mind
You can't let them get down in there
You can't let them get down in there
These broken thoughts, oh in the mind
You can't let them get down in there
You can't let them get down in there

Cause I'm gone in the gates
I'm guarding the gates
I'm guarding the gates
I'm guarding the gates
Guarding the gates, guarding the gates
I'm guarding the gates


Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're going to
Where you're coming from
What you're going through
Where you're coming from
What you're going through
Where ya coming from

All that you could be is a spectacle
When you followin' after every single miracle
Watch them marvel at
All the joy you have
It's so marvelous, all the joy you have, yes

Oh I'm protectin' love, Oh, I'm respectin' love
Oh I'm projectin' love, Oh I'm projectin' a difference because
