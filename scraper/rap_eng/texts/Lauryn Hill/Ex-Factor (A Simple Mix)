Y-yo.. y-yo.. uhh Y-yo.. y-yo.. uhh Y-y-yo.., yo, y-yo.. Y-y-yo..

It could all be simple but you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle we both end up scarred
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will
Is this just a silly game that forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name, then pretend, that you can't stay
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will

[HOOK:]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin, it ain't workin, uhh
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy..

I keep letting you back in, how can I explain myself?
As crazy as this thing has been, I just can't be with no one else
I know what we've got to do, you let go I'll let go too
No one's hurt me more than you and no one ever will

Yo, y-yo, yo yo- I'm here now, not just because it's my year now
I'm clear now, only feelin cats that's sincere now
Heart of lioness, scientist, street Zionist
Don't twist it, it's consistantly consistent
If you missed it, this train is bound for glory
End of story, my whole repoitory is Psalm 40
They bomb for me
Thinkin they can mess with your plan, but I'mma play lamb
Knowin that the Kingdom's at hand, and showin those who want it
You gon' bring em the land, descendants of Ham
Not concerned with the platinum status
Cause every joint I threw, I would do for gratis
I'm on the train with my Pips like I'm lil Gladys
Or in the Range throwin chips to the kids in Addis (Ethiopia)
Ababa, two kids and and a baby father
Hot to lava, we Don Dadda, Don Dadda

[HOOK]

Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me..
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Ohh noo.. why won't you live for me?
Why..hahhhihhhhhh, won't you live, for me, for me, for meeee
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!
Give to meeeeeee..
Give to meeeeeee..

It could all be simple, but you'd rather make it hard..
Loving you, loving you, is like a bat-tle..
