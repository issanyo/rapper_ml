[Bob Marley]
Turn your lights down low
And'a pull your window curtain
Oh let Jah moon come shining in
Into our life again
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time
[Lauryn - Long, long time]
I kept this message for you, girl
But it seem I was never on time
Still I wanna get through to you, girl
On time
On time
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I want to give you some good, good lovin'

[Lauryn Hill]
Turn your lights down low
Never ever try to resist, oh no
Oh let your love come shinin' in
Into our lives again
Saying: ooh, I love you
And I want you to know right now
Ooh I love you
And I want you to know right now
That I, that I
I wanna give you some love
I wanna give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin'

Loving you is a like a song I replay
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day
And every chorus was written for us to recite
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night
This potion might, this ocean might carry me
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
And every word, every second, and every third
Expresses a happiness more clearly than ever heard
And when I play ‘em, every chord is a poem
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him
The harmonies possess, a sensation similar to your caress
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes
Stand in love, take my hand and love Jah bless
Right, right

[Bob]
I want to give you some good, good loving
Turn your lights down low
And-a pull your window curtains

[Lauryn]
And let Jah love come tumbling in
Into our lives again

[Bob]
Sayin’, it’s been a long, long time

[Lauryn]
I got this message for you, boy

[Bob]
But it seems I was never on time

[Lauryn]
Still I wanna get through to you, boy

[Bob and Lauryn]
On time
On time
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin’

[Lauryn]
Good, some good, good, good, good, good, good

[Bob]
I want to give you some good, good lovin'

[Lauryn]
Good, good
Oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin’
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Yeah
Please don’t forget passionate
Babies in the bassinet
You call, we be ready
Ha ha, Ma steady
Yeah, yes
Baby love
