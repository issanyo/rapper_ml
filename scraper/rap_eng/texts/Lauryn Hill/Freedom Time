Everybody knows that they're guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they're guilty
Resting on their conscious eating their insides
Its Freedom
Said, its Freedom Time now
Its Freedom
Said its Freedom Time now
Time to get free
Oh, give yourselves up now
Its Freedom

Said, its freedom time yall
There's a war in the mind
For the territory over dominion
Who will dominate opinions
Schizims and isms
Keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee elections
Moral infection
Epidemic Lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the higest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders
From hearing like under water
Beyond the borders
Finding sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
And systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em drunk off the spirit?
Truth comes and we can't hear it
And you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision
I was falling in indecision
Appalling
Calling religion some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in a system
Of anti-christs and majority rules
Intelligent Fools
PhDs of ilusions
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of Past illusions
Now, who you choosing?
The head or the tail?
The Bloodshed or the Male?
Or confidence in the veil?
Conferences at Yale
Discussing Doctrines at Baal (pronounced Bale)
Causing People to Fail
Keeping A third in jail
His word is nailed, everything to the tree
Severing all the me
From all I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoyed darkness as lord
Keeping me from the sword
Blocked from mercy
Bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat, we would eat
And still dine at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemy's defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causing desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'till there was nothing left of me
Realizing the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only option supernatural circumcision
Inwardly
Only water can purge the hearts from words
The firey darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity
Shaping in
There's no escaping when
Your whole philosiphy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Can it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow
Making love with a whore
Aching in sores
Babylon the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social socercery
Our present condition needs serious recongnition
Where's there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Sudam and Minister Farakhan
What's going on
What's a priority to you
By what authority do we
Majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters check the verses
Recapture the land remove the mark off our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his commands
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand

Its Freedom
Said, its Freedom Time now
Its Freedom
Said its Freedom Time now
Its Freedom
I'm a be who I am
Its freedom time
Said, its freedom time
Everybody knows that they lied
Everybody knows they perpertrated inside
Everybody knows that thier guilt is
Resting on their conscious eating thier insides
Get free
Be who you're supposed to be
Freedom
Said its freedom time now
Freedom
Said its freedom time
Freedom
Freedom time now...
