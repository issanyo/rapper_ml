Refugee camp, with Cypress Hill
Yo, bringin' it on Cubans meet the Haitians
Perfect combination, check it

[Wyclef Jean:]
You say guns, I say pistolas
Well, if you got beef son, c√°llate la boca
Go meet me on the island where the Cubans meet the Haitians
Herbal meets the verbal lyrical assassination
From L A to Brooklyn why you doin' all that talkin'

Think you got a soul but you're a dead man walking
Yo, toast the host from coasts' we boast
When we meet again, I will be Casper that friendly ghost
You'll hear shots, like the Show Cops
Things are still the same, I'm still growin' crops
Wyclef with B-Real, let me build better yet, kill or be killed
Yo, B Real watch your grip

[Hook:]
Hi, boom biddy, bye, bye
Yo, open up your eyes you'll be the next one to die
Boom biddy, bye, bye
Oh, as simple as they come as the simple as they die
Boom biddy, bye, bye
Yo, who told the boy, to pack a forty five
Boom biddy, bye, bye
Now he rest in the place that they call paradise

Fools run up, but they've never seen the last
Fragile ass niggas get broken like glass
Can he pass or does he posess the will
Or does he need to create to keep him straight on the real
Punks are broken some day fall off the ledge
Refugee camp bringin' it straight over the edge
[Wyclef Jean:]
You duck as I pluck the feathers from ya skin
How ya gonna win that's like Satan without no sin
They'll never happen while I'm rappin', I be watchin'
The Philistines, creepin' up in Manhattan
The sun turn up though Wyclef produce a track with Muggs
But there's no survivors, they all died in the flood

[Hook]

[Wyclef:]
Yo, once a child, twice a villain
If this was drugs I'd make a million off this combination
They say you're dope Clef, you're dope
So they offer me sess and beer
Beware, you pull your wallet Mr Thief stares
The opposite direction of the room, he pulled his gun and said
I'm doomed join the Son of Man in the tomb

I see the soldiers, comin' from out the shadows
Ready for battle, ain't tryin' to hear the baffled
Warriors lined up in full war gear
In it to win it if it goes on for years
Dedicated to the stable of the assassins
Revolutionaries, just bring on the action

[Hook]

Soldier man rewind selector soldier man
Refugee soldier man, Brooklyn soldier man
L A massive soldier man
New Jersey massive soldier man
Uptown massive soldier man
Long Beach massive soldier man
You know the whole world watches soldier man

Boom biddy bye bye
Open up ya eyes you'll be the next one to die
