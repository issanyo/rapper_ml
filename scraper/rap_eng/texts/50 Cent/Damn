[Verse: 50 Cent]
When the street lights go on - the wolves come out
Stick-up kids they know the kid - cause I been with' them out
Niggas eyeball my shines, I can't stand it
With my little 5 shot three eighty that keep jamming. [gunshot] {DAMN! }
Nigga I got a felonies, I ain't no rat
You play me close fool - and you gonna get clapped. [gunshot]
I feel chills up my spine when the D's look back
Cause I'm dirty, got a blunt and half a pack and my Gat! {Whoo Kidd! }
Frankie ain't pumpin' shit. - Till Lance come back home
It's 4 niggas in that clique, Lance they backbone
They pussy but if homes say: "Shoot! " [shot] They start shooting
But now they at homes wake [gunshot] - and they deep in it recruiting. {DAMN! }
Pop already had the block, they said: "Fuck him! "
Put niggas in the huddle - gave 'em simple instructions
Said - Operation: "Shut-down", the block, 12 o'clock
Y'all niggas pull to that strip and let off like thirty shots. [automatic gunshots] {Whoooooo! }
To make it hot! [gunshot] - Niggas shot Charlie in the leg
But he broke and always beggin' should've shot him in the head. [gunshot] {DAMN! }
This cat bustin' busta's, he runnin'
Made it to that building

He pulled knocked on the door. {SHADYVILLE! }
"Papi let me in, I'm shot!
Niggas wildin' on the block."
"Son I'm hit, no bullshit! "
"Oh, shit nigga what the fuck happened? "
"Nigga pulled through in the black hooptie and start clappin'! " [gunshot]
