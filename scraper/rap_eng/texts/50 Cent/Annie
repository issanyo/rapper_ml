[Hook 1: 50 Cent]
Baby, are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Baby, are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay, baby?
Too much Merlot, too much Rose, too much Hennessey
Too much champagne, she twist it, she fuckin' with me

[Verse 1: Gio Washington](50 Cent)
Baby, is it okay if I stay a while and we play around?
(It's okay)
Baby, is it okay
If I unbutton your pants and pull your panties down?
(Shawty a freak, man)
Baby, is it okay if I open your blouse and unbuckle your bra?
(You know she like that)
Baby, is it okay if we get it poppin' right here where we are?

[Hook 2: 50 Cent]
Annie, is it okay? Are you okay? Is it okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? Is it okay? Don't it feel good, baby?
Too much Merlot, too much Rose, too much Hennessey
Too much Champagne, she twist it, she fuckin' with me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent](Gio Washington)
Baby, is it okay if we leave the club and shawty come with us?
(Is it okay, baby?)
Baby, is it okay if I sit and watch you go one on one?
(Oh yeah, I like that)
Baby, is it okay if I turn in and make you feel good, baby?
(I make you feel good)
Baby, is it okay
If we leave the lights on, but I lay my stroke down crazy?
