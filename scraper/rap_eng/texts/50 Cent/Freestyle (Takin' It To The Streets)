[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah word to B.I.G. man, you niggas have some audacity
Sell four mil' then you're half of me
Get off my dick on this shit, I know y'all niggas copying my style

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
They stay at home all alone in the zone off of 50 shit
That gangsta music, that makes 'em wanna grab the chrome and just roam on they own
Then do it how the gangstas do it, aye

[Verse: 50 Cent]
You niggas want problems you're welcome
Frank's not around anymore, New York's mine
Blood set, Crip set, gangsta respect
I give niggas the green light, ya get ya whole crew wet
You've been rappin' a long time you ain't got chips yet
You had that ounce a whole week, nigga you ain't flip bricks
Before I leave the crib I make for sure I don't forget shit
Mac, check, clip, check, vest, check, I'm ready to roll
It's no contest, I'm the coldest from the East
Niggas mad I'm doin' good so I wake up to new beef
Niggas sayin': "yeah, I know 50 back when his name was Boo"
"When he used to pump rock on that roof, before he blew"
Then when they come through sayin' what's up, I'm like: "who are you?"
We ain't never made no money together then we ain't cool
Cocaine, baking soda, pot full of boiling water
Teach ya how to cook crack, nigga, how ya like that?
Turn a buck into a stack, man I mean a G stack
Just took you from three-and-a-half to fourteen, you peep that shit
Deep shit, keep shit on the low nigga
We roll shit, smoke shit, pass the dro nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
They stay at home all alone in the zone off of 50 shit
That gangsta music, aye, that makes 'em wanna grab the chrome and just roam on they own
Then do it how the gangstas do it, aye

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah man, keep it real gangsta like, you know what I'm sayin'
November Fourth, G-Unit album in stores
November Fourth, G-Unit sneakers in stores
It's goin' down like that you know what I'm sayin'
Silverback guerillas in the concrete jungle baby
You gotta love it
