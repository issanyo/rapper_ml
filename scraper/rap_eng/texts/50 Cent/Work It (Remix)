G U-nit!

This is a Missy Elliot one time exclusive (Come on)

[Hook]
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
If you got a big, let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
Remix

Yeah
Now Missy she too much for me (I'm freaky)
Took me to to the crib man, Missy she told me (eat me)
Now my babymama I told her ass not to beat me
Her broke ass wanna fight, Missy know how to treat me
She sitting on cash, she got money out the ass
Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass
Now you can see me in the coupe like WHAT
Next time I'll hit her in that G5 TRUCK
I've got the magic stick, I can go for hours
From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky
I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry
I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub
Ching! Ching! Jackpot, I think I'm in love
I'm looking for Missy now so I can get my back rubbed
This the shit she hollered in my ear before we left the club

I'd like to get to know ya, so I can show ya
Put the pussy on ya, like I told ya
Gimme all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank than call me ov-ah
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my cho-cha
You do or you don't or you will or you won't cha
Go downtown and eat it like a vul-cha
See my hips and my tips don'tcha
See my ass and my lips don'tcha
Lost a few pounds in my waist for ya
This the kinda beat that go wa-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
Work it! I need a glass of wat-ah
Boy oh boy its good to know ya

[Hook]
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
If you got a big , let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"

[Verse 2]
If you're a fly gyal, get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy lift it up, lets make a toast-ah
Lets get drunk, its gon bring us clos-ah
Don't I look like a Halle Berry post-ah?
See dem Belvedere playin tricks on ya
Girlfriend wanna be like me nev-ah
You won't find a bitch that's even bett-ah
I make it hot as Las Vegas weath-ah
Listen up close while I take you backwards
"Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards"
I'm not a prostitute but I can give you whatchu want
I love your braids and your mouth full of funk
Love the way my ass ba-bump ba-bump bump
Keep your eyes on my ba-bump ba-bump bump
And think you can handle this ga-donk ga-donk donk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights off so you see what I can do

[Hook]
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
If you got a big , let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"

[Verse 3]
Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys
Why-thai,-thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai
Rock-thai,-thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai
Girls, girls, get that cash
If its 9 to 5 or shakin ya ass
Ain't no shame ladies, do your thang
Just make sure you ahead of tha game

Just cause I got a lot of fame sup-ah
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte, enslave a game, no sir
Picture black sayin, "Oh yessuh massa"
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute man, big men can outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask ya
When I come out, you won't even matt-ah
Why you act dumb like ughhh, duh
So you act dumb like ughhh, duh
And the drummer boy go pa-rum pa-pum pum
Give ya some some some of this Cinnabon

[Hook]
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
If you got a big, let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"
"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it"

To my fellas, ooooh
Good God, I like the way you work that
To my ladies, woo
You sure know how to work that, good God
