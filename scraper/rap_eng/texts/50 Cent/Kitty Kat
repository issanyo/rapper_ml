[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Big boy Bentley, big boy semi
Niggas wanna kill me, ain't worth nigga pennies
I drop a bag off, and the Uz' will spray you
I need six pockets like a pool table
These hoes love me, these hoes love my pimpin
They in the Phantom, clickin' on they Cablevision
Dope, I got the Chef Boyardee bags
Coke, I got it runnin' out the rehab
Hoes like, "Why he actin' so Hollywood?
'Cause there's a chauffeur in his 300 Hollywood"
I'm hot, no ghostwriter for the mic
Basically the Hollywood writer on strike, YEAH!

Bitch hand me my weed, weed... {*growls*}
I'm so ghetto, I'm so, I'm so ghetto
On the low, I creeps, I moves with my metal
I be's in the club with my burner like WHAT
I done did so much dirt, I ain't tryin to get CUT
I'm a bad boy, that bad boy they wan' fuck with
They like that black on black rims on the Caddy truck kid
I make that hard white flip, nigga since "Get Rich"
My jewels so sick, they talk to a bitch

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I don't pay for kitten, are ya kiddin'? Well it's the kid
A.K.A., in and out your sister's crib
Mr. So Fly, I OD the stores
My car damn near fly, it got eagle doors
Before you see me off, you'll see hell freeze
You got a V-12? I got 12 V's
It's only so many months, you do the math
I'm a smoker, it's so many blunts for you to pass on me
Girl you crazy, got on B.B., rollin'
And your mouth'll be, foamin' if I keep, keep goin'
You might see, me, frozen 'cause I'm holdin' I done told 'em
If yo' game can't control 'em, then she's as good as stolen

[Chorus: Precious Paris, (Tony Yayo) & 50 Cent]
Owww, I need cash for my kitty cat
Owww, I need cash for my kitty cat

Owww, I need cash for my kitty cat
Owww, I need cash for my kitty cat
But bitch I get pussy for free, I'm hittin that
