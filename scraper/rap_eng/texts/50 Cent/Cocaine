[Intro]
Where did you get this stuff?
Columbia
Oh, uhh... well, do you mind if I do a line?
Yeah, go ahead; fuck it, let's all do one
{*All sniffing*}
I can't feel my face
I mean I can touch it, but I can't feel it... inside

[Hook: 50 Cent & Robin Thicke]
Cocaine – I know police is watchin' (I see 'em watchin')
Cocaine – Hustlin', I'm not stoppin' (I got to eat)
Cocaine – I got to get my money, you think shit is funny
Me I'm 'bout my business (you're motherfuckin' right) – Cocaine

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Columbian girl, Peruvian chick
She make the money roll and I love the bitch
Know she ain't a virgin, but she pure
For the right price I'll let you fuck with her raw
A little like a pimp, I'm your pusher man
She could make us both rich nigga, yes, she can
You want your own spot, let's talk locations
Then talk market and the public relations

[Bridge: Robin Thicke & (50 Cent)]
Everybody's watchin'
But no one talks about it (shut your mouth)
Right now – that's all it was, anything call it
She said ''Sex just ain't the same without it''

[Hook: 50 Cent & Robin Thicke]
Cocaine – I know police is watchin' (I see 'em watchin')
Cocaine – Hustlin', I'm not stoppin' (I ain't stoppin')
Cocaine – I got to get my money (I got to eat), you think shit is funny
Me I'm 'bout my business – Cocaine

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Every little step I take (come on), you will be there
Every little step I make (look, bitch), we'll be together
So grateful (yeah), so faithful (uhh)
Every gram in the hand's more paper (c'mon)
I'll cut it, you sniff it, or smoke it, terrific

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Movie stars, models and blondes and cocaine
New York, L.A. – 's all the same
The angels look the other way
'Cause they can understand my pain

[Hook: 50 Cent & Robin Thicke]
Cocaine – I know police is watchin' (I see 'em watchin')
Cocaine – Hustlin', I'm not stoppin' (naw, I ain't stoppin')
Cocaine – I got to get my money (yeah), you think shit is funny (c'mon)
Me I'm 'bout my business (business) – Cocaine

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You niggas got a problem, yeah
A big motherfucking problem
At a minimum, I'ma have a nigga put speedknots all over your motherfucking head, ya dig?
Oh shit

[Robin Thicke]
Cocaine {*echoes*}
