Baby when I told you, you're the only one I like
I meant to say, I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight
And baby when I told you, you're the sunshine of my life
I meant to say, shawty I ain't no trick, bitch please I ain't buying you shit

[Verse 1]
When I told you I like you for everything you are
I meant I like the way your titties sit up in your bra
Everything I said in your ear by the bar
Was just to get you in the back seat of my car
You're an inspiring actress, girl you could go far
If you knew who I knew, baby you would be a star
But when I told you, you had sexy lips
I meant to say I bet you suck a good dick
And when I said I was feeling ya hips
I meant to say, I bet she like it like a dog and shit
So tell me doc, am I really sick?
When bitches find out how I think, they say I ain't shit
When I say I love it, I mean I like it a lot
I say I wanna fuck, I mean right on the spot
I say it's my pussy, but bitch you know it's yours
You say it's your dick, okay then lick on the balls

[Hook]
Baby when I told you, you're the only one I like
I meant to say, I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight
And baby when I told you, you're the sunshine of my life
I meant to say, shawty I ain't no trick, bitch please I ain't buying you shit

[Verse 2]
When I said I miss you, I mean I ain't hit in a while
I was thinking I come over, I'm thinking I can knock you down
When I said just kiss it, I mean come on just suck me off
I said I'll take you shopping, I meant I'll drive you to the mall
I wanna keep in touch, you know I hardly ever call
I'm doing big things, but I like my money short
You lookin' good baby, I complement you on your clothes
I mean them jeans ya wearing, I can't wait to take 'em off
I bet I get ya hot, I mean hotter than a stove
I'll be ya freak, ya freak, yeah I'll lick ya I suppose
I mean from your neck, all the way down to your toes
I won't miss a spot, I'm good at this, lord knows
Now here I go again, I mean I wanna get it on
I say anything, I'm a horny little dawg
Put ya legs back, and hop on you like a frog
Get religious quick, have you saying my god

[Hook x2]
Baby when I told you, you're the only one I like
I meant to say, I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight
And baby when I told you, you're the sunshine of my life
I meant to say, shawty I ain't no trick, bitch please I ain't buying you shit
