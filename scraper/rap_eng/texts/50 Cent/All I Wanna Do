You know a robbery can turn into a homicide

Revolver get to spinnin', nigga you can spend the night

A lil' Henny make the nigga wanna spray sumthin'
Dare nigga say sumthin'. - Muhfucka stay frontin'
If that's jewelry they be knowing it be sumthin' [classic evil laughter]
Until them cats scrap and get to blow him for the money
Some got good aim, some got bad aim
So it's bang bang! - It's all part of the game
Every hood is the same, different faces different names
Different crew different gangs! - Different is just the same
