[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
Comin' equipped with some shit that niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you ho niggas
Run up on me and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why? Stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time
And its a bitch cause the judge gave you 8 years
You doin 6 and we know that you can't hang
You a trick rolled over turned snitch like a bitch

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
They got a nigga in the dice game
I'm feelin' lucky but the nigga just a little bigger
He tryin fuck me out my cash, I'ma blast nigga
He don't know I gotta tell ya like the last nigga
Gotta go don't need to roll for the truck, I get 'em up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit 'em up
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I ain't puttin down my Glock
The gun shots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
I'ma show you not to ever play a true nigga (haha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin motherfucker we can do this

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 3" Method Man]
Y'all know me since '93, now let that weed burn
Back in this bitch, class dismissed, it's the return
Of the super sperm, game over, lose a turn
Takes a germ to kill a germ, when will y'all killas learn
Yo, back when chef mami used to sell plates, we used to sell base
I learned to wipe my nose and wipe the prints off the shell case
Don't want no jail case, freedom miles standing at hell's gate
It's hot, and the devil's my cell mate
The game's addictive, I can't stop, it's like I'm chasing that first high
Like Betty Crocker baking that first pie
The beef we serving is stir fried, swerving all through your urban
Hurting, every gate and corner, you working, I'm
The bottom line, the school of hard knocks turn into Columbine
And my set is throwing up dollar signs
Some get gwop, some get pop, me?
I got a ziplock of bubble gum, just for selling Chris Rock
What part of the game is this?
I came to break bread, evidently y'all killas came to bitch, nigga
So, who you with, nigga, don't even trip, nigga
Some say they pull trigga, I think they bullshitter

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed

[Bridge]
Go, go, go, go, go Charlotte it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
It's the Don Daddy with the Villain, who you killing
Oh we hate them, come verbatim with this cap peeling
Top billin, make a million
Paparazzi, chase us through the tunnel in the Maserati
Now they got me on Hard Copy didn't have to shoot Versace
Yet you still wanna watch me
Motherfuckers wait they whole fuckin life and aday
Hopin' that we can reunite N.W.A
All purpose, try to serve us, gettin' nervous, more murders
Shit can just turn into the circus
Standin over the carcass
You look like the kind of nigga that'd press charges
We the largest, we the biggest, we the Niggas, With the Attitudes
We longitude, you latitude, have some gratitude
To the niggas that started this shit
Been around forever bitch, we smart at this shit

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you're into gettin' rubbed
