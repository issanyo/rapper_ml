This, is, sim-ple
I, feel, you understand
Another, man
Can't, quite
Love you girl, (yeah a little louder) like I can
Your fantasies, and your dreams
Believe in me, I will fulfill
Now you know, how I feel
Now baby, tell me, how do you feel

[Mary]
Boy I feel like this just can't be real
And if I'm dreamin please doAnd if I'm dreamin please don't wake me up
So what's the deal should I save my love for you
Cos no one makes me feel the way that you do

[Mary]
You make me wanna see your face everyday (mmhm)
Deep down inside I know that you're my soul mate (you are my soul mate)
If you should leave I'm waiting patiently
Cos boy I know that you're the one for me (ooh)

[Mary]
Let me be the one to give you everything (boy I wanna be the one)
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams
Let me be the one who be right by your side
Let me be the one, let me be the one

[Mary]
I'm your girl, see there's no one quite like me
Nobody will love you the way that I do
I get chills when you put your arms around me
You make me feel like I'm the only one

[Mary]
You make me wanna see your face everyday
Deep down inside I know that you're my soul mate (you are my soul mate)
If you should leave I'm waiting patiently (I'll be right here waiting)
Cos boy I know that you're the one for me (you're the one, you're the one)

[Mary]
Let me be the one to give you everything (ohh, let me be)
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams (I wanna be the one)
Let me be the one who be right by your side
Let me be the one, let me be the one (baby, let me, ohh)

[50 Cent]
Baby if ever you need someone who knows you
Someone to go to, someone to be by your side
Baby if ever you need someone to talk to
Someone to hold you, someone to be down to ride
You can count on me, I'll be there for you
When you need me, I care for you like you care for me
Please believe me if I was locked up I know you'd be the one to come see me
Because you understand life where we from ain't easy
Problems, they say when it rains it pours
But I'm sure together we could work through the storm
Your friends, they don't understand the shit we on
When I'm gone I'm missin you, your love is unconditional
You're my heart, I need you to live
Picture me dissin you
Now picture something positive, me huggin and kissin you
If ever you down then I feel this is what you should listen to
Listen to, listen to

[Mary]
Let me be the one to give you everything
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams
Let me be the one who be right by your side
Let me be the one, let me be the one

[Mary]
Let me be the one to give you everything
(let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you)
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams
(let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you)
Let me be the one who be right by your side
(let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you)
Let me be the one, let me be the one
(let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you)

[Mary]
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
