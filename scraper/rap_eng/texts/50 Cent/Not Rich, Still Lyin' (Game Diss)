[50 Cent talking]
This mic on?
Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank you for coming out tonight for the screening of my new film
"I'm Not Rich I'm Still Lyin'"
It's 50 Cent starring as Game, it's autobiographical
I hope you enjoy yourselves

[Verse 1: 50 impersonating Game's voice]
50 callin me crazy
I might be just maybe
I'm gangsta I'm crippin'
The Damu I'm trippin'
Fuck 50, fuck Dre, fuck N.W.A
Man I'm Hurricane Game (Em this nigga changed)
I brought the west back I write the best raps
(But what about Snoop?) Snoop shit ain't all that
And I get bad bitches now I even fucked Mya
(I fucked her 1st Game) 50 you a liar
See that's why I hate you, you think you know me
I'mma tell everybody you shot my homie
I hope the police get you and you go to jail
Feds freeze your accounts so you can't make bail
Hope everybody on G-Unit go to hell
Wit Eminem, Obie, Stat Quo and D-12
So what I was on change of hearts so what I was a stripper
So what I never banged I'm from Compton nigga

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Now horror films they scare me
I watch action films very rarely
When it's comedy or it's drama
It's starrin me no problem

[Verse 2]
Gggggg-Unot I got my own shoe (Game that shit ain't gon' sell)
So, the ad's in the magazine nobody can't tell
(Good luck wit yo next album man I hope it does well)
You tryna be funny, D-Mack got all my money
And Jimmy robbin me, they listenin probably
Me and Fase had a fall out he really not my brother
We got the same father but we got different mothers
Now Suge punked Dre but he don't punk me
I won a Vibe Award this year nobody punch me
(Game you know I wrote that hook for Hate it or Love it)
So what its still on my trophy case I think nothing of it

[Hook]

[Outro:50 talking in is normal voice]
Yeah; it's 50
New album, July 18th
It's called "I Can't Stay Away"
Y'all thought I was gonna let y'all eat?
Naw nigga

Oh! This is too much fun man
Hey... hey nigga I seen yo lil DVD nigga
Is that all you got? I mean newsflash: nobody believes you
Then you say you woke up outta coma 2001
Well yo brother says you never were in a coma
Then you say you were in a gang, Well yo brother says you were never in a gang
Now you can get your records together and you can submit 'em to me
I mean you can send the records you have to me so I can...open...
Ya album budget, your recording budget
You gotta send your music to the boss.... that's me the boss
Yeah....it's D-Unit G-Unit that's it that's all
I rule wit a iron fist
Cocksucker
