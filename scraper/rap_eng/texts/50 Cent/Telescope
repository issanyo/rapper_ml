[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
See that's the good thing about my hair man...
All I do is put water in that shit so I pull a joint out and it don't be all greasy and oily..
Turn up..

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Your flow a dime-a-dozen, my flow you gotta love it
My city hot as fuck and, came from the bottom of it
But not a product of it, bitch all my rides are custom
Smoking my ganja public, I'm all about that money
Dress like everyday sunny
Rolling weed like a Marley, smile like everything funny
But this industry shady, most these niggas are crazy
Most of them quick to lose they soul, no if or a maybe
These nudies what I'm wearing, the truth is what you're hearing
The bong is what I'm clearing, the kush is overbearing
Ferrari's what I'm steering, I'm smoking while I'm driving
Keep looking in the mirror, make sure no ones behind us
Cause niggas get jealous when your bank start to swell up
So much that people at the bank start to tell us
You need to have somebody bank for you fellas

[Hook x2: Wiz Khalifa]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Look at them and look at me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I paint a perfect picture, a perfect portrait
Poverty, robbery kill or be killed psychology
I shine just me and my nine
Screw you niggas at 8 o'clock, sharp like it’s Columbine
Guess I'm one of a kind
I see you niggas soft when that shell hit your face
I'll hit your wake to flip your coffin
Bitch get to walkin', this Sabrina's orphan
I'm like the virus, the 38, the pop cyrus
Warriors are victorious
Come out to play, I mean right away
Shit’s Ferragamo, Emporio Armani drawers
Outlaw, a nigga break all kinda laws
It's hard bottom line, time money frozen time
AP, royal oak, kush smoke, bag the coke
Push the dope, cut throat, so what
I cut throat, I fuck with hoes
So I ain't gotta say it's time to go
She already know for sure when it's time to go

[Hook x2]
