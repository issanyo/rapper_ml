Wait, wait, wait a minute

Diamonds on my wrist glisten

[Verse 1: Phresher]
Big head Jimmy Neutron
Fuck a bitch on a futon
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Nigga this ain't Groupon
Do my dirt all by my lonely
All my bitches know we homies
If I pull up wit my bitch hoes better act like they don't know me
All my side bitches in check, diamonds clear like windex
One point got an index
Smash your ass like an insect
So you better be cool
Shawty better be nude
When I walk in the room
She know she fuckin' with a goon
Did (?) at the same time
My third leg got hang time
Bang, bang, bang time
Game face when it's game time
(?) Dora
Got her screamin' like a whore-a
She keep beggin' me to stop
But she really want more-a
Dirty soap contradicted
But the dick's so addictive
Homie how could you blame her?
Her hand dealt like Kramer

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute

Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute

Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
I'm a Timbs bitch, got my boots on
Got the ex-cons in the Yukon
I don't steal, bitch, I kill bitch
'Bout to catch me a new charges
Same bitches try to call me
That's how I knew y'all was phony
I be putting in that work, taking 'em to church
'Cause I leave 'em holy
Will I smoke this bitch? Yes
Probably fail my piss test
Get rid of those fake breasts
And put a vest on this bitch chest
It's lunch time, she food
I'm Troy Ave with that tool
Both hands on it like noon
Remy Ma, I'm a goon
The city big, I'm state time
I'm snatching wigs like waistlines
Crack a bitch with my cellphone
Really put her on Facetime
That ghostwriter bout to call her
That lifeline getting shorter
R.I.P Biggie Smalls
Why the fuck they ain't warn her?
I was cooking in the kitchen
I was minding my business
Now I gotta get gangster
Cause these bitches is haters

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute

Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me count ya minutes
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Boy, now what's the issue?
You gonna make me get with you
You want talk that girlie talk bitch you can talk to my pistol
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I got big paper I'm spendin'
I get to flashin' on 'em, my whip blasted on 'em, I mean any nigga can get it
That's 30 in the extendo
I had your bitch in the end zone
Nigga she sucked me out the friend zone
Nigga she sucked me out the friend zone
I'm so good with the hoes
I pulled up in the Rolls
With my diamonds blinkin' like strobes
In a Kanye shirt with holes
I'm blowin' paper like debt
My niggas in here strapped
They'll bust, you won't bust back
That's why I act how I act
I see it oh, so, clear
You niggas ain't really-really with this shit
Got me thinkin' I really, really, really run this bitch

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
One god damn minute
Hold up wait a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me count ya minutes
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
