[Verse 1: Proof]
Barely raised by my dysfunctional fam
Here I stand as a dysfunctional man
Quick-tempered, short-fused, and pissed at God
Demons pullin' at my soul 'til it's ripped apart
Secret's out, Momma: that fire, I started it
Fuck the fireman logic of the closet by the wire shit
What's positive about a father that bust nuts then wussed up
And a momma that don't show her son enough love?
Shit, that's why I run from my first son
And force these chickenhead bitches to get abortions
I married the game, my mistress is fame
My girl packed her clothes, she know I ain't gon' change
Go insane in a world evil as ours
I done shot at houses, people and cars
The deeper the scars, the worse is the history
God, you ain't gotta forgive me, just don't forget me, you hear me?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Lord, forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again… and again

[Verse 2: Proof]
And most importantly I'm tryin' to support my seeds
Can't seem to get away from them courtin' fees
Embroidery, on my hood across my heart disorderly
Breakin' in houses of people who ain't got more than me
Accordingly, I move in error
Gotta face the fact though I can't fool this mirror
Neglected my daughter
And tryin' to blame on how I was brought up
Like I'm a product of this environment, why ain't I shot up?
Got up today, like, "Why you let me breathe again?"
And with each breath I feel death is creepin' in
Thinkin' sinners are winners, and I'ma finish last
My pen and pad record my life as each minute pass
Passin' minutes, I shook sin and shook drugs
I did right by you, but still you took Bugz
Then caught me in adultery, fought me for not knowin'
Through the dark streets you walked me, talked to me

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Lord, forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again… and again

[Verse 3: Proof]
It's the risk that's a rush, so rush my wrists into cuffs
It's like a fight for your attention and love
Speakin' of Bugz, give me a hint from above
If he not, you know I wanna be sent when I'm done
Kid out of wedlock so my lady's frontin'
I love Em 'cause he gave me somethin'
A positive anything is better than a negative nothin'
I was on the edge of death, ready to jump in
It's hard when you can't find love anywhere
And just because the reverend listen don't mean he care
Pops on crack with a sufferin' past
I dream in black and white, the world color me bad
Other than sad, painful and stressed
Life is good with the webs that tangle with death
Control the border, control the score
I have sinned amongst men and my soul is yours

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Lord, forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again… and again
Lord, forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again… and again
