[Hook]
Everytime we break up, it's like we make up
Just to do it again, here we go again
Tell me how I can prove to you?
That you're my closest friend, here we go again
Everytime you pick up my phone, you starting shit again
Here we go again
I just wanna love you, don’t wanna fight cause I can’t win

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
Why would I want to fight with you?
Beefing with you is worthless
Cause I think God made you for me
We match together perfect
You’re acting insecure
Why don’t you think I would stay with you?
Girl if its up to me I’ll spend forever and a day with you
Engagement, ring ring, 10 carat bling bling
I be on that boss shit
I’ll be-be on that boss shit
Benzes, Porsches, Ferraris, Rolls
I’ll let you drive em all
So we can have a ball

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
And again, you don’t hear me, when I talk to you
When bills come I pay the bills, I’m doing what I’m supposed to do
For Christ's sake, give me a break
I shake the jakes to get the cake
Thats why we straight, I’m out of state
I’m putting food on our plate
The bickering make the love feel like hate
You're my soulmate, us being together is our fate
Leaving me would be a big mistake
Wrong move to make
Apart, both of us would be in bad shape

[Hook]

Your love compares to your love
Girl you take me higher
If you wanna fight me
Go head and fight me
Till you tire
I’m for you
You for me
In the end we gon see
You and me it’s meant to be
But as of right now, here we go again
