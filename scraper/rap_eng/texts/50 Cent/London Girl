[Intro]
Ay, ay quit billing my phone, bruv

[Bridge]
I just got back from the U.K
But I'm going back to the U.K
I just bought a flat in the U.K
(You just got back baby today?)
I just got back from the U.K
But I'm going back to the U.K
I'm a little jetlag now, okay?

[Hook]
She's my London girl - she's my, my
My London girl - she's my, my

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the first time I seen her, son, I knew she was the shit
I seen her in the V.I.P. chilling with her clique
She hot, mane, I watched her, I like her style
She don't know what I'm thinking when I'm staring at her lips
In my imagination I can see her suck the dick
I like that, I want that, we could do it right now
Just a minute of your time, let me talk to ya love
I wan' get to know you, maybe I can call you up
Then we can chit-chat 'til you let me hit that
I'll get deep 'til I hit the back of your kit-kat
You're not a freak, but you'll be one when I'm done
It's anytime, anyplace with me, hon
I'm sexual, when I'm next to you
I'm a horny dog, oh my God

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She said she's so sophisticated, you know when she talk to me
She's such an intellectual, she make me want her sexual
Give what I got, backshot after backshot, sweat non-stop
I really like the way she move, I'm trying to say she hot
She rodeo, she ride it good when she get on top
She work it, she work it and she be putting it down
It looks good, yeah, good enough to taste it
A boy toy, yeah. I'm what she wan' play with
She a cougar, got a little age on me
But I'm experienced, that's what she don't know, homie
The same old, same old, starting to feel different
Anytime, any place, baby, I'm with it
Don't stop get it, get it
Collapse, relax then get right back with it

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah that's the shit
Yeah that's my bitch

I got a new bitch in the U.K
My paper's straight, I'm okay
I just got back, nigga, today

[Outro]
50, you fucking with the #1 nigga now
You know, I'm international, Jack
You understand what I'm saying, nigga?
Anywhere around the globe

When I cock that and pop that you gon' understand what I'm saying
