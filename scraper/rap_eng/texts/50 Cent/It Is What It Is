[Intro: 50 Cent]
Som' for the hood, ya know, yeah
Nuttin' crazy, little som' som'
Yeah, 50 Cent, G-Unit Radio

[Verse: 50 Cent]
I sit and twist the lye just to get high
Niggas is gon' die, why ask why?
Homie, it is what it is, I handle my biz
I put that on my kid, I don't forget I heard you
Bullet shell in ya wig, hollow tip from my sig
Leave a hole in you bigger than BIG
Nigga you dead, I know where Nori live, you live by Nori crib
You talkin' all that shit, nigga you better move your kids
Sucka tell Tony, don't you fuck me you little monkey
Irv, whatchu talkin' jackass, you fuckin' little donkey
You lied to Suge, then you lied to Prince
You got 'em thinkin' I won't pop niggas and elephants
I spoke to Scarface, I spoke to Bun B
They gave me their blessings, they said: "man get your money, man we ain't call you snitch, man we ain't mad you rich, man keep on makin' hits, and fuck that other shit"
Could it be that you mad? jealous a nigga holding?
G-Unit Records, Radio, G-Unit clothing
G-Unit films, G-Unit books
G-Unit sneakers, I'm off the hook

[Outro: 50 Cent]
G-Unit man, G-Unit video games, G-Unit everything man
When, every magazine stand you walk by you're gonna see me
Every time you turn on your TV, you're see me
The award show, you're gonna see me
You know, I'm gonna pick up everything they give to a new guy:
Best New Artist, Best New Single, Best New Album, you know
You know what I mean, and you can just keep on making your little punk music
La-la-la-la, your McDonald's commericals
McDonald's apple pie, love the way you make me feel
Number two, super size, love the way you make me feel
M.I.K., 50 Cent, Murda Inc Killa
I heard about your show too, your show ain't nothin' but good karaoke chump
Yeah man, but if you wanna learn how to do that you should come check me out you know, The Rock the Mic Tour, 50 Cent, Jay Z
That's what everybody talkin' 'bout in the street, you know what I mean

They ain't feelin' you no more? ha-ha-ha
They ain't feelin' you no more baby?
Aye, you should do another condom commercial, I put the condom on-
