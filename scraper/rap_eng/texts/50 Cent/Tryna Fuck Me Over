[Intro: 50 Cent]
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I ain't gon' let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touched me, I got that thirty on me (you better watch your step)
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over, (you better watch your step) y'all always tryna fuck me over

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Niggas around me, yeah, they hit licks
Mix a little red and yellow when they get lit
Tryna turn up with a bad bitch
Have her in the telly doing freak shit (you better watch your step)
Niggas sell a little bit of everything
Rockin' Yacht-Master and the pinky ring
Flexing like "bitch, if you knew better"
You fuck with a real nigga and you do better (you better watch your step)
Shawty ass fat like she a stripper
That wiggle when she walk make you wanna tip her
Bartenders coming, yeah, they move quicker
Twenty, thirty bottles to the rich niggas
Everything cool when I'm in the room
Come with two shooters, not a hunnid goons
Nigga, don't trip, you don't want that
Boy, you gonna fuck around and get your ass capped (you better watch your step)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I ain't gon' let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touched me, I got that thirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over, (you better watch your step) y'all always tryna fuck me over

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Right before I came into this bitch hot
Needed cigarettes, I made a pit stop
Spent my life tryna be a good guy
Still people want to see me get got
Nothing like it ever was before
Hair falling out, I'm twenty years old
Got a lot of stress, that you don’t know
Still kick it like paint and this shit gold (you better watch your)
Ayy, pull up in this bitch and I’m flexing
Jumpin' out the motherfucking Benz, yeah
All these damn diamonds on my necklace
Catchin' frostbite when I exit
So goddamn cold, see your breath, yeah
Hundred cigarettes then I exhale
Thousand for these fucking Margielas (you better watch your step)
Hundred thousand chains on my chest, yeah
Ice on my rings, ice, yeah, you see me shining
Two hunnid K in jewels this year, you can't tell me nothing
And I'm gone, I ain't never sober
Me and Fifty got shooters, if you tryna fuck me over, ooh (you better watch your step)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I ain't gon' let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touched me, I got that thirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over (you better watch your step)
I ain't gon' let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touched me, I got that thirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over (you better watch your step)
