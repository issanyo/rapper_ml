[Intro: Troy Ave]
Bang, bang, BSB Gang, you heard it? Got 'em

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Why these niggas frontin'? They gon' make me slow
I ain't never frontin', run down and dump 'em
You ain't really tough, you a bluff, nigga
Our bitches roll hotter than you sucka niggas

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
I'm gettin' money, you should do the same

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Chillin' in my crib, whippin' coco
Just me and my dawg, it's a fo' fo'
Then I get a call like, "What up, bro?" ("Hey, what up?")
We found out where he live, got the whole dough (Word?)
Lay up on his flo', spray 'em on the flo'
A nigga blowin' smoke, ain't no neighbors saw (I don't know)
Tell a friend, he tell a friend, small issue, all issues
I'm big on revenge, nigga

[Hook]
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
I'm gettin' money, you should do the same
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
I'm gettin' money, you should do the same

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Nigga, you talkin’ like you just moved a couple bricks
Yeah, them Brooklyn niggas do be 'bout that bullshit
I got a couple shooters ridin’ with a couple straps
Ten shots a piece, we don’t need more than that
Since a shorty I had drama with all kind of niggas
Squashed the beef, then doubled back so I could line the nigga
He just moved to that spot, how they find that?
Get the drop, let it pop, niggas, time that

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
I'm gettin' money, you should do the same
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
I'm gettin' money, you should do the same

[Verse 4: Troy Ave]
People say I sound like Fif, okay dummy
I guess I sound like I'm just gettin' money
Let me check, yup, money I got
I made it off the block to a Bentley drop
Whippin', sellin' powder, now I got the power

[Verse 5: 50 Cent]
100k an hour, my paper stack like a tower
Stripper bitch, she shake it, she shake it, I make it shower
The fucks you wanna fly, we shoot the shit out a coward
Come on

[Hook: Troy Ave]
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
I'm gettin' money, you should do the same
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
Bang, bang, BSB the gang
I'm gettin' money, you should do the same
