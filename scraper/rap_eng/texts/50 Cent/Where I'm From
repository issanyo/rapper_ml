[Chorus: 50 Cent]

In my hood when you young
You tuck and handle your biz nigga
Comin from where I'm from, where I'm from
Stick up kids will run up in your mamma crib nigga
Comin from where I'm from, where I'm from
Oh this is some lil shit niggas 'll split ya fuckin wig nigga
Comin from where I'm from, where I'm from
Expect no commissary when your ass doin your bid nigga
Comin where I'm from, where I'm from

[Verse 1:Lloyd Banks]
I'm from New York City
Eyes on the prize
Dodging the worm
I'll fry your head like a project perm
Bullets burn
My right hands in the urn
How the hell did I deserve to be placed in a situation where nobodys concerned?
Cursed the coward that's bragin and didn't clap they mark
He deserve a beating faster than a fat mans heart
I play my part well respected
Every minute every second
You'll put a dent in your budget bugging me for a record

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:Young Buck]
Cashville is where I call home
There's noone to call on
It's every man for himself
I come from the bottom
I been the nigga behind the trigger and been in front of the bullet
But where I'm from we don't think about it we pull it
Crips and bloods in Cali they got these country niggas bangin
Ain't no more hangin
Nigga what set is you claimin
Round here money ain't comin like it used to be
Cuz these teens killin fiends over half a g

[Chorus]


[Verse 3:Game]
West side Compton motherfuckers
Nigga this three wheelin ass scrapin
100 spoke gold daytons
Home of the Lakers
We ridin dubs like Payton
Bandana 45 cock it back hollow tips gon'a fly
You bitch niggas go run and hide
It's nwa till the day I die
Purple haze I get high
Were the beef at I'm ready to ride
Allstar game don't come outside
Little drama and it's gonna be a homicide
Lowridin through the cpt banks ridin shotgun
Buck in the backseat, g-unit pop sumthin

[Chorus]
