[50 Cent]

It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right
It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right
Everybody know that

[Verse 1]

Doin' good in front of niggas in the hood cause problems
Trey-eights, trey-pounds and .44's solve 'em
I hate when hoes get on some loudmouth shit
Your man gangsta? Me too
Go on and get 'em bitch
I just bought new toast to spit
Next nigga gettin gully gettin' laid out quick
Where ever rich touchin' niggas is gettin hurt
Cause a broke nigga always down to put it in work
Don't run up on me, I don't know you nigga
So what you bought my cd, I don't owe you nigga
I know you love the way the goutti beat bump
Got you license plate rattlin' all over your trunk
I confuse these chumps with my style, yo
I'm from Queens but I'm mother fuckin BK hard
I sound like I move bricks uptown
Or like a thug from the Bronx who stays with a 4-pound
Shook nigga (shook nigga, shook nigga)
I'm a Guiness Book nigga

[Hook 2x]

We don't play that pussy shit 'round here
You can get your fuckin wig split down here
Don't be reppin' where you come from too much around here
You can get your fuckin cap filt

Queens, nigga!
Brooklyn

[Verse 2]

If I can't get my gun in the club, why whould I come in the club?
So niggas I done stuck up could cut me he fuck up, nah
I'm outside to jump off in a Benz jeep
4 deep strapped with all kinds of heat
Niggas think they want beef
They don't want beef
They find out that somebody they love (is) layin' in the street
When you rap, you keep it gangsta dog it's all good
Just don't go poppin that shyit in the wrong hood
Where I'm from the young boy'll come and try ya nigga
Shell will make ya feel like your on fire nigga
If you thinkin we thirsty cuz, we right
We lookin at your watch and chain like that's an S-type
Promoter sayin "don't play 50 in the club"
Last time it came nigga tore the shyt up (what)
I don't where you from and I don't care
But nigga we don't play that pussy shit round here

[Hook 2x]

The only Spanish I know is "coño, cállate la boca puta",
"no inglés, no inglés" motherfuckers will shoot ya'
The Latin Kings don't like me, I don't care
We don't talk that "mira, mira" bullshit around here
Man, I done did so much dirt in the hood
Niggas heard I got shot they was all sayin 'good'. ("Good for him")
Fuck ya'll, ya' ain't got to like me
I'm gettin knocked, ya'll nigga ain't got to write me
I'm on the same bullshit I been on
It's the same bullshit ya' niggas need to get on
Y'all shit sound too commercial
Come cruisin' through the hood mother fuckers will hurt you
You should know when and when not to flash jewels
Cause niggas will run up on y'all fools and flash you
They want your money, the watch, and you tennis shoes
"I ain't gotta tell ya not to move
Ya know the rules!"

[Hook 1x]
