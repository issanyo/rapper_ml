She work it girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she about the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money money, she makin' makin'
Look at the way she shakin'
Make you want to touch it, make you want to taste it
Have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it
She's so much more than you're used to
She know's just how to move to seduce you
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop

She always ready, when you want it she want it
Like a nympho, the info
I show you where to meet her
On the late night, till daylight the club jumpin'
If you want a good time, she gone give you what you want

Baby it's a new age
You like my new craze
Let's get together
Maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me

I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me

In her fantasy, there's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin'
Sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she's ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
What should I do, one thing on all fours
Now that that shit should be against the law
Different style, different move
Damn I like the way you move
Girl you got me thinking about
All the things I do to you
Let's get it poppin' shorty
We can switch positions
From the couch to the counters of my kitchen

Baby this a new age
You like my new craze
Let's get together
Maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me

I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
She wants it, she wants it
She wants it, I got to give it to her
She wants it, she wants it
She wants it, I got to give it to her
I got to give it to her

Baby this a new age
You like my new craze
Let's get together
Maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me

I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
