[Intro]
They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and I stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown, nah
They will never ever take my crown, nah
They will never ever take my crown, nah

I'm still shit, I meet y'all ready
Fuck around will be reading your obituary
My whip clean, my watch gleam
9 karats ho, that's what I call a pinky ring
Don't even trick, my heart cold
I'm round the globe, I'm on parole
I ball hard, I go hard
They say I'm grimy, up to no good
Oh god
Shawty work that, we should work that
She a canna, she damn close to perfect
I might want stunt, throw a hunned racks
Get my man strapped, he gonn get my money back

I'm ghetto right, I'm super hood
I'm shitting on these niggas like they knew I would
I'm ghetto right, I'm super hood
I'm shitting on these niggas like they knew I would

Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things get better when they thought it would be worst
Here comes the officer asking for ah search
They found no weapons just only a draw first
They found no weapons just only a draw first
They found no weapons just only a draw first

Gram after gram, time after time
I got the grind
I can't help it, I gotta shine
I do it big, you stupid big
I could fit like half the projects in my crib
You stick around, I'm outta here
You on the ground, I'm in the lear
I love yachts, a 9 boats
Either way, come a nigga got you picking dough
They done made me mad, now I'm in my bad
And I'm back with the strap catch a case be the case
Rich nigga swag
Every step I take, every lil itsy bitsy move I make
Turn the big bags a birthday cake
I can even fit this shit in my safe
Wait!

Got more money coming, try not to hate
Why you think a nigga in and out a state?
I'm a pro, I'mma go when I operate
I get the bread, I blow the bread
I'm flashing, I'm shining
I get the bread, I blow the bread
My bitches, my diamonds

Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things get better when they thought it would be worst
Here comes the officer asking for ah search
They found no weapons just only a draw first
They found no weapons just only a draw first
They found no weapons just only a draw first
