[Intro: 50 Cent]
I'm focused man
You should know this man

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me; I handle my business
Any city any town - touch down; I do my thing
I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a great conversationist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache an stress you done been through before

[Verse 2: Ciara]
It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

[Pre-Hook: Ciara]
That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

[Hook: Ciara]
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

[Verse 2: Ciara]
So when I had a good guy he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
Now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk we don't hear what they say

[Pre-Hook: Ciara]

[Hook: Ciara]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
The more I get, the more my ambition; tell me there's more
I'll move an eighth for that girl; I'll move a half for that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby you should take me as I am
An be happy you're my girl cause I'm happy I'm your man

[Bridge: Ciara]
If he gets caught, it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy I promise I will be there for you
All my heart it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy I just can't leave you alone

[Hook x2: Ciara]
