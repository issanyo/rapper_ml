[Intro]
She loves me, she loves me not
Yeah, she loves me not

[Verse 1]
The fiends need me, I ain't around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now you tryin' to leave me, you never live without me
Girl I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess, stick it in, relapse
I'm back bitch, don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

[Hook]
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[Verse 2]
Baby you know, on the low, ya sister been eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know soon she be tryin' me
Heard she bi-sexual, she fuck what that girl
But boy, oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing
Kurt Cobain, we were good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this ain't new
I live the lavish life, listen if the mood is right
Me you and ya sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, if you hyper I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, your reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV
I love you, love me back, no one said lovin' me be easy

[Hook]
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[Verse 3]
I love you, I got you bare footed on glass, chasin a dove
That monkey on ya back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me bitch, you sit there and listen to them
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up when you down, then they got nothin' to say
But when you call up, I come runnin', I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down, they crowned you prom queen
They know bout me behind your back, call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you
Push me inside you, no other man can love you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

[Hook]
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be
