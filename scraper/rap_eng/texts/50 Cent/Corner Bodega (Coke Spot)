[Intro]
Aight, check this shit out
Y'all niggas gon' stay in the car
Imma go and handle this shit
Gimme ten minutes, If I don't come out, y'all come in
The money stays in the car 'til I say so... word up
Aiyyo, whattup whattup, man
This is what y'all niggas is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram?


[Verse 1]
Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I can go Uptown and get this shit 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
Got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some "get this money" shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DEA I sold dope in VA
My coupe stay in Queens but the plates read VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it ain't hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on consignment
(Hey, times is hard man) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'mma kill Guiliani
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes

[Hook]
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man


[Outro]
Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
That means I copped and I went outta town
You motherfuckers know how I get down
I'm bout my money man, I'm bout my money man
