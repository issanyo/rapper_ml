[Intro: 50 Cent]
I return, stronger than ever

[Hook]
I get the creepin´ in the crowd [?] so [?] get the fallen
Now we can hit them with the clipper wicked 38 revolver
Then niggas understand what I'm sayin when I'm sayin I'm all in
So if you fuck em with the police you niggers better call

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Dial 911, tell them I got a gun
I come through, put that pressure on them
Wear that Smith & Wesson on them
Damn it I came I cop [?] see a lot
Six shot body rock and they drop burning hot
Bleed nigga bleed till you start feeling cold
You know you niggers really don't serve a purpose
Less unless you learn to follow all these then become workers
If you ask me you're just taking up space
I won't hesitate to smack fire at your face

[Hook]
I get the creepin´ in the crowd [?] so [?] get the fallen
Now we can hit them with the clipper wicked 38 revolver
Then niggas understand what I'm sayin when I'm sayin I'm all in
So if you fuck em with the police you niggers better call

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Dial 911, tell them I got a gun
I don't give a fuck, I'm also stop
Hide in a burf, 50 put they in work
I cut clean through your face, see your teeth through your cheek
Seconds before you start to leak all over the street
Nigga your people is pussy I mean your homies is stun
It's a good time to run before I get to my gun
I hit the ashes that you see them I strip hop and the dash
Hit the corner out the window, boy I pop at your ass

[Hook]
I get the creepin´ in the crowd [?] so [?] get the fallen
Now we can hit them with the clipper wicked 38 revolver
Then niggas understand what I'm sayin when I'm sayin I'm all in
So if you fuck em with the police you niggers better call

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Dial 911, tell them I got a gun
50 till it's nothing left
I'ma keep going till there's nothing left
Call this 13 out of 13 motherfuckers, hahaha
I'm just playing with you niggas man
When y´ll all hear what I got, oh my god, hahahaha
I can feel it, the earthquake is coming
Tsunami, damn
