[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Now that I'm back, you hear more hits
Records ain't sellin'; download this
Look at my neck; look at my wrist
The world is my pussy; life is my bitch
Make money, money
Take money, money, money
My shoes are [?] made
You Bathin' Ape money, money
I'm out-of-state, getting great big money, money
In the projects, getting late-night money, money

[Bridge: Tony Yayo]
Freeze!
Now all the ladies report to the dance floor
And make sure homie got a bottle

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pass it, pass, pass the patron
Shorty thick; I can tell from the front
Pass it, pass, pass the patron
Pass it, pass, pass the patron
Pass it, pass, pass the patron
Shorty thick; I can tell from the front
Pass it, pass, pass the patron
Pass it, pass, pass the patron

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Bring it back; bring it back
Shorty face a'ight, but her ass real fat
Blow a stack; blow a stack
More bottles of ros√©; she like, "What's that?"
I'm a baller, shot caller
Bumblebee Camaro; I can transform ya
First night, damn right, I'm a spoil her
Take her to the Ritz cause her projects is smaller

[Bridge: Tony Yayo]
If you getting money put your bottles high up in here
Yeah!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
God damn, [?]
Red bottoms on my feet look like velvet cake
I'm straight; I look like an [?]
I hit the strip club and pull 10 out the safe
Niggas hate; bitches hate
But they ain't got no money, so we can't relate
Make it shake; ma, make it shake
Now it's off in my Porsche with the temporary plates

[Bridge: Tony Yayo]
Shout to all the bad chicks with they hair done
They nails done, buyin' they own bottle

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
