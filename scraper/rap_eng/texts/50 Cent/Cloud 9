Its more mental then physical
Its more then sexin we gotta connection
Be my angel and ill be your protection
If you grind when i grind when i shine i see to it you shine
Im all ears tell me whats on your mind
If you feel like i feel its real if im gettin ahead of myself tell me chill
But if you let me touch ya i could touch ya how you need to be touched
Keep talkin to me gurl and im gon be the one that you trust
Ill bring them candles bring them roses and them boxes of candie
You bring them sorted flavored condoms and them edible panties
Yea im street but im discreet baby I can keep a secret
You can show me what you hidin in them victoria secrets
Gotta hold slow so you know I listen to marvin lets get it on
I take it off for you no problem you can call when you need baby
And we can pass time on that cloud with the silver line numer nine

Olivia:
I was raised in a way where the time was the day was to play hard to get babe
But then it changed suddenly man you came and took my breath away
Iwas caught in a vine at a time in the night where my life was'nt right babe
But then again suddeny suddenly you came and I was swept away

Ooh like a bird I just fly cuz im free
Free to laugh free to love free to be
No rain comes down on me
This is whats happenin

La la la la la la la
Floatin all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la la
High everynight from your light
La la la la la la la
Floatin all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la

Olivia:
Now this can't be a phase it runs through my viens
So I can't get it out of me its so complete
Its makin me feel like im the only one that it is
So i dont care where we lay anytime of the day any way it don't matter babe
This unexplanable feeling its so soul healing
And i want it all over me

Ooh like abird i just fly cuz im free
Free to laugh free to love free to be
No rain comes down on me
This is whats happenin

La la la la la la la
Floatin all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la la
High everynight from your light
La la la la la la la
Floatin all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la

Olivia:
I like to lay around in the sun spendin time
Sip on moses on a quite evenin night
Get away on a trip catch a flight
When yo say to me Im the only one you need
I let you taste my body spot just to tease
Iwanna sing while you kiss all ova me
Ooo la la

La la la la la la la
Floatin all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la la
High everynight from your light
La la la la la la la
Floatin all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la
