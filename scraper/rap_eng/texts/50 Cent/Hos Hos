[Eminem]
What the fuck?
Ayo, Whoo Kid, run that shit back
God damn

[Intro: Young Buck & 50 Cent]
Yeah, I like to shout out my nigga 50
You know, for introducing me to so many celebrity hoes, homie
These hoes love me, my nigga
I want you to meet this new bitch
Look my fucking phone ringing right now
Who is this? Monica? Trina? Some fucking god damn bitch

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Somebody Cali bitch, the gangsta hoes not the average
Have a nigga feeling like, I'm gonna mary this
And you don't know how many kids she done have with this
But, I gotta thing for my down South hoes
Pussy stay wet and their mouth stay cold
Turn that ass around girl, touch your toes
Throw it back to me, let me hear you holla OH!
Your man ain't nothing like me
7 figga nigga, still in a white T
Pimp the game, like the homie Ice-T
10 years, ain't no telling where I might be
Do it for the money, you can keep the fame
I'd rather be a rich nobody, then broke with a name
Chinchilla with a Cardi F Frame, wreck the range
But ain't a damn thang change

[Chorus: Young Buck & 50 Cent]
Trying to fuck with these Hoes
Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes
We trying to fuck with these Hoes
Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes
We trying to fuck with these Hoes
Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes
We trying to fuck with these Hoes
Everybody on the count of three, let me hear you holla P.I.M.P
We work them Hoes

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Ho stroke first and I stroked her even faster
Had her in the telly with her ass up
You know the 21 questions that I asked her
Had her feeling good man, I gassed her
Soon as we were done, there was laughter
You know damn well her daddy ain't a pastor
Seen her at the college and I asked her
If she wanted to roll after her class done
Came through picked her up in my Aston
Martin Vanquish drop with the glass up
Told her how i hustle, got my cash up
She saw the ice on my wrist I like to flash uhh
When it comes to getting bitches I'm a master
But when it comes to trickin' I'm the last to
Break bridge, don't believe me nigga, ask her
She'll tell you I'm stingy as hell with these Hoes

[Chorus: Young Buck & 50 Cent]
Trying to fuck with these Hoes
Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes
We trying to fuck with these Hoes
Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes
We trying to fuck with these Hoes
Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes Hoes
We trying to fuck with these Hoes
Everybody on the count of three, let me hear you holla P.I.M.P
We work them Hoes

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, It's big pimping going on
We trying to fuck with these Hoes

Aww man, we known internationally right now
We overseas nigga, In Dubland, Ireland, Naa mean?
I asked a nigga, if he knew Fat Joe
He said "Yeah, you mean the man from the pizza shop around the corner?"
I said "Nah, not that Fat Joe. Was talking about the Rap"
He's like "Nah Nah, we don't know him. We know you 50"
You know, so sign autographs HAHA
So I sign autographs, man go back to the hotel
And fuck with these Hoes HAHA
Yo, play it back one more time
