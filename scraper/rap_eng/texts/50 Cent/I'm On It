[Hook]
I’m on it
I blow a hundred million, make another hundred mil, bitch
I’m on it
I hustle hard, oh my God, look at me I’m so rich
I’m on it
My swag on a hundred, yeah that fly shit I want it quick
I’m on it
I’m always on point, man I make niggas so sick
[Verse 1]
I’m chin chillin, crystal spillin’
Hip hop’s villain cause I’m making a killin’
Niggas wanna try me, I’m strapped with the lammy
If Jay’s Illuminati, what am I, am I Bugatti?
Lodi Dodi, we like to party
Big 4 in the morning, go outside and catch a body
I ball full time nigga this is not a hobby
If you don’t know about me, better ask somebody
Yeah, I’m grimey, my wrist so shiny
My Audemars, I blew a mil, I’m back to making money
My swag make her want me, why else would she be on me
I bet she hardly want me? I think she want to blow
Lick me like a lolly, lick me like a lolly
Her ass ain't all that but her tits like Dolly’s
Give me that punani, give me that punani
Now this is motivation make me want more money

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got it, black card in my wallet
Find me on locations with model bitches are spotted
Fly shit I rock it, Tom Ford, exotic
Bitches on my dick now that I moved up out the projects
One for the money, two for the show
I’m ghetto like a mothafucka, what you didn’t know?
Took threes for my niggas gettin’ 8 hundred an O
Kush burn slow, I burn dough
And sip Merlot like I’m on furlow
Fresh up out the pen, I’m back at it again
Thumpin’ like the system in my new big body Benz
Look I’ma Fat Joe, my neck glow
The lights hit the ice, its a special effects show
Tinkle twinkle little star, no one here knows who you are
Me I’m so big, notorious you dig
The paper’s no problem when you're fucking with the kid
