[Verse 1: 50 Cent & Young Buck]
All I hear is Jimmy want my shit to flop, Dre don't care if I blow
Goddamn, all this from fucking selling headphones
Chris died, Theo didn't show up to a nigga wake
Which indicate the team I thought we built, it was fucking fake
Barry's drunk, Barry dump, Barry's in the pen again
I'm back at the drawing board, somebody call Eminem
These days can't believe what you hear on the street
That nigga said he owned the team, he only owned a seat
That's fool's gold we sold to you fools, I watch you buy it
What's this here some kind of new hustle, I might try it
This flow got us all put on so I know I'm nice
Fucking with the wrong bitches got me cold as ice

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Young Buck]
These niggas'll change on you (wooooo!)
I can't keep count of how many times I done watched them change on me
Shawty changed on me
It's the Unit, ain't nothing changed, yeah
Now they hate everything I do
I can't help but win, I'm a winner, nigga, you changed on me
Niggas'll change on ya, damn
Bitches'll change on ya

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd & Young Buck]
Uh, guess I gotta stop posting all this money on Instagram
They welcome you with open homes and open hands
I ain't rich like 50, I just know the man
Red emoji faces in your text, I know you mad
Pitch me a few dollars, more than sure you can
When you balling the world's on your shoulder pads
I don't owe you nothing, they busting, you ain't bang back
You never fronted me nothing I couldn't bring back
They gave dap, now they saying you never gave back
You never gave me nothing I couldn't pay back
Now you talking to the Feds because you ain't fed
Give a nigga a foot, they want your whole leg
Ay Kidd... fuck what he said, tell 'em get his own bread
If niggas got a problem (that's a code red)
That's when niggas pull up with long dreads
Bumbaclot, man, shooting at your forehead
Buck, buck, buck, buck, brrrrrrrrrrah!

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Young Buck]
These niggas'll change on you (wooooo!)
I can't keep count of how many times I done watched them change on me
Why you change on me
It's the Unit, ain't nothing changed, yeah
Now they hate everything I do
I can't help but win, I'm a winner, nigga, you changed on me
Niggas'll change on ya
Bitches'll change on ya

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks & Kidd Kidd]
They say family's first, but family is the first to get you hurt
And these hoes even worse, all these riches is a gift..
..and a curse
Hate running all through the tree, thought they be rooting for me
Backstabbing, lies stacking, the truth is gory
Forever holding on the grudges from my early struggles
They see you go out and get it then want it from you
Say you'll never be a winner, show up at your parade
Outside showing you smiles, inside hoping it fades
Rather be low now, money over the stage
Sanity over fame, eye-candy calling your name
But it changes, their love is dangerous, fog up your aim
It's, a million ways to hit them cages shit's contagious
Forget my favors, I'm outta' here, flipping pages
You slipping backwards going with all the other actors

[Verse 4: Tony Yayo]
The limelight is hot, I ain't ask to be here
The money and the power make problems disappear
People change like the weather
I weather the storm until it's better (better)
And these fake ass niggas wanna shake my hand
Instagram hoes backstage with fans
And the snakes in the grass ain't a part of my plans
Stab me in my back and they say I changed

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Young Buck]
These niggas'll change on you (wooooo!)
I can't keep count of how many times I done watched them change on me
Shawty changed on me yeah
Now they hate everything I do
I can't help but win, I'm a winner, nigga, you changed on me
Niggas'll change on ya, damn
Bitches'll change on ya

[Outro: Young Buck]
Some of you motherfuckers changed for the worse though
Some niggas change for the better
Some bitches'll just never change, hahaha
Some of these hoes'll never change, man, yeah
