[Verse 1: Choo Biggz]
After the show its the after party, and
We gon' pop some molly
I got a Harlem world chick she love ASAP Rocky
Got a Long Island thing, but she act too snobby
My Brooklyn shawty, she get so naughty
Puerto Rican Mami, he callin' me papi
Project Chick, but her crib too sloppy
Plus the goons in the lobby, they tried to rob me
My QU peice hit me off with my ends low
Said that she love me
I caught her with Winslow
Rockin' that slow bucks my chick in he A right
Pushing that skateboard and reppin' that A-Life
Hit em all, swap meat to the mall
5th ave back to the Saks, Macy's big and tall
2 cute 20 dollar freaks
Jimmy Choo designer sneaks
Don't matter sit back, have a drink

[Hook: Tank]
Tonight i'm gonna party till' the liquor is gone
Shawty got a body I gotta get her home
She's comin' home with me
Duz' she know that I'm a G
Tonight I'm gonna party till' the liquor is gone

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
It's hard to hide, I'm a special kind of nigga
I step in stepping on Giuseppe's with the zippers
That beef I be strapped and it's hammer time
So much ice wrist drippin' Panorama time
Went from the minor leagues, pushin' nickels and dimes
To getting major cheese, I can't help it with the shine
The way she looked shawty might come and try this
Nigga your main bitch better off  my side chick
She wanna shop the way I shop out in the tropics
You want it get it
It's nothing I got it
I get money, blow money, let some bread stack
I can feel it when it's comin' I'm right there where it's at
I got a fortune 500 flow, that's a fact
I had this whole spot jumpin' in here, front to back
It's goin' down
This is how I feel whenever I'm in town
Worldwide I'm flexin
