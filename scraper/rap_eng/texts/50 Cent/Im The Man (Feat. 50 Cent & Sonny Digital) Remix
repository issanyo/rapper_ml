[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We try to make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'mma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'till I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop

[Interlude: Sonny Digital]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

[Verse 2: Tunit Malcom]
I started like nothing on this game
Only god can judge
But this niggas still playing
They keep hate on me
But they stay on the lame
Thats what im saying (hey)

[Bridge: Tunit Malcom]
BItch im the man
Hoe im the man
Bitch im the man
Hoe im the man

When i started this shit
They said boy u can't
But i still ride for my niggas
Since the began
I ride for my niggas
I will die for my niggas
That's vise versa too
Forgi on the shoes
Making the pussy niggas so confused
Giving interviews
I'm being paid by the verses
I did something wrong
But I'm not the last or the first
I hope you did what im saying
Cuz you know

[Bridge: Tunit Malcom]
Bitch im the man
Hoe Im the man
I hope you understand
Bitch im the man
Hoe im the man
Self made since i was a lil man
Bitch i'm the man hoe i'm the man

[Hook: Sonny Digital]
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I'm a bonafide grade A hustler
A1, day 1, they can't touch us
Nigga like me, I be with the shit
Try and stick me I'mma get you hit
Yeah, you know just how I get down
Bad bitches around, they smoking and they drinking
And I'm thinking it can all work out
Seen your bitch back blown out
It's never nothing personal, believe me
I fuck around, your bitch don't wanna leave me
She talking 'bout takin' flights tonight when I'm out of town
Not around, she want me to fly in to put it down
It's nothing to a real nigga, had that ass flying in first class
Cause you seem to be regular, she don't want nothing regular
Turn me on when she talk Spanish, that fat ass
You know I wanna get with it, so lady let's get it

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Looking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now
I got my nine right now
Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now
I ain't fucking around right now
Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that

[Hook: Sonny Digital]
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man you know I'm the man
