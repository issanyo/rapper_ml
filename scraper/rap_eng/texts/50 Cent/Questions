[Verse 1]
No she wanna get involved
Simple lives always coincide
Silly dame wanna play the game
Now we caught up in the overtime
Deep down it was just us
Making love with the seat back
Ride slow while they 5-0
So lost trying keep track
I wanna know the shit that you'd die for
Tell me would I be the kid that you ride for
If I got too stuck and cops pulled up to your crib tell me girl would you lie or
Break down?
Top floor
If I fell would pick me right up again?
Before I invest in you
I got some questions
Would you be my best friend?

[Chorus]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2]
Ay girl you're a master piece
I could be ur Romeo no Master P
Play them throwback jams like 50 cent
Girl it's cold outside you ain't have to leave
You can lay back while I smash the beat
Maybe smash something else, we gonna have to see
Yeah roll them eyes oh you so bad
Quarter white, quarter black, half Japanese
You know I like to mix it up
Shawty why you gotta go I ain't giving up
You know the night is still young so let's live it up
Go pour it out, then sip it up
Shawty roll something, yeah twist it up
I think had too much girl I'm lit enough
Ain't wanna die so can I get a ride home ?
Put it my iPhone, yeah girl me up


[Bridge]
I just wanna chill and feel the vibe
Make love then lay right by your side
You drive me crazy

I got everything you need and I
Like ur smile don't wanna see you cry
Got questions Imma ask you I

[Chorus]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
