[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Wise came home Far Rock edge, man; I figured I'd drop in (WHOOOO!)
Bless him with a lil' short change to go shoppin'! (YEAH!)
Buzzer don't work! - Elevator shitty staircase pissy
His sister ran out huggin' on a nigga, she missed me! (what?)
Momma living room, she sipped Cristy till she was pissy! (whoooo!)
Told 'em niggas tried to blaze me last night but they missed me
In the CL, some niggas wet the driver side door, (uh-huuuh!)
I had my vest on. - I put the fuckin\' pedal to the floor! (AAAAAHHHH!)
Her son facin' her - for a less or tens, he hurtin'
They be hollerin' like: "50, let us put some work in!"
Today's a nice day if tonight's a nice night, - somebody gon' die
It is what it is my nigga; why ask why?!
See? I stay with some s*it in the street
But the niggas Uptown love me like they love Pistol Pete. - You heard me?

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
Haha, haha!
BRAAAAAAAAAAAAATT!
Y'all n*ggas eat that, n*gga!
Live with that!

[Verse 2: Scarface]
I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck bein a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his, and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin
I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me..

[Verse 3: Lloyd Bank$ {50 Cent}:]
I had my eyes on the Mascara, - mami, the Maybelline queen;
Dolce Gabana, Fergano gettin' choked in the sauna. [explosion]
She had a - dot on her face like Madonna, (Madonna!) dressed like she date a designer. (designer!)
Looks so good, I spent a day with her mama. {whoooo!}
Tried to break her, bring her, beat her, eat a plate of lasagna, {uh-huuuuh!}
Grab some paper, bring the heater in case it's haters behind her. {AAAAHH!}
They call me "Bandana Bank$", baby, I clap your homie, homie
Then I'm through with her, - go holla at Macaroni Tony, {TONY YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYO!}
In the back with a few cup of Henny, baggy pants to tuck the semi
In case you get to fuckin\' friendly. - My clique as tough as any! {any!}
Stuntin' plenty, I don't trick a penny; {haha!} get your own shit!
Callin' me with questions will only get you a phone click. - ! (!)

[Hook: Scarface]
I can squeeze without blinkin', I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta
