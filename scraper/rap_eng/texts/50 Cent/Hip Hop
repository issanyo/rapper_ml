[Intro]
WHY HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING!!!
Uh, uh, uh

[Hook]
Nigga I run (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip)
Nigga G-Unit is (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop)

[Verse]
One thing bout my music
It hit you feel the pain
Nigga I’ll take control of your brain
Listen now nigga I’m not playing
Are you ready for that?
Soldier, soldier grab your gat
I show you who to aim it at
Bang, bang, bang run toss the gat
No, no, no, no lookin’ back
Nigga leave the watch
We ain't come for that
Bitch quit playing
Where the paper at
Shit I rolled ace I’m shooting it back
Everybody know how my paper stack
Twenty inch chrome on the Cadillac
Automatic shotgun
Can you handle that?
On the bullshit
Nigga that’s a fact
Ride through the motherfucking hoods strapped
Put work in nigga that’s that
Cocked to bust it and you’ll blast back
Got a little money wanna flash that
Before the wolves come out and blast gats
Pedal to the metal nigga mash that
Before your ass end up in a casket
I said in a casket
Who shot Biggie Smalls?
We don't get 'em
They gon' kill us all
Man Puffy know who hit that nigga
Man that nigga soft
He scared them boys from the Westside'll break him off
Dump on his ass
So he run to Harlem shake 'em off

[Hook]
Nigga I run (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip)
Nigga G-Unit is (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop)
Nigga I run (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip)
Nigga G-Unit is (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop)

[Outro: 50 cent talking]
Oh I guess this means
I won't be invited to the white parties
In the Hamptons
I don't give a fuck
I don't wanna hang out with you punk ass no way
Get me motherfucking running around
This nigga Ma$e
Now you wanna play games
Don't wanna make the deal nigga
Man I'll fuck your shit up nigga
Is you crazy nigga
Matter fact you know what
I don't wanna do the deal no more
Fuck the deal nigga
You wanna play games
You wanna waste my motherfucking time nigga
Time is money nigga
You wasting the motherfucking money nigga
Alright I see what you trying to do
But I don't know why you doing what you trying to do
Why you want to make me tell everybody what Misa told me (huh??)
Now you go on and send me fifty thousand dollars
For this nigga travel fees
You know air fare, hotel space
For that last tour nigga
Or I’ll really service your ass nigga...
