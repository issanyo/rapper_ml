De-stress
You might as well enjoy the drink
There's too much rolling over in the world
2 PM, breakfast in bed
Had a long night, I was in Vegas
At the Bellagio
I had a sweet thing from a bar in place
All in my brain, you're giving me a fever
Put it in, blew it out, body so illegal
She was so phenomenal
Get me, you're beautiful
You pull ups and say
I only met er once, a little marijuana
Money real good but money bringing me more problems
Go and do things, be my Mary Jane
Made a touch in your light, I take it away
Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment
Roll you up, light you up
Show you how I own it
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane
My my my my Mary Jane
So sexy standing in the mirror
Come a little closer, girl I wanna tell ya
Clothes off your body baby
I wanna get high off your love tonight
I want to play the naughty, can you play the last night?
Do it over naughty, be that T and thug life
Just let it rotate
To my lead, everywhere I come so
I only met er once, a little marijuana
Money real good but money bringing me more problems
Go and do things, be my Mary Jane
Take my mind off the stress and the strain
Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment
Roll you up, light you up
Show you how I own it
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane
My my my my Mary Jane
I light it up and let it out slow
I'm gon measure up
Nothing beats this feeling I know
Except the greatest love
One for now and one for the road
Til I come touch er up
When this gonna end I don't know
But now I'm in love with my slow
I only met er once, a little marijuana
Money real good but money bringing me more problems
Go and do things, be my Mary Jane
Take my mind off the stress and the strain
Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment
Roll you up, light you up
Show you how I own it
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane
My my my my Mary Jane
Light it up, pass it around
Burn it up baby, then blow it up
