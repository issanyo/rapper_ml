This is the Unit bitch

[50 Cent]
Nigga this is ground hog day
Back to my indulgence
I’m ill, no Doc, no diagnosis
No cure, I smell fear

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
Nigga my eyes don’t cry, my heart so cold
Lets play, lets make a deal nigga, sell me your soul
Got a fetish for the guns, Calico drums
Rap Meyer Lansky steady counting my wons
Death dealer, Heron, meth dealer
Top biller, point blank, I’m that nigga
Barrell smokin’, fiend smokin’, rims cokin’
Out on that 550 Benz, bitch is open
Inhale, exhale, feel a different high
Andrew McQueen shirt and jeans, this a different fly
Presidential time, nigga watch the flawless shine
No need for pens and paper, this is whats on my mind

[Hook]
I don’t think you should play boy
I don’t think you should fuck with me
I’m shooting right away boy
Find out when you run up on me
I’m riding with that K boy
I put that on my dead homies
I spray it right away boy
Find out when you run up on me

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
When niggas shot me, I must have bled out my conscience
Go ‘head play boy, I bang that thing at you like ronson
I feel for you niggas I’m back now
I told you pussy niggas ’03 I don’t back down
Me still a rookie, nah, I’m more like veteran
I bet ya iPod is full of niggas I’m better than
Magician I make grams turn to cash, kush turn into hash
Head turn into ass, I'm a bum nigga to class
Thats me in a nutshell, run tell I did it
Interrogation hours go on, I won't admit it
Got cash coming out of my ass, I’m so compelling
These niggas act hard till you hit ‘em, they start tellin’

[Hook]
I don’t think you should play boy
I don’t think you should fuck with me
I’m shooting right away boy
Find out when you run up on me
I’m riding with that K boy
I put that on my dead homies
I spray it right away boy
Find out when you run up on me

[Outro]
Now what they gonna say this time? Ha?
That nigga fif 5 out of 5 this year
He on it
I'm your favorite one day
And then you just turn your back on me
Ha?
Don't trynna get back down with niggas and won't see shit shift
Cause I'm on it
These niggas got sucka traits, man
I'm watchin' em
It's unbelievable, un fucking believable, man
So you mean to tell me
I'm the motherfucking culture guy, eight years straight
And then niggas gon' act like
The gift god given me is gone
Fuck you, niggas
Fuck that
Turn that shit off
