[Intro]
The Giants play in New York, Forbes, 1, 2, 3

[Chorus]
I get money, money I got (I get it)
Money-money I got, money-money I got (I run New York)

[Interlude: Diddy]
You know what it is, aww man
It's the billion dollar remix, baby, for reala

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Come on man, I'm hot now, drop now, top down I got style
Been around the block pal imagine what I got now
The Bentley the Ferrari, maybe the Bugatti
Range and Maserati, I got 'em all, goddamn
My money, my-my-my money, long
I blackout and break a bat on your ass like Barry Bonds
I get it, I'm down for the jooks now what's up
I'm with it, I told you I was gon' cake up
I did it, niggas tryna show me how to ball
Man, they tryna buy some Gucci, I'm tryna buy the mall
I ain't came to get a little bit I'm tryna get it all
My new bitch a cool bitch I'm fitting to make her spoiled
If my watch is right, my stocks is right
But don't be shocked tonight, if you get shot tonight
Still gutter like a mothafucka, chipped up
Don't be surprised when I grip up, you slip up you could get it

[Chorus]
I get money, money I got (I get it)
Money-money I got, money-money I got (I run New York)

[Interlude: Diddy]
A lotta money on this record man, I like being around money man
It's three the hard way baby, you know my mothafuckin' name

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Bo knows but Diddy did it
Cars, jewelry and big homes, yeah, Diddy did it
Shootouts, coastal beefs, yeah, Diddy did it
But my lawyer's so good that Diddy got aquitted
I met J. Lopez out in St. Tropez
While you was riding around in Miami on mopeds
Oh, you just got here
I been doin this shit for over ten years
I am chilling, in Sean John denim
Nigga I don't walk nowhere I'm four wheeling
Champagne spilling, chilling, no ceiling
Stealing a quarter million, feeling, ice grilling
Hit the avenue, earthquake up the morgue
Give Jacob a call then make a withdrawal
Face on the Forbes in '94 I did it
Don't like it I'm a Bad Boy now let's get it come on!

[Chorus]
I get money, money I got (I get it)
Money-money I got, money-money I got (I run New York)

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
I get the pounds, the pesos, the yen
I celebrate and I'm fresh out the pen
I'm a hustler, I'm back at it again
I'm bad and I don't play pretend, fuck with 'em, Jay

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm a hustler baby, can't escape my past
When I flipped Rocawear, I told 'em: 'Give me mine in cash'
Yeah, checks might bounce
Alphabet boys might check my accounts
Still hustling baby, hurry up, kill me
I'm already the GOAT, next stop is the billi
Young turbo, six speed 9/11
I'm revving I'm trying not to spill my merlot
When my girl go on world tour
Ladies I'm back on the street like I'm out on a furlough
I'm back clubbing, Ace of Spades bubblin'
Drink it from the bottle, who the fuck need a bucket?
I'm killing the block, multiple whips
So I'm killing the roof, like Michael Vick
Yeah! Just call me Forbes.com
In case y'all forget New York is still mine, I get it

[Chorus]
I get money, money I got (I get it)
Money-money I got, money-money I got (I run New York)

[Outro: Jay-Z]
You talking my language now baby
I wouldn't wanna be outside the borough on this one
