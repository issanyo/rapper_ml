[Intro]
Yo whats up it’s the kid 50 cent this is new shit right here on thisis50.com exclusive
You got me feeling crazy them a motherfucker
Remember where u heard it first

[Hook]
Play this on the radio (hell no)
Play this on the radio (damn nigga)
Play this on the radio (what the fuck u say?)
Play this on the radio

[Verse 1]
First they say that faggot hot, then they let that junkie shot
Keep all them fucking trophies, tell me where the fuck is mine?
I'm back on the underground, back where I belong now
Showed you how I felt then, this is how I feel now
Focus on my lyrics now, I'm having a melt down
I don’t wanna sip tea or chit chat on your sofa
Bitch I ain't Jay-Z: fuck you, Oprah
Suck dick deepthroat and gag, now I'm mad
You don’t like hip-hop, then we don’t like your ass
Fuck the award shows don’t even mention my shit
I'm the hottest nigga on the net, they can't censor my shit
I say what the fuck I wanna say I don’t been through some shit
Look shit, damn, cocksucker, punk bitch motherfucker
Play this on the radio, play this on he radio
Faggot, ho, slut, cunt, suck a dick, roll a blunt – play this on the radio, play this on the radio
White bitch , black bitch, asian bitch, crazy ho – play this on the radio, play this on the radio
Cracker spit, horny trick, buy a pussy.. see here we go – play this on the radio, play this on the radio

[Outro]
Yeah, turn it up now, so you can hear me
It’s the return of the heartless
Creative monster
Eminem, Dre, 50
Shady Aftermath
Niggas can't tell me nothing, son
I was broke fucked up, now what?
I dare you to say something
I break your fucking neck
Any one of these niggas son
I'm waiting
And I'm on your heels, Mr. Carter
I heard you
You want me to die ugly? Ok..
Don’t end up on the list, nigga
Be a missing person
Like Cam'ron
Like Ja
Like Joe
Who want some?
Who want it? What up?
