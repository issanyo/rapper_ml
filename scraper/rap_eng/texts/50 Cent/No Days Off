[Chorus: Lloyd Banks &  50 Cent]
I came to get somethin', I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin'
Strap like it's legal, ridin around bumpin'
If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em
I never liked these niggas anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a building today
Hey.. Nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I got the burner burner, I come to burn and burn ya
Revolver turn ya, call it murder murder
I ain't smilin' I ain't smirkin', I ain't muh'fuckin' jokin'
See if you think somethin sweet when your head open
Cross me, force me, go 'head, line me up
I found where you rest at, you grimy fuck
I be out front your raggedy-ass crib on a stake-out
With a pound, two clips, and Chinese take-out
You make it rain, I make it lead shower
You say your prayers, you in your last hour
I have you pushin up daisies, the coke dump crazy
You chumps amaze me, the wolves they raised me
You don't like me, spray me

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks &  50 Cent]
I came to get somethin', I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin'
Strap like it's legal, ridin around bumpin'
If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em
I never liked these niggas anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a building today
Hey.. Nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
This is that face down on the floor, ski mask shit
If I fall off, I rebound quick
Like Greg Oden, Tony Yay' I be holdin
German mouths on my hip, cause my wrist be frozen
How these rappers claim Blood and the books is closed?
How these rappers claim cars and they gun don't smoke?
I catch a nigga on his deathbed
And rip the IV out his arm, then jump in Optimus Prime
Dust the yellow Enzo with the Dalvins on
In my bullet-proof Ac', who you stylin on
When the sun is gone, and the wolves come out
You coward-ass niggas bring your jewelry out

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks &  50 Cent]
I came to get somethin', I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin'
Strap like it's legal, ridin around bumpin'
If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em
I never liked these niggas anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a building today
Hey.. Nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
You may have to bring that, ain't nobody trippin'
Shit, niggas is hungry, I ain't nobody chicken
A nigga screw is missin', I'm pimpin', I'm livin'
Nice with the dice, deuce-deuce six'n
Look how the game change, bad for the system
Niggas on game shows, two dudes kissin'
Listen, we're not the same, we're not for fame
The industry's punked out, we're not to blame
These niggas been perpetratin' so long
If they can make it rain, I can make it storm
He's makin' a scene, but I can make him calm
I just got a N.B., that'll break a arm

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks &  50 Cent]
I came to get somethin', I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin'
Strap like it's legal, ridin around bumpin'
If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em
I never liked these niggas anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a building today
Hey.. Nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day
