[Intro]
That pussy so good, so good, so good
A nigga so hood, so hood

[Verse 1]
She like that 50 snatch, that Erykah Badu
Duke, that pussy having niggas saying, “I do”
You know that 50 snatch
That have me throwing bottles at you
Fuck around, I throw them hollows at you
She doin’ it like I like it ‘cause I taught her, I taught her
I keep her on some fly shit, I spoilt her, I oughta
That’s my kinda bitch, I gotta do [?]
[?] her pussy fit me like a [?]
Snap, we break up then come back
Addicted to fellatio, her head game crack
Ooh, I mean it’s all that
No gag reflection, let me push it to the back
Deep throat, that’s why I think she so dope
A nigga fuck with my hoe, a nigga get smoked
[?] them hearts go around my head
Ya dig? You fuck with my hoe, nigga, you dead

[Hook]
That pussy so good, so good
A nigga so hood, so hood
Nigga, you ain’t lyin’

[Verse 2]
I say shit to make a hoe feel good, that ain’t shit to me
I’ll be all fucked I’ll let them get to me
I think I really loved her in another life
I want the bread, nigga, you wanna fuck her, right?
I’m pimpin’, look nigga, I’m pimpin’
Ridin’ in a Rolls, no cane, no spokes
This new girl gon’ make a nigga rich
[?] go on and show ‘em who you with
With that Magnum, you strapped, maybe suck a dick
These bitches fuckin’ for free on some other shit
This is just alternative life
I mean, he’s fuckin’ him, and she’s her wife
They hate it when they see us with ice
I mean wearing designer threads, everything nice
Push that Gucci down to the socks
Rand and watch filled with rocks, watch

Hold up, I started to see shit I couldn’t see
That mean she eat more pussy than me
That hoe a faggot, she suck dick for the bills
But when she get to lickedy lickin' she got skills
[?] emotions and shit, that’s for suckers
We-some, three-some, having motherfuckers
[?] lovin’ bitches, we be both lovin’ bitches
I thought the dime would pop the bitch off
She want a double bag from me, drop the bitch off
Hey, the more the merrier, the friends come in
Like the ends come in, and the Bentley front in

Baby, come over, I got the Effen and the hookah
We can get right tonight, I’m hittin' that pipe tonight
