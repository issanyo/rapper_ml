Drop

[50 Cent]
Put your hands up, put ‘em where my eyes can see
What’s up, you know you wanna party with me
Let’s fuck, we wilding in the place to be
Bitch quit playing
Put your hands up, put ‘em where my eyes can see
What’s up, you know you wanna party with me

[We As Romans]
The sun goes down
The stars come out
And all that counts
Is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I’m glad you came
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down
The stars come out
And all that counts
Is here and now
My universe will never be the same
(I’m glad you came - scream)

Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time
Time is slipping away
Away from us so stay
Stay with me I can make
Make you glad you came

Glad You Came

The sun goes down
The stars come out
And all that counts
Is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I’m glad you came
