[50 Cent]
Uh huh...yea

[Verse 1]
Shorty the Henny got me feeling right
Ya heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night
Ya heard me?
I ain't playing I'm trying to fuck the night
Ya heard me?
Clothes off face down ass up c'mon
Shorty you roll with the winners right
Ya heard me?
You see now me I got my money right
Ya heard me?
I'm tryin to teach you how to play, how the big boys play
When you come around my way
Ya heard me?
Now see the Bentley got the 20 inch chrome
Ya heard me?
You could get in but don't touch the phone
Ya heard me?
Money come money go I know
But everytime I flow it's mo money fa sho
Ya heard me?
In the street niggas sayin I'm nice
Ya heard me?
Watch flooded no more room for ice
Ya heard me?
Niggas be on tv stuntin' hard
And in the hood the same niggas they be gettin' robbed
Ya heard me?
You might hear I get shot but, I don't get robbed
Cause me, I be on my jog
Ya heard me?

(Chorus)
You like it when I back that ass up on you?

(50 Cent)
Ooh, baby I like it, I like it

When I work that ass, that ass

(50 Cent)
Baby I like it, I like it when you put it on me I got a Kool-Aid smile

And baby I like it, I like it

(50 Cent)
Everytime we dance you make it worth my while

And I like it, I like it

[Verse 2]
Shorty if you wanna roll with some ballers you should call us
Im tryna make sure you hear me
Ya heard me?
We rap now we rollin and I'm holdin'
And I'm gonna make sure you hear me
Ya heard me?
I freak off with the video chicks
Ya heard me?
Sweatin' tracks out in back of the 6
Ya heard me?
MTV they gon' play my hits
Ya heard me?
Even though I'm real ghetto and shit
Ya heard me?
I got a g niggas shoot that ace
Ya heard me?
Your ass bettin' I'm gonna cut your face
Ya heard me?
Last thing I need is to catch a new case
I don't know nothing about them high hats but I sell base
Ya heard me?
The city boys trying to kill a kid
Ya heard me?
Shot me up in front of my crib
Ya heard me?
He had the drop I couldn't run from him
Shot in the hand trying to take the fucking gun from him
Ya heard me?
Little homie saying "50 you tough"
Ya heard me?
9 shots just wasn't enough
Ya heard me?

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
Nigga you best be comin' up with my cash
Ya heard me?
Don't make me go and get the Gat out the stash
Ya heard me?
I'll come back and pop one in your ass
Ya heard me?
Don't play wit the money, no not with the money
Niggas get knocked when they start playing games
Ya heard me?
Stop telling the police my name
Ya heard me?
I don't mind givin chicks them tips
Ya heard me?
They let me play with then tits and hips
Ya heard me?
When I come through they know I'm a thug
Out in Atlanta in the gentlemen's club
Ya heard me?
I rap but I'm still selling them o's
Ya heard me?
My man Mike still pimpin' them hoes
Ya heard me?
He said if the ho knew better she'd come through better
And make a pimp more chedder
Ya heard me?

(Chorus)

(50 Cent)
50 make it crazy in the club
I'm speaking clearly so you can hear me
I come through niggas always show me love
I'm speaking clearly so y'all can hear me
Niggas want beef, y'all could see me in the street
I'm speaking clearly so you can hear me
But you better come correct, cause we move around with heat
I'm speaking clearly so y'all can hear me
