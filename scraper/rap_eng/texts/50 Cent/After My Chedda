[Intro]
Yeah, Shout out to Chris Lighty! Violator!
You know how I put it down when I put it down nigga, let's go!

[Hook]
When you frown at me is it because I won't provide for you girl
Your after me cheddar
And you friends they see it to screaming we know what your up to do girl
I'm after my cheddar

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I gave you your style Gucci this Fendi that
Burberry bag shoes and the hat to match
I like the way it look but bitch I ain't buying that
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no more Prada shoes
When I just wanna chill you wanna go out
See me parle with some other chick you wanna show out
You say I'm wrong when I dog yo ass like I should
Now you reminisce about all the time I treated you good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
When you think about me grinding my fans
You either got more than one watch on or it's to much time on your hands
They say behind every good man is a woman
So tash pull up stash the cannon linen
I'll never be your chofuer to the mall
You'll learn to appreciate cd's and posters on the wall
Fatal attractions is mad real
Last bitch I deaded got mad and swallowed 50 Advil's

[Hook]

Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
They say money make the world go round
Material things make a ho go down
I see you in your Prada Gucci and BCBG
Bitch I'm rich but I don't trick on GP
That's 5 dollar dresses and 10 dollar skirts
Bitch play the strip and put in work
Birds wanna have my baby since I signed my contract
Now I got to double up in case the condom snap

[Outro]
Look don't ask me for shit man
I ain't got nothing for you man what?
Bitch what the fuck you mean I can't sing bitch
Bitch I'm Luther Vandross in the shower
G-UNIT!
