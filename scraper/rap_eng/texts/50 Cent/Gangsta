G-g-g-g G Unit!

Everything 'bout you so gangsta
Oh you just so gangsta
Ooh so gangsta
What up gangsta?

[Kiely]
My baby
You know I'm lovin' you style and your gangsta touch
Plus I like the fact that you're kind of rough
I need a thug in my life that will ride, ride, ride
And ride again
Can't complain about the way he lovin' me
And you know I ain't trippin' off your gangsta ways
So can I be your ride or die, for life

[3LW]
I love the way you pull up on them dubs you know
Everything 'bout you so gangsta
Your white tee throwback with the matching hat
Oh you just so gangsta
Every good girl wants a thug in her life
Who can put it down so gangsta
From your head down to your airforce 1s
Boy you know you just so gangsta

[Adrienne]
My baby
You know them other papis ain't got nothin' like you
Can't nobody give me thug lovin' like you
Like in the middle of the night what my body's calling for
Someone to hold me tight
Yeah I know you're bad but you treat me good
Yeah I know you tryna get us out the hood
Gangsta yet a gentleman
And I'm so open for ya

[3LW]
I love the way you pull up on them dubs you know

[50 Cent]
This is for my n***** on the block
Twist and treatin' cigars
For the n***** on lock
Doin' life behind bars
I don't say only god can judge me
'cause I see thing clear
Crook these crackheads and give my black ass 100 years
I'm like paulie from goodfellas, you can call me the don
Like malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switch sides on them
Let n***** ride on me
Would you be down to ride?

[Jessica]
Ain't nothin' pretty 'bout you 'cause you's a thug
Type 2s, wife-beater with a bottle of bud
With ya drop top, 6 4 rollin' on dubs
Be bangin' in the trunk when I'm out in the club
Ain't got no rigs to chain, 'cause ya keeps it hood
And my friends just jealous 'cause you treat me good
When you're rollin' down the block, everyone holla back
What up gangsta?
