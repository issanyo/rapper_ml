[Intro: 50 Cent] & (Jeremih)
Give it to em (give it to em) [x4]

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Don’t do much talking, I just check ‘em with the D
Got ’bout 3, 4 bad, bad bitches in the tub waiting for me
My favorite ho's imported, her name Elize
And she say she got a man, she can’t stand that he’s a zero

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Bitch, I’m the man, I love bubbling
Shorty touch ya, touch ya hands all, all over me
Yeah, no-one will believe
I can get you high as NASA, careful with ya asses

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih] & (50 Cent)
I only want em bad (give it to ‘em)
Whatever's on tab (give it to em)
I’mma spend a little more change at the bar
Tell the DJ to run it back (give it to em)
I'mma give it to em, give it to em (give it to em)
Give it to em, give it to em, give it to em (give it to em) [x3]

[Hook: 50 Cent]
50 Cent got that shit that'll make them (girls go wild, girls go wild)
My shit knock in the club and it make them (girls go wild, girls go wild)
From the front to the back let me kick it (girls go wild, girls go wild)
I got them macking like they rocking to my old shit (girls go wild, girls go wild)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
She want me to trick, I think this pussy one for me
She seen my watch and all the rocks on top of my new pinky ring
Oh, understand I’m out here in these street
Get out of line tryin’ to take mine, I get at you with the heat, boy
Girl, my swag is illsy
Flip a row of Cavalli frames, I blew a couple G’s
Shorty bad, I bet ya she’s a freak
She might bring a friend if she want something to eat

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Smoke purple shit and it slow me down, down, down
I sip brown shit ’till my head spin round, round, round
Shorty says she wants me, you know what’s up
Might pop a pill before we fuck
Basically we all turned up, all the way turned up
First it’s "Fifty, you know you so strong"
Than it’s "Tell me how you go so long?"
"Non-stop, please can we take a break"
She said “I need water, I need water”
I don’t need no crowd round when I’m performing
No TV, no lights, no camcorder
I let the world know I’m a bedroom star
Ya boy a freak, I always go hard

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook x2]
