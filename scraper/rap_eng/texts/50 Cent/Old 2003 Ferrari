[Intro]
{*Lighter flick*}
{*Exhale*}
Yeah, this some good shit
Ooh, this feel like some Wu shit:
I got more Glocks and TECs than you
I make it pop, hit your homie, right next to you

[Hook]
Niggas say they like my old shit
So I'll give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care; it's old
Shit I could flip some old shit
No, I’ll give them some new shit
I’ll just use my old flow

Looky here motherfucker: I’m not playing
Look, look (x2)

[Verse 1]
What's up
It’s '011; why that Maybach a '06? (Huh?)
This nigga boo booed up with my old bitch
I put paper before hoes: thats why I’m so rich (Yeah!)
I paved the way, long dick, now we all fit (Chu-chu!)
Doc check my temperature: Why I’m so cold?
The hood left the left side of my chest froze
I’m more about pimpin', gettin' bank rolls
Sittin' watchin' them trickin' on them stank hoes (Make it rain)
We can share love like, Kanye and Khalifa
From runways in Milan, to big bags of reefer (Wooh!)
She alright for a night, but don’t keep her
Ask Nas, Kelis was the illest ether

[Hook]
Niggas say they like my old shit
So I'll give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care; it's old
Shit I could flip some old shit
No, I’ll give them some new shit
I’ll just use my old flow

Looky here motherfucker: I’m not playing
Look, look (x2)

[Verse 2]
My belt buckle YSL; my denim vintage
My AP all iced out; my shit authentic
My bread come in by the boat load; that's how I get it (Yeah)
The cops come, say: I ain't do it; you know I did it (Aah!)
I ain't trippin’, na-na-na-na I ain't trippin’
I am just putting the clip in
I ain't out the window lickin' bitch (Wooh!)
I am legend, I am lethal with the weapon
I am 50, I’m putting an end to niggas fuckin' with me (Uh)
Yeah, I am back, I am ruler with an iron fist
I am strapped, what y’all niggas going to do with this?
Wordplay all day, they say I got a gift
One shot from the fifth, niggas career shift

[Hook]
Niggas say they like my old shit
So I'll give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care; it's old
Shit I could flip some old shit
No, I’ll give them some new shit
I’ll just use my old flow

Looky here motherfucker: I’m not playing
Look, look (x2)

[Outro]
Yeah, it's 50, I'm back
You won't see me rolling around
Y'all niggas see me, you already know
Don't come and say: What's up
I don't fuck with you
Y'all know I don't fuck with y'all niggas
I'll smack a high-note out one of you niggas
It's business as usual
All we're going to do is get more money, more bread
You hear me?
Watch me though
