[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, nigga, yeah
Yeah nigga, yeah
Yeah nigga

[Hook]
I'm a paper chaser, my Glock I'll fire it
You know what it is
The moment you expired, I handle my biz
I make somethin' outta nothin'
You fuck with the kid
You bound to get shot frontin' (2x)

[Verse 1]
You got that big body Benz, ha
You find the bitch that you want
You just treat her and her friend, ha
You don't fucked up that coke, ha
Them niggas mad as a mothafucker
They finna get you smoked, ha
They outside where you rest, ha
Waitin' with the hammers to put a hole in yo chest, ha
It's hot you wearin' your vest, ha
It's summer time and you can't even go out
Nigga you stressed, ha
They talkin' about you in the hood, ha
They sayin' yo ass can't come around
You sayin' you could, ha
That bitch flip gave you the boot, ha
She ain't fuckin' nigga with you
Cause you ain't got no loot, ha
Ain't nothin' left for you to do, ha
So you back in the hood with your pistol ready to shoot, ha
It won't be long before you dead, ha
Niggas paid me to hit ya I gotta put one in yo head now!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, it's my summer!
Go 'head say somethin', I want you to say somethin'
So I can smacke the fuckin' black off you, nigga
I spit in yo face, faggot
Come through there man, I can't wait, man
Summer time we gon' mash out this year, nigga
I got shooters, oh what I got!
Ya' niggas don't want it with me now, man
What the fuck, man, ya'll now where I come from
They now what turf I was tourin' from
Southside, nigga, ride or be rode on
You know the rules!
Live this summer or die this summer, babe
It's real!
