Nigga don't act like a BITCH! (haha!)
That's why I never love a BITCH! (yeah!)
50 Cent, Too $hort and E-40 say BITCH! (Remix!)
She sucked me off, don't kiss that BITCH!
(From New York to the Bay! - From New York to the Bay!)
Ohh, why? Ohh, why'd you marry that BITCH?

[50 Cent:]
He said he love her mayne, he really think he love her, mayne
She a superfreak, freakier than he understand
She's not the type of girl that you take home to your mother
She's the type you take to the track to come up on sucker
Watch her deep throat! - See her D.P
In and out both holes like it's easy
It's not a big deal, she doin' what she do
She doin' it with everybody, not just you
Hello! (haha!) - I'm tryna put you up on game
You get emotional, then you could get the fuck on, mayne
You buy her everything, you let her treat ya like a trick
Your sugar daddy mentality it make a nigga sick
She ask for it you just run and get it for her
No matter how much you give her, she wants more
I hate to tell you, but you in love with a whore
And chances are if niggas try they gonna score. - Man fuck that bitch! - (Hahaaa!)

That's why I'll never love a BITCH!
50 Cent, Too $hort and E-40 say BITCH!
She sucked me off, don't kiss that BITCH!
Ohh, why? Ohh, why'd you marry that BITCH?

[Too $hort]
I get everything I wanna get
I have some fun with it. - And make her momma trip
Cause if I'm in her life - it's a problem!
A real player's at your girl, you better stop him! (whooooooo-whooooooooo!)
Turn your back on the bitch she ain't actin' right
He hit it way before you now he's back in her life. (haha!)
What'chu gon' do when you lose her?
She got a nigga on the side just to use her! (AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!)
If it's me, I'm parkin at the front door
And you be knockin on her bedroom window
