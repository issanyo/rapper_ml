[Intro: Young Buck (50 Cent)]
"Walk with meeeee..."
Ay if you hear me out there
"Walk with meeeee..."
I get down on my knees every night and say
"Walk with meeeee..."
(Hahahaha, yeah)
"Walk with meeeee..."
I'm going to war, I'm going to WAR!

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
You never know when death's coming, all you hear is gunshots
Lil' kids get to running, old ladies get off the block
Then the Popsicle truck music comes to a stop
Niggas get on the floor with they front doors locked
Syringes and si-rens the only thing on the street
People act like they don't know who did it, but they know it's me
Every day's a death threat, but I ain't dead yet
So I go put a hole in a nigga from the next set
Don't know where I slept at, just know where my TEC at
It's the first of the month, my bitch ain't got her check yet
Juvie left me in California, I don't respect that
I love him too much to beef, so I'ma accept that
But I'ma just step back, and focus on Buck
Tired of riding in yours, I'm 'bout to buy my own truck
Got to try my own luck, "Get Rich or Die Tryin'"
It's G-Unit 'til I'm gone, Lord knows I ain't lying niggas

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
You don't know what I been through to get what I done got
If you looked through a scope, you couldn't hit what I done shot
Couldn't flip what I done copped, couldn't tip what I done topped
I murder you all-talk like a clip without a Glock
When you holla G-Unit on some other shit
You need to do the research, and see who you fucking with
I smoke all your weed up, go run up your Beeza
Your baby momma want me, I don't want that skeeza
She's scratched my Beamer, but I ain't seen-her
When I catch the bitch, I'ma gangsta lean-her - WHOA!
We be playing in them videos, with them pretty hoes
Cashville Ten-a-key bitches and New York City hoes
They learned it from Lil' Kim to let they titties show
I'm the King of the South, this is how it really goes
Lord knows, I keep all my jewels froze
As long as the check come, then FUCK the award shows
You know me nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Half of these kids never read the Bible
But they can tell you how to kill a man better than I do
The reason they fucked up, they all been lied to
I know what it feels like when a nigga misguide you
My momma stay in the projects and I been having money
I went bought her a house, but she told me she ain't want it
(What?) Right then I understood that the hood's in my blood
So I hollered CASHVILLE, lettin 'em know where I'm from
Niggas know I got a gun when I come to the club
And if it go down, you better tell your people to duck
Why should I slow down? I just got started targeting artists
Wait 'til the bullets start hopping out the cartridge
I come to get it popping, pray to God the news watching
So when they see him, his niggas'll know who got 'em
We came from the bottom to the top, from hoopties to a drop
And kill or be killed is the attitude I got, nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man

[Outro: Young Buck]
I know you praying I get killed, nigga
He who fears death is in denial
50 told you niggas, Young Buck showed you niggas
Banks! FREE YAYO!
And tell the bitch ass niggas put they vest on
I'M HERE NOW!
