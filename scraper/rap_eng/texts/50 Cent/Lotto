[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
(I just hit the..) jackpot, got the right 7 digits
Why call to kick it when I can come through to visit?
It won't be long 'fore a nigga get to know you right
Show you right, couple of hot spots we can go to tonight
I watched her, waist trained proper
Either it’s genetics, or she got the right doctor
Strobe lights when she move to seduce me
Make a nigga wanna go sushi

[Verse 2: Rotimi]
I just hit the lotto
Pull up to the V.I.P., pop a bottle
Tell me what you want and I got it
She said she’s from Nevada
She said she goes to school in Chicago
But she wanna dance, and she model
Girl, with a body like that and an ass like that
Drop it to the floor, bring it, bring it right back
You know I be on, baby, just like that
You know what to do with it

[Chorus: Rotimi & 50 Cent]
It’s just the way I feel with you, baby
It’s just the way I feel with you, baby
I just hit the lotto, I just hit the lotto
Jackpot, got the right 7 digits
I just hit the lotto, I just hit the lotto
Jackpot, got the right 7 digits
I just hit the lotto, I just hit the lotto

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Ask about me, I’m persistent, consistent
I put a hand on it and told her kiss it, she kissed it
I’m not the one that broke her heart, I fix shit, I fixed it
Type nigga runnin’ ‘round always saying slick shit
The kind of the right mind, you can deal with
Hit my line at the right time, we can chill, sip
And sip on somethin’ and let your feelings out
When it’s just you and me, that’s what it’s really ‘bout

[Chorus: Rotimi & 50 Cent]
The way I feel with you, baby
It’s just the way I feel with you, baby
I just hit the lotto, I just hit the lotto
Jackpot, got the right 7 digits
I just hit the lotto, I just hit the lotto
Jackpot, got the right 7 digits
I just hit the lotto, I just hit the lotto

[Verse 4: Rotimi]
You better believe that I got her
And the 3 right behind her
They said they wanna follow
So I grab another bottle
Showtime, no Apollo
I know you’re catchin’ the vibe
Tell by the look in your eye
Girl, you know I
We gonna get active tonight
I hit the jackpot tonight
I can’t deny

[Chorus: Rotimi]
It’s just the way I feel with you, baby
It’s just the way I feel with you, baby
I just hit the lotto, I just hit the lotto
(Jackpot, got the right 7 digits)
I just hit the lotto, I just hit the lotto
(Jackpot, got the right 7 digits)
I just hit the lotto
