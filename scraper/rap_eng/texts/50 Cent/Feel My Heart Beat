[Chorus 2x: 50 Cent (girl)]
I'mma let you feel my (heart beat)
Chest to chest, can you feel my (heart beat)
Pull up your dress, can you feel my (heart beat)
We get this wettin', you can feel my (heart beat)

[LL Cool J]
Baby, it's time to switch up the way things go
Tonight's the tonight you'll be in control
I brought you a uniform so you could play the role
Now here's the stepping stone
Lady, I know before we was going kinda cold
The same ol' same always seem to take a toll
Trying to take you back, sip a little Olde Gold
And try a couple things we ain't never did before
Maybe you can be a freak for me at the door
I come up in the crib, you dress ready to go
Girl, take it down low, make it clap real slow
I never had so much fun without spending dough
Baby, you the star of the big boy show
I love you even more now that you unpredictable
Once we in the bedroom, ain't no telling what we'll do
So what you wanna do?

[Chorus 2x]

[Hook: girl (LL Cool J)]
You like it when your clothes are invisible (uh)
This condition is critical (yeah)
Off to the bedroom, here we go (uh)
You alot better than my new girl's underworld (uh-huh)

[LL Cool J]
Yeah, time for you to bust out the new red pumps
I'mma lick shots make the box spring jump
Go 'head and play the role, I'mma give you what you want
Side to side, bring it back to the front
Dress up like the marshalls on a manhunt
Leave all my jewels, cuz you love it when I stunt
I'll play any role except being a chump
My john ain't little, girl, You know I get it crunk
Your boy Todd Smith, I"m the future of the funk
Pretend we little kids, play tag and dry hump
Film my home movie, back to work before lunch
That's what I want

[Chorus 2x]

[Hook 2x]
