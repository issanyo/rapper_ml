[50 Cent]
Come on man I'm hot now, drop now, top down I got style
Been around the block pal imagine what I got now

Range and Maserati I got 'em all got damn
My money, my, my, my money, long
I blackout and break a bat over your ass like Barry Bonds
I get it! I'm down for the jooks now what's up
I'm wit it! I told you I was gonna cake up
I did it! Niggas tryin to show me how to ball
Man they tryin to buy some Gucci, I'm tryin to buy the mall (Oh yeah!)
I ain't came to get a little bit I'm tryin to get it all
My new bitch a cool bitch I'm fittin to make her spoiled
If my watch is right, my stocks is right
But don't be shocked tonight, if you get shot tonight
Still gutter like a motherfucker
Chipped up don't be surprised when I grip up
You slip up you could get it

Uh! Bo knows but Diddy did it (Yeah)
Cars, jewelry and big homes, yeah Diddy did it
Shootouts, coastal beefs, yeah Diddy did it
But my lawyers so good that Diddy got acquitted
I met J. Lopez out in St. Tropez
While you was ridin around in Miami on Mopeds
Yeaaaaaaaah! Oh you just got here
I been doin this shit for over ten years (Ha, Ha!)
I am chillin in Sean John denim
Nigga I don't walk nowhere I'm four wheelin
Champagne spillin, chillin, no ceilin
Stealin a quarter million, feelin, ice grillin
Hit the avenue, earthquake up the morgue
Give Jacob a call then make a withdrawal
Face on the Forbes in '94, I did it
For the record I'm a Bad Boy, now let's get it, come on

[I'm bad and I don't play pretend - FUCK WIT 'EM JAY!]

[Jay-Z]
I'm a hustler, baby! Can't escape my past
When I flip Rocawear, I told 'em give me money cash
Yeah, checks might bounce
Alphabet boys might check my counts
Still hustlin, baby! Hurry up, kill me
I'm already the goat, next stop is the billy
Young turbo, six speed 911
I'm revvin, I'm tryin not to spill my Merlot
When my girl go on world tour
Ladies, I'm back on the street like I'm out on a furlough
I'm back clubbin, Ace of Spade bubblin
Drink it from the bottle, who the fuck need a bucket?!
I'm killin the block, most for whips
So I'm killing the roof, like Michael Vick
Yeah, just call me Forbes.com
In case y'all forgot, New York is still mine, I get it!
