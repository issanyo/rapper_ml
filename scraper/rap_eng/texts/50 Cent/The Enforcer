(Hook)
Who wanna play with the Enforcer?
Who wanna play with the Enforcer? (Who wanna play?)
Who wanna play with the Enforcer?
Who wanna play with the Enforcer?
Who wanna play with the Enforcer?
Money like a boss, but I still come off ya

(Verse 1 - 50 Cent)
Ferrari..Lambo, I race it
Bugatti, I chase it
I be stuntin', niggas don't say shit
Murder..it's what I get away with
There'll never be another me, face it
I pick up big bread, it's okay bitch
Shawty got ass you can play with
She ain't rich like a blonde, just stay with

(Pre-Hook)
So brave, your graves ready..
Tre-8, duct tape, ready..
Your times up already..
Black mag, body bag, ready..ready, ready

(Hook)
Who wanna play with the Enforcer?
Who wanna play with the Enforcer? (Who wanna play?)

(Verse 2)
Crazy..sip, psychotic
Rich..still pushing narcotics
Shit you wanna do, I've done it
Life's going the way I want it
X pills, pounds up chronic
Drama..tell me who want it
I've done it
They talk about it, they fronting

(Pre-Hook)
So brave, your graves ready..
Tre-8, duct tape, ready..
Your times up already..
Black mag, body bag, ready..ready, ready

Money like a boss, but I still come off ya
This is how it sounds when I'm mashing (x3)
This is the Enforcer in action
This is how it sounds when I'm mashing (x3)
This is how it feels when I'm blasting

(Bridge)
Everything I do something you want to
But you don't do things that I do
Cause you ain't got the heart to do it
You ain't got the heart to do it
You ain't got the heart to do it
You ain't got the heart to do it

(Outro)
This is how it feels when I'm blasting
Blasting, blasting, blasting, blasting
Blasting, blasting, blasting, blasting
This is how it feels when I'm blasting
