Intro [50 Cent]

Talk the talk and I walk the walk
Talk the talk and I walk the walk
Talk the talk and I walk the walk
Talk the talk and I walk the walk

Verse 1 [Don Kayvan]

No one helped me out with this rap shit
I bought my own features
Talking big business, you talking about sneakers
My style is hypnotic, opinions are idiotic
Who I work with is iconic, it's ironic
My friends won't tell me that my word play is psychotic
Our friendship is rocky, they think I'm cocky
I'm the new stock pick, this a biopic
Because I talk the talk and I walk the walk
She don't wanna blow my head up
She say that she fed up
Now I'm worth her energy?
Cuz that I got my bread up
Now she stalks me
To cock block me
She think she can stop me?
No one can stop me
I rep the L.A
Respect the LBC
Make beats like Dr. Dre
Knocturnal is a G
We don't play in California
Bunch of snitches in DC
Cut your ACL in ATL
Shout out to Slim Gotti

Chorus [50 Cent]

Calling me cocky
They calling me cocky
They calling me cocky
They calling me cocky
Now nigga why you mad?
Nigga why you mad?
Nigga why you mad?
Nigga why you mad?
Oh, you can't do that?
Repeat * 2

Verse 2 [Slim Gotti]
R.i.P to the track nigga
R.i.P to the track nigga
R.i.P to the track nigga
R.i.P to the track nigga
Back, like I never left
And, when it hit the fan they never there
Your girl in the streets, catch her everywhere
Hoes stop and stare when I come through he city
Middle finger up, run the town like Diddy
They say that I'm cocky, sorta like 50
Fingers they itchy they itching for the paper
I stunt when I can so I shine on them haters
I ball so hard that I got to be a player
I got to make sure I'm higher than the Himalayas
Because them niggas be watching they ain't trying to see me raise up
Why these niggas hate me this the way I'm raised up
This the way I been holmes
This the way I live holmes
If you knew what I knew nigga I'd been gone
Better find you a team you can put the bench on

Chorus [50 Cent]

Calling me cocky
They calling me cocky
They calling me cocky
They calling me cocky
Now nigga why you mad?
Nigga why you mad?
Nigga why you mad?
Nigga why you mad?
Oh, you can't do that?
Repeat * 2
