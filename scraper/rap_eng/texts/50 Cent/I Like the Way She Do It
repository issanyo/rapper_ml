[Bridge: 50 Cent]
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I suppose to blow, you suppose to know
Not to go against me or it R.I.P
I'm stupid rich, got retarded money
I'm special ed, I got special bread
It's easy now, please believe me now
I dismiss a ho, bitch leave me now
I fuck when I want, I do what I like
She want the same chick I want, the bitch is a dike
She a super freak, the freak of the week
I give her something a suck, she give her something to eat
It never enough, she like it rough
We keep it going and we switch positions, listen

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
I need a dollar for every time that my heart beat
Now how much it that
I can breath on a track and make money, ahha ahha
Now how much is that
I'm getting money baby, my truck a Lamborghini
I'm in ali-dibi, where the girls are freaky
Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me
Ma I love it when you lie and say my eyes are dreamy
Certain niggas fall in love with a bitch
Patron in my dick, I fuck the blood out a chick
I'm in the club frontin, I'm in the club stuntin'
10 Grand to buy the bar, Ma it ain't nothing

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
If home girl wit it, I'm get it, hit it, split it
She'll think about me everyday, hour, minute
Second to nobody, baby check it
You look as good as your check
And when your naked, I'm ready to fuck
A little head in the truck
If her tongue game good, I'ma let her come up
When the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down, put the magnum down
I'm with G-Unit, see you next
Nigga you not ballin a the G2 jet
How ever do you want it, how ever you do need me
OPE on a fuckin' CD, it's ME

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
She got a nigga on the count down
Waitin on it like... three, two, one - yeah right now
You got skills on them high heels
When we leave this club, I'm take you were I live
Do me before I get her
I might eat out tonight, depending on how I feel
Baby girl got a thang for me
She do what every I say and I ain't got to make it rain money
Go getta and she ghetto with it
Told shawty don't do it, but she already did it
I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me where every she at, Like that

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
