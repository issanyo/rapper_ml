[Intro]
Yeah.. YEAH.. YEAH!

[Verse 1]
Lil' Tyrone tired of gettin' his ass whipped, so he holdin' that gat down
His momma think it's my fault, 'cause he listened to Back Down
Bobby was a fuckin' bum, he pumpin' packs now
He need some fresh chicks, white tees and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock a wino, he won't put the 'gnac down
Eric had the jump shot, but he's smokin' crack now
The Lunatics, the Lost Boyz, Cheeks shit is whack now
Country blew trial, them crackers got him on his back now
And Sean {*ka-click*} runnin' round with his fuckin' gat now
Up in niggas cribs, sayin' "where that money at pal?"
Now Sandra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch traveled the world, she runnin' round boostin'
Now Toya got these bad-ass kids, they a nuisance
Her baby daddies never come around, they useless
Every now and then I come through on some new shit
Pearly white 6 or some chrome deuce-deuces

[Chorus]
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me

[Verse 2]
When I was six, man, momma told me God don't like ugly
I fell, scraped my face, and thought God must don't love me
Saw Owen every morning before school, he sell dope
Niggas keep whuppin' Nut ass 'cause he sell soap
Charlie be beggin' all the time, he stay broke
Flip be down on 1-0-9, rollin' up smoke
Shameek, he a thief, catch a stunt in a stolen car
He that nigga that you call when you crashin' into a bar
See they love me 'cause I rap now, but they don't like me
I been locked up three times and they ain't write me
Stevie a punk, but fuck what he say, he can get mean quick
Pop shots at you, Esau must suck a mean dick
The block's hot, D's jump out on us almost all the time
They watch us from the building but niggas still be on the grind
Wayne used to call the cops and tell them G had a 9
Til G put that gun in Donrad seat and said it wasn't mine

[Chorus]
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me
