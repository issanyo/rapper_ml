[Intro: 50 Cent + The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah
50 Cent (Biggie Smalls) is the illest
For sure, for sure, haha
50 Cent (Biggie Smalls) is the illest
50 Cent-50-50-50 Cent, 50-50-50-50 Cent is the illest
50-50-50 Cent is the illest

[Verse: 50 Cent]
Live from Southside, son's the livest one
Representin’ NY to the fullest, gats I pull it
You bastards duckin' cause 50 buckin'
In my bathroom fuckin’, it ain't nothin'
These hoes got a thing for the kid
I hit it once then roll a blunt, a bitch'll give me keys to the crib
So you know it's like...where I lay my hat is my home
Break time man the bitch is on her own
Got all types of bills of my own
If you lookin' for a nigga to pay your bills ya dead wrong
I ain't no trick bitch, I'm a ma-fuckin’ pimp
No Cadillac, no jheri curl, no cane, and no limp
2003, no P.I.M.P., G-Unit sneakers matchin’ the throwback, bitch ya know that
Be a witness to this, tell everyone you seen this
Every freestyle's a commercial, I’m a marketing genius

[Outro: 50 Cent + Unbelievable Sample]
It's unbelievable
50-50 Cent is the illest
It's unbelievable
50-50 Cent is the illest
I wanna give a shoutout to [?]
Aye, you know Whoo Kid supposed to be the number one DJ this year
Just wanna put that bug in your ear man, so you know
Selling those tapes, that don't count?
50-50 Cent is the illest
