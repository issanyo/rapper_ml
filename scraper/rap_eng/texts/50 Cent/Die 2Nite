INTRO
CHORUS BY 50 CENT
[VERSE 1: GEMINI KILLER]

HOW THE FUCK YOU GONNA TELL ME YOU LIVING IN PAIN !!
WHEN I'VE BEEN SHOT 7 TIMES NIGGA - LOOK AT MY NAME
I'VE BEEN LOCKED UP FOR MURDER NIGGA - PICTURE THE FAME
IN THE STREETS - BUT MY MOTHER'S FRIENDS THINK I'm INSANE
PLUS MY BROTHER DEAD - WE WERE LIKE ABEL & CAIN
I WAS ONLY 14 - I STARTED MY OWN GANG
GOT TRIGGER HAPPY - LOVE HEAR THE GUN BANG
THAT'S WHY NIGGAS CLAPPED ME AFTER 10 YEARS & SOME CHANGE
NIGGAS BLEED JUST LIKE US - BUT NO - WE NOT THE SAME
CAUSE YA PUSSY - AIN'T NO BITCH ASS IN MY VEINS
I'VE BEEN CUT - I'VE BEEN STABBED - GUNBUTT TO THE BRAIN
I'VE BEEN LOCKED OUT IN THE COLD WITH THE FIRE & FLAMES
WHEN MONEY EXCHANGE HAND - ACQUIRE A BLOOD STAIN
WHEN NIGGAS DIE IN THE HOOD - THEY SAY IT'S A THUG THANG
CANT COPE WITH THE FACT I SOLD YA MOMS COCAINE
ONE SHOT ONE KILL - THESE NIGGAS GOT NO AIM - FOR REAL
