(Intro: 50 cent x Skam)
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shorty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
We gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

(Chorus: 50 Cent x Skam)
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

(Verse: Skam)
When I pull up out front you see my jeep is budged
I look so suspicious, cops wanna show me love
Flashing they lights before I could enter the club
Told em' I'm skam, but they didn't give a fuck

Tried to sneak in VIP, but the bouncers act up
Saw flash in the back, rolling that weed up
Holla at my homie, but he ignored me, acting like he don't know me, tried to tell the DJ turn it up!

Cus I heard my song play, then he letting the record skip
Letting the record skip, letting the record skip, bring it back!
How much worse can this fucking night get?
Some dude slapped my girls ass, that's all, that's it

Got into a fight then lost it, nose bleeding I shouldve been cautious, I'm nauseous
Dude almost knocked my unconscience, go to the bar exhausted, tried to order some shots to drink away the pain
But my card got declined, this whole club is awful

(Outro: Skam)
You can find me in da club, bottle empty
Barely feel the buzz, I want the DJ to play my songs
So come and put it on if you wanna show some love
You can find me in da... haha...
Man, fuck it, Skam!
