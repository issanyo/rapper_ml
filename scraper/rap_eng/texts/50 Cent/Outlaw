[Intro]
Outlaw: we lawless
We ballin' out, nigga, regardless
Everything VVS, we flawless
When I stunt, I stunt on niggas the hardest

[Verse 1]
If niggas so hot, why they ain't got what I got?
My Maybach, my watch, my Hublot
My fat knots, my swag is top-notch
My crack spots bring cash in non-stop
My nigga Rock just came home from Comstock
I got shooters, they ain't got what I got
Got shit locked, I stunt non-stop
I get it and I blow it how I want, why not?
My bitch cold, I mean hot, sure shot
Come through in the drop, hold the Glock, why not?
9 millimeter, 9 shots, big rock
9 carat stones, I'm in my own zone

[Hook]
Outlaw, yeah yeah, we lawless
We balling out, yeah, regardless
VVS yeah yeah, we flawless
You do what you gotta do, we do what we wanna do

[Verse 2]
You wan' get shot? Go â€˜head, run up in my spot
My lawyers will have me out by 1 o'clock
Go 'head, get dropped trying to take what I got
My diamonds twinkle over my Azad
My gun pop, tell me why would you try that?
Porsche Turbo, Cayenne I'll buy that
G5 jet, pilot, I'll fly that
Burn good shit, get as high as I get
My mind's sick, I'm criminal-minded
Shorty's ass fat: I want to bump and grind that
Groupie love bitch, your left breast? I'll sign that
I'm CEO ho, you ain't know?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
New York party of the year: my spot
These bitches look so good: oh my God
Looking at the man in the mirror, I'm so hot
Shorty want to cut, cool, make sure the door's locked
Off with the Gucci, down go my Louis
Out come my oo-wee, do me, baby do me!
Like a pornstar took ya to my spot
My bed rock back and forth when I'm on top
My backshots they are sorta like crack rocks
I give it all I got, non-stop 'til sweat drop
I damage I wreck shop, I come through correct, I
I give her what she need 'til it's hard to breathe

[Hook]
