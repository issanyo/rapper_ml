[Intro]
You wanna smoke that? Go 'head, roll it, son
I don't give a fuck, man, smoke that shit, man
Or you can smoke crack if you wanna smoke crack
I don't give a fuck what you wanna do, man
Don't look to me to stop you, man
Yeah, I'm not gettin in the way

[Hookt]
Cash rules, I keep a shooter 'round me
Queens get the money, I have a nigga killed y'all (killed y'all)
Kill the hood, ask niggas 'bout me
Jesus, for the money, niggas'll go real hard (real hard)

[Verse 1]
You are now under my hypnosis
Summertime grind, come out with the toasters
I return like an animal ferocious
New money breeds, new enemies, nigga you know this
Another mil', another nigga sick
I got nothing but hard dick for your bitch to lick
I box unorthodox, southpaw, outlaw, bricks of raw
I'm out in the drought, I make the dope price soar
Shit cool 'til the mac out, run when it back out
A nigga finna blackout, better pray that bitch jam
It's in God's hands, it's all God plan
You mean even when a nigga gettin smoked, goddamn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I push my pen with passion, I'm the author of the struggle
When pain is a head crack, the sign of the devil
Trip' 6-6-6, I'm back on my bullshit
See clear through my third eye, it's gon' be a murder
Every summer, every winter, every spring
You think I'm bullshitting, I put that on everything
The shooting gon' stop right after the shit-talking
I was selling crack while Mike was moonwalking
20 off a pack, I stack, I can't call it
I blast ya like NASA, Jack, you outta orbit
I mean you outta order, you don't want me to send a nigga to you
So he could put some hot shit through you, do you?

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Yeah, I'm back, baby, I'm back
New shit, the drought over, new product
Yeah, man I can't fit in with these niggas, man
I mean niggas got mohawks, they wearing skinny jeans, man
I think these niggas is faggots, man, for real, man
They with the rainbow club, man
You think this shit is a fad? Come on, man
I think it's more than that, man
I think it's more than that
So if a nigga wear a dress you gon' put on a dress too?
Come on, man

[Hook]
