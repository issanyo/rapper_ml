[Verse 2:]
I can see it in her eyes she tired of tha average life
Fuckin' with me so subject to tha lavish life
Follow instructions baby tha sky's tha limit
If you u believe u get to see and achieve
But first past tha weed
I was born ta be a balla
Niggas be hatein' on a kid I can't call it
I could be everything you need tha shoulder you lean on
Tha one that you talk to, tha one that you keen on
If your atracktive we get to thumpin' for awhile
If you listen long enough ill send some humer ta make you smile
Got you outta pokit now bitch go on choose a pimp
Doc blew me lost my moma iv been pimpin' ever since
I'm a special kinda nigga girl can't you see?
I talk my way out the hood on to your T. V
I make changing your life apear so easy
But you gotta be about your paper if your rollin' with me

[Verse 3:]
I'm from a bottom from a bottom goin' ta take it to tha top!
If you think we can't do it nigga watch as
We go to all tha way to a drop
From a lil to alot put a touch up and we got it
She's far from average
She's a special lady she'll do anything for me and that drives me crazy
We get our grind on
I let her blow on my dice
Then my luck change I hit tha h right twice
Its simple its mental she down for me
When theres no one around, she's around for me
She's my sunshine after tha rain my joy after tha pain
Its easy to comprehend simple and plain
