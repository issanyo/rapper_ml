[Verse 1]
It's the same shit, feel like a nigga having flashbacks
I might have crack in my ass crack
Back to that rubber handle, 38. special vandal
Play Godfather, bitch, you be dead like Marlon Brando
These bars hit harder than hard times
My flow’ll make a lifer wanna stare at the sunshine
I’ll bring a bitch, you bring a bitch, let's switch
I’mma swing, hit ya face with a pillow case filled with mop wringers
Penitentiary style, big monster swag
Bitch, I got so many tricks make me go in my bag
Yeah, niggas keep saying I’m back, it’s a fact
Ya shaking like ya ass got parkinsons, relax
Confused, acting like a white boy bored
Now you wanna jump a flight of stairs on a skateboard
Nigga, why the fuck ya pants so tight?
You tryna show niggas your ass, your alternative life
I’m hungry like I ain't ate, I lost weight
On a highway it's worth more outta state
I’m raw like Cypress, I could just kill a man
Blow from Mexico’s cartels per kilograms

[Hook]
They love me then hate me then love me again
Bitch, I don’t pretend, pussy, I ain't your friend
I done told you over and over again
You can hate it or love it, hate it or love it

[Verse 2]
I going green, emeralds and my watch face drippin'
Nigga ain't no safe safe when I start trippin'
I might call my next LP Death of the Weirdo
I’m high, check my altitude, I’m lounging in the Lear home
Feel a buzz, a little Kool-Aid and Codeine
I say getting your ass whipped is a sure thing
It ain't safe in the war, the war I’m playing my shark tank
On the trip to the mall, made your bitch ass plank
I done touched more pussy than maxipads
Now Detox can be your little rap rehab
Bitch, just a second visit from the repo man
And you can’t afford your monthlys, I mean goddamn
Nigga, you ain't worth your shoes you standing in
When I party I bring a bitch to bring the cannon in
You said you was gonna see me when your homie got shot
It’s been a while so I’m guessing you must've forgot
Once again you forget, ain't this some shit
You forgot about me, bitch, I wrote your hits
You know How We Do, Hate It or Love It
And nigga fuck it I’m special, that's why your ass say my verse

[Hook]
