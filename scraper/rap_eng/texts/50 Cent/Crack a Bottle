[Intro: Straight Shooter]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

[Chorus: Straight Shooter]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
(Okay, let's go!)

[Verse 1: Straight Shooter]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse, the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Straight Shooter]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
(Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh, my!"
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, 'cause I know why
[Snoop Dogg]
I dip through in that six tre, like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
[Snoop Dogg]
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
â€˜Cause over and above all, it's just another day
[Snoop Dogg]
And this one begins where the last one ends
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
[Snoop Dogg]
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
[Snoop Dogg]
Grab another one from out the stable
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
[Snoop Dogg]
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Decisions, decisions; garage looks like Precision Collision
[Snoop Dogg]
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Straight Shooter]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say "Move," a bitch move

[Chorus: Straight Shooter]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
