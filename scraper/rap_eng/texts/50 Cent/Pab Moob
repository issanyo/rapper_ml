[Intro: 50 Cent]
You don't get as far as the motherfuckers you talk to
For no reason
You don't be as successful as the motherfuckers you talk to
For no reason
If you spendin' your day talking to a nigga that ain’t got nothing going on
What the FUCK kind of information could he offer you?

[Verse 1: Coolie Pak]
Uh
I know niggas that's not about it
Bitch I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Know niggas that powder body, got bodies I turn to powder
Close to baby pussy, wreckin' that baby pussy
Reckless in any move, be reckless I'ma make a movie
Got two piece, Ruly, Rugers got me rulin'
You foolin' 'round with savages mad packages
Technical massacres
Massage my temple
Chillin' with demons tonight got you on yo' knees, temple
As-salamu ʿalaykum
Call Lakim, got him to shoot three like Lakim
[?] killed the kingpin
Microphone boxer Lick a buck, uh fuck a Jeremy Lin, Got his ankles and In a bin filled with sin
Sinister sinner, but I never had a bitch be my friend
My eleventh commandment might demand-aments
Fuck boys don't get it bent
(Don't get it bent)
Just give me the rent, that boy resent me 'cause I'm the illest MC Worded to the OG who told me fuck the police they locked my mans up

[Bridge: Coolie Pak]
Free p-o-p, free v-o-n, free-

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
So we got black foes, when you black, the po'
Don't wanna, fuck around, they on yo' back, could go
Blast at your black Timbs and pistols, bro
Them pistols go, "BRATTT" where your sister go
And I'm not 'posed to pressure these pussies playin' to pressure, comin'
My obsession no recollection, I'm drillin', homie
I'm not chillin', they steady drillin' the children homie
And you don't get it? They tryna make us the villain, B

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Be reckless, any move, be reckless
Be reckless, any move, be reckless
Be reckless, any move, be reckless
Don't get it bent, boy don't get it bent
Be reckless, any move, be reckless
Be reckless, any move, be reckless
Be reckless, any move, be reckless
Don't get it bent, boy don't get it bent

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Eh
Zay Soul
Haha
I've been sober
This a memory
Is it still "The Fall"?
Is it still?
It's my season, it's my season forever
Bye
