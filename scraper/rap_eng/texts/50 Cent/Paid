Diamonds on my neck like I'm kin to Fred Flintstone
Diamonds on my neck like I'm kin to Fred Flintstone
Diamonds on my neck like I'm kin to Fred Flintstone

[Hook; Boosie Badazz]
I'm getting paid like a motherfucker

Paid, paid, paid, paid, paid

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
This is my world, my spot, money in the droptop
Couple bad bitches, couple hundreds in the droptop
Young, rich nigga, Corleone, I talk my talk
Six different hustles, bitch, I'm eating like the mob
Block parties turned to yacht parties
Fat knots now we black cardin', I'm a go-getter, nigga
Clothing line, gold mine, I done bossed up
50 Cent on my line, nigga, we talk bucks
Louis stove, we spent Cutlass in Regus, nigga
Stupid dough, I gotta keep me a team of killers
My crew so big, my car so big
My bitch so thick, look how she bling

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My bread stacking, boy, I ain't lacking
I'm playing mack with your bitch
My trap jumping, I clap something
Don't fuck around with my shit
Got a nasty temper, boy, all winter
I'm riding around with my heat
On the night shift I got a four fifth
I blow a nigga off his feet
When I'm riding dirty, got an Uzi with me
Got Boosie with me, acting boogie with me
Winner jewelry with me, got a shooter with me
There ain't nothing niggas 'round can do with me
Getting paid like a motherfucker, get bread
Switching lanes like a motherfucker, shit yeah
Move the 'caine like it's all legal
Hustle like a nigga really still need to
Watch it come in back, hit the right jack
Stack that, cook it up, watch it come back
Right back, watch the crumbs come from the pot
Turn into a foreign up the lot
Switch gears all year, we getting paper
Some bitch niggas hate us
We could talk about it later
Right now we moving major

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
I'm getting paid like a motherfucker, say that then
We went from thugs and old schools to Maybach friends
Push start all type of cars, legends laid back in
Cold ice in the water, I play nice with my lawyer
Beat the case, shocked the nation, up the price for my lawyer
I'm my own CEO, I'm an artist, I'm an employer
I'm on the run, life good, I'm on a full stomach
Ain't Sean John yet, but I'm a young Puffy

[Hook]
