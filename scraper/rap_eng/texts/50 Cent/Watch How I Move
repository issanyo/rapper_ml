Verse 1
Twelve in the morning, feeling just right
Top down, headed where the function's popping tonight
Sipping Patron with a little bit of lime
Pre-fade buzz right, because the bartender know’s what I like
Pull up to the party in a brand new Maserati, they treat me like John Gotti because they recognize
Women, I keep them feening because they see me in their dreams, So by the time I'm leaving they be screaming "let me ride"
They tell me, I'm so off the richter, I tell them to handcuff their sisters
When we get off of them drinks, we’re synchronizing like jinx, don't trip never that won't pay her
Much more hot than all competition, show stopper, they pay me attention
So when it comes to these fe's (females), I keep it Bill Bellamy
Watch me, I'll show you how to be a player

Chorus
I let my tape rock, till my tape popped, smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on Private Stock (X2)
I can show you..
Watch how I move, Wa-Watch how I move
Watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player
Watch how I move, Wa-Watch how I move
Watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player
Ooooh, Playa!

Verse 2
After the club, hit the after party, after the party hit the hotel lobby and
After the Trone (Patron) then we probably dip, Because after the original, it's probably this
Rolling in my super-car, feeling like a superstar, because I got a super-broad next to me
I’m everywhere they’re looking, they smell it, I keep that kush in the air from LA to Brooklyn, no sticks, no seeds
They tell me, I'm so off the richter, I tell them to handcuff their sisters
When we get off of them drinks, we’re synchronizing like jinx, don't trip never that won't pay her
Much more hot than all competition, show stopper, they pay me attention
So when it comes to these fe's (females), I keep it Bill Bellamy
Watch me, I’ll show you how to be a player

Chorus
I let my tape rock, till my tape popped, smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on Private Stock (X2)
I can show you..
Watch how I move, Wa-Watch how I move
Watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player
Watch how I move, Wa-Watch how I move
Watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player
Ooooh, Playa!

Verse 3
Pull up to the front and, then all of a sudden
Hit that button, microwave oven
Shawty and her cousin, started bum-rushing
They're all up on my rocks like Charles S. Dutton
They say I can get it, I say that I'm with it
Got to make them feel it, until they need cigarettes
I wonder can they take this, damn I hate a fake chick
Slap to the face, what's that? Rick James, bitch!
Watch how I move, Swag got her juiced
Passed polygraph, ass is the truth
She starts to pop, I start to jock
Then shorty stopped, and made it drop
I picked it up, put it in the truck
Headed for the smush, shawty knows what's up
I'm not you, I never pay her
Watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player

Chorus
I let my tape rock, till my tape popped, smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on Private Stock (X2)
I can show you..
Watch how I move, Wa-Watch how I move
Watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player
Watch how I move, Wa-Watch how I move
Watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player
Ooooh, Playa!
