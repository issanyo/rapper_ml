[Intro:]
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

[Hook: Phresher]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
One god damn minute
Hold up wait a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga like me feel tremendous
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute
I start shit then I finish
Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me feel tremendous

[Verse 1: Phresher]
Big head Jimmy Neutron
Fuck a bitch on a futon
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Nigga this ain't Groupon
Do my dirt all by my lonely
All my bitches know we homies
If I pull up wit my bitch hoes better act like they don't know me
All my side bitches in check, diamonds clear like windex
One point on the index
Stomp your ass like an insect
So you better be cool
Shawty better be nude
When I walk in the room
She know she fuckin' with a goon
I did em in at the same time
My third leg got hang time
Bang, bang, bang time
Game face when it's game time
He hate to leave the score up
Got her screamin' like a Horr-a
She keep beggin' me to stop
But she really want more-a
Shawty so contradicted
But the dick's so addictive
Homie how could you blame her?
Her head dumb like Kramer

Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute

Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Boy, now what's the issue?
You gonna make me get with you
You want talk that girlie talk bitch you can talk to my pistol
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I got big paper I'm spendin'
I get to flashin' on 'em, my whip blasted on 'em, I mean any nigga can get it
That's 30 in the extendo
I had your bitch in the end zone
Nigga she sucked me out the friend zone
Nigga she sucked me out the friend zone
I'm so good with the hoes
I pulled up in the Rolls
With my diamonds blinkin' like strobes
In a Kanye shirt with holes
I'm blowin' paper like debt
My niggas in here strapped
They'll bust, you won't bust back
That's why I act how I act
I see it oh, so, clear
You niggas ain't really-really with this shit
Got me thinkin' I really, really, really, really run this bitch

Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait, wait, wait, a minute

Hard head I don't listen
Diamonds on my wrist glisten
Nigga let me feel tremendous
