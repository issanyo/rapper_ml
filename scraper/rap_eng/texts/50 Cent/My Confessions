[Intro]
Yo, I'd like to dedicate this to my mom, Sabrina Jackson
God bless her soul
We gon' get it on in here; nothing but real shit

[Verse 1]
Yo, shorty ain't a shorty no more; shorty be wil'ing
Shorty adolescent ass belong on the island
I went from riding big wheels to wanting to be a big Willy
Found interest in drug dealers and cold-hearted killers
Could it be it's in my blood cause my mom sold drugs?
She used to bust slugs and surround herself by thugs
Made mistakes by showing them love
And they killed her
Some friends never came to pay respects, so fuck Hilda
You know how friends do friends - like Tony did Manolo
The type of fast shit that Henry did in Good Fellas
Some snakes don't show up to weights cause they backs is yellow
When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme
For all you slow muthafuckers, I'mma break it down iller
See, 'Preme was a business man - you guess who the killer
Remember? He used to push the bulletproof BM (uh huh)
His hair'll get you seasick; I sat back and peeped shit
They roll with E-Z Wider, and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for fifty or five hundred
What about bug, who trade and them niggas had cheese?
In the late 80s push Mercedes
And Maseratis, kept reserved spaces at the horse races
Where they met Columbian connections like Lucho and Mariella
Then bookoo bucks on the horses; they used to cook and flip bricks
Faster than the jet flip flap jack and pack gats
Niggas said Ds was dipping, burned his face with acid
'Til this day, they would say the mothefucker's gasted

[Hook]
It's my confession; I make corrections; I strive for perfection
I try to be the best in, whatever I do; I'm telling you
This is my confession; I'm teaching niggas a lesson
Cause they can't do, what I do; here's my confession

[Verse 2]
Yo, a lot of New York blocks are only bringing pennies in
I stand beef - too many cheaps; too little fucking Indians
Too many sips of the brew will make you do what we do
Play with insecurities, until we start fussing and cussing
Frustration builds - few lose, and fist fights leave niggas busting
Not only do we have to look out and avoid encounters with Jake
Gotta look out and avoid encounters with snakes
Niggas who fake and play both sides of the gate
I squeeze Boyz II Men for they cheese like Michael Bivins
Slip with half a big nigga cap like Robert Givens
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze will leave you confused
And if you watch the news, you'll see some players in this game and lose
Niggas think they together; they ain't together at all
Stand on the block together, but divided they fall
A lot of niggas locked down and ain't got nobody to call
And a player ain't the same player when he can't ball

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, you better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me - the type that keep the bricks flipping
Jewels dripping, the margarita sipping - description
Nappy blowouts shaped up, brown-skinned
And ask the hood rats about my dick; the chickens recommend it
I make statements like "Try me if you want"
Presentation: cool and calm - words as if I'm daring ya
Usually roll with a 2 shot .25 derringer
I'm not an actor; my life's not a movie
I never worked with the Fugees
I'm not killing you softly; pack a small gat just to back you up off me
But later when things simmer and all sin ceases
My peoples will see to it that you rest in peace in pieces
Kill or be killed - it's what the hood teaches
Never go to church so the preachers can't reach us
And if we do, it's only on Easter

[Hook]
