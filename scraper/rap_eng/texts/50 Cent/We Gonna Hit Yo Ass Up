(feat. Lloyd Banks & Tony Yayo)

[50 Cent:] Yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
When I grip the Tec
Hit the deck
I'll spray at you're way
Nicknamed my chopper Scrappy thats my Kay Kay
Pussy get out of line and your ass can die today
Look at my soldiers to get 'em is all I got to say
Hennessy, rum and Coke a little Alize
Got me in the mood to bust a nigga head man
I ain't playin' ain't got no time for them games
Niggas lose they life all the time for fuckin' playin'

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Look at my chick, look at my whip look how my rims move
Get a real good look, but don't scheme cause I got my pistol
Platinum on wrist blue
Wrist poppin' bling green by the fist full
I'm smokin' chong good
Don't ride through the wrong hood
Unless you got a vest on
That Teflon
Like a don should
I'm rollin' sticky green
Every nigga with me clean
Strap got it tucked know what I mean?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
Its the general homie thats commanding these advances
My semi-automatic ravin'
Stay blazin'
The Rover be Etchel White
Shorty leaned over but i'm mad cause she got an over-bite
I got your baby's mother
Movin' overloads of Coke
For Louey Vuitton minks, belts, bags and coats
Homie we enrich you're bitch or hood rat
Thats why my waves spinnin' in that G Unit hat

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up

This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club
Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub
Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck
Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up
