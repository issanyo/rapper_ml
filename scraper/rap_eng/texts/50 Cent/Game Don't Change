[Intro: 50 Cent]
My niggas sell dope
Play the block with it
My niggas sell dope
Play the block with it

[Hook]
Ay everybody broke, that’s a damn shame
That’s why I chain smoke, tryna ease the damn pain
Instead of star folk or get in the dope game
Cuz you could change the players but the game don’t change
The game don’t change, no, the game don’t change
The game don’t change, no, the game don’t change
You gon lose, you don’t know the rules to the game
Cuz you could change the players but the game don’t change

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
If your sleeping on cash, your ass better wake up
I sold this shit that made the Five Heartbeats break up
I’m ‘bout to get my cake up from this white bitch sniffin’ white jizz, powderin’ the face without make up
Air Max and the snap back over the shape up
Look niggas, I’ve got shook niggas to shake up
Call the apes up, get you duck taped up
Fake fuck, you be paralyzed from the waist up
Wait up, I’ve got my weight up, your family gon have to set your wake up cuz you were never waked up
Rise and shine. It’s true the music industry will rob you blind so get a job or grind
And every bitch lie sometime
But your bitch told me that she never had a dick the size of mine
I get so high I can’t open up my eyes sometime
Or stay with guap, I play the block. I’ve got pies to grind

[Hook]
Everybody broke, that’s a damn shame
That’s why I chain smoke, tryna ease the damn pain
Instead of star folk or get in the dope game
Cuz you could change the players but the game don’t change
The game don’t change, no, the game don’t change
The game don’t change, no, the game don’t change
You gon lose, you don’t know the rules to the game
Cuz you could change the players but the game don’t change

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
If you forgot that I was hot you’d better start to remember
For the chicken get the ego of the hark up in you
I ball cause I play the block like a startin’ center
I’m in the mood to have calamari and shark for dinner
I’m from a hood you have to have a lot of heart to enter
A lot of bodies gonna fall before we start to win it
I got that good dope, heroin and good smoke
Comin’ out the trap ho, smellin’ like crip coop, brook
Broke people look rich, rich people look broke
Some good folk, life ain’t gon end on a good note
If you need it then I got it for sale
I’ve got the product for sale, a narcotic to sell
I’ve got pounds of Arizona and exotic to sell
I’ve got that kill vacuum suit I need to stop and to smell
You ain’t even gotta inhale or catch the damn smoke
That sour will have you high off of second hand smoke

[Hook]
Everybody broke, that’s a damn shame
That’s why I chain smoke, tryna ease the damn pain
Instead of star folk or get in the dope game
Cuz you could change the players but the game don’t change
The game don’t change, no, the game don’t change
The game don’t change, no, the game don’t change
You gon lose, you don’t know the rules to the game
Cuz you could change the players but the game don’t change

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
I get rich, when the dope flip it's gymnastics
And I could make your bitch disappear, my dick be magic
Trust me, it’s static and I get the baddest bitties, pretty with big titties and big asses
That’s why in highschool I skipped classes to get changed
Or get brain like the nerd your big glasses
I stab niggas, grab triggers, kick asses and spit acid at your bitch asses

[Hook]
Everybody broke, that’s a damn shame
That’s why I chain smoke, tryna ease the damn pain
Instead of star folk or get in the dope game
Cuz you could change the players but the game don’t change
The game don’t change, no, the game don’t change
The game don’t change, no, the game don’t change
You gon lose, you don’t know the rules to the game
Cuz you could change the players but the game don’t change
