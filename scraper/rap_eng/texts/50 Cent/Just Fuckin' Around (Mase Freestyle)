You can hum all you want to
Cum all you want to
But I ain't gon' want you
If nobody wants you
You like the smiles n the dimples on my face
BITCH that's a bullet wound I ain't MASE!
50 Cent skip the bullshit, you fuckin' tonight
I got some dro, got some henny
We can go and get right
I ain't never been arrested for nothing domestic
But I ain't gon' lie I'll punch a bitch in the eye
Look, don't play games with me baby
The temptation, the wait, is driving me crazy
Come on give me some ass girl... WHAT UP!
I don't wanna make love
I just wanna fuck
I'm only in town tonight
If you give me some head

If I make it to heaven
I'll probably be in the bitch lonely
Walk around saying, 'Everybody in hell know me'
You heard of Banks, you heard of Yayo, them niggas my homies
You probably thinking how he get there
That nigga my co-d
The weather in hell is kinda hot
You know like the block
I heard it really burns
Homie, you know like a shot
That's alright for me shit
Cause Im in the drop
Drive around heavy
Tryna find BIG and PAC
Niggas think when they die
All they problems stop
You die in jail, and wake up in hell
Still on lock
Imagine if you stole something and you got shot
Wake up holdin' your head, still shot
Niggas don' died of AIDS
You know the dirty dick
Wake up in hell horny
Fidna fuck the same bitch
DAMN

Yeah, who hotta than me, nigga AAAAAH
The only nigga hotter than me
Dead already nigga
I know what you thinkin
You thinkin that's it
Yeah nigga let's just keep it short and sweet
You know!
