[Intro: Remo the Hitmaker]
Remo the Hitmaker, woah-woah, the West

[Verse 1: Remo the Hitmaker]
Never would you think I'd get this far
But I just keep grindin' harder
I've been down so many times before
(Down so many times)
If you only knew the pain that I endured
I've had some people turn they backs on me
(They gonna regret it)
A few held me down and most didn't believe
(Now I keep working harder)
But a nigga didn't give up
When I put on I do it for y'all

[Chorus: Remo the Hitmaker]
You don't know the things that I went through
Had the heart and soul with everything I do
It took so long just to get me here
And out of all the people why you mad at me?
Why you mad at me for? (Why you mad at me?)
Why you mad at me for? (Why you mad at me?)
Why you mad at me for? (Why you mad at me?)
Why you mad at me for? (Why you mad at me?)
Why you mad at me for?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
(Why you mad at me? Fifty, yeah)
Is it the Bentley, the Rolls?
The i8 when the doors flip open?
It's fly, fly, niggas hatin' and why, why?
Got all the threads on fleek, I don't rock none cheap
Fuck with your bitch for the nights, she ain't the type I keep
I'm pushin' life to the limits, why you mad at me?
Go 'head, nigga, trip if you want, I got a mag with me
I ain't with the talkin', bitch, I don't give no fucks
Niggas talk that gangsta shit, I don't see 'em pullin' up
Ta-tattoos and bullet wounds, little nigga, we been in this shit
You can get it started if you want, but we gon' finish it
You don't like to see a nigga out here tryin' to eat, right?
You'd rather push us 'til we at you with the heat like...

[Chorus: Remo the Hitmaker]
You don't know the things that I went through
Had the heart and soul with everything I do
It took so long just to get me here
And out of all the people why you mad at me?
Why you mad at me for? (Why you mad at me?)
Why you mad at me for? (Why you mad at me?)
Why you mad at me for? (Why you mad at me?)
Why you mad at me for? (Why you mad at me?)
Why you mad at me for?

[Outro: Remo the Hitmaker]
You don't know the things that I went through
Had the heart and soul with everything I do
It took so long just to get me here
And out of all the people why you mad at me?
