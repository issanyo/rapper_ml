Whoa! 50 Cent...
G-Unit! Yeah!

You want beef wit me take a number and get in line
You want pairs with me I pop ya top off with the nine
You mad at me? Shit cause you can't shine
You ain't gettin yours? That's fucked up cause I'm gettin mine

I got an M1 in my hand and fin' ta start killin shit
I'm not the nation's new Malcom X but I'm militant
But I'm suppose to be scared, cause you got a big chest
My four-fifth'll lift you and your motherfucking bench press
While you screamin' war sceneless I'm tryin ta splash
Swing my knife too I'll break off in yo' ass
Niggas get hugged up in a huddle, I know how to clear em out
Four-fifth four shots, that'll fuckin air em out
In the hood niggas love me cause I keept it real
G-Unit niggas they gon' always make bail
Whether it's two G's or twenty G's
Whether they knocked with two pieces and two ki's
Bitch please, get on your knees
You can lick these, balls
I'm not the nigga that you striptease, for
You got a problem I ain't the nigga, to call
Cause I'm more like a pimp than a trick BITCH!

You want beef wit me take a number and get in line
You want pairs with me I pop ya top off with the nine
You mad at me? Shit cause you can't shine
You ain't gettin yours? That's fucked up cause I'm gettin mine

You want beef wit me take a number and get in line
You want pairs with me I pop ya top off with the nine
You mad at me Shit, cause you can't shine
You ain't gettin yours? That's fucked up cause I'm gettin mine
