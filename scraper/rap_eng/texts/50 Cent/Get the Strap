[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Get the grip, find an opp, give him the whole clip (bang)
That's his car pullin' up, shoot up the whole whip
That's his man, hit him too, that nigga down with him
Check his Gram, see who else be hangin' around with him (yeah)
He could get it (uh-huh) him too, nigga, go get the strap
Load it up, spin the block, I know where them niggas at (where?)
Where they at? Who they with? Them niggas gettin' smoked
Line 'em up; they ain't hard to find, all them niggas broke (stupid!)

Get ya clapped if I think you think about trying it

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
A'ight, so boom, first up, all y'all niggas suck my dick
Matter of fact, suck my dick with your mother's lips (stoopid!)
Ah, ah, ah, niggas runnin' out they mouth
Y'all dead-ass like I won't punch you in your fuckin' mouth?
Matter of fact, I'ma smack fire out you, boy
Are you dumb? I'ma beat the brakes off you, boy

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Casanova]

[Post-Chorus: Casanova]
Man, fuck that, my niggas 'bout that action, blood
Catch one frame, my niggas got that strap in, blood
They scrappin', my niggas get to clappin', blood (bo bo bo!)
Fuck wrong with you? I don't like how you actin', blood
(Get up off me)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I am not gang-gang, I do not gang bang
Don't play me like I'm pussy, I will pull up and bang-bang
Niggas get knocked out, then say they gon' pop out
Hop out, oowop out, and air the whole block out
Blow the whole stock out, and I'm 'bout what I'm 'bout
I'm a one-man band, I bring the drum out and dump it
Bend your block, one o'clock, blowin' the trumpet
I'm with the shits, my niggas still hit the licks
I'm stupid rich, still doin' some stupid shit
You niggas know the vibes, scared to come outside
That's the third time you've been got, second time you was shot
Your man just ain't your man, he saw us first and fuckin' ran
We on a different type of time, you on some different shit
Now nigga, don't you play with me, play with a bitch
I ain't ran into a problem that I can't fix
Hit your ass upside the head with a full stick

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Casanova]
(Grrr-rah) Yeah, yeah, go get the strap
(Grrr-rah) Yeah, yeah, go get the strap
(Grrr-rah) Yeah, yeah, go get the strap
(Rrr) Go get the strap (rrr) nigga, go get the strap
(Grrr-rah) Yeah, yeah, go get the strap
(Grrr-rah) Yeah, yeah, go get the strap
(Grrr-rah) Yeah, yeah, go get the strap
(Rrr) Go get the strap (rrr) nigga, go get the strap
