[Intro:]
Yea! A-Team Nigga, 50 Cent..

[Hook: 50 Cent]
We got them semi automatics
And we got them revolvers
We them niggas you should get at
If you got a problem
When them hollow tips hit 'em
Man that should solve 'em
We got the lugers with rugers and M1s and they all for sale
That 9mm, got that 10mm
And that little duece duece (and they all for sale)
Got that new trey pound, And that old four pound
You can use once or twice (and they all for sale)

[Verse 1: Hitchcock]
When it comes to the beef, I been a vet
Got an AK, SKs and the InterTech
If your into vests, I got hollows for the pistol
Official, That rip through your skin and flesh
We the wrong men to test, I got a gun
Dont try to run when you see the  long Amiff n Wess
Cause you dont wanna see me hyper
I keep the pump in the trunk like the DC sniper
And its next to the dusty crate
With the lugers and rugers and the rusty Eigth
And most of the custies hate (Why?)
Cause I got so many guns, they think I must be Jake
I'm tryna get dough, everybody get low
Cause I still won't hessitate to let the Tech blow
Your whole team is petrol
Cause everybody know we stay strapped like cocaine and Freddro (So?)
When you see me burn rubber
I put the 45 to your jersey like Jordan returning

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 2: Ransom]
I got a 50 cal, once you start dumping its over
I Mac 90, take dump in the trunk of the Novas
Its about time you becoming a soldier
With a couple Nines and a fresh box
You'll be slumping 'em over
Plus I got a couple things in the duffle bag
Like a couple Mags, and a snubb nose Glock with the rubber grasp
And I got a good deal for a hundred cash
You could get a tough pair of gloves and a leather mask
Got a Glock 17, its kinda beat up
But it works all it needs is a better beam
And if you get your cream, I could shoot to my cousins house
Get a nice peace you ain't never seen
I got a vest for your body, An M16, SK, O-Tech and a Shotty
Whatever niggas need I got it
From knives to guns, teflon torpedo rockets
I know a bunch of killers, And after Ran serve'em a gun
Them niggas catch bodies like Bruce Willis

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Pre-Verse: 50 Cent]
Infrared on your head, Ain't no sense in you running
It hit your leg and your head and you ain't see me coming
Niggas never know how to act
Till you run up on 'em in the street with the gat
Click Blaow! Old rats

[Verse 3]
[Hitchcock]
Switched to the lobby, lead in your lungs
There's rugers left and a shotty and the head of your son
[Ransom]
The bigger the size, the better the gun
Something like Jessy the body was spitting in Predator 1
[Hitchcock]
And for the most case, all your tools fake
I keep a bald desert eagle like Ghostface
[Ransom]
Who get the most cake, point 'em out to me now
The 4-5th will make him float in a close lake
[Hitchcock]
Its a closed case, so dont tempt me to flip
For I empty the clip in your whole face
[Ransom]
I leave no trace, just a couple of Techs
A chrome Nine, I could scuffle my sweats
[Hitchcock]
So cut me a check, If you dont really want me to stress
Or get left under your car like Chuckie in Fresh

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yooo.., 2003 we evading the streets
Ain't shit you can without us...
