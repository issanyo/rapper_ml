[Hook - 50 Cent]
There's nowhere to run to, when death becomes you
Some say your soul may burn in the flame
Can front if you want too, but niggas who merk you
Will come to your tombstone and piss on your grave
You a rider right?, down to ride tonight?
Nigga you gone ride or you gone die tonight
Nigga cock the steele, it's kill or be killed
Nigga shit is real in the field

[Verse 1 - Billy Danz]
What's the procedures nigga, when you got a hammer in your mouth?
Will you lay down and cry? Will you stand up and die?
Like the man that I am [fire, yes, yes]
I'm a legend in the town, now
Since your all gangstad up let's get the fuck down
Big Bill Danz and I'm reppin for buck town
Niggas see me dummin, I'm coming clutching the pound
Don't worry bout my whereabouts, we air 'em out clear 'em out [yes, yes]
The pressures on now, you need to get your hammers out [d-d-d-dats what's up]
You too tough nigga, you done wrap it up
Brownsville [cl-cl-cl-clap it up]
Fif put in the call, we ready to brawl with every one of you all [yes, yes]

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Lil Fame]
You got these young niggas hollering' [Murda-ra]
Copper tops on my block, like [bloc, bloc, bloc]
Niggas don't give a fuck
I seen a nigga shoot my moms
Right in front of my motherfucking face
See in the 'Ville' ain't no such thing as a stray bullet
When your index finger on the trigger and you pull it
Slugs ain't never out of season
All you gotta do is give a motherfucker one reason
Blood stains on the cement
Same place he stood, that's were you leave em'
And don't back it out unless your squeezing off with your gun
Cause you gone get your punk ass robbed for your gun
You know the drill
I'm a give your ass 3 seconds to bounce
And you better not jog, nigga run
[ONE] Fuck that [gun shot 3x], Dumb bitch, rest in piss

[Hook]
