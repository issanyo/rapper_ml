[Intro: 50 Cent]
When you're breaking it down, keep breaking it down
This is what it sounds like when I'm breaking it down
Yeah, I'm breaking it down
Man, this is what it feels like when I'm breaking it down
When you're breaking it down, keep breaking it down
It's not my fault, it's not my fault
I'm hot man, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
'Til the sun comes up, every night
We party and we party 'til daylight
We be gettin' it in, come on, we gettin' it in
Little Hennessy, a little juice and gin
It's not a fantasy, it's not pretend
We gon' do it, we gon' do it, we gon' do it again
'Til the sun comes up, every night
We party and we party 'til daylight
I shouldn't have to tell you shorty you should know
I'm really really gettin into your freak show
You give me a little, baby, then I'mma want mo'
O.D.B. said it, "I like it raw!"
Exotic erotic we're movin on the floor
Enough to make a nigga lose control
I'm down to go wherever you wan' go
You got a man, I keep it on the low
I do my thing you know I gets my dough
I got a few stacks me and you could blow
We headed to the hotel after the show
I know how to romance ya, be my private dancer

[Hook: 50 Cent]
On your mark, get set girl now here we go
Racin off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down
Ready or not shorty now here I come
Shake that thing girl now back it up
Work it, work it girl you turn me on
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
They say I'm not the same it's cause I'm filthy mayne
I'm off the chain, I don't play no games
I'm hustlin hard homie I do my thang
You fuck with the paper then watch the hammer go bang
Now shorty I like the way she move them hips
I'm tryin to get her in my bedroom and shit
We could take a long time or get it done quick
We can camcord this shit make a boom-boom flick
It's oh so many places that we can go
I really want you shorty, shorty now you should know
Girl your body's callin me, hear you loud and clear
We ain't got to leave now we can do it right here

[Hook: 50 Cent]
On your mark, get set girl now here we go
Racin off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down
Ready or not shorty now here I come
Shake that thing girl now back it up
Work it, work it girl you turn me on
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
The way you move (the way you move)
You make me lose (you make me lose)
All control (all control)
I know you know (I know you know)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You're so seductive you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell you, you know I wanna fuck you
I'm feelin your style, you better watch me now
My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have you I'mma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
The way you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still {*phbbt*}
I shouldn't have to say it shorty you should know
I hope you really gettin into my creep show
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down

[Hook: 50 Cent]
On your mark, get set girl now here we go
Racin off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down
Ready or not shorty now here I come
Shake that thing girl now back it up
Work it, work it girl you turn me on
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down

[Outro: 50 Cent]
It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I could break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I can break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon
