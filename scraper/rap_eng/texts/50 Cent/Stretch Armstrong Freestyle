[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Ayo, what's up, it's 50 Cent
It's Murda Mixtape Vol. 3
Whoo Kid, Stretch Armstrong, nigga
Take that

[Verse 1]
Niggas don't wanna see 50 on a track
I got these cats that rap scared of me like I'm Haitian Jack
Fuck that, if I was you, I'd be scared of me too
Yo Stretch, roll the weed while I tell 'em what I need
I need cream by the stacks, shells for the Mac
Rims for the 'Ac and a bitch to blow her back
I need the coke to come back, mad time on a jack
I got the Fendi sweaters, all I need is the hats
I need the police to chill, stay the fuck off my back
See a nigga in a Benz, swear he peddling crack
I need a stash box, dunn, so I could stash the gat
I need a stadium light to leave 'em blind as a bat
Flipping from under my plate while I'm running from Jake
I make no mistakes, look I need extra papes
My man up North, need the new Stretch mixtape
I'm physically fit -- nah, for real, son, I'm in shape
I need that Beyonce bitch to take me out on a date
Niggas follow my footsteps cause everything I say is slick
But I need y'all niggas to get off my dick
My description in three words ''real witty cat''
I'm in the club in ATL, I'm where the titties at
What, what, 50 Cent nigga, 2000 shit, Stretch Armstrong
Whoo Kid, nigga, Whoo Kid, nigga, Whoo Kid, nigga
What, Whoo Kid nigga, this how it's going down
