Shawty if you love me like your lost and you can't find your way without me
You gon wake up one day when I'm gone thinking why did you doubt me
But you better believe me I take it to the, take it to the, take it to the top
You got to believe me I take it to the, take it to the, take it to the top

(Freeway)
I made you why would I play you?
Not only showered you with gifts I bathed you
Plus I hit the first night and I stayed too
I know it's early but I just thought I would page you
Hey you!
Know that I'm willing and able
You could tell from all the presents that I gave you
Still you
Be acting like you so unfaithful
You swear I'm fucking on a rendezvous
When you think I'm freaking I be on my grind
Even when we not freaking you be on my mind
I'm on the top I'm flipping them dimes
So I can't give you all of my time cause I'm
24 hours a day stuck in a war
At least 8 hours or more cooking them rhymes
So 16 hours just you can hit the store and you complaining you want more free time?..YUP!

You gotta believe me baby you got it easy baby
Fly SWA you watching Feezy baby
You got a mean Mercedes you got a cleaning lady
Heres some advice for you, you better heat it baby
Long as your whip in the room ain't got a strip on them poles
So what the fuck do you care just cause I live on the road
I'm busy gripping them Os's that's how you gripping them clothes
Home I ain't getting no dough I can't be sitting in there
So what if they boyfriends be home baby I'm different then them
I bring them benjamins in look at the kitchen in there
Look at the living room set look at that thing on your neck
Matching that thing on your wrist but got some dV's in there
I give a fuck if they stare I give a fuck what they think
I get them publishing cheques and put the diesel in there
Don't let them people in there
Gas you up and get you all upset!
You in my heart and I'm a keep you there..YUP!

Yeah, Its Philly freezing
Since rock the mic right
I, put you in position to rock the ice right and
Them other niggas be singing the same song
They might
Have what it takes but they handle things wrong
You in your mens. or something you lookin' mean to me
You got to believe in something why not I believe in me
I got the Beamer keys I'm just as clean as these
I smoke the greenest trees
All them niggas be fronting, STUNTIN!
