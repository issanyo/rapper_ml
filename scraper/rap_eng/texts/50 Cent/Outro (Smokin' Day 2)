[50 Cent]
Y-you know what I mean, I'm hot right now, ya heard me
You know what I mean, taking a bitch to the date on a ATM
You wonder why my G-Unit piece spin, I get my hoes dizzy with the piece, ya heard me
They be watchin' the G go around and shit, you know what I'm sayin'
It's big pimpin' goin' on
You tell baby I said, he ain't that know how to do this, ya heard me
I'm a stunna too Baby
