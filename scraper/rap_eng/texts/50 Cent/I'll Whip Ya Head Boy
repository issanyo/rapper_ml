[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
2 niggas in the front, 2 niggas in the back
Thats 4 niggas ridin' strapped in grandpa's Cadillac
The voice in my head say fuck all these niggas
Then I start thinkin', I should rob all these niggas
Man my homies then wan' do whatever I wan' do
I say I wan' eat they say shit we wan' eat too
Let's ride around find a nigga stuntin' on front street
With the shine's on niggas be lookin' like lunch meat
I run up on a nigga, pop one on the floor
Tell um come up off that shit 'fore we start poppin' some more
Fuck a ski mask, man, niggas know who I is
I got a full clip and niggas know I get biz

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'm up early in the mornin', tryna make a move
We come in here with me shorty take your lil' on the school
Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma
I hit her with the llama to get this cake
Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
But she don't know it, damn, OK we'll wait
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
Put a gun to her head sayin' daddy come home
You was rollin' poppin' bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you
That the nine will jam right in my hand

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
I got his homies screamin' Buck you need to calm down
Niggas be gettin' killed everytime you come around
We ran up in his crib, made his momma kiss the ground
She askin' God, what my baby done did now?
I'm takin' everything, jewellery I want it all
Duct tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waitin' we gon' starve waitin' on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow
I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new Jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fuckin' sidewalk
And I'mma be on CNN again it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga left
G-Unit soldier I'm thuggin' till my death

[Verse 4: Billy Danze]
WOO!!! From the midst of the dark barkin it's Bill Gates
From the behind the bodega with two eights
I mean, with intentions of settin yo' ass straight
I mean, yo' ass leakin, bleedin reachin for faith
I mean, you barely breathin, with your soft survivin ass
What happen to your hood vibe with your good ridin ass
What happen to the gangsta that you see on TV
(It was expected!!!) That's cause it was projected in 3D (Come on!!!)
And you don't wanna see, me comin lettin that Mac spit
(BONG!!!!) Send a nigga to a semi back flip
(BONG!!!!) Saratoga Ave nigga act sick
(BONG!!!!) M.O.P. doin this rugged rap shit
