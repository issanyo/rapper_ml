[Verse 1]
Imagine I was broke right now
Saying damn, where my friends go
Catburglar style, I'm coming through your window
Bitch I'm so focused, nigga I'm so focused
Slim chance I'ma go back to killing roaches
Be quiet, you can hear the rats in the wall
Make you want to pump crack til you stack racks
The dope bring the dough in, shawn sister, she hoeing
Like Brenda with her baby, she six months, she showing
For 50 should suck that, for a buck you could fuck that
And you thinking she nasty, but niggas is nasty
Dice game shake em up, praying for a six
The wolves out there hungry, they looking for a lick
Sun down to sun up, they looking for a come up
10-30 in progress right in your projects
They boosting, you like Gucci, they got it
Spot it, and every other high end product
I put you on, my man's man, got a credit card scam
Come through later, I'ma plug you in fam
Niggas pissed on the staircase in an elevator
Now I'm pissed cause I'm starting to smell like piss, player
My little man get bread, I tell you what he doing
He bag up for days till cocaine in his urine
His momma got bills he avoiding the eviction
He play lookout and warn niggas when the dicks coming

[Hook]
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthafucker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthafucker

[Verse 2]
Mikey put his foot to a bitch ass on some pimp shit
10 hoes, 10 g's a night, niggas getting rich
Any nigga get out of line, I got 'em
Southside across my back, I'm from the bottom
All a nigga need is a block and a connect
And a box of 9mm's to load in the tech
The beef all gravy, a nigga half crazy
You pull it, better bang it, 'cause niggas will bring it
That kush moving faster than crack, nigga it's burning
Now move a couple pounds of that, now you're earning
Stack paper on every flip, get the whip
Then get a new bitch and forget the one you with
She said she could do bad all by her damn self
Nigga, let her do bad all by her damn self
A bitch'll tell when the pigs come
Won't even try to make bail when the pigs come
Just let her do her own thing

[Hook]
