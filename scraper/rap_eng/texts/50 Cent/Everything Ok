[Paris - Verse 1]
B to the ... you ask lay low or die slow
If you ain't feeling how I roll
You should stop worry bout shit you can't control
I live like a queen, you live like a flin
Money in the bank bitch my crib got wings
I don't call them haters, call them hallucinators
I only talk dollars, calling the translators
My face move gators crocodile or ostrich
Like they held George Cleverly hostage
They hold me down like a harness
Pushing up more classes than college

[Chorus 50 Cent]
Hey, hey, everything is hey, ok
I stunt when I want, I'm on now I'm balling, hey
Bring us some Don ... more way, hey
Bring us some ... and rose, Hey
Everything is hey, ok, everything is hey, ok
Everything is hey, ok, I'm on now
Everything is hey, ok
