[Intro: Trey Songz & (50 Cent)]
Ay, girl, ay, girl, ay, girl, ay, girl, a-ay, girl
You know its Dr. Dre, girl (Dre, girl)
(Its 50) And Trigga, yeah

[Break: Trey Songz]
Somebody pull the fire alarm, girl, where you from?
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke
All they smell is smoke, girl, they yellin' smoke
All they smell is smoke
The way your body roll, I'ma lose control
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke
All they smell is smoke, girl, they yellin' smoke
All they smell is smoke

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Come on
Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feelin' Hoover
She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample
That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burnin', we smokin'
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back in case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearin' the word is
Me, I'm a P.I.M.P
I let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police comin', you like, put this shit out

[Hook: Trey Songz & 50 Cent]
You like smoke and you got me high
You make a nigga want to get down
High
High feelin' like I'm up in a cloud
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high
So high make your love come down
High
One time, have that ass turnt out
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Shawty hot, she full blown, she hot now
100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to workin' her hips, you know the temperature rise
Oh Lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinkin' damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation, pimpin' ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumpin' crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs
Luther said it: a house is not a home without her
I had 'em panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits
Her wantin' is temporary 'cause for sure she gon' get it, wassup

[Hook: Trey Songz & 50 Cent]
You like smoke and you got me high
You make a nigga want to get down
High
High feelin' like I'm up in a cloud
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high
So high make your love come down
High
One time, have that ass turnt out
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Everybody showin' the love when she at the door
Turn this bitch down, that's fire in the hole
I'm tryina get it and hit it, I don't wanna pass that
Got me addicted, I'm trippin', where the stash at?
Baby, baby, don't you know?
Baby, baby, just like smoke

[Hook: Trey Songz & 50 Cent]
And you got me high
So high
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high
Ring the alarm it's on
High
Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
Ring the alarm it's on
You got me feelin' like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke

[Outro: 50 Cent & Trey Songz]
Ring the alarm it's on
Smoke, you're like smoke
Yeah my nigga, wassup?
Girl, you're like smoke, smoke
Fuck with me
