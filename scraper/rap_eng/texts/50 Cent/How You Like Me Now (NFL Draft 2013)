[Intro: Russell Wilson]
Everyone wants to be a part of something big, important
But to get there you need to prove yourself
No-one's gonna' hand it to you
You have to take it and make it your own

[Verse 1: The Heavy]
Now there was a time
When I you loved me so
See, I been a bad bad bad bad man
That can't wait till you see
(I can't wait)
So how you like me now?

[Russell Wilson]
Too small, too slow
Two words; it doesn't matter
Once your chosen, you're in

[Hook: The Heavy]
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me nowwww?

[Russell Wilson]
Time to step up, stand out
Or get lost in the shuffle
Tell 'em Fifty!

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Fifty
I'm in the track of the draft man
Russell Wilson
I love the number one picks
But I'mma underdog

Pro'lly like me better when I'm down, but I'm up
I'm on my A-game, about to go nuts
The underdog, I stay on top
Everything I touch turn to gold now watch
Hard work, focus, dedication, practice
Disciplin'
I hope you listenin'
My recipe for success
I'm the best
I'mma the ball
Haters can't believe it, I'm all
Wassup!

[Interlude: 50 Cent, NFL Players]
How you like me now?
(50 Cent) He-he!
How you like me now?
(50 Cent) How you like me now?

[Hook: The Heavy]

[Russell Wilson]
(Dominate!)
Someday you'll be on top
(Devastate!)
Someday you'll be a national name
The path for that someday
Starts today
(Let's get this day started!)
It doesn't matter if you the first pick
The seventy-fifth pick
Or the last pick
This is your moment to shine

[Outro: The Heavy, 50 Cent and NFL Players]
(50 Cent) It's time!
I made it!
Today is a new day!
I love you ma
Welcome to the show!

(50 Cent) The draft is on!
