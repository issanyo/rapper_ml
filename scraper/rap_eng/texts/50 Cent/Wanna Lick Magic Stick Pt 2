Lil Kim Hook
You know you want me, you probably want to kiss this
Act like it's Christmas, and put me on your wish list
When it go down, I'm help you pull your whiskers
Put your lips on my lips and taste my honey

50 Cent Verse + Hook
You know you want me, you probably want to lick this
Girl I'm a treat, everyday you can't get this
I'm busy man, I be handling my business
But we can get our freak on on some quick shit
Tonights the night shawty, you'll never forget this
I dim the lights, I get it right I'm like a pimp
Sit right down on the bed, I'll make the clothes disappear quick
I see through her shield, her pearl look pretty clear kid
I'm turned on, I really want to hit
Kiss her neck and nibble, until I way down by her waist kid
Man she's a freak, I'm a freak, I be freakin' off
When she come in with her friends, I'm like take it off
I got a fetish for the cheddar, yeah I'm rich bitch
That don't mean I'm running round buying chicks shit
You see the chrome out, been shining on my new 6
My pinky ring, my neck and my ears and my wrist lick
I like the ice, I'm pretty nice on the dice trips
Twice in row, you know, I got to get the dough
My confidence is high, I know I can hit a lik
My G's pretty good, I know I can get the bitch

Lil Kim Verse + Hook
I'll be your wife, I'll be your girl, I'll be your mistress

But if you ain't spending that dough, you gettin' dismissed
That means you got to me leased like a seamstress
You can't expect nothing less from the Queen, Bitch!
My doggy style make you want to jump on that
Just like a dog on the chase for the kitty-cat
Now he's a freak, I'm a freak, I be freakin' off
He pour the honey on me, then he eat it off
I take his breathe away, Kim leave him speechless
I'm so wet, I have a nigga feelin' sea sick
He in the streets all day, but it's alright
Cause he be back tonight, and then the next night
And then the next night, because the sex tight
I'll be his Advil, I got to keep his head right
He outta town and he feening for me every night
He so addicted, sending for me on the next flight

You know you want me, you probably want to kiss this
Act like it's Christmas, and put me on your wish list
When it go down, I'm help you pull your whiskers
Put your lips on my lips and taste my honey
