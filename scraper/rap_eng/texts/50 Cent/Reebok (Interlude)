[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Man, I told y'all I was finna blow like C-4
Stunt in the G5, fly in the G-IV
G-Unit footwear, G apparel
I'm so hood
That blue and that white looks so good
Hip-hop man, we gon' take it to the next level
Kicks match that hat and that throwback
Kicks stay color coordinated man you know that
Truth is, I ain't got a jump shot, but I got a left hook
I don't swing golf clubs, but I sell like Garth Brooks
I'm hot man, I rock Reeboks, man
If it ain't the G-Unit, it's the S Dot, man

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
S Dot's taking off, G-IV's about to land
See how we cross brand
We boss about it, man
Got the soul of the old Guccis, if you upset sue me
If not sit back and watch me do me
Parking lot pimpin', sideline ballers
We don't sweat up the fresh, let the girls do it for us
The watch talk for me, drop talk for he
Brand new S Dots, walk with me
Sort of like you just scored a bucket
You bowlegged, you frontin', you walkin' awkwardly
Ho, it's nothing keep score with me
Give me three hot seconds
I'll break Reebok records
