I can't smoke weed cause my PO make me piss in a cup
Nigga go 'head disrespect me I'll fuck you up
I ain't talkin bout a fist fight I'll cut ya up
If you don't stitches in your grill mo'fucker then chill
As a young buck niggas always knew I bust
See me go to school on a smaller bus
I'm a straight A kid I'm getting all this paper
Just said scribble lines and see where it take ya
Had violent tendencies so they thought I was dumb
While the so called smart kids was poppin gum
I'm thinkin bout poppin a gun to get the lump sum
Grandpa my role model used to suck on a bottle
A pint of Crown Royal make ya insides boil
??? like being gay cause his back go out
He's the one who taught me what be being blacks about
I peeped the roaches on the wall they fall
And crawl on my friends
We risk sittin up em pen's {*gunshot*}
In the hood we hit the number but never the lotto
Life in the fast lane, one wheel, hit the the throttle
Let's go, let's flow nigga
War, what is it good for, absolutely nothing
But niggas keep frontin'
Fuck it nigga live like a soldier die like a solider
War, what is it good for, absolutely nothing
But niggas keep frontin'
Fuck it nigga live like a soldier and die like a solider
War...
