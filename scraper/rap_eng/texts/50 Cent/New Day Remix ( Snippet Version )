Alicia Keys [Hook]

Celebrate and say
Aye, aye, aye, aye aye

Dr. Dre & 50 Cent [Verse]

I woke up this morning thinking about the old me
When I was feeling like, milling like it own me
Nothing matters but the music, music my first love
You think you chasin I’m always coming the first ’cause
I’m feel forced I’m better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I’m coming to greet you
Like Dr. Dre
