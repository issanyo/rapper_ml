[Intro/Bridge: 50 Cent]
You just be fucking for free
You just be fucking to fuck
You might end up in the sheets
But you never end up in love

[Verse: Rotimi]
She like to twerk and sweep it up (sweep it up)
Your honey's just a bunch of ones (yeah)
She quick to take her panties off (splat)
You rich, you might be on to sum
She be non-stop looking for a baller
Wanna kinda spend this money on her (whoo)
Tryna fork a million to a porsche
Girls it's a shame, girl it's a shame

[Hook: Rotimi]
How you got all these bodies

[Verse: T.I.]
Hard nigga, you call a fan
Screw currency, blur all your prayers
Boy suck a dick, son fuck a bitch
Saw all the money here shawty gonna get
I tell 'em fuck 'em, if you fuck make 'em pay for it
Have you ride through Atlanta in a RAV4
You ain't even have to trick to get a blow job
And still all y'all here wanna taste for it
Okay, she ridin' the dick like a skateboard
That mean a pussy-mo nigga have to pay for it
When we ride in the 5, better hotbox
With some dick all in her face like botox
Okay I skeet on her buttock
Convertible, what-not
See me doin' donuts, in front of the bus stop
You try to get cussed out or worse get bust on
See why she don't claim you as the dick she fucked on

[Hook: Rotimi]

No, it ain't no feelin's wit' me
But she gon' still let me beat
She gon' do that anyway

[Bridge: Rotimi]
First she only fuckin' wit' ya if ya got a check, then she wanna be broke up
So every time she get to talkin' bout relationships, that's when I don't talk
You been out here runnin' game for so long
So girl it's a shame, girl it's a shame

[Hook: Rotimi]
