{*this song borrows the beat and style from Raphael Saadiq's "Be Here"*}

[Intro - Tony Yayo talking] *echo*
YEAH!, you're rockin' wit the talk of New York
Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent
G-UNIT, and here we go!

(*Saadiq sings "you should be here," and other parts of the song
In the background throughout the intro and most of the song*)

[50 Cent - Singing] - (Raphael Saadiq)
You should be here wit me bitch
You should come and make me rich
Girl you know you need a pimp
Girl you know you drive me crazy (drive me crazy)
You should be here wit me bitch (ooh, ooh, girl)
Girl you know you drive me crazy
Bitch, (you should be here)

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent] - (Raphael Saadiq) [Tony Yayo]
Bright and early in the mornin' come up short with my money
And for sure I'll kick your ass bitch [what you say]
(You should be here) You fuckin' with them other niggas
But you know you love the niggas, switch to a pimp bitch [BITCH]
(You should be here) You fit into my stable of hoes
You from Atlanta, I'm from New York, but I'm "throwin them bows"
(You should be here) Right here next to me
Girl I know you tired of fuckin' for free [WOO, Sing along]

[Hook 1 - 50 Cent] - (Raphael Saadiq) [Tony Yayo]
(You should be here)
You should be that bitch that come, everytime I call
(You should be here)
You should be down on your knees, tryin' to break me off [uh huh, uh huh]
(You should be here)
You should be that bitch, that buy me shit all the time
(Well I wish you were here)
You should be my bottom bitch, out on the grind (you should be here)

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks] - (Raphael Saadiq) [Tony Yayo] {50 Cent}
Bust in your ass, winter, spring, or summer
I'm a winner, I'm ain't a regular nigga, ho [Lloyd Banks]
(You should be here) Runnin' wit a pro, I ain't a beginner
Niggas know, what, you wanna percentage, no {Hell no}
(You should be here) Walkin' the track, rain, hail, sleet, snow
Anythin' to speed up the process of the cash flow {gotta get that money man}
(You should be here) Catchin' a date, and breakin'll keep me straight
Even if you gotta take it in the ass hole {you take it in the ass}

[Hook 1 - 50 Cent] - (Raphael Saadiq) [Tony Yayo]
(You should be here) You should be that bitch that come [uh huh]
Everytime I call [I told ya'll motherfuckers]
(You should be here) You should be down on your knees
Tryin' to break me off (you should be here)
You should be that bitch, that buy me shit all the time
[Yo, 50 get on that 50 shit one time, my nigga]
You should be my bottom bitch, out on the grind

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent] - (Raphael Saadiq) [Tony Yayo]
Uh, yeah, (you should be here)
Look, I don't really need you, I get my dough, bitch
I got some Coupe's, I got some jeeps, I got some mo' shit
(You should be here) I stay wit some hoes, cause I use those twos [uh huh]
I keep a Benz, I keep some rims, and I stay with some jewels
(You should be here) I'm internationally known, man everybody know me
Way down in McNolly, they feelin' me wodie
(You should be here), but you can catch me in Houston, with Bun and Pimp C [C]
Or in Miami, wit Luke and VIP [yeah]

[Hook 2 - Raphael Saadiq - singing]
(You should be), you should be here with me babe

Girl you know you drive me crazy
(You should be) You should be here with me babe (ew, ew, girl)
(Girl I wish you were here) I just wanna drive ya babe

[Outro - Tony Yayo - talking]
I told ya'll motherfuckers G-UNIT is takin' over this shit man (*echo*)
(You should be here) We run the hood (*echo*)
And we run these motherfuckin' offices (*echo*)
