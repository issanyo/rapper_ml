[Hook]
It's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say
Or Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain

[Verse 1]
No more freestyles and verses killing Sticky and Ja
I'm moving on now, I got bigger fish to fry
Since How to Rob, a lot of niggas been namin' names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game
Still niggas actin' like I don't get down or something
Like I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips 'til we run in your crib
And you gon' ask dumb questions like, "Can I live?"
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me, you're brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the Mac and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Tone and Poke, they better have my bail
But if its over a mil, don't put the crib up dun
Cause if fifty get free nigga, fifty gon' run

[Hook]
It's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say
Or Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain

[Verse 2]
Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a poor no more
I ain't gotta steal from the corner store no more
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the floor no more
Bouncers don't try to play me at the dough no more
But when they see me, they say..
"Search him, he might have the nine"
He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne"
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feeling it, the Benz pulling up on the set
Me jumping out, 30 thou on my neck
And since you said it was nothing to sweat
You was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kicking, Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how, he reacts under pressure
Til Makaveli returns, it's all eyes on me
Til the feds build a case or find files on me

[Hook]
It's best you be a gentleman and you watch what you say
Or Jesus Christ can't save you, once you go 'gainst the grain

[Outro]
It's gangsta, 2000 shit
Y'all know what you need to do, get together
Make a "We Are the World" record, faggot ass niggas
