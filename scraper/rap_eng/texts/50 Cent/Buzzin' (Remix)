[Hook: Mann]
Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Audi R8, laid back
Black on Black
Diamonds on my neck and my wrist matchin that
Black mask, black mag, brown bag
Drop down now or i'll shoot your black ass
I'm a magnet to money, the paper I'm where it's at
They attracted to me, they treat me like Pimp C
I'm a P-I-M-P yo chick just chose me
I got so much swag, is that why you mad?
Control your hatred
Nothing good to say don't say shit
Keep walkin' quit talkin' keep it movin'
We can keep the club jumpin' till daylight
From New York to LA through the Bay right

[Verse 2: Mann]
Uh , back up to back up in the mix like that
And I know ya like it when it's just like that
All the girlies just love my swag
From my kicks to the way I fix my hat
I'm back
Fresh like some new J's
Brodie got next NBA 2K
I'm too paid
Shaded with some ladies
Reppin' my city
West LA baby !
West LA made me this way
Two rules :
Stay fresh , homie and get paid (hey!)
Never broke and never bummy
I'm from where it's forever sunny

[Hook: Mann]
Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Bridge: Mann]
When I come around , 'round , 'round
They go
Yeah , yeah it's going down , down , down
They go

[Verse 3: Mann]
New cat with a old school feel
Only new artist with a old school deal
Tied to the game by Steve Lobell
So we always win , don't receive no help
New girls act like they know me so well
But I shows no love and be like oh well
When my album drops , sure as hell goin' sell
Stack cash and laugh like L-O-L

[Hook: Mann]
Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Bridge : Mann]
When I come around , 'round , 'round
They go
Yeah , yeah it's going down , down , down
They go
When I come around , 'round , 'round
They go
Yeah , yeah it's going down , down , down

[Verse 4: Mann]
Yee-uh Yee-uh
Shawty in my ear
Saying all the things that I wanna hear
Buzzin' !
And as the night ends
I'mma have her and get all her friends
Buzzin' !
Okay , hands in the air (Yee-uh)
From the back to the front
Everywhere
Buzzin' !
Throwin' out 20's
Throwin' out hundreds
Ladies gotta love it
