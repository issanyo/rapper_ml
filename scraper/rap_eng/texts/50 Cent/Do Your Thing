[Verse 1: 50 Cent]

Sometime she love me, sometime she love me not
Hustler affection, Correction, I hug the block
2-4-7 7days a week 12 months 3-6-5 a nigga so loved

[Hook: Shaun White]
Girl your so beautiful
Baby girl for me would you ride or die
I know you Know you can be my bonnie god I can be your clyde
Girl do your thaaaaang

Pretty girl just do your thing
Yeah pretty girl just do your thing x2

[Verse 2: Paris]
Its like this
Sometimes I love em sometimes I dont
Sometimes I will sometimes I won't
Sometimes I flip so it ain't too easy
Wifey of a hustler not liek them other breezys
Im a lover im a confidant when we in the streets
I like to hold the fire arm
I plug it for ya
Take a bullet for ya
If you ain't in the streets il distribute for ya

Ride or die drink fuck get high
Do it again, livin the same, but it feels good
Boss nigga he could check me when a nigga should
