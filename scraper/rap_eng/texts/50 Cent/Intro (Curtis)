[Sound of a car trunk opening]

[J (Andrew Howard)]
Here ya go, man

[Eddie (Matthew Rhys)]
Jesus Christ, man, you're going to war

[J (Andrew Howard)]
What I say? Didn’t I say come to me? Do I ever disappoint? Fucking no. Why? I deliver. Why? I’m your man. How do I know? How? Know? *No* Know how. I got 100 things to do this morning and you’re first in line so could we move it along please?

[Eddie (Matthew Rhys)]
Okay. Fine. Right. I’m just looking for something, small, light, cheap. .380, .32. Something like that

[J (Andrew Howard)]
No, no, no. You want to be packing like a man, Eddie, you’re a man, man. How ‘bout this.. 6-inch 3-5-7 magnum?

[Eddie (Matthew Rhys)]
Yeah

[J (Andrew Howard)]
Automatics. Browning 9-mill. Now I know what you’re thinking, that’s got no stopping power, but that’s got 13 shots in the clip, man. That won’t just kill a man, that’ll turn him inside out, pull him upside down, piss on him, read him his last rights...

[Eddie (Matthew Rhys)]
Alright, fine. Yeah, I get the message, I’m just.. I'm just a bit fucking lost there. And these are totally untraceable?

[J (Andrew Howard)]
They don’t exist

[Eddie (Matthew Rhys)]
What about guarantee's?

[J (Andrew Howard)]
What do you think this is? Guns-Are-Us?
