Clicky Clang Clicky Clang
The money goes into my piggy bank
Clicky yo shout out Lloyd Banks
This is New York Bitch

I could ask you?
Rap until your face gon
This little pussy hurt him arm throwin some baseballs
He a rapper now? I pact the crowd with some killer that be acting wild
You jack my style? it come back around
Pent House, my place sick
Your ph is basic
Face it you don't rap like this
When I type shit you like this
Fight this unless you righteous
You know you nicest when you the rapper for the white kids and Isis
You don't work like this
Twerk my dick then dismiss
Cuz this the night shift bitch this is the life
You made it first but you not paid
Rappers want a verse for verse well this ain't scott trade
Feelin like Lincoln Dred Scott decision
Sitting on top they plot but won't stop the vision
Why I smile ear to ear?
Scott is king
What's clear is clear
My ride remote start designed the most art since Mozart
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm so smart
Reminiscing bout the past when I'd finish last sipping Guinness Draft
Now even if she dick I'm in her Ass
My flow concern em like the foe of Joe Paterno
No Jerry Sandusky but very few trust me
Uh forget the rock that I got
I'm still I'm still Scott from the block
Mpan buncha actors and wangstas
Gabor's take action we gangsta
Remember that
