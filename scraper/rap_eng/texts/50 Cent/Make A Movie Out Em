Niggas know me man, I make a movie out em

Talk crazy when I ain't around there
I make a movie out 'em

When niggas wanna front, I make a movie out 'em
I'll leave em flat on his face with shit oozin' out 'em
When niggas wanna stunt, I know what to do about 'em
Hand me that gat, I make an action packed movie out 'em
When niggas wanna front, I make a movie out 'em
I'll leave em flat on his face with shit oozin' out 'em
When niggas wanna stunt, I know what to do about 'em

We by the bar with the Cris, gorillas in the mist
You muthafuckas tryna front, I go bananas with the clips
Got a hollow tip habit, I'll bulletproof the whips
My tires run on flats, you know I stay with gats
I hit the stash, pop out the mac, try and pop out ya back
More to sweat, i'll pop out ya rat

I'm not the maintenance man. I'm the super, bitch
You give super head, I'll make you super rich
I mean stupid rich, I know lots of tricks
Type niggas that don't think and follow they dick
What more can I say, it's a beautiful day
Your vest ain't gon' work if you're hit with the K
Some prayin' to spray, yet not in the way
You runnin', you pussy, you're scared of me!
