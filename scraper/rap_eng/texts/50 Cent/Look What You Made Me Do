[Verse 1]
Now if I pull out the gat and just push your wig back
I bet niggas will stand around sayin' "Damn who did that?"
I'm the type nigga to dare you to touch the jack
I'm the type to borrow your gat then won't give the shit back
Im F to the I - F -T - Y - C - E - N - T
Caress the ass gently in back of Bentleys
You thought she was pimpin, son I was in the Hamptons
In a heart shaped hot tub with the bitch flappin
I'm planning to take over New York then start expanding
Was Bob Marley singing about teks when he sung "I'm Jammin'?
Nigga fuck with my cash and I'll blast yo' ass
Snatch the Glock out the stash in the dash in mash
Flee in a flash, lay low let time go past
If you survive the shots I'ma find yo' ass
Put the gat to your head and remind your ass
I ain't playin' with you, I want my money motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Yo, some nigga just shot the block up dog, word?
He had the same shit you got on dog, word?
I know you done did it so get the fuck up outta hear, ya heard?
I run with niggas that'll spray and strip and stay there shit
You won't let us pump on your block, fuck it, we makin it hot
I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch
From the cordless cell phone in baby blue drop
I got a lot of hungry niggas with me straight from the street
These industry niggas are startin' to look like something to eat
They got watches on they wrist that cost like 60 thousand
My niggas living on section eight in public housing
They'll murder you and keep the shit low cause niggas heard of you
Them b-more niggas is rowdy rowdy
Them Detroit niggas is bout it bout
If they say they gonna kill ya nigga don't you doubt it
Got your gun well don't leave home without it


[Verse 3]
Yo, your man could have ran when I robbed him but he froze
Son I ain't even rock him to sleep, the nigga dozed
The bitch could have helped you get rich, but she chose
Now you heart broke, that's what you get for lovin' them hoes
An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it's like a stickup kid
Runnin round without no heat, it's like a fifth with no kick
A fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit
A bad bitch that won't blow dick
It's like a rollie with no ice, a gamblin' spot with no dice
Like fuckin' supermodel bitches and not bustin' off twice
I murder any mic device, for the right price, I'm nice
I only say things once, never twice, don't fuck with me
