[Intro]
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this

[Verse 1]
The only thing hotter than my flow is the block
That's why I left this snow biz and got into show biz
Let's get this clear, it ain't on 'til I say it's on, it's on
I'm eating, ya'll niggas fasting like it's Ramadan
Bowlish way in Lebanon know 50 the bomb
I be at the edge of the bar sipping a Don
I keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on
This word is bond, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong
You want war? I take you to war now that my money long
Why you broke cats is by the bylines and fantasize
The way I'm spitting, put TV's in everything I sit in
While I'm hot to death I'm gonna say this to all you player haters
Ya'll should hate the game not the players, come on

[Chorus]
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

[Verse 2]
Everyday is bugged, niggas will come to a club
To try to show you they a thug instead of showing some love
Now what you think you chump me if I let you bump me
When I'm about to make a mill faster than you make a G?
I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor
And in the crack game I'm a franchise player
Niggas be thinking I be out to lunch with mines
Then in crunchtime I start hitting 'em hard with punchlines
You cats got to be sick to think 50 can't spit
Better check my batting average, I always make hits
My flow leave these rap cats petro, all across the metro
Plus I pack a cannon up under my Marc Buchanan
They fake, they look like money, but ain't worth half the cake
Have me running from Jake in a GS with bad brakes
They want to knock the take for Christ sakes

[Chorus]
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

[Verse 3]
Yo, son remember them fake players who try to play us
At *The Shark Club* in Vegas
Had them tight linen blazers and beat up gators
Looking like last year's players
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low when we came through the do'
I copped a case of Cristal, he copped one bottle of Mo
From the look in the dude's face and the bulge in his waist he holding
(Yeah he's packing, I can see his rack
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him, son)
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run since '81
They ain't here on a hunt for food
So they could catch you some cash and expensive jewels
I'm gonna crash 'em with this bottle if he move
I ain't the one, son, my shit ain't come easy
It won't go easy, believe me

[Chorus]
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)
I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

[Outro]
Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this
Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this
