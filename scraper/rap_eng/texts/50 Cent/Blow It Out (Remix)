[Ludacris]
OWWWWWWW!!!

[Verse - Ludacris]
I never used to snore in my sleep till this rap shit started
Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon stop?! BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast
But bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all prayin that I flop?! BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Niggas hate givin me props cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Hook - Ludacris] (2x)
If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong
But after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Verse - Ludacris]
It's time to saddle up the Tontos cause I'm the Lone Ranger
I eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers
I'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer
If you ever think of stoppin me - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall
Next year I'm lookin into buyin Greenbriar Mall
You probably own a lot of proper-ty! BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls!
Plus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'm a throw you a curve
You mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words
I'm a start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves
Pepsi's the New Generation? - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Hook]

[Verse - 50 Cent]
These niggas be frontin, they hate it when we stunting
They see us in Caddy's and coupes and Benz's and it's nothing
They act like they got something, we don't deserve - something
Nigga hate it, like it or love it or - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
It's simple, top of the charts, number one wit a bullet
Disturbin Tha Peace and G G G G Unit!
Got it locked boy, get ya shot boy
You don't like that we're on top boy, okay - BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
From NY to ATL, we get it crunk bitch
Semi-auto on my waist, I don't play that pump shit
Motherfuckers think that I blew up real fast
But I've been underground a long time so BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
I got candy paint, on my '65
Impala holla at my shorty if you ready to ride
Whacha mean your ass ain't got money for gas?
Then get the fuck out, you're mad? so what, BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!

[Hook]

[Outro - Ludacris]
Yeah! History has been made!
Ludacris and 50 Cent! real recognize real
If you're feeling a little awkward about the situation
Don't hesistate to just BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS!
