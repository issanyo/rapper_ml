[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah
Supposed to have a remix
That's how you make
One hit record, and then two
Haha, 50 Cent
G G G G G-Unit
I remember when you used to love me
You used to kiss and hug me
I look into your eyes and get lost for a day
You love me is what you told me
All the time I let you hold me
How I in fear you slippin' away

[Verse 1: Justin]
You were my sun, you were my earth (Uh huh)
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no (G G G G G-Unit)
So you took a chance, and made other plans (Yeah)
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no (C'mon)

[Hook 1: Justin]
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from, him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me, there'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

[Hook 2: Justin]
You told me you love me (Whoo)
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone (Uh huh, Uh huh)
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy (Yeah)
The bridges were burned
Now its your turn, to cry

[Hook: Justin]
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Yeah, yeah (Ahhh)

[Verse 2: Justin]
You know that they say somethings are better left unsaid (Uh huh)
It wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it, Don't act like you don't know it (Yeah)
All of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my mead)
Should of picked honesty
Then you may not have thought it
Yeah (whoo)

[Hook 1: Justin]
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from, him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me, there'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it? (Uh huh)

[Hook 2: Justin]
You told me you love me (Whoo)
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone (Uh huh, yeah)

It's done in the dark, comes to light, I'm flippin' kick it to curb
Your smile all up in my face, girl you gotta a lot of nerve
Situation so absurd
You ain't special, you's a bird (Whoo)
