(My rear view mirror is vibrating)
Nigga I’m all turnt up, my trunk is shakin’

I’m all turnt up, I’m all turnt up

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
I got a trunk full of tens
I got a stash full of ends
I got that 64 Regal sittin’ on 20″ rims
Got that Beamer that Bentley
I got that 63 Benz
And a white bitch to suck dick like tomorrow’s the end
Call her head game the Hoover I mean the way she maneuver
Up and down, up and down, and a nigga head spin ’round
She’s a fellatio pro, I get off watching her go
She get to takin’ it deep, and put a nigga to sleep

[Hook]

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
Its on now, ’cause these bitches gyrating
We strapped right, cause niggas be violatin’
Party poppin’ she goin’ drop it she ain't stoppin’
Sittin’ watchin’ system knockin’ hips rockin’ pussy poppin’ tic-toc-in
Make it rain trick, make it, make it, make it rain trick
Play the game bitch, shit make us both rich
Fuck the wimp shit its certified pimp shit

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
It feel like my mind playin’ tricks on me
