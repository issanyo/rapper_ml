When the drama get to poppin it don't bother me(it don't bother me)
When the shell casings get to droppin it don't bother me(it don't bother me)
When the wolves come out for the robberies (it don't bother me)
Cuz they know who I be (it don't bother me)

Nigga I'm always strapped I sleepwalk with the hammer
I bump into you wake up then blam ya
It's a new day, switch the k
Semi the fully and spray, nigga u can die 2day
Duck or get out the way
Every nigga I know hoop dreaming or scheming
Morphine and dope the fiends still leanin
I'm a chip off the whole block, whip off the old lot
I'll rip off ya whole spot, let a clip off and more shots
Niggas love Big Poppa, ?was niggas around
Cuz I don't let them eat I lay my muscle game down
Imagine if there was no preme there was no cat
And the game was run by prince and run by pat
It's the killa season, who the fuck need a reason
These faggot niggas cheesin, til they hit and they bleedin
Peacetalks save it, squeeze the milli waive it
I cause a crimewave, 9 body's in 9 days
Lyin sideways, havin the beam on the sidepage
Call me genius cause I know shit that u don't know
U goin work for me or u goin starve to ya bones show
And u can talk dawg but it ain't shit u can tell me
I'm filthy rich still eatin peanut butter and jelly
Ain't nothin changed but the chips,the cribs and the whips
You know me yeah I'm always switchin a bitch
Like gooding? on the mount, you know switchin a pitch
I don't know nothin about baseball but I'm pitchin the bricks

It Don't Bother Me Neither Nigga

My niggas all ignorant they don't listen to rap
They just fuck with the hoes and they be twistin the caps
We all millionaires that be (stealin in stores) still in the stores
I don't pay for no G Unit's, I just walk out the door
This ain't no funny money this here the real deal
We got enough of this shit to go get osama killed
Pay a lil nigga to go figure out where ya momma live
Leave her address in the mailbox and go sign the deal
I don't need no helpin hand for no other man
My name ain't Game, I'm really who I say I am
I think I'm getting more accustomed to the beef
Just caught a rapper yesterday and stuck him for his piece
I love New York City, New York can hate me
I ate up Ja Rule and made his fans pay me
I look at this Joe dude and think about soul food
Ever since Big Pun died, homie ain't have no clue
We spose to be friends man, thought we was cool
Yeah I smoked a blunt with u Jada, but fuck u 2
You know how gangstas do, they ride with choppers in they car
They sippin on syrup and they don't listen 2 Nas

[Spider Loc]
I'ma banger homeboy u don't know how I done been 2 bat
Up against the enemy, it's in me I'm just into that
Talk tough on the turf and I swear I'ma attend to that
And you can take that vest off cuz I'ma put em in ya hat
Point blank walk up ain't never did a drive by
Catch a nigga slippin and let the 4-5 fly
Fif got the east, Buck the one in the south
And the west coast is mine, these niggas runnin they mouth

[Mase]
It's like a nigga play with murda cake
One in his vertabrae
You crazy enough to play with me then u deserve a wake
Of course a nigga word a wait, I raise the murder rate
Clap a shot at the cops like I never heard of jakes
I been pumpin d, since days of humpty
They can make a million dollars just bein my flunky
I got a set of soldiers that I send outside to check my motor
You don't respect a loader then u neglect a odor
I see em, collesium Mama have to Id em
If the boy is muslim, I lay em in the mosseleuim?

G-G-G-G-U know what it is nigga
Hook

U heard him nigga

Hook
