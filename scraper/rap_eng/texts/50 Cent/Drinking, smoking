Said I can't let go of you
Said I don't know what to do

(50 Cent):
I met Satan any day near from time to time
Fucked around, called them both friends of mine
I'm a bad judge of character, I told her I love her
Not much later she was my baby's mother
I was feeling that girl, man she was my bitch
Started out as sugar and she turned to the shit
For my account what she wanted is what she can get
Man we came from nothing, how could I forget
When the drop of candle was finished she could have the last sip
When I had two dollars I gave her one I ain`t trip
She has a daughter before me fuck who made her I raised her
Guess that counts for nothing now everybody wanting
Something from a nigga thought the money would make it all gravy
Instead it made the closes people to me go crazy
Now niggas smoking and drinking a 6-pack
But I don`t want the bitch back(uh)

(Dave Young)Verse 1
Normally I`m just waiting for you to call me
Normally I ain`t tripping up bout nothing
Normally I`m steady doing my thing
But now my hustle seems so hard for me
Normally I can just shake it off
But right now that's not easy at all
I`m trying to just ease the pain take it day to day
Trying to get it away

(Hook)
So I got a blunt in my right hand
Then I got this drink in my left hand
And I`m just drinking smoking drinking smoking
Trying to get her out my head
And it hurts me more when I see
That you're happier with out me
So I`m drinking smoking drinking smoking
Trying to get her out my head
(Said I`m trying to get her out my head)

(Verse 2)
Normally I`m calm and collective
But right now I`m just young and restless
And I ain`t talking bout the show
I`m taking bout the love that I can`t let go
Normally I don`t feel like this
Normally I`m just going to the next
But this is so different don`t know how to deal with this

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
Man I don`t know what to do with my self
Cuz when ever I try to get out I can`t help
Missing you thinking of you
All them little things that we used to do
And I can`t let go of all them memories
So I drank I smoke to help me
Clear my mind ease my mind
Thats my reason why
