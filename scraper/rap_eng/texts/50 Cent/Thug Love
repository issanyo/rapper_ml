[Intro: 50 Cent]
What y'all know about this fab shit, huh?
TE, baby, come on, Trackmasters

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Look we can shop together, mama, his and hers
Fifth Ave. shit, baby, Fendi furs
I ain't tight with the chips, girl, I'm down to splurge
If it's ice you like I'll light up your life
VS2 Clarity, aight?
I play the block, I ain't the type to punch a clock
I'm the type to put the pedal to the floor in the drop
I live life in the fast lane, I mix dro wit hash
Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It's like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head full of bullshit a lot
I gave her jewels that I caught of a jux
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty, every now and then she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon' write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

[Hook: Destiny's Child]
A thug's what I want, a thug's what I need
Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thugged out no good baby

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Ayo, I treat you like you need to be treated like you're special
Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you
When I met you it was Guess and Gap, now it's Gucci and Prada
Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo, when shorty say she hate me you know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar that mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She wanna flip, threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some hominy grits
That's how she on it, when I met her she was lowkey
Now she wanna OD
You know me, I let her do her thing, son
I say what I'm feeling, niggas say that I'm illing
I sip Cristy so I'm pissy like a staircase in your building
What?

[Hook]

[Outro: Beyonce]
A thug is what I want and a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand how my baby laces me
A thug is what I want and a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand and I think it's jealousy
