[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, soon as they hear my voice right, there goes 50
Soon as they hear it in the club, they'll know to move

[Chorus: 50 Cent (2x)]
Y'all niggas better move
When you see me come through
Y'all niggas better move
Or find out what my gun do
Y'all niggas better move
When you see that trey pound
Y'all niggas better move
Or stick around and get laid down

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm from the slums where crack get slung and gats get slung
D's run up in niggas cribs so we clap at them
I got two felonies this my third strike
I might as well go out this bitch wit' a bang right?
Niggas think cause I'm doin' good I'll flip and get on some shiny shit
The hood fucked me up, my brain still stuck on that grimey shit
My chain look good, your chain look good
I'll pop, shine it, and it sell it to a nigga from my hood
I don't know you, before rap you'se a fan-ass nigga
A stan-ass nigga, noname brand ass nigga
When I say get up, nigga, get up smooth
When I say get low, nigga, that ass better move
You flash jewels, I flash tools, nigga, cash rules
I'm nuts like cashews, blow ya ass out ya shoes
Make the news, short fuse, a nigga's screws loose
With my trey 8, I get it poppin' like Bishop from Juice

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Y'all niggas better move
When you see me come through
Y'all niggas better move
Or find out what my gun do
Y'all niggas better move
When you see that trey pound
Y'all niggas better move
Or stick around and get laid down
Y'all niggas better move

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Y'all better move, nigga, get out the way
Cause I'm holdin', I could put a hit out today
And I'm frozen, blowin' that blue shit out the bay
And none of y'all niggas fuckin' wit' the kid okay?
I'm thinkin' 'bout who to [?] next
They want the juice and I'm Omar Epps
I go hard yet, nigga, you som' like a old corvette
And I'm a Maybach, I stay strapped for [?]
I calm my nerves with a chocolate or a haysack
Thinkin' of ways to pop up wit' a grey plaque
And several knots in my pocket from today' track
So I get more head than any stocking or a wavecap
They get it poppin' in the crowd when they perform
Don't come to one of our concerts wit' alligators on
They bigger and back and forth with the bank  matters
So I'll prolly die shootin' like Hank Gathers

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Y'all niggas better move
When you see me come through
Y'all niggas better move
Or find out what my gun do
Y'all niggas better move
When you see that trey pound
Y'all niggas better move
Or stick around and get laid down
Y'all niggas better move
