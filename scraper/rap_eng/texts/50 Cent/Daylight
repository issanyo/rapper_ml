[Part 1: Eminem "Pistol Poppin'"]
Maybe I just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
We gotta push 'em to the back
Move 'em along, push 'em aside, don't get me wrong
I love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
It's got a catch but come on man, the raps
We all gotta step our game up; especially these lame fucks
Who walk around with their chest out
Just tryin' to be down with anybody who's left now
Better be down with them, huh
But I dare some bitch to say somethin' about, Eminem
Cause I'm not in the mood to be playin' around with dudes
I already seen two friends get shot in the head
And lay on the ground this year and, one didn't make it
Proof, you are the truth
Please don't let us come face to face with these boo-boo-hoo
Fake-ass tattooed havin'
Fif' please tell 'em right now how hard it has been
For me to try and, stay out it
But they just won't quit runnin' their mouth
At least 'til there's a gun in it; son of a bitch!
We all got shooters, yeah these days who doesn't?
And as far as the snaps and claps, I wasn't
Dissin' the South, that isn't what this is about
I just so sick of the beef, I don't even wanna see anymore

[Hook: Chester Bennington "Wastelands"]
(In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose)
In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today!
(Today, today, today, today)

[Part 2: 50 Cent "Hate It or Love It"]
Yeah
Uh-huh
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out my melody"
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could (if I could)

[Bridge: 50 Cent "Hate It or Love It"]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Hook 2: Chester Bennington "Wastelands"]
In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today! (Today, today)
In the wastelands of today! (Today, today)
In the wastelands of today! (Today, today)
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today! (Today, today)
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today! (Today, today)
