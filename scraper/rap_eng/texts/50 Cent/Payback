[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I made my flow up at the corner store
Mad niggas rapping out here, I just want it more
Turn the music down, you can hear my stomach roar
Bagged a hundred bitches last year, just bagged a hundred more
They hating but everything that goes comes back
Sticky green fun pack, jewelry make me hump-back
Back packers want that and they ain't bout the diamond shit
Goon gone commercial, who the fuck you think you rhyming with
I got the drama, kid, and my Obama whip
Bitches running up on my stage, Lil Mama shit
Ugh, lil' mama thick, and my time is slim
Come bout thirty minutes after I put the condom in

[Hook: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]
I'm getting to the dough, Louie on my foot
Put the pedal to the floor, is all a nigga know
Payback, don’t come around here disrespecting
We dont take that, I’m on my letters every second
And my hearts so cold, man I don't trust a soul
It’s funny how the bullshit goes, you never know
Payback, don’t come around here disrespecting
We don't take that, I’m on my letters every second

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
They crown me with the punch hat, who better?
I hit red skins, smoke green, and spit blue pepper
Benz blue leather, jet cool weather
Cool meaning hot, so I don’t need the top
Calm down, breath and stop
Start and I’mma skip your pulse
Miss my life’s the shit
Calamari, shrimp, and boats
C-notes, 5 Ferrari, different coast
I’mma suits em up, well I probably ain't gotta lift my toes
I shut my doors on ‘em like Jehova's witness
I done made it to the top like I said, I told you bitches
They don’t really want me they just want my riches
So motherfuck them all: friends, cousins, and sisters

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I turn the club to TV, come dancing with the stars
Then I’m in your ear, in her ear, amping a menage
Nigga done made the money, but never knew how it felt
In a hundred pair of pants, thats a hundred different belts
Stress kills, chronic helps, pussy just for the moment
Balling like a Hornet, see I get it, I want it
Everybody knows, heat hurts you got to show me first
Magician, but I can turn them to a Holy Ghost
You can bring two, three, four of them, the war's won
Tick tock boom, make ‘em all run, come on son
Big talk's just talk, I let my money bark
Put my Ferrari in park, give them a running start
Go, cause I don’t feel a single drop of pressure
No, eagle strap a foreign guap collector
He better stop all the hate, he know my ends straight
I clap your girl make the bed break, leak the sex tape
