[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy
Or I could feel the world turnin'
I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin'
Comin' up, I was taught never back down
That's why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down
32 shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left
Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie
Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em
There's a lot of talk in the streets about me
Niggas know, ain't nothing sweet about me
They keep asking me questions, like "50, who shot ya?...
You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah-Tah?"
Nigga, street shit should stay in the street
So, keep it on the low
But everybody who's somebody already know
A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up
My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up
LET'S GO!

[Hook (Different Variations)]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Maaaaaaaaan
I told niggas not to fuck with me they still push me
Figured they'd get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy
I been gone through static, shot at with automatics
Since 90, when Nas came out with "Illmatic"
If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Mattola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, son I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggas take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggas ain't gotta like me
My own homie said "50, you done lost yo' mind"
Cause I shootout in a broad day, run and toss my nine

[Hook (Different Variations)]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say "50 ain't hot"
When I drop, I'm sell like Eminem and Kid Rock
Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up
Jux me, A week later y'all be shot the fuck up
Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This ain't how moma raised me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name
I be dumb and shoot up parks
Have niggas runnin' like "Jesus Comin'"
There's wet pillows in prison, niggas cry in the dark
Cause if they did in the day, niggas would question they heart
So when they come home, the come home
Walking that tough walk, talking that "Rikers Island Bing Talk"
Talk'll get you shot in New York - BBBBLLLLATTTTT
Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
But I ain't tryin' to do hard time like Pistol Pete
See, niggas uptown understand me in the street
You niggas uptown'll "Stan" me in the street
Ha-ha
