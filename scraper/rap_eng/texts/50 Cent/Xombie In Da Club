[Intro]
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shorty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
We gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck
But, homie, ain't nothing changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey, nigga, roll the weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood in L.A. they saying "Xombie, you hot"
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow
Her girlfriend willing to get bi and they ready to go

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed
I ain't changed
I said that I ain't changed
I said that I ain't changed

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You the faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me
"Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up"
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fucking be

[Hook]
