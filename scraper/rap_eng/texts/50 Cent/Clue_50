Yo, niggas wouldn't rob Frankie if they had the chance
Wasn't cause of him it was cause of his man Lance
Frankie cut crack
Lance hold the Mac
If fiends fuck with Frankie's pac's
Lance cut the crack heads
He popped up
Thought he was locked up
Came thru stuntin' wit his wrist all rocked up
Shoulda seen him smile, missin' the tooth
Coupe missin the roof
He like "What up, 50?"
I'm like "What up with you"
Lance had a reputation that was well earned
Heard he taught niggas how them shells burn
Out there in Redfern
At the dice game, he rolled a headcrack in a crack
I'm like "Nah, I ain't paying for that! Nigga, shoot it back"
Niggas lookin at me like I'm crazy, they shook
I don't give a fuck who he shot out in Red Hook
Asked about BONE
Yeah, Bizzy was my man till he beat me for ten grand and sold my Mac for
Seven grand (Fuckin' crazy)
His man was thirsty, I could tell by his look
Cause he looked the way I look
When I look for a jooks
Bitch
