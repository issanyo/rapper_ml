[50 Cent]
Bay Area!
From the front to the back, from the left to the right side, we worldwide
From the East to the West side, get it girl, that's right, let's ride
She ain't gotta tell me she want it, she know I know that she with it
She moan and groan when I get it, she tell me lick it, I did it
She's a sexy thing
Enough to make a nigga go crazy man, do crazy things
We get to talkin' and touchin', we get to lickin' and stickin'
Now, now you know what we doing, when you're around and we missin'
We go through perfect positions, we get it poppin', now listen
Too much pleasure to measure, she got the power to beat it
Make her wanna give it to me in that major way
Jack pot, jump shot, how a nigga fade away
I mean way away, I be on that elite shit
That HBK, heartbreak kid freak shit

[Chorus]
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up

[Young Jeezy]
I'ma 'bout to call your bitch, cause she's scandalous
I'm a pro with the wood, these niggas amateurs
Make her bust a few times when I come through
You can smoke a blunt and kick it like Kung Fu
Goin' crazy on this pussy, on your nut too
You done got 3 or 4, I'm tryna nut too
She talk that shit she got a awful mouth
Nigga hit her one time at the waffle house
Right up in the IHOP
But it definitely wasn't my spot
Look at all these bitches, where the bad ones at?
You know I hate a mad ho, where the glad ones at?
I'm tryna dick some women when the club close
Look at Jizzle, got the phantom full of club hoes
Yeah, Jizzle in his baseball cap
'Bout to beat the pussy up, nigga baseball bat

[Chorus]
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up

[T.I.]
Beat that pussy up, jab, jab, right hook
Send her home to her man, let 'em watch The Notebook
Shorty wanna hang, I'm a coat hook
Split that thing down the middle of the roll up
Shown up, Gucci down to the shoe lace
Hundred carats in the chain, no fugaise
Hoes still sweat a nigga on a cool day
Them other sucker niggas fake as April Fool's Day
And a rich nigga gotta pay, that(s) what you say
I got bitches from the bay to the UK
Thick with it, pussy sweet like Kool-Aid
Run abroad, then I let her bust two straight
No suitcase on the PJ runway
Me plus two, thats a G4 three way
I give her man a hard time
He gotta soft six and I gotta hard nine

[Chorus]
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I beat the pussy up, up, up, up, up, up, up
