[Instrumental]
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
A nigga hustle around the streets to keep the paper straight
Legal or illegal, I do what it take
Shawty she the shit, you know she put it down
Make a nigga always wanna be around
I blow that paper in La Perla then rip the shit when we at it
For her I'm a fanatic, I happen to be her habit
We have the same temperament, hell yeah when we're intimate
Blindfolds, butterflies, BDSM and restraints
50 shades of 50, yeah, we freaky when ya ain't
Lights off, she get erotic with glow in the dark paint
I'm like give it to me baby, she know how I like it, boy
O-D-B, baby, I like it raw

[Verse 2: Elle Varner]
Yesterday was your birthday
So I had to put it down in the worst way
Put the cake on your plate, then I let you eat the whole damn thing
Yeah last night was one to remember, I'm sure you'd agree
Had such a good time, felt like I was celebrating me

[Hook: Elle Varner]
I know you love it, when I, spoil you, baby
So I'ma treat you like it's your birthday everyday
It's your day, your day, you can have me your way
(Treat you) like your birthday
Then the next day, then the next day, then the next day after that

[Verse 3: Elle Varner]
I like to throw surprises, got you on recovery your eyes in
You're nervous but you like it
Way I'm looking I can tell you're excited
Last night, good night to remember, I'm sure you'd agree
Forget all your presents your here in the present with me

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
And I'm lovin' it everyday, every hour, every minute, every second
You being down and around it's starting to feel like a blessing
I take you to the top, show my old hoes a lesson
You need to get to twerking, you know they want the Birkin
IG model, that ass up in the photo
Get a few followers then hoes set to go go
Me fuckin' up for these hoes, man that's a no no
I mean you know, you treat a nigga way too good

[Hook: Elle Varner]
I know you love it, when I, spoil you, baby
So I'ma treat you like it's your birthday everyday
It's your day, your day, you can have it your way
Then the next day, and the next day, and the next day after that
Then the next day, and the next day, and the next day after that

It's your birthday
It's your birthday
Treat you like it's you birthday
Then the next day, and the next day, and the next day after that
It's your day, your day, you can have it your way
Then the next day, and the next day, and the next day after that
Then the next day, and the next day, and the next day after that

[Outro: Elle Varner (50 Cent)]
(Shawty she the shit you know she put it down)
So I'ma put it on you
(You know she put it down)
Put it put it, put it on you
(Shawty she the shit you know she put it down
You know she put it down, you know she put it down
Shawty she the shit you know she put it down
You know she put it down, you know she put it down
Shawty she the shit you know she put it down
You know she put it down, you know she put it down
Shawty she the shit you know she put it down
You know she put it down, you know she put it down)
