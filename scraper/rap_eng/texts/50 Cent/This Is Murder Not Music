[Verse]
I'm on a hard bench trying to sleep in the holding pen
Man, how the fuck did I get here again?
First thing in a morning, it‘s the fuck shit
They called the case, I got confronted by a tough snitch
You told me do it, don't act like you ain't told me do it
You ain't a shooter, you a shermhead, you fucking loser
I fly the kite, my little man'll cut his sister up
He loves his bitch, you snatch her he'll start switching up
I'm cool, I just wait ‘til my next court date
I better catch amnesia then do this shit at leisure
Surrounded by Bloods, Crips, Kings, and Ñetas
Gemstars open niggas up like Berettas
I'm trying to be easy
But every now and then I gotta put it in, please believe me
You get to looking at me strange, I'm prepared, Jack
A buck fifty, keep the change, you can wear that


[Hook]
This is murder, this is not music
I had your style 10 years ago, I just didn't use it
You niggas forgot how I do it
Well, I do it like there's nothing to it

[Outro]
Yeah, all I'mma do is this, I'mma keep counting money
I don't give a fuck if it make you sick to see a nigga win
I'mma make you watch me win over and over again
You already know what it is with me, motherfucker
This year, goddamn it, you motherfuckers is making me lose count, man
Gotta start this shit over, I'm licking my fingers
I'm getting... I got 100 dollar bills, for real, nigga
All I'mma do is this man, you hear that sound in the background?
I'mma do this shit till my thumb get tired
I'mma take a break when I get past your momma house, nigga
When I count more than your momma house
I'mma take a break, go get a new stack
Hand me that money over there
What we gon' do? All year long
It's back to 50, you already know
Get the money, and shut the fuck up
Watch me do what I'm doing cause niggas can't stop nothing that I'm doing
Nothing I'm doing
Right after you get in the way we gon' start shooting again like it's nothing changed
We went through that whole "Kumbaya my lord - let's be friends by the fire"
Shit, it's over, nigga
Back to the script, you know how this shit go
How much is that?
Oooh, if you could see me right now, I got a alligator on, nigga
You, you think it should go different? See, that's where you go wrong
When you think... Who the fuck asked you to think, nigga?
Now you stick to writing comments and tweeting and your hashtags and
You know what the fuck you do, nigga, let me do what I do
