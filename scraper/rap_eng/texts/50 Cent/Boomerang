Yeah I’m back to work man
I’mma do this shit til I fall apart

[Hook]
She boomerang, I do my thang, she come back
Everytime that bitch say she leaving she come back
She boomerang-rang, she boomerang-rang
She boomerang-rang, she boomerang-rang

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
This one’s for all you niggas on lock down
Really missing the bitch with the dick in her mouth
Now she say "she leaving", I say "leave"
Shit I need air to breath
She no neccessity to me, I got game like the NBA
Pro bitch, I know shit
My nickname NFL, a Nigga Fucking Loaded
I’m rich like them white boys out there playing hockey
NHL, a Nigga Hold a Llama and I’m cocky
Should I explain myself, baby I’m on that hood shit
So say you wanna go, well I say go ‘head good bitch
I tour PGA, that's "Pussy n Good Ass"
Bitch, when your on the jet, everybody first class
Shots of Tequila, Philippine cuisine, Adobo
You know a nigga loco
My photo on the cover of the Vibe
A nigga so live, it’s GQ, XXL and Black Enterprise

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
All I wanna do is flip money and make a profit
Shorty get to working my nerves, she need to stop it
Special investigate son, she jumping through my phone
I wanna fucking be friend this is not want I want
Shit was cool til she shifted now her emotions involved
I got that dick game that put bitches in pyscho ward
She said she need me like she need air
And it hurts because I’m acting like I don’t care
I was stuck so we fuck, call it "make up sex"
Call it magic, she tried to leave, she come back
She gotta have it
She addicted to my left stroke
Nah man, my right stroke
I hit the back of that thing, she hit high notes

[Hook]

[Outro - 50 Cent]
You niggas in trouble man
I woke up this morning, feeling like the old me
I swear to God man
Everytime I say something, it’s hot
This shit just come outta me man
They say I work just what I am
I’m an artist, Dont waste your time being a critic
Because I’m critically acclaimed muthaf-cker
Around the World, I’m 1 of 1
There will never be another me
I’m a perfectionist striving for perfection
50 Cent, fuck with me, G-g-g-g-g-unit
