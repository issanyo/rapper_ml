[Intro]
Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
Cause I don’t like y'all anyway
Man, I don't like y’all anyway
Fuck all y'all
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, blow, what up, homie?
Even bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
Cause the shit I floss with is saying a lot for me

[Verse 1]
I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me they don't even stash crack
They keep it on ’em, right there in they ass crack
The way these cats move confuse me, but it’s all good
Puffy ran up on Steve, why you ain't ran up on Suge?
I’ma ask you these questions cause I don't understand
Cheeks, why you ain't show to Ty's wake, I thought he was your mans
Jigga stay away from Ja before he get on some bullshit
Talk to police on that Sammy the Bull-shit
Hey pussy Ja, why you get juxed in ya own hood?
Why niggas who rob you walk around like it’s all good?
Damn, why you ran to 'Preme to get your shit back?
Why you won't approach me? cause you know I'll push your shit back


[Hook]
Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder your life's on the line

[Bridge]
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me
I'm trying to figure out how y'all started me
You gon' make me catch you on the late night
Pop shots with the fifth and slide off in the six

[Verse 2]
Ja, when I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrappin' ya fuckin' head like a Hindu
Nas said he half-man, half-amazin'
You half-X, half-Pac, that ain't hot
Nigga, I ain't goin' nowhere so get used to me
OGs look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm the nigga that sell coke, the nigga that sell dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke and sold sope
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me
My picture's painted the words that make a blind man see (bitch)

[Hook]
Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder your life's on the line
