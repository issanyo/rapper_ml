[Intro: 50 Cent]
Ahhhhhh! G-Unit!
Baby you got, you got, you got, you got what I want
Baby you got, you got, you got, you got what I need
Now shake that thang
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it up
Girl shake that thang
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it up

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
(Baby you got) hips to hypnotize
When you walk I can't help but watch you shake
I love the way you shake
(Baby you got) lips that make a nigga fantasize
I could spend a day lost in your eyes
(Baby you got) some kind of control on me
Feels like you got a hold on me
(Baby you got) my imagination running wild
Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
It's something about your style, it's something about your smile
It's something about you making me want you right now (yeah!)
If you don't like me, don't listen to me
Lord knows, I spit that G that have you coming out your clothes
I'm a professional when I become sexual
You need a chaperone to bring your girlfriend next to you (woo!)
Don't it sound like phone sex, kinky, when I talk switch the slang
Hard to tell that nigga from New York, shorty
Come ride on my roller coaster
Porn star stamina, I try not to damage ya (haha)
Unlimited tongue action 'til you're climaxing
Foreplay, you can have it your way
I follow directions, whoa, you're jiggling baby
Back shots have your whole bed wiggling crazy
After sipping on Nightrain, that potent pipe game
I have you saying, "slow down baby"

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
(Baby you got) hips to hypnotize
When you walk I can't help but watch you shake
I love the way you shake
(Baby you got) lips that make a nigga fantasize
I could spend a day lost in your eyes
(Baby you got) some kind of control on me
Feels like you got a hold on me
(Baby you got) my imagination running wild
Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Baby, it's hard to look and don't touch
Girl the way you strut and dressed in your Von Dutch
I don't know if it's your lips or your hips that got me
Or the way that ass bounce when you move your body
I'm parked outside in the blue Denali
It's room for two, just me and you, if you 'bout it
Ice from Tiffany & Co., Norma Kamali footwear
I spend g's, I'm a G, that's a good look girl
You need a thug that can handle that
One dose'll make you go and put my name on your back
Whenever you pass through, whatever they ask you
Just tell 'em you my boo, and show 'em your tattoo, ooohh
Don't hurt nobody, baby
When you drop to the ground that drive me crazy
I done been around the world, and I finally found ya
Now back that ass up and let me get behind ya (ahhh!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
(Baby you got) hips to hypnotize
When you walk I can't help but watch you shake
I love the way you shake
(Baby you got) lips that make a nigga fantasize
I could spend a day lost in your eyes
(Baby you got) some kind of control on me
Feels like you got a hold on me
(Baby you got) my imagination running wild
Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Baby you got a hell of a first impression
Making me wanna ask you a personal question
Like "Are you flexible?" and "How do you like it?"
Give me a little input, I'm not a psychic
'Cause we can exit soon as you give the okay
You got a body like Nicole Wray, hey
I need a drink, I'll be right back
But before I go, do that little dance, yeah, just like that
It's late, I have to score, "This blue drink tastes good, don't it?"
"Sure it does, now have some more"
I'm deep, but she got her ladies with her
So bring 'em or call ya babysitter
So we can hit the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
I'm contemplating how my time's spent
'Cause I'm bent, and I'm as hard as a brick, love
You move like you work in a strip club (woo!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
(Baby you got) hips to hypnotize
When you walk I can't help but watch you shake
I love the way you shake
(Baby you got) lips that make a nigga fantasize
I could spend a day lost in your eyes
(Baby you got) some kind of control on me
Feels like you got a hold on me
(Baby you got) my imagination running wild
Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style
