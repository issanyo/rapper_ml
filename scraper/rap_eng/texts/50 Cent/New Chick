[Intro: John Hart/50 Cent]
My new chick, my new chick said her ex never rode for her
My new chick said her ex never wrote for her, I told her shawty I'ma ride
My new chick said her ex took money from her, I said bitch I'ma ride

[Verse 1: 50 Cent (@50CENT)]
She got rid of a loser, you know to fuck with a winner
Man I roll up in the Rolls, to pick that ass up for dinner
I got the deluxe apartment, I mean we up in the sky
Put my bitch on the runway, she G5 fly
I got that paper to play with, now why the fuck would she stay with
A nigga bringing the down down, he was bringing it down
I put her up on game, now she won't fuck with a lame
Even if a nigga wave I tell, I got her like

[Bridge]
New crib, new life on the map
Girl you wanna see a hater look back
I don't ever wanna see you with your next man
I'm better than your ex man, baby

[Pre Hook]
Its cold man, feeling cold outside
I keep you warm, when its cold outside

[Hook]
Baby I'm gonna ride
Girl you know I'm gonna ride
Baby I'm gonna ride
Girl you know I'm gonna ride

My new chick
My new chick, gonna call in your next bitch
My new chick
My new chick, gonna call in your next bitch

I'm gonna ride, girl you know I'm gonna ride
Baby I'm gonna ride, girl you know I'm gonna ride

[Verse 2: John Hart (@4jonnhart )]
My new chick said her ex did nothing to her, I said shawty I'ma do it
My new chick said her ex found a next bitch, I said I ain't gonna lose it
Fly high, G5 to the sky now
Girl you wanna see a hater look down
I don't ever wanna see you with the ex man
I'm better than your ex man baby

[Pre Hook]
Its cold man, feeling cold outside
I keep you warm, when its cold outside

[Hook]
Baby I'm gonna ride
Girl you know I'm gonna ride
Baby I'm gonna ride
Girl you know I'm gonna ride

My new chick
My new chick, gonna call in your next bitch
My new chick
My new chick, gonna call in your next bitch

I'm gonna ride, girl you know I'm gonna ride
Baby I'm gonna ride, girl you know I'm gonna ride

[Verse 3: RIZ SELFMADE (@RIZELFMADE)]
My new chick said her ex never wrote for her
Never cop bags, pop tags at the store for her
My new chick said her ex was a lame
Sex was the same, only shreds and complaints
Need a playa in the game, got a thang for a d boy
Tats in my frame, gold chain know its flee boy
Swagger, bout mane balenciaga
He don't even know how a real nigga got her
On to the next, too strong for your ex
Tennis your bracelet, present your rolex
Popping corks to the best, make it toast to the final things
Steer at you in the Ghost through my designer frame

[Hook]
Baby I'm gonna ride
Girl you know I'm gonna ride
Baby I'm gonna ride
Girl you know I'm gonna ride

My new chick
My new chick, gonna call in your next bitch
My new chick
My new chick, gonna call in your next bitch

I'm gonna ride, girl you know I'm gonna ride
Baby I'm gonna ride, girl you know I'm gonna ride
