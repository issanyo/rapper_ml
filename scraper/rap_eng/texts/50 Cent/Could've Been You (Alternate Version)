[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah! It's the D-R!!!! D-R-E!!! 50!!!!
D-R!!!! D-R-E!!! 50!!!!

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
Man it's funny how time fly and money change shit
How fast we grew apart and you on the same shit
I guess that what's the problem is, she see the bigger crib
And the newer Benz
Well I guess it's safer to say I'm on the right road
You only problems to me I got a light load
And I guess some things we could never fix huh
After the puzzle fall apart and the pieces get picked up
You feelin confused and your heart all mixed up
Think about the games you played the lies you told
When you askin me how I could be so cold?
And I'm wonderin, how could you be so bold?
I let go all of the old shit, on to some bigger and better
I'm full stride on these half steppers
Now just think (Just think) That should've been you
Now just think that could've been you
Now just think (Just think) That should've been you
Now just think that could've been you

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, gooooo!!
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smellin your shit
But tonight you met your match (WHOOOOOA OHHHHHH WHYYYYYY!!!)
Cause I be smellin my shit too now how you like that?!
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fuckin with ya
(Could've been you!!!) Shoppin sprees, drop top hair blowin in the wind
(Could've been you!!!) Livin lavish instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl it's so...

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Some say it hurts when you supposed to win, then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby you was confused
I had a thang for ya, I had a ring for ya
House, cars, kids and a pet, and name for ya
Pussycat told ya I make it, you ain't believe
I guess cause comin up was hard, it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on (For sure!)
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fuckin witchu (Naw!)
It's on, the club jumpin, I'm tryna get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again
I'm starin at your thicker friends (Wassup ma?)
I guess I'm like Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happyness"
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think (Just think) That could've been you
Now just think that should've been you, with me
I share the world witchu
But you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fuckin witchu

[Hook: R. Kelly]

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Said it could've been......could've been you yeah!!!!!!
Said it could've been......It could've been yooouuuuuuuu!!!!!
But you trippin, while we sippin, in the back of the club big tippin!!!!
