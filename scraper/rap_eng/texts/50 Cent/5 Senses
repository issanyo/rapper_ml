[Intro:50 cent]
I'mma be honest with you, I expect you to like me
I mean what is there not to like, I'm confident
I got a great sense of humor, I'm fun
I'm the kind of person you have fun with
(chuckles)

[Hook: Jeremih]
If it look this good
I wonder how it taste
Baby if I touch your body
Hear you scream my name
Would you whisper to me "It's yours"
Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control my senses
Baby ooohhh my senses

[Verse 1: 50 cent]
It's like everything's good
When I touch and you touch (one)
It smells like heaven
Way better than a tulip (two)
Your love let me taste it
Come here let me taste it (three)
Time is of the essence
Baby don't you waste it
I tell you what I'm thinking
You listen to my thoughts (four)
So you could see my vision
Then you'll never get lost (five)
If you follow my lead
Girl I'll be what you need
I put my trust in you now
Put your trust in me

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 2: 50 cent]
I'll be a true friend
Someone to believe in
I'll give you freedom
Unconditional meaning
If tonight is her night
It's her night
Just get back to me tomorrow, alright?
I'm not into cuffing
I'm not into fronting
I'm into getting paid
But blowing paper
I be stunting
See to me its nothing
Let's get into something
Should I pick you up or meet you at the tele girlfriend

[Jeremih]
Would you whisper to me it's yours
Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control my senses

[Hook:Jeremih]

Touch....
