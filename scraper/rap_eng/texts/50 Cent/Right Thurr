My shit is mine, yo' shit we gotta share, gotta share
Dogs off the chain my nigga, be aware, be aware
In New York City I'm the muthafuckin' mayor, I'm the mayor

[Bridge: Young Buck]
Young Buck in this bitch right, right, right, right, right herr

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I snuck in the club wit' a Glock, I got some bud in my sock
Holla fuck the cops, they just mad cause I'm hot
Thugged out, either get up or get the fuck out
Come South, let me show you niggas what Buck ’bout
I ain't scared, you coward bitches better beware
The Source Awards to the billboards, G-Unit there
Here I go, whoever want beef let me know
I ain't one of them artists that's on that P. Diddy show
I can hit you wit' the scope, or hit you wit' some coke boy
Make sure you hit me back soon as you want war

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
G-Unit in this bitch right, right, right, right, right thurr
G-Unit in this bitch right, right, right, right, right thurr
G-Unit in this bitch right, right, right, right, right thurr
G-Unit in this bitch right, right, right, right, right thurr
