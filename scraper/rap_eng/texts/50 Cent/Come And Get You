Nigga Your Time Is Up, I Ain't Come To Kid You
I Knew You niggas Was Dumb, But How Dumb Is You
Thinkin You Can See The King, When You Unofficial
You Dont wanna Go To War, Cuz I'll Launch These Missiles
I'm A Ride Or Die Nigga, I Be Tearin Shit Up
We Ain't Like Them Other Fools, Who Dont Compare To Us
All The Hoes Love A Nigga, They be Backing It Up
But Me I Love Money I Be Stacking It Up
When My Bandwagon Pull Up They Hop On Board
They Hop Right On Mine and Hop Right Off Yours
I Get Respect Homie All Across The Board
I Get A Quarter Mill A Track Without An Award
Ever Wanna Test A Nigga Then Come See Me
In The Street I Hold My Ground Like I'm Concrete
I Know Shit Ain't Sweet so When Shit Get Deep
I'm Rich I Can Pay To Have You Six Feet Deep
(Nigga)

I Give It To Whoever Want It, If You Want It Come See Me
You Know Where I'm At If You want i
If You Want It Come Get Me 50 Cent

Nigga You Violate I Regulate ra ta tat tat
Bigger Shells They Fit In That Banana Clip Tech
Run and A Bullseye, Form on Your Back
It's Hard To Miss Wit A Full Clip In The Mac

I Got Ammo Ammo I Unload, Reload, Cut A Nigga Quick
Ye My Knife Game Lethal That Tough Guy Shit
Nigga Thats What I see Through
You Like a 3 Course Meal Motherfucker I Eat You
You Food And I'm In The Mood, So Front I Let The Hammer Fly
Nigga You Can Duck, Run For Cover, Or Die
Your Choice, You Choose
I Pop, You Move, Like You In Shock You Been Shot
Nigga. Your Blood On The Street, You Up Ships Creek
You Can Hardly Speak, Startin To Get Weak Your Eyes Close
Your Life Flash, Your Heart Slow, Your Heart Stop
Your Ass Dead, You Fucked Kid

Tony Yayo

Spaghetti And Corn Bread, Mix Got Me Blunted
There's No Talk Abouts. You Dont Fuck On An Empty Stomach
