[Intro: PnB Rock]
Made it ma! Top of the world!
I'm going crazy
I'm going out of my head

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm exhausted, last night I lost it
Let the homies get loose, I'm sure I'ma get the lawsuit
Nana called, my granddaddy coughing up blood
Got an infection, the cycle of life just sucks
I bet when he die, she die, just because
They been together 60 years, that's what they call love
Paid for my first cousin wedding, over 200 grand
Then two kids and six years later, he's the wrong man
I woke up this morning, really wasn't feeling myself
Thought about suicide but me, I ain't killing myself
My cousin Dory shot his girlfriend then shot himself in the head
Before I shoot myself, I'm shooting everyone else kid
My head aching, my hands shaking, I'm sweating bullets
And it ain't even hot in this bitch, I'm going through it
My mind playing tricks on me, I mean, shit homie
I might need a straitjacket fit for me

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My favorite uncle Roc got twisted 'til that liquor gave him sugar
Had complications once or twice, that shit fucked up his liver
To me he’s still the man cause see me I still remember
That lil’ snorkel he bought me to stay warm that December
I was sleeping in the basement, the window had a draft
Even with the electric heater, I was freezing my ass
I got some money now so if I die before him, I'ma leave it to him
He can have a fine nurse put that insulin needle to him
Called my son twice, he ain't picking up the phone
And Banks, me and him don't even talk no more
You know cause of me, he ain't never have to sell crack
Never used no knife or had to squeeze no strap
But if I go tonight, I bet you I'm hellbound
For cocaine distribution and letting off MAC rounds
Home invasion robberies, we ran in that crack house
Took them niggas paper and all of they packs out

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Then I was in the second row the second time Em married Kim
Looking at Proof like, "How much you think this gon' cost them?"
Feels like a set up, Shaniqua's being nice to me
I rather a nigga just put a knife in me
Than go through the emotions, the confusion and commotions
Never die down in my head, they keep going
It feels like I'm God's punching bag on occasions
Amazing, on other days, I feel like I'm His favorite
I never bite my tongue, I just call a spade a spade
When life feeding me lemons, I just make lemonade
My nana beat cancer, it came back for a rematch
Life without my old girl, I couldn't see that
My grandpa was the strongest, then he broke down and I broke down
I looked around like if shit go bad now, who I'ma gon' go to now?
That was his partner, see he knew everything about her
Now he's saying he don't wanna live without her

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
It feels like I'm going crazy
Nothing can save me
I'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey
I can't stop staring out my window
Choppa and my pistol
I'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head
