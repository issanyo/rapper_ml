[Verse 1]
Gritty grimy shit
Slumpin in my Chevrolet
Cause I can't listen to that Techno music all day (Hell Na)
So I'm Dubsteppin'
Never leave the house without Smith & Wesson
It's gonna be a bloody mess if you fuck with me
And I put that on East Side LBC
C'mon now, catch me puffin on that devil stick
You don't wanna see me black out so don't say shit
Black ski mask with them leather OJ Simpson gloves
Choke the DJ out if he dont bang this shit up in the club

[Hook x 4]
C'mon now
Let's go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, talkin that shit will get you scraped up
Bleeding on the ground for the coroner to scoop you up
Bullets move like Mayweather, quick and fast
Better button up those lips before these hollow tips snap that ass
I've been waiting for a silly war to pop off
Now everybody walk around with them sawed-offs
The Holocaust is back
There's no speakers in my trunk
It's dead bodies in my Cadillac

[Hook]

The hood like a cemetery
Tombstones everywhere
No flowers, black gates
Like the desert brown air
