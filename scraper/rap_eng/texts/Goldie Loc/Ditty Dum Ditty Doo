[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, got the freak on it
Freak, freak on it

Last week on it, Snoop D-O-double-G
I'm on the mic, doggone it, you want it
Here we go again, bout to flow again
Take you out, cuz I'm bout to bust a ho again
Got the flow again, throw it in
Mix it, cook it, gumbo, jumbo
It just dont quit, get them chips
Mac that bitch, keep it on the under
Make 'em wonder, do it wit no blunder
Snoop D-O-double-G gets the job done
No matter what they say about me
They doubt me, they can't fuck with the
D-0-double, yes indeed thats I
The fizzi, I do it till the day I dizie!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tray Deee]
We keep this popping
Still hit droppin
Comin strong just as long
As the beat knockin
Lookin at the clock won't do no good now
Everybody party cuz we out of the hood now
Fred Red, hick, Goldie on the 2-way
Tell me whats crackin
And see what Snoop say
The coupe lay boomin in the parkin lot
And I'm pullin dime pieces off of the top
Eshine, Evine, Candy Pam
Maisha, Tisha, Sandra, Ann
So mans call for alchohol
Close the door, we dogghouse deep
And we rollin hard

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
All through the night
Better hit it all day
Every girl in the car
Gonna get it same way
You say you wanna turn me on
Well you did, lets play
You wanna share it wit a friend
Just admit it, 3-way
Ooh, 3-way, on the freeway
The G way, fuck what he say

[Hook]

[Verse 3:  Goldie Loc]
Do I like it?(Yes)
Do I mean it?(No)
Let me hook this double thing up
Real quick, "ILUVIT"
Pussy always make my day flows move
If I dont get me done
I have a fucked up attitude
Back off a jack off, we far
From playin games
We some pimps, pardon bitch
No need to explain
Now look at little mama right there
She strain, suck dick and she dont even care
Man, I'm all about breaking these hoes
Shaking these hoes, make a trick
Take off here clothes
Shoot it in her nose
Money fingling, and jingling toes
Me and peep game, "I Got Pros"
Cunt love cock, and cock love cunt
I be feeling like its sex in my blunt
Hey Casey! Where Tracy at?
She said "Daddy she in the front washin up the 'lac"
Jumped in my shit, hit the switch, start smashin
Headed to another spot to fuck some more asses
All my niggas like doin the damn thing
Happy beat it up like my nigga Pootietang
Hell yeah, I love sex
Because after I'm done I'm like "NEXT!"
With my dick on hard, church to them hoes
That be fuckin superstars!
