[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Right now a nigga just feelin real good
Thankful for everything thats goin down 4 me rite now
4 all dis happiness an' success
A nigga just str8 thankful 4 evrythang you know

[Snoop Dogg]
You think it's easy being me now hold on Dogg
Let me explain something to all of y'all
I got a mama an' a daddy 3 brothers no sisters
Some cousins uncles nephews and neices
Ain't nuthin to say da leastest hectic
With 2 boyz of my own
Spanky damn near grown
Sittin in his room just bangin my songs
As I roll anutha joint an' make a call on da fone
It's Pretty Tony it's on an' crackin my nigga
It's ya big bro I herd ya rappin my nigga
Evrybody an' there mama duin dis rap thang
I'm thankful for my
Lil' brother ain't in da hood bangin

[Hook]
Just be thankful 4 all ya got
If it's just a little bit it's all ya got
U mite not hav a car or big gold chain
Stay tru 2 yaself an' thangs will change
Just be thankful 4 all ya got
If it's just a little bit it's all ya got
U mite not hav a car or big gold chain
Stay tru 2 yaself an' thangs will change

[Goldie Loc]
Man my sister been gone for about 10 months
Steady smokin blunts an' fuckin wit da same cunt
But it's time Two make a change
So I rock up my rhymes like crack Kokane
I'm in da game Much love 2 my nigga Snoop
It wouldn't be crackin with out you
I wouldn't be standin in them black walla C's
I'd be back in da hood with them G's

[Warren G]
From kidnaps an' jacks
Knockouts an' craps
Frum totin Tech-9's
2 shankin on da main line
Timez iz hard we all caught up in da struggle
Whites, Blacks, Mexicans it's trouble
Young kids we got a man made disease
I lost my mom so now I'm prayin on my knees
Did y'all take care of y'all ha luv wuz precious
Now I got my daddy, sistas an' homies god bless us

[Hook]

[Pretty Tony]
We been through some tuff timez mom late on rent
Tryin 2 get mine husslin like Larry Flynt
No food in da fridge but we wuzn't alarmed
Cuz my brutha wuz like a good neighba den like state farm
Peeples always sayin wut they need an' want
But they need 2 start wit they du's an' don'ts
Just be thankful 4 day 2 day
An' evrythang will be goin ya way

[Kam]
Now ain't it odd 2 thank god We movin in gangsta toyed
We live an' die by tha sword An' still we thank tha lord
Frum da maternity ward 2 tha morgue I count my blessins
It's a game I shood but can't afford but I ain't stressin
I'm E-S-in 4 mines it's all gunna pay off in da long run
An' no rest on da grind man a nigga just out here on one
Stayin strong all alone or hangin wit my clique
I rite a song rite or rong I'm realy bangin dis shit
I used ta wonda y we had it so ruff
My motto wuz my ancha an' 4 dat I can't thank ya enough

[Hook]
