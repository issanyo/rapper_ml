L.T., Uh, The nerve of this bitch

[Tray Dee]
A bitch made purpose is to service a mac
In a skirt till her feet hurt workin the track
No breaks, ho break mine or she don't sleep
Pussy just a piece of meat another means to eat
Bitches playin like the wayin so I stay in the game
Pimpin hard on these niggas cuz they playin is lame
How I'm came at a ho is all a bitch gone know
What I won't, what I don't and where to put my dough
Back-talk get you slapped broad stay in yo place
I might get the hanger then make you lay on yo face
Trick guerilla for my scrilla ho you got to know
Chronic weed smoke the only thing I cop to blow
Gangsta-playa paper-chasin break a bitch like young
No tongue get em sprung from the game I run
One in a million with this pimpin Suga Free no cut
Now come up from promote and tell these hoes what's up

[Suga Free]

And it she say baby let's go get this paper
Don't playa-hater hater she tryin be all the ho that you can be
Oh no I ain't gone playa hate you cuzz you dressed like you a freak

With that pimp stick hangin french-braided right by my feet
Now on a accident pussy sells
You see how heavy traffic gets pussy sells
Nigga you lookin foe yo ho main pussy sells
But you gone get plenty mo cuz pimpin neva fells
Ooohh venom, cross my heart hope to die stick a needle in my eye
If you didn't have Suga Free you'd have to invent him
(Got, Someby, Like a Mua Fucka)

[Snoop Dogg]
Me and my niggas is hard as hell
Pimp slap a bitch for some clientele
Bitch get me a room at a plush hotel
To hit this trick for this lick and go get my mail
If you ever get caught, cracked and thrown in jail
You know a nigga comin throw with that bail
I put you on a track like that for real
And you know and I know that pussy will sell

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Oohh She got the bomb, My bitch got some bomb ass pussy
Oohh She got the bomb, You want the honey nigga I want the money

[Snoop Dogg]
Where ever I go it's all the same
Do the pussy have a name yeah but it might change (da, da)
Dependin on the weather or the mood that that day
If the cat got macked then that fool gone pay
Now lay lay yo head on back
You down with the dogg then work that trap
And don't come back till you get that scratch, and bring it all to me
