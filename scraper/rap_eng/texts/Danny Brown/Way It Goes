[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes, know you see a thug
Cause I dropped out of school to smoke weed and sell drugs
When you listen to me speak, uneducated
Cause I talk with Ebonics and I never graduated
So I'm a lost cause, gun in my drawers
Live another day, seem I got to break the law
Say this another way to put food on my plate
My daughter still hungry at the minimum wage
So you take away my days, put me in a cell
Pray every night, think I should burn in hell?
Lie to me as a kid, say I had a future
But I learned the truth when my mama rent was due
Said you was being honest, gave me a false promise
So I depend on nothing but this bottle and some chronic
Told me that if I change, I might just see dollars
But instead I got change and all it was, was copper

[Hook x2]
When does it end, God, I don't really know
Might be the state pen' or getting buried in a hole
But that's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go

[Verse 2]
Even died in a dream
No niggas doing life, some ain't make 18
Young whores in the hood take lies before they start
Robbed of self-esteem, now, they ain't got a heart
Staring in the mirror, hearing voices in my head
Saying: "Take advantage cause you're 'posed to been dead"
Staying on a mission for the nickels and the dimes
Blowing on chronic while I'm peeking out the blinds
Sign of the time, ain't no respect
Can't leave the house if I ain't got the Tec
At night, I can't sleep, like a Vietnam vet
Can't trust my own blood, everybody is a threat
Paranoid, keep the heater off safety
Roll my own weed, nobody can't lace me
World crazy, lost my mind
But I'd rather be here than locked doing time

[Hook x2]
