[Chorus 1: alt-J]
Swim low in the back dry in the night
Sample, put it there, get the money
In the back of a Volvo car
Sample, old over, pay up, sign up LA

[Verse 1: alt-J]
Man Ray went cray cray over you
Capturing but never captured
You're my DC, oh Lee, oh

[Chorus 2: alt-J]
Swim low in the back dry in the night
Sample, put it there, get the money
Keepa, keepa, keepa, keep me damn down
Let it low, let me know where you go
Papa, papa, papa, get me down
Deep, deep down, Pablo, let me know

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
One man's waste is another man's soap
Nice way of saying you're washed up
And I'm getting fed up like Oprah and her jet
Same mental state as a Vietnam vet
It's a war outside, ain't no one safe
Wave my Rollie like I'm Puffy and Mase
Still trying to escape, getting caught up in the web
Snakes in the grass and they snapping at your legs
You can burn down the village if you overcook the bread
A little game, maybe something you can borrow

[Chorus 1: alt-J]
Sample, put it there, get the money
In the back of a Volvo car
Sample, hold over, pay up, sign up LA

[Verse 3: alt-J]
If you don't have the ace of hearts
My dear, you're a lost man
Falcon for you, Anna, from the left arm of the falconer
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna L'Arl√©sienne

[Verse 4: Danny Brown]
A little game, maybe something you can borrow
You get it then you get it, I just lead the horse to water
But I can't make them drink it, this weed got me thinking
How we in low tide but the ship still sinking
Don't wanna be alone when your skin start wrinkling
Uh, you gotta plan for the future
Live a little different than the average nigga used to
Everyday for me, first a month for a dope fiend
Difference is I ain't runnin' 'round stealing flat screens
(Flat screens, flat screens, flat screens, flat screens)

[Chorus 1: alt-J & Danny Brown]
Swim low in the back dry in the night
Sample, put it there, get the money
In the back of a Volvo car
Sample, hold over, pay up, sign up LA
Swim low in the back dry in the night
Sample, put it there, get the money
(One man's waste is another man's soap)
In the back of a Volvo car
Sample, hold over, pay up, sign up LA
(One man's waste is another man's soap
One man's waste is another man's soap)
