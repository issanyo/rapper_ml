[Verse 1]
Hotter than an Arab on a flight with a brick
Live wire fire like dynamite wick
Boy 'bout to blow like topside Peru
Y'all in shit creek with a tissue canoe
Rhyme fire haywire, renegade with power
'posed to be in hell in a gasoline shower
Sandpaper knuckle, heart pump, nitro
Conscience of a killer, thoughts of a psycho
Brown only hold heat when he 'bout to use it
Mary-Jane step dance so I just abuse it
Nigga, you foolish, think it's just music
CDs to eight balls, push it like a poo-stick
Leave you acoustic
Nigga that's hallow
Brown like hood rats, you can have the models
All she really need is the blunt and the bottle
On the first night I'm a hit it like lotto
