[Intro: ZelooperZ]
I'm 'bout to shit on all y'all niggas, bitch!

[Verse 1: ZelooperZ]
You cuffin' that ho, please-ah release her
Three hun' for feature, me, I don't need her
But it's cheaper to keep her, on my side like beeper
Redhead like Reba, Basquiat like Reebok
She calls me when she needs cock
When she see the cock, she wake up
Fucked up her makeup while you callin' her to make up
It's Maybelline! Hit that bitch with the shoulder lean
Hit that bitch with the catering
I'll bring that bitch my ding-a-ling
Put that bitch on the EBT, scratch that, no DVD
You end up like Eazy-E, my bad, that's not a joke
Smokin' on dope, bonfire, gettin' higher, Bon Iver
Smacked yo' bitch with my PalmPilot
Now you lookin' lost like a fuckin' lighter, bitch!

[Hook: ZelooperZ]
Y'all done made me unleash the beast
I got niggas on the west, I got niggas on the east
Know I'm on my rise, like some fuckin' yeast
The look in her eyes, she wanna come with me
ThunderCat (ho!), ThunderCat (ho-oh-oh!)
ThunderCat (ho!), ThunderCat (ho-oh-oh!)
ThunderCat, bitch! (ho!), ThunderCat, bitch! (ho-oh-oh!)
ThunderCat, bitch! (ho!), that's my ThunderCat bitch! (ho-oh-oh!)

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Boot it up with them moon rocks, sippin' on that 2Pac
Thug passion if you askin', got NASA up in my tube sock
Make you come out your tube top, money up in my shoebox
Bet you change after two shots, box rain like it rain on a homeless block
I’m comin' down, I’m comin' down, popped another, now I’m runnin' round
Danny Brown and ZelooperZ, tell me what’s fuckin with that now
Not a damn thing, not a damn thing, smoke so much, I can’t see
Bitch pulled a hamstring tryna pull all on my ding-a-ling
Yeah, girl down on the floor, on the floor, shake it slow
Girl, you know can’t take no more, got a nigga like me looking red' to go
Damn, girl on the floor, on the floor, shake it slow
Got her like me, can’t take no more - got her like me, just waiting to go
Sippin' margaritas with some divas, ballin' out in two seaters
Smoke so much damn reefer, I can't feel my face seats
Get you out of your two piece, on the run like good grief
Popped a pill, she popped a pill now I'm rubbing all on her buttcheek
