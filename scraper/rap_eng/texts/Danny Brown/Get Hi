[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
I’m blowing on some Miles
Something Kinda Blue
The kinda dope
You swear could make
Dreams come true
Sticky icky nugs
Real furry buzz
This my party pack
Call it the cotton club
Towel under the door
Hotboxing hotels
Security knocking
What’s that smell
Ornette with a fortress
Scorching frontos on porches
Torching up the purple
Got me spinning in a circle
I'm Coltrane on Soul Plane
Propane flow game
Bitches know my name from
Cancun to Spokane
Got it in my carry on
Smoke it till its all gone
No homo but yo bitch go
Tommy Dorsey on my trombone
Hit the greenery jaws go Gillespie
Have a nigga shaking like he got epilepsy
I hit it twice then i pass it to the right
Mary Jane ya be the love of my life

[Hook: B-Real]
Say ya had a bad day
Want the stress to go away
Just rollup
Take the pain away
And get hi
Stop talking all that jazz
Every morning I wake up
First thing I roll up
Before I get the day started
First I gotta bake up
And get hi

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Ya girl just left you
You just got fired
Ya car acting up
You need new tires
Your bills all late
Anyday ya phone off
Fuck it cop a 8th
Take the load off
Baby Momma tripping
Taking you to the court
They wanna lock you up
But your daughter got new Jordans
Yo landlord knocking
Her girl cock blocking
Dealing with this bullshit
Smoke up on the constant
Living in this world
Always on the edge
So to clear yo mind
Smoke one to the head
Pockets on e
Due on ya lease
Tryna chop you down
So roll up the trees

[Bridge: Danny Brown]
Problem of today
Smoke it to the face
It’s only for a moment
But the troubles go away
Problems of today
Smoke it to the face
It’s only for a moment
But the problems go away

[Hook: B-Real]
Say ya had a bad day
Want the stress to go away
Just roll up
And take the pain away
And get hi
Every morning I wake up
First thing I roll up
Before I get the day started
First I gotta bake up
And get hi
