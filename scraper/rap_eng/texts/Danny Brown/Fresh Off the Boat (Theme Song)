[Verse]
Fresh off the boat
You can tell the way I wear my clothes
That I'm fresher than a scent from a rock
Fresh off the boat
You can tell the way I wear my gold
That I shine anywhere around the globe
Fresh off the boat
Getting mine everywhere I go
So if you don't know homie now you know
Fresh off the boat
And homie I demand my respect
Everywhere I go I rep my set
I'm fresh off the boat

[Outro]
Homie, you don't know where I come from
But I know where I'ma go
Fresh off the boat
Homie, you don't know where I come from
But I know where I'ma go
Fresh off the boat
