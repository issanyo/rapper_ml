[Verse 1: Danny!]
I'm a narcissist with moxie
A Marxist by proxy
My life is a motherfuckin' farce, just watch me
My wife is a motherfuckin' heartless Nazi
We get along though, she's a ping-pong pro
Money out the wazoo she got King Kong dough (so?)
That's the reason why I stick with her (oh)
Grab the keys and drive to Pittsbizzurgh (fa sho!)
Stack the cheese and buy a pit litter
A sick spitter yo, I saw the big picture though
Flew up to Chi-town and caught a Kid Sister show
Toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
But the ho's fucked up, sound like Tinkerbell rappin'
Heard she was ready for some single male action
So I made myself drink a pail of Captain Morgan
One drum of rum'll have me rappin' foreign
Like "humdumalemalemezacdezachdejournen"
Me and Danny Brown rockin' matchin' hand-me-down
Letterman sweaters, damn we some panty hounds
Scoopin' chicks from the greasy spoon
Been a freak ever since I stuck my feet out Niecey's womb

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
The kush got purple hair like a hoodrat
While you still beg to smoke, askin' where the goods at

[Danny!]
Look at all of these rappers that's unemployed
Your boy is a coked-out version of Pastor Troy

[Danny Brown]
This the real McCoy, you rappers is decoys
At the end of all the games you a bitch like Metroid
Call 'em Samus

[Danny!]
But don't forget the hammers

[Danny Brown]
We smut the prom queen and jumped the big man on campus

[Danny!]
And us against them, damn bruh it can't be tamed
Call the goons, have your granny drowned in candy rain

[Danny Brown]
Danny Brown and Danny Swain, don't confuse the name
Got fire in our brain like Ichabod Crane

[Danny!]
Like Ichabod Crane?

[Danny Brown]
I think they insane!

[Danny!]
Shining like the sun

[Danny Brown]
But ain't no diamonds in my chain
Nigga you dead wrong

[Danny!]
Nigga we headstrong

[Danny Brown]
Nice as Eminem rhyme "acorn" with "Foghorn Leghorn"

Danny!]
Dreams of sexing Ellen Cleghorne
Knocking up the broke bitches they all having my kids

[Danny Brown]
I'll show you what it is and what it all could be
Couldn't write it in your afterlife

[Danny!]
Damn bruh, is that your wife?
