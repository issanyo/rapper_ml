[Intro: Dopehead]
My jooky so stupid
My style so jooky
I'm Mr. Smoke a Blunt Up and Beat up that Coochie
And beat up that pussy
You ain't slick you stupid
Yo bitch say my dick jooky
You blowing up her celly while she blow me like a loosie

[Hook 1: Dopehead] X2
All I do is win
All you niggas losin'
All I do is win
That's why yo ho choosin

[Verse 1: Dopehead]
Dopehead
My flow disgustin'
Drinking 40s like Pac in Poetic Justice
King Jooky
Mutant shit
Smoking loud getting head from a mutant bitch
Chill rapper
You ain't real rapper
I got my Bruiser
And we kill rappers
Keep your mouth closed
Keep it on
The safe side
Take lives
Softer than them six
Students from Bayside

[Hook 2: Dopehead]
All I do is win
All you niggas loosie
All I do is win
All you niggas loosin'
All I do is win
All you niggas loosin'
All I do is win
All you niggas loosin'

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Bruiser up in this bitch
Nigga off that shit
Some shit on my chest and I'mma tell it how it is
I be the sicko of sixteens
Nightmare of wet dreams
Extreme like listenin Cream on mescaline
Promethazine with codeine
Got my mind be floating
Like my brain in the ocean
Nigga comatosin
Got me writing potent
Got me smoking potent
So many fake rappers if you real, nigga, I ain't notice
I prolly smoked a couple with you
But you other niggas broke
Stay up on my block with you bull shit dope
My niggas too much soap
And this beat at 1 hunnid
I keep it, nigga, 1 hunnid
My nigga, at 1 hunnid
That "pop" sound a cock
You gun versus nunchucks
So I would never beef with me
My speech heat seeking missles
So nigga watch yo spot
So nigga watch yo spot
I'm comin' for that pussy like a fiend owe me for rocks

[Hook 2: Danny Brown]
All I do is win
All you niggas loosie
All I do is win
All you niggas loosin'
All I do is win
All you niggas loosin'
All I do is win
All you niggas loosin'
