Danny Brown

All the talk in the streets
Don't bother me none
I lay in bed don't miss a second of sleep
Blow a blunt pass out don't count no sheep
Wake up blow another one and still don't eat
Ice melting in the grand cru
Too high for rude comments
I look down on you
I'm humble and too nice
But I don't talk to no Nigga that can't look me in my eyes
Smoke a newport and take a shit
And text your bitch
She know she really want it
I'm just trying to crash the boards like udonis
Blow some chronic now she all up on it
Used to catch the bus to Great Lakes
Too many hoes on me man dog I know they fake
Cause where were your hoes at
When I was tapping hoes and they couldn't even look back
I rather just kickback
And fuck with wifey
Rock heels she don't fuck with nikes
She say papi put it all inside me
And I don't do shit lay back and let her ride me

(Hook)
Look how it all can change
Things change start getting some change
Same friends used to ask for change
A straight change cause they say you changed
And now look how it all can change
It feels strange when they say you changed
But think about it man you changed your life
Changed your car
Changed your crib
Changed your wife

How the fuck can I act funny
Far as I know I ain't never been bummy
And these bitches can't change me
Baby momma shot a mood
So I treat 'em al the same
I don't share things got my own lane
Niggas in he hood call me by my government name
Respected in the D used to hustle on 12th street
And I'm from Linwood
So you know I'm so hood
Should have been God merc
But I'm fighting in the D like Emanuel Steward
Niggas see you and won't say two words
But when your ass die they want to say a few words
And my real niggas I'll take a case for
Cock back drop back I'll take a face full
Niggas fake ain't no pride no more
Wonder why these real niggas won't ride no more

(Hook)
Look how it all can change
Things change start getting some change
Same friends used to ask for change
A straight change cause they say you changed
Look how it all can change
It feels strange when they say you changed
But think about it man you changed in life
Changed your car
Changed your crib
Changed your wife
