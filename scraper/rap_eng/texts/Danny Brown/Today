[Verse 1]
Watch who you ‘round
Gotta watch they mouth
When them guns come out
And them shots ring out
You know what they about
Watch what they say
Watch what they do
When a hook come around
Them kids come down
They a tell on you
It’s snakes in the grass
Getting trapped by rodents
Potent we smoking
A leave you choking
Hoping you focused
So dog take notice
For a flash of light
Run you off light roaches
Hopping off porches
With chrome 44
Nose long as song
Made by Mike Bolton
Lightning bolts
Rip through your torso
Raining blood
After that thunder
Mommas crying
Children wonder
But this is the life
That we all succumbed to
Make a nigga wanna go
And cut his phone off
Cops killing niggas everyday
Like protocol
Watch the TV
Turn on the news
Make a nigga feel like
He listened to blues
In the hood
Wit that Arm & Hammer
Getting them Pampers
For baby mama
Hood flick us
We in the slammer
Now ya baby raised
By another man bruh
Cure for cancer
Cure for A.I.D.S
Make a nigga
Wanna stay on tour for days
Everywhere you go
Gotta keep that tool
Cause you don’t want end up
Happening to you
So everywhere u go
Gotta keep that tool
Cause you don’t want it end up
Happening to you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gotta watch these niggas
Better watch these niggas
Cause for a little bit of crumbs
When you trapped in the slums
They a pop you nigga
Watch where you go
Watch where you at
Cause goons on attack
And that’s a fact
You don't want it like that
Niggas get bodied like everyday
Nigga masked up like masquerade
Bruiser Brigade
Nigga take this fade
Or get marked out
Like crossword game
For a little name
Nigga pop yo chain
Playing no games
Evict arcade
Trade in your life
For a pair of new J's
A-OK with them AK’s
Broad daylight
Make you do a relay
Duck behind cars
When you hear the tool spray
You don’t want beef
Get simmer soufflé
Sitting in the Bimmer
With ya lightskin bae
Fuck all the tough shit
I’m tryna get paid
You ain't bout money
Nigga you the same way
End of the day
Nigga jail the new slave
Trust my nigga
You don’t wanna go that way
