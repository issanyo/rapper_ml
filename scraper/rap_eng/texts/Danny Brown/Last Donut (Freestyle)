[Danny Brown]
When it rains, it pours so grab your umbrella
Wet paint Chevy in the sun shine yella
So uncouth, blowing smoke out the moonroof
Can tell I'm getting money, can't tell that about you
... talking on the Blackberry
Ask you for the money by all means necessary
Flow spectacular, flip like a spatula
Stay with the girl, even though, I'm a bachelor
Laugh during pain, cry during joy
Some shoot veins, others sniff boy
Plans unfold, niggas fold under pressure
Niggas act hard get buried like treasure
Think like a psychology professor
16 bars like a Huey Newton lecture
Riding down Dexter, just passed Esquire
Cherry air freshener, on the raw tire
Danny, no dummy, but he uneducated
Ain't got a mil-, but got more than who graduated
