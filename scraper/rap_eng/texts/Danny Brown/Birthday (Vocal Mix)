[Chorus: Spank Rock]
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
(Birthday)

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Celebration, bitches
In the club, like fuck yo couch
Dancing up on tables, spitting champagne out my mouth
This that Boys Noize, that Danny Brown
Y’all don’t know, better ask around
Passing around our bottles like we ain’t ever gonna run out
Tell me what you gonna do now
Treat this world my playground
Every day my birthday, get me a taste of that cake now
Myself I can’t handle
Torn up, I'm so dismantled
‘Cause every day my birthday, so blow me like a candle

[Chorus: Spank Rock]
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
(Birthday)

[Verse 2: Pell]
Three sixty five it feel like May 29th
Every day my fucking birthday, blowing candles, getting high
Celebrating that we got it, through the [?] stay fly
You know I, I, I… Sip
[?] impressive, my refreshment
Am I new or leaning?
Throw them leaves in my lean so we blowing peaceful
And I’m dancing on cake like strippers
Cheese so hard these look like dentures
‘Cause we tax for more cash than an Ivy League tuition

[Bridge: Pell]
On my birthday, yeah
On my birthday
(On my birthday, yeah)
Let’s have a toast baby
Let’s have a toast baby
On my birthday

[Chorus: Spank Rock (Pell)]
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
(On my birthday)
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I, every day I, every day
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
Every day I wake up, it feel like my fucking birthday
