[Chorus]
I'm ballin' now (stop!), yeah, just like Kobe
You're callin' now (stop!), yeah, bitch you know me
You're fallin' off (stop!), and I'm takin' all your hoes, bitch
I'm showin' off (stop!), what the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)

[Verse 1]
I ain't never had shit, zilch, zero, nothin'
Now that a nigga got something, yeah, bitch, I'm stuntin'
Look at all these moneys, hundreds and these fifties
Eatin' at the Whitney, now your bitch wanna come with me
'Cause we 'bout to go to the mall, tonight we poppin' bottles
My baby momma a hoodrat, but now I got me a model
And she wanna swallow, drink it all up
Straight to the neck from the bottle, bitch, you don't need no cup
And she 'bout to go make it rain, thunder, fuckin' storm
Kush nuggets to the brain, pop fuckin' corn
Shapow, bitch, wow, been had hundreds
Nah, nigga, I'm lyin', you know that I be frontin'

[Refrain]
Got that income tax swag, that income tax swag
That bad dame in my lap, just copped her a bag
Got that income tax swag, that income tax swag
That bad dame in my lap, just copped her a bag

[Chorus]
I'm ballin' now (stop!), yeah, just like Kobe
You're callin' now (stop!), yeah, bitch you know me
You're fallin' off (stop!), and I'm takin' all your hoes, bitch
I'm showin' off (stop!), what the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'? (stop, stop!)

[Verse 2]
I'ma blow it out now, motherfuck a later
'Bout to cop me a mink, diamond encrusted gators
Car with a TV in it, maid and a butler too
So what, nigga, this shit rented? Right now it's gon' have to do
And I'm gonna take it all with me—when I'm gone, bitch, it's gone too
Who cares when the kids get grown? Better figure out what they gon' do
'Cause right now, nigga, I got it—nigga, what about you?
Broke-ass niggas worth nothing, I can buy y'all in twos
'Cause a long time ago, nigga, nigga, was just like you
'Cause we ain't about the past, it's about right now my dude
'Cause normally I be broke, but right now I got cash
Nah, nigga, I'm lyin', you know that I be frontin'

[Refrain]
Got that income tax swag, that income tax swag
That bad dame in my lap, just copped her a bag
Got that income tax swag, that income tax swag
That bad dame in my lap, just copped her a bag
