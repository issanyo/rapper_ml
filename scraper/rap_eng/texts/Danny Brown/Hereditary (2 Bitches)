[Hook: Kembe X]
My daddy taught me how to have two bitches
One for the love and another just for the fun
He said, don't be like me, do different
Reach for the star, shit, fuck it, I'm the--
Daddy taught me how to have two bitch
One for the love and another  just for the fun
If a third come around then it's finna be one
See 'em- come around, I'mma get me one

[Verse 1: Kembe X]
Murk with the kid, I fuck around RIP one
Syrup got me bent, man drill got event
Turn out 69 hard, so I had to invent one
Girl just do that and I owe you 2 racks
When I roll through, roll up another one
Owe to everythin' organic, blowin' whole foods
Oh you be sellin' crack and killin' niggas? Soo cool
You a savage with the squad, wonder what that soul do
Now I'm in Miami with some bitches, I ain't ever seen a badder one
Found a blue [?]can't even add 'em up
Found a ten, I'll probably be in Canada
What a lick, Cali population more than they whole shit
Mad, made a nigga drop out
Now them same equations got me free enough to pop out
Illinois audible enough I'm callin' hot routes
My basement is Louis, wonder what them thoughts 'bout

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Welcome to my murder show, horrible
Hey what we do? all of you
Trying the undeniable sire of diabolical
Swallow me an Adderall, now I feel so powerful
Slaughter authors even when the words are inaudible
Speakin' names of a creature, I'm a beast, mythological
Everything I speak is so goddamn chronicle
Follow you from studio, 480hits for a domino
Now they got 0, green in here, follicles
Split you like molecules, put you in solitude
Now you smell funny like [?] from Bollywood
Backwood rollin' while I'm poundin' this bitch
Never hit your bitch, cuz the head way good
If it wasn't for this rap shit, I wouldn't be shit
So I kill me a nigga ever chance I get
If it wasn't for this rap shit, I wouldn't be shit
So I kill me a nigga ever chance I get
