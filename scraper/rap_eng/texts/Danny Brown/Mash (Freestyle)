Rest in peace J. Dilla

[Verse 1]
2 AM in the city of the motor
Blowing on some purple I copped form Saratoga
Block hot spot field like Minnesota
Space heater on, ain't getting no warmer
Crack head Yolanda
Knocking at the door
Wanna cop a nick but she only got four
Gave it back to her, said go to the store
Grab me some loosies, red Faygo
Twenty six grams on the broke piece of mirror
What I do with it? Attract the gold diggers
Got me the Cutty with the European clip
Sueded inside the color of cheese grits
26 inches make the hook get nervous
Brown so fly my phone ain't got service
And y'all niggas lame
I'm stunting, more white than X-Games
More green than Celtic games
And I fly the purple in like soul plane
Got the old school in my baby mama name
Off temporary service
Boost mobile chirp but it's never in service
Motherfucker [?]
Work coming back in the glass pot, Pyrex
Break a thing down one safety pin
Fresh out the county, I ain't ever seen a pit
Locked up in bull pens, I'm a stay eating
Commissary look like I went trick-or-treating
