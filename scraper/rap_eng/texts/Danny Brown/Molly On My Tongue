I got molly on my tongue

[Verse 1: Corey Davis]
It's a full moon so I know she fin to fuck tonight
That bitch is a super freak
She'll give you what you like
Suck my balls and fuck my dogs
Never beat that pussy raw
That's the law
If she fall, toss it like a tomahawk
This bitch is too real
She's crushing up her pills
I'm rolling paper planes and she's rolling dollar bills
I'm trippin' on some molly in the marijuana field
How the fuck she buying drugs
When she couldn't pay her bills?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A.WARE]
Tammy Lee from Tennessee
Baddest bitch up on the scene
Nails done, toes matching
Pussy smell like potpourri
We're supposed to be somewhere sippin' daiquiris
But actually, we was on the run like Mickey Mallory
Eatin' all day, nigga
Never countin' calories
Get on your job fo' we fuckin' up your salary
Molly poppin', party hoppin'
Bang your chick, her body rockin'
Finger lickin', olly oxen free
Oxy cotton fiend

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Check!
She put that molly on her tongue
Molly on her tongue
She wash it down with my cum
Ride that dick until she numb
I know that ho she want my love
But that dick got her sprung
She (?)
Now she can't breathe when I'm around
I tell that ho, what I do
Let my niggas run bus stops
Dippin' all of my bags, so
I know you wanna fuck, ho
Before you dip that molly
Ho, you ain't one to fuck with
Lickin' all in that clit
Now your ass in love with
Water bottles, we pour out
Without blanker, we toe up
(?)
Make it nasty when it's time to fuck
Doin' shit she ain't did before
Ankles touchin' your shoulders
Said it ain't felt like this before
Guess what bitch? I told you
Ho, I stay turnt up
Ain't goin' sleep no time soon
Moon after moon, dippin' molly in her bathroom
Molly on my tongue, molly on my tongue
I gave your girlfriend some
And now I feel her tongue
