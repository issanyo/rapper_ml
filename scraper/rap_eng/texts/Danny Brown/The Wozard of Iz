[Repeating Hook]
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender (ahh)
Every moment we're together makes me hope it lasts forever (Yeah!)
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender (Slap!)
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender (ahh)
Every moment we're together makes me hope it lasts forever
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender (ahh)
Every moment we're together makes me hope it lasts forever
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender
There is magic in the splendor and desire to surrender

[Verse 1: Sample]
(The Wozard of Iz)
Aaaaaaaaaaah! (Here we go!)
I have been over the rainbow
And I found nothing there
But very thin air
(The Wozard of Iz)
(The Wozard, the Wozard of Iz)

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
My 16's and tail twelves
Dick like water, reals in hell
I sold dope, didn't stack up
And I buy a berth from jail twelve
Canâ€™t even make my jail bail
Locked up in that jail cell
Writing hoes, dirty letters
Jerking off to my mail well
Man I fuck with white hoes
That be smoking Pall Mall
That be pale with thick tails
Smoke Adderall snort snail trail
I used to rot in stones
Let my nigga fishtail
Now I'm on that mix scale
Not fuckin' with no fish scale (Summertime)
About to get my niggas off the hood
Ballin' hard like you knew we would
Your bitch in my phone and she wish she could
Because she wish she could
Ball so hard like he couldn't fuck for months
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
Pill after pill after pill after pill
Extra pills, extra pills!

[Outro]
Summertime
Aaaaaaah!
One two three
You and me
You and me!
Aaaaaaah!
One two three
(The Wozard of Iz)
Aaaaaaaaaaah! (Here we go!)
