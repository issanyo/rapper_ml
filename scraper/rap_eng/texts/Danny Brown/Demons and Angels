[Verse 1]
I'm so ahead of my time
My pops ain't even bust his first nut yet
I'm a-whole-nother subject
Extra-curriculum
Passion just to get more credit used synthetic
After this call the medic
Got a fetish for anything the color of lettuce
But they cut the horses' wings, yeah, a Pegasus
While you on some new car, new necklace
I transcend nice, y'all niggas alright okay, get ya bars up
Hit Starbucks, grab a bag of whole bean
Whole food deli sandwiches
Blowing OG and I wrote this shit, and it goes like this
A penny for your thoughts, but I plan to make millions
Or die crying in the end like the villain, or sipping Teqo in outdoor pavilions
They keep telling me I'm brilliant
And I concur, cause my metaphors are better than yours
I broke obituary like brochure
And I'm tryna have mine like novel, rap Dan Brown fight Angels and Demons
That's why I'm sipping on this bottle
I take your ho to Aeropostale and she show me her body parts like Hostel

[Interlude]
Uh, nigga, I'm the nicest man, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
It ain't tricking if you got it
Yeah, right it ain't tricking if it's Jeep
If I can afford this you will absorb my semen
Dinners making copy cat peas from mean mints
Fiends leaning throwing up, Willie Beaman
On the grind like strippers on zippers
To y'all young whippersnappers, nigga, I'm a blizzard
Nigga that's cold, I would do you so bold
If you ever disrespect this dialect, uh
What the fuck you popping Darvocet, nigga, I'm the architect
And my notepad's the blueprint, watch how I fuel shit
Getting away, watch these whore hats kill shit

[Outro]
Nigga, nigga, it's Detroit stand up, shit
