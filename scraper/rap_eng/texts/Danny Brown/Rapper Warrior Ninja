[Intro: Eric Andre, Commentator & Danny Brown]
There's no teams, no uniforms, just a bunch of rappers.
It's time for Rapper Warrior Ninja!
Attempting to rap while blindfolded, each contestant will have to make it through the soiled underwear... (oh, shit)
Mouse trap plank, ball swing alley and the snake pit (oh, shit!) in order to take home the win

[Verse 1: Danny Brown, Hannibal Buress & Eric Andre]
This beat is trash, oh my God I'm 'bout to bust my ass
Oh, you bitch-ass nigga, you done touched on me, you got me fucked up
Oh, shit—

Fuck the freestyle, nigga, ehe—oh!
Nah, get me off! Fuck, give me something to defend myself with, bruh
Fuck you motherfuckers, bruh
Hey, what's good, bruh? What's good, eh—

[Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle]
Yeah, this thing is stupid
Something, I shouldn't have agreed to it
I'm on the plank, I can't move fast I'm on ch—ouch!

[Verse 4: Nocando]
There's some dirty drawers, she made it clap
Got a round of applause, they didn't, that's a—oh, god-damn it!
Really can't handle their convo—ahh! Oh! Oh, shit, oh!
What the fuck!? Stay away from me!

[Verse 5: Go Dreamer]

And I don't know where I'm goin' but I feel like I'm trappin' on y'all nuts—
