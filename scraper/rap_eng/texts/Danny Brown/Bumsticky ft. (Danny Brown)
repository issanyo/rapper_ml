[Verse 1]
Christ on the cross man
Jesus who is this
Can't fuck with the gods
Better fuck out my business
Gimme Sixteen bars you know I'm kill it
Who said you can talk
Nigga I am not ain't finished
This human error brings more terror then terrorist
My Mouth a flame thrower y'all other niggas just candlesticks
How much lean did you drink to think you could handle this
Been Spitting  sixteens since 17 I been killing shit
I’m not a rapper
And no not an emcee
I'm 20 times better
I'm everything you wanna be
I am not wanna be
I got my own identity
Fuck zero to a one hundred i go zero to infinity
Beast coast the movement
Mic I abuse it
Die for this music
I'm not amused with
The fame or the chains
Came to fuck up the game
Leave yo king slain
Kiss the tip of my blade

[Chorus]: Danny Brown
Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, Das EFX shit
Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, Das EFX shit
Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, Das EFX shit
Yo yo yo go

[Verse 2]
Got her  Bum sticky
She got me like Dum diggy
Make me sweat with that neck till I blast off like Jimmy
Neutron
Nigga fuck yo couch and yo futon
That's a 2 for one you didn't even need a Groupon
Shit getting scary like ju-un
Nigga said I fell off what the fuck was you on
You off
Spit bricks harder then bedrock
Y'all niggas bedsoft my dick get off
This dick aint free nah you gotta pay for parking
Only way i'll let get get a lick is if she's starving
Kick her out the crib is she turns down my marvin
Savage nigga  Spartan
Out  this world a martian
Roast a nigga like a marshmallow
Preppy white type to niggas in the ghetto
Don’t discriminate
I Only eliminate And innovate
No dust to settle these niggas i just disintegrate

[Chorus]: Danny Brown
Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, Das EFX shit
Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, Das EFX shit
Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, Das EFX shit
