[Verse 1: Black Milk]
A-yo, long awaited, debated
But fuck it here we are brah
Here to save the game just like a memory card
Memory loss to Cali dro
To Amsterdam, out on the patio
Rockin like a Beatle', I should record up in Abbey Road
Bet he flow, there he go talkin' that
Hood rich, money talk, hood rich, Black male
With music that's always in the hood like crack sales
Or out in the burbs like E pills
He feels, niggas can't fuck with him
Shows, plenty fans round the globe screamin' out y'all niggas can't fuck with him
(Yep yep) Hit 'em with that new shit
Hittin' off a new chick
That want me in her mouth like a toothpick
Who flips better heat? See this shit's timeless
While y'all niggas got bad timing like teen pregnancies
Better be, better see, we coming with better heat

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Sittin on some Kobe's, smoking on a stogie
Bangin Noreaga, when I'm done I light the bogie (what, what)
Forty on the floor mat a leave ya holey moley
Banana in her tailpipe, I'll make her Axel Foley
Eatin' on pierogies, goose mixed with Sobe
Smokin' on a OZ, pimpin' like a O.G
If you never knew me, then you probably never know me
Blade on me homey mask on like Shinobi
Ball so hard, got a MVP trophy
Smoke so much kush, I forget the hoes that blow me
Thick white bitch, slurp a nigga like Kirby
Hoes on a nigga and they all look thirsty
Say they nineteen and they all look thirty
Everyday clean y'all always dirty
Chronic coming in the same bag as a turkey
Dark color purple and it's tasting like Hershey
