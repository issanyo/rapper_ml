[Intro: SD]x2
I know I'm the shit, I'm the world new order
I got all this money, boy, I do this for my daughter
I ain't with the talkin;yeah, we savage so we slaughter
We do homicides all these niggas stay up on us

[Verse 1: SD]
I ain't with the talkin', boy, lets get this shit in order
I bought a million dollar guns we could say it so [?]
I got all this money we could make another road trip
Alot of niggas talkin but my squad they savage turnt up
I fucked alot of hoes; I dont really think I love 'em
Money talkin, boy it change the whole discussion
All these guns around me, boy, this shit could start
Some problems, money in my pockets got my pockets
Looking lovely, and we got the ratchets in the chambers
This shit here ain't changing
I know I'm the god to your family, take you out this proudly
Show im a god in the streets

[Hook: SD]x2
I know I'm the shit, I'm the world new order
I got all this money, boy i do this for my daughter
I ain't with the talkin yeah we savage so we slaughter
We do homicides; all these niggas, they informers

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Got bands ho like a rockfest
Monster ho that's Loch Ness
She succeed to suck seed
Then after me do the squad next
Balenciagas on my pride
Givenchy tee with that Rottweiler
Suckin' me and fuckin' me
Cause I got the white like Bon Iver
Pop a pill tyrna get hype
Get expired with the tec fire
Too loud with the .45
You seasick like a boat rider
When you see me thats 4 or 5
Bands ho, for the outfit
Balmains cost me a grand
With a white ho that loves the sniff
Backwood with that dope in it
Cream soda with a fo' in it
Double cup of that Actavis
Got me moving in slow mo' and shit
Stacking bricks like a pyramid
Y'all fuckin' with pounds of mid
Gettin money like illuminati
Tryna wake up in a new Bugatti

[Hook x2]
I know I'm the shit, I'm the world new order
I got all this money, boy i do this for my daughter
I ain't with the talkin yeah we savage so we slaughter
We do homicides; all these niggas, they informers
