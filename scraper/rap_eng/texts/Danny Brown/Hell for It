[Verse 1]
Holy spirit
When I look
I cannot see
Reflection in the mirror
Broke bread with the Judas
And I think I see it clearer
These niggas want what’s mine
But I be damn if I’m a give up
Stuck up in the hood
Praying rap would get me out
Momma ‘bout to lose her house
Gotta figure this shit out
Use to catch the bus to 12th
Just to hustle for some Prada
In the kitchen with my uncle
Beat the pot like a piñata
Baraka wit the product
Use to hide it in my closet
Type of shit
That have a fiend
Crawling on his carpet
Walking over carcasses
Of artists in my garden
Nice with the bars
Even the beat begs my pardon
Got me mistaken
Muslim salami bacon
Always on the defense
So it’s no offense taken
I’m smoking on them raisins
From the bay they taste amazing
Cajun kicking flavor
All the time
Not on occasion
Would be amazed
All the time I heard I wouldn’t make it
I was writing shit that was so damn amazing
When half these little niggas was still watching
That’s so raven
I was out there hustling
Scraping up and saving
Just to catch a 12 hour bus to NY
Sleeping on the floor in studios
Asking God why
But never got deterred
From the voice I heard inside
Tell myself everyday
The greatest that’s alive

[Hook]
And I'm a give em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
Unless death come first
My nigga
I’m a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell

[Verse 2]
Cause we living in that
Actavis double cups was addicted to that
Had them demons on my back
Was escaping through that
Blamed everybody but myself
Apologies for that
So they hold a nigga back
For the way that I act
People scared of doing business
Thinking I smoke crack
I react immature
To anyone talking smack
Cause where I'm from respect
The only thing that you have
Grew up virtually poor
Realities unmasked
So my task
Is inspire your future with my past
I lived through that shit
So you don’t have to go through it
Stepping stones in my life
Hot coals
Walk with me
Listen when I speak
Every time talk with me
Couple screws loose
You don't wanna start
With me
Got it from Motown
Feel David Ruffin pain
Wanna cry right now            
So I’m wishing that it rain
Cause I’m knowing I’m the best
They compare skills to sales
Tell myself everyday
Know this shit ain’t real
Radio don’t make you ill
They get a hit a they feel they self
Respect for lyricism
In this game ain’t none left
Have a bitch like Iggy
Think she sicker than me
And that’s so fucked up
That’s just how this shit be
I just wanna make music
Fuck being a celebrity
Cause these songs that I write
Leave behind my legacy

[Hook]
And I'm a give em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
Unless death come first
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga

[Outro]
I'm a give em hell
I'm a give em hell
