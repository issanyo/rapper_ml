[Verse 1]
I'm Einstein
Off two lines and moonshine
Too lit, hit two bitches at noontime
Spiritless like prostitutes that steal shit
Limitless when them chemicals mixed
Mentally unfit
I'm physically on tilt
Eyes puffy chasing grants like Horace
Put the D on, no Warwick
Arms I will bear for the porridge
Porshe out the storage
Cayenne truck, watch me floor it
Eating calamari with the swordfish
Penthouse enormous
Doing blow in silk garments
Smoking so much
You would think I had a farm of it
Writing like Shakespeare on the top tier
10 in life bid with his shank near
To be or not to be thats what the question is
A brackhead blacked out off the medicine
Evident I'm heaven sent but hell bent
Two licks, her pussy wetter than whale piss
All getting money know you tell bitch
With a bag of drugs looking like trail mix
On the road to riches got it all mapped out
Doing all these drugs 'til a nigga black out

[Chorus]
Welcome to my horror show
Horrible how I will do all off you
Try the undeniable sire of diabolical
What, welcome to my horror show
What
Welcome to my horror show
Horrible how I will do all off you
Try the undeniable sire of diabolical
What, welcome to my horror show
What, welcome to my horror show

[Verse 2]
They think drugs gon' . kill me
But these off these drugs on kill you
Snorting on some igloo
Smoking on some mildew
Writing that apocalypse
Stronger than Black Panther fist
No philanthropist
For the scandalous
Drink a can of piss
My manuscript
Can turn an evangelist to satanist
I'm faded with this
Struggle with one another
For faith in it
Devilish acts
Praying I get away with it
Sitting waiting patient
Taking everything that's sacred
Even your imagination
Can't think when you're in hell
'Bout to lose everything
Like Jack and Jill's pail
Got a nigga's brain captured
Like SeaWorld whales
I'm a nigga from the hood
I can see the world well
That's why I get fucked up
'Cause I can't lift up the veil
Can't look in a mirror
'Cause I hate myself

[Chorus]
Welcome to my horror show
Horrible how I will do all off you
Try the undeniable sire of diabolical
What, welcome to my horror show
What
Welcome to my horror show
Horrible how I will do all off you
Try the undeniable sire of diabolical
What, welcome to my horror show
What, welcome to my horror show
