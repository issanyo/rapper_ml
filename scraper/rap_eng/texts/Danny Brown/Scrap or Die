[Verse 1]
Looking at this crib for a bout a whole month
A family live there, they got put out last month
My uncle sniffing blow while I'm rolling up a blunt
His homie in the basement smoking crack with my aunt
And tonight's that night we 'bout to get right
Piled up in a van with a couple flashlights
Metal crowbars gon' get us through the door
Take everything nigga, fuck the landlord
So now we at the place skullys on bareface
'Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place
My unc took outside he ripping down the gutters
So we inside tearing up this mothafucka
Bust open the walls just to get the wiring
Took the hot water tank and leftover appliances
Aluminum siding and had to come back
Cause the furnace so big, it wouldn't fit in the back

[Hook]
Now it's copper by the pound, wire by the inch
Got a check on the first and it's gone by the fifth
Scrap or die, nigga
And you might be laughing at it cause you know the shit is true
Rusty flat bed truck the color of doo-doo
Scrap or die, nigga

[Verse 2]
Early morning next day at the junkyard
Got four loads 'bout to get broke off
But these niggas slick man, I swear I'm going off
Put the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off
Cause I know we had way more than that
But fuck it, split it up ay I get more than that
These niggas always slick on that bullshit
Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit
So we back in the hood, plot the next lick
Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc to get back from the clinic
And we gone go over there to see what's up with it
Now we up in it taking old computers
Until we fucking heard "Don't move or I shoot ya"
Fucked up the hook caught us tryna cash in
Now we gotta B&E case of trespassing

[Hook]
Now it's copper by the pound, wire by the inch
Got a check on the first and it's gone by the fifth
Scrap or die, nigga
And you might be laughing at it cause you know the shit is true
Rusty flat bed truck the color of doo-doo
Scrap or die, nigga
