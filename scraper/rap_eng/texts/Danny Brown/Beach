[Verse 1: Petite Noir]
[?]
Is this all a dream now?
Is this all a dream or is it all in my head?
The Xanax put me to bed
It's like Inception I swear
But we have nothin' to fear
This is the final dance

[Chorus]
If this life is worth living
I hope you hear about me
My family loves givin'
So won't you set me free
'Cause I just reached my limit
And I wanna let go
'Cause I just wanna let go

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Let's talk about life
Gotta take chances, gotta think twice
Imma grab that plate and a knife
Imma show you right now, gotta sacrifice
Let's talk about death
Fuck what tomorrow bring
When a angel strike that's it
Gonna have my face on that magazine
Never fret, my way, and no nigga stop my grind
[?]
That's why I wait I be [?]
Not these show-lights [?]
Told you a long time ago I'm gon' make it
Swear I'm in a great shit, [hell like ?] Vegas
Asian persuasion, Miss Caucasian
Road that you make it tastes like raisins
[?] look at my long driveway, so I ain't gotta listen what you say
Finnesse that shit, did it my way
Got signed, right, 'n I ain't go away
But 'less you in a gang with no-tooth-nigga
Drive that car with no roof, nigga
They all drugged out [?]
It's a shame what they do for the fame
Goddamn, goddamn

[Bridge: Petite Noir]
Losing sleep
Cover our ears to go
I'm on a mission
We're lacking vision
Before my bed
Ready for a day

[Chorus]
If this life is worth living
I hope you hear about me
My family loves givin'
So won't you set me free
'Cause I just reached my limit
And I wanna let go
'Cause I just wanna let go

If this life is worth living
I hope you hear about me
My family loves givin'
So won't you set me free
'Cause I just reached my limit
And I wanna let go
'Cause I just wanna let go
