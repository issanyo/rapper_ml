[Verse 1]

Check!

I'm so what's-upper
When I hear a beat it's like mommy saying "Time for supper"
I guess that means the studio is my diner
Your chain hang like tampon strings out vaginas
So nigga you pussy, Wrap that kushy
Your girl wanna suck it like 7-11 slushie
So give me that gushy, funky, nasty stuff
Israel like Nazareth, meaning he is real
Nigga your beat's like a cheap x pill
Mean nothing to me like a lonely cheap thrill
True plus real equals a trill, and minus your bitch ass
Bound to drown like toddlers in advanced swim class
Drink a bitch quick like fat hoes do Slim Fast
All my bitches ballin' in the D like Swin Cash
And she brings that paper
Shake that ho like ultimate warrior do the ropes
If she moves slow with the dough
Fire that bitch, hire a new ho
Danny Brown a hybrid
Sort of like a pirate off acid, bangin' Primus
Smoking that cough that'll fuck up your sinus
Heater with me sorta like that blanket and Linus

[Verse 2]

And I don't need a hook for this shit
Cuff my balls, Suck my dick
Nigga I'm the shit, call me Pull-ups
And when the hoes see me, they all pull up
They take a flick with me, My pic in her iPhone
Ten seconds later, my dick in her jaw bone
And she say "Ow, it feels good"
She says "Brown, you're so hood"
So what's good? Whatcha don't know?
I like my ho fast that ride dick slow
Bitches online, I call 'em free throws
Shoot it on her like Jordan on Craig Ehlo
Nigga no homo, Nigga I'm him
Rap like Three Stacks mixed with Em, where's Kim?
Probably in the D just like me
If you fight like Bruce Lee, I'mma kill you in your sleep
Cause I'm your favorite rapper, favorite rapper, favorite rapper
You're fake candy bars get tossed like the wrapper
Ho no kiddin' , Bitch are you trickin' ?
Brown a slim thug, but I'm not still tippin'
