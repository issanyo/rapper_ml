[Chorus x2]
You call me up at six, come 'round
Undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Used to come around
You'd be knockin' on my front door
Playing board-games
Horror films with the super gore
Thought that you were cute from the start
Yeah I’m pretty sure
You were like the medicine
The medicine I wanted more
All along I wanted someone to vibe with
Found the guy I want the rest of my life with
We on some husband and wife shit
I don’t really care, ‘cause I know that I like it

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart’s been broken
We’ll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart’s been broken
We’ll be sitting on your bedroom floor
Still smoking
Smoking, smoking

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Don't stop just get it
Let me see what you workin' with
Baby girl is you wit'it?
Don't stop, keep twerkin' it

Let me tell you what I like
Look at you, you just my type
Lookin' in your eyes
It blows my mind
Let me look back at it one more time

She pop, she pop, she know just what she doin'
Real cute in the face
But real slim in the waist
So you know that I'm pursuing

So tell me what we doin'
Baby girl, where we go from here?
Wanna tell you what I like
Let me whisper in your ear
So go and break it down
I'm ask you once
So you know I got to make it count

Now don't just listen
Baby girl, don't make a sound
When I get you back home all alone
Gonna make it bounce
Okay I'm getting off track, so what

I'd like to spend some time with you
Maybe share a glass of wine or two
Talk all night, share a joke or two
Maybe get a smile or laugh at you

But first, but first
You ain't gotta keep searchin'
Just hit me up where you workin'
I'll tell you what I like in person

[Verse 3: Charli XCX]
Oh now I got a plan, I hope you gonna be my man
I can see us cushy in the house right by the ocean sand
And when I’m one to cry
I hope you gonna hold my hand
And when they gonna shake us down
I hope you're gonna make a stand
This shit is super wild, this shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta, I think I’m into you
This shit is super wild, this shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta, I think I’m into you

[Chorus  x2]
