[Intro]
Bent her ass over, bent her ass over
Bent her ass—
Bent her ass over, bent her ass over
Bent her ass—
Bent her ass over, bent her ass over
Bent her ass over, then I hit it from the back

[Verse 1]
Bitch name Nicki, oh-so freaky
Hotel lobby in New York City
Right up in the open, she was playing with her pussy
My eyes couldn't help it, I was staring at that pussy
And she looked right at me, "You wanna waste time?"
I looked at my watch, "I got time"
She couldn't wait, on the elevator
Rubbing on my dick, oh, she made it wake up
Made it to her room, coincidence, no lyin'
Had to chuckle when her number was 69
Didn't waste time, I didn't either
Rubbing on her clit with my finger in her beaver
She told me to eat her, and I did
Grown-man dick, bitch, ain't playing with no kids
And then I gave that ass a smack
Bent her ass over then I hit it from the back

[Hook]
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back

[Verse 2]
She whipped out this case and I couldn't believe my eyes
Had every toy that money could buy
Pulled out the vibrator, stuck it in her pussy
Pulled out my dick, put her mouth on it
Told her, "Get on it," hopped on top
Bouncing all on it, making them titties hop
I flipped her over to beat it from the back
She was biting on that pillow, on the bed sheets she grabbed
That ass so fat, that waist so flat
But I ain't gon' front, her face wasn't all that
So, this that perfect position
Never missionary we just stayed in that position
Uh, so no, no kissing
Nah, bitch, no, no kissing
She came first, and I came last
Rolled up the grass while I palmed on that ass from the back

[Hook]
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back
From the back, from the back, from the back, from the back

[Outro]
Bent her ass over, bent her ass over
Bent her ass—
Bent her ass over, bent her ass over
Bent her ass—
Bent her ass over, bent her ass over
Bent her ass—
Bent her ass over, then I hit it from the back
