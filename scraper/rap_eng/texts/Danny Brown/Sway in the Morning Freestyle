Codeine in my cereal always with the smokie
I'm sort of like a miracle these rappers are venereal
And never am I stereo I spray your ass with Vinegar
The next time I see you, bro, bitch your ass still won't be tight
The size of my dick, nigga, every pussy tight
I write all night till the sun come up
Dodging texts from your sister trying to lick on my nuts
Cobra clutch the game put that bitch into submission
Yo bitch want the stick shift no transmission
Dog I'm on a mission you're playing exhibition
On the expedition popping x but never tripping
Chilling with a vixen trying to stick my dick in
Red headed ho like a young Kathy Griffin
Smoke so many blunts I can hear my lungs whistling
Still rolling up house smelling like chicken
Rap Martin Lawrence all these other rappers boring
Bruiser make 2 Live Crew look like some mormons
Nigga, my essay hard like a life doing esse
Gangbanging on the yard with a homemade machete
Been nice since cassette tapes stay smoking heavy
Popped a couple pills eyes glowing like Belly
Use to stash cracks in the seam of my Pelle
Detroit nigga but I'm smoking on LA
