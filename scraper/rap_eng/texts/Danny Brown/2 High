[Intro: Danny Brown]
Tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so I get too high

[Hook: Danny Brown]
But they tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna, tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna, tryna tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so I get too high
But they tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna, tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna, tryna tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so I get too high

[Verse 1: $crim]
Indica, purple kush, seeping out my lungs tonight
Sirens sound, fuck the 12, fuck the feds, I merk on sight
Molly water, Xanax bars, welcome to my house of horrors
Cocaine, nose drain, get my dope straight from the border
Torture, torture, trizzy, trizzy, got a six but I'm no Drizzy
Daughter slaughter, holy water, phone at me when if it petty
Choppa city, 5-1-50, cut throat with the infrared
Sipping screw till I am through
Think I'm too high?
Well, bitch fuck you

[Hook: Danny Brown]
But they tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna, tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna, tryna tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so I get too high
But they tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna, tryna tell me I get too high
Tryna, tryna tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so I get too high

[Verse 2: Ruby da Cherry]
I'm just another parasite of paradise
I shed the lies we all tell ourselves every night
I'm nothing special, I got my devils locked in a kennel
Let me settle, I'ma sell 'em and hope they're dead any day
Ruby got a palm full of pills when I get the scales
(and hope they're dead any day)
I make 'em disappear put the pressure on my peers, oh my God
I gotta barrel with one thought on my face without a trace
The whole place kick you in the face all laced
Well, at least my sneakers on, Ruby cleaned it
Unsheath the gauntlet, I’ve been living in the RV
Down at Palm Beach, fuck a palm tree
Cut my wrist ‘till my palm bleeds
