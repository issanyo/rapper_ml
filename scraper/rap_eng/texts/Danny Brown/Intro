[Verse 1]
Niggas don't want no beef
I'm in a bake potato cutty with the sour cream seats
Window down, no A/C
Goin' anywhere my instinct take me
Mojo back, so "oh behave"
A nigga get left like batman cave
Nowhere to be found, gan by the pound
Sort of like Rodman how I rebound
Fresh off a county been came home broke
Now I'm in the back of the drop like the pope
Blowin' on some kush, it look like smush
That's black, purp, and yellow, it tastes like jello
No medicare but the flow's so sick
Cause Brown got grain like a hot pot of grits
Your girl gave me head and cooked a bullshit breakfast
And that pussy bow like that weave down in Texas
I play the game no coaches
Brown done been through more raids than roaches
My bitch eat pills like M&M's
Give me head, say it taste like cinnamon

[Verse 2]
I can sell heat to a camel, ice to a penguin
Bread to a bird, nigga you ain't heard?
From the first to the third, I'mma get my money
Rain, hail, snow, double up when it's sunny
See us with a ho, no we straight bust, owed her
Say we gon' pay her when we finish, and we older
Earn his own jeans with the AirMax laced up
Sing so high you can tell that I'm caked up
I open doors like Benson
Nigga I'm the truth like Jesus' opinion
Rain on the moonroof, smud shotgun
Tellin' me a story 'bout her ex caught a hot one
It's all good
Put my dick through her mouth like screw through her wood
Popped three pills then the bitch got loose
Run me for a hour then lick off the juice
