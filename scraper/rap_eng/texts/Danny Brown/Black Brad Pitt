[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
I go to sleep with pictures of porn hoes on my wall
Bitch I'm tryna to fuck all y'all
And the laws of attraction say vision it, you'll see it
So I'm tryna close my eyes to see a million bitches screaming
Begging for the semen from the demon with no tooth
Getting head in the back seat, reflection on the moon roof
Your bitch pussy loose goose, fly like parachute
Hit the booth and now a nigga shining like spaceboots
Y'all niggas sub-par, Brown like the space bar
Hit me go, forward flow tight like a gay star
Y'all whack like a nigga with a fucking rape charge
Never leave his cell because he gon get jumped on the yard
I met a bitch, and now she got a wedding ring
We fucking hoes together on a thousand dollar sex swing
They use toys, I sniff coke and watch
While Iâ€™m jerking on my dick pre-nuttin' all on my socks
Broads all abroad want to take they bras off
Just to squeeze on they nipple while they suck a nigga off
Real heavy with the spit, I'm feeling like the black Brad Pitt

[Hook]
I'm the black Brad Pitt, the black Brad Pitt
All these bitches on my dick, I'm the black Brad Pitt
The black Brad Pitt, the black Brad Pitt
All these bitches on my dick, I'm the black Brad Pitt
Brad Pitt, ho, Brad Pitt, bitch
Brad Pitt, ho, Brad Pitt, bitch
Brad Pitt, ho, Brad Pitt, bitch
Brad Pitt, ho, Brad Pitt, bitch

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
She said Brown you's a freaky ass nigga
Licking on my dick while I'm on splitting the swisha
Busting in her hair like Something About Mary
Never shave my pubes bitch my nuts stay hairy
All up in your teeth, ya gotta pick it out
I hit it from the back bitch, she gotta stick it out
Stick my dick up in your mouth bitch, and don't be scared
Know you heard my songs, ho be very aware
So don't forget the balls, got to slurp it all
Black Brad Pitt, Angelina on call
And we gon ball, straight to the playoffs
82 games, bitch, no fucking days off
Starting playa y'all niggas ride the bench
Tell I blow the herb cause my clothes got the stench
All these hoes on my dick
Cause I'm the black Brad Pitt

[Hook]
