[Verse 1]
I'm the first to breakfast, late for dinner
Flow so hot I'm sorta like incine-rator
Hater none greater than the urban dictator
Spit like New Jack City wedding caterer
Brown like the Prince of Arabia
The Last Dragon your Eddie Arkadian
I'm negotiating like Chris Sabian
You on some gay shit like Les Nubians
I'm in the new B.M. playing Brand Nubian
What I am is a new being
Not a martian nor human I'm hybrid
Open ya eyelids
You might miss something like a
Phenomenon
Far from a honest john
Used to slang for weeks without Degree under my underarms
I can go on and on
Rocks in my long johns
You were wearing cummerbunds on yo way to prom
I was chopping like lumberjacks
Clutch ya girls pom poms
Nigga you a puss puss
I beat you like a tom tom
Mush you for kush
And blow it wit ya baby moms
And I ain't got to tell you cause you know just where I come from

(who is this kid, some sort of cyborg?)
I'm a Hybrid
SOLAR BARS!!!

[Verse 2]
I'm the first to breakfast late for dinner
Flow so cold I'm sorta like polar
Solar system planet Neptune
Black like car fumes
Colors like cartoons
They say Danny Brown "boy you a fool"
"Where you get them shoes"
Look nigga don't remember
Shop so much everyday like December
Wrapping up the chronic while I open up a 5th
My bitch a bad girl she don't get no gifts
She just get froze
She just get snow
She just get my dick hard under mistletoe
I know its fucked up that's ya little sister bro
She gotta fat ass that's just how this shit go
Watching Anchorman she go down slow
Oh Oh
I'm bout to cum
Now runteldat like Martin Lawrence stand up
No this ain't a robbery but nigga get yo hands up
Like yo granny at church when the preacher said stand up
She said, "Oh lord
Please help my grandson get up out the basement and find his self a job"
"Find a nice girl so he can quit jacking off
"And leaving white stains allover my new towels"
Ow Ow Ow

I'm a hybrid
SOLAR BARS!
