[Verse 1]
She was only 24 when she first did snow
Turned out by her boyfriend who used to push coke
Start fucking with them needles caught HIV
Now somebody's momma is R.I.P
He was only 15 when he first got locked
Got out when he was 21 did the same on the block
Never knew nothing else, never changed his ways
Now he locked up for life, doing time all day
Nigga had a good shot, thought NBA
'Til a motherfucker shot his ass all in the face
Nigga died too young, never seen his dream
Fucked up cos the little nigga only 16
Might sound fictional but this our life
For my nigga's locked down not getting the kite
Wouldn't change nothgin else 'bout where I'm from
Made me who I am, growing up in the slums
