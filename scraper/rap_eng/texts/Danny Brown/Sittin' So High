[Intro]
Detroit, Stand up!
It's Danny Brown!
Nick's Beat!

[Verse 1]
Sway Seats minx floor with a digi' dash
Danny Brown got hoes like dance class
Float work make money get spent fast
Cutty on a 26 inches with the run flats
Tiger Fitted with the gan' in a swisher sweet
Trunk sounding like a Mazda on trickery
Got cute Feet, then what's your content?
Let me squirt it on your lips like carmex
She don't want me, just wanna hop in
Take her shopping, let me hit it at the drop in
Got the Cutty same color as some chickenskin
Every night I'm hoppin' in and out of chickenskin
In your residence counting up dividends
True allegiance jeans blue and yellow like Michigan
It ain't the vision its simple working at kitchen then
Its work attract and it's all simple at dishing things

[Hook]
My wheels so big got me sittin' in the sky
Shawty just smack it up on my thigh
You ain't never seen a Cutty sit up this high
Never seen a Cutty sit up this high

Man I'm so damn drunk, Man I'm 'boutta get high
Wheels so big, can't believe my eyes
You ain't never seen a Cutty sit up this high
Never seen a Cutty sit up this high

[Verse 2]
Danny Brown, not the rest of these niggas
Though I'm still young, gonna bet to these niggas
Bet no west, no safety on this trigger
Go correct when you step get split like a swiss
Smelling like John Paul in a ball slim sweater
VonZipper shades, help me see a little better

You knew better, you do better
World grand roof with the stitching on the leather
In the Escalade, rolling up haze
Whether nigga like dark skinned Jermaine Sway
Stuntin' in the hood, nigga [?]
Grab a nigga like Brenda try'na steal crack
Chilling on the block nigga, smoking on some kush
You ain't danny brown nigga, you just puss
See me go another direction
It ain't rocket science i keep the protection

[Hook]
My wheels so big got me sittin' in the sky
Shawty just smack it up on my thigh
You ain't never seen a Cutty sit up this high
Never seen a Cutty sit up this high

Man I'm so damn drunk, Man I'm 'boutta get high
Wheels so big, can't believe my eyes
You ain't never seen a Cutty sit up this high
Never seen a Cutty sit up this high

[Outro]
Oh How hip hop really got big
The kids rebelled
The kids would yell at america
Rebelled at disco
Like, we had Rock 'n Roll kids saying disco sucked
We had black kids saying... y'know that wasn't into Rock n' Roll
We had no music
No, we had no real music to get into
RnB, the Motown scene had died down in the late seventies

(...what can i doo)
