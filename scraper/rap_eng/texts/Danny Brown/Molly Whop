[Intro: Danny Brown]
Yeah niggas
Bruiser, bitch
Check!

[Verse 1: Fat Ray]
Shook up the world like Ali
Know a motherfucker want to rob me
Make a pussy nigga can't stand me
Drawin' on the bitches like Stan Lee
Killin' little niggas like a Plan B
I'm workin' 'til the motherfuckin' fam eat
Makin' bags, breakin' back
Bangin' plaid, palm trees
All week, Bruiser bitch it go balls deep
She fall asleep
Btich thought she was finna surfboard
Threw her on the motherfuckin' jet ski
And it's 'gon be a motherfuckin' turf war
For any nigga tryna disrespect me
I'm bustin' like a motherfuckin' AR-15
Make a nigga never want to lay that sixteen
Never was a nigga finna play that bitch [?]
'Bout to get your motherfuckin' Maybach switch [?]
Gang sign language, nigga what that lick read?
Makin' bad bitches go and get that whip cream
Makin' bad bitches go and get that quick weed
Somethin' like a captain on the US swim team
Dive on a bitch, broadcast live on the strip
Shoot five, I'ma make this brick leave

[Chorus: Kash Tha Kushman]
Two bags and some [?]
Ridin' with some liqour
Ratchet white hoes get loose for a nigga
The life that we be livin' as some hooligan gremlins [?]
Niggas get greasy, we shootin' that nigga
Bet a nigga [?] with the 40-cal pistol
Keep a nigga drippin' for talkin' that bitch shit
Chopper get to rockin', two shots with precision
One shot kill, I molly whop a nigga
Molly whop a nigga, I molly whop a nigga
One shot kill, I molly whop a nigga

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Check!
Time after time like Cyndi Lauper
Beat stay bangin' like a [?]
Flow so cold, button up your parka
Never ridin' shotgun with drunk Paul Walker
Fuckin' with a Bruiser make you hear that blaw
AK shells these [?]
Sittin' in the CO smokin' on blocka
When we was kids, hit you in the head with the talker
Fuckin' with the candy, shove your ass in a locker
'Bout to get in it like Dopehead chopper
These Cartiers, bitch, not blue blockers
Put the D on her like Serge Ibaka
Let them guns sound but my name ain't Waka
Heater on the screen like Silkk the Socker
Body boy blocker [?], ain't no shotta
Talkin' that tough but he an imposter
Bruiser brigade, bitch throw that set up
Fuck what you claim
I got a car full of hoes, 8 ball of blow
And they all suck dick and play with their nose
So they all get hit, it don't matter who you chose
And we hit licks, don't get your shit stole
Got a pound, all in the zips, and we waitin' on some more
Got a nine on my hip, don't get your ass poled [?]
Kash Tha Kushman roll that dope up
Live that rate [?] nigga tryna get fucked up
Yeah we smoke, nigga put that purp up
Wavy off the xany, nigga so it's "surf's up"
Kash Tha Kushman roll that dope up
Live that rate [?] nigga tryna get fucked up
Yeah we smoke, nigga put that purp up
Wavy off the xany, so nigga it's "surf's up"

[Chorus: Kash Tha Kushman]
Two bags and some [?]
Ridin' with some liqour
Ratchet white hoes get loose for a nigga
The life that we be livin' as some hooligan gremlins [?]
Niggas get greasy, we shootin' that nigga
Bet a nigga [?] with the 40-cal pistol
Keep a nigga drippin' for talkin' that bitch shit
Chopper get to rockin', two shots with precision
One shot kill, I molly whop a nigga
Molly whop a nigga, I molly whop a nigga
One shot kill, I molly whop a nigga
