Bitch... it's Bruiser Brigade

[Verse 1: Chip$]
Shut your eyes...
Your bitch is a beauty, Chip$ is a beast
I run shit in these Michigan streets
357 o's we get wish from the east
Give you another mouth, missin' the teeth
Fuck a mission for peace got a piece on the mission
Got a blade sharper than a beak on a chicken
Fuck you up like a runaway slave
Carve a nigga up like a honey baked ham
Put your shoes up, tell them niggas put the rugers down
Kick his ass so bad that nigga shit-swooshed now
My little niggas loose 'em wow
Put the metal in your mouth like a yule root canal
Chip$.... no braces, I'm strapped up.... no laces
I'm so racist I only like the green guy
My stacks king size, niggas soft as creampies
I jizzed, and I still got a appetite
So way to grab the knife, and we'll have a slice

[Hook: Keely and Chip$]
We pop bottles, pull your forks up...
If you niggas eating good put your forks up...
Do it for my niggas in the penal...
We gon' get this money in the meanwhile...
We pop bottles, let the suds float...
If you niggas smokin' good, let your blunts blow...
Got stacks in the stashbox...
And they tell me not to stunt on you have-nots...

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Serve work look like I'm playing patty cake
Left hand drop, right hand take
Smack a fiend over credit off the esus jesus
Know I got them hard lines like a horny zebra
Split a swisher sweet open with my thumbnail
Doing kush-ups fuck with the dumbbells
Used to be out in phoneix loading up bails
On the trailer, y'all was fuckin' with direct sells
44 nose lookin' like Gargamel's
Turn a giant to a smurf, niggas marhsmallow
Actin' hard like coke head dick
You niggas pussy I'm gonna eat y'all clit
Raise a tap glass plate like hi-hat
Took a trip to seven mail with a pirate
Nigga I ain't a cripple but I stay with the cane
Bitches skinny dipping in the lake purple rain

[Hook]
