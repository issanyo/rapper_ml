[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Roll up, roll up

Roll up, roll up, yea

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo:]
Two guns up Machine Gun Kelly
I leave you stuck in a box like skelley
With a 100 dutch masters layin in the mansion
Bad bitch give me a kiss with a shotgun
I catch an air 1 the rap Kevin Durant
Dubal suite 7-5 the lanth
For just one night
Gucci jogger hold the gun tight
I never sleep cause death is in my eye sight
Three girls in my ride, Marc Jacob'd up
One bitch roll up, one bitch spark up

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Roll up, roll up
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll the fuck up

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I smoke like a pound in my pocket
The flow shock value like forts and wall sockets
The chronic lookin' like the sweater biggie used to wear
Got me feelin so good that I might run for mayor
You think you smoke a lot, nigga we smoke more
Fuck whores in corridors lowkey like midget doors
Fill up with plastic cups the way these white boys score
From the D with the rhymes, Jessica Gaymore
I only fuck with models, actresses, stewardess
Y'all niggas broke like a fucking cali student is
We make classic albums with no budgets
The bitch clit smelling like cat fish nuggets
Big blunts with kief , dry secretion on my briefs
And most of these bitches bums I fuck em I smoke anis
Where all the hoes at hurts beats and eats in the light
Eats beats and skeet skeets on her cheeks dayumm

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Roll up, roll up
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up
Roll the fuck up
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll up, roll up, yea
Roll the fuck up
