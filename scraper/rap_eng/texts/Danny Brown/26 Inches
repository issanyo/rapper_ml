Lemon squeeze 45 ACP
Black champ hoodie black ACG
Old school [?] like [?] green
Blowing on gan banging that green
450 [?] full dual exhaust im mashing
Got more wood than a fucking cabin
Inside white like sitting in napkins
26 inches nigga whats happening
Bout to get the paper like school supply shopping
Like police academy Brown  stay copping
Broke not an option flipping copping
So much grass you can run a toboggan
[?]
Bout to serve a nigga while i'm talking on my cellie
Ride 96 cash i'm blessed with
Rims scarp the frame coming off the carter exit


Old school Chevy on 26 inches
I don't do it for me man i do it for the bitches
I just do it for the hoes
Looking down on niggas sitting on 24s
26 inches looking down on y'all (x4)


Neighborhood jeans on top of the moccasins
Money in my pocket necessary like oxygen
[?]
Laying on a sports page
Bagged up the number of your age in 10th grade
Another day another dollar
Pushing the pedal on the Chevy with the Pradas
You sitting low on 24s
My Chevy higher than stdio 54
But i try to stay grounded
Keep a level head got money so i count it
[balls?] in that zip lock
Wood-grain dash
Candy cane flip flop
Hook on my ass
Bitches on my nuts
Niggas stay hatin'
But i don't give a fuck
Tell em catch me [?]
Bank rolls raining like money ain't a thing


Old school Chevy on 26 inches
I don't do it for me man i do it for the bitches
I just do it for the hoe's
Looking down on nigga sitting on 24s
26 inches looking down on y'all (x4)
I do it for the hoes
