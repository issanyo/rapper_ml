[Intro: Danny Brown]
CHECK!
You're now listening to Araabmuzik

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Poppin' pills get 'em brought to my door like Avon
This that silk suede leather
Y'all niggas polyester and rayon
I stay on them Warhols
9.0 on your score card
Fuck them hoes that go hard
That ride the dick like a go kart
While I'm stacking up for that Goyard
Y'all niggas playing that broke card
Kush got me up in that solar
Lines gotta nigga face polar
Y'all ain't stuck in that poor part
Y'all niggas never gonna go far
Bitch I'm getting money fucking white hoes with the blonde hair
So nigga don't even go there
Yo ho pussy like goat hair
I'll never hang my coat there
I get head for the smoke fare
Y'all niggas don't deserve air
Yo ho look like wear and tear with hair like Cher
Share and care
Titties all looking like a sack of pears
Y'all niggas still wearing Rocawear
Balmain jeans about a stack a pair
Yo bitch be like they in there
Watch the kids like daycare
Araab beats like a bag of pills
Danny Brown so that ain't fair
Looking for your bitch like "Who? What? Where?"
Triple that molly on the top front tip
Still in the D I ain't goin nowhere
Ho suck me off then said take care
Off a Drake CD don't go there
Now the ho wanna freak me like it's 94 and I'm JoJo
Told the ho when she meet me on the creep creep no photos
Got a bad bitch teach yoga, and all she want is these shoulders
Hit me up the status is kosher
Dome me up watching Colbert
Nigga I'm never sober
Hungover
In that bag
Dipping with my index my pinky up like that
So bitch I'm on some movie shit
No director shit but Spike that
Bought an eighth of them cookies
Two hours I was right back
Fo's in them cups so nigga go and Sprite that
Yo bitch know what's up my nigga go on and light that
I'm slumped against the wall bitches on my balls

[Outro: Danny Brown]

Red head ho look like Molly Ringwald
Molly Ringwald
Molly Ringwald
Red head ho look like Molly Ringwald
Off that Molly Ringwald
STYLE!
