[Verse 1]
Clutch your toes on that wall ho, bounce that ass like a pogo
Shake and roll like a craps game in a Las Vegas casino
Call all of them freak hoes that bounce that ass to that Diplo
She take a dip, then take a sip, then dip dip dip
All I wanna do is make her ride this dick
Bouncing on that ass while she biting on her lip
Really wanna grab it when she look back at it
With a look on her face like she just did magic
Jeans on cost about eighteen hundred
Pop a little pill so you know I stay blunted
Blowing that sticky now it's time to get freaky
Take a dip in the back, rubber gun in my pinky
Tanga got me rolling, thing she keep on, woah
No way that I'm controlling so I gotta put a cheat code
We smoking on that potent, drinking on that potion
She turnt up, hopped in her hand stand, bounced that ass in slow motion

[Hook #1]
I said oh no, my God, little mama be twerking hard
When she back that thang, then she clapped that thang, she for sure got my dick hard

[Verse 2]
And I just wanna take ya home and wear you out
Head for free, no cashing out
Eating on your pussy, got you squirting on your blouse
Hit it from the back on the living room couch
You want a thing that your man won't do
Before you bust one bitch you gotta bust too
Run around to got to do what it do cause I just did me so you gotta do you
Don't stop girl keep twerking it
Let me see what you working with
I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you can do that with my dick in it
The ass looking ridiculous, make me want to get in it
I swear to God she go ignorant, don’t stop girl, keep getting it

[Bridge: Danny Brown]
Toes on the wall and her ass in the air
And she twerk that thing like she ain't have a care
With her toes on the wall and her ass in the air
And she twerk that thing like she ain't have a care

[Hook #2]
Express yourself, express yourself
Express yourself, express yourself
Express yourself, express yourself
Express yourself, express yourself
Go on, girl and express yourself

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Pop the pussy for a goon nigga
Old be coming out soon nigga
So if you ain't in tune nigga
Ratchet gon' tune up a nigga
Make like from your hair to your toes
Can’t hurt your man with something he don’t know
Between me and you girl keep it on the low
Everytime I come around you know it's a freak show
Four bad hoes in my hotel room
Fucking on the pillows while I sleep til noon
Tripping on the molly and start to go party with a big, fat pussy [?]
Ain't no way ya'll fuckin with this, ain't fuckin with this
My tongue game good, no ice on my wrists and a big long dick
So hit me up when you need the help
Dig your R's til you ain't gone left
Had your ass coming before I took off my belt
Go on girl and express yourself

[Hook #2]
