[Verse 1]
Put a stain on the nigga with the blinker?
If a nigga won't go and sing like Max B
Champagne in the hot tub got your bitch turn into a [slug?]
Cuz nigga we wavy, ya'll too lazy, fuck her brains out
Now she crazy, off that dower, got me hazy, sip that grand cru
Now I'm singin', woahhh

[Hook] x 4
She make me sing like Max B, woahhh


[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Your bitch told me run the dick pronto (pronto!)
Rose gold wristwear trick chronological
Biological, no centerfold with a big cock
I'm crackin' lobster tails in a city of Rick Ross
Hermes silky these bitches hit me with the gobbly eyes
Act like Pac if I was Biggy's size
No tattoos but damn I'm smooth
Bitch I turn the college dorm room to Moulin Rouge
You damn fools, we ain't cool I should move
Fuck the same hoes as Tom Cruise
New blue coat sun roof blow smoke through
You goof troop just luck all you can do (that's all you can do!)
No suite, it ain't cheap
Hermes sheets bitches make it on their needs
Skeet skeet skeet
And me I'm G
You ain't me she got me singing like Max B

[Hook]

[Verse 2: TRPL BLK]
She's starin' at my crotch she see my dick pokin'
Daydreams of long strokin' got her panties soakin'
I put the plan in motion she left the room door open
Ran a bubble bath then rubbed her down with lotion
She cum off suckin' dick squirt when you suck her clit
Get on some freak shit add another bitch
Trip brung sand to the beach yellin' switch
I hit she hit everybody hit
Somebody left a condom up in one of these hoes
Better not be a problem outta none of these hoes
I only fuck with bruiser bitches
That don't give a fuck
The hoes you lust on our tour bus drinkin' nut (Yo Bitch)
Run a train and condition her (Yo Bitch)
Her hair full of semen conditioner
She crying while she sucking
Fucking up her make up
Put her on the track like fuck it get that cake up (them boxes)

[Hook]
