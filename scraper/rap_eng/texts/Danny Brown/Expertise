[Verse 1: Danny Brown]

Smoking blunts, wiping ashes off designer jeans
I'm like a king, throwing rings, grabbing angel wings
Doctor King on a balcony in body armor
Kush coma, poppin' pills, should a been a goner
But I'm still here, getting money with the G's
If you ain't really there, like a trick up your sleeve
Your bitch got more seeds than Mexican brick weed
And you ain't got no work, like a nigga on sick leave
My expertise is ex and weed
I do more wet shit than an ex-marine
I'm like a hitch-hiking hipster with Henny in a canteen
Throwin' up gang signs, peace on a Byzantine

[Verse 2: Sahtyre]

Catch me off a fifth of Beam
Light skin James Dean
Every bitches dream
Smoke a gang of green
'til my lungs catch gangrene
Got your girlfriends panties wet
That's a mainstream
Nigga what do you mean
Pull up to the scene with Avril Lavigne
I'm able to logically kill a track
But I don't need a reason, I'm a machine, yeah
I'm smoking purple cookies
Nigga that's some Dr. Seuss shit
Blow my bitch a kiss, she chop my lines up
That's my Sous-Chef
Oh yes, shit too fresh, and if you flex
You get suplexed in your duplex
I ask who's next and then I probably trip some booze next
White bitches think I'm Hugh Heff
But I be like, "Bitch I'm the new Treach"
I can't help it, guess I'm naughty by nature
And if your bitch is acting thirsty
I'm a Bobby Booshay her
I'm on my worst behavior
Prince Thunder, I'm the savior
Been grindin' since DuckTales and Power Rangers
Coz my expertise, is extra steez
Best believe, rep the west
'til I rest in peace
Catch me sussin' in the uber
Taking bumps off keys
It's them motherfucking Bruisers and the LSD
