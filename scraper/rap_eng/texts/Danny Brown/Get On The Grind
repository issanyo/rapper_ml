[Verse 1]
I got a 8 ball in the corner of my sock
Ain't gotta jump shot, so I gotta sell rocks
The middle of the block, where we all copping clock
Hook guys on you, even when you cop a squat
The nights so long and the days real short
Game of cat and mouse so I puff a newport
To take away the stress, the sess in my chest, gives me the strength to go on
Life's been short man I'm tryna 'void cort, wanna break me down but I'm too strong
I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Something on my wrist the only way I'm doing time
I eat grilled fish with grino piszo wine
Sitting in a new v with the seats reclines
Smoke weed everyday just to ease my mind
Tryna live the good life, cos I ain't tryna do time, and I'm

[Hook] x2
Why's my niggas always yelling out broke shit
Let's get money cos now you wanna smoke shit
Chill dawg, naa nigga get money
Get on your grind, ain't a damn thing funny

[Verse 2]
I won't change for money, money change for me
Niggas all broke, wanna plot on me
Cos I'm in the hood, no rocks on me
Smartest nigga they know without a G.E.D
Used to hustle all night, going half on hogees
Me and my nigga going half on Oz's
Now I ride around in a thing with no lease
With rich white niggas, still fuck with parole lease
Outta Detroit like Alan Houston, I been NY but I ain't no bum
I'm from where motherfuckers is shooting, I used to cut up and save the crumbs
See it ain't where you from, it's where you at
The perception of my city, I'm a straight and a fax
Browntown motherfucker, yeah I'm taking it back
And do anybody got a fucking problem with that?

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
But the weed in the bag right then get money
Prims on that new shit, then you get honey
When niggas start hating, then you get funny
Cos when ribs was showing, they didn't feel tummy
See, you gotta do what you gotta do
And they gotta do what they gotta do
See, you ain't concerned with me, I ain't concerned with you
You don't give a fuck, then nigga, fuck you
I don't need you, you don't need me
I don't fuck with you, you don't fuck with me
I help feed niggas who help feed me
Show love on GP, now I gotta please me
If it all end today, I still be pleased
Smoke weed, drink liquor just to get a release
The way shit going it'll never be peace
Tryna keep a piece mind so I keep my piece

[Hook] x2
