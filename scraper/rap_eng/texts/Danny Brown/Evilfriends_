[Verse: Danny Brown]
You ain't got nothin' on me
You ain't got nothin' on me
Hell no we ain't homies
Smoke that kush all by my lonely
I can't trust none of these niggas
All for self my nigga go figure
If you ain't 'bout them figures
Then no I can't get whitcha'
But you ain't get your issue
Magazine in that pistol
On another page and you trippin'
Oh, you might get the subscription
That's what I stay to myself
Everyone they care for theyself
If you ain't helpin' my wealth
Then it's best that you just step
I just smoke and drink til I pass out
Everybody want a hand out
Got bands on me no cashing out
Stay low key like a stash house
Driving around with them racks out
Make your girlfriend tap out
With her back out till she blacked out
Now she coming back like a crack house
I could never be your friend
No way that I could pretend
I keep it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and that's how it is
I could never be your friend
No way that I could pretend
I keep it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and that's how it is

Then no I can't get whitcha'
But you ain't gettin' salvation
Magazine and that pistol
And another way that you trippin'
You ain't gettin' subscriptions
That's what I stay to myself
