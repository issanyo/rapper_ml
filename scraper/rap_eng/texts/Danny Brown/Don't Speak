[Verse 1]
Don’t speak, put your ears on
I reinvigorated me with the fears gone
To each his own, bury bones in the Tetons
The skeleton in my closet is gone thanks to spring cleaning

I smell home every time there’s a sprinkling
Rain on the asphalt, triggering an inkling of what’s to come
I hit the ferry soon as summer come, they’ll recognize phenomenon
Haters turned to sucker, son, like dum dums

They turning backs to me and acting like they running from
Weak-seeking tommy gun heat will melt them off like butter
Brasco the undercutter, undertaker, and mortician
Talk like I’m hardcore and more listen

But, characters welcome we’re just playing a game
The voices in my head are saying the same
They say I’m insane. Claim what I’m saying’s inane
Call me crazy but what’s in a name, Shakespeare?
Nothing

[Hook}
Tell me where you’re going if it’s with me
Tell me who you’re listening to if it is me
Tell me what you’re thinking about, cause I can’t see
If I ain’t the one on your mind, then just don’t speak

[Verse 2]
And don’t speak if you lie much. If you are
Conspiring deceit, keep your mouth shut. Keep away from me
Or run the risk of getting fouled up mentally
A century of wisdom coming from a decade doubled up

I hop and skip adversity like double dutch
Always on the up and up. Honestly, ill will and bad luck can suck a nut
That demon on your shoulder? I’m here to exorcise it
Watch eyes roll back like walmart prices

I am not afraid of death, Osiris
I’m afraid of growing old without ever knowing my Isis
When I’m alone, shit is borderline lifeless
But for now we can chalk it up to quarterlife crisis

But better that than a Johnny Truant death wish
I’ll blow down your leaf house and fell troy from a necklace
A somber face of mine is hiding in the locket
You can cast it aside or stash chain in chest pocket

[Hook]
