[Intro]:
I got some good shit to tell you tonight brothers and sisters

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Hotter than a BBQ at Satan's place, these bitches masturbatin' to my mixtape
I cum hard like seamen made cement leavin' feces trails on drum kits cause I'm the shit
Pissin' on your paragraph, parallel to ferris wheel
Make your bitch pussy a blowhole she doin' well
Jelling Harvard bitches skyping while they study, now I'm in their dorm rooms, ass fatter on person
Bustin' down rap bitches, bustin' down loosies
Now a nigga grown got [?] jacuzzis
Kelly Kapowski, spittin' Romanowskis, sniffin' coke in hotel rooms off the room key
Pent house suites, swisher sweets, [?] ice buckets, no towel under the door like fuck it
Luxurious living , plus this bitch is fucking, just play Danny Brown and two words will [?]
Heart colder than heel from a polar bear, shade bear snow storm walking up a glacier [?]
Now let me make myself clear cause you can't see me
You ain't fuckin' with me period, you menstruating ah
And ever since I walked out of them greens and out them county doors, I've been living the dream which is a
Penny in a nightmare, tryna get my nike-airs and spilling rice on my high-chair

[Hook: Black Milk]
So what we got right here? Stop right here
Block right here, you is what we not like
Catch him in the spotlight, yeah

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Now you all slaves to my [?] animal shit
Heart racing off the dopamine
Morphine metaphors make you do the shoulder lean
Smoked a young dro, this grandaddy with promethazine
Curing cotton mouth
Inside my head is a haunted house and
Every time I close my eyes another rapper make it out
Used to make-out with runaways in crack houses
Now I runaway from making-out with brick houses
It's as if I fucked every bitch I wanted to
My dick got enough smoke, you can catch a contact smoke
Reefer I roll up smelling like sneakers from a reacher
Aerobics class, hour straight no breathin'
Fresh like Easter, Thanksgiving eatin'
Smoking Christmas trees and these bitches trick or treatin'
I treat 'em like Halloween candy that's why your favorite rapper, favorite wrapper probably stand me

[Hook]
