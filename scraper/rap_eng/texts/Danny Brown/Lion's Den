[Verse 1]
Take a journey with me, to the city of the motor
Where no order got a struggle if you wanna make a quarter
See the pain in my eyes from the torture and the horror
Make me realise that insanity they force you
My patience is a virtue, I'm growing uneasy
In the city where you turn on the news you get queezy
My nigga like my brother, straight of another mother
Together we a' hustle just to get up out the gutter
Going half on an ounce was really all that counts
Was eating where we shit serving at our momma's house
Was both jugging down why them sergeants had to come
Went away for a year came back and I was done
Stared death in the face and I ain't blink once
I ain't going back to where I'm from
Said I will make it rappin', told me it would never happen
Might as well hit the block got a new passion
Now I'm playing in Europe on a sold out tour
Came a long way from razer blades chopping pure
Seeing better days and ain't never going back
Cos I used the game and ain't got caught up in the trap
And that's death

Daniel in the lion's den
Nobody knows will I make it out to fight again
Daniel in the lion's den
Nobody knows will I make it out to fight again

[Verse 2]
Hurts so good the pain never ends
I know I wanna quit, don't know where to begin
Talked with myself just need to stop
But when I'm at my low, that's when the high starts
Need a intervention, but it won't help
Maybe get a therapist but I talk to myself
That voice in my head said have another round
Couple lines of coke got me feeling right now
I might lose it all, I keep on down this road
Seen too many fall, but this is all I know
Whole family got high, I guess it's in my blood
That's when there's no love, you find it in the drug
It ain't what it was, it is what it is
We gotta break the cycle, a future for our kids
You see it half empty, I see it half full
Holla for the stars, every time a full moon

Daniel in the lion's den
Nobody knows will I make it out to fight again
Daniel in the lions den
Nobody knows will I make it out to fight again
