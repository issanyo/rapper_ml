[Intro]
She rubbing all on them titties, like my name was Biggie
But I don't know no Diddy, but got that Dirty Money with me
Got some Bobby and that Whitney, for Christina and Britney
She sipping then she get tipsy, then she drop it low and get get it
She with it, I'm with it, she with it, I'm with it
She with it, I'm with it, it's mine, she don't get it

[Verse 1]
Fuck all night when I'm on that E, shoulda popped 2 but tonight popped 3
Roll so hard can't feel my knees, 5 in the morning ain't think about sleep
Smoking on that papaya, got a white bitch looks like Mariah
Bet I make her hit that high note, when I put this dick up inside her
My outerwear be Moncler, Bonjour, out there
Insane with Balmain, bitch these jeans 'bout a stack a pair
Got Henny stains on Givenchy, bitch don't even tempt me
I will take you to my office, make you give me that Lewinsky
Ball so hard when I'm on them 'ralls
Bitch so freaky, suck a dick through the drawers
Halls in her mouth just to hum on the balls
After this night whore I won't even call
Up so high, I ain't never gone fall
Pissing on niggas got careers in the stall
Shitting on niggas, leaving streaks in your drawers
Take your top off like a toilet when it's clogged

[Hook]
They say I'm a menace, I meant it, I meant it
Be more than just a minute, this dick touch your appendix
I said that I'mma do it, so guess what bitch I did
These hoes know that I've done it, so now these bitches with it
She with it, I'm with it, she with it, I'm with it, she with it, I'm with it
She rubbing all on them titties like my name was Biggie
But I don't know no Diddy, I got that Dirty Money with me
Got some Bobby and that Whitney, for Christina and Brittney
She sippy then she get tipsy, then she drop it low and get get it
She with it, I'm with it, she with it, I'm with it, she with it, I'm with it

[Verse 2]
I go stupid, I be fooling, bitch, you see me, ho start drooling
Bitch you thirsty, acting foolish, Eazy on the E, cause I'm ruthless
Nigga with an attitude when I ain't zooted, roll a whole box up, let's get clueless
You wanna eat her while I fuck you? Waka-Waka, "Oh Let's Do It"
"Hard in the Paint," think I ain't? Double cup love, pouring up drank
Dirty cream soda, Swishers and doja, dipping that molly gotta nigga tore up
Give your monkey this banana, I make the camel toe trample
Got you dripping, wetting that bed up, when that pussy getting dismantled
I'm sucking all on them titties, you playing with this dick
You put them legs up on my shoulders, I'm spitting all on that clit
She say "Oh, you so nasty, oh Danny, you so nasty"
I'm slapping on that booty, left my hand print on ya ass cheek

[Outro]
They say I'mma menace, I meant it when I'm in it
Be more than just a minute, this dick touch yo appendix
I said that I'mma do it, so guess what bitch I did it
Them hoes know that I done it, so now them bitches wit it
