[Verse 1]
Rap Ralph Bashki
Smoking teriyaki
Verbal kamikaze
Axel at the roxy
In the men's room
With a groupie sniffing oxys
Getting sloppy toppy
Smelling like wasabi
You niggas mulianies
I swear they work with Johnny
Get locked
Get out and walk around
And act like that shit funny
You niggas from the era of finessing
That is bummy
I'm from the era, flip that
And you get that man his money
I think these niggas addict
They can't control their habits
Paying for these hoes
But tricks for silly rabbits
I'm more Black Sabbath
Not your average rapper rapping
Lamping up in Lanvin
Feeling like I'm a Buchannon
Ya hoes too demanding
My flows too outstanding
Lets me and you play a game
Of last man standing
Way above your standards
Nothing that you can imagine
Body in the clouds
And my mind's gone camping

[Hook]
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy

[Verse 2]
You can hate, you can hate
You get stitches from this brick up in your face
Every morning, every night, and every day
I think of shit to make you feel some type of way
My homie caught a murder case
And I seen 'em since
Just had a daughter
Baby mama need rent
It don't make no sense
So I don't add it up
So don't worry 'cause I got it
Nigga keep ya head up
Rap niggas brag about it
But ain't ever live it
I never try to glorify
I tell it how it is
You ain't ever copped a big
Broke it down in all nicks
Or a nigga in ya crib
Saying where is that shit
Think these niggas tripping
Gone camping
I see it clear as day
HD on a Samsung
Champion of critics
Give a fuck about ya gimmicks
They mimicking the streets
When I used to really live it

[Hook]
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
