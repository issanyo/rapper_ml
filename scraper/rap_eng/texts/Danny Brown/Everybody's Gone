[Verse 1: Danny Brown]

At the church listening to a eulogy
Sitting there feeling like this ain't nothing new to me
Hate funerals but I had to go
Pay respect to my little nigga named Low
Low got hit four times with the 4, about last week (?)
Now I'm in this church with these old dress clothes
Looking at his sister going crazy on the floor
Fighting back tears kind of wish I was with him
Jump in the casket like take me with him
Aunt sung a song made my eyes tear up
Palms got sweaty, nostrils flared up
Had to leave out I was feeling all crazy
Straight to the face had to blow a blunt of hazy
No choice but to hustle
Seems like every year a nigga lose a couple

[Hook: Danny Brown x2]

I look around and (everybody's gone)
I look around and (everybody's gone)
Say your RIP to the dearly departed
Say your RIP to the dearly departed
