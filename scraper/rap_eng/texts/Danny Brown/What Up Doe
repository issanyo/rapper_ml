[Verse 1]
My self esteem high like Pluto
Arrogant as fuck hoppin' out the Benz two-door
Up in the club confidence like a model
Smokin' on a swisher just copped me a bottle
Step to a bitch and she fronted on me
Pour alcohol on her like a scratched CD
Bitch I'm Brown who the fuck is you
Show her some green and the ho turn blue
Ignorant as fuck but I'm smarter than you
Sixes on the chevy, hustle harder than you
So immature but the rims so grown
Catch me in the club whilin' off the Patron
40 on me dog I don't never get searched
If a nigga trip then he might get murked
Better swallow your pride
Stomp a nigga at the bar, fuck going outside

[Hook]
What up doe dog I'm straight
Been gettin' money since 1998
I'm in the Chevy with a temporary plate
Sittin' on them sixes but I want 28's
Whattup doe dog I'm cool
You keep trippin' I'mma act a fuckin' fool
You keep talking I'mma pull that two
And show you how Detroit niggas do

[Verse 2]
Brown cuttin' up white like BoRics
Niggas wanna hustle but don't really know shit
Smoke green like I shot a Ninja Turtle
Matta fact popped Prince, way I smoke Purple
My basement sorta like Urkel
Take a half track bring back a whole circle
Hook flipped the nigga had me gone til November
Cause the way I mix like my wrist was a blender
More snow than December
Niggas rhymes soft like they notebook tender
Cold like Winter sippin' slushee in a igloo
Detroit nigga movin' work on a Mongoose
All retag regal
Drivin' no license like that shit legal
Fuck bitches like AIDS don't exist
I'm a young Ruthless nigga on some Eazy-E shit

[Hook]
