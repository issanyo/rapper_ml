[Hook]
Heavy chevy and you know that I'm rolling
Fiends on the block and they know that I'm holding
Keep it low key because the narks patrolling
But long as I'm flowing you know that I'm going (To the top)

[Verse 1]
Rather the be slow or faster
You're fucking with Detroit city street bruh ?
Tryna get money like my name is A-Rod
Unemployed slanging crack is my day job
Niggas feel Brown from Atlanta to ?
The nicest and the ?, in my city they hate hard
I wanna be set a cape y'all
Just cos you wack don't mean that I hate y'all
Gotta keep a heater cos you know it ain't safe y'all
Bout to lock the game like my name is save card
I want the whole damn plate y'all
Gotta keep it real, it ain't no need to play y'all
It ain't no need to play dawg
And niggas want drama, it's whatever you say dawg
It ain't no need to hate dawg
Just get up on your grind and get a piece of the plate, dawg
Weigh it up stash the stacks in the safe dawg
And keep a tight crew cos you know they fake dawg
