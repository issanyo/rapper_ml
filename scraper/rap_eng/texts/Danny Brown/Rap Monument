[Ad-lib]

[Verse 1]
That ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like wheat thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that butt
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my garage
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key

[Bridge]
Bitch we great x2
Fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up x2
We gotta have it
We gotta get it, x2
We gonna take it
Bitch we jump x2
We gotta make
Go

[Verse 2]
Couple racks on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with
