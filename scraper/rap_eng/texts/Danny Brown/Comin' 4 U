[Intro]
Ha ha
Ha ha, mothafucker
Back on that ass, come on Mr. Postman

Bitch, it’s the Rese’vor Dogs, nigga you ain’t know?
Got your fuckin’ address right here
This is serious, holla at the nigga Danny Brown

[Danny Brown]
Oh, Danny’s back on his proceedings
Serving these black [?], swervin' and ‘lac breezin’
Hurting these cats breathin’, for no reason
I throw G’s at any party I [?] in
Get your weight up, not your hate up
Danny ain’t a grocer, but he bag the eighth up
So hot I order extra clips
Got black suits comin’ and they game Will Smith
So don’t slip if I’m with the tech
Cause I turn your white tee to white fishnet
Niggas, get ready for war
Killed three the last week and I’m ready for four
Throw a bullet in the game just to settle the score
So hood and that white thing, peddle to the floor
The metal is full, niggas try to stop the Rolex
Put two in you, leave you bloody like a Kotex

[Hook] x2
One, two, niggas comin for you
Three, four, get the fuck on the floor
Five, six, nigga give me those bricks
Seven, eight, man give me all that weight man

I always been good with math and dollars
Twenty plus three is what I’d like to have four of on a 96 Impala
Watching [?] on the TV for the driver
Back seat X-Box, strippers wanna holla
Me, I’m a dog, just call me a rottweiler
Bumpin' the clips with a clip in my coat liner
Docs holdin’ shotgun, believe me dog it’s more than a cliche
Boons really got a gun
Catch you on the street corner, come up out your funds
You’re short, call the kidnappers, come up out your sun
I run with some ride or die, instead I stand in front of the club
And pass shells like they was flyers
But doe, I come up out the bush and surprise you
Like it was your birthday, you sling on the dirt [?]
I don’t act on my own, I go where the work say
And I touch so much green, you think it was Earth Day

[Hook] x2

I’m killin’ any nigga hotter than me
Have bullets spin around his head like it was his 360s
Catch me zoomin’ in the whip so swiftly
Fuck all you niggas, suck my dick, come and get me
When I fight, I get help with that
I do it old school, niggas catch a pipe or jack
You must think I’m just writin’ raps
Till your mom yelling, "God I want my baby back”
The boy flows is banana scrap
No more, standing up straight when the hammer brap
And the pump go off, you know what’s next
Niggas shake and disappear like an Etch a Sketch
Niggas better start showin’ respect
Before the diesel eagle help your heart jump out your chest
And that way you can show your feelings
Play Craig Davis, let the [?] fill you in

[Hook] x2
