[Verse 1]
Laying here eyes wide television lights up the room
Like the moon in the nighttime, minds on another daytime
Probably have that same thought until the next sun shine
Watching time while I'm watching infomercials
Nothing else is on so I'm rolling up the purple
Hope it takes me straight to dreams 'cause all I seem to have is nightmares
Waking up in cold sweat punching on the nightstand
Wish i could wake in a puddle of my drool
But when i fall asleep i see myself in a pool of blood
And whats fucked up is if ain't that, the sounds of gunshots are waking me up
Is it paranoia? tell me how? blocks so foul that a nigga getting shot right now
So I roll with the chrone, put 'em where Michael Jackson and say you are not alone
And I can't really call it, when you wanna take a shit and roaches crawling up out your toilet
When you looking out the window, it's snowing in august
If you rolling with the circle always looking like a target
So I'm always DOLO, call me anti-social
Unless it bisexual bitches that's bicoastal
Call me what you want, call me a motherfucker
'cause i do it for the kids here because of broke rubbers
Know its so hard, playing in the D you see nut dripping out of condoms hanging off of monkey bars
Nowhere to go, and outside sounds like the Saving Private Ryan first scene audio
Yeah you hear the sirens, hear the shots echo
Soundtrack the violence when you open up your window
From where you can't blink and all the madness in the street won't let me get a wink

[Chorus]
Please just let me sleep
'cause the sounds on the streets won't let me get a peep
So i fall deep, but not falling six feet deep, so underneath the bed sheets where I keep the heat
Streets won't let me chill
Every morning I'm awake, gotta pop another pill
So hard to deal, living with this stress
Pressure won't let me rest

[Verse 2]
I'm just trying to catch the last letter in the alphabet
And what's outside might get a niggas numbers
Ain't gotta be summer in D, we got heat
Zero below got shit to melt your teeth
Body want to sleep but the mind's not ready yet
Thoughts tortured like a Vietnam vet
All the horror i endured during my adolescent
Got me dependent on these anti-depressant
From the highest rate of crime
Niggas talk murder but they wouldn't kill time
It sound good in your rhyme
'till your sitting in that car in that funeral line
And theres tears in your eyes, wearing all black
Can't do shit, so hard to fight back
'Cause you know your niggas ghosts
And I'mma sleep and still be having dreams about my nigga Louis
Telling me to stay cold, then I await to blood running up out my stuffy nose
And it be so cold, that I be sweating, so much that it always have my braids wet
