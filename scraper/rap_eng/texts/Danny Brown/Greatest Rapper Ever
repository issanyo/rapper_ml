[Verse 1]
My homie's a magician with the Tec
Make your chain disappear and reappear on his neck
I ain't tricking with you hoes, but shit don't ask him
Only thing I give a bitch? A fucking orgasm
I'll throw you in the river, hands tied tight
Watch your ass drown, feel it in the air tonight
I'm spitting that dope shit, smoking on regulars
Writing 16's like internet child predators
Rocking that 10 Deep, but I stay dolo
You wearing polo, who are you, Young Dro?
I'm fifth floor at the Bellagio
Vegas bitches that's resembling Rosario
Dawson, awesome, hit the head, Mario
Sorry yo, my tongue long, she squirted off the sheets
She gave me that Becky, I gave her that yoshi
The only time you niggas touch keys is Motif

[Verse 2]
Go and sell a beat, you never sold a rock
Still be sitting on the couch if I was signed to Koch
Coulda signed to the Roc, nah, I'm signed to the streets
The D is the only thing that's profiting for me
Feeling like Big Meech, when we're 'bout to cook up
But not the one from B.M.F. dog, the one from Lynwood
It ain't a nigga I know
Three years straight, three dollar blows
Good any hood, anywhere I go I'm straight
Nigga hit me with a hundred cause the look on my face
Momma, I'm honored to be your son
Could snatch a stack of stamps out and not rip a single one

[Verse 3]
Used to be in a rush, to finish off my sack
I was so thirsty dog, sold a pregnant bitch crack
Let her pay me extra, smoke it in the back, then she came back
Titties out smacking herself on the back, talking 'bout
Something crawling on her, looking like the world's falling on her
And I pushed it, you rub the foots of the bitches I mushed
Funky ass cutlass three deep, blowing kush, North got her shook
Started reading when the judge threw the fucking book
But the block was off the hook, said "Fuck class!"
Off them same pills that had Carlton dancing fast
Young buck, look, now a grown up
Now I pop them same pills, listening to Donuts
I rap like I bet my life
Cause in all actuality, nigga I did
You rap like you used to hit the pipe
Nah nigga that ain't crack, that's crackhead shit
Rep that shit, will tell a bitch
You wouldn't break a brick, you ain't seeing this dick
You trick on the bitch, dog you ain't rich
Take a bitch to the movies, take her to the crib

[Outro]
You seeing Brown? Nope, never
'bout to live the title of the greatest rapper ever
It don't get no better, it don't get no better
