[Verse 1]
Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai
Kick it like Muay Thai, flow like Sci-Fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch is my target when I shoot my load
Bulls-eye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke somethin' with your man, bitch
Like Wyclef used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffin' Adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Trippin' off the shit that had Brian Wilson flippin'
Experiment so much it's a miracle I'm livin'

[Chorus]
And I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy, spike that wit hsome molly
Tell mommy, I'm sorry, God bless my soul
But life was so sublime, goin' out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mind-frame
Feelin' like Keith Moon, shrooms in my dressin' room
Basquiat freestyle
Feelin' like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole's mouth
River Phoenix '93 VIP
With some drugged up porn hoes all around me
Like Teri Diver, Linda Wong
All in hell havin' orgies where the horns growin' long
'Cause, bitch, I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger
Hyped up in a jacuzzi doing that John Belushi
With Brittany Murphy, we blowin' hershey
I'ma die like a rockstar
