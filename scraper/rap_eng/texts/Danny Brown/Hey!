[Verse 1]
Sunshine
Detroit City
Nothin' like the summer time, bitches showin' tittes
Pedicure, toes out, ass cheek peaking
Walkin' with they nose high, doesn't stop me from speaking like
I'm glad to meet you, My name is Danny, I'm a clitoris pleaser
My voice sound better outta cellphone speaker
Give me your number, I will call you this weekend

[Chorus]
Walkin' down the street, I don't care if you got a man
Imma just grab your hand and be like (hey)
Could be standing at bus stop, fake gold red poppin
If you lookin' hot, I'm like (hey)
And I'm checking ID's, girl you won't R.Kelly me
So if you under 18, I'm like (hey)
And the ancients of the dance, let me pull up my pants
Put my hands in the air and be like (Hey)

[Verse 2]
And get my 1-2 step on at the barbecue
Get drunker than your mother or your nephew
But scared of her potato salad, Imma doggie bag it
Open pear addict, got me licking on my fingers like that crack addict
And I'm gonna cheese her
All the blunts and purple got my stomach doing circles
Gettin' wild on [?] corona case and sunset yoga of patrone
Take the kids to giant slide yet

[Chorus]
Walkin' down the street, I don't care if you got a man
Imma just grab your hand and be like (hey)
Could be standing at bus stop, fake gold red poppin
If you lookin' hot, I'm like (hey)
And I'm checking ID's, girl you won't R.Kelly me
So if you under 18, I'm like (hey)
And the ancients of the dance, let me pull up my pants
Put my hands in the air and be like (Hey)

Yeah
And put my hands in the air and be like (hey)
Yeah
I put my hands in the air and be like (hey)
Yeah x2
Uh
Yuh

[Verse 3]
This bitch walkin' past, she got a fat ass
That motherfucka perfect, she'll be framed in a glass
I ain't got a lot, she know that she the truth
If our eyes don't meet, I'm like (hey you!)

[Chorus]
Walkin' down the street, I don't care if you got a man
Imma just grab your hand and be like (hey)
Could be standing at bus stop, fake gold red poppin
If you lookin' hot, I'm like (hey)
And I'm checking ID's, girl you won't R.Kelly me
So if you under 18, I'm like (hey)
And the ancients of the dance, let me pull up my pants
Put my hands in the air and be like (Hey)
