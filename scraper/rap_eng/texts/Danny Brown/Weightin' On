[Hook – Danny Brown]
Tell me what you waiting on
Tell me what you waiting on
Rolling up strong, blowing one straight to the dome
Gone, off the zone I’m blown
Nigga I’m gone
Smoke so much I’m gone, smoke so much I’m gone
Nigga what you on?
Got your ho for the dough
Tell me what you waiting for
Tell me what you waiting for, and you already know
Tell me what you waiting for
Tell me what you waiting for, we about that dough
Tell me what you waiting for
Tell me what you waiting for, we about that dough
Tell me what you waiting for
Tell me what you waiting for, we about that dough
Tell me what you waiting for
Tell me what you waiting for, we about that dough

[Verse 1 – Lucki Eck$]
Tell me what they waiting for, they tell me what they waiting for
We already served, so tell me what you waiting for
And tell me what you waiting for
I get this shit real, so you know what they baiting for
Yeah you know what they baiting for
Got all this shit covered, so you know what they rating for
You know what they rating for
And I be like Game, still on that stain shit
Goon squad, still with that same shit
Raising hell, still on that Kane shit
Bet a ho go on and take shit
Want a deal of that Mary Kate shit
The OF, meet me by the lake there
Crooked ass niggas, I’m straight business
So however he rolls, I break shit

[Bridge – Lucki Eck$]
You know you want it, I got it, along with all of my niggas
[?], and action, along with all of my figures
You say you want it, I got it, along with all of my niggas
[?], and action, along with all of my figures

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2 – Lucki Ek$]
Right so niggas want to be like bosses
And niggas want to be like Voss
Ain’t tryna hear a fuck nigga preach
They tryna rip a nigga off like golfing
Ain’t shit in this motherfucker free
So I'm a badass like Steve Austin
And if you got beef, nigga what’s the deal?
Cause I’d be the first one to throw an offer
And I’m riding my niggas like the summer
In Chicago we digging like the winter
And these fool ass niggas be punting
Know it’s 2 5 ‘fore they have to kick it
And I still travel with my old dogs
Yeah we still on this shit with that menace
But mark this shit like a tag
Better keep that motherfucker trending

[Hook]
