[Verse 1]
Hide the sun
I will leave your face out of my mind
You should save your eyes
A thousand voices howling in my head

[Verse 2]
Speak in tongues
I don't even recognize your face
Mirror on the wall
Tell me all the ways to stay away

[Chorus 1]
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
And stay away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Let's go somewhere private and talk open-minded
Though my speech slurred and my sight's all blinded
Vision all blurred, can't hear a word what I say
Body saying different, mind saying can't stay away
Out of body experience, I'm just tryna experiment
And be on something with you like Egyptians with the pyramids
Serious, mind gone all delirious
Stare right in the mirror not even no one was feelin it
I think I might got 'em addicted
Tryna kick it cause emotions are evicted
Body say you're missing, but your thoughts contradicts it
I think that you should listen cause you know that I could fix it
Heart wait a minute, but your mind saying different
No way you got time to play so
If your first thought, I agree you should obey
I think it's safe to say you should just stay away (stay away)

[Chorus 2]
Stay
Hey hey hey ah
Away hey ah
Away hey ah
And stay
Hey hey hey ah
Away hey ah
Away hey ah
(x2)

[Background]
I'm hearing voices all the time and they're not mine
I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind
I'm hearing voices all the time and they're not mine
I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind

[Outro]
Black out days
I don't recognize you anymore
