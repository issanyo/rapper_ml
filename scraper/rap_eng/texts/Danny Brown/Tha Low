[Hook: Slayter & DonMonique]
Got it for the low,  keep it on the hush, nigga
Get it on the low, keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the shh
And then I then I sell it for the high, cause I don't fuck with no fuck niggas
Got it for the low,  keep it on the hush, nigga
Get it on the low, keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the shh
And then I then I sell it for the high, cause I don't fuck with no fuck niggas

[Verse 1: DonMonique]
Keep it on the hush, keep it on the low
I don't serve no more, bookin' shows off the flows
Gettin' dirty looks when I roll with crooks
But little do they know that we murderin' hooks
It's a lotta, my trap stay hotter
Swervin' in the ride, pullin' up to the Ramada
Young Don Juan and the D is for disgusted
I heard you got the loud, but I don't trust it, you busted
Dope game easy, but these clowns is greasy
If you do it how I do it then you best believe me
Don and Dan, bitch I took ya man
But you still showin' love, cause I know you a fan
Yeah I blessed you, but you testin' ya luck
Got grams for ya mans, is you buyin' or what?
Got bands off demand from supplyin' the clucks
You tryna see how much work fit in the trunk, so what's up?

[Hook: Slayter & DonMonique]
Got it for the low,  keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the shh
And then I then I sell it for the high, cause I don't fuck with no fuck niggas
Got it for the low,  keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the shh
And then I then I sell it for the high, cause I don't fuck with no fuck niggas

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Hong Kong Phooey on an Asian bitch coochie
Smokin' Scooby Doo, the Rubix Cube of the vocal booth
Traumatic youth, the reason why I torture you
Remember when I was thirsty couldn't even afford the orange juice
Before the order sell, make sure the balance due
Challenge for these amateurs and OGs too
Nobody can save you, selfies with the angel
Now tell me, is Jesus' hair straight or with a tangle?
The labia Olympian, I'm legend, you're lesbian
Rollin' up the [?], bumpin' deadly in the Chevy
Petty adversaries ain't worth the commentary
Bury em alive somewhere in the Serengeti
Tryna fake perzazz, you wanna be [?]
Every morning I wake up askin' where your addy?
Ain't you ready? Then hit me up bro, bro
Ochos and polos, I got it for the low, low

[Hook: Slayter & DonMonique]
Got it for the low,  keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the shh
And then I then I sell it for the high, cause I don't fuck with no fuck niggas
Got it for the low,  keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the hush, nigga
Keep it on the low, keep it on the shh
And then I then I sell it for the high, cause I don't fuck with no fuck niggas

[Verse 3: Slayter]
Pussy, she poppin' yeah
I can fuck ya bitch and make her popular
I'mma have her singin' like the Opera
You know we be movin' like the Mafia, man
I feed all my bitches Xans
After the show, I fuck fans
I got 'em all linin' up in the back of the venue
They know what it is in advance, nigga
