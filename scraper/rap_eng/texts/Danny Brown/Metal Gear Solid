[Verse 1]
This rap's like Metal Gear Solid, chrome stay polished
White spots like on Rasheed Wallace
Any nigga think they frolic, this is not a promise
Bust a nigga in the head like Vonage
I smoke chronic, like a stressed rasta
You are not gangsta, you are an impostor
Kick it like Henry, this is not soccer
Spit it so vivid, Brown songs like opera
Fat lady singing, serenading you
Mask like the phantom, mothafucka, I will stab you
Ever seen a nigga with nothing to lose?
Desert Eagle cocked and it's aimed at you
Temper running short, cause his daughter missing meals
Running low on options gotta get it with the steel
Niggas got pills, but we ain't Morpheus
Posted in the hood, 40 on the porch with us
Nigga what's good? What you don't know?
Get your free tickets to tonight's murder show
So if you want to come through holla at me
Get your VIP RSVP, nigga, Metal Gear Solid

[Verse 2]
This raps like Metal Gear Solid, nigga, I'm Snake
I detect bitch nigga in your blood trait
Nigga you are dog-bait, show you how a slug taste
Little cockroaches get hit with the bug spray
Sorta like Subway, nigga losing weight
Front his ass to work, now you asking where we stay
Give his ass the pump like 10 on 8
Now we leave with pieces like birthday cake
You are not straight, nigga, you are gay
My hair long like Rappin' 4-Tay
Your bitch wanna braid it, say she got skills
But she's just fishing, want me to fill her gills
Nigga I'mma chill, I ain't really stunting you
Meat on her grill, just like a barbecue
Better call a audible, switch up your plays
That shit you running get you Blitz 2K
I throw bullets right in the flesh
If you intercept, you got shot
Hit you with some shit that you ain't coming back from
Brown tight like six niggas in a Maxima
40 count I see 'em holding drunk calcium
Cause your bones ain't breaking we cracking 'em
White sheets wrapping 'em
It's over it's a wrap for 'em, a rap for 'em
