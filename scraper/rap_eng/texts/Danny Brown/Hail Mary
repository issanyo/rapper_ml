[Verse 1 - K.Flay]

Maybe I'd be sicker if I had a higher bidder
And a wad of cash thicker than the fucking big dipper
Like to get big quicker, swig sipper I’m illiterately littering
The track, brain dead spitter
Told a joke cause my life's one too
Anybody know where I might buy glue?
Kinda bummed all my fun shit broke
My heart, my spirit, my art, my toes

Had enough to drink but I want a tiny shot
Of a little bit liquor to be washing out my thoughts
Yeah I'm hanging with the haves but I'm half have not
On an air mattress in a Flagstaff rat box
That’s code for a motel 6 see I know some tricks and a potent mix is a
Loaded clip full of twisted love and a dose of loneliness

It’s a bogus land, I got no demands just a croque madam in my open hand
Evil men gonna bleed me out gonna cut me down gonna vote for them
Fuck a lemon yeah I’m sucking on a glowstick
Only trust a smile about as far as I can throw itt

[Hook]
Don’t don’t don’t let me cry
I’m not a sinner
Don’t make me testify
I can’t remember anything
Hail Mary tell her that I wanna go back
Hail Mary tell her that I wanna go back

[Verse 2 - Danny Brown]

Can somebody help me while I'm looking in a mirror
Splashing water in my face 'cause I drank too much liquor
And I'm still not done, putting smoke in my lungs
Paint dot on my nose, put a dot to my tongue
Can't go on until I get off
Everything hurts and you get a lil' soft
Can't feel my face and I really don't care
We about to party in here
(?), drank too much rum
Too much fun, rub it all on your gums
But I never learned my lesson, always stressing
Making out with a slut, taking out aggression
Teach him where the drugs at, time to get witit
Can't take life living in a dirty basement
So I'm on molly, (?)
(?), keys do, steal that (?)
Ain't no bitches, probably gon' get it
Ain't no (?) , tell me that she witit
Me and K.Flay gonna party any way
So please Hail Mary, save us from grace
Ain't no bitches, tell me that she witit
Ain't no way, bout to gon' get it
Me and K.Flay gonna party any way
So please Hail Mary, save us from grace

[Hook - K.Flay]
Don’t don’t don’t let me cry
I’m not a sinner
Don’t make me testify
I can’t remember anything
Hail Mary tell her that I wanna go back
Hail Mary tell her that I wanna go back

[Bridge - K.Flay]
What they sell is a pocket full on sunshine, sunshine
Face gone numb won't you sock it to me one time
What they got is a secret in a coke can, coke can
Feed you dinner just to watch as you're choking, choking

[Hook - K.Flay]
Don’t don’t don’t let me cry
I’m not a sinner
Don’t make me testify
I can’t remember anything
Hail Mary tell her that I wanna go back
Hail Mary tell her that I wanna go back
