[Intro]
Danger, D..Danger, Detroit stand up, danger, uh

[Verse]
Nigga listen, they all some hoes
They ain’t packing and they ain’t even searching at the door
It’s Danny Brown, ya’ll motherfuckers know
Pop your punk ass for acting like the crow
I hear you talking but seeing no action
I’ll make you see words similar to closed caption
Hustle for year, from selling rocks to blows
Ashy Larry niggas fall off on their first roll
No codes and I play no expert
Your songs suck, kill ya’ll with excerpts
I’m so hot like turtle necks with sweatshirts
Bitch on my dick, love the way her neck jerk
Niggas only hard when they get drunk
Rappin' version of the Alvin and the Chipmunks
Keep talking, you must want your shit lumped
If my ass got whooped then I got jumped
Never worry, keep the 4-5th and always in shit like Jersey’s mayor [?]
Kick it like Freddy Adoo in the womb
Stay in bitches heads like Vidal Sassoon
