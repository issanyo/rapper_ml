[Intro]
My nigga got parole from the pen
Told me if a nigga test he will do it again
Baby momma shitted on him, started fucking with his friends
Took his son out the D, he won't see him again
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Mom made me smoke swisher with the incense
Sip a little bit, just to get a little bent
This nigga that he used to front work to
Came up and act like he ain't even know my dude
He feeling better, wanna smoke dude
Told my nigga "chill and just do what you supposed to"
Get a job like you 'posed to
Running round wild talking like he ain't 'posed to
Said he'd rather be in jail
Most these niggas pussies can't survive in the cell
Biggest downfall, he had a big mouth
Cos niggas hit him up in front of his mom's house
And that's real life drama
Now I feel bad when I look at his momma
Wish I could take it all back
But I wonder what he did to make it end like that

[Hook] x2
Like a boomerang
What you do come back, what you do come back
What you do come back, what you do come back
What you do come back, what you do come back

[Verse 2]
Hot summer day in the motor city
Posted in the hood, all of my niggas with me
Chevy trunk bang so much bass, no lyrics
Celebrate the day my man got turned to a spirit
Gan in the air, Henny in the kidney
Barbecue going, kid's throwing frisbees
Rim in the street, dice game going
Bitches with the short shorts, ass cheeks showing
Balloons in the air, rocking R.I.P. shirts
Baby mom got a tat to prove what he was worth
Sun shining feeling like a holiday
Til niggas pulled up let the whole damn block spray
And that's the end of every function
Due to all the stress, and the alcohol consumption
What goes around, comes around
In a system that's designed to keep a black man down

[Hook]
