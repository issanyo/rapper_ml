[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Like Adam in that garden, but instead I use the apple that I found to smoke my trees
When Eve come around, I ain't showin' no love
I'ma tell that ho on her knees
Snakes in the grass get pissed on
While I sip on crushed grapes
Gotta keep fate at the end of the day
Freezin' off white, Miley Cyrus in a snowstorm
Can’t feel my face, body numb, and my chest warm
Rolling acorns, lungs Akon
Liquor got my kidney like, "What's going on?"
Smoke so much, brain cell count low
Snort so much, might sniff my whole bank account
All day long, I roll that strong
Gas so loud gon’ wake the car alarm
Y'all bitch niggas been warned
I’m on my shit and the night still young
Dior Homme on
Pull up on ya ho like, “Bitch what we smokin' on?”
Then I roll the weed up
She suck me up spitting seeds not from the trees, bruh

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Fly shit!
These niggas want that fly shit!
Ayo, pistol-whip the nigga down the stairs at hall-of-fame
10-deep in front of Supreme, all for 'caine
Diamond Supply fly up off the triple beam
Drive by’s out of Bentley Trucks, you should see the wings
DA wanna give me an odd future
Shit I'm done with the hands but I’mma shoot ya
Flight Club, size 9 everything
Poppa pinked off and I’m on my gangsta lean
Last king surrounded by dirty ghetto kids
I’m undefeated, leave some shells in ya wig
Stash the yay in RVCA, ya wanna play?
Danced on the work like Morris Day
Ayo Lord, I had the vision
I got my niggas all out of prison
Take them niggas designer hoppin'
Cop anything you want, nigga, I got it
Money stacked to the ceiling
The nigga moved wrong so I killed him
Fly shit! These niggas want that fly shit!
