I shoot like Apollo
High like the balcony at the Apollo
I set trends, y'all just follow
Brown likes skydiving, put on your goggles
You little niggas study what I author
Arms too short, my reach like Tarver
Got butter like George Washington Carver
Got the mother of your baby in a ford nigga
The Air Max look like saucers
I used to chop rocks on a saucer
Get up in ya bitch stomach like ulcers
Now she always smiling at you, sittin in the truck
Now ain't that some ho ass shit
Like the third little piggy stacking up bricks
You the big bad wolf blowin on sticks
I'm a young cocky nigga can't tell me shit
Fuck with the white, call me interracial
Fifth like a pornstar giving niggas facials
Beat cases and never tell
Cause my niggas got cheese like Lambeau Field
? in a wife beater
Nights I used to sleep by a kerosene heater
Wishing I could get some Lil Caesar's
That’s why I rhyme tight like Scrooge Ebenezer
I’m leanin' like the Tower of Pisa
I steam ya' like the dry cleaners
Now you got a permanent press
Cause nigga touching Danny Brown like touching a ref
That’s like touching yourself
Cause nigga fucking Danny Brown like fucking yourself
Spent 900 on a Louie V belt
Lets talk prices, Leave niggas lifeless
Brown eat niggas like steak fries
Don’t get two piece like Popeye's
I’m just sitting in a Caddy
So hood, blow blunts with my baby mama’s new baby daddy
Rap like no one else can
When you hear Brown, no one else can
Watching like the other four Lakers on the court
And I’m number 24, ya’ll niggas hoes
Wanna see me locked up scrappin over dough
Cause I roll with white hoes with Manolos
?? (crunk shit?)
Fuck po-po
White and black jays look like the fucking Coke logo
Think it ain't when it is, you'll be standin on the corner selling Katydids (nigga)
Could put a lot up in you like an 80 gig
(High pitched laugh)
