Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone

[Verse 1]
Like Lieutenant Dan, I'm rolling
Back to back, I keep on smoking
Eyes keep shaking and I can't stay focused
I'm fucked if you niggas ain't noticed
I'm sweating, but I'm cold
Mouth all dry, but I got a runny nose
I just bought me a water bottle, chug that down
But I think I need me some more
And I keep feeling like I'm gon' faint
But fuck that, nigga, pass me that drank
I done drunk too much
I might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink
Bitch, I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doing

[Hook]
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Now all these rappers talking 'bout that molly
Bet a million dollars, these niggas ain't dipping
Pure MDMA, put it in a shot, we talking 'bout crystals
Been thizzing hard up all day
Rest in peace to Mac Dre
Throw up the T, scratch on my face
Do the Thizzle Dance up in the place
I'm grinding on your bitch
While I'm grinding on my teeth
Don't give a flying fuck
So right now you don't want beef
I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doing

[Hook]
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone

[Verse 3]
She licked it off my index
Before that she been wet
Now she licking on her best friend
While they suck me watching sunset
That's right bitch, we ain't done yet
Lifting up her sundress
It kicked in she licking
Before I blink, she undressed
Molly making her feel good
It's a feeling, she can't explain
But obvious, we got some problems
So bitch, let's kill that pain
I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party
And I don't know what I'm doing

[Hook]
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip
Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip
Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
