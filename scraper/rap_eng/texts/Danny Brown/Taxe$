[Verse: Danny Brown]
Money looks funny? Well, nigga, I ain't laughing
Take a swig out of this 40, and Imma start to smashing
Now what you make in a year, I give double that to taxes
So no way you're on my level, not even up in my bracket
I'm a motherfucking blocker, shoot a nigga, bla-ka-bla-ka
Turn into a pop locker if that chopper get to chopping
Now, hopping out a forest 'cause my ex-girlfriends, I saw 'em
'Cause every bitch on my dick, I might spit it with the palms
When [?] with a banger turn a nigga to a stranger
I'm a nigga looking different when they get hit with a banger
Smoke catching all day, your windows fall day
And if they want beef, this [?] all day

[Hook: Danny Brown]
I'm getting money, you don't see that shit every day
