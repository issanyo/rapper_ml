[Verse 1: Mr. Muthafuckin eXquire]
We slip and slide while we fuckin'
Cause my sheets is fully silk
I told her get up water my White Oleanders with some milk
White man's guilt is the black man's poison
That's why I'm always paranoid
Why I be hearing voices
Middle finger rigamortis
While they stuff me in my coffin
Porches flyin' saucers
Saucy scuffin' up my Jordans
Mushrooms, trippin' high
Talkin' to the Dolphins
Adderall, caused a cosmic shift in my endorphins
Flip quick with that thing
On my hip, I'm mighty morphin'
Y'all niggas all talk
No action like Zordon, (Rangers)
Thug outlaw immortal
Flyin' out a time portal
I ain't miss a whisper nigga
Now I'm comin' after all you
Frank Wright mixed with a twist of Lord Vordul
Started kickin' shit in the projects
Now I'm royal
Never save a ho
Like Popeye and Olive Oil
Never shit on a nigga
When he filled your stomach for you
Don't forget to fear me
I know y'all niggas scared
Pray that they ignore me
Pray they keep thinkin' I'm weird
Came to you in your sleep
And spoke death inside your ear
You ain't flinch, kept your eyes closed
And shed a single tear
Pussies don't have tongues
So pussies can't talk
Fuck that shit
DONT INCLUDE ME WITH NEW YORK
I rode up on a elephant
And slid down the trunk
Rose petals at my feet
That's a hell of a stunt, nigga

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Your ho is a no-go
That bitch fucked for Polo
Sucking on it like Rolo
Back 'em up in that four door
You fell off like row-row
She jump on it like pogo
All she want was a photo
Then I stuck it all in her chulo
She called me Papi Chulo
You lost boy like Rufio
Bitch, like, go in my 'cuzzi ho
Before I punch your ass in your coochie, ho
Genesis or Sussudio
You penis and booty, ho
On Venus in a studio
And that's out this world in that booth, ho
You smokin' on that panthro
Rambo, an example
For the Land Ro when I man, ho
With my dick all out my pants, ho
Got pussy smellin' like anchovies
Stomach lookin' all roly poly
Fucked that ho on a Friday night
Sunday, act like she don't know me
Spastic with this rhymin' shit
Caskets if you attackin' this
Turn ratchet with that ratchet
Smokin' on cactus with that ratchet bitch
No martian or no monster
No goon goblin, none of that shit
I rap batter, so fuck ?
And anybody in your motherfucking clique

[Verse 3 - Nacho Picasso]
Devil's dandruff, but I dabbled with that angel
No Buffy, doin' damage to my brain cells
I'm the leader
Gamma rays make my brain swell
Fuck your album sales
Tell me how that 'caine sells
The afro samurais
Tatted up like Allen Ive
I tore my heart out
And gave it to my valentine
And gave a line to that little bitch from Madeline
Bitches be them setup artists
Now I lay that pine with nines
Pop my piece like peels
I got a jagged spine
So I sound like Jack Burton
How I drag my lines
All the smokers in Seattle hella mad I rhyme
Cause we were servin' Fraggle Rock
Some Big Apple time
Hmm, I heard that city never sleeps
Well, my city always rains
And it's full of fucking creeps
Nominated Nacho P
To be the one that fuckin' speaks
Hella freaks, couple geeks
Then that OG Kush that reeks

[Verse 4 - Meech]
I bought the first mixtape
Won't help me escape poverty
So I did 'em six deep
Plottin' armed robbery
Should be in the Bahamas
Gettin' slobbed by Rihanna, G
Instead, I'm in the 'Bush
Hungry, plottin' to ? money
Motivate these crooks
This life is a tug-o-war
Just shook my sword over books
With that unbeheading arm
And this Gat, guarantee you fall
Like this dress on a ho
Hoes undressing it all
? on her dress and draw
Motherfucker, I'm raw

[Verse 5 - Erick Arc Elliot]
I'm trained to kill
My aim is real
? spills
I paid attention
Now I pays the bills
Mommy, I'm sorry
I can't protect my motives
Nobody told me different
Now I'm off the hinges
The doorway into my own existence
Spit it like retarded do
The impoverish genuine article
Spark your brain particles
While I proceed to startle you
Often, I get it on with you
Niggas, what is wrong with you
Bitches, don't carry bras with you
Zombies beat the remarkable

[Verse 6 - Juice]
Red herring, leave no clues
I'm that smooth
I'm that daring
Walk down your block in no shoes
Just one Glock, will not lose
Your actions are bitch moves 'gainst the pistol
Don't bite the head
I love it when she grab my balls
She slurpin' while I chill
Your style played out
Like this can of open beer
Wash it down with a thought
We the hottest
Fuck them niggas hatin' on New York
Zombie niggas food for thought
