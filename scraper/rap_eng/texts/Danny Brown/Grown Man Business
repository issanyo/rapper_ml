[Hook]

Watch what you say this is Grown Man Business
Call me Mr. WAE this is Grown Man Business
Get up out my face this is Grown Man Business
I’m a Grown man doing Grown Man Business
Money in the safe this is Grown Man Business
Call me Mr. WAE this is Grown Man Business
Get up out my face this is Grown Man Business
I’m a Grown man doing Grown Man Business

[Verse 1:]
The streets is cold, the block is hot
Stress alone got my stomach in knots
Best believe we running from cops
Niggas doing 3 to 9’s like they punching the clock
You heard Reasonable Doubt
"Whoever said illegal was the easy way out?"
When they hopping out of vans
Raiding niggas cribs like the Orkin man/ For extortion damn
They force your hand like Poker
I’m from Detroit where cats was buying roasters like Lee Iacocca
If you listen closer I’ll teach you economics
Lesson number 1: You got to have a product
Number 2: You better get it if you ain’t got it
Number 3: Don’t matter if you can’t make a profit
My knowledge—extensive
I’m a Grown Man doing Grown Man Business

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
From the depths of destruction, dishonor, dysfunction
Death daily on Dexter detectives did nothing
Took that same nothing turned it into something
For my next move, my vision, and my hustle
If God was once "Driving Miss Daisy"
I could make a million dollars in a day, see
Call me crazy maybe
But I’m a grown ass man and the ladies calling me baby
Every time you look up your boy got a hook up
I’m leaving niggas shook up, you better get your books up
My CPA got a CPA and I got a little homie with his MBA
My lawyers—expensive
I’m a Grown Man doing Grown Man Business

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
5’s turn to 10’s, 20’s turn to 50’s
And I’m ain't even talking bout’ the Benji’s
Dog you either with me or you against me
You trying to buy Bentleys? I’m trying to make history!
Make ends meet like the end of the street
Came six feet tall, left six feet deep
That’s how it is in the street, cause I’m trying to eat
While my money making money even when I sleep
