[Hook: Danny Brown]
I'm living where I know it ain't right
In the city of no street lights
And when you can't see but to fight
Lost in the city of no street lights
So dim up ahead
Blind in the city of no street lights
That's why we trapped in the dark
A spark in the city of no street lights

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
.5 rolled up in a swisher
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga?
Danny Brown the hybrid, old toothless ass nigga
But the bitches fucking with him cause they know he got charisma
Ride down Linwood, Brights on the headlights
Can't see shit cause there ain't no fucking street lights
? rolled passed, but they can't flick though
So fucking dark, scared he might have pistols
Dump on 'em, disappear, Nowhere to be found
On the news 'Cops killed on the West Side of town'
There's a war going on when the sun goes down
So on the battlefield keep your hard hat on
Cause out there are savages aiming at your cabbages
? in a wheelchair be considered radishes
Mama told me "Be home before the street lights on."
Nowadays they don't work, so the kid's never home and I'm gone!

[Hook]
I'm living where I know it ain't right
In the city of no street lights
And when you can't see but to fight
Lost in the city of no street lights
So dim up ahead
Blind in the city of no street lights
That's why they trapped in the dark
A spark in the city of no street lights

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Like the sign that says 'beer and wine'
Gas station niggas get slumped pumping on nine
I'm trapped in the dark, How the fuck I'm supposed to shine?
But it's got to come to light so I'm for sure gon' get mine
Got a heart full of grime, Mind full of hustle
They tried to keep a secret, Now it's out to the public
These other rappers jealous, Don't respond to BBM's
I'm too busy doing drugs and shining harder than them
They wanna throw ?, Stupid shit play
Smart nigga answers question to write on ???
My younger days, Used to be at Rosco Arcade
Caught the bus downtown before night switched to day
Cause I knew a nigga bite and try to try me for my Jordans
No hoeing nothing nigga, Just focus on importance
Mama told me "Be home before the street lights on."
Nowadays they don't work, so the kid's never home and I'm gone!
