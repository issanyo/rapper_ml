[Chorus]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, only me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, sexy me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, only me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, sexy me
Me, me, me, me

[Verse 1]
Hush now, I can, mother-tapper
Give you complete bliss
I got your "1, 1"
Look at my bottom, give it a kiss
I am so super, pupper, drupper
I am the front girl in round
I am so cool with my fashion pink lipstocl
Stacking body rolls down

[Pre-Chorus]
All the boys say "wow, wow"
Girls in the back, same: "wow, wow"
Enter the party, call me "dandy candy"
Cause I'm high, high
I am so super, pupper, drupper
I am the front girl in round
I am so cool with my awesome big tits
On the ground

[Chorus]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, only me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, sexy me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, only me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, sexy me

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, I pull up in lamba
I pull up in my Louboutin
I pull up, phone in my hand and
Ice on my bracelet and all I've got
I am so super, pupper, drupper
I am the front girl in round
I am so cool with my sexy bad hips
When I am walking down

[Pre-Chorus]
All the boys say "wow, wow"
Girls in the back, same: "wow, wow"
Enter the party, call me "dandy candy"
Cause I'm high, high
I am so super, pupper, drupper
I am the front girl in round
I am so cool with my awesome big tits
On the ground

[Chorus]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, only me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, sexy me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, only me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, sexy me

[Interlude]
And now we go bananas!

[Chorus]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, only me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, sexy me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, only me, me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Me, me, me, sexy me
