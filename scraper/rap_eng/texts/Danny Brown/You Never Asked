[Hook: Clare Maguire]
Why did you lead me on, boy?
You lied until the last
Why did you never tell me?
Why did you lead me, on boy?
You lied until the last
Why did you never tell me?

You never asked

[Verse 1: Rob Harvey & Clare Maguire]
Don't question the man's choice
Without knowing his story
I thought we were just chilling
But you got heavy and I really don't need this now
I showed my mates your last text
But we started with pictures
Now you're wanting commitments
But you got heavy and I really don't need this now

[Bridge: Rob Harvey]
You knew what you were getting into
Don't look at me that way
You knew what you were getting into, girl
Don't look at me that way

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I ain't tryna be your man
I just want to hit you up, hit it every now and then
As a matter of fact
I be looking at your friend
When I catch you on that late night
Spray it on her chin

[Verse 3: Mike Skinner]
All your life I gave you nothing
And still you ask for more

[Verse 4: Danny Brown]
For that pussy I'll be cope
And these words have never been spoke
But I thought you'd get that nosh
I just wanna keep it stroke

[Verse 5: Mike Skinner]
You love me more than you know me
It makes me treat you lowly
Don't look at me that way

[Verse 6: Danny Brown]
Just hit me up on that late night
Come through and I get you right
I ain't with the hype, turn off the light
Know you think you wrong, but it feel so right
When I'm on the road, you getting naked on Skype
Just playing them games, getting freaky tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Rob Harvey]
Don't question the man's choice
Without knowing his story
I thought we were just chilling
But you got heavy and I really donâ€™t need this now
I showed my mates your last text
But we started with pictures

Why did you never tell me?
