[Intro]
Meet the future face to face
It makes you feel like you're there in outer space
Beneath the seas

[Verse 1]
It's the Adderall Admiral, writing holy mackerel
Your bitch say my dick long like the strap on a satchel
I took me a capsule with no hassle
Now it's like I dip feathers of ink in a castle
A prodigy like bullets that hit your left clavicle
Melt sweat suits and paint the avenue
You have no clue like toy stores without board games
But when I paint pictures, I'm dipping brushes in war paint

[Verse 2]
I'm a mothafuckin' mothafucka
Fucking on your mother with two rubbers, I do fuck her
No cover just her booty on a pillow
Your bitch said my dick tastes like tropical fruit Skittles
I'm bumping Bill Withers, Swishers on Schwarzenegger
Matter fact, nah nigga, they on Boa Constrictors, they'll choke a nigga
These niggas ain't rappers, they mothafuckin' characters
Caught your baby momma horny then I stuck a carrot in her
Then you made a salad with her, ate it for dinner
I don't want that skinny bitch look like that ho from Thinner
Swore she played soccer, she was real good with headers
Had me yelling "Goal!" while I was sitting on the dresser
Give the bitch a hat trick, smoking on the cat piss
I keep the bitch wet, around you she's a cactus

[Verse 3]
I got them Penis Poems for your Vagina Monologues
Love a feminist bitch, oh, it get my dick hard
So no apologies for all the misogyny
I just want your company to come and watch some porn with me
My oral orchestration causes manipulation
The way these hoes be chasing though I had the tongue of Satan
But I just gave 'em dick to get more for conversation
Why you niggas tricking, giving your obligation
You safe havens, I'm Wes Craven with X cravings
Fuck a bitch mouth until her fucking face cave in
Hidden cams in her house, I caught her masturbating
Extorted her for the cash, now your ass paying
You Captain Save-'Em-ass nigga
I don't give a bitch shit but hard dick and liquor
So so nice to meet you, I hope that you safe
