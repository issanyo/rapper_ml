[Intro: Kiki Hitomi]

Freakshow x 4
You make me feel like a freakshow x 2

Verse 1: Danny Brown
Y'all be on that okie doke
Like Ali had a ropey dope
Y'all be blowin hokey poke
I'll be blowin' dopey dope
Y'all flow be Pinocchio
I sip Pinot Grigio
Had her on her knees mofo
Her she used to sing before
But I ain't ever seen a ho
Kick it like Ronaldinho
Pop a couple beans tho
Now it's time for freakshow
Strip, strip, big show
I love me a freaky ho
Take it in her booty ho
Record it on a camera ho
My draws in her panty trunk
I just popped a Xany bar
Now I'm feeling loopy fell asleep on the patio
Want to smoke the bag a' dope
Called up a coke ho
Told her if she late then she'll be scrapin' off this plate ho
Clothes from the day before
Smellin' like I don't know
Bout to [?] the rent on my downtown condo
Gone off the shit call my dealer, he here pronto
Nigga that's the drug sweat rollin' off the burger
Bitch I'm Rick James, ho
But I'm in Rick Owens tho
Still sellin' elbows
Yo bitch look like hell no
My bitch look like hell yes
Fingers in her sun dress
Now she wants to undress
Y'all niggas is processed
Y'all will never progress
All you do is regress
Play around like recess
Nigga I am the best
Puff, puff the seedless
Y'all smokin' distress
Bitch, it's Danny Brown and these other niggas rejects

[Hook]

I be off them addy addys
Y'all be lookin' mad at me
Still be wearin' baggy daddies
Yo bitch wanna grab at me
But she look so tacky tacky
Pussy smell like Krabby Patties
You a [?], AKA the baby daddy
