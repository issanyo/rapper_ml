[Verse 1]
.45 burned a hole in my hand
Barrel still smoking never letting of the thing
Nigga disrespect, get left with no brain
Outcome of tryna play Brown like a lame
Like a nigga get a fresh when he popping that heat
The future of a motherfucker hating on me
Black suits and caskets
Urns and ashes, black bags and plastic
Masking tape and DTs, running wild in the DET
OT with the work in the OV
Danny Brown known to pull an okey-dokey
Spinning niggas round just like a merry-go
With your baby mom 'bout to give felatio
So I understand why you niggas hating yo
.44 leave you holey like Jamaican clothes

[Verse 2]
On a mission for a cream colored GT
Old chevy 4 deep like the Beegees
All strapped keep it tucked by the pee pee
I ain't tryna be locked with a ??
All day got the work for the cheap price
Smoke swishers I don't fuck with a weed pipe
Motherfucker what it be like?
You the soft type, nigga I'm the G type
G stripes, very hood, good pass
Like a contest who can move the work fast
And I'm 2 year champion
Keep the sack and a Glock and a ?
Niggas softer than pancakes
Brown fuck with green nigga, like I landscape
Fuck the country, shine down like a lampshade
When this shit drop niggas going on rampage
