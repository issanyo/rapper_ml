[Intro]
You fruits get pints to stir up, bust your girlfriend cherry
Smoking on that grape and that be rolled up in strawberry
Niggas sour as that lemonade
When they see them hoes on my dick, they be like...

[Chorus]
Get the fuck up out of my mix
Get out my like Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get up out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get up out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get up out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get the fuck up out of my mix

[Verse 1]
Your hoe ate my dick off, call that hoe a cannibal
Coming down like Santa Claus
Her pussy furry like panda paws
Beat a pussy ass nigga with the jabber jaws
Talk about shit they weren't involved
Be like, "Get the fuck up out of my mix"
Nosy ass niggas always in my business
Wonder how I got it and wonder how I get it
Wonder where we keep it and they wonder where we spend it
Run up on me then we run up where you're living
Tell you one thing and you're back, nah forget it
Disrespect me then we come up where you're living
Worry 'bout me, better worry about yourself
Your family, your friends, be worried 'bout their health
See I'm tired of all of these pocket-watchers
Niggas watching my pockets
Wanna know where I spend it at, tryna figure out how I got it
Doing everything except working
Then you wonder why you're hurting
If you ain't got the assertion, better get up out and do something
See my best advice is just stop it, nigga
'Cause you ain't gon' do nothing
You a pop-lock-it and drop-it nigga, a bitch nigga be trouble
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it

[Chorus]
Get up out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get the fuck up out of my mix

[Refrain]
Drop a pack up in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it

[Verse 2]
I can't feel my face now, but I feel that bass now
Do a girl from the waist down
I'ma knock the boots like H-Town
Out there looking at me like Mase now
Touch and tease like Case now
Gone 'head, just break it down
Bring it back, come back around
Niggas talk worse than bitches
So out here gotta watch who you kick it with
Spread rumors, they textin'
Circle smaller than crouchin' midgets
Tell you one thing, girl, you better not forget it
Disrespect me then we coming where you living
Worry 'bout me, better worry about yourself
Family and friends, be worried 'bout their health
Tired of all of these pocket-watchers
Niggas always watching my pockets
Wanna know where I get it at, they wanna know how I got it
Everything except working
And you wonder why you're hurting
If you ain't got the assertion, better get up out and do something
See my best advice is just stop it, nigga
'Cause you ain't gon' do nothing
You a pop-lock-it and drop-it nigga, a bitch nigga, that's right
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
