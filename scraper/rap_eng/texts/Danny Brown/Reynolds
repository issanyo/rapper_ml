[Verse 1]
The last time I smoked, I think it was about a pound
I thought Lou laced my weed, I was about to pan 'em out
And he told me quietly, "Nigga, you was on the loud"
I was running 'round the room, Rocky tried sat me down
I went to club with, and I seen Busta Rhymes with the red neck
And he looking at me like, "Nigga, you sniffed a line?"
You heard this before, you probably would have lost your mind
But I had to change my lines cause TT didn't like my rhymes
Everybody always giving praise to the team
When all my niggas do is get fly and sip lean
Niggas think we're stupid, with all these designer things
We walk in Hilfigers office and hear that ching-ching
We get paid from Tommy the rest of y'all niggas silly
And walk in office meetings with camoflauge and a philly
And only get brain from the bitches that know the dealy
She rocked the mic and killed lipsync like Milly Vanilli

[Verse 2]
Being broke be the best thing that happened to me
It give me hunger pain, something strange happened to me
It fills my brain up with things so imaginary
Then I start to spit flames with vocabulary
My momma thought I wouldn't make it with this rapping shit
Lint in my pockets and I still ain't ask for shit
Dreams of traveling the world so lav-er-ish
Fuck a couple bitches that be fucking with them tab-a-lets
Lean sip' fabrics, you nigga is average
I'm about a mothafuckin' buck like Maverick
Fucking hoes in palaces, posing for the cameras
Fans scream, "Lord!" like a mothafuckin' catholic
Hoes tryna snap a pic, while a nigga tapping it
Bitches love my words, on stage they try to grab my dick
I'm the best when it comes to this rapping shit
I eat a nigga sleeping like bed bugs in mattresses
Still up in the hood with them stragglers
Fourty calibers if a nigga talking blasphemous
Young Trap Lord, I'm going back to Nazereth
Lean got me slurring like I got Ty Nast's lisp

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Excellent weekends are with kinky whores
Flow like meteor, your mediocre retard, put you in the ER
No CPR to bring you back, when I pull out this Eagle
Squeeze her like kegel, sitting in a Regal
Blaze a blunt of sour, now I'm higher than a seagull
Never ever pass unless you're on of my amigos
'bout to have a trio, call that shit a sequel
Me fucking these hoes, we listening to Beanie Sigel
Ain't no way you're equal, nigga why you hating?
It's over for 30 seconds like gang initiation
Put dots between 'em like abbreviation
Put his ass to sleep like sed-ed-ation
I done came up from dinner bowl and cereal
To bitches want the pipe like a house of payne video
So Ferginstine tell 'em get up on there grind
When that A$AP drop, bring it back home for Brown
