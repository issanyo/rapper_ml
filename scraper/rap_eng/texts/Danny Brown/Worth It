[Verse 1]
Check!
Smoke 'til I get a head rush
Looking at you rappers like breakfast
No apologies for what I'mma do to ya
I'mma take that game like I'm a sore loser
Homie, it's the bruiser, off that Don Shula
Have you running through your hood like Ferris Bueller
Make no mistake, I'm an ace when I face that bass
Really burnt when I'm on that snare
OK, oh yeah
I'mma go Randy Savage
While your mother kid play cabbage
Ain't no way you see me saut√©
And it's Motown lineup when I pull it on the pay
Erase or obey, we're starting to get a toothache
16s so sweet, gotta check for the Adam's apple
Dog, I'm on another chapter, different book
Read most of these rappers, they just care about they look
And they so like Zoolander, who guessed
Hoes stay clicking like a backup dancer
Homie, what's the answer?
Everything you do is in question
Doing anything for attention
Wait, did I mention
Gimmick might get you recognition?
You'll never be competition
Wait, did I mention
Gimmick might get you recognition?
But you'll never be competition, for real

[Hook]
Is it really worth it for fast cars and ice?
Do you wanna live that life?
Is it really worth it? New girls every night
Do you wanna live that life?
Is it really worth it?
Is it really worth it?

[Verse 2]
Machete in a haystack
Around these needles putting poison in your veins
What they be speaking putting poison in your brain
Swear to God, got me tripping, thinking on a different plane
Flow with a cosmo, popper stopper apostle
Kinda like I lasso hostile profile
You don't wanna get jacked so
Get hit up with that rocko
Ball so hard, when you land, leave a pothole
Ever since a snot-nose I've been about dough
Staring out the window, dreaming of a studio
Writing in my notepad, honing my craft
Base one on a full track, play it back, hell is that?
Representing me on mash

[Hook]
Is it really worth it for fast cars and ice?
Do you wanna live that life?
Is it really worth it? New girls every night
Do you wanna live that life?
Is it really worth it?
Is it really worth it?

[Outro]
(Who do you think you are, a big shot?) (Yeah)
Is it really-
