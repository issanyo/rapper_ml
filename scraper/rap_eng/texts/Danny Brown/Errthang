Fast life living got me smoking on that *sniff sniff sniff*
Things will never be the same, Bruiser be the clique I claim
Put that shit on
Errythang, put that shit on everything
Forty just to maintain, lucy rushing in my brain
Ain't got no dollar to my name, but put that shit on everything
Put that shit on everything. Put that shit on everything

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Put that on my momma, I swear to god, I put that on my great, great
Grand-momma
I put that on my squad, that I'm gone get it anytime
Rain, sleet, snow, or hail. I'm on my grind
Raise hell, we risk ???
Sky high heaven
Blow seven, kush rolled up periodically
You broke, you don't think logically
I had pounds of weed in 2003
So when you bought it then you probably copped from me
My lil nigga got 8 for a robbery
Smoke a couple blunts for his commissary
We all at home gettin wild already, so get zooted
Bout to pop me another pill, they say I need to chill
We do drugs for the thrill
I get so high, the ?? go low
When she pop, oh for sho
When she stop, I dont know
All on her jaw, some on her nose
Drip on shoes, some on her clothes
She’s a nasty dirty ho
Even let me put it in her booty hole
Oh, no, there she go
Run up on the corner like where you gonna go
He deep oh, no you ain’t no
Legs in the air had a ...hard time
Said she love me, put that on errthang

[Verse 2: Dopehead]
Mutant of Mayhem
I kill rappers, breakdance
Smile in your face, trying to shake hands
I break hands
Shoot your arms off
Dump your body in the wasteland
From Detroit city, they kill niggas over Space Jams
At the funeral, chill with the preacher
Amen
Took steps down from Ye's
They robbin off of Raybans
Bitches suckin dick for dollars
Chillin in the basement
Niggas jumpin fences as soon as they see them Ray Bans
Always wondered why niggas got mad when I made plans
Fuck rat bitches I spray they face with Raid cans
These local rap niggas don’t even got a game plan
I step in they stoop, turn
That bitch into gangland
I’m a bruiser bitch
Off that dumb shit
And I don’t trust these hoes
Fuck a dumb bitch
These niggas ain’t style
They on some some bum shit
I’ll knock your head off before you reach that trunk bitch

Things will never be the same, Bruiser be the clique I claim
