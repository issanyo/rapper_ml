[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
As the rim still spin
Bitches on my dick cause they know where I'm in
Said I was cute, but just too broke then
Catch me at the store with a Newport blowing
All the hoes start staring
Cutty same color as a dirty fish aquarium
And the seat's fruit punch
Cause I was selling bags when y'all was bringing bag lunch
Riding up Redwood, tryna catch a stunt
Drunk on bhang while I'm rolling up a blunt
Seen a nice thick bitch so I said, what up doe
Hopped right in, right front the corner store
Wanna get it popping but I told her just chill
Lemme roll another blunt while you pop another pill
Riding up the wood about to go to the crib
And I ain't even tripping cause she know where it is

[Hook]
Now we can just chill if you want to
Yea yea pop another pill if you want to
We can do whatever you won't do
See we can do whatever you won't do
See we can just chill if you want to
Yea yea pop another pill if you want to
We can do whatever you won't do
See we can do whatever you won't do

[Verse 2]
Now I came from nothing to something
Block done came back, but I'm still hustling
Wish I got money more sooner but
Fresh to death like I'm at my funeral
Took grits for the 26 inches
Pass when it was 4th and inches
Now they just fight for attention
See these niggas hating, but I ain't really tripping
Cause I'm doing my thing
And I got fresh green like Irish Spring
Chase holes in the flip flops of Ottie
With some pretty pink toes and them real nice bodies
These other niggas is pretend
So bitch quit playing and just hop in
Danny Brown keep gan by the pound
Bitch my name rings bells, I'm the talk of the town
