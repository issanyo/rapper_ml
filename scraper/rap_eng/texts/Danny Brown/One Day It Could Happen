[Verse 1]
The oldest of all kids, you can see my ribs
Hunger pains since the days of having stains on my bib
Used the same passion to put the 'caine on the strip
Used the same thirst when I put the bang in the whip
Whoever thought that I would make it with bars?
Used to give fiends ? just to borrow the car
I was just a teenager down on my luck
Thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
Only I'd have left mustard stains on my shirt
Kool-Aid and fuego helped clench my thirst
Used to live day-to-day and just wait on the first
Then I lost my first daughter then I seen my work
Had to take steps back, reconstruct my plan
Started rapping up verses, stopped rapping up grams
Flew out to NY, fucking with my mans
Now I'm in the Maybach not the back of the van

[Hook]
My momma used to tell me "Son, you're gonna make it, one day it'll happen"
Who knew I had what it takes to be famous and one day I'd be rapping
My poppa used to ask me "Son, are you prepared cos one day it could happen"
I dreamed about this day, but who could've believed that one day I'd be rapping

[Verse 2]
Back on public transportation
Waking up in the morning with mason
Momma in the kitchen cooking eggs and bacon
Granny gave her last to the preacher man praying
For her grandson to make a change
Constant fiends coming copping with loose change
Was going down the drain, until I hopped on the beat and unleashed my pain
I used to watch wrestling, Hex or Jim ?
Piledrive beats, Dan Brown been thugging
Whole life been broke, I'ma keep on hustling
Tryna stack up a mill, cop a crib for my cousin
But, everywhere you go people wanna hate
Saying that they ? but they plotting on your plate
Taught in the streets, I ain't have to graduate
And nigga, I'ma make it just awaiting my day

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
People look at my style, momma look at your child
They throw my jams on now, watch the crowd go wild
We done came a long way form copping on broadway
Letting the arms spray, I'd walk in in broad day
Now we entrepreneurs that's concurring tours
The only thing left now to do is sell out stores
But in the hood, I'm platinum, did good with rapping
Money is stacking, done with the slinging and jacking
Now I write and recite what goes on in my life
Remember being too scared to come home at night
Cos I would hate to see you and my father fight
Back then I was a little dude
That rock's skips to school and got ridiculed
Quit the flip and a hit a fool
And I know it's hard, we went through many changes
Tryna raise a son that spoke a different language
But had to change my ways cos I was living dangerous

[Hook]
