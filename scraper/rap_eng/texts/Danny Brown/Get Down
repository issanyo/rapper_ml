Detroit state of mind nigga
(Get-get-get down!)

[Verse 1]
Rappers intimidated, off the shit that I created
Hate it, debate it, you know I concentrate it
Penned like Donald Goines with a needle in his veins
Sitting at his typewriter, I'm that type of writer
Three houses left on the 10 house block
That's four abandoned houses and three empty lots
Nightfall look like Iraq
Arabs at the store, fronting words like they black
Keep the latest Nikes on my feet, swisher after swisher just so I can go to sleep
Wars outside, we stay in and play Live
A walk to the store could be the end of your life
Niggas be running through the block shooting
Time to stack up so we can move in on the outskirts of Houston
Niggas here like to rob, kickin' doors in for nothing
So watch where you go, 'cause you might get stuck-in
Caught offguard, niggas see ya, kick your ass in
You running like a cheetah from a masked assassin
Heard a few chicks scream, arm extends, squeeze again
We don't fuck with heaters that jam, for you this is the end
When I pop it, and that bullet exits the chamber
Surely ya'll confound me, conjecting your life's in danger
So in a hospital lobby, your family'll never be able to see as high as you see
So what you saying?
See the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas holding these triggers, bringing fame to their name
His crew should fuck it, neat rims for the summer
Bun some corn or, Ray-bans they run up on a 25's again; tins of AriZona
Bundles of rock, only job on the block
Snitches on the block
So don't serve 'til the motherfucking daylight stop
Because these base-heads, all they care about is a rock
And the nark will give them some just so they can go cop
I really need a vacation, so vacant, mind vacate a serious irritation
Compare my CDs to the face of the depths
Breathing starts fuming, he's noticing his breath
Laid back, reminisce the time
Nothing happen here, it's a Detroit state of mind
Detroit state of mind, Detroit state of mind

[Verse 2]
Been having dreams that I'm famous
On tours, fucking whores
Cash every day, eating good, staying full
Away from the block
Never ever thinking of selling rocks
Winning awards and getting props
Then I wake up
Thinking if I'm ever gon' take up
Stack enough loot, get my mum out the hood
I ain't walking round thinking shit is all good
Give me the right amount and I might sign with Shook
Thinking of bank rolls, gain, and chill spots
A little more stress and I just might pill-pop
And the DJs play Rese'vor, but we ain't paid
Dumb bitches get saved by niggas that's over-aged
