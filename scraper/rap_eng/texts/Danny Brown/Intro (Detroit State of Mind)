[DJ Travesty]

(Inhales smoke)
Yo what's good out there in the streets, it's your boy DJ Travesty
Holding my nigga D Brown down
My nigga locked up right now but you already know he in a Detroit state of mind right now
And we on that grind
So, sit back, light a blunt, pop a bottle, whatever
Whatever you do, sit back, get high, and listen to my man's Detroit state of mind
D Brown let's do it

[Danny Brown]

I could've sworn I seen the motherfucker in my cell, going through my personal [assets?]
His fingers, fingering my cigarettes
Came out like nothing was happening, whistling his tune
So I mushed his ass like move motherfucker make room!
Ay! Ain't that my cigarette hanging off the tip of your lip?
I ain't even give him a chance for his confession
Just leveled his ass with all that aggression
Lefts, rights, to the [dolex?]
Hahahaha!
Foots to the chest, uppercuts to the grill
I'm like, "Kill!"
He's like, "Chill!"
Take that! For.. for me even being in this place!
Take that! For that fucking C.O baton across my face
Feel that! For that lawyer who ain't give two fucks about me
And feel this! feel this! For me being enslaved by poverty... Motherfucker
Give me them damn cigarettes

Oh these is Marlboros, I don't smoke these
