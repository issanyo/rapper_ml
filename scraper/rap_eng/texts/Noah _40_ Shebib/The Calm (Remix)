[Verse 1: Cameron Uzoka]
Feeling all alone
The darkness is my home
Attitude of the pope fam I'll forever roam
With a cross look in my face in the confinement of my room
Still murdering tunes
Have a look at my shelf there's only pennies in my room
And rivers, meanders bloom
At the edge of destinies doom
So take a camera then zoom
To a flock of Christians who
Hold hands with the devil's groom
Remove the lens and then boom
The priest is a sinner too
Well its debatable
Huh, and everything is relatable
Would you rather be in church or in the trap selling crack
To a hungry white male, whose evidently derailed
Now he beats his insecurities
Into his young baby, uh young lady
Do you need rehab to babysit your baby?
Live to make a living or die to make a killing
Your choice, be decisive or death will hear noise
I know you can't trust them they're boys
I remember rolling with g's who overshadowed me like impending doom
Sending troops to distribute every ki
Oh baby let me be
Cause' even a tree knows when to leave, I'm not even saying
But Jesus delivered like Royal Mail
Yes I was a royal male
A crown made with thorns while toiling the soil stale
Memories of forgotten memories I inhale
But if I was in hell would you remember me?

[Hook: Iris]
I ain't tryna live no life if
I ain't gonna get it right
I don't wan' sell no weed
I just need to raise my baby
I'm a be a good father
When my little girl comes to me first
I don't need to risk my life
Trying to do something I don't like

[Verse 2: Cameron Uzoka]
Blue and red moons
Black and white grooms
Love hasn't got a colour yet we hate our skins
You is you're worst enemy, but we never stay
True to our own destiny
And this is something that I know
But yet I never grow
Tears from my eyes with every word that I write
To give you whats left of me
Transition of a centerpiece
Afraid to take from my dad cause' he only has a little so
All I have is change to make a change
And a bible and a pound to help me attain fame
And a wish to parade faith
For a while  I was up north selling crack to insane dames
I swear I'll give back to mum who stole pampers to save face
A crowd is made up of people
But a person is a crowd in disguise
A cloak immersed in a lie
Drowns in expected demise
See the rain bleed through her eyes
Yh shes hot though
But shes a slut though
She makes gamblers and police wanna cop clothes
Body causes cardiac arrest so baby cop clothes
Why you so intent in stripping in a deluxe show
Find a woman that can cook a meal
One that pledges her allegiance to the kitchen and has jollof in the corner of her will
Shes a flame that burns in a fire
That's a metaphor for the state of England, he desires
Selling weed
Instead of investing in education to improve his standard of living and better his future seed
I know the feeling of shame
Only having 50p to get a seat on the train and I mean
The king in the desert I reign
Prophesy to a nation
Leave hell drowning in flames
Quench the fire and then remain
With my spirit smoking oxygen
Im high on life yes I'm high off strife tonight
I'm able with chimes
The cain in the lines
The payment of crime
I've clocked this with time
Never will I sleep walk
I'll even defeat poor
