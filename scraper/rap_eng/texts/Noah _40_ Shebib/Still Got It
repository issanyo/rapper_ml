[Intro: Drake]
I feel good
Got some time off, Girl it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
I'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give each other space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like...

[Hook: Drake]
I feel good
Got some time off, girl, it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still…

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ain't nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he don't excite you
I ain't the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Still a superfreak
You know how I be when I'm rolling in the streets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause I'm the same Ol' G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguing in Barney's, fly shit
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems running like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like "how you feeling babe?"
Like, shit
