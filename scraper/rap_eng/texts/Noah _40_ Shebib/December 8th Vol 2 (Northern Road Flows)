Verse 1
Northern road flows, and I'm doing it for the bros
Who couldn't make the A's an decided to sell them O's
Tot the iron every day like they gotta unwrinkle clothes
But that's the way that it goes, when that's the life that they chose
Seen niggas take a left turn and fuck around get left burnt
And niggas who thought they found Ms.Right just to get left hurt
Seen Innocent girls in the world they get left turnt
A freak that'll sneak to the crib soon as she left church
Seen real niggas do time for real snitches
That's why i never boast or brag Ion tell nobody my business, Stay silent bout my riches write scriptures without a tabernacle
The moves made in silence like P Pterodactyl
I from the land where they all about the profit, which mean they down to shoot at your corner just like JR Smith
The boy be on fire so the better call a Marshall, and I still need a mil a check in the booth I go darko
The bank be doing well and I don't even rock with fargo, Niggas move a couple grams and they swear to God that it's Narcos
Why they talk it, I walk it
I had it never lost it
It's one night get back to yo life baby girl why you stalking
The ride the wave and I'm hopping they don't car sick
Known to leave yo girl dripping running just like a faucet
Hoe I'm from the ville that's a 256 killer, but I still keep the Rocket in pocket not talking Clint Capela
I live the dream like Hakeem, I'm stacking money to ceiling feeling like Yao Ming know what I mean
And I never lost the magic but like TMac when I'm macking, if you wanna get buck I'm well protected from the Warren Sapp and
These rappers for lunch all I need is napkin, And whoever had the crown well it's time for them pass it
All I need is one shot call me the black John Paxon, I'm getting better by the bar hear me gaining traction
I grew up round' dealers and killers now raps the occupation, The way I give bars would swear to God I'm incarcerating
What's a 9-5 I'm trying to be the greatest, What's a hit when you know you trying to save a generation
But knowing you never can, knowing they'll never give you a chance
Just know that I'm the man and I'm in that killa Cam
And that mean that all pink, and you know it's authentic
And I'm all in it, you niggas know I ball like sports-center
A go getter, had the sauce but never got lost in it
A true killer keep it chiller, keep it on khwei leanord
I mean kwhai, said it for the sake of the rhyme
Killing everybody beat at a drop of a dime, yo favorite rapper too gonna hit em with a red line
I'm only getting better so that's gotta be a sign, and this for the fan even if it's 2 or 5 y'all the reason why I wake up in the morning feeling inspired
But for real, I really wish y'all knew how it feel
No matter how ill, You never guaranteed a deal
If you don't mumble in yo raps, that mean you never will appeal to the masses
Even if you got the fire with no one to match it
Now I'm stuck in college classless, trying to make a classic
Wish it would go faster, but i'm still on top just like an attic
Your son (sun) still gone shine that's how I look at it, See the fans as fens so you know I gotta serve the attics
December 8th, I had to drop the volume 2
Show you how I really do, and show how I much I improved
And I still haven't made it yet got a lot to prove, But the game drive you insane just like Bishop in the Juice
I'm wide awake chasing dreams, doing work upon the mic
Alabama summers but I swear them was the coldest nights
Staying up to 4 trying to make my beats and write my rhymes
Working on the listens, but the only thing that played was time
This for the fam, know that y'all don't hear a lot from me
But I'm working so life can be like we won the lottery
Just know I pick up every time I can and that's possibly
I put my life upon these lines and pray to god y'all proud of me
Forreal
