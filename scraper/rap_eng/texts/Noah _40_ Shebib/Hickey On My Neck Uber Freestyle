Its, Pete, Its Pete
On Another Beat
Riding With My Team
We Pull Up In The Beam
Its Fun, Its Fun, Have It Your Way
Just Know, Just Know, That You're Gonna Catch A Case
We Rollin Up Them Big Boys (Kim K)
Thick And Petty Bitch As Young Maxo Would Say
Never Have Been Locked Up
But You Know I'm Always Cocked Up
My Neck Is Always Iced Up
Its Always Freezin'
Like The Hickey On My Neck Your Girl Be Leaving
(Mark Brito) What the Fuck?
