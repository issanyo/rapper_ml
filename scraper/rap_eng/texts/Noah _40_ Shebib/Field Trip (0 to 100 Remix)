Let me show yall rappers how to kill shit
You can try to do it but ain't got the proper skill set
Every single day is like a mothafuckin field trip
0 to a 100 haters try to hit the kill switch

[Verse 1]
Call me Will Smith Ima be here "After Earth"
They gone kneel quick I'ma send em back to church
You a undercover fan im send ya ass a shirt
Already got the addy, gave your girl a package first
Ain't no dinner or dessert, she was with it from the jump
I would hit it from the back she was beggin from the front
We were knockin over furniture you can call me a homewrecker
She bust 5 times in one night now that's a new record
Got my new record comin out soon
Runnin errands in my neighborhood wearin house shoes
Im an ignant muhfucka from an underground crew
I can dumb it down and still run miles round you
Yous a bitch
Male bitches do exist
Might as well rock a pink mustache like a lyft
That's a diss, man I'm good at that shit
Used to battle mothafuckas you can pull up mad clips

[Hook]
Yo Let me show yall rappers how to kill shit
You can try to do it but ain't got the proper skill set
I ain't seen a single Asian brother with a deal yet
Give me seven figures you can put me to the real test

[Verse 2]
Fresh off the boat I'm Elian meeting eddie huang
LA as Eric Garcetti, smokin on that cali bomb
Daddy gone, he was busy takin down another broad
Mama askin my sister what the fuck is your brother on
We ain't cut from the same cloth, hell nah
Check the thread count, you a couple hundred off
Egyptian cotton and cleopatras who do it all
I'm doin me, you doin you but you just do it wrong
Got my mind right and got my body right
Doing bikram yoga with your lady when your out of sight
Sweatin out the toxins from the night before
She was getting touchy feely, askin for a light show
Getting trippy till like seven fifty
In the morning we can hear the birds chirpin
Like a Motorola phone and what a life
Man my 20s is the shit
I can go into my 30s no regrets, take notes youngin

[Hook]
Let me show yall rappers how to kill shit
You can try to do it but ain't got the proper skill set
All I cares about the people I build with
0 to a 100 man my family getting real rich, real shit
