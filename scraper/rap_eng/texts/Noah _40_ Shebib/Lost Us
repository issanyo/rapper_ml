Late nights getting high in your car
Mother always trippin so you know we not going far
Couldn't go in the house, you fucked me under the stars
Emotions getting involved so now we growing apart
So whats uppp ?
And this is real i knew that shit from the start
But you been acting different its kinda breaking my heart
Whenever you assume it'd kinda tear us apart
You call me while you was drunk
So I'm coming its getting dark
& thats real..
So you know , roll the blunt i really love that shit
Tell me that you hate me, its over you giving up & shit
Go and call that bitch that you swear to god you not fucking with
But all i want is you , its just us like on some couple shit
You don't wanna smoke , but baby just take a couple hits
We ain't spoke in days, so maybe thats why I'm feeling sick
Niggas hit your phone , your feelings are probably changing quick
But imma keep it real , you're the only reason I'm stressing this
I got a question who you fucking with now?
If i was a different person would you keep him around?
Used to tell me just smile when i was putting you down
Used to stay with a smile when i was coming around
Wasn't even a visual but you was holding me down
Probably out of the party and I'm just missing you now
But thats life , and I'm dreaming i'll take your ass to the Grammys
Imma get you a stylist and have you sit with my family
Niggas say that I'm tripping but they just don't understand me
Member nights in my room when i recorded you dancing
Light some candles and fuck , yeah I'm a hopeless romantic
& I'm just saying I'm in love , but i don't understand it
Had a couple of bitches, don't even talk tot them now
Trynna make up for the past but you won't talk to me now
All we used to do was smoke , but you won't spark with me now
Now I'm smoking all alone and i don't wanna come down
Im all alone bout to call up your phone
Ask if i could swing by but you're not even home..
Got a blunt in my car I'm trynna get in my zone
(its the only way i cope since you left me alone
)
