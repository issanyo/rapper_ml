[Intro]
I will be turning the podium over to Mr. Wheaton, who will be presenting his case in favor of a supreme celestial dictator, otherwise known as God. Mr. Wheaton, podium is yours

[Verse 1]
My first chick had problems
She thought lovin' me was gon' solve 'em
I prolly only made it worse
She could do better
Told her I'm a young nigga from the hood
Fuck did you expect, ho? I'm about a check, ho
All I see is money on my fuckin' mind
Courtesy of comin' from that west side

[Refrain]
It was Stunna, me and Mike, that's a trio
15 blowin' trees in the 3-0
Young nigga wanna set the bank off so fast for the cash
Had me feelin' like Cleo
Mothafuckas say they always believed in me
But ain't nobody ever had me but me
Daddy locked down, he been pushin' keys
Mama on her own puttin' me to sleep

[Chorus]
Told me, "Don't cry, baby
Had a dream, pray to God, my baby"
But I ain't dreamin'
"Don't cry, baby
Had a dream, pray to God, my baby"
A God I don't believe in
She said, "You gotta maintain your faith
You gotta believe in somethin'"
I told her, "Every day life is the same
How come he never shows me nothin'?"

[Post-Chorus]
Lately I've been feelin' low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low
Sippin' lean just to slow, slow, slow, slow
Slow my mind down, I just wanna do better

[Verse 2]
PTSD from my childhood
I woke up for cereal one mornin'
SWAT team kickin' down the fuckin' doors
Older sister handcuffed on the floor
She was only 15, my nigga, mama in the kitchen
Cops got a gun up to her kitchen
Stream full of tears, blurry mothafuckin' vision
Bad choices of my brother got his ass up in prison
He was only 19, my nigga, still up in the system
Pray he get this shit up out his system
Everybody got a dream, my nigga
Just wonder why I gotta be the one to dream
They gon' free all my niggas

[Refrain]
It was Stunna, me and Mike, that's a trio
15 blowin' trees in the 3-0
Young nigga wanna set the bank up so fast for the cash
Had me feelin' like Cleo
Mothafuckas say they always believed in me
But ain't nobody ever had me but me
Daddy locked, gone, he been pushin' keys
Mama on her own puttin' me to sleep

[Chorus]
Told me, "Don't cry, baby
Had a dream, pray to God, my baby"
But I ain't dreamin'
"Don't cry, baby
Had a dream, pray to God, my baby"
A God I don't believe in
She said, "You gotta maintain your faith
You gotta believe in somethin'"
I told her, "Every day life is the same
How come he never shows me nothin'?"

[Outro]
Atheists say that no one can prove the existence of God, and well, they're right. But I say no one can disprove that God exists. But the only way to debate this issue is to look at the available evidence, and that's what we're going to do. We're going to put God on trial, with Professor Radisson as the prosecutor, and me as the defense attorney, and you as the jury
