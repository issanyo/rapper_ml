All of the sudden; I'm feeling famous
It's like I got a million people handing me opinions
Thinking that I give the the slightest fuck about their feelings
Cause they seem to know my name; but dawg I couldn't care less about ya, so listen:
I'm not you; I'm cut from a different cloth
My views differ from these blind kids acting tough
Like no; you get no love for wearing tight jeans, a tight shirt and fucking snap backs so fuck off
Yes I have an attitude, but rather have that then be like you
Talking behind backs like a bitch; Guess who?
Cause if it fits, then all of ya can wear the fucking shoe
I don't owe the world no answers, so yeah; fuck you
You got a problem; come and find me
Don't be telling my friends or girlfriend shit about me
When honestly you've never met me or been around me
If all you'll do is gossip when I'm there; change the topic
I'm not pissed, just warning you frat kids
Slash grown ass men A.K.A. work buddies
Talking 'bout my last Facebook status with Higher-ups
Like that's gonna help ya achieve higher ups
If you ran as much as your mouth does; you wouldn't be as fat

Just saying
Just saying
Just saying

Now Back to Hip-Hop, I'm waiting on Che to drop this hit dawg
Pulling Bobby to the side like: "I'm about to diss ya"
When really you just want attention cause you miss us;
It's been a year, and your ass is still pissed off?
How stupid are you to ask Bobby and Dre-
To rap for you again? What are you, fucking insane?
You really think they'll stand beside you after one train?
Oh wait; let's not talk about one train
You feel the need to tell your story; go ahead
But let me guess; I am the dick, I am the prick-
And you are the sorry little victim that never did shit
Now everybody feels bad for poor little Che
What else is new? I'm like the suckiest manager
Cause we don't release shit every week like amateurs
Like "Fuck Bobby, Dre, Devante and George-
They don't know what it's like to make dope, club songs"
Funny how they compliment you first, but when they see you are first-
Is the second they hate from verses to even shirts
But when it comes to Che, shit, to me it's all a corpse
So let it die dawg; it can always get worse

I'm just saying dawg
You shouldn't have pushed me
But, its whatever
