[Hook]

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me

[Verse 1]

I need to find someone, I need to find something
To keep my sanity and blood from my heart pumping
If the past is gone, why am I grasping on?
It's like hugging a cactus the pain is strong
Yeah, I just changed my motives
Trying to solve it when deep down I know
You can't change what's in the past; what's done is done
And that's been my problem I overthink on all the fun I had
Yeah, my new habits are great
I'm new to the game so it's easy to hate
You're thinking I'm fake on these beats by Drake
Get the tape; it gets better play by play I swear
Lame rhymes never had time to put the scheme together
I ponder why am I so polite to people who don't deserve it
When the ones that do tend to end up with the short stick
I can never find a balance to weigh out my problems
Besides my sister no one with me to help solve 'em
Rap is my outlet to air out some dark shit
Upbringing's where I'mma start this
Dreams steady chasing
Living in the moment, running; my heart's racing
I got a squad to catch me if I fall
And a family who'd risk it all

[Hook]

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me

[Verse 2]

Depressing night: caught myself dreaming about it
I'm over it but you're not beside it
I'm psyching out; don't listen to this anymore
We're not on the same page
Why didn't I learn that before?
Oh no, here it comes
Another messed up memory to block out all of our history
Or maybe my subconsious is sending me a message
I get it; I should've gotten over you the milisecond we broke up
Need to stop this nonsense
You live through my mind my conscience; why's this?
I'm over it like the clown
But still it feels weird when I see you around
I moved on
These songs say different
Complete not missing
Exposing these stories 'cause I can't keep hidden
How I felt how I feel
Gotta keep it real
Trying to reveal
Just 'cause there's no one above
Don't mean I want you
We're a used glove
Love don't exist, it never did
Infatuation reigned we were just kids
(Young love)
Dreams steady chasing
Living in the moment running my heart's racing
Truthfully I appreciate my failures
That way my victories can be greater


[Hook]

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
