[Verse 1]
Everybody's got different sides to 'em
She's no exception to the rule
One day she's hotter than the sun
Next she's colder than the moon
You say you want to feel appreciated
So before you come around
I can ask how far it's come
To be ready for us now

[Chorus]
Always thought she was the prettiest
But she don't know
So nice to meet you, Angela

[Verse 2]
Now how shit begins, don't represent the end
It's not always what it's about
Thereâ€™s ups and downs, to the East and the West
Sometimes it's north and south
I'm praying for her on my knees
And I hope to God, hope that he can hear me
Don't let her get caught up now
Cause the world out there is less forgiving

[Chorus]
Always thought she was the prettiest
But she don't know
So nice to meet you, Angela

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
No more hanging in the shadows
She's bringing it all into the light
She put it all on display
Even her darker side
And it ain't easy
Holding onto yourself
And making it out alive
I know what's out there for you
It should come as no surprise

[Chorus]
Always thought she was the prettiest
But she don't know
So nice to meet you, Angela

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Outro]
No one's gonna fool around with us
So nice to meet you, Angela
