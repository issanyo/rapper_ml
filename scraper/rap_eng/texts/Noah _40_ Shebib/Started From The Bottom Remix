[Verse: Ydoc]

Started from the bottom now I'm somewhere in the middle
You don't need to understand I'm just thankful you're a fan
We can do this together, no matter what the weather
You turn it up a notch, till your freakin' speakers pop
Like everyday is different, I'm livin' on a mission
I'm 19 livin' off low paychecks, you can tell that I'm hungry
Always stayed home working, never went to parties, high school really never worked for me
Ah
Ahhhhh
Swear I kept it real from the start, with my team
Now my whole city thinking that I'mma star
Like its a new thing and dreaming is an old thing
I swear I run it when I visit, all these late night calls and all these late night texting
Its worth it
All my fans keep me working
The way they gloat about me, makes me seem so perfect
Good kid with good intentions ha
[I ain't lying in my verses i just hope y'all take care]

[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team freaking here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom aha

Started from the bottom now we here, yeah
Started from the bottom now my whole team freaking here, trick, yeah
Started from the bottom now my team here

Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team freaking here
Started from the bottom

[Verse 2: TempOh]

Started from the bottom now we headin'
Straight to the top and I'm not about to stop
Because even all this hate that I'm getting
Can't get to my brain because I'm not one of the same as one of these lame ass kids
If I hit him would you miss, is he just another victim, or did you know the name of that kid
If you didn't know well
The name if my crew Purple Heart Gang
