[Intro: Cameron Uzoka]
My heart beats for insanity
And I want to know
Why I never grow
Redemption I was told came at a price
I could never afford I was deprived
Of imposing my right to be alright
This is lust for life

[Verse 1: Cameron Uzoka]
Baby when will you learn
That money doesn't buy you respect baby girl understand its a wage that you earn
And all that make-up covers up your pain the attention why do you yearn
A world full opposites, why is it when water rolls down we continue to burn
Continue to burn

She can't manage the conflicts
When her mother calls she's up in the car its
Lingerie all day, jigga
Rose, fragrance of sorrow and paid liquor
She's high on life breaking cerfues
Wearing Fendi, Channelle all type of perfumes
And she can't even pay the bills
But still hollers at her friends telling them that she'll be there soon
More diligent than any soul
She hits every bar men can't decipher her code
Fam she winks then she blinks now you're soaked underneath her covers
She has a daddy and she played the mother
Damn, its been a long while
Don't touch that phone dial
Cause' your numbers up honey
Being broke is a joke it really isn't that funny, I know
Dark nights alone
Its her and the devil as she glanced at the throne
Indulged in her fantasies she's definitely prone to
She hits the dome like 02
What do I owe you woman in disguise
Alleviate the pain with your swagga and your thighs
The woman and your ride values you've never held
Vindictive young lady pay attention detail cause'
The currency for success is change love
Collect all the pennies and switch the game fam
Cause' you only live once
Achieve now instead of waiting six months, allow me to say

[Outro: Drake]
Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up in the air for her
Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up
