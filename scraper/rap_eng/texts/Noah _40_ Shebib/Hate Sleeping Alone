[Verse 1: Cameron Uzoka]
Can a river burn in a fire
Can an angel then tempt desire
An arsonist fails when formulating his plan
Cause' flames never distinguish between humans and its attire
Robe of iniquity, please get into me
And drown me in obsession, then dry me over your sister please
Apply the lotion to my torso
Remove the spirit from her and gradually witness her torn soul, her excuse is she's a
Winter wifey, she's living lively, a temperature never meant for any to feel and
Her maturity caused her father to cop a feel and oh
She gains experience, notify the mysterious, silhouettes on her chest
As she reaches for her own shadow, she craves for company, mind your business or lets invest
In coke shares, a future plastered with Remy
Hate sleeping alone, she loves sleeping with many, I hate sleeping alone

[Hook: Yezah]
I hate sleeping alone, please pick up the phone
Your love is in my hand, its falling on the floor
Pick it up, show me all the lust
The trust that I have over your hips and your bust
No tricks between the curves, no tricks no tricks
Ahh ohhhhhhhhhhh
No pain comes over trust, no pain
Woooooohoooo
Pick it up, pick it up, that's enough

[Verse 2: Cameron Uzoka]
Annalisa, but are you really Lisa?
Two names, a smile borrowed from Mona Lisa
What a keeper, me trust boys my minds in a threesome
I'll be your woman
Be my royail mail I'll deliver the woman
Anything that you require
Even a Gucci suit to maintain your ego and the intent to fill your desires
Babe what I require is a good beat
A sanctuary for a good read
I wanna cheat
Do a Marley take a girl who's freak and do the deed
And hopefully spend the night
I don't mind going Spain take your memory on a flight
But why's my friends picture as your dp?
Why do you call me Stacy instead of Lisa?
Why Shaniqua waving your visa?
Am I acting like a diva he left me with no regret
Hi-Fived my innocence stripped me of my respect
But that's a lie from the pits of Hell cause' tonight his bed is lonely
I guess the swiftest route is to take things slowly
I guess I'm sleeping alone
