[Hook]
Don't fuck with me! (x4)

[Verse]
Not really good with names, store my girls in states
Pop up on 'em, I ain't stop, open up your pearly gates
My Sunday shawty, got the fly girl swag
She call me Monday, probably not call back
I'm in my drop-off Jag
I spot a 'digger like a knockoff bag
Jamaica nigga in-and-out yo' pad
Now you house toe-tagged
I clear 'em all like pins, bowl 'em back-to-back
Black girl in my new white Benz, loaded mac, all rap
Manipulate the mind, the Omen as I trap
I'm what this bitch been trying to find, I had to clap!
Beauty by the baddest, I average that
Had to advertise; Eyes, thighs, and the ass is fat
You probably can't keep up, catch a asthma attack
Heart attack, verbal cardiac by the party 'yac
They love me when they starving at, robbing at
Bomber rap, blondie in my lap, weave and bobbing that
She looking for a rebound, I'm looking like the center of attention
Can't blame her for wanting to be down
When we round, that pussy on lock, Master P found
Trying ways to break out the crib, that's the P' now
You niggas couldn't see me with my b-style
Flying in and out the jungle, A.M.G. child
Money to the have-nots, make 'em cheese smile
Accountant on speed dial
Dour like the dealer, nigga!
