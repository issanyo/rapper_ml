Hey
I was thinking about you all day
I get off at 8
Maybe you could come over and we could you know
Chill and watch Netflix or something
Call me back when you get this message
Bye

You don’t return my phone calls
I’m done playing games with you
We shouldn’t even speak at all
Heard you begging her to come through

I was the one who held you down
She’s just a girl you keep around
Didn’t wanna give you up
Just know that at end of the day

When you get sick of her
I know you’ll come right back
& Leave kisses on my spot
You know how I like that

I know a one night stand
Won’t make you love me again
But give me a week and I’ll make you forget about her

Yeah my minds conflicted
And you’re the one who did it
I went and got addicted
To your love
To your love
I thought you were different
I guess that I was wrong
And I should’ve listened to em when they said leave you alone

I’m just saying I deserve better
It’s too late stop sending love letters
No I won’t
No I won’t
Try and force you to forget her
Onto better things
Could give a fuck about your feelings

Fuck you
You little ass bitch fuck you
And that dumb hoe fuck her too
Not trying to spend time with you
I’m done trying
You always lying
Stop fucking lying
Why the fuck you lying
Oh my god
