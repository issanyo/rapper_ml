[Intro - Low Pitch Jhene Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1 - Young Stoney]
Were me and you only meant to be a memory or was it lack of energy?
I mean the summer's burn and the winter's freeze
Everything gets perfect as you begin to see, the part of people that's hidden deep
I mean we see the same signs but we on a different street
Different city than the small one that I came from
You talking to your girls and they love to bring my name up
He was with her, he was high, he was drunk
And every time you listened it just put you in a slump
I swear I hate the rumors, I swear you love my humor
I swear that loves a tumor, I swear that hates a crooner
Getting faded screaming church but I don't hear a hallelujah
Oh well
Guess the times are gone for good judgement
Even yo mamma know I'd make a good husband
But things change, nah better yet baby you did
Spent all my time with you and you couldn't even take my two cents
That penny for my thoughts, that penny I made a wish on
I can still taste your lip balm
You can't hear me talking like a broke in half flip phone
All I said was it never had to be this way or that way
And now you looking down cause them roaches in the ashtray
My pas tways didn't influence any of my bad days
Never needed a home cause I had space, in your heart and I was there from the start

[Verse 2 - Young Stoney]
Caught up with them bitches and you don't get it
I did a lot of shit except ask for your forgiveness
Never needed it for me to feel right
But I feel wrong
I'm still gone
Smoke clearing the car when the wind blown
Not only my lover but my friend gone
Texas's little angel already sent home

[Hook - Low Pitch Jhene Aiko & Slowed Down]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
