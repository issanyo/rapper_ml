[Verse 1]
As it approaches a year
I remember the fear
All on my mind
Couldn't leave this behind
Returned in the fall
I knew it wasn't all
But I still took advantage
I still took it
Could've been more aggressive
Why would I translate the message?
Why would I jeopardize myself?
But how could I truly knew
Of what you were open to?
I was brown and you were blue
What's there to be shy about?
Didn't I already construct that route or?

[Hook]
It's never the right time
When you buy a clock, control that
It's never the right time
When you got that love, take hold of that
It's cold, I think I need a coat
I think I got a couple love poems in my throat
That they will never know
Will never never know, will never never know
Will never never know, will never never know
Will never never know

[Verse 2]
I loved you
As much as I loved juice
I speak my own language, Earl Stevens
But don't two odds always make an even?
This was my reasoning
Autumn was the season
Back straight to the bed
Ain't been that patient since
I guess it'd make more sense if I just let you
But it was the last time anyways, I could've made it special
And I hate that I didn't, wasn't used to admitting
Now I can't even get the admission
I knew you wasn't playing
That water and the hands, your actions was saying
I don't overthink, I analyze
Eyes got me paralyzed
I remember the way you looked at me
Drunk In Love karaoke holding back anxiously
I'm over here so glo'd up
Hold me when you show up
I won't break it for no one
We dancing with Wilson on
Let It Shine and Hill Tree One
Finger on my lip, index tip
I never tried dip
Let me show you something worth trying

[Hook]
