[Verse: Vader]
Purge your soul, I know you ain't tryna be hypocritical
Cos you a big player in a game you tryna ridicule
I heard the song, and I know deep down it's all a strategy
Cos saying SA is better than us is such a tragedy
You shot yourself in the foot
You better be Superman and switch your style up in the booth
Cos you said it yourself so I ain't tryna be harsh
That you scrapped a whole album
Cos they told you it was trash
Dem boys said it was trash
So if you can't keep up, put the young ones on
Or you get buried in the flow, this ain't the twilight zone
And now you come around complaining that rappers are singing too much
When Iceprince, Pryse and Dice did so on your watch
These are facts OG
See anybody gon' get it
I'm taking you to the sacrament, better ready your penance
Who said singing is a crime, do it if you can
Reminisce sang Ponmile and that shit is a jam
So if you got problems with singing rappers, look inwards
Cos y'all started that shit and forgot how to drop bars
Too many dope rappers, maybe you chose not to listen
We need the support of our OGs but no, they're dissing us
Labels fucking everything up, including yours
Stifling creativity, but you have the balls
To say we're inferior to S.A
But get pissed when Osagie asked "who the fuck is C-Kay?"
All I see is a Kanye-complex, and I ain't Kim K
Beginning to see too much paranoia these days
But I ain't tryna breed hate, see
I know you're the elephant, in the room
But how many rappers you put on are still relevant
Save for Jesse Jaggz but he had to quit twice
Quite an Odyssey, he literally had to quit twice
So it ain't about the message, it's about the messenger
I'm not in the driver's seat, I'm not even a passenger
I ride solo, I never hop on the bandwagon
First they doubt you, then later on you see the hands clapping
Then you start receiving co-sign like you in Maths classes
Then you silence everybody, no sounds, Charles Chaplin
The truth is, I'm too sick, my brain is quarantined
I speak volumes, elephantine, giant gargantuan
I can't be defined by everyday vocabulary
Ladies' man, my bed has seen more drips than President Buhari
Go figure, I'm just saying, the boy sicker
Spreading more good news than church speakers
Balls big enough to steal drugs from officers
You only got prostate cancer if your balls bigger
I'm here reiterating it, anybody gon' get it
Sweet bars, these other rappers be sour like Guinea Bissau
Yeah I make corny lines sound amazing
You want beef, but look away when cows are grazing
Cos if Cassper say he the best, and Nasty say he the next
And Sarkodie got an S on his chest and Jaggz the greatest
And the god MC is Manifest
And somehow y'all think that I can't set a higher standard
You lie I'll kill'em all and still have shots for bystanders..
Amen!

[Outro: tGM]
Hey yo... yo Vader
You think these niggas ready?
Nah nah, these industry niggas?
They not ready for it man
Don't start a war you're not ready for
Sun Tzu
WTS, it's about time
Things about to change man
Y'all should be afraid
We Talk Sound, WTS!
Mehn fuck these niggas mehn
Mehn fuck it, I'm out!
