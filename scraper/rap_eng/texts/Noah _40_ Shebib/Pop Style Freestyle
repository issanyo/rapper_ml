[Intro: NUFF$AID]
Yeah, NUFF$AID, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: NUFF$AID]
I been in the stu recording
Like D'Angelo Russell (D'Angelo Russell)
Started from the bottom
So I know the struggle (Know the hustle)
Never had shit
So I had to hustle (Had to hustle)
Trappin' in the kitchen
Watch the work bubble (Watch it bubble)
Then we bag it up
And throw it in the duffle (In the duffle)
Nowadays I gotta roll with more muscle (More muscle)
Last week I got into a lil scuffle (Lil scuffle)
Threw Azaleas in the casket
Had to get the shovel (RIP)
I don't box it out
Nah we got the deuce deuce
Yeah you better duck duck
Like a nigga said goose
All my dawg crip
Yeah, niggas think it's blues clues
But it's blood all on my gloves
Yeah I think that I'm The Juice (O.J.)
Paul Pierce at the buzzer
Yeah I think that I'm The Truth
Kris Jenkins with the aim
You don't want no problems Duke
Drop the top, Raise the roof
Yeah I think I'm Uncle Luke
Got them birds all in my bag
I think I'm Crash Bandicoot
I be getting too high
Think I need a parachute
Niggas see me in the street
And they Triple hand salute
Got them pre-rolls in my
Brand new Nike Tech suit
Got your girl all in my bed
So no she cannot text you

[Verse 2: NUFF$AID]
Ye killed the beat
You know I had to pop style on it
I be wylin on it
You be auto pilot on it

(BREAK)

Somebody tell these labels sign me
Cause all these other cats that rap
The same like Siamese (twins)
I'm just a Kyrie in a world
Filled with Kehlanis
I'm tryna find Ayesha Curry's
And Deanni's
I need a dime piece

(BREAK)

The rap game need change
Like it need some quarters for the meter
Bunch of thirsty niggas rapping
They need water by the liter
They say my new shit be slappin'
Baby Boy in the wife beater
These the new singles y'all
Like Onika and Rihmeek bruh
If Ye think he Pablo
Well, shit I think I'm Van Gogh
Got so many chains
All my niggas call me Django
I been grinding all week
Same clothes
Different flows
I been fucking all week
Same hoes
Different Strokes
Whatchu talking bout Willis?!
What the hell do y'all know?
Locked up in the studio
Can't find me like Waldo
Chilled with Carmen San Diego
Like about a day ago
Can't touch this
MC hammer, hot potato flow
Wrote this in a bungalow
When I was drinking rum and coke
Five bad bitches
Yeah we fucked 'em
But we hardly spoke
One chick told me
That she'd never fuck if I was broke
I told her that's the right mindset
Don't ever let it go

[HOOK: NUFF$AID]
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some Fulton, Franklin Ave shit (Ave shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turned my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)
