[Verse One: Dirty Perc]
I been dealing with flaky friends
Too caught up to make amends
Too cocky to not pretend
It’s obvious i’m a trend
They ask me for honesty, honestly i’ll offend
I'm a prodigy with a pen
A common life isn’t meant
Yeah, a common life isn't meant
For someone with dreams of mine
Keep in mind, I told you i’m here to rise
They disguised, Romulus inside
I’m always on ten toes, they hidden within hides

[Chorus: Dirty Perc]
Yeah, they fear the realest
And i’m a realist
Double crossing us will cause ya friction
Retaliation is intended
They fear the realest
And i’m a realist
Double cross the mob, we go gorilla
Retaliation is intended
This survival of the fittest
This survival of the fittest

[Verse Two: Dirty Perc]
Yeah, this survival of the fittest, we really is it
Jealousy’s a given
Look at our position
It’s like every fucking body and their mom’s our opposition
Damn, gifted composition on composition on composition on composition
They hardly listened
How the hell they hate when they freely resisted?
Can you really blame me if I feel resentment?

[Chorus: Dirty Perc]
Yeah, they fear the realest
And i’m a realist
Double crossing us will cause ya friction
Retaliation is intended
They fear the realest
And i’m a realist
Double cross the mob, we go gorilla
Retaliation is intended
This survival of the fittest
This survival of the fittest
