[Verse 1: Divine Brown]
Sometimes I need you
Sometimes I don't
Sometimes I'll take the time to hang with you
Sometimes I won't
See I'm just the kinda girl who, loves her space
But you always take it to heart when I pull
Away from your embrace

[Pre-Chorus: Divine Brown]
No I can't talk now
Oh you can't come in
When the day is done I'll tell you
Just where I stand, stand, stand, stand, stand...

[Chorus: Divine Brown]
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear

[Verse 2: Divine Brown]
You said you want my lovin' like
Every day, all day
So used to bein' in control
You just can't have your way
Sometimes I'm on fire, boy, oh baby
Then I get ice cold
You say you know what you want
But you just can't crack my code, no no

[Pre-Chorus: Divine Brown]
I can't talk now
Uh uh, you can't come in
You gotta wait, baby
Just a little while longer
And I'll tell you

[Chorus: Divine Brown]
I'm just wanna think about it
Twistin'
While I twist my hair
Twistin'
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
Just give me some time, baby
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
While I twist it

[Bridge: Divine Brown]
It might take a little long, but
It might be worth your wait
If it's you and me, baby
Then we can do the damn thing
Tryna put the pressure on me
I'm gonna leave it up to faith
I know you want an answer
But you got to, got to, got to, got to wait

[Verse 3: Drake]
Sweetie I hope you're takin' the lines down
Shake it and wine 'round
Twist up to this one
It's Drake and Divine Brown
It's new and improved, no mistakin' from afar
You just do what you do and I'll be waitin' in the car
Aw you can twist it up (yup), and you can let it flow (yup)
You can pull it back or leave it and let it grow (yup)
Braid it and put it under fleece in the winter
Just never slang it back with the piece in the center
Dudes be like, "Baby, boo let's go"
It take 'em time to get cute homie, you best know
I'm hot without a, you guess, oh
Cause I reside up north and ain't forcin' a U.S. flow
You heard?

[Chorus: Divine Brown]
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
I'm gonna twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
If it's more than I can bear, baby
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
See I like my independence
But right now, listen
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
I don't know
Say do I need a relationship?
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Or do I need to be single?
Ooh baby, baby
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
I'm just wanna think about it
While I twist my hair
Later on I'll let you know if this love
Is more than I can bear
