[Hook ]

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Verse #1]
KMX I’m chasing my dream man
Wu-Tang I’m a get this c.r.e.a.m. man
Cash rules everything around me
Ask 50 cent how my niggas rowdy rowdy
I don’t trust no one that pound me
Lost contact with my friend but he found me
Been cool with Mikey since Pre-K, I’m here in the game nigga like EA
Gonna be the greatest ever like that dude from BK, every rapper out now man beneath me
I could put any legend on the ropes, they I changed nigga man I call it growth
My new nickname is KMX “The G.O.A.T.”
I don’t make trap music I don’t rhyme about coke
But two times I sold it, you hear my rhymes thinking did he wrote it
And if you copy my lines you getting jinxed
Headphones on I’m bumping Cuban Linx
Terror in my group name like Cuban Link
My money growing nigga it’s gonna Triple like Seis
All artist watch out cause ya not safe
Yeah you better run nigga like Ghostface
Him Rae & Meth my fav in the group
One days I gotta get these cats in the booth
And in that session I’m a go nuts
Then we fuck hoes in the ice cream truck
Then we fuck hoes in the ice cream truck
Then we fuck hoes in the ice cream truck
