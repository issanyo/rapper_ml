[Verse One: MacE]

Started off as friends then a relationship grew
Two months in she said she needed space, knew that wasn’t true
Broke up a week later, next day she had someone new
Space my ass, you just didn't want me to come though
So I wouldn't find you with your other man
Bitch you just wouldn't understand
Now I’m on holiday, my feelings on mute
Thinkin about her new guy, yeah I’m in pursuit
Doing things my way
Doesn’t matter what they say
Sorry bruh its your doomsday
Find out where you stay after a bottle of hennessey
All’s fair in love and war and
There’s about to be casualties
Lord Mace gunna come up soon
Gota dark side like the moon
Chillin with forrest in Boone, causin them chicks to swoon
Besides basically ballin
I got high like noon
Alliteration and metaphor
Pretty hard to ignore
Like your girl screamin my name with you at the door
Sorry I shouldn’t say anything more
Wouldn't wanna get you upset
You’ll end up doing something you’ll regret
Yeah you should have reason to fret
Yeah you should have reason to sweat
But I haven't even done shit yet
Lookin into my eyes, enough to get your girl wet
But Take out the y outa that your and what are you left with?
But Mace doesnt share
I share this track with my homies cause its only fair
A White boy with a flair
Who doesnt dare to care
Rare as god answering a prayer
Living off the snare, my homies the only ones I’m gunna spare

[Beat Change]

[Verse Three: MacE]

Was it love or was it lust?
Was it deception or mistrust?
It was probably all of that
So many distant memories, can't even keep track
Sometimes I want my old life back
Sometimes I feel like my life is a deck and it's stacked
I could just get you dropped with a tec
Leave your ass jacked
Every line leaves you high
Groovy W like the Brand New Guy
Might be new but I still can make your girl moan for me
Pretty like Rocky
Content like Aubrey
Flow like fergy
Kill you in the morning, hell yeah I'm vengeful
This revenge fuck is so sinful
But shit it feels so wonderful
Cover the ho's mouth. Mace never cuddles
Catching feelings, that's catching trouble
Heavy shit, I'm not gunna stumble
Speak up fag, hate it when ya’ll mumble
Smokin' and Drinkin' like mixed doubles
But I don't lose to love, though I can't get enough
My options? Multiple choice and I get all of the above
