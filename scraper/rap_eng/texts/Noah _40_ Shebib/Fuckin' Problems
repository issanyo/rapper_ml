(Hook: 2 Chainz, Drake, and A$AP Rocky)
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
If finding somebody real is your fuckin problem
Bring ya girls to the crib maybe we can solve it

(Verse: Busta Rhymes)
What they say now? Talk to me Boo
Tell me what you and your bitches really wanna do
We just met and I like to fuck in case you never knew
Beat up the pussy on the balcony, better view
Go ahead and suck that dick but never chew
No need to leave your girls out, you could bring em too
Ass bouncing on a nigga like a kangaroo
From One Oak to Green House, 01 Avenue
Fuck them til they in a coma and they got a clue
Smelling the pussy aroma, what you tryina prove?
Maxi van soldier in the fountain blue
Still spreadin money from my deal with Mountain Dew
I love bad bitches, that’s my fuckin problem
Especially when I got a lot of fuckin options
Bid on the baddest, it’s like a fuckin auction
I need a new endulgment from a fuckin condom

(Hook: 2 Chainz, Drake, and A$AP Rocky)
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
If finding somebody real is your fuckin problem
Bring ya girls to the crib maybe we can solve it

(Verse: J-Doe)
Yea fuckin bad bitch is in my fuckin problem
I don’t know a fly nigga who ain’t fuckin got one
Same issue that I’m havin with you’s fuckin all
So why does fuckin problem even considered a fuckin problem?
Yea, I’m fuckin bad bitches from LA to Boston
New York City, Kansa City, all the way to Austin
Sexes while look at my necklace
She hop on my check list, fuck her and her best friend
My flow is infection, she should be arrested
I’m young and I’m reckless, you must have a death wish
If you try to go against me nigga
I put you and yo career under 6 feet nigga
I see no contender less I’m lookin in the mirror
Told your girl come surrender to my heart, don’t remember
Got a fallout like November but I’m colder than December
Got money on my agenda, come roll on this adventure
Motherfucker I beast

(Hook: 2 Chainz, Drake, and A$AP Rocky)
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck I got a fuckin problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fuckin problem
If finding somebody real is your fuckin problem
Bring ya girls to the crib maybe we can solve it
