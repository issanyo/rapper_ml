[Verse 1]

Why you gotta start man, why you gotta start?
I thought you hired me for the things that you want
And now you got someone else tryna play my part
Just cause I wasn't home doesn't mean I can't work
Could be standing in your face and I still don't have a place
Could fire me today and there wouldn't be a change
Lately I keep doing things to try and make a change
Doing things to make ya'll feel like nothing was the same
How hard is it to let me know, what you wanna do
We could prepare and maybe send a couple of those updates, And some emails
I don't even know what things are looking like and all the details
You telling these tales
These things are getting one-sided I can't even lie to you right now
I swear these days all I say is:

[Hook]

Come and see me for once, come and see me for once, you don't never come to me, you don't never come to me x
