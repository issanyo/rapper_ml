Intro:
Whoop whoop
Yeah
Yeah
And my nigga Coggins is the shooter
Tired of these bitch ass niggas man

Verse:
Aye
More or less
I'm never taking lesser
What’s a loss
I could take a lesson
Lord almighty I could take a blessing
I could take yo bitch
She could give that pussy
And I'll make a mess a'
She could make “buddies"
Wit my Nutty Professor
She could make
Money at 9
By 12 I’ll finesse her
Her zipper the collar
That got me feeling low as depression
I'm high as security clearance
To the cracker house
Since 45 stepped in the building
I been blacking out
Obama cared more
Shit is wicked I been goin sick on niggas
What you think Obama care for
The drama flared
My mama scared
I told her relax
The llama near
The fuck wit Rizz
I guess they Bombaclot time is here
Don't make me get in that duffle boy
I compare you softies
To the thought of cuddling wit Koala bears
Ooh, that little jab ruffled ya feathers
You, all in ya feelins
Nah niggas jealous
I done peeped the shit
No need to tell us
Who is this Rizzie nigga
He always rantin'
Not working enough
So how he claimin' Champion nigga
Look at my catalog
Before you continue that false dialog
I been spittin'
Way before you had a blog
Before you had a voice
I never had a choice
Just rap and ball
Rap and ball
Data krills
Rap and krills
Rap and krills
My niggas rep the krill
I was in the field
Wit these niggas rapping still
Wit this shit
Rappin' still
Packin steel
Bein' me
Y’all actin real
Rat niggas
Cause all the beans out the hat to spill
And you still runnin’ wit the bull
Cause y'all passed together
He catch a body
I bet that they lock y’all ass together
Two dumb niggas
And they sittin in a cell
Sittin
Sittin in a cell
Sittin'
Sittin' in a cell
I told you not to trust that nigga
He not well
Nigga he not well
Ni - nigga he not well
I grew up on Nick
Watchin' all the N
Others
You a Disney child
You motherfuckin’ rat lover
(Rat Lover)
Ain't that much ‘a
Love in the world
Blood brother tell
Fuck it
Blood brother blood spill
We blood still
But the blood don't matter
When the judge bang the gavel
25 to the gravel
(To the dirt)
Niggas shallow
Put a hollow through his apple
How this happen?
Back the fuck up, ‘fore we lights camera
Action
Shoot his scene up
Fuckin' bravo
Fuck a follow
Up the ethic
Pace speedin' up by the second
Check it
Kiki, do you love Drake
Or you gone dub Drake
I just dropped some shit
It ain't a love tape
You could bump Drake
And you could knock me
You could love B
Cry to Ariana Grande
Go up the Brandy
If yo nigga in his feelins
It ain't sittin' wit his soul
This hammer name Angie
It'll take him from his family (lil bitch)
Nigga ghost on him
Hit him wit the Tommy
Not his ghost haunt him
And now boy on the run
He the most wanted
He had a hook dream
Hook shot so flawless
The type a nigga that the coach wanted
Streets got him
Ball lost him
Handles vicious
It's crazy how he died
Cause some trouble crossed him
Come to find out
His own homies double crossed him
Don't get why niggas feel like
Living in this struggles awesome
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
I told niggas before man
I think that I'm…
Rizzie Ali
You know
Rizzie James
Yeah
