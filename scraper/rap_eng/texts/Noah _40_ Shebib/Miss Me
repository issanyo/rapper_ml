Descendant of a king/ heir to the throne/ it's hell for the homes that promote puttin shells to the domes of/
Innocent witnesses, strappin cell phones to they chest/ wit intentions of leavin businesses blown/
Heads turn the right, wondering if God left/ but if that ever happened, it'll be too much to digest/ so i guess/
Blame goes to the man in plain clothes who hates those who made it cuz they never came close./
Religious ambitions of past politicians don't reflect the definition of a hard hittin Christian/ I chose livin and sins forgiven instead of permittin incisions into my living condition
It is written: the first shall be last and the last comes before them. Blessed is the man for I've him/
Spread the good news even though they ignore him
Read Revelation/ understand the four horsemen/
Death is the least of my concerns/ life is the key topic/
My heart wrestles my mind, but I don't need logic
They put lies on the screen hoping we watch it/ but see spit truth and say "when will he stop it"?//
The answer is never, plastering clever rhymes/ sign of the times/ it's a cold world, grab you a sweater/
Panicking average amateurs came from Adam and Eve, handling matters afterwards we are the Greatest
