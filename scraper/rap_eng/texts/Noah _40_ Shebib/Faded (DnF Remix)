Verse 01: DrAssenator
Oh! I’m So Faded in this bitch
Up in the clubs 24x7, livin my life so faded in this fame
1 Bottle, 2 bottle 4 bottles down
Still I want more (more)
Drunk and fuck Women on women
I get bitches like mail, women on women
All up in my business, the meanest the genius
She got high heels & I keep my standards high
Damn! Niggah that my lady, I’m crazy
She fuck me like she hate me
I make her scream like medusa
She lovin’ she huffin & puffin’ cause she’s my lady
And I love her like crazy, we hit the roads
Long nights, wrong nights, puffin on the go
Temperature gettin’high  when she’s dropin’ on her toe-toe
Cause she’s my lady & I love her like crazy
And she fuck me like she hates me
My niggah, she’s makin’ me so faded, I’m so..

(Hook)
I’m so faded, this bitch is drivin’ me crazy
And I’m in the love with the driver
Cause she’s drivin’ me crazy and I love it
My niggah! I’m so faded, ayy
I love that BITCH [X2]

Verse 02: DEXTER
Langdi jadon mery kolon
Lagdi aey superstar
Lak nu hilaway karay mundian da bura hal
Nain sharabi hs day
Pewan main bottle char
Man ja ni sohniye
Vay kis gal da tenu khumar
Ajey v baitha raah vch
Tera karda intezar
Kurian bhaterian ni mery wasty tayar
Chan k vaikh lain tu dunya da har bazar
Labhna nai tenu kithun rajiyan tu wadh k pyar

[Chorus Bridge]
She's makin' me fall in love when she's talkin
She's makin' me fall in love when she's walkin
She's makin me fadded / she's drivin my mind
And I'm in the love with-da driver
Cus' she drivin' me crazy and I'm gettin faded
(fadded,fadded)
Drunk & fuck, faded in this bitch life like video

(Hook/Chorus)
