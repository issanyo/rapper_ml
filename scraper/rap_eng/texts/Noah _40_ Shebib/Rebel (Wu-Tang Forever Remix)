“Turn my headphones up, I think it’s time I open up” -Semit

Intro:
They say, fake it til you make it, make it
Fake it til you make it
They say fake it til you, make it
Fake it til ya, fake it til ya, fake it til you make it

Verse 1:
So I fabricate my smiles
And fabricate my laughs
And talk about the life that I really wished I had
I’m just haunted by the past
Never sleepin, devil creepin
Only way I’ll stop, is if I fucking crash
I’m caught up in the flash
Snapshot moments
I want it all to last
I’m the first one to get it
Who else from the wick
Did it, like I did it?
Started off civil
Sorry Karen had to flip it. * uh *
Why a good girl go bad?
Shy chick gone mad?
I started off sweet now I talk sour
And I bossed up quick like Puff dropped Howard
Sit back and laugh
And watch ya stay mad
I pulled a Yeezy rant on fucking twitter
My heart got cold, man I’ma born sinner
Nothing is the same
From now till forever
Even I fuckin changed
Cause now I’ma rebel
And one day…
I’ll headline Revel
And do what ‘Ye’ did and control all the weather
Was treated like trash
Now I’m worth treasures
Man, I felt all the pain before all the pleasure
The irony of life

Hook:
But shoutout to them bitches that be spyin on my site
Shoutout to them niggas that be eyein me in life
Love to them haters, turning fans over night
But I hate a fake fan but my stans are my life
*woah*

Verse 2:
But I’m only seven teen, only seventeen
This is real life, what I used to call a dream
And I seem to be the light in every dark setting scene
We all know “X”, what about ‘Jean’?
Lord, by any means necessary
Every verse I spit, is my own obituary
I’ll do it til the end of time
I don’t say it, cause it rhymes
I say it cause I mean it
I’m trynna be like HOV hit a million, million times
And sell out shows,  buy a rollie freezing time
I’m trynna be the mold of my city, make it mine
Can't deny it
Never flew private. I demand success
My life just supplies it
But best believe
Best believe …
I don’t got it easy
Motherfuckers know I got stress and fees
Motherfuckers know I got fam to feed
Motherfuckers know fam overseas, slowly dying breed
And my mom ain't lookin good
Every man she meet, more like a bitch if you askin me
When life gets hard, nigga death is peace
And my mom lost her parents so Rest In Peace
Moment of silence please
Best believe
Ma, you faked it real good
Lied in our face, while hiding the truth
And I’m sorry for the pain, that I ever caused you
Had to make dreams come true
I’m thinkin of the future ma, me and you
So cut the act, I know how it go
I’m the one leading the shows, so best believe I know
Best believe I know
But
Back to the topic
I know I just lost it
Opened up for the world, life of an artist
Rap at it’s finest
My raps are just timeless
My time is fucking coming
Lets sit back and just time it
I’ll never stop grindin
Million dollar shows
BMI, it’s a sign and dinner party gold
‘No New Friends’, but ive always been alone
All fake friends talking shit then call my phone
On the weekend, I’m always in the zone
Listen to the tone of my voice, of the sound, of the beat
Now look at your list of your best MCS
I’m coming for the top, not 2, not 3
I’ll do it till I drop 16s , 6feet
I’ll never ever stop
This forever
Forever ever, for ever forever ?
Always three thou. On the beat
Nigga nigga nigga
I’m an out kast nigga
I’m an out kast forever

Hook:
But shoutout to them bitches that be spyin on my site
Shoutout to them niggas that be eyein me in life
Love to them haters, turning fans over night
And I hate a fake fan but my stans are my life
*woah *
