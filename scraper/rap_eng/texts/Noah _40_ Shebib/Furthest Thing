"Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it"
Somewhere between I'm single and committed
It's like I hate you but I still have feelings
All has changed now
She tell me it ain't the same now
I tell you I love you girl
But you take it as game now
I ain't trying play now
I just want this pain out
But I know that you still care
Cause after all we been through we still end up

(Hook)
Talking on the low
Dating on the low
Kissing on the low
Fucking on the low
Loving on the low
Hurting on low
Furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
[We Still Are] Talking on the low
[We Still Are] Dating on the low
[We Still] Kissing on the low
[We Still] Fucking on the low
[We Still Are]Loving on the low
[We Still Are]Hurting on low
[We Still Are] Furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

(Verse)
Girl you got it I just need you
Baby we gon work out
Even if people start the hating
No persuading I want you now
A real woman stays by your side
When everyone's bringing you down
Oh I didn't understand that
Til I started looking around
And I noticed my surroundings
And I looked at you and found me
Cause you would be the only one to support me
When they would doubt me
I'm feeling some type of way
If we go our seperate ways
Lets not bring up yesterday
And lets keep

-(Hook)-

(Bridge)
And I know that these type of things dont last forever
But baby its just too early lets not end it right now

-(Hook Chopped & Screwed) -
