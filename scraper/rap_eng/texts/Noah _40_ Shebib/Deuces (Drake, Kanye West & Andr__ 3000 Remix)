[Intro]
K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
