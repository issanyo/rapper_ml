[Kiid Scoob: Verse 1]
Girl I love yo body, like girls love Beyonce
And I'm tryna get you naughty cause I heard you like to party
And you ain't got no halo so it's no need to be frontin'
But girl I got a big ego and I'm sure that you gon' love it

Pun intended don't get offended
Many women just bitter lemons
Mad still and just won't admit
Cause your last nigga just hit and quit it

And I ain't saying that I'm any different
I been there and i done that
So don't force shit like quarterbacks
Cause I ain't type to really catch feelings

Am I adding fuel to the fire
Telling the ugly truth to these pretty little liars?
No need to dress it up baby save the attire
You're crazy in love and just singing to the quire

You're having mixed emotions, I'm tryna get you open
Maybe I'll kiss you on the lips and take you focus
So baby tell me how you feel
Cause I'm really tryna chill but stay single like dollar bills

[Hook: Toni Blu]
Say my name say my name
When you thinking of me
Tell me that you love me ain't a damn thang changed
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around
Baby girl I'll love love love you down
When no one is around
Baby girl I'll love love, love you down

[Verse 2: Kiid Scoob]
I said girl your irreplaceable
Even though your far from taken
You looking like a dream girl
Every time I see you naked

I love the time that we spend together
But I ain't tryna have kids together
And I ain't tryna have us live together
Cause I feel like being friends are better

Our love is a boat, I keep it a float
Beat it repeat it then leave out the door
Not creeping and scheming to sleep with a ho
I'm chasing the doe she already know

People be praying I reap what I sow
Hating on me I seen it before
Speaking to people on beats what I know
And seeking a show to teach and I go

In, so we gotta stay friends
Cause I can't be your man when I'm tryna be the man
Understand? I just hope you get the message
Cause while I'm making these records you can only come second

I'm just looking at what's ahead of me
Cause Since a child I knew this was my destiny
I said, I'm just looking at what's ahead of me
Cause Since a child, I knew this was my destiny

[Hook]
