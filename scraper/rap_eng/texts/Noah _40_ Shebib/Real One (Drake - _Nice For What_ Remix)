[Intro: Big Freedia]
I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on

Yeah, Vanzetti

Yeah
Got that ounce of that sour diesel
Glad now I couldn't keep you
Happy I found the easel
Pen game renowned and regal
Had no amount of simple
Days, wins now I see you
That nostalgia is see through
Reminiscing to how we would
Bicker and spat now gleeful
Content, loud and cheerful
Hundred now in Phoenix
Passing around the weed dude
Laughing bouncing to Migos
No ones holding me down
I'm bold fully and proud
Ima live that life
Goal's going gold, trials
Tribulations can wait
No sulking been crowned
Since homie was crowning
Feeling how look
Real good, that's what
Ima do, is boast and brag
Till the east coast to the west
Gets the point and never asked
Who Vanzetti is, get that
The answer he's the best
I'm an entity you'll get to see
Essential see, especially
Essential to the game
Remember he's just a

[Hook]
Real one you best respect it
Without a dollar without a cent kid
Ima work till my hand hurts and burst
But I'm rolling first, know I murk each verse
Cause I'm feeling good
And I'm chilling look
At the realist, boy
Halt your feelings of
Hatred and grab a joint
Today at peace level headed with my haters
And together get this paper

This that windows down roll up
With your woman smiling cold ones
In the back of your Corrolla
Sun bright, off your slow job
Type of music
So I enjoy the moment
I can't refuse it
Pre-paparazzi known and
I came to lose it
Switching my policy
Of bitching and starting things
Over again no martyring
But going in sorry bitch
Boldest cemented on this shit
On my bullshit that never gon' quit
Off to roll another spliff better off to go and sit
Chill listen to a kid on his legendary shit
You bet he's very sick allegedly with the wit
Lyrics confirming these things respect's what I'm finna get
I'm hottest out of Phoenix I'm the coldest out of Jers
I'm grinding till I'm leaving a legacy with these words
I'm a ride around these beaches your bay watch her disperse
Give a ride to these bitches my wave they wanna surf

[Bridge: Big Freedia & Letitia Wright]
Uh-huh! (Oh yeah!)
These hoes! (They mad!)
Your boy! (I had!)
I made! (Watch the breakdown)

[Refrain]
Listen to a kid on his legendary shit (What you want, Ima - )
Li - listen to a kid on his legendary shit (What you want, Ima - )
Li - li - listen to a kid on his legendary shit (What you want, Ima - )
Listen to a kid on his legendary shit (What you want, Ima - )

Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta, gotta, gotta g-g-gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta
Gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta, gotta make that jump, jump (let's go)
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, over, over, over, over, lift it up

Bend it over, lift it up (make that jump, jump)
