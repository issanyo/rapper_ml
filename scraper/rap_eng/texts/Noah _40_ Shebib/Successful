[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Yup!
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Drizzy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Aww yeah Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough will solve ya problems, too much will kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all is still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all that's why I strive for it
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I want the money, money, money, I want a whole lot of that
Cause all the honey's, they ask me where the dollars at
Where your head at? Tell me 'bout your scholar cap
Tryna find a way, but you never got a map
Dream chaser, risk taker
No favor, don't hate us
They might want me to drown
Holdin' me down but the throne and the crown
Is all I ever wanted, all I ever needed
If I'm the only one then don't nobody else believe it
Then keep it a secret and watch me achieve it
Cause I know what I want now!
So if you want the money, if you gotta make it
You the only one and don't nobody else believe it
Then tell 'em to beat it and watch you achieve it
Sing it if you want!

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left somethin' in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2"
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got po'd up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantoms leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it, my heart beat slow
And right now, the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week so
It's good but I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want theâ€”

[Outro: Trey Songz & Drake]
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
The oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (yeah, that's all I want man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (you gotta tell 'em, Trey)
Whoa-oh-whoa, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
