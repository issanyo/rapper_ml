[Intro]
She said, "It's crazy how you'd think I would leave without sayin' goodbye"
That's real
I smoke to that tonight

[Verse]
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is king
I got myself three and can't buy a thing
I ain't sayin' I want diamond rings
My life is fine, but all I'm thinkin' 'bout is finer things
Could I be secluded under pressure?
Inducin' in my veins, twenty-two piece in my dresser
I'm choosin' between lesser evils
My old girl tryna bring us together, but we are seperate people
And she left me at the Regal
I ain't wanna see our movie, she ain't wanna see our sequal
Yo, and lately she been actin' so see-through
And argue like a child like we fresh out of a pre-school
I came a long way from stealin' and fightin'
But she always make 'em both seem so enticin'
Invite me to her crib after fuckin' with the lightin'
Then go bitin' on my ears like she fuck with Mike Tyson
But then things turn sour
After the foreplay and four hours, all she got is more power
Or at least more perspective
Talk about her body and how I don't respect it
I take the exit, she get drunk textin'
Recollectin' past situations in the present
Which I guess make me the asshole
Say that I'ma change, but she know my past so
She know I didn't do it for the last hoe
And I ain't sayin' she a hoe, but she mad cold
I swear I get the chills when I hug her
My daddy thought she was cool and I was cool with her mother
I loved her like we was grown, she went away after summer
I started creepin' around, the secrets came out the covers
I slipped up, we part ways
Yeah, we move on, but my heart remains
I caught the fade, I maintain with my chest out
Lyin' to my homeboys like she ain't the best out
But really, it's stressful
Sometimes the love of your life, is unsuccessful

[Outro]
I said this shit get stressful, girl
Sometimes the love of your life, is unsuccessful
