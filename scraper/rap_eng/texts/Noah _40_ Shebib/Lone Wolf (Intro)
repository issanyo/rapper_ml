[Intro]
(Howlin', howlin')
Howlin' in the night better get it right
(Yeah we, yeah we)
Yeah we see the light and it brings delight
(Lookin', lookin')
Lookin' at the moon and we come alive
(Come and, Come and)
Come and fuck with us we the young and bright

So bitch sit down, bow to the crown
We don't wanna put another man in the ground
It's the sac town, the love goes around, But
(Are you, are you)
Are you gonna fuck with the sound? Huh?!

[Refrain]
(Well if I can spend the twenty on jack and make it back to the dorm by the morning Ima be alright)x2

[Verse]
So here we are so bizarre, like the czar
Then he come and make some hits then he gone, Barry Bonds
But I never did no wrong with a beat or a song, its just
Sometimes you don't have to sing along, just listen I'm lifted

But all the different people at the party acting shifty
And I don't talk to people when I'm focused I'm busy
Pulling influence from others when I'm making history
So you don't have to sing along yeah just listen

[Outro]
(Just listen, Yeah, just listen) x4
What's the last song you play before you die?
What's the last song you play before you die?
What's the last song you play before you cry?
What's the last song you play before you die?
