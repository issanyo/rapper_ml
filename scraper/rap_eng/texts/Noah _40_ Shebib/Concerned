[Opening - The Delfonics]
Hey love (hey love)
Turn your head around (turn your head around)
Take off that frown
Your in love
(x2)

[Chorus - Mark Morrison]
Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as I said the story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real
(x2)

[Verse 1 - Xero]
We're all here, the party starts, we're gettin' near
To disappear, then reappear, to interfere
In a world of fake rappers, naysayers and gun clappers
Makes it difficult to trust, with lyin' from fake trappers
Bullet-holes in the wall, empty halls, acting banal
The bad side of Chicago mistaken for Port-O-Call
And life being demitted, a bullet for every shoe
Still no one can find the guys, why's everyone asking who?
Oh Juan, a lot's changed since the day you left
In our chests and in the world, make us all feel depressed
And compressed, I know you wanted us to all be okay
But still nothing is quite the same, without you here everyday
Here we go, still a quarter to go
Extra point, field goal below, feels like you're all alone
A lone, but not alone, we're home but in the zone
Prone to be atone, hitta but not Patron
I never thought I would call myself a creator
I never thought I would see myself shinin', being something greater
I never thought I would see myself posted up in the studio
Never had I'd thought I'd be bringing so many haters
Executive set production, exclusive to my own brand
Never signin' a contract I'm staying a free man
Shorthand contraband, the ghost writing was planned
Am I the only one who still writes his own hand to meet demands?

[Chorus - Mark Morrison]
Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as I said the story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real
(x2)

[Verse 2 - Mr Shammi]
Tonight we run this place (Oh aye oh)
I know everybody's feeling irate
We'll jump to outer space (Oh aye oh)
So don't be afraid to go a little crazy
Walking out the club from my limousine
Bouncing on the dance floor
Like it is a trampoline
Going up and down from the ground
We will listen to the sound
Feel like Neil Armstrong, so high up off the ground
(Jump jump)

[Chorus - Mark Morrison]
Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as I said the story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real
(x2)
