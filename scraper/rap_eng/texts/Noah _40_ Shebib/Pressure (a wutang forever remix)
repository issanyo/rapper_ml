[ Verse 1: Chukka Loe]

Started from back
Wanna jump to the front
I ain't even gonna front, from the jump
Always Dreamed about this rap shit
Steady rapping bout trap shit
But what the hell you think?
When these niggas grew up on the streets
From that north side to the south side
To the east to the west side
Everybody got pride
And Some niggas died
Then you gotta decide what the fuck life about
The devil always in and out
And you wonder why a nigga , wanna take the easy route
And yeah I'm tempted right along with criminals
Shit.....they just got caught
Them my type of thoughts
Getting high with crew...On some crew love shit
She ain't loving  the crew
Cause I don't bring her around... but she down
Shit..... and it's a cruel wold
And smack dab in the middle of it

All this shit  on my mind
Always finds a way into my rhymes
All these niggas say they ain't trying, but they lying
Girls  lying on they back
What's is love, just that
And I ain't speaking real shit for the fun it
If there's a line for real rap
Bitch I'm in front of it

Real shit nigga


Been a long day(2x)
I ain't smoke all day
GO away(2x)
