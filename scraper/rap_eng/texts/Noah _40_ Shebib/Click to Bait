[Intro: NFKRZ]
Yeah
Oh man
This ones out to everybody who said I do click-bait
Hey listen

[Verse 1: NFKRZ]
I learned my game from all the best
So you can never check me
Click to bait
All my caps title is in your "Suggested"
Click to bait
Just check out all these bare views I'm getting
Click to bait like Leafy did it in '16, '17
Woah
I see them say that I'm the biggest cancer
I guess they just don't see the shit people be making
I might annoy you with that YouTube recommendation
Your comments are so dumb
Boy get some punctuation
I made a video a while ago about this kid
Who faked his own fucking death during a YouTube stream
9 thousand dislikes, going up
And guess what I get? A thousand comments saying that I'm doing click-bait shit
This one is for all the dumbfucks who can't bother to watch the vid for longer than one second, and another
Another idiot will say that I'm baiting
But when I see your shit I'm not even hesitating
I swear to got y'all pissing me off with the hypocrisy
Some people can click-bait so much and get away with it
And I'm just siting here with this one hated vid, well thank you for that YouTube revenue, bitch, huh

[Hook 1: NFKRZ]
I'm on the bottom of the YouTube food chain
Still earning more than you at the age of 18
I got my subs behind my back and I'm not scared of anything
I can not give 2 fucks about you complaining
You say that I copy Leafy? Well I'm just doing my thing
He found the algorithm
I'm not here to bitch and complain
But I see your type and spot you in the comments right away
With your emojis and "kys", if I was you I'd be ashamed

[Verse 2: NFKRZ]
I swear to god your copying accusations and are retarded
You'd probably say that Luther King was a copy of Gandhi
You are the type of dude to say that Lenin copied Marx
Get outta here, cunt, go back to your YouTube gods
I'm not the one to be the role model here, for sure, but don't act surprised when I come knocking at your door
I'll shove this mixtape in your face and tell you "read this!"
Yeah I come door to door like I'm Jehovah's Witness
But I ain't no boy-scout
There's no time left to waste
Ain't got no cookies in my backpack
Got a fucking blade
I'll break inside and hold you at a gunpoint forever
Till you accept NFKRZ as your god and savior
I guess I'm getting corny here
But hear my message
Unlike you prick I can write a proper fucking sentence
All of your shitty arguments are gone right now
How does it feel do be destroyed by a foreigner? Huh?

[Hook 2: NFKRZ]
Got vids in the making
Going click to bait
There's nothing that I'm faking
Going click to bait
You cunts should stop deciding my own fate
Til' the end of times
I'm making that click-bait
Huh

[Outro: NFKRZ]
Yeah
It's time for you kids to be taught a lesson
