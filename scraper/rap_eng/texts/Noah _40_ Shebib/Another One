[Verse 1]
She loves the way I love her
She don't know what she would do
Sometimes we take our clothes off
And find the naked truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Never did I think I'd lose your love
The hell was I thinking of?  Oh baby
Never did I think I'd lose your love
Oh well, guess I didn't think enough, no

[Chorus]
When I made love to another one
Someone that wasn't you
And I may find me another one
But it won't be another you, you
You, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Her body keeps a secret
That was only meant for you
Sometimes we take our clothes off, yeah
And find a naked truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Never did I think I'd lose your love
The hell was I thinking of?  Oh baby
Never did I think I 'd lose your love
Oh well, guess I didn't think enough, no

[Chorus]
When I made love to another one
Someone that wasn't you
And I may find me another one
But it won't be another you, you

[Bridge]
Cause I wasn't me
That wasn't you
How many times before did I ignore
The fact I'm not invincible
And oh, I'm saying what's real
Can't even imagine how you are feeling

[Chorus]
When I made love to another one
Someone that wasn't you
And I may find me another one
But it won't be another you, you
You, you, you, you
