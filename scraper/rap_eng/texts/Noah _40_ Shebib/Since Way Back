Part I

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah
(Crowd Talking)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gotta listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you donâ€™t know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you, girl, I know you

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours

[Verse 2: Drake]
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
Yeah, you know already
Tell you what's not yours
Tell you what's not yours

Part II

[Verse 3: Drake]
Six months since I've been back in the Six
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

[Bridge: Drake]
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been

[Verse 4: Drake]
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

[Bridge: Drake]
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
R. Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
