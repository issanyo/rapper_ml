[Verse 1: Ambizzy]
Oh and it's your time cause I made songs but shouts to you, How you made all what you dreamed of and inspired me to. And there's been hard times but we pull through cause that's how we do. And there's been times and still times where it's all fell through. Best friend since a young age you helped me work at each page, November 23rd you made sure that that day was my day. Story books to catalogues that shit was real, and them credit cards and them fancy cars you said they evil. So now I thank you and you made me i'm a strong man but your baby,  Money we both lack but it's all good cause still breath. Food is so basic my life now is changing and my one fan you tell me If i try hard enough i'll make it. My first job was my dream job and I got that cause you prayed. Now I stand firm in my stride cause my foundations you laid it. So I thank you and I love you as much as much as your friends do so well known up in your group and I Just can't help but smile at you. We'll get there when I got that I promise you that i'm on that. Work on my agenda when I get big you get all that but it'sall good Now I see a light the one you showed me and said there's alright So now this is that alright it's all good cause it's your time girl I love ya

(Chorous)
Oh and it's your time cause you lived life and we've been through some rough times I gotchya
Dear Mom
Dear Mom
Dear Mom It's for you Ohh

You pray that I get there when I get there you'll be there I gotchya
And Dear mom
And Dear Mom

[Verse2: Ambizzy]
Now it's a new year that new start That fresh page Oh it's my time And 2013's a bad start cause money's never been so tights. It's first time in ages i've tucked into that change box to get you your papers for whatever tobacco that you got. But money seems worthless cause we value each other. Mother and son no matter how far that we under, Some Bills in the post and alotta money I owe but I'll hold off alla my debts just to see you wake up in the morn' And our babies are growing but damn still cost us alot, but Christmas came early this year as a gift in a new cot. Your so happy your son he's a daddy one more time and even though he fucks up you understand he's only trying. And your other son he so in Love but seems that he an outcast, he wants work just so he can get alla his accounts back and when he told me I inspired him man that hit. Oh and it's real now cause we family and mistakes we do proudly. We gotchyu to help us learn about what we can be. So this here I thank you to a real women a fan to and in 5 years it takes long i'll carry on with my songs your dream house I'll buy that cause your one women my strengths on I gotchyu

(Chorous)
Oh and it's your time cause you lived life and we've been through some rough times I gotchya
Dear Mom
Dear Mom
Dear Mom It's for you Ohh

You pray that I get there when I get there you'll be there I gotchya
And Dear mom
And Dear Mom
