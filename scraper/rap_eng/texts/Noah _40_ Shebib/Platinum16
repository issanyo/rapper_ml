When I was 16
Spittin' nun but 16's
My vans dirty, jeep clean
I got bitches on they knees
We know they ready to sleaze
Man that shit really at ease
They don't won't nothin' wit P L A T
And I'm holding the game with a super tight squeeze yeah yeah

Girls show me they chi chis and they ain't from my city
You a snake you ain't wit me
I know that I can be witty
They say I ain't clever
My bitches so hot they make ghost peppers jealous
I'm running on hoes like Jerome Bettis
I'll beat ya ass like ya momma until you know better

Till you muthafucking know better
I put all my money inside of the fridge
Now that's what you call some cold cheddar, yeah okay
Belt might be Gucci or so Hermes yeah I swear to plat
I run for a check like Kobe from Permian yeah okay

K K K K K K K K!

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2]
Getting this money I earned this shit
School work I'll burn that shit
Childish act shawty I'll cut that shit
Play with that pussy like an accordion
They is my sons and I am the guardian
If you can't finish it don't even start the shit
Schooling niggas wit a scholarship
Man I know it's hard as shit
You fake man it is obvious
I got platinum on my muthafucking wrist aye
I got platinum on my muthafucking wrist
He said he looking for revenge
Man he mad cause I gave his wife that plat dick
Coming in the game wit a twist
I'm genius they say we some lunatics
Kylie I know you just want this dick
Platzus potter she ain't rode a broomstick

[Outro]
Yeah, aye Platication!
