Ayo time to bring that real shit back
I'm about throw a fit
The whole  world is upside down
What kind of jail is this
It's easy I could make 1 diss
Now you irrelevant
Meek get your shit together
Don't change for a bitch
The dreams worth more than the money
Just use your common sense
I just got hip to future
Drinking dirty sprite
You just got hip to sneakers
Rocking dirty nikes
I been on some 2.3 shit
Since they murdered mike
Pops
For that ring

Hate cops that's my thing

The return of Esco
Owen heart in the ring
Catch me slipping
Use that pound you
Will not hear a ring
I'm back nigga
Playing back to back
Mad ting
And I ain't dissing nobody
I'm just doing my thing
An agitator Addict
What the fuck did yall think
Niggas is soft
I'm wasting my lyrics
To get at yall
Now that we got the fuckery
Out the way let's evolve


â„¢Somany on the way
Sincere playing belly
2 shots for 2Pac
The don and makevellie
Cool out
I used country gramma
More than nelly
My tools out
Cuz every  day
The coppas try to get me
Black lives don't matter
Malcolm X out the tele
With that ak forty 7
Push your melon
Call me   Betsy
Don dadda
They even came for dudas
Out the county
Big poppa
Got killed
Going back
Where niggas left him

Heres an
Offer
I'm just author
Claiming independence
The foolish  man dem
Rather war
And get a lengthy sentence
Oh did I mention
These are cowards
ThAt are just pretending
A living legend
Give em bars
I'm just here for vengeance
