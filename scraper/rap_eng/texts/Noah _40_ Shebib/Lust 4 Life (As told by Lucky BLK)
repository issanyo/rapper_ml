[Verse: Lucky BLK]

I tried to do it all tonight, i got plans/
But everything ain't go as right, as i plan/
I got a certain Lust 4 Life, and as it stands/
Yea even though life ain't right, i understand/
Yea I understand, Life is nothing but a dream homie/
Wishing all your life, for things just to move slowly/
As you coast with nothing to even show for/
Family hate the way you live you live cuz you living real poor/
Like E's on report cards, i mean i use to be a benchwarmer/
Got fly, caught swag, now I'm the motherfuckin man, a hot spitter/
You rappers can die quicker, Lucky Black/ Baby
Never been a pussy ass nigga cuz i stand on my own two/
Got to much life to live, worrying bout what you wanna do/
Nigga what you gon do is the best question/
Why So Serious? Is my next question/
My nigga do the math. Add, dont subtract/
If you looking for the goods, i got it in the Luey Bag/
Shoulder strapped-tech with the beam on it/
You got hit? My bad, that shit sting dont it?/
My girl loves me, so i gotta put a ring on it/
Left the club, went straight to the studio/
Did 5 tracks before 3, i call it rappin'/
But you niggas acting real slow, what the fuck you mean "You ain't know"/
Im up next! Thats how the story goes/
A King without his thrown, but still stay loyal to his home/
EBF stand up! Lucky Starz put me on/
Thats what up! Look up, it's a plane/
But i wrote this song before i touched down/
On my way to Ft. Lauderdale, i went to A-Town/
Met a bad lil shawty and i was given my crown/
My G's love me, cuz they know i hold it down/
I hold ya'll down...

Throw ya love up in the air...
Throw ya love up in the air for her...
Throw ya love up in the air...
Throw ya love up...
