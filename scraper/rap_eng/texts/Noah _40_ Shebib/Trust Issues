So I look up into your eyes
You know you're looking fine
I like that red dress
Imma slap you on the ass
Take her to my bedroom
So we can get freaky
I got a bottle of champagne
So we can get a little freaky
I'll get you a little drunk
So you don't be sober
I got a Trojan in my drawer
Bout to pull it out and show you
But I ain't gon use it
Imma make you my baby momma
Cause black niggas that's what they do
They get baby mommas
So I'm gettin all this money
Fucking bitches for a living
Getting money for a living
And I got a gun in my nighttable
(?)
I got a AK in my closet
Don't make me pull it out and use it on you
I got a BMW parked in my driveway
Imma show you how I do it my way

Andres is a fuck nigga
He a fatass nigga
He should keep his ass in Colorado
Fuck Andres nigga
