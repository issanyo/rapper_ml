[Verse 1: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I’m from
I’mma sip until I feel it, I’mma smoke it 'til it’s done

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love

[Verse 3: Drake]
And I don’t really give a fuck and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told you

[Verse 4: The Weeknd]
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well baby girl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her

[Hook: Drake & The Weeknd]
I popped one
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh girl, I'm on one
Fuck it, I popped one

[Verse 5: Drake]
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, fuck it I’m on one
Fuck it, I popped one
I popped one

[Verse 6: The Weeknd]
Girl, I'm lying, I'm on a few
Don't you worry, this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot?
I'm on eviction number 2
Cause I popped one

[Break: The Weeknd]
Fuck it I popped one
Trust issues

[Verse 7: Drake]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So, you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
Oh

[Verse 8: The Weeknd]
Do you know what's going on over here
[I do, I do, I do]
Have you even bothered to look?
[I did, Oh I did]
Well if you know, then let me know
We don't gotta be running in these circles
In these circles, no more
Trust Issues

[Verse 9: Drake]
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the mothafucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make them like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you, in you
Woah, trust issues
