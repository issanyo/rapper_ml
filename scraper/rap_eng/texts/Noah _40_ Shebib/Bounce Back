[Verse 1: Brian]
Yeah, welcome to the chaos
Glad to have you
Before I start, just know that I ain't laughing at you
It's a spiritual battle
Cause we fight over for something that really matters
Bar after bar, it's the same 'ol, same 'ol
They already heard it, yeah they know
Man, pick up that bible
Have you read that in a while?
Man, I heard your track, I smiled
Cause boys will boys, and that's their choice
I rap to praise the God that made
And stand up to those that hate me
That's okay though
Hit me up if you wanna make up
Before you make another fake up
Griffin Mission Studios made so I can rap
But it's against my morals so I won't attack
Just remember I'm not like that
So from me, you won't get a diss track

[Verse 2: Ethan]
You shouldn't asked for us to fire back please
I don't really want to lead others to our emotions please
I'll tell one emotion that I really need - love
Cause with that I can at least dream
That everyone including you can be beside the king
And dreams don't happen with baggin girls and smokin' trees
I promise you that sideways ain't gonna get on their knees
I would rather follow the God that lets us breathe
To go follow him is no fee
It's like being a light in these dark streets
Yeah I love you guys, thanks for giving us the chance to share the gospel with you
He didn't just save a guy who had flu
He saved a guy that really just died
And He made people turn sinful ways to the side
And yes I know I'm just passing by
At least I can tell you that God's love is not something you can buy

[Verse 3: Brian]
Man, I don’t do this for you
I do this for me
Make a battle rap, I'll’ turn the other cheek
See, you’re not hurting me
Not even to this degree
Why is that even fun to you?
Please just know that I’ll be praying for you
Matter fact, do you wanna use my studio?
I’m not gonna go down the wrong road
I do this for release, not really for you
You gotta hear what Jesus did for you
Most important thing is gonna be on track seven
Cause there I’ll  show you how to get to heaven
I really needed a feature a song too
So I ain’t gonna oppose you
Just remember that I wanted you to see the simple truth I do
And that Jesus loves you
