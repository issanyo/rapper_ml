[Verse 1]

Doesn't make sense now yeah
Shit just got real and it's getting intense now
I don't mean to sound hard on the call but it's hard right now
Since you've been gone I'm just sittin' on my own right now, yeah

Swear I'm not the same like I used to, oh
Said I've been complaining way more than I used to, oh
Lately I've been sippin' much more than I used to
Never wanted something so much more than I used to

Spillin' all these words that we said that we would never mean now it's clear to see
Things will never be the same as it like it used to be
But now it's Hennessy
Swear, I tried make an effort on it but I know, you see, that you won't believe

[Hook]

I know it's hard but now i'm sayin'
You should come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
Needin' you right now with me
Been different bet you won't believe
All I'm saying now is
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
There's problems that we've got to leave
There's problems that we've got to leave

[Interlude]

Shit just got real and it's getting intense now
Since you've been gone I'm just sittin' on my own right now, yeah
Said I've been complaining way more than I used to, oh
Never wanted something so much more than I used to
