[Verse 1]

Why everything I try to do
A fuckin' problem
Everybody got answers
Still can't fuckin' solve em
He keep flowin' and rowin'
In tears that he harbor
Empty pockets makes
Empty mind Even harder
Far from his father
Distance from his mother
One of four kids
He be the oldest brother
Family speaks failure
Execute his dreams
But ask why you stopped dancing
I thought that was ya thing
Dreams crushed so pen pushing
Was all that's left for me
I cry ink and I think
And that might Be whats best for me
Pain plus divided pages
Rationalize whats left of me
I swear stress and pressure
Is bound to be the death of me
But Lord knows
I'm trying rewrite my destiny
Parallel parasail
Fly, but falling endlessly
I'm fucked up and I wanna
Tell my friends about it
But they going through so
My pain I feel they best with out it
Niggas think you living
Till you dying
And until you leave em out
Ya will they think you lying
Most wanna add
You on Facebook
But when shit hit the fan
You know face turn to fakebook
Damn
Had to block
My moms From my post
Ma you know I'm grown
And you be doin' the most
And I found my Cinderella
At the ball
But i fucked up and Lost her slipper
Trynna' ball
So now I bagged but she don't Really
Know if I'm the one
Is he really prince Aladdin
Or just a bum
But would it be wrong
If Mr.Right come
Baby don't do me left
Pick the right one


[Verse 2]

And damn where
These chicks Come from
Flock in left and right
So I duck hunt them
Shoot em down
Shoot em down
Says the king
Without a crown
But my queen is dying
To have one
She live the hardest life
Expecting me to save her
We the child of destiny
But I can't cater
No help with issues
Like calling in for an Acer
I know she don't OD
But swallow stress with a chaser
Coco loso drive me loco
But I don't drink
And she do but I'm 21 tho
I think it's cause inside
I fear my fate is failure
But add toxins
I lose my time barrier
Wanna be her support
So I can carrier her
And prove I can do me
To spite the harriers
And I can't
Get a job
In this area
New Nightmares
Of nearing nothing
Get scarier
I got dreams money can buy
I know money can buy dreams
But will i survive
I can hardly decide
Whether to make it off
Of tracks or jobs applied
Do I have choice
I guess I'm reaching
To whoever can hear my voice
I wonder if I'll never know
I type tap jot and
You enjoy the show
