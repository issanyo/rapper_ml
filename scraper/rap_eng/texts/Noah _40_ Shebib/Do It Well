[Verse 1]
You're the only one I can talk to, yeah
And I ain't gotta talk to you, yeah
I'll even shut up if you want to, want to, yeah
I spend my time watching you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you tell me just lay back
And you go to work
And you're working
Yeah, you're working
And I know you're 'bout your business
So go to work, yeah
I'm feeling fucked up, still love fucking
I ain't throwing money in the air for nothing

[Chorus]
I do it 'cause you
You do it well
So well, so well, so well, yeah
You, you do it well
So well that you can bill me
For the only therapy I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Therapy I know, I know
And you're the only therapy I know

[Verse 2]
You're the only one I can talk to
And I ain't gotta talk to you
Things I only tell you in the night time, baby
While I'm sitting here watching you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you tell me just lay back
And you go to work
And you're working
Yeah, you're working
And I know you're 'bout your business
So go to work
I'm feeling fucked up, still love fucking
I ain't throwing money in the air for nothing

[Chorus]
I do it 'cause you
You do it well
So well, so well, so well, yeah
You, you do it well
So well that you can bill me
For the only therapy I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Therapy I know, I know
And you're the only therapy I know

[Outro]
You are my therapy
You are my therapy
