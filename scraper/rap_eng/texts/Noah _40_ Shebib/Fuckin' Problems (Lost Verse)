[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember, being young, dumb, looking for the next thrill
Angry adolescents, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you

[Hook: 2 Chainz, (Drake) & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Picture perfect, uh huh
And I paint a perfect picture, my intention's to get richer
But I ain't tryna split the profit with ya
Every pocket on me bleeds, I'm a selfish ass nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us
Or maybe the white on white, Ku and Klux
Head all in the bathroom
Beg for it, I'll be back soon
Fuckin' problem, fuck your problems
I got my own but one ain't a dollar
I got five phones for five different reasons
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas
Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza
Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear
One on both arm but need two pair, I beast

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya, beast

[Hook]
