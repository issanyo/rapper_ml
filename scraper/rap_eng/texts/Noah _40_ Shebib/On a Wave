[Verse 1: Kiana Ledé]
You know that people gon' change
Feelings they all seem to fade
Lovers they all drift away
And become so damn estranged

[Pre-Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Friends flip they turn into foes
But humble and quiet no more
Even as life seems to fade

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I'm still alive/I'm on a wave
I'm on a ride/I'm everywhere
I'm hard to find/Don't need a man
Ain't got the time/Busy as fuck
You know what's up/Stay on my grind
But I still play/These niggas hearts
I never stay (yeah)/I'm out of love
Just thinkin' of/Me n' mine, me n'mine

[Verse 2: Drake]
You finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year

[Kiana Ledé]
I'm tired of talkin' it out
I just left my clothes at you're house

[Drake]
Seems like you're wantin' to stay

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé + Drake]
But you need to know
I'm on a wave/I'm on a ride (ride)
I'm everywhere/I'm hard to find (I'm hard to find)
Don't want a man/I'm just a guy/ you're just a guy
Busy as fuck (busy as fuck)
You know what's up (you know what's up)

[Verse 3: Drake]
And I got a life now
Back where I stay (back where I stay)
Still pay a car note for this girl around my way (around my way)

[Kiana Ledé]
Yeah 11x

[Pre-Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Friends flip
They turn into foes
But humble and quiet no more
Even as life seems to fade

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I'm still alive/I'm on a wave
I'm on a ride/I'm everywhere
I'm hard to find/Don't need a man
Ain't got the time/Busy as fuck
You know what's up/Stay on my grind
But I still play/These niggas hearts
I never stay (yeah)/I'm out of love
Just thinkin' of /Me n' mine, me n' mine

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I'm on a wave/I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere /I'm hard to find
Don't need a man/Ain't got the time
Busy as fuck/You know what's up
