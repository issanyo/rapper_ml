Having conversations
With (momma)
She said she been
Thinking a lot about daddy
Said he visit at night
And these days
It's kinda hard
To turn out
The lights
But you know the devil
Known for
Messing with a mans wife
Infidel with two horns
16 with a newborn
Leaves a future torn
Separated between 2 men
Good sides & the Evil
The pain I endure
Gets to your umbilical
Though what
We face is
Medieval
I got you
Covered like
Prudential
For good talks and motivations
Essential
Thru nourishment & encouragement
Go be influential
Young man
First to reach
This hell
We call heaven
Or this heaven
That
We call hell
Either way
I can't tell
But I will tell you this;
It's gon' be a hard life
So go cook
Hard twice
& Get chu to pots
Like it?
They not!
But they got to love it
When it bubble up
& turn to rock
Cause he that
Stands over the stove
When it's heat
In the kitchen
Can
Pay
You
To do the dishes
I'm not just being (momma)
Got this game from my (momma)
She got it from her (momma)
Together
We all good (mommas)
That represent the few
(Mommas)
That care about
Their sons
And avoiding
Theirs young
Daughters being (mommas)
Before it's their
Chance to learn (momma)
Nature
So don't think
(Momma) hate cha
She just want you
To listen to (momma)
So that another (mommas)
Son
Won't remove mine off (mommas) land
And (momma) has to get
(Mommas) gun
And start a brand new band
So as (momma) works
To show you a (mommas) worths
Stay off
(Mommas) nerves
Son
