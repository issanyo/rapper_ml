[Verse: Dynasty]
Once again it be the ghost that gotta nigga to jump
I'm the nigga preaching hope & y'all related to Trump
& I don't really like to gloat but y'all be making me stunt
Sacrificing all my morals, y'all be making me bunt
Getting faded off the roc and now I'm rolling a blunt
Wonder how he keep it real & get the people to bump
Fuck if niggas wanna recognize the skill now
I got the fam, real fans & they still round
I know you thinking Ima slip but my grip so G. I
Fire from the lip, grab a clip like T. I
Gotta let it rip, that's a hit like B. I
Metaphors sick, I'm the shit, you could see why
Gimme the award, Rivera with the form
Pitching out the heat, this is the era of the storm
Thunderclap rap, under that mat
I'm the key, guarantee I gotta cover that track
It's bigger than a pun
A nigga havin fun
If rap is my religion, gotta kick it to a nun
Shittin on my lungs
That's a matter of tree
Light skin tellin Jimmy he ain't blacker than me
Harden after the 3
I be cookin it up
They be hearing the bars then they be lookin it up
Like nigga who in the fuck
This nigga dynasty's up?
How he shooting for the stars coming outta the tuck
Bout to knuckle the puck
I'm the mightiest duck
& that's word to Bombay, got a swagger like Russ
This ain't OKC
Nigga Do Re Mi
Keep the rhythm rather raw, word to ODB
Shout to Lox
Now replace that O, YOU gon get this work
You gon love this show
