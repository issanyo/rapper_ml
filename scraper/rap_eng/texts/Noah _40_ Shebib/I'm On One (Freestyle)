[Intro]
Put em up
Now put em up
MMG (Now put em up)

[Verse 1]
I don’t know what these haters be talking I pop any chick that I want
Put your girl in the back of that ‘Bach main two reasons she ain’t gone front
I Minaj with her and her friend, put my main homie on one
But my neck and wrist so stupid and my pockets be on so dumb
Because I’m on one
Haters we never condone em
Penthouse full of some bad bitches
Me and my homies gon' show em something, it’s MMG
Ridin' round in this Lambo goin ham dog on Collins
And I’m leaning off of that purple shit
So don’t judge me like your honor, oh!

[Hook]
I’m feeling so cold, yeah we riding dirty but the whip clean
But think a couple years ago, I was in a cell when I was 18
And whats up with these new bitches, and why they all wanna fuck so easy
And whats up with these new niggas, and why they all wanna talk so greasy

[Verse 2]
But get it why you here boy
Cus I got that money to make you disappear boy
It's on my mind don’t make me put it on your head boy
I been superfly since Rozay took me to that clear port
Ahh nigga what you know about that
Riding round town with like 4 or 5 straps
Truck full of raw and we dipping from the law
I just came from the cell I ain’t going right back
Pull up in a Benz they ain’t gon' like that
Box these niggas they’ll never fight back
Diamonds on my neck, and my wrist white black
And I’m killing these niggas I ain’t even write that
I be stunting cuz I ain’t never had
Got these bitches waving like they tryna catch a cab
They wanna fuck a nigga good so they can touch a bag
She had the nerve to say she love me and I fuckin' laughed
