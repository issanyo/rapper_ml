[Chorus - Resampled from Gave Your Love Away]
But I had to throw it all away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave, I gave your love away
I said I love you

[Bridge - Resampled from Phases]
Almost quit on myself
It felt like it was over

[Chorus - Resampled from Gave Your Love Away]
But I had to throw it all away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave, I gave your love away
I said I love you
