[Verse 1: Majid Al Maskati]
Everybody's on the wall
Waiting on some alcohol
Nobody here wants to talk
No one's on the dance floor
I don't plan on leaving soon
How 'bout we switch up the mood?
I really like your attitude
So why don't we take the leap?

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
Live in the moment with me
Live in the space between
Live in the moment with me
Live in the space between (space between)

[Verse 2: Majid Al Maskati]
I been a lot of places
Seen a lot of faces
I can feel the mood shift
So why don't we take the leap?

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
Live in the moment with me
Live in the space between (space between)
Live in the moment with me
Live in the space between (space between)
Live in the moment with me
Live in the space between
Live in the moment with me
Live in the space between (space between)

[Bridge: Majid Al Maskati]
Come together
Everyone show some love
Have some fun, have some fun
Come together
Everyone, everyone
Show some love
Have some fun, have some fun

[Refrain: Majid Al Maskati]
Live in the space between
Live in the space between
Live in the space between
Someone take my hand
Make you understand
Live in the moment with me

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
Live in the moment with me
Live in the space between (space between)
Live in the moment with me
Live in the space between (space between)

[Outro: Majid Al Maskati]
Live in, live in, live in
