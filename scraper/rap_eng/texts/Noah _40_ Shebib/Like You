Intro
I'm just gonna practice run
When you hold me like that
When you hold me like that

Verse 1
You know that I've been thinking
I've adopted remiscing
To feel the things I have not felt with nobody else

Girl you read through all my harsh words
And you still come back to calm me
I know I make it hard girl I'm so different

Ever since I've started tripping
Losing all intuition
You stay right here beside me you're so different

Hook
I need, someone like you
I need, someone like you
I need, someone like you
I need, someone like you

Verse 2
You always know what gets me
Right back into my vices
You fight me tryna save me when I'm feeling fervent

I try to make it easy
For us to coexist girl
I try to say the right things but I always fall short

I know you want me to know
You love me cause I always
Forget what I mean to you I'm so distant

Hook
I need, someone like you
I need, someone like you
I need, someone like you
I need, someone like you
