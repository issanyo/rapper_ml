Here we go...

So I traveled back in time right?
Traveled back in time like...
Michael j. but not who you think...
Now I'm in the air.... flight 23
Covert chilling in the aisle seat...
Took a glance up we in aisle 3
Section A...man she's so pretty...
Popped a lot with my gloc
Everybody's in shock...
Pure darkness sparked what was in my heart...
Sheer anger mentality of a shark... I smell blood
So you know it's all about to start....
One last look at her soul that was all I could see...
I got the feeling she knew we were destined to be...
With that fuel I got to moving like a vehicle....
Unbuckled my safety belt.. heard a click and pop...
So I stopped for a minute to glance saw my chance
Advanced slowly but steadily....felt the knife in my pants
And....asked myself am I really ready to kill a man? mannnn....
Mayday mayday we're under attack
I knifed his neck and snapped it like a freakin snapback...
So much force I swear I felt that mug snapback....
But then I snapped back..... into reality....
Faced the actuality.... it's ME that I'm battling...
What you want me to do?
I really love that girl....
I felt the pain of the truth...I'm not a killer....
So her blood's spilling...Aaliyah forgive me...
