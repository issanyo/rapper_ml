[Verse 1]
Having hallucinations
I'm losing sleep every night
Keep trying to cover my eyes
My eyes, yeah
Is it my imagination?
I think I'm losing my mind
Still see your face all the time
All the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna rewind 'til we're back where we started
Yeah that's all I want
And night after night after night I'm still haunted
I'm haunted, baby
I'm haunted by you, you
Fall asleep and dream of you, you
Late at night I scream for you, you
Waiting on a deja-vu
But until then

[Chorus]
I live with hallucinations
They're just hallucinations
I'll just hallucinate
'Cause you're not here
Hallucinations

[Verse 2]
Losing my concentration
Hearing your voice in my head
Seeing you when you aren't there
You're not there
And I can't keep living like this
Something's gotta give (give me you)
If I could make it all go away
Then I would

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna rewind 'til we're back where we started
Yeah that's all I want
And night after night after night I'm still haunted
I'm haunted, baby
I'm haunted by you, you
Fall asleep and dream of you, you
Late at night I scream for you, you
Waiting on a deja-vu
But until then

[Chorus]
I live with hallucinations
(Fall asleep and dream of you, you)
They're just hallucinations
(Late at night I scream for you, you)
I'll just hallucinate
(Waiting on a deja-vu)
'Cause you're not here
Hallucinations
