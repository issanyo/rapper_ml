[Verse 1: Nuevo]
Forever thought I'd be locked into the perception
I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the fire comes and you see it from this perspective with bullshit with people who just be sending a message
Jay did you get the message?
Cause I been touching road so I didn't get it
I mean dudes is funny thinking they're better
But I bless the pen with each and evey letter
You lookin bank cause from here I can tell you a teller
Ex messed me over I think I deserve better
You listening to me like you've never heard better
I love her and I wouldn't hurt her ever
Im fed up with these dudes crooked ways
You need help they the type to look away
Where was you at when I needed the time of day
Where was you at when all the others walked away
I been acting senseless
Counting like consensus
Really I'm just helpless
Wanna be the next Elvis
I need to sell this
On my kline like Calvin
Rip, thats a shout out out to Devlin
Im glad she wants me
Now she wants to flaunt me
All this ice she bought me
By tomorrow she'll drop me
I hope she locks me
I know I sound cocky
Crazy train like Ozzy
Hands up, leave calmly
Leave calmly
