Fresh fitted polo, fresh hair cut
Crack a bottle of rosé, drink up
I’ve got my party people with me, reppin’ News Team
And I’ma stay reppin’ till the very death of me
Yeah, and that’s just standard everywhere we go
Building up my brand name like it’s fucking Lego
‘Cause this another building block until I reach the top
The only thing I’ll fear then is if I ever drop
Pop, another cork, this is all I’ll know
So welcome to the good life now ‘cause I’m bout my dough
Maybe it’s ‘cause I work in payroll that I've got this flow
Either way my job’s Esentual so just watch me grow
Oh, I never thought I’d even get this far
And this is the beginning for me, swear down I’ma be a star
‘Cause even when I’m feelin’ faded, I still shine out
And now I’m focused on my art, ya’ll gon' see what I’m about
See I know I’m not the realist, but I keep it real
So when you’re asking my opinion, I’ma say just how I feel
All these artists wanna work with me, or just want advice
But I just tell ‘em how it is, not because I’m being nice
Icy cold attitude, spittin’ hard lyrics at a fucking high magnitude, ahh!
‘Cause I've had enough of waiting, no holding back
You better step outta my way before you face a massive attack

Now matter of fact, this is a warm up
I've got a little lazy lately; I guess I need a full cup
So fill me up, just the time to get my single out
I guess you've waited long enough, no wonder you've had some doubt
But now that I’m back in my element, shit is irrelevant
I've got support from all angles now so watch me invent
Carter told me to go get and know I finally am
So I’ma do it just like J. Lye and make sure I go in H.A.M
But I’ll be over here with all these females in my ear
Chillin’ in the VIP with all these drinks around me
‘Cause I’m just living for the moment as tomorrow’s never promised
And honestly, this is the best way to be; yeah I’m on one now
I’m a beast to say the least, but where’s my beauty?
Maybe she’s over at Marvin’s room, but all that shit just ain't my duty
Now I treat these women like my music
I don’t fuck around unless it’s worth it
In other words unless it’s perfect
I see a lot of haters in the club but they ain't saying shit
Even when I’m by chillin’ by myself, they ain't doing shit
So practice what you preach, before you go and spit it
Before you make me livid, and make the night more vivid, yeah
Because I’m single, and I’m seeing double
Drinkin’ triples got me buzzin', you don’ want no trouble, naa
I can help assist your suicide, ‘cause I’ll take you out, no date
I’ll determine your fate...
