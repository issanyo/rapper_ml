[Verse 1: JIG}

Jumped in a all white pool thinkin 'please'
I walk in a puddle of hate round my knees
Been under so long distaste is what I bleed
Some dark tint roun' here is what I need
Niggas say he white washed so nobody heeds
Whites on sight stop turn and flee
Now I'm paranoid who wouldn't be?
Understand this ocean of hate gets kinda deep
Man--
Fuck! lemon squeezey
Life'll never be easy
Everybody'd be Yeezy
And put on like Jeezy, if it was
But I'm on that JI!
G cubed B Ps
J.I.G. is now deemed the next
Mac Dre of the Bay, ya bet!
FNN straight out tha Ye
We sit there and contemplate
The stacks I'm finna make
The racks i won't break
The crack they can't trace
These facts you can't face
Your hate is just a waste cuz I
Got a knack for widening straits and
Where I am is a place
You people couldn't face, but!
I'm back now
Turn up the Bass

[Verse 2]

I think I sunk lower than expected, Hades
Pressure's on I feel the Heat, Dwayne Wade
Hung out to dry I don't mind the fade
Mind dark Horatio, Miami Dade
What I feel is "Misery", Kathy Bates
Women love to treat me harsh, no dates
I used ta see em lovingly, now irate
Whatever, I'm tired of looking for mates
Everything I spit is law write it on a slate
Why can't any of you stop being so fake?
I want you to hate me to my face
Swear to god that I won't be phased
This decision was not made in haste
I just felt like you deserved to have a taste
Of my relatively unstable mental state recognize
People like me aren't born their maked
I'm lost on this social ladder like its a maze cuz
I go back and forth but my communities will never relate
Where I am is a place
You people couldn't face, but!
I'm back now
Turn up the Bass
