[Verse 1]
I see ya watchin'
Examinin' my manoeuvres
Grab a bottle and knowing the calculated conclusion
Of what I'm sippin'
And what I'm thinking
Praying, Lord don't let 'em catch me slipping
Popped the cap back and relax
Yeah, the sin is relapsed
Selfishness disguised as helplessness, inhibitions left with my sleeving
Breathe that
Take a picture, perfect, freeze that
Shameful reminisces, disgusting recaps
Thinking that
This feeling, can't be me
No never, I've been set free
The liquor that I'm drinking, it controlling me
Only puts a hole in me
That can never be filled
So I just sip another bottle 'til my cup overflows into a heart that's hollow
Role models, follow the leader
To the same cornerstone where he told me to meet him
I was drinking, smelling so weedy
Crazy, why I want to be him
Because this man he had it all together
Women, money, surrounded with pleasure
I see him watching
Examinin' my manoeuvres
Grab a bottle and knowing the calculated conclusion

[Pre-Hook]
The cornerstone (x2)

[Hook]
Meet me at the spot right now
It's going down
We about to get blown out
Let's role on down

[Verse 2]
I see them watchin'
Examinin' what I'm doing
Making assessment
And assume I'm just foolish
And even though I am, I need not for them to prove it
I can finally remove them from the life I'm pursuing
Weed and music, love it too much to lose it
Covered the stuff they doin'
Vanity all consuming
And once the life worth livin' for gets ruined
This lifestyle is not real life only an illusion
Evil is not alarming when it's knocking at your back porch
And then you're swept away by a trap door
You lose footing, lose sight
Lose the fight to your own thoughts
Knowing the trap was set by your own heart
Getting Goosebumps and lumps in the back of my throat
Thinking about it before I dive back in the door
It's backwards I know
Trying to find God in the darkness is like walking backwards I know
Or maybe not
I can see when I write this
In the pitch black, candle light shines the brightest
And when the candle dances
We all get excited and drawn in
What will light allow us to decipher
Searching for knowledge we feed the flame it goes bigger, brighter
Stronger 'til the room becomes whiter
Warmer, invited, we're stepping unknowingly become consumed with the love of Christ, uncontrollably

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook 2]
Meet me at the throne right now
I'm kneeling down
Let His love pour out
This final ground
At the cornerstone

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook 2]

[Outro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
At the cornerstone
