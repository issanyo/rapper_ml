[Verse 1: Peter Labeaud]
I know that I was placed in this city
Where many of us got to die
But in time I'll understand
Why, Sometimes I wanna cry
But why me god
Just a question I gotta ask
Why a individual with a tainted
State of mind
Was good enough to plant in the soil
Is my soul really down to earth
Was I really chosen for a purpose
I think from time to time
That I ain't good for nothing
But you looked down on me and said
No, your here for something
But Why I gotta hurt
Why I gotta burn
Why we gotta
(Ah ah ah)

[Chorus: Phelán Brown]
I know that I'm destined for greatness
And I won't stop no
I know I'm blessed
I know that I'm here for a reason
Believe me
I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you what I am made of
I'm giving this (yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
I'm giving this my all

[Verse 2: Peter Labeaud]
Am I even good enough to rap over drake song
Take em to church like trey songz
Pick up this pen and right my wrongs
Expose Peter Labeaud to the world
And everybody looking down on him
From heaven, for heavens sake
I pray I don't let you down
I'm drowning creek deep
My knees weak
I can't breathe
I can't see
My visions blurry
My palms sweaty
Why am I doubting myself
I know that I fucking got it
So why am I stressing myself
I know I can free the world
I know I can set you free
But I can't set myself free
But I can feel the locks and chains
Weighing down on my body
Mind and soul, mind my soul
I used to just wanna
Make something my momma like
Make something my brother like
Make something my sister like
But who am I kidding?
They caught up in the times too
And I'm just standing here infront of a microphone tryna reach you
But I fucked up
Why am I kidding myself?

[Verse 3: Mehkai Orion]
Why am I kidding myself
With all this worth
I hope I'm ready for it
I'm standing on the line of love & hate
I can't ignore it
I hope I find some peace to fill the void so I can soar above the sky
‘cause time & time again
I'm asking why
Can a black boy fly
Can I really get the point across before the dove cries
I done took so many loses
Now I gotta wonder
Is this another stepping stone
Or am I falling under, damn
Good lord I got some questions for you

[Chorus: Phelán Brown]
I know that I'm destined for greatness
And I won't stop no
I know I'm blessed
I know that I'm here for a reason, believe me
I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
I'm giving this (yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
I'm giving my all

[Verse 4: Peter Labeaud]
Will I end up throwing all this shit away
Question myself like who the fuck
Do you think you is
It's been 2 years
From time to time
I think you really ain't shit
Your just all talk
What you mean you were doubting yourself
What the fuck you mean you had a lot on your mind
I swear if you miss yo chance
This fucking bullet gonna be the only thing on your mind nigga
You better get your shit together
Can you really live with telling your momma
She raised a fucking failure?
Fly!!!

[Outro: Peter Labeaud & Phelán Brown]
Birds flying high
How does it feel to fly (how does it feel)
And what does it feel like when the wind doesn't brush my skin anymore
Sing this
I love myself (I love myself)
I love myself more than anything
Sing this
I love myself (I love myself)
I love myself more than anything
Sing this
I trust in myself
I believe in myself

[Verse 5: Peter Labeaud]
To be honest, I just got done listening to Drake’s verse
And from time to time
I'm sitting here all alone
In these dark rooms contemplating
If & how I can influence the nation
My hearts racing
I wonder if I'm as great as you said I was
Or if I'm half as great as I said I was
And will be, We will see
‘cause music is a gift and a curse
Funny how the ones who hurt
The most have to be famous
For you to love them
I don't wanna be famous if all it is
Is fake love all around me
You brainless
If your gonna love me
Then love me for me
But if I'm not famous
How will I support the ones I love the most
And thats dealing with issues bigger than me
Man all this shit that surrounds me
Is just so much bigger than me
So I gotta ask
Why did you give the power to me
Maybe I should tuck all of my insecurities away and follow my dreams
As deep as it seems
It's harder than it seems
& there I go making excuses again
Why am I even doubting myself again
Everything in your life starts with you and ends with you
Is what you told me
But I just can hold on to your words like I should be doing
I just can't do everything for myself and let myself be happy like I should be doing
I care to much about how they speak of me
How can I get these voices up outta my head
Come on
Just fucking speak to me
‘cause I'm just a sinner
I'm just a nigga
Lost in the world
With no sense of
What's right & what's wrong
Everything that's wrong
Feels so right
And everything that's good
Turns out wrong always
If someone needs you to change for them
It isn't worth it
Only change for you
If your aim is to shoot for better, never forfeit or force it
It'll come in time
Always right on time
And I don't give a fuck if only one
Person who needs to hear this, hears this
That's better than none
If my music never moved you or a soul
Well fuck it at least I tryed
Sincerely yourz
And p.s
Momma, I hope your proud of your son
Look at from where he done come
And then done
When they call me to the stage for my Grammy
& im crying on stage just know
It's not becuase of this trophy I'm holding
Not becuase everybody's singing my songs and knows my name around the world
Not because of no third thing
It's because we fucking made it
& I never thought I would make it this far
It's because all of this shit is so different
I’m dealing, I’m feeling it...
