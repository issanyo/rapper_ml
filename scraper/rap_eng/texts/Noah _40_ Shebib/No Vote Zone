[Verse 1: BAD BOY i]
Women voting is a disgrace to democracy
If you're trying to give them rights you owe us an apology
Like a rollercoaster, my gang got a lot of G's
Girl to me your hair looks like cottage cheese
So your name is Elizabeth Cady Stanton
When I saw you I thought you were Brandon
Trying to vote, you in water I can't stand in
Got your hopes so high I don't think you can land them
Now I move on to Lucretia
All those wrinkles looks like someone creased you
I'm so gifted feel like it was just Christmas
I'd be lying if I said I'm trying to meet ya
'Bout to kill Susan B. Anthony
All these guys cut you off you an amputee
Get your body can you can you bag it please
'Bout to break you out get your acne cream
Nice try with the Seneca Falls Convention
Nice try here's an honorable mention
I was there bruh it felt like a detention
Noticed there was mainly women in attendance
Your Declaration of Rights & Sentiments
Was a wannabe Declaration of Independence
Boy you know my es√©'s got a lot of them sentences
