Nightmares and failed Dreams...
Not so fond memories...
Things that you shouldn't see..
Nothing but angels but they seem to have these devil wings...
No earthly things...
Except the addicts depressed sitting on fire swings...
I peeped these vampires blood sucking on everything...
And not them twilight niggas sparkling and glistening..
I'm talking cold hearted killers with tempers sizzling...
That was just level one...and I'm still descending....
So on to level two... where all your fears just hop at you...
So for me that means I saw myself being a bad dad...
And I'm really glad that...it didn't last...but it went from bad to..
Really bad really fast so... fast I blinked and saw a city shot to shambles..
With futuristic guns that blast niggas unlimited ammo....
Blow blow blow blamooo.....
Saw spawn in his camo...
Dapped him up cuz this is my home now...
The beginning.....of the end.....
