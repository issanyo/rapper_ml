[Chorus] (Wizzy)

Baby girl give me brain
Give me all the knowledge
Turn around bust it open
Girl call me papi
Have you screamin’ in silence
Pipe up in yo body
Ima Have you leaking
Its a wave, It's a tsunami
Close your mouth
You don't want the neighbors calling
Deep up in yo body
Have it makin’ squeaky noises
Her hair is real
Everything real I'm pullin’
I have all of the milk
But I want your cookies
She don't want you nigga
I'm the one she choosin’
Give her every stroke
She like the way I'm pushin’
Ima numb yo body just to keep you from movin’
I create tsunamis, while I'm up in that pussy

[Verse 1] (Uzi x Reaper)

You told me you love me and I’m still processing it
Never fell for a woman passive aggressive as this
I know your ex made you think “is this as best as it gets?”
Hands down I can even get you wetter than this
Shawty I ain’t one to brag but I turn ‘em out
I know I talk a big game but this ain’t word of mouth
Don’t be second guessing nothin’ cause without a doubt
Ima hold you down forever what you worried ‘bout ?
I don’t really wanna rush but I know you want it too
And heard you off your period so what you wanna do?
Rose petals on the bed couple candles for the mood
Then she dealt a little head my depression went elude
I love it when shawty just drive a nigga crazy
Sort of a fan of you riding because I’m kinda lazy
I do not give a fuck, cause her vagina ate it
I found myself in the center of your tsunami baby

[Chorus] (Wizzy)

Baby girl give me brain
Give me all the knowledge
Turn around bust it open
Girl call me papi
Have you screamin’ in silence
Pipe up in yo body
Ima Have you leaking
Its a wave, It's a tsunami
Close your mouth
You don't want the neighbors calling
Deep up in yo body
Have it makin’ squeaky noises
Her hair is real
Everything real I'm pullin’
I have all of the milk
But I want your cookies
She don't want you nigga
I'm the one she choosin’
Give her every stroke
She like the way I'm pushin’
Ima numb yo body just to keep you from movin’
I create tsunamis, while I'm up in that pussy

[Verse 2] (Wizzy)

She say she love the kid
And I'm the greatest
I just stole his bitch
Now he startin’ to hate it
I hit her once
I gave her back, congratulations
I hit her one time
Now her heart started racin’
I caught me a body
Ain't talking ‘bout no murder cases
I'm all in her face
She like the way I'm paintin’
She think I love her
But the money is what I'm chasin’
I create tsunamis
No mass destruction
I'm in her like a splinter
Pushing all her buttons
I'm all up in her body
Deep up in her stomach
She think I'm the one
Girl is you a dummy?
The number one rule
I can't wife no thottie
I got her legs shakin’
Like she on a molly
Make her get up
All up out yo body
I can't fall in love
Cause y'all hoes is too grimey
Now she blowin’ up my phone asking for some pipin’
Don't call me or text me
You is not nobody
I just wanna make you
Have a big tsunami
Have you knocked out quick
Just from the pipin’
It's our lil’ secret I promise
I won't tell nobody
No you can't stay with me
Girl you outta pocket
No you can't hang with me
You might be pocket watchin’

[Chorus] (Wizzy)

Baby girl give me brain
Give me all the knowledge
Turn around bust it open
Girl call me papi
Have you screamin’ in silence
Pipe up in yo body
Ima Have you leaking
Its a wave, It's a tsunami
Close your mouth
You don't want the neighbors calling
Deep up in yo body
Have it makin’ squeaky noises
Her hair is real
Everything real I'm pullin’
I have all of the milk
But I want your cookies
She don't want you nigga
I'm the one she choosin’
Give her every stroke
She like the way I'm pushin’
Ima numb yo body just to keep you from movin’
I create tsunamis, while I'm up in that pussy
