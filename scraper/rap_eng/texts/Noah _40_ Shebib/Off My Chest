[Intro]
Yea
Yea, Yea

[Verse 1: Noah Whitaker]
I got 99 problems and that's just at school on my phone
You can add 10 more tonight when I get home
They teaching me shit I don't want
Or need to know then they wonder why downhill is the way we all go? (huh)
All the others say "it's okay" and "you'll understand in years to come"
But what about right now, ya'll make me think this shit is dumb
I can do less in school with a pen than I can do on my phone with my thumbs (huh)
See nowadays social media makes everyone think they're more important than all of us
Everyone has a voice but some people raise their voice a bit too much
We're all people, all equal, why not be happy and peaceful
Instead of spreading the evil it's deceitful, disrespectful
And full of bull... shit
(yea, yea, huh)
Nowadays we got these boys wanna be girls and vice versa too
How come you need a dick as a female why can't you just love you for you?
I ain't got a problem with it but I think it's ignorant to be someone you're not
And this has nothing to do with religion because for me God hasn't tied the knot
I think there's someone up there, hell yea for sure
Some people think we cam from a bang and when we die we're no more than sand on a shore?
But then why even live why not end it right now?
Pick up the gun, "blaw"
'Cuz if we just die and go in the dirt then living a long life ain't worth all this work (hmm)
That means me loving you is all for nothing and all my education is bluffing because they said I'd need it but turns out, we're all nothing
See I know someone's up there helping me out but he won't give me a sign to let me know what it's all about
"I need a sign God gimme a shout!"
But nah he won't, that's not what faith is all about
Believe in what you can't, that's the easy way out
No straight up answers to anything man and that's just the truth, whether that's an old man wanting to know about dying
Or something we're teaching our youth (yea)
There's another problem too is raising your kids
Like Watts said; we live according to what we think is right but the truth to most of us is way outta sight and we don't need to do this and we don't need to fight
But here we all stand weapon in hand ready to throw a shot "Blam' (yea)
Things can go from good to bad in less than a second
Man sometimes the truth don't rhyme and that's just the truth
Like Lamar said nothing more influential than rap music so here I am
Maybe my voice will be bigger than it is now and maybe it will answer my questions about who I am, I am a man but what's a man when he's got no power in his hand
What is a man with a heartless fam
What is a rapper without any fans, what is it really huh?
Damn (yea)
See this song has no chorus 'cuz all I needed to say isn't something you can repeat to bore us
I had to get this out it needed to be said
Had to get this shit off the top of my head, late night thoughts laying in bed thinkin' bout Jimmy and Fred
They're just some so and so's that no one knows
Mary and Jane to you they just some hoes but oh no just know
They're just as good as you...

[Sample]
Have you seen me?

[Verse 1 Continued]
It's true

[Sample]
I’m doing so good
Every time I leave
Oh, I’m so sorry

[Verse 2: Noah Whitaker]
(huh)
A man with no home in the street can be just as smart as a man running his own industry
A man in chains can be more heartfelt than a man that is free
Like I said I had to get this Off My Chest I hope you understand
Don't look at me as anything more or less than anything than just a man
