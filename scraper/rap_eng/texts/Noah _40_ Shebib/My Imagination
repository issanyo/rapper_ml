[Intro: Majid Al Maskati]
Mhm, mhm, ooh

[Verse 1: Majid Al Maskati]
My imagination, yeah
My imagination is taking me places
It's a celebration but I been here mistaking someone for you
See I fear no one
But love is something I can't do with you, baby, with you

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
You remind me of a pretty girl, you do
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
Who broke, who broke my heart, baby
That tore my life apart

[Verse 2: Daniel Daley]
My imagination, oh yeah
Or maybe it's just what I've been drinking, yeah (Virginia Black)
Throughout our conversation
And it keeps helping me thinking
Not just the one that you hating
Someone that I shouldn't hold on to
So love, is something I can't do, can't do with you
With you

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati & Daniel Daley]
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
You remind me of a pretty girl, you do
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
Who broke, who broke my heart, baby
Who tore my life apart

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
You remind me of a pretty girl, you do
You remind me of a pretty girl, baby
Who broke, who broke my heart, baby
That tore my life apart
