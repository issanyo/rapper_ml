[Verse 1]
Ayo I'm on some acrobatic shit
Gone off the bong it's like a magic trick
Stoner steady snackin on my shaggy shit
Walkin dead marathons sip the 40 hit the shorty on the leg I'm gettin horny
French toast and French kiss me
I'ma king you're Doug Christie
Round table meetings sippin whiskey
Tryna discuss, all these ways to get our paper up
I'm tryna ball but right now I gotta taper cut, facin blunts
Shit man, roundhouse kick your kick stand
Jack ya bitch man, she gettin wood like the 6th man
So consistent, shooting star make a wish quick
If you blink for half a millisecond you gon' miss it
And I ain't tryna miss shit, opportunity I seize it
Lazy muhfuckas on they ass eatin Cheez-Izs
All these gifts and blessings so I had to thank you Jesus
You know I'm gon' receive it like Darrelle Revis
And bring it back to the house, that's the pad
With my mom and my dad, I don't flaunt, I don't brag
I don't mock, I just laugh, then i haunt, like your past
Boogie Man Teezy with his monstrous ass
Ayyyeee you know I'm bout it fuck wit me you know I got it
Like every other Friday 7 digit length deposits
I'm tryna be the flyest in the sky fuck a pilot
High mileage, purple soul plane wit hydraulics
Dawg I'm well aware I'm hardly on the map, I'm like Delaware
You hella scared I'm comin for your throat, Jim Crow rope
Vote for the pimp, heaven sent, Teezy president
Wreckin on the track coincidentally left a couple dents
You bozo, high on the gas in the ozone
High gas prices realizing how you so grown
Growin sick and tired of these ills in our society
I'm pressed like ironing, got me in and out sobriety
I can't stand it, gah dammit
Last night Ciroc'd that muhfucka now we New Amsterdam it
Took a pic, lemme scan it, load it up, Instagram it
5 finger discount on ya ho, I'ma bandit
She told me you ain't have no drive you need you a mechanic
She's scared to even ride with you it puts her in a panic
Like "Oh! No! Whoa! Bro!
Hold the bleezy down there's the po ...pos!"
Ooooo Mojo Jojo Jo in this bitch act a monkey like wrench
Switch blade cut yo ass you like a 6th grade class bruh
Pulp Fiction on the plasma
Stroke that ass ma I came late, fuckin FAFSA
The cotton UNT hoodie hood when it's feelin good but
It's Texas weather so that's probably never
I'ma beast, I'm ahead of the these so called competitors
And that's forever dawg et cetera, et cetera...shit

[Interlude]
E.T.C...dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot...

[Verse 2]
But I ain't been doin much, 'cept rappin
Studying, a cruel life chargin niggas full price
For covers I'm creating for they mixtapes Nicely Done
Production I'm Suge Knight back in '91
Self made, self paid
Know that women are attracted to a nigga with ambition cause it will pay
Off that's why it's no days off no field days
Then doors open up like Bill Gates
Now all of a sudden she wan' fuck but blew me off when I was a senior back in 12th grade
I ain't seen her since the 12th grade wassup with that?
Naw I ain't tryna bust a but in that
2 kids a pot belly man who cuffin that?
Shit, not I (not me either nigga) Not me dawg
I'm good, we good over here, yea
