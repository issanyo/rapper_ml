[Verse 1]
Young nigga, felt so embarrassed
Livin' in the dark where I perished
Screams of silence, Come save me
But shit, damn I had to come and save me
When you're an adolescent  there's a lot of depression  and you feel that you have no protection
Screamin' god can I get  protection, affection, no depression
Worked on days where I felt no ascension
Pretension was the main frame
Pretensions, what I tried to gain
Forever I will be the same
But i'll never be the same
You say you can't love cause a man did you wrong
But nah girl, you doing yourself wrong
And I understand
You were criticized , when I look in your eyes, all I see is pain
A little girl whose heart was always filled with pain
It's no wonder why you always feel shame for men
Cause the man who was supposed  to be there for you just up and left you
Now you're all grown up and you're scared to trust
Even a man with no signs of distrust  cause you know that all they want is
Lust
