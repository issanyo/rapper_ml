[Intro]
Money in the bank now
Money in the bank now
Do doo do do do do
Do do do doo do do do

[Chorus]
Yea
Money in the bank now (hah) *cha ching*
Money in the bank now
Do doo do do do do
Do do do doo do do do

[Verse 1]
Locked up 'cause a nigga didn't tell
Real niggas never took the deal like Chappelle
Warden tripping 'cause I treat the jail like a hotel
My celly tripping 'cause I got a cellie in my cell (cellie)
Ringing like a telethon
Like a marathon
First single got me banned from America
I need to call up Farrakhan
When they let me through I swear it's on (ya, ya)

[Pre-Hook]
This ain't old money this that new new (moneyyy)
Imma catch you niggas when I choose to
Sliding down your block just to shoot you
Like do doo do do do do

[Chorus]
Yea
Money in the bank now (hah) *cha ching*
Money in the bank now
Do doo do do do do
Do do do doo do do do

[Verse 2]
Bah, bah, woo, yea
Give me the pack (yea)
You know I'm moving dat
Never turn my back I ain't with all of that
I go do a hit and then start walking back (bow, bow)
Don't live far away from where I dropped him at
But I got a zipper where my 9 goes
My lawyer and the judge are playing 9 holes (woo, woo)
Got some new chains just to stun you haters
Bakaveli, I want all the paper (woo, woo)

[Pre-Hook]
This ain't old money this that new new (moneyyy)
Imma catch you niggas when I choose to
Sliding down your block just to shoot youuu (bow, bow)
Like do doo do do do do (woo)

[Chorus]
Yea
Money in the bank now (hah) *cha ching*
Money in the bank now
Do doo do do do do
Do do do doo do do do
Yea
Yea
Money in the bank now (hah)
Money in the bank now
Do doo do do do do
Do do do doo do do do

[Outro]
Woo
