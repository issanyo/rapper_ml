[Verse 1: Sade]
I was the one
I who could, pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet, and I gave you my love
You are the one who got me started
You could have let me love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did he make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

[Hook]
You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go

[Verse 2]
You laid me down
Left me for the lions
A long long time ago
You left me there dying
But you never let me go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I know we could have had it all
I wasn't ready to go steady no not at all
Smoke and mirrors clouded my vision we hit a wall
Couldn't see the moon and the sky behind the fog
Pregnant pause
Damn your baby tall, what you been up to
I don't blame you my doll
Yeah, we kinda stalled
As God as my witness, timin' was my mistress
I guess it's in the stars for me to love you from a distance
Uh, our ship sailed, uh, the wind blows
The door's always open but our window is closed
You always thought "What if?"
But that'll just drive you crazy baby, girl interrupted
Thinkin' 'bout what wasn't
Thinkin' 'bout what was it?
Was it somethin' I done?
Somethin' I could do better although nothin' could be done
Sometimes you get what you need
Not what you think you want
So baby no moon and sky, yet a beautiful sun

[Verse 4: Sade]
You'll always know the reason why
The song you heard, will stay on your mind
It ain't gon' let you go, no
Cuz you are the moon and I the endless sky

[Hook]

[Outro]
You have the keys to the car
You have every star
Everyone of them twinkling
Baby, what were you thinking?
