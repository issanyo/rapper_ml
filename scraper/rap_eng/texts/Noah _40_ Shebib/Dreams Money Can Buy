Balance in the negative, my head is getting cluttered
"Your rapping is incredible", they said that when I muttered
My laughter is the evidence that what I spit is butter
On the toasts that are spoke, I'm a fucking up-and-comer
Right? But who you knew was old PuKe
I was shaped like play doh by all the shit I go through
So no dough affects me very little when I'm spitting
Like a motherfucking legend, I guess I never told you
It's funny; like it or not, this will always be me
They always picked on Sick, cos they thought it would be easy
But I just play on Sick, cos I always sought a challenge
I always want the gold when I send my foes GG
I guess, you can blame my thirst for success
That must be why I drown when I'm fucking upset
That must be why it's "down" now and never depressed
But it's hard to breathe still cos I'm loving each breath
That's exactly how it is now
I've been busy getting high, can't fall to get down
Yeah, so curse my sick mouth
Contradict myself the way I live to live now
Call it Dream Money Can Buy
Everybody acts surprised that it wasn't a lie
That PuKe had told the truth, he was part of the group
Now let me introduce Dare You Sample: Part Thrice like

"Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me"

My last three releases: killed every track right
My last three months trying hard to rap tight
My last three nights sleeping late and rising early
Life of a legend in the making, guess I am
(maybe) It's sort of early to tell it yet
And I'm not even sure if I can spell, check myself
As I wreck the vibe
With my bad attitude and my lack of a...
Hunting down the ghosts of all my past mixtapes
They're all bad mistakes that haunt when they get plays
Messages that I get from friends
Who all hate him but won't say it to his face (you know who)
Look to me like I'm the one to spit it
But really now-a-days I just feel so indifferent
Like let him have his fans who don't know what rap is
As long as no-one tells me that he is the sickest
Nah, that's the title I reside in
Got the snares snapping for me to lose my mind with
It had such terrible timing
A month or so later and I would've stopped writing
Call it Dream Money Can Buy
Everybody acts surprised that it wasn't a lie
That PuKe was late for June, so he could improve
Now let me introduce Dare You Sample: Part Thrice
