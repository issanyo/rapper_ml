Intro:
They don't want no gospel, but I give it to 'em

Chorus:
(Looking for) revenge... all summer sixteen, all
Summer sixteen, God, I'm feeling so pristine, I been
Looking to the future, saying that we be on top as a team, all
In the same thing, all repping one thing, looking for

Verse 1:
Revenge... all summer diez y seis, your
Favorite rapper shouldn't take it to heart when I pick up the pace
Imitation artists, man, all of y'all have just been a disgrace, my
Girl better know she's a shoe in when sporting her wine colored lace (bralette), or

Looking fresh in Adidas caps - authentic Santa, it's real "wrap"
Had to go silent and finesse on double F, but now's time just to bring it back, so I give 'em
DAX, hit 'em with the *praa,* it's a new season - sabes, yo quiero venganza
...'qui va el knockeo sin segunda ronda, no hay pa' revancha

...let me be clear, faith comes to those that may hear, preaching "the end's pretty
Near" - never for fear, on a new tier, all I need is
One 16 this summer sixteen, unashamed 'till the grave, Romans 1:16
Got a hundred dreams, spit abundant steam, with the Arsenal prepped, like the London team

...Out here looking for revenge - y'all just looking for a ten
...Don't make David send again - girl, I know the message's read
Two zero one six, more bars than her dungeon
DAX be going dumb, look what I done did

Want Selena and Taylor con un David in the middle
Sure, Drake got Toronto now - keep a close eye on who run this

Food, and 2015 really flew, I got a habit for the truth, and all my hittas know the reason I be saying "preacher dude"
...see right through you, don't gotta pretend
...2016, looking for revenge

Put it on video, (I) shower in meteors, DAX got that Iggy flow, mess with no medioc
I'm on the course to the success - all of your courses remedial, I'm not conceited though
Double F 'till the death of moi - I can ride a bike with no handle bars
But I handle bars, that's repertoire, you got no waves, you a reservoir

...es mi a√±o in my zone ...Jesus got me on the low
...homie, he is God alone ...no one put him on the throne
She don't like the anime, homie, she isn't worth it, but if she's about it, I promise, I might be nervous
*mumbles* I'm flowing in with emotion - still, everybody thinks it's dopeness, hopeless

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, wrote this, porque this is what you need
...you remind me of a tailor, I'm saying you're not what you "seam"
...mix of Nolan, Martin, Biggie, reliving this all from a dream
...summer or lyrics, I'm wishing this will be the sweetest 16
