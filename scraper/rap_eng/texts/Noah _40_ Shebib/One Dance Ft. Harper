[Verse 1]
Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Chorus]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'for I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
His taking a hold on me

I like your style (I like your style)
I like your style (I like your style)


[Verse 2]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you get a text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

[Chorus]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I like your style (I like your style)
I like your style (I like your style)

I like your style (I need a one dance, oh i need a one dance)
I like your style

I need a one dance (baby, baby yeah)
I need a one dance (oh, baby, baby)
I need a one dance (Got a Hennessy in my hand)
(Yeah, his taking a hold on me)
I need a one dance (oh, baby, baby, yeah)
