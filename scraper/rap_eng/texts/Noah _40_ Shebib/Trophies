Set fiah pon de herb!

Bitch my name is Pro Vision haha

[Verse One]
I skipped right over the demo
Penned like 20 tapes playin with this rap shit like Nintendo
Dreams of being heard from the O to Sacramento
This was all before I even knew bout endo
Let's blaze this motherfucker
I'm a east side 407 nigga from the south
Disrespect O-Town, you should watch your fucking mouth
My real name ain't my rap shit
Honestly too many Johns up in this bitch
Why you think all my niggas call me Stunna
It ain't no hood shit, dude I ain't no fucking gunna
But I'm from the gutta
And nigga that's just one a
My setbacks in life
But I guess that's alright
Cause if I grew up in the burbs
I woulda never rhymed words
Don't wish poverty on no one, do not get it twisted
But struggle builds character rich niggas miss it
I said struggle builds character that rich niggas missin

[Hook]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

[Verse Two]
COMING SOON
