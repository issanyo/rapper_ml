[Intro: Alxandah]
I just hate when I'm with you
Man this shit is on zero
Everyday I feel like I just lost another hero
Everyday I feel like I just saw a murder nero

[Verse 1: Alxandah]
Trapped inside I can’t escape my own consciousness
If drugs would help me I would be at the doctor counting this
If love would help me I would be at her house not rapping this
Bullshit remixes I'm pushing out like a pro surrogate
Ain't bout the furs and shit
I keep it to myself need no encouragement
Keep my life shallow but need to set goals for it
I’ve been a fool for it, I been a tool for it, I ain't been me for it
I keep it G like a 6 I run engineless
Wait til this summer the heat will be triple this
Album drop Alex in Wonderland Hue's with it
Man I'm imbued in it light from a different lens
Corduroy my jeans man
Eagle twenty red and they replaced the smell of weed damn
Smoke em til I can't feel my legs or even me man
Ever since Dave and Busters I haven't been the same man
I haven't felt the same man
How can I fuck it up now
Skipping the Doja not cow
I've been more active and loud
Voicing myself to a crowd
I’ve been more pissed off at how
Niggas be more fake and get
This money and go back on vows
I’m stalling nigga that's appalling
If I got those racks I would be stacking and not balling
And don’t think I'm calling
Anybody out because everybody is falling
Victim to the same shit
Money lifestyle niggas spend it on their fucking whole clique
Money Bitches Weed and they get caught up with that whole shit
I just need a studio with all my niggas in it
Writing making classics for the classes to get hip with
People to people
I never got to the stepele
I'm never talking to god
I'm always equal to equal
I never go into detail
I keep it sealed like it’s retail
But they are testing my patience
Bout to let loose like a female
Or anybody that keeps real
Speaking my mind is a lethal
Mixture for weak niggas presale
I could go weekend to week still
I could go weekend to week still
I could go weekend to week still
I could go weekend to week still

[Verse 2: Azure The Paradox]
I'm with my nigga Alxandah deciding to picking a phantom
Different color schemes like bringing back up a panda
See me in the future got more Migos than Atlanta
Inspecting on my deck i got the method for your planner
Oh shit
Wu tang for the cream
Decorate your house when i pull the red beam
Put a hole in your chest we can make a blood sing
Bitch i never been a Hoffman but I'll get to dusting
That's a Thanos, avenging my decisions
Picking up the pieces of my fucked up conditions
Changing up the game i get a ring like Olympics
Then they finna praise me like i came from Olympus
What's the difference?
God amongst men
I just can spot the distance
They can't pay attention but they finna pay a penance
Forever
I'm just a nigga who rap
I drop a fire project to see where I'm at
Then niggas ain't buy my shit cuz they claiming I'm wack
It's Opposite Day if you look back at the facts
I'm boutta drop the second shit as a matter of fact
When that shit goes gold midnight gon attack
And i ain't talking bout my skin when i black on the track
I think I'm done with my rant
