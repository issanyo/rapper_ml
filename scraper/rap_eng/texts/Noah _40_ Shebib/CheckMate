[Verse 2 : ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Tell me when you’re ready, time to reach my level set
If you ain't never met me, I ain't even legal yet
Young heart, but it’s oversize why you gotta criticize?
Over think the lies, that support the only guys, tryna get a rise
Only they rely, on the basic buys, I advise to improvise, fix you humble eyes
On my private drive, why they act surprised?
Discuss it later when you realize, we them guys!
Use to be shy, young buck, little guy
No luck, no light, full thrust, no sight, fuck trust
Lone soul, no role, no goal, found faith, more cake, more hate
Tryna make the fake, take a lil break, from the human race
Get em off my case, like for fuckin'sake
Every track's at stake, never movin' late, underestimate, every bait you see me make
Nigga wait..
Checkmate!

I adjust, to the new lust, never trust
Freedom is a must, so save us, pave us, a path to the new land
Windsor take a stand, I'm newest man
Reachin' rubber bands, earning high command
Do when I demand, it's gettin outta hand, again
Try-ta understand, cause ppl think the plan, is in the man
Drop the beat, let it play a bit
I commit, make the best of it
Sounds significant, intricate
Now we feelin it
Now she feelin it
Now they feelin it
Now I'm feelin rich
