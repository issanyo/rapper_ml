English Translation

What are we
Living for
We couldn’t know

They say that we’re
Living for happiness
But what is that

Things that we can’t know or see
Seems like there are too many in the world
We don’t hear the words of adults saying
As time passes we would realize

Let’s be happy, let’s be happy
Even if we live with these heavy in our mouths every day
To be honest, I still don’t know
Why am I often lonely

Lost in life
Lost in life
Lost in you
Lost in you

I don’t know whether I’ve lost the way
Or whether from the beginning I was lost
Even when I’m with someone, one corner of my heart is lonely

The fact that I was born is frightening
Death hurts too badly
And the present is too desolate

Where is my meaning
Where is my heart
In this vast universe
I’m endlessly adrift
I’m endlessly adrift

Lost in life
Lost in life
Lost in you
Lost in you
