[Verse 1]
I live in this fantasy
Where everything is amplified
Senses heighten in a flash
And everything just comes alive
This pressure all inside of me
Is sexual anxiety

[Chorus]
Baby, there’s a lot of freaky shit running in my mind
That I can’t say, but I know I can demonstrate
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate
So I’mma make it simple and plain
You just need to come over
I can let my body explain
I can just demonstrate

[Verse 2]
I’m arrested by the night
And only you can set me free
Guilty, but I’m not ashamed
I’m exactly where I wanted to be, yeah
I leave the door, open wide
In hopes that you will sneak inside

[Chorus]
Baby, there’s a lot of freaky shit running in my mind
That I can’t say, but I know I can demonstrate
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate
So I’mma make it simple and plain
You just need to come over, come over
I can let my body explain
I can just demonstrate

[Bridge]
I’m thinking, come over, come over
Come over
I’m thinking, come over, come over
I’m thinking...

[Chorus]
Baby, there’s a lot of freaky shit running in my mind
That I can’t say, but I know I can demonstrate
And I can let my body explain
I know I can demonstrate
So I’mma make it simple and plain
You just need to come over, come over
I can let my body explain
I can just demonstrate

[Outro]
Demonstrate
Come over
I can let my body explain
So I can demonstrate
Come over, ah
