[Verse 1] (Jay Young)
It's been a while since the last time I seen you around
But every time I see you, it makes my heart pound
Palms sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
The control you have on my body deadly
Cuz the emptiness is filled with a sudden rush
Of endorphins, happiness, and good stuff
A hot flush, you turn my thoughts into slush
My chest starts to feel tight like it's about to gush
Been alone for a while, it's the path I chose
Pushed on, on my own, stayed on my toes
They say all you've got is time when you're in younger throes
So I'll throw my chip in, and reap what I sow
I'll take a chance with you, you take a chance with me
We could stroll down Easy Street, you see
I'm melting down my barriers, like snow
Just so you know...

[Hook] (Drake)

[Verse 2] (Jay Young)
It's been a while since the last time I seen you around
But your hugs are the riches that appear to kings
So many thoughts cloud my mind, like I left the ground
But all of that doesn't really mean anything
Words don't express what you really mean to me
I'm looking for another way for me to make you see
What it feels to be, so feverishly
In love with the perfect woman of your dreams
Any time you need something, I'll be there
Anywhere you are, always got time to spare
Jay Young or Jay Garrick, always by your side
In a heartbeat, never say I didn't try
We'll write a love story, or a tale of sin
Either way, I just want this thing to begin
Can't see the world without you, call me Barry Allen
Cuz without my Iris, my world gets very dim

[Hook] (Drake & Majid Jordan)

[Bridge] (Majid Jordan)

[Verse 3] (Jay Young)
Never ask you where you at, cuz you come right back
We share bonds like atom particles, we got a zap
You're the lightning, to my thunderclap
Not from the Apple, but yo boy's a Mac
You get my lines to come together like Tetris
Even though you're something I don't really need
But at the same time, you serve as my muse
You are my remedy
