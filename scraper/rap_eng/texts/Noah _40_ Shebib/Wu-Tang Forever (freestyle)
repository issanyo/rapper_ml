If you’re gonna bust a move
Might wanna bust one soon
‘Cuz time gone run…
She’s sipping up out the bottom
To savor the fun
But when the rums gone…
All the wrongs she’s done is coming back to her
And I can tell the vocals that they probably hurt
She ain’t gotta say the words, but her family curses
…Instead of giving her blessings
But I told her to sit yourself down
And I’ll teach you a lesson
It’s yours… it’s yours…
Anything you want, of course
You can have the world
It’s yours, that’s for sure
Fuck around and lose the truth

How I feel… that’s how I feel about life
They work you so hard until can’t think right
I’m just trying to find a spot in limelight
When she says, it’s yours, it’s yours
Anything you want, of course
Momma used to walk me a snobby kid to school
Lilton stole the car, she didn’t what to do but say

[Hook]
It’s yours, it’s yours
It’s yours, it’s yours
And that’s for sure… and nobody else’s
(2X)

And sometimes… when you try to treat them right
You set aside your time to improve upon their life
Just ungrateful hoes
Just give the dick all night and they let me know
It’s yours… it’s yours…
And nobody else’s
I feel the void in all her inner spaces
Don’t fight the urge
Baby, go ahead embrace it

And you ain’t got to search RapGenius
To feel where these lyrics go
Weather man, changing the seasons
From hot to cold
Put my people on my back
And I will lift up their lows
We’ll ride around in limos
With nowhere to go, bitch
And when you find gold
You also find cousins you don’t even know
But that makes two of us
Don’t confuse these lyrics
With the shit that I would or won’t bring
…mine and no one else’s
Reaching for heights
So I set off the explosives
Don’t feel me yet then
I’ll bring the heavy dosage…
Poetic gangsters singing along
If feel real recognize real
And I feel none of ya’ll
I’ll give you just 5 to fall
So you better light up your bars
And then I turn to hear her voice say…

[Hook]
