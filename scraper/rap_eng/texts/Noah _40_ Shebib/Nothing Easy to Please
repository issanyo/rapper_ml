[Verse 1]
My love, my love don't come easy, babe
I'm nothing easy to please, and I don't fall easily
Summer came and went, and I seen you in your b-i-k-i-n-i
Sitting pool side with your cigarettes
They ain't never seem sexy at all, oh, oh
I can read you from head to toe, head to pedicure
You're just a distraction babe
Looking for a reaction babe
March was good and the sex was great
But I need someone more official babe
You're just a distraction babe
And you know, know, know
Yes you know
That's why, that's why

[Hook]
My love, my love don't come easy babe
My love, my love don't come easy babe
Don't come easy

[Verse 2]
What's up with you after many-a-moons girl?
Why do you act like I'm sexist or something, just for calling you sexy
Even though we're not together, I still find you sexy
It's like a wolf hollering at the moon every time that I see ya
Girl you're bad and you break hearts for a living
You don't smile and you say you're in love, but that's why I don't love

[Hook]
My love, my love don't come easy babe
My love, my love don't come easy babe
(It don't come easy)

[Outro]
(What's up with you after many-a-moons girl?
Why do you act like I'm sexist or something, just for calling you sexy
Even though we're not together, I still find you sexy)...
