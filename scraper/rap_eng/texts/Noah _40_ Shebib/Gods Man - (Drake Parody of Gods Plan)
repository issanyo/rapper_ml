[Intro]
Yeah, they dissin' and dissin' and dissin' and dissin'
They dissin' on me, yuh


[Verse 1]
I been strolling' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna handle kids is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 12 PM to tussle with me
You know how I hate it when you through things at me
I don't wanna hide for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they dissin' on me
Hope I got some kiddies that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, things were different with me


[Chorus 1]
God's man, God's man
Sometimes it pop, sometimes It don't, yuh
I smell good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down School Cafe, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down as a Lunchaid., yeah, wait
I go hard on all the kids, yuh, wait
I make sure that they all sit


[Post-Chorus]
And still
Rad things
It's a lot of Rad things
That they missin' and missin' and missin' and missin'
They missin' bout me
Rad things
It's a lot of Rad things
That they missin' and missin' and missin' and missin'
They missin' bout me
Yuh, ayy, ayy


[Verse 2]
He say, “Do you like us?” I tell him, “Only partly”
I only love my bed and my lebrons, I'm sorry
Yo wassup, why you hatin’ on me
21, be here till you graduate
And you know me
Turn the dead bug into the funny meme, lol
Without my goatee, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met those dumb teens

[Chorus 2]
God's man, God's man
Sometimes it pop, sometimes It don't, yuh
I smell good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down School Cafe, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down as a Lunchaid., yeah, wait
I go hard on all the kids, yuh, wait
I make sure that they all sit


[Post-Chorus]
And still
Rad things
It's a lot of Rad things
That they missin' and missin' and missin' and missin'
They missin' bout me
Rad things
It's a lot of Rad things
That they missin' and missin' and missin' and missin'
They missin' bout me
