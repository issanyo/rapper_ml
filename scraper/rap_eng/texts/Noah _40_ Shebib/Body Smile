[Intro]
Oh no no no no no
Oh no no no no no

[Verse 1]
Late night I call your phone, yeah
Lately you have no time
You're looking out for you now
Finally prioritize
And I knew you were but
I could say something, yeah
Sometimes it's better when you yell than when you say nothing
But you're getting tired of explaining everything that you need
It's more water, less stress, more sex, more carefree, yeah
Don't wanna hurt no more, not over me cause
I'm not worth it and this ain't workin' and
Runnin' out of words again

[Chorus]
Now that you know
You were better than I was ready for, oh
It's not like before, no
Tonight I'm making up for it all
For every time I let you cry
I will make your whole body smile

[Verse 2]
I know you've had to accept, yeah
Apologies and haven't got it yet
That makes things hard to forget (hard to forget)
I know, hope you aren't telling your friends
That you need, more water, less stress, more sex, less of me
Looking for someone more mature than me
Somebody else who can keep better habits and
You're not having it

[Chorus]
Now that you know
You were better than I was ready for, oh
It's not like before, yeah
Tonight I'm making up for it all
For every time I let you cry
I will make your whole body smile

[Bridge]
Please don't say no
Please just say yes
Please don't say no
Please just say yes (say it, say it, say it, say it)

[Chorus]
Now that you know (now that you, now that you know)
You were better than I was ready for (yeah you)
It's not like before, no (before)
Tonight I'm making up for it all
(tonight I'm making up for it all)
For every time I let you cry (for every time, I let you cry)
I will make your whole body smile
Ooh
(I will make your whole body)
(I will make your whole body)
(I will make your whole body)
(I will make your whole body)
