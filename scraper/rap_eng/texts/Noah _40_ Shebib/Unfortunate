[Intro]
You never know how things
Gon' turn out huh?

[Verse 1]
I know you got the best love that I ever had
I swear that when I look at you, the time don't pass
Intoxicated without a sip from a glass
Infatuation was real, thought we would last

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're gone away
Thought you were gonna stay
I got deceived again
I can't believe

[Chorus]
And now you got someone who don't treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You already know who used to treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You look for me and you know I be out of sight, out of sight
Out of sight, out of sight, out of sight
When you the one who told me to get out ya life, out ya life
Out ya life, out ya life, out ya life
That's unfortunate, that's unfortunate
That you didn't believe in me

[Verse 2]
You know I got the best love that you ever had
Tell me how it feels to know you'll never get it back
Baby, tell me how our train never got up off track
Never be the same, thought our hearts were attached

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're gone away
Thought you were gonna stay
I got deceived again
I can't believe

[Chorus]
And now you got someone who don't treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You already know who used to treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You look for me and you know I be out of sight, out of sight
Out of sight, out of sight, out of sight
When you the one who told me to get out ya life, out ya life
Out ya life, out ya life, out ya life
That's unfortunate, that's unfortunate
That you didn't believe in me

[Bridge]
Pain don't last forever
I'm telling you 'cause I done been there
Hurt turns to anger, friends turn to strangers
But right now I don't care
And you'll get there, you will, you will, you will
I promise, you didn't keep
So unfortunate
Your promise

[Chorus]
And now you got someone who don't treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You already know who used to treat you right, treat you right
Treat you right, treat you right, treat you right
You look for me and you know I be out of sight, out of sight
Out of sight, out of sight, out of sight
When you the one who told me to get out ya life, out ya life
Out ya life, out ya life, out ya life
That's unfortunate, that's unfortunate
That you didn't believe in me

[Outro]
You never know how things
Gon' turn out, huh, huh, huh?
