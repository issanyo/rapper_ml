Intro...

VERSE 1

Yeah karma take a toll
Swear to God that its eating on my soul
Lemme wipe away them tears
Cuz i'm a man that real cares
Don’t fold ya hands lets just  play it a little different
Feeling that you broke damn I gotta get the fixing
Queen of spades, we changing the game
Got me burning weed bumping Tyrese shame...
Yea, like shame on me I aim to please what really need to change is me
Plain to see, really that pain is deep, its like wave to sea, still waters in the soul from the vacancy
I talk to the Lord hoping that you pray for me because I pray for you
Thinking all the shit I did it wasn't even worth it
Time was all money gotta get some reimbursement, hurting thinking that the shit is just curtains, window pain the devil on the other side smirking
Thats why I can't cry, the eyes don’t lie the truth my heart ain't fit to vibe
Yea...Love is Love heartbroken, so many words just went unspoken
But we could smooth it out I could rub you with lotion just focus
So many things you could notice, I PRAY 4 YA!!!

HOOK

I PRAY 4 YA
I PRAY 4 YA
EVERYDAY I PRAY 4 YA

Verse 2

The storm is over the war is won
Imma give you all I have cuz we started with nothin
From the fall of the moon to the rise of the sun
May I put it in his hands and his will be done

My lady you are now safe in my arms, reality swarms
Don't let it sting you are sure to be gone, I mean you no harm
Feelings are torn, feelings feeling reborn
Lets just watch the time fly as my hands keep you warm
I couldn't handle your scorn, I just want to see you walk through the door girl...I PRAY FOR YA!!!

I PRAY 4 YA
I PRAY 4 YA
EVERYDAY I PRAY 4 YA
