[INTRO: THE SARGENT]

Yeah
Yeah
Uh
Sargent
Ayy
Sargent
Ayy!

[VERSE 1: THE SARGENT]

The Sargent from the bottom of the ocean
Pressure weighing down ‘till I got shit going
Breached into the air I awoken
Three eyes open
Know my future yeah I own it
The Sargent from the bottom of the ocean
Pressure weighing down ‘till I got shit going
Breached into the air I awoken
Three eyes open
Know my future yeah I own it

[VERSE 2: THE SARGENT]

Yeah
I been killing shit since I began
Taking over been the plan since I was a lil’ man
Looking up yeah I knew that I was destined
Fire every session only shoot ‘em with extensions
With the clip and I came out the abyss
Uh
Life’s a bitch but for me she’s submissive
Always fuck a flow up
Every time I spit raps
Youngn’s ‘boutta blow up
Y’all better get back!

[VERSE 3: BRI CRISP]

Sargent from the bottom now it's weird
Thought we had a good idea
Went to eiffel tower Britney Spears
Now we sitting awkward in the car
If you don't think that we're funny bet you can't deny the bars
Sargent's grinder is a fucking mason jar
We be grinding through the work to get to becoming some stars
Baby I be Mike Vick getting yards
Baby you be Michael Vick but in his prime of fighting dogs

[VERSE 4: BRI CRISP]

I be better I be well respected
I be crisper I be well invested
Set precedents higher than you Hornswoggle's can get into
My wrist heavy
Diamonds glisten
Brian Crispy
Dying just ain't on a kid's bucket list
Who else vibing with me?
I'mma live 'till I ain't pretty
Look me in the iris tell me
Sire let me ride your Bentley
Ride or die or get arrested
Sky of fire bear a witness
Flying high 'gon topple Everest
Eyelids cry you're gonna miss him
Bri can't die I'm Mount Olympus

[VERSE 5: THE SARGENT & (BRI CRISP)]

The Sargent walking in with a spear
(The crisp’ll hold the shield if you get any ideas.)
Yeah the fire ‘boutta burn off both your ears
(Y.A. rolling through making magma out our peers.)

[BRIDGE PART 1: BRI CRISP]

Same crew since that Holy Name yeah yeah
Powder blue running through the vein yeah yeah
Shout to Jon, McGee and Jack and Dan yeah yeah
Shouts go out to Sarge and Jeff and Jake yeah yeah

[BRIDGE PART 2: THE SARGENT]

Shouts to all my people from Central Mass
Dusty Shags and everybody else
Staying on the move adding bodies to my belt
Spittin by myself
Always working
Furnace burning…

[VERSE 6: THE SARGENT & (BRI CRISP)]

Yeah The Sargent ‘boutta finger fuck the Earth!
(Crisp’ll finish with a facial when you done with all that work!)
Fuck that pussy violent got her screaming from the girth!
(Fuck that pussy violent only fuck her where it hurts!)
Certain we emerging
Verses hurtin’
Butter churnin’
Never met another mother fucker speaking sermons so disturbing
(Couple virgins ‘boutta splurge in
Erick Sermon gettin’ curved this shit is murder all the vermin out in hearses.)
Stirring up a storm when we rehearsing
(Been at this shit since twenty-thirteen.)
Writing with the hand of a surgeon
(Midget with a shotty if any these bitches tryna’ chirp please!)
