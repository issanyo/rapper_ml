I can take a L. That dosent mean imma take it well./

The day I give up a cold day in hell. So many bars I can make a jail/

We sellin out at the bake sale. We put the money on pay pal/

Y'all ain't gon keep up wit this pace. Bouta get rich off a mixtape/



Been gettin my rest like a bitch face. Y'all gonna wish we could switch places/

I only carry the switch blade. So I can see how the brick taste/

I can tell you how ya bitch taste. She can tell you how my dick taste/

Took me to dinner then paid the check. Aye Cizzle is comin, pay respects/



Yea. Bout half of our fuckin discussions is trappin and money it's actually funny/

Mix business wit business you gettin exactly what's comin it's natural it's nothin/

I'm shining been shining all year it don't have to be sunny been actin a monkey/

You'll only see me wait around when the package is comin, whoo. Flip dope no tax bracket/



Cut the throat of a back stabber/

Took it slow for a long time now I'm gassed up, I'm red lining/

Not the time to fuck around. This that time to buckle down/

All we do is run the town. All y'all do is run ya mouth/



Y'all whole crews a bunch of whack mufuckas we don't give a fuck about/

My whole family bunch of wild mufuckas that's down to chalk it out. Volpmusic/
