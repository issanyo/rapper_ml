[Verse 1: Just Jrod]
How come I can't remember your name
I figure you was smitten and was feeling the same
Together we was close but in different lanes
And now we cover up the pain with a simple exchange like
"What's up how you been girl"
We used to attract like magnates
Back then baby used to be my world
Better yet let's take it back to the past tense
Back when I used to spit the game smooth like
On Skype talking like I'm Mr. do right
On the phone 4 a.m. flirting with each other knowing very damn well its a school night
But then you add all this drama, and we add all this shame
But I add no excuses when you add all these reasons I didn't

[Hook]
Say yo name, say yo name
In some shit that don't involve you, then get mad when I call you like I'm the one to blame//
I mean dang that shit lame
You accusing me of cheating
But ain't giving me reasons, and it's driving me insane//
Use ya brain, use ya brain//
I thought you the one for me, but that insecure shit bore me, and I think it's time for change

[Verse 2: Simba]
I see you sad with your conviction
From all your blindsided infliction's
When you only have good intentions
But don't matter form your decisions
Now you look at lust to fill the pain
But there was nothing you could gain
And now your deeper than Shady's brain
And nothing will ever be the same
Your heart to him was just a fumble
So now you're in this corner troubled
And now your mind is a crumble
Even right after you stumble
Over a nigga' with no soul
But you still dared him to be bold
And so he did, you asked "why you cold"
He said "I don't even know"
Goddamn, but I can't blame him
Cause most girls just want that fake shit
Fake love and that fake pleasure
But I ain't here to be a lecture
I'm only here to be a helper
Cause these niggas' just want favors
From your tasty skin flavor
And this really ain't no love story
And this ain't for no glory
This is to show you, you was blind
In that little bit of time
You had bet it all on a dime
And now you see you were wrong
Now you're too late now I'm gone
I guess you weren't meant to see
How true love could really be

“The biggest coward of a man is to awaken the love of a woman without the intention of loving her.” - Bob Marley
