[Intro]
Just say it's all the same,
Alright I got you,
I'm on my way,
Hope you like,

[Verse 1]
You just say your on your way,
And you don't know what's going on,
See my brain melting,
They say I'm moving slow,
But maybe I think fast,
About those subjects out of class,
I don't think that they even know
Where I've been,
The girls I'd rate a ten,
Ooh that's rare,
That's one to treasure right down here,
Decisions pre made, seems unfair,
The better off, I don't think they would care,
Dreams of that money high up in the air,
All these different thoughts I wear,
I never think it helps me at all, I swear,

And I always think it's me alone,
And I can never answer to my phone,
And I just thought she should know,
That she's looking like brown gold,
My thoughts never seem to change,
Am I singing this to her,
Is it out my range,
Feelings never leave like stains,
And they seem to think that I do it for the fame,
And I say,
You just say your on your way,
And you don't know what's going on,
I believe that people change,
But don't get too attached to the the pains,
And you,
Perfect like a picture frame,
And you girl,
Bowl a strike,
That's a perfect game,
And you'll (just say it's all the same)

[Chorus]
Brand new,(2x)
Tell me what you'd like me to,
To do,
Girl will you tell me the,
The truth,
Is anything I'm doing brand to you?

[Verse 2]
Tell me is there something that I'm doing wrong?
Tell me is my time all up?
How long has the clock been gone,
And I just ask that when you see me,
That you make it worth the wait,
It's been the same routine for the last 400 days,
I just work hard instead of trying to get paid,
She asks me when the memories started to fade,
Cause if this was the case, we could never think to waste,
The time, cause time is money, but I never get paid,
Baby tell me is this still the same?

[Chorus]
Brand new,(2x)
Tell me what you'd like me to,
To do,
Girl will you tell me the,
The truth,
Is anything I'm doing brand to you?

[Outro]
Just say its all the same,
Nooohohoh, (2x)
Oohohoohoh...
