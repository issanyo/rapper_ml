[Verse 1: Drake & Lykke Li]
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
Cause you don't know, who I was before you
And basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind
(My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind)
Oh, but maybe in time (in time, in time, in time)
I'll tell you I'm—

[Hook: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you

[Verse 2: Drake & Lykke Li]
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I—
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff, cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I—

[Hook: Lykke Li]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh, well—tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably—

[Hook: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
