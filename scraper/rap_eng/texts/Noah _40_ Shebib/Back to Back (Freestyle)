Intro:
Aw man
Aw man
Reps up
U Niggas need to step up

Verse:
I learned the game from Martin Luther ion need a tutor
Back to back for the Niggas that met the karma sutra
Back to back for the Niggas that hear this and get foolish
Them Niggas that's gone get ghoulish when they get ganja through em
Woahhhh
U see the Circle Man U know we up
These Niggas bite the style and then they throw me up
We up, the lucky 4, u need to po me up
On a fast track it ain't no slowin up
Please
Somebody go and get the cuffs for him
I been had it, they sayin it must be luck for him
Nah nigga growin up it was tough for him
Now he got some Niggas in Milwaukee gettin bucks for him
Chasin pavements making payments thanks for all ya patience
U boys the lamest I'm the greatest this how I embrace it
We gon cop some bracelets then take a look at ya faces
Me and ace's take turns wit yo chick like spaces or laces
U gon make me Tyler Perry bring the pain
Gee ain't workin that shit is sounding insane
U washed up Niggas got nothing to gain
So signal right and get back in ya fuckin lane
U hatin then u gotta make ya friends hate
U Niggas pussy, I can tell it when u menstrate
Yeah
I know she ya woman crush Wednesday
But I just use her to keep the mothafuckin rent paid
Yeah
Dissin Niggas turn to missin Niggas
I do it well, u never did it nigga
I always keep the 4-5 hidden nigga
U must ain't heard Nas said it was written nigga
Make sure u swallow when u bite the style
Man hold up it might take a while
U Niggas runnin out, gave an inch u runnin miles
See me in the streets and its handshakes and crooked smiles


Hook:
Got my vibe on now it's back to back
Yeah
Now it's back to back
They tryna play along now it's back to back
Yeah
They want it back to back


Verse 2:
Ion wanna feature from ya ever again
Especially when u use me cause I'm sick with the pen
U a sucka nigga that just follow the trend
Woulda had more respect if we squashed it like men
Wooaahhhh
Niggas must ain't heard it was rebel season
Tried to ignore it, u gave me reasons
This type of shit happens to me way too frequent
Gimme 100 for my verse and now we fuckin even

Outro:
Yeah
If u wanted to be this sick all u had to do was ask
Now we knowing where u get ya style from
Reps

Hook:

Nigga
