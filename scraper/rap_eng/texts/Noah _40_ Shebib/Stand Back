[INTRO XTRA SAUCE]
Ahhh what's up pancakes?
Today's video is gonna be pretty tangy so uh let's go




[VERSE 1 XTRA SAUCE]
Aye, first of I'm a real rapper I don't need that autotune trash to make my voice sound better. A hater once called me a dork I said, "takes one to know one", I thought he would look good in a man bun, sike! He can't even grow one. I learned how to floss back in 2016, I'm fightin and fightin like I'm making the team thought the house was wood but it's really just beams. When I'm rapping it's like I'm spittin put steam. Sure I may only have a couple subscribers, but that's okay because all my songs sound fire. So please...



[Chorus XTRA SAUCE]
Stand Back while I'm spittin out bars like a heart attack. Just, stand back don't get to close to my greatness aye. Just stand back yeah




[VERSE 2 XTRA SAUCE]
And just an FWI  Logang I have better merch than you and everybody knows it's true. Shout out to redpanda202 your my biggest fan I'll send some merch to you. Pancakes, I'm your bro when you see my merch you'll think it's dope. If you were to come at me I would probably knock out your tooth. You may think I'm lying but I'm just telling the truth. So please...



[Chorus XTRA SAUCE]
Stand Back while I'm spitting out bars like a heart attack. Just, stand back don't  get to close to my greatness aye. Yeah
