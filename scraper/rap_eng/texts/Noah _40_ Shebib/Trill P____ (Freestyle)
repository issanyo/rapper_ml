[Verse 1]
Trill Papi? Bitch you never fucking on a mami
You wanna be the dopest but you're barely writing, hardly
You must not really care if you tearing up your lyrics
Your raps are stressed and micro compressed just like Cyrix
I mean, I don't even take you that serious
If you think you spitting fire then you must be delirious
I don't know why niggas commenting like "Yo is you hearing this?"
My only explanation is that they feel too bad for the kid
Damn, I just went basic to a double time
You can't drop sixteens, you barely manage fives
You could inspire a generation and save lives
But when I hear you rap it just makes me wanna suicide
It's do or die and your health running low
You better come through with some shit to show niggas you don't blow
I mean, lyrics trashier than landfills
So bad that I wanna listen to Meek Mill
Face it nigga, you a wannabe Mac Miller
You wanna flow, I'll say "don't" like Bryson Tiller
I only put you on Studio Sessions for a filler
You ain't clever when I'm a lyrical serial killer
Look at the fucking photo for the song bro
Ugly ass motherfucker look like my left toe
Go slob and choke on a dick, you don't get any hoes
If you respond I'll just be surprised that you spoke
You was planning Happy Days, it was cancelled
Probably noticed that it sound gay, what happened
When I hear you flow it feels like I'm getting ear cancer
Sit down nigga, your whole life about to be dismantled
Where do I start? You're annoying as shit
We can't make a joke without you acting just like a bitch
Sounding like a gayer, and retarded Steve Urkel
Alien looking nigga, straight outta crop circles
You stick to the tough talk, until you get shot
Metaphorical bullets with bars off the top
You's a bitch-ass four eyed faggot
So get your pen and paper ready if you up to the challenge, bitch

[Verse 2]
I learned the game from Drizzy Drake on The Language
When Trill Papi opens his mouth I'm in anguish
I'm bout to eat this nigga up like trill banquet
So cold, I think this nigga need a blanket like woah
The way you spitting is very pretentious
No Hands remix with a positivity message
Attitude switching up after a bitch left him
I wish you would just shut the fuck up for a couple seconds
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You be making verses for the niggas with no brain
Admittedly I'm not the greatest in the game
But I'd never be caught spitting RIOIP again
If you're hearing this it's too late
I was never fucking with your music anyways
You never a decent person, like on any days
You really think that Jesus piece is gonna get you laid
You more garbage than Azealea Banks
That's a shoutout to Orion, we be breaking the bank
And you's a broke ass nigga with a fucked up face
It's no wonder why Selena left you, what a disgrace
You loved her so much you talked about her every day bruh
If you some balls I wouldn't think you bitch made blur
Flirting with niggas, so quick to say you ain't gay bruh
Your sister get more pussy, shoutout Victoria
Look, you know how this shit goes
I will always kill any of my foes
As for your response, I'll be looking
So rest in peace to the nigga Trill Pussy, damn!
