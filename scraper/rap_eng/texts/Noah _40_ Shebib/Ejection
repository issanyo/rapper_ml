[Ben Arbia Hamza]

It's not mandatory
To go around, tell everyone
I'm sorry
It's not flattering,
to express your feelings
about someone or something
It's not only about giving,
it's more about forgiving



You know what?
me! you!
we're not sick ;
but our minds already are
We're not failures
until the moment we decide we are
But the question that I should ask is :
Why?
Why do we listen to the others
while we could believe in our dexterities?
Why do we kill our thoughts of changing
by the act of waiting for the opportunities?



Until what?

They say to keep the dream alive
Just tell me how if the reality
had already died

Until what?



Our society needs an ejection
But first, it needs a reflexion
What brought us here for the first time?
What made us believe in the "NO"
instead of the biggest frame
What's the difference?
Remember who you are
Maybe you're not perfect
but you're not your mistakes
You're
not your fakes



Should know that
Kings are not kings
without kingdoms to rule,â€‹
No one is homeless
unless there is no earth
circled by a moon,



Try to be loud
But not too much
Try to be free
but don't take it wrong
Try to see
but don't let them blow your vision
Try to make your choice
& not another one's decision



Life is a game
Where the players go and came
Well try to be different and not the same
Try to mark your name



It's not a question of "WAY"
more than it just a question of "MAY"
