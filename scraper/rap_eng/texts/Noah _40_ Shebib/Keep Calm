[Verse 1]
I still remember where we were
Slow it down
First time we had the nerve
First time was not rehearsed
First time was almost perfect, still
There's no such thing as too far
No, no such thing as too far
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Too far gone
Still know that we can work
Slow it down
Still know what you deserve
Still mad 'bout who we are
But no different than we were
But still
There's no such thing as too far
No, no such thing as too far
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Too far gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Should be here, but you ain't right now
Slow it down
Could be there, but I ain't right now
Both those things could be changed right now, and
I shouldn't be thinkin' about
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
What I would do if I was beside you
Slow it down
In a king-sized suite, layin' in those sheets
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
You know we work it out and I keep my eyes on you
Slow it down
You know I figured out the secrets to your body, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Chorus]
Keep calm, keep calm
Slow it down
'Cause it's now or never
I want this forever
No one does it better, babe
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Keep calm, keep calm
Slow it down
Let's get it together
I want this forever
No one does it better, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Verse 2]
I know you got your ways
Slow it down
I hope some change
I love the way you are
I'll take you either way
And if you don't come
Are you gon' stay?
And I don't wanna let you be the one that got away
Let's do anything but that
Slow it down
Oh no, oh no
I'm willing to do anything but that
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I should be there, but I can't right now
Slow it down
Could be here, but you ain't right now
Both those things could be changed right now, and
I shouldn't be thinkin' about
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
What I would do if I was beside you
Slow it down
In a king-sized suite, layin' in those sheets
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
You know we work it out and I keep my eyes on you
Slow it down
You know I figured out the secrets to your body, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Chorus]
Keep calm, keep calm (oh yeah, yeah)
Slow it down
'Cause it's now or never
I want this forever
No one does it better, babe
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
And all I can say is
Keep calm
Slow it down
And all I can say is
Keep calm
Together
Let's get it together
I want this forever
No one does it better, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe

[Outro]
Slow it down
Yeah, yeah
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Ten times, any time
Takin' our time, and I get in and slide
Slow it down
Ooh, baby
Now I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Slow it down
Now I want you all night long, babe
Slow it down
