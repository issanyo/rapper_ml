[Intro: Various Drake Songs]
The Calm -
Women need attention,therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men & say that you're the one to blame

Thank Me Now -
The good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend or left for college on me
& all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me

Take Care -
Truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break

Furthest Thing -
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now

Feel No Ways -
Now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
& you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

Teenage Fever -
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you're in too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start

Company -
I don't deserve it
At least you fuckin' know it
She's just a little too perfect, she's
Just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'ma dog

Jaded -
Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck

[Chours: Mariah Carey]
You've got me feeling
Emotions
Ayyy, Haaayeeeh, Ahhhhh

[Verse One: Jester]
Tracey after I air your dirty laundry, I think we can still get along
You told me about how he escorted you to all those mattresses you slept on
On the line you called him a creep, but you crept wrong
All these secrets I kept for too long
Rachel finished second, Naomi came first
Bet you backstabbin' bitches, never expected to hear your name ina verse
Can't even recall how we ended up fuckin', shot for me blame the first
Memories up the Avenue, down the Lane in reverse
Speak to Chris & Luke, look at all the lives I saved
Turn to Natalie & Katy, look at all the wives I made
When I stopped txtin' back, into their phones they fade
Marriages are broken, look at all the homes they wanna trade
Lauren I tried to care for your dream
I stuck to the script, you became a nightmare scene
I was right there writin', all you fucking did was stare at your screen
I'm still right here writin', but your nowhere to be seen
Stef you let them do disappearin' act, but you got tricks up your sleeve
Left Dean behind, but those pricks wouldn't leave
On all them dicks, how did you breathe
They cum & go but you act like you pick who'll achieve

[Chours: Mariah Carey]

Emotions
Ayyy, Haaayeeeh, Ahhhhh

[Verse Two: Jester]
Late night cryin' call from Michelle, left me with soakin' ears
When I pulled myself together, that's when everythin' broken appears
Gave you a shoulder to lie on, on the truth chokin' on her fears
What you saw is what you got, that's why we haven't spoken in years
Claire I nearly exposed your ways
For your actions you chose who pays
Saw a few episodes, there's a different between shows & displays
But I see where your at, saw who you became, disclose the praise
Heidi's on the front line, still feelin' alone
Those lyin' layers I wonder if your still pealin' on your own
Lyin' in his lies, truth be told you shouldn't be conceilin' your phone
From your marriage he went AWOL, fleein' home
Rochelle I still got guys goin' through their bitches call logs
But their the ones in the pound, they fall for dogs
Runnin' back for advice, around their relations my memory jogs
Sinkin' ships but I keep turnin' empty clogs
Love don't cost a thing, so let's undress what you spend
There's no place like home, let's address the end
Maybe I shouldn't press send
Fuck all y'all, in seven days I marry my best friend
*mic drop*
