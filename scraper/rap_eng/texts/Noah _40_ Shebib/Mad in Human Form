[Heart]:
Yo like for real, bro I love you
I love you, believe that
It's, it's hard out

[Brain]:
Here for a pimp, no
But for real though, like
This is, this is it dude
I feel, I feel it bro, this is it

[Mad Sadiq]:
This is it

[Major]:
Nobody can break his spirit
It's fueled by the shade thrown
And the babes boned
He continues to soak between walls of sugar
Forgetting his original quest for a soul mate
The young visionary realizes the true meaning of tlife
Live it to the fullest, be the best that you can be
There is nothing that is impossible
Mad is a living example
Coming from an oddly structured family

[Verse 1: Mad Sadiq]
Mad, Mad, woah
Yea
The fans yelling don't stop, cause their women know that I'm on top now
They say I'm saving Hip-Hop, so it wouldn't make sense to just flop down
Go ahead, hand me the crown
Cause either way I'm putting every rapper into the ground
I'm running the town, they seem to all love my style
The pop and pow, the rapping wow
The style is wild, the flow is loud but not loud enough
I tryna get the game roweled up, homie I just want my name out there
If you could feel the pain I felt
You would understand why it's so insane
The way I make it, feeling like I'm Kane out here
Choke slamming competition, my mind has an awkward composition
Am I kinda sinning cause I have two women in a calm position
Yea I'm on a mission, but at least it's not condescending
Tryna make the world a better place for my bothered children
Raised with no father, just holla
If you ever had a dollar and a dream, it's a cold world
Things and always what it seems, cause my old girl
Turned into a feen for the weed, do I owe her
Since I had a greed for the cream
I just wanted cash, I just want it fast
I just want to have everything I never had
Word to my dad, if he had been around I'd be on a different path
God passed this, burning passion to a Ahmad Jackson
Get your facts in, I been doing this since Mrs. Kasprick
Whitney in a casket, since 'Ye went crazy and did fashion
I was in the backseat, spittin' classics
Now they written no kiddin'
I was sittin' on the sidelines clinchin' and hittin'
Now I'm all-star in the first division
Yea my game is on point with the perfect precision
Building our own business the incentive is riches
PLAYA Records is the label and I'm simply gifted
I done came a long way from being soft and timid
To a vocal God with a mind that's driven
Rolling, and I'm hoping to keep my mind open
Always was the Black Sheep, but see now I'm goating
Still begging for change, but gee nobody's voting
Dirty water in the D, indeed, there's bodies floating
Killin' us, killin' us dover little stuff
The whole piece is, they hold pieces
To pop holes in people to keep peace in the communities
Then receive immunity for when they're under scrutiny
Claiming it was mutiny if they end up shooting me
But usually, I wouldn't energize this cruelty
The foolery isn't really that new to me
Soon to be moving revenue smoothly
Indubitably everybody wants to be cool with me
I ain't falling for it, keep on doing me
Cause you were absent in my struggle, that is truancy
Been wild'n out, Nick couldn't fool with me
Musically specialized and I'm soon to be
The king of this genre, Mad is a monster
Labelled me a bastard cause no presence of a father
We don't like twelve unless his name is Aaron Rodgers
My life is the main topic and there's nothing that is broader
Lastly, I'm tired of the acting
I'm backing all the real people rapping
The bad thing is the knowledge that they're lacking
Cause actually the mind is a weapon used vastly
Sadly, everybody tends ti use it badly
Casting their whole life, for a baddie
Had a clear vision but it's blinded by a fattie
A whore, still continue to perform and of course
Mad Sadiq, bro, this whole world is yours
You just gotta keep it real hardcore
You just gotta keep it real on tour and I promise that you'll rise from this Human Form
B.R.O.S.O
