[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Nobody likes to start over, over, over
Even when they know its over, over, over
When we say til death do us part
Im gon mean it from the heart

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I don’t ever wanna ex again, ex again, ex again
So if you’re plannin on exitin
Exit then
Leave me now
I don’t ever wanna ex again, ex again, ex again
Ah ah ah
And be forever my love lost

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I’ve given up of love before
I just wanna be sure that you're for sure
Cause this is my last time tryin ooh
Cause all the past guys lied when
They said they would never make the same mistakes
As a last one
All fears aside this feels so right
I’m feelin like you’re the last one
Could you be mine?
And be forever my love, love

[Hook: Eric Bellinger & Jhene Aiko]
I don’t ever wanna ex again, ex again, ex again
So if you’re plannin on exitin
Exit then
Leave me now
I don’t ever wanna ex again, ex again, ex again
Ah ah ah
And be forever my love lost

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
If we ain't gonna stay together stay together  stay together
Lets not be together be together be together..
If we ain't gonna stay together stay together  stay together
Ah ah ah
And be forever my love lost
