[Intro: Drake]
Yeah I stay down with my day one niggas and we in the club screaming

[Hook: Drake]
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one so I say
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
One more time
Fuck all ya'll niggas except my niggas
Fuck all ya'll niggas, stay down from day one so I say
(Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at? Started!)

[Verse One: Clip]
Y'all niggas don't matter, you're really unimportant
Finna hit it, get it stacked up, you already support it
Spitting flow so sick that my vision get distorted
Slow it down for you niggas, can't afford to miss a moment
Fast-forward mass euphoria
Get it from my story, yeah
Me and Stunna met before we thought the fame in store for us
Threw a couple lines down, thought it was stupid
Wrote it for my nigga, wasn't really into music
That was three years ago, now this is what I'm doing
Diving in the game, feeling like I'm parachuting
Ima win it all, I ain't really into losing
All I'm losing is my mind, isn't like I ever use it
Ima bring it hard, industry will get bruises
I'm a hard choice but a nigga finna choose it
My friends and I a package deal
All this time and I haven't still made any

[Hook]

[Verse Two: P-Stunna]
Signed a contract with Paper Stunnas in 11
Since then in the studio, that's heaven
Cause I'm with my brother, and Nameless making cash
Rollin with no other cause new niggas'll get in your ass
That's why I been in the same studio
This humid cubicle
Since I was rockin skinnies and bumpin Snoop D-O
Fucking unruly hoes
Paper Stunnas never disappoint
From emotional tracks to the hottest joints
That's why I be with the illest team
In the industry
No one as ill as we
Packin delivery
Rollin with the same niggas since the beginning
I swear to Jah the only new people I meet is the women

[Hook]

[Outro: Future]
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cuz' I'm down for my niggas
