[Hook]
I see your saaris falling to the floor
Dont be so sorry if it shows your flaws
Ive got you tempted with the drugs you need
To move your body just like madhuri
Just move your hips and dance like madhuri
Girl use your gift you know what i could see
You got potential to be better than Madhuri
Mashallah mashallah mashallah

[Verse]
The way that your coming up to me i can show you 50 shades of barz
Mr chowdhury is ready to see you i told you that from the beginning
Its been lingering arent you feeling seduced? Now its only me and you
In this room views from the W with the blinds like coronas hues got you
In the moood you
Woke up that morning wake and bake and we zoning
Heard you been long awaited for this moment
With that your lust fragrance you've soaked in oh lord
You should be blessed girl you should be blessed
Everytime you undress you posess that body mami lookin finessed
And its live and direct
Maybe i could whisper in your ear, tell you something that you wanna hear
I mean you yourself is already in the zone tryna bring you home
Its been a minute since the last time I've seen Doraville
Baby how do you feel trying cop me a feel
Can you feel how my words running through ya head
Like the way i lick my way up to make your face red
Live from the basement with baseheads
We addicted to the bass everytime its banging
Straight slanging with the baddest bitch from banglanta
Rollin with Doravillains we trillin its nothing but strictly business
So fuck speaking in tongue i can understan your body language
See you put in work when that ass starts grindin
Been a while since youve been on it
Now its time to show the Ville ATL's wildest
They dont know that you ain't new to this
From the beginning i knew that you will get used to it
Its cool now its time to bring the real you
No need for veils im tryna keep this shit real with you
Dont conceal all your fears in that make-up of yours
Because straight up girl i knew you from your toes - up
So what? you got everything to show off
Now you froze up goosebumps with your clothes off

I see your saaris falling to the floor
Dont be so sorry if it shows your flaws
Ive got you tempted with the drugs you need
To move your body just like madhuri

Tere pahloon mein raate guzaare loon
Esho dekho tumi amake ki korla
