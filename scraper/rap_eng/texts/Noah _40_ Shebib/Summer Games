[Chorus]
I think you're changin' your mind
Startin' to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now I'd rather know ahead of time
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you likin' someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 2]
I kept it decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I

[Bridge]
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea- brea

[Chorus]
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
