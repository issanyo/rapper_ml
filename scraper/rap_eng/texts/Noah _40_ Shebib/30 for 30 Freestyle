Verse 1
I never thought 2016 would end this way
Wit u on my mind
I cannot bare the road
Wit these suckers tryna kill my mode
 pass the Jane
I got nothing 2 say
Motherfvcker move out of the way
Bitch u know the sway
(yea) my beard is making me look mature
Wanna score my tendence
I don't got no time for these hoes
Dealin  real shit like I'm chapo
 Ima rule the whole Toronto
When I hit wit u a text
 tellin u that i miss u
U don't seem to hint me
Damn girl that pin must really hurt
History teacher gave me advice
She said I should be the vice
These days I cannot sleep at night
My ambition is fading away
In these days u gotta be aware
Niggas can be aggressive at night
Yall niggas think this a movie
Innocent folks get bloodstain
All of their body
Is my wife gotta get her hubby ?
Cause somebody take her from me
