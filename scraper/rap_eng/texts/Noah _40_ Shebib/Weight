Uh

Yea

Malachite

Yo yea yo
It's been a minute
Shout out to my man Mattius
I just gotta pour for a second
Blow the dust off the mic real quick

Yo

Verse 1
Feeling like I got the worlds weight on my shoulders
I'm only 24 but I'm starting to feel older
Why is life like this
Mid life crisis
If I do the math then 48 I'm lifeless
And I'm so priceless see that ain't a brag line
Rocking on a gangsta watch these are fucking bad times
Looking at the homeless man wondering that's next for me
Thinking 'bout my past life still dreaming of destiny
Looking at the beggar he begging for some cheddar
We really just the same but I'm just dressed better
God talks to me like every single day
And even though I never really hear a word he says
They say that he works in mysterious ways
I never used to fear these mysterious days
I've fallen so hard, I'm losing all my sanity
Maybe rock bottom there's the opposite of Gravity

Hook
I've been weighing all this weight
Thats on my mind mind mind
I can't believe it
No no I can't even breathe in
All this weight is on my mind

Verse 2
I can't breathe
Been knocked down hard you can see it in my knees
I done lost my job and my girl left me
Bills piling up and the numbers so hefty
It's getting so cold where ama be living
Got the landlord knocking on my door wit evictions, uh
My welfare ain't wealth there, nah
And see I couldn't get welfare
So if I started from the top now I'm here
I started from the bottom everything is so clear
I'm up all night I sleep all day
Found peace in a bottle everything is ok
But my stomach hurts, damn
Low shoulders no weight
One way to lose weight
Man I wanna call it quits and go home
My dreams are as dead as my spirit is
Debating going where the spirits live

Hook
I've been weighing all this weight
That's on my mind mind mind
I can't believe it
No I can't even breathe in
All this weight is on my mind mind mind

Bridge
I've got to go and find a way
Yea
I cannot give up
This can't be something I can't take
No no no

Verse 3
I will not lose I'll be right back
No matter how dark I saw the light man
That's who I am they tried to test me
That's a time in my life I'll never forget B
See its clear that God don't give any more than you can handle
So I light a new candle
Every time it blow out
See I live with no doubt
There's a will there's a way
I will make a way to get through everyday
There's a will there's a way
I will make a way to get through everyday
There's a will there's a way
I will make a way to get through everyday
