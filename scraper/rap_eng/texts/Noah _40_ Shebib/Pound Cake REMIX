[Verse 1: Toke]
Okay, my quad makes a mill though
Selling everything from cocaine to pills
Told em watch out,cause cocaine it kills
These niggas don't care if its your brain they spill
(Blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah)
And R.I.P. to the realest
Coast to coast, foreign cars, big buildings
They say Toke you gunna make a million
I say fuck it might as well make a killing
Maaaaaan, but while im making this cash
Shout out to them niggas that steady havin my back tint
AK is heavy (AK SHOTS) smokin on loud packs
I said its heavy (AK SHOTS) my niggas we don't lack
(No laaaaaack) This world is cold out here
You wanna make a nigga be bold out here
Shit y'all doin is old round here
Steady workin nigga no cloths round here (No cloths)
A hunnid percent work
If a nigga frontin put his ass in the dirt
If that nigga talking steal his ass goto work
They be on that creep shit niggas tryna lurk
But im sticking to the basics
Chasing money boy rollin on a basis
Smoking purp,realest boy I taste it
Smoke loud, no vacation
(Quad Boy)
This money I gotta make it
Pull out the state ticket
No time for wastin
(No time)
Im Steady paper chasin
(Woooooooo!)

[Verse 2: Thad]

Hahahahahahaaaa

McRaw, McGraw, ima fuck yo bitch raw
Dick hard, Feel long like a marathon
It's comin all the way down like her thong
(Are you ready for it are you ready
Are you really ready are you really???)
G, Abe, and Blake they all the homies
I just hope they don't become phony
All yo niggas gunna turn yo back
Become your haters and call you wack
Claim you can't even rap, and ask
WHY are you a trap rapper
Black rapper, back stabber
Black rapper trapping that's not me
I'm just a light skin nigga tryna make it OG

Kennethia: (laugh)

Thad: (Whaaa Whaaaa Whaaa Whaaaaaaaaaaa)
[Hook]

Thad: I'm not done yet fam

Gag me with a spoon

Bake, bake bake bake bake bake
Sittin at lunch all I do is eat cake
Adrenaline rush, your girl on my nuts
Feelin my stuff, tryna make me nut
While I touch her butt

You just a dude from across the street
Jerome: Yo lil dude from across the street, lemmi hold a dolla


Timberland: Dolla Dolla billz y'all
