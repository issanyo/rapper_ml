[Verse 1]
I won't make you pull out
Getting it all tonight
(All that I want)
I just wanna go down
In history how you like
(Wanna be the one)
As the one who makes you comfortable
Cause your lips, they got me feeling very vulnerable
The way that you speak to me, freak with me
Gives me a rise

[Chorus]
And I think we're
In too deep
Don't wanna pull out
And I think we're
In too deep
Don't wanna pull out

[Verse 2]
Don't you, baby, pull out
We're right where we're supposed to be
I just wanna go down
You know I'm what you want, complete-ly
And I just wanna be clear
We're doing right, what we're doing works
(Feels like I'm almost there, oh yeah)
The way that you speak to me, frequently
Gives me a rise

[Chorus]
I think we're
In too deep
Don't wanna pull out
I think we're
In too deep
Don't wanna pull out

[Outro]
No
Yeah, yeah
Oh I wanna know
