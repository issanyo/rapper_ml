Uh

Verse 1:

Back then they thought that
I would end up as a nobody
But then I turned around
And showed them I was somebody
I used to wanna fit in but now am standing out
Painting pictures with my songs
Just for them to see

The boy made it
He made money
And now they know him
And all the girls that used to snub a nigga getting closer
Never trust these girls
That was what my brother told me
Spend sometime on my own trynna write a story

Say the feelings never matter
So why do you care
I saw that look on your face the last time we met
Don't you ever think that we will ever be the same
I was young and immature
I didn't know what love is

It's kinda crazy cuz I still don't really know about it
I used to wanna pop the valium for anxiety
All this voices in my head got me so dizzy
I hear you hating on the boy
But you still tripping

While you all up in my business I remain busy
I just wanna say bless like my nigga Coby
I'm just all about the stacks
And how the flow is golden
And that's the only way I forget to be heartbroken

Congratulations that's the only thing I wanna hear
You should sit back and relax
It's kinda crazy here
11pm Barz then I got 11 cars
I'll prolly buy me a rocket so I could go to Mars

Rocking all these ice just to hide these scars
My life is all about progression
I ain't falling back
To old habits and ways mehn I am done with that
Just wanna be a success I'm trynna reach the heights

And sometimes I really feel lonely
You gotta know there's more to life than watching others live it
Still addicted to success
And allergic to failure
Out of sight but never out of mind

Spit this verses on the beat
I'm trynna speak my mind
I miss the good old days but I cannot rewind
I hope my future kids would look at me and say they proud
Pray the haters live long and get to see me shine

Hook :

Yeah
Letter to nobody
They thought that i was nobody
They thought that i was nobody yeah yeah
So I wrote this letter to no one
Never let what they say get to your heart yeahhh
Cuz you are somebody
You are yes you are
You are yes you are
You are yes you are

Verse 2:

And although I ain't perfect I remain worth it
That's why I try my best to never make the same mistakes
Always keep the hustle going
Got no time to rest

And so my niggas always tell me I remain the best
Played a lot of games but I'll never play your heart
And when I tell you that I love you
Just know it's a fact
Always tried to hide my feelings

So I let em out
To let you know that I ain't never giving up on you
Take you places that you never been
Show you things that you never seen
Put these words in your memory
Cuz I'm the realest you will ever meet
And I ain't really got no time for beef

Damn
Yeah
That's how it goes
Life isn't fair everybody knows
You gotta make some sacrifices
For the ones you love
I see some niggas working hard to make ends meet

Sometimes they meet their ends without making the ends meet
All these things going on makes a nigga scared
But the future is bright so we ain't gotta fear
Whatever thing that's going on is only temporary

And if you don't understand me
Go check your dictionary
We all have different problems that we dealing with
But you should never let them hinder you from living life
Remain happy
And Give freely
Remain blessed

I hope this song lifts you up
When you feeling down
Let these words touch your heart
And let em feed your soul
And don't you forget to pray
Cuz that's a major key
If they ever tryna hurt you
They will not succeed

Enough of sounding inspirational
I would have caught a grenade for you
But then it blew up
I remember all those nights when would stay up late
Those times when I would fall asleep
And you'd be on my mind

Spit these verses on the beat
I'm trynna speak my mind
I miss the good old days but I cannot rewind
I hope my future kids would look at me
And say they proud
Pray the haters live long and get to see me shine

Outro:

Hey man I just wanna say im happy with what you are doing out here mehn
And I want you to keep inspiring us with your music
We got your back no matter what
Just don't let no one discourage you from doing what gives you joy and don't loose focus
Uhh
Call me when you get this message
Bye
