[Intro]
You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say
You want my love, but you want it your own way
You're left or right, depending on the day
You're not ashamed, your feelings always change
Lately, lately, I don't like what I've been going through
But I gotta keep my chest from falling for you
I can't, I can't, I can't enter the danger zone
But I open up to someone so cold

[Hook]
(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
You don't know what to say
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)
Want it your own way
(You're left or right, depending on the day)
Your feelings always change
(You're not ashamed, your feelings always change)
You're not ashamed

[Verse 1]
Are you with me, or are you against me
'Cause when I see you, you move too quickly
Fifth time in the week and you're leaving
Then we don't even speak on the weekend
Next week, it's baby forgive me
This time it's different, believe me
Different day, but the same old story
Not ashamed of the way you ignore me

[Bridge]
Prove yourself to me
Prove yourself to me
'Cause I'm not the type to give it up for no reason
Show yourself to me
Tell me who you wanna be
But you always got to leave (show me)
(But I open up to someone)

[Hook]
You're not ashamed
(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
You're not ashamed
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)
But you want it your own way
You're not ashamed
(You're left or right, depending on the day)
Depending on the day
(You're not ashamed, your feelings always change)
Your feelings change

[Verse 2]
You love me, you hate me
You want me, but then you resent me
I'm ashamed of the way that you treat me
Scheming for you is too easy
What's your number, I'm about to delete it
Same mistake, I'm about to repeat it
We're both too drunk to be speaking
I'm not playing this game (game, game)

[Bridge 2]
'Cause I'm not the type, to give it up, give it up, no
Prove yourself to me
Tell me honestly
You could show yourself to me, but
(I open up to someone)

[Hook]
You're not ashamed
(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
You're not ashamed
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)
Said you wanted it your own way
You're not ashamed
(You're left or right, depending on the day)
Depending on the day
(You're not ashamed, your feelings always change)
Your feelings change

[Verse 3]
You're lying to my face (you're lying to my face)
Driving me insane (driving me insane)
Playing all these games (playing all these games)
You're lying to my face
Texting things I can't erase

[Hook]
You're not ashamed
(You wanna talk to me, but don't know what to say)
Ooh, you're not ashamed
(You want my love, but you want it your own way)
Ooh, you want my love, but you want it your own way
(You're left or right, depending on the day)
Left or right, depending on the day
(You're not ashamed, your feelings always change)
Your feelings change

[Outro]
You wanna play with me and act like we're ok
You want my love, but you want it your own way
You're left or right, depending on the day
You're not ashamed, your feelings always change
