[Intro]

Feel the gentle breeze
It's senior season
Pack the jackets in the attic
Cherries are blossoming
Birds chirping
And Ye’s back too!
This a dope trip around the sun, son

[Verse 1]

Yeah, I know it’s Monday morning I still snooze the alarm
Living the dream second semester senior year you feel me mom
We pull up to school screaming whoopity scoop
Grades pssh we too cool as I dap up my dudes
Got an A in math class but an E in gym class?
I have a B in this class do I have to be in this class
Parents are filing taxes but we got more important brackets
So we spend lax practice arguing bout March madness
Auditorium's packed for the open mic
Stay for the ball game it’s senior night
Boolin downtown KFC and some KF Tea
But by 2am a different drink got us acting all crazy
Dang a different drink...homies are crazy
But we still livin it up baby
Y’all excited for tomorrow?
Get pumped because

[Chorus 1]

We got some cash and we got the whip, so we boutta go on this trip
85 on the dash be careful don’t crash, this is the life we live
Yeah, we got some cash and we got the whip, so we boutta go on this trip
85 on the dash be careful don’t crash, this is the life we live
Said we got some cash and we got the whip, so we boutta go on this trip
85 on the dash be careful don’t crash, this is the life we live
We got some cash and we got the whip, so we boutta go on this trip
85 on the dash be careful don’t crash, welcome to the life we live

[Verse 2]

With this traffic flow we switching to the HOV lane
With this rappin flow I’m switching to HOVs lane
Okay I see you in the rearview
Ayy that’s the Chesapeake Bay
Inside the Baltimore tunnel just me and my friends
Man there’s the light seems like we approaching the end
Cruising to Philly so we scream free Meek
Eat three cheesesteaks take pictures with Bentleys
Terminal market 4 bucks for one cannoli?
Whatever when we get big we gon consider that cheap
Come back blast Blonde and we all fall asleep
Yo let’s hit up New York next week

[Hook 2]

We got some cash and we got the whip, so we boutta go on this trip
85 on the dash be careful don’t crash, this is the life we live
Yeah, we got some cash and we got the whip, so we boutta go on this trip
85 on the dash be careful don’t crash, this is the life we live
We got some cash, and we spent the cash
We got the whip let’s get in the whip
So we boutta go on this trip, that was a really fun trip
85 on the dash, 55 on the dash
Be careful don't crash, please don’t go too fast
This is the life we live, we still got a life to live

[Verse 3]

Been to 5 cities this month
Mom’s been worried the whole time
We’ll take over the world one day
But look how far we’ve come, that’s something to appreciate
So it’s awesome feeling free with no responsibilities
The flow I’m on is killing trees before I’m gone I’m chilling with these
My homies…together
We’ll soak in the scenery
Like fast Fouriers we’ve transformed
So much in the past four years
In four years will we still hang out and FaceTime?
I hope so but let’s cherish this moment in spacetime

[Hook 3/Outro]

We got some cash and we got the whip
Are y’all enjoying this trip?
25 on the dash the trees flying past
Let’s take it slow and just live
Let’s drive slow and just live
Let’s take it slow and just take it slow and just...

Cause WE GOT SOME CASH AND WE GOT THE WHIP
So we boutta go on this trip
85 on the dash be careful don’t crash
This is the life we live
Yeah, we got some cash and we got the whip
So we boutta go on this trip
85 on the dash be careful don’t crash we loving this life we live
Loving this life we live
Yeah
