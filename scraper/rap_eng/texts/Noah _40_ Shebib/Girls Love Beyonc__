[Verse 1: King-D Tha Problem]
Uh, Look I know that girls love Beyonc√©
But hate being the second option
Girls hate when these dudes play with them
Cause all girls want is commitment
A relationship they can live with
Lifelong loves their intentions
But most dudes just wanna hit it
And too ashamed to admit it
And now I know why Drake says
No new friends no, no, no
You should know most dudes don't
No, they don't really want
To know how you feel but rather how it feels
And when you're nowhere near your peers
And you're by yourself
Can you

[Hook: King-D Tha Problem]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you if you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady, baby why the sudden change
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Ooh say my name, say my name, if no one is around you

[Verse 2: King-D Tha Problem]
Yeah, uh say my name, say my name
Like something crazy just happened
And you wanna see my reaction
What's up with all of the acting
What's up with all of the snapping
What's up with all the attitude
That makes me mad at you
At times I don't think I know
More than half of you
I swear I feel just like Drake would
No new friends no, no, no
That's just how it's gon' go
Leave with me or leave me alone
Don't go playing games
Like making multiple calls on my phone
Filling up my voice mail
And sending texts that are way too long
With details in every message
Tryna explain how I am wrong
All I want of you
Is just to shut up and let us move
On to another subject
So we can slowly forget
And think of things other than ourselves
Then we can move on and prevail
And I'm really getting tired of all this bull
Cause I don't wanna fight no more
I know that you don't wanna cry no more
Honestly what are we fighting for
Baby Imma keep it real
If you're done playing games
Imma hit you on your cell
So that you can say my name, say my name
