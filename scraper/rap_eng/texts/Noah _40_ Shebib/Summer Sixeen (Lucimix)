Girl, did you forget
That I'm only sixteen?
Summer orange on the beam
I feel like Bimmy with the Preme
Couple shooters quarterbacking
You could catch a bullet, you could wide recieve
You can catch me with the team
Representing 17

Niggas want me dead
Tell all them niggas come do something
Everybody and they mother a tough one
But when it's action, they don't do nothing
I don't play games, I don't say names
My brothers know who I be fussing 'bout
And Bin Laden got the deathly hollows in the G-U-N, so we could bust it out
Go ahead and call your bluff, go ahead, I'll give you the floor, nigga
Ask around, I ain't been the same person since I dropped Noir, nigga
We could leave you in the sky floating, leviosa wingardium
That's word to your mother, your father, and guardian

It ain't personal, it's just business
We gon' get this, God as my witness
Just wait till summer come, it's lit like Christmas
And all the hating ass niggas on the hitlist

Round here, everybody sound the same here
So I don't really fuck with locals
Man, I'm tired of being coastal, that's why I'm tryna get the postal
Sorry, you don't get the lingo, lexicon is kinda crazy
My ebonics kinda crazy, blame the city, cause it made me
0-7-0-sixty five, Prison City, come inside
Better get yourself a gun, everybody taking lives
Kidnappers and the rapists, tell the children stay inside
Walking round here ain't safe, kid, you better Uber you a ride

Switch the flow up like, "Versace, Versace"
Cooking work up like Hibachi, Hibachi
Snatching eyes like Uchiha, Itachi
Light niggas up like Hatake, Kakashi
Maruchan Ramen, I'll cook up your top
Come in my kitchen, got work in the pot
Rap game like the crack game where I'm at, man
So I'm cooking up revenge
