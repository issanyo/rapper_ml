[Verse 1]
Remember when your body was on top of mine?
Girl you know I wanted to be inside
You get me worked up on these games we played
Now you keep me feeling up, wishing that you'd stay
You got me feeling so good
I know you'd be better, more than I know you would
You keep pushing me in, all the way through
The more I heard you, the more I knew it was true

[Verse 2]
I kept you going down, all the time
We'd mess up, but in the end, we were both fine
We'd think about it a lot, don't deny it
You were so good, I wonder if I'd still fit?
Ooooo girl, you get me going more and more
We're in ecstasy girl, that's for sure
Pull me tighter, mess with your hair
Oooo my baby, tonight we're not playing fair

[Hook]
Widow's Peak
We be going high up the mountain, Widow's Peak
Exploring everything [mumble] now, Widow's Peak
I fucked up on that one, I was supposed to adlib on that but I didn't
Um, Widow's Peak
These lyrics are from 2013 so it doesn't matter

[Verse 3]
I had you all to myself, and you had me
When we'd be together, we'd be going at it freely
Now the sheets are cold, and the room is quiet
Judging from the way I hear it, all I get is silence
You keep me intoxicated, drunk on you
The more I didn't want it, the more I had to have you
You keep me intoxicated, drunk on you
The more I didn't want it, the more I had to have you

[Hook]
Widow's Peak
Ooo, Widow's Peak
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Widow's Peak
(I'm just making shit up on the spot now, sorry)
Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, We don't speak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak, Widow's Peak
Widow's Peak, We don't speak, We don't-
Widow, Widow, Widow Widow Widow Widow
Widow Widow Widow...
