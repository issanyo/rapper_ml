Preach Remake

[Intro]

[Verse 1: R3DONE]

Writing these sermons as verses flipping through verses of the scripture
Reading how Jesus loves each one of sinners and impacted culture
That how I model my life
Still want a modeling wife
But that I mean she model it like
Proverbs 31
Spirit filled Woman is all I want
Catching feels it could be fun
But To be honest, lately I feel like drake
Thinking bout my ex, what a big mistakes
I'm too picky, I don't wanna settle
Still you're the one that's calling me shallow
While you judging based on appearance
That's a guarantee death sentence
Calling out the black of the kettle bell
Weights I swing like a pendulum
As I pump this iron
It's Shots you're firing
I better go set the bar higher then Huh?
(Pop one for me, pop one for me..)

[VERSE:R3DONE]

Telling you to preach does implies
That your not leading youth to their demise
Speak the gospel not just the point of view from eyes, no lie
I don't care if you running the 6 8 or 10
You are not even God its so odd you would try to pretend
This is no diss to you or your friends
Don't want you to miss before He comes back again
Wrote this song with hopes it will reach
Class is session I hope I can to teach
Instead They say (preach, preach)
They calling me bishop I'm wishing they wouldn't
Because I don't feel like one
Even though I hear him calling me son
I'm from prophetic genetic
It's wrote in my Chemical make up
I wake up and get it
Hearing His voice say that I should take the next step
Don't focus on the struggle but just focus on my help
Meek won't say it but I will
The only way to live is to give your life to Christ not ya feels
But what's real!
