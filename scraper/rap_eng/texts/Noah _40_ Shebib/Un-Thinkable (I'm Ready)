[Verse 1]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight, who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you while it comes to me
If you have something to say, you should say it right now
(You should say it right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)

[Verse 2]
I know you said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gonna do something about it, we should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)

[Bridge]
Sayin'
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I can't compare
I'm suspended it the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

[Chorus]
I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
