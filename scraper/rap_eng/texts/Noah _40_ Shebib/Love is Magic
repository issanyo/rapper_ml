[Chorus]
(Sample: From Time by Drake featuring Jhen√© Aiko)
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us

[Verse]
I graduated but didn't attend the ceremony
Because the honour wasn't really much to cherish for me
Imagine being on stage with teeth barely showing
Stomach in chest out, with the camera's glowing
For a qualification you'll never glorify
More than getting excessive plays on Spotify
Or Soundcloud, around town they know the guy
The calling was too loud to nullify
A hundred times, I swear, I tried to deviate
And I was wishing that Modimo could just mediate
I broke down, no tow truck to see me straight
Psychologist saying that I'm in need of space
But I'm already lonely, though I'm hardly alone
On a journey I shouldn't be embarking alone
Pack of 10s and a 6 pack I party alone
Say hello to the real me I promised to show
Hi, nice to meet you
I'm hoping that we can connect as people
I'm learning with time to silence my ego
But, being humble don't mean that I can't be lethal
I'm killing you if I need to, I'm killing you if I need to
Your honesty can sometimes lead me on to a sequel
I'd probably be a nice guy if I wasn't so evil
Because I'm vulnerable the most whenever I'm living see through
Transparent it's hurting like I'm a homophobe
And 'fuck you' to all the homophobes
My cousin's the realest person I've ever known
And he was living gorgeous way before they invented phones
So get a load of this reality
For all the tough times that you battle in
A little bounce you can party to
And heres the needed magic to get you through all your Varsy Blues
.. Yes

[Chorus]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us
