Verse 1
Woke up on the street,people changing on me Almost got me killed,people hating on me
Now I got the crowd,they wanna take em from me
Oh I got a Glock,you better stay clear from me
A hundred for those brothers that always feeds me
Without you ima life shit'll be different with me
A big up to momma,you always gat me
Of all the shits have done,you kept on praying for me


Chorus  1
God's plan , God'S plan
I give thanks,sometimes I don't
I do good,sometimes I don't
Tho I smoke it's not my fault
That stuff really put me on
For all those times I feeling off
Like D.A.D it kicks me up

[Post-Chorus]
And still
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin' They wishin' on me
Bad things It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin' They wishin' on me

Verse 2
She said do you love me ? I told her girl am sorry
I only love my girl and my momma am for real
City boy,that's what this ladies call me
21,am getting old,I should get married
Then you know me
Handful of dem niggas wanna friend me
Without mommy,daddy there'll be no me
Imagine if I never met dem oldskies


Chorus 2
Gods plan gods plan
Have never done this on my own
Someone got me from day old
You got me,damn you got my team
That stuff really put me on
For all those times I feeling off
Like D.A.D it kicks me up

Post-Chorus]
And still
Bad things It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin' They wishin' on me
Bad things It's a lot of bad things That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin' They wishin' on me
