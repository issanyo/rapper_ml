[Verse 1]
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feels like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (brand new) Brand new (brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (ay, ay, ay)

[Verse 2]
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (brand new) Brand new (brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (ay, ay, ay)
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late

[Bridge]
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new
Show me if this is brand new
New, new, new, oh, yeah
