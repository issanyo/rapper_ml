Kinda glad
That I'm old
Super glad
That I made it
To watch history
Told
Thru the eyes
Of major
I Owe Nobody no favors
Man I'm just stacking my paper
To get my aunts & uncles
A couple furs & them gators
Snap
Let me throw a couple
Lines on the track
Slow this bitch down
Then bring it back
I'm Writing screen plays
Shid
You can act
& Handing out
Head shots
Counter that
Light some green man
We Gon need
A pound of that
Light an incense
Then gotta hit the
Light switch
Cause I been
Grinding off this music
All day and
Bout the hit the night shift
