[Verse 1]
What do I have to do to get to you?
What do I have to say to make you mine?
No text or call could show you what I'll do
So put the phone down, girl, and come by

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me what it is you need
Show me what my eyes don't see
Baby, I could let you breathe
Baby, I could let you live
Show me what you want from me
Tell me and I'll make it real
Hand on my heart, I will
Show me how you really feel

[Chorus]
I just wanna lay you down
I wanna let you know, baby, we don't
We don't need words, let your body talk
Baby, don't speak, let your body talk
So much to say
This is the only way to say it
We don't need words, let your body talk
Baby, don't speak, let your body talk

[Post-Chorus]
Body talk, body talk
Baby, don't speak, let your body talk
Body talk, body talk
Baby, I can't get enough, no
Body talk, body talk
Baby, don't speak, let your body talk
Body talk, body talk, yeah

[Verse 2]
Time seems to slow down with you (when I'm with you)
And days seem to blur in my mind (in my mind)
There's nothin' else that I'd rather do (no, no, no)
Than hear you out and help you unwind (I need you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me what it is you need
Show me what my eyes don't see
Baby, I could let you breathe
Baby, I could let you live
Show me what you want from me
Tell me and I'll make it real
Hand on my heart, I will
Show me how you really feel

[Chorus]
I just wanna lay you down
I wanna let you know, baby, we don't
We don't need words, let your body talk
Baby, don't speak, let your body talk
So much to say
This is the only way to say it (only way I know)
We don't need words, let your body talk
Baby, don't speak, let your body talk

[Post-Chorus]
Body talk, body talk
Baby, don't speak, let your body talk
Body talk, body talk
Baby, I can't get enough, no
Body talk, body talk
Baby, don't speak, let your body talk
Body talk, body talk, yeah (oh, oh)

[Outro]
Here we are
Livin' free, my love
Here we are
Livin' free, my love
