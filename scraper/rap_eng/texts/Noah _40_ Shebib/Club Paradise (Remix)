[Verse 1] (D-Mayne)
Don't believe all the things that you been hearin' 'bout me
As times change, people changin' how they feelin' 'bout me
I think about how this is never where I thought I'd be
But then again this is where everybody wanna be
Let's just slow it down been, living fast for awhile and
I need someone to make me feel, like all of this is still real
Yeah, I guess I never learn from my mistakes
So maybe one more time is all it takes before I break
And they just wanna have the quickest lifestyle
But just know that those who live it wanna switch the lights out
I always try to live it for the here and right now
So just hold on to me girl, I need to feel this right now

[Hook] (D-Mayne)
Tell me, who did I leave behind
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so, caught up, in where, I am, right now
But believe I remember it all

[Verse 2] (Jay Young)
They say I've changed over the past couple years
But all I've seen is a change in my number of peers
Old friends turning into new enemies
And all I have to show for it is people who are insincere
Damn... This life is something that I chose to live
It's funny how I have haters but I'm not that big
I keep to myself to try and avoid the trouble
But it seems like my absence just makes it doubles
I swear these people don't realize what I go through
Step into my shoes, for a point of view
No Crip gang, but I carry too many blues
I just want things back to how they used to be
I know I've changed, that little fact doesn't escape me
Man of the house, I feel the pressure that's on top of me
Stumbling through life, inexperienced, I'm a trainee
They predicted I would fail, well I disagree
Yeah, overachiever on the inside
Nicknamed Russell for the way that they see my pride
All I want is to live life to the fullest
But it all feels foreign to me, I'm just a tourist
Damn... I feel like I need you by my side
Close to an epiphany, you're the one that I confide
I tell everyone that I can't feel the pain
But when I think about it, I really can't maintain

[Hook] (D-Mayne)

[Verse 3] (Jay Young)
It seems like everyday, there's a new problem
They keep piling up, I don't have time to solve them
I'm stuck in a rut, I've turned predictable
My social life gone, it don't exist no more
Damn... I never thought that I'd end up here
I feel like I've wasted too many precious years
The girl that I love, is with another man
And I'm just stuck on where I'm suppose to go from here
And I'll admit, I'm going through some stormy weather
No Marvin's Room, but I think you could do better
Want her to be happy, even at my expense
But I don't know what's worse, the pain or the building stress
Thought I was at a point, where I wouldn't care no more
But she broke into my heart and then she filled the void
She brought me happiness, something I had not felt
Since my ex had put my love through a burning Hell
I want her next to me, she's on somebody's arm
The more I think about it, the more it hurts my heart
No tears shed, my reservoir is dry
I can't help but feel like I lost a part of life
Memoirs flow the way I reminisce on life
Spit my heart and pour my soul all up on this mic
Before it's too late, and the years go by
I wanna pull her close and whisper in her ear like, like...

[Hook] (D-Mayne)
