[You-C:]
Fuck what I said in the past, it's what I say today
And if these niggas try to leave, they weren't meant to say
You understand, that when you become a star
These niggas wish on your fame and forget about who you are
Fuck, and I just only want to do me
But it's hard when you're surrounded by these groupies
And these bitches try to all fall in love, but my heart flies south
So they all want to screw me
Damn, and I'm the son of a chef y'all
So my bread stacks tall to the death y'all
And rest in peace is what my heart would say
But my mind is thinking 'bout these skyscrapers turning grey y'all
Cause life is something I get high off
And when I'm sober, it is something I would die for
Cause to America, I'm just another black rapper
But to my family and friends I'm a good actor
And to these girls, I'm a dick for them to hop on
And to their boyfriends, I'm dangerous, python
To all these haters who wish they were at my wake
Like Wu Tang, I need that C.R.E.A.M., so I bake a cake
And when it's done they like, I don't even know you
Welcome to Chi-Town, don't let my city ruin you
I know I'm wise, but I'm acting like I'm stupid
Cause I'm a star and this a war, George Lucas
