Doesn’t make sense now
You had a lot to say back then oh you wanna be friends now?
Dont tell me that you have plans and you still care dont pretend now
I had you from the very start baby i dont really wanna end now
That’s the last thing she said now, we not really even friends now
I remember the times that we used to
Now you telling everybody that i used you
Goddamn, you telling 'em i ain’t shit
I'm actin’ up but I haven’t really made shit
Woah, that was hurtful
You will never be allowed in my circle
So i move on, time for me to mix it up
But late nights shawty why you gotta hit me up

Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me
You dont ever come to me

All she talking bout is
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me
You dont ever come to me

We like to talk about our exes
Like they the ones who fucked up
But think about the past and the ass of the bitches that you kept on the side, man you fucked up
That’s the truth, and it’s so damn ugly
I’ve gone thru hell so i’m sorry if i question every time you claim that you love me, yeah
Personal baggage
I rap from the soul so i’m better than average
Love is a trip cause there’s stuff in between
And you gotta be better than a plain old sandwich
Is this real love?
Would you tell me please?
Every man was a dog in the game until he fell hard then realised that nothing was the same

Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me
You dont ever come to me

All she talking bout is
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me
You dont ever come to me

Heart beating fast speeding thru the highway
She the type of girl that would chill and be real no drama on a Friday
And i need that. so i need her
I was going thru the motion now i’m filled up with emotions and i’m scared cause my knees hurt
Feels like a rebirth, just like good dressing on my Caesar
Thank God for even giving me the blessing of the chance of having to meet her
I got my mind set now so
This time around you will never have to ask to

Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me
You dont ever come to me

Now she never say
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You dont ever come to me
You dont ever come to me
