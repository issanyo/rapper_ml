[coughs] Check. Talk to em'
Look

[Verse]
This is dedicated to the ones that I adore
We ridin' through the city to see what I do it for
I always been the type to leave it all on the floor
And my heart can show a surgeon that he'd never seen before
Im down to one life, I've gotta make the best of it
Im sayin fuck haters, they just make the rest love it
It's not much anymore once they talk less of it
Im just tryna do it better than the fuckin best does it
Love is never promised, and happiness never sure
I've experienced the pain that money could never cure
Friends are never real, motives are never pure
Motivation is key to success, has to be deserved
Nothin is reserved, but I hope you understand fate
You wouldn't understand my heart, Im just tryin to translate
Dinner with the future I don't order I demand cake
But tomorrow is never promised, so I could never plan dates
Women waitin on me, keeps the hope in you
Before I place an order, I just skim the whole menu
Im nothin like, any other man you ever been through
I put that on the pieces that your heart was broken into
The minute shit change, time is out to share
Look what I became, I forgot that you was there
You can go your separate way, I admit that isn't fair
I couldn't balance out life with love, it wasn't clear
But I ain't tryna make up, it's history that I'm makin
I was still growin up, I'm sorry to keep you waitin
Shit I woulda came back, I was waitin for the right time
But now it's over, but memories last a lifetime
Time has gotten feelings hurt, made me better
When I'm told I can't do it I, do it with pleasure
So when my losses gonna turn into treasure
They say legends never die, well how long is never?
I wonder where I'd be if didn't get on that stage
That I eventually inherited at such a young age
My big brother taught me well that's it's forbidden to be afraid
Now my rhyme book got history written on every page
Im gifted in many ways, I see limits are illusions
What's considered impossible is, simply what im doin
I wonder if my old friends are proud to say "I knew him"
Im tryna bring pride to the city that I grew in
I stayed up for extra practice past curfew
I left the field with better skills and dirty shoes
Painful experiences I had to learn to work through
Well rap has got awards with names fuckin deserved to
That wasn't meant to hurt you, I'm just bein honest
I was always nice, I took y'all took advantage to my kindness
But nevermind now, check it I got this
Stand on the sideline, and witness what I accomplish
When your heart is bigger than the obstacles in front of you
When you do more than they expect that you're gonna do
I guess one it's chance to show 'em all what's it comin to
I swear y'all could neva walk a mile in my runnin shoes
How could you forget? Was it hard to remember me?
It's cool I re-success, and refresh ya memories
You thought I wouldn't make it, when will you ever see?
Now watch I become what you imagined I could never be
The more pressure generates the more energy
Fugitives in front of me, family standin next to me
I'll make somethin' of myself until there's nothin left of me
I'll give it all I got and I'll let heaven get the rest of me
The world can keep the best of me, I hope it last forever
And after I pass, I hope afterlife is better
I won't forget my past, seein the time we had together
Every single moment was a moment to remember
