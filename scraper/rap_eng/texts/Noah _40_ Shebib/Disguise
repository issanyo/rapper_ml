[Verse 1]
Left all of my old women in the past
Could be twerkin' shakin' they ass for money
Most of these bastards dummies
But I could give a fuck less
I left stress the same time that we separated
We knew our roles
Expectations was delegated
I made sure you knew what lines not to cross neither
I'm an artist but the lines I crossed made flaws deeper
No whiteout, like it's all Beiber
I wanted things to even out like a score keeper
Cameras rolling, could put us on Cheaters
She did it I did it back now it's all even
But the odd thing is it never made it better
Hearts gettin' broken, Kleenex gettin' wetter
I could still see 'em falling from her eyes
That make up don't make up a disguise...just keep tellin' her lies

[Hook]
Aye, Aye, Aye
Just keep telling her lies
I could still see 'em falling from her eyes that makeup don't make up a disguise, just keep telling her lies
Aye, Aye, Aye
Just keep telling her lies
I could still see 'em falling from her eyes that makeup don't make up a disguise, just keep telling her lies

[Verse 2]
I tried to tell her "don't trust shit, not even mirrors
You could look good in the crib but the mask scare her"
Last of a dying breed, the last era
Of niggas that'll tell bitches they made they last error
Now you gotta leave her
You ain't never need her
Could spill her whole bio, Wikipedia
For the thots, my nigga we know her whole story
Random bathroom encounters she got her whole glory
She test ya' patience we saw results, the old Maury
She crying on the phone, sob story
But who really tryna hear that shit?
I tell her "breathe, but don't air that shit"
She ask me if I care bout shit
And truthfully I think the answer no
I'm out, as soon as I get the chance to go
Life stressful enough as it is
Ain't got time for wife and a kid
That's just how it is
Damn...But do that make me a bad person?
A man without virtue? The situation worsens
But I gotta repeat I give a fuck less
My new attitude, fuck stress
And when I feel like I'm movin' even better
Hearts still gettin' broken, Kleenex even wetter
I could still see 'em falling from her eyes
That make up don't make up a disguise...just keep tellin' her lies

[Hook]
Aye, Aye, Aye
Just keep telling her lies
I could still see 'em falling from her eyes that makeup don't make up a disguise, just keep telling her lies
Aye, Aye, Aye
Just keep telling her lies
I could still see 'em falling from her eyes that makeup don't make up a disguise, just keep telling her lies

[Verse 3]
A third verse, what's the reason I'm still writin'?
We arguin' back and forth, why we still fightin'?
We both know this ain't healthy for either one of us
That spark won't strike twice, its like lightnin'
We like oil and water baby we don't mix
I can't give up the game, I won't quit
Thats just how I was raised, I'm very determined
I follow my urges
Being faithful's a burden
Ironic I did her dirty, I'm clean as detergent
She want what she see on screen, that shit is disturbin'
Nah, I can't compare to a fairy tale
This more of Tyler Perry play if you ask me, well
Just without all of the singing and niggas in drag
Once I get in my bag, what she gettin' is bad
She don't see how anybody could be so
Heartless to her, an icebox and he's cold
Take notes, I'mma put you on game
Don't trust shit not even ya' own name
Lay low, I don't condone fame
Mind yours and trust me they gon' do the same
Did you catch all of that? You could be doin' better
No hearts gettin' broken, no Kleenex gettin' wetter
They won't see 'em falling from ya' eyes
But that make up don't make up a disguise...just keep tellin' her lies

[Hook]
Aye, Aye, Aye
Just keep telling her lies
I could still see 'em falling from her eyes that makeup don't make up a disguise, just keep telling her lies
Aye, Aye, Aye
Just keep telling her lies
I could still see 'em falling from her eyes that makeup don't make up a disguise, just keep telling her lies

Lies

[Outro]
You know it's crazy
That these women, man...
It's like they get attached to the first thing that come along
They don't even know what they want
Do any of us really know what we want?
I guess I'm just living to find out
Yeah
