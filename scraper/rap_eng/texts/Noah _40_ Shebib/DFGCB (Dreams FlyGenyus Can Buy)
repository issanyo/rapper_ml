[Verse: ]
A couple years late, I ain't mad at u
I heard u did this beat before so ain't this old news?
I don't give a fuck I'm out here making statements
Broom & mop ready clean these streets like I'm the maintenance

If my city got me I'mma make sure everybody rich
Pressure from the game, my head up high this will be a swish
They say I'm not New York I just sound like the town across
Haters on the net love to nail u to a cross

Man these rappers must be prunes, everyday they got some shits out
Royal flush on em, handle down i need yall cleaed out
Dance for my Foreign babe in Great Falls
Mock me if u want, I'll be big like Rave-Symone's bra

Ahead of the rest, you'll get pissed on like pregnancy test
This ain't aimed at anybody I just know I'm the best
In your iPod u blast this since my city got no stations
Tito asked for the tape when I was on vacation

I was chillin tryna find some motivation
Everyone was droppin shit, it became my extra aggravation
Pickin up this pen to be swagged out
The game full of strip club songs so this what raps about?...

I ain't got no heroes after Biggie died
U be sayin "fuck bitches" kissin trannys wit those Mister Cee cries
I told Kass we some lighters, can't nobody match
Even when they strike it, they ain't never built to last
