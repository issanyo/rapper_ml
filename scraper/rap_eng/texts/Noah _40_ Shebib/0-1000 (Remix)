[Intro]
Fuck being on some cool shit
I be like, "I never knew the rules," bitch
Bad bitch, I'm tryna give her pool stick
And if the bitch still like it, give her the full clip

[Verse 1]
Oh, Lord
Man, these bitches going overboard
Had to cut this bitch off, yeah, extension cord
Riding 'round in a foreign, something you can't afford
Two bitches in the back kissing on ya boy (Thottianas)
You wife that bitch?
I'm like, "No, boy."
"No, boy. No, boy. No, boy."
Hah?
Man, that bitch is a thot
Man, she fucked the whole block
All she wanna do is cocks
I went zero to a thousand, nigga, real quick
And you can get drilled if a nigga touch the kill switch
My body need mollies, nigga, pill sick
And fuck poppin' one, I pop two and then I'm healing
These hoes going, I'm like: "Kiss then. Lick then. Flip them. Diss them."
I ain't got time for hoes
I'm just cooling with the bros
Five thousand for a show
Shout out to this lil bitch, her head real sick
These hoes ain't loyal, man, I'm lookin' for a real bitch
And free my nigga Mack, he ain't did shit
And when he come, I swear to God, he gon' kill shit
Fuck all that "Dex, go to school!" shit
I be on the block and we do this
30 and them mops and them ruler sticks
They say, "You from Englewood?"
I'm like, "No shit!"
Oh, no
What you think I keep a gun for?
MAC's on the strings like a yoyo
Bullets hit his stomach then his damn throat
Free my nigga Lil Savage, yeah, Pico

[Outro]
Y'all know how I'm rocking, man
Like rocks on my Robin's, I'm shining, man
Shout out to my manager, C-Roc, man
Shout out to my twin, Fat Daddy, man
Shout out to all of MOE, man (Gang)
Real quick
Zero to a thousand, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real quick
And you can get drilled if a nigga touch the kill switch (Gang)
