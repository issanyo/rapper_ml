[Verse 1: Erykah Badu]
Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, time to light an incense now
Ya hear me talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, I speak French now
Crew shit, pants down, and takin' many hits now
Ya hit me up like "Do you wanna hang right now?"
I'm on the Southside off of Martin Luther King right now
Do ya own a watch; do ya know what time it is right now?
It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of me right now

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
All I'm talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You ain't ever come to me, you ain't ever come to me
All I'm askin' you is come see me for once
Come and see me for once
You ain't ever come to me
You ain't ever come to me

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going
Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me telling me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no, yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't, yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Erykah Badu]
Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[Bridge: Erykah Badu]
Come to me
Come to me
Oooh

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Erykah Badu]
All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
