When you get up here
Where I'm fucking at
Shouldn't have to
Show niggas
Where the fuck I'm from
I'm from Holy City
Where they breed real
And everybody and they momma
Got a fucking gun
Crack houses
Up & down
& left & right
Hard living in the slums
Kings flow
(Ain't they tho)
Taking alleys
Up and down
All Day And night
Kicking rocks
Just for crumbs
Nigga Seen those
(Didn't I tho)
Yea
I don seen it all
Yea
I don Seen it all dawg
Got a nigga
Working on third masters
Closing out my third chapter
Bout to school ya all
Sit
Down
Keep forward
And ya
Pockets glued to the chair
See the truth
Gotta meet it
With a stare
See it
There it is there
Yea
Nigga
There it is there
Like whoooo
Bitch I'm the man
I dun mastered my plan
Did this work with my hands
To show who I am
Stay trill with my fans
And all of my fam
Don't trick on no hoes
Please Don't sprinkle ya nose
Man You know how it goes
Now Land on the scene
With you & your team
Now live out your dreams
