(Drop)
(I drop)
(I-I)
(I drop)

(yo)

Dropped out school
Now the flow stupid
Treat this game
Like Columbine
Get executed
MASTRMNDS
A Frankenstein
The best to do it
Bite your style
And make it better than you do it!

(WOAH)

Cooking beats
Like Gordon Ramsay
My chick like a model
Your bitch look like Tammy
You couldn't catch a body
If I threw one at you
See ya'll wanna put up hands
To see who's better

Hold up
Because the flows nuts
Turn the studio
To a tour bus
You know your boy spitting
Like turbulence
Ya'll be the chosen one
And I'll be Morpheus

(Yah)

I'm on the up and up
Got the crowd leaning
Like the shit in your cup
Hand to do another
One's never enough
I had you motherfuckers watching
Since we did One Up!

(And)

If you ain't liking what we doin'
(What we doin')
If you ain't liking what we doin'
(What we doin')
If you ain't liking what we doin'
(What we doin')
If you ain't liking what we doin'
Shut up!

I'm just playing games
See
I sit up in the spot
At the top of your brain
So when you think of dope rappers
You'll remember the name
We M&M
Not Eminem
Won't say it again!

(Sheesh)

I take you out the track like Drake
Use you for radio play
Come album drop
You ain't see your name!

Like God damn!
Like God damn!
(Woah)
Like God damn!
(Woah)
Like
Like
Like

Frank Belvedere
Man
Suburban Mascot
And
Crushing all these beats
For the tape
I do these beats
All in one take!

(Yah)

I went in deep
Like the end-zone
Italian Stallion
Man I swear I'm Sly Stallone
I'm not from this world
And I've tried phoning home
It says delivered
I don't think ya'll got the message
To my family
I left the cash under the mattress
Throw some Boom-Bap on
And see which rapper's really acting
Pellz
Where's the Premier beat?
So we can see what happens
Need to be a beast
And feed on all these rappers!
