[Intro]
Niggas know what I do, when I
When I jump on this shit man
Los... it's the king

[Verse 1]
Yo
Last year I ain't even have a deal (go)
Last month I made half a mil (flat)
Last week I made ya girl grab her heels (work)
Fuck a bitch and pop half a pill (go)
Do you ho I'm doin' mine (go)
Stare so hard she goin' blind
She keep her tongue out, and her legs spread
I bet he zodiac, is a Jordan sign (work)
Hold up, slow Down (slow down)
Niggas actin like they really want me go ballistic
I'mma load up, whole round (whole round)
Turn a nigga into jelly when I hit him in the biscuit
Like roll up (roll up)
Get it? roll up? biscuit? jelly? roll up? Fuck 'em
Roll up, something, potent, OG, Los a, motha, fuckin, OG, hoes be
All on my dick (my dick)
All in my section (my section)
Only love I have for them (got for them)
Is called an erection
Oh yes we leave a bitch nigga where they see fish swim
Chrome on his lip like a deep dish rim
Treat a nigga like a maserati
Hop out in cavalli
Tell her pop another molly
Make her hop in my Denali
Prolly coppin it Nevada
Then we chop it out in Cali
Get it poppin in the Ramada with models from the valley
We in here
So deep (deep)
Yall niggas look like ass for real
Pussy niggas get cleaned up
Like we load them mags with massengill (uh)
Load that mack lay back and chill
Roll that sack and pass the kill like...

[Bridge]
I'm uncomfort' 'round you niggas
Cause I'm fuckin' all of yo bitches
When she see me ballin them sixes
So fly, so fly, so fly
So fly, so fly, so fly

[Hook]
You ain't slung no birds
You ain't neva slung no birds
You ain't neva slung no birds
You ain't hug no curb
You ain't neva hug no curb
You ain't neva hug no curb
You ain't shave no 8th
You ain't neva shave no 8th
You ain't neva shave no 8th
I break shit down
Say I got a bath salt flow
Run nigga save yo face (whatup)

[Verse 2]
You with your crew
And they talkin shit
And you talkin' shit
But you stayin' behind
And I become a king
And that became a problem
You lame and violent
You came in silent
Your dame got brain like 'sane asylums
Craziest shit
So maybe that shit
Is almost as good as that trade for Bynum
You trade, I'm buyin em'
They afraid I'm climbin'
Like 2 rollies at one time
Two hoes with me dumb fine
Ou dont tempt me my girlfriend had 2 door bentleys unsigned
Frontline
Frontline
All my soldiers dumb biased...
And all ya'll hoes just come by us...
Your girl and her girlfriend says you can come buy us...
So your girl still behind the catcher like umpires
Hold up
Roll up
(you a nasty nigga)
Bitch so what?
Getcha dough up
Broke ass niggas make me throw up
Black lamborghini doors go up
Fuck around and come around and run a town and spun around the block twice just to scoop your mothafuckin' ho up
Know what?
No bucks
No cuts
No cheese
Coca
No fella no bread and no lettuce?
No luck
No look, magic
No look, tragic
No look, yola
Yo look
So shook
No hook
This time niggas is so shook
Cuz you need a notebook
I do this with no book....

[Los Talking]
Wow... that shit is crazy
