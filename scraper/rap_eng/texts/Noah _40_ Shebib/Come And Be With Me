[Verse 1]
You said you loved me boy and I thought it was real
All your revenge you can’t imagine all the pain that I feel
I never meant to hurt you
Always went to church with you
I apologized
And every night I cried 'cause I thought you would stay mine
I see you doing better I wish you the best boy
And I wish you never left boy
It’s hard for me to sing this song
I know I had to right my wrong
Bryson Tiller mood Robin Thicke too
I’m lost without you
I can't help myself
This pain in my chest
It's too much stress
I thought you was the best
But you're not
I want you back
I just miss you baby

[Hook]
And all you gotta do is
Come and be with me for once
I ain't see you in months
'Cause I'm that one you need(2x)
All you gotta do is
Come and be with me for once
I ain't see you in months
'Cause who's better for you than me(x2)

[Verse 2]
Yeah you moved on but that bitch took my place
I gave you all of me and you play it in my face
You know I wouldn't lie
I was always down to ride
And I cried all night
Oh why
'Cause I thought you was the one
I can see that I was wrong
And now I see that I'm
I'm lost without you
I can't help myself
This pain in my head
I'm thinkin 'bout what you said
Our relationship is dead
I need you back
I want you bad
Can't you see that
Ohhhhhhhhh

[Verse 3]
Thinking bout the love that you been faking
Thinking bout the time that I have wasted
All the nights you left me alone
Because you rather run the street with your bros
I gave you all of me, now there's nothing left
Loving you was a sin, now I must repent
We say our goodbyes, and I can't  stay mad at you
Tell me why, I'm always running back to you
King to my queen yeah we used to be royal
Now you want these hoes not a girl that is loyal
If that's what you want, then go get em I guess
All these tears I shed, I have no more left
But you're just a dog, steady chasing a bone
Before the ends, I'll still hit your phone like...

[Hook]
Come and be with me for once
I ain't see you in months
'Cause I'm that one you need
But whose better for you than me
All I ever think is
Come and be with me for once
I ain't see you in months
'Cause I'm that one you need
Who's better for you than me
But who's better for you than me
