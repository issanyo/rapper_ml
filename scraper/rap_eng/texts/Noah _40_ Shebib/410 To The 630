[Hook x2]
410 to the 630
Livin' this life i don't know no mo

[Verse 1]
My heart is in Maryland, but my life is in Chicago
Left a lot of things and people that only i know
Cause in Chicago, i feel like a stranger;
Walking around the streets like a tourist that could be danger
Went from being lame to being lamer
Keeping my new squad small we getting this paper, vaping this vapor(yeah)
Chasing shorties down like my dick has a crown with a huge ass frown because this isn't my town
But i was actually born here, 1998 September that was the boom year
Moved 15 months later; left all my family, no friends but you know what (hey) i see you later

[Verse 2]
Now i'm in Maryland, where they're down with the heroin
Like the wire but i never touched no pen to my farrow skin
But inside i lacked a lot of shit; bravery and confidence
Didn't go through experiences i should've been down with
16 years later i and still lack confidence
Now i'm back in Chicago, writing rhymes getting lotto
My friend's family getting shot up(pray for you, pray for you)
Cause inside you got problems, the ones i never woulda thought of
And I love you all, i'm thankful for thee;
The ones in my life that i surrounded myself to be
Cause you guys, make me who i am now
Sitting right here with empty smiles
