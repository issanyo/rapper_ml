[Verse 1]
Comin' off the last record, I'm really still killin' shit off the record
Still without no effort, I should get a record
I'm livin' out here like I found the missin' treasure
Past the present, now I have attention
This is nothin', just a lazy flow, but they'll still pay me though
Cause it's that new Dirty Lu, thats just the way it go
Been said what I say all day since Doris
We fast like turbo, hitta, rap like this for all my Earl hittas
I reached the point where haters come after me, bitch
I reached heights that they can't even try to see, bitch
I'm the new king, they get down and kiss my feet, bitch
I could go 6 hours on this beat, bitch
I'm not famous, but I know I will be
So much so, haters wanna kill me
I get hype on tracks so damn hard but still these bitches will never feel me
Cause I'll still come out and curse you like Lil B
The real me, never outdone
Here's a reason for people that act dumb without one
Then always wonder how come
Roll up a blunt then some purp and get faded
Started in the Ville and we still here bruh we ain't made it
Yeah, Encore, Vaca Leather smellin' like the shit
Too generous, ain't givin' XO not a kiss
Ain't rich yet but you know that I'm finna be rich
Ain't shit allegory, that ain't my category, wassup

[Verse 2]
Sittin front row lookin' like there's nothin' you could sell me
I predict my damn future like Makaveli
I'm the prodigy, I know that they never understand me
I hope that they notice that they homies ain't like they family
I've been talkin to Ewill, we really makin' big shit happen
We never drop the ball on some real shit, we like Michael Jackson
We raw, we the shit, we fasho not the first ones to admit it
I always stay in touch with him just to check him when he's trippin'
We buildin raps like we buildin sculptures
I really know who dissin' man I just give 'em the pulpit
Them left field flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got two words for all of the nonsense
Fuck you, bitch, I'm the shit, guess you will never get the message
Born a motherfuckin' legend dont let me get agressive
Bruh that shit I heard from you lately really sound expressive
Like aye, B, I got your damn cd, not impressive
I piece the bullshit together it all gets excessive
Cloud chains like credentials, you know I leave ya breathless
My life I go too relentless
Boy, I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you cosign these days
Just give it time, I'll be the one Drake cosign each day
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is Dirty Lu spendin' on the intro
Lately I've been feelin' like I'm just stuck in limbo
I just play my cards and win if you don't get the memo
Rollin up a L, I know ya dont understand my lingo
Blow it out the damn window,my kinfolk've known ive been dope
These bars just ain't that simple, it ain't easy to catch my tempo
This song so hot it's like you steppin' in a sauna
We just here blowin' up the clouds of marijuana, no lie
There's so much god damn money on my mind
The difference is that with mine, it all comes thru in no time
I might come thru and bust moves with every single damn rhyme
That's just me on my so-so, snapchat me a photo
Wanted to tell you to check yourself
And you so dumb you can't even write a check yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, know I won't help
You know, back on your needy shit
Do so much dope rappin I hope yall stop the sleepy shit
How much time is Dirty Lu spendin' on the intro
How is this dude workin' like he got a fuckin twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, crazier than Bey and Jay-Z
And I wouldn't change a thing if you made me, now real shit
Wassup
How much time is Dirty Lu spendin on the intro

[Outro]
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us
