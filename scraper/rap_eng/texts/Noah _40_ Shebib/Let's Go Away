[Intro]
Shout out to you
‘Cause this one belongs to you
Yea

[1st Verse: The Homie Teez]
I’ve heard rap is dead
So I figured that maybe I might just make it
Or make it a different story
So radio might just play me
For dissin’ all of these rappers
And fucking up all these trappers
And emphasis on the trappers, ‘cause ya’ll niggas trapped
In a parallel universe
Who deserves, to hear things that hurt, in your heart
I’m exploring all this art
‘Till it starts to disappear into the air like a Miley Cyrus fart
And I rap about the silly, but the silly amuses hots
And he broke yours
So I took you in then you tore mine apart
Even before when you lost yours I thought
Many thoughts that would run through a boy’s mind
But I guess I thought wrong
Should I sing this song ‘till I make you come back
Or will my heart stay on the ground just like that
I don’t know girl
Now that I think about it you’re my whole world
You’re not the hottest chick around but your soul’s gold
(You’re the first woman) You’re the first woman to make my tears unfold
My mother must be crying even though she’s cold now
Wow, this verse’ll make my heart frown
And you’re angry for some reason tell me now
But first sit down
Light up that marijuana so we head to the clouds
How do you feel now?
Weak enough to let all them tears out
This weed enough to let you let your secrets out?
She said “Nah, I’m thinkin’ that I love you ”
And all the secrets seem to let me see through myself
‘Cause where else could I find this gold that you claim to have hidden in my soul
Me and her started speaking like we never had before
Then something clicked in her that made her say ‘woah’
Then she stood up and headed to the door
She said “I gotta go” (“I gotta go”)
She looked to the rack, headed to it, took her coat
I was so angry, I couldn’t finish my Coke
But I chased her through the door; you know how the story goes
You know how the little lovers turn into foes
Would Romeo feel the same if Juliet was a ho
Would Joseph stay with Mary if he knew she was digging for his gold
But I definitely did for this girl
And I think she knows a little too much
She takes advantage of love so what’s up
She told me one time that she blow a man for some money (what?)
And she told me for her virginity here’s a ticket (what?)
So anytime you want it, you call me and you can get it
But little did she know I didn’t want was she was giving
I saw a wife in her and the mother of my children
The one I’d share my life, alright, you gotta admit it
Sex is overrated, and foreplay is overplayed
Touching is okay, so is it wrong if I wanna hold you all day
Help me baby
For some reason your arms always feel safer
So we could fly into the sky and not fear these planes

[Hook]
Make this paper
Let’s make this paper (Let’s make this paper)
Let’s go away (Let’s go away)
Let’s go away (Let’s go away)

[2nd verse: Meez]
Uh, it’s all
Making that glance at your future wife
Thinkin' 'bout not the past but just the future that's bright
Its feelings that I pass and just do, feel for you right
Its kinda me just watchin' what will, do change my life
For nothing else but the better and do bring it excite
We nice, all we need is each other and her big smile
That could turn a beast to a lover and make it be light
Like a kite, or a feather, it’s my heart that, you catched
It’s all better, with you here and, it’s my love I, just checked
If you catched it and isn't all madness, it’s really met
Up with you and you're beautiful too without any specs
If this is puppy love, then consider me the love pet
Then consider me the love pet

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let’s go away (Let’s go away)
Let’s go away (Let’s go away)
Let’s go away (Let’s go away)
Let’s go away (Let’s go away)
