[Hook]
Nobody fucking with the Pros
2016 flow
No pretending no mo'
We the realest in the globe
Pro Era boys pop rubber bands
Know we make the whole city glow
This ain't nothing new though, you know
Nobody fucking with the Pros

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the melody heavenly
But I'm fucking with fire my nigga
I'm feeling like Jimi Hendrix in the '70s
Cause I'm back with the remedy
I been sippin' elixir no tellin' we
Might be here for a minute I call it longevity
Nigga this moment was meant for me
I could feel the vibe in the room
But I know you rappers see your doom
They say my squad is Armageddon
But we really keep the peace too
And you can hear about how you choose
I am never ever gonna shoot
But I got some niggas with me who
Really keep a third-eye view
Picture perfect is what you could call this
I got too many women to [?] in
Make 'em swap meet very often
Then I mix some blues for my blue shit
That means I'm on when I'm off
Then they gon' have to put me in the coffin
Cause I could kill them when I'm coughin'
But my colon [?] I be frostin'
I could call you tired then exhaust it
Yeah, I'm growing knots like a Bantu
My phone blinging cause my line's hot
You know Aaron Rose got the dance moves
Cor' Boy with the dance moves
Your flow is dry like a sand pool
Show me something different that your brand do
Except getting private from a head dude
Yeah, peep the vision see it clear now
I'm a shining diamond, blocked your mind with rhymin'
That is something you really should fear now
Everybody not meant for the glow
I'm the chief with the keef when I smoke
300 bitches want the D for the low

[Hook]
She prolly fucking with the Pros
2016 flow
No pretending no mo'
We the realest in the globe
Pro Era boys pop rubber bands
Know we make the whole city glow
This ain't nothing new though
Nobody fucking with the Pros

[Beat switch]
All you guys in the new Brooklyn wanna be me
Man, fuck that, yo
*ahem*

[Verse 2]
I can make a nigga lose fans when I draw
Fuck a lord, this whore cost four with a god
Feeling Mike Jack on a track when I black
And another mac better back back never lack
Cause I got a thing for the success
Life is a beach and I touch wet
Pussy like water I caress
Beside that I been through much sex
That's too many women but not enough
They love me for all my designer stuff
Said I keep the vow flowing by my nuts
Tell her get on my boat or be down to fuck
Or give me brain bet she bright too
I stay with the wind like a typhoon
Look at me roaming into a tight [?]
Cause I shine all green, that's my hue
I got 'em like that that's my tomb
But it's natural cause it be my view
I keep it realer than you ever seen
I got niggas who stay with the triple beam
Or peep the vision throug a triple seam
Know what's in my genes cause I make a scene
Like the flow-er within him from the cerebellum
All on my medulla million dollar velum
I don't know but I should tell 'em
My niggas be dishing that work
This that power point for scalin'
Cause I excel with the word
I be contemplating showing niggas that they never could fuck with my team from the start
Everything don't have a happy ending so I keep a target dart and bitches and marks

[Outro]
Yeah, all summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Yeah, nobody fucking with the Pros
Yeah, yeah
2016 flow
Make the whole city glow
