I double click chrome....just so I can see your face girllll
Background on my phone...yup... you must be my world girllll
No google map could find where you're at....trust I done tried it...
But when I finally find it... and finally get behind it... bet you wet
As melted ice is... look where my mind at...forgive me.. I'm not like
That...momentary relapse of the flesh I'm double minded...Need that cure
Can't find it...then you whisper...you've got time it's....
Cool for you to drool over me I mean a lot do...
But if youuuu wanted toooo showw and proovvee that you're worthy
You would have to show me that you're never ever thirsty...
I said fair enough...on to wikipedia...
I'mma look you up..then you look you down...
Wait... I'm doing it again...lust is such a deadly sin...
How can I ever win...
Need a second burst of wind...
As if I ever had a first..
But it all gets worse...
Realized I was dreaming...
In the daytime and it seems that
I've been doing this for a minute
I can't go back...
Like I went black...
Reverse mike jack...
Reverse mike jack...
Like I went black...
Then it all made sense...
Like revenue from perfume kits...
It all makes sense....
I've gotta go black..
I've Gotta go back......
