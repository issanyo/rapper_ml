I go back to back scoring touchdown like Jim Brown
Ending up in the end zone quicker then the fucking sound
I'm don't playing around if I'm staying around
Ive been slippin on this henny that ways about a pound
Like woah
I couldn't stop laughing since six days ago
Wanna Know made us didn't want to know
Ever since he put out that second diss
That diss of yours wasn't being sold
ReCharged was like getting a A in biology
But Whataburger said you diss wasn't high quality
They say action speak then words
But action leads you behind bars you heard
Philly niggas think that they body a nigga
Thinking that they can pull trigger quicker than hitting a hitta
Next thing you know your in a cell being a los'a
Now you having second thoughts wish you don't have it in ya
It's crazy how your sisters diss was better than yours
But her knowledge wasn't on point a course
You should of quite before you even started
Now we think your diss sounds retarded
Cleveland is my city where yall at
Shout out to Toronto I got your back
People are turning against you right about now
Now you WWE suing you and that a foul
Now your twitter fingers is turning into insta' fingers
Seeing you post money pics like a bragging nigga
My music is legit you should listen nigga
Speedin' to future watch me make these three figura'
Know your facts before you say it
Know who you playing with
Going crazy but
Never lazy
I go ham each day and that shit is amazing

Got in henny in me
Going Back to back
Yea, Back to back
Got in henny in me
Going Back to back
