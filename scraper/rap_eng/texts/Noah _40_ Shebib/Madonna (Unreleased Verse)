Spending shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone, so they'll never know
But I might tell you one day, you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel and don't worry 'bout doing your hair
Or what you should wear, this not a video shoot, I don't care
Don't over prepare
Gotta remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way, but just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you, j-just be ready to go
