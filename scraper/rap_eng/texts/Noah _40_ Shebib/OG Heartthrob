[Verse 1]
Oh right, I'm thinking it's getting late
I'm running on an hour sleep
I'm 'bout to hit Marina Bay
Someone call the valet
I've got a classic case of OG heartache
And I don't like to wait
Don't make me wait on you, you
Let's get this started
See you changed my life and I won't ever forget it
I'm telling you, you
They all had me wrong except for you, you
I won't let you go

[Chorus]
Original heartthrob
Giving me heart problems
I can't take making love to anyone but you
Original heartthrob
You make my body rock
I can't take waking up to anyone but you
Don't make me wait on you, you
Don't make me wait on you, you

[Verse 2]
At night your aura turns to blue
Your kisses paint me rouge
You got me wide awake riding on your body wave
Lemme know the time and place
Baby I just want a taste
And I don't like to wait
Come with me, we can party in the city
When nobody else is up
'Cause whenever you're with me, there's nobody catching up
No they won't, I won't let you go, I won't let you go
No I won't, they've all got me wrong, they've all got me wrong

[Chorus]
Original heartthrob
Giving me heart problems
I can't take making love to anyone but you
Original heartthrob
You make my body rock
I can't take waking up to anyone but you
Don't make me wait on you
Don't make me wait on you

[Verse 3]
I'm leaving from the commodore
Headed to your front door
Open up and let me in
Have my heart, it's yours
I'm feeling like I'm 25
Girl you got me on a ride
I'm glad that you're on my side

[Chorus]
Original heartthrob
Giving me heart problems
I can't take making love to anyone but you
Original heartthrob
You make my body rock
I can't take waking up to anyone but you

[Outro]
I'm in love, I'm in love
'Cause I'm in love, I'm in love
