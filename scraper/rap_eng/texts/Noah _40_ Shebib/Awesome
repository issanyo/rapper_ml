[Michelle, Doreen]

[Eddie]
And if you find me I can make you awesome

[Brian]
Bring your friends to the room maybe we can solve ‘em

[Verse 1: Courtney]
Hold up, Campbell calm down
I'mma talk now, boy put your palms down
You can count on me for a semi and a prom
If they taking you to court then you need me over mom, huh
C. Wong, get like me
Bet you never met a girl fresh like me
You know who was right so you left like me
I’m a real fan loyal to my Jays and Leafs

[Verse 2: Bryan]
But I’m taller, I’m taller taller, but you can call her
Getting dollars, and counting money, like I’m a baller
Call me funny, but I’m a scholar, they see me dress up looking proper
I check my pockets, I make no profit
They say I’m fake, tell me they don’t like my magic tricks
But your girl and I make magic, eh
Bryan and Courtney, the brain and the sporty
And I'mma sign out still taller than this shorty, beast

[Verse 3: Ashini]
Spirit Day, had me and Eddie here all day
Tryna figure out what games could get you here to play
I heard you pitch perfect, so I don’t need a hearing aid
It’s been a good year I’m not here to stay so remember
I’m Ashini, hope that you don’t splash me
We all swim in the same pool, so don’t ask me
Why I keep calm, I just keep it classy
“10 syllables” to “I just killed it nasty”

[Verse 4: Linda]
Me and Brian, we’re both winners
You can trust we gonna have surprises, we’re both Kinder
Future prezi, but don’t test me, you know we still Brinda
We be selling what you plan on buying we ain’t lying like the Mayans
And I hope that you’ll be ready for a big year
Me and Karen finna shift the Lambo Mercy into next gear
Cuz we started repping Macklin now we here
And tomorrow “Good morning, Campbell”, I will guarantee you’ll hear
(But first we)
Planned a semi I'm sweating (woo)
Planned a semi I'm sweating (woo)
Shoutouts to the SAC
That's Mr. Shum and Mr. (Woo)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Iman]
Campbell, I guess this the finale
I plan prom, I don’t plan a promissory
Note, that I take notes when it’s necessary
I’m not putting you on hold, so my team is who I carry
Got the school on my mind, cool I define
The irony, I’m really both at the same time
They say I’m loud so you know I exist
Yeah, I know they want this…..
Yeah, I’m Iman the boss
AKA buying-don’t-care-bout-the-cost
SAC stands for the samples at Cost…co
So I know that they lost
Take me back to my roots, call me Cleopatra
I’m the last great one so we eating pasta
Your VP, call me Ms. Elzinie
And during tough times I made it look easy, beast

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Raydon]
RAY$AP, now rock on this thing
They be out of sight like apocalypse came
We moving full speed, there’s no stopping a train
They calling timeout, there’s no stopping the game
Vera Wang, like a real fashion killa
In a Caravan, Bryan driving me up to the dealer
Cuz we pick up the Lambo Murcielago
Pass it to Linda, where’s the keys, how should I know
Big thanks as I end my tenure
You had my back even back as a ten-er
Binary grade to a dozen plus one
Had a whole set of councils cut it down to just one
Open minded prezi I can see it all ways
Ask me in the future I believe that I’ll say
Albert Campbell, four good years so
Live it up, I know you will, beast
