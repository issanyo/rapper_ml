It's not what we did
It's not what we done
It's just what we had baby
You were number one
Say you moving on
Well I guess that's just emotions

[Hook]
I guess that's just emotions
I guess that's your emotions
I guess that's just emotions
I guess that's your emotions

I ain't got a frig to give
I've been traveling around the globe
In my baggy clothes and sneakers like it's 1994
I've been writing music ever since I was just six years old
I've been grinding all my life, before they wanted to know
It's like everybody praises cause they see I'm doing good
But before I had a name nobody showed me no love
When they need a helping hand, they want me to be the one
But I just wish them good luck

I guess that's just emotions
When they need you they call
Never there when you fall
That's emotions
I guess that's just emotions
I guess that's your emotions

Thinking behind it's like my mind's on my back
Cause you said no strings attached but I was a puppet to that
And what is really going on don't bring the public to that
Cause you regret what you said and then you took it all back
So all the lies and deceit, that just reminds me of grief
Reminds me of the aggression that I've been hiding beneath
And all my feelings suppressed, just like the rhymes on this beat
Don't feel the need to express, just gonna try and do me
The motion is emotion that's mixed together with potion, and threw out over the ocean
You never would of noticed
And right now don't think I'm coping
I'm sick of all provoking a situation that no one even knows and now I'm soaking
Into a bathtub of lotion
The water's here, it's floating above my body and stroking all the hurt away
Hoping that I never have to go through this pain again, cause I'm swollen
Been beating up like emotionally eating up all my bones
And now I feel my heart's broken
Trust is like a token, so if I give it you and you use it, there's really no going back
And I'm holding back
Cause I ain't publicly tryn'a make it known in fact
I just want someone that cares for me, don't hold me back
So I may do something crazy, better hold me back
Mental institute is where my brain's placed in
Heart's been aching
Ribcage caved in
