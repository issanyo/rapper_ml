Michael lost his friend today
I'm at a loss of words
We grieve about it every time
How'd they leave the Earth
And sometimes I wonder if this life is really worth it
What am I doing on this Earth, man
What is my purpose
I go to sleep afraid
Wake up feeling worthless
Deep anxiety hidden by a calm surface
But I'm still dedicated to my work and service
Been a few weeks working on a beat for Curtis
Rap's handyman
If it's broke than I can fix it
So it's down to business
When I finish Dan can mix it
But every time we finish
I feel like its in vain
I wonder if there's anybody who can feel my pain
Feel the pain
Feel the struggle
Facing 4th and 26
Breakin' out the huddle
But it looks like I found Freddie Mitchell
Cause I find a way to pull it out
Before the whistle blows
And I'm rippin flows
Like Ray Lewis stripping balls
Out a halfbacks arm
It's like I'm tripping balls
Cause my flow is acidic
Never been basic
And victory is so close
That I can almost taste it
So draw me up a nice contract
That I can sign
But oh shit
I'm still sittin on the sideline
But if you ask me how I am I'll say I'm doing fine
Stayin' patient on the wait list
Waiting for my time
From the basement to the attic I'm about to climb
Rap addict moving forward
Never on rewind
Shine so bright
That I might leave 'em blind
Divine inspiration
Leavin' chills down your spine
And if the song is done and
Nothing else can come to mind
Then just remember two words: Merrick Stein
