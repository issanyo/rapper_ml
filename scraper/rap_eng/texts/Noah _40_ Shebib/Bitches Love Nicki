Bitches Love Nicki

[Verse 1]
Yea these bitches love Nicki they be actin sadity
It's a fact that they stingy you should be glad you that you pretty
Cus if you wasn't then wouldn't get the time of the day
And I see you if I see you won't go out of my way
Yeah now everything I post you know she like that
But if I hit her with a DM she won't write back
She just call me whenever she want a night cap
You could take her out the trap but she go right back (damn)

That's the only way she talking now she spillin out
Girl you know you gotta swallow bet not spit it out

Yea she don't want a rock well I'll just take the top
Lil mama suckin' and fuckin' yea she geaked up and freakin'
She stay smokin' and drankin' cus she don't like what she thankin'
She just puff puff puff until she chokin'
Cus when she was younger he left her broken

The situation here it is unfortunate
And she said she ain't gone keep it she abortin' it (damn)
