Who are you to me, baby?
Who are you to me, oh
I don't even know
I don't even know, oh
I don't even

Sit back, smoke up. And conjure up my thoughts
Iron body boss, turned to something feeling lost
What's the cost? I could pay it. I need my soul though
A couple old folks, fighting in a dojo
Metaphorically. A cave around the coast yo
Holy script of Jerusalem, the dead sea scrolls
Lost pages that nobody knows
It goes cold, to bone crushing trying to know
You expose the foes hidden under ancient hieroglyphics
But your mind is tinted from the world that we be living in
All our peers stay vindictive. In sickness
Riddled with indecision. Their fear is themselves. Shit!
Can't complain. The game has gotta change
The fame is overrated, don't attain the love of hatred
When in Rome, know it wasn't made in one day, so you appreciate the time it take to make this
(it takes time baby)
Who are you to me, baby?
Who are you to me
I don't even know
I don't even know. No
I don't even

Are we the same? You're playing all these games
The world's about to change, and it's hard to explain
I get lost in thinking that this life is instinctive
Just Fades and glistens as the timing is endless
All the hell's sent. Burning their bridges like they would a crucifix
But the Lord is in my vision. Fuck submission
The world is moving quick and a fistful of recognition
Or ambition wouldn't get shit. Without the mind to do it. Going columbine
Without the mind to do it. The violence in abundance
They provide what makes us die while Hatred multiplies, in garbage minds
You'll find it. If you stick your head up and look boy you'll find it
Ain't no telling what to do, do we fight this? Moving in a System of bliss
Eternal solitude while they be chasing the cyst

(they'll be gone though) they'll be gone

Who are you to me, baby? X2
I don't even know, I don't even

You take me, you take me away oh, oh. X2
