[Verse 1: Ghost]

Hungry for my love, and I just loved your appetite
Just cause it's like a movie, don't mean it's and act alright
"Quit playing boy, I know you're too thirsty"
Sorry, I ain't tryna be that dude alone at thirty
But I also won't settle on the second hand
I swear you're all that I needed like Method Man
You just wait and see, cause when my album's out
Income incoming show you what that outcome bout'
It was all a dream, it was all for you
But you didn't stick around, you went and found someone new
Music was my purpose, said I should be down to earth-ish
I wasn't worthless, you just didn't care to see me flourish
I got to say, you should have waited to see
And if you didn't have the time, had faith to believe
But remember, I already gave you more than a chance
So don't call me in the morning, just be warned in advance

[Hook: Ghost]
I don't need you, I won't see you
I just think it's better off
We stay this way
I don't need you, I won't see you
I just think it's better we go
Separate ways

[Verse 2: Ghost]

Oh I know it's wrong, but it feels so right
In my darkest hour she was there to shed some light
What you be thinking on, this grey goose we're drinking on
This couch we're sinking in, I wonder if we'll speak again
I'll probably stay the night, cause I'd never make it home
Is that the truth, maybe I don't want to sleep alone
Maybe I'm just stuck on the girl in my first verse
Memories are a blessing but they also are the worst curse

Repeat Chorus
