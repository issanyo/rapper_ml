(verse1)
I could tell you from experience
These bitches ain't loyal
Shit ain't been the same since
They treat me like I'm Royal
Doing every female dirty
Cause I haven't found the real one
She just wanna hang cause she never real fun
Like pimp c said this ain't 91
Stopped working for a boss when I became one

(pre hook)
You would think they feline these niggas acting pussy
You would think I'm the edge they way they push me
I gotta keep real, cause fakeness ain't me
You always keep it real, that what you promised me

(hook)
If I told you that I trust you
Would you go and break my trust
If I told you that I love you
Would you go and fuck it up
I know you someone's daughter
So Ima love you harder, girl
Faithful faithful faithful faithful

(verse 2)
You always accusing me but girl I wouldn't cheat
I been in the Stu working hard so im never in the street
Especially cause you look like a model
Ima finish up this song and go cop a bottle
Take off your clothes off the henny I got no patience
She a skinny girl but her ass jiggle when she naked
She didn't let me hit quick but I'm glad I waited
Fuck them other girls cause you my bitch and I'm glad to say it
I was the most hated for a long time
By the females who couldn't be mine
Yeah
But they know you my boo
I would never have you looking like a fool
Cause that's impossible
She smart she go to school

(Pre-hook)
