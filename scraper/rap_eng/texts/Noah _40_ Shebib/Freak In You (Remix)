[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci
Freak in you (freak in you)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Is there a freak in you? (Freak in you)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Come and talk to me, oh
Quick, rush, rush, rush
Baby, just like Kimora Lee, oh
So pretty, girl, you belong in a gallery
What's your fantasy? (Your fantasy?)
Say something you ain't never did (ain't never did)
Like fuck and suck a real nigga

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm a fisher
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup
These lines right here gon' really, really make you fuck
These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
(There's always more)
There's always more, that’s for sure
There's always more, that’s for sure

[Interlude: Drake]
Yeah
I can't have the tissue before you sneeze, y'know
I can't bow down at your feet, y'know
Uh huh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon, I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote Take Care, but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than...
Yeah, yeah
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
Yeah
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite
Yeah, I jump out of relationships before I get left in it
Yeah, the sex we have reminds me of the money and success a bit
Yeah, 'cause even when I got it I just gotta keep getting it
Even when I got it I just gotta keep getting it
Big hotel suite, I'm the only one in it
Always going back to some shit that I already been in
Plenty fish up in the sea but I never go fishing
We got everybody sick, sending "get well soons" and a lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all clone
I'm just more ready than...
Yeah
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
