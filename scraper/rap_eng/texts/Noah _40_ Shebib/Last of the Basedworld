(Verse)
This rap game is getting shady
I be working like sits up
My back hurt and I can't sit up
My position to eat when I sit up
My young boy put me on the old come up
Black flame
Lil b I'm here and I'm one of a kind
Like I said... historical
He called me beezy b and I call em young d
Feel me, he told me I rapped and how I was only 14
Man I started writing, at the age of 13...
And I feel something in this cold gangsta vision
I spit mean, I spit fire from the top gate
One shot, hit shot no peace too late
That's when you do great
I'm living in the world with the money
But they want that, now how I'm supposed to drive
With the fog in my headlights I'm getting back home
I'm just tryin to sleep tonight
I'm just tryin to sleep tonight
And you ain't gotta be the father
To see people getting scared so precautious
...They so precautious
And you know I've been through it
Your vision just blurred
Like resident evil
I'm in the... bar with the zombie strap
With the four five got the green herbs
Mix it with the red there they go
I heard they looking for me
They all dead to me, rawest rapper in the game
Steps way ahead of me
I beat myself twice today
I'm on the tip top my nose dripping pain
And my head is sideways bitch I'm so paid
This is the last of the art
And I'm the last of the arch
Basedworld, gold house I sleep upside down
Bentley coupe, drop top look whose inside now
28 acres they frowns upside down
I walk in the store solo key but I'm basedgod
There be only one of Lil' B
I suggest to take this message
As a alter in the presence
And after you go ahead and take one piece
Go to sleep
