[Verse 1: Tey Boogie]
Momma said I'm a handful
I'm just doing what they can't do
I whip good with my left hand
Cam Newton with the dance move
Clark Kent turn to superman
Ya'll really got a issue
Tey Boogie been a issue
Mess with me and get your issue
Okay I been quiet for too long
We got some stuff to get into to
We got some pointers to cover
Cause ya'll really acting forgetful
I been really trying to hold it in
Just know that it's all confidential
I promise not to say one name to me
That is not beneficial
I had the plan in my head,I put that plot  to work
Built it from the ground up
Yeah I finesse my work
Double entendre, really feeling like Jay
Ain't no disrespect to HOV
Selling records by  the tape
Started from the bottom up
Yeah I do it by myself
Never stick my hand out,  I ain't never ask for help
Dear summer, dear summer
Yeah you know it's dear summer
Got the blueprint ready, it'll be here  by the summer
EP in the summer, double tape  by the winter
Lord knows I'm a sinner
If I want it, got to have it
I just got to be a winner
Can't lose, won't lose
Never will, never did it
Yeah they sleeping on the kid
I know man I don't get it
Guess I  got to wake them up
Yeah that's how I got to do it
Yeah that's how I'm coming with it
Last year, I told my ride or die I'm done  slipping dog
Finally, it's bout time a nigga kept his word
Tey Boogie

[Bridge: Tey Boogie]
Uh, Yeah look it's bout time (2x)
Tey Boogie

[Beat switch]
When I'm done with this freestyle dog
I want a plaque or something

[Verse 2: Tey Boogie]
Old ways kicking back in me
New ways ain't working for me
August baby I'm lion hearted
Lil Tey but I'm the big homie
When I come around I see your  mood change
Mixed emotions like a mood ring
I ain't never do a damn thing to you
So why you want to sit there and  hate on me?
To be honest though, I can care less
Too many obstacles on my checklist
Best believe the kid checking (3x)
I ain't got time for no nonsense
Too many people dying over nonsense
I don't know about you but I'ma boss up
So you know the boy flow getting costly (uh)
Let me take a breath, spitting this hot  shit off my chest
It can mess around and get dangerous
Ain't no changing us, that loyalty?
We bring with us
I know ya'll really  ain't use to that
I know you damn sho' ain't use to me
I know you better ready get use to me (uh)
I ain't the one you want to play with
Mess around get balled up
Yeah, they talk and never say nun'
I just try to keep my mouth shut
I just try to keep my hustle going
I don't let nobody stop nun'
Yeah I lost a couple battles dog
But I ain't never gon' lose the war
I'm telling you dog, I ain't regular
My flow is sum' impeccable
They thought I was gone and
Won't coming back
It's starting to feel like I never left
I really feel like Jigga now
Ya'll bout to really get it now
I just spoke that shit to life
It won't no need to write it down...
