[Verse 1: Scuare]
Truth is just a pattern in the mind
Try to put it all together
Pass it off from time to time
If only god defines divine
I know alot of people lyin'
Even if he had existed
I'd insist that I defy him
Still, sometimes I wish
That I could find him
With belief in some control
Maybe a chance that I could triumph
I'm not afraid of dyin'
I'm more afraid of livin'
Never finding out who I am
So many stay afraid of science
Cause it forces us to face
The shit we spend out lives denyin'
We're fed a steady diet
Of what's decided upon to be
What's right and what's wrong
We need a divide along these lines
To get us by it
So maybe we won't riot
And maybe they'll be like it
Or maybe so when we try to sleep
We'll get some peace and quiet
No matter why it is
There's a change and likening
Tryin' to find the best value
But I still ain't buyin' it
It's not about control
Or that I felt that he was cold
If you look from my perspective
You could never keep a hold, hold-

[Chorus]
I just wanna demonstrate
That I've got nothin' left
Everything has been the same
I've lost my self-respect
I get older though
I get older though
I get older though
I get older though
Older though
I get older though
I get older though
I get older though
It's funny how
When everything takes soo long
Is it worth it now?
When I feel so alone

[Verse 2]
Alone since the moment, you were born
Torn from the cloth
Of which the universe is formed
Unsure of a thought
Could be a glissess (?)
Running pour (?)
Collecting data for
Connect to a map of something more
There's nothing for us
Love is porous
Hope is Satan's only chorus
A creation of the mind
At most it doesn't even know us
Once you let go of this
Odd little God riddle
All it'll do is
Give birth to what's possible
You think it brings solace
Knowing it's all just a blink of an eye
Just a long for the ride
But it doesn't do much
For this feeling I hide
From the people who love me
And keep by my side
I hope that everything is different
When I'm older
That this math is working torwards
A better passage way to order
Laughing at the way
I'm turned 'round
Boarded out
Pouring out
Million dollars
For announcing some perspectives
Foreign now, now-
No matter the way that I feel
It doesn't effect how it is
And if I said I'd give
Just a moment of doubt
Only acts as I live
And it won't change the truth
And the facts that persist-
See the history of Gods
Lies in mystery and thought
Less in willful misdirection
More in lessons to be taught
But when you stop using your mind
You find guidance by the blind
To be divine
One's assigned
The other nine are left behind
Look-
I understand and see the fear
Cause it's clear
From the start that
Life is not how it appears
Losing tears to find stability
Through something
More than self
You strive for happiness and health
But end up grasping for this hell
Why?
Because most afraid to die
And if life is all that is
Then that fear will multiply
Into a force
Set on focus
More attention on the how
An incentive to bring sense into
To the days you're spending down
No easy way to venture down
Should be prevented with a bow
To the all-mighty devil
In the crowd
