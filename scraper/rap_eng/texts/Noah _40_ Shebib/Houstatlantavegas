(Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her)

[Verse 1]
Hey there, pretty girl
You know, exactly what you got
And I don't, blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the money so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna
Leave (x7)
She just stuck in

[Hook]
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch it go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

[Verse 2]
She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
And she knows, there's more to life
And she's scared, of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

[Hook]
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch it go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

[Instrumental]

[Drake: Hook x6]
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
