[Missy Elliot x Aaliyah Beats for the Streets Sample Intro]

Aaliyahhhhh wake uppppp...

July 2nd...first step to closure....
Just breathe dropped... weight off my shoulders...
Lounging in that hotel room in florida...
My Family was chilling but I was getting over ya....
Heard about the party and it hurt me you were going...
Especially when I heard the alcohol would be potent....
That's just how it seemed to me....
But..when you're dying...yo every blow is finishing....
Somebody is feeling me... *laughs*
Lesson learned that's a reason for everything...
Without pain there's no need for angel wings....
Without rain there's no need for sunny days.....
Or should I say that you wouldn't truly appreciate it....
Family time on holidays.... trust me I'm the same way...
But yo we got time to change... 2012 Obama pain....
Couldn't fit the CAMP in there....but you got the message...
Track 2 it was written here.....

Angels Death Can buy....
I Told You I saw Aaliyah it wasn't a lie...
Might as well have my finger on the trigger..
Cuz right now ain't no point in living.....

So I'm a liar because I saw Aaliyah?
Oh nobody said that? I guess I got that fear...
Paranoia....in my brain....it's running trains...
And running things....running a biz..............
I Heard they call it insane...
Yeah I'm losing hope...
Demons in my mind dancing like a dosi do...
And I ain't joking bro...... so slow your roll
If you thinking I'm sweet as bakeries...
When really me opening up is filling vacancies...
In the game... in this music....
For the love of the art who still do it?
Who putting passion in they raps?
When you rap your raps are a raft....
That'll save you when you trapped...
On an island...you the lone survivor..
I'm wildin.... in my mind I'm violent...
Outside I'm quiet....
That disturbs me...
Cuz not too many people know the real me...
And for a minute...yo I ain't know the real me....
I felt filthy....and kinda still do...
But they say you'll make it if you've got the will to...
Well mentally just call me young jaden...
Karate kidding these demons I'm getting all in they face and...
Screaming I'm human not much I can do......but I know somebody who's got all the power over you....
