[Verse 1]
I wanna love you sideways
Back of the car and 100 miles on the highway
That's only if we make it out of the driveway
All that you give me, all that you make me
Nobody knows me better
All the highs and the lows when I'm under pressure
Nobody else can put me back together
Only you build me, only you break me

[Pre-Chorus]
If you keep your hands on me
I'm hoping that the world won't feel so lost and broken
And I will love you, I will keep you safe in my arms
And if you love me, you will keep a space in your heart for me

[Chorus]
No one does what you do to me
Baby, no one does what you do to me

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel like lightning
I wanna feel you rollin' like water on my skin
I'm letting go this time and I don't wanna fight it
I don't wanna fight it
I don't wanna hide it

[Pre-Chorus]
If you keep your hands on me
I'm hoping that the world won't feel so lost and broken
And I will love you, I will keep you safe in my arms
And if you love me, you will keep a space in your heart for me

[Chorus]
No one does what you do to me
Baby, no one does what you do to me

[Bridge]
Many hearts that I've known, but their love doesn't carry
Not like yours, yours alone, makes me feel like I'm magic
Don't you take it away, this is more than a habit
All this love is all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
If you keep your hands on me
I'm hoping that the world won't feel so lost and broken
And I will love you, I will keep you safe in my arms
And if you love me, you will keep a space in your heart for me

[Chorus]
No one does what you do to me
Baby, no one does what you do to me
I said, no one does what you do to me
Baby, no one does what you do to me
