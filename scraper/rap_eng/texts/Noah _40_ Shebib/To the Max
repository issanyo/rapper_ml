[Verse 1: Drake]
I talk gray, I don't keep it white and black
Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back
Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no
Like the album just went platinum, yeah
Turnt up to the max
If they pop somebody's chain, then we gotta get it back
No discussion to be had, we ain't goin' out like that
Man, we lit

[Chorus: 1WayFrank]
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit

[Bridge: Jodie Aysha & Jay O]
Oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I do
(Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up)
Oh, oh, fessi-ession 'fessions too
(Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up)
Oh, oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I too
(Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up)
Oh, oh, fessi-ession, do come true
(Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up)

[Refrain: Jay O]
Get 'em right, get 'em right
Get 'em right, get 'em right
Get 'em right, get 'em right
Yeah
Get 'em right

[Verse 2: Drake & Jay O]
Got it on the dresser, I've been under pressure
They wanna see me laid out on a stretcher
Gotta keep my head up
(Get 'em right, get 'em right
What you finna do, Gus?)
Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins
I keep hearin' all this "You my brother" talk, I can't relate to nothin'
My broski down to ride
Made a knot in the line
You can never break ties
We don't really rate those yutes there
That's a whole other side
That's a whole 'nother vibe
They ain't really on shit, yeah

[Chorus: 1WayFrank]
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit

[Bridge: Jodie Aysha & Jay O]
Oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I do
(Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up)
Oh, oh, fessi-ession 'fessions too
(Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up)
Oh, oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I too
(Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up)
Oh, oh, fessi-ession, do come true
(Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up)

[Chorus: 1WayFrank]
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit
My young ni— lit
All of my young ni— lit, we lit

[Bridge: Jodie Aysha]
Oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I do
Oh, oh, fessi-ession 'fessions too
Oh, oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I too
Oh, oh, fessi-ession, do come true

[Outro: DJ Khaled & Jay O]
(Get 'em right, get 'em right)
More chune pon your head top
(Get 'em right, get 'em right
Get 'em right, get 'em right
Get 'em right, get 'em right)
Watch how you speak on my name, you know?
(Get 'em right, get 'em right
Get 'em right, get 'em right
Get 'em right, get 'em right)
