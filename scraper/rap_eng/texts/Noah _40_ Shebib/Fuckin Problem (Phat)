[Chorus]
I Love Phat Bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah i love to fuck em that's my fuckin' problem. x2
I Love Phat Bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And every time i fuck em gotta fuckin' stop em
From trying to eat my face like some fuckin' lobster
She said pick me up when i'm down I said I'd drop her

[Verse 1: M_Bizzerg]
Intro to ending, all in though like betting
Endo- compremdo? As I get the necking
Of 40, that's O Z. Thursday I'm thirsty
While poppin a couple of vikings no Percy
Leaning and driving, leading- no tie games
Being the flyest, my milage a pilot
Admires and tries his best to be like it
But can't none compare to that boy sitting high! It's!
Burn after rolling with some papers that been stolen
Double felony yes the Burglar has spoken
Merger! I'm jokin, Mb on that solo
Mixtape poppin, bitch it's just a promo
Romo's your squad cuz you just can't finish
Just like your nuts while your girl said she's finished
Then on to the next and please be my guest
Is what she said to me as I pleased her request. BEAST!

[Chorus]
I Love Phat Bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah i love to fuck em that's my fuckin' problem. x2
I Love Phat Bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And every time i fuck em gotta fuckin' stop em
From trying to eat my face like some fuckin' lobster
She said pick me up when i'm down I said I'd drop her

[Verse 2:
Yeah bro we living lavish, on tracks I beast something like a savage
If you ain't a vet in the league like Barry, hit a El then(ton) feel Brand like the Mavericks
76ers, do you get the picture? These lines that I drew, they Buyn' em real quick huh!
Ain't no half steppa, MBO. Got em got em playing ketchup, I ball like Mayo
OJ OJ how i get away with murder, Im like OK OK like Lamborghini Mercy
What's the wordplay? Berg's j's like Larry Bird or Jordan's
But I don't play, don't play like Derrick fuckin Coleman oww
Yes I'm, Michael Burg, A K A liable to end your caruur
AK! A mindful of words that I urge
You to be mindful of once you have heard. ME!

[Chorus]
I Love Phat Bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah i love to fuck em that's my fuckin' problem. x2
I Love Phat Bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And every time i fuck em gotta fuckin' stop em
From trying to eat my face like some fuckin' lobster
She said pick me up when i'm down I said I'd drop her
