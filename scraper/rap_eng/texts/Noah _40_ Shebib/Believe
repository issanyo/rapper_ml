Nothin' changes if nothin' changes
We're all dying, everything else is just arrangements
Cherish the struggle
Cuz the light shines better in a tunnel
Never let trouble interfere with what you're given here
Another day to prove you wasn't made to disappear
Engineer your own heaven, step inside and build another
So when one falls, there's still the other
Discover what you need, what you don't and know the difference
A soul well explored goes the distance
Riches aren't as valuable as time try to spend both wisely
But do whatever sets your mind free
Why be more concerned with how your image seems
Than your inner dreams
Worth breaks the surface, chase your purpose where it leads
And stay within your means
But think outside the frame, you'll be amazed what you achieve
When you believe
Everything starts when you believe
These are the keys to the the treasure
Let's see this through together
Believe in a new forever
Cause we can do better

I believe


Said I'm workin' hard, I'm workin' so hard
Puttin' in hours
Down to the minute

I believe they want us smart enough to follow orders
But dumb enough to let them control what informs us
They hate being questioned
They fear losing power so they tame your progression
That's why your brain is a blessing
Don't fill it with conformity, remain the exception
Treat fate as oppression
Create the life you're supposed to lead, remake what is destined
Never wait for a lesson
Seek it then teach it and debate your perception
Cuz it's best when our opinion's can range in degrees
Harmony's unhealthy, Being plain is a disease
Why not say what we please
Would you rather stand and fall or live safe on your knees
Bravery succeeds
Take a fuckin' chance you'll be amazed what you achieve
When you believe
Everything starts when you believe
These are the keys to the the treasure
Let's see this through together
Believe in a new forever
Cause we can do better

I believe
