[Verse 1: Zaecrusto]
Jet lag coming from Miami, I been waiting for this since i was in my jammies
Proving people wrong builds up my self esteem, they saying don't forget me but its harder than it seems
I been MIA for about a month or so, having fun with these hoes, stay trynna get chose
Life is movin' slow, picking up the pace, once you get your big break you still gotta run the race
Uh, my poetry is floetry, so when you hear my songs you already know its me
And i know it'll be a while till i get signed, just please promise me not to give up on me
Now they wanna do a whole bunch of videos, see, keep bumpin' that "Crusto" music through your stereo
Work hard play hard all the time, i don't even have a social life anymore
On my hustle and flow everyday, young DJay finding new things to explore, they say they want more?
Infinity homie, they should have all my albums in stores, yeah, dreams swishers can buy
Every time Ace got the weed the women multiply, cause they be wantin' some of that "Crusto"
So i'll just give em the big you know.! Blow!

[Verse 2: Ace Fulla]
(exhales) shout out to Zaecrusto man
I got hard flows, them prison bar flows, i want them Chi flows, them Kanye flows
Wanna be a MVP in my city like Derrick Rose, but i know Chicago can be cold when that wind blow
Boy im spittin' heat somebody crack a window, but not because its hot, cause the room is full of marijuana smoke
Im in the booth and my eyes are gettin' pretty low an what's in these swishers can buy my dreams
At least thats what I hope, but i ain't worried cause everything that I spit is dope
And plus I hear niggas i don't even know, talkin bout i gotta sick flow so its inevitable like suicide bombs how im finna blow
I ain't forget my team though, cause i know i got Zae, Maudy and Deuce i know they gone stand behind me
And so will my niggas back at home shout out to z and trizzy, the only real niggas in Indy cause fake niggas try to gas me
But I only take 93, but we gone blow up like time bomb, so don't get to thinkin' its nap time
Cause we'll be there by the time you open your eyes, and when we get there don't be surprised, cause these are
Dreams Swishers Can Buy, we in the basement gettin' high gotta endless supply, yeah
That's only cause I been grindin' hard nigga, so don't get to fuckin' with me nigga

Ace Fulla, Shout out to Zaecrusto again man, that's my nigga, To The Fullest
