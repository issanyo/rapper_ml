[Intro : Myriah & Anthony on the phone]

No and I'm not lying to you
Because I already told you
But I'm just saying , ummm..

I'm not gonna put you in the middle

Alright well please don't
Like I just like already had the conversation with Andrea and stuff
And I mean you do what you gotta do about money
I get it

Okay No I am gonna do what I gotta do
Okay
Cause
I'll be damned if somebody's gonna fuck us over.. x3


[Hook : Scottie Juug]

I'm sorry that I hurt you
But I had to get my bands right
Cause the trap it kept on calling
And that music shit was stalling..
So I had chase my dreams love
Push to start my car
Yeah That's a beamer
Popping xanny bars
Mona Lisa
Miss my foreign broad
Damn I need her..

I been cooling
With my niggas now...

We so turnt
That they done kicked us out...

Wavy gang
I'm fenna surf the crowd...

I came up
I was so down n out...


[Verse 1 : Scottie Juug]

Posted with some killas
Trap house steady boomin
Last night I had fucked up on a model
Like a movie

I be stepping out in all designer
Like I'm Boosie
I be playing bones
Wit some crips
Call me Tookie

No I'm not a rookie
Limo tint my Jag
Everywhere I go I keep the sacc
Up in my pants
Every time I think about my ex
I fucking laugh
Now I stunt on all that hoe
That bitch is fucking trash

Waste of fucking time
Bitch I fucking grind
Free my fucking nigga
Mane I really miss my round
Posted in the city
Young Scottie wit the clout
I'm the man around this bitch
I wish my unc could see me now!


[Hook : Scottie Juug]

[Verse 2 : Scottie Juug]

Wake up in the morning
Thinking back on all the times..
When I was dead broke
But you was still proud to be mines

You had lifted me up
When a young nigga was down
I ain't have nothing in me
And you lended me ounce
Swear to God when I make it
Ima buy yo ass a town
Ima put you In that Bentley
Have a butler drive you round

Flood yo ass wit diamonds
Cause yo ass deserve it all
But right now I'm wit my niggas
Moving packs we tryna ball


Mane fuck a hook
I'm going right back to a verse
If a nigga ever try one of my boys
He gone murked

Put his face up on a shirt
I'm talking funerals and shit
My lil woadie hit me up
And said he came across a lick

So it's juug time..
Bitch it's Juug time..

Ion fucking love this shit
Mane I just do it cause it's easy
Well that..
And plus I do it cause I'm greedy
I'm just chasing Benji Franklin's
And life I see on TV

Ion wana be star
I can't handle all that pressure
I just need a couple checks
From this music , to get fresher

Put my daughter Ina Porsche
Momma in a Benz
Get my uncle out the fucking cells
That nigga need to live

Weight is on my shoulders
Why am i afraid
I know that ima make it
I just pray I see the day

I got eyes behind my back
Just to watch out for the snakes
And in case they catch me slipping
Then young Quanny got the K!

He gone spray...

All my niggas rock designer
But I keep a pair of Vans
Cause them motherfuckers timeless
Young rock-star living
Moving packs from Tijuana
Mane the block is fucking hot
Mane I'm trappin in a sauna
Goddamn...
