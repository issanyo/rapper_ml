[Verse 1: DJJ]
Coming off The Obligation
JG's Emancipation
Made it on the map
Because them haters kept on hating

No reason to be faking
That paper hella chasing
Call it like a throwback Bray
Cause "Dudes we just gotta make it"
"Dudes we just gotta do it"
Mobbing to this music
Taylor in the back making raps like a sub sandwich

Too much to manage
Handling everything we can it's like having the job of a president
Plus a Barry Sanders

I apologize for all the cries
And all the drama that arised
But nothing good ever came from no respectful demise

Look at the outcome
Now we getting income
Income from the outcome
That's almost a contradiction

What's my prescription?
Because I swear I've went crazy
Through this ride, through this struggle
I then died, I then fumbled
It's the homecoming for me
My team is JG
Riding round my side of town with Bray and Taylor Dean
What's it seem?
Well it's C.R.E.A.M
Money's priority
But when it's gone
The moon still shine, the sun still gleam
I should have said the sun still shine and the moon still gleams
Because the moon just get its shine from the suns good bling
Sounds like one of them niggas that won't make it on the team
Recognizing the dream
Realizing that you can't have random niggas on your team
Because that's a bleed

Foot on the line we racing
You crossed the lines on what we believe in
Call it Cruicifixin'
What up

[Verse 2: DJJ]
I'm on this Drake beat, because it's all that I remembered
Memories so sharp like you bought a new blender
Memories of '97 in late December, 23rd
The day my mother gave birth to a future game winner
The game being life, and life's something to finish
Gotta go, gotta flow, until the lights get dimmer
And even then be a contender
Just so they'll remember
Lived in the bottom too long to not ever be a giver
Made it up
I'm a winner
Guaranteed freedom
Until the scholar's can't remember
Until the critics can't even remember
I'm a winner
Made it from I had to eat cheese on bread for dinner
Shoutout to mother never doubted any of my stigmas
Now she in the A, in a office with a big ass window
Meanwhile I'm eating all my comp'
Grubbing until I'm finished
Stacking bread high is my dream
Hope you remember
Born sinner, Jesse Smith, month after November
Flow Swimmer, swish swashing
Too hot, lighting timber
Memorial flipper, Mobbing with the niggas
Syrup sipper
Saucy chipper
I'm that nigga getting women
Staying high, Big Dipper
Tell Mckenna Miller we having rotel for dinner
What's up

[Verse 3: DJJ]
Beat so long, 2 pages full to the end
Kinda like when you love something so much, you can't wait for it to begin
In the game called life, we live to not end
So living until the death is just an understatement
Recovering and owning is to me the same difference
Especially when the last example you had was him
The world so crazy
The world so dim
You know things messed up when you want to fuck your bestfriend
I mean she bad as fuck in my defense
I got that Chiefs defense

Tell lotion on the walls that I'm still here until the end
And tell Xzavion that I'm still his bro, never forget
Jada Brown, I'm sorry for my bad texting habits
But I still love you and you'll always be my little sis
Never forget my nigga that helped me get this new trend
JG still strong
World's Strongest Men
Got a group of niggas with me, but you gotta stay independent

Life so short
This game so slim
You either lose or you win
Submit or you pin
Give up all your wants, and I'm not talking no Buddhism
Not gonna lie I got some wants of some new trends
Back at the mall I saw that strapback Pink Dolphin
I'ma get it
Ask Bray and Taylor, that shit was sexy they saw it
But anyway get rid of you other wants, because they'll get rid of your intentions

Tell everybody I love them
I'm going head first in this business
Gone
