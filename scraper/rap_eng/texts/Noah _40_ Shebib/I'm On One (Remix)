[Intro: chief waKiL]
I'm on one
I'm on one
I'm KC, I'm on one

[Verse 1: chief waKiL]
I used to be a loner in my basement cooking heat up
Now they say my flow is food for thought so you can eat up
High school, cool kid, Renegade reppin'
Any crew that try to step was nothing more than uneffective
I woke up in the morning, but not early enough for breakfast
Music on my mind, I do my homework in a second
My mama said get further education, you got no plans
But after graduation I went look ma, no hands
I'm on
Goodbye Kansas City, hello California
Promise I won't be gone forever, I'll be back before then
At least I think I will, but you're forever in my heart
In case I'm call, just stick around and do something important
Like save the world, now I'm on a mission
I'm on the battlefield alone like where's the competition
I guess I made my own lane, nobody like me
Survivor of a dying breed, I'm on my Ronald Isley

[Interlude: chief waKiL]
(I'm on, I'm on, I'm on one)
I'm KC, I'm on one
Yeah, I put on for my city
Put your hands up if you're with me
Say I'm on one

[Verse 2: chief waKiL]
Can't nobody do it like that
I can take it to the burbs, I can take it to the track
Catching every single word that I put up on wax
Going hard for my guy and the middle of the map
Yeah, the middle of the map
Lil' man, chief wakila
Real hip hop like [?]
Better than these veterans, they're looking like beginners

[Interlude: chief waKiL]
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on one

[Verse 3: chief waKiL]
DJ Q, spin me on them 1s and 2s
The game's in need of fresh air, so I'm the one they running to
Move from Kansas City to LA with just a dream
So like Tinisha White, I'm not only a chief, but I'm a king
Yeah, baby I've just seen a vision
So if I fit your description of your type then you should tell me I'm on
So go tell all your guy friends they'll be missing you
Besides my intermission's telling me that you can't say that I'm wrong

[Outro: chief waKiL]
Cause I'm on
Cause I'm on
I'm KC, I'm on one
I'm on
(I'm on, I'm on, I'm on one)(8x)
