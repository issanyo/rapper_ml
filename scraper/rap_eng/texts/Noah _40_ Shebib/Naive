[Intro: Drake]
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do

[Verse 1: Oliver Sim + Drake]
I turned a blind eye
Let the borders get wavy
Nothing touches me lately
Shouldn't I be having fun?
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
It's hard to define
When my memory's hazy
Everyone's trying to save me
Can't they see I'm having fun?
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do

[Chorus: Oliver Sim + Romy Madley Croft]
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
Can't tell no one what it means to me
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
And the longer that I leave it, I can feel it taking over me

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
Shy away and hide out
When it's calling me out
When it's weighing me down
I'll play it down
When all the trouble I've found
Comes back around
If it's catching me now
That's the wrong thing
I'll play it down
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
