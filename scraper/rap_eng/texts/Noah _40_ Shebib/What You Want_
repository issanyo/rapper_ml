[Verse 1]

Like an abscess tooth when I pull it's a forced grip
You lost cause you force it
Go ahead forfeit
Force fed the four kids
Green like the vegetables they won't eat
Red like the energy that hate breeds
Black like the shadows so they can't see
The M I S T is heavy
When the metal sprays at a Chevy filled with niggas thirsty to be ready
Brother searches for machete
Execute evacuation strategies
Properly used cause I knew they would rat on me
In my town
Investigations broke down
Lack of interest
Incest in politics all the scholars acknowledge this
While we wait for apologies
I'm fed up trying to get my dad away from the mac trucks
The words its your written on the globe in orbit
The globe was a bar
And I'm the cameo star

[Hook]
Make What You Want From It
Make What You Want From It
Make What You Want From It

What You Want From It

Make What You Want From It
Make What You Want From It
Make What You Want From It

What You Want From It

[Verse 2]

Scholar of a drug addict
Couldn't do the mathematics
Turned to the service
1st term addiction surfaced
Jobs for  change sufficed
Crack pipe in the bed
Baby on the night stand all night
Result of the one night stand one
Had to be the man
Had to be a man
Had to take her hand
Couldn't take the stand
Had a great fall
Had to be in autumn
The compacter caught him
Relapse of the past faster like
Usain bolt or the flash
When it pass your ocular
Continuum with the minimum
To get some heroin
Family was the medium
Claimed it was a lump
Forgot about her only son

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Didn't visit him on Christmas
Shoulda hurt him
To strong
Watched his last son desert him
And he still on this earth with him
My mother was the only one to take care
Mother struggling to hide them grey hairs
She's stressed out
I want see her rest now
No nursing home but in a home where
She only nursing she feels its her life purpose
Reverse the life forces
Barely stable
Now she live in a fortress
Hot maple
By chefs able to
Home make em
By the command
Of a wave the hand
Away with the cans
Away with the bullets
Away with the stress thank god for this music
