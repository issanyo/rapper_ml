[Intro]
Yeah
Euro's 2014
Shit is really crazy, look

[Verse]
Off of features alone
They say Euro's in the zone
Ima, Ima, Ima put, all my niggas on
I'll make sure to give em them watches, and chains like [??] stones
Have they wrists like Sammy Sosa, and they nice like Barry Bonds
Ima, Ima, marry, every Nia long
Ima need at least a milli off of family needs alone
Bring it to the table no one in the family eats alone
That's the code, I don't make em
I don't break em either
Tryna park myself up at the top and break the meter
It takes longer to hunt the food than it takes to eat up
And women wonder why it take so long for us to meet up
I'm busy tryna make sure I can keep attractin' divas
By keeping on the road of riches and diamond rings
I'm supposed to be taking pictures and signing things
I like how our thrones looking, it fits for a king
But don't mind little old me, I'm just eyeing things
But it wouldn't hurt to try on, try me, try on
Ain't on the shit that I'm on, I do not be reply on
