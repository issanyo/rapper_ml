[Verse 1]
Now everybody got a 30 like curry
Never shoot but they ball out in a hurry
Say they make you run yo chain like laps mane
But they really a bunch a young nobodies with no bodies
Straight outta Bowie talking that reckless
They all act the same swear he got a checklist
Scream he keep it hunnit, really he 50
Living out the burbs boy you grew up wit me
Then he came to the club with that sticky icky
Done told everybody that he kept a semi
Trynn test the boy, a lil slope that's slippery
Oh now he wanna hide what's on his neck like a hickie

[Bridge]
They just wanna be hood so bad, lil homie is you mad?
Why you trade this for that? I be no where near the trap
But believe me I got my strap and I can't go back
Nah momma I can't go back lil homies don't know how to act
Started from the bottom? Nah boy you been middle class
But I still let it go like that

[Chorus2x]
But you know I got my Mac 11, .45, .357, in my mind
Thats gun talk, no peace of mind
But believe me I got my piece in mind

[Verse 2]
Came close to death like 50, ain't take nine shots but nine shots of henny
Cause I spit bars like liquor for the drinkers so they life flash right before they eyes like a picture
Ain't ready to die, no biggie but this life might get you hypnotized like its no biggie
So when friends switch up like Pac and Biggie, then everybody coming after yo throne like its no biggie
Did It with a pencil, another instrumental
Get that I'm sick with it but my illness was mental
But I know kids putting tree on, pops ain't pay the bill so he still keep the heat on
Im above the sky, still fly without feathers
But sick as I am man I still feel under the weather
Put it in retrospect, haters are full of it
Yo my mind is a tech the mic is the trigger pulling it
So I keep my mouth closed and bite the bullet then
Dead is what you shoulda been imagine where it could've went
Know too many people that I shoulda pushed the button on
Talking bout yo soldiers yeah you fronting like you army strong
Who you talking on? lil man I cock back you'll be lucky if the gun jam
Oh now he wanna flash, pose with the clip
You ain't bout what's in yo pics boy you a catfish
Always Trynn hop on some dumb ratchets , mad cuz you ain't fit up in that bracket
Honestly a helly ain't all that fashion
I'm me, thats why I had the old Nike jacket
I ain't finna flex I ain't put that cash in
No hand me down but it was granddad passing that got it
Good with the words got you hooked on phonics
Girl stressed got her hooked on chronic
Yo go pop the trunk not for a spare aight
Cuz these days I ain't in the mood to spare yo life
I mean yo career, what you don't notice here is that you think you know my moves but I done switched the gear
It's all blackjack how I played the game
Been had the bars all I needed was a stage
Asa came thru, he a ace of spades
Add Deaize, that's 21 ways to fame

[Chorus 2x]
