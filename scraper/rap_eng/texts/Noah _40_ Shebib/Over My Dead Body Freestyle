[Intro]
Uhh, uhh
Fred The Godson y'all, Frederico, haha
T.B.M., Blok work, BX
Hope all of y'all had a good 2011, now we entering 2012
It's your boy

[Hook]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only, over my dead bo-ohh-ohhhdy

[Verse]
Thinking back dealing the cracks was just serving
They told me that practice makes perfect
Now I'm writing these raps, I'm just working
You should see how they react makes it worth it
Now what's your purpose? Even in Scrabble
When you got the same letters in the box, you can't word it
They say I'm nice, two ways well
Put the mic back in the game like 2k12
They re-enact what we living
So I think back to them places I revisit
Like Capital Pun, Hard Knock, Life After
You talk about the new, then Fred the God right after
I read this tweet this nigga said that I'm ugly
DM from his baby moms said she wan' fuck me, haha
Baby, the chain on the collar
I got dimes, give you change for a dollar, haha
Everything is a joke to me
These soda pop rappers really used to buy coke from me
They all my children, it's like soaps to me
And every true Hip-Hop fan they see they hopes in me
Got a epic flow to hear
They see my bars like a episode in Cheers
And with that you can see the hate
So I might not bring it back just recreate
Allieviate all the bitch niggas, abbrieviate
Then watch 'em get somebody I know so they can mediate
When Pun died just let me know I appreciate him
Bringing the Bronx back to see it all depreciate
What's today's news? Hold on, wait a second
I mean Drew Brees just broke Marino record
Aaron Rodgers, 46 and 5
He'll end up with the MVP, let you decide
The NBA back playing
Oh, you looking for your girl? She in the back playing

Hahaha, I'm just playing with y'all, man
Huh, it's Fred the God yo
