[Verse 1]
I’m about to pack my bags and hit the road
I remember winter nights and sleeping cold
I was stuck up on a girl call me Romeo
But fuck that shit I’m sticking to my studio
Ha, momma always told me to chase my dreams
You know that I gotta get that shit by any means
Yeah, ain’t got time for no more stressing
Ain’t got time for some oldy trying to give me lessons

[Chorus]
Yeah
I know I’m chasing fame
These haters be up on my shit like every day
Yeah
Real soon you gone see the cash accumulate
Just let it marinate
Listen to my words let it marinate
Ha, Yeah
Just give it time every fucking day you’ll hear my name

[Verse 2]
I feel like every day my ego getting bigger
To my niggas up in Carolina, swear I miss you
Damn, man I swear I miss you
I’mma get the bag and feed my brother and my little sisters
Yeah, and speaking of my sisters
Don’t be playing ‘round and chasing after these stupid niggas
Cause all they gonna do is rip your heart up
And don’t be hanging with them hoes who just suck and fuck
Yeah
It takes time to heal
Hope nobody’s offended I’m just keeping it real, yeah
And I’m just chasing mills’
Never gonna stop even when I get the record deal
Honestly, fuck these hating niggas fuck these hating bitches
They be on your dick when they see that you got all the riches
If you wasn’t there before then my nigga you’ll be missing
When I close up on that door you’ll be regretting and wishing

[Chorus]
Yeah
I know I’m chasing fame
These haters be up on my shit like every day
Yeah
Real soon you gone see the cash accumulate
Just let it marinate
Listen to my words let it marinate
Ha, Yeah
Just give it time every fucking day you’ll hear my name

[Verse 3]
I used to always doubt, “Will I ever make it?”
Funny how things can be fixed with a simple conversation
And I ain’t got no choice but to play the game
And I ain’t got no choice but to chase the fame
All my niggas know ain’t no time for switching
We know that we gotta get it, yeah we on a mission
Yeah we on a mission
Get up on the charts get this money - fuck these bad bitches

[Chorus]
Yeah
I know I’m chasing fame
These haters be up on my shit like every day
Yeah
Real soon you gone see the cash accumulate
Just let it marinate
Listen to my words let it marinate
Ha, Yeah
Just give it time every fucking day you’ll hear my name
