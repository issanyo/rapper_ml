Intro

Yeah
Gods plan was to leave me in the van
Runnin' on my own hands
Call that shit a handstand
Popping bands
Verse #1

I was never meant to make it this far
Everybody knows that I'm subpar
Until I start rapping I'm a fucking god
Thats why its gods plan not ours
Everybody knows where I go
Everybody fucking with the flow
Mixing them beats making rolls
Poppin off the pillie Imma row
I dont wanna play in the snow, less you talking coke, less you talkin both
Bridge

And them boat rules Panama and Im fucking talking whole school
Fucking with them bitches all day
Sorry, I dont really fuck wit bitches like that no more
I only got one girl hold on
Running with the bands in the hand
Put a fucking band in to plant
Everybody hopping in a van

Verse #2

Fuck on me ,yeah bitch fuck on me
But I won't fuck back maybe leave a text or three
Freestyling is a fucking rap ting
And I fucking rat on you if you fucking rat on me (nope)
Unless you be snitching for no reason
Then i pop you flakes in a season
Season you like steak ain't no reason
Fuckin all these hoes what I thinking
But i got one girl for the reason
Fucking with everyone fleekin'
Everybody knows what my reason
I dont like no private school ting
Tryna get to south but I can't (Worcester)
Fucking with my boy from the clan
Boof on the beat like

Verse #3

Spitting bars like I'm on average
Kendrick Lamar I past him
King Los still rapping (410)
Guns still clappin'
Guns still rapping, guns still wrapped in the bag, with the brown bag
Holding the [?]
They say its beer but it ain't
They got gat and they running wit all the rats as they shooting back at the rats
Fucking with the mans for a reason
Got the bag rappin' for threes and
With my girl always be thinking
What the fuck he doing for no reason

Outro

Fucking with the thinking
What in the world are they thinking
Fucking with them dont believe in no fucking reason
