[Verse 1]
You said this would be the very last time
I'll be seeing you
'Cause you don't even wanna talk
And you don't even wanna meet up, up
You don't even wanna be friends
Pretend you like me, ooh, oh, oh
I take time for love
It's right, your love takes hold of you
Take time for love, babe
And try my best to explain, yeah
But I had to throw it all away, why?

[Chorus]
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave it, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away

[Post-Chorus]
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
I'm in the courtyard of your mansion in Westlake
Feelin' a way about today, weather grey
Jacket on, movin' along, checkin' my phone
Thought I heard you call, I was wrong
Why has it been so long, why?

[Chorus]
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave it, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave it, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away

[Bridge]
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
No, no, no, no, no
I had to give up, yeah I had to give up
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
I gave your love away
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
(Take time for love)
That's what you said to me
Take time for love, make time for
Make time for love, take time for love
So I know that we can be something
Why

[Chorus]
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave it, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
