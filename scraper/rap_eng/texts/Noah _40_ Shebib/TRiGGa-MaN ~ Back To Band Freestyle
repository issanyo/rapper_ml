[Intro]
Oh mane, oh mane, low mane, not again

[Verse]
I learned the game from my pops
You could never check me
Back to back like Darryl up front, '2011
Back to the back like solos, "9" to "11"
Back to back reppin' '608-1 to '107
Whoa, I'm killing the game in every dimension
Not in the mood to make commands, just stand at attention
Yeah see I'm still confused about ya concepts
How y'all joke and fire shots with no concepts
I wanna see my niggas at the games
Y'all gone make this young rattler show his fangs
Y'all gone make me pull out the "Johnny Lee Lanes"
Y'all gone make me fuck em up "Medium Change"
Ain't dropped in '4 years nigga where y'all at
Y'all like bitches with braided sew-ins, niggas where y'all tracks
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all sap
I couldn't put this on yeti, but ya boy still snapped
I mean ohhh, care for the "Cola", man, they know what's up
TRiGGa-MaN run the streets, I never road the bus
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
This for y'all dark skinned nigga time to light em up
Tryna find yourself you gotta look more
Still buying hoodies using vouchers from the book store
Y'all niggas cheap like white Tees from the hood store
Take the Free "Rade", that's the only thing I'm good for
Yeeeah, trigga fingers turn to twiddle fingers
Yeeeah, y'all been sleeping on this dreaming nigga
I'm not the type of nigga taking flights with niggas
Shout-out to all my foxy bitches swiping niggas
Just getting started, "Slow One" with my knee up
Now I'm bout to "Bring It On" time to speed up
DJ Khalid DJ Khalid man another one
Got a car now, but used to ride the shuttle once
I got the lines straight goin' back to back
Yeah, goin' back to back
I got the "Rade" in me goin' back to back
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even if yall tell me we just gelling as friends
Not even when yall sayin', "TRiGGa tell 'em again"
Yall been putting on a show, tryna sellout again
Ohhh, I need better seating
I didn't wanna do it, gave me ever reason
I'm cooking up you jerks using hella season
Somebody flag 'em down, nigga pledge allegiance
Please, check 'em for a strap or a mouth piece
Please, uma ride for my niggas like "The Drought 3"
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a true friend, who's a fake one
Please, somebody stop me
I feel like "Apollo Creed" vs "Rocky"
Got pre-drill in 2 weeks this my last one
Soon as a nigga patch, they gon'
They gon' ask me why we play this shit back to back
Yeeeah, uma run it back to back
They gon' hate it when I click the sticks back to back
I took a break from choppin', now it's back to that, nigga
