[Verse 1]
I'm really sorry, I didn't mean it
Know what you said, I just can't believe it
I feel discarded, I feel mistreated
I think of love, and you're the meaning

[Chorus]
Baby, I, baby, I
Can't shake the feeling that
I could make it better
If I could have sex with you
I could make it better
If I could have sex with you

[Verse 2]
Tired of losing, but there's no winning
Dug a hole and I put us in it
Now you're departed, I feel defeated
I think of love, I think you're the meaning

[Chorus]
Baby, I, baby, I
Can't shake the feeling that
I could make it better
If I could have sex with you
I could make it better
If I could have sex with you

[Outro]
You, with you
If I could have sex with you
Right now baby
Right now baby
Still in your world
Soon as I get back again
I'll tell you that I've never loved nobody else
I'll tell you that Ive never touched nobody else
I'll tell you that I've never felt nobody else
No, I'm not riding with just anybody else
I'll tell you that you've never loved nobody else
I'll tell you that you've never touched nobody else
I'll tell you that you've never felt nobody else
I know that you're not riding with just anybody else
