[Verse 1]
Decisions, decisions
All we ever make are decisions
Opinions, opinions
Tell me if they're facts or they're feelings

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad news on the airwaves, we've all got a part to play
Guess they're trying to scare me, some things never change
Even on a good day, I can't help but feel this way
We've been making bad choices

[Chorus]
I think 'til I fall asleep
I think 'til I fall asleep

[Verse 2]
Visions, visions
I think I'm losing my vision
Another victim...
Another victim of competition

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad news on the airwaves, we've all got a part to play (play it)
They're trying to scare me, some things never change
Even on a good day, I can't help but feel this way
We've been making bad choices

[Chorus]
I think 'til I fall asleep
I think 'til I fall asleep

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel like we're worlds apart
I don't know where to start
There's so much fear here
Sometimes I feel like we're worlds apart
I don't know where to start
I don't know, sometimes I feel like we're worlds apart
I don't know where to start

[Chorus]
I think 'til I fall asleep
I think 'til I fall asleep
I think 'til I fall asleep
I think 'til I fall asleep

[Outro]
I think until I fall asleep
I think until I fall asleep
