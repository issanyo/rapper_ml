[Chorus]
Room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci
Freak in you (freak in you)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Is there a freak in you? (Freak in you)

[Verse 1]
Come and talk to me, oh
Quick, rush, rush, rush
Baby, just like Kimora Lee, oh
So pretty, girl, you belong in a gallery
What's your fantasy? (Your fantasy?)
Say something you ain't never did (ain't never did)
Like fuck and suck a real nigga

[Refrain]
I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm a fisher
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup
These lines right here gon' really, really make you fuck
These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around

[Pre-Chorus]
(There's always more)
There's always more, that’s for sure
There's always more, that’s for sure

[Chorus]
Because there's a room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci
(All I care about is)
Freak in you (All I care about is)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Is there a freak in you? (Freak in you)

[Verse 2]
Come and talk to me, oh (talk to me, oh)
I, I don't like the shy game
I don't like no mind games
'Cause by the time you make your mind up
Time's up
Hey, hey, you gon' have to climb me, climb me
If you want it
Burnin' rubber (skrrt)
Burnin' through these rubbers is exhausting
Drop, drop, hot
Baby girl, it's Crossfit
I'm gon' grab you by the hips, hey

[Refrain]
I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm a fisher
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup
These lines right here gon' really, really make you fuck
These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around

{Pre-Chorus 2]
Ain't no peer pressure
Girl, it's what you wanna do
So what kind of mood you in?
You know what I wanna do
You see what I see

[Chorus]
There's a room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me (they notice me)
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci (Jodeci)
(All I care about is)
Freak in you (all I care about is)
Freak in you
Is there a freak in you?

[Bridge]
Ma-Magic City bumpin', but my crib is nicer (bumpin')
Got wifey at home
Your night could pan out if wifey like ya
I seen your old niggas lookin' like some old niggas (yeah)
I’m in the ‘sace mansion with some Gucci ghost slippers (Gucci ghost slippers)
I got more gold in my mouth, I think she a gold digger
That spandex might triple my antics
Might take off the bandage, might fuck like a savage
Prayers out to Magic, sav-sav-savage, mmm

[Chorus]
There's a room full of beautiful women but I want one
(I'm lookin at you)
Room full of women and they notice me (they notice me)
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci (Jodeci)
(All I care about is)
Freak in you (all I care about is)
Freak in you
Is there a freak in you?
