[Verse 1]
Now tell me that you've always known my name
I tell you that I've always fucked with you
Just tell me that you like it hardcore girl
And I'll do what you say

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna know how you feel inside
And if imagination serves me right all night

[Chorus]
Tell me to go
Out, in
Out, in
Out, in
Out
Tellin' me
Out, in
Out, in
Out, in
Out
You’re tellin' me
Out, in
Out, in
Out, in
What you wanna do
In, out
In, out
In, out
I wanna go in and out of your body baby

[Verse 2]
Tell me that you've always been my fan
And everything you heard turned out so true
I'm kneeling by your body baby, kissing on your throne
Now let me crown your highness baby, your highness babe

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna know how you feel inside
And if imagination serves me right all night

[Chorus]
Tell me to go
Out, in
Out, in
Out, in
Out
Tellin' me
Out, in
Out, in
Out, in
Out
You’re tellin' me
Out, in
Out, in
Out, in
What you wanna do
In, out
In, out
In, out
I wanna go in and out of your body baby

[Outro: Edited Vocals]
Go in and out of your body baby
Go in and out of your body baby
I'm kneeling by your body baby
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
