Part I: Try

[Verse 1]
I don't have a type but if I did it would be you
If I did, it would be you
But I don't never chase you down
Running after love is the last thing that I do
But you know, I'm running around
Cause I adore you, stop playing around
You know you know you know ya
You make me feel some kind of way babe
You know you know you know it
You make me feel some kind of way babe

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you want more than a little
More than a little
It was just enough baby
And if I give you more than a little
More than a little
You should know it's something
Cause you're the first to make me

[Chorus 1]
Try, try for ya
Try, try for ya
You're the first to make me
Try, try for ya
Try, try for ya
Try, gotta try for ya
You're the first to make me

[Verse 2]
I don't have a type
If I did, it would be you
I think you're perfect for me
Running after love is the last thing that I do
But you know, I'm running around
Cause I don't, stop playing around
You know you know you know it
You make me feel some kind of way babe
You know you know you know it
You make me feel some kind of way babe

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you want more than a little
More than a little
It was just enough baby
And if I give you more than a little
More than a little
You should know it's something
Cause you're the first to make me

[Chorus 1]
Try, try for ya
Try, try for ya
You're the first to make me
Try, try for ya
Try, try for ya
Try, gotta try for ya
You're the first to make me

[Bridge]
I can't believe I'm saying this
Cause I got rules, but I'm breaking them all for you
Yeah, I'm breaking them all for you
Yeah I got rules, but I'm breaking them all for you
(breaking them all)

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you want more than a little
More than a little
It was just enough baby
And if I give you more than a little
More than a little
You should know it's something
Cause you're the first to make me

[Chorus 1]
Try, try for ya
Try, try for ya
You're the first to make me
Try, try for ya
Try, try for ya
Try, gotta try for ya
You're the first to make me
