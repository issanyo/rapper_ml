Prod. 40, King Mic


Intro: (The Evolution)


Hook:
How I’m feeling, it doesn’t matter
Cause you know I’m okay
Instead, I ask myself “why do you worry?”
When you know, you know I’m the same
You know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body…

Verse 1:
16 months ago they said that i was dead i guess this my resurrection then
They said demaio killed me and ironically i got this homie on a track damn
Its kinda funny because you know that this moment that we got we gonna never get it back
I'm telling you go out and make it last last September throw it in the trash
Everyone that knows me they think that i'm the man
They think that i'm the goat and my dawg you never know
Thats all i wanna be i don't need these fake friends
I don't need these fake fam i just need myself man
These people wondering how i do it tho
They knowing that i got no help
They say i made a name for myself
Like i advertised myself i don't need no help
Ever since i was young in pre school
I wanted to rap thought it would be cool
And then reality hit like you gotta make it work because "ya neva know" man
I'm thinking what if Marshall Mather's didn't rhyme
I'm kinda mad because my ex i still a dime
But now i'm chasing dollars now
I don't need that clown now dawg they ain't around
This how i'm feeling at the moment
Mentally i'm focused physically i wrote this
And honestly the jitters still there
They dissapear once the balls thrown in the air yea

Hook:

Verse 2:
Now theres a young king dawg then what am i?
Come on big boy man you can't even rhyme
Just left out the studio wit my cousin
I'm tryna pump u up like Joe Budden
But honestly i feel like i made y"all
Because if i never dropped growth you wouldn't have a song dawg
And people wanna hate and they claimed i really changed i ain't got time for that small talk
Remember how it felt in September
16 months later its December
And i promise in another 12 months
Imma be up at the top the ritz carlton bruh
Reminiscing on life people that missed out
Member when they said i'm nothing yea well dawg i'm blessed now
And everybody saying that i changed it isn't true
I spit nothing but the truth hope my raps are bulletproof
This is nothing but the truth and nothings far stretched
Like i'm bout to take a lap but its more like a race
But i'm coming in first and my dog thats no debate
And this people wanna hate man the wish they was the king
Y'all can try and diss me but you gonna miss me
When i'm dead and gone ayo shouts to GSP
Know he got my back i be spit real facts
Shouts to Mirassol and Savin y'all my fam know that
Remember how i felt at the start of it
And can't forget the people that i came wit
But now y'all watching me doing what i love
To those that left dawg its nothing but love
