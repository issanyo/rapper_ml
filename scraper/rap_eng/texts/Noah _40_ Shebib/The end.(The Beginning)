I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
(Echo: I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready
(Echo: I'm ready, I'm ready)

Golden skies....Golden Streets... Golden Lives....
None of it compares to the look I see in her eyes....
Her Angel Wings Carried me from prior demise...
City of God who woulda thought I coulda made it riiight?
Just goes to show you love conquers all life's trials...
Loving the afterlife gotta say it's type wild...
MLK Malcolm Billie Holiday..
Left Eye Big L Pac and MJ
We all kicking it no time limits on our day
No stress we blessed we saw God's face........
This can be you if you not scared to make a way...

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
(Drake: I deserve it, I think it deserve it..Let it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
(Drake: I can't take it)

Don't ever be afraid... to achieve the unthinkable...
You can do it..
