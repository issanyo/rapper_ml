Alright let's get this started the final session of #PhilosophySunday is LIVE!
You know da rules tag ya responses wit #PS or be overlooked

Before we get started I want to say thank you to everybody who has supported #PhilosophySunday over the years!

It was started to use Twitter for some a little more profound and engaging and I think we can say we've been successful!

#PhilosophySunday would not have been possible without fans and arm chair intellectuals chiming in on the topics and striking #TwitterGold!

I want to send a very special thank you  to @wirelessphi for giving #PhilosophySunday a little more philosophical credibility!

Hopefully you guys and gals can continue #PhilosophySunday with @wirelessphi or on your own with your own personal Twitter accounts.

Lastly I want to say sorry to all you football fans who had to make the "tough" lol decision 2 choose between #PS or those Sunday games! Lol

So let's get this started. I (as Wasalu Jaco) started painting a couple years back kinda as a hobby & then got a little more serious
#PS

I found out that the painting became just as meaningful as my music in terms of what idea I was trying to express. Layers of meaning. #PS

Story of how one of my paintings became the cover for 1 of my albums I will save for the memoirs but the painting itself we can discuss #PS

Let's have a look at the painting and the cover #PS
