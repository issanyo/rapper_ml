[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
The Cool
Turn me up

[Verse 1]
He came back
In the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it 'cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies
Sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy
From when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory
He didn't mind it
But, he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second grade handwriting simply read, "I miss ya"
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion
As he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken
He kicked his casket open
And he...

[Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live, then you die
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules
Making your moves
Paying your dues
Chasing the cool

[Verse 2]
Not at all nervous
As he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a, hmm, reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined
Through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold
And almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave
And looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped
Six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box
Wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours
Because he wasn't older
Used some flowers
To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he...

This life goes passing you by

You born, you live, then you die
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules
Making your moves

[Verse 3]
He begged for some change
To get him on the train
"Damn, that nigga stank"
Is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt
But it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window
Of what he became
A long look
Wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter of fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thang
First he had to find something to slang
Next stop was his block
It had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot
Where he was shot
Shocked
That some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there
So they pulled out, and robbed him
With the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said
"You're scared, ain't ya?"
He said
"Hustler for death
No heaven for a gangsta"
And...
