I knew it
You bet
Blake Lewis?
Ha-ha
Na goes that
Is there...

I saw your picture in the paper today girl
All of a sudden it hit me
You're someone that should know me
Possibly drive me crazy
In the pages and all over the magazine covers
People gossip about you and your long list of lovers
(You don't) Girl you don't know about me
But you will, that's for sure
Let's start with an introduction!

I want you to know my name
Take a little sip with some conversation
It's driving me insane
What's it gonna take for some motivation?
I want you to know my name
Girl I just ain't got no shame
Them other guys causing you pain
I'll show you that I'm not the same

Not the same
I swear to you I'm not the same
Ooh, ooh

I've got this question I keep asking myself
Are you my cure for addiction, are you love's definition
Or just bad for my health?
There's only one way to find out
What we need is each other
Make our own little story
We could start it today

I want you to know my name
Take a little sip with some conversation
It's driving me insane
What's it gonna take for some motivation?
I want you to know my name
Girl I just ain't got no shame
Them other guys causing you pain
I'll show you that I'm not the same

This is how it's gonna look, just like this
You and me pretty girl and a future of bliss
You want a dog, white fence, maybe couple of kids
Anything I'm a bring you just make me a list
I promise I can make you smile, oh
I swear that I'll be worth your while
I promise I can make you smile, oh
I swear that I'll be worth your while

My name's elf
Dressed like a verse
More like a rebel yell-ith at the top of your lungs
A noise like the last level
So double-headed
Impressed with no pressure
And negros jive the affair
So that stupid Fresh when they credit him with sitting
Oh, super deaf, with a reputable deception
I'm shopping both sides
I'm so double-edgy
I've done a lot and my next exception, no, objective
Is to make you a member of the club
Team person 15
F-n-f-uh!
You'll like it over here
Atmosphere's all love
Tune in and drop out
Your brain's all uh
So keep your eyes on me
Your "yes" is on 10 and your "Why" is on 3
Your "no" is on none and your fear is on the same
Check your new tattoo
You wanna know my name, it's like

All I wanna do is know you

Lupe!

I want you to know my name
Take a little sip with some conversation
It's driving me insane
What's it gonna take for some motivation?
I want you to know my name
Girl I just ain't got no shame
Them other guys causing you pain
I swear to you I'm not the same

I want you to know my name
Take a little sip with some conversation
It's driving me insane
What's it gonna take for some motivation? (What's it gonna be?)
I want you to know my name
Girl I just ain't got no shame
Them other guys causing you pain
I'll show you (I swear) that I'm not the same

I swear to ya
I'll show you that I'm not the same
I swear to ya
Not the same...
