[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
All Praise to the Most Highest
King Tut Pyramid Science
Get a nigga's game so the niggas don't riot
Niggas get defiant then we give them to the lions
President, Long hair don't care
And I've never been a client
Always had gas, never been a hybrid
Always drop bass, never been a pirate
(Nigga nigga)
Only when its fake when a nigga don't buy it [?]
All up in your face when I really wanna hide it
And that's plain sight, UFO is my plane type
Lift a nigga up with my plane lights
(Put a nigga down [?])
This the plane flight to the next dimension
This is exorcism, get the name right
And lets do it...
