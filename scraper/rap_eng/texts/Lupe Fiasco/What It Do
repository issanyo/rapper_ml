[Intro]
Somethin' new
Geah, uh
Believe me like you saw me on TV
My name is Lu, somethin' new
I show you what it does (what it does)
How it is (how it is)
And what it do (what it, do)

[Verse 1]
I saw it on TV, I was told to buy a CD
The CD told me buy a TV
The TV that I bought came with a CD that said go and buy the DVD
The DVD that I bought came with a CD
Which was the DVD of the makin' of the TV, that I saw
Which told me to go and buy the CD in the first place, wait nah
I put the DVD in the TV so you can see what I saw
But wait, it's a CD so you can't see me, odd
Maybe I should just come out on DVD like CB, far
With mad special effects and maybe a CG, car
To ride around in on your TV
Bumpin' the CD that I got when I copped the TV
Which is the same TV in my car

[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do

[Verse 2]
My DVD is gonna come with a CD, too
And music I recorded through a CB
You see when I bought the TV I spent the money for the microphone and
The home recorders too
And the foam that you need for your crew (crew)
That blocks out the noise when your voice's recording you (you)
Tell 'em to be quiet 'til the voice recording through (through)
Garage band file then export to iTunes
Then burn a CD and put it in the CG car that you saw on your TV
But you ain't gotta do that at all you see
Cuz the whole CD is being broadcasted on CB, dog
Break up break up, eh hee haw
They can't do what they see me do
But I'm the dude that's easy/Eazy too
Like I'm Eazy Juniorrrrrr
When the CD starts, better tune in
Or you gotta watch the reruns
Homie this is food for thought
Better put it on your fork like GD Hooverrrrrrrr-ah

[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)
What up homegirls my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)

[Verse 3]
Now that's two TV's that's in my car
That’s not really real man that's really a fraud
It’s from the green screen
My CD might not pump on your block
But at the truck stop man I'm really a star
So how you gonna act now?
Same music homeboys hollin' in the background (yo!)
See I had to lay the smack down
Act like a X addict
Act now gateway off to the next habitat (habitat)
Couldn’t match it now I'm laying that down like a mat now (ooh!)
And checkin’ for me, now they pat down like a Howard Gap found
I was hidin' in my shoes, with me and my two crews
We took from other things you ain't finding in the stew
That’s why's no booth and I'm rhymin' in the Lou, still buying the CD
That’s why I catch 'em rhymin' in to me while they rhymin' in they room
Now I'm off to Caloon for some rhymin' and some tea
My pinky up on my tea cup
If you play the DVD at the same time that you start the CD
You gon' see that they sync up
And if you happen to doubt, just play the CD while you watch the TV
And you gon' see that I'm doing what I'm rappin' about

[Hook]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
It’s somethin' new
What up homeboys my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)
What up homegirls my name is Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu, Lu
I show you what it is, what it did and it what it do (do, do, do, do, do)
