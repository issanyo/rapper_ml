"Piru Blues"

[Hook]
Show me how to breathe again
Give me a reason to end
This pain and all this suffering
Is there something, can I win?
It's hard to believe again
Is it something?
Or maybe nothing, nothing

[Verse 1]
Blood stains on the camouflage jacket
And love pain hands on the fully automatic
She looks into the eyes of her comrade/lover
Comcast, C-SPAN cover warfare rages on the other
Side of the wall where the revolution utters
In the language besides brotherly love for the sufferers
It's the sacrifice that touches her
He brushes her cheek, smeared with black smudges
Of oil and dirt he picked up from falling to the earth
When did things fall so far to love and so into berserk?
Supplies in the church but nothing of worth
That can repair the hurt, so out comes the tears and
In come the visions, gargoyles and gryphons
The tensions, the strength, and the stiff and release
On his way to God, guarded by the beast
She picks up his rifle and rushes to the street

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
With blood stains on the chinchilla fur
And a hundred bullet holes in the Rolls Royce Spur
Through designer sunglasses the world is a blur
Diamonds are being ripped from the neck of the third
Second and first seems so unneeded
But this one she feels that he got what he deserved
The money floats, the liquor spills
She dances on macabre; a nigga is being killed
Skeletons dance with her an elegant prance amidst the
Whores and the drunks, the sinners and the punks
A parliament of fools baptized in the funk
Cologne won't stop bullets no matter where you put it
But they spray it in the trunk
It mixes with the blood and the residue of drugs
It hits her all at once
Stings the nostrils, as our Rihanna as Madonna
And Nirvana bewitches another hostile

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
With blood stains on the maxi pad missing
We welcome another soul into the land of the living
Something about the mirror so different, it smiles
Now how could glass smile?
So she runs into the kitchen
The microwave, the spoons and the plates
Everywhere where there's a reflection of her face
The turned off TV, the cell phone and laptop screen be
Looking jubilant as Jeezy
In the trap or Gucci in the chain shop
A fan getting name dropped, this wasn't in the plans
But the pain stopped, and held the daffodils
Pleasant surprise not in the newspaper horoscope
A scene in the leaves of the chamomile
She musta missed it
Probably fell outta the bag but she dipped it
Nonetheless, she feels terrific

[Hook x2]
