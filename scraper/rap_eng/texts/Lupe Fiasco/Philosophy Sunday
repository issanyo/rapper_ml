[LP] #PhilosophySunday or pls tag your replies and tweets with #PS to keep things focused
[LP] A Marxist theory today:
Actual Revolution which affects wholesale societal change is only seen via technological advancement i.e. industrial
[LP] it suggests a negation of ideals as truly transformative and that true force behind changes across the board in society is technology
[TW] @LupeFiasco but doesn't it take an human idea to create a technological advancement?
[LP] Indeed But it can posed that the human idea is NOT the end product & w/o such material present the effects would be negated @egolessindigo
[TW] @LupeFiasco French Revolution Lu? As far as I know not any significant technological advances. Else you can educate me #ps
[LP] It can be argued that French Revolution was a failure. And not really a revolution at all. More Iike a civil war @epl82
[TW] @LupeFiasco history has shown that technological advancement is not necessary for revolution. Look at the revolutions in south America/Asia
[LP] What if 1 was 2 say "these revolutions were brought about in direct reaction 2 technological advances & would not hv otherwise @rebelde2012
[TW] @LupeFiasco Marx's theories indirectly killed millions of people, so I don't generally trust any of them #ps
[LP] “@DHoltThe1st: Marx's theories indirectly killed millions of people, so I don't generally trust any of them #ps”

Jesus's as well to argue
[LP] Yes Muhammad too and Buddah as well... @landolakes33 @DHoltThe1st
[TW] ah, so you're thinkin of revolution in the sense of a widescale change of thought and the ways we interact and see one another
[TW] the way an effective Actual Revolution manifests itself isn't purely industrial, it must be sparked by an organic idea #PS
[TW] @LupeFiasco @b_boor that's bullshit a change in society's mindset as a whole and less reliance on technology will start a revolution, #PS
[TW] @LupeFiasco ever read The Book of Daniel by Doctorow? Says revolution is a circle: overthrow power take the power but do the same as former
[TW] @LupeFiasco Foucault: "resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power." Technology moves ideology via accessibility.
[LP] But is tech really in the hands of masses? @Scottjm52 @Scott_Lahn
[LP] Hey guys #LF Mgmt here. Gotta love his lively way with twitter but sadly he's gonna be taking a break to focus on other things.
