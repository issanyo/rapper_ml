[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]

As I bug out and absorb this energy
Refer to my memories, the scenes of lines and rhymes
To put together for these times
Right of the top like suicide jumpers landed on your block
Ahhh...and do pauses like that and do ad-libs to stretch
To prefer that I'm the bestest more like a suggestion
But maybe it's the truth..still falling of the roof
Thought I was dead but didn't hit the ground
Call the police and hit the pound
It's not 911 on your dial-tone son
It's a write around with a smile infront
See I do it like my flow when I was in '92 when I was in school
When I was rapping like Ghostface Killah with a higher baritone
With a ghost chain wallet and a megaphone zone
It can't nobody stop when the dreads grown long
So I'mma keep it Marley and never sip barely
The beer be the poison the food and the liquor
And you watch study the moves of the niggas
From the back with the jungles on the tack
With mac tucked in with a strap bring it back
See I do it but I feel when it's done and then... you run
See I messed that up there but then the best up here
Tryin do that less up fear
And say... moving like a movement do
You and you, me and him, is me and him 2 & 2
4 and 4 math don’t work and the bath don't work so I wash up in the shower for an hour
But the rain storm brain form many lines many times
Any rhymes that I kick or I commit like a murderer
Service ya hit ya like a burglar
Cat when I'm sneaking through the back with ya purse
That's a man with lady bag maybe drag maybe fag
But more no less homo no zone goals deeper than mine when
I'm in time to climb to commit crimes
Every time I rhyme
The new york flow was kickin it
Chi town a second it so I'm like President Obama
When I'm ripping it maybe a terrorist maybe embarasses us
But never scareness us and everthing impareness
A pair of us is more, and better, and can’t no body stop, when I score
A sweater like a booster when I'm jumping
Got my polo on strong
And call me what I am like nas i'mma a don
So word to the homie in the hero never zero
And I move and I disappear representing like
Shapiro in court, you still might lose
I get punshed but I still don't bruise
Fly like that cat semi-automatic
Tac the raps I give daps to everybody, back in the day
But there's more the o.k when I'm flowing it
Every body tryna rock but I'm Chi-ca-goin in
Shout to common and Kanye West 2 times 2 rhymes
Funk Master Flex and 2 blessingness and I'm still Ramadan
My moma blind and everyone is dropping bombs
Booom and I still do it like nuclear warheads fore-heads is full of these lyrics
And spirits is spirtual and can no body stop the mathe of the attack
When the rap is so lyrical and then I bless up and yes up
And when I come through up you better put your vest up
Cuz chest shots ain't coming more like for the don
And I'm rapping like I'm going home like flowing on beats
And broken bones clits as I stick to your football track at attacking the rap pack
At exactment and can no body can stack to this
You can't stack up and back up
Rest in peace to my brother Esco as well as Stack Bundles
Far rock away king man we love you
See its something sinister and something so delivering
When I be kicking and spitting and ripping it
See that's a little Laissez-faire like I don't care
But I still rock like I'm the player of the year
So I shout to the best and I move you round like the nets to brooklyn
Shooking and can't no body stop me can't take 'em where I took it
And if you want more then just push it and i'll be there
Rocking kicking and hitting and spitting and ripping it down
And doing things and I might give you a pound
But if the phone don't ring don't be mad
Homie just be sad
Cuz you missing out
I'm giving out more knowledge
To drop it's like school and a college
And a university it's like two of me inside this
And rhyming with rhyming wits tryning dropping a dime in this
With a diamond glits rain black hammer keep it rolling
Around gold rolex and don't stama with the froid gased up and the lamborgini too
I'mma ride around stunning on you and your crew
So I bless you to do something
Never stepping for test that I might have to direct you cousin
An best beleive we had fun from all the top shouts to CL Smooth and homie Pete Rock

I was just warming up too it's like
The damager rolling in the Dodge Challenger
Pause he trackin' that, stamina and everything is bandaged up
Bandager
????????????????????
And hit you like damager get it all on camera
You worldstarhiphop-ing it pause and can't no-body
Stop when I evolve and I hit with you log from the forest I chopped down
You catch me on the blog me and funk master flex
And in flex we trust every body bless up yup
