We can have the world shining in stellar, stellar light
We can make our dreams brighter in stellar, stellar light
Crossing the sun together, we are the ones to make it
We can have the world shining in stellar, in stellar light

[Verse 1]
In the new better, Lu ether, Lu effort like two extras
Four actors, no rappers, hundred takes for a hundred keeps
I went a hundred straight for a hundred weeks
That's too real from a projector
Set trippin' 'em black kid and put a light beam on that white screen
Black sport, take that boy pay, that's oy vey but I take that
Make great rap, I can [Censored] then bake that and give you cake back
I felt like I Superman with his cape trapped
Then Lu perform in no uniform in my human form
And still super to 'em so you safe at
Mi casa es su casa, throw a ball where your base at
In the worst case, they at first base cause I threw a ball where they face at
And they don't want seconds, I was so sick that I threw up all where they plates at
If the money small, then we money ball, and put us all where first place at
Bless up

[Verse 2]
Energy, not friends
Those are just the enemies of my enemies
Violins, all inside my symphony
But I'm composed when I execute
Over drum rolls in the face of all these rim shots
I Sprewell, if my rim stops put a new spin on that movement
Did it for the streets, now I'm tryna do it for the museums
Good stated I ain't hood enough
Good cause the hood ain't good enough
I want whole worlds with soul girls that pose well at my parade
Celebrating before elevating to a destination tryna isolate
Activist or artist? Fuck with me cause I'm smart bitch
No fuck you, cause you aren't this and you should fuck with me cause I'm smart
Have smart kids all started on armpits
Then dearly depart from the part played and got the script started for part 6
Bless up

[Verse 3]
You play with it but I stay with it
That's the reason I stay with it
I live with it, did did it
Queen (?) gon' live with us
You 'bout that, then we real
We spill a lil Mountain Dew for E. Till
On the mountain top that we built
We will, that's it
Chiraq to the Brad Pitts
Foreign borders to the poorest corners of Port-Au-Prince
No preach, no beach, so sure
More schools, no war
No more, oh lord
Star light, it's your world go for it
Bless up
