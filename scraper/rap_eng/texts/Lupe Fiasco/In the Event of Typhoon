[Intro: Leila Z. Braimah-Mahamah]
Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay
Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds
Declare the typhoon's coming
Before it sweeps your decks, throw overboard
The dead and dying â€“ ne'er heed their chains
Hope, hope, fallacious hope!
Where is thy market now?
