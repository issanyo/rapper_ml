[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Now what if I told you my city was the best
And my city was a threat to the rest
And my city was a threat to the rest

[Refrain: Patrick Stump]
This city is my city
And I love it, yeah I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I’m gonna stay

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]
From every corner
To every block, yeah
Whether it’s warm or storming or downright stupid hot, hot
From the problems all the way to the solutions yeah
Forget all the drugs and gangs, corruption and pollution no

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
Cause this city is my city
And I love it, yeah I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I’m gonna stay here
For life, uh huh(x8)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now what if I told you my city was the best
And my city was a threat to the rest
But you can’t rest inside my city
My city’s so cold if you ain’t dressed
And what they accept, better had a right address
Come to my city, certain colours can’t step
And sadly I’m talking about the colour of your skin
Sorry my brother can’t let you in
Cause the property value might go down to a level that’s economically unacceptable
And socially taboo for us to live around you
Is this what it's down to?
Root for the same team, maybe have the same dream
Not the same reality
Actually, mine is a bad education and gentrification
Despite all the above I love

[Hook]

[Bridge: Patrick Stump]
You can take my picture
You can take my name
But you're never gonna take my city away
Cause you, you burn it to the ground
Oh, you let it flood
But it's in my blood

[Hook]
