Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit

[Verse 1: Boy Boss ALsamiri]
Black and white, white and black
Obama after bush like a shit after night
Everybody is running we wanna know what happened
We can't understand barak obama motherfucker
Obama is take a look round of the killing
Take from your life just one moment
Look out the situation and give me your comment
I'm talkin to you till me what you want
What's going, we wanna life good in the world
We waiting, what you can found in the round
When drop bombs in street people hide behind in the wood
If you have the gun we have our god
Why there still soldiers out there in Iraq
Why your drons there in sky iraq
We will win in the war and will drop your station
I don't like this motherfucker president (Obama Nation)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: M-1]
After you divorce yourself from the right wing
Propaganda campaign, it’s all simple and plain
America customed the game
Your President got an African name, now who you gonna blame?
When they drop them bombs out of them planes
Using depleted uranium, babies looking like two headed aliens
Follow the money trail it leads to the criminal
Ain’t nothing subliminal to it, that’s how they do it
See they game they run, give a fuck if he’s cunning
Articulate and handsome, Afghanistan held for ransom
By the hand of this black man, neo-colonial puppet
White power with a black face, he said fuck it i’ll do it
A master of disguise, expert at telling lies
Then they gave him a Nobel Peace Price
Should of known he was trained in Chicago
Word to Chairmen Freddy, Mark Clark
What they do in the dark will come out in the light
Like a WikiLeaks site
So I guess Nkrumah was right, who’s ready to fight?
Last stage of imperialism, I ain’t kiddin
In the immortal words of Marvin Gaye ‘This ain’t living’

I don’t, I don’t want no, Obama, Obama Nation

[Verse 3: Black The Ripper]
O-B-A-M-A
You ain’t fooling everyone, I see the games you play
You was V.I.P. at the B.I.C
And we know that’s code name for C.I.A
The same way your cameras are watching us, we’re watching you
Think we’re easy to control you ain’t got a clue
Revolutions on the way, let’s see what you're gonna do
You gonna send the troops? You gonna drop the nukes?
See it’s not where you’re from, it’s where you’re at
He’s sitting in the White House, so who cares if he’s black?
And why’s there still soldiers out there in Iraq?
Natural resources ain’t yours, its theirs, give it back!
You’re just another puppet but I’m not surprised
Look at Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice
They didn’t change shit, house nigga’s fresh off the slave ship
You’ll all burn in hell even Michelle, Obama Nation

[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]
I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, And a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of "what the fucks"
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homey, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I’m a part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful
And I believe in the people, yeah

[Verse 5: Lowkey]
Was the bigger threat from Osama or from Obama?
Military bases from Chagos to Okinawa
I say things that other rappers won’t say
Cause my mind never closed like Guantanamo Bay
Hope you didn’t build a statue or tattoo you arm
Cause the drones are still flying over Pashtunistan
Did he defend the war? No! He extended more
He even had the time to attempt a coup in Ecuador
Morales and Chavez, the state’s are on a hunt for ya
Military now stationed on bases in Columbia
Take a trip to the past and tell em I was right
Ask Ali Abunimah or Jeremiah Wright
Drones over Pakistan, Yemen and Libya
Is Obama the bomber getting ready for Syria?
First black president, the masses were hungry
But the same president just bombed an African country
