[Verse 1]
This your beat I'm sorry, but her eyes were so starry
I just had to get some-uhh...one up it
Hit the bricks, drop the coins, pick up the shit
Like a pooper scooper even dog shit was once eukanuba
Underdogs of the past can be the shit up in the future
I brush my shoulders off to remove my bazooka
What we doing? Deck full of spades, hold a mic like Bob Barker
It's manure if you new to the ways of the lupester
The base meaning is I'm a roofer, (woo!), I'm going like fuschia
All I need is a coup and a princess behind me like King Koopa
If a nigga with me and he black he might shoot ya
And that's motherfuckin real, even my mother, is fucking, real
Kitchen counter tapping then undercover skills
Your beat is in my bedroom giving head to 'em
Stretch it out, stand up in it and call it leg room
Beat the beat till it's beat there's eggs to 'em
Then repeat, eat it till it sleep, then wake it up
But then don't speak to it cause now it's like the feds to 'em
Beats having trouble going to sleep cause now I'm like Fred to 'em
And if I can be any meaner, our patina was Martin and Gina
To her I would have ran, but now she like Pam
She still want the flow but now I'm like damn
Whisk her away, but I had to scram back to the bullshit
Scramble to ya pulpits and tell the preacher he legit
Beats get weaker the deeper that I get
Damn right she ain't even get the shaft, I'm just speaking from the tip
When the fire gone then I quit, cellphone still along on the trip
So I can speak to the choir from the throne on my ship
And noble or sober or my song nobler
Eating with our hands and the waiter is a fan
Shout out to Mike Ferro keeping paper in my hands
Tailored Savile Row, or Mastermind Japan
Sky dropped six on the blazer
Drop top Aston versus Cobra, I'mma race ya
Free Rico, before he do his bid
Got a father tatted on him, gone show him where it is
Black dragon slayer they ain't knowing what he did
Want everybody in Bull city eating like a pig, lets do it!
