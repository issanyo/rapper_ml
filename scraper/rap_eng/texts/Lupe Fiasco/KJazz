[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
If you rolling around Los Angeles right now
This one right here is for you (keep it true)
And they say, and they say, and they say, and they say, now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Sunsets Los Angeles undressed like
The sky put on a skirt to hurt the slum sets
Then hit Hollywood boulevard like spars
Light taps that fight back, high heels covered in stars
Lounge gowns standing downtown up in W. Dubois'
Rolls Royce, Choice, the Hoist, and other comfortable cars
Shooting club doormans, speaking love of the warfare
What we're doing is ordering Ubers to Soho JoJo, everything is bizarre
Malibu and [?} sitting lonely in the Rolex when these Denny's mirage
In-N-Out bagels, Katsu your crab rolls, Easter laid food trucks, bossa nova mastros
Half-glued eyes on the night time wide search
Chanel purse gone down on the I-5 side
More holla hill shops, house party chill spots
Valley versus ills in the south central will shops
Saudi's versus Persians,  Hasidic temples [?]
Santa Monica helicopters and Compton KJazz

KJazz
[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]

If you see nighttime out there, tell her I said hello
Kjazz
