[Verse 1: Consequence]
The only dog from the kennel who made it up to Kimmel
And that's a symbol some will say is symbolic
Of the sentiment that we should have a seminar in college
Cause the way we take a term and turn it into paper
You could turn it in and tell 'em that's your term paper
Cause we been takin' paper on our own terms
The kind of paper that'd make 'em say, 'It's your turn'
But those turns'll take the 'hey' to a 'hooray'
And have you like Frank when his bird was in the fireplace
My mistake must've been punctuality
Cause fuckin' up some commas isn't everyone's reality
But fuck them other hitters, anyone I go to bat for
Is 'bout to have a Benz symbol on they dashboard
So watch who you pinch wit' them crab claws
Cause safe flight won't come to fix a glass jaw, it's the Cons, fool

[Hook]
Yeah, I make you count
That's why you hear me on the countdown
Cost so many bodies that it's gettin' hard to count now
I just keep countin', aw, yeah, as we count it all
I just keep countin' away
Yeah, I make you count
That's why you hear me on the countdown
Cost so many bodies that it's gettin' hard to count now
I just keep countin', aw, yeah, as we count it all
I just keep countin' away

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Out the door of the limo to make it up to Leno
And at a tempo, some would say it's Ben Wallace
The defensiveness of niggas who ain't never left the projects
Cause we can never trust, but we be havin' fun
But that's what happens when you hatch without a trust fund
So you trust the fundamentals that's your net worth
And only fund the trustworthy niggas in your network
Keep your eyes on the prize, watch 'em dilate
And hope the prize stare back at you like a fire escape
My mistake must've been my reality
Cause when you spittin' facts and turn saliva into salaries
Don't fuck wit' other spitters, but the ones that go to bat for us
Like the Benz got a bat symbol on the dashboard
Backballin' and the ones that turn to Shaq 4
Better sin safe like to fix the backboard, it's Lu', nigga

[Hook]
Yeah, I make you count
That's why you hear me on the countdown
Cost so many bodies that it's gettin' hard to count now
I just keep countin', aw, yeah, as we count it all
I just keep countin' away
Yeah, I make you count
That's why you hear me on the countdown
Cost so many bodies that it's gettin' hard to count now
I just keep countin', aw, yeah, as we count it all
I just keep countin' away

[Bridge: Chris Turner]
I just keep countin' cause I know we're number one
I just keep countin' cause I know we're number one
And I know when the summer comes
She gon' tell me, 'You're the one'

I just keep countin' cause I know we're number one
I just keep countin' cause I know we're number one
And I know when the summer's done
She gon' tell me, 'You're the one'
So I just keep countin' as I count it all
So I just keep countin' as I count it all

[Hook]
Yeah, I make you count
That's why you hear me on the countdown
Cost so many bodies that it's gettin' hard to count now
I just keep countin', aw, yeah, as we count it all
I just keep countin' away
Yeah, I make you count
That's why you hear me on the countdown
Cost so many bodies that it's gettin' hard to count now
I just keep countin', aw, yeah, as we count it all
I just keep countin' away
