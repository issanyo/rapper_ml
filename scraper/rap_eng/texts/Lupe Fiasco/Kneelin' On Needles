[Intro]
Wa-ves
You say waves, I say wa-ves
Kaepernick, waddup?
I knew they was gonna do that to you, but it's all good though
You gotta stand up for something, know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Gravitons, orbit around my halo space
Halo space
Little Debbie crumbs and potato flakes
Junkyard food meets 808s
Better say your grace, stay your place
Play your bass
And wait on a upright right up to them niggas that don't like us
Writer, fiber optics on high fiber
Move, quick like that
No Aiko ass, ain't shit like that
Magnum entendre, rollin' on a rubber
Hit Virgin for the album, I was floatin' on the cover
I pit my car, they let a lad in
I was floatin' on the cover, made a message out a mess
Got 'em clothes up the flow then taught 'em how to dress
Made a space so they can milk this way
Had 'em open up the udders
Broken off hat had folks in all colors
I wish a nigga would try and open y'all shutters
Cartier frames, Aoki on a shirt in the red and white chukkas
Why you goin' all hard though?
NASCAR star got bars by the carload
You know LF won to come out the top
But for this ten, I'ma just open up the car door
And my deepness
Might spit the stash box sequence that'll open up the cargo
If I break it down to you lil' homie, might get a nigga car towed
You ain't gotta worry 'bout ours though
DROGAS Light, DROGAS
And I might drop SKULLS as an art show
K-Dot want stretch marks?
I wanna own everything that's west of the best parts
K.R.I.T. everything from the legs down
Mickey Factz everything where the neck starts
Necklace, head, heart, go
Get set, mark, oh

[Chorus]
Turn the mics up
Like a nigga 'round fight club
And the fuzz came through to indict us
But it's an inside job to decrease the supply
Then turn around and drive all the price up
I be speaking it right
But it's hard to believe that people still believe
That Jesus is white, oh Lord
I be speaking it right
It's hard to believe that people still believe
That Jesus is white, all right
All right, oh Lord

[Verse 2]
But, I'm back to the mentally
And it’s not about natural ability
You would think that Kaep' took a shat
On the Statue of Liberty, goddamn
It’s like we trapped in a memory
Untrue facts where black is an injury
It makes me wanna snap just to slap me an enemy
Then go into the back and just rap to infinity
Fuck, be more like Chance
Solo acts be more like bands
Adversaries be more like fans
BDs and GDs be more like fam
I’m just vying for the summer
Women lie, men lie, and everybody lie about the numbers
Hard to be smart
When the only thing on your mind's dying from a thumper
I know I'm weird but nigga it's real
Better to hear it from a nigga like Lu
Before you hear it from a nigga like Trump
Talk to a nigga like you, oh Lord

[Chorus]
Turn the mics up
Like a nigga 'round fight club
And the fuzz came through to indict us
But it's an inside job to decrease the supply
Then turn around and drive all the price up
I be speaking it right
But it's hard to believe that people still believe
That Jesus is white, oh Lord
I be speaking it right
It's hard to believe that people still believe
That Jesus is white, all right
All right, oh Lord

[Outro]
Yeah, DROGAS, DROGAS, DROGAS, yeah
In stores now, uhh, and we going on tour too
Lu! Truly yours
Wa-ves on the way, it's genius!
Oh Lord, know what I'm talking about?
Izzy, waddup?!
