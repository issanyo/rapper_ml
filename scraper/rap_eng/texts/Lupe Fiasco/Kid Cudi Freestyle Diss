And I'mma give out every edition
And put out every mission
And make sure you hear everything that I say
And make sure that listen to every rhythm that I be spittin'
Unconditionally written
P.S to all my enemies you are now forgiven
Except Kid Cudi
Cause that's not my motherfuckin' buddy
If I see him in the streets it's getting motherfuckin' ugly
Now I know you might be a fan
And me and him share similar shit and you like "damn"
But that don't matter
We ain't gonna give nothing to the chatter
We gonna stick to what's at hand
I said "Did you heard that?"
They said "what?"
I said "You didn't heard the thing
About how they gave sixteen shots to McDonalds
While he was on the ground right outside of Burger King?"
They said "How could it?"
I said "You ain't see it?"
He said "Nah, they erased the footage"
Sounds like the motherfuckin' police
That's why sometimes to protect them kids
You gotta keep them pigs on a real short leash
But they protection, for your section
Make sure you have discretion, learn your lessons
Count your blessings, don't be no bitch
Don't be no hoe, but don't be out here stressing
You got a connection
Make sure you protected
Make sure you count your blessings
Make sure that you don't stress
Right, feel me Blake?
Blake you gotta keep shit straight
It's Blake, sometimes these niggas be fake
Blake, sometimes they say that they cold but really them niggas a cake
Blake, you feel me?
You gotta watch out, keep your grass cut low to watch out for the snakes
Blake and if you see they're vampires
And they man's a liar
Make sure you aim at their motherfuckin' heart with them stakes
You feel me Blake? Straight
Shit sound great
Superman flow I should have a motherfuckin' cape
I don't take hoes
Dog I give you my bitch and you can take her on a date
Just make sure you bring her ass back around eight
You feel that Blake?
Straight
I ain't even trying to top that shit
Blake, you know how to do it
Drop that shit
