[Verse 1]
Harsh, not for cuddlers, but for butcher knife jugglers
Jumpin' out of jets over jungles in search of jaguar jugulars
A paper bag is child's play, someone is mistaken
I practice rapping myself out of bear traps, a straight jackets like a vacation
But let's say it's a paper bag, and I'm hog tied and gagged
Handcuffed to safe then locked inside the trunk of a cab
Then the cab is driven to the river, set on fire
You know what skip the river lets say quick sand cause quicksand's thicker
Makes it harder to move, especially when the dynamite is being triggered
Oh that I forgot mention, we added a little TNT for a lil' extra tension
Then comes the explosion
A shower of pieces of cab, safe, sand, handcuffs and paperbag
The crowd stands silent, maybe a few gasp
Just when all hope is lost, and the crowd gets really sad
The smoke clears I appear with cucumber slices on my eyes enjoying my mudbath
Saying, "This all you niggas got for me?! Next time tie me up properly
Lu-Dini is unimpressed by this shoddily botched locksmith mockery!"
If I'm trapped in a paper bag just make sure it's a pen in it
Cause that bitch gone look like the roof of da Sistine Chapel when I'm finished
Paper Bags?! I'm the guy they use to rap the mouth holes in paper masks
A major task's for any one not trained in the art of hatin' trash
That's why I practice so fiendish
To make sure every little flicker of garbageness of my inner rap self is aggressively extinguished
It's what defines meanness, in a mean defined linguist
That leaves behind lines thick as linguini
Every time I string a stream of mean shit
Now that's a mean twist
Like a towel getting wringed by a man with a machine wrist
I'll give you back Hoffa but you gotta hand over the Teamstas!!!
So ends today's bars...enjoy your day...
