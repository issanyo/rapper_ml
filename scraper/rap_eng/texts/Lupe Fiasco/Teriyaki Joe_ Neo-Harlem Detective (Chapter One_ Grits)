Chapter One: Grits

Two more smacks should do it. She's weak. A couple more properly placed palms across the cheeks and she'll be all his.

She'll make good money for him too. Thick-legged, creole, tall...yeah she's a real winner. I give her two months. I give him three.

Two months before she wises up and figures out she'll be here forever and three months before she puts a knife in his chest for it.

That's Neo-Harlem for you. That slow burn then that inferno. And you either wood or fire...ain't no water just Gin to keep it goin.

Two slick punks gambling they heart out next to the scene. Couple cops shaking down some junky next to that. That's the view from the office

.45 on the desk. Digital cigar burning. Sun-Ra coming out the speakers. Antique Rick Ross poster on the wall. Man I miss hip-hop. Damn shame

Mental telephone on vibrate. Mostly getting lost dog calls these days. 10 million worth of Units in the wall safe. Nano-Eames couch for now.

Could really use some pussy. Real pussy not that robotic Kevlar jellyfish these ladies walking around with today. Fake pussy fake furniture.

The Sun-Ra reaches its crescendo just as I get a call worth answering. ---1 Million Units!!! Respond For Details--- Money first. I like that

POW! POW! The cops shot the junky. Streets gonna be alive tonight. Real alive.
I put on my jacket & head for the diner. I need some grits.
