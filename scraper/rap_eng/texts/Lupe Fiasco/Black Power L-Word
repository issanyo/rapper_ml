[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah-yeah, breakfast sketches, yeah?, yeah, alright, and they say, uh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Zombie, I need brains
Right on time like high speed trains
Pull up real slow like tai-chi cranes
That's an excellent Karate Kid reference
But I'm leave it there like negligence
To focus on the dead that I said in my very first testament
Re-animate it, (roll out) Roll-out mines, Frankenstein times Optimus Prime
Zorro bombing on cars how I write these names
Rail spike, snail life, I need change
That's transformers, ass warmers, ass styles for the wilin'
Frank Gallagher rubbing Valium on the mouths of the violent to make them silent
What a shame, taking on weight, and jumping on the plane
Lucille take it to the head, thumbs up to the mules, break another leg
Can Donald rob Mueller and shake another fed?
He'll probably weave by 'em, and wake up when we're dead
Dream team scheme to king Azizim
Don't sleep on that, that's a sword with 3 swings
Right across the chest, Mayweather your wig
Right across the left, rig weave
Have powwows and wigwams
Indeed, I spit freeze like Kal-El, only bow down for Islam
Back to the training, this mental bomb left Daniel-san hanging, haymakers for Al Haymin

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]
Back way when, I would say then, they would do it, when I say when

When go, left, no, (roll out) stay, L-Word: Lupe
