[Hook: Bruno Mars]
Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby
Nothin' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby
Nothin' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby

[Lupe Fiasco]
You already know where my heart be at
Tempo that my heart beat at, boom boom
That for you, for real, for truth
There's never been trivial pursuit
May look like a sedan man but I'm really just a coupe
Now that's two, so they can't fit, there's no room
And there's no roof, so there's no limitation
Limitless, since it's initiation
And to the crew, seed sown, then it grew
Was a pilot now we in syndication
And every time we show up this Pay-Per-View
Or the news, you're my satellite, that Youtube (tell 'er!)

[Hook]

[Lupe Fiasco]
On my microphone hustle, stay behind the bar
And I thought I could never be imprisoned
This the story of how you caught me slippin'
That's right, locked up abroad
You remain, they mirage, they collapse, we collage
We stick together like we starting fires
Thick as thieves, pick pockets at large
Kinda like lame miserab's
But we don't play, Broadway's for the stars
She's venus, and me's mars, so we like on a whole 'nother chart
Surreal, it's like a whole 'nother art
Hanging at the moment, and we got our names on the A-train cars
Like freedom meets cars, coming down banging knocking pictures off the walls

[Hook: Bruno Mars]

[Lupe Fiasco]
So what more? Further I could go into
But what for? We're already killing them
We're like Williams and Woods on tour
Now that's love above par, ooh
I just love to love ya'll, you're my power
My peace, my elegant flowers
No matter what the world is coming to
I take the rap, they got nothin' on…you

[Lupe Talking Over Hook]
Heh..you know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, temptation is a mother
But you're like none other
They can't compare
's why I'm here, you know?
It's like FOR-ever, that's like a long time (haha)
Yeah, the vibrations are very nice on this one
Lupe, let's go…PEACE!
