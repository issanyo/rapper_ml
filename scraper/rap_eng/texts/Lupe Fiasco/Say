[Intro: PJ]
(Making a song)
Hate that damn alarm
I’m putting on that uniform
Cause the boss be wilding out
All day, every day at work
So why, I mean why, should I go?

[Hook: PJ (Lupe Fiasco)]
But what does it mean when you’re stuck in the same place
As yesterday, it’s okay, it’s okay
Cause that’s what we all say, say, say
Say, fuck this job, I don’t wanna wake up
Wanna wake up, wanna wake up
My dude just called, said he wanna break up, wanna break up, wanna
But that’s what we all say, that’s what we all say
Momma I'mma do right, that’s why I'mma gonna straighten up gonna straighten up, gonna straighten up
It’s my year, I'mma get my cake up, get my cake up, get my
That’s what we all say, that’s what we all say
(Say, say, say, say)

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
Maybe if you say it like you mean it, mean this like you say it
Like you hate it, like you heated, heated like you hate it
Like your hate is a behemoth, and that’s big
And they ain’t seeing what you’re saying
Cause maybe you ain’t saying like you seen it
Say it like it’s crazy, nah, say it like it’s scenic
Or maybe saying’s not the way to make them mean it
A meaning’s what you make it
But that don’t mean they take it and believe it, ha
Got to do it to the torts
Drive-by’s like you’re shooting from the Buicks
Sidelines like they’re rooting for the losers
So they can get mad and start looting for my newest now

[Hook: PJ]
But what does it mean when you’re stuck in the same place
As yesterday, it’s okay, it’s okay
Cause that’s what we all say, say, say
Say, fuck this job, I don’t wanna wake up
Wanna wake up, wanna wake up
My dude just called, said he wanna break up, wanna break up, wanna
But that’s what we all say, that’s what we all say
Momma I'mma do right, that’s why I'mma gonna straighten up gonna straighten up, gonna straighten up
It’s my year, I'mma get my cake up, get my cake up, get my
That’s what we all say, that’s what we all say
