[Intro]
What they say, what they say, what they say now?
What they say, what they say now?
What they say, what they say now?
What they say, what they say now?
What they say, what they say now?
What they say now? Ooh, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
God on the screen, televangelist swing
A jacket made of faith waving grace
At the catchy song slapathon super chic
Runnin' 'round Tehran with Qurans in the cape
Base nuclear bombs, build their arms like a palm full of weights
'Til the flash of daylight spawns in our face
Collective capitalistic adventures of the angelly invested
You only entered this for the exits
Flow is European Union, beats is like Brexit
Was restless, now me and chillin' go together like Netflix
The boyfriends and girlfriends
Like Baltimore and Maryland, Dorothy and whirlwinds
Trump on acid, didn't mean to gas it
Pulled up to the pump with his trunks on backwards
Carreras, Testarossas, Superleggeras
Gaviria meets Guevara
White man made me
Born coldhearted like Iceman's baby
I can't lately that's why I chant daily
Warm soul artists hope Iceland saves me
The isolated geothermal screens
Warms the blood, Reykjavik's the scene
Two chains, one ring
No watch, lame
Trap
