[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
I get my hip-hop on
I get my hip-hop on
Allow me to get my hip-hop on
Allow me to get my hip-hop on

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Just a little story that I got to tell
About a boy named Lu and a girl named Chenelle
She from the ghetto, he is as well
He listens to The Neptunes, she Mr. Kells
So while his head was in the clouds
She was on the down-low, foul, more so
The '03 version of a virgin
Said she learned head from a porno (Word?)
Upbringing was worse than he
She from a broken home
One day broke father broke in home
Lookin' for a fix from brokenhearted momma
Choked and broke her bones
Now he dismayed
Cause he don't think things need to be that way
Now he at work, and she at play
And she get paid
But he don't think she could ever be that way

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will smack you down
Make you hit the road, don't come back around

You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will lay you low
Don't hate the playa, just the way it go

[Lupe Fiasco: Verse 2]
Now Lu's not your ordinary mild-mannered man
Who doesn't man up
Who just got caught with his pants down and his hands up
NAW
He's a dog, he's a playa he's a mack
Who preys on the weak and the meek and the quiet
Try to make 'em into freaks
Gets with the big girls with jobs
And tell 'em "[They] don't really need to diet,"
NO
Then it's free Micky D's for he
And it's three until she gets herself fired
"Sorry,"
LIAR, he don't care, he gon' say whatever she want hear
Whatever it takes
To get whatever he want or what he won't wear
Plaid
She think he won't dare
Creep with her friends when her ends end
Boo be prepared, cause he ain't scared

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will smack you down
Make you hit the road don't come back around

You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will lay you low
Don't hate the playa, just the way it go

[Lupe Fiasco: Verse 3]
No matter how much strength man
You think that your pimp hand has got
It pose no opposition to politicians
They so efficient in they tradition
They pimpin' is tops
School is a mack with a track
It's historical fact
Bring back the tax
Air Force One is a 'Lac
Bombs over Baghdad, johns in Iraq
Yes indeed, Democracy is a flirt in a miniskirt
Trying to give a handjob to the desert
Till it squirt Texas Tea
And give a condom to Congress to stretch the siege
Best believe, you'll catch disease
Siphyllus of the spirit
Arthritis of the knees
And you can watch on the idiot box
This NBC is like Spice, alright!

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will smack you down
Make you hit the road don't come back around

You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will lay you low
Don't hate the playa, just the way it go
