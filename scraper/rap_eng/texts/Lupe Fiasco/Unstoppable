[Intro]
...whole life for this, just to make it hot
(Ya'll never going to stop us)/
We worked our whole life for this, just to make it hot
(I've been doing this for a long time nigga)/
We worked our whole life for this, just to make it hot
(F I, A S, C O, listen...)

[Verse 1]
When you going to learn?
You're not breaking mine
Best change your mind like Frankenstein
From change to five to Franklin crime, I movement
I run with two chicks like I chamber nines
These playas praying that I gains a line
Or I slip into a gin popped frame of mind
Picture that, with this here, I'm solitary confined
You still behind my bars, commissaries reclined
Account's get low, and accounts get towed
Everything these niggas be about get flowed
These cats won't quit till a house gets sold
Jaws been thawed out, my mouths still froze
Niggas like women, but they don't love hoes
Cause if they get hit by them fourty-fours
They couldn't come back to life with soul to soul
Or Blige and kiss on the remix, I speaks it (nigga)

[Verse 2]
The kids and other crime that they trying to solve
Drop jewels like Ja Rule, no crying involved
Ya cool, How I do, don't even try it at all
Most rappers out there, can barely know me
Can only spit what I spit, with karaoke
Only person got what I got is my co-defendant
They like you, got to be kidding, no
No dependents, L-U-P, get it down from these holes to the ceilings
X5 driver, west side supplier
Grams from Nigeria, your hands from Siberia
Time is money, brisk by the hour, peace
Piece, bout' an hour at least, Why I
Wait by the minute, we count by the week
Cause when I turn the hands back, watch the cities turn black
No more V.I.P. or Champ.I.nin'
You can only get Do' when you can't be I.D
Listen nigga

[Intro Re-hash]

[Verse 3]
Niggas mad at son of Madison
Three o' fifty fo' for real
Where my dogs is still
Where we ducked police
Me, Huggy, Josh, J-Rock, Nick, E
County Reg, Quick, and Cocheese
Notice, where the first rhymes was wroted
First nine was holded
First dime was solded
I did it all, from the biggest to miniscule
Don't twist it who miss business to visit and get it charged
Set it dawg, aspirin, and Ty-le-nol, stitching on
Bandaging for your killing arm cause that feeling gone
I'mma spit it on, till we whipping with no ceilings on
Did ya's long sitting, from brisk it to Phillip Young
Sorry, it's going to be hours put in
To soup put on, box opened up and
Flowers put in, and I got some of them
Emergency room, cowards pushed in, listen
