[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
She said, there was no love in her heart
Cause one day, a rapist attacked her and broke that all apart
She said there was no way to fix it or to cover her scars
Then one day a guy came along that probably could help her start
He was sincere made her believe it was safe, for her to trust again

How could this be? I locked my doors
Kept my armies on my shore
And point my rockets at the sky
I'm so fortified
I built my wall so high
So why oh why are there?
