A real playa like hiphop game
You know I do my thing
A real playa like hiphop game

[Hook]
They like the way you tilt your hat yo
Yea, that's Phat Joe
They like the way you lay your mac yo
Man, that's Phat Joe
They like the way you kill a track yo
I'm saying, that's Phat Joe
They really like the way you rap yo
Yea, that's Phat Joe

[Verse 1]
First let me say, that I really like this track
I call it Phat Joe, this ain't no Fat Joe diss track
So, Lupe don't play like the disc scratch
I send trouble your way, like a dispatch
Hello, 911
Lupe's back and he took my gun
And then the gangastas
Saw all or none of that
The yakuzas took my thumbs
But now, I gots to get to runnin'
Cause the pigs is comin'
Like it's, troubles my way
Just a hustler's day, YOUNGIN'
Took it out the hood like Mr Drummonds
Then I put it on the hood of a 911 and
And that's really the back so
I put it on my back, and now I'm runnin'
Like I'm addicted to crack
And you can't catch a trackstar
Set don't phase me and I'm stunnin'
Ah

[Hook]
He crazy, he ain't got no brain
What up ladies, he ain't got no fame
He dropping mean, but he ain't got no name
Lupe, Chi-Chi-Chicago mayne

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, now if you're looking for Lu
You can find me in your city, looking for you
In Supreme looking for hoodies, in Daves looking for shoes
In LA I'm looking for Stussy, don't push me fool
I'm a push a man, don't get it while it's hot
You should wait till the cookies cool
I learned that from a pusha man, who used to push weight
But had to wait till his cookies cooled
Uh, an OG since OBGYN
Homie I had to go to rookie school
A nerd, so the bullies had it out for the kid
But they had to honor me like algebra trig
I used to go to sleep to the sounds of the seas
I used to count the lakes like the owl and a kid
They used to hate sending one bound for the bed
Retarded now, heading down for the kid
