[Intro]
Hold it now!
You just walk up to her and say hi
That's all you gotta do
Say hi
That's all you gotta do
Say hi

[Verse 1]
Well I know I'm not the coolest
And this might sound kind of foolish
Cause I know I'm not the smoothest, told myself I shouldn't do this
Cause I'm not very well-suited, not the popular-est of students
We ain't in the same crowd, always see you with the hoopers
But we got the same lunch, you might see me with the cooler
That's cause I don't eat pork, you can never be sure of
Oh you like Linkin Park, yhat's the hat from the tour
I got an autographed shirt they wrote, "much love 2 ya"
Man that's really funny how we like the same music
But I really love jazz, I was gonna play the tuba
I tried to join the band, they said I was really really bad
Didn't really make me sad, I'm used to being the loser
But you, I think you're super, so much, I had to pursue ya
I don't believe the things they say or the football teams rumors
The quarterback can't spell, I'm his after-school tutor
I just took a cue from Cupid but, now I think it's stupid
I'm-I'm sorry

And then I walked away
Thinkin' that she would never talk to me
Like what were you thinking bringing up the band
Would have got a better result
If would have just beat her up and ran
You shouldn't have worn your glasses
Take your shirt up out your pants
See now it's all over and you won't get another chance
Damn, I was so close to her, then I felt a hand on my shoulder

[Verse 2]
She said I know your not the coolest but I swear you are the cutest
And I know you played the tuba, I seen you at the recital
It takes a lot to get up there and embarrass yourself
But you shouldn't put down you should merit yourself
That just mean you not a punk, I like Thelonious Monk
He's the wallpaper on my computer
I love Final Fantasy, I hate first person shooters (me too)
"Meteora" was nice but I bought "Hybrid Theory" twice
Half of the cheerleading squad is in the stupor
The only reason I do it is
Cause my mother took state when she was a junior
And she want me to do the same so I'm like naw
I wanna be an oncologist and diagnose tumors
I gotta a pet parrot his name is mister tuna
My favorite food is fish, remember that for the future
My IM name is missluna you can hit me after six

How you feelin' right now
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Come Seymour we have things to do!
(how you feeling right now?)
And just like everything in life
Things grow, People grow
And people grow apart
It's like somethings were just never meant to be
You see... but... then again... maybe...
Some things are

[Verse 3]
You know today gonna be the coolest
And you know how far your school is
Know how dangerous the flu is, so button up your coat
And finish off your breakfast, you know how important fuel is
Food is to human as buoyancy's to boat
I knew this, everyday we gotta go through this
And I ask why you quote, cuz I'm your father Lucas
Pop, last night I was lookin over the futures
Commodities is felon, rental properties is sellin
The bio tech market share is at its hugest
I think we should ride this wave, we can't re-invent the Rubik's
Woah, we should of played her more music
Lucas, dear, why is your bookbag full of tulips

[Outro]
Umm, well Ma, you see there's this girl, you know
And I was thinking that I may walk to her, you know
Try and talk to her, discuss different things that were taught to her
And see what makes her tick
You know? You know Mama?
