(Verse 1:)
Pardon Darling ..If I Alarmed Ya
I Dont Mean To Bother You I Jus Wanna
Get You To Pause And Slow Ya Walk So
Maybe We Can Talk And I Can Try To Charm Ya
Just Trynna Find Out Who You Are
I Dont Mean To Come Off Like A Telemarketer
I Ain't No Hood No Crook No Robber I
Jus Wanna Pardon Youre Heart I Could Bother

(Bridge:)
(Sometimes) And Maybe I Could Call You Up (Sometimes)
And Maybe I Can Take You Out (Sometimes)
So Lets Exchange Digits And Later Arrange Visits
Either yo place or mine (Yea)
This A Different Type Of Commitment (Yea)
Im Talking Bout A True Friendship (Yea)
Someone I Can Depend On
To Be Down No Matter What
Let Me Know If You Wit It Cuz Gurl

(Chorus:)
It Would Be Fly If You Were B-U-D-D-Y
Dont Be Shy, Give It A Try I Could Be Yours And You Could Be Mine
I Can't Lie It Would Be Fly If You Were My B-U-D-D-Y
Dont Be Shy Give It A Try I Could Be Urs If You Could Be Mine

Sorry If I Come Off Disrespectful
But My Convo Is A Little Bit 2 Sexual
But Damn Its Incredible Be A More Flexible
Cuz The Context Some Text Is A Lil Special
But, But, Wait, Wait, Let Me Explain A Buddy Is A Equal Beneficial Arrangement
A Buddy Is A Buddy That Dont Be Complaining
Wit His Or Her Buddy And Da Buddy The Came Wit

(Bridge:)
(Sometimes) And Maybe I Could Call You Up (Sometimes)
And Maybe I Can Take You Out (Sometimes)
So Lets Exchange Digits And Later Arrange Visits
Either yo place or mine (Yea)
This A Different Type Of Commitment (Yea)
Im Talking Bout A True Friendship (Yea)
Someone I Can Depend On
To Be Down No Matter What
Let Me Know If You Wit It Cuz Gurl

(Chorus:)
It Would Be Fly If You Were B-U-D-D-Y
Dont Be Shy, Give It A Try I Could Be Yours And You Could Be Mine
I Can't Lie It Would Be Fly If You Were My B-U-D-D-Y
Dont Be Shy Give It A Try I Could Be Urs If You Could Be Mine

(Breakdown:)
Ooh Ooh Ohh Baby What Im Really Trynna Say Is (That)
The Defintion Of A Real Buddy Is ... (That)
She's That One That You Can Have Fun
And Ride Shotgun Through The City With Me
Together There's No Limit To What We Can Do
And Once We In It Gurl Its Just About Me And You
So Baby What U Say Dont Pass This By
Cuz If You Decide....

(Chorus: x2)
It Would Be Fly If You Were B-U-D-D-Y
Dont Be Shy, Give It A Try I Could Be Yours And You Could Be Mine
I Can't Lie It Would Be Fly If You Were My B-U-D-D-Y
Dont Be Shy Give It A Try I Could Be Urs If You Could Be Mine
