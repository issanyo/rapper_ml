[Hook: Gemini]
I don't know what they said to you but
But this the way that gangstas move
And get on down to this gangsta groove uh-huh
I don't know what they said to you but
But this the way that gangstas move
And get on down to this gangsta groove uh-huh

[Verse  1: Lupe Fiasco]
He don’t care, he gon’ put the freeze on the charm
See through them frames with the C’s on the arm
South beach, light breeze through the palms
Two or three dames, Nikes on the lawn
With, wrist watch, crown on the face
Big Glock, pound on the waist and
Him in drop, lines on the wheels
Him can’t stop, flying when I peel
With insects, dying on the grill
And French sweats, gliding to a still
In the drivers seat
Bout to make this jump Bounce like drier sheets
I don’t know what you been told but this how a rider speaks
This is how it comes out when I arrive in beat
I’m the focal point at play
When I come through all the old folks will point and say
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Well spoken when I spit
20 inch Daytons right well spoking when I whip
Everything I sit on, the game coupe’d up
Sunny where you gon sit the money too lizzong
It’s the chip flosser
Quick to piss off a
Chick who friends thought her
Pimp was gon’ alter
It will not falter
It’s the limp walker
Food and liq author
Mister slick talker
Just sit, click, you fixed to slip offa
Promise never to quit, flip, or get softer
It was just GC, I, and a roof
Now I gotta keep TV Guides in the coupe
Its over, once the shoes on surface
And I throw this game like lose on purpose
For the perch I never purchase purses
You’ll never get him you’ll never hit him, perfect

[Hook]

[Instrumental]

[Lupe Fiasco]
Bring it back!

[Outro: Gemini]
I don't know what you've been told but
This the way that gangstas move
Now gangstas come and gangsta go
I don't know what you've been told but
This the way that players roll
Players come and players go uh-huh
