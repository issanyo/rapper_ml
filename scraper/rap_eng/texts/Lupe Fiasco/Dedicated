[Verse 1]
Sometimes a niggas worth
Is measured by a niggas work
And if I delivered food
This nigga here would lose
But not with her....(whoo)
Though, sinner I be, winner I be to her
She ain't God, she don't judge
When it was hard she ain't budge
When winter my she simmer I be to fur
Brought me down when the temperature was down
Held me down when a nigga was down
Bought for, when I couldn't afford
But couldn't afford to leave the scene
Cause this mission here we couldn't abort
Yep, she help me bring FNF up
Therefore she's forever the "S" in the us
When I'm talking about "we" shes the "E."
She's the one to kidnap
When you want the rapper to plea

(Chorus)
I'm dedicating, dedicating, dedicating, dedicating
I'm Dedicated, this song to you lady!
*repeat 2x

[Verse 2]
You're forever my lady
Forever your baby
Been down since you made me
When I was in trouble like mayday
She would come and save me. (Uh!)
Five dollars on your pay-day
Went directly to little debbies,blueberry juices,cherry now or laters, and a PayDay
Made me feel same way, it' was crazy
It's not where you live
But, where your brain stay
Yeah, thats how she train me
Transferred that directly into my game, aye!
Let them old people sit down
Right now you ain't gotta pay
Stop trying to be grown
Cause your next stop might be gone
So with the home of my body being the ghetto
But my mind on the moon
I will soon be the man that I am today
My momma can cook, but barely can woop
Still had me shook. Hey!

(Chorus x2)

[Verse 3]
Uh, yeah!
Sometimes a women's worth
Is measured by a woman's church
And underneath her hijab
They path is not of this earth;
The street that they walk
They just trying to meet the boss
Homie that might not be looking good to you
But they ain't looking good for you
They looking good for thou
Who's the most good looking
'specially when they looking to
So me, and you homie they looking through
Them scarves don't cover no scars
They guard from the stare of ours
God willing, they can see the gardens
Sometimes concealing is hard
'specially when you're living in a place like ours
When those and the powers that be
Loathing their clothing**
You looking good in God shirt, God Shoes, God purse, God hoodie
Just keep God first, lady and keep rolling. Yeah!

(Chorus x2)
