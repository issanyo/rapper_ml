Give me models with semi-autos
And many Glock fo's in they Fendi ponchos
Kissimmee Saint Cloud condos
You want it pronto
You hit it on the head like congos
My entourage is
Like that of Malik el-Shabazz Hajj's
Those that choose not to dodge us
Bullet lodges
Like water buffalo better get
Hustler ettiquette
Move rocks like Frederick
And your dames I entertain
Like my first name Cederick
Like Max Julien how I max jewely them
Or any other chicken that listens for more than 40 seconds
Me and shorty steppin, left in the dust is the previous player who
Game wasn't up to par with thus such as ours
See thats where the jealousy starts, the ice grills begin and the weaponry sparks
So I'm forced to keep a gun up in the drawers and a, vest tight like a woman wit some balls
Pause... never
Niggas stall like public bathrooms
I move fast, while they assume
Positions I be splittin and gettin gone
They wanna take me off the wicker throne that I sit upon
Like Huey Newton but Luey shootin in Louis vutton, movie viewin, hoochie doin'
With a chick similar to Lucy Liu an' only Cuban
Transmittin, these ghetto laws like the transitions
See the heroin that my man siftin'
I move it to death
Like my hands spittin, from my lungs to my tounge to my gums to the guns that my hands liftin
Stay riffin Mercedez Benz sedan whippin
Extra heavy coppin, set up every block and buy out every bag of plastic wrap saran rippin
Nigga, nigga... yeeeah!

Now Julie ran a jewelry store had a friend named Gwen
Who had a Benz named Sin
223 4 burgundy the color currency her mother
Wore a lady mueller 17 carats maybe cooler
Navy maybe bluer say she pay 80 maybe fewer
Prada topper gucci shoer
Light skin 5'10" and slim and had something real shady to her
On the daily Julie tried to play me to her
Said that she can take me to a place in Aruba
Where they puff buddha from hookas while sippin cups of lewer
Steady frontin like she somethin how a hundred wasn't nothing to her
But through all the diamonds, Pradas last season I even trying to believe in
I think she lieing conniving deceiving she look like the type that like to mislead men
But I could be misreading miss taught never underestimate underspeculate even
She say she used to run with Steven, good nigga but hes no longer breathin'
You see I heard he used to mess with checks til he got it indirect
They shot him in his chest head left honking his van horn like the Nets
Cellphone in his cupholder, chrome in his gun holster
They got the drop on em put the full Fox and Glocks on em
Thought he was invincible, the pinnacle of tough guy material
Left his rocks on him ??buggets?? and ??secks?? thats invisible
Much like the ones I wear one eyed stare looking at her crazy yeah
I know about Aruba we got a crib on the coast
2 yachts barbeque chicken wings on the boats
Much white northern light to smoke and 13 to toast but
Thats for my niggas I never partake in the smoking marijuanas
Or the drinking of the liquors and I ain't got nothing for you
I'm nothing cordial, type send you to buy for you
Its just head in booth hide this mack in ya coupe stick these packs in ya boots
Take a stack off the loot and scoop, nigga nigga
