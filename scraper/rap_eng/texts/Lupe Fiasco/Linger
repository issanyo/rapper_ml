[Verse 1: Guy Sebastian]
I've been tryna lose you, baby
I'm getting kinda used to failing every try
I guess we both refuse to face it
Neither one of us will ever change our stripes

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Why are we dancing now that the party's over?
Why are we running now that the race is done?
Yeah, we try to let it go, but there's no way we can control it
If we can't pull the trigger, then baby let this linger
Linger
On and on, on and on, on and on
(Linger)
On and on, on and on, on and on

[Verse 2: Guy Sebastian]
So I keep the fire burning
But I'm wondering why I still can feel the cold
And I squeeze, I squeeze as hard as I can
Hoping I will get some blood out of this stone

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Why are we dancing now that the party's over?
Why are we running now that the race is done?
Yeah, we try to let it go, but there's no way we can control it
If we can't pull the trigger, then baby let this linger
Linger
On and on, on and on, on and on
Let this linger (Linger)
On and on, on and on, on and on

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, we'll make it last 'til the last one
Each release is just a lease that repeats the past one
Song that never ends, that was Lamb Chop
Exodus, but the sex in us is a welcome mat back to Jamrock
So even when the band stops
Guitar still playin' even though the hand's not
And all of this amounts to poltergeists and haunted houses so
Even when we die, we'll still be alive

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Tell me, why are we dancing now that the party's over?
Why are we running now that the race is done?
Yeah, we try to let it go, but there's no way we can control it
If we can't pull the trigger, then baby let this linger
So tell me why are we dancing now that the party's over?
And why are we running now that the race is done?
Yeah, we try to let it go, but there's no way we can control it
If we can't pull the trigger, then baby let this linger
Let this linger (Linger)
On and on, on and on, on and on
Let this linger (Linger)
On and on, on and on, on and on (Linger)
On and on, on and on, on and on (Just can't let you go)
On and on, on and on, on and on
(You already know, yes, better, uh-huh)
