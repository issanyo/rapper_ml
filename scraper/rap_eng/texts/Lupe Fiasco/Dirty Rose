[Lupe Fiasco]
Specifically designed for you to go very crazy
Emperor, similar, the Rosemary's baby
Flow is that, took it there
Roll it back, temperature polar caps
I'm the Autobahn you're a cul-de-sac
I'm an Autobot put my money where my motor at
Also put some fire there too and then I flow with that
Opposite as I can get they said I never could
I'm an optimist, I'm Optimus speaking from the hood
Lupe, me will not care what you say
1st and 15th focused Dirty Roses by the bouquet
In my early 80's sports car bumping New Wave
Traditionary T-Shirt and the hat of LL Cool J
Rakim's chains
Watch and rings
Punk-rock rapper, HR's brains
Yeah I got that PMA all up in my DNA
Never seen a better thing, L-U-P and Sarah Green
