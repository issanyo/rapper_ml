[Lupe Fiasco]:
Hope his belly fills but it never does
That’s 'cos he at war with fudge
Yeah he at war with fudge

[Guy Sebastian]:
Those cookie jars
That Wippa keeps raiding
Don't look like he'll ever fade away
Has anyone checked how much he weighs
Those cookies

[Lupe Fiasco]:
There's not a lot of room inside of you and me
But Wippa he can fit maybe like two or three (his fat arse)
Or couple honey cookies, nothing sugar free
Look inside his kitchen man
It's like he on a cooking spree

[Fitzy]:
Even Lupe thinks you've had enough
Astounded by four massive gut
And he was just like 'woah' (hang on)
Another hot chicken hero on your way home
Filling up your ice-cream cone
There's another Toblerone

[Wippa]:
Have a look at what you blokes have done
If you give a man a snack he's gonna take a ton
I'm eating for Australia, I ask who's side you're on
Guy, here's the mic, I need to smash a custard bun

[Guy Sebastian]:
You always have a look, then it's just too much
I've seen him eat a carrot but it's covered in fudge
He'll settle down for junk food 'cos it feels better
But that's the only reason he can't fit into his sweater
He's eating for the best, the best we've ever had
He'll never leave a buffet without a doggy bag
It'll never be over until you tell him it's closing

Those cookie jars
That Wippa keeps raiding
Don't look like he'll ever fade away
Has anyone checked how much he weighs
Those cookies

[Wippa]:
(woa, can we just stop it there, I don't know why I joined in
It's just disappointing you guys are laughing at the fat guy
That’s hungry all the time)

[Fitzy]:
(Tell Lupe what you had for breakfast, lunch and tea the other day)

[Wippa]:
(Coco-pops)

[Lupe Fiasco]:
(so odd, I don’t think that we should talk about it)

[Wippa]:
(Yea righto, Guy Sebastian and Lupe Fiasco, thanks team, what do we owe you for the session?)

[Lupe Fiasco]:
(Yea that's right, fees, I need two hundred thousand dollars)

[Guy Sebastian]:
(Sweet)
