[intro]
Mic, What up man
I told you man
Im feeling real happy to be from chicago

[verse]

And since im presently on the incline
I feel inclined to invite yall
In the mind im feelin real spiffy
Signed sealed illest label deal in the city
Check me and my fifty dollar fifty-nine fifty
Buyin diamonds is just no longer in me
So no more chains flooded watches on the right
Hand
I work like a Mexican spend like a white man
That's right man I could Bentley afford
Instead I coped a couple skateboards and
Some sneakers my kick game is crazy
Keep a french eyeglass a backstage pass and a
Model for a lady
Charlia stop winein I got a bottle ya babies
Don't get gassed up on what ya pomp-pomp [?]
Think
Cuz the heart still dark as my Bloncic ink [?]
But the real OG'S told me fall on back
You got a secret service now you call on that
If that ain't real mane I fall on tacks
Im feelin real good
I think I might post in here
And hold the westside down like itz a coast
This year
Bishop G they told me I should come down cousin
But I flatly refuse I ain't dumb down nuffin
Like BOW
Lovin the Chi right now
Comm Sense the Priest
Bump Jay ta chief
Kanye the champ
Twista man the Beast
Crucial still the king
Kato[?] rest in peace
And for those that ain't never met I
I own 1st and 15th im Lupe the Jedi
Jay don't mind me im just blowin my zone up
Doin it bout as fly as a maggot grown up
And still got a life that's back in the palms up
Just give me a foldin chair I ain't after the
Throne but
Got a broken left flow that ain't no body ain't touch
Just sayin if FnF ain't up
Friend naw
This ain't a pen this a paint brush and I intend to rearrange how they paint us
And...
