[Intro]
Walk right, walk right in
Walk right, walk right in
Walk right, walk right in
Walk right, walk right in

Walk into the sunset, tell me if you wanna go
Speedin', speedin’
Ain't no slowing down
Tell me if you wanna roll
Speedin’, speedin’

[Verse 1: Sway]
I was telling everybody up your speed
That was a couple of years ago
And now I’m revving up for Deliverance
Switching up gears, got a couple of years to go
(Super swah!)
Here we go! As soon as you hear that, go
Liverpool to Portsmouth, yeah
That chorus got the crowd screaming

[Hook]
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
I got the people screaming
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
(Still Speedin’)

[Verse 2: Sway]
Click, click, hear the strap
Seat belt Derek’s back!
Time to blow like I’m Dynamo
No more disappearing act
I know you miss me, I miss you too
Sometimes that’s what a mist will do
Like Taio I was cruising
Now it’s time to take my steering back
One of the best to ever do it
(They say!)
A testament to this game
(They say!)
And even in the wind I never blew it
(They say!)
I swayed but kept in my lane
They call me Fleetwood mac
I’m a mack with a fleet
Still getting royalties
No spoiler but I spoil me!
I got the crowd screaming

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
With a gas tank full of tear drops
Collected over the years, what I use to fuel this here drop
I’m so high, everytime I drive my ears pop
Clutch full of victory, never let it slip through my gearbox
Now convert that drop into a rise
Look into my headlights, might go blind looking in my eyes
Lu is Lewis; Hamilton channeling up on this track
If you ever lost it or ever feel exhausted
There’s always one formula to bring it back!
(Vrrooomm...)
Sway and ‘pe, go together like A and K
4 and 7, trigger, finger
Put it in the air and make it spray (Wrraaahhh!!!)
Kick it like a hotspur get it, Tottenham’s ashes
Not about cricket, strapped, we bash their brains in

[Verse 4: Sway]
Pedal to the metal on a level I ain’t gonna settle
For anything less than gold
I ain’t gonna meddle around about
End up down and out
Tryna build since I was little kid, I never had the Lego
Running through the fields and the meadows of Ally Pally
And now I’m a hill with Geppetto
Was enough to make a fake boy real!
I can definitely make a real boy hard as steel!
I ain’t gonna stop until I do a couple of million
I gave them my demo, now it’s time to deal again!
I’m back up on the bill again
I’m fresh from the bank
Bob’s your uncle
Mines uncle Phil again
Because I’ve got the will power and the potential
And I got the credentials
All of the essentials when it gets stressful
My bp rises but I’m never gonna stop
Unless I need to get petrol
(Swah!)
Still speeding’!
