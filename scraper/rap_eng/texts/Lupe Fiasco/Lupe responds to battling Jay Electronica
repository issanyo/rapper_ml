Coexist
The devils in the dealer,the poltergeist is in the pokerchips
Game changer, I practice Iron Swan Song, Tiger Palm & Cobra Fist
Go by many slang name's and sobriquets
Asking me how many lines is in my mind
Is like asking how many fish can the ocean fit
I set out to do the impossible like an open fist,
Achieve the unbelievable like throwing Open Pit
The last line refers to flying saucers
A rhyming Chaucer who came from District 9 but now he's flying over it
Battle Jay Elect? Who has the foolhardy audacity to utter this?
I look at him like a high minded brother from another and when we finally encounter
With dual flows overdosed on over-the-counter's
Its gone be like Mulder meets the Mothership
Friend Of The People, Fuck the government...
