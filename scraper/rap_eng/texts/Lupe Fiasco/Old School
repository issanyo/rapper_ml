[Verse 1]
This is well proven fact man
Laser beams on top of mats and
Faded jeans and El Rukn hats man
Gangsta scene failed moving pack yeah
But you can tell that I failed shootin' that man
You see I excelled moving that kinda
Hard to explain where you and L-U at man
Smooth criminals, cats pushing ki's, gangsta leans
Flipping quarters, drive through giving orders
But ya'll don't understand me it's like
Bravo Pagering, breakin' balls, puttin'
Blows in the faces of the fiends
I was peepin' through the cracks, yeah
Niggas tryna stab 'em in they back, runnin'
Game on the dames, they stay strapped make you
Part of the war, this is...

[Verse 2]
You see, Little Rascal but I was Otay
Any could relate to any, even though she ain't
Have a family, life had a few hard knocks but I
Turned out okay, tryin' to write this in my own
Mind, yeah, but I'm no Jay, now, It Was Written
Couldn't justify why no Timberlake, I, mind your
Own business don't deliberate mine, went from
Refrigerate to incinerate fly of the inner state
If you wanna go berserk, put you/picture on a T-Shirt
Will commemorate dye/die, if thee wanna test we like
Yes and Parri(???), see, sigh, been that way since
I was waist high, product of television, Nintendo
And the inner city/Windy City(???) lookin' out my
Project window, symphony/simply(???) I...

[Verse 3]
Now let me pick up where I left off, I slicker
Than KY, then I started I grow, got hip, started
To know, same time learned gang signs, made rhymes
Started to flow, facial hair started to grow
Started a fro, but I couldn't take home in it so
I parted it low, I started talkin' to hoes, wanted
To dress fresh so I gotta walk for the dough
But the road that I took for dimes was full of bumps
Like books for the blinds, full of chumps, full of crooks
Full of crime, the remained full of sharks
Full of good for the gram(???), and that there right to it
A heart full of grime(???), whole episode left me
Marked into mine, I had to make a change like March
Of The Dimes, stop, change channels like channel locks(???)
