Cameraman and spectators: "Nerdy Chris, what it go, how it go? How it go Nerdy Chris?" "Let's go Nerdy Chris"
Chris Brown: "Ok, line for line"
Lupe Fiasco: "Why you gotta a singer on a rapper?"
Chris Brown: "It's breezy, Grandma on shwayze"
[Chris points to Lupe to start freestyling]


[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, yeah, Get my flavor flav on
A clock on my chest, No Glock on my hip
Got rims on my whip, the rims on my whip
Got Tims on my feet, Never
Too clever forever, for any MC
I'll will beat any competitor
Rippin to live and hold it down
Man, Christopher Brown



[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm in the town, I'm flickin-flickin flows
But I don't care about which any meany-miny-ho
I want to get to know
I'm trying to get the diddy
So I can take the teleo, and do the show
I rock, I rap, I rickity-diggity-ickity rap
But I do my own thing, and he's still a mack



[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And the sniggy-sniggy snap, and we live in the Chi
And we do it from the bottom to the top
To the tippy on my tippy-toes
Many flows spittin
When I rip into conditions, it's critical
When I be flippin, spittin introductions
Everybody's bustin, No we still hustlin
No need for introduction, percussions
Concussion you will receive when you leave
From me like Christopher Reeve
