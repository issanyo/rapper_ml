[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Locker room they getting ready, all jury called, getting heavy
Fish nets and them high heels, we team Louis, we team Gucci
No Pelle, all Bentley's, no Chevy's, all titties
No bellies, all yella's, black tats and they ass clapping
Looking deadly and that pole clean, stage name and a nose ring
Shoeboxes like four weeks from four blocks, bring the whole thing
Basketball money is so long, rap money only lasts four songs
Dope money, still a king here and they cornered us so they go home
Killers lurk and they chillin', camera man, he feel me
Feeling good, I'm feeling, my mama watch my children
Security know that we dealing, lights all in that ceiling
DJ let them hoes know, dope money in the building

[Hook: Gizzle & Lupe Fiasco]
They ain't really out here getting paid
But these niggas out here rapping my life
I been in the trap all day but your hoes be on the back all night
Dope money in the building, dope money in the building
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope money in the building
Dope money in the building, dope money in the building
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope money in the building
Dope money in the building

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now rap boy come show respect to that lifestyle that he rap 'bout
Basketball player don't know it yet but that car came from that trap house
That platinum card mean good credit, but street credit don't max out
A elegant little strip tease, and when you ask some tricks they lapse out
Bentley trunk in that raffle, call the troops and let the city shine
Send a bottle to my rival and then we send a bottle back over to mine
She super loose, she super fine, doing loopty-loops in those pole climbs
And rap come through get a song drop, and the real shit play, all the way
Them hood girls know the whole rhyme, connect here and we chilling
D.A. they filming, I ain't going cause I'm brilliant
Kilo, quarter million, no free throws, no spinach
Such a feeling when it's dope money in the building

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
It's so sick, you can feel the presence when you here
Basketball player 'bout to fall in love with that little girl
But that's her job, head over here
Do it, don't interfere with these lights and music help engineer
These money motivated romances that a pay your rent for like a whole year
What you thought it was lil' nigga, what you thought was the goal here
Devil all up in this bitch, that's why I ain't bring my soul here
My partner happy on parole here, I stand up and get a cold stare
Byproduct of them drug times, if we leave then the club dies
Girls don't want us going nowhere, coat check cause it's cold here
Girls don't want us going nowhere, coat check cause it's cold here
Now they gotta just kick it with the lames
And maybe pop it for some tickets to the game
Damn, drogas
