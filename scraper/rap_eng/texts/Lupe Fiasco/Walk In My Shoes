I just wanna live my life because I wanna, and I need to
So don't be trying to steal my light because you don't
Know me, don't pretend to
I've been busy on my grind, just like you, I've been trying
I've even shed a tear or two, I swear to you, I ain't lying

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel the world is after me
Trying to get to me, trying to stop what I do
Because I'm the only one that looks out for me
Can be me and walk in my shoes
Everday there's something that's new to me
I just, gotta breathe, I don't, know about you
But I'm the only one that looks out for me
Can be me, and... walk in my shoes
It ain't easy being Emily
But I don't want to change my name
Because I ain't got to, and I don't need to
So I'm a do what I do, because I ain't gotta live for you
But I'm a keep up with mine, keep on striving and surviving no

[Repeat Chorus]
See everybodys got their own problems that their going through
I take it day by day, it's only thing that I can do
So I live for me as you live for you
But you can't be me unless you walk in my shoes

[Chorus x2]
Walk walk, walk walk, walk walk - walk in my shoes [x 2]
