There's so many things to say right now; I got so much on my mind
Look at what is going down... How much higher can we climb?
The system that we're living in depends on poverty and greed
But people don't need charity; it's justice that we need

(There's disrepair) Hey, it's surrounding you And it's worse than it's ever been
(We'll overcome) We'll overcome the things they do
(We're halfway there) cause we know the truth but living is another thing
(We'll overcome) Overcome the things they do.. Lift your voice and sing

[Hook:]
A change is coming our way
Step by step and day by day
We'll live by all that we say
Step by step now come what may

There's war all around the world In the name of democracy
Can't tell the rouge from the just When they bring hypocrisy
I see my sisters on the move; making sure we all contend
Must've lost something on the way; we reduced ourselves again

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Before we go forth We gotta take 'em back, back
So we can know what we did
Cause if we never know what happened in de past
Then we can never know, that's what it is
If we don't do it for us We gotta do it for our kids, kids
So they don't gotta re-live
See, there's so much happening, it ain't gonna get fix
With singing and rapping and we gotta take action
And turn that preach into practicing
Cause what happen back then, will be right back again
But each one teach one, cause we only as fast
As the last one straggling, so help 'em out

(Step by step day by day) Said it won't be long, it won't be long
(Step by step come what may) I feel it coming on strong
(Step by step day by day) We gonna overcome
(Step by step come what may) As long as we are one
