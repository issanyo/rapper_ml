Say word to the nigga that took the rap for me
Free Chill I will, take rap to where niggas can't conceive
To the point where niggas can't agree on which song is best
And the argument is if I am better than me
Nope, me and school never agreed
So you can see that Lu never degreed
No fool but the promises of America's educational system
Were insufficient enough to convince him
I'd rather take my chances
And hope it's not enough evidence for a conviction (Breathe)
I push ki like Dragonball Z
You see what I'm sayin'
I'm tryna give you a piece of my mind like Hannibal G
And in the midst of it all make paper like tree
On second thought, make paper like mead
It's all in my notebooks
I hang like coat hook 'round gangbang and those who coke push like Tyrese
(My economy) Lemme make it real for you
The roots to my income is somethin'
To those opposed to hustlin'
"Is it solely music?" They question
Till I am embalmed
The end will retire in prom
L.U.P.Empire, F n F productions it's nothin'
Nigga please
