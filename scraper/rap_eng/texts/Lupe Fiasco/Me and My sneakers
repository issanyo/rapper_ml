[Hook: x2]
My sneakers more cleaner than yours more meaner more cleaner
Than yours I got it mastered and my car go faster 85 an hour I'm
About to take them backwards

[Verse 1:]
Yea now that's back to the esscence the freshest
Prince that's in your presence the uniform on backwards
The f and f eleven it's a laster went from a thrower to a crasher
(ooh) now while that's flowing right past ya let me take a second
To add up all the factors a-trak on the track and lupe is the rapper
Man about town crown member or swagger supreme world attention
Getting glistened and forever resistance to anything non pimping
Or wacker I'm much flyer united I'm N.A.S.A, I'm much higher not a puffer
I'm a passer not a rusher or a tackler I ain't gotta cuff her or
Tag her like I'm a graffer or harraser I grind should be on the cover of Thrasher
Chilling with the cover of king, Nah'mean?

[Hook 1: x2]
My sneakers more cleaner than yours more meaner more cleaner
Than yours I got it mastered and my car go faster 85 an hour I'm
About to take them backwards

[Hook 2: x2]
But take a second you need to breathe
Gimme a minute I need to breathe
Excuse me man I can't see cause you in my way

[Verse 2:]
So I'm on it like I own it, it sounds like it don it
I do and do to the fact that I'm that I'm the one to they oppenent
But they don't want it turn this flyness into bird flue and serve you
A nice pot of bird stew I'm breaking down my bread like I'm making bird
Food and I be in the stu like I'm a bird to but I just fly like a bird do I doo doo
On the birds man I'm high enough to do though I'm sitting on the wires admiring
The view I can still relate to the tires and the shoes dropping shows for they soul
Passions for they inner tools and I run flat while your running your trap I come
Through take your chedder take your fedder and the blue then leave behind a
Letter I'm adressing it to you, you need to build it better for the veterans salute cause
