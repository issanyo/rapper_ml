[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Busy, the A and R
Lupe, Chi town, nigga
Yeah, FnF up

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Busy let's see what this inspire
From begin to the end I intend my entire tenure to be fire
And then start stealin', when I'm fittin' to be fired
I intend to go as quiet as an entire choir
Singing higher than a man walkin' on a wire
Electric lines I'm six wires higher
Can't hang sneakers from me, I'm doin' my thing
And you can't see the money Mister McGuire
But you can see the rider on his spit fire tires
R.K.F. attired I recruit in this game
1st and 15th
Long for FnF out shooting at the snakes like leather neck man
Uh a ghetto boy that got etiquette, and
You got the game messed up gotta press reset man
Or you can just ask for me and ill put you up on it like channel 3
In some shanghai dunks in a camo tee
Step stuttered like ca-ca-ca Crambone g, it was mean especially if I'm looking for a string
Hardly ever seen
I was on the creep joe
MCs ain't see me like I was hear no and speak no
Momma said I was special but theres only one eye like a peek hole
But if I poke like moe you can't peep joe
My people start calling me neo I said nah
Now its growing on me like creep show
Haters want to put x’s in my eyes like cars
But before
I let it happen I go back before the action happen with factions
That want to make a model out I
Pull up in the coupe
And get the drop up on your troops
Me and my homies in the booth mister marty mcfly fly
Hardy Har my army and I
Burn like Dame pouring a bottle on a model
And got some mami in the eye
To my peeps marty
Benitan
My army
My mommy and my guys peace
