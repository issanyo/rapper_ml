[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't feared so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by the W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided
Little black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as a old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Quran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where FOX News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins Mandela peace prize

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Martin luther had a dream got a movie in my head and it's
So repetative so I think that it's time to tell em it
Who's ahead of it bun b would be the president
Cause all us texas boys id do it bigger than they ever did
Not so competitive nobody would be your nemesis
Ain't no devilish sinners doing what the devil did
A muslim sits at a coffee table with the methadist
Listen to method man talking tell em what the method is
Can do it effordless he would be who your professor is
Mr ice cubes who we use to watch the defacites
Just a brief case wouldn't have ta wear a vest with it
Saving in your cheque and bank account wouldn't be so decilate
And what's a pessimist every person would be gettin chips
Wayne and sean carter would be 2 people you would never diss
To make a living strippers wouldn't have to show there nakedness
They would make 6 figures just to serve a plate of beverages
Lil kim in the lab mixin like a chemist did
Nicki minaj she the potion tell her that she messed with it
No fighting with a record label to get levarage
Gucci mane would be the c.e.o and talk with eliquence
Just like elephants everybodies pockets hella thick
Koopa wonders this but for now well say it's tenative
Reality shows stars always show intelligence
And nobody would have to beef because we all be gettin rich

I know this this type of dream seems like a stretch
But everyone of us would be the best
With plenty of money
Yea everyone of us would see the change
And we would never have to worry bout dealing with stress
Cause really none of us would be depressed
We would do what we wanted
Ya couldn't tell me that that wouldn't be freshhhh

[Hook:]

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy I cordially invite you to
Ask why can't it be?
Now we can do nothing bout the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make fast or we can make it last
Every woman Queenin' and every man a Kingin'
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til it's all black every-THING

[Hook]
