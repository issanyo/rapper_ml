[Hook]
My heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust
Err'Day in the street my heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust
Err'Day in the street my heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust

I'm a pimped out nigga that walk with canes
Talk with slang, who ball from New York to Spain

[Verse 1]
Here's the issues, pistols next to what I piss through
I speak, get it clear like lalique crystals
Keep a vigil, your peeps want me to sleep where the fish do
So when I sleep I keep my eyes open like a fish do
So official, he's a gift too, give to them who ah
Wanna see me in hell like breathin' in
With nines to blow my mind like Eve and Gwen
Don't speak to him, he get offended by words
And send in them birds to get him disturbed
While they got in their cars and protectin' their pockets like
Revenge of The Nerd, ob-serve, games I play no like
Injured ankle, pulled hamstring glass half empty but full canteen
They always wanna rub you off when you lamping but...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's the young capital, L-U from the Avenue
Brush natural(???) in suttin' plus casual
Lay a mac to get the mackerel(???), hush mad atchu
Plus bullet stack crush clavicle and other bones
Run up in ya mother homes, still in the office hustle on
I got the forte of a young Boston Jorge who want horse play?
Thorough Breds wit colt 45's in a Porsche
Bring it to your doorway, we all from the streets
But you do it the Broadway, you know? The kid handle who
Toys better, you better play right like Andrew Lloyd Webber
Never, change when I'm back at the source
Niggas chains in the back of the Source
So I gotta watch for that rob report, rock watches out the Robb Report
And cop copper out the cop revolver

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This the nigga that, push lambs in brook-land
Party with thieves, keep geneves at inner in the sleeve
And cook grams, you wanna see me oxed up, propped up
Judge cotched up over my cases, me and K Swiss, please
Small drop for the races, rocks for the bracelets
Glocks for the waist, you ain't want what I pulled out
The dressing draw, get pulled out like dresser draws
Now undress till you draw, raw salmonella, 40 cal. Carrera
Excel-or, right on top like umbrella, wait young fella
Hold your horses like Trojan forces, of course this is
Scarriets (???), ya'll sweet like chariots, I move work
Like Marriotts(???), still pimpin', hustlin' in the same
Clothes like the Simpsons, niggas keep your distance

[Hook 2x]
