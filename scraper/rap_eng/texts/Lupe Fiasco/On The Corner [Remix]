You see it ain't safe pumping weight,  it's trouble
So they gotta turn to muscle,  like they pumpin weights
Cuz it ain't soft in the turnbuckle, you could get jacked like a pumpkin face
Catch a sleepy hollow, or poke ya head pumping weight
'Specially if you woofin- pumping base
Or you doing dirt looking clean
It could jump off like The Ultimate Warrior- what you laying on the floor of the ring
Or catch cage match after report to the bing
See a muscle give a dap to the vice tag-team
If I could never own it- why would I catch a bullet, dye my clothes and die on it
I warn ya, Shorty
It's corny on the corner, I'm saying my piece
Only turn my back on The West when I pray to The East
[My favorite corner]
