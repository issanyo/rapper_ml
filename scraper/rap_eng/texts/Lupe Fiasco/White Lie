[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr. "Why I Am Opposed to the War in Vietnam"]
It's a dark day in our nation
There comes a time when silence is betrayal
The truth of these words is beyond doubt
When high-level authorities will seek to use every method to silence dissent

[Part 1: Lupe Fiasco "Words I Never Said"]
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, And a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of "what the fucks"
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homey, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I’m a part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful
And I believe in the people, yeah

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda "Rebellion"]
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood, I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean
I can't resolve this empty story
I can't repair the damage done

[Hook: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington "Rebellion"]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion!
Rebellion!
Rebellion!

[Part 2: Eminem "We As Americans"]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
There's a Doberman Pinscher and a Pit Bull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda "Rebellion"]
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood, I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean
I can't resolve this empty story
I can't repair the damage done

[Hook: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington "Rebellion"]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion!
Rebellion!
Rebellion!

[Part 3: Lupe Fiasco "Words I Never Said"]
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

[Hook: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington "Rebellion"]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion!
Rebellion!
Rebellion!
