[Intro:]
2016
It's a new era
Are you ready?
Are we ready?
Can you hear the wolves?

[Verse 1:]
Why would you need a weapon of that powerful nature
When your nurture is rotten, your intentions unpleasant
Mind so misguided it should guide a nation
Role too suspenseful but not beneficial
Successful, wealth growing can't do any better
Unable to lead but serving a pleasure
If you hear wolves howling it's not to get attention
This is reality in R-rated version
Nuclear power to a not clear mind
You will kill 'em all with his own design
The spirit of malice is here to spite
Will you spit the truth or just pour a lie
Opinions are spatting and they cause a flood
Get drowned inside it as it turns to blood bath
A policy on fallacy, disrespect, to destruct
Based on hate, dismay, unable to instruct
Martin Luther King had a dream, it's now a nightmare
Any thought for freedom has been turned suicidal
If Jesus was real he should make his arrival
But his only feat would have been to go viral

[Hillary Clinton]
This is a very difficult vote
This is probably the hardest decision I ever had to make
Any vote that might lead to war should be hard
But I cast it with conviction

[Donald Trump]
"I'm the least racist person"
Are you bigoted in any way?
"I don't think so, no, I don't think so"
Islamophobic?
"No, not at all"

"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"

"No, not at all"

[Verse 2:]
How justice is measured is why I got my trust issues
Spiritual seizures that gon seize my existence
Let unleashed those demons, they threaten democracy
Made me kill myself, as they did to Socrates
Got no opinion, no voice, you censor a vocalist
Choice of freedom is sweet, can you stay an optimist
The dead stay dead and hope just follows them
You can just kill, then send your apologies
The masses protest as they're trapped in mazes
Conducted by media through critical phases
And don't get me wrong, I support no candidate
Stranger in America, just part of its crisis
Patriot of the world so earth is my origin
And danger is global, anger is the oracle
Of what's coming up next, I hear trumpets blowing
And a man with clean toned voice expressing his phobias

[Lupe Fiasco]
The terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism is the stuff that US government allows to happen
The foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists

[Verse 3:]
Terror won't stop or start now, it's always been present
The innocent pay no matter of President
No matter who are you
No matter who are they
They will still kill you if they can profit
Freedom gets fearful with nuclear power
Abuse of the force misuse of the science
Einstein gave light, it was used to blind us
To fight us, we die, don't cry, it's unanimous
The dead will be dead, forever, won't fire back
The hell stays hell, and heaven is lying
The mankind needs help but people are dying
Mothers are crying, burnt from inside
F-16s are flying, there's people who drive 'em
Paid to seed pain in eastern environments
