Chorus:
One for the money
Two for the po'
Three for my streets
Another four for the flow
Which I do so properly
God willin ain't no stoppin me ya know?(I say)
One for the game
Two for the Sco
Daps to my niggas
‘Nother five for the hoes
Not the ladies that wanna bring me round
But the haters that wanna bring me down. I ain't trippin

Verse 1:
Im tryna get a few bucks man
And I hate crime like the klu Klux klan
So I ain't tryna shoot a supply to shoot up man
Cuz’ it ain't honey when the fast money screw up fam
Dead crew come back up to through to boot us man like give ur loot up
The devil rootin’, But God really boo us (damn)
So put your cool up, rims on a school bus
And begin to rule you how they rule us man
Came out head first afoot, and they’ll hate that
If you start doin you how they do us man
So on the payback I snaps like gas money for a wax
Laid back on my scoot up fam
So when they thinking that Im just getting repped
I done been blew up like a crip getting dressed
You see I know to keep the B.I low
So they can't be holdin’ me back like G.I Joe (I guess so)

Chorus:
One for the money
Two for the po'
Three for my streets
Another four for the flow
Which I do so properly
God willin ain't no stoppin me ya know?(I say)
One for the game
Two for the sko
Daps to my niggas
‘Nother five for the hoes
Not the ladies that wanna bring me round
But the haters that wanna bring me down. I ain't trippin

Verse 2:
So that means I’m a pimp on par
Till I’m six feet under, like its 3 niggas in a Flintstone car
I keep my ear to the street like I can hear with my feet
I’m here till its clear, then adhere to the beat
Like a walking police that peep my peers
I keep my peer on my peeps that’s dear and move career
Here on the streets, I tell my niggas walk slow so I can steer on the creep
I try not to be too deep, cuz I ain't really ready to go
I try and stayin something that only got two seats
But you never know when your green go from go
And bring you round to a screech
And streets were starting to cook
That why I put my foot in the floor for keeps
Uh, for Jay Rock, Co, Chees, Bishop G, Doughboy, homeboys that’s deceased peace

Chorus:
One for the money
Two for the po'
Three for my streets
Another four for the flow
Which I do so properly
God willin ain't no stoppin me ya know?(I say)
One for the game
Two for the sko
Daps to my niggas
‘Nother five for the hoes
Not the ladies that wanna bring me round
But the haters that wanna bring me down. I ain't trippin

Bridge:
To the westsiiiiidddeee(Westside) to Madison street
And all the homies that be rockin wit me
I had the game quite flat thank God for that
And now I do it so properalyyy(properly)
And if you does not know you can't smudge our glow
The flow and the swag is mean
Four eyes and a fitted up’d and done did it
All on the first and fifteen

Verse 3:
And to the gangsta don’t get gassed by the eyeglass and me
Cross my path, feel the wrath like a crash at sea
1 pound like a half a key
To the haters that was mad at me
See your heat brought it outta me like
Um, a bag of tea
Made me a big bad MC
Associate a lot but my family few
Survey before I say like family feud
Make sure my family cool and one

Chorus:
One for the money
Two for the po'
Three for my streets
Another four for the flow
Which I do so properly
God willin ain't no stoppin me ya know?
One for the game
Two for the sko
Daps to my niggas
‘Nother five for the hoes
Not the ladies that wanna bring me round
But the haters that wanna bring me down. I ain't trippin

End:
Now nobody ain't see that
Nope you didn’t see that
