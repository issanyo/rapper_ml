[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Flip the beat up and bring me another track
Some of that, uh, some up all up under that
Bring the sun back, that be me I'm so on fire
So higher like the moon and I will not retire
But maybe soon but, maybe that will be that noon uh
Then I wake you up for it and pace you up for it
Uh, if you got it take you up on it
You can roll the dice but, promise you don't want it
See, you ain't really on it, you be on some other shit
I be on some wonky shit and be on some tonky shit
Takin' it and walking' it, L U P be stalking' it
Round the corner dressed up, so tight, no light
Unlike anybody ever seen too clever
Flowing off the top of the dome to whoever's beat
Uh, and whoever's neat I'm nicer
I'm more bling, more clean, more play - no dice uh
No dice cuz, see I don't roll that
Don't believe in luck just bringin' confidence
Constantly, consequence of tryna defy is not nice
You be so dead, uh - twice
Kill 'em again, and again, and again
The adrenaline that's flowing up in him
Uh, and you know it something special
It's damn near incredible I should eat this
Uh-uh uh, uh
I love my way but I'm back up on my path
A rapping wrath, a chaos spiting
Uh, It's more gripping
It's more intelligent and more thrilling
Than anything that they can do even though they top billing
See, I be underdoggin', I be underloggin'
Uh, it's something special someone better off them
It's damn near awesome but more like incredible
You can't eat me nigga I am so unedible
But if you swallow it's like swallowing glass
Got a belly full of doo
You can't stomach got a belly full of [?]
The audacity of them to think they rapidly ascend
I'm so aggressive or in the rage I take them off the stage
Skytel I bring it back just got a page
I'm like Tron, step up in the [?] it's the Don
See what' going on and in my own world
You can keep your home girl I got the whole world
In my hands in my palms, uh something like a bomb
Around the chest of some suicide vest, nah
It's Vietnam here, you keep it calm there
Cause you don't want none of this with ya
I hit ya, and git ya, split you, and brake it down
Bag it up, go to the hood take a route
Uh, take another shot, take another three
These are all bars [?] music and you can't see
And can't beat what I am, that's a A+
Uh, I hope God wanna save us
If they won't save you
Play too damn much messing with the homeboy, ya
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta
