[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
The mind's all a flutter, no pigs on the gig
No swine for the supper
No wine in the cupboard
Everything of mine must show signs of the suffer
And keep you abreast of the utter, struggle
To keep it all fresh like tupper
One of the tougher ginger bread men out the cutter
Skin ain't Huck Finn but I ain't Nigga Jim motherfucker
I'm more like Clubber, from the upper cut of the gutter
Never kow tow I won't bow down to the bull like Calcutta
That ain't what I'm rapping for
I'd rather be a matador
So ta ta, rather raw
I know that sounds fucked up like a repertoire
But there's no Ruth's Chris if I lose so I choose
To keep em seeing red like crips and pirus
He the guy who rides the haikus
Schooled at Cooley High, who has the not to
Till its time to rise up, ride for our views
Tired of all the lies won't abide by ya'll rules
AK's and IQ's, so my skies are light blue

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hey, I must admit it, I ain't ashamed I'm the best
They didn't get it, that's why I'm pissing off the rest
Niggas is jealous, of what I got resting on my neck
Cause it took me from down underground to soaring like a G4
Mug if you want to, bug if you want to
Chill if you want to, shrug if you want to
Build if you want to, joke if you want to, disrespect me
That's what you won't do, that's what you won't do

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Been around the world the things that I've seen
These things get turned into things that I sing
Things stringed together with similes in between
Been mean since the teens, since little green Marines
I beam, Mean Gene, Mean Greene, lean, dream, being the king, bling, bling
Three rings, ringlings, home, own, throw, Eames, yeah!
To move towards it I had the root for it
Like the home team, now they all lean
Singing that Queen Somebody To Love rap, city Boheme
We all champ-eens; you don't wanna bite the dust
Better stay on your scene
I drop the lyric, Woodbine, Bokeem
You can document it, Columbine bowling
I got the spirit, I require no wings
A fly MC, riveting my passions
To buy pro wings, then wear 'em on the cover of your magazines
Feeling real Yeti in my size fourteens tryna trump to lean, blue

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hey, I must admit it, I ain't ashamed I'm the best
They didn't get it, that's why I'm pissing off the rest
Niggas is jealous, of what I got resting on my neck
Cause it took me from down underground to soaring like a G4
Mug if you want to, bug if you want to
Chill if you want to, shrug if you want to
Build if you want to, joke if you want to, disrespect me
That's what you won't do, that's what you won't do

[Bridge: Pharrell]
Call Me Mama, nah ain't about to ignore me mama
All these ho's on me mama, why the hell you ain't want me mama
Call Me Mama, nah ain't about to ignore me mama
All these ho's on me mama, why the hell you ain't want me mama

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Success is my friend, who knew that when I grew up I'd be just like him
Expect my roar if you reject my whim, erect my law, respect my pim
I bring the pain, Method Man
I bring the pain, S&M
Shout to Fam-Lay one of my bestest friends
Try and kill us send all your deaths threats in, I'll just reply with excess wins
Please God correct my sins and protect my kin, as I jetset
Headrest up and my leg rest in, let's go

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hey, I must admit it, I ain't ashamed I'm the best
They didn't get it, that's why I'm pissing off the rest
Niggas is jealous, of what I got resting on my neck
Cause it took me from down underground to soaring like a G4
Mug if you want to, bug if you want to
Chill if you want to, shrug if you want to
Build if you want to, joke if you want to, disrespect me
That's what you won't do, that's what you won't do
