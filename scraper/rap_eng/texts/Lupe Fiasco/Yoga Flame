[Intro]
I call this one Yoga… Flame
(Yoga flame!) Aww!

[Verse]
Meditate, on the floor, fold your legs, resonate
Breathing speed, regulate, clear my mind till it levitate
Dhalsim, I beat the game, level 8, hella good
Never great cause God is great, so ain’t no goats, ain’t no gates
Fences see the rams ram, lambs let, sheep’s skate
Brace yourself, teeth straight, fix your face for Pete’s sake
Birthday wordplay, piece of cake, fold the flow with seats for eight
Ororo Munroe, make it rain, not with bills, I make it change
Take that cool shit, make it lame, take that nerd shit, make it bang
Yeah, you heard us make it bang, yeah, ya heard me make it bang
Melt the change and make a ring, take that ring & make a bracelet
Take that bracelet make a chain, look how far my necklace hang
Connect that chain up to a crane, pull the game up by the brains
Could not move it just with brains so I had to use some bling
Shouts to Drizzy, shout to Wayne, Yeezy, Jeezy, Ricky, Fifty
Raekwon, Loso, Gucci Mane, I’m not going to drop my name
Sneak that message to the masses, you can call me Chocolate Rain
You might think my wallet drained, look how far my pockets hang
That’s cause I got pocket change, my net worth is basketball
They net worth is soccer games tell them niggas stop it mane
But they cannot stop it mane, so, they forced to watch it drain
They be looking so blue like water when I wash my jeans
King without the whoppers and, King without the cobbler
And King and I ain’t got no dreams, Bruce Lee, dishwasher
Cleaning out your pots and pans, these niggas ain’t got no stain
Power once I hit them with the powder
Then throw em’ in the shower
These niggas slower than some dial-up
I be on my broadband, these niggas still downloadin’
Lu finished, you still up on YouSendIt, uShare
ZShare, how long you going to be there? Damn…
FinallyFast.com for you fam
Information super highway, these niggas ain’t got no lane
But you can ride my shoulder like they pulled you over
I sit in the driver’s seat, you sit on the sofa
I am Patrick Swayze, you are Whoopi Goldberg
Cause he was a beast in the way that he controlled her
Rest in peace to Patrick, rest in peace to Stacks, kid
Rest in peace to rap, no, rest in peace to wackness
Yeah, nigga, I whacked it
Baby boy with the glasses
He is like a black rap Zach Galifianakis
Hangover, game over, nigga that’s it!
(Yoga flame!)
