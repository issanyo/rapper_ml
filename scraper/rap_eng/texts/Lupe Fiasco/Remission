[Hook: Jennifer Hudson]
If I had a dollar, for every time they counted me out
And my back was up against the wall
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting
I could have died but I came out fighting (x3)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
With a breast full of lumps, man she ain't no punk
Said he gonna ride on it like a chopper in a trunk
Pink ribbon woman, she gone live forever
Even though the doctor said she only get a month
Said "It's my life, and you onle get in once"
These flowers smell too damn good to be living in the funk
So I finna get it in, and I finna get it crunk
And I finna get to living, ey-ey-ey-eyes on remission from the junk
Breast cancer can't hold me back
That's the answer when they told me that
It can knock me down, but I'm gon' be back, strong
Down for whatever, exceptional and I don't know how to quit
And I never said never, you can have that hair cause real talk bitch
I think I look better, let's do it

[Bridge 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Fighter, with everything inside her
Reporting live from Death Row, drop the charges see you life uh
Cellphones and your lighters, need you to put 'em up higher
So many candles on her birthday cake, might set the thing on fire

[Verse 2: Common]
My daddy say he got it in his prostate
When I went to see him, he had lost weight
Trying to find the words in a lost state, of mind
Pictures on the wall that remind
Me of the times that we once had
Had to take my daughter to see granddad
Pop, pop, nothing's impossible, you never been logical
I know what doctor's do, I know what God can do
Abdominal pain, hard to explain
For you to get better, it starts in your brain
Life ain't a game, the fight it remains, dance in the rain
When it first came, I was like damn
Then I start thinkin', then I start praying
Spirits went up, count went down
You gon' live forever, how you living now

[Bridge 2: Common]
Fighter, definition of a rider
Got all that ishh about you, with what you got inside ya
Cellphones and your lighters, put them things up higher
Even when you tired, you keep me inspired

[Hook: Jennifer Hudson]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Went undiagnosed and untreated
When they finally found it, told me too far along and he couldn't beat it
But he couldn't see it, miss me with that dead talk
Miss me, my legs walk and my hearts beats and my wife witness
So fuck cancer, my life with me, and if I die, it die with me
