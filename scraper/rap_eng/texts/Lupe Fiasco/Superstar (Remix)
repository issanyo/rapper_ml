[Lupe Fiasco on Ad-libs in Hook]

[Hook: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]
If you are what you say you are
A Superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones, and they wanna know, Yeah
If you are what you say you are
A Superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show, Yeah

[Verse 1: ApolloX]
Bring it back, Bring it back, Bring it back on track
Who out there wants to come rack up with me and the sack
Then my brother 2 could come too
Then ill ask a few girls, will you come through when I say the sky is blue?
Ok so there's a day we all in the fray
Don't care what im saying, its all about truth and pain
If you feel hurt inside then try and get by, there's never a day that goes by that I feel insane
But I know I'm not like that, I'm forever sane
But I'm not the same as these other motherfuckers
I reign on my city then the purple rain arrives and more pain shows
And never doubt that you can be whatever you want
Don't let anyone tell you different and not let you flaunt, its cold
But now I think its time to say goodbye to the legends, but remember they were superstars though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ApolloX]
Just have those, memories at high speeds when the car crash
Pushing the gas not the cash in the back of the bash
If you real young, just act dumb
Let no one stop you otherwise its no fun
Trust me on that one or fly away today
Cause my teenage years were taken by some fum decay
Don't let it happen, cause it will go laughing, if you don't get happy, and the world will go sappy
Chosen one, oh the one, help me here
I'm dying up in a lake, but can you see me here
I'm trying to achieve a goal, but that goal can never be achieved if I'm lying up in a rut and dead as my gut
My goal is I'm trying to get somewhere and be a superstar man
I'm trying to be the one that can see everything that is yet to come my way
I know what I am, and you say these things but if you are what you say you are....

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ApolloX]
Don't grow up being a screw, if you notice it
Then you better get up and do something about that shit
And if you one of those that thinks your almost there
Don't be scared, but your not even half way there
You still got a long way to go in the journey of the flow
Just wait a little while and you'll get the dough
But is that really what you want in this life?
Cause what I want is to be loved and supported by the rhymes that are due to the fans that think its cool
You have to remember that this isn't all a game, its about the quality and effort that you put in the shit
And you'll never get shut down by the haters that around you just laugh like "Ha Ha"
Then I'm like man, I know I got a plan, but its hard to implement when no one gives a damn
I don't know the future, but the haters say fuck it
But the true fans always tell me I'm a Superstar man

[Hook: Matthew Santos, Lupe Fiasco, & ApolloX]

[Outro: Matthew Santos]
If you are...
What you say you are...
Then have no fear...
