[Verse 1]
You're just a city in the state of mind
And the streets so cold they are
To get to you up in space and time
Yeah across these stars for you
You're just a picture in my frame of mind
Hanging on these lonely walls inside
To feel and get around way of crime
But they'll never take me alive

[Hook]
Cause we thieves
Don't die
We thieves don't die
Cause we thieves don't die
But we leave behind-hind-hind-hind-hind

[Verse 2]
You're just a city in the state of mind
And the streets so hard they are
To get to you up in space and time
And the Universe are a call
You're just a picture in my frames of mind
But they're falling down to the floor
To feel and get around a way of crime
But they'll never take me alive

[Hook]
Cause we thieves
Don't die
We thieves don't die
Cause we thieves don't die
But we leave behind-hind-hind-hind-hind

[Verse 3]
You're just a city in the state of mind
And the streets so cold they are
To get to you up in space and time
And the Universe are a call
You're just a picture in my frame of mind
Hanging on these lonely walls inside
Feel and get around a way of crime and they'll never take me alive!

[Hook:Extended]
Cause we thieves don't die!

Cause we thieves don't die
We thieves don't die
We thieves don't die

Believe in mine
We lie, we lie down
With a picture on the floor

Believe in mine
We thieves don't die
We thieves don't die
We leave behind
Believe in mine
Believe in mine
