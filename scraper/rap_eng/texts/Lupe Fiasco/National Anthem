[Verse 1]
Your attention please, your attention I need it
So I can sit you in a position from which I see it
Where I'm seated is scenic
Heavy-weighter, slim as the Machinist, so bulimic
Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas
I'm in the market for low-mile 360 Modenas
And a good organic cleaners
My car always a winner
Your car's always pitted
We should call it Stanley Steamers
Most of my friends in gangs
My new nickname is Ghenghis Khan
But without the 'Ye, but his last name's my side
I ride with the meanest
I'm armed to the teeth
You're Venus and you've never been to the Dinas/dentist
School of Hard Knocks, I dean it
I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus and my name's on the arenas
But you can't bring it to my court not even with subpoenas
Cause you can't play my sport but you can still cheerlead us
And you can't sit there, that section's for the seniors
And the sexy senoritas so just move up to the bleachers
How you going to school me when I grew up with your teachers
I know that you can't hear me
Cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging
Cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the im-pastas
And I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card
And I maxed out all the Visas
Accreditation so prestigious
Just walk across my stage
Your life will be completed
Don't need financial aid
Cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared
Throw your hats up in the air
I'm red hot, Chilly, I'm Anthony Kiedis
My spirit smells teenage
And Chi-town's feeling excellent
We hit them with the President
See we set the precedent
I don't feel I'm best
I just feel I'm better than

[Hook: Thom Yorke]
Everyone, everyone around here
Everyone is so near
So alone, so alone

[Verse 2]
See I don't disagree
This is just a grievance
This ain't dissent
This is civil disobedience
How you going to make hip-hop
Without all the ingredients?
Lot of mouths to feed
Plus a lot of greediness
And that greed, outshines the neediness
What niggas need is some question they authority
And tune out all the TV shit
And we be this
So I give them more
You see I did it for

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I am back up on the airwaves
Feeling like a Soldier and I ain't talking where the Bears play
Flair, look how I Fred Astaire down the staircases
It's finna be a hair-raising tortoise versus hare race
So you should hang around here like some earrings
I know attention's all about how you pair things
So when I want them to hear me out
I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And what's written on her titties is what it's really about
Then her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad
Back is like Afghanistan, Iraq
Health care hair, drive-by thighs
Education lips, HIV eyes
Environment feet
Justice get her so wet, brains get you brains
You can fuck her if you protest
But before you bust in her face, finish listening to the tape
Enemy of the State
