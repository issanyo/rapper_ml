"Talent is God given, Be Humble. Fame is Man given, Be grateful... Ego is self given, be careful"

They said my future will be dark
They see me now, take a look around
I'm beaming
They used to talk, when I came around
Now they walk around, with their heads down
LASERS

We're all asleep and when we die we're finally gonna wake up
The biggest trick the devil ever pulled is tellin girls they look better with makeup
Trying to respect what my parents had to work for
Get your respect but lose all my worth, no
You're just mad I can hear it all in your word choice
But you'll never silence this voice
When the world is this fucked up, silence is a crime
Much worse then buying green for a dime
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy
Crowding around me, so I don't wanna care right now
You fly girl, but god over everything
That means you ain't anything
But if you're modest maybe we can be everything
If love is a labour then i'll slave till the end
But we can't even love no more
So I don't wanna fight this war
It's gonna be hard
But I have to let you go
What cannot be cured must be endured
I'm gonna keep hoping that the wounds heal
Despite knowing that it never does
And that's because I'm at war with love

They said my future will be dark
They see me now, take a look around
I'm beaming
They used to talk, when I came around
Now they walk around, with their heads down
Losers

Yeah it's me again, the guy from verse one
But this is the last one
It's almost curfew
It's almost night out
So turn your lights on
Who ever said a grown man can't cry, they lied
The world's shoulders is what I'm crying on
The world's fast lane is what I'm driving on
I'm telling your story from behind this phone
I'm hoping that one day I can perform
So we can start writing history
Now if they're looking for me
Then tell em I'm gone
Living in the shadows
Right where I belong

They said my future will be dark
They see me now, take a look around
I'm beaming
They used to talk, when I came around
Now they walk around, with their heads down
