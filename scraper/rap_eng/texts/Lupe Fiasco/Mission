[Intro]
"What's up, this is Charlie Wilson a.k.a. Uncle Charlie
I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008, still fighting it
I'm a winner, not a loser, I'm gon' win the battle
That's right, I'm cancer free"
"What's up, this is Greg Porn and I beat kidney cancer, true story"
"Hello, my name's Michael, I'm a cancer survivor four years in remission"
"My name's Bernadette and I beat stage 1 triple negative breast cancer"
"I'm Angela, I'm 50 years old
And I've been through 9 surgeries in 3 years
Fuck you cancer, you may have taken my breasts and uterus
But you can never take my heart"
"My name's Ann Marie, and I'm living with stage 4 lung cancer"
"My name's Kourtney and I beat thyroid cancer"
[Bunch of mashed up talking about beating cancer]
"Hi, this is Kathy Phillips and I beat the living shit out of breast cancer
Cancer definitely picked the wrong bitch to mess with
Fuck you cancer! Woo-hoo! I'm a survivor baby! Yeah!"
"Hey my name is Charles Porter, I had stage 4 Hodgkin's Lymphoma
I went through a year of strenuous chemo then I had a bone marrow transplant
Where they gave me salvage chemo, and five days twice a day
Full body radiation to basically bring my immune system down to nothing
And uh, so literally died to stay alive, umm
Come April, I'll be in my third year of remission
And it was a team effort, all the friends and family I had came together
And uhh, I had to keep that mental strong
But umm, we got through it
Uhh, some fallen soldiers went as I fought
Uhh, but they'll always be heroes, peace!"

[Hook: Chef Tone]
If I had a dollar for every time they counted me out
And my back was up against the wall
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting, fighting

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh
With a breast full of lumps, man she ain't no punk
Say she gonna ride on it like a chopper in a trunk
Pink ribbon woman, she gon' live forever
Even though the doctor say she only get a month
Said it's my life and you only get it once
These flowers smell too damn good to be living in the funk
So I finna get it in and I finna get it crunk
And I finna get the living, ah-ah-ah
Eyes on remission from the jump
Breast cancer can't hold me back
That's the answer when they told me that
It can knock me down but I'm gonna be back
Strong, down for whatever
Exceptional and I don't know how to quit
And I never said never you can have that hair
Cause real talk bitch, I think I look better
Let's do it (do it), fighter, with everything inside her
Reportin' live from Death Row, drop the charges, be a lifer
Cell phones and your lighters, need you to put them up higher
So many candles on her birthday cake, might set that thing on fire, hey

[Hook: Chef Tone]
If I had a dollar for every time they counted me out
And my back was up against the wall
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting, fighting

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, seven years old with stage four
This what champions were made for
Only so much fundraisers paid for
So I guess the rest is just all on me
That will to live against what's out here
Killin kids, well kiss my ass
It ain't killin' me, got things to paint
I got places to go, I got things to see
Wanna see my momma grow up, hold up, hold up
Wanna see my daddy grow up, hold up, hold up
I'm baldheaded and bravehearted, I'm small
But I'm a hundred feet tall, try to stop me, biopsy after biopsy
Chemo, but I'm a king though
I shake everything off me, lymphoma can't hold me back
It can knock me down but I'm gon' be back
Throw some SpongeBob in my Hot Wheels track
I'm a made man, made wishes
I ain't scared, I ain't flinching
Sorry momma but I gotta say it
But where I'm from they don't make bitches
Let's do it

[Hook: Chef Tone]
If I had a dollar for every time they counted me out
And my back was up against the wall
I could have died but I came out fighting, fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting, fighting

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, feel it
Went undiagnosed then untreated
When they finally found it, told him
Too far along and he couldn't beat it
But he couldn't see it, miss me with that dead talk
Miss me, my legs walk
And my heart beats and my wife witness
So fuck cancer, my life with me
And if I died, it die with me
Let's do it, fighter, with everything inside ya
Reportin' live from Death Row, drop the charges, be a lifer
Cellphones and your lighters, need you to put them up higher
So many candles on that birthday cake, we might set the thing on fire, yeah

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson, Female Singer & Both]
We might set that thing on fire, yeah
Yeah we might set that thing on fire, yeah
Yeah, we might set that thing on fire
Set that thing on fire, set that thing on fire, yeah

[Outro: Chef Tone, Female Singer & Charlie Wilson]
If I had a dollar (if I, if I) (oh yeah)
And my back was up against the wall
Back was up against the wall (my back was up against the wall)
Come out fighting, yeah (come out fighting)
I could have died but I came out fighting (oh yeah)
Could have died but I came out fighting
Could have died but I came out fighting, fighting
