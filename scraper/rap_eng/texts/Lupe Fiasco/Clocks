As the time winds down on our night on the town
Let's live life, right now
Keep your eyes on the sound, it goes

Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

As we forget our names, in this minute of fame
And it blows our brains, escaping the pain
It goes, it goes, goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes

Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

And if it breaks your heart
We can pick up the parts and make a brand new start

Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

It goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
