[Lupe: Talking]
The uprising has begun
The revolution is here
The propaganda will be smashed
Your establishment will be shaken to the core
A new regime is being ushered in on the back of the people
We will not be held down any longer
This is a new day. Yeeaaa, spazz out

Fiasco
Fiasco
Fiasco [x3]
Fiasco
Fiasco
Fiasco [x3]

[Verse 1]
Uh, Uh, Uh
The revolution is here, a evolution of years
The building of skills now my brilliance is clear. Chea!
The anointed one to point a gun that's been appointed by the slums
To make u get it, show u how to get it done
Get a gun if u got it, tuck your chain, remove your watches
Brush up on your slang and your knowledge
Just acquaint yourself with making wealth, join a gang
Pick a system, take it hostage
Stuff your shoes, get a white tee, say hello to the impoveraged
Not completely poor, but they are completely more
In the midst of getting missed and getting pissed and taking yours
What u shaking for, you scared? Naw
Well I'm just makin' sure
No cowards will not take this cause

[Hook:]
Spazz out (Oh, really now)
Spazz out (Oh, really now)
Spazz out (Oh, really now) [x3]
Spazz out (Oh, really now)
Spazz out (Oh, really now)
Spazz out (Oh, really now) [x3]

[Verse 2]
No problem we will take wit force
We properly will break em off
Got em, lead em, freed em, teach em, rape em, make em, take em off
Look homey run your chain
Not the one that's on your neck
But the one that's on your brain
That they use to keep in check
Rebels that don't have a cause
The devil down here doesn't pause
So you gotta keep it moving
So the movement doesn't fall
And this consist of white and black and all
That's tired of fronting, tired of jumping for the man
Every time he ask for something, NO
Don't they think they got to drinking, smoking just to fit in
Women that think they gotta screw the owner just to fit in, NO
The overlooked and undercared, it's over look
The son is here, they unprepared, so we took them unawares

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Get ready, it's about to change
Things might never be the same
You might never be the king coup! (Coup)
As long as they release the reigns
If you think that we are playing
Watch us leave here with a bang BOOM!
Be careful cause there's thinkers here
Most the crooks are slingers here
Who know the tricks and know the books
And what took to bring us here
Now, a coup is in effect, you serpents of the throne
Bring a bird for the next and a murder of the known
The propaganda's ugly, the truth is on its way
This is a lot felt, they just didn't know how to say
They mouth is here, the stakes is high, the doubt is here
The threat is real, they can't survive what we are about to do

[Hook]

[Lupe Talking:]
Pimp the system
Things are never gonna be the same
FNF full reign
1st & 15th
Chea
Spazz Out
