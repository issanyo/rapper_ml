(feat. Lupe Fiasco)
[Intro]
Kevin! Michael... Lupe... Fiasco...
Hey, little girl, don't cry, dry your eyes...
I wrote this song for you...
Now, it goes down...

[Verse 1:]
In an imanginary world, every boy, and every girl
They'd all get the same things, They'd all get the same things
A little dough, a lot of love, with a mom, and dad to hug
They'd all get the same things...
But out here, the world is real, and it don't matter how you feel
Because, we don't get the same things, we don't get the same things
You got to work to stay alive, forty hours, from 9 to 5
We don't get the same things...

[Hook:]
All my gangster friends, and all my skater friends
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing
DJ's in the clubs, Jesus freaks, and thugs
We all want the same thing...

[Verse 2:]
And, I think about the way, all the politicians say
Say they want to change things, say they want to change things
Every year, they take some more, and I don't know what it's for
Though, they never change things...
But, if you want to make it stop (stop), well, first, you got to start
Making some big, old changes, doing some different things, yeah
Get up out your bed, think outside your head
And, you won't get the same things...

[Hook:]
All my gangster friends, and all my skater friends
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing
DJ's in the clubs, Jesus freaks, and thugs
We all want the same thing...
All my ex-girlfriends, and all their new boyfriends
They all want the same thing, they all want the same thing
From Wall Street, to the hood, New York, and Hollywood
We all want the same thing...

[Rap Verse:]
Yeah!
First empire to the people
The have's, and the have not's
Are we willing to give up all the hours, just to make it all equal?
And, make players out the mascots?
Because, right now, we don't see you, like the Sasquatch
Unless, the root of all evil, is what you have got
You're even more visible if your hair is lots
If not banging from the beach, then banish you to the sand box
With no lifeguard to come after you
No amount, you don't count, like Dracula
Your body drown, like a Titanic passenger
Or, a Haitian refugee trafficker
They come, and get you off the island that you crashed into
They take a yacht, and send the slave ship back for you
Money matters, don't let it master you
Pressing on the answer, til they give you what you're asking for
It's like that!

This is a message, to:
Remind, you, there's, just, one, true, coast, love...

Take them to church, Kevin!

[Hook:]
All my gangster friends, and all my skater friends
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing
DJ's in the clubs, Jesus freaks, and thugs
We all want the same thing...
All my ex-girlfriends, and all their new boyfriends
They all want the same thing, they all want the same thing
From Wall Street, to the hood, New York, and Hollywood
We all want the same thing...
