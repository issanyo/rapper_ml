"Neeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrdd!"

Westside, Baby, what's good?
I'm only gonna do this once, man, once
Till the album come
So, check it out

Verse:
From the M-A...D-I, to the S to the O-N, potent
To getcha open, move like a nigga supposed to get the dough
In the 'Go with the flow that I'm holdin'
Yo, man, they ain't "On Enuff", or up on enough
To stay in the zone that I go in that I go in, when I go in
And go in, of the poems, that were wrote and
Crucial Conflict was smokin', but a nigga like me, I don't be chokin'
So I proceed at a low speed, low key, like a OG in a '03 Loc-in'
Rollin' like a OZ, in a b-leaf,both pins, like a bowlin' ball
When I ball, but I never fall for the oki-dokin'
Whitewalls and the slow-speed motion
Stash-box for the police pokin',Rolie showin, shorty showin
Hokey Pokin',turnin' it around with me
To bust 'em down cause they know he golden
Exactly, I'm in it from the minute I was in it 'til the minute
That I spit it and I'm finished,and it's sad for me
Until the second wind, and reinvent it with a vengeance
Revisit it and make 'em give it back to me

[Outro]
All right, that's all you get
I'm done, you know what I'm sayin'?
In the streets where they traffic me, nigga, what
Shout out to all of Chi-Town
Crucial Conflict! Wildstyle, what's good? Coldhard, what up?
Never, what up? Kilo, what up?
Psycho Drama! The Snipers! Do or Die! Um, let me see
Twista! C-Wall! Legit Ballaz! Um, Traxster, what up, baby?
Um, who else out there? Oh! Triple Darkness!
Um, Soldiers at War! Um, who else?
Y'all gotta forgive if I, if I can't remember everybody
But, y'know, there was some people that had a lotta influence
On the kid
Revenge!
