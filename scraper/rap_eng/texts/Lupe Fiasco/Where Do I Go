[Hook]
And somebody tell me, where do I go from now (x4)

[Intro]
I've been lost, you know?
Oh, you know? I didn't know... didn't know at all

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I just wanted to use computers
I made it to the finish line first, but Lu's a loser
I wanted to watch so I turned to rocks
Like Medusa, the block, the users
The rock, the shooters, the shots, the heckle of cops
The lugers, the Glocks, the cougars
Should be with my Akhs, making Salat in the Ummah
But instead I'm on the block in this lot with the Kufi's
And I'm feeling like a doofus, I think I understand the meaning of life
And really ain't no reason for ice, still want it
Still haunted by the demon, a price
But if u give it to me we'll flaunt it
I think niggas is dead broke, and I can bring em to life, its funny how--
Naw it really ain't funny sometimes I hate money
Please God take from me

[Hook]

All my blessings, I take em as a lesson
Make 'em into questions, and relate 'em to the present
Should I take it as a present? A penalty?
But everything's from the man upstairs
Could barely sing cuz the man upstairs is beating on the floor
When the music stops will I have a chair?
Will I be seated on the floor
It really don't matter cat beat me to the score
I was speaking to this whore
You know I got trouble with women humble beginnings
Mumblin and tremblin now they smugglin and stealing
Step ya game up check the dame what?
I nutted on her fangs ain't nuthin to hang up
That really happened in fact but I ain't manufactured for that
A bumpy ride had to fasten my straps
I be tryna reach em, other niggas be lyin:
Dyin' to get behind and beat 'em
I just be tryna teach 'em

[Hook]

I put it on paper, cuz they'll put you on for paper
But most of these niggas is paper
10 1/2 by 8 blue lines 3 holes
Hit they ass wit 8's, flat lined, 3 holes
Cuz they'll gas u up like cold pacer
And leave u in the cold without a coat with a cold
Thats not gangsta them niggas ain't ya boys man
Them niggas is the poison gotta keep em under the sink
Right next to the bleach I say that I'm on top of my game
Cuz if you under you sink
I wonder if its just the hunger you think? imagine that til it haunts you
Them niggas want you to fall, I fall cuz I want to
Yellow leaves and felonies that's how I fell on these
God made my head with mind in it
They made my bread with swine in it
Made my bed and now im lyin in it
I wonder if this is my limit

[Hook]
