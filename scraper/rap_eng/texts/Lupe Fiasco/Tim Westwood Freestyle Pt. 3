[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Fire flame spitta
On another track, don't want none of that
With no water and no slaughter
No breaks I just continue on, with no takes
I keep going, I keep flowing, no stopping that
And see everybody watching that
See I got the lock so I'll be locking that, you can't get the keys
Especially from me, I keep them so excited in my pocket
You'd better watch it, and matter of fact you'd better stop it
I'm too hot, better hopscotch it and go up down the block
You might catch a shot, one two
Blat, blat, blat -
My flow is like...Heckler and Koch
Hit you up straight
Niggas aiming for your face when I come through...
I ain't hitting hearts, I'm just aiming for the brains
Trying to make'em smarter and take'em out of danger's way
And say maintain today
I show the shorties how to maintain the way so righteous
The nicest and do it like is priceless, iceless
No, I got a couple those watches and a couple cars
And I keep a couple flows and a couple bars
And I keep a couple hoods and a couple stars
In my back pocket and you can back watch it
You better backstop it like it's cricket
I keep a wicket googly when I stick it, be like the Batman, hitcha
You can come through just like don't pitch it out
I'll knock it out the park, it'll be so dark
By the time I'm done, there'll be no sun
There'll be no one, see the crowd so empty
I'll still be there rhyming, see it don't tempt me
I don't feel guilty either, I feel so filthy when I roll
Flowing like ether, burning niggas down
Turning niggas' worlds around and show them there's better ways to get it down

Yeah, yeah, it feeling like an iPod
Look at my god and bow my head down to heaven
I pray to the East, I try to do it seven times a day
Do it my way, may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do
And for the fasts that I didn't fast
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them
Or if not keep me so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about their success or their chains
I don't care nowhere, but I do care about you, don't ever let'em doubt you
Don't ever let them try to put a mouth to the violence
The silence that I bring is so deafening to the ears and the eyes
And they can watch if they want to
See it's gonna haunt you
The ghosts of the past come through so fast
You lay'em down but they can't, you try and put it in the trash
But it jumps out the garbage and still returns to be the hardest on the market
