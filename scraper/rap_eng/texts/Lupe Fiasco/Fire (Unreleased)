[Verse 1]
Fiasco thats my name don't wear it out
Especially in front of feds who want to know my where-abouts
Where the house and his stash-box at
How he live where he is who he flash Glocks at
And them hurt play boys drop all types of change so we gotta dog-fight all night with the range its all right
You know I be the all time small nine carrier all across America, quick to bury ya
Who done pulled out more babies than Heathcliff Huxtable
He is W, A-S with the A-R and the L-S with the V-S and his ch-arm kids jealous they get pellets
Buck shots and what not
Who tough top get stuck in they mouth like gum-drops
These niggas think they're immune but I got chick-booms that will put them in tribunes, resume

[Verse 2]
Niggas taking mine not permissible. On visual gon' be physical. Niggas don't believe in God make them spiritual
He make it out that whip it's a miracle
No salad dressing just dress him in his best and bless him I said it so I meant it
I take it if its local Fed-Ex or if it's distant
The business
Mostly sold to the block
Only told to my pops
Only for if its a lot the Glocks And the watch I dropped
Sealing when I'm peeling
Shop Neimans by the season for the freaks them
Two pair of jeans and decent
Niggas praying I don't see em
MC's is praying I don't see em
I'm franchise now
They just playing for the season
I'mma have shoes next year the way I do this here
I dominate they domino
It's common though typically, lyrically catch yourself slipping with me

[Verse 3]
I'm quite sinister facing two murders one verbal one vehicular
Whipping ah
Pearl white tight with the cinema
Two tears black killing ya
A few years back was the red room distributor
Looking ill'er I-L's with the temperature
Skytell on vibrate hide mail from pirates
Emperor
Niggas is pussy and bleed vinegar
Chill-Illy on the index, Jerome on the MX, mack millies
And for-really all you insects one hit wonders don't streak like Windex
Hit Michigan for the caper
Mr. Chen get the paper
Laundromats in Hong Kong with the accent saying cat trying to wack my smack connect
Before he get clipped make sure my stacks correct
Hoes get invaded Cadillacs get wrecked
No Problemo long as my habitat's in check
