Well Lady Listen Here
I'll Takes Some Time Out To Take You Out Your Daily Grind
Send A Car Service To Lift You Out Your Studio
And You Can Give The Booth A Childs
Or Just Wing To Hair Roots
I'm A Play The Beat
Go Head And Sing Your Carols
But Before You Rhyme
Let Me Keep It Real
You May Not Get Sign
And I Don't Promise Deals
But If You Do Right And You Can Handle Pressure
Maybe We Can Make Beautiful Music Together
Yes Sir
