[Verse 1: B.o.B]
If you asked me what's on my mind you probably won't believe it
'Cause if life was one big pool, I'd be in the deep end
So I play my role and never ever speak it like a secret
And all the while you just try to figure me out

[Hook: B.o.B]
But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Well ask me a question, I tell you no lies
'Cause there's nothing to hide, my soul's in my eyes
And I'm ahead of my time but I cannot rewind
The only thing I fear is the mirror in my bathroom
People look and try to see a disguise
But there is nothing that nobody can't see in light
If it's a song with a rhyme or a verse with a line
Then you understand in my mind

[Hook: B.o.B]
But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Who else but Lu else?
You know I got two belts, the black and the white one
I begin and I master
I see in my eye glasses
But they saying what I'm seeing through is false like Ross
I can hear him through the wall like "Walk
This Way", trying to dissuade my thoughts
I'm a slave to myself and disobeyed my boss
It's all in disarray this parade I walk
They get amazed when they catch a chain I toss
Amidst this array of different ways I talk
And it hangs from your brain if my chain you caught
Like I cough without covering my mouth
I tip the scales like the king of the south
Forgot that I was fat, I lost my way
But now I'm back looking for the shade I sought
And not wonders, I'm Scott Summers
So don't make me take off my stunners
Bobby Ray, you know you got my numbers
And them deer can't see us like hunters

[Hook: B.o.B]
But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades, past my shades
