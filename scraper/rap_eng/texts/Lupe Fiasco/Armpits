[Hook: Da Pak]
Niggas, bitches, pimps, tricks
Whoever you with, let me see them armpits
Musty or dusty, ashy or nasty
When your paths meet, let me see them armpits
Hey, yo
Hit somethin'
Pop somethin'
Move somethin'
Rock somethin'
Spit somethin'
Cop somethin'
Do somethin'
Lock somethin'
You want your life? The lift your arms up!
Nigga put your palms up, get them guns up!

[Verse 1]
Come on over ho, we got weed in the Rover
If you don't get your hands up, you can bleed in your shoulders
I'm the holy ghost ask them Jehovahs
I leave no witness, nobody but the chauffeur
You might see me on the sofa with Oprah
Nope, you gon' see me on the screen
For catchin' a 3 to 15 for this cream
?
I'm doing hit-runs with my hit-team
Somebody get shot, nobody get seen
Girl you a party ho, but that fit look nice on your body though
I don't party though...
Bitch! I'd rather stick niggas for their money
And baby, this ain't a party song
But I'll hit hoes with the Bacardi long
Dick stroking, pussy bust that shit open
Big pimping, big scoping, your tip closing

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We backed up in this Expo
Drugged, gats up
Time ticks to conflict, the bomb hit
Explosion, blows with yo neck slow drips, holes
Get 'em up are you finna win or what?
Hands, get 'em up
It's too clutch, by the guts, send 'em up
As far as them blocks go, we got those, hit 'em up!
Popped a mo', let's go henny in the cup
Optimal, make 'em stop, drop and roll
With the hot flows, spot clothes, gotcha dough
Shot ya ho, dragged her out the hospital
Unlock the door, pop the trunk, lock the fo'
Ridin' in the drop-top slow, copped the dro
Spot the popos but they only obstacles
Jump from the pot smoke, won't stop the show
Got the dough, lash out ?
?, C'mon!
Yeah, yeah, uh, what? Yeah niggas, what? What? What? Uh, What?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Hey, yo
I pop something, write for a little; drop nothing
Unarmed? Nuh-uh, lights on 'em pistols stop fronting
While y'all chase birds like Road Runner for phone numbers
I be in the back with bone crushers and known hustlers
Big bill niggas, big deal niggas
One call you're killed, all ill niggas
Want beef? Better be extra sure
My niggas be under your floors
So stay on your toes like pedicures
My 16s make other rappers quit dreams
Try to sing, enlist in the marines
Zero tolerance, I leave heroes hollering
?
Feel me? 'Course not
Still be on top
On the rock, bill me for your spot, for real B
Honor that
18, longer gat, corner cat, stronger raps
When Lu on, who gon' be stopping that?

[Hook]
