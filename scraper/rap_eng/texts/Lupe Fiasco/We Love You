[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
That's what they say to me
And I entertain it quite playfully
Serious though, I'm Curious George
Killing cats with the flow, type gracefully
Lean back and I raise my feet
Give a little blow 'fore I taste my tea
On a world tour I'm in Gay Paris
Lu at the Louvre can't wait to see
8.50 I done paid my fee
Say "what up Venus?" then I take my leave
Hit collect and debate a spree
It's hard to sit it down like a maitre d'
Watch all the pretty little mates to be
They be tryna picture how I make my cheese
Little apricot on the crÃªpe I eat
Running late on my Casio face I see
Chefs in the kitchen tryna bake my steeze
But I keep it chilled, bout a 8 degrees
Everywhere I go I gotta take my skis
So cool turn milk into Tasty Freez
Used to watch Charlie go to make believe
Euro-star, first class, take my seat
Few more pounds in my HMP
Now I got the bounce I can make them sing

[Hook]
We love you
We love you, we love you
Yes we do, we love you
Yes we do

[Verse 2 - Sway]
She said she loves me, And I believe her
Making it 100 times harder for me to lead her (on)
I'm so eager to prevail
If music was a female I'd shag her
And end up coming quicker than an e-mail
Bye, ?, Au revoir, Arriba!
I'm going overseas so hide your daughters behind the doors
The minor tours and tore them down like minotaurs
Fine
With metaphors from when I thought clitorises were dinosaurs
(Sway) But I don't roll with a tech
But I will, if you go against my code of respect
If I don't hustle then my heart will stop
Back in Britain, rappers press up half the stock
I move and they ain't moving half the stock
And they can't fit in my shoes, so put a sock in it
Better yet a stocking 'fore I sock it to you
You're a laughing stock
America passed my ?, pass the buck
I'm about to blow so fast before I started
We've already passed the aftershock
(She loves it)
And I still believe her, making it 200 times harder for me to handle it
I'm coming to America
But I ain't playing football with you folks
Cos the last time, the bloke picked the ball up
And ran with it
Pass me my passport and my cargo
She's still yelling and telling me
I can't go
Lupe is belling me, my plane is about to leave
I'm on my way to Chi-car-go

[Hook]
