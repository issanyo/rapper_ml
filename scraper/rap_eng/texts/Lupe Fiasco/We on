I represent it to the fullest
Never met a nigga that can take it the way I took it
That ain't gonna make you hate us now would it
Troubles Of the World man then nigga pull it
Come kick it with your homie i'll show you how to push
If Your Looking To Stand I'm camouflage in the bushes
Fly in ya mind i'll show you how to look it
Rock's in tha band like OH GOD, MY GOODNESS

We the 85 Bears

05 Socks, With A Whole Lot Of Pull
All rolled up n theres no lettin up
If your smart you wanted me to 07 us
Never met a nigga even this cold
Watch every...... 23's 24's
Nothin but tha best tv screens on tha dope
Try to get it how you live it when you livin in tha gold
Well im all like No chrome No tence fo' phones
Just case E.T wanna go home
Never chase, coz of me there is no jones
Levitate from tha sea-floor to tha O-Zone
5 star hotels all week
Non stops to Paris ain't cheap
Sick lake views
Big pent house sweets
Champs-elys√©es is magnifique
Gucci sweats when im out in tha streets

Lindi shorts when im chillin in tha beach
Idium when im out in tha mountain
My hereshee wanna mount on tha town-end
Spring water won't mess with tha fountains
Land rovers back to back when we camping
Felipe lemonade, Police dederade, We didn't fear
Back to tha bouncing
Fresh dismoke on they pill
Steamed on the freeway we chillay chill
Did tha food then n it stillay still
Got it off tha ground like a whilled wheel
Uh you from tha west side?Born and raised
You from tha south side right?Thats were I spend my days
Where I lay
Where I Stay
N you ain't gotta wonder why I get my ways

Till we meet again we can free my nigga
Zip ....... Ima bease my niggas
With tha new Benz when tha 23's dont fit em
Now you know you can't red light tha green light
Try ta break us up, lace it up
Keep tha theme tight
Its lifestyle man get off wen we sleep 9's

From tha sports cars, faster then your cars

Better together now ya'll know tha letters
FOREVER N FOREVER FNF U....P
