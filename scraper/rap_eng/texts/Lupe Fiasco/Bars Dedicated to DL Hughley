George Carlin was one of the smartest men I've ever heard
Challenged you through his comedy and displayed the power of words
My brother Dave Chappelle is a genius through his show you saw the proof
Wittily exposed the lies and had us laughing at the truth
Foxworthy, Katt, Chris Rock, Richard Pryor, Dick Gregory was the king
But from your shows it must be told I never learned a fucking thing
Eddie Griffin through his riffin' appeals to a higher sense of purpose
Takes our darkest deepest ignorances and pulls them to the surface
Turns them into food for thought, it's funny but you thinking
A comics power is they use the fun to overcome forgive me if I'm reaching
They always spoke the truth to power in a disguised and friendly bit
Only a comic can diss a president and even have him laughing at the shit
What happened to that? Strong social critiques thru thoughtful comedic jabs?
But you'd rather do "yo mama" jokes cause some heckler got you mad
I hate to break the news, but I love that it will be spoke
You didn't take your comedy seriously, so now YOU are the fucking joke!
