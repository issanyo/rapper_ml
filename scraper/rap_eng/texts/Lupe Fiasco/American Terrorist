[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Close your mind
Close your eyes
See with your heart
How do you forgive the murderer of your father?
The ink of a scholar
Is worth a thousand times more
Than the blood of a martyr
Terrorist

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
We came through the storm
Nooses on our necks
And a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the Pentagon lawn
Wake up, the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a West Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk, already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflauged Torahs, Bibles, and glorious Qurans
The books that take you to heaven
And let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpretated reasons for warfare
Reread them with blind eyes
I guarantee you there's more there
Rich must be blind
'Cause they ain't see the poor there
Need to open up a park
Just close ten schools, we don't need 'em
Can you please call the fire department?
They're down here marching for freedom
Burn down their tepees
Turn their TVs on to teach 'em
And move

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
The more money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever, whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
American Terrorist

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now the poor Ku Klux man
See that we all brothers
Not 'cause things the same
But 'cause we lack the same color
And that's green
Now that's mean
Can't burn his cross
'Cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a Muslim woman
Strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running
Give you the jitters
Just imagine an American-based
Christian organization
Planning to poison water supplies
To bring the second coming quicker
Nigga!
They ain't living properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em Coca-Cola for their property
Give 'em gum
Give 'em guns
Get 'em young
Give 'em fun
But if they ain't givin' it up
Then they ain't gettin' none
And dont give 'em all
Naw man, just give 'em some
It's the paper
Some of these cops must be Al-Qaeda
Nigga, uh

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
The more money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever, whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets
American Terrorist
The more money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever, whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
It's like
Don't give the black man food
Give red man liquor
Red man fool
Black man nigga
Give yellow man tool
Make him railroad builder
Also give him pan
Make him pull gold from river
Give black man crack, Glock, and things
Give red man craps, slot machines
Now bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Don't give the black man food
Give the red man liquor
Red man fool
Black man nigga
Give yellow man tool
Make him railroad builder
Also give him pan
Make him pull gold from river
Give black man crack, Glocks, and ting
Give the red man craps, slot machines
Now bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, uh
