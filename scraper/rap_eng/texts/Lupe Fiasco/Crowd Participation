[Verse 1]
On the outskirts
Worry bout fittin in
I'm blending out, I'm giving out
Radioactive, radioactive
Sociopathic, all The Old Tactics
To keep us down
To keep us down

[Hook]
Critical mass
Critical mass
(Critical mass)

[Verse 2]
On the outskirts
Talk of being down
Do without, I'll do without
Radioactive, radioactive
Socialpathic, all the old tactics
To keep us down
Underground

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
By design, By the law
By the way, buy some more
By design, By the law
By the way, buy some more
By design, By the law
By the way, buy some more
By design, By the law
By the way, buy some more
In a rage
The lies that are on your face
And in your mouth, in your mouth
Radioactive, radioactive
Socialpathic, all the old tactics
To keep us out

[Hook]

On the outskirts
The edge of thin air
Blend it out, blend it out
Radioactive, radioactive
Radioactive, radioactive
Radioactive, radioactive
