[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Uh, number ones around Afros
Making figures like Hasbros
Off the field we still keep the helmet like Daft shows
Vietnam how the draft flows, private browsing, cash flows
Flow, flow, double deck, cash cash, that's a double check
Two jobs, double desk
Keep a magnum on me, you are not a fucking threat
That Vietnam, I'm too mature, dawg, I'm a ducking vet
Freudian slip, I correct my mistakes just to scope
One eye open, one eye closed, sniper face (ah, ah, ah!)
One eye open, one eye closed, pirate face
One eye woke while one hibernate
Look, it's colored people time
Both eyes open, and that is how you isolate
Optimally-speaking, global warming, ice is late
ISIS, I.C.E. is too, baby
Oh you cold cold? I'm both though
Stay dangerous as YG, you safer than a Volvo
You buy these, I sell those, I'm Crenshaw, you Melrose
Like huh? (Huh, huh, huh, huh, huuuuh)
That's street street, let's go fleet fleet
That's thirty sixes like 3 police (Woo woo woooo)
You can even lease, I'm Stephen King meets Jean Baptiste (Yeah!)
Rip locs, get the drum or something, that's 1500 or nothing huh?
These goofy niggas with they summer runs think they runnin' somethin'
They don't want none of him
I'm losing nigga, my head band is number one
The otaku, they don't understand where I'm comin' from
Choir singing and the pastor preaching and nuns will hum
Speak tongues to them, and I'm done with thought
And I ain't even begun it young, wave
Yuhh!
