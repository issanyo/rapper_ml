[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies
Out there grinding

[Verse 1: Asaiah Ziv]
Ya been asleep, better wake up, Swoope
Why y'all sleeping on the kid like you hit the snooze?
Why I'm the youngest in the game?
Yea I broke the rules
Why y'all acting all deranged?
Don't know what to do
That's why I never hold my tongue, got too much to lose
They say I came out the blue, shoulda hit the clues
I been here for a minute, I just wasn't used
Pass me the rock and Imma shoot
You can watch 'em ooze, blow!
Dropped the album and they went wow
It's been a minute since I finally seen my mother smile
It's been a minute since my friends came to say they proud
They say I'm cocky, is it prideful for me to say I'm proud?
How many songs with favorite rappers, you behind the crowds
Don't wanna be a millionaire, just a faithful child
For all my riches up in heaven money isn't 'bout
High five to all them haters, be here for a while

[Hook: Asaiah Ziv]
Guess I'm the black sheep
Guess I'm the black sheep now
(Labeled a misfit)
Guess I'm the black sheep
(Man, I'm ready to rock)

[Verse 2: Asaiah Ziv]
Man I'm back in the sky, such a petal
But I'm 'bout to cut some strings off, I'm tired of these mediocre rappers
I ain't in the mood for that
I'm tryna give 'em something great
See 'em fall like dominoes effect cause eagles in the way
But I ain't in it for the fame
Skip the fame, give me substance
After all these artists that I'm hearing, all they do is function
A volume to the clarification of why they spitting
I be spitting to the nations
Give 'em peace and give 'em patience
I used to imitate Lupe until I got my own voice
I used to rap on beats like "The Cool" and "Little Weapon"
Had me daydreaming
And then I had to kick, push my way into the circle without tryna sound commercial
What the radio played really hurt me so
But that "Go Go Gadget" really gave me flow
Hip-hop saved my life, I'm never letting go
Until I get a show in Paris, Tokyo
Yung Lupe

[Hook: Asaiah Ziv]
Guess I'm the black sheep
Guess I'm the black sheep now
(Labeled a misfit)
Guess I'm the black sheep
(Man, I'm ready to rock)

[Outro]
It ain't hard to tell
Back with hardcore lyrics, I adapt
But I won't settle for less
Theoretically living out a legacy
