"TERIYAKI JOE: NEO-HARLEM DETECTIVE"

Chapter 4: Pie

Slurp..Slurp...Slurp...Sluuuuurp...SlurpSlurpSlurpSlurp...hmmmph!...aaah!...*Gulp* :)

"Happy Valentines Day Baby" she says with a wink. I fell for the Mohawk. She fell for the 10,000 Units. The business of love in the streets

Had to relieve some tension before I made my first move. Decisions made while being tense always come back to bite you in the ass. Clarity

"Everybody" just for 1 person. Seems a bit extreme. Even for a "Parker." You'd think all that Taichi would make them a little more peaceful

A little more humane. Hell even a little more robotic would be nice at least they have a valid point. This whole thing has funk on it

I know 11 was serious though. Deadly serious. Serious as the 100 Million Units he winked at me when I refused to take the job

Serious when he said in 5 days he'd "update" every food pill in Neo-Harlem so instead of the shakes you got the deads right after dinner. ;)

Get rich and save Neo-Harlem. I like that.  Getting lost in the VooDoo and probably end up destroying Neo-Harlem anyway. I don't like that

Things tend to get real possible when you got a gun to your head or money in your hands. I got both. Mix fear with reward. I'm impressed

Lost dogs are easy. Easy as pie. Find some shabby two-Unit witch doctor have him call some flea bag back from the VooDoo, Exorcise & Upload

Getting a human soul back from the afterlife is lets say a little more complicated than that. Not pie at all. Devils pie is what it is

Shit!
