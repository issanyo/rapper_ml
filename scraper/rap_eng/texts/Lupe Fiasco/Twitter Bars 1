[Verse 1]
Every year we do better, steady on the rise
The tears for lost ones weigh heavy on the eyes
Dita sunny's, gold prezzy, twin turbo chevy fo' a ride of course
From the backseats of phantoms I thought of leaving thrOUGH suicide doors
Love got me through it, best fans ever made the whole world care
Had 51st & 6th looking like Tahrir Square!
Apologize for dumbing it, but look what has become of it
"All Black Everything," some old white southern woman humming it
Took Gaza Strip's politics and put them number one and shit
Took the myth that concious don't equal commercial and mothafuckin' pummelled it!
Weapons for the weak, lessons for the meek
The too proud to beg, and the too poor to speak
The too smart to listen, and the too dumb to teach
Two sides to every story so I listen to both speak
Shout to all the DJ's, who gave a nigga replays
@fakeshoredrive, @rapradar & the whole internet space
You put it online I put it in they face
And there it will remain, for a tleast another week
Right at number 1, hahaha yeah nigguh
Stay strong Japan, Nate Dogg REST IN PEACE!!!
