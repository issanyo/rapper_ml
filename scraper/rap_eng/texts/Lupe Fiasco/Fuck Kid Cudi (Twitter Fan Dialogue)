Letty: :/ I hate ya'lls feud

L: He a disrespectful clown tho Leticia....he can't help himself but still...

Savvy: kicking this man while he's down will not bring your fan base back

L: Man fuck that nigga..what part of "rehab" is calling people pussies and asking for fades?! Rehab is checking your own problems not this shit.

Zoe: yo you're real Low for comin @KidCudi during his rehab. U Wna take this shit to Twitter #SMH I thought u was above that

L: Fuck cudi.

Zoe: u look like any typical person. Just like the general public to bring beef to the Internet & to be makin all that noise #Chill

L: You pushing what you THINK you know about this dude...I'm acting what i KNOW. That dude FOUL and needs his ass beat. Period.

Zoe: ok but you're better than this.? You're not some typical loud mouth celeb that's always screamin out beef.#StandOutFromTheCrowd

L: Exactly you NEVER seen me just pop off for no reason. Investigate this niggas antics before you ask me adjust to appease a fuck boy...NEVER

Deuce: I remember you had a problem with him over the $500 feature thing. I'm sure it's deeper than that tho, right?

L: He called me a thief. In public. Had all kinds of people shitting on me for no reason. Then ducked a conversation to clarify or squash it
