Intro: The young kid Fox...Lupe Fiasco... Life
[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
From city to city, I really did it for y'all
From the itty bitty small, to the really really tall
Where they paw, and they living in a shelter
Begging with their kids, they're too helpless to help her
If you walk in trailer park today
Or a park where the ground is too harsh to lay
Or the projects where there's no park to play
And it's too dark to read
And you're too marked to leave
Where wick only buys juicy juice and kicks
It's a trip because the youth is usually used to this
And that's strength
And you gotta be strong
When the dramas on your back
And your clothes don't match
And your father is gone
And on top of all that
The water isn't on
And your dishes don't match
The teachers say they only come to school to flunk
But there's some that only go to school for lunch
And that's life

[Hook]

This one goes out to all of the children
Hanging out of them buildings
While they just watching the asphalt grow
Now some of them got bright futures
And some will never know
Because they say it's a miracle
If we live to see 24
This is for them babies with no fathers
For the people that's starving
Living out here on these streets
To that man that's working too hard
Just to feed his family
Working 2 and 3 jobs
Ain't got time for play at all
This is his life

[Children Singing]

This is for my people out there hustling
To the family that's struggling
Living from paycheck to paycheck
?
The baby needs a pair of shoes
And on top of all that
We've got to deal with self-esteem issues
This is for the ones that go and tell
They say no matter what you do
Money can't buy you happiness
And this is for all we've sacrificed
For all of the pains
For everyday we cry
We just have to keep living our life!
