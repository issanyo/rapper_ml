[Verse 1]
6 years ago there was a seismic shift
A rise, a lift
He finally arrived in rap form
And used that form as his platform to provide his gift
Summarized as sick, quick witted and hip
Also promoted wisdom in a broken system gave the fans a fix
And bitch niggas the fits, a culmination of hard work
Long nights through cold water and large surf
Wading the water this MC became a Man, McMan, Star Search...
Now in between these here albums we've had our ups & downs
Partly my fault 'cause the way I talk a mix of giving a fuck & he don't fuck around
But I always kept it honest as my father made me promise
Before he left this world to go and dwell amongst the comets
So put aside the comments, the constant blog blah blah & me arguing with comics
Cause #Sept25th I bring again the gift prepare to be astonished
And waste no time when trying to decipher every verse
Cause if part 1 is just the gift, part 2 will be the curse
