Whattup, this Lupe Fiasco
And you're watchin the Pepsi Max NFL Audible

[Nick Javas]
Hello sports fans, we're comin down to the nitty gritty
Who will be representin the city?
It's the moment that motivated you back in two-a-days
Allow me to pass it off to Lupe, get 'em!

[Lupe Fiasco]
Welcome to Chi-Town, lie down, nah never that
Packers and the Bears in the battle that, never lacks
They go forever back, to the days of Butkus
And Nitschke was simply on this planet just to run blitz

[Nick Javas]
Up against each other in this
The 182nd clash of titans, do the math
They're bitter rivals for 10 short of a century
No time to be friendly, who's applyin the better D?

[Lupe Fiasco]
For Chicago, comin off the end is a beast
Far as I know, Julius the Pepper to beat

[Nick Javas]
Put the season on it but Jennings steadily beats
The best of the DB's to get him his TD's
12 on the year like his quarterback wears
But he won't be signin any autographs here
The cornerback Bears got their hands to a button hook
Like you ain't got your guard up like when that man pulls

[Lupe Fiasco]
But the Packers better punt it out of bounds
Or Hester's, gonna turn them into clowns and jesters
And 22 be runnin through, they hummin blues
While beat jacks stay outside of the beat gaps
And why would you insist on tryin to split, Brian and Briggs
Supplyin the hits, denyin them six
So cue the violins for the losers, a bruise to the ego
A Superbowl ring is bein repo'd

[Nick Javas]
And it was right there, but now it lives in your nightmare
The pride of a Packer verse the fight of a Bear
The lion's share could only go to the king
See you next week, or see you in the spring

[Lupe Fiasco]
Dreams of rings that gleam upon the mantle are cancelled
If you plan to win it playin timid

[Nick Javas]
Quite the challenge; who's gonna be tryin their talents
In that one final fight in the Palace? ...
