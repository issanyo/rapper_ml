(Santa rap)
1, 2, 1, 2, King James and Kobe too
It was the day before Christmas day
I just put brand new rims on my sleigh
In the kitchen cooking, eggs and hash
I got a call from Blitzen talkin some trash, sayin

(Blitzen )
Oh saint Nicky, don’t you see
You and your boys you’ll never beat me
So you can tell Kobe and tell LeBron
That they can meet me on the court and it’ll be uh-uh onnnn

(Santa)
Now Blitz ice grillin, like put em up
It ain’t take long for Kobe to shut em up
(Kobe)
Alright Blitz, the game is to 10
LeBron, check it out and show em how we get it in
(Santa )
Now he all nervous, tension brewing
Vixen was trying to talk some sense into em
LeBron threw the ball and he began to giggle em, like

(LeBron)
Look at this reindeer, he can barely dribble
(Kobe)
C’mon Bron, show some respect
He got hooves, not hands, what the heck you expect

(Santa)
Kobe stole the ball, crossed him up
Runnin around his back, tossed it up
Vixen crying to Blitz, like

(Vixen)
Oh no, lebron took off from behind the free throw

(Santa)
LeBron rose up looked at him again
Said, Merry Christmas Blitz and shattered the rim

The game is over, the game is over
The game is over, the game is over
Dunking on the reindeer, dunking on the reindeer
Dunking on the reindeer, dunking on the reindeer
