[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
You know wassup now
I stroll through the underworld in my uptowns
Til im over the hill
I push touch downs
It's over, I'm healed
I put my crutch down
My vision is clear
The central divison is here
They should give him a flare
Give him a float
Then give him the floor
Just gimme my ye
Gimme a yard
I give u a year
Lean on the yacht cap/ lean on the yacht cat
Gimme ya oars/ gimme your yarn

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
Im rappin the gift
And the remedy dog
Its what I shimmy down ur chimneys for
Money drop
Ur pennies from the penthouse
Im fifty twenties from the twentieth floor
They waitin on the downfall
Of a g, like ground floor
But ima be like philly blunt
Right here like right ear
Grindin like ground beef til me and the ground meet
I get it crunk

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Over the hills and through the hoods we go
With the F to the I to the A S C O
FI-IIIIIIII-ASCO, hey
Where ya goin?
Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lupe

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
They should break in the company and take him in custody
For takin sumthin so basic and makin it uppity
So publicly so what if he hold something so stubbornly
So grudgingly up in here for something that he does so lovingly
From waitin in the basement so humbly so hungrily
Now its finna get so ugly, so utterly unpretty
So witty and so cunningly is he and there's no budgin me
Its like im next in line, theres no cuttin me
And its like I never next to nine
I never next in nine, well I never
Hold a rifle like motorcycle
You know, where bad chicks sit
Keep a nine around my waist, like ninja back seat
I mean I heat pack, like injured athlete
So sit on back, before she get on back

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Over the hills and through the hoods we go
With the F to the I to the A S C O
FI-IIIIIIII-ASCO, hey
Where ya goin?
Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lupe

[Verse 4 - Lupe Fiasco]
So as long as I'm right here and as long as there's nike airs
We gon' get it on as long as light years
Or as long as light's here, right here
You will last as long as a nice pair of white airs with slight care
In other words your career as long as dyke hair
Keep it right here, y'all ball fades
I'm all braids with white hair
All man from a cold land like white bears
And I don't wanna go back to the bike chair
Then send em back when the back of that dyke's there
It's Lu, player, well let me back up like endos back of the bikes in the air
But this ain't new years, mac out the window
So when you see this player limpin
With the passenger tucked, just follow procedure
Swallow your pride, and follow the leader

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Over the hills and through the hoods we go
With the F to the I to the A S C O
FI-IIIIIIII-ASCO, hey
Where ya goin?
