Its just the talk of the town
Coming from the mouth of the hood
The Jaws of Life
I bare arms
Crack my paws and write
Laws an rights
Rules an regulations
Tubes and medication
Fools who speculating
Did he leave it in his car?
Little did you know
You've been bleeding from the start
I ain't waiting on the shots
I'm leaving on ya mark
Get ready
5th steady
96 heavy
Wait (weight) nigga
Waste (waist) bigger
Aids slicker
Sharp niggas get head shots
Make flippers
Great whipper
Bavarian Motorola
My voice streams
Lakes, rivers
Constant
Keep spitting on the solders
If non sense is ya conscience
Your sitting on your shoulders
Wether Gucci loafing
Or walking on air
Sitting on mines or talking about theres

Verse two

I'm just playing my part
Life is a chick
Run my fingers through her hair
While she play in my part
And IM never ending
Cause I'm staying at start
Plus I need a vehicle to be conveying my thoughts

I am a purveyor of talk
Seller of words
Merchant of speak
Saying of thoughts
Player of soughts
But I can't walk you
Nor will I cross you
Never been a player of sports
You gota be upright to walk
Upnights to work
Down right to worship
Sunlights to dark
Down right converse
And they wonder what keeps me going
Like perpetual motion
Its just incredible devotion
And they telling you promotion
If you dont know what to say in flow
Just dont make a sound like the K in known/no
Listen to the hustler babble
Little dudes wanna tie me down like gulliver's travels
I got it mummified
They unraveled
Paper towels
Just thumb tacks and a run flat
I will not go down
Maintain my speed
Can not slow down
Stay in my seat like Rosa parks
He came back busing now ain't that something now
Ya wanna sit where he sit
But ya folding chairs that boy is ski lift
Ever since I crawled on the block
I been up there had to fall to the top
This my say in a cold baray
All a dude got like Jay cosea?
And im not letting it Go I mastered this
And gota keep spelling it out for yall like FABOLOUS
