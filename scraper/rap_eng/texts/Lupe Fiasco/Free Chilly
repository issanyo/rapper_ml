If we could break down those walls to set you free, we would
'Cause we're out here, and we miss you
If we could build a ladder that tall to come up and see you, we would
'Cause we're down here, and we miss you

[Refrain: Gemini & Sarah Green]
If we could break down those walls to set you free, we would
'Cause we're out here, and we miss you
If we could build a ladder that tall to come up and see you, we would
'Cause we're down here, and we miss you
