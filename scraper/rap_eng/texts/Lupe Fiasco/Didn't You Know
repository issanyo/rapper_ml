Whenever you tell me just how you feel
Holding on to a love someone real
You can't believe don't understand
Used to be so calm now you hold my hand
'Cause with every touch I feel it inside
And words can't even say it right
Don't be surprised what you felt for me
'Cause you knew my love was the only way
Didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Didn't you know, didn't you know what my love would do
Would do to you, didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Didn't you know nothing else would of ever matter to you but my love
All I ever use to do was just wait
So faithfully for the day you might say
You're all I want, all that I need
And I give you my heart my sincerity
I told you my love would never 'cause you pain
And the kiss of my lips remain such a pretty memory
Don't you know my love is a remedy
Didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Didn't you know, didn't you know what my love would do
Would do to you, didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Didn't you know nothing else would of ever matter to you but my love
I told you, I told you babe so many times
I would never hurt you, so why you acting so surprised
All you got to do is show me that you feel the same way I do
Same way I do when you know it's about me and you
Didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Didn't you know, didn't you know what my love would do
Would do to you, didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Didn't you know nothing else would of ever matter to you but my love
Didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Didn't you know, didn't you know what my love would do
Would do to you, didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Didn't you know nothing else would of ever matter to you but my love
Hey didn't you know
Didn't you know, didn't you know, didn't you know
Nothing else would of ever matter to you but
