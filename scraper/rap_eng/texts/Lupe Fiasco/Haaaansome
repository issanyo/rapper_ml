You're new in the game, you need that magic juice, magic shoes in the game
Whipping that coupe, yeah
That passenger could've been you, yeah
I know that you're sick, you're tossing and turning, it feels like a futon, yeah
I got my own spread, spending old bread like a (like a) like a crouton, yeah
I'm cutting them checks, you cutting your finger while cutting them coupons, yeah
And this could've been you hun, I'm like maaaan this could've been you, hun
Booking all of these flights, with an account I created with you hun
I know that I'm too wrong
I got passcodes, on my two phones
My passport, it's been drew on
And I’m looking for someone to poop on, yeah

[Chorus]


Super ashamed
Or maybe it's you, and I've just been used to the blame, yeah
I'm writing these poems, using the pain
And my whole crew entertain, yeah
Killing these beats and abusing the stage
Then they in school everyday
You told me to do it this way, no excuses this way, when I do it this way, yeah
I look in my closet like "who stock i'm boostin' today?"
Who bitch am I making blue in the face?
Have I gotten cruel in a waaaaayyy? (Yeah)
But I whip that coupe anyway
And my jeweler like "girl what you doing today?"
I'm like "Rodney just got his computer today, more than likely we 'bout to go stupid today", yeah
Plus I'm cool anyway
I don't say what I do but I do what I say
And listen, when I said I wasn’t the same, I was talking bout who I’ve been banging

[Hook]
