[Intro]
Nobody ever really loved loved loved loved
Me me me me me me me me…

[Verse 1]
She say she gotta do her nails and condition her hair
Find a pair of shoes and a fittin’ brasier
Slick shorty describe her description it’s fair
But say no other chick in this world can compare
And no other nigga got permission to stare
I say I never listen
Never mention I care
When they gone I never miss em
Never diss em a tear
Cause other women to fill that position is there
It’s the same game just a different affair
Different dame, different name, different distance from here
She say well things gon change
Now her mission is clear
Let her get off the phone and get off to homes
She knock on the door
It's business from there
Start strippin' her gear and switchin’ her rear
I'm not flinchin'
Cartier on my vision impaired
And enough ice
To condition the air
Now the boy got game and the girl got hurt
The boy got brains and the girl got worth
Cause the boy got fame
Do whatever he say
Now the boy get paged like every other day

[Refrain]
Nobody ever really loved me
It's just the birds and the bees
The her's and the he's
The his the ma’ams
The sirs and the she's
C’mon, c’mon
And u know this man
And if somebody ever loved me

[Verse 2]
She say she gotta get him dressed and hit him with rules
Feed ‘em breakfast and send ‘em to school
She say she need a rest her mind she finna lose
I tell her recline ke’ and just keep cool
She sick to her area her she fixin' to move
In physical fitness her own business
Can I get a witness, this chick is a jewel
And she tired of the things that I’m sendin’ her through
She say when I’m gon see you
And don’t say whenever, you
Know I won't leave you
But won't wait forever and
Got my own paper
And don’t take your cheddar
And no I'm not finished
I won't take the check
And I say chill you my winner from the door so
Step for set and dinner and a show
She say I be wearin' blue in the worst way
Don’t wear your chain, just the watch I bought for your birthday
Boy on the town and older woman down cause
Boy make her laugh when older woman sad
And older woman freak and he hold her ‘til she sleep
And he gotta send her flowers like every other week

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
She say she get off work at a quarter to nine
So don’t be late stop ignoring the time
Unless you got something more important in mind
Like wildin' wit them whores I’m filin' for divorce
I’ll see yo ass in court just send me child support she
Wanna get married and child wanna carry
My child, her smile, my ears in her belly
She even got Fias-wife typed in her cellie
She been there from the start she there from the heart
From the walk, to the bike, to the bus, to the cars
The flights and the kites the lonely lonely nights
From please leave on the lights when she was scared of the dark
And she got the pin if I ever hit the pen
I gotcha baby say I’ve got her crazy
Ever since that party at the Rex
I locked down her heart in cardiac arrest
Now the boy got a wifey and the wifey wanna ring
Cause she wanna be his wife
But the boy had it right
That you just ain’t ready
It's too early in your life
But whatever the weather that boy will have her ever

[Refrain]
