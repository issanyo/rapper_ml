[Intro: Jay Sean]
Oh Yeah baby

When we were young, we used to laugh about
Saying that we should run away, to a far and distant place
It was love, but nobody let us say that
Say that we were from two different worlds
And you were meant to be my girl

[Jay Sean - Hook & Verse 1]
And they couldn't stop us at all
God knows that they tried to
But I can’t deny or hide you
And then the same things crossed my mind
Then maybe we should get away
I’ve got one thing left to say
Girl if you with it, baby just say the word
We can pack our bags and run off into the night
There might be obstacles, some twists and turns
But we'll ride it together, girl just
Say Yeah, yeah, yeah

Girl, think about it
Cause we can take you to another level if you really want
And there ain’t no doubt about it
We ain’t getting any younger
So if you really wanna go there
Say the word, baby

And baby you stop us..
God knows that we tried
Ohh, they tried
But you know that I can’t
And then the same things crossed my mind (Crossed my mind)
Then maybe we should get away
So there’s just one thing, one thing left to say
Girl if you with it, baby just say the word (Say the word)
We can pack our bags and run off into the night
There might be obstacles (Said there might be obstacles)
Some twists and turns (And maybe some twists and turns)
But we'll ride it together, girl just (As long as you)
As long as you say

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Companions
Runnin' through the bombs and the canon
Flames in the rain and the dangerous challenge
Down for the cause, let’s donate to the famine
Live life alive, a reckless abandon
Which means that we never don’t care
Which is rare
From the foundation to the Phantom
From the moment that made us, ‘till death separate us
Everything in between is dedicated to the greatest
Hopefully never
But if we ever, become sick, we’re so close together
We can medicate to a status that’s better
In the midst maybe even set a record
Get Lupe on on the verse, then Jay on the rest of it
And put it on at the slightest displeasure
And take you back to the back where we started this endeavour
Huh

[Jay Sean - Hook & Outro]
Girl if you with it, baby just say the word (Ohh just say the word)
We can pack our bags and run off into the night (Into the night)
There might be obstacles (Said there might be obstacles)
Some twists and turns
But we'll ride it together, girl just (We'll ride it out, we'll ride it out)

Girl if you with it, baby just say the word (Just say the word)
We can pack our bags and run off into the night (We can pack our bags)
There might be obstacles (Oh there might be obstacles)
Some twists and turns
But we'll ride it together, girl just

Girl just Say Yeah

All you gotta do is say, say, say, Say Yeah
Girl whatever you want
