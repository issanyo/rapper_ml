We flying high
Higher than the sky
Way over the bullshit yeah we on some new shit yeah
We flying high
Higher than the clouds
We stay above the drama and we ain't coming down yeah
We flying high
Higher than the sky
Way over the bullshit yeah we on some new shit yeah
Flying high
Higher than the clouds
We stay above the drama and we and comin down yeah

[Verse 1: Honors English]
Why am I so fly?
Here'a crash course
My photo should be the logo for the passports
And when they ask for my pictures rumors fly like twisters
But it don't matter I just walk on top of the whispers
Look at the women or the denim
Look at my eyes see the sky dives in em
And my girl so fly, me and her futuristic
They sick of me shining so I just eclipse shit
But darling, all them
Hate to see you soaring
Can't wait, they love to take pictures when you're falling
We all got problems, but when they start pouring
It have a brother feelin like a bucket in New Orleans
But when it gets heavyweight, all I do is levitate
Over all the drama like Bush when the levee's break
Damn to be honest, bad news is time flies
Good thing is you're the pilot, yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And now appearing on behalf of his homeboy
Locoist, soloist in a lane all on his own boy
Photo this as I ocho this they don't know what I'm on boy
It is 8, ate is eat got a stomach full of songs boy
Call us hear that plane food
Runnin on that plain fuel
Walkin on the sky now
Yoda must've trained lu
His shoes got them wings to
Feathers on his sandals
Weathers where he hang fool
Not where they send rain to
But where you can wear sandals
L.A.X.ing like the airport in the city of Los Angelessss....
Yea but Im from that O.R.D
Playa you can't play with that
Global service verses
And you know that I don't pay for bags
But I keep my paper tagged
Just in case they lose it I'll always get my paperback
This ain't even hard for me this more like paperback
This is that, history book my planes up out the pages rap

[Verse 3: Honors English]
We Flyin High
And beyond I'ont plauteu a keep goin
They'ont want me to peak like a Peeping Tom you see it
It's a natural reflex the b.s. I deflect I got it sewn
But I don't seem stressed (seamtress) peep it
This is for my little leaguers playing trying to get their majors on
So they be an umpire and they have a plate at home
Play it safe, naw, naw, life is like a song
Take the bullshit by the horns smooth it out like..uhhhh
I'm like a hawk with his middle fingers up
If you don't move it you lose it and your wings turn to dust
So I don't fuck around, I hover above the ground
I just tackle my goals and that's how I touch down
But I'm still upward bound, so the kids huddle round
This is soul medicine no side effects evident ...uhhhh
You gotta rise from living this low life
Time to stop being fraid of your own heights! Yeah!
