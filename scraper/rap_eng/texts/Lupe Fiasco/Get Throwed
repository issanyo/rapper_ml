[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
My name, L-U-P that trill nigga
Lean on me like Bill Withers
I’m a shark fin you a seal flipper
No liquor, no weed, no pills nigga
Still I feel I still iller
Cat burglar with the skills nigga
No codeine, old lean, still ODing and I cod I still with you
Feel like a film, you a still picture
No movement, I’m a movie screen
On syrup, no sir, did it all sober like Gucci Mane
From showing off I do refrain
But in the v12 I do be staying
On the low yes I do remain
But I can pull up more autos like 2 T-Pains
2 Kanyes, 2 Lil Waynes, 5 good watches
3 good chainz
Please don’t think that it’s coochie mane
My heart running cold like choo choo trains
Trae Tha Truth and Bun B, they my kinfolk
All my friends fuck a fan from the intro
Been dope since the dog in the trench coat
Now you gotta try and keep them off of this flow
Like I just swept, and I just mopped
And it’s still wet, so you﻿ better not
I’m a macbook, I go anywhere
And you can’t go, you’re a desktop
So, I know exactly where to find y’all
You can find me too, all you gotta do
Is follow all the foot prints that I left in your Pine-Sol

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Good weed, good drank, big money, man
Rolling in something foreign no leather, grippin
I handle my business, so I think I deserve to get throwed
Get throwed, throwed, throwed

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
Leanin' to the left, keep a deuce in my linen, man
Time money, what I just call it, call it minute made
All I do is ball like the ‘Stros off in Minute Maid
So I rock diamonds like the field, that's Minute Maid
Renegade, Em and Jay, real nigga anyway
So I’m gettin' money homeboy that’s plenty paid
I got racks on racks, that’s stacks on stacks
While you broke ass niggas lookin' sad gettin' penny paid
Out rappin' these square ass niggas like burritos
So I see chips, y’all niggas see Cheetos
Ben Franks on me, plus Jacks like Tito
Them other niggas fly, but they ain’t fly as me though
Got wings, hot wings, Superman, where my cape at
On like phones, goddamn I know they hate that
I’m a bad boy so my pockets lookin' Puffy like ?
I rap a lot like J and his son named Jas, I make good music like Kanye jams
So I’m taking off like a runway fast, in that new model, that’s runway cash
SS Chevy, sittin' on 4's
I got a stomachache, I’m shittin' on hoes
For my 20's, still pouring that shit up
Iron Man chest, chain got my shit lit up

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Good weed, good drank, big money, man
Rolling in something foreign no leather, grippin
I handle my business, so I think I deserve to get throwed
Get throwed, throwed, throwed

[Verse 3: Twista]
I got a million flows in my arsenal
Take a listen I will spit at you a bar or 2
I could come with something simple or more instrumental so coming up with the lyrics will be hard to do
So intricate with my rock out can make you catch a ? can make her listen what that nigga doing ? saying damn a nigga flowin
? coming up with a predicate they feeling me i’m a human encyclopedia
I keep it low-key instead of acting like a clown in front of the public cause I dont the like the media
But I come with the piff, and the heat and the shit and crack
My flow arsenic, methamphetamine, cocaine, anthrax

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Good weed, good drank, big money, man
Rolling in something foreign no leather, grippin
I handle my business, so I think I deserve to get throwed
Get throwed, throwed, throwed
