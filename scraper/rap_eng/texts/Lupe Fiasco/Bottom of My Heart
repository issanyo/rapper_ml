[Verse 1]
You know it's so hard
I never freeze, sleeves rolled back like Walmart
Had bigger steez, I put in work get better shirts with better sleeves
Hit roll back like reverse when I'm putting in work for cheddar cheese
Now I'm pushin' my worth
I'm a hustler covered in letter Gs and they looking to search for something they'll never see
I invented the set, a digital pet the way I be touching keys
Pushing work like I'm pushin' the worth of having a job
Like six an hour or ninety a key, a value of a nine to five is how you decide to thrive
Whether flipping powder or having to rob, like you was mixing flour or having it hard
Now it's ninety an hour when I'm trafficking, y'all, traveling dog
And even when I rap up in arms

[Hook]
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun

[Verse 2]
You see I win y'all
Where I am, where I been y'all
Can't really relate like in-laws
Where money is money, money is menthol
But money don't mean nothin', money has been y'all
See I been where its been rats like Ben who be singing like Sammy Davis
You know, ratting like Sammy when they in the bullpen
I could never do that
Not even if I was Tommy Davidson
But I feel like Sosa, I be running base and swinging like Sammy with different {?]
Hurley with the same dime, I be cuttin' base
This a lot to pour in, this is for the slicker hustlers
The quicker picker-upers
I could never spill the beans, Uncle Same never seen a dime
You could never fill the jeans, the seams
I got Big Punishers in-seams

[Hook]
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun

[Verse 3]
It's the remarkable, marketable marvel
The Afro-American martial over this track of marvels
You aught to call martial arts enthusiast
Uzi is tucked in clothing articles
You see us marching through, me and my partners, my marksman, my arsenal
Starting arson with a fuse used for starting barbecues
I squeeze at your grill, heave at the wheel
'Cause niggas get gassed up and crash, it's bad
All of that adds up to ash
Niggas don't know the half of any other amount of math
It adds up to ask us to ask
What? I been knowin'
Fingernails and knuckles, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
If you don't know then you don't know what you talkin' 'bout
The hazards on, the caution's out, no walkin' out

[Hook]
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun
From the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs
From the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue
From a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums
From the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun
