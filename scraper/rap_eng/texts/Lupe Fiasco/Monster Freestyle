[Lupe Fiasco]
I set it off
Yeah, I let it off
Uh, uh, uh
You wearing off
Your effects on the industry is fading
And Lupe be great
Fiasco is playing
I'm blazing, and stepping through the scene so heavenly
And they so not ready for me
Readily, I come through and break the game down
Yeah, I take your name down
As well I'm graffiti artist writing over your name
I feel like slam, feel like damn
I be the man so exactly, practically
Rapping over everything that's spat to me
You could see it coming, if you don't, if you don't then that's bad
But L-U-P make the whole game feel sad
Make the game go mad so insane
I'm filming
Feel like illegitimate children building
Uh, and see I do it hard
See my flow naked as the WorldStar girls are
Play it, and we can do it big
And Semtex blow it up
And Lupe is the kid
And Sway is the homie
You got nothing for me, if they try
Either back up, clack up, clap up, pull the mac up and clap up
Anybody try'na pull the strap up get dapped up
Or might just get wrapped up in the carpet
And thrown down the hill, for real
And L-U-P sure got skills
But take off the "S", I kills
And put it on the end
And begin, you'll never win stepping to them
The tag team duo, Nuo
You should've do that 'for you came through
Uh, I'm so fluid like fluoride in the water make you dumb
And we can do it like, E-40, say shorty
They don't want none and they ain't got nothing for me
Don't step into my party unless you got a vest on
Cause I'm throwing shots from the DJ booth
And taking off my roof in my Ferrari when I step through
Yes you, you could try it if you want
God bless you
I hope that you don't die after this freestyle
And I'll be rocking out in the meanwhile
Uh, see I feel like OGs now
Uh, and I used to be a YG
Rest In Peace Esco
My brother much love
I hope God bless you up above
Uh, see I'm stepping like a cuz
And I'm walking like a Crip
But I'm feeling like a Blood
Yeah, but I'm like a GD
Feeling like a Vice Lord
Players can't see me
And I don't wanna be Big Meech or Larry Hoover
I wanna be Martin Luther King, Jr
Yeah, see that's BMF Freestyle
Revamped we the champs
We stamp through like elephants
Intelligent rap is so irrelevant
See we don't deal with the nonsense
We constant
Constantly bombing over things that we bring constant
Conscious, championship rapper
Feel like were
I'm feeling like Tottenham, like a hot spur
And you could get a hot splash in your face
Uh, bring it from the blast off the waist
From my blast in the pace
L-U-P in the piece
Peace
[Sway]
I need a peace of the beat
It's Mr Sway DeSafo, I never meet defeat
I'm here with Lupe - happy birthday
Lazer drop, it's gonna be their worst day
It's Mr Sway DeSafo, keep moving
Every freestyle I say I keep on improving
But I ain't gonna freestyle all of the of the head, I gotta hit them with a verse too
Mr Derrick Safo, all of his splendour
I don’t smoke kush but I'm quick to forget ya
I remembered, I am that kush and you other rappers couldn’t get a puff if you were Skepta
Listen, I'm only hired by the best star
I got your boss behind a desk like "guess what?"
Call me the hit man, I'm lining up the red dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot et cetera
Ha, you little dames ain't gonna head nah
Nah ain't like a doc-doc-doc, I'm a professor
Welcome to my lecture
You will be here forever, cause my books of raps is way too thick to get past
Something like Cee-Lo in a narrow alley
No Bruno, but the flow is out of this world, forget Mars
Sway, the way I'm shock-shock-shocking them
I should'a been signed to Electra-zzz
Super Swah, you rappers can't see me
Bar Lupe, bar Drake, bar Weezy
See I'm an African, I got my own language
Give me mulla mulla - that’s some Swahili
I said beats, I double them easy, burn them easy, got the burner and hate to copy those CDs
Ah shoot, I mean sue
I don’t promote violence but F with DCY will have you in a 3 piece-piece-piece
Take this opportunity to say, Lupe’s got an album on the way; retweet
The freestyle games revolting, I go so in it's insulting
And to throw salt in the wounds
True stories, I rap of the head like sultans
Welcome to Agrabah, cause I am Jafar, it’s about to go down
Deeper than Billy's ocean but I will never drown
And I think you’ve found the next seal, mark my face
But I ain't kissing no roses, unless it's Roses Gabor
I went off track, I'm trick
Now watch me bring it back, Pac Shakur
I think I was talking about Guns 'n' Roses, and Seals - that’s it
I'll make the Mac pack push off, Postman's back, you don’t want it like Shador
Ill let the letters box you that’s how I back my tour
They come at me with bull but I'm El Savador
I'm a lion, you’re a pussy - that’s a different cat-tegory
I'm comfy in my seat, they coming for so
Comfortably I read, it's DCY - they're telling me sell shares
But man is only known by the company he keeps
I'm my boss, it's time to find a Mosque
Pray like a prophet, so I can recover my loss
Going out to all the haters thinking I'm soft
You need to keep your distance cause you’re a mile off
Figure how to box Semtex, pass my gloves and a cloth
Just in case I need to wipe some smiles off
I take them in twos, I Ant and Dec, yeah breaking the rules and
Taking their papers stripes off
Damn right man, you're right, it ain't the twos
[?]
It's Mr Sway and Lupe and we’re out here and we doing it all-time, every single year
S1 extra, ain't 1 better
Mr Sway DeSafo
