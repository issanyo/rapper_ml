[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Billy Blue]
I just keep it real nigga, fundamentals
If she ain't got no chill, give her fundamentals
She ain't got no problems, she got fundamentals
Niggas need some dollars, they need fundamentals
G-code, G-code, G-code nigga, fundamentals
Keeping it a hunnid, that's so fundamental
If you ain't got no money, stick to fundamentals
That's the key to life, nigga, fundamentals

[Verse 1: Billy Blue]
Boy, I pick up when I call now stick to fundamentals
Playing with my gangstas, now that ain't the type of shit I'm into
Ridin' with that .44 loaded, cause that shit's essential
Mess around me, I, nigga, squeeze a bullet in your temple
How you trapping? You ain't got no cash nigga
But you got them J's, you's a ass nigga
You ain't paying bills, ain't got no stash nigga
Your stupid ass ain't learned from the last nigga
Stick to fundamentals, key to life ain't sentimental
(?) governmental, that is not coincidental
Keep your life confidential, niggas watching incidentals
Making it past twenty one in my hood, that is monumental

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
May you die a death of like a hundred pistols
If you out here faking on your flex and being unofficial
Careful what you wear and where you are and who you running into
Think it's accidental then a nigga sent to come and get you
Bitches wanna play, I tell them it's essential
Tell that bitch don't say no more, be instrumental
Pull up in the car, it better not be no rental
Unless you out here serving, then my nig', continue
I can see it in you that you got potential
If you take the time, you will get credentials
We ain't got no patience for no imitations
Well, I know innovations see my demonstrations
