[Verse 1]
Gangsta Gangsta Gangsta Gansta
F-I Westside Chi-Town Thank Ya
Moms and Pops what drove me crazy
Spice-1, Twista, Biggie, Jay Z (Yeah)
Inspirings for writing in my spiral
Then put violence into firing like opposite of hiring
Cause weren't nobody hiring
They packin the four fifth
Back to tacting, sink your warships
Climbs your walls invade your fortress
From battling and hassling from samplings from rapping
And I'm trackling off Madison to trafficking in-to trampling
He be, easy, back again
Focused attacking them, the unbelievable
It's a mack back here like (???)
Don't be fooled by the packaging
I'm back to school like September
L-U-P Emperor

[Hook]
Suspects falling gangstas ride (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
Ladies ballas, haters hide (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
F-N-F is major now (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
Don't you love it it's just I (Lean Nigga Lean Nigga)
This is how we get down

[Verse 2]
Jump!
Put your lighters in the air it's a fighter in stare
How you gonna escape If I set fire to the stairs?
How you gonna equate us it's like a hare compared to a lair full of lions tigers and bears
You don't like sharing his the (???) the medium rare, the well. Well you're in there
They think they gonna take me off of their square (Nah-Uh)
But I am far from a Now and Later rapper (wrapper)
Down to take a matter back up to with clappers
From tapping young trapper don't get caught up in my snare
Far from a producer dawg
Every block that you set up I'm will shut down
Turn your computers off, It's surprising though
Flow so wired requires tying to a chair
Somebody better come and get it cause I'm about to kill it
Just enough for every city and village to feel  it

[Hook]
Suspects falling gangstas ride (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)

F-N-F is major now (Lean Nigga, Lean Nigga)
Don't you love it it's just I (Lean Nigga Lean Nigga)
This is how we get down

[Verse 3]
Yeah!
This is how we get down this is how we get down
Like a top floor fire and I found the fire escape to get to the ground
I'm a top floor fire give em a pound
Sho'nuff respect to the young upset
The three at the buzzer hand to the fam
Sleeves of a hustle
He's ever upper
Crust, trust, sucker free like doctor visits
Wasa is it? Yup, Yuck Sickening
Tipping, Tipping, Tipping, Tipping
Chi-Town's rhetoric for getting it
Listen, lift them off the flow off we go
Piffin, recording, give em gore
Ninety-Two Bulls, Jordan's, Pippen
Welcome, cross em, caught you slipping
Off to the bucket don't make me un-tuck yeah!
