[Verse 1]
Say is this home
Widely received, whenever I touchdown
Call me Young Touchdown, nothin' deeper than the end zone
I had a good year, like the blimp Ice Cube's a pimp on
I lips poem, the same blocks where I made everything rock like Flintstones
Drop with the rims on, clock with the gemstones
Can't call it like blocks on a Sprint phone
Flow incredible, remember, L-U-P-Emperor
Nickname December, move birds like winter
Mind on my tender, move words like verb
Drop lines like "enter"
Go on and get it Crunk
I ain't really gotta jump like centers
Wait, while you popping and panicking
Peep the demeanor that I'm standing in
Unfazed like I'm mocking a mannequin
Don't think its fluff cause the pampering
I'm still ruff like the unpaid man
Like the unpaved Madison
Straight where I stay like dogs that don't move
Obedient school made me so cool
I was so unruly
I used to chase cars, run behind female dogs
Wouldn't sit with shit
Now you cats can't move me

[Verse 2]
I'm a chaser
And niggas tryin' to take me off my paper
Like erasers
Let me put you on to somethin'
All I got is the other end for them
And their brother men that wanna get it bubblin'
It's nothing
So be clear
Like I'll pretend that me here
Not just help a friend, believe it
But if you feel you need it
Then I can be your last one like Jesus
With the ease to speak your English
You could be as hard as sign language with no fingers
Drama for the Domas, sky it so it lingers
And you'll never forget, like elephants
Thought you had yourself a slippa, like Cinderella prince
But instead you got yourself pimpa
Who wasn't hesitant to help yo limp like impotence Jack
Viagra to be more exact, Emperor to Emgera
Perhaps I rap to much on the issue
It's back to my ritual
We'll be back
If I happen to miss you
Clappin' the pistol
Burning like clap when you piss dude
Laughin' a little
