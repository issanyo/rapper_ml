Mr. Chad Hugo, you know and Lupe and Alicia

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I know you wanna leave like Lillian
So lets gon' get up out the city then
And leave it all behind like Gideon's
And when we get there, their like "it's them again?"
Well it's me there all the time stop visting
Like we committed a crime and now we in the pen
And there's no parole, it's life sentencing
I know its sounds like potential wife senitiments
But then again
We ain't got to go to prison just to get it in
I can get you out of your division ten
That bars for my windy city citizens
Even though the vision photo of the women in, dont let it get you down
Never givin in, in the end its temporary like henna and
Push the felling now, bring the feeling in

[Alicia Keys]
This is my love letter to you (paradise), you're the only way I can get away
You are (paradise)
My escape everyday

Here's my love letter to the beat
I leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat
We have three minutes more
So move me my body's here for you to have
Thrill me cause this may be my only chance to be crazy
You dont need permission to free me
Cause that's what I need you to do

You're the only one who understands me
I can be myself
Do anything that I want to baby
In this moment nothing can stop me
Do you hear me

This is my love letter to you
(paradise)
Your the only way I can get away
You are (paradise)
My escape everyday
Here's my love letter to the beat
Leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat we have two minutes more

Times like this call for desperate measures and everything else is out of control this is the only place I can go
You're my sweet paradise
My sweet escape and I wanna thank you
Cause as long as this song is on see

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, and we gon' get your bounce back
Run up in the bank make em give your house back
Take over the scene look at how we house that
Black card kisses can't leave your house without that
No, can't leave your mouth without them
Them right in front of them I doubt we about that
Balance I know they wonder how we found that
A challenge but look how we came about that
So tell them that you're on vacation
I read your letter and your playstation
Thats the p.s. that you use when you're reiterating
Its says you need ventilation
You're kind of blue and you need inspiration taken away from the place that you're placed in
A destination is waiting for you its a whole 'nother level we'll be taking it to, Lu

[Alicia Keys]
You're the only one who understands me I can be myself
Do anything that I want to baby
In this moment nothing can stop me you do you hear me
This is my love letter to you

Here's my love letter to the beat
I leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat
Until the beat is no more
Love letter to the beat
Move my body 'round
Love letter to the beat until the music stops

Here's my love letter to the beat
I leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat
Until the beat is no more
Love letter to the beat
Move my body round
Love letter to the beat until the music stops

Love letter to the beat
Love letter to the beat
Love letter to the beat
