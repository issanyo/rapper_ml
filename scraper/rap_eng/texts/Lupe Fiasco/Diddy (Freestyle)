Oh boy!
It is him again
Lupe Fiasco
1st & 15th niggas
Chitown, holla
You know

Im from them hard blocks
Give moon roofs to hard tops
They want me to turn it off like jar tops
But I get it up, like alarm clocks
In foreign spots, heroin rocks, the wrong drops?? who waaant shots
Im on the court, most niggas is commentary
Dont play ya self like solitaire
I been through, most niggas is honorary
I play the storm like halle berry
Put you in monastaries for that monetary NO!
Leave you cryin in pain
What I gotta scream for hold 9 iron while Im drivin a range
You talk like I fold or somethin
Like I dont flip birdie hold eagle that'll put a hole-in-one
I'll give you cadillacs, full of apple jacks, this metal claps, this battle axe, benjamins baby
You wash the tub like tracy addlap
With my gun I produce the cali like Battlecat
You can't, handle that, ONE!

Get lost niggas
Be gone niggas

Yooo! fiasco
Holla back niggas!
