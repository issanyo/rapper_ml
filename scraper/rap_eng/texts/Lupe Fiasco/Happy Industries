*to the beat of Gorillaz' "Feel Good Inc.*

[Lupe Fiasco]
Once upon a time not long ago
An idea, yeah, that's what I had
To take "Demon Days" and a little Pro Tools
With my MCing ways and make them mash
Just having fun not chasing cash
Apologize now if it make you mad
Had to call G Ball, tell him warm up the mic
Put the padding on the wall, time to make some magic
Studio is nothing lavish
Matter of fact, it's just an attic
Background noise from the fan
That hitting the mic stand and the outside traffic
Still turns out fantastic
Turn my vocals up just a tad bit
Fresh from the 1st & 15th
Quarantine touching you, super cool, now that's sick

[Hook: Gorillaz]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Learn forever hand in hand
Take it all, let on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Lupe Fiasco]
So sit on back and enjoy the show
Then lean on forward and enjoy some more
And then, sit back again
And keep on enjoying like you was enjoying before
Whether you enjoy the beats or enjoy the flow
As long as you enjoying it, it bring joy to Joe
And Joe is me but woe is me
If you and yours ain't enjoying the show
So, don't worry about the time it take
If you ain't got one better find a date
A beautiful inside or a dime that take
I proudly present to you +A Rhyming Ape+
My rhymes are straight
If you ain't got one better find a date
A beautiful inside or a dime that take
I proudly present to you +A Rhyming Ape+
