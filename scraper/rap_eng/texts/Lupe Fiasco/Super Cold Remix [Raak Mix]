[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Cold blooded, chilly skin
Can't touch it like your front wheel when it's Wheely-ing
Wanna see Chilly free like Free Willy friend
Wanted to see Free Willy really swim
I'm super cold, my jacket thin
I'm two below like a marching band
That means I'm super-deep, you surface skim
I'm the whole thing, you niggas 2%
Put em up on that carton, I think I'm losing em
Bring all those St. Bernards in
Let's get some booze in them
You know them dogs with them barrels on they neck
And I'mma keep it cool like airholes on a Tec
I be moving birds like the scarecrow's on the set
Part dope-ass nigga, an old man winter
Christmastime diamond singing carols on my chest
Step up off the jet
Looking like a Pharaoh in the flesh

[Gilbere Forte]

Let em know
Im super cold, im super cold
[Please let them know]
Im super cold
[Please let them know]
I'm super cold

This life we made for us

[Asaad]
Going going going gone
Phil Rizutto flow, politics as usual
At home in my zone like an eskimo at 2 below
Good could be better, still I wish I knew what I know
Super cold, freezer burn, ugly and beautiful
Been in my zone for days, fortune favors the brave
Talent outshines hype, and hard work always pays
My mood is taupe melange, the sky's Obama gray
The flow is carolina blue, I wear b/red 1s every day
I'm super cold
Free Chilly, Free Haas, Free Jimmy
Free Big Meech, Free Tony
The flow is swell, Free Willy
A long way from a snot nose
Free lunch and two pennies
I'm taking it to the Moon
And I'mma let them know I'm from North Philly
I'm with Liva and it's ironic
Super cold, Nostalgic
My bad bitch is cold hearted
Phoebe Philo rockin
Color temperature climate
You ask how I describe it
Hood meets Antartic
I'm out of here, Harry Kalas

[Gilbere Forte]

Let em know
Im super cold, im super cold
[Please let them know]
Im super cold
[Please let them know]
I'm super cold

This life we made for us

[Ab-Liva]
I'm super cold, In my Louboutins
Under Phillip Lims
What's them bitches? Super thin
Tag along with a superstar
See the car that I'm cruising in
The Coupe's color banana pudding
The same exact one the proof is in
Blinded by that glare off of that spotlight that they view us in
Mandarin - Oriental, Red Eye--they flew us in
She half black, Speak Spanish
She Afro and Peruvian
Gansevoort, Sofitel, K West and we lose it in
Like you pretend
But the bow on the hood of the 2 door crept up with the bluest tint
I'm flying off, wings out
Burning down, foolish sin
Love hurts, brush 'em off
Once again, drew em' in
Once again, this cold flow
I jotted down with my super pen
One man, All this power
Feeling like I'm a super fiend
Been a while, I'm working hard
It's my time, I'm moving in
Only God knows, my arms raised
Just waiting on him to just cue me in
The best writer, hands down
I'm blacking out, nigga, rufilin

[Let 'em know]
Im super cold, im super cold
[Please let them know]
Im super cold
[Please let them know]
I'm super cold

This life we made for us
You're never gonna take it
