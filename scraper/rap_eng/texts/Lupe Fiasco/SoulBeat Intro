[Verse: Davis Absolute]
The first thought should be profound as ever
Clever and well really
But when it get put together
So I present you with this
You're forgiven
And not by me, no never what I dream
To place myself in a position of such esteem
I speak about the God of all, King of all kings
Clean blood shed to make us redeemed
Washed my sight clean
Reason that I breathe for the prophets to uplift the truth
The Fountain of Youth
Put the water on the Bread of Life
Broken body spilled blood that carried mine
I mean you, I mean us, I mean we
The Man with the touch to rise the dead off of their feat
A coal of the [?] the world brings
I pray for the day that He shakes us from sleep
I, I know the day's coming soon
Rain of fire, red bloody moons
[?] never grips simply because of you
Far from blind faith plus He healed the blind to
Cemented, back torn from whips
Hung on the cross, power ended with the thought, it didn't
So how little am I asked to be committed
Guilty of so much in a moment was acquitted
Only did I need to accept what's been given
I did
I know our positions soul living
That even after I pass I'll be living
So I say it again
You're forgiven
And not by me, no never what I dream
To place myself in a position of such esteem
I speak about the God of all, the King of all kings
Clean blood shed to make us redeemed

[Hook: Davis Absolute]
I know, I know, I know
That You're watching me
Keep watching me
Lord I swear I'll make You proud
Make You proud of me
Make You proud of me
Make You proud of me
Lord I'm gonna make You proud
