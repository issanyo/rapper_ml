[Verse 1]
Physically here, mentally I’m up there somewhere
And I been thinkin' bout maybe comin' down and hang around on the ground some year
But this ain't the one, no
Havin' too much fun way up here on the Sun, yo
They should really sell my CD's at the gun show
A two-disc set is like Russian Roulette
Afghanistan Keno
If you wanna win then come in my casino
Pull up in a Porsche
Pull off in a Dino
Convention on Ascension, I’m deliverin' the keynote
Rise, and shine too
Kiwi I can see me in reflections from my fine shoes
I write with the same techniques they use to find jewels
Mine my own mind until I find something that rhymes cool
Then hit James on line two tell him to send a track for me to rhyme to
A setting to attach all of the shine to
A diamond mine/mind I can never Swarovski or rhine you

[Refrain: Elle J]
Wanna know wanna know why you’re breaking even
Wanna know wanna know why you’re breaking down

[Verse 2]
Perfect Big Bang flow
Spittin' out uni(verses), my old metaphors went off and joined the circus
They currently on tour on the planet of the Word-smiths
You can rally round me like I'm Sturgis
But when you go back to where you came from don't tell nobody that you ever heard this
Or I might bless you with my curses, thinner
You should change your attitude or Hannibal is having you for dinner
Cannibalistic urges eating up this nonsense regurgitating purpose
World done perfect
Mind so spotless like they Spic and Span’d and mopped it
It’s just clear it don't mean that they washed it
Put it together like bolts swing nuts and washers
We beefin’ like Big Macs and Whoppers
At each other’s throats like butterfly collars
Or Siamese twins joined at the Medulla Oblongata
In a tuxedo
Going to the opera
Diamond mine mind only C-Z about me though is my initials
Zulu, Chaka, pow

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
You protect it you cherish and caress it
Your precious little ethic-less method
Been tryin' take me off of my perspective
But I respect it
But I still give you F's for effort
And the A's for me
Extra credit
How I deflected all praises be
To the most higher I admire
Never will I abide by you
Cause you're liar and you’re not my sire
Can't buy me I just ride by you
And I won't bye-bye you
I'll buy ya lighter and set it on fire
