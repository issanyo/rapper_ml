[Verse 1]
Watch out for the divide and conquer
There lies the monster behind the suit & tied lies
Who love that super-sized mantra
Bigger, better even if you don't need it
And you gone pay every which way for the privilege to poison yoself
And that's on every hole Jesus had to bleed with
Peace be upon him
You see you can't have a healthy tree if the seed sick
Though yo forest will be enormous, that illness will never leave it
"God ain't American!" so says Jessica CareMoore
Therefore there's more there for me to prepare for
And I can't get to heaven just by joining the airforce
I reflect on everything Baldwin ever taught me
When I had to fall back on Zinn when Noam Chomsky lost me
When Cornell stood up for me when everybody fought me
And find comfort in rebellion even though I know what it'll cost me
Let's be clear, I fear no man on this here planet
My younger hunger back and the only thing I fear is ham on this here sandwich
