[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah
In my hot ride with my hair long
And my hair bone and my Vans on
Must transform like a robot, or watch
Oh no pops, off his top all day long
Like my head and my dreads
Cut your head off on this song
Wanna play with him, don't play with him
Can't fuck around if you don't stay with him
And that's my house and I house that
And you ain't with that cause you ain't 'bout that
You ain't 'bout it 'bout it, you ain't Master P
I'm a master nigga, you in back of me
And that's reverse, don't rehearse
On this verse, it's off the top
This freestyle from the chee chow
From the west side, from the C-H-I
That F-I and that murder rate
And that ? cast, no bird
That birth rate, tryin' to rise that
And my documentary's like NASDAQ
And my stock risin', your stock fall
? she got the Glock dog
Uh, ? and no blood and no gang
I ain't no crip, but I'm so OG
Them niggas know, that's why they hang
Like a hangman or a noose, aw, but I'm too long
I'm the front of the train and the caboose
Homes, I'm all of that
On this track, did you get that there?
It's like railroadin', it's underground
And you can hear when the storm comin'
That lightening strike and that thunder sound, uh
When the bass drop, and you know I do that like Batman
When the cake drop, or like Superman
Flyin' through the sky, can't take shots
Y'all take shots, but no liquor, just bounce off
My chest nigga, Lupe!
Like Oliver Stone, my movie, so groovy
And I ooh-op like two shots, uzi

[Verse 2]
Lupe came through the hood, so you know I show him love
Forty-five on my chest just in case a nigga touch
