[Verse 1]
Now all your outsides are in a rush
And all your insides are out of touch
And then you realize, Real lives
Life, the idea dies
And the crush, pulverized into dust
And the poltergeist rises up
Under the hill lies
Now lies us
Cut lady luck knives didn't gassed us up

[Hook]
Cause your pleasure is painful
Yeah you know, you know, you know
Well it's worse
Cause you don't know
Just how much it...

[Verse 2]
I'm writing you
In spite of you
The conflict rests inside of you
Dividing you
Devour you
Defeating and de-power you
Depleting and deflower you
Revolutions waiting on the hour to
Expose all of the weakness of the powerful
Redefine uncomfortable
Is currently the question
And the suffering
The famous nameless angels are up under you
Your happiness is killing me
The fantasy and fantasize
Insanity romantically are

[Hook]
Pleasure is painful
Yeah you know, you know, you know
Well it's worse
When you don't know
Just how much it hurts... (x7)

[Outro]
Your happiness is killing me
Your happiness is killing me
Oh...
*Gasp*
