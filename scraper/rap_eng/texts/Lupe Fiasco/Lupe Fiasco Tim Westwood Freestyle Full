[Verse 1]
I feel a little bit forgiven, Thank God
Allow me this day
I feel so high when I be living
They can’t stop me, know how
Uh uh, no way
I don’t play, me and Tim, me and him
We rocks out, L U P do that
No shoes, just some socks out
Relaxing in the club, DJ’ing
Playbacking, everything that I do
They don’t know what happen
They be trying, I deny them at the bucket I say fuck it
If they want it than they love it
If they don’t than they can suck it
And, what I mean by it
You should re-try it
I’m on my Dean, you be on a dean-diet
And I dont even like it
Everytime you rap it, I swear I close my eyes
I wish I could close my ears from this racket
I ain't having it, I tennis while you bin it
I stay on it, I strong as Popeye with some spinach
You as long as short something
You be tryna ten it see
I ain't going HAM, I’m going bacon, going pig
I’m going whole cow, look at me, what I did
You wish you could, but you just kid
I’m a grown man on it, my own man on it
Come in your house, now your home damn haunted
See everybody dead, bullet holes in the head
But I ain't kill em, I hit em with the flow instead
My flow like bullets, they like hollow tips
I wish you would if you could, if you would try it
But you can’t so back to denying the
They be lying ah
I be so up on my truthless and I’m so ruthless
Ferrari top down yeah I got like four of those
And my Ferrari so clean it got four doors
Only got two LUP on that new shit
New Ferrari 400i, that blue kit
So I got my rims and my watch and my rings on
Yeah I got my bling on
Go ahead and sing songs
If you want I tell no tales and no lies
I drop no dimes on my homies
I keep them alive behind the bar
Shout to Chilly chill, I’m so really real
And the streets so deep, you wish that I wasn’t but I am cousin
God damn he be buzzing
No weed no liquor, MD offa something
See my brain just flows and see just how I goes
And I’m from Chicago and I’m letting niggas know
You can cut it out and scratch it or baste it
Or send it through the strainer but please don’t waste it
Make sure you clean the plates when I’m done cooking
I’m Lil B, I am big ME, you little he, ahh
Sometin’ better, theres none of that, I’m running rap
Everything around it like hustling trap, stuntin that
Everything you bad at, I do so well
Then I eat the whole beat than put it on sale
That means I put it out to sea
You never get it back
It’s only coming back to me, uh
Indeed, it’s the LUP, Tim Westwood on our BBC Business


[Verse 2]
Flip the beat up and bring me another track
Some of that, uh, some up all up under that
Bring the sun back, that be me I'm so on fire
So higher like the moon and I will not retire
But maybe soon but, maybe that will be that noon uh
Then I wake you up for it and pace you up for it
Uh, if you got it take you up on it
You can roll the dice but, promise you don't want it
See, you ain't really on it, you be on some other shit
I be on some wonky shit and be on some tonky shit
Takin' it and walking' it, L U P be stalking' it
Round the corner dressed up, so tight, no light
Unlike anybody ever seen too clever
Flowing off the top of the dome to whoever's beat
Uh, and whoever's neat I'm nicer
I'm more bling, more clean, more play - no dice uh
No dice cuz, see I don't roll that
Don't believe in luck just bringin' confidence
Constantly, consequence of tryna defy is not nice
You be so dead, uh - twice
Kill 'em again, and again, and again
The adrenaline that's flowing up in him
Uh, and you know it something special
It's damn near incredible I should eat this
Uh-uh uh, uh
I lost my way but I'm back up on my path
A rapping wrath, a chaos spiting
Uh, It's more gripping
It's more intelligent and more thrilling
Than anything that they can do even though they top billing
See, I be underdoggin', I be underloggin'
Uh, it's something special someone better off them
It's damn near awesome but more like incredible
You can't eat me nigga I am so unedible
But if you swallow it's like swallowing glass
I eat you it's like swallowing grass
Got a belly full of doo
You can't stomach got a belly full of hope
The audacity of them to think they rapidly ascend
I'm so aggressive or in the rage I take them off the stage
Skytel I bring it back just got a page
I'm like Tron, step up in the [?] it's the Don
See what' going on and in my own world
You can keep your home girl I got the whole world
In my hands in my palms, uh something like a bomb
Around the chest of some suicide vest, nah
It's Vietnam here, you keep it calm there
Cause you don't want none of this with ya
I hit ya, and git ya, split you, and brake it down
Bag it up, go to the hood take a route
Uh, take another shot, take another three
These are all bars [?] music and you can't see
And can't beat what I am, that's a A+
Uh, I hope God wanna save us
If they won't save you
Play too damn much messing with the homeboy, ya
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta


[Verse 3]
Fire flame spitta
On another track, don't want none of that
With no water and no slaughter
No breaks I just continue on, with no takes
I keep going, I keep flowing, no stopping that
And see everybody watching that
See I got the lock so I'll be locking that, you can't get the keys
Especially from me, I keep them so excited in my pocket
You'd better watch it, and matter of fact you'd better stop it
I'm too hot, better hopscotch it and go up down the block
You might catch a shot, one two
Blat, blat, blat -
My flow is like...Heckler and Koch
Hit you up straight
Niggas aiming for your face when I come through...
I ain't hitting hearts, I'm just aiming for the brains
Trying to make'em smarter and take'em out of danger's way
And say maintain today
I show the shorties how to maintain the way so righteous
The nicest and do it like is priceless, iceless
No, I got a couple those watches and a couple cars
And I keep a couple flows and a couple bars
And I keep a couple hoods and a couple stars
In my back pocket and you can back watch it
You better backstop it like it's cricket
I keep a wicket googly when I stick it, be like the Batman, hitcha
You can come through just like don't pitch it out
I'll knock it out the park, it'll be so dark
By the time I'm done, there'll be no sun
There'll be no one, see the crowd so empty
I'll still be there rhyming, see it don't tempt me
I don't feel guilty either, I feel so filthy when I roll
Flowing like ether, burning niggas down
Turning niggas' worlds around and show them there's better ways to get it down

Yeah, yeah, it feeling like an iPod
Look at my god and bow my head down to heaven
I pray to the East, I try to do it seven times a day
Do it my way, may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do
And for the fasts that I didn't fast
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them
Or if not keep me so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about their success or their chains
I don't care nowhere, but I do care about you, don't ever let'em doubt you
Don't ever let them try to put a mouth to the violence
The silence that I bring is so deafening to the ears and the eyes
And they can watch if they want to
See it's gonna haunt you
The ghosts of the past come through so fast
You lay'em down but they can't, you try and put it in the trash
But it jumps out the garbage and still returns to be the hardest on the market
