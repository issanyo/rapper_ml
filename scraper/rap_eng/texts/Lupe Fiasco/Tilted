Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I was like Porsche puller, Air Force footer
Automatic wristed therefore shook-up
Causing a stir every time I push up
007 with a jester and a look-up
It's Carrera-Ella from the F&F crew
With a tiger on his shirt, alligator on his blues
With a nice young lady and some righteous kung-fu
I'm fighting without fighting, enlightening you young fools
Frankensteins of mine, I tighten you young screws
Send lighting to your mind and make you move
Car like cannonball, run!
I'm lighting my guns fuse, one:
That mean I'll lean and leave you, I mean this, Needlz
They hook to my hooks, they rehearse my verse
And they sing my singles I can't even see you

[Hook]
With it tilted, brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (tilted), brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye, and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Fresh-to-def F&F!

[Verse 2]
I wear Cartier glasses, Van dutch pants-es
Gameboy Advances next to the black berry
I'm next to my black berry Molasses
Hat very slanted rapping to the riders
Writer of the stances driver of the riders
Matter of fact Shur the chauffeur
Reverse the fifteen teen is so serve
The serve is so mean like I served in the marines
And it's full metal jacket
Upset the jokers every time I draft it
They trys to jack it change my will
I can wait for triple A I remain, I chill
Even still niggas don't know the drill
And I mean it needles
Just hook em with my hooks, they rehearse my verse
And they sing my singles I can't even see you

[Hook]
With it tilted, brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (tilted), brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye, and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Fresh-to-def F&F!

[Verse 3]
F, F I to the A S C O, flyin' like Neo
They lien' like Leo, Cleo maybe they fronted
But they ain't never done it like he though
Refering to me Joe!
I feed them through the bars like CO's
I lead them through the harm like a Hero
Peaceful
But I can bring the violence like Nero
Right to your keyhole then bring it back to silence
Cause that's the G-Code
Which means that if you brought it or your about to bring it on
But tell the polices I ain't seen it because I had it

[Hook]
Tilted, brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (tilted), brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye, and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Fresh-to-def F&F!
