It's those Jersey boys

I heard a man say Jesus walks
Me, myself, I heard Jesus talk
Cause when I heard his beat
I felt Jesus voice
I heard it through the wide
And he made it out the coma
From a fast car
It was a fast car

Yeah

Every day is like the wild wild west
Some of us are bad boys
Some of us are outlawed
And some mystery, the killer get away
And livin' this isn't the end of the day
In the fast car
Jump in the fast car

Yeah

You don't gotta be no billionaire
To get a ticket up to the moon
We all know somebody up there
You need a helping hand
Look, I'm right here
To help you see clearly now, yeah
To help you see clearly now, yeah
I hope you see clearly now, yeah

Yeah

What would you do after your bachelor party
In the bar celebrating with all your homies
Go outside, and you're ready to ride
And over fifty-one shots but you ain't ready to die
In your fast car, yeah
In your fast car

Paul simon talk, talk to me

When that fast car picks you up
You will have no choice
You may hear the tires scream
But you will have no voice
But as the fast car picks you up
You will weep and smile
And see heaven in the headlights
Mile after mile after mile after mile

Yeah

You don't gotta be no billionaire
To get a ticket up to the moon
We all know somebody up there
You need a helping hand
Look, I'm right here
To help you see clearly now, yeah
To help you see clearly now, yeah
I hope you see clearly now, yeah

So she headed to Honduras for some TLC
Yeah, having fun in Central America
But she was a passenger, never a driver
In that fast car
Ridin' that fast car

Sweet sixteen, I see her leaving the scene
Crossing the street, she won't see seventeen
Blink of an eye, DWI
Hit and run and sellin' flees
In the fast car
Ridin' the fast car

Yeah

When that fast car picks you up
You will have no choice
You may hear the tires scream
But you will have no voice
But as the fast car picks you up
You will weep and smile
And see heaven in the headlights
Mile after mile after mile after mile

Yea
