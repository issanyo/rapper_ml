[Helicopter propellers]

[Man's voice]
Well the first thing I want to say is:

[Verse 1]
They say real recognize real
The dollar bill will exercise our ills...E
Frauds is thoroughly camouflaged and fatigued in the field
Be careful who you believe, the pills
Is dealed like flaccid, proceeds go towards the buying of caprice classics
With the wheels to match it, so they can mack it
Like an automatic weapon stepping off into traffic
Like, check him, tears roll down the eyes
Of the rides inside of a funeral procession
Here lies, with X's in his eyes, the unguided misdirected
Squad cars roll past and laugh

[Hook/Sample]
Out there

[Verse 2]
They say the streets is a demon in a dress
With dollar signs in her eyes and semen on her breath, uh
Scantly clad, no panties, deep throatin' in an alley
Aging badly, in sunglasses, she pretty
Slain boyfriends names is tattooed on her titties
Sprinkling greed, ignorance, and envy inside of a philly
Hennessey tears, ass'll bring ya enemies here
Flirt with her flaws till you run up in her raw

[Hook/Sample]

[Verse 3]
They say the game has the belly of a beast
Blunts for fingers and hollow tips for teeth
Wire taps for ears, Nike Airs for feet
Blasphemy for prayers, a system for a heart
Rap music for beats, heroin for a son and it's married to the streets
Crack pipes for lungs, and he never sleeps
Just spies, with dice in his eyes
Loves life cause he likes when it dies
With a baking soda soul, he cough up pleasure
Clothes made out of dollar bills that he sewed together
He knows, he's clever, jail is his house
All the liquor that's poured out, goes right in his mouth
Rides around on a stray bullet;
With prostitutes, pimps, dope dealers, and killers tied to it to pull it
A TV in his head, stripper slides down his legs
And he's known to ride around with the feds, he's...

[Hook/Sample]

[Verse 4]
But, righteousness is a father teaching his kids
That what's better than wealth, is the respect in the self
A pistol-packin' old lady standing up to the dope dealers
On the block, making sure her presence is felt
A teacher teaching that thinking is cool
Listen, before you mention "not letting school turn em' into fools"
Keeping God first, Lupe is here
F-N-F up, homie I'll see you...
