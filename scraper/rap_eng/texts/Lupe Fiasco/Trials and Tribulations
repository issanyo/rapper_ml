[Intro]
Yeah
F-N-F up
Through all the trials and the tribulations
And the storms
Yeah
We're still here
You know what I'm saying? Gemini
Lupe
Fresh from the reigns of the police
This has been brought to you by genocide
Sponsored by crack
We ain't going nowhere
Record your operation with guns

[Verse 1]
They couldn't believe how I took jargon
Made it describe how I push hard in
Through the streets, and at the same time I was pushing the margins
So far to the left that I ended up writing on my desk
Yes, I'm from a concrete jungle, that'll make your set look like bush gardens test
Who wan' touch the Juan Don, Von Dutch
Niggas want none trust, please believe
I don't give a damn how gassed up or eager he is
It started won't stop, who don't
Want us to blow like bomb squad well fire on guard
It's Lupe touche
Coup de Gr√¢ce, now put them in the trunk like the roofs are our cars
Yeah, rappers is like Sonny
When I'm in the booths with my bars
A mind full of poison, a mouth full of flu and a lung full of SARS
Fresh from the mayonnaise jar
Prepared to bring you down reach your razor blade's pause

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
But it wasn't easy to crack it, we wasn't fly
Had to get it off the ground pedaling
E.T. was in the basket, now it's sick
1st and 5th bought to come up like the last bullet in the clip
Click, a few didn't survive
It triggered something inside that gave me power, got a grip
Like the floor of the shower, now I hit
Anything that I set my sights on, no lights on
Silence is my 5th plead the 5th
I don't need a Japanese flag, Vash the Stampede of hip-hop, straight from the hip
Bang, no matter how the enemy bolsters I'm going to hold us down like the holdsters right up on my shoulders
Clappers, why don't you wait some more
Fire, it ain't safe no more
Cocksuckers pull backwards
I pull faster it's master
I haven't turned into guns like MegaTron
You just brushed upon the upper echelon, gone

[Verse 3]
Pac said they won't follow ya if your points is hollow
So it made vocal, the ad-lib I bring focal
Too bad kid, shed light on troubled youth
Fed, egg rice and noodle soups
Explain all their rules and roots
But not enough to incriminate
Just enough to demonstrate
Why they're confused as youths
Are easily amused and and consumed with hoops
Bodily accused and refused the truth
Followers, easily subdued by flukes
Swallowers, of anything the bandwagon hands them
Well listen to me, telling them to listen to me
Refuse my rules is ? scoop
I'm finna take you to my zone
Take you to my home, please remove your boots
Not the spook who sat by the door
But Lu' who slept on the floor
That you stepped over all these years
Waking up, coming back for yours
