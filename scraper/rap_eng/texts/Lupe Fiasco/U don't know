Intro:
It's me man
You
[?]
C'mon
It's like this man [?]
[?]

Verse 1:
You was just crackin' the surface
I stepped it up
I am sapphire crystal
All your scratchin' is worthless
I live it up
While you was rappin' your verses
I was in the back buyin' straps wrapped in them verses
I leveled up
Cause y'all don't carry biscuits like churches
Just row
Homie the bricks so Sony
Colombian D it's money to me
You one day later I'm Sunday paper, how funny is he?
From Chicago
Hungry and [?]
Keep his hand in his waist
Al Bundy is me
Understand
Money talks
Every two bars is like a hunnid' grand (Cool)
Like the fondue's [?] hand (Huge)
Gunnin' hand
Y'all bustas (Who)
Wanna ram and I question mark
Who's upperhand?
Stay in your motherland
Might lose your dome if you come outside your zone
Like runnin' man (Run it man)

Chorus:
You don't know what you got yourself into!
Nooooo No!
And you don't know what that boy done been through!
Nooooo No!
Cause' if you knew you wouldn't be here!
And if you did you wouldn't be here!
And if you knew you wouldn't be heeeeeere!
Nooo!

Verse 2:
This another eight
Hundred grand keep my size tens
On the fifth floor
Like Brotherman
Keep growin'
Like the [?] door
Just the man
Member runner hustler
And
Loverman
Stretch to stretch like rubber band
Crack rock or poppy seed
Flat top with a tommy gun
Best to best like Tommy Lee
Know what it's like man?
Bright bright land
Got my right hand lookin' like Ice man
Fifty cal shell
Bout' the size of a
Sprite can
[?] white lands
Lookin' like
Dice man
Showin' that range
Remind you of a trap game
Jus' remembah' don' speak to these
And if grams is grammys I be Alicia Keys
The rap game remind me of the smack game
And I'm hidin' more eggs than easter eve
Just tryna give peace of mind
Like [?] please
C'mon

Chorus:
You don't know what you got yourself into!
Nooooo No!
And you don't know what that boy done been through!
Nooooo No!
Cause' if you knew you wouldn't be here!
And if you did you wouldn't be here!
And if you knew you wouldn't be heeeeeere!
Nooo!

Verse 3:
Yeah I know my worth niggas
How I work niggas
In the underground like earth ninjas
Now it's pro
I get the dough like lurch niggas
First in fifteens
First figure for might hurt niggas (Yo)
Call polices
I increase it till' I lose leases
Had to sleep in the park
Lose used blues speakers a part
You get the piece
Not two fingers apart
If I release prepare to lose pieces and parts
And nephews, nieces and aunts
The boy speaks it
With the flus fevers and coughs
There's no teas
Or remedies
To ease
The injuries
Within this entity
I'm lost
I never play with you sorta thugs
I just chuck em' like pay to the order of
I don't freeze
But I stay till' the water does
Then I head south with things that head south
C'mon

Chorus:
You don't know what you got yourself into!
Nooooo No!
And you don't know what that boy done been through!
Nooooo No!
Cause' if you knew you wouldn't be here!
And if you did you wouldn't be here!
And if you knew you wouldn't be heeeeeere!
Nooo!
