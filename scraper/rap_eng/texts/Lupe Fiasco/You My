Fresh to def she is
From her steps to her set she is
So death might not let me live
Ya dig
Fresh
Yes she is
Had a feeling
That it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind
Don't play like this
Naw
But I'm prepared for it
Got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs
Even
Cut my hair for it
Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be lookin for light like that
Then there it go
Yeah
Right over there
So I prepared to pour it
Little scared
My stare lowered
Momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already outta my chair
Gathered up my airs
On my square
From here for it
Its nothing, right?
So here go it
Whispered in her ear
It was crowded in here
Would she care to blow it
She said yeah

*You're my sunshine*
*(you're my sunshine)*
*You're my moonlight*
*(you're my moonlight)*
*You're the starry skies above me*
*Won't you please come down and hug me*
*Think I found love in this club tonight*

Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor
Hard to get
In the
Car we sit
From the intro
She rolled down the window
Just in case I was a skitzo
I compliment on her common sense
I'm calm
A little more confident
Uh huh
And then we lose consciousness
...
She says that I've been waitin for you
And I know that you've been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from my castle
I've been thinking of you
I told a fire breathin dragon he bet not harm me
Or be sorry
When he meets my for my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor
Yes you be
Woken up by the horn of a SUV
I said see
Too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine

*You're my sunshine*
*(you're my sunshine)*
*You're my moonlight*
*(you're my moonlight)*
*You're the starry skies above me*
*Won't you please come down and hug me*
*Think I found love in this club tonight*

Relationship is just 30 minutes long
Its kinda heavy
Maybe a little strong
Goin take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say
At least for a month
Or two
Before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me
Out of the trillions of #s that's in the world
Just leave me a few
They'll lead to you
Won't be long and
I'll see you in the morning
Cool

You're my sunshine
(you're my sunshine)
You're my moonlight
(you're my moonlight)
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me
Think I found love in this club tonight

You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight...
