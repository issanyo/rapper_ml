[Intro]
Aight y'all I take back lets just say "We The Best!"
Meaning me, me, me, I, me, me AND me the best!

[Verse 1]
My ego on zero
It's just that my re-al's on hero
My confidence on Michael but my pride is on Tito
I ain't paid dues? What is this receipt 4?
Boy said, "With Lasers you kinda stumbled some and you're only as good as your last record."
I said, "So I guess I'm only as good as being number 1!"
I asked him "What's your success measurer? The message or the register?
In the end you got a win-win, only thing I lost is my competitors."
He said, "Yeah but Lasers was your worst and nothing like ya first."
I said, "Well that's me vs. me and your growth is nothing like your birth."
He said, "You're a lame dumbed down sellout only known for talking out your ass."
I humbly nodded in agreement and asked 4 more ketchup in my bag
I left thinking how I used to be in his shoes
Writing verses flipping burgers
Now I serve the world pearls from socio-political menus
And how I could never back, only because I never left
So if you find a few diamonds in your sandwich then you know who was the chef
A Rolex in your fries, a chain in your salad
A range rover in your soup and a extra slice palace
People, Friend of L-U-P-End cuz!
G'night
