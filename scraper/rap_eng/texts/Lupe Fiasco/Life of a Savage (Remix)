[Hook: RondoNumbaNine x2]
I done been through a lot of shit, seen a lot of shit
I done witnessed a lot of shit, still I talk shit
But it’s the life of a savage
But it’s the life of a savage

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Rondo got a nine like Wu-Tang, woo shit!
Thumbs down to the foo shit
Set self for this new shit
L’s up for the Lu shit
One verse like two bricks
Each bar like one rock
Each word like two hits
Got niggas high as two Ricks
Standin’ on the couch yelling out who shit
All my niggas only on business
Rondo need a rollie by Christmas
Rondo need a 'rari by July
And another rollie by Christmas
Nigga I know cause I did this
But I keep it on the low no witness
Put my whole heart in this rap shit
But I done seen a lot of shit and I done did a lot of shit
But my lips sealed like chap-stick
Did my best to get ‘em out the streets
So they don’t get killed by that bitch
Gotta keep moving can’t sit still in that traffic
It’s a savage
Dumb shit, I ain’t wit it
But if you wanna run shit then let’s get it

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: RondoNumbaNine]
Gotta go hard for my bro L'A
Gotta get a deal, no I can't wait
Gotta see a mil right in this day
And if a opp in my lane he gonna meet this K
Whole lotta dope loud pack to the face
In Chiraq cooling where it ain't safe
On the run to the money, yea its a race
Try and try me I'm gonna spray ya like mace
Run up in the spot masked up where the safe?
Fuck all dissing we could meet face to face
Put in a hole in your face, still beat the case
CPDK nigga talk to the jakes
Theres a whole lot of food on my plate
[?]
Glock go BLAH, damn thats great
Rip D-Thang  I ain't going like that
Chilling in the back with mac he make a mess
Say its fucked up but my niggas blessed
My squad, yea we up next
We the fucking best, we gon' fucking flex
On these fucking haters, with these big checks
