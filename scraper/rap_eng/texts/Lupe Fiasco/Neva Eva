[Verse 1: Ace Mac]
Never snitched on a nigga
Never ran from my foes
Never took orders from a pussy
Never ran with no hoes, never
I keep expanding my goals, I know am good in every hood
Cause I'm a man on my own, I never
Ever chased the status' quo, gave my cash to a ho
Or put my stash in my nose
I never broke the code of silence, never shy from some violence
I'm from Chicago where they get for just rocking your finest
I never leave the crib without the Glock on my side
I'm poppin' five in a coward before he throw up his sign
And I never ever told this fuckers I'm ill
They hear my music and they feel it cause the language is real
And I never took a penny from who didn't deserve it
And I been working on urgency
Nobody is perfect on Earth is just different persons at work
Somebody's last is your first, then someone's first is your last
So do I lurk in my past? Never

[Verse 2: Ace Mac]
And still I'm rugged, don't you get it confused
I could walk through any city, you don't fit in these shoes
Never, I was taught to finish my food
Move packs, hold bangers, nigga put in my dues
And many nights were spent up cooking thinking "what am I doing?
Shit, I could go to college, I should try" but I was influenced
By goons, never thought I'd live to see 22
But when that 23 came I had to get in the game
But never, ever lost my grip of the truth
I keep that shit on my hip, and spit that shit in the booth
But clever, half the shit I did for my crew
The other half for my kids, I wasn't thinking bout you
Whoever, bitch I came from visions of Lou
Dodging prison sentences, living recklessness was my youth
And never, never did I think I would lose
It wasn't cause I'm the best, it's just cause I would refuse like never

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Reduced into a gesture, send a message through a closed mouth
Never talk to hoes through the hole of your saw house
They're going south, but you keep it cool
Like it's no clothes and there's no house and it's cold out
Ayy, let me tell you what that ball 'bout
Laying on the floor full of hoes, letting ghosts out
Who you gonna call to take the hauntings out of your house?
Exorcised the demons out the deep end of your profile
We are, oh such a beautiful role now
No mouse did wanna sing like a musical soul child
Eyes on the prizzize, that's all lizzize
What lies inside is the prize, keep your eyes on his eyes
Disguised, closed curtains on the windows of my rizzide
So you can't see me getting head on the inside
Disguised, what's life if ain't nothing that rib eye?
G, I keep it real, vampires getting killed, goodbye
