[Verse 1: MC Ren]
This for my nigga Train and my nigga E
Niggas way back from the CPT
This for all the homies that passed away
Wishing they we’re all here so they could see the day
See the kids play, se them graduate
Bring them up right, make sure they act straight
It’s a cold world and time is short
Got me stressing homie puffing on the new porch
Shit is fucked when a homie gotta go
Knowing you ain’t gonna hear is voice no more
Keep your eyes up nigga don’t look down
Ain’t no motherfucking thing to see on the ground
So keep looking up, gotta be a better way
Give a fuck about what the fake preachers gotta say
Street is cold, don’t give a fuck
You fuck around and your ass is stuck

[Hook: MC Ren]
What the fuck is the world coming to?
New World Order jumps the borders
From California to Florida, coast to coast
They wanna keep black and brown down the most
Don’t think that this shit was a plan
Feed you bullshit so you can’t understand
Try to organize and pull it together
So when these fools creep we be down for whatever

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Why this shit gotta be this way?
Babies getting killed everyday by straight
Bullets is hot, system cold
Lucky if your ass ever see twenty years old
Kids deposed, sleeps on the floor
Motherfuckers acting like they don’t see skid row
From (?) to executive suites
People on the street never got nothing to eat
They got their hands out, your's in the pocket
Coming up to your door, your ass locked it
Fuck balling out the banks fucking snakes
Fuck the government got them pumping their breaks
Give us fucked up education and shitty jobs
Fucked up housing, why the blowing thousand
I’m the villain nigga telling the truth
That’s the only way I know while I’m up in the booth

[Hook: MC Ren]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Bring your ass in, homie Ren on one
Got this shit moving, got that fine bitch grooving
Got the police rocking back and forth with it
A lot of motherfuckers just ain’t home get it
This for the hood up in every state
From the Empire State to the Golden Gate
To the UK all the way to burg
This westcoast shit is the hardest shit you ever heard
Gangsta party music, go ride to it
Police fuck shit, say you had to do it
This Villain Nation, nigga be pation
All you fools now hating, quit hating
Y’all fucks with it, when the jail get it
Bitch-ass niggas don’t admit it
Quit playing hard, stop mugging
Fake-ass thuging, you we’re born with nothing

[Hook: MC Ren] (x2)
