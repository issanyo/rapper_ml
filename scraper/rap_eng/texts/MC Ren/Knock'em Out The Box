[Intro]
Fool tell your trick to stay away from the chevy
I know you wanna see me rip it up
Made my first G before adding on the MC

[Hook]
Now who keeps it real
I’m coming straight of the street of Compton like E
One for the trouble, jack for ass in the parking lot
I’m knocking fools out the box
I’m knocking fools out the box

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Nigga with Tha Chill up in the studio
Nigga getting bored tryna call up a ho
Ho-banging through these speakers, cause something ain’t right
Fucked up and let my weed up for the night
Called up my nigga Boom Bam for the grand
Comp-town niggas, man keep him on the sand
Damn can’t get thru with that fat-ass sack
Let me smoke that shit, let my eyes roll back
Hoes in the parking lot sniffing that bud
(?), make their knees hit the rud
Bitch I’m the villain you’re sucking mine first
Same time a while nigga busting his verse
Don’t look at me just keep your eyes close
Then I’m gonna bust in your mouth I suppose
Bitch here it comes, don’t say a fucking word
Here it goes

[Hook]
Now who keeps it real
I’m coming straight of the street of Compton like E
One for the trouble, jack for ass in the parking lot
I’m knocking fools out the box
I’m knocking fools out the box

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
On the ninty-one to the two to the ten
Bitch about to crash when she looking at Ren
(?)
About to get my ass off, nigga need gas
Nigga mad dawg when they see the icon
Knowing damn well you wanna talk to the don
Cause bitch choose me by a punk number three
But hub city niggas we don’t let them ride free
Renincarnated bumbing out the window
About to make some final touches at the studio
Picked up my nigga Bigg Rocc on the way
He told me whay them bitch-ass niggas had to say
Still on my nuts, wishing the name was The Vill
Try to pull a nigga like a fisher real
Fuck them niggas, I’ma fuck they bitches like this

[Hook]
Now who keeps it real
I’m coming straight of the street of Compton like E
One for the trouble, jack for ass in the parking lot
I’m knocking fools out the box
I’m knocking fools out the box

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Nigga with Tha Chill up in the studio
Nigga getting bored tryna call up a ho
Ho-banging through these speakers, cause something ain’t right
Fucked up and let my weed up for the night
Called up my nigga Boom Bam for the grand
Comp-town niggas, man keep him on the sand
Damn can’t get thru with that fat-ass sack
Let me smoke that shit, let my eyes roll back
Hoes in the parking lot sniffing that bud

Bitch I’m the villain you’re sucking mine first
Same time a nigga busting his verse
Don’t look at me just keep your eyes close
Then I’m gonna bust in your mouth I suppose
Bitch here it comes, don’t say a fucking word
