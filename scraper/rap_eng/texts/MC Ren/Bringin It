[Intro: MC Ren]
Right about now, you're witnessin' the sounds
Of MC motherfuckin' Ren and motherfuckin' Bigg Rocc

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
I be peepin' you niggas tellin' your bitch not to smile at the villain
She wants this dick, I must to quit
Tell you motherfuckers like Johnny Cochran you ain't shit
You'se a studio and still don't fit
I been lookin' at niggas cheesin' and grinnin'
On MTV, BET, no more cheese
So I call my nigga Rocc and get the shit done
Fuck the police, we blase in the sun
Make your bitch come, these hoes they all dumb
Wake up the next morning they'll blame it on the run
But Villain gone bring
Some ghetto ass shit, don't need the nigga to sing
Have your own mamma gyratin' on my ding-a-ling
You know how I do it, she swallowed it
Rip right through it, so next time you open your mouth
Make sure my motherfuckin' dick sway the fuck out

[Hook: Bigg Rocc] (x2)
I hear niggas talkin' shit like bringin'
Well I'mma bring it, if you niggas gon' sing it tonight
We gon' party, get high all night
Get drunk, fuck hoes all through the night, ha

[Verse 2: Bigg Rocc]
I hear niggas talkin' shit like bringin'
Well I'mma bring it if you niggas gon' sing it
Then I'mma close your curtains, this is my show
Up rises the .44, blast at your door
Criminal minded, you have been blinded
West Coast, Compton, niggas we stay grinded
We hardheads, feds, most wanted killers
They came with a bare, tryin' to figure out niggas
The blocks with guns, the guns with tote
The bomb ass bitches, the chronic and coke
It's a bunch of rich ghetto negros
Check out the gators on my motherfuckin' toes
Keep a lot for pocket, throw gangster party
Don't invite the niggas you hated, they'll overrated
Ugh, I'mma keep a fuckin' bullet for the wasters
Now we keep it cheap for my motherfuckin' gangsters

[Hook: Bigg Rocc] (x2)

[Verse 3: Bigg Rocc]
It's a chosen world nigga don't get mad
Cause your bitch wanna hop her ass, in my the back of my 'llac
And take her ride down memory lane, of that chronic and hypnotic
Body lookin' so exotic
I gotta watch it before I hit it
Sure up on all that pussy, puttin' on the show like a classic ho
On the '91 headed west bound to the Penthouse
So I can beat that fat pussy down

[Verse 4: MC Ren]
Yeah, one more time, we bout to rock this shit
Bigg Rocc and 'Ren hittin' tailspins
Would you think about that, you bitch
When your baby mamma suckin' my dick
I'm too sick with it
Compton finest, bitches behind us, what the fuck you're sayin'
We have your mamma frayin'
So bring it on, fuck the microphone
Just give me like two zones
My black ass is gone, nigga
