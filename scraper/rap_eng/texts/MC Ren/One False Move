[Bridge: Don Jaguar]
Ren your dangerous, you know you bat like a week
Ren your dangerous, gun shots from Juagardonlee
Dangerous, me know you bat like a week
Ren your dangerous, gun shots from Juagardonlee

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Move, now let me fall into the groove
Breakin' niggas off but I break 'em off smooth
Used to try to pimp, but the ho's got old
A nigga can't remember how much dope that I sold
In my youth, the shit is the truth, go to Chip for the proof
Niggas makin' records sellin' two copies
Tryin' to fuck with me because your rap's sloppy
Now back in your cage your wings are short
You tall, dirty motherfucker stick to basketball courts
I can tear ya ass up in a rhyme
But I won't mention your name, cause that's a waste of my time
So I call my niggas, Chip and Dollar Bill
Scoop up to the hill when we move in for the kill
Never retreat you dirty nigga take a seat
Big motherfuckin' feet, with your wack assed beats
So Train (what up?), cut him with the shank
Make the nigga walk the plank, the dirty nigga always stank
Nigga better raise like the Titanic
Ain't from Atlantic, but I'll make your ass panic
And that's only one step, pride is kept
A glass of piss weigh as much as your rep
Nigga your through

[Hook]
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
From one nine millimeter shot to the head
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
From one nine millimeter shot to the head

[Bridge]
Ren your dangerous, you know you bat like a week
Ren your dangerous, gun shots from Juagardonlee
Dangerous, me know you bat like a week
Ren your dangerous, gun shots from Juagardonlee

[Verse 2: Da Konvicted Felon]
Quiet as kept - I step, with the 9 millimeter cocked
When I creep from the back, get the gat to the back
Of the devils head then I put the trigger til he's dead
RedRum all I can see when I close my eyes at night
Many a vision of murderous criminal blue-eyed
Satans I have to fight, I ain't rapped too tight
You fucking with a muthafuckin madman
That dont take shit from a redneck trick
You can put your mouth upon my steel dick
And suck til I'm pullin the trigger cum, ejaculate my gun
Yah will ill be done, when I be making your blood run
Into the street - and I ain't fuckin with that white trucker that got his fuckin ass beat
Many a pussyclot shed many a tear for Denny
But not so many couldve gave as much as I fuck bout Rodney Buck, but I gets hit up when I try to defend my own skin from a nigga
Who loves crackas, so them I attack-a
Sleep with the enemy and get treated as such
Da Konvicted Felon will bust and lust for you
To make that one false move

[Hook]
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
From one nine millimeter shot to the head
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
From one nine millimeter shot to the head

[Sample]
But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin' motherfucker's it would put 'em in line

[Verse 3: Dollar Bill]
I was never the one to run with the pack
But was the mastermind for settin' up the jack
So if they every saw my beamin' it wasn't from crack
I musta been beamin' them grubs to hit the sack
And let me remember the days of way back
When everybody was homies and no one played that
Rockin' 'em, sockin' 'em, knockin' 'em out the box now tell me what's up
Look at me wrong fool, you get tossed up
I mean fucked up, you lucked up
I didn't come out a long time ago, with the fast or the slow flow
And callin' me wack, no that's a no no
The style just so wild, while your style just so-so
Nasty, they can't pass me, it's too fast see
Niggas that blast fast I don't let 'em blast me
Using my mind like a nine millimeter to abuse
So don't make one false move

[Hook]
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
From one nine millimeter shot to the head
One false move and a motherfucka's dead
From one nine millimeter shot to the head
