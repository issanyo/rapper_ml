[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Who in the fuck say Ren can’t do it
Nigga I’m from Compton, ain’t shit to it
I’ve been doing this shit for a while
Gain most of you niggas most of your style
Now you niggas tryna be wild
Last summer you we’re lip-syncing Destiny’s Child
You little ungrateful sons of bitches
Started selling out for the hons and riches
The game’s fucked up, y’all niggas gotta pay
For fucking up the game never thought I’d see the day
Niggas looking like bastard kids
Still eating of all the shit that I did
I’m the villain homie  get away in the end
Even though they want my black ass in the pen
Fuck the system, fuck their laws
Don’t fuck with us, we ain’t fucking with y’all

[Hook]
Shootin’ the shit a lil bit nigga x2

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
How many niggas really fucking with me
Who can bust like the villain, shit it to easy
True hall of fame Compton folk legends
Renincarnated again in 2011
Fuck you niggas it’s time to quit
Run around making fake gangsta shit
Making hoes in your videos celebrities
In the mack game straight felonies
You just rest hating for hoes
No real niggas in the crowd at your shows
You’re a clown and you don’t even know
The bitch gave you a son nigga she was a ho
You out here acting like the trick was a version
Out here splurging, bragging she Persian
But she left your ass to going back
Cause that’s where the motherfucking villain is at

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Why niggas in the game so fucking wack
Buy the shit and you wanna take the shit back
Stop telling all the homies that they sound good
When you know they don’t verse niggas in the hood
Tryna to sell yout shit out of the trunk
Tryna do it like E, but don’t no one give a fuck
That was yesterday this is 2009
You we’re chilling with the fans nigga dropping dons
You don’t give a fuck about the rap game
When you was acting like hoes giving up names
Why they locked up your ass free
You had to be snitch to get of that easy
Now your ass wanna grab the mic
Thinking you can me a fucking MC overnight
But I guess since your shit was wack
You tried to give it out, but they give the shit back nigga

[Hook]
