Always carrying a Mack 10, know what I'm saying
Ren is the G that you don't wanna get with
Always carrying a Mack 10 know what I'm saying
Ren is the G that you don't wanna get with

[Verse 1]
In '94 you know it's on, you can forget what you heard
I'm droppin' funny bombs like as if I was bird
I steal gangster boogie if I gets my boogie on
Put my finger in my chrome, keeps them get into my domes
Telling me to shoot, all these fools that I hear
Talking gossip in my ear, you know I hear it every year
Yeah they still talking like some tricks
Mad cause another brother trying to get rich
I see you telling people, "Yo Ren is gonna fall"
But I think you and your crew had too much of the 8 ball
It's a trip, cause I think you didn't know who's that
Breakin' play more, I ain't got no time for a hoe
Now the kid that you're claimin', yo you're very quick to claim
But to me it's just my kid, and he gotta another name
And people wanna know what's the word?
So peep it out, you can't forget what you heard

[Hook]
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard

[Bridge]
Always carrying a Mack 10, know what I'm saying
Ren is the G that you don't wanna get with
Always carrying a Mack 10 know what I'm saying
Ren is the G that you don't wanna get with

[Verse 2]
People give me looks like they wanna try and thump
Thinking Ren is just a chump, in the trunk I got the punk
Shoot them in the crowd, I shoot them fools up in they back
Leave my homies in the shack, started dipping in the lack
Some fools rolled up and said the truce was dead
Train said what's up, tried to bust them in the head
And it's on, everybody get to you close
Train just did some dirt so we gotta do a ghost
Get back to the hood, sip the 40 on the way
Cause the homies from the neighborhood I'm from don't play
And you still wanna know what's the word
So peep it out, you can't forget what you heard

[Hook]
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard

[Bridge]
Always carrying a Mack 10, know what I'm saying
Ren is the G that you don't wanna get with
Always carrying a Mack 10 know what I'm saying
Ren is the G that you don't wanna get with

[Verse 3]
He say, she say, who really give what they say?
Screaming out that mayday, you know it's going my way
Fools can't believe that I'm so much of a G
Cause I don't let stanky hoes sit up under me
Like your fools out there y'all swear y'all can scrap
Get beat down that you wanna try to rap
Sprung on the hoodrats, smoking all your weed
Messing with the trick that you really don't need
The click, my homies from the clique pimps hoes
Grinch, J-Rocc, my homey Bone and Jubee Lows
Them fools can't even say a word
Cause you know I don't really give the fuck about what you heard

[Hook]
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard
You can't forget what ya heard, what ya heard

[Bridge]
Always carrying a Mack 10, know what I'm saying
