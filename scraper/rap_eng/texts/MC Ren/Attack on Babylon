[Intro: Louis Farrakhan]
Is America like ancient Rome?
Is America like ancient Babylon?
Come on, come on, I wanna hear from you

[Verse 1]
I told you Ren will be back with the niggas
In the Dodge and the camouflage
Blunted at the Taj, a million niggas no mirage
Creeping and we're creeping in your little white huts
20 million niggas chanting I don't give a fuck
It's on, the switch got flicked but who did it?
When that shit was committed, fuck that where's my mack?
Niggas getting crazy cause Ren is in the front
With Supreme Wisdom, puffing on a blunt
Train by my side tearing up shit
With his bulletproof vest, still yelling double S
The whole community is up in a rage
Cause niggas be moving closer to white motherfuckers'll make them as slaves
And then they put these sell out niggas on the TV
To try to calm down niggas like you and me
But fuck that shit, cause my eyes are closed
Cause Ren ain't got time to be fucking around with them hoes
So I see ya at the grave where we bury them
Even motherfuckers that went out and even married them
Now it's time to attack take this motherfucker back
Bring it on, and it's on

[Hook]
Attack, attack, attack on Babylon (x8)

[Verse 2]
Here comes the doom, so listen to the tick of the tock
Can't keep niggas off your block, don't forget we got the Glock
And the sawed-off, and the trey 8's
And the duce duce, and the niggas in the pen breaking loose
So Ren will conduct this, but I pull my dick and say suck this
For the niggas that say fuck this
That ain't down, and step foot into the car
To commit the 187 with the nigga they call Akbar
But who gives a fuck who pulled the trigger
Cause I know some bitches that shot up a gang a niggas
Getting off the reservations, breaking up the docks
Doing this with 15 shots
Babylon the Great, look at the bitch while she falls
Dying like a motherfucker with no one to call
Now it's time to attack, take this motherfucker back
You bring it on, and it be on

[Hook]
Attack, attack, attack on Babylon (x8)

[Verse 3]
Where the fuck ya gonna run
When the fucking ground starts shaking
Niggas don't be waiting, niggas be constantly making
Niggas with no hesitation, a fuck up in this nation
To murder the caucasian, the Asian invasion
So here we come, come, come
My nigga Rhythm D is on the drum, drum, drum
The mayday, oh it's a dreadful day
When no motherfucker can come out to play
It goes (5 gunshots)
Niggas letting off and the shit is all that
So stay inside the house if you ain't down
Cause you might get caught up you sad faced clown
Then I'll bring ya to ya knees, fucking with these
Fucking with niggas that's a hive of bees
We go stinging, but dumbass niggas keep singing
No time for singing, too busy swinging
So it's time to attack, take this motherfucker back
Y'all brought it on, so now it's on

[Hook]
Attack, attack, attack on Babylon (x8)
