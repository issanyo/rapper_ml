* parody of N.W.A.'s "Straight Outta Compton"

[Daddy-O performed the rap lyrics for Allen Payne's character, Dead Mike]
CB4 in the motherfuckin house!

[Hi-C performed the rap lyrics for Chris Rock's character, MC Gusto]
Yeah Gusto's in the motherfuckin house
With my man Dead Mike!
We breakin motherfuckers off 24-7!
So check this shit out!
Aiyyo Gusto... (whassup?)
KICK THAT SHIT!!!

[Hi-C]
Straight Outta Locash
A crazy mothafucka named Gusto
I fucked ya wife, cause the bitch is a big ho
I fucked ya sister, I fucked ya cat
I would have fucked ya mom but the bitch is too fat!
When I'm in your neighborhood, you better dig a moat
Cause I'm comin to slit... ya motherfuckin throat!
Blood is drippin, I'm not slippin
Bitches panties, is what I'm rippin
Rollin faster than a motherfuckin dirt bike
Never met a piece of pussy that I didn't like
Like to eat it, like to suck it
Take a shit... in a bucket; Straight Outta Locash!!!

Crazy motherfuckers, hah hah!
(Where you from, nigga?)

[Daddy-O]
Comin straight out of Locash
A crazy motherfucker named Dead Mike
So get ready cause you're goin for a long hike
Off a cliff, I'm drivin you over
Now ya dead with ya fo' leaf clover
Float like a cannonball, sting like a shark
I'm the nigga waitin for you in the dark
Waitin to rob you, waitin to beat you
A bullet in ya head is how I greet you (whassup nigga?)
A villain with a hat, and it's like that
I tied yo' moms to a motherfuckin train track
Flat on her back, I give her some crack
It's ten o'clock - DO YOU KNOW WHERE YO MOMS IS AT?
At my house (doin what?) wipin her ass
She had to move... STRAIGHT OUTTA LOCASH!!!
