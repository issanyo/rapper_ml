Yo, I'm still the same nigga

[Verse 1]
This nigga be creepin' on fools all day and night
I got German millimeters nigga, fuck a fight
Cause niggas don't scrap no mo', that's a no no
Fools get hot, they shoot yo' ass on the spot
Cause bitch made niggas get fucked like a ho
But be outta work like that nigga Arsenio
Cause niggas be talkin' shit behind my back
Wishin' they could get they hands sweatty on my nut sack
I ain't from Ohio, but I'm a player
So pussy ass niggas what the fuck ya gotta say, uhh
Poppa gotta brand new bag when I rock
Cause niggas on the corner sellin' shit out the ziplock
Uh, but me and my niggas sit back and relax
While I fuck it up bustin' on them tight ass tracks
Yeah, you niggas know where you can find me
I'm kickin' back in Compton with my niggas behind me
Still the same nigga

[Verse 2]
I used to be a magician, but a nigga gave up tricks
Cause my assistance was fuckin' too many dicks
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Fuck it, nigga makin' dead presidents
But niggas be wantin' they hands in my pocket say gimme
For a penny, all they feelin' is the jimmy
Like Rick James I'm bustin' out on the funk
Nothin' up my sleeve, the shit is in the trunk
But don't make me bop that shit, and it's on
Cause I can get Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
Niggas shootin' stones, motherfuck a sly
If I wanted to I could hit ya with my third eye
Then you'll be in a deep sleep
So bring the band by, cause nigga chokin' like I mad fly
I'm still takin' niggas out
With the shit that's droppin' out my mouth
Cause I'm still the same nigga

[Verse 3]
Yeah minute you win it, a nigga ain't a loser
It's a black nigga hittin' corners on a beach cruiser
Or you might catch a nigga in a Chevy
Cause my motherfuckin' shit is so heavy
Rap skits kicked to the curb, they gets no play
When I'm rollin' in the 4-54 in LA
Fuck the radio and they format
I got bitch made nigga killa wrote on my doormat
So niggas don't ring my bell
I gotta bad attitude and I'm mad as hell
Cause I break God damn necks with my rhymes
Niggas in the street don't wanna fuck with mine
Devil's be askin' what I did
Tell 'em I make funky ass records, plus I built pyramids
But niggas in the streets I'm a good fella
In the trench like Gotti, and the umbrella
Still the same nigga
