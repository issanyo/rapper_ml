[Intro: dialogue in the street]
Look at all these trifflin' ass motherfuckers
This niggas don't even seen him, it's a goddamn shame
Niggas bittin' my motherfuckin shit
What time you'll turn this motherfuckin shit up
Ain't none of them motherfuckers the Villain, check this shit
Who the motherfuckin villain?
WHO ARE YOU?!

[MC Ren]
Motherfuckers be local and Ren'll be above it
Same nigga, nigga grap my nuts and motherfuckers love it
Here's a middle finger for you bitches
That be residin' this shallow ditches
That I be givin' shitty britches
I'll slap you motherfuckers like tricks
And make you be my hooker for the whole year of ninety six
Nigga I'mma food fellow with a crew
You wack niggas in L.A. is who the fuck we comin' to
This motherfuckin rap shit I got it locked
From Cali' to Pakistan I own the whole fuckin block
Cause I got some niggas' shit for ninety six
This motherfucker Ren is in the motherfuckin mix
So nigga get your sticks and stones and shit
As I hit your ass with another hit
Come listen to my shit, I'm motherfuckin shack type
In a minute you'll be beepin' I ain't Rap tight
Nigga fuck these niggas, it's me and my nigga Rocc
All these rats wanna give up the cock
When they be seein' Ren and Rocc on the block
You better step aside when you see us
You might catch a bullet from Pussy-Ass-Niggas tryin' be us
Who wanna be the Villain?[Hook]
Who wanna be the fuckin Villain?
Niggas be talkin but ain't never did a killin'
Cause niggas be shady as the motherfuckin tree
"Cause motherfuckers if it ain't rough, it ain't me, yeah"
Now who wanna be the fuckin Villain?
Niggas be talkin but ain't never did a killin'
Cause niggas be shady as the motherfuckin tree
"Cause motherfuckers if it ain't rough, it ain't me"

[MC Ren]
I heard your bitch ass have me in your conversation
A pussy-Ass-Nigga, it's your occupation
To relation to this size Ten motherfucker
So eat the dick up, you motherfuckin dick sucker
Keep pretendin' you the Villain in your morning mirror
And when you want the streets better keep your Gun nearer
To your dick cause the motherfucker's so little
You was a nigga or a bitch is a fuckin riddle
Here is the middle finger that you get, you can't exchange it
Your motherfuckin grill, I'mma rearrange it
See my niggas in the Regal about to be illegal
Send them to your crib like you Bennie Sigel
Fucker, you wanna be my ho, here's a black skirt
Now shove this dick off your ass cream
If it's hurt I'll rush it to the dirt
With the motherfuckin Pimp Clinic
Your ass switchin' like a bitch so my niggas had to go up in it
Until your butt checks start to bleed
Cause these fly playin' that I be droppin' niggas wanna feed
What you need is that Compton shit
That make you wanna stomp some shit
Who wanna be the Villain?

[Hook: repeat 5X]
Who wanna be the fuckin Villain?
Niggas be talkin but ain't never did a killin'
Cause niggas be shady as the motherfuckin tree
"Cause motherfuckers if it ain't rough, it ain't me, yeah"
