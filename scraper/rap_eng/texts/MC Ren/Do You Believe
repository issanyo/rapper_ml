[Hook]
And you have believed false ideas and concepts

[Verse 1]
How the fuck can you believe that people turns to spirits?
Don't come with that bullshit because I don't wanna hear it
The shit that you learned in the church - it only was worth
A bottle of piss, now let me tell you what you missed
Jesus wasn't white like the lying devil told you
He's the same devil that brought you from Africa and sold you
Made you take the white men's name
And now you're one with the same, playin' all of his devilish games
Ho running around in 93' with your slavemaster name
Like a fool happy as you can be
Believing in a burning hot hell
But the only hell you got was in the white men's jail cell
The devil owns every fucking thing
A nigga can't make it unless you can tap or ball or sing
Now niggas will be tripping about the shit I'm about to speak
How can you go from the streets
Turning to chicks and eating pig feet
Looking fucked up face turning to a hog
Mothafuckas happy you ain't died from the smog
Niggas got these white devil bitches for the ho's
Don't bring them in the room cause the bitches are doomed
Believe that!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you see a nigga with a white ho beat his mothafucking ass
Remind the mothafucka of what happend in the past
Let me tell you something that I think you oughta know
He's the same devil that kept us from voting 30 years ago
Then you got niggas that's blacker then the night
Running around town saying their best friends are white
Niggas like that are gonna hang up from a tree
And burn them up alive and let everybody see
Cuz in 93' we'll come and burn down your store
When niggas sign up Mohammed's Mosque 54
If you hate the devil you should fall right in
Cause all we're looking for is a few good men
So niggas here we go here we go it's a trip
The devil seperates you by a Blood and a Crip
Cuz he knows if you're together yo we'll beat off in his ass
Go to white neighborhood and start to blast
Nigga you believe that

[Hook]
