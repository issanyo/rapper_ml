[Verse 1: Grinch]
My niggas call me Grinch and yes I'm known to be a fuck up
Loaded clip, folded sticks, my lifts and double cuffed up
Put my stick so nigga feel my pockets with the dollar
Cause J-Rocc keep the strap in a private prison parlor
Grinch you did it, your black ass really did it
Give Bone the microphone and let him kill it

[Verse 2: Bone]
Give Bone the microphone and watch me beat you like a cop
Lil' G from the hall so the maggot won't stop
And plus I'm packing punches always keep a good grip
My homies call me Bone from the Whole Damn Click
I live like a mack and keep the bitches on my dick
You sorry sap sips still hanging on my shit
Compton is the heart and that's where we all from
The jacking going on in the hood and in the slum
And don't be caught slipping while we dipping the 4
Cause Ren'll grab his nine and watch him smoke them from the door
And then we make a dash and put that ass in the air
True checking done by the true fucking player
I'm headed to the cut with straight chronic in my pock
Raining make them kill 'em cause I'm serving 'em spot
And that's how it's done I keep it flowing like a sailor
My beats are large my feats are star, some called me Chuck Taylor
Then I call the Juvy cause I know we gotta Coupe
Don't worry about a damn we got the end, we getting loot

[Hook]
Laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Theny call me Mr. Dopeman when I'm chilling in the spot
My niggas call me Bishop when I'm rolling with my Glock
The crackers call me bandit when I'm running from the cops
And the bitches call me daddy when I'm tearing up the cock
Yo the title's Mr. Fuck up so I figure that I'm fucked
Got no luck, shit, gotta go and earn a quick buck
Boom boom, is the sound of my cannon
Cause I'm a nigga with a motherfucking gun master planning

[Verse 4 :J-Rocc]
I'm a crazy ass nigga making motherfuckers fall
A nigga from the streets hanging in the fucking hall
I place where we smoke bud and niggas get bent
And when it comes to music put on MC Ren shit
Now everybody chilling and the bitches getting freaky
Took a trick to the room now she gots ta lick me
Licking out my ass hole like a fucking groupie
I'm through now I cleans up and call my nigga Juvy
Heading downstairs my niggas hand me a 4-O
Smoking the extension you know it's the indo
Now I'm feeling high like I'm sitting on a cloud
The dust that we kick I guess we live our lives foul
Beware of the nigga that they call J-Rocc
The party's going through but I still got my Glock
I'm watching for the bad apples in every bunch
And if it's necessary motherfucker we can thump
Or get a fucking pump, put a hole in your chest
Slugs going straight through a bullet proof vest
Matters getting worse if I have to drop the dogs
Beat ya in your face yelling till ya hit the hall
So smalls, get your fucking nine and your clip
And let these motherfuckers know what's up on the Whole Click

[Hook]
