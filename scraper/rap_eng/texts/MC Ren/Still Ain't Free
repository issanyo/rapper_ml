[Intro: MC Ren Talking]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Who that nigga you can call to spit some shit?
And ain't scared of the government, you niggas loving it
We spread out, in different positions
Trying to break these motherfuckers outta prison
Listen, Mayday on the front line
Nigga we G's up in the game, we bust until we flatline
Then they want my black ass to rock the vote
They want as many niggas they can to fill the boat
But these house niggas, go fight in Iraq
Crying to they mamma, now, they wanna come back
Shouldn't took your black ass in the service
And fuck if I make you nervous
I'm a Speaking Black Revolutionary, that's my title
While these stupid niggas wanna be American Idols
Still ride for the streets, since day one
We rough with ours, homie straight outta Compton

[Hook: MC Ren]
Niggas still ain't free
In the streets or in the penitentiaries
Niggas dyin' all over the world
America killin' all over the world
Niggas in the street gotta kill to eat
Can't trust the bitch, keep your heat
Shit is fucked up all over the world
No matter where you go, it's all over the world
It's all over the world

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Who the niggas sayin' fuck the police on every song?
Free speech your bitch is raised my pitch
Get these niggas excited, then indicted
Get that swisher outta my pocket, roll it and light it
My mothafuckin' phone's tapped
F.B.I. ain't stopped fuckin' with me since Eazy
Y'all know, when your black ass speak out
They're followin' the nigga, route for route
Want 'Ren to come bow down, be thier puppet
But not in Compton, we just yell fuck it
See, y'all want that American Dream
But you gotta sleep to dream, rub your ass clean
We're real niggas won't settle for shit
Keep bustin' and cussin' at the government
Nigga this the Villain, y'all know about me
We bust back, you niggas can't fuck with that

[Hook: MC Ren]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
World wide vendetta, this reparations above cheddar
We got to fuck and get it together
So each one teach one for the struggle
Being black in America is some shit to juggle
They won't give mothafuckers a job
They wanna throw you in the Pen' when you forced to rob
But the Villain is back, with the black Panther of rap
Paris my nigga, you other fools never got bigger
I make this whole system quiver
With the street shit, I'ma deliver, from my villa
Here I go again scarin' people to death
America hold your breath, we the last left
They still got my black ass on the bottom
You mothafuckers in the jury, that's why I shot them
I shot down one, to get away from two
Now tell me what the fuck I'ma suppose to do?

[Hook: MC Ren]

[Outro: MC Ren Talking]
Yeah, MC mothafuckin' Ren
With my nigga Paris, Guerrilla Funk, out
