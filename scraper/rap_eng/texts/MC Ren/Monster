[Verse 1]
Big villain real nigga number one
Motherfuck guns, my voice bust they run
Child of the sun, Compton we run
When bitches get up and boogie, you niggas grab one
Who the fuck tryin' to fuck with this?
Baritone throat, quick to pull their coup
Fuck the high note, switcher, gotta talk
I'm the new president nigga give your vote
Oh while you're lookin' for the fuckin' Sadam
Only makin' the niggas shit, yellin' that's a bomb
Ex-slave on the front of my grave
Niggas got me floatin' into the fuckin' Rap Page
Compton, showed me how to do it
Peeped out these bitch niggas run right through it
Nigga, fuck workin' nine to five's
Bustin' this shit with half opened eyes
Motherfuckin' legend, if it ain't ruff
I blast on you bitches, fuckin' leave in handcuffs
Ruthless gangsta, definition villain
Niggas in the hood they're stealin' and rock dealin'
Pimps sellin' bitches' pussy, them niggas chillin'
We're young niggas, clockin' big figures
Who taught the motherfuckin' police?
That's the sound of the beast

[Verse 2]
Pro black nigga quick to drink liquor
Get up in your ass cause my temper much quicker
Run away slave, niggas can't fuck with this
Don't be known that I'm the fuckin' villinous
No ice on the wrist, just dick and black fist
These niggas, outburstin' they couldn't catch my piss
I'm like a fuckin' snake when I start to hiss
Pimp pimpin' shit, too cold for your bitch
Nigga tell that ho don't slam my door
We work too hard, what the fuck you think you're rappin' for?
Fuck the free show, fuck the free style
Fuck the bitch, fuck you groupie niggas 'til three thousan'
Hood shit rider, platinum mic' clutcher
Talk that shit these niggas gonna touch you
Then shoot them and rop them to teach these niggas a lesson
Fuckin' haters, hold up the peace sign
Fuck your mama later
