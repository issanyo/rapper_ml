[Intro]
That's right, take a voyage
Where? All the way down
Down where? Down where? Down where?

[Verse 1]
Niggas be thinkin the Villain has stopped givin Compton props
Nigga you smokin off that muthafuckin stress
That your ass was chokin
CPT, I'm straight out, that's my muthafuckin heart
You can't tear me apart, they gave a nigga a start
It's crazy niggas in that bitch, plenty hoes to match
Plenty pussies to fuck, and plenty bitches to catch
Niggas be doin what they got to do, family's a need
Compton niggas hit that pussy so hard, make it bleed
Niggas hittin switches, and movin pounds of dope
So cluck-head muthafuckas got they rocks to smoke
Niggas be killin other niggas when they get in they path
White muthafuckas gives a fuck, they sit back and laugh
These undercover tight bitches be playin the tease
Got my dick hard as fuck but she want the pennies
Niggas be hatin cause I'm doin what the fuck they wanna do
Niggas still be havin love for you (be havin love)
Uhh!

[Hook]
Compton (he's back to you)
Compton come back to me (he's back to you)
I know, I know baby

[Verse 2]
Niggas be at the park, tryin to set the pussy up for the night
Baby you can suck this dick just as long as you don't bite
Go back to the crib, we do that soopafly scene
Fuck your ass in the tub, rub my dick with vaseline
Make my shit stretch all down your throat
Quit tryna talk with that shit in your mouth just write a note
Or use sign language if you need some air
I'll chase your ass around the room, fuck that pussy anywhere
I'm just a Compton nigga, no matter where the fuck I be
Niggas don't get high, with me, I'm just writin what I see
It's reality that's all a real nigga know
All that "Stop cussin" and bullshit - it gots to go
All these niggas know, Villain kickin the real
I gives a fuck how these muthafuckas feel
Niggas hate me cause I'm doin what the fuck they wanna do
Niggas still be havin love for you
Check it!

[Hook]
Compton (he's back to you)
Compton come back to me (he's back to you)
I know, I know baby
