[Verse 1: MC Ren]
These niggas be acting like I fucked and didn't call them for weeks
Like they wanting a nigga dick in between they butt cheeks
They staight bitchy, without their bleedin' and Kotexes
The villain that go to Texas
Nigga got a plan full of O's and X's
What's your game plan? Niggas be saying you sabotaging me
But your bitch be sucking my dick, she be telling me that you dodging me
Like Piazza, a nigga gots ta, keep my roster with bitches sliding home
No licking your shit, your bitch is gone
Niggas be thinkin' they Makaveli, trying to bring drama
Soon as these niggas whoop that ass, you talking Dear Mama
But face to face, these niggas be cheesing like Velveeta
Lookin smoked out, hitting more pipes than Peter
Stuck with broke hoes, broke days and bay-bays
Pussies that they be fucking, used up and sideways
Stretck marks for days, she about two-hun
Gotta get pissy drunk, to fuck her and have fun

[Hook]
These niggas and hoes act the same, can't tell thm apart
Always runnin around, looking for some shit to start
These bitches run they mouth nigga, constantly
All in mine, nigga all the time
It ain't my faul that your punk ass broke
Mad, cause you only got stress to smoke
I heard that shit that you was plotting, nigga you can try
To fuck with MC Ren, but you must be high

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Niggas be high because they workin 9 to 5
But the Villain be hibernatin'
Wakin up at 5 PM
You see them niggas be bitchy
Because I won't let them up on my team
And give them a title like Hakeem, I'm peeling caps like tangerines
Telling niggas I should break them off chips
Get them in clubs free, and take them on trips
Free loading ass niggas lose all they sense
When they think they gone floss off my expense
Niggas be going corner to corner, bringing up the Vill
Asking questions like the popos, trying to see if I made a mill
Then they take that weak shit back to they home for pillow talk
She shaking her head like you telling the truth
But she want your ass to walk
What the fuck you expected? Always bitching at me
When she fucking your ass, nigga she be seeing me
Go look in the room, a costume for halloween
Of that black nigga you know who so you can live your dream

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
I hear your ho punk bitches talking shit, trying to have some say
Tellin'fother hoes they wouldn't give me no time of day
Still living with they mommy, she babysitting while you fucking
Getting county cheques and money from them niggas that you dick sucking
But nigga, why these bitches all in mine?
Why, nigga, hearin bullshit all the time?
Hoes from high school be wishing they coulda got with this dick
You know how they be in the car-hop clicks, muthafucking tricks
Now these hoes jocking, like all up on my style
You broke bitches, how you like me now?
Acting like making cheese is a muthafucking crime
If I said, "Drop your panties", bitch you drop them in a dime

[Hook]
