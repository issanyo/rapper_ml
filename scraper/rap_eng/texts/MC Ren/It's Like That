[Verse 1: MC Ren]
I be the one that they be pulling off that fool on the flow
After we be going toe to toe
I holds mine, never do I be talking no shit
Cause niggas that be talking that shit, always get it
Punk ass niggas go face down in a river
Other niggas deliver, fuck when they buck
They give a damn about you and your mamma
So get the fuck up outta here, nigga, and take the drama
Back to your set, back to your hood
To your kicking spot, your street or your block
Your crib or your rest, your mamma's address
Niggas gives a fuck, still I catch two to the chest
And then it'll be on, like some after school shit
Fuck a gun, a got to knuckles saying I'm getting one
My niggas say I clown too much
When I'm laying phat shit with my nigga Hutch

[Hook: Cold 187um]
Say what? It's like that, nigga
(Yeah, it's like that, nigga)
What? It's like that, nigga
(Yeah it's like that, nigga)
Say what? It's like that nigga
(You know it's like that, nigga)

[Verse 2: Bigg Rocc]
So it's on, I told my niggas to grab the chrome
Fucking with Rocc ya catch shots to your dome
Cause I don't give a fuck, that's the feelin'
Scoop up the Villain, it's time to do some motherfuckin' killin'
Cause I be kickin' shit, I'm thinkin' back in the days
When we used to scrap at the Compton Parade
I be throwin' vicious blows like Mike Tyson
Rocc greatest hits, nigga I'm the shit
Make the wrong move, then it's fucked up results
Niggas can't cope, yo, them shots he provoked
Comin' with that G style, make you hoes wild
Got my criminal record locked up in Rockford Files
Hank at the shack, yo, I call my Ponderosa
Clockin' more dollars than a Cali stock broker
You can call me your all around nigga
I loot, I shoot, if I how I kill a crew
So pass me a war like a King in the clutch
Fuckin' up shit with my nigga Ren and Hutch
And it's like that

[Cold 187um]
Bigg Rocc representin'

[Hook: Cold 187um]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
I be that nigga that put Compton on the map
So you bitch made niggas step the fuck back
My throne is a corner, wherever I lay my hat
Police always show up, wherever they say I'm at
They say real niggas don't die but niggas be dyin' everyday
Them devils be screamin' on niggas
And niggas be actin' like hoes in every way
But I'm a goddamn soldier it's my time to rule
Callin' hits like the mafia, nigga, from a bar stool
Hit after hit, every record is the same
Still getting mine out here in the rap game
Not a Black Caesar, more like a Black Pharoh
The gorilla killa devil in a double barrel, uh
Sawed off and hauled off, here I come again
Peace to all my people in the pen, cause Ren
I'll keep all my shit comin' phat
So weak fools take this it's like that

[Hook]
