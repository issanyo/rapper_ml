(*MC Ren and Tray Deee foot Steps shaking up the Ground*)
[Tray Deee] yeah, yeah, aiy y'all

[MC Ren]      Who? ha ha ha ha, where they at?
[Tray Deee]
Come on  (*Gun cocked*)
We stay ready, these niggas can't fuck with this shit
Ha ha, y'all didn't know me, we live, eat and breathe
Sleeve this gangster shit, nigga (*Gun Cocked*)
And dream that shit

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Who wants, them niggas that be makin' niggas shit all day
Groopie niggas be tryin' to come, no way
Mothafuckin' Villain don't play
This ain't no fuckin' Hip-Hop parade (*Gun cocked*)
We just some niggas from the streets
You mothafuckers be talkin' like Villain won't eat
Look at your bitch, she about to leave you to get to me
Mothafuckin' Villain with Goldie Loc and Tray Deee, Deee, Deee  (*Gun cocked*)
We be keepin' these bitches up out they distance
Bitch niggas be starin' but they don't want attempt us
Compton niggas be actin' crazy like Eighty Seven
Who the mothafuckers?, we're the mothafuckers (*Gun cocked*)
Take the whole westcoast then shut down the Ruckers
With mothafuckin' Low-riders, fast bikers and truckers (*Gun Shot*)
I'm the mothafuckin' Villain, fuck these other fools
Can't fuck with this, they got me pissed

(*3 Gun Shot*)

[Chorus: Bigg Rocc]
We on the East Side, where my niggas ride
Robberies, homicides, makin' mamas cry
They say who am I to be talkin' this?
We just some gangbang niggas on that thug shit (*Gun cocked*)
So who you fuckin' with?, my nigga Tray Deee
Goldie Loc, my nigga 'Ren brought the three
Woofin' the crap out, I seen up snake eyes
And your fear in your face cause you about to die

[Verse 2: Tray Deee]
I carried in the coast choas across America
Hardheaded nigga, never carried a Derringer
I own large caliber, hard to cause a massacre (*Gun cocked*)
Make my heat up bang quick like Abracadabra
Hit you when the passenger, laughin' as we blast at ya
With more storm troopers then the battle starts galactic-a (*Gun Shot*)
Blowin' up your subways, stoppin' up the tunnel
Fuck the microphone, bring your chrome to the rumble  (*Gun cocked*)
Turnin' up the silver satin, bout to get bang out
Right when we light it, have them put the flames out
Turnin' out the Award Show and snatchin' your platinum
Better stay up in them Hollywood suites and the mansions (*Gun cocked*)
Have my brain been givin' all you niggas a warning
We stay out in the streets so we gonn' get you regardless (*Gun Shot*)
And ain't no way to run cause we united and stretchin'
And if you want some real shit, get wild with the west then (*Gun cocked*)

[Chorus: Bigg Rocc with Goldie Loc]
We on the East Side, where my niggas ride
Robberies, homicides, makin' mamas cry
They say who am I to be talkin' this?
We just some gangbang niggas on that thug shit (*Gun cocked*)
So who you fuckin' with?, my nigga Tray Deee
Goldie Loc, my nigga 'Ren brought the three
Woofin' the crap out, I seen up snake eyes
And your fear in your face cause you about to die

[Verse 3: Goldie Loc]
Ha ha, speakin' my intuition, just listen to my mack sense
Tellin' my life story, gettin' serious with this "for real"
I got a problem with you, hate me comin'
And runnin' with this scum and drum
Fill you up with hollow points and get your lungs with the dump (*Gun Cocked*)
We're from the city, where the city gets shitty
Hittin' off brand niggas get filled up with fifty (*Bullets Sprayed*)
Slugs to the back of your window
Stick to the script, so your ass won't get hit with this (*Gun cocked*)
Somebody stop me cause I'm makin' too much noise down the runway
Swervin' cracked the sun roof, let them hear this .38 (*Gun Shots*)
The streets is gettin' bigger and thicker
To be exact my nigga, they want us out to picture (*Gun cocked*)
Live it to the fullest, don't make me expose game
Close up that chapter, and clip off a little strangers (*Gun Shot*)
Bend your back to get rain up in
Take the dick with the Gin, then turn back in the friends (*Gun cocked*)
You're fuckin' bitch nigga

[Chorus: Bigg Rocc]
We on the East Side, where my niggas ride
Robberies, homicides, makin' mamas cry
They say who am I to be talkin' this?
We just some gangbang niggas on that thug shit (*Gun cocked*)
So who you fuckin' with?, my nigga Tray Deee
Goldie Loc, my nigga 'Ren brought the three
Woofin' the crap out, I seen up snake eyes
And your fear in your face cause you about to die (*Gun cocked*)

We on the East Side, where my niggas ride
Robberies, homicides, makin' mamas cry
They say who am I to be talkin' this?
We just some gangbang niggas on that thug shit (*Gun cocked*)
So who you fuckin' with?, my nigga Tray Deee
Goldie Loc, my nigga 'Ren brought the three
Woofin' the crap out, I seen up snake eyes
And your fear in your face cause you about to die (*Gun cocked*)
We on the East Side
