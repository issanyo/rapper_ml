[Intro: DJ Crazy Toones]
Just throw your set high on the air
Swear it's gettin' mighty funky out there
There's some bitches over here
There's some niggas over there
Can I get a ride on cuz
Yeah hahahaha, this is dedicated to all you, suckers, suckers

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I take flight like fist fights
You see bright lights, throwin' lefts and rights
I keep my jaw locked tight swingin'
Bullets seein' pass your head though your windows
And plastic falls, itâ€™s a wrap casket closed
I laugh at those who chose to get bold
When they loose a couple of souls, they crumbled and fall
Done watch the hunt down hurt, hang and hate the hater
Watch how we rise, ball and fake be later
Top dollar, anybody who got a problem with us
Could easly be found in crush
Our lush fillin' of rush, feel the adrenaline pumping
Me and Dub and the Escalade dumping
Crazy Toones productions, crank the ass
Limo tint down, let us track some tramps my nigga
When I walk I'm leaving holes in the concrete
Xzibit dropped that heat from thirty thousand feet

[Hook: WC]
Nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
Pull the trigger, give it up, lift the Chevy grill up
Nigga what, if you a crip or a blood
Nigga I don't give a fuck, let me see them fingers up
Nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
Pull the trigger, give it up, lift the Chevy grill up
Nigga what, got me throwin' up my Dubs
Through that nigga cutting it up, Toones is fucking it up

[Verse 2: Young Maylay]
Let me explain it, how I let the three wheel swanging
Drop it side to side, lock it up and then bang it
That's right, westcoast, L.A. originated
Prepared to take flight, now I'm the pilot desingated
Maylay cocked fist sitting, switch hitting
Hundred spoke twisting, five twenty stip gripping
See the bottom of the transmission, sixtey six inching
Showin' off how to quote it in Chrome suspension
Get my crown home, my bounce on
Cut the sounds on and stomping like Bow Wow
They already known I got the hottest rider going
Flatbed in the back, just in case I gotta tore them
Cause I sure give it up, let me catch them with that wheels stuck
Jumping out soundin' like Dub, yeah nigga what
Two licks on the switch, and they got up
With the ass in locked up, that mothafucker hot hop

[Hook: WC]
Nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
Pull the trigger, give it up, lift the Chevy grill up
Nigga what, if you a crip or a blood
Nigga I don't give a fuck, let me see them fingers up
Nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
Pull the trigger, give it up, lift the Chevy grill up
Nigga what, got me throwin' up my Dubs
Through that nigga cutting it up, Toones is fucking it up

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Who is it, the black nigga with the big dick
Toss it up with Crazy Toones taking your trick
But that bitch better swallow
I don't give a damn if she has fake ass rap model
Nigga get the fuck out here, "while below me down"
If she sucked my balls, if she want me to stink
I don't give a fuck I'm filled with curse words
Fuck all your radio geeks and nerds
And fuck the....my black ass still gon eat
Airplay they can't stop the Villain
Slanging mixtapes like my fucking ass dope dealing
Take a flight with Dub and X
Let me foot print like the mothafuckin' T-Rex
Who got next, we run the court
And pregnant your bitch while you pay the child support
Then I'm out, get the next tape
The Villainous make your punk ass can't wait

[Hook: W.C.]

[Verse 4: W.C.]
Knick knackin' police rollin' in the Patty wagon
Push it through the alley askin' where Dub and Toones at..and
Where them niggas livin'?, and how them niggas steal stack?
Is it really true them niggas grew up on that house
Niggas sit and chat, talk behind the loc's back
But when we come through, like what's happenin' they don't want no action
Little faggots, ya'll don't want it, cause we're pistol packin'
And you know the Childhood brothers won't get to gatin'
Click clackin', pass the cushion and zig-zag
Dip that let that mothafucker get back
Rip that 9 millimeter, clip gat
Bust a U where these niggas at?
Let's push that wig back nigga
Toones and Dub-C back to slaughter and shit
Switch tapes, Mixtapes yeah we started this shit
Finally me some real niggas y'all can feel niggas
To all my ground converse and Chevy Grill Lexus....

[Hook: W.C.]

[Outro: DJ Crazy Toones Talking]
Yeah, I wanna piss on all y'all nigga's graves before I kill you
Cause I'm tired of niggas claimin' the westcoast
And ain't playin' no mothafuckin' the westcoast arts
No doubt about it, that's some bullshit
