[Intro: The D.O.C.]
You don't want to see me cause I'm a Westside hustler
(West Coast)
And I'm through with you busters, so... (Yeah)
Give me my snaps cause you owes me, hoes (Bring it)
Khakis, Pendletons, and Romeos, nigga
West Coast Rat Pack
'88 real niggas, all black (Come on)
All back in your ass again
And you goddamn right we gon' win

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Ren makin' niggas run and duck
Hands on my balls, with the Doc not givin' a fuck
We bad luck, here a dick to suck
Your hoe can taste it
With the Villain DNA when she ready to chase it
I'm on another level than y'all
Niggas dressed up like they Pope John Paul
It's that new motherfuckin' formula, y'all
Fuck the dress code, nigga, come and smash the walls
Posted up, hoes choked up
Dick too big, 'bout to tear they throat up
Ren give a fuck, you askin' to get cut
Comp-town started this shit
So nigga, what? We all fucked up
But y'all lucked up; nigga brown nosin'
Drop this nigga shit, had a whole flame frozen
Whole game dozin', in it for somethin'
While y'all bitches y'all in it for nothin'

[Hook: Six2]
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
It's a must I get my hands on some dead presidents
Can't be hesitant 'cause the game goes on
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
It's a must I get my hands on some dead presidents
Can't be hesitant 'cause the game goes on

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
To fuck with Ice Cube
You gotta shit talk, big talk, Crip walk
Bang hard, run yards, flip cars
'Cause you fuckin' with millionaires, big stars
Only clockin' a grip will make our dicks hard
I come through when I handle my business
Like a goddamn menace
Niggas think I eat spinach
'Cause you need a dentist whenever I finish
It's the Grin-ich, with a gang of Lieutenants
WESTSIDE!
Connec-tion is the campaign
Niggas tryin' to run shit, pull a hamstring
I'mma do the damn thang, baby, do the damn thang
DANCE!
Ass bustin' out them pants
I can't stand it, ram it like the Animal Planet
The kinda nigga that'd take Janet for granted
Ice Cube got that shit that you grew up on
Blew up on, got a lawsuit at home
It's a shark in the swimming pool
Bad news comin' through on them 22's
And I'm huntin' you out, little kids got to run in the house
I'm dirty like the South, with a gun in your mouth
Click click
Nigga bang bang for that blang blang
Nigga get about as insane as Saddam Hussein
Give a fuck if he got him a gang, he outta my range
Give her shit stains when I get brains, nigga

[Hook: Six2]
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
It's a must I get my hands on some dead presidents
Can't be hesitant 'cause the game goes on
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
It's a must I get my hands on some dead presidents
Can't be hesitant 'cause the game goes on

[Interlude: The D.O.C.]
There it is, all right
There it is my niggas
We goin' back to the beginnin' of it
For real
But even in the midst of this old school shit
Our young gangstas still bring the pain
Doggy Dogg break them off somethin'

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Easily I approach
The microphone with a pocket full of dough
The king of the Coast
I'm rockin' the boat
Strokin' your folks
And loc'in' with loc's
Baby boy got smoked
Nigga what up, nigga what up
I need cheese, paper, bread, and butter
Nut up and cut up the beef
I got a '44 piece that'll shut up the {​*gun shot*}​
My niggas gonna floss to this
My Crip'ed out homeboys gon' walk to this
Creep to the spizzot, and stash my knizzot
Then call the Dizzoc, you know we got it lizzocked
Pop right back on your monkey ass
Then cock the Glock back on your funky ass
Been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Let's get loot like Snoop, nephew
Six Deuce

[Hook: Six2]
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
It's a must I get my hands on some dead presidents
Can't be hesitant 'cause the game goes on
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
It's a must I get my hands on some dead presidents
Can't be hesitant 'cause the game goes on

[Outro: The D.O.C.]
Here we go
Some of this millennium shit from the D.O.C., nigga
And as long as I'm fuckin' around with niggas like Ice Cube
Ren the motherfuckin' villain, Snoop Dogg
Dre the motherfuckin' doctor
Baby number one stunna, nigga
Jazze Pha, Nate Dogg and the kingpin, X to the motherfuckin' Z
Six2, my motherfuckin' Silverback Family, motherfuckers
So as long as I keep makin' these records, this is what you gon' get
The Shit, take that mother {​gun shot}​
