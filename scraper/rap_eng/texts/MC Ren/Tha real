[M.C. Ren]
Well it be the real niggas back

Bitch niggas be pissin a fit
But I say fuck 'em, when I buck 'em
Its that nigga with the cool and mellow shit
For your ass takin' niggas back through the past
All up on my nutz shit be swingin' like a fist
Can't even take a piss
If I did niggas would cut they wrist
In a muthaphukkin candy 4
Beat that ass with the switch
Then blast on the bitch
Who was all in my shit
Its that nigga Ren back for the 9-5
They say real niggas was dead
But this nigga be alive
So I'm puttin' it down wit that nigga E uh-huh

So here we go again with part 3 of the script
Makin bitch made niggas bite they lip, when we dip
So tell me how the phuck do it feel

And its on and pop and Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
