[Intro]
Niggas why?
Niggas please, please, please
Mayday, mayday, we're going down

[Verse 1]
Niggas screaming mayday cause Ren is kicking ass like Pel√©
Making fools run like it's a relay
But ain't no fools running sprints in shorts
It's just niggas shooting dice on the basketball courts
Waiting for the day to get revenge for the days
Of the slave ships, ya got the Bloods and the Crips
United putting guns together
To give white people stormy weather
But they can't hide under no umbrella
Cause we be breaking niggas out the motherfucking jail cella
Fella, so who gives a hell of a about the man - The KK Klan
So here we go again scaring people to death
Knocking niggas out with the indo on the breath
On the old english because we use broken english
So you can understand now who's the man
It gotta be me, I got the shit organized
So when you see us coming don't be acting surprised
Mayday on the frontline

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, he's been shot in the chest
Yo he's a redneck, huh, throw him with the rest
Of the dead bodies we be burying
With 2 million niggas got guns, and carry them
Shoot people first and ask questions later
Just like a nigga was a terminator
So niggas know what they gotta do
I won't bring up that Rodney King shit, cause that's through
Now back to the blue prints, behind the fence
A gang a niggas strapped and it ain't no coincidence
Now it's time for the camouflage
And all the niggas I can fit in back of the Dodge
Time to go to war but this ain't the Middle East
We're killing motherfuckers for revenge, fuck peace
So if ya see us, this is what ya do
Grab your shit and come along, we're killing cops in blue
Even if the black cops are down with them
Those sell out motherfuckers, yo, we're still gonna get them
Because it's mayday on the frontline

[Interlude: Lady Speaking**]

[Verse 3]
Now I gotta play run away slave like a fiend
Because they got me on the TV screen
They said they wanted me dead or alive
Cause I don't talk jive, I try to survive
Telling niggas what's the deal on the streets
So they don't get caught up in a gang sweep
They gotta let them have it
Shoot them in the ass like a motherfucking rabbit
Because they're losing altitude
Because they're getting shot down by a nigga with an attitude
Turbulence up ahead, yo
The storms getting thick, cause I'm a man with a big ass dick
Throw a grenade in their program
Let them know who I am, a nigga can jam
A little black nigga from the streets, over hip hop beats
With a clan and we're wearing black sheets
But we don't burn shit in your front yard
We'll beat your ass down on the boulevard
So abandon ship, grab your parachute
Cause niggas coming in khaki suits and steel toed boots
Stomping motherfuckers in the way of the process
Or they might get a bullet to the chest
It gotta be me, I got the shit organized
So when you see me coming don't be acting surprised
Mayday on the frontline
