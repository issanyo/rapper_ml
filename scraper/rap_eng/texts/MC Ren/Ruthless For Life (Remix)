[Intro:]
[Jubee]     What's up Ren?, I'm trippin' man
[MC Ren]    He ain't in there, that's what I told y'all
[Jubee]     What you talkin about man?, he is dead
[Bigg Rocc] He thinks Eazy is alive man, Eazy is gone
[MC Ren]    y'all wanna go down there and check it out
[Jubee]     I ain't tryin' go out in the rain man
I ain't tryin' get this wet, you what I'm sayin, in my chucks
[MC Ren]    So y'all scared of the rain, let's go down there and check it out
Y'all down, y'all wanna roll with me?, come on
(*Rain pouring*)       (*thunder and lightening*)

[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? "why?"
Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[MC Ren]
Nigga ten years passed, what, and we still up in that ass
Villain make it all continuin', ugh, look at all the shit you in "that's right"
Eazy-Duz-It, happy like the shit we used to do
5 niggas comin' out the C-P-T  "what what what"
So fuck you, time changed for the good  "alright"
Niggas in the hood be comin' up:
Villain can you set it off again, you know you should "yeah"
Villain just take this shit back to 1989
Where these niggas shit I'm bustin'
Niggas know they couldn't find "they couldn't find"
Dream Team lovers, ugh, Egyptian fan based
Ugh, Villain hit the scene all them fools got erased
Threw a mothafuckin monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for you niggas that be thinkin "what what what"
That your flows be on tizight
Alightin' what I wrizite, jokin when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts when I MC
If it ain't rough it ain't me
[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? "why?"  (*Great Explosion*)
Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[MC Ren]
All y'all mothafuckin G's, nigga like Eric Wright "that's right"
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight "is tight nigga"
Cause when y'all niggas started rappin', who'd you tryin' to be?
I'ma slap you cause you lyin' if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin' "nigga, nigga"
Shoot the government before you niggas started rappin'
That was clone city "what's up" I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to 2000
Try to block it out, but you never knew how and when
I walk through the crowd, I'm seein' mothafucker's brain
I hear their bitches sayin' ask MC Ren "MC Ren"
Makin fools sway when I roll to King Tech's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can Kizz My Black Azz one more time, ugh

[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? "why?"
Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[MC Ren]
I run that hundred miles also I can M.C.   (*Great Explosion*)
Villian with that bomb so I get with L.T
Ain't nothin' changed, we find them, fuck them, then flee "right"
While you hatin', pillow talkin, with that bitch, she want me
Niggas weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggas be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Invest in drug money, shit still gettin' hit
What it take for y'all to quit, Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like 'Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot   "like this"
With my little brother Jubee and that Bigg homey Rocc "that' right"
Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat
Ugh, when this shit dropped, niggas clownin' in the streets "niggas clown"
The saga continues right before your eyes "nigga"
Villain gives a fuck G, cause this is Ruthless for life

[Chorus: MC Ren X3 with explosions]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? "why?"
Cause I'm Ruthless for life

(*Rain pouring*)       (*thunder and lightening*)
