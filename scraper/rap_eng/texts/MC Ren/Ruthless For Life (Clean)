[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 1]
Homie ten years passed, and we still up in that *ass*
Villain make it all continuing, look at all the mess you in
Eazy-Duz-It, happy things we used to do
5 homies coming out the C-P-T, so *fuck* you
Time changed for the good
Homies in the hood be coming up
Villain can you set it off again, you know, you should
Yo let's take it all back to 1989
Where these bombs I be busting, fools know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers, Egyptian fan based
Villain hit the scene, all them fools got erased
Threw a monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, things ain't never been the same
Opened up doors for you fools that be thinking
That your flows be on tizight
Biting what I wrizite, joking when I recite
Villain manuscripts when I MC
If it ain't ruff it ain't me

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 2]
Yo Compton City G's, homie like Eric Wright
You can floss for your trick, but you know this rhyme is tight
Cause when y'all fools started rappin, who you trying to be?
I'mma slap you cause you lying if you don't be saying me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tapping
Shoot the government before you fools start rapping
Now it's clone city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at The Shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou'
Try to black it out, but you never knew how and when
I walk through the crowd, I'm seeing every brain
I hear their trick saying that's MC Ren
Making fools Sway when I roll to King Tech's
Because I started cussing all you fools getting checks
Ruthless for life, see, that be my state of mind
Y'all can Kizz My *Black* Azz one more time

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 3]
I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villain wants that bomb so I get with L.T
Ain't nothing changed, we find them, hit them, then flee
While you're hating, pillow talking, with that trick, she want me
Fools weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sipping, y'all fools be tripping
Make the West look like ass, all full of *shit*
Investing *drug* money, shit still didn't hit
What it takes for y'all quit, Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shooting videos trying to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowing up your spot
With my little brother Jubee and that Bigg homie Rocc
Full Circle, everything gone repeat
When the record dropped, fools clowning in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Villain gives a *fuck* nigga, cause this is ruthless for life

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
