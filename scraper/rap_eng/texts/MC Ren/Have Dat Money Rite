[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Ain't no sunshine when my weed gone
That's why my black ass barely at home
You little bitches tryna steal my throne
Sell your ass like a bitch to get the villain chromozone
It's that westcoast shit, niggas learned it well
Compton motherfuckers homie platinum sales
Where that real rider shit, Ren and Chill get it in
For the niggas hitting corners y'all just stuck in the pen
If you dropping within keep your head to the sky
Don't try to run away from shit, even devels can fly
Whip that tear from your eye, weakness can't be shown
What the fuck you talking about, you supposed to be grown
It's that G-shit, nigga villain dropping some shit
Nigga give a fuck if this shit is a hit
You gotta know who to fuck with, keep your shit tight
Cause at the end of the night you gotta have dat money rite
