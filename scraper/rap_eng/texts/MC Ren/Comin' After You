[Intro: MC Ren + Ice Cube]
Real nigga shit, y'all niggas know what time it is
They never thought they would see this
Check this shit out right here

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
In case you didn't know my flows rock the sho'
I'm making sure you niggas don't try me no more
Weak shit you talking and I'm surprised it's selling
Do-for-self niggas full of felon's who the fuck you telling
Braggin bout money where that shit be at
After videos all that shit we never see that
Bitches with big asses blunts and big cars
Shot calling niggas pissy drunk in them tittie bars
Ren assasinating, all of these
Wack ass rapping niggas that say they selling keys
And pimping hoes and smoking a million blunts a day
Shooting a hundred niggas and saying he walked away
Without a scratch - some of that bullshit f*ck outta here
Living with your mama talking about a hundred grand
Nigga please, who the fuck you think you talking to
Real niggas coming after you, we after you

[Hook]
Fake ass ballers who we talkin to
We coming
Lying on records bout what you do
We coming
The shit y'all doin is played out and through
We coming
To come with that shit we come after you

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
It's the Don Daddy with the Villain, who you killing
Oh we hate them, come verbatim with this cap peeling
Top billin, make a million
Paparazzi, chase us through the tunnel in the Maserati
Now they got me on Hard Copy didn't have to shoot Versace
Yet you still wanna watch me
Motherfuckers wait they whole fuckin' life and a day
Hopin that we can reunite N.W.A
All purpose, try to serve us, gettin nervous, more murders
Shit can just turn into the circus
Standin over the carcass
You look like the kind of nigga that'd press charges
We the largest, we the biggest, we the Niggas, With the Attitudes
Wee longitude you latitude, have some gratitude
To the niggas that started this shit
Been around forever bitch, we smart at this shit
Don Mega, MC Ren, Ren, Ren

[Hook]
Fake ass ballers who we talkin to
We coming
Lying on records bout what you do
We coming
The shit y'all doin is played out and through
We coming
To come with that shit we come after you

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
I make the Planet Groove nigga more than BET
Yo' bitch tied up phoning home like E.T
So kick in that fifty grand
Before you find body parts nigga in Japan
A motherfucking lyricist nigga top cop
I'm makin hits what yo bitch ass talking bout
That same old shoot them out and smokin fifty blunts
That's why your shit ain't coming out for like fifty months
Ain't nobody trying to hear your nigga outdated
Your wack ass quit tellin niggas that you made it
I'm never faded like a ghost Villain disappear
Buy some shit to resurrect my dick the next year
Ninety eight ninety nine to the earthquake
How much garbage these mothefuckers go and make
You better shake, fuck that here I come strong
Best believe Ren will rock the shit all night long
We out

[Hook]
Fake ass ballers who we talkin to
We coming
Lying on records bout what you do
We coming
The shit y'all doin is played out and through
We coming
To come with that shit we come after you

[Outro: Ice Cube]
Full circle, nigga, full circle, nigga
Before we did it, y'all niggas was rapping like urban bitches
They were nerds before us, Ren, they were nerd before us
