[Verse 1: MJG]
A natural fact, that I pimp tracks and freak around
The game got cracks in them pipes, it's leaking town
My lines blow your mind, your senses remain puzzled
You're trying to give me props, but you can't, your mouth muzzled
Attacked by the weight of the bass, in your chest
8Ball, MJG, MC Ren, nevertheless
Cause we's the most
My real-ass lizards, let's make a toast
And single out the bustas and force them to get ghost
And coast to coast
We shows loves in network
While some try to impress people, and get hurt
Deep thoughts cloud my conscience as I curl
Up in the corner on hand, and then I hurl
Call my girl, tell her I'm drunk and can't make it
I tried to drink the whole damn bar and couldn't take it
That's all right cause come sunrise, I'm still rolling
My nuts the only title I'm claiming and still holding

[Hook: MC Ren]
Now who in the fuck wanna come and represent?
You bitch ass niggas y'all be too hesitant
I, take my black ass, down to the south
Bitches wanna fuck me while I'm in the Suave House
Nigga, who in the fuck wanna come and represent?
Oh, I know you suck that dick, acting too hesitant
We, MJG, Eightball, Villain, make that straight nigga shit
That's how these niggas feeling

[8Ball]
Guess wo popped up straight up out the cuts
With lyrical buckshots spilling all a nigga guts
Touch whoever witness strays when I displays
A thousand different ways to get paid with a phrase
Days go by, I be hibernating getting high
Dreaming about L.A., penetrating something fly
Down in H-Town, or somewhere in the Mound
All eyes on me baby, cause I get around
We be like, connected weak-ass niggas get ejected
Ooze like slime dig this hines when we wreck shit
Uncut, coast to coast, slanging audio dope
Mangling MCs, leaving them, dangling from ropes
Boast, trying to be doper than most in my profession
Me and the villain, microphone killing - no blood spilling
Phat raps with much cheddar in the tellers
8Ball and MJG and MC Ren forever

[Hook]

[MC Ren]
Fuck that, bitches, the villain be out in Houston, Tex.,
To fuck with them niggas from Suave, who wanna flex
Bitch niggas got kidnapped with dicks in they mouth
For fucking Compton niggas, and niggas from down South
8Ball, MJG, where you at Space age-ing
Y'all probably got all the bitches paging
Sucking casian, writing left nuts, chapstick and lips
While bitch-ass niggas spending chips, just to see the hips
South-West connection, bitches bow the fuck down
Fuck how them other niggas sound
Villain be hated by niggas because they bitches pussies throb
Ready to slap that ho every time a head bob
Niggas be killing me, got that nigga T-Mix
Pull the fucking remix
If these words don't hurt you, nigga, got them stones and sticks
And some Compton-ass niggas, to make you fade to black
With some crazy Houston niggas in the cut in the back

[Hook]
