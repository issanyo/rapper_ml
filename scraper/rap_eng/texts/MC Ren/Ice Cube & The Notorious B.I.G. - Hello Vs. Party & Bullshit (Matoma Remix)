[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
The motherfuckin world is a ghetto
Full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
When the smoke settle..
I'm just lookin for a big yellow;
In six inch stilettos
Dr. Dre {​Hello..}​ perculatin keep em waitin
While you sittin here hatin, yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
Hopin that we penetratin, you gets natin
Cause I never been to Satan, for hardcore administratin
Gangbang affiliatin; MC Ren'll have you
Wildin off a zone and a whole half a gallon
{​Get to dialin..}​ 9 1 1 emergency
{​And you can tell em..}​ It's my son he's hurtin me
{​And he's a felon..}​ On parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin a plea, ain't no stoppin a G
I'm in the 6 you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily I drop a ki properly
They call me the Don Dada
Pop a collar, drop a dollar if you hear me you can holla
Even rottweilers, follow, the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? Nigga I'm a scholar
The incredible, hetero-sexual, credible
Beg a ho, let it go, dick ain't edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
While you hand picked motherfuckers givin up transcripts

Villain blows up yo' spot
Take yo' notebook yo' bitch and yo' Glock
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
You slapped her ass that's alarmin
Cause she want my Worm like Carmen
We chin check niggas, them thin check niggas
Run trains on gold diggers beware these fo' niggas
Scarin motherfuckers like Stephen King flicks
Makin' niggas clear the room like a dyke fleein' dick
Makin 2nd II None shit, nigga like Quik
So when I bomb first nigga who you rollin with?
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
Cause you could lose it in a tussle nigga watch me hustle
Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin a muscle
Bitches - all in the back they knees waitin to buckle
Same time same channel don't change the dial
Niggaz4Life, fuckin your wife, these niggas wild

[The Notorious B.I.G]
Yeah, Yeah, and you don't stop, and you won't stop, and you don't stop

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G]

I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is ... (Hello)

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G]
Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a Bad Boy
Niggas wanna front, who got your back? (Biggie!)
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast you, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks (Hello)
