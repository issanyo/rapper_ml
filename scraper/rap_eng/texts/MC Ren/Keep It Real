[Intro: Cold 187um]
That's what the fuck I'm talking about, that real shit nigga

[Verse 1]
Living room packed, laid back on the flow
Niggas can't see me on the Madden with Frisco
I'm running fools straight to the dirt
While my man Train talking on the phone the evil curse
Niggas waste gas driving down the same streets
And hood rats swishing for the passenger seats
Flag them down, like they flagging down to get a taxi
Too good to ride a bus, tricking is a must
Another day kicking back, the scientist is hard at work
Thinking how to get paid, kicking back in the shade
Or call Will and Temple where my homie down by Zeenie
With the bald head it's too hot for the beanie
Sitting on the porch niggas run the stop sign
Hookers sell they bodies around the way, ain't hard to find
Right in the corner of McDonald's parking lot
Peeping out their hair cause that spot is hot
And that's real

[Hook]
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Letting punk niggas know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggas always wanna be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Letting punk niggas know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggas always wanna be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down

[Verse 2]
Randy up the street cutting up the fresh fade
And Compton P.D. around the corner 'bout to raid
The yellow helicopter hanging around like a gnat
And hood rats yellin' out a car 'where the party at'
My robbing train go and get a deuce
And niggas around the way don't give a damn about a gang truce
But I gotta lotta love for my people
And like they ain't tryin', niggas just keep dyin'
I won't be like most niggas and just come
And shoot my video in Compton and disappear for a year
We make fools like that check the spot
One for the treble jack yo ass in the parking lot
Cause handkerchief headed niggas come around faking
Bragging about that money they be making
Bootlegging, butt dancing niggas just better chill
Before I tell them how I feel and that's real

[Hook]
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Letting punk niggas know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggas always wanna be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Letting punk niggas know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggas always wanna be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down

[Bridge]
Yeah, uh, break it down
All y'all busta ass niggas
Do it like this, 1995
Uh, yeah, come all y'all fake ass niggas to this

[Verse 3]
Goin' to the pad hit the beach up on the pager
Here comes Korleone up the street in the mini-Blazer
While the dominoes start to get shaking
The same time that the BBQ start baking
I don't eat swine, but I take a turkey burger
I can't take worms, that book's full of germs
Homies pass by, some stop and conversate
On a gang a topics we start to debate
On why in black neighborhoods is always towed down
And white neighborhoods ain't one piece a trash around
So we gotta do for self and quit bitching
Recycle black dollars - so we can roll Impalas
Every street got their own rap artist
On every cover every brother got a gun tryin' to look the hardest
But some deserve a slap cause they laid down they strap
When they hear that's a rap and that's real

[Hook]
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Letting punk niggas know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggas always wanna be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Letting punk niggas know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggas always wanna be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down

[Outro]
Yeah, puttin that real shit down in '95
This goes out to my nigga DJ Train, know what I'm saying?
