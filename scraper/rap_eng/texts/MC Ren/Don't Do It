[Intro: Mr. Biggs]
Well, well, well, well, well
Don't go the bed with no strike on your head
No, no, don't do it, don't do it
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
Yeah, don't do it
Well, well, well, well, well

[Verse 1: Bigg Rocc]
It's bigger picker hopper, Bigg Rocc is bucked you
Punk motherfuckers, ain't no others can deal with my brothers
Nigga duck for cover
John Doe killers make the whole world suffer
I promised to get them, I snitch at large
Nigga is tryin' to get me locked up for a charge
Feds tapped my phone, surrounded the nigga home
Follow me every where, I'm never left alone
Uhh like the paparazzi, niggas wanna stop me
I'ma win like rocky, you motherfuckers watch me
Only God can stop me
We're deep like notches "killer"
Cock my shit cause I'ma Compton nigga "Compton"
Stroll on the streets, fuck gettin' cuffed up
Sittin' in a hall, waitin' to die old
Fool I'm too bold, holdin' my balls
If I died that's my motherfuckin' final call, nigga..

[Chorus: Mr. Biggs]
Well, well, well, well, well
Don't go the bed with no strike on your head
No, no, don't do it, don't do it
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
Yeah, don't do it
Well, well, well, well, well

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Who the nigga sayin' fuck the police
Young nigga with the khakis frees
Run around Compton with my niggas like Cold Cheeps
Throwin' rocks at them black and whites
Fuckin' them chicken heads, house party nights
Motherfucker the shit gettin' turned out by search lights
Motherfuckers don't think we have blast
Better tell these motherfuckers that the streets made us grow fast
The teenage nigga sellin' them rocks
Cluck heads bringin' niggas new shit in a box (*Door Knocked*)
Six in the morning, heard eight knocks
Then my black ass ran about eight blocks
Lookin' for freedom, but my ass trapped in
Nigga fuck the Pen', they're tryin' to hold Ren
Nigga look at all bullshit I got my ass in, it's enough
To have my black ass nigga cuss in them handcuffs....

[Chorus: Mr. Biggs]
Well, well, well, well, well
Don't go the bed with no strike on your head
No, no, don't do it, don't do it
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
Yeah, don't do it
Well, well, well, well, well

[Outro: Mr. Biggs]
Well, well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well, well
Don't go the bed with no strike on your head
No, no, don't do it, don't do it
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
Yeah, don't do it
Well, well, well, well, well
