[Verse 1]
All these niggas acting crazy up
Pimp holder men, I'll make you dusty like the Middle East
Fuck up your peace, I'll take every thing you got
Mothafucker like two deuces
How you're blowing up my mamma pager just to make a truce?
New milleniums, but knowledge helped me to stay the same age
Since 1987 been' featured on the Rap page
Moving at the speed of sound till my shit's mixed
Got enough hits, if your ass need a fix
Bitches naked to get fucked up
While the Chevy bouncing like your hover
I talked to niggas on top amounts with the street dialect
Gangster shit revised
If the translation hit your ass since '85
Taking mothafuckers too many many schools
Chilling on sundays with another rules
Simple minded niggas can't comprehind that
All y'all talking about is blunts and gats

[Hook]
I'mma hit you like this, fake ass niggas
These lyrics is getting drop
The mothafucking shitting will never stop
Nigga shaking up the earth
Peeps and the villain is, got you mothafuckers feeling this
The pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, oh yeah
I said the pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
The black guys flipping streets shit like the quarter burnt
Groupie mothafuckers tryin' to check every word
These wack ass niggas, y'all elementary
Villain got the lyrics locked 'til the next century
When the westcoast is drowning in the Pacific
I be holding my dick, in the studio and being explicit
While y'all be pumped gas at forties bitch stations
Kissing ass, erasing the common lines for that rotation
My hesitation nigga only to sex
Face to face black Dracula
Better hide your necks
Or you can has it, more than votting loot
You one-hit nigga, realize you're just a fluke
C-P-T in the books, nigga like gauge shycome
All the shit I ever made nigga floating in your dome (Whassup?) My dick erected like empire state
Mothafucking villain be the great

[Hook]
I'mma hit you like this, fake ass niggas
These lyrics is getting drop
The mothafucking shitting will never stop
Nigga shaking up the earth
Peeps and the villain is, got you mothafuckers feeling this
The pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, oh yeah
I said the pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Peeps]
Unload from the G off road and off stage
Dose explode like rex hit with a 12 gauge
Still I rips, into scripts, produce hits
The moment I return from my indo trigger
That's why I stutter, twenty 3rd, yeah
Twenty three times more savier
Still in first deal as I wait to get straps
Hustle for tracks, then I hook some with my Chingolet
Jet like rat, it's B.G. and when we bang it that way
The limit is the sky way, don't play
Got Goerge hit the fuckin' high way, goes way
And if you walked in this house with him
Then you bitch ass nigga bounce with him
With out ever heat??
You will survive then we'll collide in the range
Butt and sweatin' tears never pays
These days, dulo shit, I'm willin'
To get the feelin, I'm corrupt like killin'
Known that I'm fuckin' with the Villain

[Hook]
I'mma hit you like this, fake ass niggas
These lyrics is getting drop
The mothafucking shitting will never stop
Nigga shaking up the earth
Peeps and the villain is, got you mothafuckers feeling this
The pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, oh yeah
I said the pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, oh yeah
