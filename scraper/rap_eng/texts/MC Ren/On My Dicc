[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeaaaah

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Uhh, from the days of wayback, before Demo' street-Ass-Niggas
Where you hoes, I have to think of a way
To gain with mentality, plus make money
Even Fred got all the honey
Bullshit talant shows got me ready
While my life start to review like Rock Steady
I'm the truth, nigga fuck that bitch
I don't scratch, where I don't hitch "hell no"
Fuck the clubs, same hoes there from '91
I gotta bad bitch don't gotta beg for one
Erase your vocals, find some new shit
Cause ain't nothin' new what your ass gonna spit
You're the hardest motherfuckin' crypt, nigga you're lyin' and shit
Take this dick don't trip
Known damn where they chase you out the hood
After you can toss them, you say you wish they would
We puffin' big green, bitch come and flockin'
On my motherfuckin' hotel, door they knockin'
They want some dick, these bitches don't quit
John Doe is the shit, nigga...............

[Chorus: Bigg Rocc]
We reperesent that real shit, thug shit
Drag you in that mud shit, hard times for my niggas so be cold with
Got aim and we so thick
Givin' motherfuckin' beats across the world as we drop hits
Niggas know that they really can't fuck with this
We the niggas that your bitch wanna roll with
And we the pimp niggas that she wanna stroll with, she's on my dick

[Verse 2: Bigg Rocc]
I don't give the fuck like Mike Tyson
Gangster shit I'm writtin, 12 rounds like niggas fightings
Uhh, throwin' blows, Dazzy and Dones
By the end of the night, I'll be sittin' on your throne
Got six million ways to kill, choose one
I might hit you with one bullet when I pull it
New to your ass, since started to your ass
Show the way I got my blast, I'm not fuckin' maggot
You're the one to be, hum with the scary niggas
It was funny to me, when you squeezed that trigga at me
Tryin' to earn stripes off a fool like me
I walk upon niggas, you ain't like me
Uhh, and make sure that you dead as the door knob
Yo, bitch niggas John Doe want my job
Tryin' to fill my shoes, I'ma may killer
Never gave a fuck about the snitch-Ass-Nigga.........

[Chorus: Bigg Rocc]
We reperesent that real shit, thug shit
Drag you in that mud shit, hard times for my niggas so be cold with
Got aim and we so thick
Givin' motherfuckin' beats across the world as we drop hits
Niggas know that they really can't fuck with this
We them niggas that your bitch wanna roll with
And we the pimp niggas that she wanna stroll with, she's on my dick

[Verse 3: Chip Dirty]
I feel like givin' it up "givin' it up"
Deep in some gangster cut
Blow them wangster dubs, like wait on no fake hoes
I shake those, like the soul shaker
I floss for all my Rump Shakers
Now drop that ass like it's hot
And if ain't with fuckin' then you can shake the spizzot
Kick rocks, the rest hated by hoes man
I ain't no motherfuckin' pimp with a hell plan
I'll tell you, what you can do with all that whoopty whoop
Hold heat but you scared to shoot "nigga"
If we was in the East I would speak on some mad heats
But nigga we in the West, Lo-Lo's with mad beat
And switches, which is will make the rider complete "nigga"
Candy blue paint and them tropical feet
Niggas know me, it's your nigga Dirty
Speak that Compton shit from my nigga you heard me.....

[Chorus: Bigg Rocc X2]
We reperesent that real shit, thug shit
Drag you in that mud shit, hard times for my niggas so be cold with
Got aim and we so thick
Givin' motherfuckin' beats across the world as we drop hits
Niggas know that they really can't fuck with this
We the niggas that your bitch wanna roll with
And we the pimp niggas that she wanna stroll with, she's on my dick

[Outro: Bigg Rocc]
Dick, dick, dick
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeaaaah
