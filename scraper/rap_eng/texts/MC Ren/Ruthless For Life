[Intro]
Make a long live the Villain nigga, fuck a intro

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 1]
Nigga ten years passed, and we still up in that ass
Villain make it all continuing, look at all the shit you in
Eazy-Duz-It, happy like the shit we used to do
5 niggas coming out the C-P-T, so fuck you
Time changed for the good
Niggas in the hood be coming up
Villain can you set it off again, you know, you should
Yo let's take this shit back to 1989
Where these niggas shit, I'm busting, niggas know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers, Egyptian fan based
Villain hit the scene, all them fools got erased
Threw a motherfucking monkey, wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't never been the same
Opened up doors for you niggas that be thinking
That your flows be on tizight
Biting what I wrizite, joking when I recite
Villain manuscripts when I MC
If it ain't ruff it ain't me

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 2]
All y'all motherfucking G's nigga, like Eric Wright
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight
Cause when y'all niggas started rappin, who you trying to be?
I'mma slap you cause you lying if you don't be saying me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tapping
Shoot the government before you niggas start rapping
Now it's clone city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at The Shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou'
Try to black it out, but you never knew how and when
I walk through the crowd, I'm seeing motherfucker's brain
I hear their bitches saying that's MC Ren
Making fools Sway when I pull the King Tech's
Because I started cussing all you fools getting checks
Ruthless for life, see, that be my state of mind
Y'all can Kizz My Black Azz one more time

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 3]
I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villain wants that bomb so I get with L.T
Ain't nothing changed, we find them, fuck them, then flee
While you're hating, pillow talking, with that bitch, she want me
Niggas weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sipping, y'all niggas be tripping
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Investing drug money, shit still didn't hit
What it takes for y'all quit, Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shooting videos trying to look like 'Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowing up your spot
With my little brother Jubee and that Bigg homie Rocc
Full Circle, all that shit gone repeat
When the shit dropped, niggas clowning in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Villain gives a fuck nigga, cause this is ruthless for life

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
