[Hook]
Same old shit every day and every night
When it gets dark niggas get outta sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
Cause ain't no telling if some shit might pop tonight

[Sample]
This type of shit happens every day

[Verse 1]
Same old shit every morning when I wake
I'm thinking of another bitch's money to take
I start to get dressed, yo, my bitch is still asleep
Go put the 9 millimeter gun in the jeep
And let it warm up and bump Marvin Gaye
I wish somebody would come out and have something to say
I take out my dick, beat my girl wide awake
Grab her hand and kiss the bitch and tell her "have a nice day"
Then go around the corner cause I fuck her best friend
It ain't a bitch that I don't put my dick in
I can't stay long I gotta hit the boulevard
Put your fist in your pussy bitch and breathe real hard
Go to the shack with the G's, that's mega
Getting drunk busting with Larry Csonka on Sega
Niggas can't take it always having a fit
Yo, but it's the same old shit

[Hook]
Same old shit every day and every night
When it gets dark niggas get outta sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
Cause ain't no telling if some shit might pop tonight

[Verse 2]
Playing dominoes with a nigga and some ho's
Hot pussies and hard dicks and slapping big six
At this bitch's house for the very first time
Some niggas came in and try to take what's mine
Tried to jack and the bitch played it off
She was in it all along, bitch screaming "what's wrong"
I said "what the fuck," the MAC-10 start to bark
Unloaded the clip and then escaped through the park
I think I hit one but I needed to shoot them all
Now I'm running like shit - thinking about getting hit
Now this bitch, that was hugged up with me
Was with these niggas letting off slugs at me
Oh shit can't trust a bitch I should've known
Fucking with a hoe, now a nigga's cover's blown
But I got away without getting hit
Yo, cause it's the same old shit

[Sample]
This type of shit happens every day

[Hook]
Same old shit every day and every night
When it gets dark niggas get outta sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
Cause ain't no telling if some shit might pop tonight

[Verse 3]
Forecast shows it's gonna rain 20%
I gotta pimp a ho so I can make up for the rent
Cause ain't nobody gonna gimme shit if I don't take it
There's too much motherfucking money, so I'm gonna make it
And when I make it, yo, I'm still the same nigga
So quit acting like a bitch if my pocket's getting bigger
I'm pimping out my game like Freddy told me in the mack
Always watching my back, with my god damn gat
I do what I gotta do, I sell my rocks like a slanger
Or say "I don't give a fuck" and be a gangbanger
Or go back and forth in the pen pitching three
Having little motherfuckers looking up to me
Yeah, the shit feels good, I won't lie
A real ass nigga til the day I fucking die
So pass me the weed so I can take me a hit
Of what? - Of the same old shit

[Hook]
Same old shit every day and every night
When it gets dark niggas get outta sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
Cause ain't no telling if some shit might pop tonight
