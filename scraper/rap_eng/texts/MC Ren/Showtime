[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Born and raised in the CPT
Newest sixteen niggas couldn't fuck with me
Blowing out niggas in parties was elematary
18th nigga the may, rap history
Smoke the best weed hoes exotic
Pretty toney ya bitch, she told me she got it
The shit is too simple you niggas you make it hard
You ass should resign nigga never resigned
Hub city taught my black ass well
That's why's no ending to this villianist tales
And in the street niggas still respected
From the first fuckin mic I blew in and soundchecked it
Check one-two, nigga split the swisher
Let me knock down three like (...) fisher
This is Calli, where the Villain was born
I'm on stage at the Staples nigga you in the form
And it's...

[Hook]
You know when villain hit the stage

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Niggas know I'm the mad scientist
Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't the motherfuckin villain, nigga
Y'all niggas know I fucked wit the best
All this fuckin G shit came from the west
Best weed with the baddest hoes
Can depaint deuces, trays and 4's
But fuck that I'm on my way to the show
Bitches wanna jog before I walk to the door
I'm like Game give it up for the hub
I'm like my nigga Don Mega throwin the dub
Got love for my niggas in the bay
Compton, Watts, Long Beach, LA
So don't trip on the California love
Villain just gotta give it up - thats whats up
Y'all see me when I come to your town
I hit the stage, do my shit homie it's goin down
And it's...

[Hook]
You know when villain hit the stage
Grab the mic start doing my shit, it's
