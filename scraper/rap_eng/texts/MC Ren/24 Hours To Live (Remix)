[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Nigga give me 24 more
I take my shit and villain be out the fucking door
The only thing I can to is grab my nuts slow
While y'all be chasing pussy, wasting time, getting blown

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Sky diving, scuba diving
To Evel Knievel stunt car drivin'
Bungee cord jumpin' off a bridge
It's hard to breathe with a fractured rib
I can't take this shit
Let me see how much more time I got to spend
Hit more skins
Back up in her pussy
Up in the butt
I gotta let off
A few more nuts
I'm starting to panic
I'm starting to sweat
Cause I don't really wanna die yet
Dizzy spells, flashbacks in my head
Niggas ain't want me to bein' happy when I'm dead
But I ain't goin' out unless 30 niggas die
I'm dying anyway so I'm thinking suicide
Run into a crowd of niggas dyin' by the pistol
Took the motheruckin' whistle

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
