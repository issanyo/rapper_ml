[Hook]
Same old {shit} every day and every night
When it gets dark fools get outta sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
Cause ain't no telling if something might pop tonight

[Sample]
This type of {shit} happens every day

[Verse 1]
Same old thing every morning when I wake
I'm thinking of another fools money to take
I start to get dressed, yo, my girl is still asleep
Go put the 9 millimeter gun in the jeep
And let it warm up and bump Marvin Gaye
I wish somebody would come out and have something to say
I grab my coat, wake up my girl right away
Grab her hand and kiss the trick and tell her "have a nice day"
Then go around the corner and kick it with her best friend
It ain't a hoe that I don't go deep in
I can't stay long I gotta hit the boulevard
Hitting corners, say what's up to the fools that's hard
Roll to the shack with the G's, that's mega
Getting drunk busting with Larry Csonka on Sega
Fools can't take it always having a fit
Yo, but it's the same old {shit}

[Hook]
Same old {shit} every day and every night
When it gets dark fools get outta sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
Cause ain't no telling if something might pop tonight

[Verse 2]
Playing dominoes with my homies and some ho's
I'm playing these tricks like I played big six
At this girl's house for the very first time
Some jackers came in and try to take what's mine
Tried to jack and the trick played it off
She was in it all along, started screaming "what's wrong"
I said "what the hell," the MAC-10 start to bark
Unloaded the clip and then escaped through the park
I think I hit one but I needed to shoot them all
Now I'm running having a fit - thinking about getting hit
Now this trick, that was hugged up with me
Was with these fools letting off slugs at me
Damn, I can't trust a hoe I should've known
Messing with a hood rat and got my cover blown
But I got away without getting hit
But it's the same old {shit}

[Sample]
This type of {shit} happens every day

[Hook]
Same old {shit} every day and every night
When it gets dark fools get outta sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
Cause ain't no telling if something might pop tonight

[Verse 3]
Forecast shows it's gonna rain 20%
I gotta handle mine's so I can make up for the rent
Cause ain't nobody gonna give me nothing if I don't take it
There's too much money to make, so you know I'm gonna make it
And when I make it all my homies got my back
So quit talking like a hoe if my pocket's get fat
I'm pimping out my game like Freddy told me in the mack
Always watching my back, with my chrome plated gat
I do what I gotta do, I sell my rocks like a slanger
Or say "I don't give a damn" and be a gangbanger
Or go back and forth in the pen pitching three
Having little fools around looking up to me
Yeah, that all feels good, I won't lie
A real ass G til the day I die
So pass me the weed so I can take me a hit
Of what? - Of the same old {shit}

[Hook]
Same old {shit} every day and every night
When it gets dark fools get outta sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
Cause ain't no telling if something might pop tonight
