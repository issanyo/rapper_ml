[Verse 1]
The year is '87 back in the 12th grade, G
When I used to hang with C
H to the I P hanging in the halls
Trying to get the young bitches riding my balls
We got dissed cause we was young and kept to ourself, yo
Because it's all about self
We used to try to get the number and the name
But back then they wanted motherfuckers in the dope game
We used to try to fuck with ho's
In our graduating class the one's with rumours giving up the ass
We go to a dance, we see ho's rolling eyes at my crew
But what the fuck can I do?
They wouldn't even give a nigga like me a chance though (Why?) Because my feet was my transport
You ask them to dance they start to riff
And on the way home niggas never gave us a lift
But now the tables turned around
Every motherfucker and his momma wanna be down
I see the bitches at the clubs, the same ones
They're thinking they're fine and also running the same line
"What's up Ren, we used to be in the same class"
I'm shaking my head, yeah, now listening to this lying ass
They ask me what have I been up to
Knowing damn well I make money from my record sales
I sip on my drink and say see ya'
Cause only a four legged pregnant mutt can be ya'
A hounddog

[Hook]
Do the dogcatcher, baby do the dogcatcher, oh
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

[Verse 2]
People that used to hate me
Now when they see me they speak first
But used to down my raps cause I cursed
They used to say I wouldn't make it cause I use profanity
And call myself a Nigga With an Attitude
But once again the tables turned around
Niggas trying to be down - walking up like a hound
Especially the ones that never had nothing to say
Now they talk to me like an hour everyday
Asking me what's up with Eazy
Or Dr. Dre, yo did he marry Michel'le?
Or did the D.O.C get his voice back
And niggas think I'm mean when I say I'm not a magazine
Cause when I come around I wanna kick it
The rolling niggas asking me for concert tickets
The same fools - that used to go to my school
When you see my on the streets just chilling, be cool
So if you really wanna be down
Don't crowd around a nigga like a hound
You fucking hounddogs

[Hook]
Do the dogcatcher, baby do the dogcatcher, oh
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

[Verse 3]
The hounddogs, they come in all shapes and sizes
Jocking round Ren with a gang of surprises
Nothing but a groupie in sheep's clothing
The shit makes me laugh when the homies want an autograph
I feel like I'm on a talkshow
Because they ask all the questions then say they gotta go
Never wanna know how I'm making out
All they wanna know is when my album's coming out
Or ask me "Yo Ren, when are you going on tour?"
I tell them the same time like I told you before
Then there's always one begging for me to kick him down
For pissing on my leg, I never knew you, you fucking hound
So go back to your home and fetch your bone
And quit retrieving on mine cause nigga you got your own
And talk about me behind my back, nigga please
So much of a hound, all you're missing is your flees
Scratching all day because you're itching
You're trying to get news wishing you was in my shoes
But tripping like that you'd never be down
Cause Ren don't likes a fucking hound
You straight hounddog

[Hook]
Do the dogcatcher, baby do the dogcatcher, oh
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me
