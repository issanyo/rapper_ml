[The D.O.C.]
Hey, I gotta get these lyrics together for the next song, Dre,
Take me to commercial.

[Dr. Dre]
Alright, bet

[MC Ren]
Yo! This is MC Ren, kicking it in a place with my homeboy D.O.C.,
And we gonna take a commercial break
So, we gonna kick it a little something like this...

Here we go, here we go!

[The D.O.C.]
D.O.C.!
N.W.A. in the place!

Come on, yeah!

Much peace to the Dr. Dre
Peace to my homie Donovan,
Yes, kids

Come on!
Get busy!
Get busy!
Get busy!
Get busy!
