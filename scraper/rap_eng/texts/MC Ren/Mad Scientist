[Intro: MC Ren]
Uhh, uhh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Darkside is where I'm comin' from all alone
Stranglin' niggas that's fakin' on the microphone
Cause I been around and I'mma be around again
Who is it? The black nigga that they call Ren
Won't be braggin' on the nine double M
My steel toe kicks, turn tricks, I use sticks and stones
And say what's up, to my niggas on the sidewalk
Put on my black to jack, so I can night-stalk
Cause to carry a big stick
For niggas that never shot a B.B. gun
Always talkin' about the trigger
Just to get paid, they make it all routine
Hear a firecracker pop, they runnin from the scene
There's too many records out, that ain't sayin' nothin'
And fake-ass radio stations ain't playin' nothin'
The shit gotta get back, it's time to MC
Too many new niggas ain't sure like Al B
Or wanna be L and only care from the cream
And pose like a bitch, to get put in the magazine "what's up?"
You ain't Fresh, you ain't Ride On, you ain't The Source
Nigga wanted to get with me, but shit was hoarse
Lookin' at my crystal ball for competition
Hypocrite niggas hang around to get a listen
Tried to peep it in my note book, but lost a leg
Got paralyzed neck up from what you read
A mad scientist

[Hook]
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to death
A fuckin' Mad Scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scarin' people to death

[Verse 2]
Weak-ass niggas keep eyein' this
But who can come and fade the mad scientist?
I been away from the public, cause I'm an enemy
With the black Beanie, disappear like Houdini
God of the universe, I control your soul
Shakin' niggas up from the bottom of the North Pole
And my double S, four fifty four
With my size ten, steel toe, shuffle through the floor
It's simple, don't wanna make it complicated
Cause you simple minded niggas might get frustrated
With your bang-bang boogie, cause Ren heard enough
Cause niggas nowadays don't come with the funky stuff
That I used to hear in '83 and '84
When shit had to be hardcore
Criminal Minded, you've been blinded
I'm lookin' for some shit like that, but can't find it
6'N The Mornin, police at my door
Niggas don't make that kind of shit no more
Simpin'-ass niggas make wave, cause Ren don't play that shit
I'm screamin' mayday, a fuckin' mad scientist

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sneaky sneaky, is how I creep up on you
I clear my throat and then I drop bombs on you
Now be honest, did you think the Villain will let
New niggas come out and tear out the work
That I put in, I'll pick up the pen then I write
Til the hand feels arthritis
Shit down and dirty, you would swear it's hepatitis
I be creatin' what your body longs for
And fake-ass niggas, this is who the song's for
A mad scientist, but I won't make a Frankenstein
I just write a rhyme that'll blow your fuckin' mind
You can't follow this, I didn't leave a scent
You can't fool the 5 percent, that me and Train repesent
I'm walkin' up right, and livin' civilized
The Messenger Elijah, yo, done opened up my eyes
Then the B-boys stance, on my throne in black
Niggas scared as hell because the Villain is back
From the center of the earth, I'm makin' way like the gopher
Nigga, by myself I'm takin' over
Ugh, a mad scientist

[Hook]

[Outro: MC Ren]
Yeah, yeah, I wanna say what's up to tribe of Shabazz
Yo, 1994, '95, a mad scientist
