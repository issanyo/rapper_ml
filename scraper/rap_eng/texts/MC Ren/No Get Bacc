[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Fuck that, here comin' that nigga called John Doe
We with the shit, make you not fuck your nigga no more
Cut the mothafuckin' grind, the streets ours
Puff us somethin' with "Bigg Rocc" nigga fuck some stars
Keep the bitch lit, while my balls grow
The bitch into your ass nigga startin' to show
You know what, who give the fuck if white boys get rap
When I'm runnin' through this alley nigga droppin' my strap........

[Verse 2: Bigg Rocc]
Ugh, nigga named John Doe "yeah"
Fuck with us you'll get tagged on your toes
Real spit, street niggas, all pros
Creep criminals, down to Dulo
The snitch, love to chat with the Po-Po's
That's a no-no, get smoked like bo-do, in four door
Aimin' at your toe for sure
About to fuck up your follos cause we loco nigga.........

[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
One time for your mind nigga smoke that
Two times on the grind, boo get strapped
Three times strike out us, no get bacc
All my niggas in the streets yellin' fuck that

[Verse 3: Chip Dirty]
When palm is lit, the chronic is lit
And you'll be knee deep in some gangster shit
When I spit, it gets fucked up
Who gives the fuck about your name
I'll remain named John Doe, shit ain't the same
When I'm blamin' it was mine, when I'm ain't in Islam
Bitch niggas rob rhymes, get bitches for playin' time
I'm "all in the game like a ref'"
Watch your step, I hop in your ass with the tech, nigga......

[Verse 4: Bigg Rocc]
The Ville, my nigga that I hang with "Chip Dirty"
It's the nigga that us pour licks with
Shit is so tight, we make haters stay sick
Bitches ridin' all on our shit
Back to the niggas should've leave a fifth
And find them in the alley layin' stiff
With the cut off dicks
Get the bitch to cops let that nigga slip
They done with his ass and they put him a casket.........

[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
One time for your mind nigga smoke that
Two times on the grind, boo get strapped
Three times strike out us, no get bacc
All my niggas in the streets yellin' fuck that

[Verse 5: MC Ren]
Niggas on the westcoast they love to gangbang
White mothafuckers trippin' they love to talk slang
Wanna be like us, but that shit won't last
Let the cops whoop their ass, they back to white fast
Ain't love for the niggas in the ghetto
They done say fuck all the niggas in the ghettos
Chip Dirty, what the fuck you're waitin' for
Nigga pull out your shit, come and fuck this hoe..........

[Verse 6: Chip Dirty]
Nigga I got a note book full of napalms
Have mothafucker lookin' for me like I'm been large
Outlaw, Joseph Wells got hoes for sale
When I speak this hard shit nigga supposed to bail
Get most in tail, the shit you see
I bit you'll be, and you be lye on niggas habitually
Eventually, now bitch nigga
Gover man and John Doe is puttin' mothafuckers out the game nigga...

[Chorus: MC Ren X6]
One time for your mind nigga smoke that
Two times on the grind, boo get strapped
Three times strike out us, no get bacc
All my niggas in the streets yellin' fuck that

[Outro: Quote till fade]
Shit don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
