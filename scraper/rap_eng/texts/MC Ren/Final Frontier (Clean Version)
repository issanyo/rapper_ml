[Intro: DJ Bobcat]
Hey, hey Ren, hey check this out loc
Hey man I've been hearing a gang of busters
Talking a whole lot of unnecessary madness man
What if one of them marks
Come at you the wrong way, loc?

[Verse 1]
I'll beat somebody's ass on this track just for the hell of it
There the piece of punk there's no tell of it
I don't give a damn I'll beat the fool like he stole something
And then I'll let the little sucker know where Ren is coming from
(Where you from, loc?)
I'm from Compton, everybody's on the wagon
I'm looking for people that's thinking
That they're the bomb, that's who I'm tagging
Never asking questions I just go right in and do it
And if you're thinking that you can step to Ren
You know you already blew it
Like I said before, fools want up in my shoes
But after stepping to Ren
They giving up rapping and singing the blues
Me and DJ Train dropping bombs like a B-2
So you should get the picture or if not, you get a preview
That we don't play one fit
Cause MC Ren ain't a brother that you wanna try and get with
Knock a fool out in my spare time
To keep myself occupied when I'm not busting up a rhyme
Writing dope songs that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier...

[Hook]
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
You step to me, you step to a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
You step to me, you step to a Mac-10

[Verse 2]
Now throw your hands in the air and let me hear yo say ho
Start the violence going on through an MC Ren show
I don't really care if people is fighting in the crowd
I only got one concern, that's my vocals pumping loud
I'm standing on the stage I got my people to my right
I bust a couple of verses
Then jump in the crowd and get with the fight
I hit somebody off in the head with a chair
The reason for that, the sucker he was standing there
Then DJ Train will grab the gauge - just in case somebody
Pisses me off; they'll be the victim on the front page
They're on their way to the morgue - to kick it with the rest
Of them suckers that I gave free room and board
So when you at my show
Let me see ya throw your hands up in the air and check a ho
Cause that's the only noise I wanna hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Hook]
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
You step to me, you step to a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black brother that they call Ren
You step to me, you step to a Mac-10

[Verse 3]
The final frontier makes the average rapper wonder
Why they do a couple of records and then they go up under
Try to copy Ren but Ren just can't be duplicated
Wack rappers making wack tracks so I come in and fade it
Slap the fools like *boom* if they have to talk back
Put my foot so deep down they'll have a hole and not a crack
You know it just makes me wanna laugh, cause people be coming to me
Asking me why did I leave size 10 Nike in their ass
I tell them I had to do it was part of the plan
To try to stop the fools jacking off by the hand
Putting wack records in the make
By using R&B wack singers in some hip-hop breaks
Trying to go commercial but they started out street
That's reason why they're still drivin in their two feet
Thinking they can diss Ren's flow, but singing and dancing
Don't go with the format that I be using in my show
It's just hardcore G's acting crazy on the stage
Wearing gangsta clothes yo and everybody knows
I'm doing dope tracks that you love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Hook]
