[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Who wanna step into the room?
Where that nigga Ren be at, making shit that's fat
Cause in '95 I gotta hustle for yo ass
Dropping shit like in the past
Rated double X, you in trouble when I hex
Niggas that be acting like hoes of the opposite sex
Cause fool I'm a soldier with a regiment
10,000 niggas marching to your residence
Fuck the president and his red, white, and blue
I never leave a clue with the shit that I do
Sport the black beanie, creeping with the flashlight
Coming with this phat shit just last night
The mad scientist from the center of the Earth
Dropping crazy shit whenever I drop a verse
Niggas in a rage, wanna see me in a cage
But um, I cocked the gauge when the ink hits the page
Fuck a grammy show and your mammy so now
What the fuck ya gonna do when I bust out the zoo
Cause ya don't know really who you're fucking with
You're fucking with the nigga Ren with the fat shit
And I don't give a damn

[Hook]
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
And I don't give a damn

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Three strikes for who? A nigga falling in the trap
What can I do to keep from falling off the map?
I ain't your everyday nigga just with a rhyme
I'll give ya that I don't give a fuck frame of mind
Make ya wanna shoot the police in the back
I'm crazy like Hady, cause devils be shady
The great elephant nigga hanging on box
A buffalo soldier without the dreadlocks
I don't give a damn, I created this shit
With the real niggas way back in '87
Niggas walking on my footprints in nine five
Fools hit 'em foul, can't hit a line drive
So get the hell away from my throne or a zone
My b-boy stance and shit is kinda full grown
Fuck the police cause I still feel the same
And fuck a lotta niggas being wack at the game
I don't give a damn

[Hook]
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
And I don't give a damn

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Who be talking shit about the great elephant?
Ren be busting raps, niggas busting caps
The bitch made nigga killa, that's who I be
When bitch made niggas come and try
Be a politician kidnap, who gives a fuck about 'em
Nigga never gave a fuck, I can live without 'em
Niggas wanna journey down the black brick road
They can see me changing in an I don't give a fuck mode
Then I explode, better hide your neck
Ya new whack niggas never get my respect
Then center of the earth is where I dwell
Your shit never sell, I got you tripping in a living hell
So back the fuck out my way, that's what I'm saying
Cause I'll be having hypocrite niggas balls hanging
And othe bitch niggas, be go licking them
But Ren just keep on picking them and slam
Cause I don't give a God damn

[Hook]
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
And I don't give a damn
