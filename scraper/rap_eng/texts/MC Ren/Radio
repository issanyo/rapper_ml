[Verse 4: Bigg Rocc]
My lyrics be leathal Daddy Lover
Makes you tell your mother that's a cold mothafucker
Not an undercover brother, by the dick too big
This Radio Station not for kids
It's for the hardheads, mothafuckin' riders

For all you hoodrats is good to go
Give the nigga a call on John Doe Radio....
