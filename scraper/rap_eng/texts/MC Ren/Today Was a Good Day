Just wakin' up in the mornin, gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin from the dogs, no smog
And momma cooked my breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin will I live, another twenty-four
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Callin' up the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which park, are y'all playin basketball?

Get me on the court- I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double, yeah
Freakin niggas every which way just like M.J., yeah
I can't believe, today was a good day

Creep to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
They saw the police and then rolled right past me
No question, didn't even look in a brother's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Move 'em in a circle of nigga and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Lil' Joe
Picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day

Left my homie's house, paid
Picked up a girl been tryin to do since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the booze she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call me the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
Drunk as hell but no throwin up
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
I gotta say it was a good day
