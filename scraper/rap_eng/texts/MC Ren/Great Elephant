[Verse]
I'm the original, one that niggas be biting
But fools wanna meet it, exactly what they did it
I been wrecking shit before thousand BC
Back in the days, nigga on your TV
Back when my nigga King Tee was the coolest
When 1580 still had the Mack Attack
It was just a handful busting on the west
Now it's like the pinky, now the shit's stinky
The Great Elephant is what they call me around the way
Cause I be stomping mothafuckers all day, uh
King of the jungle, listen to my roar
I be wrecking shit, keeping hoochies on the floor
They be getting hot, but I don't give a damn
I be caressing the mic when I hit jams
Making it moan and groan 'til I'm through
Cause I'm gonna make it real funky for you
Uhh, the walking black gaint, with the Desert Eagle
But how many niggas can I fit in my regal?
Niggas can't lift me in my place I live
Because of all the funky ass shit that I give
I got hypocrite niggas balls hanging in the back
Now go and take your pick and make it kind of quick
Cause I'm on a mission and they know I'm coming
Every time they hear I'm coming is when fools they start running
Fifty thousand troops looking like the Middle East
The shit I have to do, just to get a little peace
Cause busters, they wanna be chilling
With that nigga that be calling the villain
Can you blame 'em?
As I direct my boogie ain't watered down
My boogie be thumping, hitting fools way across town
Planners be digible, niggas stay cool
Coming up with phat shit sitting on a raw stool
As I think to myself that I never talked back
As I walk to the shack
Everyday that I'm living niggas be tripping
Cause all the funky shit that I be giving
It's like, yeah I'm still here, still in the game
I'm making that funky shit cause ain't nothing changed
Niggas they wanna know what's up, I'm still chilling
Yeah, I'm still the villain, yeah, I make the killing
I carry my big stick, walk down the block
Roll through Compton with my nigga Rocc
It's Ren the Mad Scientist busting tight-ass raps (Why?)
'Cause the nigga's gotta make snaps
There's too many clowns up on the juke box
Too many itty-bitties occupying the Rap City
So I'mma call Don Corleone with bad news
And make niggas an offer that they can't refuse
So hold your breath whenever I bust a verse
And hold on tight because it gets much worse
I set booby traps where ever that I kick it
But you can't come and kick it cause niggas might stick it
Ain't no watered down niggas on these streets
And ain't no watered down rhymes with these beats
A mad scientist straight outta CPT
That don't give a fuck if you can't MC
