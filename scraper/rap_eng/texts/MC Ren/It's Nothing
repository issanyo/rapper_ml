[Intro: Bigg Rocc Talking]
Say hell yeah "hell yeah"
Say hell yeah "hell yeah"
Say hell yeah "hell yeah"
Say hell yeah "hell yeah"
Say fuck that shit "fuck that shit"
Say fuck that shit "fuck that shit"
Say fuck that shit "fuck that shit"
Now scream "hhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy"

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Who the mothafuckin' boss nigga spill at the villain
We make them feel us, them presidents be beggin' to kill us
Dope dealers and the feds, bitches, fuckin' my head
Niggas dyin' over colors, nigga blue and the red
What 'Ren gotta do to expose your ass
Gays and bitches on the mic homey makin' me mad
Really who fuckin' with Ren
I don't give a fuck, how many crook shooter in, I'ma fuckin' veteran
R-E-N niggas know what it mean
V-I-L-L homey seldom seen
I'm with that nigga "Bigg Rocc" homey puffin' the green
I'm sick off the bitches always askin' why I love weed?
We got fucked up crews, fucked up clothes
Nobody give a fuck about the niggas no more
Then they got the nerve to ask what this for
This for mothafuckers growin' up in the ghetto........

[Chorus: MC Ren]
We the shit nigga don't need nothing
John Doe comin' through, fool we dumping
Mothafuckers mad cause we always make something
To make they shit nigga look like nothing, what

We the shit nigga don't need nothing
John Doe comin' through, fool we dumping
Mothafuckers mad cause we always make something
To make they shit nigga look like nothing, it's nothing

(*Sound of police Sireens*)

[Verse 2: Bigg Rocc]
I come through reppin' while niggas be half steppin'
Choose my weapon, let loose in your section
Fake-Ass, home niggas shot the next man
I'ma buy my own cheese, smokin' in the cali' grease
Why nigga, do or die, my niggas
Full of Alcohol, ready to pull the big triggers
High Powered, street kings, reigned by killers
Gangbangers, horny-Ass-Cop, dope dealers
Prostitutes, horny-Ass-mayers wanna be back players
Spend your paper, beware of the kill
Deal or get dealt with, I'm not the nigga to cross
Sluts do applause
To peel to the mothafucker, kill that mothafucker
Be real to the mothafucker, so chill mothafuckers
But shit gets start you can't heal mothafucker
It's over life like payin' bills mothafucker...........

[Chorus: MC Ren]
We the shit nigga don't need nothing
John Doe comin' through, fool we dumping
Mothafuckers mad cause we always make something
To make they shit nigga look like nothing, what

We the shit don't nigga need nothing
John Doe comin' through, fool we dumping
Mothafuckers mad cause we always make something
To make they shit nigga look like nothing, it's nothing
