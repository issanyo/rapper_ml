[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Niggas out here wanting these record deals
Dick-sucking groupies in twenty inch wheels
Everybody wanna be a fucking rap star
Had the world pissing like a tsar
Bullshit records be fucking my ass
Gotta ask my momma for some money for gas
Baby on the way I can’t parley
Like I used to, nigga I gotta partey
When you go platinum you’re paying them back
These motherfuckers tryna take the shirt of my back
Fuck this shit, I’m about to kill a record exec
Who ain’t got my fucking check
I’m fed up, whole company shut the fuck up
Don’t make bring some niggas through here, and have to buck up
But y’all niggas staying lost in the game
Only give a fuck about the fame, what’s my name?

[Hook: MC Ren]
Fuck the record companies
Fuck the bitch-ass A&R’s, nigga spit the cigars
Fuck hoes, groupies, I’m tryna get paid
Why these niggas lost in the game?
Fuck the record companies
Fuck the bitch-ass A&R’s, nigga spit the cigars
Fuck hoes, groupies, I’m tryna get paid
Why these niggas lost in the game?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
This rap game funny, everybody wanna sign a contract
Bitch niggas got your back
Spend your whole budget on chronic and hoes
Fat fucking pigs, give you nothing for shows
Conflicts to interest everybody knows
Take your manhood money sniff up his nose
These crack-head CEO’s get rich
Send they kid to college ain’t that a bitch
The short of end of the stick
But I’m that nigga they can’t be fucked with, all you want is a hit
Ren here’s some weed to smoke
Cause I know you ain’t fucking with coke
Take this pussy and broke
Just to get your ass on the mic
Want me to be Shock G and do what you like
Let me tell you what, I don’t give a fuck
And fuck your contract, here goes to in your back

[Hook: MC Ren]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Bitch-ass A&R’s ain’t never made shit
How the fuck you getting job when you never made shit
Telling me who I need to fuck with
You wasn’t raised in the street, don’t  know this street shit
Even if you’re from the hood, never made shit
You bitch-ass A&R’s never make shit
That’s why the game is so fucked up
These A&R’s niggas be knowing they locked up
Cause a nigga like the villain ain’t giving a damn
Blow the chronic out your muzzle, why the gangstas guzzle
Why the real MCs bless your ass
Freestyle like my nigga Grandmaster Caz
New niggas don’t know what I’m talking about
If you never sold a million don’t open your mouth
It’s that longevity that you’re dreaming about
But before you get a deal you’re ass is played out

[Hook: MC Ren]
