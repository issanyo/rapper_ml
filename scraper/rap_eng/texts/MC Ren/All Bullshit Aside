[Intro]
Yeah, check this out, Ren is back in this mothafucka for 93'
For all ya'll punk ass niggas
That thought I wasn't gonna do this shit
Back there talking all that shit
Won't believe me and my shoots
Fuck all ya'll niggas cause I come back hard 93'
So all you punk mothafuckas check this out niggas

[Verse 1]
I killed that bitch that weighed 40 ounces
Start hitting my switches cause my fo' hit bounces
Lean to the side like a mack would do
Or I can come off like a G and mothafucka I'll jack you
Cause niggas be talking that shit cause
I'm fucking the rest and I can't scrap
Who needs to scrap, my niggas comming from the back
So bitches hold your panties up, tick your tits
Cause mothafucking Ren is making mothafucking hits
Still sporting khakis keep my dick in my dickies
Only wave them up when bitches wanna give them hickies
Other than that, I'm looking up for number one
Cause number two I didn't trust, so my nigga had to bust
Burry him in the back another weedplants
My niggas said it was the reason why the weed is so dope
Grab another bitch twist the panties off the top
Open up my mouth and let the old english drop
But for a minute, couldn't walk a straight line
But that shit don't stop Ren from writing a rhyme
And punk mothafuckas can't hide, from a nigga
Homicide all bullshit aside

[Hook]
Yeah, put the fucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the fucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the mothafucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the mothafucking bullshit aside

[Verse 2]
Take donations from my niggas for the booth
I thinking of getting a case better yet I get two
Slap up the phone 6-3-2-15
Bitches ring the bell - in some fucking tight jeans
A kiss on my cheek, but my dick is getting jealous
She whispers she want suck when we're not around the fella's
Fuck that shit, bitch, do what you gotta do
Cause when you're fucking with Ren ho my niggas peoples too
Now I'm zipping on my blue black car
Thinking of the times in the boulevard
I saw people out there getting ganked shit
Niggas shooting every night - niggas looting and shit
Sending niggas straight to the coffin
And this type of shit in the streets it's very often
The shit is like an everyday thang to me
A lot of niggas on my block I have them slang for me
But that ain't shit, my true niggas stay down
The plasma hard G's don't be fucking around
And why would you even think to hide
Nigga cause you got all bullshit aside, check it

[Hook]
Yeah, put the fucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the fucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the mothafucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the mothafucking bullshit aside

[Verse 3]
Train came in in some khaki shorts
And he came up on the end at the basketball court
Taking niggas money shooting dice at the park
But mothafuckas start to leave when it starts to get dark
Cause bullets don't got no mothafucking name
When he's shot by a nigga from my mothafucking game
The niggas in the house just kicking it
Bitches on their knees straight licking it
Ren is in control, bitches call me the messiah
I sip on some old drink, fool, so I can stay higher
Khakis is creased, fresh from the surplus
My little nigga Bone starts to put up a fuss
So now they drunk his beer so he put out a tantrum
So we walk Atomic Dog, that's the will nigga anthem
So Juvi pass the movie it's "American Me"
The only movie that's allowed to be watched by a G
Now bitches just coming out of blocks and flats
So you can hear a smoking ho's your for rocks and blunts
Taking these bitches for a ride, treat them all like hoes
All bullshit aside
