Chorus: X2
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? (why?)
Cause I'm ruthless for life

Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass
Will I make it or continue and
Look at all the shit you in
Eazy does it like happy like the shit we used to do
5 niggas comin' out the C-P-T so fuck you
Time changed for the good
Niggas in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this shit back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggas know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothafuckin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggas that be thinkin
That your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me

Chorus X2

Yo mothafuckin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight
Cause when y'all niggas started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggas started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothafucka's bread
I hear their bitches sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time

Chorus X2

I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, fuck 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that bitch, she want me
Niggas weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggas be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Invest in drug money, shit, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat
When this shit drop, niggas clownin' in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Who really gives a fuck?
Cause this is ruthless for life

Chorus till end
