Always carrying a MAC-10, know what I'm saying?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck with
Always carrying a MAC-10 know what I'm saying?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck with

[Verse 1]
In '93 I'm wrecking shit so you can fuck what ya heard
I'm dropping plenty shit like a motherfucking bird
I still gangsta boogie if I gets my boogie on
Put my finger in my chrome keeps them fucking with my dome
Telling me to shoot all these niggas that I hear
Betcha gossip in my ear, I hear this shit every year
Niggas still talking like a bitch
Mad cause another nigga trying to get rich
I see ya telling niggas, yo Ren is gonna fall
But I think ya dumb ass had too much of the 8 ball
Your own motherfucker don't know
That Ren can play ya low, ya didn't know I'd fuck your ho
Now the kid that you're claiming, yo you're very quick to claim
But to me it's just my kid with another fucking name
And niggas wanna know what's the word
So peep it out, you can fuck what ya heard

[Hook]
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard

[Bridge]
Always carrying a MAC-10, know what I'm saying?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck with
Always carrying a MAC-10 know what I'm saying?
Ren is a nigga that you don't wanna fuck with

[Verse 2]
Niggas gimme looks like they wanna try and thump
Thinking Ren is just a chump, in the trunk I got the pump
Shoot it in the crowd, I shoot a niggas in the back
All my niggas in the shack started fucking in the lack
Some niggas rolled up and said the truce was dead
Train said fuck it, shot the nigga in the head
And it's on, all y'all niggas get to your post
Train just killed a nigga so we gotta do a ghost
Dip back to the hood, sip the 40 on the way
Cause the niggas from my motherfucking hood don't play
And ya still wanna know what's the word
Nigga fuck you and fuck what ya heard

[Hook]
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard

[Bridge]
Always carrying a MAC-10, know what I'm saying?

[Verse 3]
He say, she say, who gives a fuck what they say?
Screaming off at mayday the shit is going my way
Niggas can't believe that I'm so much of a G
Cause I don't let stanky bitches sit up under me
Now y'all niggas out there y'all swear y'all can scrap
Get your ass kicked makes ya wanna try to rap
Sprung on a ho yo smoking all your weed
Fucking with a bitch that ya really don't need
The click, my niggas from the click pimps hoes
Grinch, J-Rocc, my nigga Bone and Jubee Lows
Them fools can't even say a word
Cause a nigga don't give a fuck about what ya heard

[Hook]
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard
Yeah fuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard, what ya heard
