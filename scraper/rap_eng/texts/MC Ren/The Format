[Intro: MC Ren Talking]
(*Great Explosion*)
Yeah, y'all know what the fuck this is
E-A-Ski, The Villain, Boss Hogg
Nigga this The Format, bitches

[Break: DJ Format]
The Album is called The Pride Pressure, and ahh it's doin' that
And you know some people gon', you know, be in for big shout
Thinkin' that I wouldn't say what I was gonna say, but I said it
(*Great Explosion*)

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
It's been along time comin, but we made it
These mothafuckers hate it, how we gang related
How we can call on niggas with nothin' lose
And run up in your shit and start slappin' fools
Tell your popps to let fuck
Your mamma is like a slut in the back of my truck
We some foul mouth niggas, it's the Villain with that nigga CPO
Bitches we're gettin' dough, in case you didn't know
Hoes drop your drawers, out in the streets, I'm the Villain without cause
Make these hoes pause like my nigga Kurupt
E-A-Ski and me, we born to fuck her
So what's up, y'all want some dirty gangster shit
In the streets with your niggas hollerin' that's the shit
It's the V-I-L-L, you know the rest
Big names in the game nigga, comin' out the west

[Hook: CPO Boss Hogg]
It's the gangsters came, yes, it is man
And them gangsters ?? got a reason they came
They on the mission to get niggas in a gang of noise
All they're tryin' to do is stick to the format
Ski, Boss and The Villain, they're killin' on thang
Mission consists a gangster is gang
They on the mission to get niggas in a gang of noise
All they're tryin' to do is stick to the format

[Verse 2: CPO Boss Hogg]
Everybody mobbin' through mall
Might as well squab with the wall
You're way do too much gangsters y'all
Say they'll scared, you wouldn't find them
You ain't gotta be scared, just beware of the hood, it's mine
Bringin' a few things to a stoppin'
Right now, but first
Me and Boss shootin' out so quick with all the callapoppin'
Watch that kid like the howler
I understand the need for money, with half of half his power
They find an example, define the who-bang
Grip, Rock and The Creep Tah of the fuckin' full-Tang
You ain't doin' it like the old dubs
Mayhem back in the day, fuck how it was
Now, you just employee and stay on alert until I call out
And work it till you fall out
Gangsters, tailer made and cheque
On Ski, Boss and Villain killin' projects...

[Hook: CPO Boss Hogg]
It's the gangsters came, yes, it is man
And them gangsters ?? got a reason they came
They on the mission to get niggas in a gang of noise
All they're tryin' to do is stick to the format
Ski, Boss and The Villain, they're killin' on thang
Mission consists a gangster is gang
They on the mission to get niggas in a gang of noise
All they're tryin' to do is stick to the format

[Verse 3: E-A-Ski]
Do I got to put thug pizzle down, I'm sure ho not
You're spittin' gangster shit, but it's lackin' a lot
You mothafuckers tryin' emulate N.W.A
I wanna put y'all in flight, 800 G.W.A. (*Plane Crushed*)
Y'all don't know I spit hot shit, I'm an arsonist
With blue prints and a manuscript
Stop plackin' "what" you don't know what it means  "no"
Stick into some neutral colors, like light green
Killa Cali' "what" another nigga dead in the alley
Or in your block, cause he was popped by some crooked cops
That's gangster, the track backs it up "right"
Y'all rappin' over Disco's or spittin' shit that don't knock
And don't crack, dog it don't hot "no"
It goes mainstream in the streets then straight blouse
You better come to Mr. Ski for a track
Or it'll never be gangster, y'all niggas know that

[Hook: CPO Boss Hogg]
It's the gangsters came, yes, it is man
And them gangsters ?? got a reason they came
They on the mission to get niggas in a gang of noise
All they're tryin' to do is stick to the format
Ski, Boss and The Villain, they're killin' on thang
Mission consists a gangster is gang
They on the mission to get niggas in a gang of noise
All they're tryin' to do is stick to the format

[Outro: DJ Format]
I had worked on this album from like 1998
And now three years, three years and it's called The Pride Pressure
And trust me, it's just that...it was like every thing that had been on
Every thing that had been done
Every...just..it was just like one baller fight
