[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]

She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank


[Verse: MJay Vocals]

I was born and raise in the 466
Shawty she mad cause I'm humble as shit
When it comes to the lies she be taking the mic
Comes to the truth she be mumbling shit
My team is rollin in
It's pandemonium
Outfit be clean it's a crew of custodians
100's and 20's and 50's we holdin em
If you want static we poppin like sodium
I need the new new
Designer, foreigns, biddies love the team
That's the crew crew
Got em like voodoo
Control they movements, make em money blind with the blue clues
That's what they glue'd to
Guwla make em holla
Money, power more than sex girl
If I give you my respect, ether fuck the rest or you lose the best girl
If you gotta pick and choose
Then I'm cutting you don't have to make a move
You just took a L trynna fix the rules
Girl my temper shorter than a tickin fuse
If you try to play me I'm going crazy
Bussin it down like a AP
Shawty stop thinking you wavy
No you ain't having my baby bitch


[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]

She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank
