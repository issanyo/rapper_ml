[Intro]
I'm born with this mighty sin
Walking around just talking my shit
I'm born with this mighty sin
Thinking 'bout the naked women in my bed

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
I'm seeing pussy, I didn't know it
I never show no fear, I've never showed another nigga I never trust 'em
And if I showed a nigga, then I bust 'em
And I don't fuck with any rapper that I'm coming up with
You told your girls that I was sexy, when I really wasn't
You told me that you really loved me, but you really lusted
Then your ex came along, then the anger in my songs
Then I want to fuck your brains to the dawn song
Real eyes, realize, real lies
No lights when I lick them thighs
No strings, no ropes, no ties
Only times when I lay you down I beat it like it's mice
Paradise awaits, alleviate your waits
When you think of it, I'll take you to your place
Yeah, you nasty so we do it in the dark
Then you turn your phone light on, you turn me to the right like
I wanna be your lover, don't wanna be your friend
Girl let's explore each other, don't want the fling to end
I'mma do it again and again
Make sure you go and tell your friends
And you're grabbing me, you turn me on my back
And you kiss me on my lips and you tell me that you're high

[Bridge: Zhu]
See, you got me in your eye
Run that strip across your mind
Seconds that can cross them others
Don't believe that they all lovers, baby
I think it's time that we write each other's lies
You can scream my paradise until we cross the finish line
(I think), we can do it one more time
(I need), you too can be one more side
(You want), to be my lover
To be my lover, to be my queen

[Hook]
I have seen your face
Kiss me in my dreams
Tell me I'm awake
Paradise awaits
Baby you wanna love me
Baby you wanna love me
Baby you wanna love me

[Verse 2: Zhu]
Ooh, that dress so scandalous
And you know another could handle this
Shaking that thing like who's the ish
With a look in your eyes so devilish
You like to dance at all the hip-hop spots
And you cruise to the crews like connect the dots
Not just urban she likes the pop
Cause she was livin' la vida loca
