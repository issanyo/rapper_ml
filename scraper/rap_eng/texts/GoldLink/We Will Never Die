[Chorus: GoldLink]
Fuck around and die, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Put one in the sky, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Fuck around and die, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Put one in the sky, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Dude]
We will never die, real niggas, they multiply
I watch my mother cry, my man watched his mother get high
You know that I'ma do it, I don't even gotta try
I'm smokin' 93, that shit that put me in the sky
Man, hold that shit down, you don't gotta fuckin' lie
These bitches stay around, they just tryna get high
Them choppers, they come supersized, took a couple lives
I got a tear drop on my face but I will never cry
And she can't come around if she not down for the ride
Sippin' too much lean, my stomach up another size
Ain't into all the hype 'cause niggas tell too many lives
And I know he don't want beef 'cause he wanna stay alive

[Chorus: GoldLink]
Fuck around and die, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Put one in the sky, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Fuck around and die, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Put one in the sky, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Goddamn, young Link straight from the slums runnin' shit here
You don't know what I been through for us to start gunnin' round here
Main bitch always stressin', talkin' 'bout, "Why you never 'round here?"
If a nigga owe me money, put it in a bullet, aim it right there
Goddamn go, go, no show, nigga, don't fuck around about here
'Cause niggas get here same niggas sayin' R.I.P to the kids
And kids now can't fight no more, they just gun you down out of fear
And I ain't never had fears and I don't shoot or fight fair
And I'm as bad as these kids now 'cause I kill anythin' near
And trigger never had heart, the heart's been in the kids
Get Crisco, any my young niggas set you up here
And yeah, I don't know the end near and fuck the charters last year
Dancin' why the niggas get the reckless, .40 on me, had to tuck the necklace
Grab my waist and had to double check them just in case he checkin' what I think he checkin'
Wasn't made I was born tough, Glock be on me like a handcuff
Nine nine two's now my jeans cuffed, nigga thought he finna fuck the scene up
But then I told him

[Chorus: GoldLink]
Fuck around and die, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Put one in the sky, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Fuck around and die, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Put one in the sky, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Fuck around and die, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Put one in the sky, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Fuck around and die, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
Put one in the sky, hell yeah
We will never die, hell yeah
