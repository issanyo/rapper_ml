[Intro: April George & GoldLink]
Now I'm here, when I was 16
You were my everything
I'm hearing you wait and I'm still here
And you are everything
You were my heart, when I was 16
And you were everything
Almost 23, we're almost 23
And I'm still your everything

[Verse: GoldLink]
See, you was my girl, I was your man
You were such a blessing that I didn't understand
It was our love, it was all good
Stayed in Arizona, I was from the hood
I wish I went to school, I wish I only knew
I wish I didn't had to do the shit I had to do
I should've went to church, white man called me nigga
Should've listened to my mama but I had to pull the trigger
But listen anyway, I just wanna say
It's been like five years, shed so many tears
I waited every summer, every fucking summer
Tear away with me, just so I can see you
Things are changed up, shit is so serious
I met a great girl, I'm 'bout to have a kid
And by the time you hear this, I'll probably be here
Looking like his mother, singing "You should be here"
I wanted to wait to tell you but it's been so damn long
And I ain't tell nobody, so I put it in a song
I hope you really proud, standing in the crowd
Lookin' at [?] and I loved him with a smile
He better treat you better, he better eat you better
He better not ever hit you or I send some Crips to get him
So pour [?] a love and love was all I had
I know we didn't work out, owe you everything I have
Sincerely your man
