[Pre-Chorus: LEISURE]
You know I belong to you, to you
There ain't nobody else for me, girl
You know I belong to you, to you
There ain't nobody else in my world
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody

[Chorus: LEISURE]
And love, I only see me and you
And I, will not run away from you
And love, I only see me and you
And I, will not run away from you

[Pre-Chorus: LEISURE]
You know I belong to you, to you
There ain't nobody else for me, girl
You know I belong to you, to you
There ain't nobody else in my world
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody

[Chorus: LEISURE]
And love, I only see me and you
And I, will not run away from you
And love, I only see me and you
And I, will not run away from you

[Bridge: LEISURE]
Will not run away
Will not run away

[Verse: GoldLink]
Baby you know I fell in love with you, girl
You know, you know you wanna share my world
I got you, I got you where I want you, girl
Take you far away, to a different world
Baby you know I fell in love with you, girl
You know, you know you wanna share my world
I got you, I got you where I want you, girl
Take you far away, to a different world, baby

[Chorus: LEISURE + GoldLink]
And love, I only see me and you
I fell in love with you, baby
You know you're the one, make me crazy
And I, will not run away from you
I fell in love with you, baby
You know you're the one, make me crazy
And love, I only see me and you
I fell in love with you, baby
You know you're the one, make me crazy
And I, will not run away from you
I fell in love with you, baby
You know you're the one, make me crazy

[Outro: LEISURE]
Will not run away
Will not run away
