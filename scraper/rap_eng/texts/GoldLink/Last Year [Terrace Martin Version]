[Marika Hackman]
If it's depths to your rivers, I've picked one for you

[GoldLink]
December, I ran back into your arms like I never left
I think I'll love you 'til my death
I never really thought about the women that I left
But it's for my best they never reached into my chest
My heart is too protected, I've been chilling out the West
And ain't no better feeling when she leave you feelin' dressed[???]
That mean you're blessed
At 10 I knew I'd die at 25
Be the greatest poet from DC and never die
Because we never die
When you a legend man, you never die
She thinkin' sex, I'm thinking inner thigh
When it's time, when it's time, you'll be mine
We can rap when I die
Never lie, always right
Let's just die, you and I

[Marika Hackman]
Mississippi, come back to me
Oh, Mississippi, your coal-black sleep

[Joe Newman]
January came and took my heart away
March, my hugs became hold ons
April, I huffed like porridge on the boil
Morning May, I'm downwind from your shampoo
Ichi, ni, san, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyuu, jyuu
June, I learned to count to ten in Japanese

If it's depths to your rivers, I've picked one for you
Oh, greedy with Ss but equalled by Is
If it's stones for your pockets, I've collected a few
