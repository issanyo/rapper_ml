[Intro]
Didn't I tell you to get your tail up out of that bed
And get ready to go to  church?
You can't lay there and sleep all day
You gotta go to church!

[Verse 1]
Uh, what's a nigga in America?
Why the fuck is we here?
Why you tell me go back where I'm from
When you dragged me here?
Why we born to be poor?
Why our fathers be gone?
Why my father forsake us?
Why my momma so strong?
And on my momma I'd kill ya
On Faris, I'd kill ya
Nigga we were so broke, split 20 dollars a weekend
I, never cried but I realized what we were missing
My mind had a nigga on edge, I started sellin' and cheatin'
Said fuck the government, fuck the man
Fuck the Feds, fuck the law
See Que was fuckin my girl, too fuckin hungry to care
I started sellin mo', thinking bout Zip
Thinking what I did, fucked her friend
Fucked her homie, then fucked again
I started sippin on liquor
Couldn't cope wit the changes
We went back to the hood
Started slanging and bangin'
Feds was outside my house
Second time we got raided
Everything was for you
I want to get you that coupe
Black and young and a fuck up
I wanna prove this to you
That I could be more than a boy
But a father with you
I, wish I could change
But God you made me this way
So I'm gon keep my faith high
And bow my head and just pray
Like this

[Bridge]
Lord Lord, I need, your help, Lord
Lord Lord, I need, your help, Lord

[Verse 2]
I was so young and dumb
You were so young and dumb
Allan was in the picture
I was gon' pop dat nigga
Celebrity status now
You in a wedding gown
You was gon' be my wife
Move to a newer life
Tried to make dreams with you
Still I'm so proud of you
Look at the woman from a girl a flower blossomed too
The prettiest of them all
You was gon' have it all
You was gon' have the mall
But you still got it all
Shower you wit' some poems
Shower you wit' some songs
Remember the drawing I made?
Remember the flowers I gave?
Remember the time that we spent?
Remember the time that we missed?
Don't let that happen again
Go find you a better man
And go have that baby boy
And make him a better man
Tell him his mother loves him
Just like she used to love me
And play him this tape for you
Tell him what we been through
So we can both raise that child like we promised, we would do
