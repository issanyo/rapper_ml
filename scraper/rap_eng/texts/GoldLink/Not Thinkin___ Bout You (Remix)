[Verse 1: Ruel]
I've been telling my friends I’m cool, I finally got you out my head
But if I gotta walk by your house I take the long way home instead
'Cause I guess if I see you outside and you act like you're not mine I won’t let myself forget
'Cause every time, every time, every time I see you I know I'm not ready yet

[Pre-Chorus: Ruel]
No, I don't want somebody else, feels like I'm going through hell
So I just lie to myself just to prove

[Chorus 1: Ruel]
I'm not thinkin' 'bout you, you
I’m not thinkin’ 'bout you, you
I don’t wanna think about

[Verse 2: Ruel]
You got me feeling things I swear that I have never felt
And you have a way with saying words that always stick around
And if I saw you outside hanging out with another guy like you're better off without
No, I would try, I would try, I would try to look away till I convince myself

[Pre-Chorus: Ruel]
No, I don't want somebody else, feels like I'm going through hell
So I just lie to myself just to prove

[Chorus 2: Ruel]
I’m not thinkin' 'bout you, you (Oh)
I'm not thinkin' 'bout you, you
No, I don't wanna think about
No, I don't wanna think about you, no

[Verse 3: GoldLink]
Yeah
Make it cool I don't bother, I want you but you make it harder
I don't really know why I bother, but I want you like I want Prada
I just want your lovin' and I need your time and then I need a promise, so holler
When you need a friend, when you need a hand, when you need a kiss, when you want a man
I'm there for you, gentleman, I pull a chair for you
Shawty, yeah, I'm always there for you
Shawty, really gon' be here for you
I don't know, I just want the two of us to run away
Our love will never fade
Nowadays I really wan' get paid
So I do as we can fly away together
And we both can go
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

[Bridge: Ruel]
Suddenly I'm thinking 'bout
All the times we had, keep on rushin' back
Get out of my head, I don't wanna think about
What I'm feeling now, I wanna push it down
I wanna block it out, I don't wanna think about

[Chorus 3: Ruel]
You, you
No, I don't wanna think about (You, you, you)
No, I don't wanna think about (You, you, you)
No, I don't wanna think about (You, you, you)
No, I don't wanna think about
