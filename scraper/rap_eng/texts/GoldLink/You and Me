[Benny Sings]
You and me
Making love last forever (x4)

You’re breaking up… my cell phone…
Can you hear me loud and clear
I wanna tell you something you already know
Over and over
Come a little closer
Can you hear me
Love is here
I wanna tell you something I told you before
Over and over

Everything changes
Life is strange
But you and me
Making love last forever

You and me
Making love last forever (x4)

Time to redefine
Love is easy
ABC
We knew it all along we danced to the rhythm
We cannot deny
This is far from over
This is far from what we thought life would bring

Everything changes
Life is strange

[GoldLink]
We can fall in love one time
And I swear we make it last forever
Normally I wanna roll a tree and listen to the symphony that make you feel it in your gut and it’s whatever
Put my coat on your shoulder
Protect you from the weather
Making love listen to Benny Sings singing Feather
Lately lately baby you’ve been all I’m thinking ‘bout
Only you and me and all your girls be at my house
Talking ‘bout niggas ain’t shit
Fuck that nigga, no bitch
Ain’t it cool you got a nigga who is good and from the hood ooh
Fuck you like I should do
Ask me wanna marry me
I said I be glad to
Rush and get a tattoo

You and me
