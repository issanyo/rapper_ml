[Pharcyde (sample)]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher cause I knew I'd get a kiss

[Verse 1]
That old radio music had us feeling older than what we actually were
But I love that, love that
Motherfucking niggas with their hats back, skull caps
G-Unit tanks on grown men, bringing 90s back
Yeah I'm rocking Helly Hansen, but I take ya pelle pelle playin go go
2Pac, Hail Mary, Get a 'Hell yeah!', when you hear us bumping 'Dedication'
Master P had niggas wishing they could run a nation
Masturbating to porno flicks that my brother gave me
Popped guns at age 11 that my cousins gave me
My uncle told me how Len Bias could've been that nigga
Wayne used to be that nigga, and I'ma be that nigga
And I was crazy about the street game
I love stealing cars
I love hitting broads
I love being loud
Love being proud
Love living life
Love being trife
Love ducking cops
Love picking fights
What up! Oh, baby, yeah

[Hook]
Big ups to them niggas in the back seat rolling up them trees, yeah
Big ups to them niggas in the back seat rolling up them trees, yeah
Big ups to them niggas in the back seat rolling up them trees, yeah
Big ups to them niggas in the back seat rolling up them trees, yeah
