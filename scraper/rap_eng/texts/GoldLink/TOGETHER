[Intro: AlunaGeorge]
It’s hard to let it go
Let it flow away and never mind it
It seems so much more, so intense
So you never find a way to forgive
To forget, to be unconditional

[Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
We don’t have to fight no more
This isn’t the time to be tumbling on the floor
We just have to walk through that door together
We don’t have to fight no more
This isn’t the time to be tumbling on the floor
We just have to walk through that door together
We don’t have to fight no more
This isn’t the time to be tumbling on the floor
We just have to walk through that door together

[Verse: GoldLink]
Post the green at your momma’s house
Nigga need money, money the root of your momma’s house
Momma need food
Your momma, she claim from her future spouse
Why do I do the things that I do on your momma’s blouse?
Don’t wake the baby, daddy
And Daddy ain’t 'round enough
Watching my baby grow up alone in her momma’s house
You’re too busy writing these rhymes
I never lie in the rhymes
I rhyming harder and harder whilst flipping niggas for dimes
And she finer than my exes
Pistol-flapping, gun-totting and love-making’s heaven
Still be here tonight and hope to make it to heaven
Seven mentions seven
And my momma became a reverend
And my momma's house a sanctuary
I got new goals, got new wishes
Be a better father stop calling my women bitches
Red gold, green gold, gang do it right
And we never do it wrong, now we seeing better days

[Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
We don’t have to fight no more
This isn’t the time to be tumbling on the floor
We just have to walk through that door together
We don’t have to fight no more
This isn’t the time to be tumbling on the floor
We just have to walk through that door together
