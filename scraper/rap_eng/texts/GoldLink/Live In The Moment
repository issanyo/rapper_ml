[Verse 1: Craig David]
Hey girl, it's so nice to meet ya
Don't wanna come across eager
But real talk, I'm feeling your features
Your body shaked out, more bass than a speaker
Uh, and girl, I could see ya down
But never to let that defeat ya
'Cause when you're down with me
Forget all of your troubles

[Hook: Craig David]
And let's live in the moment
When one door closes, another one opens
So let's live in the moment
No point holding onto what's broken
So let's live in the moment
When one door closes, another one opens
Stop tryna control it and start living in the moment

[Verse 2: Craig David]
All the time you been wasting
Dating a waste man
I think it's time you replace them
With a young brother that will treat you amazing
Let me upgrade your day, we're all basic
Don't carry the weight of all the problems we had yesterday
And let me come and put a smile on that face
Forget all your troubles

[Hook: Craig David]
And let's live in the moment
When one door closes, another one opens
So let's live in the moment
No point holding onto what's broken
So let's live in the moment
When one door closes, another one opens
Stop tryna control it and start living in the moment

[Verse 3: GoldLink]
Yeah, gotta getcha, gotta getcha, uh-huh
Music play me be my baby, uh-huh
Got the eye on London Eye
I grab your thigh and tell you bring it back one time and uh-huh
Stroke it once, you'll get up on it 'cause I know it's fine
And you know I hang on ledges and that bottle heavy
I'm addicted to you, need you like a Lamborghini
I'm addicted to the body, looking what the starlit
I need you like the devil need soul
And there it goes, in the Uber, you should let me control
And put your mind to the side and put your heart in the booth
Tell you're tired and I promise I ain't losing the fort
Any woman, any woman, know you're good daddy
Yeah, we shooting till them heaters both daddy
All I really want is money, more from the truth
And I never lie when I'm to the fire then I boo

[Hook: Craig David]
And let's live in the moment
When one door closes, another one opens
So let's live in the moment
No point holding onto what's broken
So let's live in the moment
When one door closes, another one opens
Stop tryna control it and start living in the moment
And let's live in the moment
When one door closes, another one opens
So let's live in the moment
No point holding onto what's broken
So let's like in the moment
When one door closes, another one opens
Stop tryna control it and start living in the moment
