[Intro]
Oh baby

[Verse 1]
So sweet to me
Caramel, chocolate to me
Damn, I let it get to me
You really should, know you should to me, boy
Oh, you’re so lit to me, love
A little more than [?] to me, love
[?]
That’s why I really feelin' different when I’m witcha
I ain’t the same, no I ain’t the same
I had to switch up, all in your lane
You got me mixed up, all in the brain
Oh, feel like I’m fallin’ on you, aw babe
My homegirl lookin’ at me like I’m lost
Caught up in ya, I'm in love, won't get me off
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
You the plug, you the plug, you the plug
You’re like a drug, like a drug, like a drug
No control, no control, no control
(Learnin’ to love it, learnin’ to love it, learnin’ to love it)

[Chorus]
Feelin’ that emotion
Boy, you got me open
Feelin’ that emotion
Boy, you got me open

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Right, where the time, where the time
My newest chick bad, and she gonna get the prime
Best thing about her is she Asian with the time
I can’t say her name, but when you see her, know she mine
That ass like wo, her love like wo
Haven’t been back, and I meant to took her home
Took her to the Y, took her down to pho
Every I hit her phone, she don’t leave me ‘lone
Some call her a legend, some call her a god
I just call her baby and she call me Daddy Gold
And that’s just how it goes, and I get it, how I live
And I ain’t never trippin’ if a woman want the best
And if she want a kid, I ain’t even flinchin’
‘Cause trust me I’ma get your ass a hundred when I’m finished
Yes, she know the business and she really independent
But I’m tryna be the only young nigga who can get it
Fuck them niggas, man, yeah

[Bridge]
It’s so right
It’s so-oh-oh right, yeah
Ahh, you know that it’s right
(If you look in my eyes, you’ll see what I see)
You know like I know
(If you look in my eyes, you’ll see what I see)
[?]
(If you look in my eyes, you’ll see what I see)
[?]

[Chorus]
Feelin’ that emotion
Boy, you got me open

[Outro]
Ooh, so real, so real, so
We should go out on a limb
Roll through the city at 10
I do not know [?]
I keep it movin’ witchu ‘cause you got what I need and you know what it is
(Boy, you got me open)
Oh, [?] ‘fore I lift off
And my feelings got it bad [?]
For the whole world, let them all talk
‘Cause when they see us, they gon’ already feel it
