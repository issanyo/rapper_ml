[Verse 1: Moxie Raia]
Hey there Mr. Dope dealer
Thank you for smoking me out
And showing up like a healer
My mind's been running and racing
Need you to comfort me now
I miss the way that you turn me out
What you do to me
You figured me out
Its your energy
Nobody's home
And I'm your patient
Patiently waiting

[Chorus]
I want to feel so close to you
Until we pass out
We'll reach another altitude
Yeah we're so high now
I want to feel so close to you
Until we pass out
We'll reach another altitude
Yeah we're so high now

[Verse 2: Goldlink]
I met you in Miami and I knew you was it
I'm the plug, so you know a nigga cheap with the shit
A Bob Marley sweater that was passed to you and the fit
You so perfect and you thought I was forgetful and shit
Fantasies about you and me, a kid and a coupe
Riding with the work up in the trunk, and ride with the tool
Liter on my hip, a nina shoot the prettiest book
Let that penetrate a nigga that who be looking at you
Eyeing niggas got me hot, they got me fucked up again
I'm your healer, dealer, and your bestfriend and your man
We don't need to tell em bout us, we don't need to pretend
See, I ain't even care to ask you if you had a boyfriend
Cause when I see whats mine, I take whats mine
I'll say it once, I fuck you once
You know its mine, you scream for more
I feed you drugs, I heal your soul
You look me up and down and in my eyes, then you sing to me

[Chorus]
I want to feel so close to you
Until we pass out
We'll reach another altitude
Yeah we're so high now
I want to feel so close to you
Until we pass out
We'll reach another altitude
Yeah we're so high now
