[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Uh, bossed up, feelin' good this year
Word around town, we the real hood this year, uh
2-5, been alive this year
Real niggas with the shirt rockin' Solb, oh yeah
Uh, got in fights with my girl last year
She the main reason why I got a girl this year, uh
And Le Pearl with the crew still here
Creek niggas still lookin' but we cool right here
Bang, bang, Benning road boys
Group boys, you know how to get the girls, boy (uh?)
Hill road did it cool, boy
Fuckin' 'round with them niggas, get a clue, boy, yeah
One way, hear the oy boy
Stay away, Barry Farms really go, boy
Uh, Wyatt's park where we get it in
Tell the homie, tell the girl, tell her bring her friend, friend, friend, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Mya]
Coming from where we're from, ain't nothing easy
So no matter where I go, around the world
It's back to D.C
Whenever I can't, they don't understand
If you ain't for these streets
Said if you ain't for these streets, well
You probably wouldn't agree, but

[Chorus: Mya]
No matter where I go
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna go
Gonna go back
No matter where I go
No matter where I go
So I'm always gonna go
Gonna go back
'Cause it made me
'Cause it made me

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Yeah, 51, 52, 53, 54 Street
Where the bros be?
This shit, this shit's feelin' like bro street
Fuck around with a silent hitter that you won't see
Part of the party y'all don't ever know now, right now
You know how the bitches be when you tell them, "Keep it down," yeah
Attitude and a lotta fuck you's
But it's cool 'cause they still ain't face and we still groove
But I tell you what you won't to
Bet you won't tell these niggas that they better move
Uh, strapped up playin' Q Da Fool
Then I got a schemer doin' number one not the twos, yeah, yeah
Real nigga with a T-shirt rip, uh
Up and lookin' in the whole field, uh
Hundred niggas dead and gone last year
In the hood, livin' good, then we never change up, no

[Pre-Chorus: Mya]
Coming from where we're from, ain't nothing easy
So no matter where I go, around the world
It's back to D.C
Whenever I can't, they don't understand
If you ain't for these streets
Said if you ain't for these streets, well
You probably wouldn't agree, but

[Chorus: Mya]
No matter where I go
No matter where I go
I'm always on the go
Gonna go back
No matter where I go
No matter where I go
So I'm always on the go
Gonna go back
'Cause it made me
'Cause it made me
