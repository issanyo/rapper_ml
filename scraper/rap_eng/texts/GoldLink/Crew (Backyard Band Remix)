[Chorus]
See this money all around me
I look like I’m the man
‘Cause I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
Came out of hiding, girl
Don’t act like I’m your man, I’m just a fan
Oh no no no no
Oh no no no no

[Verse 1]
No no never ever ever be a nigga for a trick, got that?
1-4 is my habitat, young niggas get to clappin that
Money man, I gotta have that, real nigga, that’s a natural fact
Born to ride, lil nigga, I’m born to fire, come outside
1-4, I’m on the grind, money, dog, dollar at a time
Hunnids on hunnids, hunnids on hunnids
Money dog, that’s how I live
Real nigga, I’m in the field, drill, man, I run it
Shawty, man, she want me, but I don’t pay for no punkney
So I’m down for mine, real nigga, born to grind, what it do?
Sun’ll shine, you ain’t know? Get me, keep it cold
1-4, which one of you chicks in here got the deepest throat?
Hold on, grip the wheel, sip and spill, I live for real
You ain’t know? Okay, if looks could kill, I’d beat that
In them heels, okay, them red bottoms
Now gon’ gimme head ’til I’m dead, thank yah
Chachi, give me bo-dy
From the bucket to Maserati, I’m the killer of the par-ty, ayy!

[Chorus]
See this money all around me
I look like I’m the man
‘Cause I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
Came out of hiding, girl
Don’t act like I’m your man, I’m just a fan
Oh no no no no
Oh no no no no

[Verse 2]
Okay, shawty dope, that’s what it do; Me? Naw, ain’t nothing new
You fuck with me, I fuck with you, seen that body, I’m buckin’ you
Roll the window down, spit the game
Hold on, I gotta sip the drank
You love that, my cup dirty, my urine dirty, don’t give a fuck
Got one life, I’ma live it up, from the killa cut, I’ma lick it up
How you feel? I’ma get the bucks
Might split it with you, you a real bitch
Need a real nigga? I deal with you, field nigga, I’m real with it
You ain’t know? Hold on, hold up, put the steel up in the trigger
And keep riding, real nigga, and we on, come outside
Look, we grinding, show you money, look, we shining, hold on
Three times, that’s three fingers, M-A-C, bee stingers
Hold up, when we roll up, we pour up, money to fold up
What it do? We glow up, Backyard, understand
On the grind, hunnid on hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid at a time
Lil shawty, get with me!
Where you from? You from the south side?
Hottest pussy in the club, nigga, me middle finger up, oh my!

[Chorus]
See this money all around me
I look like I’m the man
‘Cause I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
Came out of hiding, girl

Oh no no no no
Oh no no no no
