Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
That I would even miss that bitch

Who knew, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Drinking on some liquor tryna' cope with the changes
And all my exes ain't shit, so they shall remain nameless
And all them bitches that I lied to ran around wit' just to spite you
And my mama met a couple and she told me they ain't like you
What you do to me
I'm still tryna find peace and unity
I hope it's you that get to speak up at my eulogy
Cause who could vouch for me like you could vouch for me, my baby?
I think I'm comin round to driving I might scoop you lady
So we can fuck like we would fuck way back at mama house
And we would eat late at IHOP or at the Waffle House, know what I'm talkin' bout
And I'ma hit ya phone cause shorty we should talk it out

[Hook]
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
Miss that bitch
That I would even miss that bitch
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
Miss that bitch

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
I started lyin' to my homies and I lied to myself
I might just check into an institute to go get some help
I got a sick addiction to women and fallin' in love
And when the lovey dovey shit is lost then the thrill is gone
But with you baby it was real and it was somewhat sincere
My vision clear, baby daddy duties ready for real
You had my lil seed, and we was still sellin' drugs
And I said fuck this music shit, I wanna house and a pug
Colombiana sexy mami, you was holy, we were public
I was nothing, you were something, I was crazy, you were crazy
I'm a god, you're a goddess, you're an angel, you're a comet
Girl, you shine bright
And when I look up in the sky I see your face light, yeah
And everytime I hear ya' songs, I take flight
And everything I ever said I will not take it back
But we were perfect, you so worth, man lets make it last
You shouldn't take me back
But we gon' be together
No matter who you wit' cause he ain't gon' be here forever
And God knows my heart and trappin' kept us rich forever
Tell Iava we livin better, and my mans doin' better
LA makes 'em jealous
What's love like this gotta do with this?
What's a love like this gotta do with this?
What's a love like this gotta do with this?
Even better, what's a love like this gotta do with this?

That I would even miss it
