[Verse 1]
Leggin' with the clip, we dump it off like V. RadmanoviÄ‡
Sorry homie, you know we not friends, it's all for politics
Politics, never get to see who really runnin' shit
Now you know who runnin' shit, you rappers on punishment
Poppa doc niggas they be lyin' on they brother dick
Everybody scared of "Lil' Linky", man it's evident
Feelin' like 50 way back in '03, aw geez
Talkin' 'bout goddamn, they on some other shit
3-0-whop screamin' 4-4 on my Louis shit
Poppin' tags, by the Mo', niggas on their dummy shit
Uh-uh trade my slave noose for a gold noose
Black and yellow goose with the boots and the jumpsuit
We shot a nigga at the go-go last week
We don't really care who got shot last week
Ridin' up the meter, plug 'ya village bumpin' Migos
I'm past shit, you don't want no problems with a G, D.C
PG, I'm the king of the streets
I never had to struggle with the gangs in a beef
Always ten toes so it's hard to defeat
And trust me nigga, I been lookin' hard for a beat, huh

[Verse 2]
He ain't rap this hard in a long time
U-Street, poppin' off, Vita do's and nines
Muslim homies always sayin' wallahi to the guys
All my life, been addicted to the power, ain't gon' lie, yo
Ain't no fear, I'm never wellin'
Put a shell up in yo
Ain't no tellin' when we do it, we just shoot and get ya
Got a bad thing, her name LaLa
Ass wide, with them tatas keep my mouth wide, uh
Northside bumpin' "Norf Norf," what a day
When I was a baby, I was wildin' for respect
You gon' get your head bust fuckin' with the set
Fuck around here and talk crazy, you get wet
We ran so many niggas outta here
Wonder why young Linky never had a fear
Say it once, say it twice, you gon' get a piece
Anybody ever ask what happened with the bitch

[Verse 3]
Runnin' from police, they almost had me when I steal
Way, way back I almost started sellin' then
'Round the same time bumpin' T.I. vs Tip
I ain't know who went harder, made me wanna sell a brick
Now we in the game enough, so busy from the bank
Niggas look to you like, "Damn dog, look where you came"
I don't give a fuck about shit, man yeah, I changed
And let your niggas style and I need my fuckin' change

[Verse 4]
DMV nigga, hunnid niggas under ya
Leggin', leggin', leggin', third leggin' with my peers
Rappin' ass nigga, but I'm quiet when I'm here
I'm always plottin' on a bitch, pretend I'm plottin' on my fears
We don't need no checks from the boys
We just need, respect from "the boys"
We don't wanna fall in love by the boys
So I just get the lil' reap drillin' with the boys, yeah
