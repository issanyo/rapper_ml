[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
I don't know where you came from
But I know I love you, that I love you
I don't know where you came from
I remember them

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah, I remember them
Mama why you got me rockin' Sketchers?
I'm a product of the product
And the product bought a Lexus
And the Caddy with the cool paint
Every day is special
Why you stressin' on a Tuesday?
Come and smoke a few
And I can show you 'bout the dominoes
High as I could be
High enough to go "Geronimo," Metro PCP
Uncle Sherman, Uncle Bobby know
Every junkie sayin' that it used to be a hobby though
This is not for nada, not for nothin'
It's a lot of those
This is that euphoria
You're my glory, you're my pot of gold
Kisses from your daughter
Watch her hard and wipe her snotty nose
Everybody got it, what you got it? Well I gotta go
Bring you back or somethin', all you wanted as a youngin'
Just a piece of hope
More than uniformin' every mornin' with the creases
This is for my deacons
That's smokin' every Sunday
Get your rest and get your money
Preacher preacher started rappin' just to reach us

[Hook: Preston Harris]
I don't know where you came from
But I know I love you, I love you, love you
I don't know where you came from
But I know I love you, I love you

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Look I fell in love with the devil and she was rockin' Concords
YSL jeans and had a strut that you would die for
Heard that she got a man
He a Blood and we ain't trippin' 'cuh
Got some killers that just don't believe, but they believe in love
Look, we can be Ruby D, Ozzy Davis if you wanted to
The two of us, hangin' out the coupe with our deuces up
Why don't we?
I don't understand why we are standin' here
Why don't we?
Run so far away that they can't find us here?
I ain't afraid to die for my city, just to shine 'em through
Maybe go to Heaven, see your auntie, take a pic or two
And tell her what a woman you've become and how I'm proud of you
And how I seen you naked and I never seen a better view
Damn your niece got so big
Mama she just lookin' like you
Make a little progress, stumble backwards, it's the cycle
I ain't even trippin' if my heart break
That's the devil, she so bad she speed my heart rate
But I start to sin like

[Hook: Preston Harris]
I don't know where you came from
But I know I love you, I love you, love you
I don't know where you came from
But I know I love you, I love you
