[Hook: Goldlink]
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
That I would even miss that bitch
That I would even miss that bitch
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
That I would even miss that bitch
That I would even miss that bitch

[Verse 1: Goldlink]
Yeah, yeah
Drinking on some liquor tryna' cope with the changes
And all my exes ain't shit, so they shall remain nameless
And all them bitches that I lied to ran around wit' just to spite you
And my mama met a couple and she told me they ain't like you
What you do to me
I'm still tryna find peace and unity
I hope it's you they get to speak up at my eulogy
Cause who could vouch for me like you could vouch me, my baby?
I think I'm comin round to driving I might scoop you lady
So we can fuck like we would fuck way back at mama house
And we would eat late at IHOP or at the Waffle House, know what I'm talkin' bout
And I'ma hit ya phone cause shorty we should talk it out

[Hook: Goldlink]
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
Miss that bitch
That I would even miss that bitch
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
Miss that bitch
That I would even miss that bitch

[Verse 2: Marsha Ambrosius]
There's a better way to say that
A love like this you miss, I know
That you tried to explain it, I am not complacent
I provide you water, take care of your daughter
I ain't trippin' over nothing, neither either or that
The weather got stormy, bringing them bullets
With the suburban, hittin' that bourbon
Nobody will love you like I did just like I do
And I forgive you when you do it again
And again
And again
I got your back when they don't
I'll hit you back when you won't
Me I'll be, you'll feel it when I'm gone
Don't matter whoâ€™s been around, I'm right witcha
By your side, with ya
If we decide to cut the shit and let it ride
It will be alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Nobody will love you like I did just like I do
And I forgive you when you do it again
And again
Again
Yeah

[Hook: Goldlink & Anderson .Paak]
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
Miss that bitch
What's a love like this
That I would even miss that bitch
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch
Who knew, yeah
That I would even miss that bitch

[Outro: Marsha Ambrosius]
Don't you miss me baby?
Don't you miss me baby?
Don't you miss me baby?
Don't you miss me baby?
Don't you miss me baby?
Baby
