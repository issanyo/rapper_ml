[Verse 1]
All wrapped up in pretty paper
Looking for another taker
I try to be elusive and try to be kind
But still I'm stuck here on blue, red and white

[Pre-Chorus]
I know your secrets and I know your lies
(Romance and candy)
Still I'm sitting on the outside
(Romance and candy)
Oh don't you look oh so surprised
(Romance and candy)
But I couldn't stay away from a sweet delight
(But I couldn't stay away, but I couldn't stay away, no)

[Chorus]
You tell me secrets and you tell me lies
(Romance and candy)
Still I'm sitting on the outside
(Romance and candy)
Oh don't you look oh so surprised
(Romance and candy)
But I couldn't stay away from a sweet delight

[Verse 2]
Don't bite the bullet
It's not your style
Let me in for a whiel
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
I'll tell you everything I wanna hear

[Pre-Chorus]
I know your secrets and I know your lies
(Romance and candy)
Still I'm sitting on the outside
(Romance and candy)
Oh don't you look oh so surprised
(Romance and candy)
But I couldn't stay away from a sweet delight
(But I couldn't stay away, but I couldn't stay away, no)

[Chorus]
You tell me secrets and you tell me lies
(Romance and candy)
Still I'm sitting on the outside
(Romance and candy)
Oh don't you look oh so surprised
(Romance and candy)
But I couldn't stay away from a sweet delight

[Outro]
Tell me when I see you, do you see me too?
Tell me when I see you, do you see me too?
Tell me when I see you, do you see me too?
Tell me when I see you, do you see me too?
(Romance and candy)
Tell me when I see you, do you see me too?
(Romance and candy)
Tell me when I see you, do you see me too?
(Romance and candy)
Tell me when I see you, do you see me too?
(Romance and candy)
Romance and candy
Romance and candy
