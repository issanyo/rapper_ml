Pray everyday, say your grace nigga
Keep the haters, keep the demons 'way, fam
Pray everyday, say your grace nigga

[Verse 1]
Hold my black nina in the sky, shoot it high
Maybe hit an angel, watch it fall down, fam
Free the whole posse, free the guys
All my life, been addicted to the pussy that's my vice, yeah
Drinkin' drinkin' drinkin' all my problems
I don't need nobody, I just need my bottle that's for certain, now
Put the pussy on the pedestal
I don't got no industry friends, 'cause I'm rude
So I told myself

Keep the haters, keep the demons 'way, fam
Pray everyday, say your grace nigga

But the music business think that you gon' take out Chance nigga, uh-huh
Pass Kanye, and be the man, cool, uh-huh

From the north, plug be in the south
Went to Penthouse suite from sleeping up on momma couch on momma house
And momma gave him momma slave and now her son is getting paid
And papa was a rolling stone, now her son on Rolling Stone
And all I said was shit, look

[Outro]
Lord, I pray for wealth and power over all these motherfuckers
For the DMV to reign for many moons
Fuck these rappers. Fuck these labels
Fuck these bitches. Fuck these bitches, you hear me
They killed my nigga and I pray for revenge
Control me and use me the way you would allow me to
Amen
