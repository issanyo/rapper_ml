[Verse 1: Sinéad Harnett]
Tell me tell me, you've been quiet, what is on your mind?
Come and spit it out, I know you have the time
And I don't like it, that I want it

[Pre-Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
Cause we only connect when I'm in your bed
Is it too much to know what's in your head?
What you want from me, it's obvious to see

[Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
So do I compromise? So do I compromise?
So do I compromise? So do I compromise? So, so
When I get so deep in love, I compromise
So do I compromise? So do I compromise?

[Post-Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
Don't mi-mind, mi-mind
Don't mi-mind, mi-mind
Mi-mind, mi-mind
Don't mi-mind

[Verse 2: Sinéad Harnett]
Body language is the only language that we speak
When you look me in the eyes, it's hard to read
Your intention, in attention

[Pre-Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
Cause we only connect when I'm in your bed
Is it too much to know what's in your head?
What you want from me, it's obvious to see

[Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
So do I compromise? So do I compromise?
So do I compromise? So do I compromise? So, so
When I get so deep in love, I compromise
So do I compromise? So do I compromise?

[Post-Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
Don't mi-mise, mi-mise
Don't mi-mise, mi-mise
Mi-mise, mi-mise
Don't mi-mise

[Verse 3: GoldLink]
Everybody know to never walk backwards
So when I fuck a bitch, I never keep the bitch backwards
Moonwalk, never show my bitch I gotta back up
Pack up, putting all my sins up in a matte truck
Everything I do is so crazy, bad boy knowing how to treat a lady
Maybe I can take you to a hotel and we do it one time
(Then a couple more times)
Baby compromise, thank you for the compromise
Baby just compromise, let's fuck and fuck all night
Oh, I just get so deep in love, you wanna cry, you're
You're mine, let's fuck all night

[Post-Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
Don't mi-mise, mi-mise
Don't mi-mise, mi-mise
Mi-mise, mi-mise
Don't mi-mise
