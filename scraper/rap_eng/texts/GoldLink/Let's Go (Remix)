[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Yeah, that's right
Work them heels and you graduated college, got a job last year
Bad pretty black chick, bad with her friends, with her new man in the back of a black Benz
Got new dreams and you mean with the jeans
Watchu mean, watchu say, watchu mean what I say?
Doublin' up your worth, whatchu want from the boy?
Runnin' to get the ring and I told all my boys
So, pack up the aunties, pack up the nieces
Call all of your nephews, hit up my tika
Tell her that I can't come around no mo'
When the sun don't shine round the year no more
Northside hitter ain't in the north no more
And I ain't going back to being broke no more, ah
Real shit, I'mma keep with the boys
I'mma keep words soft
Fuck it homie, roll dat dope shit
Baby let me, then I grow shit
Glowed up, got me fitted like a glow stick
Uh, but that's okay 'cause I'ma dance through the pain
No addition like a stamp through the brain

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might... be a little late... hey
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus: Khalid]
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

[Verse 2: Khalid]
I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus: Khalid]
Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's go
