[Intro: George Maple]
Don't touch
Don't touch
Don't touch
Don't, don't, don't touch

[Verse 1: George Maple]
Sugar on my teeth
I didn't wanna leave
Without you sipping to my taste
I know this sweetness is wrong
I tell it from your tongue
That you're all alone but
Zip me up, untie me cause I need to move on
I know you think that I will stumble and fall
Think I will step right back and do this some more
You are the best thing and the worst thing I know
That's why I find it hard to control

[Hook: George Maple & Goldlink]
Read my lips, don't touch my heart
Cause I know you're wanted
Read my lips, don't touch my heart
Cause I know you're wanted
Don't you know, stop trying
You can play the villain and I could play the fool
Trying, just another game, game, making up the rules
Trying, every step you take, I'll make another move
Trying, you're just another, just another

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Ain't gon see you Monday, Tuesday, gotta hit me on the weekend
I missed your call, baby I been running, winning,  it's all really busy
Player told ya, momma know ya, lovin' they gon' feed me
I'm a chef, whipping bitter sugar, and I don't eat your chicken
Told me GoldLink, you so crazy, I know that you fuckin' need this
I'mma swerve, baby swerve, ice cold, leave you freezing
Round the world, people feeling handsome, take a minute
When you're moving past her city, make her feel so independent

[Hook: George Maple & Goldlink]
Read my lips, don't touch my heart
Cause I know you're wanted
Read my lips, don't touch my heart
Cause I know you're wanted
Don't you know, stop trying
You can play the villain and I could play the fool
Trying, just another game, game, making up the rules
Trying, every step you take, I'll make another move
Trying, you're just another, just another

[Bridge: George Maple]
Just another, just another
Just another, just another
Just another, just another
Just another, just another
I know you think maybe I'm leaving you
And you think that i would never know when to go home
I am the best thing and the worst thing you  know
That's why I am so hard to control

[Outro: George Maple]
Read my lips, don't touch my heart
Cause I know you're wanted
(Just another, just another)
Read my lips, don't touch my heart
Cause I know you're wanted
(Just another, just another)
Read my lips, don't touch my heart
Cause I know you're wanted
(Just another, just another)
Read my lips, don't touch my heart
Cause I know you're wanted
(Just another, just another)
