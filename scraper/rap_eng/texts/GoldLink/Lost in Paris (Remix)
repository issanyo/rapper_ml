[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)

[Verse 1: Tom Misch]
It was over in a day
All the things I used to say
You kept to say
All the places we would go
All the songs we got to know
You held it all

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Young young, all in love in a lost place
God damn, got me runnin' 'round in a rat's race
Say grace, but I fell in love with a small waist
Uh, never start, yeah right, yeah uh
Bang, uh, shot me in my heart and it hurt gage
She so fly like a dove, that's a dove face
Thunder what she get now, but this ain't her birthplaceâ€‹
Tom, don't tell her, but it's Paris for her birthday

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)

[Outro: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
