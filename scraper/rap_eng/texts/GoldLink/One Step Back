Your sexy ass with them heels
I wanna fuck you and see how it feels
We were so close way back in the day and that was back then when niggas ain't pray
And we ain't even wanna live the next day
And we were so young but girl you look good
I don't give a fuck let a nigga touch you and I swear to god I'd kill him and I put that on my hood
Gangbangin' street love shit
So public
Remember when I used to hit your phone lovin' you like
Like...
Now I changed
Now a young nigga yellin' suck my dick when the cops roll through
I.O.U
Shit that's right
Without each other we would kill ourselves like fuck this life I don't need nobody else 'caus you my wife and I'm your man

[Hook]

I wish you I miss you I missed it
Ya birthday
And that was, the worst day, that I could have chosen
And you say, that I ain't, the same, nigga, that you had, had fallen, in love with, before
And I had withdrawal and threw up and threw up and threw up, and then I, had fallen on floor
And I was, so fucked up, 'caus I was so drugged up, and that was the worse thing that I could have done

And mama just moved up
Now a nigga talkin' bout death and who the ruler
When I was younger I used to fuck with cougars
Didn't think a bitch my age would get me
Now I'm so empty
This shit is the ritual
We were meant to fall in love, get married and die physical
No name on residuals
She can have it all, right?
We don't get a prenup cus we never gonna leave right?
Get up on your knees boy
We just gotta pray
Mama told me that, so I never go astray
Papa was a rolling stone he gettin' what he pay for
Tell a bunch of stories but I really shouldn't say more
Fuck it I'mma say more
Tell 'em how I rushed out
And you also rushed out
Loved him, but you pushed out
Damn I got your soft spot
Tell your momma sorry that she caught us in our mugshots, but I had to fight so our love locked
