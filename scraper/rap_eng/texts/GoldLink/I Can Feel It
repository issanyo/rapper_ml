[Intro Chorus: Esther Rolle]
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving, moving-oving
Every now and then

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Lil' shorty, shorty, he from the hood right
All he wanna do is get some respect from the homies that came before him
And even go bust his Mac-11 or try to be Kyrie Irving
It's either die working
Little nappy fade with the braids and the socks tucked
Nike boots in the summer, that boy is real tough
He said, "Now, Linky, I like ya style, I'll answer ya"
Feel the pain and I'm ready

[Chorus: H.E.R., Esther Rolle, & GoldLink]
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving, moving-oving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
Every now and then

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Look at Link, the hood fable
The streets crazy, baby, crazy
Now we turned up
How we went from back pages to back stages
And black nominees, hood DVD's, and world domination
This shit like the Matrix
This shit feel like the end of a saga
This man Linky have problems
This man Linky be poppin'
This man Linky can rock a couple hundred
Turn it to a couple million people now they're crying out

[Chorus: H.E.R., Esther Rolle & GoldLink]
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving, moving-oving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
Every now and then

[Bridge: H.E.R.]
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving, moving
Every now and then

[Chorus: H.E.R., Esther Rolle & GoldLink]
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving, moving, moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
Every now and then
