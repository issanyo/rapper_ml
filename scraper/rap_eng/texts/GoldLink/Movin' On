[Intro: GoldLink]
Lastic...

[Chorus: Louie Lastic]
Movin' on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)
Gonna give you what you want
As long as you're around
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Yea, yea
Back to get wrecked
No respect, to hoes who fuck for next
I bust a left, move on to next
I never love a bitch, never cuff her, never wife her
It ain't nothing, if the bitch about a dollar, then that bitch ain't getting nothing
Still West side motherfucker, it ain't never left the building
Never left the children
Love my Panamanian, and my white girl too
And I got mad hoes, and I got my passport
I'm a little asshole, I don't give a fuck though
Bad bitch on my dick, never go slow
I tell her bring it back baby, can she go low?
The little bitches know what's up, they love a black boy
Young bad boy, moving like a convoy
Conversations getting later with the boy toy
She ask me "Do you love me?"
I say "Uhh, ask your old boy"
I got one night in town, tryna fuck and get butt
I get around

Round and round
Round we go
Round and round
Round we go

[Chorus: Louie Lastic]
We're movin' on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)
We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)

[GoldLink]
We're movin' on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)
We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Hey yo, what's up love, how you doing?
Your pretty body is so hypnotic
I wanna take you far away and get it poppin'
With you and every time I pop up in your city
It's just me and you, them titties and your time
Only you and I
But baby, please don't pay attention to my pimpin'
You the only one I'm diggin' no delight unless ya get to sinnin
And hurry up, I got a flight that's in the morning
Promise I won't take too long
And I'mma call you when I'm back around

Round and round
Round we go
Round and round
Round we go

[Chorus: Louie Lastic]
We're movin' on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)
We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)

[GoldLink]
We're movin' on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)
We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)

We're movin' on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang (A groove thang)
We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang
