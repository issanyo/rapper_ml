[Verse 1: Goldlink]
I still see ya, I still see ya
Doin' everything that we said we gon' do
Girl I still see ya, I still see ya
Puttin' all my pride and my girls to the side
'Cause I still see ya, I still see ya
Smokin' all my weed, bend the corners in the streets
I can still see ya, I still see ya
You wanna be me, I wanna eat ya
I wanna meet your ex, so I can beat him
And have a daughter, and be a teacher
And never follow, and be a leader
And baby girl, I still see ya
I got a light-skinned bitch who look like Beige Loaf
And she fight and fuck me in the same clothes
But when I put that daddy, baby daddy, papa stroke
She curl her toes and close her eyes
I finish up, she adios
I still call ya
Whichever way you want it, baby girl, it's on ya
I got the money, you got the problems
So I can solve it, but I still need ya
I still see ya
And that's okay, baby, all my niggas G'd up
Yeah most of 'em either C's or B's, yeah
That's right, hell yeah
Anyways we can get to movin' on the dance floor
No choice

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
I wanna be more than homies
I wanna feel your body on me
I wanna be your lover, your lady
Just wanna be your baby
Your one and only
I wanna be more than homies
I wanna feel your body on me
I wanna be your lover, your lady
Just wanna be your baby
Your one and only
