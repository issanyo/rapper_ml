[Verse 1]
Yeah. Yeah
I'm creeping, I'm crawling', them bitches all up on me
Rebecca hit my phone and told me baby I'm so lonely
I guess I'm proving Mimi right that I'm a fucking player
And I had a lot of plans that involve babies in a baby stroller
I never date a bitch who know about my past life
I only date a woman who be in my past life
My past wife, my only bitch who love me for my half-pipe
Hit it back twice, double back and hit it back, nice
Never hit a bitch raw cause i dont trust em'
Lust em'
And if they out of order I say fuck em'
Hit my nigga Stacy and that's Daisha's older brother
I wanna hit that bitch so bad I had to tell her mother
Her cousin
Or anybody that could put me on with her
And when I make this song then she can hear it and I bone to her
Rip her clothes off, toss her drawers up in the dryer
Wet ass pussy it's all pink
Her pussy lips that I be lickin' on and sipping and
Kissing on just to get her horny
Golden leg stretched out
Ride me like a pony
I'm a goon, and this a classic tune
And I'ma be up out this fucking hood like really soon
And you can call my phone and we can do it all night
And you can be my bitch and I'm rich, that's right
Drop drop, lick up on my dick with ice
You should call my phone and we could do it all night
So I creep, yeah, yeah
And I'm with SBG and this ho's in the cream
And my rata-tat tag goes splat, pop the weasel in the easel
With the painting on, it represents the ugly
I'm high, cooly
You're horny, so do me
Fuck it, cuz now I got her calling you
Say sue me, blew me
But it's okay 'cause I'ma fucking make it
And he gon' keep on cheating
And you're crying now he leaving
Zipporah left me, Shoo, she left me, Sedi left me, Rawa
Amber left me, Becka left me, Aurum left me, Mara
Never cry, I never lie and Moby acting bitchy
He still be talking about like "Damn D I love Rawa"
And Wawa is right next to my house so we don't bother
The condoms where we buy them at and what happened to Mamy?
And Herin, that girl was super bad she had me starin'
And everybody in this song gon' kill me when they hear this
Fearless, GoldLink, the bastard, the most hated
Mosaic, aye shout out to my nigga, we gonna make it
And squashed till my mother fucking breath leave
Sweat weaves and Shakichalin with palm trees
TCB should make a remix with a snare drum
Shook one, bust a cap, and put South Florida on the map
See I'm a Mac, with a Mac-10
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop
Back bin, no wind, no chill
I sin, for real
I push, for real
Free bans, no lie
I kill with ill
Rap mother fucker, west side mother fucker
La familia, I told you this
We fly mother fucker
Shout to Baltimore, they showed me love like I was raised in there
I'm never ever scared, so me and Booby shoot a tech in there
I'm a young guy and I love me all the brides
Young nigga turned twenty and my shoulders dark
So I creep
Yeah, Yeah
