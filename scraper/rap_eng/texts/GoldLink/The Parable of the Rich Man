[Chorus: GoldLink]
Girl, I don't want nobody, and you don't want nobody
I was just getting started, let this be your party
I don't want nobody, and you don't want nobody
I was just getting started, let this be your party

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
You called me on my phone last night
And you told me send the homies home that night
And you said nobody was invited
And you really didn't make it sound excited
Then you said your "Lucy, Lucy" with a kissy face
Then I said, "Well I don't know no fuckin' Lucy, babe"
Then you said, "Well, yeah, you know me from your latter days
Who ya think was runnin' with ya when your homies caved?
And when they ran up in your shit that made your homies lay?
Or when them Baltimore niggas shinin' at your face?
Or when them motherfucking niggas from the Southside?
Lit your block up, but ya wasn't even outside?
Or remember when a nigga tried to jump you?
And you called a handgun strap and the ran, fool?
Or remember when your broke black ass was hungry?
In the fridge and now ya only eat the finer things"
Now let me tell ya

[Chorus: April George]
I don't want nobody, you don't want nobody
Let's just get it started, let this be our party
I don't want nobody, you don't want nobody
Let's just get it started, let this be our party

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
I said, "Aight, baby, listen, what you want then?"
She said, "Nothin' I just want you leave your girlfriend"
I said, "Hell nah, shawty, what you talkin' 'bout?"
She said, "Nigga, you know what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout!"
Or should I bring up when you was fuckin' on so-and-so on tour?
When you were lying, tellin' her that, she the only one who gettin' dick
Sayin' that you love that other bitch and how you need a fix
And ain't nobody hittin' on that shit like you be doin' it
Wait, hol' up, hol' up
Aright look I ain't tryna tell take it there

[Outro]
In this world mother, no one can love me
In this world they do not know how to love me
In this world mother, no one can love me
In this world they do not know how to love me
Where is that pure loving love
Where is that truly loving me
Where is that pure loving love
Where is that truly loving me
Their white song longs to me
Their white song longs to me
In this world mother, no one can love me
In this world they do not know how to love me
In this world mother, no one can love me
In this world they do not know how to love me
Where is that pure loving love
Where is that truly loving me
Where is that pure loving love
Where is that truly loving me
Their white song longs to me
Their white song longs to me
