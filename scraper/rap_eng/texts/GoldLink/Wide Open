[Intro]
Aye
Aye, aye
Tryna tell your girl that you got me wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
I ain't scared to say that you got me wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
Aw man, I let my guard down and now I'm wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
And I don't know what happened but I'm wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1: Deante' Hitchcock]
Look at the world
All of the violence, the hate, and the killing I see
Then I look at my girl
Shawty just gave me the opposite feeling I needed to feel like something
When everyone painting you up as the villain
To have someone willing to break through that narrative
Kind of imperative on how you living, I'm feeling like
Love and cliche as the folk make it seem in the movies, im feeling like
If we ever split I would be clueless like Shaggy and Scooby, I'm feeling like
[?] im tryna be someone, im just out here tryna really feel some
I mean the title cool but this is real for me
I'm just saying i'm feelin like, fuck it, we out to drink
She tell me don't overthink
She thought she was bad, so I beat it like Billie Jean
Work it out like Iâ€™m Billy Blanks
We fuckin', she suckin'
I kiss her no Listerine that's that where we wanna be
Girl you been on my brain, got too much of your dopamine
Tryna make shit its not a dream
When I say "I got you" what does this mean to you?
Is this more than a whatever thing to you?
I can't sing for shit but you make a nigga want to sing to you, eh
I said you make a nigga want to sing to you, eh

[Chorus]
And that's how I know you got me wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
I ain't scared to say that you got me wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
Aw man, I let my guard down and now I'm wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
And I don't know what happened but I'm wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open

[Verse 2: Goldlink]
What is your current love?
Such a definitive soul and your head dipped in gold
And the heart of a Bambi
God made you proper, blue is is your background
And the whole world is your playground
Don't be afraid of it
Be protective, pray about it
And don't let no nigga, no bitch come and take it from you
This ain't physical love, huh
Deep in your eye, where did your mind
Friend's with that pussy, that's mine
And you love me since beginning of time
And you say that we are from the same planet
I don't like love, I don't plan it, I don't really like you either
But girl that pussy outstanding
I can't stand when you be lying
Say that you tryin, girl you ain't tryin
Sexing that stomach replying?
Cuz you are too scared of what really I might be
And I'm good but the worst girl is you green
Pickin on niggas is on the same team
I ain't really worried about it
Take two blends and we flirt about it
Hop into that Porshe and we skrt about it
I don't give a fuck, but I fight about it
Even wrote about it, almost cried about it
Wrote this little verse, then dreamed about it
If I didn't have a choice about it
Shit, then I'd probably even die about it
Maybe kill a nigga, he be dropping me for
Bend a hoe last year, yeah a gram for it
That's how I know you got me like-

[Outro]
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
I ain't scared to say that you got me wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
Aw man, I let my guard down and now I'm wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
And I don't know what happened but I'm wide open
Wide open, wide open
Wide open, wide open
