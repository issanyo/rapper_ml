[Verse 1]
Yeah, uh
Summertime, feelin' good, feelin' great
Real nigga with the leg on the dock, feelin' straight
All the drug dealin' niggas with their gashes out
Bad hood ass bitches with they asses out

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout goddamn
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

[Verse 2]
I was out Fairmont Heights with the hitters
Then a little bad jawn walk by
Louis purse to the side, goddamn
Shorty, where you from? Where your momma stay?
She's at 501, cappin' where her momma stay
Her ex man still get it wild, right all night, babe
Shit baby, I don't care 'bout that anyway

[Chorus]
Goddamn
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

[Verse 3]
I was out Wak Wahler with the project boys
Lookin' at this little fine ass joint with her french braid
Black shades, lil' attitude, ass wide like a lamp shade
Diamond necklace with the gold grill front, uh
Ratchet bitch, with the Louboutin pumps, uh
Georgetown, where I take her out to lunch

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

[Verse 4]
I was out Simple City with the bike niggas
Talkin' 'bout mad men then a girl walked by
Dark skinned woman with a curve on her sides
I need whole fitty, you my fries on the side
You can be my lil' dunk thing for the night
But ain't 'bout to get you, baby, we ain't 'bout to ride

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout where ya ex been?
Have I seen that girl?
Have I seen that girl?

[Verse 5]
I was out Landover, me and all, then all and them
Lil; model tryna know way way back when
She ain't never give me play, so I played her friend
Then she wanna try to holla then I played to win
Then the home girl brother tried to fight me
I had to have the nigga kiss the bottom of my Nikes
Talkin' 'bout he from Trinidad so he rep the 12
I don't give a fuck about ya, see yo ass in hell

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout goddamn
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

[Verse 6]
I was out Clay Terrace, feelin' better than all the guys
Bad white joined, fat ass hips and thighs
Talkin' 'bout kill moe, all you do is lie
I ain't lyin' when I tell you that you fine as wine
Lemme get a lil' sip, lemme get a lil' bit
Lemme grab on your ass, I mean grab you the gas

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout goddamn
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?

[Outro]
Yeah
Have you seen that girl?
Have you seen that girl?
