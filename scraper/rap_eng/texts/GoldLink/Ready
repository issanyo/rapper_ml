(Uh, yeah, uh)

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Lose it all and gain it back for ya
Used to fuck all fucking day
Yeah the bitches, oh, the bitches love me
I say I love you but you never listen
I was with a couple of your friends
And they told me that you think I'm pimpin'
Bad bitches on my dick now
My wish list, not my hit list
Chain gang

[Chaz French]
Yeah, they say karma come back around
We love and then we hate
Do it again until it's over
So tell me what it's all about
How come every time I love you more
You doing the most, now
Gotta find a way to hold on
Got to get you out your comfort zone
And make it better for the both of us
Every time we ain't got no clothes on

[PreChorus 1: GoldLink]
Mmm, yeah
Clothes on, clothes off
Hand up in your blouse
Go hard, go soft
Babe you know you love me
And I'll tell you what you like
On my life, I would lie
Just to get you for the night

[Chaz French]
So fuck me good, fuck me now, fuck me longer
And if it's real, I'll be here 'til you want more

[GoldLink]
And real niggas they trip
No gap, hit it from the back, bitch
No no nigga, no nigga on this shit
I don't like sharing on Sharon
Girl, I swear
Ain't no telling baby
That I'm ready baby
Getting money baby
Fuck the money baby

[Chorus]
Said baby, I'm ready when you are
Ready when you are
Ready when you are
Time don't wait for nobody
Said baby, I'm ready when you are
Ready when you are
Ready when you are
Time don't wait for nobody
I choose you every time

[Verse 2: Chaz French]
Said I'd give anything to be with you
All I got is memories and pictures
Find a way to work it out
I'm just exercising my patience
So tell me what it's all about
And maybe we can both be good
Help me help you sometimes
And maybe we can both be understood

[PreChorus 2]
Because I don't know
Why I love you so
You're not that good to me
You're my enemy
But you're the only one
That keeps me coming back
Just when all hope is gone
You're there to prove me wrong

[Chorus]
Said baby, I'm ready when you are
Ready when you are
Ready when you are
Time don't wait for nobody
Said baby, I'm ready when you are
Ready when you are
Ready when you are
Time don't wait for nobody
I choose you every time
