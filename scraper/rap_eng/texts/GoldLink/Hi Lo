[Intro]
Mmm mmm mmm

[Verse 1: Chloe]
When my eyes are swollen when I cry
Yeah I like it yeah
When I got this scar up on my thigh
Yeah I like it yeah
When I cannot tell each day apart
Yeah I like it yeah
Freckles on my face connect like stars
Yeah I like it

[Chorus]
My highs (I love, love 'em)
My lows (I love, love 'em)
My highs (I love)
My lows
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Halle]
When you tell me that I'm too naive
Yeah I like it yeah
When I fall in love just way too easy
Yeah I like it yeah
When you piss me off and I don't care

Dance in the house in my underwear
Yeah I like it

[Chorus]
My highs (I love, love 'em)
My lows (I love, love 'em)
My highs (I love)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Chloe, Halle]
Take the harbor when I'm coming home
Livin' in the sky while on the floor
Have you seen someone like me before? (Ahh)
You can try to point out all my flaws
That's okay cause I still love 'em all
Multiply my height, subtract the lies
Why you mad? (Yeah)
And time and again
They'll be sayin' amen
Cause I love what I give
Givin' all my sins
When I'm done for a day
I be lovin' that way
Cause I am who I am
And it's all ok
Yeah I like it yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah I like it yeah

[Chorus]
My highs (I love, love 'em)
My lows (I love, love 'em)
My highs (I love)
My lows (I love, I love I love, I love, I love I love)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4: Goldlink]
Check, check can I pivot
Like the coastguard, send a postcard
Like a soulmate, what your friends think?
Pitch the whole thing
Girl it's Goldlink
Lovin' you is my favorite thing to do
Captivated by the sight and thought of you
I ain't really get to eat a lot up off yo plate
I say my grace but now I need so- uh
Go outside and get the sunlight
Play 2k and get them thumbs tight
Bump, bump with the best boy
Clear that schedule I need all night
Oh my goodness I need more than you thought I do
You said that you're grown (la, la, la, la, la, la)
Girl grown ain't the word for you yeah, no
(la, la, la, la, la, la)

[Outro]
Low, low
Highs and lows, Highs and lows
Highs and lows, Highs and lows
Highs and lows, Highs and lows
Highs and lows, Highs and lows
Look at the shape of my wave try to ride you cannot stay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My highs and lows
