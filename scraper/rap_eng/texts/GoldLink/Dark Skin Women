Go and tell a nigga' no, wit' a ass like that?
Hey why you wanna go and do dat?
And all my niggas stay behind me while they holdin' the gat

Split in his pants
Legs do the wobble dee wobble dee, makin' him dance
Spin him in a rosie a daze, holdin his hands

Ain't no other bitch wanted me to get ya'

Rock gold and I can't afford to lose dat
