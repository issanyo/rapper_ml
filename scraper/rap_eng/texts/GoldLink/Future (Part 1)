All night long x4

Chorus [Bipolar Sunshine]:

My future looks brighter
In your eyes (your eyes)
So if I ever realize
I don't played with fire
In your mind
We go all night long
And sometimes through the day
My future looks brighter
In your eyes

Verse 1 [Goldlink]:

Famous women in my radar
Baby you're a star
But we shine brighter
When together
Back turned against the world
The strangers of god
Are in apart of me
I wanna wish
And I want you
In my fantasy
But still ain't me
That thinks
That this could be something forever
Rumbled in the studio
Forever any whether
My last girl was a singer
I want another singer
But you are like an angel
Heaven you're no stranger
To god but you're to me
No I think I've seen you before
Maybe in my dreams or in my head
I want to hold
Your long ass like a ho
But I won't be here long
So you can take this song
Play it on the road
Use it as a booster
Fuck them other bitches
Your the one
That's in my future
Gucci cardiac
I need some doses
When I'm patient
Maybe cause I'm young
But now these days
Iâ€™m very blatant
Yes girl
I've been waitin'
Just to tell you that

Hook [Bipolar Sunshine]:

All stars
You'll be there
In the end
And take me back again
You're the perfect end

All night long x4

Chorus x2 [Bipolar Sunshine]:

My future looks brighter
In your eyes (your eyes)
So if I ever realize
I don't played with fire
In your mind
We go all night long
And sometimes through the day
My future looks brighter
In your eyes

Outro 2x [Bipolar Sunshine]:

All stars
You'll be there
In the end
And take me back again
You're the perfect end
