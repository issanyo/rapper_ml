[Verse]
Wake up smoke, yeah
Fornicate, smoke, yeah
Bitch bad, right? yeah
Tell her, "Roll one." Smoke
Wake up, drink, nah
Grind it with the weed, smoke
Drink, smoke
Sinners are never right
Willie Lynch is dead
Having broke the curse
Black killing black
That's what makes it worse
Tell me, "Watch the Throne"
Nigga, fuck your throne
Voices of a million angels with my golden tone
Yeah, I sold some dimes
Never sell my soul
I swear I knock your fucking head off if you think I sold
Rap is for the bitches
Lupe said it right
If Chief Keef is hip-hop, I'd rather lose my life
I'm about that hair work
I'm about that Gunplay
I'm 19 with the fade, rapping for some pay
Little ghetto nigga, speaking hella truth
And I don't always speak this real when I'm behind the booth
Odds are stacked against me
Mama talking death
Wanna end it all
Daddy need some help
My brother got a baby and my mans expect a baby
And I just lost my main girl, she just drives me crazy
(Change)
It's necessary
Not the Obama way
But talking about we feed the homeless
That's the golden way
I ain't no Black Hippy
No bitches fucking with me
I ain't no 2Pac yelling, "Holla if you fucking hear me"
The numbers never lie
Look up in the eyes
Black people, Spanish people, we were born to die
Hollywood machines
Mass hallucination
If I could kill the TV stations, I would save the nation
Dropping out of school
Imma change the system
And fuck a priest so we can execute that exorcism
A light can split in seven ways if it hits a prism
A light can split in seven ways if it hits a prism
62% of black people stuck in prison
And every song I'm spitting real. You have to fucking listen
This shit is hell here
We live in hell here
But I'm all smile cause there's heaven here too
A child being born is always heaven in it's truth
Believing what you couldn't see is part of heaven too
And I swear your problems isn't from the God above
The man below is what you dream, America's stuck
