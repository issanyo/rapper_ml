Told her babe go get the Glock, kiss the gun
Hit and run
This that type of shit that get you killed if you bite ya tongue
Momma gone
Where my soul?
What is right we don't know wrong
Ghettos trends, follow hoes, cast your sins, name me Gold
Pop the trunk
Pop the pop the trunk
Get that gun up out
Blacker whip
Blacker tint the whip
Blackest bitch up in
Right up in the upper seat
Ebony, Ivory
White bitch with them fat titties
Rack city, rack city, bitch
Snake niggas never trust 'em
Even niggas close like brothas'
Kiss your bitch then kiss your motha'
Ain't dat shit just so damn grimy
Kanye said he wanna sign me
I said "nigga get a copy"
Like A Rocky, fuck them nigga, we them Papis, ain't I cocky?
Plus I'm rude
Tell em this is my hood
And my niggas is shooters my Maryland niggas got rugers
Might pop up on ya like Suge
Knight nigga with a fuckin' knife
Take your fucking kids and fuck your family and fuck your wife
And this can be our theme music
Drink gasoline to it
And rev her engine like I key her with my pin precision
I pen the paper to the pad
I wrote it down with emphasis
My empathy is just so intricate it sickens me
The Wimbledon I will achieve
Tennis racket panty playa pop the pill the pussy slayer
Baby smokin' hella papers
Paper makin' kill a savage smokin' cabbage to feel it happen
Spiritual oh spirit spiritual it make ya go to war
Oh, yeah, baby

Yeah, bitch
Yeah
