[Hook: Chet Faker]
I can save a hundred million dollars for love
Just tell me where to spend it on you, girl
I can save a hundred million dollars for love
Just tell me where to spend it on you, girl

[Bridge: GoldLink]
I wanted to be an astronaut when I was younger
So I can fly far away
I didn't think that you existed
But now I need you in every way
I got a hundred million dollars for you
I saved the money just to spend it on you
I go to church so I can pray about it
But I will still be the nigga for you

[Verse: GoldLink]
Forward thinking, now I got a whole lotta' women
Some bitches with some children and the hoes tryna' get 'em
Competition, ain't it funny when you're on to something vicious
And them niggas start to hate you and they telling you, "you changed"
Like I ain't supposed to grow up and grow a beard and go nuts
I had to go to Vancouver and find a woman, so what?
And I don't know disgustingly attractive make me proactive
Make me sign and fuck a porn star so I know I got practice

[Hook: Chet Faker]
I can save a hundred million dollars for love
Just tell me where to spend it on you, girl
I can save a hundred million dollars for love
Just tell me where to spend it on you, girl

[Instrumental break]

[Hook: Chet Faker]
I can save a hundred million dollars for love
Just tell me where to spend it on you, girl
I can save a hundred million dollars for love
Just tell me where to spend it on you, girl
