Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say

[Verse 1]
I have dreams about you
My heart it beats, it beats for you
Words just can't, they can't explain
The way you got me feeling types of ways

Go down south to Atlanta with yo' sister and
I'll fly you myself, if I have to girl
I never seen a beauty queen black model 5 foot 7
I want you right now

[Hook: Demo Taped]
Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say

[Verse 2]
Blacker the berry, blacker the watch
I wanna have you and beat up the box
Blacker the women, blacker the roots
Black on black making me shoot like Pac in Juice
African model, my baby girl yeah
Rockin the gold and bluest the soul yeah
Me and you baby we could've worked out
But you would rather move and do you and be a good girl

Fine as fuck, I don't lie
You say you don't know, you say you don't mind
Just wanna piece of you and your mind
I don't give a fuck just one call you're mine
Bang on you and you on your thighs
Don't don't run away from your heart
It was you you and me from the start
Just hold on and baby please

[Hook: Demo Taped]
Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say
Tell me what you really wanna say
