[Verse]
She put the CD in and said there is a God
And read the bible just to know that the I'm the Ahmadinejad
I killed Osama, burned a few Qurans for me to get this far
Devil dancing music, you can feel him in your car
The Allure that Hova rapped about
Jehovah beat a witness, We so Christian, we still fornicating
California, valley naked, make it just to fake it Imma take it
If it's mine, I spend it, then I shit it, then you lick it up
Why we sin so hard to feel so good?
Why we sinning? Just to get in good?
Why we selling just to get a buck
Thats why we stick you up
Up nigga, West side
Duck nigga, whop whop, we up, nigga
Pop drop. Don't get stuck, nigga
Rap niggas over pop niggas
Tight jeans for the sus niggas
Peter Parker told Glizzy I was up, nigga
That's what's up, nigga
Lately I've been feeling suicidal
If I decide to commit suicide would you love me more
Or would you do or die?
Suicide is like genocide
So I ride around with my tended mind getting high
Backwoods never that good
I hate when my girl smoke shit
I don't trust niggas so I don't smoke shit
Plus, niggas straight sleazy, that's street shit
No Gleesh shit, mo'eesh shit
Her father with the box cut, and her mama fatter than an armored truck
Put it all on us
Gang bang shit, kickin' Liu Kang shit
Bang bang shit
Poo poo all on ya don't say shit
And I'm just warming up, nigga
You get used to this shit
No beginners luck, bitch
I'm a mother fucking problem and I walk with a pimp's limp

[Outro]
Do the stink, do the freak, do the wop, now drop
