Verse 1
I’m scared of the silence how it flutters through my room
It just feels violent
I think you feel it too, too
Pulling on my fingers while you stutter through your words
Your thoughts they always linger and i think i’m on the verge
Of breaking down
Don’t know what that’s about
Your eyes they cut right through the edge
Of my boredom and order, obsessive disorders
And trying to fight but these feelings won’t hide anymore
I’m tired of the shit you said
It’s depression, transgressions, annoying expressions
It’s stupid babe why would you do this, you promised me more

CHORUS
I’m faded
It’s jaded
We used to be friends
It was so innocent
But I’m done
I’m faded and gone
I’m faded
It’s jaded
We used to be friends
But I hate to pretend
That I’m wrong
I’m faded and gone

VERSE 2 (Goldlink)
Right, a good girl with a real bad body
When we face to face we get all off topics
Say you want change but you never change for me
How we gon beat the game, never play for me
But you just need trust, you just need someone to love
You don’t need all of this stuff
But you just keep playing
I just want take you to Cayman
Show you one, tell you one, take all this love and stop playing
Push up on it, feel up on ya, i don’t care
Whisper something, tempt you crazy, pull your hair
No, no, no, babygirl yeah tell me something
When we get alone we get to cuttin
That’s sad that we’ve passed the touching
Jump, jump let’s have a party
Stop fronting, i’m your n*****
Big boy making drug figures
Big boy was a drug dealer
Get the bag then we missed the past
And you cannot change what you never had
And don’t let this shit fade away all up in the past (or grass) like

CHORUS
I’m faded
It’s jaded
We used to be friends
It was so innocent
But I’m done
I’m faded and gone
I’m faded
It’s jaded
We used to be friends
But I hate to pretend
That I’m wrong
I’m faded and gone

Verse 3
Didn’t want to stay past 2am
Didn’t want to know what happened then
I won’t always be sober
And I’ll come off as a loner
Didn’t want to stay past 3am
Didn’t want to go through that again
Could this be bipolar
If I’m getting colder
I’m faded
It’s jaded
I’m faded it’s jaded
We were friends for too long
Innocent now it’s gone
