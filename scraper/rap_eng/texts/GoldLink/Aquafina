See I just turned 21 and ain’t shit changed

[Verse 2:Chaz French]
I remember Mama falling victim to that dope game
Back when Daddy was popping pistols without a gun range
I was serving dimes for only 8 to get some lunch change
I even fronted a couple teachers for a grade change
I ain’t lie, no
Yeah, the game changed can’t remain the same and this shit don’t be promising
Try living with Mama man can I be honest shit need to get poppin’ quick
Yeah, we all outta options
That’s why we steady whippin’ it
So when it’s time to eat I make sure I break bread with the niggas I’m starving with
Tryna get what’s left of me, from that weed to the ecstasy
She was bound to the true twenty twenty to the last so I had to OD for my ex to see
A broken heart, is a broken promise and I’m tryna fix problems with broken bottles
Startin’ to feel better, who broke the condom?
See when life sucks I just let her deep throat and swallow, my God!
