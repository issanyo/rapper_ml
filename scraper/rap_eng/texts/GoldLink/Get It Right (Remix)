[Verse 1: MØ]
I am walking down that road
Where did all the flowers go?
They say we're supposed to grow
Learning from the highs and low
All eyes lying on me, oh
Begging me to play the role
'Cause I'm gonna get it right, I'm gonna get it right

[Chorus: MØ]
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
When the sky is filled with smoke and fire
I'm gonna get it right
All I want is something better in the purple light
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Switchin' lanes, four doors feelin' like Jeezy
Undercover sweater, Balmain, boots Yeezy
Summer feelin' winter, feelin' rappin' like I’m Weezy
Lord forgive me, ain’t no prayin' when it hit the fan, Jesus
Cancun chillin' by the pool, I can feel it
Almost hit my goal but I still hit loose women
Deuces up, ain’t nobody reaching you, baby
Ain’t nobody stoppin' you, baby, right

[Chorus: MØ]
You try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right
When the sky is filled with smoke and fire
I'm gonna get it right
All I want is something better in the purple light
They can try to hold me down, but I am
I'm gonna get it right

[Outro: MØ]
I'm gonna get it right
I'm gonna get it right
