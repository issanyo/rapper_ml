[Intro: Ciscero]
Uh-huh
Mmm
Wow
I bet

[Verse 1: Ciscero]
Came in the rain like I'm Holyfield
Niggas wanna host like holy field
No new niggas, bro, only real
They never go in like I'm only chill
Hulk Hog when I flow, took an [?] pill
I'm Michaelangelo, only trill
Tryna make a Trump bump soldiers real
Niggas sayin' I'm the fact  'cause you know I will
Young, right you wouldn't touch to kill
Rappers play me in that new Jeep (skrrt)
And gettin' so mad that they at the wheel
Baby, I'm fair high, doobies
Niggas makin' hits like I'm I, independent
I'm fly as a pilot's attendant
I be in the streets so much that my tie's offended
This line, I'm tryna win it, yeah
Haha, maybe I will, that's a clutch move
You like rollers who don't masturbate
You do everything but you
You don't like me? Fine, nigga
Your girl just into shy niggas
Wanna ride on me and my niggas
Bro, you gon' need a lot more to fry niggas, yeah

[Chorus: Ciscero & Sugg Savage]
Ooh na na na
Na na na na, na na na
They gon' talk that yeah yeah yeah
'Til my niggas gon' ride ride ride, uh, yeah
Ooh na na na
Na na na na, na na na
They gon' talk that yeah yeah yeah
'Til my niggas gon' ride ride ride, uh
Woah, na na na
Na na na na, na na na
They gon' talk that yeah yeah yeah
'Til my mans gon' ride right by
Oh, na na na
Na na na na, na na na
They gon' talk that yeah yeah yeah
'Til my mans gon' ride right by

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
My guns blow like bye, bye, bye
Rapapapapababumbum
Deep throat my dick past your tongue
Gimme pussy, gimme yum
Young lingy, get the cream
And she gon' fuck until she cum
Shoot and shoot and shoot
So in the next room, it sound like a drum
All I know is 30 wop
And chop and beat my feet and fire
Hatin' nigga tweetin' crazy
Had a young boy gone tonight
Shout my nigga Ciscero
Shout my nigga with the nose
Shout out for OSP
Shout out to my niggas gone
Pot nigga talkin' crazy
Bitch niggas never gon' phase me
In the field that I'm playin'
[?] covered in daisies
Oh na na na, oh na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Niggas talkin' loopy
While my gun's in synch like bye, bye, bye

[Chorus: Sugg Savage]
Woah, na na na
Na na na na, na na na
They gon' talk that yeah yeah yeah
'Til my mans gon' ride right by
Oh, na na na
Na na na na, na na na
They gon' talk that yeah yeah yeah
'Til my mans gon' ride right by

[Bridge: Sugg Savage]
Oh, na na na

Na na na na, na na na
Oh, na na na

Oh, na na na
Na na na na, na na
