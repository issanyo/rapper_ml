[Verse 1]
I don’t even like your type of pain
You don’t even ask me what’s my name
We just fit together like wet on rain
Hey, leather jacket, wait up
Hold the elevator

[Pre-Chorus]
Some nights I’m like
Am I, am I alive? Am I alive?
‘Cause you feel like a dream
And I can’t even take it
Too much, too much to lose
Too much to lose
I just got to tell ya, nobody does it better

[Chorus]
Oh tonight, we're gonna start a fire
Gonna burn it all night
Come inside the flame, feel the heat of desire
Nobody takes me higher, nobody takes me higher

[Post Chorus]
No, nobody
It’s you and me, you and me all night
No, nobody
It’s you and me under the sun light
No, nobody
It’s you and me, you and me all night
No, nobody, no, nobody

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Never, never, never, never
Never thought I’d find a love like this
She don’t even understand how she got a man off his bullshit
Never, never, never, never
Never had a love like this, right
I met her once, I met her twice
And then the third time, I was all in
Never, never, never, never
Never had a love like this, right
She don’t need no man but she know she need a little lovin’
Never, never, never, never
Never thought I’d find a love like this
And I don’t even like it
But tonight, I’m tryna start shit

[Chorus]
Oh tonight, we're gonna start a fire
Gonna burn it all night
Come inside the flame, feel the heat of desire
Nobody takes me higher, nobody takes me higher

[Post Chorus]
No, nobody
It’s you and me, you and me all night
No, nobody
It’s you and me under the sun light
No, nobody
It’s you and me, you and me all night
No, nobody, no, nobody

[Bridge]
Yeah, you feel like a dream
I just got to tell ya, nobody does it better

[Chorus]
Oh tonight, we're gonna start a fire
Gonna burn it all night
Come inside the flame, feel the heat of desire
Nobody takes me higher, nobody takes me higher

[Outro]
No, nobody (No, nobody)
No, nobody (No, nobody)
No, nobody (No, nobody)
No, nobody (Nobody)
No, nobody (Nobody)
It’s you and me, you and me all night
It’s you and me under the sun light
It’s you and me, you and me all night
