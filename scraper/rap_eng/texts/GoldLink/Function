[Chorus: April George & Cheakaity]
Niggas out here bussing, shoot for nothing, it's the function, ay
Niggas out here running come on something, it's the function, ay
Weed and Robitussin get you punished, it's the function, ay
Niggas 'bout the money, homie run it, it's the function, ay
Niggas talk and bossing you for nothing, it's the function, ay
Niggas out here running come on something, it's the function, ay
Weed and Robitussin get you punished, it's the function, ay
Niggas 'bout the money, homie run it, it's the function, ay

[Verse 1: Ciscero]
Run up with me, got shots for the low, low, thots for the bro, give me box for the low, no, wait
Fuck twelve, that's a cop with a GoPro, nah, finna go, no, ride for the hoes, no man
Cuh, I'm a motherfucking problem when I come through, want me on, uh, two, shawty say I run through
She be trying to cuss, move, hit it with the one-two, feeling like the GOAT, uh, I'm the one move nigga, uh
I ain’t came here for no problems, these niggas put yo’ ass together for a dollar, you see the function
The funk and you follow, you sitting out front with the love and the knowledge, drugs and the violence
Drugs and the plugs, and the judges, the knives, for what?
We can shine but we stunt
Man, this ain’t love, we survivin'
You duck or get five of the motherfucking shots on your plug
Bruh, we got acid trips and bag of fifth and mamma called but I ain’t home, she mad as shit
She got daddy issues, bag is fake, I thrash her teeth, a masterpiece, she bad as shit
Got zips for sale, the dick is well, the Vic is well
We all get high, we live in hell
We gon' put a three in the air when we ball
We gon' put a 'C' in the air when he go, bruh!

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
I bust a clip, I’m on some super fucked shit, there ain’t no love for snitches, ain’t no love for bitches
Ain’t no time for prophets, I just want my money, y’all here Sunday now he finna pop
Moonwalking to the sound of money, dark-skinned legend, I’m the king above
Call me Pac and I’m one of one, and I swear to god I ain’t getting shot
Ruling [?] pushing pills and poppin need new stuff the money never pocket watchin'
Chicks are running getting to the money ain’t nobody stopping me I'm number one
I can never [?] a bitch driving 150, can I tea top?
Coupe coupe got the deuce deuce with a lick lick like post-it
We don’t play for keeps, I hold the heat, I put one up your best the knuckle get the slug
I don’t give a fuck you know whats up with me, you wonder; he that [?]
We them young, we them boys, hang with us, you gotta know be ready just to bust
Put your t-shirt higher than a deer, put your lighter high up in the air
