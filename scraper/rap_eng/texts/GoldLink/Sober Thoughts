[Intro]
Yeah, [?]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we fuck today
We fight tomorrow then we fuck again
I fuck her homie, she find out
And then she fuck my man
Then I hit her and I tell her she a piece of shit
Then she call the cops and say
"You always make me sick"
Then we fuck again, we make it up
And then we're back to where we used to be
And usually, it take like two or three
Sometimes it last a week
Then we fight again, then I fuck her friend
This cycle never ends
That same little nigga yelling out that west side
Was that same motherfucker in that drive-by
West side till I motherfucking D-ie
East side get the love when I get high
Pop bottles and I forget you even exist
Rally at the cathedral, throw up the Panther fist
Baby girl doing better with a star now
When I'm so deep in her pussy
Make a star child

[Hook]
Sober kids with sober thoughts
And it's ok cause baby, I got what you want
Sober kids with sober thoughts
And it's ok cause baby, I got what you want

[Bridge]
Good music, I got that
Good head, I got that
Sweet chains, we got that
Want beef, I'm 'bout that
Good music, I got that
Good head, I got that
Sweet chains, we got that
Want beef, I'm 'bout that

[Verse 2]
Been thinking about getting this tat all on my face
Who gives a fuck, nobody get to see me anyway
My uncle hears this shit, and he probably be mortified
I'm only 20 years old, sounding like I'm 45
Sweet lullabies and lies is what can keep the drive
And when I finally get a car I didn't steal it, I'm riding thighs
In panty skirts and denim dresses, all the finest linen
And the highest fabric backseat, steady rattling, I'm an addict for you
Such a passion for you, never asked for much
Except a little loyalty, some head, and Actavis
Swear it's bad for us but I don't give a fuck
Addiction is the purest way of love that will enhance in us
Drink driving, drunk driving, Foamposites, autopilot
Coin wallet, we hiding
Heavenly Father, don't be mad at me
You may not come when I want You
But You're right on time

[Hook]
Sober kids with sober thoughts
And it's ok cause baby, I got what you want
Sober kids with sober thoughts
And it's ok cause baby, I got what you want

Good music, I got that
Good head, I got that
Sweet chains, we got that
Want beef, I'm 'bout that

[Outro]
Good music, I got that
Good head, I got that
Sweet chains, we got that
Want beef, I'm 'bout that
I got that
I got that
We got that
I'm 'bout that
I got that
I got that
