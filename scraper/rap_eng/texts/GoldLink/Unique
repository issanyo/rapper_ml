[Verse 1: GoldLink]
There's only one that's good for me and I know it
And you know I got that satisfaction that you need
And I know I'm never home and it's hard just to trust me baby...
Don't leave... I'm coming back, it's you and me
It's only us I see
You are what I need

[Chorus: GoldLink]
It's all the same thing
Never, had a, love, quite like you, baby
Like you, baby
It's all the same thing
Never, had a, love, quite like you, baby
Like you, baby
It's all the same thing
Never, had a, love, quite like you, baby
Like you, baby
It's all the same thing
Never, had a, love, quite like you, baby
Like you, baby

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Too cold
Shining, icy
(Aye, what you do?) I had to add mink to the wardrobe
(Why?) To let the frost bite me (Let's go)
Cigarettes ain't my thing
But hell I got a light for your stogie, we can talk along the balcony
And who am I? Shi- you don't know I'm AP
Old soul, future brighter than a fuckin' high beam
And how your skin so shiny?
Body like agave
Chainsmoking, mouth like you grew up on a sailor boat
But dammit I like it
I think I found wifey
But then again I could be higher than a kite string
I said I think I might wife her
You know, powder blue jumpsuit, baby blue Huaraches
Let's just dance, the moment
We've been waiting for the chance to get lit
Is that your ass I'm holdin'?
You know I don't know ya'
But I know that you're one in a million
And I know you don't know me from a stranger
It's hard just to trust me, baby
But believe, I got what you need
There's no one like you, baby

[Chorus: GoldLink]
It's all the same thing
Never, had a, love, quite like you, baby
Like you, baby
It's all the same thing
Never, had a, love, quite like you, baby
Like you, baby
It's all the same thing
Never, had a, love, quite like you, baby
Like you, baby
It's all the same thing
Never, had a, love, quite like you, baby
Like you, baby
