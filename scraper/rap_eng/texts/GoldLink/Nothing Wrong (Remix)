[Intro]
Harikiri on the beat

[Verse 1: MaSiWei]
Let me pick you up girl (yeah)
快坐上我的car girl (yeah)
我帅得就像Pablo
But this is nothing wrong girl (wrong)
我带你do the dash girl (skrr)
I always got the cash girl
Ma last year being broke
But this is nothing wrong girl (woosh!)

[Chorus: DZ]
每天醒來希望你自覺地把我下面含你嘴裡面
I don't see nothing wrong (nothing wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong
美國隊長發來郵件邀请我们去神盾局裡參觀
I don't see nothing wrong (nothing wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong

[Verse 2: DZ]
Hey girl, watch me (watch me)
我比別的rapper多了不止良心
我能保證你整天的心情perfect (perfect)
你的男人只能不停陪你bad trip
趕緊脫 woah (woah), woah 還有更多更多本領
等你按響門鈴 (woah) woah 讓你感受我的任性 (yeah)

[Verse 3: Melo]
你的吻停留在嘴边
See you next time 加州阳光闯入我的每天
Baby睁眼就看见你的smile陪伴我到睡眠
不再惧怕任何前方的危险
就算独自一人站在全世界的对面
I don’t see nothing wrong

[Chorus: DZ]
I don't see nothing wrong, bed breaking
I don't see nothing wrong 看心情
I don't see nothing wrong, no, no
I don't see nothing wrong, okay

[Verse 4: Psy.P]
转身发现躺在身边看到的是你的笑脸我才开心
随时可以为了你去卖命就算世界末日即将来临
越来越入戏才能解除你身上对我的防备还有疑惑
希望在你觉得寂寞的时候会想得起我

[Bridge: DZ & Goldlink]
I don't see nothing wrong tonight
I don't see nothing wrong (alright, I like this shit)
I don't see *(yeah)* nothing wrong tonight (yeah, yeah)
I don't see nothing wrong (right, right)

[Verse 5: Goldlink]
Right, right, uh, uh, uh
If everything goes right but good money
Too many girls could break a man's pocket
Answer the tune, eight-count to your body
Send that shot, too, bet she gotta share it
With their friend, they can't both hold liquor
This the night we cry, but no drama
I don't brag but I speak facts and it's paid for
Everything be paid for
Look up high, seen your halo
My fault, that's the weed smoke
You know what, change your lifestyle
Say they're fed up, but it better than any drug
Too cool for school, they can't teach you
When these dudes on your line, they can't not reach you
But I don't see nothing...

[Chorus: DZ]
I don't see nothing wrong, bed breaking
I don't see nothing wrong 看心情
I don't see nothing wrong, no no
I don't see nothing wrong, okay

[Outro: DZ]
I don't see nothing wrong tonight
I don't see nothing wrong
I don't see nothing wrong tonight
I don't see nothing wrong
