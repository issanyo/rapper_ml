[Verse 1]
I never really knew my pops
My pops would push the dope
And that's just how we living off the shit in what you kiddies smoke
Pack and sell it up, flip a couple bucks
Buy a toy just to shut me up, then he eat his lunch
And I love my momma but she never was around
So she wouldn't even know half of the half of the shit that tell you
All she knew was that I was bad in school
And shit just barely that I was toking a gun but they just weren't busting back
Fuck it, my brother was the man around the town
And I was just the boy who want to be and never found
And they think he want to live so
He found the shit he wanna die for
The block, the streets, the hood, my momma
My chopper was the only thing that kept me safe
And I ain't talking bout the chopper packed up in the safe
See, I was working pretty hard just to get up out
So the ghetto was my slammer, trying to break up out
Break up out, so I could be the best that I could be
So I could be the leader of 100 million nations, that's an occupation
That you couldn't handle, God gave me the gift
And reason put me through some seasons
Just for me to straight believe in
Myself and all of the troubles in which I dealt
Put the nine down and keep the peace and try to help
My brother and my sisters and my niggas and my lady-friends
And that straight depends
On the limits in which we living in
Brothers turn to haters and my sisters turn to bitches
And my niggas turn to killers and my mind just goes ballistic
I'm just so fucking terrific, no I'm not bitch, I'm just sick'nen
I'm a calm person when I want to sit and listen
Remember Uncle Sunny, June Bug, and Uncle JR?
Outside of the court and Watch Park up in Marshall
Told me I'm the next up out the hood, maybe Harvard
I didn't give a fuck, I just wanted to be where you are Unc
The only nigga that just got up out was me and AI
Georgetown days was the best around the city
My Nintendo was my outlet, we were broke we had no money
Like the white kids, still wearing Jordans like the white kids
Go-go music banging at the park we had our Father's Day
Shit, that was my favorite day, I wish I had another day
So I could be a kid again, bet I fix a Guilligen
Mama she don't fuck with that, so now you'll never know my work
He'll never know it hurts
But I'm alright cause I'm the greatest rapper
Ever from this city, and they're going to hear this record first
Tell him that his baby boy a legend and he should've stayed
Never should've cheated with that bitch, RIP he payed
Fuck her whole life, I hate that bitch he took her fuck her wife
And you have a child that will never fuck with you in life
Very welcome pops, you're the reason for my fucking anger
Gotta keep on praying cause no more wishing for your fucking's danger
