[Hook: Goldlink]
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love

[Verse 1: Goldlink]
Baby girl, don’t don't ask about me
I’m just bad girl, I’m bad for everybody
Babygirl, don't tell your friends
That nigga with a neck tat, respect that
Old bitch, she ain't like that, she left that
Dropped one tape, two tape
Brand new can't even get a hold off a nigga
Pose with a man that's like that
Smooth nigga does no-no rappin'
New girl, 5 stars​, she an actress
She's so used to the light, so plastic
By the lake, LA like Magic
Spit rappin', no plan, just glasses, a bad habit
Then I tell them, baby—

[Hook: Goldlink]
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love

[Verse 2: Ciscero]
Yeah girl you know I’m too legit
Hittin' on my mans that I be coolin' with, hooligan
Girl I told you I ain't one you foolin' with
Not communicatin' but I get that from my mama
It's a jungle of gorillas—why you fuck with anacondas?
I'm a Zulu Nation rapper, get the hammer like your honor
Keep it movin' for my partners, ain't no hoovin' in mi casa
Ain't no hoopin', she just dancing at the juices but not Fanta
Got the juice and then I lost it
I put two in my deposit last week
But I made that cat weak, black sheep, ay
Do not fall in love with that nigga wrap sheet, ay
You know I'm just out here really tryna pass me, ay
Young Ciscero keep that ass nasty, ay
I don't know bout that but I do love
This right here, this that group love
Hey, so what happened to love?
This that, "Time to shoot, get your new girl"

[Hook: Goldlink]
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love
Fall in love (Ooh, Ooh)
Fall in love—wish I never did it
I don't wanna love, love
