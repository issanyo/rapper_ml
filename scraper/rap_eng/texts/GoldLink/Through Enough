[Verse 1: VanJess]
Steady conversation
Clear you on a mission
All the game from Mars back to the Sun
Don't mean much for this one, this one

[Pre-Chorus: VanJess]
I need a little bit more space here, space yeah
Me want fi keep from disgrace yeah
Ooh my heart ain't making it through
Another break it's been loose
I've got to set the rules
Before you coming at me

[Chorus: VanJess]
Don't take me ransom babe
I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Need more than action babe
Yeah, I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Don't take me ransom babe
I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Need more than action babe
Yeah, I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Through enough, through enough, ah-

[Verse 2: VanJess]
Heavy ammunition
Loaded up in your gun
I have played and haven't always won
Every guard will stay up, stay up babe

[Pre-Chorus: VanJess]
I need a little bit more space here, space yeah
Me want fi keep from disgrace, disgrace yeah
Ooh my heart ain't making it through
Another break it's been loose
I've got to set the rules
Before you coming at me

[Chorus: VanJess]
Don't take me ransom babe
I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Need more than action babe
Yeah, I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Don't take me ransom babe
I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Need more than action babe
Yeah, I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah

[Verse 3: GoldLink]
Crazy nigga with the confidence
Confidant, Chandon, and proper tense
You can dance to my pain and we can talk a bit
Or we can go up to a mountain and I park the whip
Gorgeous titties
Niggas mad, my old chick mad, my new chick mad
Man, everybody mad at me
My mama be hot, local niggas be sick
So many niggas mad that I should call this shit MADtv
DC Summers playing livid on and on in my head
Run the city rampant never left my city for dead
See I'm a cool black pimp playa version of a rapper
But I'm smooth with the lyrics and I'm cool with the bitches
And I got a big ego like Beyonc√©
And I should pray a lil' harder like the church say
I got verses always gotta curse in
Killing rappers I should start by driving hearses
Baby, that's cool right?
Yeah

[Chorus: VanJess]
Don't take me ransom babe
I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Need more than action babe
Yeah, I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Don't take me ransom babe
I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
Need more than action babe
Yeah, I been through enough, through enough, ah yeah
