[Verse 1: GoldLink]
I had a bad bitch from Decatur, Georgia
She know me, know me from the streets
I used to sell it to her
Steady pimping in my handheld, Toronto
I'm always, always hitting Deja but she never call me
A bomb bitch, she from Boston
She smoke often
She suburban, but she told us she came from New Orleans
My favourite bitch she from Atlanta
And she model now
She date a nigga who ain't honest
But she talking 'bout

Boo--boo you know I love you

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Reincarnated as a pimp
Got a redhead now walkin' with a limp
She's always itchin' for my wallet then she hold my grip
Hangin' out the whip, I told her bring that ass and dip
Ass so fat she can sit a plate up on it
And that's my baby, If you ain't me you can't talk about it
I love a woman who be holding down a man
I tell her don't you leave me baby
And she tell me don't you sweat it

[Hook]
Boo you know I love you
