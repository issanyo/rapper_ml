[Chorus]
She from Bombay
Told her say I’m from Ghana
Girl would you be my Bombae
Coz i’ll ride for you like a gunna
Brap pay pay pay Bombay
Told her say I’m from Ghana
Girl would you be my Bombae
Coz i’ll ride for you like a gunna

[Hook]
She really wanna be my
Yay dancer be my African dancer, wo dancer be my bollywood dancer x2

[Verse 1: Zack Knight]
Wind like you feel it
Come make me believe it, girl
I’ll show you the secret
But if only you keep it
She move like a dancer
With a face like Priyanka
Move a bit closer
One look and it’s over
Mujhe pyaar kar bekhabar
Door door jaana
Tujhe dekh ke ho gaya
Billo main deewana
Lakk tera paatla na leh
Chad di jawani
Lagti hai mujhko jaise
Husna di rani

[Chorus]
She from Bombay
Told her say I’m from Ghana
Girl would you be my Bombae
Coz i’ll ride for you like a gunna
Brap pay pay pay Bombay
Told her say I’m from Ghana
Girl would you be my Bombae
Coz i’ll ride for you like a gunna

[Hook]
She really wanna be my
Yay dancer be my African dancer, wo dancer be my bollywood dancer x2

[Verse 3: Badshah]
Baby perfect teri grinding
Jaise perfect meri rhyming
Baby perfect teri body
Jaise perfect meri timing
Teri harkat ne mujhko banaya deewana
Ab bombay se Ghana chalega bas yehi gaana
Baby rukja aise mat kar
Karle reham thoda jaaye na koi mar
I love the way you move your lower body
I love the way you move your kamar
Baby jaan kare nuksaan
Ladko ki le leti hai jaan
Floor pe aake nache jab
Ladko ke muh se nikle hey bhagwaan

[Chorus]
She from Bombay
Told her say I’m from Ghana
Girl would you be my Bombae
Coz i’ll ride for you like a gunna
Brap pay pay pay Bombay
Told her say I’m from Ghana
Girl would you be my Bombae
Coz i’ll ride for you like a gunna
