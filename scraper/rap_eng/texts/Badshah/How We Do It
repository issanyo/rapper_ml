It's Now United
Ei
Red One
Yeah you already know
Bashah

I gotta reach for the life
That I’m living for
I gotta look to the sky
When It's gonna pour
And no fear for the fight
When you're about the score
And that’s a matter of fact
And that's a matter of fact

You see me you see me balling (ah, ah)
Body to body I hear 'em calling (ah)

Hai kosis meri
Jo bhi karu right karu
Negativity se har
Ek second fight karu
Iss andhere me khund ko
Main guide karu
Iss andhere mein kisi ki
Main light banu

Haan bak bak kare
Peeth ke peeche
Haan kyunki main hoon aage
Wo hai saare peeche
Pyar karne wale rahte
Sir aankthon pe
Mujihse jalne wale rahte
Jooto ke neeche

'Cause this is how we do it
There ain’t no other way
You see it how we moving
Love find us everyday

And there ain't no other way
So we can roll together, roll together (ah)
