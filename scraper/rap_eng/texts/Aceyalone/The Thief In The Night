[Verse 1]
As I awaken
Born from the slums and taken
Through the ritual, childhood, puberty, adulthood, maturity
And mastery of me
And my surroundings counting down the days till I'm exposed
"I hear it move swiftly" underneath the nose
Till one day you're face to face you're gonna cross the line
You're lost for time
Life lose diminished
Heart beat finished, replenish
Now you can be one with the light
But when it comes it'll come like a thief in the night

[Hook]
So hollow the ground and don't put up a fight
Cause when it comes it'll come like a thief in the night
Yeah, obey the laws and do everything right
But when it comes it'll come like a thief in the night
For real we take 'em away
They take 'em away
We take 'em away
They take 'em away
We take 'em away

[Verse 2]
I hear the sound of the rain trickling down my window pane
It stains the seal to let me know life is real
Sustain and build and and maintain a force field
I use it in a time of need when it's hazzardest
As it is said
Be defensive at all time for instance
As soon as I'm elevated out of existence
I am no more
I can soar
Right on the back of an eagle
Or look eye to eye with a beetle
But now I am engaged
In none other than the physical form in which I'm caged
Such lawlessness involved in this charade
Tainted face painted black
"Is that the end momma? Can't I come back?" (No, no)
No your train stops here
Right where the rain drops appear

Next stop in between the ears
Objection to make you cirular
Work you just enough so you can work yourself

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Overly anxious can't just wait
To see when death is gonna pull you to your fate
It's inevitable there's no escape
There's no mistake
Every time a life is given, it's another one you have to take
Then your electricity and and your energy's released
Born into another soul after your physical's deceased
May you forever rest in peace
Although your current is concurrent there is no deturrent
You will cease to be no more
The war has been won
The warrior is rested and your duty here is done
Just when you think you're having fun
It'll snatch you up and run
For a second you appreciate the sun
For a half a second you appreciate the stars
For a half a second you reflect on who you are
And what you where
And in a flash it's all a blur

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ladies and gentlemen today's subject is death
The way I look at it it's three basic elements right?
Die, dying, dead right? Die, dying, dead. Death becomes you says the crow to
The cheetah because you're an old cat. see you seem a little under the
Weather, while me, my wings are as strong as ever, he says
"Well that may be so" the cheetah says to the crow, but you know where to
Find me, because everybody gets their time card pulled. You'll just be a few
More steps behind me, and behind you may I remind you so is everything that's
True and living, that's life driven is given a final shock boy. frankly
Speaking, everything in here is on the clock boy. every atom, organism
Insect, animal, man is gonna die, dying, dead. "Death becomes you," says the
Armadillo to the crow, "oh you oh you are gonna die."
