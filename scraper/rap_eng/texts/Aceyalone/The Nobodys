[Verse One]
The first thing I wanna say is that I'm open
I listen to anyone in the world, any time, any place, any moment
My nature is the lone wolf, I travel in a pack of one
I'm Acey de uno, you know, from the Sun's son
When I landed, our planet, my standard on the drum
Left handed, right handed
I was abandoned like scum
That's when I learned my little time test
(Time test)
How much time would it take to get my mind to the best
(Time test)
I hope you brought your rhyme vest
(Time test)
You'll be put in the woods beneath the pine crest
(Time test)
Now I don't wanna do you no harm
I'm just a head and some legs and a couple of arms
And I'm a skeleton covered up with skin
But it's more complex than that see
I'm a man who rocks the whole jam
I live in a ten by ten room over there on the sun
Spending my summers on Earth, heating up the bass drum
Acoustic, boosted
Mechanical stereo, audio tomb
With the tables and the mic
React a fool

[Hook]
Never let nobody get you down
Never let nobody turn you out
Never let nobody open they mouth and tell you what you all about
Now I got a lot to learn in life just like every single one of us
But none of us got the right to say some of us are odd
Unless they name is God

[Verse Two]
Now I am a musician, but I used to be a magician
I went to magician school I paid my tuition
I found musicians make more than magicians
Now what a position
Our mission?
Only to find the real definition
Now listen
If I could take the world and put it inside my head
I would, no kidding
Just due to the fact that I'm good
Well I'm a little good, I'm average
Well I'm alright, at least I ain't shy or bashful
I rock a party all night
Yeah, I'm silly
Wanna bet?
Bet on, bet I led off
Bet off
Wanna let me just proceed to take your head off
Get off
You're off on your own and you're off
The set
Wanna bet?
We ain't really started jamming yet
Or frying in a pan just like a salmon croquette
You know I ain't really silly hill billy willy, I'm a vet
In this game
And I got your brain as a pet
You're wet and washed up and despicable
Upset, tossed up and pitiful, yet
I don't wanna hear ya say shit

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Now check it out
Somebody jot this down
Word got around that you'se a loser
Zero, zilch
Unadulterated filth flaren filth
Oh you're a nobody
You wanna be somebody
And you'll prolly sell your soul
Good golly almighty
Smile boy
That's the least that you can do
And who you are is a mystery
And you got the devil spooking you
Now who can you trust?
When everybody else is kicking up dust
Thus is another saga
A paperback book type novel
You're a good guy? Bravo
Well three strikes and you're outta there
You might as well be floating in a shuttle in the stratosphere
Check it
My body is my temple and my temple is my prize
My mind shine like the sun do and here's a little word to the wise...

[Hook]
