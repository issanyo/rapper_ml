Yo...
(Pray for rain) I'ma get it right one of these days
Uh, and that's some real shit!
C'mon...let's go..

Yo, they pray for rain when the town get dried up
They look into the sky, hands all high up
They say my name and they tounge get tied up
Aceyalone turn the game right side up

Upside-down, man I'm still around
Still relevant, 'pendin on who you tellin it
I represent, conscious MCs' that got intelligence
Sheeit, I'm glad I made it past the summertime of '91
Had to find myself a gun and pick what side I'm from
Thank rap the bank didn't bounced the check back
I got get back, suffered a few setbacks
So many homies I know used to be rollers
And got stretched like yoga over a lil' yola
Sheeit, I wish they NEVER had to sell dope
Man, I'm glad I NEVER had to sell dope
Man, I hope my kids NEVER have to sell dope
But the way the world is now, what the FUCK is hope
Or change? Is it Obama in the White House?
They still creepin through the hood with the lights out
The fiends still on the corner with they pipes out
And a buncha young niggas gettin wiped out

Pray for rain when the town get dried up
They look into the sky, hands all high up
They say the name and they tounge get tied up
Yeah, and turn the game right side up
Uh, and turn the game right side up
Pray for rain, turn the game right side up
..uh-huh, right side up

..Yeah, don't act like you don't know
'cause I know you do
Yeah, y'all know what I'm talkin 'bout

(Pray for rain...)

Look, uh, pray for rain, mayne
Wash away the bloodstains, so many niggas thug-bang
And don't love a thang, not even their own selves - much less you
So lemme give you a lil' sumthin to manifest to
I wish that everybody get to life their life right
And never have to have a gun or a knife fight
Let the whole world have fun in the nightlife
And be right back to work when the time's right
How many folks you know done really made it out the hood?
Compare that to the folks still in the hood
They say the slum's in the head, not in the hood
Shit, my family gon' live and die in the hood
'cause we know that the radio won't play us all
And if you say a lil' somethin, you gets no play at all
If you're playin ball, you better play to win
'Cause if you made the false move, you'll be in the pen
It's that crazy, police are that shady
Might as well fill the jails up with babies
Mama ain't never EVER comin home again
They gave you some more years and he could comprehend
Baby girl, I ain't NEVER comin home again
Yeah, they gave me more years and I can comprehend

Pray for rain when the city get dried up
Look into the sky, hands all high up
Uh, and then they tounge get tied up
Yeah, and turn the game right side up
Uh, and turn the game right side up
Pray for rain, turn the game right side up
Pray for rain, turn the game right side up
Right side up, right side up

That what I'm talkin 'bout...
Fact you ain't GOT to feel me.. (Got through 'em?)
You don't feel me, you ain't got to feel me (I think that's good then)
Fuck it, do what you do
We all got or lives, yeah..
God gave everybody a life
You gon' do wit it what the fuck you want to
Me too
And ain't nobody perfect
So what the fuck??
Uh, right side up
I'm just strivin for somethin th-that got to do with what I know about
And it might not even be the thang for you
It might not even matter, fuck it
Don't even matter, uh..
Yeah, but they pray for rain when the town get dried up
They look into the sky, hands all high up
They say my name and they tounge get tied up
Aceyalone turn the game right side up
Yeah...Dedicated to life, levity, alright...
