Ghetto youth, what a struggle was the proof
Ghetto youth youth youth

[Verse 1] Self Jupiter
While your was in your pro keds
Playing hide go get it, spin the bottle
Me and my niggas were pushing mo-peds
And yanking back the throttle
Before I  learned the art
I was selling go-karts and bike parts, yep
Young arnett, a.k.a aristotle
The biggest and most colourfulness marble
The wittiest and the host
Instigating all the squabbles
I grew with all the rockwilers, scholars and shot callers
Peep, 48-08 arkan? street
Honestly ain't nobody been represtenting as long as me
I sing a sad song
For all my real niggas rest in peace


All ghetto youth hold tight your time will come

[Verse 2] Aceyalone
I started out against the odds
Live and stereo
Type just a ghetto youth eating cereal
A good kid with potentual
College material
Gave it up to the be the mic
Grand imperial
Here we go another freestyle fellow adventure
How bout' another rendezvous for the inventors
The party's maybe hard to find
But well worth it
You know we got all the flavors to make it perfect
My people always try to tell me
We should comercialize, realize, socialize
So you can optimize
I try to tell em'
We run our own enterprize
We keep it wise not like though's other guys
All factory more than satisfactory
The underground is backing me
Suckers is hacking me
But i still keep it all in perspective
Acceptic eclectric
Respect my collective


All ghetto youth hold tight your time will come

[Verse 3] Myka 9
My daddy was a jazzy pimp about alabama
But he could of had a bit of trinidadian up in his grammer
And my momma had a gypsy type wisconsin slang
I was concieved after a swanson tv dinner
Couple amphetamines
3 reals of snow
Dark strong liqour
Winston lights
I grew up with the name mike
I would've taken flight under the kids that call me white
My foster parents
Were molly and dudley slaughter?
My old dad and old erb? had to get restraining orders
When I turned 9 I moved in with elaine
Nobody in my family has my last name
I used to fight with my teachers
Run from the church and the preachers
Smoking the reefer with skeezers
Under over my junior high school bleachers
Having amatuer sex with dorsey high cheerleaders
Killer cali b-boy and radio
Trying adidas
My productive enviroment
Oops, over achievers
I have knowledge of self
And I still believe in jesus


All ghetto youth hold tight your time will come
