Naw, I don't really wanna offense. So I hope you don't take it too personal

"I put you up on this here cause youse not knowin'" - Aceyalone 'Knownots'

[Verse One]
For every one of you
I'm warning you
For every two of you

For every four of you

[Aceyalone talking]
It's just...look. What I'm tryin' to say is this
And I'm sayin' this cause I'm an MC in the game
And I'm sayin' this to everybody, everybody out there (Aceone!)
I'm lettin' everybody out there know that I...Am a hip hop head
That's right, that's right. I'm a hip hop head
Hip hop heads come in all walks of life and you know
All different people, are hip hop heads but I'm a hip hop head
You know what I'm sayin'?
And...not only am I just a regular hip hop head (Aceone. Attack)
I'm a superhuman hip hop head
That's right I'm a super human hip hop head. (Aceone. Attack)

"I put you up on this here cause youse not knowin'" - Aceyalone 'Knownots'

[Verse Two]
I'm a superhuman hip hop head in fact
I see through them just like a cat scan to see just how they act
I define your drama as, wack
You need black, acting school as a tool to duel
Or perhaps a higher octane fuel
To run this raceway, Ace way, Indi 5
Not a go cart cause when the flow starts
I'm the one to drive!
I drive the wagon with the band in the back, now how bout that?
There's always an open seat
And an open ended extended
Welcoming if you wanna just peak if you're attracted to my heat
Of course you are
Beyond no storm my forces are the forces of all existing forces of electric energy
Of course my course is more coarse than others but I'm not the enemy
I'm Aceyalone the entity
With a sensory perception of perfection
Pure divinity
It sometimes renders me to an unconscious state of bliss
Searing
My conscious reality entering
Maximum wild
Which allows me to serve through your town and burn down your little cottage
Cause I am a superhuman hip hop head

[Hook]
Attack of the superhuman hip hop head
Be cautious of
The superhuman hip hop head
MC's fallin' dead
Rappers runnin' scared
Again
The superhuman hip hop head
I am
The superhuman hip hop head
Be aware of
The superhuman hip hop head
MC's fallin' dead
Rappers runnin' scared

[Verse Three]
"Attack" - KRS-One
MC's
From far and near
Listen up clear
From here to the outer limits
Bring your gimmicks and your flows and your courage
Bring your Wheaties and your porridge
And your protein and your soy bean
For the B-Boy king
Now that we're enjoying things it's time I get to servin'
For those who's most deservin' of this type of tongue lashin'
You rappers try to keep up with the latest fashion and flow
But I come crashin' through the do'
Through the front do'
And the back do'
And the window
And when the wind blow
My candle it still kindles
You can't handle my mental you'll get scrambled
I hold the mic so gentle
And sit down with it, get 50 feet from the line
But your 55 feet from the truth
But it didn't stop you from tryin'
I'm so high in the sky, defying all levels of gravitivity
And polarity
I'm here for the longevity and it's scarin' me
Cause I am a superhuman hip hop head

[Hook]
Attack of the superhuman hip hop head
That's me
The superhuman hip hop head
MC's fallin' dead
Rappers runnin' scared
Tis' I
The superhuman hip hop head
Better watch out for
The superhuman hip hop head
Better look out for
The superhuman hip hop head
MC's fallin' dead
Rappers runnin' scared
"Attack" -KRS-One
"I put you up on this here cause youse not knowin'" - Aceyalone 'Knownots'

[Verse Four]
For every one of you

For every two of you
Ouuuu, I be doin' you
For every three of you
It's me and you
For every four of you
It's gonna take more of you!
For every five of you

For every six of you

For every seven of you

For every ten of you

For every eleven of you
For every twelve of you
For every thirteen you

For every fourteen and fifteen and sixteen and seventeen, eighteen, nineteen and twenty of you
Plenty of you
Many will do
What they think that they can
But as soon as they step with the mic in they hand
I'ma slap they face like a big fat slapper
Give me the mic
I'm the master rapper

Huh ha! And ya don't, cause you can't, even if ya could
Even if you wanted to. No you couldn't. So no they wouldn't
And no they shouldn't. And no they shant
