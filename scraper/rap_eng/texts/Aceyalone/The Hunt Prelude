So as he stands so unaware of the fate the lies before him
Tunnel vision traps him in a maze
And in amazement, locked in a gaze
Caught in a phase, but it's just a stare
But he's just so unprepared 'cause the hunter seems to find you where
You just knew he wouldn't look

The moment is seized!
The enemies of those who were the creators of
Seek their just due
Now just due as it was written a hundred years after you
Submit to the will of your destiny
"But I control my fate!" he screams
As time goes trickling down his dreams
"If I won't let it happen, it ain't gon' happen,"
He leaves, as he walks away
But what a foolish man to believe that
He would deceive
And on the eve of his day of retribution
Deny his execution
Before the hunt, the hunter has every intention of capturing his prey
He sets out with this in mind
Sometimes he'll have a plan
Other times he'll rely on instinct
And to find his catch
Is his only focus, and his only goal
The hunted on the other hand
Has a different mind state, but in essence the same
He also may or may not have a plan
And be forced to rely on his own instinct as well
All in all, both willingly and unwillingly participate in
The Hunt
On Your Mark
Get Ready
