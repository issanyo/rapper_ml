Hold my breath
Hold my breath

Tracing white lies
I'm as sober as drunk gets
Full moon tonight
How many licks will it take
To get you to climax? (Hold up)
That came out the wrong way
Never mind, I meant that

Soon as I dive in
Tsunami's washing over my head
My mind is flowing, you're in the wind
You feel like waterfalls, just like waterfalls

So, girl, hold on, we're almost there
I'm gonna show you how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath
Have you telling all your friends
They're so impressed with how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath

My, oh, my, you got me
Caught up in swimming all through your waves
By now I think it's clear, there's no debate
That I had it mind, I had it in mind
And I still ain't came up for air

Soon as I dive in
Tsunami's washing over my head
My mind is flowing, you're in the wind
You feel like waterfalls, just like waterfalls

(So hold on)

So, girl, hold on, we're almost there (Right there)
I'm gonna show you how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath
Have you telling all your friends (Ooh)
They're so impressed with how long I can hold my breath (All my friends)
Baby, I can hold my breath

So, girl, hold on, we're almost there (Almost there)
I'm gonna show you how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath
Have you telling all your friends (Oh)
They're so impressed with how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath

Soon as I dive in
Tsunami's washing over my head
My mind is blowing, you're in the wind
You feel like waterfalls, just like waterfalls

So, girl, hold on, we're almost there
I'm gonna show you how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath
Have you telling all your friends
They're so impressed with how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath

So, girl, hold on, we're almost there
I'm gonna show you how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath
Have you telling all your friends
They're so impressed with how long I can hold my breath
Baby, I can hold my breath

Baby, I can
Six minutes long
Baby, I can
Seven minutes long
Baby, I can
Ten minutes strong
Baby, I can
I can do it all
Baby, I can
If you put me on
Baby, I can
It's sleepy time, baby

Ah, pick up
