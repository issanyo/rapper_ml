So much pain we live through the strain
So much to gain so I can't complain
We'll stake our claim our ? in the name
So take this game, let's make this change
So much pain we live through the strain
So much to gain so I can't complain
So much pain it just won't, go away

It's all foul man; I swear to God trick dice in the game
If my life is the prize or the stakes too high for the flame?
And nowaday's, this young killer's are nice when they aim
I'm watching rapper's who died in the flames, am I in the same?
Both flow ? am I gonna change or be repelled by the same catalyst?
Only if I had a wish, I guess the vital analysts
Won't be some ? and telling me I'm eulogized
So you decide but right now I gots to ride
Move aside no sob stories when we swab stories
Don't cry for me, just see through my eyes, we analyze, each other's philosophy
Over beat's, sometimes I'll show you the child in me
But I only can show you what's alotting me
Allowing me speak clearly without any doubt in me
Are you doubting me, doubting me?

[Self-Jupiter]
It's a new day, just crazy as yesterday is
As lazy as tommorow was I'm as anxious as to get on like people at the chronic bustop
What the hell took you so long!?
Lets get this operation moving in the right direction for a change
By the way, anybody got any spare of change?
Or think I could get to Australia on a train?
Or get out the hood alive?
I'm I good for a five story or count story courtyard drive?
Now you know I could show up at your house tonight
Or run up a tab ? credit
Life can get complicated, if you let it
Roll out the red carpet when I arrive
Brake out the good plates cups, sallads, bowls, spoons, forks and knives
Now when I take this shit I want one of those Chinese wives
Only thing I turned down is my collar, and I'm subject to pop it
Street scholar in a quarter pocket, Self-Jupiter from the Fellowship
I know you jock it

I rap everyday, I work everyday
And it's a full time job knowing what to say
Blowing the smoke away, and seeing what cha got
And realizing what you really are and what cha not
Pulling your line out the water and seeing what cha cot
Just, ? and boots and that can't be alot
You need different bait if you want to catch a bass
Gotta have your head straight just to get some cash
I make this records just to keep me saying
Cause the world is more crazy than a song can explain
To make it simple and plain, we not simple and plain
I'm just not the same, without my thang
Live and let live on your own Promise Land
And give rap back to the common man
The War wasn't over when they bombed Japan
Rise and stand, devise a plan cause it's..
