Well it's time for Underground flavor

Now for your rock and roll heads or you ravers
You don't know now but you going find out!
We be rocking this ? and kicks
Freestyle Fellowship in the mix
Afterlife Massmen in the mix
You don't know now but you going find out!
I don't think that I'm gonna sleep tonight
My name is Aceyalone keep it tight
Them other fools just can't freak the mic man
You don't know now but you going find out!
Who got, who got, who got, who got
Underground around the world smoking hot?
Who got the mic to serve you bumbaklots?
You don't know now but you going find out!

We get you up for the ressurection
That afterlife Project Blow connection
I'm rhyming to get rid of your imperfections

The who, what, where, when and why
Legendary style that we spit on the mic
Whether, memorize or the improvise
[Aceyalone:You don't know now but you going find out!]

You were looking for a battle but you fell into a WAR!

One for the money, two for the show
Three four five six and seven for the flow
Eight nine ten eleven, add a couple mo
I got one double O one ways I could go, so
Have a seat, relax your feet
Roll out the stair walkmen rock this beat
If you ain't got this then you incomplete
Go feel this heat on your neighborhood street
Try to make end's meet, greet and get aquainted
This is alot different from the picture that they painted
I try to explain it, the best way that I can
Today's all I got, yesterday is ?
I'm a grown ass man who gots to survive
Hold out your hand and all they do is slap you a five
We shuttin down the microphone as soon we arrive
Use my powers to the guns and knives

Party people! Your dreams have now been furfilled

[Riddlore]
Hang you around and the ground cause to bound to the sound
Of the tomb of the boom we consumed by the pound
Of the bass-drum bass some, take some take some
?We would be rhymin for time combining?
The mind of a villian we chilling and reclining
With the mic in my hand swinging to a beat
Bobbin my head with dropping what said
Hot like a potato, or in Aesop's Fable
Lable this the real typical receipt of ?
From a sucker loose slips, who sliped?
Or give up the mic a beat that is tight
Or rather ignite as I put you in gear to take flight
Like a terydocatle, a sparrow or an astronaut
A eagle or seagle or a rock from a slingshot
The error of bullet from a the barrel of a four-four
Image mixed with the whistles of ? like it was World War III
The mic and me are deadly combo rumble rumble crumble
So you could stumble down like the Wall's Of Jericho
When the solo's blown into the microphone

[Aceyalone-Hook]
Party people! Your dreams have now been furfilled
Get out your seats and let's get ill
