[Chorus]
Heaven ain't got no stairway, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with you, 'cause you a devil
Heaven ain't got no stairs, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with you, 'cause you a devil

[Intro]
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven

[Verse 1]
Give us this day our daily bread
They led me up to the Pearly Gates and said, "What's up?"
Then the Gates shut, now I'm stuck
Rotting in a stinking hole 300 months
Then the Devil turned to me and said "It's me you want
I can give you all the power over anyone
Put it this way: you want new life, I'll give you one
Have faith in me, I'm only being genuine"
I contemplated, could it be he ran a planet
Or was banished, the blood dripped from his bandish
Just outlandish, I still didn't overstand it
I took a long look in his eyes and he vanished

[Chorus]
Heaven ain't got no stairway, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with you, 'cause you a devil
Heaven ain't got no stairs, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with me, 'cause I'm a rebel
Heaven ain't got no stairway, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with you, 'cause you a devil
Heaven ain't got no stairs, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with me, 'cause I'm a rebel

[Verse 2]
Heavenly bodies lined up at the gate
Wind up in purgatory, story of your own fate
Not one person dressed in white
It's a curse or plight, best of life, worst of death, burst of light
As the lost angels descended down to the ground
From a mist of clouds, standing amongst the foul
Was [?], universal order now
The borders crowd, the souls are sorted out somehow
I hear the violins and said, "Let's try again"
I took the side again, I looked into his eye again
And he was frying in the pit that he was lying in
I held my head down, said I didn't wanna die again

[Chorus]
Heaven ain't got no stairway, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with you, 'cause you a devil
Heaven ain't got no stairs, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with me, 'cause I'm a rebel
Heaven ain't got no stairway, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with you, 'cause you a devil
Heaven ain't got no stairs, Heaven ain't got no ghetto
Heaven ain't got nothin' to do with me, 'cause I'm a rebel
