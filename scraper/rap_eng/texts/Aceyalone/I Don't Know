Whoo I don't know what you came to do All right
But we came to blow some weed this evening
Am I right about it Oh, you're right, you're right Go ahead
Way down in the ghetto deep
A young [?] got aborted his sleep
And went over to a drum machine
So that he could make a beat
He thought he caught tweak Oh my goodness
And that it sounded unique Hey, let's get cray
He clapped his hands, did a dance and stamped his feet
And after a couple of hours of progressing
Three other brothers came over and they proceeded the session We got the cypher going on
Listen you [?] [?]
Now they tab two and three and have a little bit of [?]
It works Come on [?]
With two or three a symbol
The snare, kick, high-hat and symbol
It would be miracle, if I'm there with a mic even unprepared Well prepared
Into kids sampling there is like improve
Never thought you hear a drum machine do that do that
Besides for the reason, why players shouldn't tell samples - you wack
Meta fact the impact has created a market for hip hop/rap
We'll get props and everyone needs
Gets jacked for beats
Trouble is some hollow [?]
That mixed him down with [?]
They [?] would try to live highly good
In the wildest hood of the southland
Three black man dwell
And the style goes with the track and you're trapped into a spell
