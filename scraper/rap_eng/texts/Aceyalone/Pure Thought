We're getting bigger
And bigger
And bigger
And bigger
And bigger
And bigger
Till we blow up, blow up
Till we blow up, blow up
Till we blow up, blow up
Till we blow up (x2)

We obviously deserve a standing ovation don't you think
We honestly solemly swear not
To abide by the rules
Give that living don't you think that
We know what were doing
Doing a time reserve applaud a cheer
For love of pure thought
Don't you think that we, we, we, we
We obviously deserve a standing ovation don't you think
We honestly solemly swear not
To abide by the rules
Give that living don't you think that
We know what were doing
Doing a time reserve applaud a cheer
For love of pure thought
Don't you think that we
Don't you think that we
Know what were doing
Were doing the time observed i got a year/cheer
For love of pure thought
Don't you think that we, we, we, we


[Aceyalone]
Have you ever
Been in a situation where you know it's now or never
You gotta make a move and prove a groove
It's ending never
Jumbling, jogging, boggling, scrambling, scrumbling
Pulling the levers
Zombie'ing menie
Dripping and fiendy
To severe
Scapel and skeaming meaning whatever see me clever
I'm so glad we had this time together

We obviously deserve a standing ovation don't you think

[Self Jupiter]
Hello, have you ever look on the other side
Hello, who did you see who did you talk too
Hello, what did they face look like
Hello, hello
Are you there are you even aware
Are you even prepared
Hello, are you afraid of something
Hello, do you have a problem of some sorts
Hello, who are you are you going to sleep
Never

We honestly solemly swear not
To abide by the rules
Give that living don't you think that

[Myka 9]
Many believe in them miracle
Many believe in the spirit world
Many believe to be legalist
Slay the widow will soon unfurl
I do not live in some religious micro-cosom crumbs
And asteroid [tel?]
Undocumented of velocities
Impact of poets?
Such as verocity twirls and melts
Curled in temples and citadels
I shower your heads in pearl
I devour that don't hurl?

Hello
We know what were doing
Doing the time reserve, applaud a cheer

[P.E.A.C.E]
No, we ease back
P-ack my 2
Pulling a mind jacks back
Cross the temple
Let them bullets brain em' well
Black packs crack
Please make this simple for me
Ease back, back
Or get smacked back, back
A hundred and 75 million 20 and 73
Body parts lay underground
Lay my sack back
Violence similiary to cemetary
Evil vulgar nature
Boo-hoo
You don't remember
You hypochondriac
Back track back, black
Whoa


For love of pure thought
Thought pure
Cheer applaud observe
Time during doing what we think you don't
Living giving
Rules abide to swear
Solemly honstly standing deserves a pure thought (x3)
