A beautiful mind, turned water into wine
But that’s not all
Broke the water, shined through
Shaped the earth, created the colder life
Radiated with energy, the great boat of life
The spark
Sparkling through the dark night
Then walked
And took forever without a thing in sight
Didn't hear a sound till the first trickle(?) fell
Depths of the ocean swelled, washed up a miracle
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mines

By the grace of fire, out sprouts the land
Fed the desire, footprints in the sand
Top of the mountain peak, man speaks to himself
Closer to the mother star
What he felt can’t be described
It’s alive
Rise with the tide
Communicate with all sides, nothing wants to die
Buildin’ this, build a bridge
Build a tower
Construct a dam, dig a hole
Build a flower
Ultraviolet rays magnified the essence
All praise to the presence, one pure thought
Taught in the lessons
This spread with the first migration of the heads
And the first ones to flock

A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine
Once so enlightened; once so divine
The planet’s hour line, all void of time
A beautiful mind

They opened up the brain and opened up the heart
What is man made of?
Love from the dark
The will to invent the wheel
Work the field, the shield, the intent to kill, the uphill
Battle of existence, matter of persistence
Matter of distance to search for the mystics
Finder of lost souls, teacher of apostles, the mind’s so colossal
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, a beautiful idea
One that was right here, blind to the naked eye, tied to a fear
Once it was nothing and now it is here
A beautiful mind

Not accidental, coincidental, experimental
A beautiful mental, a touch so gentle
A life so simple to spin on the axis to access the temple
A beautiful mine, a beautiful yours
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, put fruit on the vine
At the same time he made love a crime
Mellowed out the screams of all mankind
Walked along side of you when you was left behind
Purified the waters, carved the canyons
Fed the families when it was starved and famined
Drew the blueprints so everyone had a chance
Organized the people and made man advance
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

Something outtaa nothing
Oh, what a far cry
More than a hard tribe
Pointed out the star guide
Made love, made hate
Saved sake
Nothing left to create but fate
Constructed structures, engineered labyrinths
Detailed a portrait
Healed nations
Took blame when no one else was happening
Evolved the species, and had patience
Wrote the scroll in thousands of languages
Came with us to fight against a giant ??
Created chaos, prevented destruction
Made law and order and then corruption
Laid the foundation for all things to stand on
Then cleared the ground for the mother ship to land on

Sailed across the seas, followed the breeze
Cured disease
Made poison
Settled the fear, took them on the righteous path
Gave them the math, and still had the time to laugh

What a beautiful mind to have
