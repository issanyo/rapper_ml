"Yeah, one, two
One, two
Where you at?
Where you goin' to?
What you gon' do about it?
What you gon' be about it?
Project Blowed, Abstract, Fat Jack, Aceyalone
Ladies and gentlemen, good people
Yeah, good brothers good sisters on deck

Dig this, peep the twist
Hand over fist, handstand on the cliff
Layin' stiff, expand on the gift
Uplift the masses, and pass me the spliff

It's a love thang, it's a hate thang
It's a great thang, Cali, to the state of mang
It's a world thing, and I'm a soldier
Always a war goin' on, it's never over
I make music, for the people
Who try to live a good life and keep it peaceful
And be resourceful, and keep achievin'
Every season, we represent the reason
I'm from the fellowship, I'm from the projects
I tell all access is the object
It's to beautiful, it's so painful
I do the work, and don't forget where I came from

(Chorus)
The saga continues
On the road again
To different venues
We rescue
We step true

Because we got that soul
The lonely
The only
The MC's of the Project Blowed
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna be about it?
