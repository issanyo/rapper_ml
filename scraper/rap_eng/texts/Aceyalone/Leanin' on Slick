[Verse 1]
That man'll sell his soul to the devil (Well what you got?)
As long as the devil had
Something that was super bad (I'm superbad)
That woman swear she on another level
I know, I know, as long as that level had
Something that was super bad (I'm superbad)
Drinking, gambling, smoking, sinning
Has no end and has no beginning
Fornicating and motivating beautiful women
Laughing and grinning as long as you're winning

[Verse 2]
He said "I take it like I can get it
As long as I get it fast
And I'm working with the superbad (I'm superbad)
She said "I make money every minute"
Said "Baby, I get it fast
Cause I'm working with the superbad" (I'm superbad)
Yeah, move it, shake it, bring on home the bacon
It's not just me, but you're so mistaken
Look, I'm a made man all into making
The world is a maggot trick all for the taking

[Verse 3]
I don't turn nothing down but my collar
Holler at your folks, tell em I'm about dollars
A life of bullshit ain't too much to swallow
Leanin' on the slick, slick leanin' on the Prada
Role model? Nah, the whole bottle
Palette on idol, that stuff bravado (Oh yeah)

Leanin' on slick (leanin' on slick)
Leanin' on slick (leanin' on slick)
Leanin' on slick (leanin' on slick)

[Verse 4]
That man'll sell his soul to the devil (Well what you got?)
