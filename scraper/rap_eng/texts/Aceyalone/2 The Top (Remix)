Got moms in the kitchen and she cookin rice
Daddy out side shooting dice
Kids on the corner getting jacked by vice
Yea, life in the city just ain't that nice

We gone take it to the top, i can't wait
Is it true hell yeah
Work it out, now gimmie some

[Verse 1]
Now i don't what i been told
The road to salvation ain't paved with gold
Yo, i don't know what somebody said
Everybody gotta get their daily bread
Got soldiers in the battle field putting in work
Got rappers all around me to protect that turf
Yeah, if i die in the battle zone
Just box me up, and then send me home

Is it true hell yeah
Work it out, now gimmie some

[Verse 2]
They wanna bring back sexy before love and peace
Least bring back half and let the violence cease
Yeah, they brought back crack
And they recreated the beast
Where families get messed up
And only a couple really eat
Man, i ain't tripping i know they really got heat
And they ready to do some dumb stuff
Get em' off, of the street
Thats why i gotta couple of dogs
To russle up the sheep
To keep the party rocking like
Oh, what a treat

We gone take it to the top, i can't wait

Got moms in the kitchen and she cookin rice
Daddy out side shooting dice
Kids on the corner getting jacked by vice
Yea, life in the city just ain't that nice

[Verse 3]
We gone take it to the top
Where you know that it's lonely at
You know they don't know me there
But they can't hold me back
Pull the wool over my eyes
I'm on to that
It's hard to game a real O.G
Who was born to that
Sardines and pork and beans
I love suprine?
Sitting in a core supreme?
L.A scene or New York scene
I'm eating to live
Making sure these forks is clean

You gone take it to the top, i can't wait
