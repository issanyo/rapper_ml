[Hook]
I got real life in my dreams
I got the world in my hands
I got funk in my future
What a perfect romance
Yeah
I got money in my pocket
I got a bullet in my gun
I got B-Boy in my stance
What a perfect romance
Yeah

[Verse One]
See my first name is Will, my last name Power
My real name is Eddie, last name Bauer
They used to call me Gun, last name Tower
Now they call me Final, last name Hour
Huh, but on the low my last name is Flow
My first name is He Got, my middle name's Fo' Sho'
My other name is Maxwell, last name Smart
They call me Gotta Lotta, last name Heart
I get sparked in the place to be
With that look on my face like "You don't know me."
You don't owe me homie I get what I deserve
Cause I curb serve these words like something they never heard
Oooh
Undergrounder, co-founder
175 pounder to clown ya
I hit the scene like "Y'all fools weak"
I hit the mic like, "Who's beat?"
It's too easy
The almighty mic hog dawg, Ace-zze
Don't stop me now y'all, hip hop needs me
Can you read me?
(It's true man I'm telling you)

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
See my last name is Aim, my first name Double
My teacher's called me Maker, first name Trouble
My new name is Never, last name Crumble
My uncle's called me Keep It, last name Humble
But on the real, my last name is Skill
My first name is He Got, my middle name's The Ill
My brother's call me Hold It, last name Down
But you can call me Champion, last name Sound
One in a million or two in a third?
It's just me and the world and it's you and your worm
So fuck what you heard if your vision was blurred
Cause I curb serve these herbs like something they never heard
Oooh
Independent, superintendent
175 minutes just to reinvent it
I hit the scene like "Y'all fools wack."
Hit the mic like "Who's track?"
It's too easy
The almighty mic hog dawg, Ace-zee
Don't stop me now y'all, hip hop needs me
Can you read me?
(Aww for reals)

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
See my first name is Yes, my last name Y'aller
Street name is At Me, first name Holler
They used to call me Hard, last name To Follow
Could call me Mighty, last name The Dollar
But on me, my middle name is G
My first name is He's A, last name O.D
My peeps call me Bring It, last name Home
But you can call me Acey, last name Alone
I hold my own on the M.I.C
With that look in my eyes like I wanna be free
It ain't nothing to it, I'm a little disturbed
Cause I curb serve these words and puff on earth's herb
Ooooh
Hip hopper
Young B bopper
175 choppers to rock ya
I hit the scene like, "Y'all fools nasty."
Hit the mic like, "Don't ask me."
It's too easy
The almighty mic hog dawg, Ace-zee
Don't stop me now y'all, hip hop needs me
Can you read me?
(Oooh yeah)
