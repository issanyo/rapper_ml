[Intro]
And ya don't stop

[Chorus] x2
If you give me all you got, try again

No more than 30000 words and minutes

[Verse 1: P.E.A.C.E.]
Why don't you grab a chair, listen up
I'mma about to fill your fucking cup to the rim
Duck, or you'll get struck with the blunt object
Huh, feels like you got hit by a mack truck, huh, punk
Don't you wish that you could funk the freak so much
And freak the fuck, huh
I'll let the pump pop
If you wanna pop chump
You pop so you end up in my trunk
Wicky, wicky, wicky
Wack MC
They'll be no tricky, tricky tricking me
Shut up sit back and enjoy the beat down sucka
Slap you with my buckle
Your dead homie was a jacker
Knocked him like a boxer
Popping your motherfucking corn
Like Redenbacher
Came to L.A fronting like he was a New Yorker
Should've gave it all you got while you was doing the do
Because now the Fellowship is straight moppin' your crew

[Chorus] x2
If you give me all you got, try again

Out of sight, dynamite and I might flow

[Verse 2: Self Jupiter]
Beans don't burn in the kitchen
Now who didn't get no undivided attention on the grill
Look over the hill seems like my brother got a lynching
Now who would've thought he be the one choking from a lim
It's because of them
Dreams of my beautiful brothers, sister reaching, teaching
Each black seed black be
The devil beneath my foot
Stomp stomp stomp march
Well we're moving on up
To neighboor-tour? we go
Hut 1 2 3 4
Who da' they, huh?
What's the conversation, hut
[?6 vinyl cuts?]
Look over the hill again
Well, who do ya see? Who do ya see?
The Ku Klux Klan
Kill like feeling you's
Go to statues[?]
My hood is the woods of the jungle
When walking through carry a stick or a gun
Cause it's fun to fuck with people in the night
Murders murmers fright
Sirens shots scream echo hold my gat tight

[Chorus] x2
If you give me all you got, try again

Every rapper in the house shut the funk up

[Verse 3: Aceyalone]
As a kid I hardly ever played basketball
I never ever sat up in the casting call
I was making the kind of music
That will outlast you all
So I ask you all why should I pass the ball
Now you wanna know about the world
I finally see what I saw
Well I hang around downtown
At the pool hall
I ain't a nigga named Peter see
Or a nigga named Paul
But am Aceyalon-e, stoney, homie, yes ya'll
Cause I can break it in, break it out, break it up
Break it down to a break, we break
I'll break your jaw and you'll fall if I find you faking
Or gimme a call we can chew the fat
With a buddha sack you done kept
Heat clip, so what up
I'm Aceyalone, I'm Acey-aloha
I'm Aceyalone and never been to Coney Island styling for ya
I hope nobody don't flip
Over that Fellowship shop shape shit that'll rip
Fool get a grip
I'mma trip and summon up all my homies to the pit
For the whip
Cause I'm a hip-hop-apotamus must bust the dope hit
So stay off the dick

[Chorus] x2
If you give me all you got, try again

Be advised they'll come
Running butt-naked hysterical in the flames

[Verse 4: Myka 9]
I am a man and that's all that I am
And overstand and its all love
And it's my game plan
And spread it throughout the land
The devil while I curse him will be damned
I am black man, I'mma survive
I am black man, I'mma survive
Yesterday I had a fight in a nightclub
But I had my gat and I bust alive
Ran a man hand them up in the air
And prepare to run for cover, but then I must survive
I hop on the back of the wack stuff 105
I thought about wacky jackie ba? that died
But I replied rely
That he is a black man he must survive
I went to the Good Life hip hop got live?
On deck for the Freestyle Fellowship tribe
So pack a tape, he peeled off a five
I got stucky wet em' up what connived?
He ran of with the tapey and the money in the jar
But what was wack was what he contrived
He try to bite the wheety, but he didn't eat his weaties
Just like the white man getting too greedy
But he be a needy brother, but he must survive
All in my beeswax, can't find the hive
Aceyalone, yes you will survive
Self Jupiter, you must strive
Mtulazaji against the high five
And uhh, DJ Kiilu keeps the party live
My name is Mike I rock it right and I will survive
I am black man, I'mma survive
My manager Kedar survive
And my producer Bambawar will survive
And my engineer Rich man will survive
Jump off the tip before you get shot
Freestyle Fellowship, bully of the block
