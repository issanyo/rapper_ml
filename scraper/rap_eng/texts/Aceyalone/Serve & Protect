Ah
Yeah
Nobody move, nobody gets hurt

[ VERSE 1 ]
When it first hits you
And you figure out the truth it's quite shockin
To see the mic rockin, beat knockin
They throwin punches but I'm blockin
I hit the open gash and I clock em
Rock em, sock em, my only intention
Is the off-the-ground suspension
With the decision for mid-air collision
Crash! That's my intention
All that means is smash a rapper, bash a rapper, rapper slash
Remember what happened last time a rapper flashed?
To throw flames he forgot that hell was hot
No brains, you just parked your car in Salem's lot
And Sky-Cam knows who I am
The shots will be aimed at you, helpless lamb

[ Hook ]
I hold it down (serve and protect)
Blow up the spot (serve and protect)
Take you out (serve and protect)
The mic is mine (serve and protect)
The time is now (serve and protect)
I speak the word (serve and protect)
Close your mouth (serve and protect)
And that's my job (serve and protect)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Statistics say linguistics pay
My mystic display made em insist that I stay
Huh, I'm on the level where I meditate and levatate
And dedicate every awaken day so I can celebrate
My last drink of water, my last piece of bread
I'm the last bullet in the chamber aimed at your head
Stranger, cause you thought I was better off dead
Not shot out of anger but duty instead
Look, me and you rappers got one common thread
We both speak the language so you know what I said
The spot only grounds where I bled
The tracks are my tears from the love that I spread
Grieve no more when you breathe no more
Do you believe in happiness or believe in war?
Speak no more, talk no more
I open up my pour-through and I walk through the door

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Better calm your nerves before you get served
For sure I give you what you deserve
And then some, I win some, I win some
I win some, I win some, I hold em for ransom
Has nothin to do with bein handsome
When I enhance em
I dance em around like a marionette
I bet, then string em along like a pet
Poodle, walk the dog but get stopped in your tracks
Shake the ground and you drop to your back
The uncontrollable urge for me and the beats emerge
Sends a surge of shockwaves through my words
And you are my target
I got a infinite amount of ammunition just to spark it
In the end all you heard was a scream
Diggin as dug in the concrete, a disappearing dream
And don't tell me how it seems

To hold it down (to serve and protect)
To blow up the spot (to serve and protect)
To take you out (to serve and protect)
The mic is mine (to serve and protect)
The time is now (to serve and protect)
I speak the word (to serve and protect)
Close your mouth (to serve and protect)
That's my job (to serve and protect)
With respect
