[Chorus]
Yes you're dealing with champions
We come through and we do what can't be done
Persevere where it's fear and can't be won
Reachin' for number one, knownin' what's done is done
With the odds up against 'em, it's champions
We come through and we do what can't be done
Persevere where it's fear and can't be won
Reachin' for number one, knownin' what's done is done
With the odds up against 'em, it's champions

[Verse 1]
Yeah my first name's champion, my last name's spirit
My middle name is winner, that's why I'm still in it
When the pressure's on, the clock tick a thousand miles a minute
It feels like eternity but I know how to end it
In the clutch, never cold, whatever I touch turns to gold
'Cause I got so much soul
And that ain't the half of it, everybody after it
I set it up and pass the rock like a magic

[Verse 2]
Trick, abracadabra, we're starters and we don't plan to sit
We want parades that come after the championship
CA all day, we Globetrotters
Players look faint, need air and cold water
Other squads are known for weak D and bad shots
Only animal on the whole team's the mascot
Basketball throwdown, it's classic live
Wild style, cold crush, fantastic five

[Chorus]
Yes you're dealing with champions
We come through and we do what can't be done
Persevere where it's fear and can't be won
Reachin' for number one, knownin' what's done is done
With the odds up against 'em, it's champions
We come through and we do what can't be done
Persevere where it's fear and can't be won
Reachin' for number one, knownin' what's done is done
With the odds up against 'em, it's champions

[Verse 3]
There can only be one king
And everybody thinks that their little crew runs things
But at this level we do it for one thing
And willing to trade it all for just one ring, yeah
Like the motto, I love this game
I love the trifecta, I love this lane
I don't feel no games but in the pain I bang
Kick it out to H, when he drains the three it rains

[Verse 4]
Yeah every second counted, your heart pounded
You found it in yourself and was astounded
Go around and stay grounded, I go through it
And if that's what we gotta do then we gon' do it
It's will and determination, earn skill, learn patience
Turn 'em into highlights, burn 'em when I face 'em
I take flight like leap like space station
H&M, drain your face

[Chorus]
Yes you're dealing with champions
We come through and we do what can't be done
Persevere where it's fear and can't be won
Reachin' for number one, knownin' what's done is done
With the odds up against 'em, it's champions
We come through and we do what can't be done
Persevere where it's fear and can't be won
Reachin' for number one, knownin' what's done is done
With the odds up against 'em, it's champions

[Verse 5]
Hot to death, a whole life left, I
The sherriff, while they hold they breath
Everything is slow motion
But it's so much commotion in the post when I'm open
That drive, that passion
That crashin' to the boards, start to trashin' and laughin'
I'm old-fashioned, nothin' you could imagine
It's give and go, give and take, but I'ma take the last one

[Verse 6]
Coast to coast in high top Chucks, the black ones
Trap 'em, tenacious D, fins tacky
Braggin' rights to spit it, haters either learn or get burned
Keep it in the 'frigerator, rest in peace to Chuck Urn
Since he been gone, it ain't the same, face it
Where I come from, we're born with game faces
We got flavor but we got the game basics

[Chorus]
Yes you're dealing with champions
We come through and we do what can't be done
Persevere where it's fear and can't be won
Reachin' for number one, knownin' what's done is done
With the odds up against 'em, it's champions
We come through and we do what can't be done
Persevere where it's fear and can't be won
Reachin' for number one, knownin' what's done is done
With the odds up against 'em, it's champions
