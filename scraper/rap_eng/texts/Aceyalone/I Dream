"Every time I get up to the front of the line, they push me back to the rear."

Pushed
Back to the rear
Open up your ears
And hear what I say
19-9 whatever

[Chorus]:
"I had a dream last night"
"I had a dream last night"
"I had a dream last night"
"I had a dream last night"

[Verse One]:
I'll never forget it
At the bus stop headed
For the bud stop, let it be a buckshot that came my way
So I dived imbedded between a shadow and a tree
Ain't no nigga gonna kills me
If I could just bust a move and get myself in a bus then I can leave
Cause I don't wanna get my cap peeled
Cause I don't wanna wear a weave
Then the shot stopped
And I seen a cop at the coffee shop, I drop
Tuck, rolled, hop to where he was at and I said, "Yo Oc
The bad bwoy licka likkle shot."
He put the donut to his face and giggled
His partner sort of sniggled
It seems to me they were both a little tickled
And I hated
I didn't have my nickle
Plated, toy steel
With six hot meatballs tearing out your shell
So I bail
And then I heard the screech of an El
Camino being tailed by a doobie
Truly
This ain't the place to be so I jetted
Headed, to another place where I would not regret it
Then I walked in a hardware store
Lookin' hard to find the 2 by 4 to rock his helmet
So I asked the cashier
"Looka here
You gotta drill bit to kill it? I feel it's near now disappear
Split, get back to the room in the rear and sit
And I'mma count the amount I'm about to hit."
Yo, I was greedy for the papes
By the way I need some tape
Cause if he escape I'mma bust his grape
I said, "Old man, tell me where the tape at
And I'm out." I was askin' for the last kid, to cover up his mouth
He said, "The only tape I got is torn tape
A little bit of duct tape
Some ? when you're born tape
Hip hop's got tapes, a little rock and a pop tape
Last is my fast tape, OH and my jazz tape
Yo!"
I said, "Look, I DON'T WANT TROUBLE
I'LL QUICKLY BUST YOUR BUBBLE, on the double
Now somebody call a medic, forget it
Better just call a morgue man, a ?
A dead body dresser
With the cold clammy hands cause I'mma make this man a date with a stretcher
Ha! Hoh! Ha!

[Chorus]:
"I had a dream last night"
"Oh yeah"
"I had a dream last night"
"Oh yeah"
"I had a dream last night"
"Oh yeah"
"I had a dream last night"
"Oh yeah"

[Verse Two]:
I'll never forget it
On the Greyhound, headed
Up to Raytown, let it, be a fat joint that got me blowed
So I slept in, embedded between the window and the seat
Hope nobody interrupt my sleep
If I can just tell ya what had happened to me when I was dreamin' that day
First of all, see I'm one of those brothers that'll tell it like it is see?
I ain't the one to be beatin' around nobody else's bush either
Cause I'm straight forward and to the point and I won't hold my tongue
Now I was down and under the 25th and Gayle
You know, by the liquor sto'
Where the old man drink Old Crow
And the same old man with the same ole baseball cap
Comin' up to me with that same old rap
Walkin' with a limp and thinks he's a mack
Well he might have been back in the days, but I don't know nothin' 'bout that
So you know, I walks in the store
You know I gets my bottle of juice and I gets my trail mix
Can I have my trail mix
Can I have that real shit you know?
You know, huh, peanuts, raisins, dates and banana chips
Well, anyway so
So, I pays for my little items you know I gets my change
And I gets my bag and I walks out the door feelin' strange
And I looks around and I come face to face
Face to face, FACE TO FACE
With the same brother and he says
"YOU, ARE A NIGGA."

[Chorus]:
"I had a dream last night"

[Verse Three]:
I'll never forget it
At the bus stop headed
For the bud stop, let it be a buckshot that came my way
So I dived imbedded between a shadow and a tree
Ain't no nigga gonna kills me
If I could just bust a move and get myself on a bus then I can leave
Cause I don't wanna get my cap peeled
Cause I don't wanna wear a weave
Then the shot stopped
And I seen a cop at the coffee shop, I drop
Tuck, rolled, hop to where he was at and I said, "Yo Oc
The bad bwoy licka likkle shot."
