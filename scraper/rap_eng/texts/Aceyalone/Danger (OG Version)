[Hook - Mikah 9]
Danger, don't get close to
Anger, feelings might hurt you
Aim at the brain: POW
You can't understand the pain that we go through
You can't understand the pain

[Verse 1 - Self Jupiter]
Here I stand upon hope and build upon
Sunset, dawns, and a whisper
Come to a place, not a land, not a sea
But a race gone in the mist
Mysteries untold
Histories unfold
Gather 'round, my lambs of the land
I shall help you find shelter
Found a fresh morning breeze
I took a look out, swaying trees
Children skip and play
Laughter all the way
Elders hope and pray
Mothers day by day
Others cried when they lose or abuse
When they choose to
But I used too

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Aceyalone]
'Round about midnight I'm up and about
Out in the playground swinging on swings
I miss the kiss from mama, the bliss, the happiness
And the wonderful things that I dream
Snow-caps are covering up the mountain tops
Spring melts the water to streams and I count the drops
Walking on sunshine
Happy days are among us, I feel splendid
Having a good time
I wanna be free!
Don't take me, please don't end it
Not a cry, a teardrop, but smiling
On a light, bright morning
I dedicate my life to me
For the dawning is a new day forming

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Mikah 9]
What light through yonder window breaks
Look at the rainbow, ponder lakes
Our shallow hollow follow screams
With ice cream sticks
Boppity-bop the tears roll down my face
I just can't stand to face
The man in the man (man in the man)
'Round, 'round, 'round goes the Mary go
Found, found, found the scenario
'Round, 'round, 'round goes the Mary go
Found, found, found the scenario
Crown, a king of my dreams in a small town of streams
I dance before the things
And ring 'ya all I'm lurking the phono
Rhymin' a whole soul
Ominous bold soul
Soaring
Outside my house it's pouring
I see a mouse running
Into a sewer
Pipe dreams, pipe dreams
