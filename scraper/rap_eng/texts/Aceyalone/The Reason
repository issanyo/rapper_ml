Music please...

Yeah
You want to know the reason
You want to know the reason
The reason is we gotta have those guidelines
I'mma break the guidelines
I'mma move the barriers
I'mma cross over the barricade
And we gotta have balance
The reason is balance
The reason is everything gotta be weighed out and smoothed out
And be in perfect harmony wit' each other
You know want I'm saying
The energy gotta be there
You know what I'm saying
The reason is the hurt
The reason is the hold
The walls, the windows, they got eyes, they got ears
The jabberwocky, the test of the manhood
We got the grandfather clock
We gotta have time
We gotta have the reason
We gotta know the march
We gotta know about the faces, face the faces
We gotta have the hunt, the hunter has to die, the hunted has to die
So we have the thief in the night
We gotta have the thief
The reason is the thief
The reason is it's all human language
It's all human language
It's for you, it's for him, it's for her, it's for all of us
It's human language
That's the reason
You wanna know the reason
That's the reason
