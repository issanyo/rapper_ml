[Aceyalone:]
Project low...yeah
(I love it) Yeah-yeah!
Whoo--coo-coo-coo...

[Chorus: 2x]
I go easy on the coke, you know
Heavy on the green, don't pop the pill
Amphetamine, or aspirin
Only thing I shoot up is the sound at the scene
And if the DJ pull up, I still do my thing

Hey! I gotta let you know I'm (real, real, real, real)
Tight, I'm a professional and this is how the session go
Look, I'm exceptional shine (real, real, real, real)
Bright, West Coast you know and yes
I'm gonna test you tonight, sensational... (real, real, real, real)
Psyched, motivational I guess it's just
A sign of the times, and when I'm facin' you
It's real, real, real higher heights, I got a tune for you
More than just a couple of lines...

[Chorus]
I go easy on the coke, you know
Heavy on the green, don't pop the pill
Amphetamine, or aspirin
Only thing I shoot up is the sound at the scene
And if the DJ pull up...

[Chali 2Na:]
Yo, Chali 2Na! I'm the viscious, contraversial, I'm
Real, real, real, real, ill every verse I I pull will lead
A horse to water, to drink

Real, real, real, real deal show no mercy when

Smoke off the green when I land on the scene
