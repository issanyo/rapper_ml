[Intro]
Where in the hell did the hip-hop go?
Where in the hell did the hip-hop go?
Where in the hell did the hip-hop go?
Yo Aceyalone do ya' know, do ya' know?

[Verse 1]
Well here we go, hot cake dough
Jellybean, banjo, candy store
Polka dot backpack, microphones
Shama Lama Ding Dong, doggie bone
Chippa-chippa chop, bust the flip flop
Skateboard, tennis shoes, ice cream shop
Telephone poles, baking hot rolls
A '91 pinto sittin on Vogues
Bubble gum, tick tock, hound dog fleas
Cock a doodle, doodle and some hog head cheese
Leap out the room grab the old broom
Eat a watermelon and walk on the moon
Cherry Coke, cantaloupe, little old maid
A big black berry inside the Kool-Aid
A bass guitar, a old fruit jar
A green canteen and a chocolate bar
Cannonball, baby doll, football fan
I flipped the mad dog and a Japanese man
A double bunk bed, a 40 to the head
Now get up and watch me rap the cornbread, hey

Hey, I hear ya
Yo' Aceyalone I hear ya

[Verse 2]
Well have ya' ever killed a great white shark? Well, I have
I was on a boat I built and sailed around the world, don't laugh
Yeah I was a crook an' met Captain Hook an' got tookin' a captive
Wrote a book in, 31,000 chapters, yeah, yeah, that's it
I seen the ghost of augie?/boggy creek
I went to Fantasy Island, Gilligan's Island and Pirate's Peak
And then to Napa Valley rappers alley and stayed a week
I met the queen of all my dreams and we danced cheek to cheek
And then we freaked
Had a fight with King Kong, Godzilla and Rodan
Johnny Sokko's giant robot and wrestled with Conan
I jumped in a rocket with Davy Crockett, headed for no man's land
And landed and seen a time bandit in the sand
I travelled with Gulliver and I'm a {gulible, loveable, hunk} on patrol
Looking for the Acupulco pot of gold
He blazed, I raised, little bastard got me flowed
I hit the road, had a hitch with son of a bitch who turned into a toad
You ever slept on Blueberry Hill well I will
I'll have to connive and cook and clean for a meal and that's real
I planted three jolly green bean weed seeds in a field
A tree grew all the way up to the sky and I smoked it

[Interlude]
Well I seen zig-zag when he was zooming in a Z
Looking zonked and zany like a Zulu zombie
He thought he was a zenith with a zebra on the scene
He was a buzzing in the zone like he was zapped
(Bullshit!)

[Verse 3]
Well jingle bell, jingle bell, sugar on toast
The Fellowship Shop is from the West coast
Hey hash and eggs, crocodile legs
I'll bring the chronic, you bring the kegs
Buckwheat and Stymie's down with Rodney Allen Rippey
While Tommy and Annica's beating up Pippi
Karate chops, snap crackle pops
You do the hip thing and I'll do the hop
Cough up a lougie shake break and boogie
Cause I got a home girl that's giving out nougies
Mr. George Bush was on my flo'
Cracked out, butt naked, watching Cosby Show
Hey, Little Rascals, Eddie Haskell
Black eyed peas with a lot of Tabasco
Chick-O-sticks, big fat chicks
Old reruns of The Jeffersons hits
Eenie meenie miny Mo, Larry, and Shemp
Slide me some skin on the black side, pimp
Training bras, holey drawers
Vonte and D double E, breaking all the laws
Double dutch, afros, parakeet crap
Honey I killed the kids with my rap
Then my DJ Kiilu he came and said
(Yo I'll scratch the break you rap the cornbread), hey

[Verse 4]
See I'm a big old black man, a big old black man
A big old black wacky tacky black man
Born with my momma, arrived alone
And I'm alive and survive in a one room home
Never take a hand-me-down never dig a bone
I give and I live and I handle my own
Used to be a peewee, now I'm full grown
Not a shufflin' jigaboo, I'm hard like stone
I drink out the jug, I eat out the pot
I learn and I earn and I love what I got
My momma ain't a housewife daddy ain't a cop
I was taught to be a fair man, shoot your shot
Snake in the grass livin' in the past
Ain't nobody got my hindside I'm a think fast
I'm the chugalug thug from Nicolett and Arquette Street
A watermelon sellin' bailin', no good cheat
Not a lie two-facin', a liquor jar tastin'
I'm a ebony woman chasin', got no time for wastin'
So bring in the news, singin the blues
I don't shovel no shit and don't shine no shoes
I'm a big old black man never had a friend
Sittin' on the roof top listenin' to the wind
My life is on the end, my grin is pretend
I'm a die in my rockin' chair sippin' on gin, hey

[Verse 5]
See I'm a bad boy, I'm Aceyalone, I'm Aceyaloony
I'm Aceyalone a nigga from the boonies
I'm Aceyal-on the edge, a motor corroded, your booty exploded
Devoted to zany, rainy, brainy
Topic can't be lame
That's the same ol', same ol' thing, baby, bubba
What you say, what you thought, was really going on
You don't know right right but you got caught by
Aceyalone ranger, Aceyalone stranger
Willing to gimme a pound cause I'm just abound to lose you
So bamboozle out instead
Just remember that brother who spits the cornbread
