Easy does it does it cousin, you ain't got your license
You're icing on a cake and I think that you're slicing
Me, I'm so precise with the assembly design
Smooth like hefeweizen and take a lemon to the lime
You're simple in the mind, you ain't even near yet
You gotta get your hair wet you're stepping in bear shit
Hit you so many times have you busting a pirouette
I'm top gun nigga but I'm cruising the lear jet

Cause I'm Grand Imperial, Grand Imperial
That's what they're saying when they mention my name
Grand Imperial, Grand Imperial
That's what they're saying when they mention my name

I got a handle on them, animal instinct
My claws locked up, hands dripping with pen ink
I'm sharp steel, cutting deeper than skin deep
So give me ten feet while I'm making my ends meet
You see my goal is to just be the coldest
Mic holder who ever got to touch the controller
Whoa, my whole aura is soul, a soul rolla
Fight the evil spirits in the universe, I'll do you first

Grand Imperial, Grand Imperial
It's what they're saying when they mention my name
Grand Imperial, Grand Imperial
It's what they're saying when they mention my name

That's what they're saying when they mention my name
Grand Imperial, Grand Imperial

It's strict discipline when I gotta listen in
Working while I'm whistling and keeping 'em sizzling
Maintaining the mainframe and the network
Less work, there's nothing to gain but immortality
The ideas, they give way to a higher source
The kinda sorcery we're doing for a sport
It's all about channeling the force, not having remorse
A principality and this is my reality

It's Grand Imperial, Grand Imperial
It's what they're saying when they mention my name
Grand Imperial, Grand Imperial
It's what they're saying when they mention my name

So when I sign in, there's no need to chime in
Black, Jewish, or Chinamen, it's all about rhymin'
Fate got the perfect timin', and karma is a diamond
Up and above and beyond the norm
Hands, legs, arms, form b-boy poses
Roses on the stage when the last show closes
Flows, and you follow like you're walking with Moses
Double doses is potent, when I'm rapping it's official

I'm Grand imperial, I'm Grand Imperial
That's what they're saying when they mention my name
I'm Grand imperial, Grand Imperial
That's what they're saying when they mention my name
