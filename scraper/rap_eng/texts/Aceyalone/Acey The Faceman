[Intro: Aceyalone]
Y'all niggas is so dope
Y'all niggas is so tight
Y'all niggas is so old
Original when it comes to the flow like that

[Verse One: Abstract Rude]
Acey The Faceman always get us through the door
We come from the slum, Wasteland, bottom floor
Gutter
They gave us the name "Ghetto"

[Aceyalone]
Just catching up to what we told y'all years ago

[Abstract Rude]
Acey The Faceman always get us through the door
With notoriety, style variety and more
L.A., they gave us the name "Ghetto"

[Aceyalone]
I love it when a plan comes together

Yo yo, I'm Acey The Faceman
AKA the Ace Man
Aceone
Acey De Uno
Acezzi
Double A
Aceyaloha
Aceyaloney from here to Coney Island style for ya
I was raised off musical intuition
My poetical gift is too much to mention
Classified, S is repping from the sky
Who talk that crazy talk off the fly
I've been in my laboratory dissecting specimen
Making beats and rewriting the testiment
I took an estimate, meaning that I estimated
On how many styles I've investigated
With the scorpion, Ab' Rude radical
It's emphatically mathematical and so magical
So let me holla at ya face to face man
From he promise land to the Wasteland
A bomb is two man band with mics in their hand ready to lace man
I rock the microphone gallantly
And roll till I'm over the hump, yeah
Then we jump in the arms of the two turntables and bump
Never will we fake the funk

[Abstract Rude]
Never will we fake the funk
A-Team
I love it when a plan comes together

[Aceyalone]
I love it when a plan comes together

[Abstract Rude]
We on point

[Aceyalone]

[Abstract Rude]
Now are we on the same page?

[Aceyalone]
Yeah we on the same page

[Abstract Rude]
My mic sounds nice and we ready for the stage
Now are we on the same page?

[Aceyalone]
Yeah we on the same page

[Abstract Rude]
We pay for the millennium but not minimum wage
Do we say the same thang?
We in the same gang?
Access granted now we in the mainframe
Going through the new age
On a crusade
If you ain't with this business get out the Kool-Aid
For my two G plea
We be on point living plush
And the way they do it ain't us
Must of what you heard not enough to quench
We're the starters, you ride the bench

[Aceyalone]
You getting served

[Abstract Rude]
You couldn't hang if I gave you the rope
Yet you claim that you so damn dope
When you know that you can come tighter
You're here and gone like the clouds of a skywriter
As far style, you're just a biter
Vibe sucker
Not a crowd rocker
Faker, in this city of Dodgers and Lakers
Kings
Project Blowedians
A-Team
L.A. big city of dreams
Before it all floats away, and you all go astray
I'ma show each of y'all the way for tomorrow
Tell 'em which path to walk

[Aceyalone]
The straight and narrow

[Abstract Rude]
Butter
I love it when a plan comes together

[Abstract Rude]
We on the same page

[Aceyalone]
My mic sounds nice let's take it to the stage
Now are we on the same page?

[Abstract Rude]
Yeah we on the same page

[Verse Three: Aceyalone]
The coming of the age and I speak it like a sage
Rappers
Are indentured servants
It's so urgent that we cause some disturbance
Ring the alarm and break out the pistola
Another sound bwoy dies by the hands of the soul controller
Like trying to escape Ebola
But there's no vaccine for your wack scene
Word to Maxine, say the water ain't clean
They're asking for the A-Team ain't no waiting
We'll be there in the nick of time
Yeah and prepare to kick a rhyme
It's the story of my life
Do what cha like
Drink Bacardi at the party but don't touch the mic
Thinking back to the corporation stockade
Rapper slave trade
Masquerade
I walk the outskirts of the big parade
It's lights in the distance
Light the incense
Without any resistance to fire up the pistons
Smash on the gas and knock down the tents
Stop the floats and I represent
Gaffle up the band and make 'em play this
By the powers vested in me they can't resist
Who?!
The A-Team

[Verse One: Abstract Rude]
Acey The Faceman always get us through the door
