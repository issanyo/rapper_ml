Definition of a woman
No synonym
There ain’t no other like you
I tell you this over and over
Perfection in its purest form
I can’t lie
Perfection isn’t everything
Confession: I can show you things
These ain’t just words
Affection is the weapon
Threaten me with a good time
Oh my, oh my

[Pre-Chorus:]
When you kiss it
You A-1 with it
Never try to counterfeit it
You got the comma
Zero dollar amount
Girl, I know this, it’s duly noted
The love is real, yeah, we condone it
That’s why you deserve the crown
Crown
Every since day one, ain’t no doubt
No matter sun up, sun down

I’m way up
Yeah, she keep me way up
Oooh
Like I’m walking on the moon
Way up
Stay way up
Oooh
Like we’re walking on the moon

Way up, way up, way up

[Verse 2:]
When I see you, the world is muted
Touch me while we’re in slow motion
The pressure of your lips on my lips
Ain’t no other feeling like this
Oh my, oh my

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Way up, way up, way up

[Rap: Wale]
Wale though
Every blue moon
Yeah, everything mint condition
It’s good
Uhhh, let’s get lifted
The sky is not no limit
No, my dear, this our beginning
Touch down and I pick up
Get dressed and undress ya
Mint condition her outfit
You’re my pretty brown agenda
Connect with me mentally
Yes indeed
Into her physically
Ready for anything
Sex is a weapon, machete me
Hennessey, Hennessey, Hennessey, Hennessey
And it don’t got nothing to do with this verse
But it’s hittin’ me! Wooo!
Shorty body is everything
Panties is falling, now I’m harder than trigonometry
Problems about a Ivy League
I just want you to ride with me
And I promise I got you
Right now, the sky, we way up
Wale
Blue moon

[Chorus]

[Outro: Wale]
