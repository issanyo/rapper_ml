[Intro]
Yeah, hah
Aceyalone, 2K6
Yeah, one time for your mind
Two times for the rest of your life
Yeah, uh, get some, get some
Let's get busy, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm in the crib with the radio cranked up
Loud as the world but nobody else can hear it
I spit lyrics over beats with the break-up
Listen to the hook while they're screaming out wake up
You gotta move through the world like you own it
I'd never known it to be such a thing of the past
Love life, let it love you back
I think fast, that's why I think I'm out of your class, c'mon
Tennis shoe pimps, part time players
Preachers on a soapbox lead us in a prayer
I know you wouldn't lie in my face, you wouldn't dare
No it ain't fair, three of a kind can be the pair, yeah
But I'm a jack of all trades, gotta back 'em off
Lead 'em if they wanna come but it ain't no slackin' off
Like to lay low 'til it starts crackin' off
Give 'em more than enough time to get they mackin' off

[Chorus]
Yes God, I'm doin' my job
I got a squad of soldiers who are ready to mob
We find one foreign tongue, we rip you apart
The ancient art of healing baby, give me your heart
Yes God, I'm doin' my job
I got a squad of soldiers who are ready to mob
We find one foreign tongue, we rip you apart
The ancient art of healing baby, give me your heart

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, papa's got a brand new bag
And old drag of coach swag, zig or zag, yeah
What a dilemma tryna be a swimmer
Crossin' a river without a boat, tryna deliver these notes
I'm just a messenger, don't dig with the message
You better get it where I got it, show you right where I left it, and if
You think we ain't on the brink of somethin' new, I'll give you somethin' to do, now don't blink
When all my hokies call me, no one should be able to hold me
They sew me out and try to control me, they frontin', they phony
And in one split second it's a glimmer of light
'Member the masters, power of people unite
I ain't never been on a level without any honor
I ain't interested in givin' up so don't even bother
While others tend to drown, you can wade in the water
You gotta try harder and know exactly what you a part of, c'mon

[Chorus]
Yes God, I'm doin' my job
I got a squad of soldiers who are ready to mob
We find one foreign tongue, we rip you apart
The ancient art of healing baby, give me your heart
Yes God, I'm doin' my job
I got a squad of soldiers who are ready to mob
We find one foreign tongue, we rip you apart
The ancient art of healing baby, give me your heart

[Verse 3]
All year, all year, it's here, here
I know some of y'all better just steer clear
Got a hundred tons of funk when I dunk, I ain't drunk
And I'm runnin' over roadkill, dogs and deers
Yeah don't stop, don't pause, switchin' gears
I veer left, fear death, not eyes and ears
I ain't got a problem runnin' right into your barricade
Breakin' down the wall in my life, I ain't afraid
Can't get enough but I take what I need to marinate
And be with the goddess of singing, a beautiful serenade
The rope cutter, hope dealer, gorilla
But I will sputter, I'm from the gutter, the long strutter
This is the era of the perfect era

[Interlude]
Yeah, get some
Aceyalone, Project Blow

[Chorus]
Yes God, I'm doin' my job
I got a squad of soldiers who are ready to mob
We find one foreign tongue, we rip you apart
The ancient art of healing baby, give me your heart
Yes God, I'm doin' my job
I got a squad of soldiers who are ready to mob
We find one foreign tongue, we rip you apart
The ancient art of healing baby, give me your heart
