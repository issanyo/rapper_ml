(Hook)
Yea, this is for the 30 and up
Aha, grown folks that be earnin the buck

(Hook)
Yea, this is for the 30 and up
Aha, grown folks that be earnin the buck
Gotta tell the kids hurry it up
God, she won’t dirty it up
Come on

(Verse)
It’s not a phase, I done earned my grades
From everything I learned from way back in the days, yea
Peepin how the game goes same old, same old
Underneath that rainbow a shit on a shango
You got your own thing, no you fiend family
I’m on my grown thing, playa don’t challenge me
I gotta right, life on the balance bean
Still keep it mackin, now hold it down naturally

(Hook x2)
Yea, this is for the 30 and up
Aha, grown folks that be earnin the buck
Gotta tell the kids hurry it up
God, she won’t dirty it up
Come on

(Verse)
Say yea oh dream, hit it like I was there
It must’ve been nice but now it’s a must win
We young and getting money bruh, how could we trust them
Spend it while we got it man, that was the custom
A whole different design, speak yo mind
You used to have a fight, now we keep it all the time
I do a little something just to get a little shine
But we run this mouthful, get hurt, stop cryin

(Hook 2 x2)
Yea, this is for the 20 and up
Aha, ridin round, not givin a fuck
Aha, at the party, just livin it up
Yea, got the world and ain’t giving it up
Okay

Yea, this is for the 30 and up
Aha, grown folks that be earnin the buck
Gotta tell the kids hurry it up
Got the whole world givin it up

Yea this for the 40 and up, aha
