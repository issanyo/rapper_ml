[Hook]
Well here I am
In the middle of an open hand
My feet are rooted in an upright stand
What's my plan
I feel the fingers closing in
I got enlightened by the chosen man
A little frightened by my foes and fans
I’m still recitin' doing shows with bands
Hold my can knowing that I’ll float again

[Verse 1]
Well it's time to face the law
You shouldn't have done it now I’m breaking down the wall
No time to run around lurking through the hall
I’m gonna hunt ‘em down winter spring or fall
Even the summer sound all because of y'all
My name's a number now if you see what I saw
Then you would wonder how he decides to call
And pull me under while he was walking tall
I run a sign
Glistening sensory blaze sets my heart
Glistening from antihistamines crumb chop chop from a plum tree top
Club house for one
I elect select none, HEY!
What’s-a matter you, HEY!
Why do you look so sad, HEY!
It’s-a not so bad, HEY!
Ah, Shaddap You Face, HEY!
What am I now, what am I now
What am I now, a waste of flesh
Mama leave me on a doorstep why don't you
Well nothing best unless you want to see me starve
Look at her dress, her breasts life's hard

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now one for the money and two for the show
Now move to the pickaninny saying flow cat flow
Jump on to the rhythm and break your mind free
C’mon for the ? fire and me
Say life is temporary it makes him upset
Regret to say the penalty for perjury is death
Everybody picking up on so one play
My soul will run fate
I’m bound to the rhythm draw down from my hand
Bow down to the mother in African land
Sounding like our people in love with Tarzan
I’ma tell him I’m a big ole jet black man
Pappy told the folk tale underneath the tree
Pull up on his coattail sitting upon his knee
Said Mandingo your lingo Swahili
Drums are the tongues of the sacred
Learn to stand stern and just don't trust any
Soon you can freely run naked
Park it at the will call darken in the past
Starting at the shortfall right into the grass
Oom shaka laka oom shaka laka wrath
My spear is in the atmosphere in his ass
Allah made the universe the devil made the lie
The devil made the hypocrites and Allah made the sky
The devil got your flesh and bone and Allah got your eye
Allah made the righteousness the devil made the spy
The devil is the infamous and Allah is the high
Allah made the apple tree the devil made the pie
Allah will rebuild the truth the devil will deny
So know me not for what I am but know me ’til I die

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You see I’m born a nigga die a nigga nothing in between
Who the hell are you to say that I ain't got a dream
Malcolm nigga Marcus nigga Martin nigga King
Thievery and grievery is all a nigga seen
Jesse nigga Bessie nigga Bubba Willie green
Monkey and gorilla nigga mammy was a queen
I’m a nigga he's a nigga niggas are supreme
And every time you kill a nigga we become a team
Hey nigga, yeah nigga, say nigga, wassup
Yo while they got you on this tip I’m finna bust a nut
And selling out is wacker
Your black is getting blacker
You know the truth, I got the proof
The devil is a cracker
