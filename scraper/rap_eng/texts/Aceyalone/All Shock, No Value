[Verse 1: Aceyalone]
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I'm ballin with this pen and I'm about to get my bowl on
Fit to heat it up and I hope that they got their coat on
They all against the wall and they all about to get wrote on
Hip-hop take 'em away, that's what they use to holler
How can I adapt to this poison? Man I'm used to water and butter
It ain't another one, the full discovery
Give these people all what they need, that's why they loving me
It's top-notch soda and scotch without the soda though
Styles like running for miles we meet the quota though
They wonder why I come tag, we go toe-to-toe
Don't even know me though, don't know how fast the motor go
It's rodeo, they tried to play me out but then they never did
Such a clever kid, we promised we'd forever live
Life valuable, on the mic infallible
That's why we spit that radical
I know, I know, I know, I know
They put your whole world in a box, I can save it for you
You can have the time of your life, that why they made it for you
Maybe I'm just the hunter, the lightning and the thunder
The days they had to wonder how we created the underground
It sound so impeccable, we had to work
I'm talking shovel dirt, rappers put under the earth
To free the hip-hop nation, it's still a curse
I gotta feel it first, then go gorilla on a verse

[Chorus: Aceyalone]
They all shock no value
They all shock no value
They all shock no value
Hold on, hold on, hold on
They all shock no value
They all shock no value
They all shock no value
I gotta feel it first, then go gorilla on a verse

[Verse 2: Blueprint]
They don't make 'em like me no more
They say, "How can he be so raw?"
So many styles never seen before
They ask, "How can he be so sure?"
They wanna know how did he get on
They didn't think he'd be here for long
And wonder why they didn't see it before
He used to be the guy they would ignore
Guess you can never tell, the waves 'til you set sail
Many with lines but not a single one parallel
Find the right angles, lines that might strangle
Once combined the rhyme is sharp as a triangle
Mind tangled like as a stage full of mic cables
Interconnected but separate and single
Just wait until I hear the starter's pistol
Unlimited horsepower is coming out of my stable
When they were alive they weren't half as nice
Now they're worth twice as much in the afterlife
They never mic check unless the check is right
But everything we have is because we have to write
No label-mates, what I make's beyond label
Songs that are strong as a snake's bite is fatal
So grab a plate of what me and Acey made you
Food for thought, right up to your kitchen table, like

[Chorus: Aceyalone]
They all shock no value
They all shock no value
They all shock no value
Hold on, hold on, hold on
They all shock no value
They all shock no value
They all shock no value
I gotta feel it first, then go gorilla on a verse
