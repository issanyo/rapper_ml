Pump it up a little bit
Alright look

[Verse One]
See I never really new life could be so hard
I never really new pain til I got scarred
I never knew people could be so cold
I never knew wrong til I was ten years old
I never knew fighten til I got my ass kicked
I never knew gettin' got til I got tricked
I never knew healthy til I got sick
And I never knew people killed people so quick
Yo, I never knew mind power could be so deep
And I never knew hardship was mine to keep
And I never knew the wolves attack the sheep in their sleep
And I never knew people played people so cheap
Yo, I never knew that we was in such bad shape
And I never knew what I would have to do for the papes
And I never knew that I would put my life on tape
And I never knew hip hop would be my escape
See I never knew real folks could be so few
And I never knew so many people don't got a clue
And I never knew beautiful til I met you
But, never say never because it never comes true

[Verse Two]
Hey yo, I never knew that some nigga's just don't bury beef
I never knew that I brought you so much grief
I never knew that you was a two time thief
The way you stole my heart was beyond belief
Yo, I never knew my medicine would come in a leaf
And I never knew that life could be so brief
And I never knew that I would get no relief
I never knew so many Indians that wanna be chief
Yo, I never knew the wrong move could cost yo life
And I never knew the wrong move could cause yo strife
And I never knew money could just buy you fun
And I never knew so much power came with a gun
Yo, I never knew that I would have such bad luck
And I never knew the next man could get you stuck
And I never knew lighting til I got struck
And I never knew that you would go so low for the buck
Yo, I never knew real folks could be so few
And I never knew so many people don't got a clue
And I never knew beautiful til I met you
But, never say never because it nver comes true

[Verse Three]
See, I never knew the future would be like the past
And I never knew a woman could just slang that ass
Yo, I never knew that you were so sassafras
I never knew that you played the game so fast
I never knew that there was no time to waste
And I never knew no one who could take your place
Yo, I never knew reality til you showed me a taste
And I never knew how you made my heart beat race
Yo, I never knew courage until I got brave
And I never knew discipline until I behaved
And I never knew freedom until I became a slave
And I never knew that I would take this to the grave
Yo, I never knew that I had so much to lose
And I never knew I had so many to choose
And I never knew an ego was so easily bruised
And I never knew the game until I studied the rules
See I never knew real folks could be so few
And I never knew so many people don't got a clue
And I never knew beautiful til I met you
But never say never because it never comes true
(true, true)

[Refrain]
Never say never because it never comes true
I never knew that I would be about the revenue
Never say never because it never comes true
Oh, I never knew that you didn't know what they was telling you
Never say never because it never comes true
I never knew this about the heaven and the hell in you (ha yeah)
Never say never because it never comes true
I never knew
