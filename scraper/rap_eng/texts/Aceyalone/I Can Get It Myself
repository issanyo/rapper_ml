[Intro]
They say, they say “can I get that for you?” I say “no… I got it”
Yea

Now do you need me, need me, need me here?
I can get it myself, I can get it myself
I can get it myself, I can get it myself

[Verse 1]
I jumped out the boom in a delivery room
Landed on planet, they handed me a silver spoon
I gave it back to em, I told em don’t assoom
I can, I can, I can get it myself
In class a teacher ask
If I wanted to pass I’d come out last
I didn’t wanted the grass but I just flashed
Told er I can, I can, I can get it myself
The reverend and the priest
Both tried to get my sins released
Tried to give me the blessings to kill the beast
I told em I can, I can, I can, I can get it myself
Try to put dirty money in my hand
Well goddamn, I’mma show you exactly where I stand
What? You think I do whatever but no mam
I can, I can, I can

[Hook]
I don’t need you you you you you you you you you you you
I can get it myself, I can get it myself
I can get it myself, I can get it myself
I don’t need you you you you you you you you you you you
I can get it myself, I can get it myself
I can get it myself, I can get it myself

[Verse 2]
Yea, my girl don’t take no mess
She love to get undressed and throw it to the west
I say that’s fresh and I’m so impressed
But I can, I can, I can get it myself
I don’t beg ball skill
But I will take the high road over the hills
Like that’s how I do it, baby
That’s how I feel
I can, I can, I can get it myself
I don’t buy dreams, got it but hoes sell
Hotel, motel, settle a 4 tail
Nobel, oh well, never a cotel
I can, I can, I can get it myself
Arriving at the pearly gates, God don’t know if I’m early or late
He said let me check, 1000 just wait
Told Him I can, I can…

I can get it myself, I can get it myself
I can get it myself, I can get it myself
I can get it myself, I can get it myself
I can get it myself, I can get it myself

[Hook]
