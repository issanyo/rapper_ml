[Intro]
You know there are times in life
When everyone gets lonely
And during those times
The universe will send you some where
You just have to have your mind
And your spirit and your soul prepared

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
She had her hazards on
She pulled over to the side
I pulled over next to her
And said baby is there something wrong with your ride
She said my generator
I said your carburetor
She said my starter won't start
But in my heart of all hearts
I was thinking i could date her
I said should i call a tow
She said i don't think so
I said just jump in the ride
I can take you any where that you got's to go
She said i'm not that easy
I said i'm not that sleazy
She said well i might aswell take the lift
You can drop me off by the easy
I said now thats a trooper
Some how i knew i'd scoop her
I said just put your seat back
And we can have a chit-chat talk about are future
Thats when i feel in life
She was the lonely type
She was the only type right for me
Out rolling on a lonely night

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I had my nose wide open
She had her ears wide shut
It was kinda like oops upside your head
Just tryna' get right side up
We went out to the movies
Even held her hand in the sand
Not to mention all the wining and dining
I did, just to try and be a stand up man
She was a introvert
Still kinda like a retro flirt
Told me that she heard it all twice before
I said lady i respect your hurt
Said where do we go from here
She said, she had so much fear
Even when you tryna' take it all day by day
Ya' still eating up all those years
Told me that her heart was broken
Told her that mine was fractured
How could 2 people ever bond soul to soul
If the love just can't be captured
But she had her hazards on
And she pulled over to the side
Should of knew she was a lonely one like me
When she looked in my eyes and replied

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I know your born alone die alone
But you don't have to love alone
You can sit at home and cry alone
But you don't have to be alone
