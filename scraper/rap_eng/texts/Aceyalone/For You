[Intro: LuckyIAm]

Ah man. yes
I knew I was gonna get this beat
You gotta love it
This shit makes me fucking happy, you have no idea
Let me tell you about my baby

[Verse 1: LuckyIAm]

It's simply indescribable
One I could write a song for, let me just ponder
In thoughts of you my mind wanders, wait let me correct that, I could write a book set
Yeah I speak your volume, turn up the volume
Problems I solve 'em, nerves I can calm 'em
They call me Lucky, yeah I'm like a charmer, but every word I'm saying to you, that's my honor. (I swear)
I put that on my mama's, mama's, mama's, mama, fuck my baby mama's drama
I'm a changed man, baby I'm just sayin'
We can music and love and keep it sailin'
Love Boat, no captain
We can make it happen without them restrictions that gives others limits
But trust me no gimmicks, ain't no gimmicks, trust me no gimmicks
Love, we gonna get it

[Hook:]

It's for you, you, yeah you
The truth
Everything I'm doing with you is the truth
Every moment living our lives that's the proof
Every moment living our lives keep it true

It's for you, you, yeah you, the truth
Everything I'm doing with you is the truth
Every moment living our lives that's the proof
Every moment living our lives keep it true

[Verse 2: Aceyalone]
Let's take it back to when I found you
I was hella with it and you was hella down too
I spotted you in a crowd through a whole bunch of wannabes crowding all around you
Then I got your attention, I broke the tension, it hasn't been the same since then
Did I forget to mention, me and you together like Ashford and Simpson? (Solid)
And what I wouldn't do for her
2, 4, 7, 3, 65 rude girl
You're really just a cool girl
Me and you against the world, headed to the future. (c'mon let's do this)
I know I'm a lot to handle though, unmanageable, at times I'm an animal
But I'm a modern Michelangelo
And you're my last judgement and I need something tangible

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Slug]

'Til I die, I'm by your side
A testament to the light you shine
If I needed any more excitement I'd have to grow some wings, start fighting crime
This life of mine, seen many miles of ebb & flow and nights alone
Aim my gun at the pretty smiles then run away so I can find my home
I was sitting on the front steps, wonderin' if death gonna come yet
That's when you cut through the mess
Improved my view and gave my blood breath
The negative got swept away, remember it like yesterday
You changed the way September taste and now I wanna live forever, thanks

[Hook:]
