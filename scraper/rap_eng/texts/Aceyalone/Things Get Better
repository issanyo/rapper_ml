[Intro: Daniel Merriweather]
You know he’s gone, nigga
Oh yea, he’s God sent
Movin' lights

[Hook]
Hard times don’t last forever
Things definitely get better
Through every rough storm that’s weathered
Things definitely get better
It never comes true but never say never
Things definitely get better
I hope they get to read my letters
Things definitely get better

[Verse]
Yea I know a little something 'bout hardship
Heartache, hard times, finding my starship
Lonely apartment, you feel like a target
You know how the game go
Baby take it and charge it, yea
What they searchin' for behind every door?
When it rain it pours, I’m sure you’ll get your reward
You’re staring at the skyline, feelin' some more
It’s out there, it got your name on it, it's yours, yea
Another strike against you, life that it gets is just
Even the best of us get tested for pressin' our luck
Who ever said it would be easy wasn’t saying enough
Them made us tough so we're too hard to just lay in the cut

[Pre-Hook]
Yea I know you get what you deserve it
High sign, all star, Julius Erving, yea
Or maybe you're respectable serving
The road's curving, no swerving when you get there

[Hook 2]
Bad times don’t last forever
Things definitely get better
Family got to stick together
Things definitely get better
It never comes true but never say never
Things definitely get better
Even when them friends are fair weather
Things definitely get better

[Verse]
Oh yea, it’s a worldwide crisis
And every breath of life I take is priceless
Even though they try to be self-righteous
That's exactly what divides us
It ain’t no place to go but upward
I’ve been to the bottom, baby trust me I’ve suffered
And I feel the pain, it’s a real thing, kill that
Don’t let it be a thing, just let it get through the pain
Long roads, safe travels when you get there
Life ain’t fair but just don’t sit there
Be prepared to take it all on your own square
I know it’s rare but sometimes you gotta care

[Pre-Hook]
Yea I know you get what you deserve it
High sign, all star, Julius Erving, yea
Or maybe you're respectable serving
The road's curving, no swerving when you get there

[Hook]
Hard times don’t last forever
Things definitely get better
Through every rough storm that’s weathered
Things definitely get better
It never was true but never say never
Things definitely get better
I hope they get to read my letters
Things definitely get better

[Bridge x2]
I know how it can be
But that just ain’t as bad as they seem
Uh I know you hold your head to the sky
And this keeps going on and on and on

[Hook]
Bad times don’t last forever
Things definitely get better
Through every rough storm that’s weathered
Things definitely get better
It never was true but never say never
Things definitely get better
I hope they get to read my letters
Things definitely get better
