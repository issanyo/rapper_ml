Yea,yea
Yea

Say cold water
Say warm water
Say hot water
Say hot water

Can't hold back, nah, can't hold back

Can't hold me captive
I'm just too active
They always wanna try and put you up in a cage
And try and put you on different page
I, I think the fact is
I'm just too active
They always wanna try and put you up in a cage
And try and put you on different page

Re-regenerating
I'll watch them while there waiting
They keep invest-a-ga-ga-gating
While i'm consentrating
They're not considerating
It's so incriminating
Thy're not in-ta-ta-timidating
They're just hating, hating

Yo, big brother in the sky watches over you
As long as you damn well do what you suppose to do
You never even notice till it gets up close to you
Then they post up on you
Yea, he got a problem, but he can't escape it though
Good times, bad times
Watching the paper flow
All he can think about is running and make it though
Life's to short
What the hell are you waiting for


No it ain't no mystery
Show you what i got
No you don't wanna test the water
See it's burning hot
And if you set your mind to thinking
You gone stand in heed
Didn't your momma never tell you
Land don't come for free

Say cold water
Say warm water
Say hot water
Say hot water


Yea, dope man, preacher man
Kinda the same at times
Pimps and a politics
Similar frame of mind
Forward on the button baby
Nah, we can't rewind
No, move on
Least she got it going
But she can't connect the dots
Said she want it bad
But she gotta protect alot
Alot of hard work just to get the respect she got
Whether she make it or not

Talking bout' pimps and a politics
It's all the same thing to me
But all that sugar in the kitchen
Ain't going sweeten the tea
Ya' better take a second look
Before you cross the line
Didn't your daddy ever tell you
Don't play close to fine

Break it down
C'mon
Now i know i got a tight band
Thats the reason why we all here together
That's right
Bassline
Right
Are we on time
Guitar
Yea we need horns too
Lets go
Work it out
We going to the bridge
Y'all ready
Here we go

Can't hold back, nah, can't hold back

Say cold water
Say warm water
Say hot water
Say hot water

1, 2, 3 and we done
Ha,ha
That was cool
