(Chorus)
I get up every morning bout a quarter to 5
Work a steady job just to stay alive
Get home and go to bed bout a quarter to 10
Gotta go through it all over again

(Verse)
Up early in the morning
Just to get a hold of that bread
It must be a reason why they call you hustler
With all that game running through yo head
Work 2 jobs but you’re going through windows
Whatever you bad or you done pay the rental
Work all day, hustle all night
At the end of the month, that money spent all
Work it out, overtime
Hold by the house if it sold you blind
Making sure of that checking sign
Putting my stacks up, next in line
Yea do that work, then you out
A dead end job but you ain’t if I throw
But that cash you can’t do without though

(Chorus)
I get up every morning bout a quarter to 5
Work a steady job just to stay alive
Get home and go to bed bout a quarter to 10
Gotta go through it all over again

(Bridge)
If you don’t work, if you don’t work
Then you don’t eat, then you don’t eat
You don’t pay rent, you don’t pay rent
Then you don’t sleep, then you don’t sleep
That funky funk, that do that bump
And that gasoline, and that gasoline
Yea all of the work, yea all of the work
Gon hit the streets, gon hit the streets

(Verse)
That drag race, paper chase
You want crispy bills all in yo face
Credit cards, cash machines
Living large and having things
Bank accounts, large amounts
You was lost but now you found
Working make the world go round and round
That’s what I’m talking bout
Dollars, pounds, euros, yens
Even pesos I could stand
You can laugh and you can grin
But it’s all about those M’s
Big checks, purchase
Fight or leave, you out of there
Workin man make the world go round and round
That’s what you boys can get

(Bridge 2 x2)
Some 9 to 5’in it
Some 6 to 2’in it
Some 2 to 10
11 to 7, the night shift, people do with it

(Bridge 3)
They clock in, they clock in
And they clock out, and they clock out
And on the weekends, and on the weekends
They rock out, they rock out
And they locked in, they locked in
Money getting locked out the house
Remember a way out, all the homies that I got

(Chorus)
I get up every morning bout a quarter to 5
Work a steady job just to stay alive
Get home and go to bed bout a quarter to 10
Gotta go through it all over again
Quarter to 5
Stay alive
Quarter to 10
Over again
