[Aceyalone-Talking]
Alright, yo, this all came about one time when..
I was, I was, I was, on a plane back going back to Los Angeles
Coming back from somewhere else
And I sat next to this lady and she was telling me some things
I don't remember it verbatim but I do remember some of the things she said
It was like this
She said..

[Aceyalone]
Life as we know it is about to change
I smell it within the air, the weather is getting strange
Drugged up, sedated and numb from the pain
The sickness in America has spread to her brain
She is no longer fit to make good decisions
She is completely blind and void of any vision
She parties hard and she keeps her conscious mind in prison
Therefore, she's headed for the ultimate collision
She can no longer hide the scars on her face
The innocence, now gone, is hard to replace
She has no shame, no remorse, or any grace
She embraces the Devil and she hates over race
Ms. America, the beautiful, the free
Fallen within the cracks I wish that you could see
She buried her misery with this society
It's obvious you've got no regard for me (yeah)

[Aceyalone-Hook]
Thats why you caught up, in the belly of America (yeah)
Lost, in the stomach of America (yeah)
Broken down, in the bowels of America (yeah)
Sinkin, in the garbage of America (yeah)
STUCK, in the brain of America (yeah)
Sufferin, in the body of America
Lyin, in the wicked spirit of America (yeah)
Dying, in the old soul of America (yeah)

[Aceyalone]
Ms. America, you've been a very bad girl
You nearly disgraced humanity in the eyes of the world
Vanity has took you over, you're not deserving
The mirror of reflection, is quite disturbing
She made so many promises, she couldn't keep
She neglected to mother her young, so they don't sleep
They scream out for justice, and then they weep
We're not to blame Ms. America, it's what you reap
The audacity of your inventions to rule us all
The tragedy of your intentions, to fool us all
You should've gave in to nature, and to the law
It's only a matter of time, before you fall
The things you should've worked out, in your first colony
Took some of your own advice, and your psychology
You destroyed all morale, and the ecology
I'm sorry but I don't accept your apology (yeah)

[Aceyalone-Hook]
I'm caught up, in the belly of America (yeah)
Lost, in the stomach of America (yeah)
Broken down, in the bowels of America (yeah)
Sinkin, in the garbage of America (yeah)
STUCK, in the brain of America (yeah)
Sufferin, in the body of America (yeah)
Lyin, in the wicked spirit of America
Dying, in the old soul of America (yeah)

[Aceyalone]
Oh Ms. America, so much attraction
They should've taken responsibility for their actions
We work around the system and make adaptions
So you could let freedom ring, within your faction
How can people still be hungry, when there's a surplus?
Suffering within your home, you made them worthless
Damn near police the state, and make us nervous
Even though some conform and join your service
Your presidency is the biggest joke, but where the laugh?
I always smell the gun smoke, on your behalf
I think I should send a telegram to your staff
America, you're down and dirty
You need a bath
So tell your Secret Agents don't be paranoid
This wasn't taught by Socrates or Sigmund Freud
This is simply God's work, you can't avoid
Every nation ever built, has been destroyed (yeah)

[Aceyalone-Hook]
Cause we caught up, in the belly of America (yeah)
Lost, in the stomach of America (yeah)
Broken down, in the bowels of America (yeah)
Sinkin, in the garbage of America
STUCK, in the brain of America (yeah)
Sufferin, in the body of America (yeah)
Trying, in the good old spirit of America (yeah)
Dying, in the old soul of America (yeah)
