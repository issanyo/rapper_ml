[Intro]

Yeah
Yo, what up?
This is Aceyalone
What's happening?
Yo
Let me tell you a story real quick about one of my partners
About this cat I know
One of my homeboys, and we just gonna call him Junior

[Verse 1: Aceyalone]

Yeah, Junior got some money just for being a good kid
He sealed it up and never even opened up the lid
Girls gave him candy cause he treated him nice
He took it home and chopped it up, and doubled up the price
Miss Thomas at the parent's conference said we honest
She was astonished at his confidence and what he accomplished
He respected his elders, but he knew who he liked
He listened before he talked, and he never would fight
It's like, everybody knew him or they wanted to know him
And anytime they did something for him, they felt that they owed him
He was learning a life game that no one would show him
He had more than an idea of where he was going
He grew into a young man and gained some trust
And he had a knack for pleasing people, and that was a plus
Any situation he was in, he would adjust
He never cussed, and he never fussed what he discussed

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
We was the same age, but I still looked up to him because we had this thing together
Some people just got that knack, and you can't do nothing about it
But he ended up being a victim of circumstance because he's on the rise and, you know, he's gotta battle against the odds
And my man had such a good demeanor
He was smart, man
And he was a hustler
And he had his [? ] up
And he had a natural ability to bring people together
And which people he brought together

[Chorus]

Junior had it good
Junior had it good
Junior had it good
Junior had it good

[Verse 2: Aceyalone]

By the time he turned 26, he was intense
He was becoming a young prince with a whole lot of sense
Not only could he make money hustling white
He had a little bit of everything to get you some height
They made cash with him so nobody wanted to hit him
But they'd get him if they had to get him, get rid of him quick
But why kill off the goose if you're making the grip
And why kill off the captain if you run a good ship?
Some people are strong
Some people are weak
Other are smart, but still don't got a stomach for the streets
But Junior had a different angle, he was an angel
The Calypso changed, though, the game could tango
'Cause he can't tango or dance with wolves or waltz with a rattlesnake
What would it prove?
They started salting up his program, hoping he'd lose
But he stayed cool, and he stayed steady, making moves

Yeah, okay meanwhile, Junior's off doing his thing, and living up to his full potential
But the haters, and I don't even want to call them that cause they're worse than that
But he's become a victim of the monster
You know, the machine, the revolving door
It's them that's got versus them that can't get, and ain't gonna never get

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Aceyalone]

Man, four years later, Junior got him a nice stack
Compared to what he used to have, now he's got twice that
When beef is at his door, he decided to ice that
Now knowing more and more, he was caught in a mice trap
He wanted to fight back
But who could he tell?
The lesser of the two evils would just put him in a cell
Everybody around knew that Junior was frail
But he didn't need muscles to make it, all he needed was a scale
A hundred and twenty-thousand in cold hard cash
A stash at gun blast that don't even ask
You get beat by the only one thing that can beat you
Defeat you, cheat you, the streets will eat you
Jealousy and envy make a person deceitful
Then you add greed to it, combination is lethal

Well it's a short life knowing that it won't be a sequel
Sometimes bad things just happen to good people

Yeah. So they killed him
They murdered him in cold blood
He died face-down in front of an empty safe
And for the fools that did this, I hope you rot in hell
I hope you live in hell
For my nigga, Junior
Rest in peace

[Chorus]
