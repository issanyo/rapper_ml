Yeah! And you don't stop
Now, once again Ace One is on the wax
And this one goes out to everybody
Who experienced in their lifetime
Or going to experience in their lifetime some type of hardship
Because everybody goes through hardships

See hardship belongs to me
I will never give it away or sell it for a fee
I regret to inform you I will never set it free
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be
I take my pain just like a G
Got my struggle of life down to a T
It's nobody's fault but mine if I can't see
So I open my eyes and start looking for the key
Hardship is mine to hold onto
All through to the Yellow Brick Road it goes
My shoulders got the heaviest load but I pack light
And I compensate I got act right when I conversate
See some people relate but they don't understand the words
Some people can climb mountains but can't jump curbs
And vice verse. I know it's such a nice verse
But hardship makes everything worse
And worse is a reminder to stay on the path
But hardship is mine to have
Because hardship keeps me in check
Mainly so I can check myself I give up full respect
Because he's real like a hundred-dollar bill
Without hardship you wouldn't appreciate your meals
Without hardship I wouldn't appreciate my skills
And so I do and so I grew and so I knew
That hardship not only makes most of my days blue
But it teaches me how to struggle in the jungle
And never crumble and how to remain humble
Some people they live life inside a glass case
Some people they live life in the vastness of space
And others will live long at a snail's pace
I live with hardship slapping me in the face

Because hardship belongs to me
I will never give it away or sell it for a fee
I regret to inform you I will never set it free
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be

How hard it could be...
How hard it could be...
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be
