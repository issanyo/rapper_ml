[Hook]
"We did it like that and now we do it like this" Masta Ace 'Crooklyn Dodgers

[Verse One: Abstract Rude]
He fat tracks 'em while the MC's back 'em
Big Symph Lock AKA Fat Jack 'em
We did it like that and now we do it like this
Et cetera
Search rap and find no replica
Tightest of this caliber
You ain't heard us like we been locked down in Attica
Top heavy weight challengers without a blemished record
You better look at your calendar, 'bout time I'm selected
For the airwaves, Billboards, bus benches
Plus on the Rap Page, 'nuff mentions
I've been away like a tough sentence
Flew the coup like a jailbird
They didn't stop me
They knew the truth
My time served, I'm scott free
My rhyme's served, top MC types who tend to bite
Find words from the top, go free, give me the mic
I'm a Mass Men light 'em up fast, take two and pass
Rock This Funky Joint, I'm on point
Name Aaron Pointer
Quick fast like Jackie Joyner Kersee
Bit game like James Worthy
No rapper serves me
Al B Sure of that from Albany to Albuquerque
I'll be back with a new album no worries

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Aceyalone]
Yeah, so many records, so little time
I used to do it with a beat box behind my rhyme
The sound of the bass off the wall in the bathroom
The snare off the trash can, the corner was my classroom
Just to rock the bandstand and pump up the volume
I stand where no man stand
Always keep the style groomed
With Ab' the poetical
Acey the incredible
Fat Jack the undetectable
Hip hop respectable
The A is alphabetical
A-Team connectable
The Project Blowed collectible is MC's of the future
Always and forever more, the shadow shoot ya
Back ya up or execute ya
But that's a given
Life giver and the life taker
But I like living, mic ripper and the beat breaker
I got the vision
Yeah, it's ain't final till it's packaged up the title
Like my days spin around like the almighty vinyl
Yeah
Now and then I rearrange the format
Redesign the floor plan
Show 'em where the door's at
Responsibility is hard to duck
So I keep growing so I never get stuck
Now what the fuck

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Abstract Rude]
I mic check 'em while the Rude Bwoy skanking

[Aceyalone]
And Tribe Unique is on the floor top ranking

[Abstract Rude]
The music's bumping, who blows up the function?

[Aceyalone]
Hold up or something
It'll get your blood pumping

[Abstract Rude]
Hit you in the gut, I'm true to the stuff you not

[Aceyalone]
If you don't write you better be strong enough, come out on top

[Abstract Rude]
You be the broke with only a nickle to smoke, your rent was short

[Aceyalone]
No cash
Doing the most to mash
Coast to coast and hope it last

[Abstract Rude]
Never to change

[Aceyalone]
Forever, clever and strange

[Abstract Rude]
Weather the storm

[Aceyalone]
Whether it rains

[Abstract Rude]
Snow, hail, sleet

[Aceyalone]
We'll perform in the street

[Abstract Rude]
They'll breach contracts with ya

[Aceyalone]
Or take what you can get and get richer

[Abstract Rude]
Older

[Aceyalone]
Wiser

[Abstract Rude]
And bust out on 'em like Older Geyser

[Aceyalone]
Trust none of 'em, be levels higher

[Abstract Rude]
Yes sire
