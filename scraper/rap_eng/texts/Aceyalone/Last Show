[Verse One]
I got front row tickets to the "Fuck You Up" show
Up so close I could say "What up tho?"
Dressed to impressed and my hair was cut low
But I should've gave the tickets away
First of all, I'd like to say beyond a shadow of a deezey
Rapping is fun but battling ain't easy
But babbling is easy
So is Follow The Leader
But, not if you hot and you moving at the speed of
Light, I write and kick that shit that blows 'em off the meter
Well I guess I get to kicking away
Broadcasting live from a place that you never been
Where we never bend or break over the break now
All in together, involved with the underdog
Forever in debt with the powers that create
One man, walking landmine, talking shit
Like I owe this part of this square
Rappers better run for the hills, cause they gon' get killed
As I move through the water and the air
Yeah
The world is definitely a playground
Trapped in a battlefield fighting for rank
Shit, you gotta try to score when it's all out war
On the poor and the money in the bank, think it ain't?

[Scratching]
"Hell no"
"Yeah"

[Hook]
No more sickers
And no more pickers
And no more biters
And no more tickers
And no more stickers
And no more freakers
Last show
Last show
No more sickers
And no more biters
And no more tickers
And no more freakers
And no more stickers
And no more
Last show
Last show

[Verse Two]
I got front row tickets to the "Beat You Down" show
Up so close I could say "What up tho?"
Dressed to impressed and my hair was cut low
But I should've gave the tickets away
First of all, I'd like to say beyond a shadow of a deezey
Rapping is fun but battling ain't easy
But babbling is easy
So is Follow The Leader
But, not if you hot and you moving at the speed of
Light, I write and kick that shit that blows 'em off the meter
Well I guess I get to kicking away
Not to be confused with that foolish type steelo
Or those crews on that cruise show about to be torpedoed
Smoke, fog, haze, mist, clouds ya sight
Smoke, drank, dope, this clouds ya fight
All time stands still when I'm about to recite
Well I guess I just get to reciting away
Take a guess
And make it your best
It's a sound investment when you make your assessment
There's no contestment
There's no demand
Don't worry about anything, you in good hands
Front row tickets to the "Fuck You Up" show
Up so close I could say "What up tho?"
Dressed to impressed and my hair was cut low
But I should've gave the tickets away

[Scratch Interlude]
This is the last show
This is the last show ladies and gentlemen
"Yeah"
"You could say I'm sorta the boss so get lost" - GangStarr 'DWYCK'
"Last show"
"Yeah"

[Hook]
No more freakers
And no more smokers
And no more tokers
And no more biters
And no more...

"All this can be made into a work of great art"

[Verse Three]
I'm 'bout to be a part of what they call artistic
You thought it would be easy when you first enlisted
They had an encore but I think that I missed it
They wanted me to watch it but I had to resist it
Once in a lifetime, forever when you gone
Cutting your lifeline, right from the mic line
The floor was packed
The balcony was filled up
To watch it get killed up
The record was willed up
"Yeah!"

The audience cheered
The crowd was captured, the people were listening
The tape was rolling, I didn't want to miss a thing
Took me some pictures, I got 'em developed
Your show is amazing, I'm hearing you tell it
Your name on the marquee, they billing you headline
Filling your head time
It's killing you dead time
I had front row tickets to the "Beat You Down" show
Up so close I could say "What up tho?"
Dressed to impressed and my hair was cut low
But I should've gave the tickets away
First of all, I'd like to say beyond a shadow of a deezey
Rapping is fun but battling ain't easy
But babbling is easy
So is Follow The Leader
But, not if you hot and you moving at the speed of
Light, I write and kick that shit that blows 'em off the meter
Well I guess I get to kicking away
