[Verse 1]
When I first splashed out the water
It was all wet, covered in blood
Momma covered in sweat
The umbilical cord wrapped around my neck
Choking me, doctor pushing me and poking me
I said to the motherfucking nurse, you must be joking me?
Ten fingers, ten toes like it's supposed to be
Thank God it ain't a cocame, thats when my momma spoke to me
She said son, your uzi weighs a ton
The world for you has just begun, now go out there
And have some fun and don't abuse time with earth
Cause time is poured in gold
The here is here, the now is now and the world is hella cold
So off into the street I strolled
I think I was supposed to take your head
As far as I was told it's shake, shaking the dice
You should take, take my advice
Dealing with snakes and mice, that means you can't win from losing
I never have trouble choosing, it's what I'm gonna be using
If it ain't worth doing now, it ain't worth doing at all
I ain't bullshitting with y'all

[Interlude]
Your life is here & now
No need to beach, you're proud
These moments won't belong to you
Tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Well here I am, here I stand, here I be
Behind this mic trying to set my life free
Let my shit be, testimony of the G
Who seen sights that other people just couldn't see
They say where you wanna do it, I say here
They say when you wanna do it, I say now
They say how? I say with my style
One of the few things I got in this world
My family and couple of friends, my beautiful baby girl
And procrastination, lack of motivation in your operation
I'm sorry, but I just don't have the patience, you'll never get
A second chance to dance, while you sit on your hands
We spit out the jazz for the fans, I'm soo far advanced
I had to bring it back sum, and I said fuck it
Let's take it to the maximum, like walking with ya legs broken
Mic smokin' arms, dragon, staggering and laughing here and now
I don't cry later, I put it down now, I don't wanna try later
I seize the time with ease from behind
I freeze-frame the game for the grind, I came for your mind
Not for the fame with the deaf, dumb and blind
Cause everybody's gonna get just what come to 'em
Find your guide and run to 'em

[Verse 3]
"real shit"

I wanna talk now, no you can't call me back
You're too anxious, yeah you can call me that
I wanna eat now, cause there's the food right there
No I can't wait, I just want my fair share
So where the fool that call all the shots at?
Patience is a virtue, yeah man I got that
But my clock reads half past the monkey's ass
And a quarter to his balls and it's moving fast
I just wish some people wouldn't dick around
Cause I wanna hear it now, I can't stick around
So I probably won't be in the lobby
Waiting for bobby to give me a jobby jobby
Aceimo, primo, Kimosabi, knees knobby
But stand firm not wobbly, so where we at
Right here where time is at now, motherfuck the date
Motherfuck the trial
