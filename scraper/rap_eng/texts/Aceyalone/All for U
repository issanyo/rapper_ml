[Aceyalone]
Yeah! Woo-coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Yeah! Ace One!
Yeah, and you know what I told you
I don't do this for myself
I do this strictly one hundred percent.. for you
{*scratched in background: "This one, for you and you and you"*}

[Hook]
Yeah, I do it all for you, I do it all for you
I do it all for you, I do it all for you

They put me on the wrong world, yes they did
Star on my forehead bless this kid
They threw me in headfirst, blind in the dark
In the alligator pit with the rest of the sharks
All I could think about was how they set me apart
I never knew a killer whale who had so much bark
The heart of a lion, I'm sharp as a dart
And it took me a long while to master the art
{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
You know why?

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I'm Aceyalone, how can I be of service?
What else do you need besides superb wordage?
Man I stay heated like a burner from the furnace
My shoes always brown, same color as my shirt is
I write authentic, always all in it
Outside the law, raw, never fall timid
Always ahead of myself, pushing past the limit
We taught the world to freestyle now it's a epidemic

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Yeahhhh! Woo-coo-coo-coo-coo!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I walked the long mile just because I had to
I'll be glad to add to the pile if I have to
Ain't a situation on earth that I can't adapt to
I do what I got to, and a little of that too
I am what I am but that ain't all I can be
Spend a lifetime trying to big up the family
I leave 'em with they eyes open wider than Bambi
They don't understand me, that's why they abandon me

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Yeah! Yes man!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I'm always on next and ready to bust it up
Work hard, play hard, never a customer
Skills stay hardy at the party for sustenance
Man I'm on the grind, I'm a non-stop hustler
I'll fight the fight that nobody will fight though
Spite those fools that be trying to bite dope
I'm like no other MC on the mi-cro
I might go psycho, keeping it tight though

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
One two! Yeah yeah, yeah yeah!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
No guts, no glory, it's the same ol' story for
I'm out with my nightstick, cruising the corridor
They always wanna ask why you swinging that sword of yours
Because I'm a warrior, killing them more and more
Who you gonna call when there's so many to choose from
You win some, lose some, now who wanna do some'
A new somebody who be trying to prove some'
Now I gotta move some, and give you a new sum

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Woo-coo-coo-coo! Yeah-heah!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
Yeah I'll put a fire to the house that Jack built
I rose from the grave for the people that crack killed
My name on my buckle when I'm wearing my black belt
I gave you half the world now tell me how that felt
Cause anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
And if you don't know, then I gotta remind you
Hold on to your parachute and jump when it's time to
Cause I was designed to have the people to rhyme to

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
No shit! Yeah-h-h, didn't you know?

[Hook]
