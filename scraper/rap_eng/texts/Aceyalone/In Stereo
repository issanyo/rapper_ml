[Hook]
What is that.. in the stereo
That's Acey/A.C. - Automatic Control
What is that.. in the stereo
AHHH! That's Acey/A.C. - Automatic Control

[Verse One]
I can leap over a buildin with the greatest of ease
Get up and rock the party like you wouldn't believe
Get everybody goin they'll be gone with the wind
Go all around the world come back and do it again
I can really rip a rapper for whatever it's worth
And introduce you to the greatest show on earth
Oh it's beautiful, isn't it? I had it since birth
And it feels so incredible when I'm puttin in work
It's like I'm headed for heights, I'm ready to fight
They said it be light, they said it be bright
I said am I right, now what's the use of rockin my boat
Well any way you rock it I'mma keep it afloat
It's like I fly in the ocean, I swim in the sky
I'm live in a stereo, I'm so energized
For all of you guys, and all of you gals
This is what they sayin when they hearin them styles

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Off the head to head, born to dead
Arm Leg Leg Arm back to Head
Hmm, infrared, telescopic
Audio'll transmit fiberoptics
The speed of sound, in full surround
A full metal jacket with a new compound
Amplified, deep and wide
Jump into your ride and lean to the side
Lo and behold I hit the Project Blowed road
Headed for the mountaintop, lookin for gold mode
I sold the gold but never sold the form
It's hot it's cold it's warm throughout the storm
Freakazoids, electric ladies
Radioactive robotic babies
Fuel-injection and dual exhausts
A cable antenna when the signal is lost

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
All up in your circuit breaker, doin my thing
Yo crank it to the maximum oh WHAT a machine
Movin in slow-mo, not makin a fuss
All of a sudden when they push the button I get a rush I'm gone
Climbin up the walls y'all, under your skin
I know it's gonna happen but I'm wonderin when
So I pace myself, and brace myself
Just in case myself, wanna try to get away from me
My main objective, remain effective
Fuse together rhythms that'll keep you connected
Misdirected, disengaged
Disinfected, a brand new page
Hit the corners and hug the curbs
Smash on the gas that's all you heard
Check the monitors, heatin up thermometer
Live wire kiss and you Twist like Oliver

[Outro]
What is that...
That's Acey/A.C. - Automatic Control
What is that.. in the stereo
AHHH! That's Acey/A.C. - Automatic Control
