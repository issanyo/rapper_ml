[Intro: Chester]
Come on!

[Verse 1: Mike]
I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I’m pretending to be where I’m not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake slow to react
Even though you’re so close to me
You’re still so distant, and I can’t bring you back

[Pre-Hook: Chester]
It’s true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me

[Hook: Chester (& Mike)]
I’m with you
(You, now I see
Keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes)
(x2)

[Verse 2: Mike]
(I hit you and you hit me back)
And we fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
(Fine line between this and that)
But when things go wrong, I pretend the past isn’t real
(Now I’m trapped in this memory)
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake slow to react
(Even though you’re close to me)
You’re still so distant, and I can’t bring you back

[Pre-Hook: Chester]
It’s true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me

[Hook: Chester (& Mike)]
I’m with you
(You, now I see
Keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes)
(x2)

[Verse 3: Aceyalone (& Chester)]
No, I won’t let you control my fate
While I’m holding the weight of the world on my conscience
(No!) I won’t just sit here and wait
While you're weighing your options - you’re making a fool of me
No, you didn’t dare try to say that you don’t care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
(No!) It ain’t like me to beg on my knees
"Oh please, oh baby, please", that’s not how I’m doing things
No, I’m not upset, no, I’m not angry
I know love is love, love and sometimes it pains me (No!) with or without you, I’ll always be with you
You’ll never forget me, I’m keeping you with me
No, I won’t let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
(No!) No, I’m not your puppet
And, no, no, no, I won’t let you go

[Bridge: Chester]
No, no matter how far we’ve come
I can’t wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we’ve come, I
I can’t wait to see tomorrow

[Hook: Chester & Mike]
I’m with you
(You, now I see
Keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes)
(x2)
