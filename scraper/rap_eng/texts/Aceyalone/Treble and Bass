[Hook]
It goes one for the treble, two for the bass
Brace, Brace
In your face

I said one for the treble, two for the bass
Brace, Brace
In your face

I said one for the treble, two for the bass
Huh huh, huh

I said, I said, I said one for the treble, two for the bass
Come on Acey, let's rock this place

Aceyalone:
Now I am the man, yes I'm only the man
And when it's time expand
I'll chop my way to the center and I'll stand
Feet first, me first
Baby, bubba
Let me show you what it all boils down to
I'll tap that ???? clown you
Now you know the half
Pullin' their wigs completly off they scalps
Writin' and recitin' is the easy part
To have a little style is the hard part
I'm moving like an aardvark
Screamin all your marks from the jump start
I'm ready after dark so spark
Up an L, now what the hell?
You've been here before, you know how it goes

[Hook]

Abstract Rude:
Actually, I've found the key to my survival
Now I'm liable to do anything to come up up and about
Well I can get in it and I can get wild
I can get up, I can get out, I can get around with style
Well, I've been rhyming since '84 when I was a child
I was good then, now I'm good, now I'm a be real good for a while (Abstract)
And Aceyalone on the microphone, service you constantly
[Acey:] I'm Aceyalone on the microphone I service you constantly (Abstract
Rude)
[Both:]
Yes Yes Y'all
I guess y'all
Now what the fuck y'all
Thought I had it bucked y'all
I didn't just touch y'all
All balls don't bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce (ooh give it to me)

[Hook]

[Spoken]
In your face, big baby
In your face
Aceyalone, Abstract Rude, Tribe Unique up in this open wide
Yeah we up in here wide open, fools
You just not knowin'
You just not knowin'
And you ain't gonna never know
That's the thing, you ain't gonna never know
All b-balls don't b-bounce, fool
Yeah, service you constantly
All b-balls don't b-bounce, fool
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce
You're not bouncing
Yo they say how you doing
How you runnin' through
You runnin' through the maze
Lost in the masquerade
Lost, all these fools is lost
In a maaaasquerade
I went to the masquerade party
I pulls up
Perfectly manicured head
Yo, take that back
Right to the top
