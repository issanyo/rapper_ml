(x4)

[Verse 1: High Priest]
Pilot of a pattern divisible by the sum of three
Invisible soul is pivotal on the edge of itself
Toppling over under the weight of collapsing dreams
Tears burst from the clouds with bad dreams at dawn
Style serpent merchant moving herds like scared cattle
Running from the brand name branding so and sos want labels
They will be scarred by the heat ray

[Verse 2: Beans]
Impair contaminants shrinking your physical
Inventory from my acid-filled toy squirt gun terminology
Without barely a limitation, letters and leach
From the cage of golden era of 88 name plates
Resistance is futile, evasion like running dry between rain drops
Drizzled into Darryl Hanna, Splash like mermaids
No pearls in your oyster so clam up
Symmetry of sonic image exuberance
We use an electrifying textural collage of innovation
Invoke the hostile reaction from hideous grandeur like
Traffic collision

[Verse 3: High Priest]
Beat triceratops, opulent populous populate the metropolis
In an operatic tragedy starring the man with 3 heads
I said hello, no reply, my heat ray is too intense
Burning MCs to the right of me
Like the beat, left foot forwards words will be my armor
Armor in the war of a crumbling monolith
Ego in the form of a humbling father's kiss
Armor in the war of a crumbling monolith
Ego in the form of a humbling father's kiss
Heat ray
(The heat rays)

[Verse 4: Beans]
Curses, foil your dirty dish deeds like aluminum
Difficult to dislodge, bewilderment engraved on faces
Hard to grasp without handlebars like an awkward lap dance
Her components thirst for oil when rusted
But moves with tin man ability under the influence of glossy fragility
Half-hearted pursuits of sensationalism
Lost momentum like a soldier falling on his own sword
I wonder would invoking the past fall apart if not held by staples
Open mic night neophyte, I hope you break a leg on the way to the stage
Degrade most consoles with tonsil esoteric insuring sabotage
Around the world to reach the moon
Toll-free heat ray accuracy patterns hot spot are apparent

[Refrain: High Priest]
Heat rays pyrotechnic gaze blaze a hole in you
(Heat rays)
Heat rays, inferno eye set the night on fire
(Heat rays)

[Verse 5: M. Sayyid]
The paisley-vested Middle Eastern blessed venetian
Dead like Gleason, extra large crease deacon El Debarge
Trumpet 82 need creek and deep novel fight hobbles a snaggletooth
Ill boney coyotes, the room on the prairie
Hunger for deals and gimmicks with eels, I squeel
The mic Crichton, episode gory X-File body wart
Space toured, multi-millions swarm attack the form
Hatchet, Davy Crockett ??
Alas the crack addict, evil smiling addicts
Democratic Clinton frenzy female gives a blowjob for a Benzi
Huckleberry Hound, blue dog for smog
White suit, boss hog, greasy like gouda
Style mechanic, dukes I give hazards to you bastards
Like a crash course taming baboons on acid

[Verse 6: Aceyalone]
As I watch the watch on the hand of time
Every second is precious, every minute is mine
Each hour is power so our time is short
Every mission possible with the ability to abort it
One big breath-taking snort and contort and break into convulsions
Reaching for support so I blew in through him
Windows of oxygen to ease the suffering
But that's temporary, you'll soon , dispatch
But too late they take 'em away so I'll save you all my canvas
Hang you on the wall of my worldwide living room
To the left side of my art deco
Dirty underneath stucco, two room flat
You flat line, I roam the flat lands to find where the answers at

[Refrain 2: Beans]
(Heat rays, heat rays)
Heatray primary boiling point anoint with warped geometry
(Heat rays)
Heatray primary boiling point anoint with warped geometry
(Heat rays)
Heatray primary boiling point anoint with warped geometry
Heatray primary boiling point anoint with warped geometry

[Verse 7: M. Sayyid]
Crushed out of the matter that molded man on Earth
From fire, water, air stare straight through birth of self, child estates
Child adolescent see the man I'm hesitant
To land a heaven-sent metaphor, super computer state trooper
Ookla the Mok pop duplex ?? backup
Universe on lockup through thought processes heads like Sharpton
Hard men stand watch the new clouds land
Shot a cop found dead from vocal ??
Hold Guilane, local NYC tsunami
Indonesia microphone bionic breeding season supersonic
Winning like Seattle, Sean Kemp I battle
In the gym, win and relax
As shit gets dim, power outage, silence, violence
Aerodynamic boomerang slang to your whole crew
Refrain

[Verse 8: Aceyalone]
The answers of the place from which I came
I came through aggression, love, confusion and pain
Fire and rain, stress and strain, and pure brain matter
From which I came, my name unknown, my name 'Alone
I live within the chromosome, the blood, the bone
To eat to each is, to teach yours, to teach his
Connect the ends, collect the ends, protect the friends
Make amends before they bulldoze your temple
Your matchbook house you should've built with steel wool, copper and grass
With your matchbook house, I've got rooms made of glass with your matchbook house
My roof is teflon and stiff
I use homemade tools and the power of God's help
I have some medicine that'll pick you up and make you vibrant
But I can't really describe it but I can prescribe it
You can have it
It's all yours
