Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato

Don't tip this my man
Ya know we fit's the jam
So [rogan?] where's the plan
Before shit hits the fan
A show gets ripped again
We did a round, rhyme, a riddler, reiterate
A written word, a rhythmic arithmetic, ridiculous, meticulous, Gift to give
You know me when you blew me
With your bit, lift your lid
Of the tip sound, around town
So boogie down with the brothers that will rock your party
Jump up, spin around, and sock somebody
Yeah
We like it when the beat be bumping
And you throw your hands in the air
Now
He might, she might, get night
Damn, right by way
We write, they fight, we fight
Fight, right, by light
Come ride the friendly styles of the Freestyle Fellowship
Crew
They may say, he be me
We all look alike, we all know
Tricky rhyme flow all on cue
And we’re hardcore too
Oooh

[Hook]
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato

We seen a potato about 50 feet high
We thought to ourselves we could make some fries
Grabbed our potato cutter and our knives
An started cutting them mother(fuckers), down to size
That’s when we opened up the Fellowship shop
Had sweet potato pie, and tater tots by the [wop?]
Grand opening, tater town
That’s where we met Ms. Hashy Brown
She ain’t the type of ‘tato to be be passed around
Cuz her potato skin is smooth and her (ass) is brown

[Mykah Nine]
Now since my baby left me
I ain’t been quite as healthy
So I went to Alpha-Beta
Got a sack of fat potatoes
Cuz I thought that could help me
Mercy me!
Where’s my potato?
Mercy me!
(Sweet potato pie!)
Mercy me!
(Potatos au gratin)
Mercy me!
(Curly fries.)

[Hook]
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato

Now 1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, fo’
5 potato, 6 potato, 7 potato, mo’
8 potato, 9 potato, 10 potato, po-tata
Can’t find the way to Idaho!
Create a potato, We got a cradle at the door
Afraid of tornado potato and tomato woah
The Fellowship shop blew up, and what for'
So we can get ya ketchup when ya fresh up out the flow

[Mykah Nine]
Whoa, I’m I’m I’m the Mykah Nine
And I can’t fi..i...ind the [sweaty buddy never galore?]
Mi..i..ine more potato rinds
So I can dip my tip in the skins all the time

[Self Jupiter]
Hot potato, hot potato, hop on the table
{Pull a mike inflatable?] Au gratin, Edible hot tomato
Waiter wait
Serving a plate, stay awake
How about a taste, test
Yes, take it to ya local [DJ's?] and bake it

[Aceyalone]
Well  once I see the Mexican fruit fly
On my neighbor’s ‘tato tree
What did he say to me
Maybe I should go inside and call him and tell him what’s popping
Or kick back and let the potato go rot
Because it ain’t a fruit
Potato is a root
And Mr. Potatohead is in a tato suit
So I peel off the skin, put it in a pot
Now I got my tato salad, soup, chips and chops

[P.E.A.C.E]
My shop is by the harbor
I’m the barber of Potato town
Come on down and let the man get down
The mo ‘tatos come through
The mo I’m paid
Have you ever tried to give a baked potato a fade?

[Hook]
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
Hot potato, pass the potato
