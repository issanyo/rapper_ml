[Intro]
I've been here 200,000 years and not a second or day too late
To see the change in mankind's fate
I've been here before the earth became toxic and not a moment or a night too soon
Before the planet was so consumed
(2 X)

[Verse 1]
I wanna light the skies with the greatest fire ever known to man
Kill the machine again and shred the 1000, a master plan
"Off to a better place" they say
"Create you a better race one day"
Who want's to sit here and waste a way
I think i'll travel space today
Before they came in droves they herded, farmed and tended the land
Then the world wars began
Forever altering the course of man
The great migration to a mass the wealth and protect the clan
Left devastation to all of those who played a hand

[Chorus]
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah
Oh Oh O Oh

[Verse 2]
And for the fool who ruled the kingdom and still had no regards
For all the gifts they've bring them, still he is not in charge
And for the wise man who only eats what his soul allows
And to all the proud:
They have to know the the rocket's now
I pledge allegiance to mother earth and father time
But this is our time
Every hour is mine to find
Every power ,every mind
Overpowered, undermined
The bottom line is get your ass to mars as long as time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The earth is our home
The sun is our nucleus
There's no beginning our ending of us
We belong to the universe
We are just mortals
Moving through portals
Throughout the cosmos
With out our 3rd eye closed

I wanna light the skies with the greatest fire ever known to man
Kill the machine again and shred the 1000, a master plan
Off to a better place, they say
Create us a better race one day
Who want's to sit here and waste a way
I think i'll travel space today
For the fool who ruled his kingdom and still had no regards
And now the gifts they've bring them, still he is not in charge
And for the wise man who only takes what his soul allows
And to all the proud
They have to know that the rocket's now
