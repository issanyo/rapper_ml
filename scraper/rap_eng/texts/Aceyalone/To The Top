Got moms in the kitchen and she cookin rice
Daddy out side shooting dice
Kids on the corner getting jacked by vice
Yea, life in the city just ain't that nice

We gone take it to the top, i can't wait
Is it true, hell yeah
Work it out, now gimmie some

[Verse 1]
Now i don't what i been told
People of the world are mighty cold
Now i don't know what somebody said
You make 1 false move and they take your head
Yeah, sleep all morning but you work all night
Just handle that buisness till the broad daylight
Then up again at the rising sun
Just keep on grinding till the work get done

We gone take it to the top, i can't wait
Is it true, hell yeah
Work it out, now gimmie some

[Verse 2]
They wanna bring back sexy before love and peace
Least bring back half and let the violence cease
Yeah, they brought back crack
And they recreated the beast
Where families get messed up
And only a couple really eat
Man, i ain't tripping i know they really got heat
And they ready to do some dumb stuff
Get em' off, of the street
Thats why i gotta couple of dogs
To russle up the sheep
To keep the party rocking like
Oh, what a treat

We gone take it to the top, i can't wait

Got moms in the kitchen and she cookin rice
Daddy out side shooting dice
Kids on the corner getting jacked by vice
Yea, life in the city just ain't that nice

Is it true, hell yeah
Work it out, now gimmie some

We gone take it to the top, i can't wait
