Aceyalone:
It's the audio auditorial dynamics
Don't panic, frantic
Put me in the middle and I'll battle, fight 'em off
Manic depressant for sonic embellishment
Nuts and bolts and millions of volts and concrete
And asphalt
It's the end of the world and it's your fault
Waiting for someone to open the gate
Clean slate
Greens on your plate
And still have no control over your fate
You masturbate, ejaculate, stale mate, stuck

Spoon Iodine:
What the fuck?
Abracadabra
You'll get flushed in a falling Niagara
Gush
And gore
Is what you in for
The only Clinton that I listen to is George
Speak of the devil, one world president
Rebels hesitant, check, change
Another nail in the coffin
Beware of the false prophet
And the angels with the last seven plagues
Elves, they'll carve your eyes and nose into a pattern
Your head is now an ornament
A jack-o-lantern
Hypocrite ????? state
Oh my god, I'm atheist for Christ sake
Never let us catch you
Worshiping  any statues
Or the mark of the beast
Any tattooed foreheads
Branded, God can't stand it
Showing you his last name ain't Dammit
One fled, but now he's dead
I subtracted three sixes from the back of his head
Dedicated (niggas) wanna die
Iodine

Riddlore:

NGA Fish:
And when it come to new styles, few style like I do love
To style
Ooh, whooo are theeese MCs
With their filthy paws on my silky drawers
Styles up from the bottom of my well while
While suckas put their ear to that NGA Fish shelter
Hear a new style, a 32 style in mono
I know, it seems that maybe you - kinda over - looked it
But nigga you knew that style was dangerous when you took it
B-b-b- bust blast
Dearly beloved
We're gathered here today to pay our fine respects
To this newly departed style
It was a good style
It died so young
Why so young?
Snatched from the tip of a tounge
In it's prime
This rhyme'll rhyme
Crime
Gotta stop, but I can't
Cause I master styles
????? your styles to pass it faster than expected (expected)
Aceyalone:
Eclectic... uh
Rejected... uh
Collect it... uh
Disected... uh
This is what dreams are made of... NIGGA!
Me being able to say what I really wanna
Yeah you ain't gonna
Shoot, shoot then
Shoot me, don't shoot them
Shoot
You talk shit like your mouth was a doop chute, duke
I'm about to nuke your small planet and turn everyone who looks at me to
Granite
Oh my where am I?
I need stills my legs are too high
My arms are too short I need crutches
I need help!
