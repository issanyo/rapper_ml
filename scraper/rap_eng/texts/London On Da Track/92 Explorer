[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, wow
Ahh, yeah-yeah (Wow)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1]
Hunnid and twenty, come catch me
Forties inside of my belly
Shouldn't be drivin', I'm faded (Skrt, yeah, yeah)
Rock that Nirvana, my favorite
Damn, I forgot what her name is
She in the front seat, head-bangin' (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, money counter sound somethin' like a chopper, chopper (Chopper, chopper)
Speaker system bumpin', fuck your fuckin' block up (Fuck your block up)
Used to mock him, now it's custom Bentley mock-ups (Mock-ups)
Killer drop, a call from lockup
If you buy that Echo, why you lyin'? You broke
Got a nine in my tote, get you smoke like a stoge
Keep on ridin' my coat, your new shit is a joke
Why you bitin' my flows? What you tryna be, Post?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' (Skrt)
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'

[Verse 2]
(Ooh)
She used to shoppin' at the mall (Ooh)
I'll teach lil baby how to ball
I hit Rodeo, spent like 40 G's (Wow)
Four hunnid pairs of Gucci socks
I lost all my friends, made a lot of foes
Made a lot of M's, made a lot of O's
Open up the safe (Ooh), I'm just with the bros
Cop the 458, cost me 250 (Yeah)
Man, look at all my ice (Ice)
I hit your main thing twice (Your main thing twice)
Take a word of advice (A word of advice)
Break up with that ho (Ho)

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' (Ohh)
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin' (Ahh)
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' (Skrt)
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin' (Skrt)
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' (Skrt)
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'

[Bridge]
Cold wrist frozen
Got sacks, Goldman
Bought the bar, Roseanne
No joke, deadpan

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' (Skrt, skrt)
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin' (Skrt)
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' (Skrt)
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas glancin' (Skrt)
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'

[Outro]
Ooh (Ooo-ooo)
