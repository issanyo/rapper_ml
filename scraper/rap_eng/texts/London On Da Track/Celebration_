[Intro: Derez De'Shon]
Today is like yesterday, and tomorrow we doing the same
Cuz today is like yesterday, and tomorrow we doing the same (thang)

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Yesterday I woke up i Chicago, with a bitch named Danielle
And I'm gon' do the same tomorrow
Next time I'll be in Cali, next time prolly be Miami
Got a show in Panama, prolly spend the night with a girl named Tammy
I wake up for the money, can't never fall asleep on it
And you say that's your honey, but to me she's just a freak only
She see I'm just a dog, your territory I pee on it
I fuck her like a song, freestylin', throw a beat on it
At the end of the night, it all seem familiar
I wake up in the morning, and I hardley remember
Like...

[Bridge: Derez De'Shon]
"What's your name girl?
Do yo thang, that remind me why you came girl"
Shiiiiiieeeee

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Pop them bottles, throwing money
All these nights in the club, tell me what we celebrating for (shieee)
Entertain your niggas girl, never show these bitches Love
Drop them panties what you waitin' for?
Cuz today is like yesterday, and tomorrow we doing the same (thang)
Cuz today is like yesterday, and tomorrow we doing the same (thang)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
-lyrics coming soon-

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Pop them bottles, throwing money
All these nights in the club, tell me what we celebrating for (shieee)
Entertain your niggas girl, never show these bitches Love
Drop them panties what you waitin' for?
Cuz today is like yesterday, and tomorrow we doing the same (thang)
Cuz today is like yesterday, and tomorrow we doing the same (thang)

[Verse 3: Derez De'Shon]
Ain't enough hours in a day, days in a week
I live in the club, and stay with some freaks
Blunt lit like christmas trees, bottles pop like baloons
Never broke again, ballin' Karl Malone
I met Marlon, but leave me alone cuz bitch I'm broke
And I say what the fuck I feel, and I do what the fuck I want
On that [?] I drink, smoke, I'm turnt up and she down with it
Fine puss', good head, she queens y'all, I need a crown with it
Everyday just like the other, tomorrow don't lay low
Every time I hit the stage, before I like gettin' my last song...

[Bridge: Derez De'Shon]
"What's your name girl?
Do yo thang, that remind me why you came girl"
Shiiiiiieeeee

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Pop them bottles, throwing money
All these nights in the club, tell me what we celebrating for (shieee)
Entertain your niggas girl, never show these bitches Love
Drop them panties what you waitin' for?
Cuz today is like yesterday, and tomorrow we doing the same (thang)
Cuz today is like yesterday, and tomorrow we doing the same (thang)
