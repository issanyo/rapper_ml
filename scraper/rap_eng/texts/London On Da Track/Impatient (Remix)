[Pre-Chorus]
Know your city, what you're used to
Know I ain't exactly what you're used to
Know you're prolly worried what I'm used to
I don't blame you, what you s'posed do?
Last time we fucked like it was all night
Now you got me thinking 'bout you all night
Me and you, seemed like it'd be alright
Long as we can keep it all night

[Chorus]
G'd up,,yeah I'm on, poured up, she ready
Leave here, too on, tell me where I'm headed
Tree leaf, a little O, you know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that, come here, I'm down with it
I, can't, I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no

[Verse 1]
Still dipping through the city with the top down
Shawty got that show-me-what-you-'bout-now
I ain't waiting for tonight, I'm talking right now
Still know my way right with the lights down
Set it down every time you go low
Ain't nobody worried if we on it solo
You know when we creeping it be alright
I kill it 'til you say it's all mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Know your city, what you're used to
Know I ain't exactly what you're used to
Know you're prolly worried what I'm used to
I don't blame you, what you s'posed do?
Last time we fucked like it was all night
Now you got me thinking 'bout you all night
Me and you, seemed like it'd be alright
Long as we can keep it all night

[Chorus]
Cup full, yeah I'm on, poured up, she ready
Leave here, what you on, tell me where I'm headed
Good weed, a little O, you know I'm faded
Her shape and I love that, come here, I'm down with it
I, can't, I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no

[Verse 2]
You know my type and what I'm used to
Know you probably guessing what I'm into
Fast life, living what we used to
I'm a young nigga with an attitude
Last time I seen you, we were 69
Oh I know you like it when I go from behind
We switchin positions
Now I got you thinking 'bout me all the time

[Chorus]
Cup full, yeah I'm on, poured up, she ready
Leave here, what you on, tell me where I'm headed
Good weed, a little O, you know I'm faded
Her shape and I think I love that, come here, I'm down with it
I, can't, I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no
