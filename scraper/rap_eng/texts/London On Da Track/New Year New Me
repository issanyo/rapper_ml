Yeah
It’s Savierre
New Year New Me (x3)

(Chorus)
It’s a new year (new year), and it’s a new me (new me)
It’s Savierre here, and I just got the keys (the keys)
You think it’s funny, but I’m not joking
I won’t worry ‘bout you, you don’t worry ‘bout me

I don’t got the time to be dealing with this nonsense
I am trying to make it through the year, you stank and no offense
I’m on savage mode right now, and I’m mindin’ my buisness
Yes I killed this track, my name is Savierre Penn

I don’t got the time to be dealing with this nonsense
I am trying to make it through the year, you stank and no offense
I’m on savage mode right now, and I’m mindin’ my buisness
Yes I killed this track, my name is Savierre Penn

(Verse 1)
YEAH! How you feel? How you feel right now?
Yes I decided to change my ways why you in my grill right now!?
All you do is freakin’ hate just take a pill right now!
What I’m sayin’ to you, is freakin’ real right now!

Y’all be killin me talkin’ bout my hairline ain’t straight
I know y’all can’t be talkin’ cuz you grades ain’t straight!
I love it when they say that I’m not great
Cuz the haters gonna hate and they playas gonna play!

(Chorus)
It’s a new year (new year), and it’s a new me (new me)
It’s Savierre here, and I just got the keys (the keys)
You think it’s funny, but I’m not joking
I won’t worry ‘bout you, you don’t worry ‘bout me

I don’t got the time to be dealing with this nonsense
I am trying to make it through the year, you stank and no offense
I’m on savage mode right now, and I’m mindin’ my buisness
Yes I killed this track, my name is Savierre Penn

I don’t got the time to be dealing with this nonsense
I am trying to make it through the year, you stank and no offense
I’m on savage mode right now, and I’m mindin’ my buisness
Yes I killed this track, my name is Savierre Penn

If you being so hateful, imma LEAVE YOU ALONE!
If you being ungrateful, imma LEAVE YOU ALONE!
Cause all that negative energy I don’t wanna be around
New year new me, there’s no other way around!

If you being ungrateful, imma LEAVE YOU ALONE!
If you being so hateful, imma LEAVE YOU ALONE!
Cause all that negative energy I don’t wanna be around
New year new me, there’s no other way around!

(Chorus)
It’s a new year (new year), and it’s a new me (new me)
It’s Savierre here, and I just got the keys (the keys)
You think it’s funny, but I’m not joking
I won’t worry ‘bout you, you don’t worry ‘bout me

I don’t got the time to be dealing with this nonsense
I am trying to make it through the year, you stank and no offense
