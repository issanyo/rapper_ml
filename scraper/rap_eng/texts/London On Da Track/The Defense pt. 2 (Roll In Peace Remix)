[Intro: Henry Draw]
You know, there’s some real bitches in this world
This track is about the same one from “The Race”
Same dude, same events, same shit
Let’s get it

[Pre-Chorus: Henry Draw]
No possessions in your name
Nothing you do bring you fame
You think that this is all a game
But your actions’ll get you maimed
You ain’t even got a girl, man
Guess who that is to blame
Hopefully you are ashamed
And sometime soon you can be tame

[Chorus: Henry Draw]
I can’t even breath for a minute (why?)
Without worrying about beef (what?)
Last time this shit happened (yeah?)
Everyone felt immense grief (nah!)
He try to say sorry
I told him, “homie, keep it brief”
“Let me get my cat in here
Just because she’s the chief”
I just wanna switch it up, get away from fake love (yeah)
But even the deaf could hear (uh?)
Of the misconduct here (no)
You are not welcome here, the shade I pull is darker here (shade I pull is dark)
Now we march on forward into more
Complex lyrics, hide in your annex

[Verse 1: Henry Draw]
Ay, 13 year old girl you climb
Ay, yeah that’s the same guy
Ay, say you just buy the lime
Ay, but instead go for dime
Ay, why you been trying to get cleavage pics of 3 years minor, yeah
My man keep try revive
Ay, his past-present Super Slime
Yeah, I’ma just shout some bros out
Ay, Roberto, you cool, there’s no doubt
Ay, maybe someday we can work together
Ay, when that day comes just come shout
Ay, I’m catching up to homies, I'm knee deep
Ay, the way you wanna feature, creepy
Ay, call it yellow cause yo sheep
Ay, skrt skrt on ya with my new jeep, ay

[Pre-Chorus: Henry Draw]
No possessions in your name
Nothing you do bring you fame
You think that this is all a game
But your actions’ll get you maimed
You ain’t even got a girl, man
Guess who that is to blame
Hopefully you are ashamed
And sometime soon you can be tame

[Chorus: Henry Draw & Yung Ricey]
I can’t even breath for a minute (why?)
Without worrying about beef (what?)
Last time this shit happened (yeah?)
Everyone felt immense grief (nah!)
He try to say sorry
I told him, “homie, keep it brief”
“Let me get my cat in here
Just because she’s the chief”
I just wanna switch it up, get away from fake love (yeah)
But even the deaf could hear (uh?)
Of the misconduct here (no)
You are not welcome here, the shade I pull is darker here (shade I pull is dark)
Now we march on forward into more (Yung Ricey got the rice man, yeah yeah)
Complex lyrics, hide in your annex

[Verse 2: Henry Draw & Yung Ricey]
I ain’t gon’ hop on your track, man, I got integrity
Great, that gives me some time to rap about this asshole guy
The way he lie, he deceive, con artist, a thief
She trusted you, now she got beef, but you won’t leave her alone
So she had to block you so this shit
Can stop the grow, and we can go
Back to where all of this started, home
Know she’s prone to bad situations
So you go damage relations
Ok Marth, slow down, back up
We Luke, you Darth
It’s time to stop
Rehab and help in sight
This track to make was such a delight

[Pre-Chorus: Henry Draw]
No possessions in your name
Nothing you do bring you fame
You think that this is all a game
But your actions’ll get you maimed
You ain’t even got a girl, man
Guess who that is to blame
Hopefully you are ashamed
And sometime soon you can be tame

[Chorus: Henry Draw]
I can’t even breath for a minute (why?)
Without worrying about beef (what?)
Last time this shit happened (yeah?)
Everyone felt immense grief (nah!)
He try to say sorry
I told him, “homie, keep it brief”

But even the deaf could hear (uh?)
Of the misconduct here (no)
You are not welcome here, the shade I pull is darker here (shade I pull is dark)
Now we march on forward into more
Complex lyrics, hide in your annex

[Outro: Henry Draw]
Just get the hell outta here, man
