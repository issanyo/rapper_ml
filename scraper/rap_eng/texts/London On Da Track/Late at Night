[Hook]
Peeping your aura
And baby you know that it's golden
I just wanna see you shine
Wanna see you shine
Come by my spot after dark
And just live in the moment
As we vibe late at night
Vibe late at night

[Verse 1]
I get fireworks from the smile that your mouth disperses
Ive been bout my work but I'll always put you first, 
And I don’t know how, 
But I don’t need confirmation, 
And we could slow down, 
But we’ve passed all consternation
So I don’t wanna think bout, I should have a drink about it, 
I don’t wanna think about it, I should have a drink about it, 
Had to see the world cloudy, when your presence not around me, 
So I need a little shine, to give my world a little balance, 

[Hook]
Peeping your aura
And baby you know that it's golden
I just want to see you shine
Want to see you shine
Come by my spot after dark
And just live in the moment
As we vibe late at night
Vibe late at night

[Verse 2: MNEK]
Vibe tonight
You give me this feeling
Every time, still I could rough it up show you what I’m feeling
Shining so golden
Sh-sh-sh-ining like a diamond
No-no-no nothing will change it
Baby this shit ain't the climax
You wanna go slow
But fast is how I like it
But you know that you love it
So you don’t mind compromising
Now strike a pose
Like you wearing designer
I like kicking it with you because you shine the brightest
Cause you say I’m the illest
Well I think you the badesst
You’re that little light of mine can’t nobody else have it
Now come on! who else you know?
Make the room light up
Make the whole place glow
Insatiable this love is ghost all I gotta do is sit back and watch you glow

[Hook]
Peeping your aura
And baby you know that it's golden
I just want to see you shine
Want to see you shine
Come by my spot after dark
And just live in the moment
As we vibe late at night
Vibe late at night

[Verse 3]
Take off till we both lost
Take off till your clothes loss
Take all your emotions
I'm waving your oceans
Young girasol, 
Think I memorized your glow, 
And not even dirt is down to Earth, I glad to see you grow and...
Time might just run out
So let's lose all control

[Hook]
Peeping your aura
And baby you know that it's golden
I just want to see you shine
Wanna to see you shine
Come by my spot after dark
And just live in the moment
As we vibe late at night
Vibe late at night

[Outro]
Vibe late at night
Vibe late at night
Vibe late at night
