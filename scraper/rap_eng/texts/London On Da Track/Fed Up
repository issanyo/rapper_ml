[Intro]
We got London On Da Track

[Chorus]
How you expect me not to eat you
When I was starving you ain't feed me
And now a nigga fed up, yeah
Got two kids and plus I'm broke
We been sleepin' on the floor
And all you say is keep your head up
I'm fed up (I'm fed up, fed up, fed up)
I'm fed up, fed up, yeah (fed up, fed up, fed up)
Fed up, fed up
Selling dope outside my door until the feds come

[Verse 1]
(Derez De'Shon)
Selling dope outside my mama door, yeah
Feel like I got to get it and I get it, I want some more
I got two children I want some more but right now I can't afford Selling dope outside the 'partment building 'til they callin' the folks
Just tryna keep on the cable, uh
I'm just tryna keep it stable, uh
I'm just tryna feed my babies
Ain't nobody did me no favors, yeah
Bills due, rents late, lights off, can't see in this bitch
Fuck all that friend shit
The friendships were last year, ain't nobody been real
I'm by myself, I did it on my own, ain't asking for no help
I been in and out of homes, sleeping on floors for real
And my pride won't let me ask for help
'Cause lately I been hard, it's no love left

[Chorus]
How you expect me not to eat you
When I was starving you ain't feed me
And now a nigga fed up, yeah
Got two kids and plus I'm broke
We been sleepin' on the floor
And all you say is keep your head up
I'm fed up (I'm fed up, fed up, fed up)
I'm fed up, fed up, yeah (fed up, fed up, fed up)
Fed up, fed up
Selling dope outside my door until the feds come

[Verse 2]
They cut off the lights with no warning
Eviction notice in the morning
I had a bitch but she didn't want me (damn)
She was pregnant but got an abortion (bitch)
Everything I ever loved got took from me (got took from me)
All you see pain, no love when you look at me (for real nigga)
I swear these niggas ain't shit (ain't shit)
How you say you love a nigga and you don't even like my
Instagram pic? (how the fuck you do that nigga?)
Everyday I hustle, get a script
But all that name gave a nigga shit
They took my brother from me
They took my cousin from me
They took the love out of me
I swear I believed 'em and they tricked the fuck out of me
The devil tryna play me and I'm praying I don't lose
Popping medication, drinking booze
Writing suicide notes while I'm making music
Lord don't let me lose it (Derez De'Shon)

[Chorus]
How you expect me not to eat you
When I was starving you ain't feed me
And now a nigga fed up, yeah
Got two kids and plus I'm broke
We been sleepin' on the floor
And all you say is keep your head up
I'm fed up (I'm fed up, fed up, fed up)
I'm fed up, fed up, yeah (fed up, fed up, fed up)
Fed up, fed up
Selling dope outside my door until the feds come
