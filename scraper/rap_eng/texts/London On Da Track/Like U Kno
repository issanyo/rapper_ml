[Chorus: Derez DeShon]
Ooh, she know she bad
You can't tell her nothin', that's why she act like that
She keep her hair and nails done, everything on fleek
And everything she wear is designer, yeah
From her head to her feet
Girl let me see you do it like you know you the shit
Like you know you the shit
Girl let me see you do it like you know you the shit
Like you know you the shit
Girl let me see you do it

[Verse 1: Derez DeShon]
She know she the shit and she just want to be pampered
Got niggas running in circles like a hamster
She throw that ass in circles like a dancer
But she ain't fuckin' with you 'less your bands up
Everything designer from her head to her feet
She be in Louis, no Pink, she red bottom her sneaks
Get her nails did every week, hair forever on fleek
Sauce drippin', no leak, if you broke she won't even speak like
You talkin' a whole 'nother language
You just like them other hoes that you hang with
She wanna be seen, she wanna be famous
She a bad lil bitty bitch, dangerous

[Chorus: Derez DeShon & Jacquees]
Ooh, she know she bad (she bad)
You can't tell her nothin', that's why she act like that (like that)
She keep her hair and nails done, everything on fleek (fleek)
And everything she wear is designer, yeah (designer)
From her head to her feet
Girl let me see you do it like you know you the shit
Like you know you the shit
Girl let me see you do it like you know you the shit
Like you know you the shit
Girl let me see you do it

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
If you the shit girl let me see what it do
You and your girl should come and fuck with the crew
Smoke a couple blunts and pop a bottle or two
Make a nigga spend his money when he fuckin' with you
Expensive taste, pullin' up in the flyest thing
VIP, gettin' everything
She now fuckin' with them young niggas like us
Ayy tell the wait just keep it coming (keep it coming)
You ain't fucking, girl I ain't coming (I ain't coming)
From your eyes I see you want it (see you want it)
Girl come and let me push up on it
And I'ma let you jump on it

[Chorus: Derez DeShon & Jacquees]
Ooh, she know she bad (she bad)
You can't tell her nothin' (nothin')
That's why she act like that (why you act like that)
She keep her hair and nails done, everything on fleek (she stay on fleek)
And everything she wear is designer, yeah (designer)
From her head to her feet
Girl let me see you do it like you know you the shit (you the shit ain't you)
Like you know you the shit (girl you the shit ain't you)
Girl let me see you do it like you know you the shit (shit ain't you)
Like you know you the shit (you the shit ain't you)
Girl let me see you do it

[Chorus: Derez DeShon]
Ooh, she know she bad
You can't tell her nothin', that's why she act like that
She keep her hair and nails done, everything on fleek
And everything she wear is designer, yeah
From her head to her feet
Girl let me see you do it like you know you the shit
Like you know you the shit
Girl let me see you do it like you know you the shit
Like you know you the shit
Girl let me see you do it
