[Verse 1: Skateboard Skooly]
These niggas fake, I'm real
Pussy niggas ain't authentic
No bait, fuck a squid
I be in the water with sharks in it
Lil nigga, gaining weight
I'm growing up, I'm getting young money
Never tell another nigga to suck my dick
Because the game I'm in nigga punks running
If I get mad, they goin run from me
Run from me like they done something
I'm hustling, doing shows, this the
Shit they come for me
Rich Kidz, for life now
I hope you don't think that
Shit changed. Blue shit
The crew shit, everybody knows my
Click bangs, fuck a click because
I got a team, Fuck a bitch just because she
Got a ring, fuck a bitch in front of a friends and her
Colleages. I really dont care like honestly
(like what?) like honestly
I got that feeling like finally (like what?)
Im not a team
