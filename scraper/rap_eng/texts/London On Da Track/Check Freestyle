[Verse 1: Starlito]
Naturally, we was hungry widout nuttin'
Get tha racks, big strap, you know how i'm comin'
Now i'm gettin' real money and I kinda love it
Ain't nothin' changed still got tha chop behind tha oven
I ain't really got time to wine and dine a woman
First date might tell her meet me in the back seat
House on da hill, without no deal
All cuz I keep it real, yea dats me
Even jill wanna jack me
I turn ya rap beef to a track meet
No hesitation [?] please
Premeditated, ain't nothin' but a stack to me
Flat fee, these niggas murda like its misdemeanor
[?] get to squeezin' I ain't missin' either
Free Red Dot I miss my people
Got somethin' I can't name for obvious reasons

If i told you you wouldn't prolly believe it
See I really be hollin at migos
I been got me a check but now that shit legal
[?]
Nah I ain't neva had a nine to five
Been shot at six or eight times
Through all of da crap, I survived
I been tested, never testified
Yea eats off da streets but can you specify
I been workin' on this [?]
An I been fuckin' on yo bitch, thats my alliby

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
Ready for a war, no battle cry
If they try one of mine, den i gotta ride
My astrology sign is a dolla' sign
If my money hurt cho feelins I apologize
Nigga please
I was countin' money 'fore I learned how to read
I'm one of a kind, i'm nuttin' like you
You nuttin like me, i'm a whole nuda creed
I'm with the shit, plus i'm the shit
You won't see me sweat bitch I got on degree
Get to da money cu nothin' is free
Gotta kit turn my nine to a carbon fifteen
We, walkin' round strapped like the laws done changed
I got a clip long enough to be a walkin' cane
Dog ass nigga gone off the chain
Can't trust a soul, thats tha cost of fame
Lil rap nigga hard sold separately
I make this shit look effortless
Tool on deck you get hit from long range
Like I got dat motha fucka on a selfie stick
Feelin' like da prince of Bel-Air, Fresh
Fresha than a mutha fuckin Air Wick
Still gettin' dome like a hair pick
So mutha fuckin fly i'm arrogant
I was born, I been money hungry ever since
Yea, what cha know bout it
I got a chick ridin wit me she so humble
But when she open her mouth she so cocky
Naw, I on't think you get it
I tell ya my lil brotha slangin' tha Iggy Izalia
My lady be trippin cuz i'm neva home
Bring her more stones dan Betty and Wilma
My past is one thing I could neva get rid of
You know what I see when I stare in my mirra
Narcotics deala, a weapon conceala
Financial provider for my la familia
Godspeed
