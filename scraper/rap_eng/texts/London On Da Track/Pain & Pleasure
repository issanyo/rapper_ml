[Intro]
She wrote her name across it (yeah)
Never sayin' sorry (oh, no)
I'll tell you what, baby
It's a lifestyle
We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1]
She love me through the pain and the pleasure (yeah)
Yeah, she could be the one if I let her
Yeah, I could put her name on a necklace
Yeah, we could just stay on the edge (yeah)

[Refrain]
I met her on the pole where she danced for me
Yeah, I gave her half a check, never work for free
Now she up on top of the world with me (on top)
Takin' on this life, live and die

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we are livin' stars
Yeah, we are livin' stars

[Chorus]
Love me by the night
Love me by the night
Love me by the night

[Verse 2]
She love me through the pain and the pleasure (yeah)
Yeah, we could never change for the better
Your beautiful eyes keep me reckless
Yeah, baby, put your money where your mouth is (yeah)

[Refrain]
I met her on the pole where she danced for me
Yeah, I gave her half a check, never work for free
Now she up on top of the world with me (on top)
Takin' on this life, live and die

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we are livin' stars
Yeah, we are livin' stars

[Chorus]
So love me by the night
Love me by the night
Love me by the-
Love me by the night
Love me by the night
Love me by the night

[Pre-Chorus]
