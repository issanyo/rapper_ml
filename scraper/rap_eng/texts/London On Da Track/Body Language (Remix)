Hook:
Girl I see you ain't with the playing
And I can tell from your body language
Let's talk about it
Is you bout it
Let's talk about it
Can we talk about it?
But you ain't gotta say too much
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language

Verse 1:
I love the way you keep them j's on deck
Every color so you can't go wrong
Girl your mouth be saying please slow down
But your booty saying turn me on
Put it together Miss Fashion Queen
These hoes wanna be in your spot
Girl you mean everything to me
Come here, let me give them jeans a touch

Pre-Hook:
And Don't even speak
When you walk by
Girl your energy makes the world rock
And I don't believe
That this'll be the last time that I see you

DevSpeakz Verse 2:
I'm feeling like drake in the night time
Only saw you once now u stuck on my mind
Your body got curves like a dolla sign
I swear you so fine
I'm so glad i can call you mine
Your a thick redbone with a brace face
I swear all eyes on you
I swear i won't play you like a fool
Let me kiss you in places you never been kissed before
You like how we fuck on bed and on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
I swear we gone be in there for hours
We fuck like we hate each other
We kiss like we miss each other
Ik you need a break from miami
Damn you got that Jacuzzi
I love it how u ride it like a harley
You love it when I'm kissing yo body
I love it when u start calling me papi
I love it when u act so naughty
I stay kissing on yo neck
Cuz it always get you wet
Roses are nice
Violets are fine
Iâ€™ll be the six
If you be the nine
