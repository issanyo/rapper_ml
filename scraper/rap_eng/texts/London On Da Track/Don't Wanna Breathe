[Intro]
You see, it's crazy, dog, 'cause
You give a nigga this emotion that
I thought ain't even exist in a nigga no more
See, like, I don't even wanna be, if I can't be with you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you

[Verse 1]
You know you make me new
You motivate me too
I'm fucking with you, boo
Imma keep it funky with you, boo
When we make love, I ain't got my glove on
When we make love, I ain't got my thug on
Girl, you got me singing love songs
Where the fuck I get this love from?
I got London on the beat
She like fucking on the beach
Girl, you fucking with a G
How did you end up with me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you

[Verse 2]
Look what you did to a boss, babe
You got me nailed to the cross, babe
You got a young nigga open
You got my nose wide open
You got lil' Kodak in a moment
I was locked up sending you roses
And, baby, when I ride, I wanna ride for you
And, baby, when I die, I wanna die with you
Girl, you know Imma keep it a stack, like a thousand dollars, boo
Girl, you know Imma keep all this stack, I'd never lie to you
Ain't no point in living, If I can't live my life with you
Girl, If you ain't right by my side, I don't know what Imma do

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you
