[Hook: Derez De'Shon]
Had a dream I been on top, woke up on the floor
Wake up, do the same thing e'ryday, same as before
No food in the cabinet, just pistols and dope
And this ain't the life I chose, but this the life that chose me
Had a dream I been on top, woke up on the floor
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Wake up, do the same thing e'ryday, same as before
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
No food in the cabinet, just pistols and dope
This ain't the life I chose, but this the life that chose me
Wa-wa-wake up, do the same thing e'ryday, same as before
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
This ain't the life I chose, but this the life that chose me
No food in the cabinet, just pistols and dope
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
Had a dream I been on top, woke up on the floor
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)

[Verse 1: Chris Rivers]
Uh five years old with the Cadi'
All up in the green like a caddy
Over to my daddy
Strapped like baggy
All you ever pull was a hammy
Pop before Grammy stunt with my grammy, that's true!
Iced out wrist like I sprang my shit, like I pay my dues
Niggas wanna take my shit like it ain't my shit
Like they hate my shit, like it ain't my crew, nigga please!
Momma was strapped, poppa was strapped
Everybody strapped Levi go into class
Chevy red drop top, stereo Glock box
Chevy gon' non-stop flow with the cash
Stunting in our credentials
Tomer then breakfast, continental
You know we got the glow, it ain't confidential
The god wanna take my pops in mental
It's like that

[Verse 2: Chris Rivers]
Uh, fifteen on a shelter floor
You ever been to hell before?
You ever was so hungry in the winter with the cold
And you planned to act up to try to go to jail before?
Woah! There's drugs in the kitchen, momma
There's love and ambition, momma
These bugs on a mission momma
Light switch, gotta plug, I'ma flip it momma
Went from rags to riches to rags
Just look at his pants, just look how they sag
Yeah, they was hand-me-down
Chillin' with granny now
You ain't forgotten to mention my dad
Sisters in kitchens they filling the bags
Yeah, they were whipping like drifting the Jags
Serious talks 'bout givin' their bags to me
Gripping the gat but I ended up spitting the raps, like that
