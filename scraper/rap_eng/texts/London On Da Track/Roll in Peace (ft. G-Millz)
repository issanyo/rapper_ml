Verse 1 [B7shop]:

Yo, yo

Got a lot going on in my life now
So much shit going down in the mind now
[Everybody wanna fight left and right now was the original line, but here's the original:]
Think I'm shit? Man you gon' fucking find out
Now you better shut the fuck up and it's time now

I got the bars that'll leave a rapper burnt out
Y'all better run because it be making me burst out
Y'all motherfuckers make me shout
But I'ma show you motherfuckers how I let it all out now

Sit and crash
Bitch, relax!
Lemme just spit the facts
The game is trash

I'm 'bout to kill this motherfucker
Leave the game with an impact
Everybody knows that B7shop's the best artifact

I ain't even in my prime like a negative that subtracts
The life from you motherfuckers like a fucking riot act
Comin' at me then you'll see that you have been attacked
By the Bishop and Masi, Punxsutawney is where we at

BMP represent, we killin' this shit!
You can't dismiss the shit I spit 'cause I be making you quit
Kill it right now

Lights out!
Everybody screaming like I died now
When I be switching the flow the rappers lookin' at me like a ghost will arise now
Fly now
B7shop been killin' it, 'bout time that the views getting high now

Verse 2 [G-Millz]:

I can't even Roll in Peace
Listen all you other motherfuckers
I'm the only king, I'm a cold emcee
I got the coldest feet

Ice skating over frozen seas
Like a roller rink so I Roll in Deep
From the other side, say "Hello!" like Adele
Being alone in my cell, took control of my mental health

Well, I should go and get help
But I don't feel too well
And I'm losing control
Get me out of this cell

I could just snap, no going back
My flow joke is cracked
You can smoke it and wouldn't know how to act

I leave 3rd-degree burns all over the mic
So blacker than cold, hearts colder than ice
Got my back against the wall, so I roll to my right

What's a [pistol] to a knife?
What's a midget to a giant?
Military mind and we weren't ready to riot
Killer's moving silent, so you better be quiet

Every time I write
And by pen bursts into flames
And the paper catches fire
That's more gas to siphon

Pour it in the back with every rap that I wrote
Light it on fire, blow up half the globe
They like "Woah

Gage, you the G.O.A.T!"
I'm not even in my prime and I got time to grow

I created a foundation of solid
One that Superman couldn't demolish
Hulk couldn't smash one of our walls in
Flow's so progressive in architect and knowledge

All have sure enough denied it
Look me in the eyes and my face when I'm talking

I'm all about respect, got to give it to get it
So stand for what you represent
I'll kill for mine, I'd ride for them, I'd die for this
Rep BMP 'till I D-I-E like its life or death
It's do or die, I'm not dying yet

I stay devoted to the rhyming and the time I give
All my time is spent
Killing you, will to survive, 'til you 'cide to end your life
Ha, suicide's a BITCH
