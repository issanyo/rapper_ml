{​​Hook Lil Rian & Rx Gwapp}​​
All I see is green (All I see is Green)
All I see is green (Thats all I see)
Red light red light ayyee
Tell them niggas stop hating (Fuck nigga quit hatin)
Green light Green light ayee
She said proceed wit it (Go head)
So i go wit it homie and my name is all she scream
All I see Green  (Repeat)

{​​Verse 1: Lil Rian}​​
Niggas they be hatin on me
But truth is thats the norm
Everything that i got is all foreign
Foreign bitch foreign car
Haa ralph lauren
If my bloods gotta problem
Im in the cut like neosporin
Finna put yo ass to sleep where you can't hear alarms
Girls numbers i be storing
But when they call im ignoring
And my life is a movie and alot of porn (Thats How I Do It)
Thats what i deal
Thats on sum real shit
Big boy meals yall on sum kiddie shit
Just feed me shit
On sum needy shit
Rivals on sum tryna be little rian shit
But i can't blame you though
Nowadays people try to make they ratings soar
Green ona floor
Green ona couch
Green make her dance
Green for the south
Red light for them boys
Still hating
They surprised i would make it
Talking bad on my back but turn around when they see our faces
Confrontation turn to chases
All i see is green
Fuck every race im a racist
Pussy for breakfast and rappers for dinner (woo)
My nigga my nigga
Im a hooded young grammy winner
But i got pounds
Dont believe on getting fit now
This enough to tax everyone in my home town

{​​Hook}​​

{​​Verse 2: Rx Gwapp }​​
Real niggas on my team
Let me smile let my mouth bling bling
Eveything ain't what it seem
But we all gettin gwapp ching ching
Bitches be talking that non sense
You might just get mushed
Get the fuck out my face
I just be whippin
Got dope in my place
These drugs got me rollin but im not on skates
Open yo gate
You can take me to yo rocket and blast off to space
And i just get cake
You other niggas is broke and i can not relate
You can keep hating
Favorite color green
Stacks frowning but they still not mean
I just got it tatted on a nigga in a sleeve
I dont see no other color
So im gettin green
Yea im gettin green
