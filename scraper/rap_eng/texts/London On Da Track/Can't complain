[Intro]
HAZE
(huh oh , ya ya
Gang wait  ya ya ya
Ya loyal gang or no gang )

[Chorus]
Gotta  keep a strap just to know a n*gga safe
Hit it from the back  no your hoe ain't safe
Ima eat these tracks like they served em on a plate n*gga sit back no
You can't use my face card
Most these n*ggas whack no I can't relate you was tryna criss cross I stayed in my lane and I know I'm going far I cannot complain
Listen I adapted to my fears and made em strengths

[Verse 1]
I just had to stack up all my digits and maintain if you moving funny ima move right out the way
I jus wanna new chain get my girl the same cuz she stayed down and she never changed
Speaking on my name better watch your language
In it for the fame nah I want the payments
Switching up the game n*igga steady changing
Yall niggas sound the same I know tht flow and where it came from
Boy you is a hoe just go back to where you came from
She gon gimme throat on a boat while its raining
Moving kinda slow its the act tht I'm dranking she jus wanna know whats on my mind and what I'm thinking

[Chorus]
Gotta  keep a strap just to know a n*gga safe
Hit it from the back  no your hoe ain't safe
Ima eat these tracks like they served em on a plate n*gga sit back no
You can't use my face card
Most these n*ggas whack no I can't relate you was tryna criss cross I stayed in my lane and I know I'm going far I cannot complain
Listen I adapted to my fears and made em strengths

[Verse 2]
Don't know the time put the rollie up
I waited my turn no more holding up
N*ggas slept on me like what the f*ck
Nights like this ima run it up
She drank my kids like a seven up
I been going to long ain't no letting up
I was on my ass choose to get it up
Gotta chase that cash get my cheddar up
Know tht shit with me etc
F*ck your opinion me by myself is the difference live in this world full of sin and sh*t so that's why a n*gga act ignorant
I got all this money to spend this Sh*t don't care bout no problems that come with it
And lately a n*gga been bundling knots falling outta my pockets they stumbling chewing these beans I been up nsh*t
Base this off work don't need luck with it young nigga stayed down yea I'm stuck with it finna cross this sh*t off my bucket list I told all these n*ggas id make it hope they ain't think I was playing put in this work on a daily now she wanna have all my babies

[Chorus]
Gotta  keep a strap just to know a n*gga safe
Hit it from the back  no your hoe ain't safe
Ima eat these tracks like they served em on a plate n*gga sit back no
You can't use my face card
Most these n*ggas whack no I can't relate you was tryna criss cross I stayed in my lane and I know I'm going far I cannot complain
Listen I adapted to my fears and made em strengths
