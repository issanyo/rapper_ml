[Verse]

I got so many things all up in my plate, make a young boy feel obese
Do it I save no piece
Rippin' through all my peers like a goddamn beast
Ain’t no fuckin' with me
You can't lil bro me young boy always been an OG
Only motherfuckers I need been me, myself, and I, shit’s easy no "G"
Do the dash when I fly by
All my enemies stressin', they sad guys
I do not give a fuck if I'm harsh with it
That's just how this shit works and I'm used to it
Humbled homie when I'm talkin' to 'em but a cocky killer when I’m out here spittin’
I be like Rocky Balboa, gon' fuck up the competition, there ain’t no quittin'
Do this myself, there ain't no Quentins
Dopest from my side, ain't no question
Do this shit my way, zoomin’ doin' one-fifty on a highway, dat way, Northside, 'til I drop down and I fuckin' die
If you talkin' illest I'm that fuckin' guy
Come fuck with me 'fore I go worldwide
Young Frankie

Too fucking cocky baby, I'm so fucking cocky
Too fucking cocky baby, I'm so fucking cocky
Too fucking cocky baby, I'm so fucking cocky
(Too fucking cocky baby I feel like I'm Rock-Rock-)
