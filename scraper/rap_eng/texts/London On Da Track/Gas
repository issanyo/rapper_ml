[Verse 1: Skooly]
My partner stuck behind the wall so he taking work
I found a plug inside the wall so I make it work
I know that’s one hell of a fall if you face it first
So don’t make it worse, try to make it work, take your Perc
We in the club with the Act, we had to sneak out the back
I got your bitch in the back, I’m tryna beat down her back
I feel like a phantom, I hop in the Phantom, the camera it see out the back
She got the goodies like Ciara, she see me counting, it be [?]
You pussy niggas need ER
Oops, I done killed all the DRs
You pussy niggas need tiaras, came a long way from the Miata
I bought my mama a Fiat, it’s good on gas
I’m in the hood on gas

[Hook: 2 Chainz][x2]
Gas gas gas gas gas gas
Gas gas gas gas gas gas
Chilling at the moment
Winning at the moment
Women at the moment
Who with me at the moment?

[Verse 2:Skooly]
They screaming out Skooly in the bleachers
Might as well call me a teacher
These niggas scared to do features
How much for a feature?
Look, you might just pay him a 40
But that nigga spit like a 40
See you can just give me a ten
I’mma spit like an FN
I promise these niggas ain’t none of my friends
My flow is never gon’ end
I’m in this shit till the end
I never slip up again
Now look, I hope I never acquire the fucking desire to ever go fucking retire
I want this shit here forever
I want them diamonds and bezels
And all of you niggas that didn’t put the effort
Look right back at me and left me
I know you’re gonna regret it
I promise you’re gonna regret it
I come in this bitch like it’s Belly
To take my shit back, hope you ready
And hop in the Jag, and give it some gas
And hand you the gas, you might need a mask

[Hook: 2 Chainz][x2]
Gas gas gas gas gas gas
Gas gas gas gas gas gas
Chilling at the moment
Winning at the moment
Women at the moment
Who with me at the moment?
