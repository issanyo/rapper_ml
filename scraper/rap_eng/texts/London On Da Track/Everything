[Verse 1]
I got a past you got a past too
I got a past you got a past too
But let's make it last, let's make it last through
Let's make it last, let's make it last through
I took the baggage from the last dude
I took the baggage from the last dude
You did your dirt, I did my dirt too
I did my dirt on you

[Pré-Chorus]
New year, new everything, except you
The old girl so irrelevant and that's true (so true)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
You're my everything
And without you, I'm nothing
Nothing, nothing, yeah
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything

[Verse 2]
Oh, pick up the phone, baby
Tell me you're home, baby
I got some smoke, baby
I know what you need, yeah, yeah
I'm begging you, please
Come and see me, baby
All the chicks on the side
All the things you despise
Oh, I'm done

[Pré-Chorus]
New year, new everything, except you
I'm done
New year, new everything, except you
The old girl so irrelevant and that's true
Yeah

[Chorus]
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
You're my everything
And without you, I'm nothing
Nothing, nothing, yeah
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything

[Bridge]
Act like you knew me
I walk a million miles, a million times, girl
Million times for you
No more lies
No more cheating
No more sleekness
No more staying out at night

[Outro x3]
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
Listen to me bae when I say you're my everything
You're my everything
