Okay, I'm reloaded

[Hook: Young Thug & Young Scooter]
One thing about me
I'm married to the streets I give a damn what you say about me
One thing about me let me jugg

One thing about me, yeah I'mma run my money up
One thing about me, yeah I'mma fuck her when I fuck
One thing about me, one thing about me, thing about me

[Verse 1: Young Scooter & Young Thug]
I'm in that Masi I feel like a spider
G5 jets when we flyin
I'm super high feel like I'm a pilot
Backseat of the Maybach, me and Thug countin'
I done made a half million off of mixtapes
I done made a whole million on my mixtapes
Nigga playing with the Act', Perc, bust his grapes
I'm on time with the pack nigga I'm never late

Flying packs to Lil Mexico from LA

And I got bricks and bales, wraps of option
Try pull up for a nigga one thing might meet me nigga
I'm finessing and juggin' these fake street niggas
I got Scooter straight up out of the streets on BET
Thugger, Thugger dirty young nigga he just like me
Birdies and Audis, Scooter with me
Open my door with a phone I don't need no key
Begets and VVS inside of my neck and wrist
Real diamonds, 100 karats, bling bling
