[Intro]
Glee! Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm in London, got my beat from London

[Hook]
Every time I like a bih, I find out she a gnat
Somebody call the vet, my dog turned out to be a rat
I'ma slick pimp, got a sixth sense
Ho, you ain't a dime, you just six cents
I be on them beans, she be on codeine
All I want is money, all she want is me
She just wanna be loved, she just wanna be pleased
All I want is money, all she want is me
(All I want is money, all she want is me)
(All I want is money, all she want is me)

[Verse 1]
Say I'm so selfish, all I think about is fetty
I can't settle down, somethin' just won't let me
I want to settle down, well maybe I ain't ready
Bae, I'm livin' reckless, and I'm thuggin' heavy
In love with the skreets, and I'm in too deep
I be tryna leave, it keep control of me
It got my heart, got my mind, it got my physique
She wanna wake up with my wand and put that ass to sleep
I don't bleed Kool-Aid, baby, I bleed concrete
I ask God to give me wisdom, help me spot a leech
I be talkin' money, tell that ho; "kapeesh"
Tell that ho to sheesh, love is for the weak

[Hook]
Every time I like a bih, I find out she a gnat

All I want is money, all she want is me
She just wanna be loved, she just wanna be please
All I want is money, all she want is me
(All I want is money, all she want is me)
(All I want is money, all she want is me)

[Verse 2]
I'm ziggied up, 26, 13, 6
I'm a seven figure nigga, remember when I had six
I'm a seven figure nigga, remember I ain't have shit
Even though I'm rich, can't forget that I was hittin' licks
All I want is that, all she want is this
I just wanna hit, but I just wanna hit
What be on your mind when it come to this?
Why you close your eyes every time we kiss?
I'ma keep it pimpin', I'ma keep on livin'
And keep on catchin' flights
And never catchin' feelin's
I'ma keep it simple, I'ma keep poppin' flo-rhythm
I like when I'm with ya
But I love gettin' scrilla
