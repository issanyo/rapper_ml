[Intro]
Boosie Badazz
Real lifestyle, nigga
Uncut and explicit
Straight up

[Chorus]
Lord knows, these bitch niggas couldn't live my cold lifestyle
If you really knew Boosie boo, then you would run right now
(Pussy ass niggas)
Sick of all of these niggas saying that they gangsters
(damn right)
(damn right)
We don't rap beef like y'all rap beef, believe me, we spank ya

[Verse 1]
What you know 'bout riding strapped in a drop top
Finger on the trigger in the rearview Glock hot
Nigga tryna snatch ya girl from the hair spot (cold)
Fighting extortion from the narcotics
Hitters on the backseat and them thangs cocked (cold)
Burning niggas homes 'til they run out
At the graveyard watching my homeboys
Momma cried tears so you know that it's on, boy

Picture perfect ain't the word for this lifestyle
Loan sharking niggas, that don't deserve to live this lifestyle
Penitentiary chances on the daily
Shootouts every week, shit deep, God saved me
Going to war for the same niggas that betrayed me
Attutude real rude, fuck you pay me
In
Louisiana where the streets ain't gravy
Yeah, I'll lay down anybody just to live like Baby

[Chorus]
Lord knows, these bitch niggas couldn't live my cold lifestyle
If you really knew Boosie boo, then you would run right now
(Pussy ass niggas)
Sick of all of these niggas saying that they gangsters
(damn right)
(damn right)
We don't rap beef like y'all rap beef, believe me, we spank ya

[Verse 2]
Sickest clique ever did it, we don't talk shit
How I live, a gun a part of my outfit
Take a pick, replace the six with the soda
It's a front so if the nigga complain, game over
Y'all live a rap lifestyle, mine colder
One of the few you could believe what they told you
All day stalking, we click clacking
Studying niggas moves it's cool, send a bitch at 'em
F.N rip a nigga til' holla'
Crime scene lost cause they thinking it's a choppa
Real homework and I ain't talking 'bout a scholar
Jump out sick, when I'm worth a million dollars
Living like this, then you got a million problems
In and out of courts, beefin' with your baby momma's
You want beef? Then that beef shit we got it
Whole clique murder ones, but we walk cause we solid

[Chorus]
Lord knows, these bitch niggas couldn't live my cold lifestyle
If you really knew Boosie boo, then you would run right now
(Pussy ass niggas)
Sick of all of these niggas saying that they gangsters
(damn right)
(damn right)
We don't rap beef like y'all rap beef, believe me, we spank ya

[Verse 3]
Making niggas pay draft, this is real talk
Wink my eye, have you gone
A real boss
Thugging hard in Angola, on that real walk
Every nigga I done beefed wit had a big heart
Evil, the same place I see ya I leave ya
Going in niggas pockets, on GP [?]
Hit the club after I bleed you to tease you
Everybody strapped to the max, even Nita
Shit, taking niggas chains off they neck
Want it back? Then I gotta get a check
On Plank Road and they rip out the vet
Glock on the dresser everytime I have sex
Swerving down niggas block, vest up
Auntie telling me to change cause I'm living messed up (straight up)
Fuck rain, this is thunder mane
Director stole my script for the Hunger Games (Boosie)

[Chorus]
Lord knows, these bitch niggas couldn't live my cold lifestyle
If you really knew Boosie boo, then you would run right now
(Pussy ass niggas)
Sick of all of these niggas saying that they gangsters
(damn right)
(damn right)
We don't rap beef like y'all rap beef, believe me, we spank ya
