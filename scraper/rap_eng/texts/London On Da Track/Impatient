[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Know your city, what you're used to
Know I ain't exactly what you're used to
Know you're prolly worried what I'm used to
I don't blame you, what you s'posed do?
Last time we fucked like it was all night
Now you got me thinkin' 'bout you all night
Me and you, seemed like it'd be alright
Long as we can keep it all night

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Cup full, yeah I'm on
Poured up, she ready
Leave here, too on
Tell me where I'm headed
Tree leaf, a little O
You know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that
Come here, I'm down with it
I, can't
I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Still dippin' through the city with the top down
Shawty got that show-me-what-you-'bout-now
I ain't waitin' for tonight, I'm talkin' right now
Still know my way right with the lights down
Set it down every time you go low
Ain't nobody worried if we on it solo
You know when we creepin' it be alright
I kill it 'til you say it's all mine

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Know your city, what you're used to
Know I ain't exactly what you're used to
Know you're prolly worried what I'm used to
I don't blame you, what you s'posed do?
Last time we fucked like it was all night
Now you got me thinkin' 'bout you all night
Me and you, seemed like it'd be alright
Long as we can keep it all night

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Cup full, yeah I'm on
Poured up, she ready
Leave here, too on
Tell me where I'm headed
Tree leaf, a little O
You know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that
Come here, I'm down with it
I, can't
I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Told her ‘Bae I’m ready. Bae I want it
I can go all the way until the mornin'
We could do all different type of positions
I'ma have you suckin' on my fingers while I hit it
From the back, you like it like that
I know 50 different ways to make you climax
You got the flavored oil, girl you nasty
Rubbin' lotion on you, you ain't even ashy
Tryna get you to the room and take you down
Come give it to a thug, give it to a real one

[Chorus: Jeremih & (Ty Dolla $ign)]
Cup full, yeah I'm on
Poured up, she ready (Yeah she ready)
Leave here, too on (On)
Tell me where I'm headed (Where I'm headed)
Tree leaf, a little O (Little O)
You know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that (Oh yeah)
Come here, I'm down with it (Yeah)
I, can't
I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no
