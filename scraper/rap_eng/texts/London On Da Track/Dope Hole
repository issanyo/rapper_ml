[Chorus: Derez De'shon]
I came up out the dope hole, scrapin' that dope bowl
Keep it for the low low, robbing's a no-no
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me, 'cause I keep it on me
Diamonds dancin' like it's go-go
Trap jumpin' like it's pogo
Probably spend the night with your ho
Spendin' new money on the old ho
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me
'Cause I keep it on me, better know that it's on me

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Hundred young niggas in the trenches
Burglar bars on all the windows
Got it cookin' dope in the kitchen
Junior make the bitches wash the dishes
Tell 'em scrape the extras out the skillet
Mad men like a fuckin' chemic
Pourin' drank, trying not to spill it
Sack full just like some Christmas
Stripes like Adidas, rather do the Balis
Pushin' all this weight and never been in bed
Nigga overweight and never been embarrased
Pockets out of shape, the bankroll gettin' fatter
Four up in the Fanta, fuckin' up my bladder
Trappin' out a Phantom, catchin' plays in traffic
Saw your favorite rapper juggin' in the bando
Bust him out the wrapper

[Chorus: Derez De'shon]
I came up out the dope hole, scrapin' that dope bowl
Keep it for the low low, robbing's a no-no
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me, 'cause I keep it on me
Diamonds dancin' like it's go-go
Trap jumpin' like it's pogo
Probably spend the night with your ho
Spendin' new money on the old ho
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me
'Cause I keep it on me, better know that it's on me

[Verse 2: O.T. Genasis]
Hundred thousand cash in the duffel
Heavyweight, yeah I keep the muscle
All these squares, I ain't talkin' puzzle
Squeeze the trigger like I'm tryna cuddle
Three point five in the zip, MCM bag hold the brick
Chain and watch dancin' like a bitch, double R lookin' like a lick
Coca coca got me loca loca
Still hatin', c√°llate la boca
I'ma send a hit, Sammy Sosa
Whip small, put it in a Rover
Heat for niggas like you, yeah
And your whole motherfuckin' crew, baow
Put the agua in the pot
Keep this shit right by my side

[Chorus: Derez De'shon]
I came up out the dope hole, scrapin' that dope bowl
Keep it for the low low, robbing's a no-no
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me, 'cause I keep it on me
Diamonds dancin' like it's go-go
Trap jumpin' like it's pogo
Probably spend the night with your ho
Spendin' new money on the old ho
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me
'Cause I keep it on me, better know that it's on me

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
Hammer on me, I might have to shoot it
Camera on me, I hate to do it
Dope money got a nigga shinin'
Biggie Smalls got a nigga rhymin'
Lil Yachty think he overrated
If I smacked the nigga y'all gon' think I'm hatin'
Big chain, no gold teeth
Can't remember havin' no beef
This year me and my niggas shot more niggas than the police
Pulled off in the Maserati
With a shooter that just caught a body
With a freak bitch, she don't eat shit
She just want me to feed her molly
Got caught too, sniffin' bitch
I don't love you, I'm different bitch

[Chorus: Derez De'shon]
I came up out the dope hole, scrapin' that dope bowl
Keep it for the low low, robbing's a no-no
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me, 'cause I keep it on me
Diamonds dancin' like it's go-go
Trap jumpin' like it's pogo
Probably spend the night with your ho
Spendin' new money on the old ho
'Cause I keep it on me, I keep it on me
'Cause I keep it on me, better know that it's on me
