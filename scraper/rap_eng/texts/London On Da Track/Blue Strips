[Intro]
Yeah
Thought about it, did it
Wanted it, bought it
Haha, yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I just ordered a coupe, it came in late
Three hundred thousand in trash straight out the safe, yeah
Extraterrestrial, yeah diamonds from outer space
El Chapo hit my line, say them things on the way
Droppin' 'em off baby, hit 'em with all flavor
Bundles in wallpaper, money in crawlspaces
Me and the small faces, stackin' that tall paper
Condos in Las Vegas, exotic malls baby, what's a red bottom
You ain't never seen these, took the rag off
Still posin' for the camera while the feds watching
Every night I make a movie, watch me Redbox it
Magic City money, Big Meech ballin', yeah

[Chorus]
Blue strip, blue strip, blue strip, blue strip
Nigga bag full of blue strip, blue strips, blue strips, blue strips
Nigga bag full of blue strip, blue strip, blue strip, blue strip
Nigga bag full of blue strip, blue strips, blue strips
Yeah, yeah, nigga bag full of

[Verse 2]
House full of dogfood, no munch
Bales in the mail, UPS truck
Ice cream, Blue Bell, whipped up
Cough syrup, no cold, scripted up
Ayy, blue strips, got a sixty on me now, know a few crips
Bleu DaVinci with me now, I caught a new whip
I got 'em checkin' for me now but where was you at?
You was nowhere to be found
Hundred thousand dollars in ones on the way baby
All that ass, I'm tryna touch, see if it's fake baby
I'm tryna fuck, don't want to talk, no Ricki Lake
They fuck you different when you havin' your own way

[Chorus]
Nigga bag full of blue strip, blue strip, blue strip, blue strip
Nigga bag full of blue strip, blue strips, blue strips, blue strips
Nigga bag full of blue strip, blue strip, blue strip, blue strip
Nigga bag full of blue strip, blue strips, blue strips
Nigga bag full of
