I swear I might have seen her out my left eye

[Post-Hook: Fetty Wap]
Baby girl they hatin' you, baby

I know you wanna love, your smile's amazing, yeah

Hit my phone, tell you what you like bae
Ayy and if it's cool, can I spend the night, bae?

And you need somebody to lean on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Nigga I saw, what I seen, what I saw
Lipstick thick hips baby was a boss
Dollars in my pocket I rolls for 11
Godfather to this shit, I’m Russell Simmons
In it, authentic, money I spent it
Split it, baby what a pimp clinic
Choose up or be chosen
Rise like yeast, raised on the east
Best side of the west side of the coast
Getting setty Fetty riding in the white Ghost
Riding through Hollywood
Dogg Pound dick ‘em down
Baby said the flavor good
Put it in her now she yellin’ neighborhood
Cuz you know how these hoes flip
My nigga you know how these hoes get
That’s why I stay fly
And keep a bad bitch from the Westside
Left side

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I think I fell in love with the Westside, baby
Stop playin', girl, what it do, baby
I got time to screw with you, baby
I swear I might have seen her out my left eye

[Post-Hook: Fetty Wap]
Baby girl they hatin' you, baby
'Fore they even knew you, baby
I think I fell in love, your body's crazy, yeah
I know you wanna love, your smile's amazing, yeah
I think I fell in love, your body's crazy, yeah
I know you wanna love, your smile's amazing, yeah

[Outro: Fetty Wap]
Your smile's amazing, yeah
Your smile's amazing, yeah
