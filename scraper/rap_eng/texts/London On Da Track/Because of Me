The way you doing your thang is because of me
The way you rockin your chain is because of me
The way you ridin this thang is because of me
The way I give u propane is because of me
The way I treat you the same is because of me
The way I act like a lame is because of me (x2)
The way I do all my thangs is because of me
The way she ridin that thang is because of me

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Fucked that bitch on the top shelf
Fucked that bitch on the refrigirator
Fucked that bitch on the kitchen floor
Fucked that bitch good, then I ate her (wooo)
Ate the bitch like a baconator

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah, see that a trace they fit nigga
Never saw the new whip nigga
Never saw a bugatti nigga
Till I came up uptown in it
Glady's bar, thats fit nigga
AKs they hit nigga
Third ward high roller, thatâ€™ll take it off of your shoulders
Filthy bout my bricks, bought a mansion with my chips
Bitches know we got it, so they love takin that trip
Yacht niggas, them hella choppers
Pocket filled we never stop em
Blood gang with no rules, nigga
U fuck with us its shit poppin (let that shit breathe fool)
Every time we leave nigga
Bitches now we bleed nigga
Third wall, we go eat
Fuck with us you gone sleep

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
You're so hood baby
Do your thang baby
Rock that chain baby
Get in that stearing and get in that lane baby
File the complaint baby, baby, baby
You look so fuckable, adorable
You look adorable
Get it baby?
You look so daughter-able
You can have my daughter you can have my daughter
I swear to god I'mma spoil her, you know ain't gon court her
I'm a baller, she's a playa like a rare disorder
You might catch me cookin white, now that's that faint odor
(Brrrrr)
(Come here baby)
