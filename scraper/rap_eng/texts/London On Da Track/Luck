[Intro: Kayla Brianna]
So you just gon' keep on lookin' at me and not say nothin'?
We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1: Kayla Brianna]
What you lookin' at, with ya lookin' ass?
Say somethin', baby (speak up)
If you gon' just let me pass, miss your chance
Say somethin', baby (speak up)
All of that flirtin' from across the room
Ain't gon' do us no good (no, no)
Gave you the eye like, "baby come and get it"
Right now, I wish you would

[Refrain: Kayla Brianna]
All the bad boys smokin' that la-la-la (Ayy!)
All the good girls lookin' for Mr. Right (Ayy!)
Gettin' faded, off one tonight
Ayy, ayy
Play your cards right, I might make you mine (Ayy!)
No I ain't got time to be wastin' time (Ayy!)
I need a real one, tell me that you the type
Ayy, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Kayla Brianna]
I gave you my number, baby you should call up
Just give me a vibe that I can never forget
We can party all night, you ain't gotta front, yeah it's alright
Just give me a vibe that I can never forget

[Chorus: Kayla Brianna]
Baby try your lu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uck
Baby try your lu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uck
You should try your lu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uck
Baby try your lu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uck

[Verse 2: Dreezy]
It's Dreezy
I got a bartender body, what you want? I'm at your service
Real cocky, don't be comin' at me nervous
You see them tiger stripes on me like Grambling
We ain't gotta rush, ayy try your luck out like we gamblin'
Pretty bitty in your city litty, throwin' 20's, 50's
Heard that I've been runnin' up the money, I'm like really, really
He say, "I'm 'bout that cash talk, no payphones"
Then how you gon' know if you don't say so?

[Refrain: Kayla Brianna]
All the bad boys smokin' that la-la-la (Ayy!)
All the good girls lookin' for Mr. Right (Ayy!)
Gettin' faded, off one tonight
Ayy, ayy
Play your cards right, I might make you mine (Ayy!)
No I ain't got time to be wastin' time (Ayy!)
I need a real one, tell me that you the type
Ayy, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Kayla Brianna]
I gave you my number, baby you should call up
Just give me a vibe that I can never forget
We can party all night, you ain't gotta front, yeah it's alright
Just give me a vibe that I can never forget

[Chorus: Kayla Brianna]
Baby try your lu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uck
Baby try your lu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uck
You should try your lu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uck
Baby try your lu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-uck

[Verse 3: Kayla Brianna]
And we capture the moment like a Kodak
Baby let me show you that you all that
I could give it to you, give me all that
You need a down ass chick to bring you right back, yeah
I could charm you like medallions
You ain't ever had a [?]
You go 'round and 'round, we go
And I could be your ride or die, solo

[Refrain: Kayla Brianna]
All the bad boys smokin' that la-la-la (Ayy!)
All the good girls lookin' for Mr. Right (Ayy!)
Gettin' faded, off one tonight
Ayy, ayy
Play your cards right, I might make you mine (Ayy!)
No I ain't got time to be wastin' time (Ayy!)
I need a real one, tell me that you the type
Ayy, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Kayla Brianna]
I gave you my number, baby you should call up
Just give me a vibe that I can never forget
We can party all night, you ain't gotta front, yeah it's alright
Just give me a vibe that I can never forget
