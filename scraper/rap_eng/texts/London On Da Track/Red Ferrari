[Refrain]
Most of these girls like to argue
See, I don't really argue (nah)
She's makin' faces while she take this dick
So many real niggas, girl, it's hard to pick (why?)
Girl, turn up like an after party
Girl, turn up like an after party
She said she never drove foreign
So I introduced her to my red Ferrari

Girl, turn up - why don't you pop these pills?
Girl, turn up like an after party
Girl, turn up, let these hoes know
Even though it ain't your concert, turn it to your show
Ooh, girl...
Ooh, girl...
She make Giuseppes look like six inches
Blog sites, TMZ, now they takin' pictures

[Refrain]

Introduced her to that 'Rari, introduced her to my crib
Introduced her to that molly now she's takin' off her shit
Let's get lost in the moment, girl
I'm with it, if you with, say I own it, girl
(I ain't doin' no playin')
Tonight it's all on you
Really, it's on me
I ain't payin' for no pussy
That pussy payin' for me
Put that pussy where I want it, girl
Put that pussy where you want it, girl
Tonight I own it

[Refrain]

(Hold up, hold up) Introduced her to that lifestyle
Girl, you fuckin' with a Gold Member, not no lifestyle
So just play your position, I'mma go crazy in that pussy
While I'm in it, you my witness
I'mma have you sayin' "ooh.."
Ooh, girl...
Ooh, girl...
Almost paid her tuition
My work magic, magician
Make this disappear, she with it
