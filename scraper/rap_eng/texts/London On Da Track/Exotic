[Chorus1: Notes]
I got exotic cars and I got exotic clothes
And I smoke exotic weed and I fuck exotic hoes
Everything I got exotic, everything exotic
Everything I got exotic if its foreign then I got it
Everything I got exotic

[Verse1: Notes]
It's exotic everything I got exotic
Everything I ride exotic I'm on lean this bitch on Molly
I be chillin wit a hoe exotic and u know my flow exotic
Picture perfect can't crop it pussy so wet paddle stroke inside
I stay going somewhere exotic out somewhere in the tropics
Gettin' top nothin' can't top it 'cept gettin' money nigga that's my topic
I be twistin' up something exotic sippin' on something exotic
Nigga tough 'til he get straightened out with that iron ain't that ironic
I be stay gettin' me a check, stay gettin' me respect
Stay gettin me the best smokin' on that shit that relieve my stress
Stay rockin' designer foreign wheel attire
Ass so big when she up in front that's all I see behind her

[Chorus2: Notes]
Everything I got exotic, everything exotic
Everything I got exotic all my bitches all exotic
Everything i got exotic everything exotic
Everything i got exotic if its foreign then I got it
Everything I got exotic
Repeat 1x

[Verse2: Notes]
It's exotic, everything I got exotic
Every chick I pop exotic only thing I like shit she gotta be exotic shit
Everywhere I go exotic, everything I drive exotic
Pull up to the club and the hoes like oh my god look its exotic
It's exotic then I got it, pussy wet I mop it
On my pimp-pole(pimple) pop it throw so much money put the hoe through college
Yea u know I smoke exotic, not exotic dont want it
She give me head like Gina, my dick wassup' like Martin
I be in the club ain't talkin sams, big weight ain't talkin grams
Kill the pussy right on the beach now her outline left chalk in sand
I do this shit like all the time, thinkin' money need all of mind(mine)
I'm on the phone while tony hawk skateboard that's what I call a grind
It's Notes
[Chorus3: Notes]
Repeat
