[Verse 1: Noetic J]

My newest Woman takes care of the morning wood
Pamperin a Nigga like she know she should
She a freak in the sheets on fleek in the hood
They try to bag on the street she keep it movin cause she good
Niggas thirsty for a shot
But can't even afford her a shot
She like patron, hold off the rocks
She about making her moves she efficient less talk
I'm flyin high like a hawk
Liven fast I don't walk hoe
Opening doors that were locked
Had a lotta energies to release that were blocked
Ohhh
I Got crystals I ain't talkin rocks
Sly with my ways something like a fox
Finally found my way out this fuckin box
Society has portrayed it shouldn't be a shock
Running a race we can't afford lose
So excuse the obvious attitude
Shapeshifting like I'm Don Juan
Pablo Escobar con el plán
Eatin mamas holiday flán
High off el Peter Pan
Ignoring text from the ex cause I moved on to my next
Filtered as SPAM
Tuned in to my energies
Inner projected outwards
Crankin up the clarity

[Chrous: Noetic J]

Floating on a new wave mission
Free yourself without permission
Don't you hate being controlled?
You don't listen
Don't you hate being controlled?
You don't listen

[Verse 2: Noetic J]

Miracle catch, I'm throwin Hail Marys
Believing in the mystics, metaphysic fairies
Makin movements unheard like anomalies
Formulating new values, Philosophy
Respond rather than react subconsciously
Love & hate one of the same just polarities
Don't play the victim like a charity
Understand your true worth with sincerity
Bounce back from the low points
Relax puffin on RAW joints
Spliff it up when I need a boost
Fronto loose leaf for a cruise yeah
The universe has a plan for us all
Will you allow yourself to grow & evolve?
Or allow potential to dissolve
I'm the director of my movements like centrioles

[Chorus: Noetic J]

Floating on a new wave mission
Free yourself without permission
Don't you hate being controlled?
You don't listen
Don't you hate being controlled?
You don't listen
