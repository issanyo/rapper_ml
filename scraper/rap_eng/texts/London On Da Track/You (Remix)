[Intro: Jacquees & Birdman]
Stunna Music
High life
Yeah yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Its 2:30 in the mornin'
’Round this time you know we goin' in, yeah
I had to kiss so you don't throw it in, no
But you get crazy when you’re horny

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
I feel like I should be your lover, I should be your friend
All those silly issues made up in your head
Money can pay for your time but it's not love (Yeah)
And love cannot pay for that shit that I bought ya
Swear to God I should be gone, leave you alone, 'cause I

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
I'd rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bull
You (Yeah, babe)
You (Ooh-hoo, yeah)
You, yeah

[Verse: Blueface]
Blueface, baby, yeah, aight
2 A.M, tryna pull up on a late night
Last time that we talked, it went left
Had to pull up just to make right
Benz coupe goin' zoom-zoom
I'm runnin' through all the red lights
Tryin' to get to you
When we vibin’? Said move
I’m getting high, tryin' to keep my cool
I just want you

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
I’d rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bull
You (Yeah, babe)
You (Ooh-hoo, yeah)
You, yeah

[Bridge: Jacquees]
Know you got problems
You got a lot of problems
Know damn well I can solve 'em
You got a lot of problems
Know you got problems

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
I should be your lover, I should be your friend
All those silly issues made up in your head
Money can pay for your time but it's not love
And callin' me back with some shit like, "What up?"
Swear to God I should be gone, leave you alone, but I

[Chorus: Jacquees & Birdman]
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
I’d rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bull (Stunna Music)
You (High life)
You
You
