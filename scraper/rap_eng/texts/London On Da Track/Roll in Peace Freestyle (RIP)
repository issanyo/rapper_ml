[Intro]
Uhuh
Shout out 22Love and all my real niggas, ya know
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah, uh

[Verse]
Niggas on the block
Dodging different ops
My nigga tony, he a bigger homie, he 'gon show me different spots
Met this shorty right around the corner, she was rolling with different thots
Everyday chicken spots
Told her "let's get it pop"
Forget 'bout your nigga I'm 'bout to get bigger then take his spot
Now she wet like vacation spots
Tropical islands, I'm working up for the yacht
While I'm building to be on top
Niggas is salty, they mad their momentum dropped
While we pulling of in the drop
We shaking the game up like NBA, buzzer clocks
There's a baller for every dot
No, I'm not Dwayne Johnson, I'm the fucking Rock
All my niggas is do or die
Word to my nigga Niles, 'cause he knows that I'm showing out
Always up, never down
I might jump in the fucking crowd
Bitch I'm so wavy, I'm planning to fucking drown
In some pussy and money now
I need a hunnid thou' - no, I need a hundred mil'
Need it right fucking now
Got the heart of a lion, I'm still in the jungle now
My niggas is jumping out, for no reason but thuggin' now
Rockstar baby, got me feeling like I'm Thugga now
But I'm Dessy Scott Fitzgerald
Or Dessy Heron, 'cause Dessy gets this thorough
All my niggas from this borough
For the ones that don't see plurals
I'm the feeling when you see murals
In the works in the museums
Understand when you do see him
Understand when you don't see him
I'm the one like the Neo theme
Matrix, bitch play my jam
Now you know who's the fucking man
'Cause shit I'm too clean to
Shake any fucking hands
Fuck beef, I'm about to go fucking ham
'Bout to take all your fucking fans
Off a freestyle
Off a G-style
From a G-star with a cute smile
And a few thou'
With a few broads
Rocking V-files
Bout to feast out
With my Linx out
Need a mink now
Need to pop out in pink style
You can't stop me, I been wild
You can't stop me, I been wild
You can't stop me, I been wild
Wooh!
