[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm screaming baby, yeah
I let the reaper get my soul, oh
Oh, if you know you wanna go, oh
I'm slime whenever you 'posed
Shoot a missile, no toes
Same time, I'm screaming baby, yeah
I let the devil get my soul, oh
Oh, if you know you wanna go, oh
I'm slime whenever you 'posed
Shoot a missile, no toes, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
All the muscles comin' out the hip, tell â€˜em "Off the rip"
I'mma try to hit the pussy nigga in the hip
Pull up and air the shit out, ain't talking no heat but I dip
You tryna show out, in front of a freak, now you the R.I.P
Faygo cream soda my choice, hear it in my voice
Yo' main bitch wanna hear my voice, it make her moist
Hit that cat from the back and watch it make a weird noise
Niggas excited by these bitches, them them weird boys
So many bands in my pockets, I need zippers off clothes
These niggas hiding these bitches, they got zippers on hoes
All of my dogs bangin' red like Clifford
Two bands on my Louis scarf as big as a quiddilt
January to December, I'm screaming baby! Yeah

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm screaming baby, yeah
I let the reaper get my soul, oh
Oh, if you know you wanna go, oh
I'm slime whenever you 'posed
Shoot a missile, no toes
Same time, I'm screaming baby, yeah
I let the devil get my soul, oh
Oh, if you know you wanna go, oh
I'm slime whenever you 'posed
Shoot a missile, no toes, yeah

[Verse 2: Trae the Truth]
Everyone yelling out king
So I tell 'em bow down cause I'm back in this bitch
I ain't never been the one to talk cash shit
Just back my shit, all black my shit
With a bitch that like to take stuff off
That'll dump on niggas if shit jump off
I'mma run up on a nigga till I run him off
No stamp but I swear a nigga send 'em off
I pray I don't end up in Hell
A cell ain't gon' hold me for life
But I know these ho niggas gon' tell
But this chopper gon' make him get right
I know I don't deserve it
Straight up, I just can't swerve it
Broke niggas on my nerves bad
It's beef soon as I serve it
I gotta keep this fire
Just in case these niggas wanna fire me up
I know they don't accept the truth
Can't shut me up, finna wire me up
Never no pressure, fuck a professor
School 'em while I'm in the kitchen
Teaching niggas the measure, this concrete Hell, nigga!

[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm screaming baby, yeah
I let the reaper get my soul, oh
Oh, if you know you wanna go, oh
I'm slime whenever you 'posed
Shoot a missile, no toes
Same time, I'm screaming baby, yeah
I let the devil get my soul, oh
Oh, if you know you wanna go, oh
I'm slime whenever you 'posed
Shoot a missile, no toes, yeah
