[Intro]
Natra
We got London on da Track

[Verse 1]
Pull up real strong, then the kick gone
Man in control, made a ton off of Bitcoin
Left me in the cold, niggas switched on me
For the cash, shoot your ass like a sitcom
Have my young niggas circle the block
I prefer purp on the rocks
Caught by the cops
Know who I am, you do not
She wanna fuck me a lot
She give me top in the parking lot
Bitch we heat the block with them carbons out
These niggas all bark, they just talk a lot
Chopsticks all out the window
Cardi bitch, play 'em like Nintendo
I like you but I wanna fuck your friend though
Knock you out like Kimbo, I’ll pop you like a pimple
Soarin' in the vert, foreign whip go skrrt

[Chorus]
12 get behind me, bitch, I'm smashin’, ah
Tell my brother hit me back another day
Block hot, my bro just caught another case
Trap hot like a sauna, driveway like McDonald's
Bringin' home truckloads
Diamonds gleamin', gettin' high with your ho
Neck, wrist, ice cold, all my diamonds froze
Bitch we slangin' dope, your whole neighborhood know
Ayy, these niggas poppin' up dead
They don't know if it was said (Shut up)
Stay the fuck in the house if you scared
I want a prayer, free my dawgs locked in the feds

[Verse 2]
Draco flip a nigga like gymnastics, let his ass have it
Catch his ass in traffic, it’s tragic
I’ll be shiftin' like, "Oh, that’s a big gun" (Damn)
Drive-by in the hood, that's a hem run
Never goin' broke, no way, my bitch go both ways, hey
These niggas mad for real, they goin' out bad for real, could’ve already had a deal
Old broke ass chopper through the window
Bitch ass nigga poppin' through the pillow
Throw the dope through the fences in Balencis
Oh, I think they wanna know how I'm gettin' it
My uncle trained like a chemist
Get a bag then go get it, oh

[Chorus]
12 get behind me, bitch, I'm smashin', ah
Tell my brother hit me back another day
Block hot, my bro just caught another case
Trap hot like a sauna, driveway like McDonald's
Bringin' home truckloads
Diamonds gleamin', gettin' high with your ho
Neck, wrist, ice cold, all my diamonds froze
Bitch we slangin' dope, your whole neighborhood know
Ayy, these niggas poppin' up dead
They don't know if it was said (Shut up)
Stay the fuck in the house if you scared
I want a prayer, free my dawgs locked in the feds

[Outro]
Neck, wrist, ice cold, all my diamonds froze
Bitch we slangin' dope, your whole neighborhood know
