[Verse 1]
I'm deleting the rules
I'm a fucking mix breed, I need obedience school
See me eating at a table with the greediest fools
Just to showcase what's on my plate using the media's tools
Give me the key to the whole city, we'll paint it red
Maybe you'll focus on the pain instead
I would rather pay the debt and walk through a gallows of hanging cred
Than to let it keep me awake when I lay in bed
But remember what Satan said?
"I'll give you this fame, but in exchange you better change your head"
And that's when Damien became your friend
Told you he'd shelter you from the rain until the days of end
But the end of what he never clarified
Soon as you flopped, washed up and the flare has died
Like the care inside of his heart, he's nowhere to find
Baby, cherish your life 'fore you roll a pair of dice

[Hook]
I know you lookin' for paradise
But you won't find that shit here, no
I know you lookin' for paradise
But you won't find that shit, you ain't gone find that shit here
I know you lookin' for paradise
But you won't find that shit here, Lord no
I know you lookin' for paradise
But you won't find that shit, you ain't gone find that shit

[Verse 2]
I know this girl she got the face of a dream
Raped by false realities by the age of fifteen
And it's a shame 'cause if you're looking in, it ain't what it seems
Nothing containing the rage of a demon
Lord, have mercy 'cause it hurts me to see an angel distracted and so
Manipulated by jaded fiends made her act like a hoe
And even though I spent three years trying to get her back on the road
There comes a point where you just have to let go
But baby, you're way to innocent to see this ugly world in the dark
The hardest part; I love this girl with my heart
I'm torn apart 'cause ain't a single way to help her function
I just get to see the self destruction, but ice melts it's nothing
And it's as simple as that
I don't want it anymore but I just keep going back
Pain and misery, you know the infamous match
You need to cherish your life before you roll a pair of dice

[Hook]
I know you lookin' for paradise
But you won't find that shit here, no
I know you lookin' for paradise
You ain't gone find that shit, you won't find that shit here, no
I know you lookin' for paradise
But you won't find that shit here, Lord no
I know you lookin' for paradise
Girl, you won't find that shit

[Verse 3]
All you'll find is melancholy, in the cellar where I collect all these
Skeletons in the closet now tell me who the hell gon' stop me
I'd sell a pair of Cartier's to Hellen Keller, probably
Fell in opulence, I've been poppin' ever since the devil bought me
Develop copies of a wanted poster
Look at 'em watch for me while I'm on the sofa
You got new loafers, but you sold a pot of gold for a cheap price
Now at what value do you see life?
I mean Christ, a motherfucker could get stuck in it up under these lights, it's seems nice
But once you get sucked in you're suffering from it the gleam dies, don't even try
To collect your thoughts, the records off
Let it hit me like a wrecking ball, I'll set it off
I'm better off with coffins, I'm very nice with a pair of dice
Wishing you a good nightmare while I'm holding your larynx tight
But baby, I been there and back twice
So what's cheaper, the air we breathe or therapy at the fairest price?
