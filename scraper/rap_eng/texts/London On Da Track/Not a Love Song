[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
Yeah
(London on the track, bitch)
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, sheesh
Yeah, it's Eazy
Yeah, this gon' be your favorite song

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
This is not a love song
It's a fuckin' after we leavin' the club song (club song)
This is not a love song
I'm just feelin' on your booty 'cause I want some (want some)
This that tell you what I want and then I get it, yeah
You ain't felt this in a minute
This that pull up on your bumper, put the tip in
I'm just feelin' on your booty 'cause I want some

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
It ain't no coincidence a nigga this wavy
It ain't no coincidence you feeling me, baby
It ain't no coincidence that when I pull up with my whip
It's gon' be the song on the radio playin'
Everybody, everybody know that I'm the man
But you already know that I'm your number one fan
We be makin' love, but tonight I'm on some dog shit
I'm powered up like Austin, I don't know what to call it

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
But this is not a love song
It's a fuckin' after we leavin' the club song (I'm lettin' you know right now)
This is not a love song
I'm just feelin' on your booty 'cause I want some (tonight it's goin' down)
This that tell you what I want and then I get it, yeah (I'ma kill it)
You ain't felt this in a minute (no)
This that pull up on your bumper, put the tip in
I'm just feelin' on your booty 'cause I want some
Get some, yeah
Want some, this is not a love song, not at all, yeah
Get some, yeah
Want some, this ain't got nothing to do with making love
This that tell you what I want and then I get it, yeah (I'ma kill it)
You ain't felt this in a minute (no)
This that pull up on your bumper, put the tip in
I'm just feelin' on your booty 'cause I want some

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
I'm the man, let's go when the door lock
I don't wanna be the number call when the call drop
I'ma be the one to sell the tickets when the tour stop
Ma$e wanna be your go to, you need a sure shot
Ma$e be the one to make you smile when you fed up
Ma$e lay you on the bed, girl, you won't get up
And I can tell you right now if you ain't gettin' this, this a set up
I ain't mad that he did, I fuck you better

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
But this is not a love song
It's a fuckin' after we leavin' the club song (yeah)
This is not a love song
I'm just feelin' on your booty 'cause I want some ('cause I want some)
This that tell you what I want and then I get it, yeah (then I get it)
You ain't felt this in a minute
This that pull up on your bumper, put the tip in
I'm just feelin' on your booty 'cause I want some
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is not a love song, not at all, yeah
Oh, no love song, this ain't got nothing to do with making love
This that tell you what I want and then I get it, yeah (then I get it)
You ain't felt this in a minute
This that pull up on your bumper, put the tip in
I'm just feelin' on your booty 'cause I want some

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
Yeah, this is not a, this is not a love song, love song, love song
This is not a, but it's still gon' be your favorite song, your favorite song, your favorite
This is not a, this is not a love song, love song, love song
This is not a, but it's still gon' be your favorite song, your favorite song, your favorite
It's Eazy
