[Intro]
We got London On Da Track

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]
Diamonds doin' the Macarena (right, yee-haw)
They doin' the Macarena (right, yee-haw)
I cop a foreign an' go paint it (foreign an' go paint it, skrrt)
Ride it like a Power Ranger (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Play with that cash, it's a no-no (cash, a no-no, cash, a no-no)
Playin' 'bout the bag it's a no-no (bag, it's a no-no, no-no)
Yeah the bitch bad, I take her out (woo)
Chanel bag on, let her take it out (woo)

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Gunna]
Tic tock matching the ring (ring)
Every diamond on me bling (diamond on me bling, woo)
DC, fuck you mean (fuck DC, I'm fly)
Every time you see me, I'm clean (every time)
Molly mountain clean (all my Molly clean, Molly)
Purp, the syrup come clean (purp, the syrup come clean)
Old girl like my bling (old girl like my bling)
Buy my old girl some bling
I got the whole world watching me
Suck the dick like Jollys, whee
I'm gettin' cheese, yeah that cottage cheese
I'm just seeing what the eyes can see
I just got a jacket, it's Buscemi like no [?] can see
I just wanna see it ride around like that US army (yeah)
Herm√®s on my boxers, rock the latest Gucci women belt
The snake on it all yee right (right)
Designer shit, I'm fiendin' for it
Drippin' ounces an' I like all my Balmains tight (Balmains tight)
Ring, ring, ring the phone an' you get red bottoms
Head game strong, you must be from down South (whoa, whoa)
Kingpin numbers, I'm not talkin' ringtones
Big bird sippin' Tussy, got me dead now (whoa)
I been drinkin' mud since I was peein' in the bed, whoa (whoa)
Hispanic dope floodin' all the bandos (whoa)
Lookin' at transitions in my mug shots
You can tell I'm gettin' dough (ayy)

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]
Diamonds doin' the Macarena (dan'-dan'-dance)
They doin' the Macarena (dan'-dan'-dance)
I cop a foreign and go paint it (foreign and go paint it)
Ride it like a Power Ranger (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Play with that cash, it's a no-no (cash, a no-no, cash, a no-no, woo)
Playin' 'bout the bag it's a no-no (bag, it's a no-no, bag, no-no, woo)
Yeah the bitch bad, I take her out (baby, I take, I take)
Chanel bag on, let her take it out (Chanel)

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Gunna]
Woop, take that bitch then clean her (cleanse)
Woop, make it hurricane Katrina
Woop, all my diamonds they poisonous (poisonous)
Woop, cause I'm gettin' cake like funnel (cake)
Woop, I just ride a new Bimmer (I just ride a new Bimmer)
Woop, cop a new foreign, no re-runs (cop a new foreign, no re-runs)
Woop, I'm gon' sell out the arena (I'm gon' sell out the arena)
Woop, and I got stripes like a Bengal (I got stripes like a Bengal)
Woop, nigga, don't play about cheetah (nigga, don't play about cheetah)
Woop, I ain't never playin' with a cheater (never playin' with a cheater)
Woop, let a bitch hold that nina (let a bitch hold that an' fire)
Woop, don't get smoked lil' nigga (that red dot)
Ring like the solar, this that ruby red rock (red rock)
I got a Draco for these grumpy bad cops (bad cops)
I got a red flag like I'm a red sock (red sock)
I got some water like I'm on a damn dock
I got a Rollie, bust down, that's a G-Shock (G-Shock)
I had a bankroll inside my lunch box
I point the stick at his feet and make him hop
Your pocket on pancake, like they IHOPs

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gunna]
Diamonds doin' the Macarena (dan'-dan'-dance)
They doin' the Macarena (dan'-dan'-dance)
I cop a foreign and go paint it (foreign and go paint it)
Ride it like a Power Ranger (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Play with that cash, it's a no-no (cash, a no-no, cash, a no-no, woo)
Playin' 'bout the bag it's a no-no (bag, it's a no-no, bag, no-no, woo)
Yeah the bitch bad, I take her out (baby, I take, I take)
Chanel bag on, let her take it out (Chanel)
