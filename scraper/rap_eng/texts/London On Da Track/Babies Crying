[Chorus: Quavo]
Cookin' up babies and whippin' up babies they cryin'
I'm trappin' and cappin' and sellin' the babies no lie
The babies they cryin', the babies they cryin'
Babies they cryin', the babies they cryin'
Babies they cryin', the babies they cryin', the babies they cryin', the babies they cryin' (Gone)

[Ad lib: Quavo]
All these God damn babies man
Pourin' all this lean in the baby bottle
Got lots of babies

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Babies they cryin' I cook and I trap and I bag every dime
These hoes they lyin' they tryna get mine I cook up a brick and I see dollar signs
I pour up the lean
I'm grabbin' my pistol my bitches keep tellin' me Quavo got issues
Sellin' the white like tissue
Leavin' 'em sick like sickle
You look at my niggas I tell 'em to hit you
Pull up on Chaz Gotti whippin' and cookin' up babies
My bitch say she want a Mercedez
Tellin' that hoe that she crazy and go watch your baby (your baby)
All of these babies I need a daycare
I don't got kids I'm cookin' up bricks
Smokin' on gas while you trappin' the [?]
Finessin' the plug Quavo did it again (money)

[Refrain: Chaz Gotti]
My bitch trippin' I put fours inside a baby bottle
My bitch trippin' I put fours inside a baby bottle
My bitch trippin' I put fours inside a baby bottle
My bitch trippin' I put fours inside a baby bottle

[Chorus: Quavo]
Cookin' up babies and whippin' up babies they cryin'
I'm trappin' and cappin' and sellin' the babies no lie
The babies they cryin', the babies they cryin'
Babies they cryin', the babies they cryin'
Babies they cryin', the babies they cryin', the babies they cryin', the babies they cryin' (Gone)

[Verse 2: Chaz Gotti]
Sippin' lean feel offset
They free that young nigga Offset
Bitch wit' me, pussy wet
Playin' round wit' a check
Might take off on that molly cyrus
No tuckin' my chain [?]
Got two niggas wit' me, dos migos
Molly and Hannah Montana trio
Jolly in my Tropicana we slow
Got Actavis all in the peppers
Sippin' on dirty diana
Clip longer than a banana
Whippin' up babies up outta the hamster
They got two bitches one is a dancer
Sippin' on Rudolph playin' with Prancer
Call me [?]

[Refrain: Chaz Gotti]
My bitch trippin' I put fours inside a baby bottle
My bitch trippin' I put fours inside a baby bottle
My bitch trippin' I put fours inside a baby bottle
My bitch trippin' I put fours inside a baby bottle

[Chorus: Quavo]
Cookin' up babies and whippin' up babies they cryin'
I'm trappin' and cappin' and sellin' the babies no lie
The babies they cryin', the babies they cryin'
Babies they cryin', the babies they cryin'
Babies they cryin', the babies they cryin', the babies they cryin', the babies they cryin' (Gone)
Cookin' up babies and whippin' up babies they cryin'
I'm trappin' and cappin' and sellin' the babies no lie
The babies they cryin', the babies they cryin'
Babies they cryin', the babies they cryin'
Babies they cryin', the babies they cryin', the babies they cryin', the babies they cryin' (Gone)
