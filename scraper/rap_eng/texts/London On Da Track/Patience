[Hook]
You've been working all day
Let me ease you out the stress
I ain't trynna hold you down
I'm just trying to have a side of conversation
I see your body and I'm trynna speak that language
And I've been way too patient

You've been working all day
Yeah I'd better understand
Got a good hand on your shoulders
You ain't got to use no hands to educate me
I know your body and I'm trying to stimulate it
And I've been way too patient

[Verse 1]
Ah, I've been way too patient
First weeks in emojis saying that you're down to take it
The second week coming ain't no proof of what you claimin'
And I need that FaceTime
I ain't talking conversations
Spell it out for me on text, ain't no miscommunications
You don't have to call me baby just make sure you call me later
They say nice guys finish last, so I'll let you come first
Give you this from nine to five have you calling off work

[Hook]
You've been working all day
Let me ease you out the stress

And I've been way too patient

You've been working all day
Yeah I'd better understand
Got a good hand on your shoulders
You ain't got to use no hands to educate me
I know your body and I'm trying to stimulate it
And I've been way too patient

[Verse 2]
Trying to get you to the crib for some drinks, no Cosby though
I'm a good dude, I used to watch The Cosby Show
Don't take connecting flights, let me love you nonstop
Fuck your spirit, let's just whiskey that we sip on top the rocks
Why you blowin' out excuses, knowing that we ain't exclusives
Shot clock be running out, just amount was left to do this
They say nice guys finish last, so I'll let you come first
Give you this from nine to five have you calling off work

[Hook]
You've been working all day
Let me ease you out the stress
I ain't trynna hold you down
I'm just trying to have a side of conversation
I see your body and I'm trynna speak that language
And I've been way too patient

You've been working all day
Yeah I'd better understand
Got a good hand on your shoulders
You ain't got to use no hands to educate me
I know your body and I'm trying to stimulate it
And I've been way too patient

[Verse 3]
She asking if I'm up, up, up, up
Girl I've been waiting on you eno-o-o-ough
Don't play with, my patience
Don't play with, my patience
Now she downstairs she coming up, up, up, up
All that patience paying o-o-o-off
Don't play with, my patience
Come over, and take it

[Hook]
