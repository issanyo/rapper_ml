[Verse 1: Juvenile]
I take it, you niggas think I'm a fake
It's all in your face, I can see ya hate
I ain't doing good, I'm doing great
We been living in the ghetto to estates
You a pussy nigga, you ain't gon' relate
But these bitches gon' do what a nigga say
I start with A and then end with a K
I'm home these bitches get in the way
Man, I hunt a nigga down with the choppa
Circle round this whole town like a helicopter
Down for whatever, coke, pounds or whatever
I was raised in a broken house, I know no better
Nigga put in the bag, boy you a fag
I knew my mamma very well, I ain't know my dad
Camouflage rags up in the air
Got some soldiers over here, soldiers over there
Bust a nigga in the club, he need Obamacare
I bet I put you in the grave before your mama there
Peeling off in the Rover ya'll saw me
Got to send ' em shout out to the drunkest young boy
Lil' nigga with a trunk full of narcotic
I got every pill except an antibiotic
''S'' on my chest got me feeling bionic
You can roll a nigga in paper, I'm chronic

[Hook: Young Thug]
H-o-t Boy, ready to d-i-e (on blood!)
H-o-t Boy, nigga catch 'em Hy!-beats
I ain't advertising but you can try hire me
Okay now throw up what you bangin'
If you in the hood, you need to be slangin'
Nigga run it to the top, get the guap
Run it to the top, while y'all flock
Hey, I'm banging red like a Red Sox
Yeah, I'm banging red like a Red Sox

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Pussy nigga it's your time to die, nigga death o'clock
Nigga, nigga I'm heating it's a fed clock
Yeah Juvie, I say yeaaah Juvie

[Verse  2: Young Thug]
Lord Of The Ring my nigga, I'm bleedin' I'm fiendin' my nigga
Hey I'm fiendin' for digits and millions
Nigga smokin' green, racks stacked up like green tree
Living life like my new single, cash out like Charlie Sheen (cash!)
I sell collard greens, spend the profit on jelly beans
You soft nigga, jolly feet, sold many drugs, nigga gotta eat
Sneakin' and geekin', a pull up on weekends, I fuck on the deacon's daughter
The cousin, the bousin, the mother, the father
The Uncle, the aunt, I roll up a blunt
Bring out the remix of Stoner, I call it The Stunt
I won't tell you once, we eatin', we feastin', we lunch, we lunch, we lunch, we lunch, we lunch, we lunch!

[Hook: Young Thug]
H-o-t Boy, ready to d-i-e (on blood!)
H-o-t Boy, nigga catch 'em Hy!-beats
I ain't advertising but you can try me
Okay now throw up what you bangin'
If you in the hood, you need to be slangin'
Nigga run it to the top, get the guap
Run it to the top, while y'all flock
Hey, I'm banging red like a Red Sox
Yeah, I'm banging red like a Red Sox
