[Intro]
Fuck shit happen to fuck people, period
You run up yo bitches and still ain't got money, nigga
Queen shit bitch
You run up yo bitches and still ain't got money, nigga
What the fuck did you expect
(Fuck did you expect)
I'm living life super high, bitch with no regrets
(No regrets)
I will never feel stressed, because I know I'm blessed
(Bitch, I know I'm blessed)
They wanna phase me, but them hoes they do not know my quest
I'm stronger than the rest

[Verse 1]
You never met a bitch like me baby
And we could bet
I could turn a couple words up into a jet
If I said it, then it's true, bitch no flex
I don't care about you, bitch no sex
Fuck, you run up yo bitches and still ain't got money, nigga
You run up yo bitches and still ain't got money, nigga
Aye, you niggas is dummies
This shit is not funny, nigga
You niggas is nothin', nigga
Aye...
You so stupid broke and fuck with Cupid
Last hoe thought I was dreamin'
Showed that bitch is lucid
They don't know what that shit mean
Because these hoes is stupid
Just because I'm Queen Key, that don't mean show yo music
Bitch, fuck yo music
Bitch, I'm fuckin' cruisin'
And you fuckin' losin'
I'm a fuckin' 'buser
Them hoes be like "Key, you so abusive"
Bitch, please
You just ate my pussy to my music
Bitch, and it was no exclusive
You just ate my pussy to some old music
You not the only hoe that ate my pussy to my music
I swear to god that nigga ate my pussy to my music
And he didn't stop, he kept goinnnn'
Aye, I'm like bitch, did we shoot a pornnnn
Aye, turn a hood ass nigga to a muhfuckin' corn
Aye, he love my pussy cause it's warm
I don't know what else to say
I hate his friends, I think they gay
He not my nigga or my boo
And not my bae
But if I want that bitch
I'll have him everyday
I never gave a fuck what anybody say
