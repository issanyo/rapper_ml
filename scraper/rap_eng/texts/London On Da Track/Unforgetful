[Verse 1]
Shawty, you ain't gotta lie to me
You got a nigga on the side, don't you?
You can open up your mind to me
You can open up them thighs to me
But it seems that you fall that way
Always seems to fall that way
'Cause this shit was so hard that way
You still my bitch even when I don't call you that name
12k jet life for that plane
Bape sweats on like 4-5 days
Two shows and I got more to my day
Now you need me what more can I say
To you 'cause I, got shit on my mind
And I'm all down for takin' time
But I'm not gon' let you think that

[Chorus]
I got unforgetful, I got unforgetful
I got unforgetful, I got unforgetful
I never got to tell you
Things I forgot to tell you
I'm not forgetful, I'm not forgetful
I remember the first days
And the worse days and the first dates
I remember the first days
And the worse days and the worse case
The only thing I can't remember is how I got right here in the first place
I remember the, uh yeah, I re-, wait
Don't think that I got forgetful

[Verse 2]
Better have time for me
Bet the next time that I see you
I'ma have somethin' much better than a line for you
Or a rhyme for you
Keep on puttin' you on in all of my songs
'Til you get around to me
Girl, you been down and you stayed around
It's time I put this shit down on you
Let's meet then, baby
Girl, I'm really busy on the weekday
Shawty, be my weekend, lady
Kill the pussy like a horror film
That's what you call freakin', baby
Got some new songs but I heard you like fuckin' to The Weeknd
And we can, get to freakin' in my new motherfuckin' Wraith
And you heard I got the stars in the roof though
Two tone went and got that shit two door
Askin' what the fuck I'm gon' need a new hoe for
When she got the pussy pinker than some nuvo
Hoes like to tell me they love and yeah I might listen
But them hoes ain't worth the time
I be so focused on you, and you know that it's true
And you came at the perfect time sorry if

[Chorus]
I got unforgetful, I got unforgetful
I got unforgetful, I got unforgetful
I never got to tell you
Things I forgot to tell you
I'm not unforgetful, I'm not unforgetful
I remember the first days
And the worse days and the first dates
I remember the first days
And the worse days and the worse case
The only thing I can't remember is how I got right here in the first place
I remember the, uh yeah, I re-, wait
Don't think that I got forgetful
