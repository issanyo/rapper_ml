[Hook]
Girl I see you ain't with the playing
And I can tell from your body language
Let's talk about it
Is you bout it
Let's talk about it
Can we talk about it?
But you ain't gotta say too much
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language

[Verse]
I love the way you keep them J's on deck
Every color so you can't go wrong
Girl your mouth be saying please slow down
But your booty saying turn me on
Put it together Miss Fashion Queen
These hoes wanna be in your spot
Girl you mean everything to me
Come here, let me give them jeans a touch

[Pre-Hook]
And Don't even speak
When you walk by
Girl your energy makes the world rock
And I don't believe
That this'll be the last time that I see you

[Hook]
Girl I see you ain't with the playing
And I can tell from your body language
Let's talk about it
Is you bout it
Let's talk about it
Can we talk about it?
But you ain't gotta say too much
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
