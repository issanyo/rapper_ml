I got London with me now
Hundreds on me, now that dude ceiling
At the top, stack that paper on that pussy
Cause I ain't been broke in a minute
Wake up and take something
Face it, you basic
Be patient like wait bitch

Fuck on my lil ho, her name is Bridget-Bridget

Low life go ape shit
Low life amazing
These them love life pages
