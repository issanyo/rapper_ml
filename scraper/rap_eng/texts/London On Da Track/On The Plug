[Hook x2]
I ain't no drug dealer but I'll fuck with you on the plug, nigga
Hit the club with you, turn up with you, roll up with you
Don't cross me y'all, lit your spot nigga, you a hot nigga
Tryna run up all in my spot, nigga get shot nigga

[Verse 1]
I ain't no drug dealer, but the plug nigga, I hang with him
All these stripper hoes and my young niggas, we came with 'em
I fuck a bitch and you took her out, you in love with her
I can tell you want her cause I seen you all in the club with her
I'm a mud sipper but I fuck strippers cause I'm a big tipper
My white bitch like popping Skittles, my young niggas like toting pistols
My car dirty and my slang dirty, my Sprite dirty
I'm balling hard like James Worthy, my bitch nerdy
She talk dirty but she fuck good
I'm on her female canned goods
Not penthouse, you with the hard one
Bitch pull up, she know what's good
I don't give her money, give her hard wood
Kick game like baby ' told 'em don't pull up if you ain't welcome
Don't ask for it, nigga, I don't sell it
Now tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em

[Hook x2]
I ain't no drug dealer but I'll fuck with you on the plug, nigga

[Verse 2]
Man, don't cross me y'all, lit your spot boy, you a hot boy
Shit, don't play around with my money boy, get shot boy
Shit, we started from that bottom, we at the top boy
We got 100 in that yacht, what do you chop, boy?
I need to seek a service for these presidentials
I'm doing 1-30 down your residential
And I don't sell drugs but I know the plug
Them niggas got drum, they so instrumental
And the blunt got one or two grams in it
Treat your girl like a blunt, I let my fam hit it
And the party got two or three grand in it
Bitch, I'm all about my money, money, money, money

[Hook x2]
I ain't no drug dealer but I'll fuck with you on the plug, nigga

[Verse 3]
On the plug nigga, get your ass in the club nigga
Hundred racks all gone, nigga
Hot boys and my son, nigga

Two Styrofoam, what you think I'm on? Mud, nigga!
I ain't never sleep with my bitch pussy, need big swishers
Trying to run in my spot, hell yeah, you gonna get issues
4-5 right between her eye
You niggas hot like Juvenile
Can't fuck with y'all, phone line getting tapped and all
Kicked the door to y'all trapping on
4 5 for a bag of loud and don't touch it
This is not on your budget, 8 pin and it's so flooded
These niggas too fugazi
I know the plug and we go braze it

[Hook x2]
I ain't no drug dealer but I'll fuck with you on the plug, nigga
Hit the club with you, turn up with you, roll up with you
Don't cross me y'all, lit your spot nigga, you a hot nigga
Tryina run up all in my spot, nigga get shot nigga
