Too many snakes and too many hoes
All these girls I missed out not long ago
Too many people on my timeline gonna overflow
Someone's gotta understand why I ride solo

I need a new chick that gonna treat me right
One that understands why I gotta go at midnight
I need a new chigga that can be by my side
One that if I have a party he for sure gonna slide

Those the kinda people I like
Sitting shotgun going 95 all night
Put the pedal to the floor
No peace no war
That's that shit no one called for
Man
You kinda gotta understand where I come from
Chew me up spit me out call me sour gum
One lick then you quit call me Dum dum
Get hit and played like a steel drum

But I get it you’re just testing me out
“Like is this the one? I wanna know what hes all about”
Like is he up for a date or shall I even hit him up
Am I looking for guy or a stupid hook up

These are the thoughts running through your brain
Feeling hot then cold ice in my veins
Getting love locked heart covered in chains
Girls quit playing games

Man I do too
Don't get me wrong I know what you been through
Feeling love lost grabbing a box of tissue
Screaming “Fuck you Kai wish I didn't meet you”

I need a new chick that gonna treat me right
One that understands why I gotta go at midnight
I need a new chigga that can be by my side
One that if I have party he for sure gonna slide

Those the kinda people I like
Sitting shotgun going 95 all night
Put the pedal to the floor
No peace no war
That's that shit no one called for

ここからは日本語だ
ためしてるだけなのさ　いいかな？
らーめんつけめんぼくいけめん
ちがうとおもうのはぜったいいけへん
でもどうしようもないだろ
なんかいうたってもおなじだろ
なんかい女とつきあっても
全部おなじにおわるよ
かなしい
でもなんか面白い
違う人と会えるから
わかい葉っぱは
むかしのきず
がだんだん消える
まあ面白い

I find it funny
While you sitting there hating I'm just making money
I make music for the people
You tell lies to mess the peaceful
We ain't your mind escape
So shut up and wait on my mixtape
