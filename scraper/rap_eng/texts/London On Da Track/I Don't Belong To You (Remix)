[Intro: Keke Palmer]
I don't belong to you

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
We can keep it on the DL
Hell nah, girl, I'll never tell
You with a new nigga, I'm with my same girl
Mama said we both should be ashamed, girl
Creepin' like we hit a lick
Got you cummin' when I licky lick
Screamin' when I'm deep in it
But still...

[Chorus: Keke Palmer + Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Don't say a word
Keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you

[Post-Chorus: Keke Palmer]
Ain't no white house, ain't no picket fence
Baby you know we don't want the same things
While you're caught up in your feelings
I feel the same as I did yesterday
Baby we've been through this and I feel the same way
I know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe

[Verse 2: DeJ Loaf]
I hate to do it, but
I don't, I don't know why
I put you in this situation knowin' you will
Fall in love with me, but I won't be there to catch you
If it ain't about the sex then I'd prolly neglect you
Don't take it personal, I'm just tryna protect you
I don't checked out, baby come meet me at the register
I know what you want, you wanna be on a pedestal
You wanna be mine, but I can't be more than friends with you

[Chorus: Keke Palmer + DeJ Loaf]
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I will keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I'ma keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
Won't you keep it on the down low?
I don't belong to you
I don't belong to you

[Post-Chorus: Keke Palmer]
Ain't no white house, ain't no picket fence
Baby you know we don't want the same things
While you're caught up in your feelings
I feel the same as I did yesterday
Baby we've been through this and I feel the same way
I know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe
I don't belong to you

[Outro: DeJ Loaf]
You called me last night and I ain't pick up
Why you wanna move fast? I like the small footsteps
Blowin' up my phone, I got the hookup
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love got you shook up
I don't belong to you, I don't belong to you
I said I don't belong to you, I don't belong to you
I don't belong to you, I don't belong to you, yeah
