You can call me Tom Cruise, I wanna wreck your life
Wreck it, red coupe, spaghetti and I check it
Oh yeah, we havin' more fun than Andreas
All white attire like I'm at a weddin'
And I just wanna be like Ox from Belly
Ohhh you push me to the rim
You know I'm your little baby
I'm stackin' bread and it's wheat like Timbs
Fuck a start, bae you know you wanna race but please

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I won't ask her for a chance cause your heart cold
These are little niggas, call 'em tadpoles
You know I want that ass and mouth, so what you ask for?

I get dirty bands like a drug lord
I got lots of spots like a tiger
