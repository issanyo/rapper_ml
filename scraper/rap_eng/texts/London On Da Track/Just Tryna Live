[Intro]
I'm just tryna
I'm just tryna live

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
A nigga in the trenches tryna count a mil
I swear these problems stoppin' me, for real for real
And I swear this money callin' me, for real for real
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live

[Verse 1]
I just want to know why I feel that, for real
All this pain I feel got me poppin' pills
Lost so many partners, this shit can't be real
Woke up with a crick in my neck
A nigga hungry, ain't no breakfast
No pancakes and no eggs
Like jelly, my mind on that bread
I never had shit, woke up on a mattress, dreamin' 'bout a mansion
And a bad bitch, and all I ever wanted was a million
But all I ever got was in my feelings
'Til I pulled up in that new Porsche with the windows tinted
I might pull out that old Rollie 'cause that bitch still glisten
Might go fuck on my old ho 'cause that bitch so pretty
Look at my new ho, can't you tell she a twenty?
I can tell I'm livin'

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
A nigga in the trenches tryna count a mil
I swear these problems stoppin' me, for real for real
And I swear this money callin' me, for real for real
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live

[Verse 2]
I'm just tryna live but this can't be life
It all seems different when you dreamed it, so this can't be right
Remember havin' the same vision, now we changin' sights
Birds of a feather flock together, now we changin' flights
Lost some friends and got new choppers and handguns
Ready to shoot it out, I want the foul, and one
These niggas pussy, grab some tampons
My blunt loud, I thought I heard you niggas sayin' somethin'
I thought I heard these bitches sayin' somethin'
I curve the bullshit like a Samsung
Never asked for much 'cause I ain't never really had none'
Never show me love 'cause you ain't never really had none

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
A nigga in the trenches tryna count a mil
I swear these problems stoppin' me, for real for real
And I swear this money callin' me, for real for real
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live
I'm just tryna live, I'm just tryna live

[Outro]
I just want to know why I feel that, for real
And all I ever wanted was a million
