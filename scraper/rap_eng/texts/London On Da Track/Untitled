[Intro]
We got London On Da Track

[Hook: Tee Grizzley]
Them niggas driving slow, jump in a new lane (get over bro)
This a Bentayga not a Mulsane (the Bentley)
No rachet bitches, [??], this my new gang (don't talk)
Blew a nigga life savings on this coupe, damn
Get her back to the crib, she gon' open up (she open)
That bitch told you she don't smoke, she right here rolling up (we [??])
She suck me off before we left, she ain't hold me up (no cap)
Since I already came, you can't go with us

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
Smoking up biscotti, lungs open up
Jumping in that pussy like it's double dutch (ugh)
Drop a Tracy McGrady in my double cup (double cup)
Hit it with the fork, I beat it upper cut
[??] burn up on they knees (woo)
Frost up in my AP, double it up with Patek Phillipe (Phillipe)
Murder while he sleep like Freddy Kruger, Elm Street (arrgh)
Hundreds like I'm neat (neat)
Fuck 'em by the three (three)
Pockets on Monique (Monique)
We got stripes like referees (stripes)
Shawty so petitie but suck the dick just like a leech (woo)
Moonwalk on the bitch like Billie Jean, Chanel my feet (woo)
My drip is unique hundreds what I seek
Perfect physique, I tape a brick off to your cheek (brick)
Trapping out the bando, we got blow just like a leaf (blow)
Chopper get to eating, biting, we gon' have a feast (argh)
Golden ticket, [??] speak unless it's brief
