[Intro]
I think they must've forgot about who they was dealing with here
I'm going 50 and 0
I got they back on the ropes
Told you that I am not stopping until
I got this industry by the throat
And I won't ever let go, no I won't ever let go

[Verse]
Told all my homies that we finna make it, man all it's gone take is some patience
Bending over backwards tryna make it happen, looking like we in the matrix
Talking to me any ole kinda way, ooh you must've been mistaken
Been knocking hits out the park lately
I'm just tryna cover all my bases
Ain't it funny how the plays double every single time I go and dumb it down
I ain't even going in, two years I been giving y'all the run around
They ain't ready for the real, y'all been putting pill junkies on a pedestal
I don't like doing features cuz honestly I am not tryna embarrass you
I keep it real because everyone phony
I had to go get it all by my lonely
People been telling me that I been changing, these are the people that really don't know me
Same people that was clowning me see me in public and now they all wanna be homies
It's a lotta people going silent every time they see me cuz they know that they owe me
Pay what you owe me
I don't care for these trends, cuz I know that trends die
Ain't no box logo on my chest, ain't no man purse on my side
I don't do that, cuz that's weak
It's just benchwrmrs on my tee
Might be 350's on my feet
All black fit you know who it be, you know who it be

[Outro]
I think they must've forgot about who they was dealing with here
I'm going 50 and 0
I got they back on the ropes
Told you that I am not stopping until
I got this industry by the throat
And I won't ever let go, no I won't ever let go (2x)
