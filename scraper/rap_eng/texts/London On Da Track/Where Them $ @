[Verse 1]
He say he love when I’m drunk cuz I get freaky off the liquor
Im rollin up tha woods like I’m allergic to the swishers
Lil bitch was tryna hate I saw her drive off in a pick up
Ya nigga only see me on the weekend like I’m SZA
Yeah
I need my bread upfront
I spend a hundred like ones
Ain't no broke bitch in my section
Do em like Kobe No passin
Hood but he say its sexy
Threw so much cash she got up
Said Dreezy you a blessing
I just keep on pourin liquor
And I’m VIP’n ignoring niggas
All my bitches with me rollin
Got more smoke than all them niggas
Doors flippin foreign whippin
Whole life had to go and get it
Get you checked you tried to stunt
I got three five in my blunt

Blow it like a fan

Pull up with some bad bitches
Probably brought out a hunnid racks
Niggas try to touch we on yo ass
It ain't none of that

Paper on me Jansport
Pull up in a Transporter
Bitches they don’t like
Cuz I think that I’m so damn important
Red light no camcorder
Put you niggas in order
Fine I’m from the Chi but
Gotta peach like I’m in Atlanta Georgia
Outside like bubblegum
And the insides Peppermint
Louie V with my vetement
And my bezel lookin like two tens
Dope girl like I’m sellin it
Send em off like I’m mailin it
Need Hennessey and my section lit
When I leave countin up presidents

[Chorus]
Where them dollas at
Where them ballers at
Where them callers at
Yeah yeah
Fuck a dolla bill
Where them hundreds at
Blow it like a fan
Yeah Yeah
Where them dollas at
Where them ballers at
Where them callers at

Fuck a dolla bill
Where them hundreds at
Blow it like a fan

[Bridge]
