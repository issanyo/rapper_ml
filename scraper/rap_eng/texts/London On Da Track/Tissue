[Intro]
We got London On Da Track
Fuck nigga

[Hook]
You niggas softer than tissue
You niggas awkward like bitches
You arguin' on Instagram
You niggas typin' on Twitter
And Facebook
Referee, I got the whistle
I just pulled up in that fisker
I just pulled up with my hitters
Referee I got the whistle
I got them choppers and pistols
I got the minivan
I might pull up with them killers
I know my real nigga feel me
Referee I got that whistle

[Verse 1]
I'm Margiela walkin' lil nigga
My bitch, she be stalkin' me nigga
Them rappers were winnin' the race
Till I started hawkin' them niggas
Now I'm drippin' sauce on these niggas
Got your bitch on top of me nigga
Made myself a boss on these niggas
Now I'm livin' like Ross on these niggas
Ridin' round with them K's
Broke niggas love to hate
When ya son turn 10
I'ma make your son a slave
I'ma let him cut my grass
I'ma let him feed my maid
I'ma do it cause his daddy
Always used to player hate

[Hook]
You niggas softer than tissue
You niggas awkward like bitches

Referee, I got the whistle
I just pulled up in that fisker
I just pulled up with my hitters
Referee I got the whistle
I got them choppers and pistols
I got the minivan
I might pull up with them killers
I know my real nigga feel me
Referee I got that whistle

[Verse 2]
You went to jail on a Sunday
The charge is really bout nothin'
Rat your homeboy's house tryna act like you ain't tell nothin'
Sad thing about the nigga
The nigga told on his mama
It was a hot ass winter
Now it's a cold ass summer
I got killers on the front line
My young niggas need a hair line
I can't even lie
That was a cold ass punch line
My bitches settin' niggas up
They givin' me the run down
We be waitin' till the sun down
We be robbin' niggas sometimes

[Hook]
You niggas softer than tissue
You niggas awkward like bitches

I know my real nigga feel me
Referee I got that whistle
