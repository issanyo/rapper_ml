[Intro]
(We got London on the track)

[Hook]
Understand me shawty, they don't want my barbie bitch
I don't know about lil homie, I'm on some other shit
It's a real diamond ring, I bought my mother this
It's a real diamond ring, I bought my chains
All these flashing lights like it's Kodak
It's so cold, where your coat at?
All these flashing lights like it's Kodak
It's so cold, where your coat at?

[Verse 1]
My fridge is so loaded with the groceries
Niggas holding on me, that what you're doing to me
Walk up in your trap, take over your trap
Know I keep that strap, no I ain't going for that
Talk like your bitch is bad, no your bitch ain't bad
Talk like you got swag, no you ain't got swag
Talking favors, you can fall back
When I was young I went and got my ball back
Know you can recall that
20k for a show
Know you wanna hear that crowd sing
You ain't going back and forth
If your son had been on the charts yeah

[Hook]
Understand me shawty, they don't want my barbie bitch
I don't know about lil homie, I'm on some other shit
It's a real diamond ring, I bought my mother this
It's a real diamond ring, I bought my chains
All these flashing lights like it's Kodak
It's so cold, where your coat at?
All these flashing lights like it's Kodak
It's so cold, where your coat at?

[Verse 2]
No matter how niggas feel, gotta count me in this picture
No matter how niggas feel, like bitch I want in
No matter how niggas feel, my kids gotta eat
No matter how big I get, I still won't leave
Free Kodak when you get through
They hating on young individuals
All these flashing lights like it's Kodak
All these niggas round me, yeah they low life
2Pac back, bitch it's thug life
That roof flat back because I'm living life
2k don't you worry bout that bitch
That's not a barbie bitch

[Hook]
Understand me shawty, they don't want my barbie bitch
I don't know about lil homie, I'm on some other shit
It's a real diamond ring, I bought my mother this
It's a real diamond ring, I bought my chains
All these flashing lights like it's Kodak
It's so cold, where your coat at?
All these flashing lights like it's Kodak
It's so cold, where your coat at?
