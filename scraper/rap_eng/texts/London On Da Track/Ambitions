[Intro]
It is what it is
I ain't choose it, shit chose me
South Side, ClayCo, let's get it
We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1]
Remember them days I was broke
All a nigga sold me was some hope
And then them niggas started sellin' dope
Got partners in prison who never spoke
I got a bitch in the hood that's on welfare
Section 8 housing, she let me leave the bales there
She treat me well and you know I take care of her
That dope got a smell, hope the neighbors don't tell
'Bout that life, she ain't scared, ride or die with a player, yeah
I got partners fightin' just to live
Twenty-five to life, he can't appeal
Like a G so you know what it is
When it's gangster it gets real

[Chorus]
You can't deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider, you don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause I got a real ones on my side, I got the hitters on my side
I got the shooters on my side, I got the killers on my side
You can't deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider, you don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause I got a real ones on my side, I got the hitters on my side
I got the shooters on my side, I got the killers on my side

[Verse 2]
In Clay County, I'm a OG like Stunna (Rich Gang, gang)
Hold it down for my uncle, Flocka Flame them my brothers (squad)
Play with us and we bustin' (baow), ain't no arguing and fussin'
End of discussion (shh), pull up on a pussy nigga and squeeze
Make sure he dead 'fore I leave
First you hear the tires screech
Then you hear the forty sneeze
All my shooters hitting like a free-throw
Thirty round, ain't gotta reload
Tryna build the carter like I'm Nino
Brick by brick I fuck with migo
I'm a passer nigga, I'm a rider
Catch your ass in traffic, pull by side you
Let the window down and I'ma fire
It's my ambition as a rider

[Chorus]
You can't deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider, you don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause I got a real ones on my side, I got the hitters on my side
I got the shooters on my side, I got the killers on my side
You can't deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider, you don't wanna fuck with me
'Cause I got a real ones on my side, I got the hitters on my side
I got the shooters on my side, I got the killers on my side

[Outro]
You can't deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider, you don't wanna fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with me
