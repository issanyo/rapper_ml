[Intro: Skooly]
Koooo yea yea
And they know we go crazy
And they don't want no problems (2x)
We got London On Da Track

[Chorus: Skooly]
Now they don't want no problems
But if they want them problems
We go crazy, crazy, crazy
And if they bitches tryna holla
I'ma pass'em to my partners
They go crazy, crazy, crazy
I'm talking bout like
Koo koo koo koo koo koo (2x)

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Strapped like Fu Fu
Try me I go koo koo
I got money by the booku, still boxing all on YouTube
If you snooze, then you lose
Yo bitch my Nu-Nu, and she do what I tell her to
Cause I'm nothing like what she used to
I go crazy, I go loco
Got 5 hoes stuffed in a 4 door
Keep yo dough off the mojo, nigga
And I'm making checks like yolo
I ain't never lying, in nan verse
Had court at 5, ain't nan worse
Ride in nan ambulance, nan hearse
Only way I don't shoot? if it jam first
Pulled up in that, that shit crazy
Right side red flag, that shit crazy
Jewelry on me, that shit swayze
Dunk get ghost like Patrick Swayze
Dunk get ghost like Patrick Swayze
That shit crazy
That shit crazy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Skooly]
They deep, but we deeper
They street, but we street-er
He ain't weak, but me neither
And I still kick shit like FIFA, uhh
But don't mind me, please don't mind me
Cause I been achin' for a nigga to try me
My Brick Squad niggas like 500 hunnid deep
I ain't even lying, better try to keep the peace
33rd niggas still riding with the heat
Going up top make shit get deep
Yea shit get deep, .40 creep and lift his feet
The name is Rich Kidz, but that don't mean that this shit sweet
No candy hoe, no solo life
Shouts out to my loco guys
New shit looking oh so nice
And I know I'm looking oh so fly
Dunk got me hoppin' round the club that's that pogo life
I know one things for certain, all my niggas going home tonight

[Chorus]

DG to the death of me!
Squad!
Dunk Dunk Dunk..
Squad Squad Squad..
