[Intro]
We got London On Da Track

[Chorus]
She wanna be down with me, I wanna be up with her
She ain't no lame hoe, I ain't no fuck nigga
I'd be lying if I said I don't fuck with her
She hold me down so I put up with her

[Verse 1]
Like Milwaukee, I'm 'bout bucks nigga
Don't trust niggas, I got trust issues
Pistol on me, don't get bust nigga
Aflac, you better duck nigga
You looking scared, what's up with you?
That's what she said and I told her I'm ready for whatever she on
She wanna party all night, she ain't going home
Fuck her like I'm mad then put her out in the morn
(Haha, yeah she know what's goin' on)
Took my foot off the brake, tryna do the whole dash while I'm in her (skrrt)
Ride me like a instrumental
I'm a dog, eat her like some kibble
Ooh, I get head and tails like a nickel
I slide up in her like some slippers
Pussy splashin', call her Flipper
Knock her down, holler timber

[Chorus]
She wanna be down with me, I wanna be up with her
She ain't no lame hoe, I ain't no fuck nigga
I'd be lying if I said I don't fuck with her
She hold me down so I put up with her
She, she wanna be down with a nigga
She riding with a nigga
She grind with a nigga, yeah
She, she wanna be down with a nigga
She riding with a nigga
She grind with a nigga, yeah

[Verse 2]
You say you a fun girl, what you mean when you say fun?
I know you don't do drugs but it's okay if you take one
No this ain't no molly, put this roxy on your tongue
Can't give you all of me but I can't wait to give you some
Only here a couple days and I'm tryna get in some trouble
Pussy so wet, look like it's blowing bubbles
Might tell her I love her
Right after I fuck her
Beat the pussy up into a concussion
Back to back to back she bustin'
No cuddle up but I'm cuffin' (damn)

[Chorus]
She wanna be down with me, I wanna be up with her
She ain't no lame hoe, I ain't no fuck nigga
I'd be lying if I said I don't fuck with her
She hold me down so I put up with her
She, she wanna be down with a nigga
She riding with a nigga
She grind with a nigga, yeah
She, she wanna be down with a nigga
She riding with a nigga
She grind with a nigga, yeah
