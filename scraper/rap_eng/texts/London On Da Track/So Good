[Verse 1]
Thugger, thugger
When I first realized that time don't stop (When?)
Is when I had no service for my clock then
And I ran circles round then let it at the top (Big 'ol circles)
They think it's cozy cause it got a leave
These bitches phony for these niggas for no reason (Hey)
I bought Chanel cause they say they know who she be (Hey)
Baby, prepare me, please prepare me for these streets (Hey)
If you believe it, take this devil out my jeans, yah
Don't come standin' 'round unprepared, I'm a big dog
I'm a real G like a pitchfork (Whoo)
Tell lil Dolly that she lit though
Tell lil Dora that she lit though
Fuck a toilet, I'm the shit now, yeah

You make a young nigga leave the hood (Good)

Yeah, I know that we killin' shit (Yeah)
Momma, I know what you was dealin' it (I know it)
Daddy, I know you was sealin' it (I know it)
Big face Rollie can't afford it (Nah)
My teeth are whiter than a toilet (Whoa)
Six rings, nigga Lordan (Hold on)
Cherry wood inside the forest (Skrrt)
Yeah, I'm riding with shorty, shorty (Heeh)
Flood the section with Bacardi-cardi (Racks)
I'm a genie with the smartest smarts (Damn)
Barbie, barbie, baby bottle of barbie (Whoo)
Party party let's forget tomorrow
And I'm eating baby Calamari (Hey)
I hope I see all of you tomorrow, yeah (Hey)
