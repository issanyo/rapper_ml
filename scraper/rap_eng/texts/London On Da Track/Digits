[Intro: Young Thug]
Thugger!  YSL for life
We ran up the digits we ran up the money
We ran up the digits we ran up the money
We ran up some digits..
We got London On Da Track!

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin'
You can lose your life but it gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...

[Chorus: Young Thug]
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up some digits we ran up some money

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'm leanin' like I'm on a 5th of the Henny
I talk lots of shit like my bitches and digits
They didn't know me well so I left 'em with wishes
You know its a drought when you grind and can't flip it
I'm livin' big, I swear to God I'm Liu Kang kickin'
Montana
Mama gon' slime, hustle
Dopeboy, hair grey like a grandma
You know my ice blingin', light up just like a candle
Rollie pollie, I can control shawty like a channel
My racks are squeakin', I'm not fartin'
I hop in that 'Rari, I crank up like Warren

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin'
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...

[Chorus: Young Thug]
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up some digits we ran up some money

[Verse 2: Meek  Mill]
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We run through them bitches, we run through the hundreds
I rolled in the Bentley, I'm talkin' the drama shit
Me and my niggas gon' fuck up the summer, yeah
This summer we puttin' the numbers yeah (check, check)
Feelin' like Meechy, I'm feelin' like Meechy
I jump out that 'Ghini and lift up the door (skrrt, skrrt)
They said they ballin' and we say we ballin'
And somebody please tell me what is the score (balling like Harden on niggas)
Woah, woah, woah, somebody please tell me what is the score
We up by 30, that money is dirty
Them bricks in the ceilin', a mil in the floor

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin'
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...

[Chorus: Young Thug]
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up some digits we ran up some money

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I'ma move me some dope like I'm Future
I'ma go in that bitch with a ruler
I'ma toast me a nigga like Strudels
I'ma keep a red flag cause I'm boolin'
I know some roller spaces, I could dually
Yeah, yeah I'm screamin' oh my god like Cooly
When I snort it, I feel like I must abort it
If I ever die, he better drop his first
I've been gettin' money before the music, fuck Pandora
I just do this shit when I get bored

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin'
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...

[Chorus: Young Thug]
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up some digits we ran up some money

[Outro: Young Thug]
We got London On Da Track!
