[Hook: Young Thug]
Copped that coupe, got rid of the roof like
Up in H town young girls with them booties like
Good head girls have fun with your tip like
I'm smoking on a pound while you're smoking on a zip like
Up in Vegas and I'm stacking up my chips (while you're stacking all your chips)
Diamond corona like I stacked up all the bills (might stack up all the bills)
Cause I know these niggas gonna tell (just made bail)
Can't blame it on 'em man they only being themselves

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Dropping the roof on the coupe
I got some bitches they wanna be fruity
And they know I need 'em all like a [tooly?]
Trae The Truth say that he does and I knew this
Fuck that lil bitch right inside of the movies
Baby don't try to act hard with the coochie
If he a shooter one day he gon' prove it
Lil bitty bit' got big titties they hooters
Your icecream, girl I want your icecream
Her lips big, she's a motherfucking pisces
I will never touch it [unless?] you like it's some white jeans
Them big ole diamonds with no lights they still gon' bright things
I'ma bri-bri-bright it, that pussy wet as a fire hydrant
I know gangsters they can't live without a body
Make that bad bit' suck on my dick just for paparazzi
Tell that bit' to suck this dick â€˜till it boil like a sausage
Money name is [D?] I'll take you overseas
Open sign on baby come and sleep
Get stoned with thugger for the fucking week
[?] for the fucking G

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I got your ho in the back of this foreign
Yeah fucking we got everything going
She 'bout that shit that you see in the movies
No sleeping this chain got me looking like morning
I'm bright as a light while she high as a kite
As she play with the pipe I know something ain't right
When we hit it no fight ain't no telling she might
I just tell her don't bite or it's gon' be goodnight
I was dick sticking she was overdosing
I was tipping slow like I was over coasting
Lead pipe no over boasting
Just wave surfing while I coast the ocean
I am the truth I am not a loser
Just a playa nigga that would like to use you
I might kill it but I never will abuse you
Baby fuck with me or else I might excuse you
Tryna' get up in a thug
Like it ain't no where to go
I know you heard it all before
Don't like you sneaking in the door
Tell your partner she can see the sun
Cause this money on me gotta blow
Hit the club and make it overflow
And these diamonds on me gotta glow

[Verse 3: Skeme]
I can't fear no bitch nor man no sir no m'am
Bae with me got a ass so fat I gotta grab that with both hands
See I'm a rich nigga keep that cake all over my thoughts
Only one rule to the game my nigga that's don't get caught
Take it off bitch bend over let me see it
I think you should get that pussy up inside this European
Better yet just give me brain while a nigga change lanes
I call you boo, bae, and my bitch cause shit to me they all the same
And I never gave a fuck, hardly ever gave a damn
She let me inside it I had to tell her "Thank you M'am"
That's how she know I got manners
And she know my bands up
She ride my dick with her hands up
And take that 'til she can't stand up
Cash ruling everything around me I want C.R.E.A.M
And that Porsche 9-1-1 filled up with 91 supreme
So you know I got to smash put my pedal to the metal
Feel like Noah asking God "Why he done flooded out my bezel?" (Hold up)
