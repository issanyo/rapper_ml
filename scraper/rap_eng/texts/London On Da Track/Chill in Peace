[Pre-Chorus]
This 2K ain’t the one for me (Bitch)
It ain’t got shit I need (Bitch)
They want me to take my time with it but this shit is not for me (Bitch)
Maybe I’m just too good for you
Maybe I’m not your speed (Bitch)
I had high hopes for you, but this shit too weak (Bitch)

[Chorus]
I can’t even chill in peace
Everybody notice me I can’t even join a session without niggas trolling me
This game’s so ass, I’m praying on my knees like Jesus please I can’t even play on this lag
Why’d they make it hard for me?
They got these bum-ass niggas looking like they gods to me
You got these centers doing iso off the post cheese
And these sharpshooters fading from the three like they Kobe There ain’t no loyalty
Y’all said this game was good, but y’all lied to me

[Verse 1]
(Ha) How can y’all lie to me? (Yeah)\
I can not fuck with you honestly
These niggas faking
They hating
They stay instigating
But that shit right there just don’t bother me I rather get the money and deposit it
You rather get the money and demolish it I’ma keep stacking till my pockets lit
And I’ma take off just like a rocket ship
This 2K is so fucking garbage, it’s making me heartless
I feel so departed, just don’t get me started
Might switch to the Live cause your servers retarded
These niggas let Fortnite take over the market
I fucked with y’all heavy, y’all fell off the chart list
Say fuck how we feel cause you ain’t making progress
Say fuck how you feel cause I’m eating regardless
Ain’t talking A Boogie when I say I’m a artist

[Pre-Chorus]
This 2K ain’t the one for me (Bitch)
It ain’t got shit I need (Bitch)
They want me to take my time with it but this shit is not for me (Bitch)
Maybe I’m just too good for you
Maybe I’m not your speed (Bitch)
I had high hopes for you, but this shit too weak (Bitch)

[Chorus]
I can’t even chill in peace
Everybody notice me I can’t even join a session without niggas trolling me
This game’s so ass, I’m praying on my knees like Jesus please I can’t even play on this lag
Why’d they make it hard for me?
They got these bum-ass niggas looking like they gods to me
You got these centers doing iso off the post cheese
And these sharpshooters fading from the three like they Kobe There ain’t no loyalty
Y’all said this game was good, but y’all lied to me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this 2K is all on my conscious (Yeah)
I gotta watch my surroundings
The same niggas say they rocking with you could be the same niggas that’s plotting
This community is filled with frauds I’m dodging the bullshit, I ball like I’m Harden (Yeah)
Got me feeling like I'm Marvin (Yeah)
My niggas never starving (Ayy)
I just hit 100K (Ayy)
How can I stress 2K when a nigga getting paid just to play?
Well, how can you play 2K, grind to 99, and ain’t even getting paid?
And niggas really missing school just to stay at home and play this shitty game
Damn, I can’t relate to you lames

[Pre-Chorus]
This 2K ain’t the one for me (Bitch)
It ain’t got shit I need (Bitch)
They want me to take my time with it but this shit is not for me (Bitch)
Maybe I’m just too good for you
Maybe I’m not your speed (Bitch)
I had high hopes for you, but this shit too weak (Bitch)

[Chorus]
I can’t even chill in peace
