(Intro)
Take off (take off)
I'm in London, got my beat from London

(Verse 1)
Run up a check on them niggas, I got 'em bitter off that
They give me nothin' but they still be feelin' that I should be givin' them that (I don't owe no nigga)
When I come back off the road I take a victory lap (victory lap)
Just can't do no dumb shit with none of these fuck niggas, ain't get that victory back
Turn up, trap house with the space heater, I was just sittin' in that (I was just sittin' in that)
Big MAC with 50 shots, you playin', I'm givin' you that
I ain't gotta wait 'till we outside, I got in the building with that (got in the building with that)
Rob me and I wanna see blood, there ain't no givin' it back (tell him run up on me then)
Niggas watched me run around broke, it ain't no feeling like that (ain't no feeling like that)
Press 'em up off a 3 minute rap, JB, how they feel about that? (on the first day out)
Girl I wanna fuck you in this Wraith, tell me how you feel about that (how you feel about that?)
After this, I'm ignorin' your texts, bitch, you got a nigga for that

(Pre-Chorus)
My stomach was touchin' my back (it was)
I was in my feelings 'bout that (I was)
Remember my freedom got snatched? (it did)
I was in my feelings 'bout that (I was)
But I ain't get hit with no net (I didn't)
They in their feelings 'bout that (they is)
These niggas got overlapped (they did)
They in their feelings 'bout that (they is)

(Chorus)
But I got a Cali' connect (I got a Cali' connect)
In case I don't make it in rap (in case I don't make it in rap)
I gotta chase this connect (gotta chase this connect)
They ain't gon' run out of Act' (They ain't gon' run out of Act')
I got a Miami connect (I got a Miami connect)
My Haitian will throw you a bag (Haitian throw you a bag)
I got a Atlanta connect (I got a Atlanta connect)
They gon' pull up with them straps (pull up with them)

(Verse 2)
Shout-out to my nigga Yachty, he put the bear on the boat (one-hunnid)
That bitch say she got a nigga, I can take care of you both (for real)
My people say, and I quote, "Boy, you will never get on." (fuck 'em)
Now all their faces so long, my free CD damn near went gold (went gold)
Tell the promoter just come with a dub, and I'ma come pack out the place (it's lit)
Don't talk 'bout the business, call up beforehand, my nigga, they gon' get you straight
And you gotta say half while we on the phone, or we can't lock in today
You try to take up for that nigga's beef, you gon' get dropped in his place (you gon' get killed)

(Bridge)
And I got a plug in Virginia, in case I don't make it with lyrics (In case I don't make it with lyrics)
Give a fuck if this your city, I'll put niggas on spirit (I'll put niggas on spirit)
When they get hear it, you wick it, I just met Gotti in Memphis
I only fuck with the streets, can't relate to these industry niggas

(Pre-Chorus)
My stomach was touchin' my back (it was)
I was in my feelings 'bout that (I was)
Remember my freedom got snatched? (it did)
I was in my feelings 'bout that (I was)
But I ain't get hit with no net (I didn't)
They in their feelings 'bout that (they is)
These niggas got overlapped (they did)
They in their feelings 'bout that (they is)

(Chorus)
But I got a Cali' connect (I got a Cali' connect)
In case I don't make it in rap (in case I don't make it in rap)
I got a Texas connect (I got a Texas connect)
They ain't gon' run out of Act' (They ain't gon' run out of Act')
I got a Miami connect (I got a Miami connect)
My Haitian will throw you a bag (Haitian will throw you a bag)
I got a Atlanta connect (got a Atlanta connect)
They gon' pull up with them straps (pull up with them)

(Bridge)
And I got a plug in Virginia, in case I don't make it with lyrics
Give a fuck if this your city, I'll put niggas on spirit
When they get hear it, you wick it, I just met Gotti in Memphis
I only fuck with the streets, can't relate to these industry niggas
