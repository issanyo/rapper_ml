[Verse 1]
This shit ain't nothin' like it used to be
I just found out that my friends and family be usin' me
Medicine cabinet full of pills and I'm abusin' it (yeah I'm abusin')
Fuck lookin' for Waldo 'cause I'm losing me
I used to look up and see stars, now when I look up it's hard
'Cause when I look up I be down on my knees and I'm talkin' to God
My mama ain't say it was easy but she never said it was hard though
Remember her slamming that car door
How you fucked me up, only God know
And now a young nigga hardcore, walkin' this dark road
I should've bought some more leashes 'cause all of my dogs gone
The shit that I'm learning, you could never teach it, not even on smart phones
I must've been under some type of hypnosis 'cause now when I look back I'm far gone

[Chorus]
I hold my head up to keep tears from fallin'
And they just roll down the side of my cheek
What you know 'bout going to Plato's Closet?
Sellin' clothes, tryna buy somethin' to eat
('Cause you hungry and your children hungry)
Got a bright future but that shit ain't promised
When any day you can die in the streets
So don't judge me, don't judge me
Until you lay your head where I sleep, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I can't even lie, it hurt me
I became another person
Remember when I had a purpose
Now I'm lookin' for a purpose
Lurkin', and I'm poppin' them percs
Yeah that cup dirty, cup ice like a Slurpee, Slurppe
When I was down niggas curved me
Made me take off the jersey
When the cost to love you wasn't worth it
But I forgive you, no one's perfect
Had a nigga feelin' worthless, whoa
Watch a nigga thumb through it
Problems, I was goin' through 'em
Partner beggin' me to rob him and I'm beggin' him not to do it
A hundred niggas all around you but you feel like the only one that's in the room
Like you got a voice but you can't speak, yeah
You wake up to sunlight shining all on you but you just ready for the moon
Ready to fall asleep, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I hold my head up to keep tears from fallin'
And they just roll down the side of my cheek
What you know 'bout going to Plato's Closet?
Sellin' clothes, tryna buy somethin' to eat
('Cause you hungry and your children hungry)
Got a bright future but that shit ain't promised
When any day you can die in the streets
So don't judge me, don't judge me
Until you lay your head where I sleep, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
The moon and sun is fascinating to my eyes
If the sun is shining, moon, and all the stars up in the sky
I'm seeing more than the average human eye
In the dark is where I live, lord let me shine, yeah
