[Young Thug Hook ]
Okay, I walked inside this bitch with both my hands up
I got exotic rims on my chair you can't stand us
Brrrr bop bop bop bop you even if you got your hands up
My bitch screaming love peace and happiness no Canada
I'm in love with birds
I can whip a bird (Hey)
My old lady think you a turd
And I'm from A-Town and I need birds (Brrrrr)
(Yeah! Hey!)

[Young Thug Verse 1]
The principal in that school
She riding with me and my dude
She let me nut on her boobs
She let me fuck on her boo
I'm a dog baby, roof roof
I got a Crip partner name Troop
I'm in L.A. boolin' on shrooms
Drinking purple, no prune
I'm drinking purple with no prune? (What?!)
Boosie, my car fast it said "zoom" (What?!)

Hey, tinted windows, you don't know its me

Yeah baby I'm winning I'm gon have a week
Yeah
(We got London on Da Track)
