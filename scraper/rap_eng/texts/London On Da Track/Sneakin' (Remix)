[Intro: Nilly]
Yeah, yuh
Yeah, yuh, yeah, yuh, yeah, yuh
Yeah
It's Friday the 13th, so it's only right that we kill it
(You rockin' wit' Nilly Nation)

[Verse 1: Nilly]
This is all God's doing, goin' with the motion
They keep on hearin' Nilly Nation 'cause it's good promotion
Talk behind my back, when they see me, never show it
Think they sneakin' but I catch 'em on my Terrell Owens
Try-tryna take shots but I never been a drinker
I put the 5 up like somebody stretchin' out they fingers
[?] 'bout to take a turn puttin' on my blinker
Beatin' up the track, yeah, I'm on my Jerry Springer
They sneak dissin', y'all can miss me with that funny talk
Ignorin' everything they sayin' when the money talk
I been fly, y'all can miss me with that bummy talk
Thought I was dead but it's a wrap, see, that's that mummy talk see, yuh
To keep it G, all the hatin' gettin' [?]
Can't be focusin' on stuff I can't control
I'm Snapchattin' wit' a shawty super cold
When she text me five 100's 'cause she know that's how I roll (that's how I roll)

[Chorus: Nilly & La Yung Brown$Kin]
See, people keep reachin' and dissin' (yuh)
They just wanna be in my position (yuh)
I don't need my bros for assistance (nah)
I say I don't need my bros for assistance (hol' up)
See, people keep reachin' and dissin' (yuh)
They don't really see competition (yuh)
I don't need my bros for assistance (nah) (What, ooh, look, yeah, what, ooh!)
I say I don't need my bros

[Verse 2: La Yung Brown$Kin]
Look, [?] 'round my necklace, they be shinin' in the dark, I be flexin'
All she wanted was a picture, now she neck, yeah
If yo' girl choosy, let her, don't be messy
Yeah, I really don't like y'all
Y'all really to the beefin', I really will fight y'all
Don't come in that water wit' no lifeguard
We be in that field swingin' straps like we outchea playin' dyke ball
Yeah, like a deer, I'm buckin' at you
It's a bukkake when all my dudes is bustin' at you
When they go up, [?] that's somethin' like a tattoo
And all my patnas they go walnuts because a cashew
Yeah, look, I ain't in the streets like
I ain't really tryna have no beef like
I be chillin' I keep it lowkey right
With these dudes tryin' me, they talkin' crooked
Like I won't punch 'em up in they mouth and get they teeth right
I'm too cute to go to jail, they gon' tear me up
So if I got a problem, my patnas gon' wet 'em up
And I don't really need my bros for assistance
Don't play with me, you probably gon' end up missin'

[Chorus: Nilly]
See, people keep reachin' and dissin' (yuh)
They just wanna be in my position (yuh)
I don't need my bros for assistance (nah)
I say I don't need my bros for assistance (hol' up)
See, people keep reachin' and dissin' (yuh)
They don't really see competition (yuh)
I don't need my bros for assistance (nah)
I say I don't need my bros

[Verse 3: Nilly]
Hol' up I don't need love, I'm the one
I'm as humble as they come
Man I always tell my fans 'cause they got me havin' fun
And I'm workin' on the blessings on the way to heaven come
Plus my New Year's resolution is to always get it done
I'm doin' it again and did it once before, uh
They sleepin' on me better tell em that I'm woke, uh
I kill 'em with the flow and kill 'em with the cross, uh
McAshHole on the track but I ain't tellin' jokes
Talkin' down on Nilly Nation, man that's dead, boy
You can't remove a crown that's stapled on my head, boy
'Cause you know Nilly 'bout to make you [?] that's overrated
Still I want the positivity to spread, boy
Well, dang
To keep it G, all the hatin' gettin' [?]
Rather channel all my focus in my [?], uh
I'm Snapchattin' wit' a shawty super cold
When she text me five 100's 'cause she know that's how I roll, yuh, yuh!

[Chorus: Nilly]
See, people keep reachin' and dissin' (yuh)
They just wanna be in my position (yuh)
I don't need my bros for assistance (nah)
I say I don't need my bros for assistance (hol' up)
See, people keep reachin' and dissin' (yuh)
They don't really see competition (yuh)
I don't need my bros for assistance (nah)
I say I don't need my bros
