[Verse 1: Ralo]
At night I think about it, them niggas can't without me
Them bitches tried to doubt me, a nigga came up out it
One thing about it, niggas ain't 'bout it, you was just talking
How could they doubt me? How could they doubt me? they was surround me
How could they give it and take it from us?
All of my niggas done made it with us
Fuck all them haters, they can't get in touch
I was impatient, I was in a rush
I just been ballin' and making that money
I came from nothing, I made it, I promise
Fuck all that comments, the hatin' abundance
Tell them I want this 'cause nobody done this
I just been stacking it up
They did not show me no love, I got this shit out the mud
I stood in front of that judge, I didn't have much, I barely made it to court
I love my mama's support, she didn't abort, I owe that lady the world
Tell her I did it for her, I did it for her, she still my favorite lil girl

[Chorus: Birdman]
Yeah, we move them bricks in my neighborhood
Double strapped with them MAC's in my neighborhood
We get the money, flip them hundreds in my neighborhood
I'm staying toe ten down in my neighborhood
Bust guns and don't trip nigga
Play around and get flipped nigga
Hustle, this for them Crips nigga
We do this shit just for them flips nigga
We all gravy in my neighborhood
We get the money, keep it running in my neighborhood

[Verse 2: Ralo]
I'm in the bricks, I'm in the bricks, don't come in the bricks
I'm with your bitch, you want your bitch, she want the dick
Ralo pull up in that Wraith in the Bluff
None of these niggas can take it from us
Fuck what it was, lil ho we does
We just be fucking these hoes just because
Fuck their opinion, I know that I did it
All of my niggas gon' handle their business
I get it, I spend it, you know that I'm winning
None of my niggas been broke in a minute
All of these bitches embrace me, I think it's because of my bracelet
You see the look on they faces, you know them niggas was hating
Tell 'em that I'm gonna win, I'm gonna do it again, look where my niggas have been, yeah
I just got out of the pen, now I get rich off a pen, yeah
They just remember me selling dope
I used to live at that yellow store
That lil nigga doing better though
I ain't ever going back to broke

[Chorus: Birdman]
Yeah, we move them bricks in my neighborhood
Double strapped with them MAC's in my neighborhood
We get the money, flip them hundreds in my neighborhood
I'm staying toe ten down in my neighborhood
Bust guns and don't trip nigga
Play around and get flipped nigga
Hustle, this for them Crips nigga
We do this shit just for them flips nigga
We all gravy in my neighborhood
We get the money, keep it running in my neighborhood

[Verse 3: Derez De'Shon]
Time is money, got the Rollie and the scale on me
On the highway with no license and them bales on me
I got a stick on me right now, that loud talking, better pipe down
'Fore I catch a body right now, yeah, yeah, I'm talking right now
I'm from southside, Clayton County
'Fore you try it better think about it
Rex Road, niggas bang about it
Everybody having paper round me
Most of these niggas be lying
Most of these niggas be lying, never committed a crime
Pull out that fire and they crying, what's on the back of your mind?
I'm on that mob shit like Lil Hitty
I'm stealing, we rob shit, and we killin'
No swiping no card shit, in the trenches
Got dope in the closet and the skillets
Crips and Bloods show me love in my neighborhood
Before you cross me better be cautious in my neighborhood, yeah

[Chorus: Birdman]
Yeah, we move them bricks in my neighborhood
Double strapped with them MAC's in my neighborhood
We get the money, flip them hundreds in my neighborhood
I'm staying toe ten down in my neighborhood
Bust guns and don't trip nigga
Play around and get flipped nigga
Hustle, this for them Crips nigga
We do this shit just for them flips nigga
We all gravy in my neighborhood
We get the money, keep it running in my neighborhood

[Outro: Birdman]
Yeah, you understand?
Bright lights and I ain't talkin' 'bout the ikes, you dig?
Spark for my dead homies
And I ride for my niggas, nigga
Hustle, we hustle, hustle nigga
We get the money, go to trippin' nigga
Put that gauge to your head nigga
Open safes or you're dead nigga
