[Intro]
Aye, every stream be like, off the chain these days like
I don't even know what a ban is these days, you know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck that dog 'cause she a rat rat

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't the sub for me, man
You ain't got shit I need, snitch
You want me to take my time to stream
Well maybe It’s not yo stream, snitch
Maybe I might play league, snitch
You ain't even on my team, snitch
Maybe I'm just too clean for you
Or maybe I'm too elite, snitch

[Chorus]
I can't even stream in peace (why)
Everybody spammin' me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling with Poki (yeah)
They tried to give me a ban
Got on my knees "BlessRNG"
He don't even believe Saysera
Why you got him on yo stream
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta snitch on me
Even the plebs can see
That you ain't gon' spam for me
You ain't even showing me support you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said that you gon' spam for me

[Verse 1]
Homie, that's blasphemy, yeah
Homie, that's tragedy, yeah
Say you gon' chat for me, yeah
Say you gon’ spam for me, yeah
Why you ain't show me none of the love you say you have for me, yeah
Im tryna stream happily
Bitch, you snitched rapidly, yeah
Imma have to lose my calm, yeah
Nigga I'm lit, I'm the bomb, yeah
Nigga I'm lit, no Saddam, yeah
Pleb, you need to sub and step up, yeah
I'll leave you niggas red, like ketchup, yeah
I'll leave you niggas red, no make up, ayy
Nalgada face down with her ass up, ayy
They want me to stay down but, I'm hyped up, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't the sub for me, man
You ain't got shit I need, snitch
You want me to take my time to stream
Well maybe It’s not yo stream, snitch
Maybe I might play league, snitch
You ain't even on my team, snitch
Maybe I'm just too clean for you
Or maybe I'm too elite, snitch

[Chorus]
I can't even stream in peace (why)
Everybody spammin' me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling with Poki (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I ain't gon' watch the stream tonight 'cause I need to get sleep in, huh
If I play Poki’s voice at night then it might just wake Fedmyster up
Last time he streamed some shit he fucked up and leaked some stuff
When they banned Lil Myster stream, my nigga, I couldn't believe it, huh
Ayy lil' Poki, keep on rolling
Merch on Houdini, its gone yuh
That made me mad, it’s what I needed
So I robbed a fan, that's TriHard
Remember Lily had that spear, huh
Couldn't leave that near her
Nigga I'm based, no Yoona
That mean a young pleb got nothin on me (ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't the sub for me, man
You ain't got shit I need, snitch
You want me to take my time to stream
Well maybe It’s not yo stream, snitch
Maybe I might play league, snitch
You ain't even on my team, snitch
Maybe I'm just too clean for you
Or maybe I'm too elite, snitch

[Chorus]
I can't even stream in peace (why)
Everybody spammin' me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling with Poki (yeah)
