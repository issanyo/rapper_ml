Deadman Wonderland
They gon let me in the game yeah
They gon let me penetrate yeah
She gon make her nigga wait yeah
She gon let a nigga skate

Redman Redman aye
Muddy waters on the dark side
When I was young I kept some headphones
Cause I ain't wanna hear the gunfire
I ain't wanna be the one tired
Dreams crushed as a young child
Living life as the fat kid my favorite time was the lunchtime
Nigga tried to skip the lunch line now his mom crying and heart fried always tried to be the nice guy but in real life, I be done trying
Get the check then I take off
Off ya set then I take off
Big diamonds like baseball
Writing hooks like Nate Dogg
If the kid should die on the way to my Legend
Hope they see me as a king they don't see me as a peasant
I may seem underwhelm unaware of my blessing
I don't know if there's a heaven
If there is then Ima tell em sheesh
