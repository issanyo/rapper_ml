I was looking for you
I forgot my test
I seen you walking with a man
It hurt my flesh
But I hope you're blessed
And I still use crest
And your toothbrush
And wear your necklace (yea)
(ok) I told the girl "lets go"
She said she straight but she gone bend
She wanna hate me bad but she know she can't cus its a sin
And she say she staying out but she know that we in
We in, we in
We in, we in (yea)
OK now back to the song
You can leave yo thong at home
You can leave yo strong at home
I got alot of weed
I got alot of money
I can buy alot of weave
No Alicia Skooly got keys
And we ain't trippin'
We the seas (yea)
And she a nasty lil bitch
Cus I know she miss that dick, I miss that clit so
I'll be waitin' on you when the sunrise
I'll be waitin' on you when the sunrise
I'll be waitin' on you when the sunrise
I'll be waitin' on you when the sunrise
(Uhh) We in this bitch
And if a nigga start we'll end this bitch
I came with my team
Where the fuck is a click?
Cus that is not us cus that is on a bitch ya digg (uhh)
Ok now back to the song
You can leave yo thong at home
And you can leave yo strong at home
I got alot of weed
I got alot of money
I can buy alot of weave
No Alica Skooly got keys
And we ain't trippin'
We the seas (yea)
And she a nasty lil ho
Cus I kno she miss that dick,I miss that clit so
I'll be waitin' on you when the sunrise
I'll be waitin' on you when the sunrise
I'll be waitin' on you when the sunrise
I'll be waitin' on you when the sunrise
