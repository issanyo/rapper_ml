[Intro-Quez]
Oooh-woah
Oooh-woah
We got London on da Track

[Chorus-Quez]
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
I might hit T’s on a Monday
I’m geeked up throwing this money
Might hit the flame on a Tuesday
I smack your bitch on the booty
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
I got it raining in dollars
Might make it rain on your patna
I’m in here letting it fly
Order some wings and some fries
When I come to your trap

[Verse 1-Ali]
I’ma come fuck up your trap
I’ma come fuck up your trap
Them other niggas some caps
I’ma throw 20’s no care
This a 120 right here
This a 120 right here
She got them tiddies oh yeah
She got that booty oh yeah
Put that little pussy right here
Yeah, yeah, 20’s in air
Yeah, yeah, that is not fair
Yeah, yeah, come over here
Yeah, yeah, slap on her rear
Throw it up on her so careless
Them other strippers are jealous
I got a big booty fetish
These bitches love the confetti

[Chorus-Quez]
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap

[Verse 2-Quez]
Boss, I’m in the club on a Wednesday
Walked in and ordered a 10-piece
Met this little stripper named Kenzie
I got her gone off that Henny
I got her all in a frenzy
Do anything for the Benjis
She wanna fuck in the Bentley
Put that TP up on replay
Order a shot for the DJ
There go them ballers, be patient
Left a little tip for the waitress
Now girl I know you ain’t goin’ let another bitch come in your trap (come in your trap)
Now girl I know you ain’t goin’ let another bitch come in your trap
(I know you ain’t, know you ain’t, know you ain’t, oh)

[Chorus-Quez]
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
I might hit T’s on a Monday
I’m geeked up throwing this money
Might hit the flame on a Tuesday
I smack your bitch on the booty
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
I got it raining in dollars
Might make it rain on your patna
I’m in here letting it fly
Order some wings and some fries
When I come to your trap

[Verse 3-Strap]
Rainman go away, know I make it rain
Monday night at Magic City
Tuesday at Blue Flame
Yeah, think I just up a ten, yeah
But I might do it again, yeah
Smashed on a hoe with her friend
Laugh on em hoes at the end
I got the check on me, I got the recipe, know they goin’ hate on the kid
I turned up the city, had that bitch on fire, and I swear I’ma do it again
Bitch better know ain’t a damn thing changed
Still a young nigga with a whole bunch of game
Still got cash, got diamonds in my ring
Come to your trap and I blow a whole thing

[Chorus-Quez]
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
I might hit T’s on a Monday
I’m geeked up throwing this money
Might hit the flame on a Tuesday
I smack your bitch on the booty
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
Girl I might come to your trap
I got it raining in dollars
Might make it rain on your patna
I’m in here letting it fly
