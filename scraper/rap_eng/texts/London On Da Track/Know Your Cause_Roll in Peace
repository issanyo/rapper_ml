Part I: Roll in Peace
[Intro: DJ Luna]
South Florida

[Hook: Sylvan LaCue]
Know your cause, know your cause
Preach like a reverend
Ain't nobody ready to die, but we all wanna go to Heaven
I know I ain't ready to die, but we all wanna go to Heaven
Start talking like this right?

[Verse: Sylvan LaCue]
I spaz on beats (mmm), that's my treat (mmm)
I speak peace (mmm), you should stop and feast
Food for thought (mmm), mind on beats (mmm yeah)
Time is bleak (uh), don't ask for [premise]
Hoppin' off this plane (hoppin' off this plane)
Cruisin' on Biscayne (Cruisin' on Biscayne)
My nigga said link up (brr)
I ain't seen him in 3 months, more like 3 years
I was on the west coast, tryna get the cash right (uh)
Tryna get my card right (uh)
Still on the fence, I believe (lieve)
Niggas is not what they seem (seem)
I was out chasin' a dream (dream)
Tryna do more for the scene (scene)
Thought I was stuntin' or neglected (shit)
Comin' to find I neglected (hmm)
Grandmother died, I was reckless (yeah)
Had to come back home, time is precious
Oh, wow, OMG, (yeah), I just wanna grow my seeds (yeah)
I can't even blow my weed (yeah)
Can't a nigga roll in peace (yeah)
Can't a nigga roll in peace (yeah)
I don't even know police (esketit)
They don't even know my niece
Shoot first, ask later when the .44 squeeze
Damn, I don't even know I speed
Damn, I ain't got coke on me
Dog, I just got a roach on me
Damn, can't a nigga roll in peace
Damn, can't a nigga roll in peace
Damn, I don't even know police
Damn, ya'll don't even know my niece
Shoot first, ask later when the .44 squeeze
Out in Cali smoking cookies for lunch
Back in South Beach I was hiding my blunt
Cousins on cousins got pinched for a felony
That's why I walk by police with a smell on me
Fuck your enforcement, we sense all your jealousy
Hatred conceiving, no pressure won't sell on me
Stop drinking soda, improve on my melanin
Put down the liquor for earth, [rock/worth] the fellowship
I know some niggas in places
Everyday living courageous
Everyday looking for spaceships
J. Cole, I know you only want better but you cannot knock the escape
Tell niggas who's dying to not medicate
I grab me a bag, I smoke till it's done
Then follow the system they told me to fund
Meditate (meditate), meditate (meditate)
Slipping might make a nigga levitate (yah)
Money be the root of all evil
Systemised for the people
Niggas can't just resist that
Can't just go against that
Gotta learn how to burn within that
This revolutions gotta be in tune with your higher self now
Gotta think about yourself now
Gotta think about your wealth now
Money ain't shit but a [bag/backless] bitch that you might fuck twice, if you're hellbound
Wealth nigga, share shit with your friends bro
Exchange favors that's friend goals
Get in tune with your end goal
Know yourself through these trends bro
How about we stop fighting amongst the same kind, my nigga, we all kinfolk
Need to start asking questions
Who you mad at? Them or you?
Made a fool and that's cool to fail, but let's move in hell
So we can find solutions and explore the realm

[Hook: Sylvan LaCue]
Know your cause, know your cause
Preach like a reverend
Ain't nobody ready to die, but we all wanna go to Heaven
I know I ain't ready to die, but we all wanna go to Heaven

Part II: Know Your Cause
[Intro: Sylvan LaCue]
In my life, please bae don't go switchin' sides, switchin' sides
I swear this is where you reside, you reside, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, aye

[Hook: Sylvan LaCue]
Know you gotta your cause, know your cause
Preach like a reverend
Ain't nobody ready to die, but we all wanna go to Heaven
I know I ain't ready to die, but we all wanna go to Heaven
Nobody knows where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go

[Verse: Sylvan LaCue]
I, I ain't know much about -- shit

I ain't know much about X, but, don't no one deserve -- shit, man
Where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go
I said, I, I ain't know much about -- shit
I ain't know much about Tray
I ain't know much about X, but don't no one deserve death, nah

[Hook: Sylvan LaCue]
Know you gotta your cause, know your cause
Preach like a reverend
Ain't nobody ready to die, but we all wanna go to Heaven
I know I ain't ready to die, but we all wanna go to Heaven
Nobody knows where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go
Where you go, you go, you go
