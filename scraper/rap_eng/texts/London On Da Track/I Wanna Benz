[Intro]
Caine: I needed some rims bad and I knew just how to get them. And I sure as hell wasn't gonna pay for them. All I had to do was to catch some fool slippin' and jack his ass
Response: Nigga what the fuck you want from me?
Caine: Nigga, you know what the fuck I want nigga. I want your motherfuckin' Dayton's, and your motherfuckin' stereo, and I'll take a double burger with cheese
Response: What!?

I wanna Benz, I wanna look good with my friends
I need my money, that don't ever end
I wanna blow some bands, and still have some bands
I wanna be the motherfuckin' man
Bitch, I wanna Benz, I wanna look good with my friends
I need my money, that don't ever end
I wanna blow some bands, and still have some bands
I wanna be the motherfuckin' man

[Verse 1: YG]
I want a four door Benz that fit all my friends
So I could pull up on a bitch and tell her “bitch, get in”
Bitch, I want the crib, nobody know where I live
Cause that’s where I hide all my shit
Diamonds on my wrist, on my neck and other wrist
Got damn, look at this
Oh, she want a kid? She wanna trip when I dip
Damn, bitch, let me live
I wanna be a baller, hit the mall, ring it all up
It’s ten G’s, ring it all up
Hit the strip club, we make a mess, she clean it all up
Black Chyna, clean it all up
I do it cause I can, African American
They never wanted us to have bands
Do you hear what I’m saying?
This was not in they plan
But now a young nigga got bands and...

I wanna Benz, I wanna look good with my friends

I need my money, that don't ever end
I wanna blow some bands, and still have some bands
I wanna be the motherfuckin' man

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
I want an all black Benz without no tints
So you can see the gold glow when the sun shine in
Put Pirellis on stocks, I don’t want no rims
Want a big stash spot to put this four-five in
I want all my niggas ballin' in the fast lane
Hundred some thick when we pull up to the valet (what?)
Park and hop out with the mad face
Cause niggas think shit turned down since the cash came
Oh, fuck that, heard shots then we bust back (bang)
Bullet proof everything, you can trust that
You done it like we done it, I suggest that (why?)
Cause would you rather be the victim or the suspect?
Oh, no, I came too forth
Changed my ways, no, I change my broad
Chase my change, never change my squad
And stack 'till I can change my car, cause…

I wanna Benz, I wanna look good with my friends

I need my money, that don't ever end
I wanna blow some bands, and still have some bands
I wanna be the motherfuckin' man

We blew a hunna G’s on some bitches out in Vegas
It’s YG and Fifty, niggas know they can’t fade it
She get the seven digits, she could say she hit the jackpot
Accountants ain’t counting money coming out the crack spots
Come through in a motorcade, bitch ,we shut your block down
Foreigns everywhere, you know a nigga on top now
We tipping bitches, stripping, bust it open for a real nigga
You thinking she won’t, I’m thinking hell yeah, she will figure
There’s gonna be a party right after the party
She may menage with somebody
Cause we got bitches with us that’s bringing more bitches, get it?
I bet you your bitch with it, she come through she gon' get it
This is nothing personal, now why would this be hurting you?
Bottles poppin', pussy poppin', mollies in the water
Crazy shit that we be doing with somebody’s daughter
Have me thinking, damn nigga, we be out of order
We turn up too loud, they call the law on us
