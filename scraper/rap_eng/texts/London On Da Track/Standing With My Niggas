[Hook:]
Still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas

[Verse 1:]
I stepped outside fresher than a mofucker
I'm looking over my shoulders
I'm single and got a big crib
I'm lying but thats what I told her
Everybody love me
I'm a make you love me
I swear to god all my niggas they'll die for me
I think she the one who gone ride for me

[Pre-Hook:]
And I don't want to come off rude but girl I must inform ya
You got a problem girl my niggas they gonna solve em for ya
And if thats not enough then girl I'm a have to solve it for ya
You know I'm gone do it for you
You know I'm gone do it for you

[Hook:]
Still standing with my niggas
Still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas

[Verse 2:]
They know I ain't switching up
My niggas know if they need it I'm a give it up
Stunna give me the keys to the Bugatti I [?]
I'm a give you the Lambo for a day you gone switch it up
Oh I got London on the beat
And I still got some niggas in the streets
They'll kill if a nigga fuck with me
So thats why I don't worry bout beef

[Pre-Hook:]
And I don't want to come off rude but girl I must inform ya
You got a problem girl my niggas they gonna solve em for ya
And if thats not enough then girl I'm a have to solve it for ya
You know I'm gone do it for you
You know I'm gone do it for you

[Hook:]
Still standing with my niggas
Still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas (It's like I'm standing still)
I'm still standing with my niggas (I'm standing still)
I'm still standing with my niggas

[Outro:]
You can't take em from me
I've got some niggas in trial for me
I've got some niggas that cry for me
I know some niggas that lie to me
One time for my niggas that ain't here right now
One time for my niggas thats still locked down
Still standing with my niggas
Still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas
I'm still standing with my niggas
