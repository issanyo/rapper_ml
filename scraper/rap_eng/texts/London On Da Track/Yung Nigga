[Chorus]
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
All I wanted was some money and a pistol
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
Came up in this bitch for one reason
I will not stunt anymore
I was tryna get some money, I was on the block
I was selling the dope, I was outside in the cold
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Selling the dope, flipping it, I gotta get it
Ain't no more talking, ridiculous, nigga be playing these games
When I pull up I'm killing it (skurt), woah
Diamonds on me and they're dipping, they wet and they slippery
Bitches fuck with me, they fuck with me
You know that I'm dicking them
I was outside in the cold, no Kleenex wipe a niggas nose
[?], so you already know
I ain't playing no games with em, I ain't playing no game with you
Put some respeck on my name nigga, play with my name bitch

[Chorus]
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
All I wanted was some money and a pistol
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
Came up in this bitch for one reason (what you want?)
I will not stunt anymore
I was tryna get some money, I was on the block
I was selling the dope, I was outside in the cold
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
My daddy told me I was tripping
If they caught me slipping they coming to get me
I told him, fuck it, I'mma risk it
Casket or the penitentiary, I gotta take care of my children
Young nigga hot as a biscuit, I wasn't stunting these bitches
I was trying to get a ticket
Sleeping on a hundred thousand below a mattress
That's what I'mma be when I grow up outside of the trap
Sleeping in the kitchen, whipping the dope, I'm a master
[?] a foreign whip, bought a ghost and called it Casper

[Chorus]
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
All I wanted was some money and a pistol
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
Came up in this bitch for one reason (what you want?)
I will not stunt anymore
I was tryna get some money, I was on the block
I was selling the dope, I was outside in the cold
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
When I was a young nigga, young nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
When I was a young nigga I just wanted to be a stunna, right?
Now a nigga riding around with Stunna hopping out sprinters
City to city, Dunk we did it!
