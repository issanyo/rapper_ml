[Hook: Skool Boy]

You won, you won, you won
You won, you won, you won
You won, you won, you won
You won, you won, you won

[Verse 1: Skool Boy]

Walking through million dollar homes in these muddy Louis
Trail Blazer for him Jay call me Sam Bowie
She exhausted with her man I can tell how she move it
I tried to help her by letting her drink all of my man fluid
Fuck a remote I'm having episodes with the Scrilla
Beat up the game I'm going Tekken 4 in the building
It's 10 of us but it's 11 hoes interfering
2 gotta do 1
You gotta do sum
Its gotta done
Cash, long as the yellow brick road
Make hoes blow like an elephant nose
Then I start fuckin elegant hoes
I'm so allergic to celibate hoes
Got niggas thats killin, but ain't got no twitter
But that shit is just so irrelevant though
Hell of a flow
Got several of those
Prison bars, felony flow
My favorite stores keep goin up on all my sneaker prices
I tell John, I'm goin up on all my feature prices
Feel like fuck a bird when I'm fly
Realest shit you heard when I'm high
CCM uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kaelub]

You are, just what you are
Like new years or the 4th my niggas shoot for the stars
We some solid young niggas, finishin what we started
We ain't trippin, ain't no luggage, but we bout to depart it
-
-
If you keep it, keep it real man
It ain't my rules, but I respect the game
And they say you change, when they see you make it change
And we done fuck the city up, there's condoms err where
We ballin cause we want, there's bottles err where, uh
Thirty third we in the bitch like a tampon
All my niggas poppin shit no cap-guns

[Hook]

You won, you won, you won
You won, you won, you won
You won, you won, you won
You won, you won, you won
You won
