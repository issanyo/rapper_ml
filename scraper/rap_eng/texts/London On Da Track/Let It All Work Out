[Intro]
Aye how many hoes you bout to fuck, fool? Twelve
(We got London On Da Track!) Hey
Let it all work out, aye
Let it all work out

[Verse 1]
1991, Big Duck had a nigga named Lil Jeff
Started from the bottom, now a nigga so high, you gotta watch your damn step
Never wore fake gold, nigga, diamond’s water like it knew Michael Phelps
Every time I get a shape-up, I give em Jacksons like niggas was Michael Che
Nut by myself, hut by myself
Fight break off in the chain gang, they ain’t getting cut by myself
Nigga same thing, nigga bang bang, I did a lot of things for this wealth
Eww.. what’s left?
Calculator living, now she fuck me on the steps
50k a show, I pray to God I don’t get killed
Plus she pray to God I don’t get killed cause she need help
[?] in my belt
Nigga, how the hell you gon throw the profit?
My old school own diamonds, [?]
Nigga nigga let em have it, nigga how many how many girls
So many years without Tampax Pearls
But you forgot to train your lil girl, let, let this shit work out

[Hook]
Hey, let this shit work out
Oh, let this shit work out
Hey, let it all work out, out
Let it all work out out out, out out
Let it all work out out out, out out
Out out, out out, out out, out out
Let it work out, work out

[Verse 2]
God, this bitch, wanna fuck, Thug, swag
Hunnids bagged up, up, up
Pass that clique, I'ma meet her like a damn ticket
Feed my dick, word for brick, I'm the highest hippie
House blacked out, red opps, don't get caught
Fuck a [?], iced out rollie, I ain't gon' sugarcoat it
Let let let let, let it all work out
I'm a junkie, I spend racks like a cash cow
Bih- bitch I control everything from the couch
I done served this bitch so much dick, she don't know how to walk

[Outro]
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
