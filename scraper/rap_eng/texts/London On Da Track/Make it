[Intro:RK Skooly]
They'll never want it
We gone make it yall

Hop back in my spaceship

[Replay]
They'll never want it

[Hook: RK Skooly]

[Verse 1:RK Skooly]
Im the real deal, i really mean it doe
Pop a chill pill, drink some lean and smoke
They say they really spent it, i ain't seen it doe
Now dey droppin' salt, where you get from
It's, pussy and palm trees
That's what calms me
Im prolly in the Coupe gettin' top speed, doin top speed
Can't top dat, can't stop me, can't knock me
Even if it was a jug, prolly gotcha ho behind it,now these niqqas more behind it

[Hook: RK Skooly]
Face it, boy im trynna make it
Get back on my make shit
Hop back in my spaceship
Get out of here
Patience, you gotta have patience
Dey gone make me take it
See it and they face it
Ain't never wanted, need to make it anyway
T-to make it anyway
Ain't never wanted, need to make it anyway
T-to make it anyway

[Verse 2: RK Kaelub]
Hey they ain't want the kid to make it niqqas short stoppin'
Had to flip the re up and then stack the profit
I had to slow down at the same time like the cops cockin'
Aye dey was hatin' on a player with all that soft droppin'
Hell, next time try snail
Im just a young niqqa still gettin' paper ?
And we gotta make shit
Money we gone make it
No we not basis, yes we gonna take it
And get out of here


[Hook: RK Skooly]
Face it, boy im trynna make it
Get back on my make shit
Hop back in my spaceship
Get out of here
Patience, you gotta have patience
Dey gone make me take it
See it and they face it
Ain't never wanted, need to make it anyway
T-to make it anyway
Ain't never wanted, need to make it anyway
T-to make it anyway
