[Intro: Soulja Boy & Bow Wow]
Yeah, yeah
S-So, sip it out the styrofoam my nigga?
We got London On Da Track
Alright nigga, a-a-alright nigga, I'mma sip it, I'mma sip it
Soulja, Bow, aye pour this drink up man
I-I am nigga, I mean how the fuck is it supposed to make me feel I mean?
I got a four of promethazine on me now
Oh nigga, I'm tripping
Word through the town, we sipping lean right now
Nigga I'm getting tired and shit, nigga my motherfucking mind moving slow and all kind of shit my nigga

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Soulja got me sipping lean, he just poured me a four
Everything in the room is moving in slo-mo
I'm really really leaning, I don't think I want no more
We got naked bitches passed out all on the floor
This my first time fucking with that DJ Screw
I can't even stay awake, that's what that lean will do
Pour it out that baby bottle right into that juice
If I take another sip of it, I am through

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Soulja telling me to relax
How the fuck am I going to relax?
Nigga, just show me where the weed at
Because the lean got a nigga [?]
Got me throwed off the four
Rest in peace to Pimp, know that, yeah
Because I like to get high
I don't know about this high
I kicked doors and all
Lean got me all tired
Man, I'm losing all my energy
Just give a nigga Hennessy
Codeine all into me
New habits, what got into me?
Body itching, I'm twisted (I'm tripping)
Soulja telling me to chill out
Fucked around and just fell out
Purple drank made me pass out
Heart speeding up fast now
I just want to get this high over
All I want to do is feel sober
I'm gonna fuck around and kill Soulja
Pouring this shit in my soda
What the fuck?

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Soulja got me sipping lean, he just poured me a four
Everything in the room is moving in slo-mo
I'm really really leaning, I don't think I want no more
We got naked bitches passed out all on the floor
This my first time fucking with that DJ Screw
I can't even stay awake, that's what that lean will do
Pour it out that baby bottle right into that juice
If I take another sip of it, I am through

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Word through the city, I'm the man now
Pouring up pints, got them slowing down
Lot of girls with us when we come around
We be piped up in the city, we ain't piped down
Hop out when I'm stunting, I'm rocking YSL
Pouring up lean, moving slow, can't you tell?
Hol' up, hol' up
I just got a pint of Act I'm pouring up right now
Pour a four in a Sprite
Put it in a cup, gave it to Ben
With the lean and the percocet got me slowing down
Got a whole lot of bottles of lean inside my house
Got a double cup of promethazine on me now
Got a cup of lean in the Bentley coupe when we smash it out

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Soulja got me sipping lean, he just poured me a four
Everything in the room is moving in slo-mo
I'm really really leaning, I don't think I want no more
We got naked bitches passed out all on the floor
This my first time fucking with that DJ Screw
I can't even stay awake, that's what that lean will do
Pour it out that baby bottle right into that juice
If I take another sip of it, I am through
