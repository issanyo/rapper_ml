[Intro: Kevin Gates]
I wake up every morning
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
Feeling like the strongest man in the world
But I ain’t Hercules

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
When trying to make a million, you’ll lose everything
Have you wondering is it worth it
And I know nobody’s perfect
But all the shit I’m going through, do I deserve it?
I’m confused, trying to figure out my purpose
Showing love but not to see it is the worsest
Pain that I ever felt, the worsest pain that I ever felt

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
These rap niggas lying, they don’t sleep in a trap
They don’t wake up to a nigga throwin' a brick in they lap
And I don’t glorify the dope boy lifestyle
Sick and tired of living the poor boy lifestyle
Laying with the chopstick and the baby nine
Ready to take a nigga out if he play with mine
Baby momma call, background baby crying
Tried to ignore her but she called 'bout eighty times
One house with ten nigga, mind on the same thing
And you the only one that ain’t been to the chain gang
And they asked you to keep rapping so we can change things
And since they told you to start trapping been hard to maintain

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
When trying to make a million, you’ll lose everything
Have you wondering is it worth it
And I know nobody’s perfect
But all the shit I’m going through, do I deserve it?
I’m confused, trying to figure out my purpose
Showing love but not to see it is the worsest
Pain that I ever felt, the worsest pain that I ever felt

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
(Get him Gates)
I’m a little overweight but no one’s perfect
Down on bended knees, Boyz II Men, seeking purple
Just wanted a bad bitch to find me attractive
Clothes dirty, make it difficult when finding me attractive
Sucked up the slack, picked up a fumble and made it happen
After the snap, started punting, pray I don’t get tackled
Know what it take, don’t do what it take 'cause I pray for balance
Misperceiving me in the media, I ain’t pray for glamour
Real street niggas in Atlanta who play with falcons
Surveillance on my home and phone while I pay for cameras
Talked about in church, when it hurt get upset
Wondering which one of my loved ones gonna turn on me next
Gates

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
When trying to make a million, you’ll lose everything
Have you wondering is it worth it
And I know nobody’s perfect
But all the shit I’m going through, do I deserve it?
I’m confused, trying to figure out my purpose
Showing love but not to see it is the worsest
Pain that I ever felt, the worsest pain that I ever felt

[Outro: Derez De'Shon]
When trying to make a million, you’ll lose everything
Have you wondering is it worth it
And I know nobody’s perfect
But all the shit I’m going through, do I deserve it?
I’m confused, trying to figure out my purpose
Showing love but not to see it is the worsest
Pain that I ever felt, the worsest pain that I ever felt
