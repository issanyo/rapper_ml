KID INK - IMAGINE FT TYREE
[Intro - Kid Ink]
Yeah, I got her like
She knew what she wanted until I ran up on it and said
Now I got her like
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here [x4]
You know what it is cause I live like

[Verse - Kid Ink]
Everything is a promo
Make sure I look clean for the photo
You know though, snatch your queen and she go though
Cause she ain't ever met my type, not a proto
Oh no, I ain't like them other niggas actin'
Take you out to Macy's, just ask for it
Straight from the mall to the mattress
That's all that matters
You couldn't even imagine
Don't you worry about the balance
I run the city like Ricky in the alley
Them numbers don't lie, check the tally
And I throw somethin' if I see you got the talent
And now she bouncin' like a low low
Soon as she seen a chain in the lower
And I'ma spend everything I came with
Everyday the same shit
You couldn't even imagine

[Hook - Kid Ink]
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here
Ridin' in the drop to the spot, man
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here
Tryna buy it all at the mall now
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here
You know what it is cause I live like

[Verse - TrinidadRee]
We gone put one in the air (in the air)
Hol'up, now everybody wanna stare
At a young black nigga like me
Long live Philly, got people tellin' me to carry his legacy
Everywhere I go
They like where's Tyree I'm like here I go
Always switchin' lanes (yee) I gotta stay on the road
Three fingers bussin' but I cock it back and reload
When the lights go off, I'm getting ready for shows
When it's time to show off you know im ready for more
When I do blow up you know I got C4's
When I do roll up just know I got that Dope
I got my baby on my side (Yee)
She the type who gone ride (Yee)
Now why would I lie? She wanna do the 6 when I'm on 9
"I got her like..."

[Hook]
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here
Ridin' in the drop to the spot, man
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here
Tryna buy it all at the mall now
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here
I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here
You know what it is cause I live like

I got her like "take me there," she wanna go here [x4]
You know what it is cause I live like
