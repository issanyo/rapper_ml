I'm coming after you, no letter V
I murder these beats, no third degree
Tryna get a buzz like a bumble bee
Got me spitting cold bars like some
Fucking seeds
Wanna spread love but they make me bleed
These kids got guns but they ask for peace
Tryna make it out but they lack the cheese
Wanna do good but they slack with ease
God damn! i'm going in
Fucking a thot that's so obscene
Fiening for the rhymes like it's dopamine
Doing fuckin xans cause it makes me lean
Attracted to the money like she need that
Told her take it off, lemme see that
They sleepin on me like a cat nap
So i'm wakin yall up with a few snaps
