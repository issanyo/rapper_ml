[Chorus]
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't no white house, ain't no picket fence
Baby, you know we don't want the same things
While you're caught up in your feelings
I feel the same as I did yesterday
Baby, we've been through this and I feel the same way
I know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe

[Verse 1]
I done told you, I done showed you
Now you wanna act like I tricked you
But I'm sleep, can't you see?
There's a difference between me, you and these sheets

[Chorus]
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't no white house, ain't no picket fence
Baby, you know we don't want the same things
While you're caught up in your feelings
I feel the same as I did yesterday
Baby, we've been through this and I feel the same way
I know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe

[Verse 2]
Don't you act innocent, you own the part that you play
And I'm not interested in playing your childish games
No, no, no, no, I don't have to keep it real
But I do because I care 'bout how you feel

[Chorus]
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you
Keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low
I don't belong to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't no white house, ain't no picket fence
Baby, you know we don't want the same things
While you're caught up in your feelings
I feel the same as I did yesterday
Baby, we've been through this and I feel the same way
I know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe

[Outro]
Don't take it all so personal
I just can't give you what you want
Don't think that you can just keep tryin' me
Boy, I'll just leave you alone
I don't belong to you
