Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Young nigga, I'm super savage
Young nigga, I'm super savage
We got the 30 in the club, yeah we got
Snuck the 30 in the club cause we 'bout it
And a nigga talkin' like he got dough
And I already know he a ho
So you know how the shit gon' go
We gon' take him down and come back to the show
She say lets go out I said no
She say Reese take me out I say no
Baby you already know how it go
The hotel or the motel flow
I got hunnids in my pockets I'mma blow
On me and the squad though
If a bitch wanna come with us she gonna fuck for free and she ain't gonna get no dough (no cash)
But I'm on your ass
If you owe me cash
You better run that cash
You better run that fast
No credit cards in my wallet bitch I got all cash
In my stash house it ain't number 30s and choppers I blast

But if she gonna ride the dick I'm gonna let her baby
I'm gon stack up on my cheese and my cheddar baby
I don't pay for service, the shit don't matter baby
Niggas smoking just like Bob but not cheeley baby
Check your bitch my nigga, don't check my bro
Just because he don't smell like tacos don't mean he don't got nachos
Plus he good with the wordplay just like Rocko
Ya nigga living lavish my main girl a marvel
