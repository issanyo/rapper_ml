This here is a rich nigga walk-through

Double M HUH!!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
From Miami Grove, Weed up in Orlando Nigga
Hit Atlanta, watch the Phantom at the Bando Nigga
Purple pint I pour it in the Yellow Fanta nigga
While by Lebron's I Hit the horn I know Savannah hear me
Snatching snitches off the corner like I'm Wayne Williams
Real Niggas feel pain of those slain children
Get it how you live, Nigga we remain pilgrim
When niggas know how good you live
That evoked feelings
His bezel frozen, Eric Boseman
In the world of so many, I'm the one that chosen
A nigga focus, I'm smoking lemon pepper
Just bought the black 7, I got the yellow leather

[Hook: Bleu Davinci]
Hunnid thousand on me nigga what you gon do

Hunnid thousand on me nigga what you gon do
Black bottles in my section what you wanna do

[Verse 2: Bleu Davinci]
My whip game so loco
My dope game, My car game
My bitch hot, she propane
Got dumb head like no brain
I piss a nigga off, pull up in that Mclaren
Look your boy, Bitch know I'm sparing
5th in the waist, Black bottle nigga
Got bands in the safe, no bands in your face
Rich niggas talking, Broke niggas should listen
Get so much money the feds be dripping
Try me for money
Your son and daughter your wife and Mamma
Gon all come up missing
Im back up on my shit, I got money for war
Niggas is soft, Im smelling the food
80 a flip, I go holla at migo
He love a nigga that know how to move
My kitchen is so steamed up
My pot is hot we eat that
My car roam that highway, they Got bread we need that
I shine on a Fuck Boy that G shit we breed that
Jussed drop that f-13, these hoes can't believe that
Got money in the bank, Got Money in the house
BMF nigga never heard about a drought
Getting to the paper ain't worried about a hater
Nigga talk too slick then tool in your mouth
Trees look good cause the bag packed up
COD cause when the bag packs up
Getting this money I stay with the hundreds
All hundreds everybody on staff racked up

[Hook: Bleu Davinci]
Hunnid thousand on me nigga what you gon do
Black bottles in my section what you wanna do
Told you we can make ya Dreams come true
Thats right This is a rich nigga walk-through
Hunnid thousand on me nigga what you gon do
Black bottles in my section what you wanna do
Told you we can make ya Dreams come true
This is a rich nigga walk-through
