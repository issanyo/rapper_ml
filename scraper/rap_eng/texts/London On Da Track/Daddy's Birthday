[Refrain]
A college dropout, i felt just like Ye
Learned not to listen to what peons say
I miss my daddy lost my daddy I ain't been the same
Just want some grands for my fam' you can keep the fame

[Verse]
Big money, like this wheel of fortune
Polo gang, I'm Frankie with these horses
Ralph Lauren, still on me y'all snoring
Number 1, top 40 under 40
They say I'm cocky
I'm just focused I can't let em stop me
These niggas plotting
Praying on the day my casket dropping
I see em watching
Sip my wok and then I watch em copy
Al lean like zombie
I was fucking ??? shawty
She wet tsunami
She gone blow me kamikaze
I work too hard need vacay in Abu Dhabi
Lil hoes screen-shotting
They need to work for paparazzi
And I'm gone ride just like Clyde need a Bonnie
I told my mamma I'm sorry for living wild safari
Great grandma hate tats on body i told her that its sharpie
These bitches vultures they ain't no ladies these bitches harpies
These bitches vultures they ain't no ladies these bitches harpies

[Refrain]
I'm Lil O.D. mixed wit Bodeine
My daddy and uncle showed me
My daddy and my uncle told me
That the win more important than the trophy

[Outro]
Every rhyme every sentence that I'm spitting
Get me closer to them dollars need a million
Plant my seeds grow my tree need 50 children
No I ain't tripping I'm just focused on my vision
