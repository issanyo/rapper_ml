[Intro: Verse Simmonds]
Good girls just wanna have fun
Need a drink? I'ma pour another up
Need a man? I'ma be what you want

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Good girls just wanna have fun
And party all night 'til the Sun comes up
And if you need a drink, I'ma pour another one
Baby, all night, we gon' get fucked up

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
There's some girls in this club that wanna have fun
It's gonna be a long night (show me what you feel like)
There's some girls in this club that wanna have fun
We gon' be goin' all night (all night), baby do whatever feels right

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
And oh, in case you didn't know, you're the one I want
Baby you stole the show
Oh, in case you didn't know, you ain't goin' home
'Cause the good girls, girls, 'cause the good girls, girls

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Good girls just wanna have fun
And party all night 'til the Sun comes up
And if you need a drink, I'ma pour another one
Baby, all night, we gon' get fucked up

[Bridge: Verse Simmonds]
I just wanna get next to somebody
She just wanna get next to somebody
I just wanna get next to somebody
She just wanna get next to somebody

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
There's some girls in this club that wanna have fun
Even if it's only one night, and girl you know we just might, one time
There's some girls in this club that wanna have fun
Yeah the pleasure's gon' be all mine, and we ain't gotta waste time, no

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
And oh, in case you didn't know, you're the one I want
Baby you stole the show
And oh, in case you didn't know, you ain't goin' home
'Cause the good girls, girls, 'cause the good girls, girls

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I won't need all night, all night, all night
I'm high off your love, no flight, no flight
When we break up, I swear your lil' spot I ride by
I really love you and didn't even try
I buy shots, then I pass 'em to the thots
Them long legs, I tie them bitches in a knot (come here, bitch)
I took that bitch in the bando then found her spot (eat it up)
I whip that dick out like, "Baby suck it or not" (suck it, suck it)
She ride it like an Australian go-kart
I'm takin' off in that pussy, watch, out the park
She look back like, "Throw them racks and start"
And she said, "I got a bus with bundles of bitches, let's ride"
She want molly, call my supplier
Feed that lil' bitch all the dick and
Make her hit a split, man on the flick, man
Baby all I was sayin' was...

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds + Young Thug]
Good girls just wanna have fun
(Good girls just wanna have fun)
And party all night 'til the Sun comes up
(Party all night, oh)
And if you need a drink, I'ma pour another one
(You're a single lady)
Baby, all night, we gon' get fucked up
(Buy you a round)
Good girls just wanna have fun
Good girls just wanna have fun
And party all night 'til the Sun comes up
We gon' party all night with it
Swear to God I wanna party all night with it
And if you need a drink, I'ma pour another one
We gon' throw a couple ones
Baby, all night, we gon' get fucked up
Baby we gon' have some fun with it
I swear to God I want some fun with it

[Outro: Usher + Verse Simmonds]
I'm just tryna get next to somebody
I just wanna get next to somebody
She just tryna connect with somebody
She just wanna get next somebody
If you wanna leave with somebody
I just wanna get next to somebody
Come here, baby let me be that somebody
