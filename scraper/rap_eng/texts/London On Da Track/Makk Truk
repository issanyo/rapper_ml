[Intro]
We got London On Da Track

[Chorus]
Makk Truk status, bulldozer
Everybody ran'd over
Front line shooter
Camouflage
Baby I’m a real soldier
That's my nigga so
Right or wrong
If you wrong I kill for him
Murda done hit me up
Through the phone let him know I still love him
Makk Truk status, bulldozer
Everybody ran'd over
Front line shooter
Camouflage
Baby I’m a real soldier
That's my nigga so
Right or wrong
If you wrong I kill for him
Murda done hit me up
Through the phone let him know I still love him

[Verse 1]
He off the yellow bar
School bus
[?]
[?] and leave you shit running [?]
Niggas hate you 'bout the wrong thing
I think its cause [?]
I got money from a long range, drop em off and pick em up
Big dog running round with no collar what's a pitbull to a pug
Clean em up like a great white, why these sharks eating all the fishes up
Only thing I got an appetite I just might be full enough
Few my niggas in the afterlife, but until then I got a vision for them
Oops I done caught him slipping, run him over I won't even show no pity for him
Coop steady tripping off them beans tryna find out where you living boy
All we know is murda murda kill kill [?]
Think he needa pop a chill pill but he screaming out [?]

[Chorus]
Makk Truk status, bulldozer
Everybody ran'd over
Front line shooter
Camouflage
Baby I'm a real soldier
That's my nigga so
Right or wrong
If you wrong I kill for him
Murda done hit me up
Through the phone let him know I still love him
Makk Truk status, bulldozer
Everybody ran’d over
Front line shooter
Camouflage
Baby I’m a real soldier
That's my nigga so
Right or wrong
If you wrong I kill for him
Murda done hit me up
Through the phone let him know I still love him

[Verse 2]
Makk Truk a nigga
Ray Lewis, leave him on a stretcher
I just got racks for to do it
Keep it coming Imma add a little extra
Put a little G9 to it
[?] like where the fuck the lettuce
[?] where the cooler freeze up on a nigga hell nah this bitch ain’t jumping
Talking bout no sandwich, peanut butter [?] for the clip, pussy look at the handle
Why shit dismantle, I was in the county [?]
Pussy boy to fragile, he don't wanna get any dirt on me, you know I am [?]
[?]
[?] but G9, woo, that's a whole nother animal
Bitch I got stamina, I was tryna go [?] but its time to go put a whole in another nigga on the calendar
[?]
[?]

[?]

[Chorus]
Makk Truk status, bulldozer
Everybody ran'd over
Front line shooter
Camouflage
Baby I’m a real soldier
That's my nigga so
Right or wrong
If you wrong I kill for him
Murda done hit me up
Through the phone let him know I still love him
Makk Truk status, bulldozer
Everybody ran'd over
Front line shooter
Camouflage
Baby I'm a real soldier
That's my nigga so
Right or wrong
If you wrong I kill for him
Murda done hit me up
Through the phone let him know I still love him
