[Intro]
Yeah, [?] Mason with London On Da Track
I got London with me now

[Verse 1]
I've been shining way too much, I should probably pack some shades
My life look more like a movie and your life more SMH
Never lying what I'm saying unless she asking where I stay
And I'm moving more than thinking, I don't plan to hit the breaks
I don't do this for my health, man I do it for the play
Wish I didn't have to eat but that free lunch a ways away
Dudes be talking like we fam but we never can relate
I'm the type to buy the bottle, you just do it for the taste
I'm too young to give a damn but way too old to let it waste
I got no time, I got no time, buy that rollie, bitch I'm straight
Might play Skizzy in some FIFA but I'm rarely playing games
Brought myself into success, now my life is takin' shape

[Hook]
Don't ever play yourself
Always just stay yourself
I see what they can't see
I be who they can't be
Don't ever look for help
Doing good by myself
I've been on my own line
If you feel that this your jam
This your jam
This your jam
I see what they can't see
I be who they can't be
I've been on my own line
If you feel that this your jam

[Verse 2]
They know I handle my business (my business)
We play for keeps, that's scrimmage (that's scrimmage)
You know I rep that 'tilly (that 'tilly)
But I got caviar with me
Them girls gonna say I'm feeling
I told them broads they silly
Solo dolo, I don't have the crew with me
So I face that joint and get with it

[Hook]
Don't ever play yourself
Always just stay yourself
I see what they can't see
I be who they can't be
Don't ever look for help
Doing good by myself
I've been on my own line
If you feel that this your jam
This your jam
This your jam
I see what they can't see
I be who they can't be
I've been on my own line
If you feel that this your jam

[Verse 3]
I've been duckin' way too much gave up thinking I'm out the shits
Contradicting my ambition every time I choose to chill
You ain't heard of me by now then tune that bullshit out your ears
You ain't heard of me by now then girl what rock you living in?
Underneath, not underground
From the bottom now we're here
And you know who holds it down, [?]
Man I'm tired of working, I feel like I'm doing this shit for the passion
I'm tired of hurting my pockets, need more, tryna cash in

[Hook]
Don't ever play yourself
Always just stay yourself
I see what they can't see
I be who they can't be
Don't ever look for help
Doing good by myself
I've been on my own line
If you feel that this your jam
This your jam
This your jam
I see what they can't see
I be who they can't be
I've been on my own line
If you feel that this your jam
