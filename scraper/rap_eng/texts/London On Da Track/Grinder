[Word Play]
Baby pass me the grinder
Baby pass me the grinder
Baby pass me the grinder
Eyyy, baby just pass me the grinder, yeah!

[Verse 1: Word Play]
Word Play the don
I'm a Lou nigga and I'm from Ferguson
Smoking with my main and she wetter than a pond
Killing every track, need Willy B to pay the bond
I'm a stoner by the way
And I got these hoes geeking off some ecstasy
Doing shows, making videos, don't you see?
I'm at the top of the game, that's meant to be
Fuck out of here saying you're better than Tonio
Yo career gon go where them cigarello guts go
And I'll take your girl quick, like I run the hundo
Bang her real good, walking like she got Polio
My new plug is me, only me! I
Can't rely on nobody else for the tree
Bruh, I'm higher than Apollo 13
Aye Q, sprinkle that kief on this GB

[Chorus: Word Play]
Someone pass me my grinder
Someone pass me my grinder
Someone pass me my grinder
Eyyy, someone just pass me my grinder, yeah
Someone pass me the grinder
Eyyy, Someone pass me the grinder
Eyyy, Someone pass me my grinder
Pass me my grinder, pass the grinder, pass the grinder!

[Verse 2: Tha Boy C-Rock]
Girl you need to throw that, you know I got that sticky-icky
I got her grinding on me, good looking Pretty Ricky
Biggest ass best, 'cause you know the boy picky
She love blowing and sucking, she tryna give my dick a hickie
Okay, I be tryna roll up
I pulled out the shotgun, but I swear she had me held up
Pass me the grinder, with that kush scent on your fingers
Boy that's suspicious like a tough guy with a girly ringer
Shit, fuck that, boy I got that real thrax
I'm grocery, they closed, oh fasho these niggas will tax
[?] having cooking full meals, you can't just pack a lunch
You be taking less hits, you swear the blunt was packed a punch
You can call me the kush king
I smoke and treat the kush like a little fling
Blown as fuck, damn right I'm on that high shit
Man I swear I be higher than Team Rocket!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Willy B]
Somebody pass me the grinder. Somebody pass me the grinder
Yeah, I'm a slide up behind her
Roll up a blunt, and I'm a blind her
With all this smoke, yeah
Bitch you better not fucking choke, yeah
What you gon do, deep throat? Yeah
Smoking all night, oh-woah, yeah
Pass me the grinder, yo
Pass me the grinder, yo
Pass me the grinder, yo, yo, yo!
Last week, I think I smoked an ounce
Maybe not, I can't count
Bring it back, we gon bounce
Back to your crib, smoke an ounce, damn

[Chorus]
