Dunkin' in that bra like I'm LeBron

I wanna fuck you on the bleachers, when we were in school (ahh)
Nigga, been dream, dreamin' of fuckin' on you (no lie)
I beat it 'til she don't want no more (she don't want no more)
When she say stop, you gotta go slow (then you just gotta go slow)
And I'm in that water like a tadpole (tadpole)
Started seein' white stuff, call it egg yolk (uggh-uh)
And she say it's big, but she not scared though (scared though)
And I pull her wig on the back board (back board)
And I got the stick by the back door (hey)
And I'm 'bout to stuff it through her backbone
