Show me groupie love, show me groupie love
I'm looking like the plug, I'm looking like the plug
Show me groupie love, show me groupie love
I'm looking like the plug, I'm looking like the plug
Show me groupie love

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Smoking on the Granddaddy like it's hookah
Stack the paper tall baby like Manute
Under the mattress, foreign actress in the Uber
All my riders aim the oompa, riders young shooters
You tryna start
Got my mind racing, Wraith double parked
Smoking on the Bob Marley like a Wailer
Pull up to the club looking like a dealer
Every time tryna curse, she ain't tryna leave
Hold your breath for us to flop, you'll never breathe
Carbon fever, I don't wanna need her
AP from Geneva, I came with a Visa
I pull up in foreign cars, baby chopped doors
Fully loaded cause them diamonds cost
Get lit, count money all day now
From the cars to the boat to the plane now
Gon' see the same faces on the way down
Gon' stand up or lay down

[Hook: French Montana]
Groupie love, show me groupie love
I'm looking like the plug, I'm looking like the plug
Show me groupie love, show me groupie love
I'm looking like the plug, I'm looking like the plug
Show me groupie love

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Quavo!)
Your hoe show me groupie love
She say she really not a groupie, she say she really never do this
Tom Cruise, make a movie, pussy water like jacuzzi
Double cup, purple fluid, getting head to my music
Yo, yo yo, she wanna fuck Migos Montana, lil' bitch
Say yo, if three of them wanted me, three of them know it ain't fair
She never did perc and I asked her, she wanna say yea
I'm only in town for one night, baby this dick rare
You wasn't there when I met the plug
50 bands in a white bag
50 bands in white bag
Move the work in a white Jag
Every other city we go, we go
Every other city we go, we go
No matter where I go, I see the same ol' hoe
I came from kickin' in doors, in the bando juggin' bowls
My life really was a movie, groupie love, nigga need some more
And when I'm geekin' don't blow a nigga
She talk about it, better show a nigga
She wanna Snapchat and take a picture
I took her phone and put her on a mission

[Hook: French Montana]
Groupie love, show me groupie love
I'm looking like the plug, I'm looking like the plug
Show me groupie love, show me groupie love
I'm looking like the plug, I'm looking like the plug
Show me groupie love
