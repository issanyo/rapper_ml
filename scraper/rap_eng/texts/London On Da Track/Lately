[Intro: Derez De'Shon & Kodak Black]
Oh, woah-oh
Oh
I'm in London, got my beat from London

[Chorus]
Lately, I ain't focused on things that stress me
Tryna separate from niggas who really ain't progressin'
Takin' no heed, no opinion from niggas who ain't helpin'
Tryna make it out before my whole hood land on stretchers

[Verse 1]
It's crazy, crazy
How money make the whole world change in 30 days
I don't even know that bitch, yeah
She already want a wedding ring
But if I wasn't who I am today, would you still be the same?
Would you say yes?
If you met me in McDonald's, would you give me a chance?
If I DM'd you my number, would you send me a text?
Long as you turn it all down like I'm on the red
Lately, shit been a lil' crazy
Neck look like a glacier (Uh)
Ridin' 'round in a spaceship
Got stars in the ceilin', you can see it
Bought a Lamborghini, I ain't seein' y'all
If I ever said I love you, swear I mean it
I ain't got the time or patience to believe or figure out

[Chorus]
'Cause lately, I ain't focused on all things that stress me
Tryna separate from niggas who ain't progressin'
Takin' no heed of opinions from niggas who ain't helpin'
Tryna make it out before my whole hood land on stretchers
Lately, lately, lately
Lately, lately, lately

[Verse 2]
Shots rang out, I get a missed call
Niggas got shot, lost another one of my dawgs
I'm so sick and tired of funerals
When your time come, only God knows
God knows, I've been ridin' with dirty straps with no lights on
Last time I seen Dunk, we shine lights on
Last time I seen Jump was on Old National
Lately
I ain't been the same me
And money didn't change me
But pain made me everything I am
Learned from my losses, took my years like a champ
Candle wet, drippin' on these crosses when I'm prayin'
I'ma live the life of boss, look what it cost to be the man

[Chorus]
Yeah, 'cause lately, I ain't focused on all things that stress me
Tryna separate from niggas who ain't progressin'
Takin' no heed of opinions from niggas who ain't helpin'
Tryna make it out before my whole hood land on stretchers
Lately, lately, lately
Lately, lately, lately
