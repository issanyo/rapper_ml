[Verse 3: Skateboard Skooly]
I'm on my ratchet shit, check my fashion, bitch!
This shit ain't average, immaculate
Just sip and step and wreck it
When I step in shit, most definite
You know these hoes like it when they see a nigga
Biting it when they see it!
Check my sprite, its Easter pink (slow down!)
And woahhhh, they're looking at me twice when they see me
Put my pay check with my strikes
I rock the Nike with Adida
GBE my people, and FreeBandz them my folk
Now one two to the six hoes, I'm rocking with the los
Ratchet shit, always saying ratchet, bitch
Smoking out the pack, vacuum seals in the back and shit
We do with extravagance, something you never heard of
Saddle game murder, shoe game murder!
