[Intro]
Hm, only thang you see is money man
Wise man told me that
Rich, Homie, Quan
True story
Everything I rap about
For real for real

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling myself but I'm so conceited
They sleeping on Homie they temperpedic
Get some flavour these niggas but I'm so heated
Lil shawty feigning for Homie I know she need it
Lil shawty claim that she riding I wanna see it
Lil shawty claim that she bout it I wanna see it
If I get locked up I know my niggas gon' free me
My nigga London from London we overseas with it
I don't want that freak bitch my nigga imma let he hit that
I don't keep no secrets cos all my niggas know what's up
If you see what's up you know what's up
Four cups how we rolling up
Feeling like Dwight Howard with these hoes, how I'm posted up
In the condo bitches you know mine the baddest
She don't like wear tennis shoes all they drink classic
She gon' hold it down do whatever for daddy
And my lil bitch is that baddest lil nigga ain't bragging
I remember I was walking now I got like 8 cars
Playing on the piano like a nigga Ray Charles
Been through a whole lotta shit nigga face scars
And that boy a TMZ I'll slap it from a hoe
And I know them folks ain't seeing me imma do it till im gone
Came a long way from apartments I done bought me first home
Came a long from them men now, all I smoke is strong
And I'm tryna do it big
Ooooh, boy I do it for my kid
I can't take back the shit I did
But it is what it is
Why that bitch pussy pink like a pig
I'm just tryna find the way I'm feeling
Ooooh, I got money to the ceiling
You must be deaf if you cannot hear this
My bool thang know that I love them piercings
I love that lil shawty style that shit the weirdest
I'll be her medicine if she need healing
Think before you speak you sound silly
If I lose trial I'm gon' appeal it
No glasses you can't see me
I'm playing the piano like I'm Stevie

I bet you wondering what I'm taking

[Verse 2]
I just gotta bad bitch, she don't talk no English
And my car go real fast I hit that gas and I leave
And I'm scared of water but I'll rock your boat like Aaliyah
Shawty know that I won't ever go she know that I ain't gon leave her
I'm on a Michael Jackson beat it
I, promise to tell none of your secrets
And I, won't move unless you give me a reason
Promise I, won't stop on her till I stop breathing
I got something that I wanna tell you but I don't know how to say it
Cause when you come around I swear I get shocked and I don't know how to play it
Hold me tight like we riding on a motorcycle
You give me life every time I see your pretty face
Give me a night and I promise you'll wanna spend your every day with me
My niggas got my back, I know they'll do whatever
I be like a rat when niggas mention that cheddar
Like Usher I got it bad, I would've skeeted and chilled
You niggas, least cause
I, can't forget about T-buzz
Got a scar under my left eye, my pants be Dior
I'm the only nigga in first class with my feet up
I just want the money like a crooked preacher
These niggas don't get it
Bullets adjust to your head nigga like a fitting
I'm drinking lean like I'm sick
How can I be broke when my first name Rich?
Homie, Quan. Gone
