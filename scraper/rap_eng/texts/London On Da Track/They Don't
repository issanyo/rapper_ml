[Intro: Reese LAFLARE]
I'm thinking about Miami right now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They still don't believe you
When you say you ain't fuckin' nobody
But me (We got London On Da Track)
They still don't believe you (you)
When you say you ain't fuckin' nobody
But me
I don't blame 'em at all (I don't blame 'em shawty)
'Cause you been hanging out with the wild ones (I don't claim you shawty)
Still hopin' that you ain't a wild one (ain't a wild one)
Niggas out feeling like a nigga just found
But they don't believe (hey, whoa)

[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE]
Baby went tell me how she feel
She been fuckin' with me for the deal
Fucked a new bitch, you wanna chill
I just wanna smoke away my problems
Shawty shotgun, she all about the thrill
So bad I might just go fuck a mill off
Baby girl one in a million
[?], I'ma tell you how I feel now
I just want to give you what you want, want, want
Lame ass hoes talkin' wah wah wah
Pull up on you, tell you this nigga ain't shit
You don't be trippin', you know these hoes ain't shit
Even though I'm a rock and roller
Big [?] you know I get my roll on
She stay checkin' for me, timeline get her scroll on
Courtsideâ€‹ when I was winning, we gonna get our ball on
And if they still don't believe, girl
I'ma give you what you needin'
And if they still don't believe, girl
I'ma give you what you needin'

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They still don't believe you
When you say you ain't fuckin' nobody
But me
They still don't believe you (you)
When you say you ain't fuckin' nobody
But me
I don't blame 'em at all
'Cause you been hanging out with the wild ones (you been hanging out with the wild ones)
Still hopin' that you ain't a wild one (still hopin' that you ain't a wild one)
Niggas out feeling like a nigga just found
But they don't believe

[Bridge: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
But girl I believe you
Girl I believe you

[Verse 2: Reese LAFLARE]
They don't believe you, no
They don't believe in us
They don't really see it for you
That ain't love, don't be fooled
Playin' dumb, no need to
I'm the only one, no sequel
Down before, see the prequel
And that friend she with, that's me, too
Hit me with the place and I'ma pull up on you
Snapchat stories, yeah, you know they checkin' for us
That small talk pop big boy shit
That's my baby girl, she a fancy lil' bitch
She just wanna give me what I want, want, want
Shawty poppin' that shit, that wah wah wah
Niggas tried to flex, but it really ain't shit
Actin' like you got it, but it really ain't this
If they don't believe you, go give them a reason
South Beach, we faded, it feel like a dream

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They still don't believe you
When you say you ain't fuckin' nobody
But me
They still don't believe you (you)
When you say you ain't fuckin' nobody
But me
I don't blame 'em at all
'Cause you been hanging out with the wild ones (you been hanging out with the wild ones)
Still hopin' that you ain't a wild one (still hopin' that you ain't a wild one)
Niggas out feeling like a nigga just found
But they don't believe
At all
