[Intro: Anderson Paak]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Anderson Paak]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All I know is that I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard you gone get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)
At least these things I know (Yeah)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, man, one thing I know 'bout me is me (I know it)
I'm already knowin' and you might think that I'm already going
Looking at your phone, you see me call, you ignore it
Make me wanna call another whore up
My pimp kicking in, too high for this shit
Aye, man, them games you be playing, too fly for this shit
I die for this shit
And you don't really know that's what you got, do you?
And you don't really see the mirror once you got, do you?
See, you should never take advice from a person when they ain't gon' be affected by the outcome
And when you're looking at the life of a person
When you get a 100 million when you like such a person
If it was Sodom and Gomorrah would you look back?
If it was just me, you, the kids and the book bag
Especially if I told ya ass not to look back
Tomorrow brighter than the past, hate to see you turn to ash
Shawty, I don't play nothin', you've been A1, you my day one
You can't say shit, attention pay none to their opinion 'cause they be on
All that fake shit, I go take shit to the extreme
Fuss and fought 'bout, shit I thought 'bout
You and whoever it ain't shit to talk 'bout (Bitch)
Call you a bitch, then you just walk out

[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All I know is that I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gone get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I don't deserve you, lucky to have you
I hate to see you just walk away
Well, I know that it ain't gon' be
Cool with the game, you playing on me
So no more back and forth about this and that
No more tit for tat, what bitch is that? What nigga called?
You let a nosey broad get all in your head, well, fuck both of y'all
Ah, it's solid as it get now
I said, if I were to wait back
Tell me why every time I turn around
It look like you packing your shit and you're going on
But, shawty, going on, call her and she ain't got her phone on
Enjoy, hope you love that nigga
A sucker, sorry I never saw that nigga
Now I'ma have to tag me a hoe or two
Pour a pint to get my mind off the thought of you
Man, I'm just playin', you my mind, all I want you
And slow down, lil' mama, where you walking to?

[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All I know is that I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gone get now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Verse 3: Anderson Paak]
Promise when I make my first mill', we can take a train to the steakhouse
And promise when I get you this Chanel, you'll pawn that shit if I don't make bail
I know that I ain't that only one that believes
That when the money longer than a Grey Hound
Every body wanna see
But when it's time to gas that bitch, you niggas can't pay now
A hundred G's would get you thirty even
You always eatin' take-out
Told your ass to get a couple drinks, ohh, you order champagne now
Grand Marnier, now
Oh, you shopping everyday, now
Closet looking like a Louis V playground
Walking out the front door in the goddamn shoes I pay for
Damn, and I'm the one to blame now
Banana peel the whole bank account
I'm living with a ape now
She only want the cake now
Selfies, all you take, now
I'm selfish if I break now
I'm begging you to stay around 'cause you're

[Chorus: Anderson Paak & T.I.]
You walking off like that's it now
Talking all of that shit now
All I know is that I can't hear now
It can't get much worse than this now
Baby, how hard are you gone get, now?
How long are you gon' stick around?
When the money get low
It's like I never see your pretty smile
But at least I know (Ah, yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me
At least these things I know (Yeah)
The shit that I know about me, the shit that I know about me

[Outro: Dave Chappelle]
Nothing feels better than fighting and winning
