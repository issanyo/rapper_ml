We so deep in this bitch, we might drown
They want beef in this bitch, we got pounds
Don't make a peep in this bitch, not a sound X 2

[Kalueb]
Before you get beaten like some JBL's
And I keep that sack on me ja-Madden NFL
And I keep that ice on me no Puck No NHL
And I lead the beef in the streets, and bring the bread home
Yeah, and I don't play around but I'm still player
Rich Kidz's a gift from god but we give them hell
Call me paper boy, grab that check about the mail
I won't Gas they talking Shell
They want beef I got the scale

We so deep in this bitch, we might drown

I'm so high, I fuck around and kissing angels ass
Bless me with a chick, go and give me my ...ho
Wanna fuck these streets up but I'm too gigged up
So I feel like Sabo ho
Dark skin actress bitch, starts with by ...
Have you niggas... on Twitter I never act a bit
My pimp hands strong, I won't hesitate to slap a bitch
Cause ho we getting money, I won't cap a bitch

We so deep in this bitch, we might drown
They want beef in this bitch, we got pounds
Don't make a peep in this bitch, not a sound X 2

Soon as a motherfucker step up in the building
I'm killing him, you can that you dont see the camera flashing
A hundred d, we don't creep, we moving like we're water moving
Drowning the... I need a glass or more, for my hood...
Every nigga wanna get up in that...
But you don't make a sound or drown from the glass I pour
Thinking of taking already...
Every nigga with me on the bullshit
I murder ... free... the dynamo one
