[Verse 1: Skooly]
What?
Rich Kidz for life!
Hold up, Hold up
Look

She doing it & doing it & doing it well
Kicks, hair, jewelry & nails
Wanna splurge but I know I just met the broad
And she cool, but I'm feeling kinda skeptical

Took her ass home
Cause I thought that she was cool
Took her to the show
Even let het meet the crew
Shawty was the shit
Would've let her have my kids
But then
She stole something from the crib
And I'm like uhh...

[Hook]
Might look good
Might talk right
But you never turn a ho into a housewife
Might cook good
Might walk right
But you never turn a ho into a housewife
Might Lick good
What the top like
Don't you never turn a ho into a housewife
Be real, know that you was taught right
Don't you never turn a ho into a housewife
She doing it & doing it & doing it well [x3]
But you never turn a ho into a housewife

[Verse 2 Kaelub]
She say she got a man
But tonight I'm in her plans
I'm a go'on & fuck her like I did up in ten
Aye she a stripper ho
In high school was a nerd though
Doing whatever for that cash
But I still salute her though
Some got a shape like a stripper ass
Or I'm going all in like the city, smash
And she keep sweating me, she wanna make it last
Wake up in the morning
No breakfast but I break fast
And she know I'm hoodrich like scream and them
On the road to riches like Bentley rims
I'm a KD we ball like OKC
Might look good
Might talk good
But a OK one look good to me

[Hook]
Might look good
Might talk right
But you never turn a ho into a housewife
Might cook good
Might walk right
But you never turn a ho into a housewife
Might hit good
What the top like
Don't you never turn a ho into a housewife
Be real, know that you was taught right
Don't you never turn a ho into a housewife
She doing it & doing it & doing it well [x3]
But you never turn a ho into a housewife
