[Intro]
Got bout 7 grams in the trap
12 keep watching, forget what i said then

[Verse 1]
Do it in the trap by myself, ain't look back
Niggas wanna be me cause I don't cook crack
I bring that rap back, I'm 2Pac and Biggie
I bring that rap back, I'm 2Pac and Biggie
Back in 8th grade I had at least a whole ticket
My baby mama straight, she ain't got shit to worry about
I just went and bought a new Giuseppe, it just came out
No more red bottoms, I got (?) myself a pair
You never sold dope nigga where your trap at?
Know you wasn't there, I was in the apartments
Me and (?), we kept us a hotbox
Lil steel with me, freak (?) he (?)
Stifling up traffic
Cruising in that Bentley listening to that March Madness
I can make it happen in a minute, ask my daddy
These bitches so in love with all my fashion and my fabric

[Hook]
This that goal line, this that street shit
This that hold up, this that cheap shit
This that do that shit, this that talk that shit
This that Rollie gold on yellow bitch you doing this
This that goal line, this that street shit
This that hold up, this that cheap shit
This that do that shit, this that talk that shit
This that Rollie gold on yellow bitch you doing this

[Verse 2]
Know I wasn't tired, I bless you niggas every time
Never thinking twice, I try to know you every time
I was drinking and driving with that Glizzy on my side
Fish and tartar sauce, fucking piss 'em off
How you flexing on 'em?
How you pressing on 'em?
How you brush 'em off you?
I do this shit often
You on my shit list, I got my bitch with me
Niggas try to rob me, she gon' hit with me
Nigga what?

[Hook]
This that goal line, this that street shit
This that hold up, this that cheap shit
This that do that shit, this that talk that shit
This that Rollie gold on yellow bitch you doing this
This that goal line, this that street shit
This that hold up, this that cheap shit
This that do that shit, this that talk that shit
This that Rollie gold on yellow bitch you doing this

[Outro]
This that goal line, this that street shit
This that hold up, this that cheap shit
This that street shit, this that street shit
Out the mud
This that street shit, this that street shit
If you a thug
This that street shit, this that street shit
Nigga what?
This that street shit, this that street shit
Nigga what?
