[Intro]
Good
Good, good
Good good good, good good good
We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1]
Girl you know you mmh-mmh-mmh good like Campbell's
Can you blow the top off of me like a candle?
Can I fuck you in LA like we in Atlanta? (oh, no IG pic no)

[Chorus]
Girl you know I want you like the key to the Lambo
When I bust it you bust back at me like Rambo
I can tell you pigeon-toed without no sandal
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah (girl I need you)

[Verse 2]
I need you like the beat in my chest (in my chest)
I smoke on the best that come from the west (gas), side
Girl you like Lisa Lopez yeah, left, eye, eye eye eye

She go stupid on the head just like a tophat
You can hate but know the difference, you can't block that

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl I want you, girl I need you
Girl I'm looking for you and I see you
