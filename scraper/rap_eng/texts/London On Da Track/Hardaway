I be out after the street light (yeah), these niggas ain't bout that street life (no)
My block was hot before Lil Wayne was Tunechi, I ain't even kiss my baby g-night (mwah)

Before I rode with Gucci in the Mulsanne
Ran with ghostface killers, Wu-Tang (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I took a harder way
Didn't know how to sell crack I was givin' that hard away
So fucked up, I had to borrow a plate
