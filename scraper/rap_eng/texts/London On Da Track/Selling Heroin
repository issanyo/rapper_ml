[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I look like I'm sellin' heroin
Man, I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm so illegal
Man I just did a song with Sevyn, she say I'm streeter
Man, I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
This ain't a gimmick, it's an epidemic
I got that shit that'll bust your heart, make you get to itchin'
I got that shit that make a junkie walk from Mississippi
I got these bitches sellin' blood to get a fix in
Man she can't even find a vein to catch a drain
My niggas might hijack a plane to get to Cannes
I'm Gucci Mane, I feel like Sosa, Moet Mimosa
I got 'em smoking like a motor to meet the quota
This parking spot reserved for kingpins, it's reserved
I look like I just robbed a kingpin for 100 birds
Man come and holler at your boy, I got that boy
They know Guwop about his bills, LeSean McCoy

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I look like I'm sellin' heroin
Man, I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm so illegal
Man I just did a song with Sevyn, she say I'm streeter
Man, I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin

[Verse 2: Future]
Junkies at the front door, I got junkies at the back door
Got them niggas wrappin' dummies, I got niggas pullin' kick doors
I got hoes in Frisco, I got hoes live in the N.O
You want you a ho and you know we call that a demo
Came from out the section, stash a million in the Pinto
'69 Camaro, boy you remixin' a kilo
Look inside this barrel if you look into the peep hole
I just popped a tab and I keep that Dan Marino
I got European niggas pullin' heists, prino
I go Donald Trump when I'm lookin' for the c-notes
You get hit with pump if you fuckin' with the kilo
Lookin' at my wrist, man this shit should be illegal
(Like heroin, like heroin, like heroin)

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I look like I'm sellin' heroin
Man, I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm ssellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm so illegal
Man I just did a song with Sevyn, she say I'm streeter
Man, I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
I look like I'm sellin' heroin, I'm sellin' heroin
