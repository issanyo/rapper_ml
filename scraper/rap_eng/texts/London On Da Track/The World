[Intro]
Now it might just seem
But I know my eyes ain't tripping (nah)
My momma told me I'm a beast
We got London On Da Track
I know you don't feel another nigga
You couldn't ever be me
You're way too nice, lil' nigga (what?)
I know a nigga know me
And I'm pullin' up like a diaper, nigga (skrrt)

[Chorus]
I know the world (yah), I know the world against me
I know the world, I know the world against me
I know the world, I know the world against me
I know the wor-or-orld, I know the world against me
Oh, I know the world, I know the world against me
I know the world, I know the world against me
Feel like the world, feel like the world against me
I know the world, I know the world against me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, hol' on, I, I didn't mean to cut you off
But, I, I'ma gon ahead buy the car, uh
I'ma go ahead buy the bar, an', uh
I'ma go ahead buy your girl, an', uh
I'ma go ahead buy the world, an', uh
I'ma go ahead buy my little girl a home
Get into the club and throw a coupe
An' he wit' it if I'm right or wrong
That's why I respect this nigga named Troup
YSL, they gon' ride 'til I die
And they don't feel the same way about you
Nigga, stop playin' 'fore I pull up with them goons
And sit back while them pussy niggas sue
Ride on 'em, pussy nigga, got the top off of the bit'
I got the K, now watch you swoo
Niggas start hatin' on a young nigga gettin' that money, nigga
Pussy nigga really need a new job, ain't being funny, nigga?
I leave a big ol' hole right inside you, nigga, like some Funyuns, nigga (bop)
Now they got a crime scene, wrappin' niggas up like they mummies

[Chorus]
I know the world, I know the world against me (hey)
I know the world, I know the world against me (whoa)
Feel like the world, feel like the world against me
I know the wor-or-orld, I know the world against me
I know the world, I know the world against me
Feel like the world, feel like they're out to get me
I know the world, I know the world against me
I know the wor-or-orld (what, this nigga)

[Verse 2]
Let's meet up with them Ks and let's make a little noise
I pull up with some motherfuckin' generals, no war
She suck that dick, it taste just like some Skittles on my boy
I pull up an' I plug that motherfucker like a cord
Cops, snitchin', fuck it I'ma still record
I know Magic, make 'em go back there no more
Shoot slow, make 'em count these fuckin' bullets like a dork
Tall nigga bring 'em down just like a boy
Bring 'em down, yeah, bring 'em down
To my side, then I beat 'em like a fuckin' clown
I might pull up with multi' niggas an' call it now
Nigga, can't beat your [?], boy you work the million out (ha)
Pussy nigga, stop playin' 'fore I rob your ass
An' leave your ass assed out
Yeah, make a pussy nigga dance
Make 'em dance like them bands out
Make your bitch dance, buns an' her ass out
Hey, I leave your bitch hot with a fan out
Stop playin' 'fore I make it where you can't stand out
Both of us on the Molly, we can't eat nothin' else
Try dinner at Pappadeux
Yeah, he's not one with the clan, now
If you fuck with me, wipe his nose

[Chorus]
I know the world, I know the world against me
I know the world, I know the world against me
Feel like the world, sing like the world against me
I know the world, I know the world against me
Oh, I know the world, I know the world against me
Feel like the world, sing like the world against me
I know the world, I hope it's all to get me
I know the wor-or-orld, I know the world against me
I hope it's call comin'
