[Intro]
London on the track bitch!

[Hook]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money

[Verse 1]
I just want that money nigga
I don't give no damn about no fame
I just get that head and go
Plus that lil bitch got a pink pussy like a yam
I'll pop it I'll make that booty say bang bang
I'm icy so she failed to maintain her lane
I'm so priceless I swear to God I can't complain
No no no no I can't
I woke up with a smiling face
Lil shorty keep following like she down to play
I can't fill my truck up with no fucking strays
But I can fill it up with all my bass
And that's no lie that's no lie
I'm balling so hard I need Gatorade
Eat your candy now and later

[Hook]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money (I want racks)
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money (Bring me all the money)
I just want the money (I just want the money)
Bring me all my money (Uh)

[Verse 2]
My jewelry wet like water hose
I didn't buy no spinners I had stop and goes
Yeah I was tired started stopping goals
Used to rob for birds now I'm flocking those
Hell yeah nigga flock (Brrrrr!)
King cobra nigga watch
The P stand for players they eat pies
The B stand for bodies who wan' die? Hey!
Who wan' motherfucking die today today?
Bought a gold casket I killed him and paid
I swear I'm back in my John Dillinger ways
Go buy a milk carton he missing today
Get my cookie from San Fransisco Bay
It's time to start planning put on your game face
Godfather I killed them all in one day
I meant a whole dime at one time oh my

[Hook]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
