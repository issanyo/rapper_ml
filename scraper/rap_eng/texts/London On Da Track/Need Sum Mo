[Intro: Derez De'Shon]
Swear it seem like yesterday
I was eatin' ramen noodles off a plastic plate
I was really, but anyway
Judge just gave my brother Dreek 5 years today
Hurt to see his teared-up face
'Cause I gotta feel it play
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Derez De'Shon]
Damn, the streets need me (Me)
My son need me more (More)
Gotta give it all I got (I got)
I ain't have no other choice (I ain't have no other choice)
Tryna make it to the top
We from the bottom, we was poor
I need some more (I need some more)
I need some more, yeah (I need some more, yeah)

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Derez De'Shon
I was cursed and I was gifted at the same time
I was hurt and I was injured but I stayed down
Fourth quarter, two minutes, I can't waste time
Niggas dyin' before 2040, my white lie
'Cause I gotta be here for my son and daughters
Don't ever want them to go through what I been through, hard times that scarred me
Reminiscing when times was harder
We ain't have no light in the 'partments
Just a baby, was boilin' water
Long as the kids ate, I was fine with starvin'
Do you know the feeling when your mama askin' you to help with the bills?
But you can't help for real
But you still get what you give
I got partners locked up doin' bids
Some doin' life and some got a few years
Can't go to visit, it hurt just to see 'em
I'll do all I can 'til they free 'em

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Derez De'Shon]
Damn, the streets need me (Me)
My son need me more (More)
Gotta give it all I got (I got)
I ain't have no other choice (I ain't have no other choice)
Tryna make it to the top
We from the bottom, we was poor
I need some more (I need some more)
I need some more, yeah (I need some more, yeah)
I said the streets need me (They need me)
My son need me more (Me more)
Gotta give it all I got (I got)
I ain't have no other choice (No choice)
Tryna make it to the top
We from the bottom, we was poor
I need some more (More)
I need some more, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I got my money the harder way
Baby mama tryna take my lil' boy away
Man, you know what it was when you went this way
I got too many problems, I'm savin' face
I got too many lawyers for random cases
I'm addicted to lean, I been buyin' cases
I been goin' too hard, got these niggas hatin'
Bought a brand new AP, got a friend wan' date me
I keep fuckin' with her, I guess I can't shake it
I'll be goddamn wildin' when these niggas take me
Keep it real even though I know they was fakin'
Hold they nuts on me, they didn't want me to make it
Keep them young niggas with me, they still be takin'
Thankin' God that he bettered my situation
I can't wait to pull up and see nigga's faces
I can't go back to the basics

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Derez De'Shon]
The streets need me (Me)
My son need me more (More)
Gotta give it all I got (I got)
I ain't have no other choice (I ain't have no other choice)
Tryna make it to the top
We from the bottom, we was poor
I need some more (I need some more)
I need some more, yeah (I need some more, yeah)
I said the streets need me (They need me)
My son need me more (Me more)
Gotta give it all I got (I got)
I ain't have no other choice (No choice)
Tryna make it to the top
We from the bottom, we was poor
I need some more (More)
I need some more, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Said the streets need me
Said the streets need me
From the bottom, we was poor, I need some more
I need some more, yeah
I said the streets need me
Said the streets need me
Top, bottom, we was poor
I need some more, yeah, yeah
