I don't wanna roll in peace I
Smoke cones outta bongs till I fall asleep/ I don’t smoke cones discreet I smoke bongs till I'm dead and they call me deceased

Little cunt ciggy buts drinking outta henny cups
I got many buds
Frees on beats I trap with anyone
We thieve on the streets till they say keep it steady cunt

I reside in the West with bags of buds packed
A single stick the surrounds my nut-sack
Smoking outta the Gatorade like fuck that
You ain't a real rapper till you get a face tat (pfff)

Face that
Face facts
This ain’t a race keep pace where you based at
Women and liquor chilling in my main pad
They telling me to bust then saying i  need to stay back

Sick of bringing us down I'm going up
They hating us because we coming up
Coming up go down coz of drugs
I can't deal with these cunts that say I need to give it up

Bust it up you don't fuck shit up I roll around in a whip with my fingers up
But I'm over this shit
420 stoner with spliffs
I'm a loner who spits

I'm alone with the cones
I'm alone with the dope
I’m alone with my phone calling triple 0
I be spitting low
I be spitting writtens on a Rhythm When i gotta get it I duck and then I hit em
420 fam this a life that we living

[Hook]
Chill chill brudda I’m chill
I don't fuck with the fakes only fuck with the real


Sucking on a buegs
Telling the truth tryna win but the want me to lose
Drinking the booze
I’m drunk and confused
I spaz when I rap man I'm blowing a fuse
I don't need to pretend
I just do me
I fiend for the mic and my weapons a pen
Like a sword that I wield
I'd rather be dead
Then be with the fakes man I fuck with the real

Fuck a snake yeah
Fuck fake friends
420 fam chill I wanna   make trends
I don’t wanna make friends
I wanna make cash
Dash back it's spilling I wanna make tracks
Make stacks make racks
Wrapping in rubber bands I'm making these fans fall back


I wanna smoke bongs in peace leave me to be or leave me deceased
I don't wanna roll in peace i smoke cones while I'm working on a master piece

Man I'm just starting why you asking before I grab a pistol grip
This ain't Tekashi when you try pass me shit you get pistol whipped

But I'm eager to test
Wanna read with the best
Wanna kill all the rest
I would die for my bros chilling up in my nest
I would chill with my bros till my life ends

I said it like a hunnid of times I wanna vibe while I'm high
While the spliffs alight
For my bros ride or die
Till we hit that mile
Wanna rap my shit with that ambiguous style

I'm spitting alone in my room
Sucking these buegs
And I'm as high as a roof

Take time
Time flys
When I'm making records I wreck it at bass line

Chilling on the rhythm I kill em like I'm a villain
Making money coz I'm dealing
I roast em and then I grill em


I don't wanna roll in peace I
Smoke cones outta bongs till I fall asleep/ I don't smoke cones discreet I smoke bongs till I'm dead and they call me deceased
