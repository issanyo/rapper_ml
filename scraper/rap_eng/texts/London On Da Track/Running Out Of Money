[Verse 1 - T.I.]
I'll tell ya two things i ain't never been
A scared nigga and a dead nigga
I'll tell ya two thing i never did
Got run outta town or run outta bread nigga
Running in and outta the Feds fresh out the gate
Hit my homie on the line and told him get me some weight
I told him all i want was weed he said I'll give ya some yay
I said how much ya got? he said as much as it take
Balling hard and going fast I ain't touching the break
Like ion know the difference between the clutch and the break
But a couple hunnit bags left cause I'm getting more
Dope boy trap shit all a nigga know aye !
