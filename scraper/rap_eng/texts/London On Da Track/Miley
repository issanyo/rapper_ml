[Hook(2x): Waka Flocka Flame]
I’mma throw these bands (twerk)
Girl, clap that ass (twerk)
I’mma throw these bands (twerk)
Girl, clap that ass (twerk)
Girl bust it, break your back for a real nigga (twerk)
Girl bust it, break your back for a real nigga (twerk)

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
Booty shakin' contest, booty shakin' contest
Booty shakin' contest, booty shakin' contest
At my shows, I’m blowin' hoes, my haters catchin' contacts
At my shows, I’m blowin' hoes, my haters catchin' contacts

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Hold up! (Poppin' bands, poppin' bands)
Throw a, throw a, 'nother rack
If her booty flat, ass shots, I'll pay for that (turn up)
Ho so fuckin' big like where my neighbours at? (I’m flexin')
Hit the club, white tee, gold jewelry and a Falcon hat
Pussy so good I had to film that
For a dollar, friends like “where my feelings at?”
I’m a, I’m a, I’m a baller
Fuck her once and never ever, ever call her
You know her ass fat, we see her booty crack
With her jeans on, this her theme song
Money pile on her, fuckin' ringtone
Freakin' in the club with a million hoes

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Go on and bust it open for a real nigga
Left your man at home, he just a lil' nigga
Let you hit this pen and taste a little liquor
My name is on them bands like Tommy Hilfiger
I fuck my bitch then take her out and chill wit her
You get a model, don’t know how to deal wit her
Real nigga, so I’mma keep it real with her
That pussy so wet you 'bout to kill a nigga
I got weed, I got wax, shorty
Said she want them dollars, what you need?
I've got racks, I've got cribs, I've got plaques
I've got homegirl and her friend
Ass fat like the whole world in my hands
