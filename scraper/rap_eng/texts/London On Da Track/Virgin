[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
See my girlfriend is Italian and my car Italian too
Ferrari wagon with the stallion, I got on ten rose gold medallions
And plus Guwop eat racks for breakfast, bitch you know I dine with champions
Supercharge my old Camero, pull up and I'm smashing it
Watch, chain, ring, Lil Darryl I got a retarded wrist
The rings and bracelets Jackie Chan 'cause man they do karate kicks
All my hoes wear body suits and all my cars got body kits
And yeah I got, ain't fucked about and I don't care nun bout a bitch
Catch you at the drive-through, put that pistol on, you take your shit
He said I'm just a black brother like, what you try to kick some knowledge, nigga
Matter of fact order, double deck, a double stack with cheese, bitch
And if you pull a trick and blow my lick then I'm a squeeze, bitch

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Shoot a snitch leaving court like nino, dolce and Gabana tuxedo
Garbage bag full of cheese, got a big bag of Cheetos
Hit them with that 50 cal, two times, pair of free-throws
Live from Castalia in my trap with a pair of freak hoes
These pistols right here, they fuck anybody, they some freak hoe
Thousand dollar scraps, nigga, I don't fuck with cheap hoes
Your bitch a freak for certain, me and my niggas working
Never let a nigga fuck me out my money, I'm a virgin
Hood rich nigga but I still eat Church's
That hoe ain't getting no money, don't need her around me 'cause she worthless
What you mean that hoe ain't a virgin, Thug
Long as she help me sell this bud
Then she said she bust 100 time, that's a 100 slugs

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Last verse, should've went first hearse
Talking slick, get your fucking gums burst
These bitches, they turning that green, just like fucking turf
These bitches, they give me massages, like a fucking nurse
1017 and that Cocaina
All my bitches smell like flowers, just like lotus
Calm down, stand down, man down
Ambulance at the circus, dead clown
I'm a rich nigga, but my bitch booty big like burgers
I've been serving, so you know my scrap ain't no virgin
I sneak a bitch a molly ollie that's her main purpose
She got a 25 like Christmas inside of her purse
