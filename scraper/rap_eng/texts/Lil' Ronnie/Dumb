I was so dumb dumb dumb
I was stupid foolish foolish foolish
I was so dumb dumb, dumb dumb
All I did

I've been doin some thinkin
About the shit I've done to my past
Even though I was cheatin'
I can't give up on what I once had
It was special
And I want it back

I will give you the whole wide world
Just for you to come back girl
Girl you're still gon need love
'Cause I already know

I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a
I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a
I was stupid, I was foolish
To do anything to hurt that girl
I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a

Never thought I would get caught
Never thought you'd pick up that call
I shouldn't left at all
I tried everything to mend your heart

'Cause you got something baby
Better than what this life can bring
And I'll give everything to have you back, girl I want you back

I will give you the whole wide world
Just for you to come back girl
Girl you're still gon need love
'Cause I already know

I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a
I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a
I was stupid, I was foolish
To do anything to hurt that girl
I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a

Girl you know I'm tryin to be what you want and whatever you need this time
But this time I know I let you down
But we can only go up from here

I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a
I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a
I was stupid, I was foolish
To do anything to hurt that girl
I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a

Dumb dumb dumb
I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a
I was stupid, foolish
To do anything to hurt that girl
I was dumb dumb dumb
I was a
