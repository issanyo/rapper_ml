She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let er
She's a hoooome wrecker

I fucked up, no she wasn't bout nothing
She was cool and shit, quick to give up and...
Who would've known that it would last this long

My whole intention was to hit and keep it movin
But she was a pro, get it girl, knew what she was doin
I had it made
A wifey at home and a side chick to play with, yea
Something changed and now she actin crazy
Blowin up my phone, knowin I'm here with my baby
Said if I don't come over then she gonna tell my lady
And it's fuckin shady, says she pregnant with my baby
She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let er
She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let er
She's a hoooome wrecker

Long rides out of town on the weekend
She was cool with hooking up every other weekend
She said she appreciate the honesty
And that's the reason that she fucks with me

When my girl call she would be quiet
Rubbin on my arms, listenin to me lyin
She said I'm ain't gon be yo main you see?
Long as you keep it between us three
Something changed and now she actin crazy
Blowin up my phone, knowin I'm here with my baby
Said if I don't come over then she gonna tell my lady
And it's fuckin shady, says she pregnant with my baby
She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let er
She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let er
She's a hoooome wrecker

She is cool when it's cool but it all goes bad
When a girl catches feelings
And now let go of what you had, it's a thing of the past
Throw it all out the window

And I know I was wrong, ain't no pussy
That is worth losin your woman
And I hope I learned my lesson
Almost lost what I had
She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let er
She is a home wrecker
But it's my fault I let er
She's a hoooome wrecker

She's a home wrecker, she's a home wrecker
