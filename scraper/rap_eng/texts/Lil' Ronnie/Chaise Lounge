[Verse 1]
Honey I ain't been doing well
I've been out of town, you've been out the country
Missing seeing you and me around
And now your arms here when their around me
You walk through the door (feeling of fire)
Looking finer than before (hope you retire)

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby drop your luggage on the floor
We won't make it upstairs
And you know the kids are down
Let's settle on this chaise lounge

[Chorus]
Boy take em off, take your clothes off
I don't wanna wait, lovin' here to me, I just wanna say
Boy take em off, take my clothes off
You're a giver, I'ma take
Have it your way, nothing else to say
But take it off

[Verse 2]
Sugar we don't need a room or bed, that's what your legs for
Baby don't worry bout the noise, that's what the door's for
And we don't need much, just you and your touch
It's wearing me down down, wearing me down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby drop your luggage on the floor
We won't make it upstairs
And you know the kids are down
Let's settle on this chaise lounge

[Chorus]
Boy take em off, take your clothes off
I don't wanna wait, lovin' here to me, I just wanna say
Boy take em off, take my clothes off
You're a giver, I'ma take
Have it your way, nothing else to say
But take it off

[Verse 3]
Get stuck in my way
Body free, the weight of me
Like good love on me
Bout to show you just how I feel about you

[Chorus]
Boy take em off, take your clothes off
I don't wanna wait, lovin' here to me, I just wanna say
Boy take em off, take my clothes off
You're a giver, I'ma take
Have it your way, nothing else to say
But take it off
Boy take em off, take your clothes off
I don't wanna wait, lovin' here to me, I just wanna say
Boy take em off, take my clothes off
You're a giver, I'ma take
Have it your way, nothing else to say
But take it off
