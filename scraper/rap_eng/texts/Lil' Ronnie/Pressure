[Verse 1]
Been together for a while now
I think we know each other's style now
And we've only figured out how
How to hold each other down now
But I don't want you to get comfortable
I just wanna know you love me
And I think I want that on the regular
So you know that ain't thirsty, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it looks good on the surface
But I gotta know we're movin' with a purpose
I know it ain't easy but it's worth it
It ain't easy but I'm worth it
I am so in love, I ain't complaining
I ain't in no rush, baby, I'm just saying

[Chorus]
Girls like me you keep forever
No more searching, it gets no better
No pressure, no pressure, no
No pressure, no pressure, no
But I ain't gonna wait forever
Lurking since we've been together
No pressure, no pressure, no
No pressure, no pressure, no

[Verse 2]
I know you probably think I'm tripping
Probably think there's something missing, but no
You sounded like a premonition
But, baby, I just had a vision, oh
I'm not gonna be the one to push you to the altar
All you gotta do is lead me, baby
And I'ma follow

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it looks good on the surface (I know it looks good)
But I gotta know we're movin' with a purpose
I know it ain't easy but it's worth it
It ain't easy but I'm worth it (It ain't easy)
I am so in love I ain't complaining
I ain't in no rush, baby, I'm just saying

[Chorus]
Girls like me you keep forever
No more searching it gets no better
No pressure, no pressure, no
No pressure, no pressure, no
But I ain't gonna wait forever
Lurking since we've been together
No pressure, no pressure, no
No pressure, no pressure, no

[Bridge]
It ain't like I'm worried or in a hurry
But I gotta know I'm not wasting my time
You could have it all or you could lose it all
Baby, it's your cause
You know that I'm what you are

[Chorus]
Girls like me you keep forever (keep forever)
No more searching it gets no better (gets no better, babe)
No pressure, no pressure, no
No pressure, no pressure, no (no, no pressure)
But I ain't gonna wait forever (wait forever, babe)
Lurking since we've been together
(I see you looking, see you looking)
No pressure, no pressure, no (no, no)
No pressure, no pressure, no (no, no)
Girls like me you keep forever (keep forever)
No more searching it gets no better
No pressure, no pressure, no
No pressure, no pressure, no (no, no)
But I ain't gonna wait forever (I ain't gonna wait forever)
Lurking since we've been together
No pressure, no pressure, no
No pressure, no pressure, no

[Outro]
So take your time, but hurry up
