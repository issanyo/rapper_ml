I feel like poor kid
It just keeps calling my name
Tryin to get in touch with my connect
But I feel like they stopping me yeah
All I'm trying to find is another high that I can get
Oh

I need to get something that's gonna take me away
Make me feel like I'm floating outta space
Without it I just might go insane
This addiction has made me a slave so I'm

Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)
Chasin
(Runnin, runnin, runnin, runnin)
Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)
Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)

They call me crazy
They say I'm losing my head
Oh, but if I don't get this fixed
The next thing they'll call me is dead
I ain't talking about narcotics, no love didn't do this
I'm talking about my music, yeah I need a hit

Get something that's gonna take me away
Make me feel like I'm floating outta space
Without it I just might go insane
This addiction has made me a slave so I'm

Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)
Chasin
(Runnin, runnin, runnin, runnin)
Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)
Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)

Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)
Chasin
(Runnin, runnin, runnin, runnin)
Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)
Chasin
(Chasin, I'm chasin, I'm)

Get something that's gonna take me away
Make me feel like I'm floating outta space
Without it I just might go insane
This addiction has made me a slave so I'm chasin

Chasin
