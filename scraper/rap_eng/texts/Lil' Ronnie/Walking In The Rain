Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh!
I met this girl she was oh so cute, pretty brown eyes with her face so oooh. Thicker than a block of that government cheese! A down ass broad just what i need. That stuck by my side through the thick and thin, see we was Bonnie and Clyde all over again. In retrospect to all that she earned the finest things. Like diamond rings see i fulfilled your dreams. I bought you Dolce and Cabanna, crocodile Prada, Cartier frames with the all gold liners. Special designer! Cuz you was down with me, the type that go the whole 12 rounds with me. To the ground with me, or to the clouds with me. And let you lounge with me in my home, until i heard another nigga on my phone

Hello, you still there?
