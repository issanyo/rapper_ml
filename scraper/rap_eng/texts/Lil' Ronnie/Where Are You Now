Now I usually don't do this
But sometimes you bring out the best and you bring out the worst
And I don't know just how to say it, no
But I wish I knew you better

Sometimes I think you got a hang for me
But I just don't wanna believe
That you have that much hate towards me

Oh love
Where are you now?
I tried to hold on to, never resented you, told me that you do
You're not around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

I tried to GPS you but I oh oh
It said there was no address found
And every time I'd need you, you are nowhere to be found

I thought I knew you better yea yea
But that just shows me how much I know that I want you
You know that you want me
I thought you'd be here for life

Oh love
Where are you now?
I tried to hold on to, never resented you, told me that you do
You're not around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

If you had any heart you'd reach for me
Despite of how I feel I'd do the same
'Cause I need you
'Cause you're the missing piece to
My happiness

So don't wait another minute
I've been fairly even without you
So I'm runnin to ya
Please and wish me luck

Oh love
Where are you now?
I tried to hold on to, never resented you, told me that you do
You're not around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
