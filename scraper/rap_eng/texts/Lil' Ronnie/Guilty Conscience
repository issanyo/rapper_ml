Who the fuck is texting you right now?
Tell me what friends gonna hit you at this hour?
Girl why the hell you turn your ringer off? I'm just asking
Since when did you start wearing all that make-up?
Tell me where the hell you going in them heels? Only supposed to be going to the market, I'm just asking
Is she lying, is she lying, is it true?
Could it be I'm blaming her for what I do?
Can't ever have the thought of her fucking another nigga, but I guess it shouldn't matter
It's my guilty conscience, guilty conscience
Its funny how the table turn, maybe I deserve to hurt
Its my guilty conscience, guilty conscience
Its funny how the tables turn, maybe I deserve to hurt
What goes around comes right back around
I hope what I'm feeling it ain't true
If I were you I'd been left me by now, all the dirty shit I've done to you
Now she's a good girl , and no she wouldn't do that to me
Because I did it to her, my mind is playing tricks on me
Is she lying, is she lying, is it true?
Could it be I'm blaming her for what I do?
Can't ever have the thought of her fucking another nigga, but I guess it shouldn't matter
It's my guilty conscience, guilty conscience
Its funny how the table turn, maybe I deserve to hurt
Its my guilty conscience, guilty conscience
Its funny how the tables turn, maybe I deserve to hurt
Is she cheating? Like I'm cheating?
Do she be fucking that nigga?
Like I be fucking them bitches?
Do that nigga be laying up in my house?
Like I be laying in them other bitches house?
Do she be freaking? Do she be sneaking?
Is it karma , got me thinking?
Cause I know that I been in the wrong, is it all my fault?
It's my guilty conscience, guilty conscience
Its funny how the table turn, maybe I deserve to hurt
Its my guilty conscience, guilty conscience
Its funny how the tables turn, maybe I deserve to hurt
Baby, oh I deserve it
Oh, oh, oh
Yeeah, my guilty... conscience baby
