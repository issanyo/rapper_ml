[Chorus]
I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind
Yeah, I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind
Every day, every hour
Every second, every minute
Every single thought, I be in it
I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind

[Verse 1]
In the morning I wake up
Ain't gotta put on no makeup
And the natural life is there
This game of love is easy just to lay out
Everyday I'm on his remembering
He's similar with crazy out driving insane, yeah
And when we get together we be losing track of time
All day, all night, I be always on his mind

[Chorus]
I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind
Yeah, I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind
Every day, every hour
Every second, every minute
Every single thought, I be in it
I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind

[Verse 2]
And he can't help it at all
I be loving all these kisses 'cause his lips are so soft
Looking in his eyes I get lost
And everything else is an afterthought, yeah
No, it don't matter who he close to
Checking on his bae like he's supposed to, yeah yeah
'Cause he knows that I'm his go to
And I got his wheel spinning like some babies on a six two
How many ways can I say?
It's not just a phase, he wants me to stay
I'm always on his brain

[Chorus]
I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind
Yeah, I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind
Every day, every hour
Every second, every minute
Every single thought, I be in it
I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind

[Bridge]
When he go to sleep with the moonlight
Or in the morning with the sunshine
I be on his mind
Right before his dinner or his lunchtime
You can bet I, I be on his mind
And right before he leave the house
I be on his mind
Coming in or living out
I be on his mind
Whether in the East Coast Time or in the West Coast Time
You know you on his mind say "I be on his mind"

[Chorus]
I be always on his mind (I be)
I be always on his mind (always on his mind)
Yeah, I be always on his mind (I be always on his mind)
I be always on his mind (always on his mind)
Everyday, every hour, every second, every minute
Every single thought, I be in it
I be always on his mind
I be always on his mind
