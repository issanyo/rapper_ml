[Intro]
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do

[Verse 1]
You say what you want
And do what you like
That's why you're all in my mind
Think you'll be there for life
You'll be pressing my buttons
Then undressing my buttons
I swear mom I just lost
Then we lay down with nothing
Boy you got something
On me, boy just keeping love
On me, loving on me

[Chorus]
Boy don't waste no time, I'm yours
(Work my body, work work my body body)
Ain't no love that's on my mine but yours
(Work my body, work work my body body)
Ain't nobody do my body do my body body
Like you do, like you do
I met a couple guys but they don't know my body
Like you do, like you do
They way you making it talk, I can hear you get louder
The way you putting down, your daddy would be prouder
Ain't nobody do my body do my body body
Like you do, like you do

[Verse 2]
Get a night on the town
Hearing the band
We just gone a way out
But we'll stay here instead
We'll be playing this record
Keep the moment progressing
Take it all the way down
Take it all the way down
Give me all that or nothing
Baby you're up to something
Take it all the way down
Take me all the way down

[Chorus]
Boy don't waste no time, I'm yours
(Work my body, work work my body body)
Ain't no love that's on my mine but yours
(Work my body, work work my body body)
Ain't nobody do my body do my body body
Like you do, like you do
I met a couple guys but they don't know my body
Like you do, like you do
They way you making it talk, I can hear you get louder
The way you putting down, your daddy would be prouder
Ain't nobody do my body do my body body
Like you do, like you do

[Bridge]
You got that real
And I'm fabricated
This love, so glad we made it
Oh, so keep my space arrayed
Baby, give me you
That's all I want
Give me plenty you
That's all I want
Ain't nobody

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody do my body do my body body
Like you do, like you do
I met a couple guys but they don't know my body
Like you do, like you do
They way you making it talk, I can hear you get louder
The way you putting down, your daddy would be prouder
Can't nobody do my body do my body body
Like you do, like you do

[Outro]
Can't nobody do my body, can't nobody do my body
Like you do, like you do
Can't nobody do my body, can't nobody do my body
Like you do, like you do
Can't nobody do my body, can't nobody do my body
Like you do, like you do
Can't nobody do my body, can't nobody do my body
Like you do, like you do
