[Intro: Ashanti & R. Kelly]
Written Entertainment, Ashanti
Girls, I gotta get this one off my chest
Listen, Baby

[Verse 1: Ashanti]
Now I’ma look through your phone
And I’ma call back that number
I’ma curse out that hoe, and let her know to stay away from you
Cause that’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do

I may accuse you a little, and go through your jeans
When I don’t find anything, all that it means is that
I love you, don’t want her touching you
Don’t wanna fucking you, yeah, cause that’s what we do
I may get a little jealous, take you away from the fellas
Cause I want your time, and I’m all over you that night
Cause that’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do

I may blame you for something, and don’t want to apologize
Ima climb in that bed, and show you I’m sorry
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]
Through the storm, through the rain
Through the heart ache, and pain
We fight, we fought, won side by side, we survived
When your chance has come back, and the royal stuff, going round
We fuss, we fought, we fault all night
Won side by side, we survived

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
You ran out of the house, and I chase after you
Cursing each-other out, now what we out each-other through
Cause that’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do

You called your mother’s crib, said you were going over there
Then I took the keys and hid them, so you couldn’t go nowhere
Cause that’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do

Sometimes you can make me mad, and I can make you cry
But when things get bad, we stand right by eachother’s side
Cause that’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do

I walk out the door, and you scream whatever
We make love that night, and we’re right back together
But that’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do, that’s what we do
That’s what we do

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]

[Bridge: Ashanti & R. Kelly]
There ain’t nothing that can stop our love
We can … sent from heaven above
Then should raise the flag, high above
Take the hands, miss Luna
Cause when we’re together, there ain’t nothing better
My life is complete, I’ma love you forever
We should rent some space, get some tools, build a statue of me and you

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Ashanti]

[Outro]
Its your boy, kel
Its your girl, Ashanti
