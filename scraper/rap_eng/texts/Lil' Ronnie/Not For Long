[Verse 1]
Out of all the mistakes you made
I still stayed
Even though it's the bet that you made
I still laid
Never wanted anything for being loyal to ya
Swore and a guarantee you was gonna love me
I see I was wrong

[Pre Chorus]
In the beginning it was hard to realize that we were ending
I was in denial all along
Now it's time for me to move on
I've reach my limit
Felt like I was the only one giving
Finally hit me that we not
Guess I found out the hard way
That I'm strong

[Chorus]
It's ok for me to be hurt
But not for long (guh)
Sometimes I might forget my worth
But not for long (guh)
I'm gonna remind myself that
You're gonna be mad
When I bounce back (yeah)
I know sometimes I put you first
But not for long (guh)

[Verse 2]
I done made a 360 turn
I don't get the same chills
When you call no more
No in and out of my life
Like revolving doors
I'm no longer yours (nooo)
Just a bad habit I had to break
I learned from my love that you're my last mistake (ohhh)
I think it's safe to say that we have run our course

[Pre Chorus]
In the beginning it was hard to realize that we were ending
I was in denial all along
Now it's time for me to move on
I've reach my limit
Felt like I was the only one giving
Finally hit me that we not
Guess I found out the hard way
That I'm strong

[Chorus]
It's ok for me to be hurt
But not for long (guh)
Sometimes I might forget my worth
But not for long (guh)
I'm gonna remind myself that
You're gonna be mad
When I bounce back (yeah)
I know sometimes I put you first
But not for long (guh)

[Bridge]
At the end of the day I found out Imma be ok
I realize I'm alright living life doing things my way
At the end of the day I found out Imma be ok
I realize I'm alright living life doing things my way

[Chorus]
It's ok for me to be hurt
But not for long (guh)
Sometimes I might forget my worth
But not for long (guh)
I'm gonna remind myself that
You're gonna be mad
When I bounce back (yeah)
I know sometimes I put you first
But not for long (guh)

But not for long
