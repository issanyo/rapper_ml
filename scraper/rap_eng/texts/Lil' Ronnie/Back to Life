[Verse 1]
I didn't know I was lost until you found me
I didn't know I was gone 'til you brought me back
Never knew I was exposed 'til you put protection around me
How could I know your love would do that?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my 15th second chance
You saw my flaws in just a glance
All my mistakes were on display
But you loved me anyway

[Chorus]
When nothing was left, you made it alright
Before I knew your intentions, you chose your pride
Thought my heart was dead and gone
But it's been revived
You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
You loved me

[Verse 2]
When I had no chance
I was a victim of my own circumstances
But you said "Never mind the yesterday
Let go, just let it all wash away
'Cause you can't reverse time
Just like you can't rehearse life"
And with all that in mind, you kept me in mine
You gave me love and your love gave me life

[Pre-Chorus]
On my 15th second chance
You saw my flaws in just a glance
All my mistakes were on display
But you loved me anyway

[Chorus]
When nothing was left, you made it alright
Before I knew your intentions, you chose your pride
Thought my heart was dead and gone
But it's been revived
You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
You loved me

[Bridge]
Needless to say
I had my heart tucked away
Six feet beneath the ground, my name on the grave
Tears wiped away
'Cause you made a way to save me from myself

[Chorus]
Even when nothing was left, you made it alright
Before I knew your intentions, you chose your pride
Thought my heart was dead and gone
But it's been revived
You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
You loved me strong
You made it alright
Before I knew your intentions you chose your pride
Thought my heart was dead and gone
But it's been revived
You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
You loved me
