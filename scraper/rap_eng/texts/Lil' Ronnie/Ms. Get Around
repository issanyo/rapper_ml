Paroles de la chanson MS. Get Around :
I don't know if you ever met er
And I don't know if you'll ever see her

[Refrain]
I call er Ms. Get Around
Her name is Ms. Get Around
She never stays in one place for too long
She'll steal your heart before she moves on
I call er Ms. Get Around
Her name is Ms. Get Around
(Get Around...)
She's got a heart of stone
Man that girl, she's so cold
So don't get caught up

I tasted danger
When I tasted her lips
She shut me down with no effort
She poisoned me with a single kiss

She might not know how to love
But she knows how to make it
And she might give you all her body
But her heart ain't for takin

Cus she ain't lookin for compatible
Cus she don't wanna be your friend

[Refrain]
I call er Ms. Get Around
Her name is Ms. Get Around
She never stays in one place for too long
She'll steal your heart before she moves on
I call er Ms. Get Around
Her name is Ms. Get Around
(Get Around...)
She's got a heart of stone
Man that girl, she's so cold
So don't get caught up

She seemed so innocent
Whoever would've thought?
Had me thinkin that I was the only one
Makin the headboard knock

Uh baby
It was all a lie
Yea, I was ready to give her my last name
And buy her a ring
Until I...

Took her out of the town for the night
And she knew all of my friends, my friends

[Refrain]
I call er Ms. Get Around
Her name is Ms. Get Around
She never stays in one place for too long
She'll steal your heart before she moves on
I call er Ms. Get Around
Her name is Ms. Get Around
(Get Around...)
She's got a heart of stone
Man that girl, she's so cold
So don't get caught up with her

She don't meet yo mama, no
She just wanna ride up in yo Benz
You can't take her shoppin no
Give that girl Benjamins
Yea, she'll like that

[Refrain]
I call er Ms. Get Around
Her name is Ms. Get Around
She never stays in one place for too long
She'll steal your heart before she moves on
I call er Ms. Get Around
Her name is Ms. Get Around
(Get Around...)
She's got a heart of stone
Man that girl, she's so cold
So don't get caught up with he
