See I got a weakness for you in my soul
I've caught you in my matrix, got me out of control
There must be a recall prepared for my heart
Cause I've had these same issues right from the start

And I've tried
Believe me I've tried to get over it
But nothing's fair in love and war
For this breaking there's just no fix

Baby, it's just not fair
That every time you're close
I'm running somewhere
Cause I can't function nowhere

Back to where I, back, back to where I
Back to where I was in love with you
There's nothing I can do, it's no fair
I can't come to where I was with you
You, you

There must be a conflict with me in your mind
Cause everything I say just makes you cry
It must be an error when we got together
Cause everything's always wrong

And I've asked
Believe me I've asked everyone I know
For help
But it don't work cause I can't help myself

Baby, it's just not fair
That every time you're close
I'm running somewhere
Cause I can't function nowhere

Back to where I, back, back to where I
Back to where I was in love with you
There's nothing I can do, it's no fair
I can't come to where I was with you

You and the sky must be talking
Cause every time you're near me, girl, it rains
And oh, it's not fair
That I'm your Superman and kryptonite in one
The one falling for you but I'm missing, fix me, no

Baby, it's just not fair
That every time you're close
I'm running somewhere
Cause I can't function nowhere

Back to where I, back, back to where I
Back to where I was in love with you
There's nothing I can do, it's no fair
I can't come to where I was with you
