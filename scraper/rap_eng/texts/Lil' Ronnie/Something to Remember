[Verse 1]
You know I'ma keep it consistent
I'll give you love with no resistance
And you never have to worry about me switching
Everything I do is all for you, you, you, you, you
Your pleasure is my only mission
Whether in the bedroom, or the shower or the kitchen
I'm creeping on your body like a pistol
Put your finger on my trigger
You can shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I hate it when you leave
Boy, what you did to me?
I'm gon' tell the truth
You know your touch is all I need
Got me feeling weak, so before you leave my side
Come back over here and...

[Chorus]
Give me something to remember you by
You by, you by, you by, you by, you by
Give me something to remember you by
You by, you by, you by, you by, you by
Something to remember
I ask in case you're gone too long
And if you ever forget to come back home
Baby, I'll get you right, you right, you right
You right, so right
I'll give you something to remember me by

[Verse 2]
From the A.M. to the P.M
I put it on him when I see him
This ? is strictly for the weekend
We can make love on a Monday, Tuesday, any day
? we don't need 'em
I let his hand roam, give him freedom
This lay more than physical
If you make love to my mind, boy, anything goes

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I hate it when you leave
Boy, what you did to me?
I'm gon' tell the truth
You know your touch is all I need
Got me feeling weak, so before you leave my side
Come back over here and...

[Chorus]
Give me something to remember you by
You by, you by, you by, you by, you by
Give me something to remember you by
You by, you by, you by, you by, you by
Something to remember
I ask in case you're gone too long
And if you ever forget to come back home
Baby, I'll get you right, you right, you right
You right, (I'll do you right) so right
I'll give you something to remember me by

[Bridge]
I'ma give you something
I'ma give you something
I'ma give you something
Give you something you can feel
(Something to remember, something to remember)
I'ma give you something
I'ma give you something
Give you something you can feel
(Something to remember, something to remember)

[Chorus]
Give me something to remember you by
You by, you by, you by, you by, you by
Give me something to remember you by
You by, you by, you by, you by, you by
Something to remember
I ask in case you're gone too long
And if you ever forget to come back home
Baby, I'll get you right, you right, you right
You right, (I'ma do you right) so right
I'ma give you something
Give me something to remember you by
You by, you by, you by, you by, you by
Give me something to remember you by
You by, you by, you by, you by, you by
I'll give you something to remember me by
