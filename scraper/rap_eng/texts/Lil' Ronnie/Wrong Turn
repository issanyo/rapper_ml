(Verse)
I got a devil and an angel on my shoulders

GPS actin up, which house Iâ€™m bout to go over

Is it mine or my baby?

Is it her? My other lady

I guess we bout to find out right about now

(Verse)
Now Iâ€™m in the whip

Tell my girl I was on the way over

My side chickâ€™s callin me

Begging me to come over

She said itâ€™s been a minute, sheâ€™s feelin the get good

Got both over my home, waiting for me naked

(Pre-Chorus)
Couldâ€™ve went to the left

But I made that right

Shouldâ€™ve went to the left

Damn, I know that shit ainâ€™t right

Yea, I know (I know)

I know (I know)

Now I know (Now I know)

(Chorus)
I made the wrong turn

I knew I shouldâ€™ve took my ass home

When am I gon learn?

When am I gonna learn?

I made the wrong turn

Knew I shouldâ€™ve took my ass home

When am I gon learn?

I know I took the wrong turn (wrong turn)

(Verse)
Got a condom on that nightstand

Damn I shouldâ€™ve used it

Said she was on the pill

And Iâ€™m the only one sheâ€™sâ€¦

And I (and I)

Pulled out (Pulled out)

So I

I thought I was good

(Verse)
24 hours with no plan B

Two weeks later she end up callin me

Slangin my dick around

So carelessly

9 months later

That kid looked just like me

(Pre-Chorus)
Shouldâ€™ve went to the left

But I made that right

Getting up to the left

And it changed my life

I know (I know)

I know (I know)

Now I know (Now I know)

(Chorus)
I made the wrong turn

I knew I shouldâ€™ve took my ass home

When am I gon learn?

When am I gonna learn?

I made the wrong turn

Knew I shouldâ€™ve took my ass home

When am I gon learn?

I know I took the wrong turn (wrong turn)

(Verse)
How the hell am I gon explain it to my girl?

When I just told her Iâ€™m not ready to bring kids into this world

I know she gon lose it

Burn up all my clothes

Fuck me up

And beat up that, beat up that

(Verse)
And she done put up with my shit forever

But she ainâ€™t bout to be disrespecting, never

I done fucked up

But itâ€™s too late

Gotta man up

(Chorus)
I made the wrong turn

I knew I shouldâ€™ve took my ass home

When am I gon learn?

When am I gonna learn?

I made the wrong turn

Knew I shouldâ€™ve took my ass home

When am I gon learn?

I know I took the wrong turn (wrong turn)
