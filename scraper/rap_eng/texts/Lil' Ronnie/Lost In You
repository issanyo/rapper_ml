[Verse 1]
Tried to talk politics today
I even thought about my bank account, and all the bills I need to pay
Need to get my hair done, before it's too late
Got so much going on
But I still find a way

[Pre Chorus]
Cause all the roads
Lead back to you
A destiny, a destination
Is beside you

[Chorus]
All my thoughts couldn't make me be wrong
Find myself lost in you again
Find myself lost in you again
All those days when I couldn't find my way
Find myself lost in you again
Find myself lost in you again

[Verse 2]
No matter what I do I get
You as a consequence
And I just can't shake you off my mind
Boy it don't make no sense
North south east or west you're the only one that gets me there
Where we going baby I don't care
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

[Pre Chorus]
Cause all the roads
Lead back to you
A destiny, a destination
Is beside you

[Chorus]
All my thoughts couldn't make me be wrong
Find myself lost in you again
Find myself lost in you again
All those days when I couldn't find my way
Find myself lost in you again
Find myself lost in you again

[Bridge]
And I don't want to be found
Unless it's by you
You baby, right now
Your arms where it's safe and sound
It's why I'm stuck on you
Is that hard to figure out

[Chorus]
All my thoughts couldn't make me be wrong
Find myself lost in you again
Find myself lost in you again
All those days when I couldn't find my way
Find myself lost in you again
Find myself lost in you again

All my thoughts couldn't make me be wrong
Find myself lost in you again
Find myself lost in you again
All those days when I couldn't find my way
Find myself lost in you again
Find myself lost in you again
