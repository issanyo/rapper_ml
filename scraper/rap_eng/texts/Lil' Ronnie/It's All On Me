Nah, nah nah nah nah normally I don't do this
Caught me slippin' shawty, now you got me choosing
And I ain't even mad, I give you everything you never had
Wanna take you to Milan, on the way to Paris
Buy what you want, it's all on me
I I I do this shit for fun
Baby girl you know I'm number one

Anything you want girl, it's all on me
Bring all your friends all the drink's on me
It's whatever you like girl, no matter the price girl
You can have whatever cause I need you in my life girl
You can have this money, you can have this money
You can spend it, you can spend it, you can spend my money
It's whatever you like girl, no matter what the price girl
You can have whatever cause I need you in my life girl

I'm talking stunting, pushing buttons, hear that engine start
I got you falling deep in love girl I'm the king of hearts
And you're my queen girl, it's a Spades if you need a refill
Bottles popping, lot of shopping, spend it all on me girl
Wanna take you to Milan, on the way to Paris
Buy what you want, it's all on me
I I I do this shit for fun
Baby girl you know I'm number one

Anything you want girl, it's all on me
Bring all your friends all the drink's on me
It's whatever you like girl, no matter the price girl
You can have whatever cause I need you in my life girl
You can have this money, you can have this money
You can spend it, you can spend it, you can spend my money
It's whatever you like girl, no matter what the price girl
You can have whatever cause I need you in my life girl

Anything you want girl, it's all on me
Bring all your friends all the drink's on me
It's whatever you like girl, no matter what the price girl
You can have whatever cause I need you in my life girl

You can have this money, you can have this money
