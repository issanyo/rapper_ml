Yeah, Yeah

Nobody is off limits
Not even your friends
I'm 'bout to go in, 'bout to go in, 'bout to go in...

I'ma do something I never do
I'ma try & hurt you too
Feels so damn good to be cold
& I don't even care if you know


Imma let him kiss my body, touch my body
Record it and make sure you find it
How you gonna trip
Boy you been with everybody
You start it, I'ma finish
You made that bed
Now you gonna lay in it

You gone suffer, you gone suffer
For everything you did
You gone suffer, you gone suffer
I done took too much of this

You gone cry
You gone pay me in tears
You gone cry
You owe me for all these years
You gone cry
Cause It's not about love, it's all about revenge
So, cry
Cry

I learned from the best, I learned from you
It's easy to do the shit that you do
I can just switch it up on you
Use to be me that was out here stressing
So your gift became your curse, now you missed your blessing

You gone suffer, you gone suffer
For everything you did
I'm not bitter, stay with her
Maybe she can take your shit

You gone cry, You gone pay me in tears
You gone cry
You owe me for all these years
You gone cry
Cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge
So cry
Cry

I deserve to get my point across
Before all we had was lost
Now we are both hurt
By the one we love
I know it's wrong, but I want to see you
Cry
Cry
Cry
Cry

You gone cry
You gone pay me in tears
You gone cry
You owe me for all these years
You gone cry
Cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge
So Cry
Cry
