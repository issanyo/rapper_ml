[Verse 1]
Fire light by your side, feeling it, you know why
Love's a special occasion
You don't have to keep it within
Gotta resign to be patient
Keep a smile on me like it's a decoration
It's nothing new when it's me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
No tree for the world to see, no mistletoe
You don't have nothing to prove to me
Time after time you make me believe

[Chorus]
Every day's like Christmas
With your love, I'm a witness
The way your heart be giving joy all your around
Every day's like Christmas
Your presence is my present
It's the best gift I've been given
Spreading joy all your around

[Verse 2]
Waking up early just to see your face
In the morning I anticipate
Something real to take my breath away
I prayed every day for someone like you
And you love me too
I got everything I wanted wrapped up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
No tree for the world to see, no mistletoe
You don't have nothing to prove to me
Time after time you make me believe

[Chorus]
Every day's like Christmas
With your love, I'm a witness
The way your heart be giving joy all your around
Every day's like Christmas
Your presence is my present
It's the best gift I've been given
Spreading joy all your around

[Bridge]
January, February, March, April, May and June
It's a present 'cause I'm here with you
The light in August, September too
October into November
Now my favourite time, December

[Chorus]
Every day's like Christmas (every day)
With your love, I'm a witness
The way your heart be giving joy all your around
All your around
All your around
All your around
Every day's like Christmas
With your love, I'm a witness
The way your heart be giving joy all your around
