[Verse 1]
We're here, right now, it's forever
These tears, they know joy by name
Beautiful, seems to have made an appearance
On our face, we have us to blame

[Pre Chorus]
Seriously, I'll take this commitment
Spiritually, you're everything I wanted

[Chorus]
Today I do, today I do
Today I'm saying I do to you
Today I do, today I do, ooh

[Verse 2]
Crowded room
But my eyes are only on you
Can't take 'em off
'Cause I'm watching my dreams come true

Forever I savor, savor this moment
My favorite place got a taste of you
For more, now I got more
'Cause you are mine

[Pre Chorus]
Seriously, I'll take this commitment
Spiritually, you're everything I wanted

[Chorus]
Today I do, today I do
Today I'm saying I do to you
Today I do, today I do, ooh

[Bridge]
I don't have to think before I answer
'Cause your love erased all the questions for me
So here I stand, baby this isn't pretend

[Chorus]
Oh, today I do
Today I'm saying I do to you
I do, I do, I do
Today I do, today I do
Today I'm saying I do to you
I do, ooh, ooh
