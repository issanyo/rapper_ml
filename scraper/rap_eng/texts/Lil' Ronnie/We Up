[Verse 1]
If I had a million dollars
I would buy the air between us
Trying to hop on a plane and reach out
It's only me and you nobody else
Baby, we don't need nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling on top of the world
Feeling on top of the world right now
Ain't no one stopping us, boy
Ain't no one stopping what we've got for real
We got our backs against the wall
We got the time to do it all (do it all)
We got the time to do it all
We got the time to do it all

[Chorus]
(We up) We up, it's our time, yeah, we got it
We up, we blissed over body
We up, it's our love for the hustle
We up, yeah, we up

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody hustle hiding
And me and my baby, my baby
Only option is to make it
Misses for the taken
Don't let it get it twisted
Don't let it be mistaken

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling on top of the world
Feeling on top of the world right now
Ain't no one stopping us, boy
Ain't no one stopping what we've got, for real
We got our backs against the wall
We got the time to do it all
We got the time to do it all
We got the time to do it all (the time)

[Chorus]
We up, it's our time, yeah, we got it (we got it)
We up, we blissed over body
We up (we up), it's our love for the hustle
We up, yeah, we up

[Bridge]
Give me next stop, give me next stop
Gotta get a red up, get a red up
They don't understand us, understand us
Don't wanna hand up, wanna hand up
Don't care about standing ovations
Just get a reservation
And we up, we up
Ain't no one stopping us right now

[Chorus]
We up, it's our time, yeah, we got it
We up, we blissed over body
We up, it's our love for the hustle
We up, yeah, we up
We up, it's our time, yeah, we got it
We up, we blissed over body
We up, it's our love for the hustle
We up, yeah, we up
