You can search the galaxy
But you’ll never find another me
And I’m cool on your attitude
You’ll be trying prove you don’t need me in your life
But you’d better wake up and starting giving me what i deserve

[Chorus]
You need to be loving me like money
I want you stuck like bees to honey
I need you addicted to this good love
That I'm giving don’t be fronting
You need to hold on and don’t let go
I wanna feel you take control
You don't wanna wake up one morning
To see you lost your heart and soul
You better get it right

Boy it’s time for you to get it right
You bout to make me walk up out your life

You can swim the ocean wide
But you won’t discover love like mine
I’ma need you to understand if you gonna be my man
Then you gotta show that you wanna be here
You better start acting like you know
Ooh

[Chorus]
You need to be loving me like money
I want you stuck like bees to honey
I need you addicted to this good love
That I'm giving don’t be fronting
You need to hold on and don’t let go
I wanna feel you take control
You don't wanna wake up one morning
To see you lost your heart and soul
You better get it right

Boy it’s time for you to get it right
You bout to make me walk up out your life

[Rap: Taraji P. Henson]
Had me playing with my head inception
Talking bout he loving me but I ain't feelin it
You's a bad joke yeah a crowd of smoke
So I’ma fall back in the rear coach gold
I gave him everything that he needed
Oh but now his phone number's been deleted
You couldn't get this right
Booking the next train up out of yo life

Ya better get it right

[Chorus:]

Boy it’s time for you to get it right (out of sight)
You bout to make me walk up out your life......
