[Verse 1]
Naw, it never rains in Southern Californ-i-a
And it probably never ever has a snow-day
But that doesn't mean that we don't know how to celebrate
Say "Who cares about snowman?
We'll plant that Christmas tree in the sand"

[Pre-Chorus]
Palm trees around (we got)
Drop downtown (ghost ride)
83 degrees (so hot)
Water on a fee (real nice)
Keeps on giving gifts on December 25th
This is L.A., baby, holidays and heat waves

[Chorus]
Christmas time in L.A
What a beautiful sight, Christmas in the sunshine
Christmas time in L.A
Feels like summer, but it's Christmas in the sunshine

[Verse 2]
We don't discriminate, no, we show love
Celebrate Christmas, Kwanzaa, even Hanuka
We got a Winter Wonderland up in the sun
In my bikini, sleight bells ringing
Waiting on St. Nick to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Palm trees around (we got)
Drop downtown (ghost ride)
83 degrees (so hot)
Water on a fee (real nice)
Keeps on giving gifts on December 25th
This is L.A., baby, holidays and heat waves

[Chorus]
Christmas time in L.A
What a beautiful sight, Christmas in the sunshine
Christmas time in L.A
Feels like summer, but it's Christmas in the sunshine

[Bridge]
We got Christmas in the sand
We got Christmas in the sand
We got Christmas in the la-la
In the La-la-la Land
We got Christmas in the sand
We can build a sandman
We got Christmas in the la-la
In the La-la-la Land

[Chorus]
Christmas time in L.A
What a beautiful sight, Christmas in the sunshine
Christmas time in L.A
Feels like summer, but it's Christmas in the sunshine
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la L.A
What a beautiful sight, Christmas in the sunshine
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la L.A
Feels like summer, but it's Christmas in the sunshine
Christmas time in L.A
