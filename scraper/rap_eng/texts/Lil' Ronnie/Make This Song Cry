[Verse 1]
Quit playin' games, boy
How soon did we forget?
I’ll be in some other bed
So don't you fuck with me like that!
Got me confused, boy
Like I won't put your ass in check
I tried and tried

[Bridge]
'Cause I tried so hard to just keep it goin'
Not cheat on you!
You know how I am, don't you forget
What I did for you!

[Chorus]
I left all my hoes
Told 'em not to call and text me no more!
Now you so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was for me to stay faithful?
Bae. I'mma make this song cry
Never let a nigga see me cry
I'mma make this song cry
'Fore I ever let 'em fuck up my eyes!

[Verse 2]
For the first time in my life
Tried to do somethin' that's right
I tried to stop thottin'' and be a wife
But I paid the ultimate price!
Guess karma caught up with me (Guess it did)
'Cause I done hurt so-o many!

[Bridge]
'Cause I tried so hard to just keep it goin'
Not cheat on you!
You know how I am, don't you forget
What I did for you!

[Chorus]
Left all my hoes
Told 'em not to call or text me no more!
Now you so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was to be faithful?

[Bridge]
It’s been said, you supposed to find that perfect one
And they should be the only one you wanna see
But that just ain't never been me
I can't believe the things I don't see
I'm feelin' out of control
I just miss my hoes!

[Chorus]
So I told all my hoes
I told 'em not to call and text me no more, yeah!
Now you so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was for me to stay faithful?
Sing it!
I'mma make this song cry
Never let a nigga see me cry, no!
Gotta make the song cry!
I'mma make the song cry!
Whoooa yeah
Whoooa yeah, yeah, yeah!
