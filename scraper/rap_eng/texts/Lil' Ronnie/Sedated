[Verse One]
Maybe I'm a rebel
Maybe I don't wanna settle
Maybe I believe in magic
Maybe I'm the one that has it
Maybe love is an illusion
But maybe it's confusing
Maybe I'm tired of losing me

[Pre-Chorus]
All I really want is to love and not to fear
Can't take a broken heart so I guess I'm staying here
All I really want is to love and not to fear
Is to love and not to fear

[Chorus]
So I'm intoxicated
Tryna stay sedated
Always end up feeling
Baby that's the reason
Why I'm scared of what the real is

[Verse Two]
People try to tell me
That I gotta be more open
But the truth ain't always pretty
Some things are better left unspoken
I could try to make it better
But I know you won't believe it
How could you know the difference
If you ain't never seen it

[Pre-Chorus]
All I really want is to love and not to fear
Can't take a broken heart so I guess I'm staying here
All I really want is to love and not to fear
Is to love and not to fear

[Chorus]
So I'm intoxicated
Tryna stay sedated
Always end up feeling
Baby that's the reason
Why I'm scared of what the real is

[Bridge]
What if I fall
And I like it
If love becomes my drug
And I can't fight it
Will I still be me
Will I still be free
What if I fall

[Chorus]
So I'm intoxicated
Tryna stay sedated
Always end up feeling
Baby that's the reason
Why I'm scared of what the real is
