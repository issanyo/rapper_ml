[Verse 1]
I don't know why the love hurts
Why is it so hard to make it work?
But love is the one thing we all need
Why does it take so long for time
To heal this wounds of mine?
Looking for the silver line that I can't see
I close my eyes but I still feel the pain
I'm slow to rise 'cause I still feel the same

[Chorus]
But I know what a difference it makes when I let go
And I know, when I hold on to mistakes, I never grow
We made it this far, have so much further to go
But I know I'm not going alone

[Verse 2]
I know you're feeling all alone
You're seeing everything's that's wrong
I understand there's a better way
If you redeem the time, you can seize the day
And you close your eyes, you may still feel the pain
You may be slow to rise but things won't stay the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I know what a difference it makes when I let go
'Cause I know, when I hold on to mistakes, I never grow
We made it this far, have so much further to go
But I know I'm not going alone

[Bridge]
I know questioning why is alright
We're all searching for the answers to life
Whatever thing's not going my way
It gets so bad, I don't even wanna pray
I may get tired, but I'll never give up, not at all

[Chorus]
'Cause I know what a difference it makes when I let go
Yes, I know, when I hold on to mistakes, I never grow
We made it this far, have so much further to go
But I know I'm not going alone
'Cause I know
And I know (know)
(And I know) We made it this far, have so much further to go
And I know I'm not going alone
And I know
