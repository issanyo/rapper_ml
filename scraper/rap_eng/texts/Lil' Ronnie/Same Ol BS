Is it something wrong with me?
Cause I keep on falling for the same old bullshit, the same old bullshit
Let me talk to you, a different me in a different city
I don't understand how to get me with the same old
It worked every time, and it's been on my mind how come I

I just can't believe that I'm here again
Is there no such thing as a better man?
If not, then I don't wanna spend the rest of my life

Dealing with the same old bullshit
I'm so through dealing with the same old bullshit
Dealing with the same old bullshit, same old, yeah, yeah!
Ladies, if you hear what I'm trying to tell you
Can I get a head, yeah!
Same old bullshit, the same old bullshit, same old bullshit

You see, you're so predictable
Before you do it, I already know I'm looking at the same old picture, a different frame
And I don't wanna see it again
? that I'm not coming home 'till tomorrow
This heart of mine is on the sorrow
Is nothing you can do that ain't done before
And I ain't gonna threw it no more!

I just can't believe that I'm here again
Is there no such thing as a faithful man?
If not, then I don't wanna spend the rest of my life

Dealing with the same old bullshit
I'm so through dealing with the same old bullshit
Dealing with the same old bullshit, same old, yeah, yeah!
Ladies, if you hear what I'm trying to tell you
Can I get a head, yeah!
Same old bullshit, the same old bullshit, same old bullshit

What else can I do?
I'm tired of playing the fool
What a little bit of love could do for a woman, a damn good woman
And even for a mother way, I see 'em
It's nothing I don't recognize
Sometimes I just close my eyes
And I hope for the best, but in a way regret that
It's how that I know

I'm dealing with the same old bullshit
I'm so through dealing with the same old bullshit
Dealing with the same old bullshit, same old, yeah, yeah!
Ladies, if you hear what I'm trying to tell you
Can I get a head, yeah!
Same old bullshit, the same old bullshit, same old bullshit
