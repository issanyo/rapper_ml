I think that I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven
I know that I'm in heaven
I know that I'm in heaven

I can only dream, yea
I can only wonder
Was it simple as it seems?
We were made for each other
Could we?

Now what if I never made a wrong turn that night?
And what if you played it cool and just passed me by?
In years in fading unpredicted your thing baby
Your love is now the only song that I sing baby

Girl every time I look into your eyes it's like I see the morning sunrise
And when I see the smile upon yo face it's like I got a glimpse of paradise
I love playing with your hair, and grabbing everywhere
I'm kissing you all through the night
I took me an angel, I'm thankful for you

It feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my sunrise
All the rain goes away
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

Feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my everything
Everything that may come true
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

Can't even sleep
I'd rather watch you slumber
'Cause you seem so at ease
Right next to me

Now what if I never took that look in your eyes?
And what if you never gave me the chance to make it right
Fate is searching like a big cup you baby
Your love is now the only song that I sing baby

It feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my sunrise
All the rain goes away
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

Feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my everything
Everything that may come true
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

No other woman on this earth matters, no
With you right by my side, girl I'm going throw this stormy weather
That's why I won't never walk away
I know God made you chase a way
Baby it's worth it
Don't know what I did to deserve it

It feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my sunrise
All the rain goes away
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

Feels like heaven
When I'm with you
You are my everything
Everything that may come true
I ain't never going no more
I'm here to stay

I think that I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven
I know that I'm in heaven
I know that I'm in heaven
