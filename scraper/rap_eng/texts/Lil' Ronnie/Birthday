[Verse 1]
Even though it's Your birthday
You're still working
And I thank You for it
I don't care about the gifts
'Cause you give me life, again and again
I just wanna take this time to celebrate You

[Chorus]
'Cause it's your birthday, Jesus
But if you took a day off, we would be lost
So right now, I thank You
For giving us a gift for Your birthday, Jesus
We tend to forget why this day really is called Christmas
It's Your birthday, Jesus

[Verse 2]
And I wanna give you my love
And I hope that it's enough
Because I acknowledge Your grace
So I wanna give you all of me today
'Cause it's Your day
Happy birthday
I just wanna take this time to celebrate You
(Celebrate You)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's your birthday, Jesus
But if you took a day off, we would be lost
So right now, I thank You
For giving us a gift for Your birthday, Jesus
We tend to forget why this day really is called Christmas
It's Your birthday, Jesus

[Outro]
Happy birthday, happy birthday
To You, Jesus, to You, Jesus
Happy birthday, happy birthday
To You, Jesus
Happy birthday, Lord
