[Verse 1]
My man asked me what I want for Christmas
All I had to do was hit him with my wish list
Poking me a witness
Who is Chant√© Moore? She keep gettin' what she want
It's feeling like my birthday
Sometimes I can't believe it
It ain't my birthday, salute to baby Jesus
Talking all
You say what you want, but I got it going on

[Pre-Chorus]
Just on the ground, Christmas all around
Floating like I'm a cloud
Ain't nothing bring me down, baby
You should go and buy yourself a Christmas tree
Every time I come around I hear the kids all sing now

[Chorus]
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
[?] sleight like I do
[?] sleight like I do
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
[?] sleight like I do
[?] sleight like I do

[Verse 2]
You couldn't have it better, even if your man was
I know you wanna catch my underneath the mistletoe
But if my boyfriend find out
You gon' probably end up buried in the snow
I see those Christmas lights (Christmas lights)
I got them jingle bells ringing all night (all night)
You know I keep the gift wrapped so tight
(So tight, boom, boom, boom)
Don't you hear them heels up on the roof?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just on the ground, Christmas all around
Floating like I'm a cloud
Ain't nothing bring me down, baby
You should go and buy yourself a Christmas tree
Every time I come around I hear the kids all sing now

[Chorus]
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
(No, it don't slay)
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
(No, it don't slay)
[?] sleight like I do (No, it don't slay)
[?] sleight like I do (No, it don't slay)
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
(No, it don't slay)
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
(No, it don't slay)
[?] sleight like I do (No, it don't slay)
[?] sleight like I do (No, it don't slay)

[Bridge]
Maybe one day I can teach you how to sleight
Even though Santa babe can't give you this gift
You hear them slight bells and you know we on the way
All my homegirls colder than December 25th
You sleight so good, you get off and all of this
Maybe I can show you next Christmas Eve
If you try hard enough and if you try good enough
Hopefully you can come and sleight like me

[Chorus]
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
(No, it don't slay)
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
(No, it don't slay)
[?] sleight like I do (No, it don't slay)
[?] sleight like I do (No, it don't slay)
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
(No, it don't slay)
Santa Claus don't sleight like I do
(No, it don't slay)
[?] sleight like I do (No, it don't slay)
[?] sleight like I do (No, it don't slay)
