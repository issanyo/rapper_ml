[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
We ain't gon' leave 'til 4 in the mornin'
Thousand dollar tab, but I can afford it
On my 4th drink but I'm not an alcoholic
Shorty say she want me, she way too scrawny
By 4 o'clock I might be too horny to go home lonely
I can't be lonely
Left the last club cause the DJ was boring
Came back, valet parked it and the valet robbed me
Nigga true story, and that was 12:40(am)
By 1 o'clock I was back in the wary
Tipsy, Ferrari, this Hennessy got me
Oh baby, I'm so sorry

[Hook: R. Kelly]
But if you're drinkin' what I'm drinkin'
Put your hands up in the sky
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
You'll say "what a crazy night!"
Way-oh, way-oh

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
We ain't go leave 'til 4, maybe later
Track so funky, make you make an ugly face
Run that back, I mean start that over
Shorty get closer, hot like a toaster
Body so tight, like she walked off the poster
Kellz caked up, make her call me the baker
Man, he a hater, she gonna see me later
He got good intentions, but not enough paper
We left doin' 80, caught a flat up on the Friday
Headed back to the highway, think they'll stay at my place
Just so fucked up, man it's not my day
I need another shot of that Bacardi
