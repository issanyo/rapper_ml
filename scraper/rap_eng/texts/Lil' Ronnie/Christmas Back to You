[Verse 1]
When I was young, the only thing that mattered was
"Would I get everything that I wished for?"
And if I asked for the sun
I'd be looking for it under the tree
Never satisfied, always wantin' more

[Chorus]
But now I know the difference
And I realize I missed it
You keep giving when you don't have to
So I decided that I'm giving Christmas back to you
Is the right thing to do - giving Christmas back to you
After everything you do, I'm giving Christmas back to you

[Verse 2]
And I still believe there's a lot of good in the world
But it won't matter, if you don't tell them who you are
And show them your love
We should be the light that leads them right to your soul

[Chorus]
And now I know the difference
And I realize I missed it
You keep giving when you don't have to
So I decided that I'm giving Christmas back to you
Is the right thing to do - giving Christmas back to you
After everything you do, I'm giving Christmas back to you

[Bridge]
There's not a gift in the world
That can compare to your sacrifice
They say it's not the gift, but the thought that counts
I'm just glad you thought enough of me to give you love me
And I promise I won't take it for granted anymore
And as long as I got you, I have more that I could ever ask for

[Chorus]
And now I know the difference
And I realize I missed it
You keep giving when you don't have to
So I decided that I'm giving Christmas back to you
Is the right thing to do - giving Christmas back to you
After everything you do
