[Intro: K. Michelle]
Either way
Either way
Either way
E-e-either way
Either way

Either way, either way

[Verse 1: K. Michelle]
Ass shots, real or fake
That ass gon' jiggle for him anyway
Ain't fuckin' with me on your best day
I don't like you, but I love how your man lick the plate
I know you seen what I post today
Diamonds up like Jay, crazy on my Kanye
'Cause I need someone to do, somewhere to play
Fuck it, I might Uber me a jet today (yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: K. Michelle & Chris Brown]
They don't like me, what they say?
I hear rumors, I feel the hate
But I'm okay, I'm young and rich
I be high all day (ooh)

[Chorus: K. Michelle & Chris Brown]
Either way, I'm gon' be straight, damn, my life is great (woo)
Sleeping good at night, in the morning eating eggs and steak (yeah, yeah)
Sleep or awake, I'm gon' get this money either way
Either way, either way (yeah, yeah)
Either way, I'm gon' be straight, damn, my life is great (woo)
Sleeping good at night, in the morning eating eggs and steak (yeah, yeah, woo)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & (K. Michelle)]
Either way, I'm gon' brazy with my braids, where my shades?
See the face? All the diamonds blinding, that's why your bitch came
And she stay, she ain't scared that I got felonies
Love a country nigga, with the pot, teachin' hoes my new recipe
She never kiss and tell, throw a coin in a wishing well
You buy your bitch Michael Kors
I'm buying her Richard Mille
My girl got booty like K. Michelle
If I pay her bills, she gon' pay my bail
Paper trail, nigga, oh well
Louboutin, shawty toenails
I turn your bitch into a cokehead, I don't give a fuck (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: K. Michelle]
I get a lot of love, you get a lot of nothin'
He donâ€™t hit you when he sober 'cause you getting my leftovers
Maybach, Maybach, Maybach, he pull up in a Maybach
I pull up in a 'rari, skrrt, on his ass, nigga, I ain't sorry (yeah)

[Verse 4: K.Michelle]
I-I-I got a whole lot of paper (cash)
I got a whole lot of haters (ugh)
Bitch, I be drippin' in sauce
'Cause I got a whole lot of flavors
Ridin' your little Benz, with all of your friends
I just keep it solo, be perkin' on 10's
They want me to end but, bitch, I'ma win
Bitch, I done won, got it and I show it
'Cause I ride the dick like a Harley
2Pac is back, gangster party
Got a fetish for head in a Maserati
Gucci all up and down, that's what's on my body
Damn bruh, damn bruh
Damn bitch, bitch
Steady talkin' shit, when you don't write your own hits? (Yeah, yeah)
