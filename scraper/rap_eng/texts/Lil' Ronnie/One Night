She off in the club, straight to the bar
Came with the girls, gonna leave with a star
'Cause I got everything that she needs

She just my type, eye looking right
What she gonna get by the end of the night
In my bed and on top of me

I can tell she a freak, trying to keep it on the low
Don't worry about it, baby, ain't nobody gonna know
Come sit right here next to me, yeah

All about the Ros√©
Okay, don' worry about it shawty
It's on me, satisfaction guaranteed

All you need is one night, one night, one night with me
We can have one night, one night, I promise you'll never leave
What I got's gonna mess your mind up
Give me the body, I'm a fix that right up, I'm about to change your life

All I need is just one night, just one night
All I need is just one night, just one night
All I need is just one night, just one night

Now baby, don't act surprised, I'm about to blow your mind
I'll be dripping like water in the middle of the summer
Last call, last call, last call for alcohol
Baby, meet in the alley, black on black riding outside

Drop the top girl just get in, hidden lady hair blowing in the wind
She can't keep her hands off me, got me feeling all over her body
You want a little foreplay, okay, seems like you're ready
12 play, knock, knock, knock in the boots, not a shit sounding job

All you need is one night, one night, one night with me
We can have one night, one night, I promise you'll never leave
What I got's gonna mess your mind up
Give me the body I'm a fix that right up, I'm about to change your life

All I need is just one night, just one night
All I need is just one night, just one night
All I need is just one night, just one night, baby
(I'm a get straight to the point, baby)

All I need is just one night, just one night
(You won't be disappointed, baby)
All I need is just one night, just one night
All I need is just one night, just one night
