Paroles de la chanson Come Back Home :
She was like a breath of fresh air
Wake up in the morning, she's there
Cookin, holdin down everything I need
She makes things better, I need her lovin

I know I was selfish
Damn, I regret this
I messed up, now she let me
Here all by myself
Girl I need your help
I need your help

Can't function
My mind is clearly gone
And up in public
I miss you by my side
And I can't lie, no

[Refrain]
Girl my house ain't a home without you
My bed's all alone without you
Now that you're gone I'm about you
Baby come back home to me
So hard without you
I can't sleep at night without you
Life just don't seem right without you
Baby come back home to me

Simple things like my socks don't match
My clothes too wrinkled, where's my hat?
Never realized how much I needed you girl
I never told you why I appreciate you
But all the little things that you do
But now I know
Girl I need your help
I need your help

Can't function
My mind is clearly gone
And up in public
I miss you by my side
And I can't lie, no

[Refrain]
With you and swear I want to be
I thought the grass was greener on the other side
But it's brown as it can be
Askin you to please forgive me
For doing you wrong, sorry it took so long
I'm begging you to come back home

[Refrain]
Girl my house ain't a home without you
My bed's all alone without you
Now that you're gone I'm about you
Baby come back home to me
