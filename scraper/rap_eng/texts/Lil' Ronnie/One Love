[Verse 1: Chanté Moore]
Baby, tonight put me up in the droptop
So you can blow my mind every time you speed up
Touch my thigh, make my body tense up
We're on a road to the loving you want and I want it too
Ain't no guessing at all
If [?] on the floor, like I'm holding the wall
We can [?] off top, whether right or wrong
I promise I'm your accomplish

[Pre-Chorus: Chanté Moore]
It's gonna be you and me killing it together
Or you and me down by whatever
May come up, we gon' hold up
When they see you, they gon' see me
An accomplish we will be

[Chorus: Chanté Moore & Lewis Sky]
We will be one love
We gon' last forever, baby (one love)
I don't want another lover, babe
After you there is no one else
With you I can never fail
Don't care what the life's got left
We found that one love
We gon' last forever, baby (one love)
I don't want another lover, babe
After you there is no one else
With you I can never fail
Don't care what the life's got left
We found that one love

[Verse 2: Lewis Sky]
Sometimes I may be all in my pride
Knowing good and well
I should push it aside and pull you closer
'Cause there would take care of it
Find me riding through the city
Motivated by your beauty
And guess what I wanna feel, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Chanté Moore]
It's gonna be you and me killing it together
(Killing it, killing it, yeah)
Or you and me down by whatever
May come up, we gon' hold up
When they see you, they gon' see me
An accomplish we will be

[Chorus: Chanté Moore & Lewis Sky]
We will be one love
We gon' last forever, baby (one love)
I don't want another lover, babe
After you there is no one else (no one)
With you I can never fail (ooh, yeah)
Don't care what the life's got left
We found that one love
We gon' last forever, baby (one love)
I don't want another lover, babe
After you there is no one else
With you I can never fail
Don't care what the life's got left
We found that one love

[Bridge: Chanté Moore & Lewis Sky]
You drivin' right on it
I'm about that action
We can bet a couple stacks on it
Baby, you got me
We can make each other's day better
If we just love, love
You done and done, and you know it
Done with the talking, I show it
I know what you need to operate
And I'm willing to give it to you every day

[Chorus: Chanté Moore & Lewis Sky]
We will be one love
We gon' last forever, baby (one love)
I don't want another lover, babe
After you there is no one else (no one)
With you I can never fail
Don't care what the life's got left
We found that one love
We gon' last forever, baby (one love)
I don't want another lover, baby
After you there is no one else
With you I can never fail
Don't care what the life's got left
We found that one love
