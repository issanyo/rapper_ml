Looking at my reflection I can see wrapping
Through the fire, the ups and downs, beginnings end ends
My saving grace has always been
Knowing who my faith is in

It's all about the journey (hey)
It's all about the journey (yey)
It's all about the tears
All about the fears
All about everything that got me here
It's about the journey
I'm so grateful, grateful
Thanks, thank you
Thank you for the journey
This is my gratitude

Thank you for taking the journey
