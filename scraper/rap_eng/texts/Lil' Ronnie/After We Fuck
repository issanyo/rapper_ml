[Verse 1: J. Holiday]
Just because this beat is slow
Don't mean we can't go hard
Hold my knees, I'll stay right there
Speaking in tongues like I'm in prayer
Make you scream "Oh My God!"

[Hook]
You like it like that, So I'mma give it to ya (Give it to Ya)
No holding back, However you want I'll give it to ya
(Oh) I'm going in (Oh) I'll never end
Baby I love it when we touch, We can make love after we fuck
Ooh Oooh yeah, After we fuck, We fuck
Yeaaah, After we
Damn this feels so good (You're amazing)
Damn this feels so good (Gets you crazy)
I can never ever get enough, Get enough
We can make love, After We

[Verse 2]
Ooooh, I'm gonna make you (Scream my name)
I know you like that pleasures and pain
You're driving me crazy girl (So insane)
Bed soaking wet, Playing in the rain

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Playing in your hair, grabbing everywhere
The love's in the air, The air
Rubbing on your thighs and looking in your eyes
Cause it's time to make Looooooove!
Like I've been locked up for years
They just let me out, I'm about to let it out baby

I ain't even supposed to be here
It's my guilty conscience
