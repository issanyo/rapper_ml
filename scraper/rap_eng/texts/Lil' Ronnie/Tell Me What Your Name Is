[Verse 1]
I'm used to men approaching me
Tryin' to talk to me
Always tryin' to buy me things
Drinks to diamond rings
Fast cars first class to the Philippines
That's what they think it would interest me
Just then it came as a surprise
When I looked into your eyes
Never walked up to a guy
But here I go

[Hook]
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is
And I know I'm acting strange
Girls ain't supposed talk this way
But I can't let you slip away
So tell me what your name is

[Verse 2]
I see you sittin' all alone
Tell me tho
Do you got a girl at home
Gotta know is she taking care of you
Like I would do
Then you said I don't have a girl
But I'm feelin you
Just then it came as a surprised when he looked into my eyes
Never walked up to a guy
But here I go

[Hook]

[Bridge: 2x]
Tell me what your name, what your name
Tell me what your name
Tell me what your name is

[Hook: 2x]
