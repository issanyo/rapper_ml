Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat my nice (treat my nice)
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat my nice (treat my nice)
Oh, you gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise (paradise)

Well, I'm feeling magnified
Got good music on my, on my radio (radio)
Oh, I'm feeling magnified
Got good music on my, on my radio (radio, radio)
Well, I wanna kiss you, baby
While we're standing under the mistletoe
Under, under, under, underneath the mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney about a half past 3
Left all these pretty presents
That you see me holding

Merry, Merry Christmas, baby
You've been, you've been good to me, to me
(You've been so good, you've been so good to me)
See, I haven't had a drink this morning
But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree
(You got me lit up like a Christmas tree)
