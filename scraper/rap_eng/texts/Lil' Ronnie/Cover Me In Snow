[Verse 1]
You like me shining
Light show holiday season
Get in the giving spirit
You got a reason
You can suprise me, baby, no peeking
Gon and hide it baby while I'm sleeping
When you get up I wanna see all that you got
You told me that you gon put me on the rocks, so
So make me, cold, freeze me up
From my head to my toes

[Chorus]
Cover me, cover me in snow
I want you to
Cover me, cover me in snow
I want that from you
Cover me, cover me in snow
Baby, this Christmas got me icy like a slushy, Ooh
Cover me, cover me in snow
Boy, I want you to
Cover me, cover me in snow
Freeze my wrist like an igloo baby
Cover me, cover me in snow
Baby, this Christmas got me icy like a slushy

[Verse 2]
Bring me out doors inside
Snow all over my body
No work today, boy, just watch me
Re-run, re-run you copy
They say diamonds are a girl's best friends
I'm so glad that you get along with them
'Cause these friends right here ain't gon be messy
No, no ,no
These friends right here gon have me lit
Yeah, yeah, yeah
These friends right here gon make me happy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Frosty the snow girl I'm sexy
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Cover me, cover me in snow
I want you to
Cover me, cover me in snow
I want that from you
Cover me, cover me in snow
Baby, this Christmas got me icy like a slushy
Cover me, cover me in snow
I want you to
Cover me, cover me in snow
Freeze my wrist like an igloo baby
Cover me, cover me in snow
Baby, this Christmas got me icy like a slushy
