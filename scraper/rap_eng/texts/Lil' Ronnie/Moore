[Verse 1: Chanté Moore]
You give me something that I can't explain, babe
You have me pouring like it's raining
You put it down on me like a payment
So, baby, what I say is

[Chorus: Chanté Moore]
You keep me wanting more
Keep me wanting more
Never running out, you can always have more
You keep me wanting more
Keep me wanting more
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no one
'Cause you keep me wanting more

[Verse 2: FellyTheVoice]
Please, don't be alarmed 'bout what I'm about to say
'Cause I don't mind, I don't mind me being in a state
You're the favourite flavour that I love to taste
I'm not ashamed, you're the one I crave
Ooh, baby, you know that you do something to me
Ooh, oh, baby, you're the only lover that I need
And that's for sure

[Chorus: Chanté Moore]
You keep me wanting more
Keep me wanting more
Never running out, you can always have more
(You can always have more )
You keep me wanting more
Keep me wanting more
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no one
'Cause you keep me wanting more

[Bridge: Chanté Moore & FellyTheVoice]
And I thank you, 'cause I realize
You coulda get that all to yourself
When you say "Chanté, I just give you more to feel
On my last day, we can feel
'Cause, baby, this is real"
You know, like I know, baby
Go ahead, get comfortable
Don't matter if you leave the house
I'ma keep this loving home
Baby, I'ma work even harder for you
Work on a few things new
That's gonna keep you...

[Chorus: Chanté Moore]
You keep me wanting more
Keep me wanting more (keep me wanting more)
Never running out, you can always have more
(You can always have more )
You keep me wanting more
Keep me wanting more
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no one
'Cause you keep me wanting more
(Keep me wanting more) More, more
Who am I to deny my love and wanting more?
More, more
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no one
'Cause you keep me wanting more
