[Verse 1]
I was mindin' my business, just thinkin' of you
When I got the phone call with some really bad news about you
Hope it ain't true!
Tellin' me stuff that you don't do
I don't know everything, but I know 'bout you
I'mma need some proof!

[Bridge]
Oh, I know you mess up a time or two
And I don't hold it against you
Oh, somethin' is tellin' me it might be true
Oh, I'm just prayin', no, not you!

[Chorus]
No, no
No, not you!
No, no
How could you?
I was your life, I did you right
I gave my all every night
Ohhhh, no
How could you?

[Verse 2]
Give me one minute to collect my thoughts
'Cause somethin' 'bout you's been a little off lately
I know I'm not crazy!
It's gettin' kinda late and you still not home
Somethin's kinda funny, I'm gon' leave it alone, my baby
You wouldn't do me wrong!

[Bridge]
Oh, I know you mess up a time or two
Oh, I don't hold it against you
Oh, somethin' is tellin' me that this could be true
Oh, I'm just prayin', no, not you!

[Chorus]
No, no
No, not you!
No, no
How could you?
I was your life, I did you right
I gave my all every night
No, no
How could you?

[Bridge 2]
This can't be happenin'
Must be a bad dream
Can't bring myself to think
That you would lie to me
Oh, I don't wanna leave you alone
I play blind to your wrongs
And I'm prayin', I'mma pray, yeah

[Chorus]
No
No, not you!
No, no
How could you?
I was your life, I did you right
I gave it all every-noooooo
No, not...you!
