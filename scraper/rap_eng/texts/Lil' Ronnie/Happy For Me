[Verse 1]
I won't hold my breath if you ask me to
I'd be dead if I wait for you
If I wait for you
You can't just lock me away so these dudes won't see
What you won't see, I sure hope you hear me
'Cause soon you won't see me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'ma find a man who loves me
A man who needs me
More than you ever did, oh
And when I'm happy
Please, just be happy for me
Just be happy for me

[Verse 2]
Wish that I knew then what I know now
'Cause if I did maybe I could have gave you
Enough of me to save you
But there I go again putting you first
I sacrificed myself, but still it don't work
And it still hurts

[Chorus]
So if I find a man who loves me
A man who needs me
More than you ever did, oh
If I'm happy
Please, just be happy for me
Please, be happy for me

[Verse 3]
I thought you and me
We was gonna figure it out
Thought that's what love is about
So why am I doing without
Everything that I need
Why is it so hard for you to love me
I always made it easy

[Chorus]
So if I find a man who loves me
A man who needs me
More than you ever did, oh
If I'm happy
Please, be happy for me
Please, be happy for me

Happy for me
Please, be happy for me
Please, be happy for me
