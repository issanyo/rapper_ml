Tip-toein', comin' in late on the low
Knockin' shit over, smellin' like some random hoe
It's past 4 and you just now gettin' home
What you don't know is I'm not alone
Call me Goldie Locks 'cause somebody's been in your bed
In your sheets, in your legs, how you love that?
I can see you catchin' feelings gettin' mad
Like a chick, baby, where's your stacks

See, what you don't understand
Is I won't be hurt again
Won't ever let another come in and make me suffer
Baby, I'm cool on that
Baby, I'm numb inside
No matter how hard you fight
You ain't gon' ever win 'cause I'm the champion
So let the games begin (Oh, oh)

Don't think I'm gon' be sittin' 'round callin' you
Don't think I'm gon' be all up under you
I won't be fallin' through 'cause I be ballin' too
You think that I'm a fool, but you done met yo match

Don't think I'm gon' be sittin' 'round callin' you
Don't think I'm gon' be all up under you
I won't be fallin' through 'cause I be ballin' too
You think that I'm a fool, but you done met yo match

Walkin' 'round here wit' yo little ringtones
Different ones to identify certain broads
Couple of dirty broads, no tellin' where they from
But you think yo pimp game is strong
But see, your girl got different ones for every day of the week
They do laundry, fold clothes, whatever I need
So believe me when I say you can't offend me
I can barely remember your name

See, what you don't understand
Is I won't be hurt again
Won't ever let another come in and make me suffer

Baby, I'm cool on that
Baby, I'm numb inside
No matter how hard you fight
You ain't gon' ever win 'cause I'm the champion
So let the games begin (oh, oh)

Don't think I'm gon' be sittin' 'round callin' you
Don't think I'm gon' be all up under you
I won't be fallin' through 'cause I be ballin' too
You think that I'm a fool, but you done met yo match

Don't think I'm gon' be sittin' 'round callin' you
Don't think I'm gon' be all up under you
I won't be fallin' through 'cause I be ballin' too
You think that I'm a fool, but you done met yo match

Don't be cuddling next to me when we done
And don't ask me no questions like is you the only one
I know you got other chicks but I'm too cool to even trip
Quit actin' like you in love, boy you need to quit

Don't be cuddling next to me when we done
And don't ask me no questions like is you the only one
I know you got other chicks but I'm too cool to even trip
Quit actin' like you in love, boy you need to quit

Don't think I'm gon' be sittin' 'round callin' you
Don't think I'm gon' be all up under you
I won't be fallin' through 'cause I be ballin' too
You think that I'm a fool, but you done met yo match

Don't think I'm gon' be sittin' 'round callin' you
Don't think I'm gon' be all up under you
I won't be fallin' through 'cause I be ballin' too
You think that I'm a fool, but you done met yo match
