Woke up this morning
Smelled the breakfast in the air
Hopped in the shower
Would have got dressed but I undressed my girl instead

We did some things
Got some food and now I'm on my way to work
Got into my car, started up
Drove off, now I'm on the road

That's when I pulled up to this gas station
And got into this conversation
With this girl I could tell she wanted me but, oh

If I met you when I was single
We probably could have been something more
'Cause you're beautiful but you should know
That I found my girl and I know I love her, so I gotta go

She cracked a smile
And she said she understood
And I sympathize
'Cause every man she had was never any good

It's so amazing
How much you could learn in just a bit of time
Like how I see me and her in my mind

That's why I need to pull out of this gas station
'Cause after this conversation with you, girl
I might just do something I don't wanna do 'cause

If I met you when I was single
We probably could have been something more
'Cause you're beautiful but you should know
That I found my girl and I know I love her, so I gotta go

And I know it's such a shame
You can't even entertain the things you feel
Don't feel bad 'cause I feel the same
It would just be wasted time
Trying to find if life's greener on the other side

If I met you when I was single
We probably could have been something more
'Cause you're beautiful but you should know
That I found my girl and I know I love her
So I just gotta go go

Said I gotta go
It's nice to meet you but I
But I just gotta go

If I met you when I was single
We probably could have been something more
'Cause you're beautiful, yeah but you should know
That I found my girl and I know I love her so, I gotta go
