[Verse 1]
You make me feel like I can't even stay without you
Baby, you do, you make me feel like I am dreaming
While I'm wide awake, this love right here won't fade
You got me signed up, put me in a zone
Make me feel as strong as in my
I don't know how much longer I can take being away

[Chorus]
I don't mind admitting
That you got me where you want me
I would do almost anything
Just to make you want me
'Cause I seen it with my own eyes
That you are love, no disguise
I don't mind admitting
That you got me where you want me

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm in all the way, I'm not halfway out
I know what you are about
I recognize the protection
And how good it feels when you show affection
I don't take it lightly, listen
Whoever has something to comment, bless them
You can use your love as a weapon
But instead you wanna show me
Make me feel as strong as in my
I don't know how much longer I can take being away

[Chorus]
I don't mind admitting
That you got me where you want me
I would do almost anything
Just to make you want me
'Cause I seen it with my own eyes
That you are love, no disguise
I don't mind admitting
That you got me where you want me

[Bridge]
Why lie for when I can just be upfront with you
And tell you exactly what I want?
And you do it for me
You have me hooked, respectin' and shook
Ooh, I be like "My man amazing
My man don't treat me basic"
And that's something that I can believe in
Got me loving you for a reason

[Chorus]
I don't mind admitting
That you got me where you want me (I don't mind that)
I would do almost anything
Just to make you want me (Tell me where you want me)
'Cause I seen it with my own eyes
That you are love, no disguise
I don't mind admitting
That you got me where you want me
I don't mind admitting
That you got me where you want me
(Got me where you want me)
I would do almost anything
Just to make you want me
'Cause I seen it with my own eyes
That you are love, no disguise
I don't mind admitting
That you got me where you want me
