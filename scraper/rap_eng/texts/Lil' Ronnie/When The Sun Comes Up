[Verse 1]
Pale kiss in the sky
It's a beautiful day outside (ahhh ahhh)
We bout to go live
I'm chillin with my people tonight (ahhh ahhh)

[Pre Chorus]
We not posting nothing, we livin it
Love on top but love (yea), we givin it
We don't seek the drama, we friends with the sunshine, the sunshine

[Chorus]
When the sun comes out we don't know how to act
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
When the sun (when the sun) comes out we get cute like it's mandatory
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back

[Verse 2]
Cooperation love when the weather's cooperating
I be feel like I'm on a vacay
Innocent like I'm on a play date, baby
No worries in the world I feel like
Happy's the only way to live life
So Imma take it all in, take it all in
And on the next clear day Imma do it again

[Pre Chorus]
We not posting nothing, we livin it
Love on top but love (yea), we givin it
We don't seek the drama, we friends with the sunshine, the sunshine

[Chorus]
When the sun comes out we don't know how to act
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
When the sun (when the sun) comes out we get cute like it's mandatory
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back

[Bridge]
Nothing to do but to love yea that's it
We living life no worries here
We don't get doubt off the love that we give
We gettin high off the love that we get
Nothing to do but to love yea that's it
We living life no worries here
We don't get doubt off the love that we give
We gettin high off the love that we get

[Chorus]
When the sun comes out we don't know how to act
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
When the sun (when the sun) comes out we get cute like it's mandatory
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back

When the sun comes out we don't know how to act
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
When the sun (when the sun) comes out we get cute like it's mandatory
We just party like it won't come back
We just party like it won't come back
