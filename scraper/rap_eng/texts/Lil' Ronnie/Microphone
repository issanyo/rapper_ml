She is the passion, she is my melody
And I amplify, amplify her sexuality
When the lights go out my bed is the stage
Her body is the pole and we just lose control

And let nature take its course
Just like that I'm in the palm of her hand
Like a mike in the stand
Turn us up if y'all don't hear me

Like the greatest show on earth known to man
Mic check, one, two, mic check, one, two, two
Like the whole world inside the palm of her hand
Mic check, one, two, mic check, one, two

Like the perfect song in the key of love
Mic check, one, two, mic check, one, two, two
We gon' repeat the love 'cause I can't get enough
When she's all on my microphone
Ooh, oh oh, oh, when she's all on my microphone
Ooh, oh oh, oh, when she's all on my microphone

I'll make her, ooh, I'll make her, oh
When she's all on my microphone
The greatest show known to man
Is in the palm of her hand

What a work of art
When she's all on my microphone

Verse two only gets better
Like the calm of a storm before it get wetter
And when she does that sexy choreography
It's like a pole dance trick and she's on top of me

When the lights go out her body is like a speaker
Amplifies when I freak her
Loud as a siren, falsetto dream
I make her body draw like an 808 form
Like a mike in the stand in the palm of her hand

Like the greatest show on earth known to man
Mic check, one, two, mic check, one, two, two
Like the whole world inside the palm of her hand
Mic check, one, two, mic check, one, two

Like the perfect song in the key of love
Mic check, one, two, mic check, one, two, two
We gon' repeat the love 'cause I can't get enough
When she's all on my microphone
Ooh, oh oh, ohh, when she's all on my microphone
Ooh, oh oh, ohh, when she's all on my microphone

I'll make her, ooh, I'll make her, oh
When she's all on my microphone
The greatest show known to man
Is in the palm of her hand

Her lips are priceless, her body is priceless
Her technique is priceless like a sold out show
After paying all my dough
But now she's on my body like a stage

First the lights dim down
And I'm plugged in now and the show begins
She makes the night seems so long
Like a never ending song
When she's all on my microphone

Ooh, oh oh oh, when she's all on my microphone
Ooh, oh oh oh, when she's all on my microphone
Ooh, oh oh oh, when she's all on my microphone
Ooh, oh oh oh, when she's all on my microphone
Mic check, one, two, mic check, one, two, two
