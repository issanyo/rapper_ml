[Verse 1]
You're the fun and the wrong and the good and the right
So glad I waited to have you in my life
Cause I could have been looking for love in a relationship
Talking to my girlfriends about him saying only if he
Knew what he had he would beeeee more careful

[Chorus]
I don't have to worry about you baby
If I had to choose you, I would do it again
If I had to choose you, you'd still be my man
Cause you don't ever have excuses
You don't hesitate to prove it
If I had to choose you, you
You'd still be right here

[Verse 2]
Every each and every day I'm in your sight (ohhh yeaaa)
Cause you give me certainty, instead of just smile
Cause you wear the title of a man, like a jersey
And forever with me baby you're MVP
I promise, I'll love you with honors

[Chorus]
I don't have to worry about you baby
If I had to choose you, I would do it again
If I had to choose you, you'd still be my man
Cause you don,t ever have excuses
You don't hesitate to prove it
If I had to choose you, you
You'd still be right here

[Bridge]
Hooo, I'm a still, hooo, I'm a still
Be right here baby
Ohhh uhhh huh baby
I'm a still, be right here

[Chorus]
Baby
If I had to choose you, I would do it again
If I had to choose you, you'd still be my man
Cause you don't ever have excuses
You don't hesitate to prove it
If I had to choose you, you
You'd still be right here
