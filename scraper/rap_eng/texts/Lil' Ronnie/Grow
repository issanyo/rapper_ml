[Verse 1: Chanté Moore]
I ain't gon' push you
I ain't gon' rush you at all
Don't change up for me
I will let time take us close
And show you in the process
I'm really for you, boy
In case you're wondering where I'ma be
Right here, I'ma be right here
'Cause I know it's a process
So I'm not gon' show you how I truly feel all the time
I'ma give you space while I'm up close
Because, baby, I know

[Pre-Chorus: Chanté Moore]
I'ma move and not think of it
Even when I'm sick of it
I'ma give you all the time you need to grow
If it's me, you do the same
'Cause I can't lose ya
So I'm gonna go ahead and grow

[Chorus: Chanté Moore]
We grow different, we grow different
Long as we don't grow distant
No matter how slow
Long as we continue to grow
We grow different, we grow different
Long as we don't grow distant
No matter how slow
Long as we continue to grow

[Verse 2: Phillip Lynah]
Like the tree by the water, baby
You know I thirst for you
And your love is like the sunshine, baby
It helps me bring
You and me, plain to see, every day
You know the truth, make it bloom
It takes to work, I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus: Chanté Moore]
I'ma move and not think of it
Even when I'm sick of it
I'ma give you all the time you need to grow
(And you know) If it's me, you do the same
(Yeah, baby) 'Cause I can't lose ya
So I'm gonna go ahead and grow

[Chorus: Chanté Moore]
We grow different (we grow different)
We grow different (I will be O.K.)
Long as we don't grow distant (grow distant)
No matter how slow
Long as we continue to grow
(It don't matter how we grow) We grow different
(It shouldn't matter how I grow) We grow different
(You gotta know) Long as we don't grow distant
No matter how slow
Long as we continue to grow

[Bridge]
'Cause everyone will be greater
In the meantime, we can make up
Whatever, long as we don't break up
If we grow from our mistakes, it will get better
Grow with me if you can
I got time for that
Understand that you're worth me not asking for my time
Let's keep our love up high, even if we hit it low
It's O.K. 'cause from there we can grow

[Chorus: Chanté]
We grow different, we grow
We grow different
Long as we don't grow distant
No matter how slow (slow)
Long as we continue to grow
We grow different, we grow
We grow different, we grow
Long as we don't grow distant
No matter how slow
Long as we continue to grow
