[Intro]
Real one, real one
I done found a real one, real one
Messed around, 'round
Real one, I done found a real one, real one

[Verse 1]
Off the rip it was cool
Perfect conversation
When it comes to dope relations
I ain't never had to fake one
It's got to be some kind of catch he's too perfect
All this lovin' you givin' me even though I know I'm worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
He be buying them bags, spending that cash, make it right back
Text him, he call me right back
You know that every girl really love that
He be taking care of me, and I don't have to ask
He ain't nothing like that nigga I had in the past

[Chorus]
I done messed around and found a real one, real one
He be goin' hard givin' real love, real love
I done messed around and found a real one
I've got a real love
He be goin' hard givin' real love, real love

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma hold him down on the way up (way up)
When I put it on him, he don't stay up (stay up)
I done messed around and found a real one (real one)
He be goin' hard givin' real love, real love
Real love, real love

[Verse 2]
I cook him his breakfast in the morning 'fo he wake up
'Cause I know he be workin' hard, grindin' getting that cake up
So I'ma keep my heels straight up like he like
Stay up in the gym, gotta keep my body tight

[Pre-Chorus]
He be buyin' them bags, spending that cash, make it right back
Text him, he call me right back
You know that every girl really love that
He be taking care of me, and I don't have to ask
He ain't nothing like that nigga I had in the past

[Chorus]
I done messed around and found a real one, real one
He be goin' hard givin' real love, real love
I done messed around and found a real one
I've got a real love
He be goin' hard givin' real love, real love

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma hold him down on the way up (on the way)
When I put it on him, he don't stay up (hey)
I done messed around and found a real one (real one)
He be goin' hard givin' real love, real love
Real love, real love

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen
I know you understand how hard it is to find a real one
When you find him, gotta keep him
Gotta treat him like you need him
It's not often that a real one comes along
So be sure to hold on, hold on
I done lucked up and didn't even know it
I love him, and I ain't afraid to show it

[Chorus]
I done messed around and found a real one (real one)
Found a real one
He be goin' hard givin' real love (Oh, real love)
I done messed around and found a real one
I done found a real love!
He be goin' hard givin' real love, real love, real love

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma hold him down on the way up (on the way)
When I put it on him, he don't stay up (Don't stay up, oh)
I done messed around and found a real one (real one)
He be goin' hard givin' real love, real love

[Outro]
Real one, real one
I done found a real one, real one
Messed around and found a real one, real one
I done found a real one, real one
