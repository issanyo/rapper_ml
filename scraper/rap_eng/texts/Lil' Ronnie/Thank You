[Chorus]
I admit that
Made you better for me, yes, she did that
Give the credit all up, she deserve that
You exactly what I want, can't be mad at her

[Verse 1]
Why hate on her, when she made me want you?
She took the old-you so I could have the brand new other woman
I appreciate her putting in the work and letting you escape
You went through a little broken heart
Like you better for me these days
It took that so that we could be a match
You know how to treat a woman, that's a fact
She yo' ex, how could I get mad about that?
Going through, experience this taught you how to act, listen

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way that this feels
I can tell you've been taught well
Home girl gave you some skills
And I enjoy every moment

[Chorus]
I admit that
Made you better for me, yes, she did that
Give the credit all up, she deserve that
You exactly what I want, can't be mad at her
This is a thank you to yo' ex
I admit that
Made you better for me, yes, she did that
Give the credit all up, she deserve that
You exactly what I want, can't be mad at her
This is a thank you to yo' ex

[Verse 2: Kristal of June's Diary]
She helped you pass with me
Zooted that ass, now you got a baby
Plus I ain't gone fuss
When because of her, you learned to love better (hey-ye-eah)
Know exactly where to go when you go down there
Standing when I ride you slow, pull up a chair
I know it ain't fair for us to both get B.S
But, my B.S. stands for best sex (ay-yeah)!

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way that this feels
I can tell you've been taught well
(I can tell you were taught well)
Home girl gave you some skills
And I enjoy every moment

[Chorus]
I admit that
Made you better for me, yes, she did that
Give the credit all up, she deserve that
You exactly what I want, can't be mad at her
This is a thank you to yo' ex
I admit that
She made you better for me, she did that
Give the credit all up, she deserve that
You exactly what I want, can't be mad at her
This is a thank you to yo' ex

[Gabby of June's Diary - Bridge]
It's a team effort, each will make 'em better
Once you let go, I'll be better for it
Someone else, if nothing else
[Chant√© Moore]
In my case, I can thank your ex everyday
For the time she invested in teaching my man
[Shyann of June's Diary]
Even though I didn't know it back then
We had a plan, and it worked out for the best in the end
(Thank you to yo' ex)

[Chorus]
I admit that
Made you better for me, yes, she did that
Give the credit all up, she deserve that
You exactly what I want, can't be mad at her
This is a thank you to yo' ex
I admit that
Made you better for me, yes, she did that
Give the credit all up, she deserve that (she deserve that)
You exactly what I want, can't be mad at her
This is a thank you to yo' ex
I admit that
Made you better for me, yes, she did that
Give the credit all up, she deserve that
You exactly what I want, can't be mad at her
This is a thank you to yo' ex
