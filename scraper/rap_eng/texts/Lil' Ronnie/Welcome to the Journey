Sometimes you got to lose to win
Sometimes you got to start to end
To get where you're going
It's not about knowing
The journey keeps going and going and going

Ain't gonna turn away, you flow
First you gotta just let go
To get where you're going
It's not about knowing
It's about the journey

It's about the journey
It's all about the journey
It's all about the journey, journey

All about the journey
The journey
The journey
Welcome to the journey
