[Verse 1]
Always loving what don't love me
Put my trust in things I don't need
My poor heart should be mad at me
I just leave my wounds to bleed

Haven't I learned anything
You showed me signs to help me see
But I love so blindly
I'm taking full responsibility

[Chorus]
God I get it
I'm a mess and I admit... whoa
I keep learning the same lessons
While I'm missing out on blessings
God I get it... whoa whoa

God I get it
I'm a mess and I admit it...whoaaa
I keep learning the same lessons
While I'm missing out on blessings
God I get it

[VERSE 2]
Probably should of just have one glass
But instead I started a bath
Don't feel better I still feel bad
Not the first time won't be the last

Haven't I learned anything
Showed me signs to help me see
But I love so blindly
I'M taking full responsibility

[Chorus]
God I get it
I'm a mess and I admit it...whoa
I keep learning the same lessons
While I'm missing out on blessings
God I get it...whoa

God I get it
I'm  a mess and I admit it
I keep learning the same lessons
While I'm missing out  on blessings
God I get it

[Verse 3]
I know the truth but still do wrong
No it can't be worked
I'd rather still be left alone
They don't know my heart
They tear me apart
Tryna get it together

[Chorus]
[God I get it
I'm a mess and I admit... whoa
I keep learning the same lessons
While I'm missing out on blessings
God I get it... whoa whoa
God I get it..
I'm a mess and I admit... whoa
I keep learning the same lessons
While I'm missing out on blessings
