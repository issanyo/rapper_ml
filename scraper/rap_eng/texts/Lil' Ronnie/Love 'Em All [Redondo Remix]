Heart beats, but I don't feel
I touch, but it ain't real
They say I move too fast
Going man to man
Always holding a new hand
Why can't they understand
Sex is irrelevant
Just a game in my head
I'm playing and I'm winning
Oh I broke another heart today
Oh and I didn't care I just walked away
'Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
'Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
They all wait for my call
They all want me to fall
All these men, they're a mess
Want me like the rest
I'm continuing not giving my best
Why can't they understand
Sex is irrelevant
Just a game in my head
I'm playing and I'm winning
Oh oh I broke another heart today
Oh oh and I didn't care I just walked away
'Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
'Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
Maybe one day I'll settle down
But for now
I'll just play around
And I'll make them feel good
That's how I get 'em
Making all feel special
Then I'll forget 'em
So I won't hurt
I keep a lot of them
And I love them all
'Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
'Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
