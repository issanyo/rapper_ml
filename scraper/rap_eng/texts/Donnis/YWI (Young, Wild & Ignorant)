Young, wild and ignorant, we don’t really give a shit
Young, wild and ignorant, we don’t really give a shit
No, no, no, no, we don’t give a fuck, we just doing us
No, no, no, no, we don’t give a fuck, we just doing us
Young, wild and ignorant, we don’t really give a shit
Young, wild and ignorant, we don’t really give a shit
No, no, no, no, we don’t give a fuck, we just doing us
No, no, no, no, we don’t give a fuck, we just doing us

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Unprotected sex, tats on her neck, gold in her mouth, drugs in the house
Weed and a couple pills, we don’t wanna work, all we want is record deals
And a fine ass name, Mr. Sheffield, fuck her good, got her head over Louis heels
My mama said I’m hell on wheels, anything I’m doing shit, I’m do it for the thrill
Dick in my hand, I’m the motherfucking man, got her jumping
Pussy pumping out your pants, the motherland, anxiety attacks
Where my Xannies at? Spent my whole check on a phanny pack
MC imminent, damn, a nigga killing it as if I was Eminem
And just found preeminent, slim and shady, eyes is lazy off some drink
My nigga Travie gave me, rock star lifestyle, might gon’ make it
Can’t afford the Gucci bag, just might fake it, 80’s baby nigga
Just might take it, they hear what we saying but fear what we saying ‘cause we…

[Verse 2: Donnis]
Seen me with your bitch, that ain’t BMF shit, she blowing me fast
BMF shit, I feel like Mr. Marcus, Peter North, aim for the green
They all Tiger Woods whores, nine bad bitches, this is 18 on course
Not including they mouth, just they dirty South, money in the air
I blow it all, she’ll be outta Houstatlantavegas by tomorrow
They say the future’s uncertain so we just keep on blowing purp
Till we figure out a purpose, nervous? Never, I’m about whatever
Whiskey, weed and E help me deal with the pressures
If I die, I’ll say it’s been a pleasure so shout out if you hate us
And congrats if you met us, the game’s changed
One thing remains the same, these the days of our lives, YWI
