Them folk tales, them new folk tales
And shorty, these are the tales that we know so well
Them ATL folk tales, them new folk tales
And shorty, these are the tales that we know so well yeah

[Verse One: Donnis]
My nigga Joe, cool as twenty below, Chevy on 24's
Barely made 24, the hottest nigga in town, got product by the pound
Green, white and the brown, yeah, yeah, he get it in
Fiends need they medicine and ain't no advertisement
And to my surprise man, my nigga got ties with Colombians, Dominicans
He don't deal with middle men, he just throw the money out
And let the dough reel 'em in, spending plenty in Euro crowns
Thanksgiving day, he give out turkeys downtown
He helped build a community that he tore down
And on that same fateful night, his life turned upside down
See, the cops pulled him over, he put the thing in park
Yeah, he was being watched by some undercover narks
The dog started barking, dope was in the bumper
And now my nigga Joe locked up for ten Summers

[Verse Two: Donnis]
Stacy of the good life, Stacy of the in-crowd
Vogue mag in style, yeah she from a small town
To the city she came, a moth to the flame
In search of something bigger than the norm
At day, she study long and at night, she would perform
And pop a few pills 'cause without 'em, work was born
Word is bond, getting everything she ever dreamed possible
And in a few years, she gon' be working in a hospital, nursing
But deep inside, little Stacy, she feel worthless
'Cause she can't seem to find love in a purchase
Or the purses that the stripper pole bring and there goes her self esteem
See, what I mean is heels turned to coke, then the coke turned to heroin
Fuck, I'm doing fine, that's exactly what she telling 'em, huh? Little Stacy
She was so damn close till she died on an overdose, she comatosed and...

[Verse Three: Donnis]
Folk tales, the tragedy, the drama, the good receive good
And the bad come with the karma so just ponder
Think before your next move 'cause the bad can come so fast
It's like a train just hit your ass in a flash
And lose it all and you just fall without a hand to grasp
Crippled 'cause you simple and in a word, well now you're handicapped
Facing the consequence 'cause the sequence of these events
Didn't lead to the ending that you had once envisioned and these...
