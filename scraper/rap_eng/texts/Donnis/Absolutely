Absolutely, abso-fucking-lutely
I put my name on it, Cecily yours Trudy
I say absolutely, abso-fucking-lutely
All the thugs gonna love it when they see me they salute me
What up, what up, what up
When they see me they salute me
What up, what up, what up
When they see me they salute me
Salute me like the general
Bad bitch looking like a cine of foe
Oh money over everything it's been a cold
If you ain't ever after what you wonder for
Right around my city like Diddy you don't believe me
You silly my weedy purple no silly nigga I'm so hot
Just soon I'll be off that fizzy lifter
Like Willy that's my God it's pussy I didn't conquer
Then let the fine like blanker
Fill the pussy then kill the pussy
I wake it up and then hear the pussy
I've been around and far from..
I'm free nigga like suck sucking
I'll going in like obey in the pressure
Plus I'm hotter than the Anda and the Sana what a switch up
I tell her how to be hell of dope and they tellin not
I try to tell em before but they hard hit it like diggin up
Fuck em all I really care they really rap on me
And I'm here with all my niggas and we walked in like we on the spot

I say someone honey nigga stop my name with Benjamin
Dick bitch on my dick name cinnamon
Say she got some fine friends tell em cinnamon
Hoes star giving up the pussy like is lean again
I never going my pocket it's feel lean again
There's a chance those niggas will never get again
But I'm back so the cool can't resume
I ain't worried by them niggas
Them niggas will never get I'm just doing what I do
Smoking blunt and sipping 40's like is 1992
I've just seen a bitch nigga it reminded me of you
What did I do, what I say, better say I make eye
Word to my nigga tray
Love and I'm out she in love with the south
Never seen a nigga ring us strip club to his house
Money everywhere niggas sayin I'm lucky
I say it's no biggy they say I'ma make puffy
So here they talk down but the price is going up
And I gave a lot of things but I never gave a fuck

[Hook:]
See me and salute me like a magic pain
Real nigga got stripes like the Kane Kane
Drop to the flow like shop in the cold right now now now now
It was all good in the neighborhood until I met that outside
It was still good now will be bad
School the hard nox aize and never be class
Bottle and bad models whatever we at
Broke niggas know your pockets will never be fat
Broccoli smoking I got a part in this sockling
I sell and retch it but on the dick she'll be going
Scrape it that thing right that bitch is she stolen
I walk her the language
All of this money I' hug
Niggas know that I'm wild, lock me up in the zoo
Getting dough like a jewel, rockin leave eyes no truth
All I worry no truth, niggas know I'm the truth
I see flow I got juice, I just hang em no news
