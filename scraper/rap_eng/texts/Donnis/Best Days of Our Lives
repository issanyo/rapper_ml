(Chorus)
Best Days of our life, Best Days of our life
Best Days of our life, Best Days of our life
Best days, Days of our life, of our life

(Verse 1- XV)
Flight, so I’m red eyed
Nights on Jedi
Laying down flows, putting mics on bedtime
Give me my set time, and I’ma go rep mine
Bars on veg time, cars on red line
I be in the Palms hoping the Psychic that read mine
Was all the way right, no turning left signs
Tell them girls that this Don named Teflon
So you can touch me all you want, baby that’s fine
Grab a camera ain’t no telling what you finna see
With this boy from the 20th century
I told her I don’t have a photographic memory
So take a pic and give me pornographic memories
Imagination as long as minutes be
Now she on my linens sheets, F’ing me like Kennedy's
It’s a cold world, luckily I rented skis
Cameras out for the end of scene
This'll be the

(Chorus)

(Verse 2- XV)
Your man’s life bout as live as Ben Stein's
She wanna roll with a nerdy nigga that spits rhymes
Buzz so big you would think that I’ve been signed
I’m going big time, call it Big Ben time
Today’s it guy was the I.T. guy
Flow so vain, that they call them I.V. rhymes
Was in IB now, look where I be ma
Used to be posted on the corner like street signs
Wishing that my life’s TV had a rewind
But a screenshot would be fine
I know its gonna take me time to leave this hood behind
And turn that Nissan to a Car’s hood with a peace sign
Playa play on, Dookie rope chain on
Riding on my way home, Dookie by Green Day on
While ya’ll check ESPN for what game on
I’m taking a flick at what ya’ll laying on
This is called

(Chorus)

(Verse 3- Donnis)
Man I love this life, I can’t leave
I remember when my niggas used to make-believe
We took them dreams and mixed them with a little weed
And made a toast with a cup full of memories
And blackout like Akon and Black T
Haha, OD, OD
That’s what she’s saying when she got her hands on me
Way out here in Japan with 15 grand on me
I think she wanna fuck me
I mean she do but first she gotta learn to suck dick
So she gonna watch a girl blow me like a trumpet
I’m a Mac bitch, I stay on my Donald Trump shit
So these the best days ever
90 degree weather, shape up, no Sketchers
Hit me with Febreeze, I can’t get no fresher
I’m gonna think I’m on a bill, if I feel much better
