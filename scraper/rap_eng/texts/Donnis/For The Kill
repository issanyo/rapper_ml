I’m going in for the kill, I’m doing it for a thrill

Oh, I’m hoping you’ll understand and not let go of my hand

I’m going in for the kill, I’m doing it for a thrill

Oh, I’m hoping you’ll understand and not let go of my hand


[Verse 1: Donnis]

Fuck it, I’m going in, I play the game, I wanna win

I’m in the water, see my shark fin? Either you love me or you a guppy

Fuck me over, show no remorse, you dead to me, I see your corpse

Pour out the porks, preserve the wines, we pop the champagne

Once we cross the state lines, I’ll be damned if they take mine

‘Cause they inferior, I am superior like a great lake or a fat seat

And honestly, I gotta say I’m who they wanna be

That’s just the T-I-P of the iceberg, don’t like me?

I don’t give a four letter word, fuck, damn, shit

This Donnis, something you don’t wanna miss bitch


[La Roux]

We can fight our desires but when we start making fires

We get ever so hot whether we like it or we don’t

[Verse 2: Donnis]

Every verse I pin frees me from another demon, cursed with this curse

So my children are cursed, even the semen, yeah, this is just what I believe in

My ex girl still at home underachieving, mama found out I’m chiefing

And that’s just where it begin ‘cause I been popping these pills

They instantly make me feel like I’ll never know, never gon’ have to worry again

So that worries my friends, wait, I ain’t got friends ‘cause they was lame

And said the fame just wasn’t for them but I won’t hit a dead end

Nope, I keep on cruising and I kept on schmoozing while the game kept snoozing

This shit got confusing, see, they thought I’d be losing

Now I sit in amusement and watch them eat that betrayal

Motherfuckers be happy if my train slip and derail, I went in for the kill

Did it for all for the thrill, said they’d understand but they let go of my hand
