[Verse 1: Donnis]
Hotel suite, trying to stay cool, Hoff everything
Drunk off champagne, on the phone, calling my ex girl every name
By the morning, we will never be the same again
Say I’m fucking hoes, say I’m running game
But I went through her phone and know she fucking what’s his name
But she still sucking me so all in all, it’s all the same
‘Cause men lie, women lie and hoes lie on they back
Try hard to react, matter of fact, fuck it, tonight, I’m going in
Imma call a couple friends and Imma spin baby spin
Till the room start to spin and the lookers at the bottom
And the hoes come out they bottoms, way out here in Houston
And I know we got a problem and we got extra
And some hoes just to solve ‘em, feel my life dissolving
Everything’s evolving and nobody can save them, all I’m really saying…

[Hook]
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
5’5, brown eyes, what it look like?
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
Yeah, I’m drunk and I’m high, what it look like?
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
Even further, even deeper to the dark side
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
5’5, brown eyes, what it look like? I’m falling

[Verse 2: Donnis]
Skeletons in the closet, monsters under her bed
They tell me be ware but I ain’t never scared
She can smell the fear on this cold Fall night
She got her heels on higher, dress on tighter
It’s all about her, not me, no Mya, her body so heavenly
I may need a choir to sing all of her praises, hallelujah
Imma sit her on my tongue and start to speak it in tongues
‘Cause her ass a work of art and she’ll be hanging in the MOMA
Or in the Louvre right next to the Mona, one touch
One look and trust me, you a goner, you only getting colder
Never getting warmer, Donnis, they warned ya
But I don’t listen, every night, I’m throwing ones
Imma keep on tipping till she coming home with Pippen
Lose money chasing women, never women chasing money
Now I’m out here, looking funny

[Hook]
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
5’5, brown eyes, what it look like?
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
Yeah, I’m drunk and I’m high, what it look like?
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
Even further, even deeper to the dark side
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
Got her fucking, got her sucking, what it look like? I’m falling
What it look like? I’m falling, what it look like? I’m falling
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
Even further, even deeper to the dark side
I’m falling, even further, even deeper to the dark side
Yeah, I’m drunk and I’m high, what it look like?
