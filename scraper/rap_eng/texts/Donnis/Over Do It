[Verse One: Donnis]
They don't wanna give it to me, okay fine, I take it
My mama told me that this life is only what you make it
So I don't wanna flow no more, I'mma overflow
And do the type of shit that get her front row at the Oprah show
Talking about how she raised a legend, not John though
Just a Don though would flow like lava and I protect this shit
Like it's my twelve year old daughter cause these niggas is predators
With they little metaphors, what that even matter for?
Donnis is a matador, andale, andale, spring up on these niggas like April, May
They would say Donnis so hot but how we gon' break 'em?
See, that's the problem, see, you labels can't break 'em
I'm eating niggas' dreams and I'm shitting inspiration
Donnis bring fire like cavemen, thank him
Ain't no more patience, I'm sick and tired of waiting

[Hook]
Don't make me do it to you shorty cause I over do it
Don't make me do it to 'em shorty cause I over do it
Don't make me do it to you shorty cause I over do it
So you don't confuse this for just rap music
I want one million, two million, three million, four
I want one million, two million, three million, more
If we make it to the top, catch 'em sleeping on the floor
They wouldn't let us in, now we kicking in the door

[Verse Two: Donnis]
Blackout and I wish that my life would end
Sick of dreaming of this shit, nigga I wanted in
Imaginary friends, imaginary ends, imaginary Benz, I imagined it
And here the fuck it is, how I got this shit?
Don't think, imagine it, damn that boy so passionate
It's like it's happening right before your eyes
All them nights I died and all them nights I cried
Cause job wouldn't take 'em, effort wouldn't take 'em
Labels wouldn't take 'em and now I'm about to take 'em
For like everything they got cause now I got the slot
Jackpot, nigga Vegas, we took this as a lesson
We wondered how we'd come up, the game tried to check us
And now we about to come up and now we about to run up the bill
And make these niggas pay for this meal, I'm eating but I really want the mill yeah

[Hook]
