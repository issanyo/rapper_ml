[Verse 1: Donnis]
I drop one hit and look at me, I'm on
See, right now I'm here but later on, I'm gone
Tonight it's LA, tomorrow I'm in Toronto
Backstage champagne, hoes getting low-low
But just last week, I wasn't the one they would go for
Looking at these people like who the fuck do I know-know?
Man, I stay surrounded by strangers who don't care about me
They only care about the paper, care about the hits, they don't care if I exist
This game is so shitty, it'll eat ya alive, I ain't even got no time
To kiss my mama goodbye, give my pops a hi-five, look at how time flies
Luckily God's the pilot, I'm just here for the ride, flying first class
Looking through the glass wondering who gonna love me
If I ever start plummeting from forty thousand feet, just me and my ecstasy, let's see

[Hook: Tony Williams]
One last coffee, one last breath and one last cigarette
And I'm outta here, say I'm outta here
One last coffee, one last breath and one last cigarette
And I'm outta here, say I'm outta here

[Verse 2: Donnis]
Girl, you were supposed to be my chick, lover and best friend
So I already tell you but right here is where the bet ends
You lost a best man, no Taye Diggs, you fine
I see why he wanna make you his, I love your mind
And that's why I wanna make you mine but you wasting time
‘Cause right now, you think he better, no, you see me making calls
No, you see me sending letters, threw away all your pictures
Instead of trying to picture something that’s picture perfect
See, I don't see the purpose in chasing and playing games
You already knew my aim, you the only girl I claim
See, now you should be ashamed ‘cause through the tears and pain
I'm the one who still remain, you complain, I made it better
The world was cold, I was your sweater but now you gotta face
The weather all alone cause together and forever is forever postponed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Donnis]
Climbing to the top, getting to that next level shit
Fuck my old miss, I'm on my rebel shit
I say for whether that, I said hello to Rich
I say goodbye to haters and said hello to chips
Ain't a problem that I can't fix, I just wash my hands for shit
I planned for this, they gonna try shoot me down, I crash landed this
And walked away without a scratch, I ain't even react
In the past, I said some things that I can never take back
So now, I just relax and tell them haters take that, even when I collapse
I'm collapsing as a God, never ever will remember my memoirs

[Hook]
