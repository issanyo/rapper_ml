[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I am me, as much as you may try, you could never be
If you step into my mind, then you'll see I am me, I am me, I am me

[Verse One: Donnis]
Not for nothing, I don't need no introduction
But now, I guess I'm just a fucking topic of discussion
Nobody gave me nothing, created my own sound
Created my own style, I am the A-Town
Where I'm at now? Niggas think they know me
And it's killing me so slowly, man, all these niggas phony
They got me ready to quit and I ain't drop the album yet
The real fans don't threat, I ain't stopping till I'm set
They hating is not a threat to the all amazing Donnis
Man, I'm just being honest, who know me better than me?
Who's seeing the things I see? I'll wait, let a nigga know
I ain't think so, man, these haters, they don't know

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Donnis]
All in all, I'm just a kid trying to get it in
By doing everything I can except for fitting in
Man, I'm sitting in a throne on my own
There ain't no competition, I'm alone in my zone
From a city where the kids is so accident prone
To call Jones Bureaux home is a fail loving song
And they don't understand that but show me where the map at
And I'll point out the zones where the niggas set the traps at
And when you grow around that, you gotta face found facts
You's a statistic but ain't no different from any other brother
Who made it out the gutter then show all them mother suckers
You know how to get them numbers

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Donnis]
In ’93, I chose the rhyme, that rhyme chose me
And in ’03, we almost had the whole deal
But watch this, yeah, I bet we get ‘em for the whole meal
They give me cold chills, just to think about all the shit I had done
Just to be number one, I missed more than one birthday or vacay
And I say if I could take it back, what I delay
I would ‘cause my family more important than the fortunes
‘Cause now I'm the captain of the plane
And if I turn around then all the shit’ll be in vain
So I'mma maintain my little altitude, I'm maintaining the attitude
Then keeping y'all first ‘cause this rap shit the worst, wassup?
