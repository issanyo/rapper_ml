[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Don’t look back ‘cause we’re all like lightning
Here today, then we’re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning
Don’t look back ‘cause we’re all like lightning
Here today, then we’re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning

[Verse 1: Donnis]
If you stand for nothing, you’ll fall for it all, times is hard
These people is losing they jobs, my Homegirl Michelle out here
Losing her mom and nah, they ain’t got a cure for cancer
Her little sister looking up to me for answers
All I can do is sit her down and read her the pamphlet
But what I’m supposed to say when her mama just vanish?
Gone in an instant, God, if you hear this, I need your assistance
I wanna be different but all they wanna hear about is drugs and pimp shit
Who gon’ make a difference? I guess these niggas came with the wrong intentions
Manolo got fired, they ain’t give him his pension
Eight years out in Couveya, he played his position
And now he serving things just to make him a living
We here on a mission and it starts in the mirror, Lord, can you hear my prayer?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Donnis]
When I say this, some people may start to hate me
Scared to get a government money to get a Haiti
Saw what they did with FEMA, scared to be a believer
Donnis no longer rapper, nah, now I’d rather be teacher
The day I saw my preacher in a Phantom with security guards
He said what up Don? I just gave him a nod
Do we need all these things to get closer to God?
Then my Auntie Taj bought us Gucci ties, see, where she reside is where dreams die
And they don’t resurrect, they live in them projects
And them government projects don’t help ‘em the way you think
Sometimes I just think that they just want us to lose
I see how we depicted on the six o’clock news
They feed us drugs and booze until we dazed and confused
Damn, I refuse to become another statistic to get caught in the system
