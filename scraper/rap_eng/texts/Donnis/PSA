[Intro]
Phil Connors: I'm a god
Rita: You're God?
Phil: I'm a god, I'm not thee God. I don't think
Phil: Because you survived a car wreck?
Waitress: You folks ready to order?
Phil: I didn't just survive a wreck, I wasn't just blown up yesterday. I had been stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hung, electrocuted and burned
Rita: Oh really?
Phil: Every morning, I wake up without a scratch on me, without a dent in the fender. I am an immortal

[Verse 1: Donnis]
They can’t get over my bars, they like an obstacle
I give ‘em to you in bulk, you know how Costco do
Shit, I came from Uncle Sam’s club
I know about landmines and why I am blowing up
Because these niggas keep stepping
And it ain’t in the name of love, see they'll be
Shooting at the clouds if they know your dreams above average
And you in the pursuit of happiness
They don’t want you to be Big Willie
Singing "welcome to Miami" down at Wet Willies
Haters need some TLC, uh, uh, no Chilli
Ain’t no love in the heart of the city
They showed us Chilly and uh, Gucci Mane say burr
And I have to concur with Mister LaFleur
With all this country shit they talking, I had to get on my grind
I ain’t have an option, career moving fast like an auction
One million, two million, three million, okay
Nigga sold his soul for a dollar and a dream
The dollar’s gone but the dream moving full steam
Talking Amtrak, went on a trip and back, gone was gone
But Atlantic still profit from that, so they put my life on the line
So I took my pen and pad and made a whole another design
But I can’t get my A&R on the line ‘cause the other rapper he signed
Started getting some shine like Shyne in ‘01 before he loaded up his gun
And I applaud him, phenomenal as I hide behind this tip like a Navajo
Listening to Outkast themes, wondering if my dreams belong on the big screen
‘Cause in the big scheme, they’re just a little thing so fuck famous
Let’s get legendary so all our mamas and sisters ain’t secretaries
‘Cause as of now, it look hereditary
