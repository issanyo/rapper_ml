[Intro: Donnis]
Run for your life
Run from the light

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Constellations illuminate the sky-y-y-y
Dreams unheard and deferred I know why
I know why
Cause it gets starry eyed
In the Southern Lights
In the Southern Lights
Lights...
Lights...

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Back when every Friday's dinners was from Mrs. Winters
In Mrs. Williams' chorus class I was sangin' tenor
Tryna figure how a nigga get his paper up
I sold Blow-Pops, Moon Pies, and Kool-Aid Cups
Saddleton Middle School
Where we let children ridicule
Cause we thought we were really cool sippin' brews and skippin' school
Shit
Skip-parties was the lick
Young girls drop it low
Shakin' ass and hittin' splits
To the newest 3 6 song
"Slob On My Knob"
See were grown then
So now we act like kids
Ain't gotta tell us we ain't livin' right
But still survivin' every night in them Southern Lights
Every night in them Southern Lights
Still survivin' every night in them Southern Lights...

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Constellations illuminate the sky-y-y-y
Dreams unheard and deferred I know why
I know why
Cause it gets starry eyed
In the Southern Lights
In the Southern Lights
Lights...
Lights...

[Verse 2: Donnis]
????????? shoppin'
Bape diamond watch with the wristband option
Open face grill
Paid two-fifty for the bottoms
I'm awesome in that hatchback Honda
Goin' to see some bitches out in ???
Her momma don't mind if we cut so we need condoms
Black lifestyles, suburban white gal singin "Love in her mouth" She want love in her mouth
So I cum in her mouth
Surprised her parents even let us come in they house
Cuz them crosses still burnin' bright ever night
Out here, underneath them southern lights


Run for your life
Run from the light

[Hook (With Donnis talking in the background)]

This dream right here?
Hell, I pray so much about it I need some knee pads
Andre 3000 of the legendary Outkast

But, some nights I come home to high to pray
But I get on my back anyway, and meditate
Khujo Goodie of the legendary Goodie Mob

Shit...
You can pray all you want to
Not too many of us make it out of the...
Southern lights
The southern lights
Southern lights
Lights
Lights
Lights....
