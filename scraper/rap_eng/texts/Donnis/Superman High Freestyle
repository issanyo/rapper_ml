[Donnis]
I’m so drunk off the lifestyle, high off this little fame
Money changed everything, I will never be the same, I’m trying to maintain
But I’m moving so fast that I’m swerving into your lane
All gassed up my nigga, yeah it’s propane
‘Cause my idols say I’m dope nigga, cocaine
I keep a bad Asian bitch, get lo mien along the egg roll and the testicles
They all know they want some fun, young guy
And if they got that Mary J, they know I will oblige
Haters on the increase as I am on the rise
Though it’s hard to hear you niggas when I’m way up in the sky
No G4 nor G5, go to first class A.K.A skipping class
Just to step out with the academy, scholars
It only makes sense, we the ones with the dollars
Keep your bitch on a collar and please don’t let her loose
She wanna hang, no noose, KKK, it’s so posse for me to say I’m the best
Though it looks that way, all I did was pray, knees got swollen
Window got closed and the door bust open, ram
Now I’m in this bitch, straight up it’s my time, yeah the clock say six
They can say what they want, throw stones, throw sticks
When you a star, you just prone to this, I’m alone in this
Yup and you can see my insecurity, that’s why I got the jewelry
The shine is so new to me, why I need the money? The cars? The clothes?
Pussy rule the world, I just do it for the hoes
I tell her how it is, the cons, the pros, the hate, the love, the highs, the lows
Little nigga balling, man I’m Muggsy Bogues
Yeah I’m playing for the ring, it’s funny ‘cause my girl playing for the same thing
She tell me that she love me, I don’t know what that mean
Especially since now I’m on that Hollywood scene
Where everything’s illusion but everything I dreamed
This is my movie scene, I promise I'mma kill it, yeah
I promise I'mma kill it until I tell them niggas roll the credits
