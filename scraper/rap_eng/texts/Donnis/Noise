Noooise
Noooise
Noooise
Noooise
I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do wanna do what I...
I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do (wanna) what I what I want
I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do wanna do what I...
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like
I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do wanna do what I...
I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do (wanna) what I what I want
I, I, I, I, I do what I wanna do wanna do what I...
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like

[Chorus]
I do what I wanna do that's all that ever matter
Never been one to chase what those other people been after
Fame mean nothing to me, their names mean nothing to me
So if you saying I've changed, it's clear that you never knew me
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like, I do what I like, I do what I like
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like, you get with my crew so we can ride all night (all night, all night, all night, all night...)

Make some noise, noooise
Make some noise, noooise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise

[Chorus]
I do what I wanna do that's all that ever matter
Never been one to chase what those other people been after
Fame mean nothing to me, their names mean nothing to me
So if you saying I've changed, it's clear that you never knew me
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like, I do what I like, I do what I like
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like, you get with my crew so we can ride all night (all night, all night, all night, all night...)

Make some noise, noooise
Make some noise, noooise
Make some noise
Druuuunk Heavyweight
Lorin's in the place
Let it crash like a million tons
No rest for the wickedest
Always ridiculous
Never out done
We gone to correctional
Strictly professional
Multi-directional, style
Aiming straight for your head
We think the unthinkable
Sink the unsinkable
Break the unbreakable
Keep it going crazy in here

[Chorus]
I do what I wanna do that's all that ever matter
Never been one to chase what those other people been after
Fame mean nothing to me, their names mean nothing to me
So if you saying I've changed, it's clear that you never knew me
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like, I do what I like, I do what I like
I do what I wanna do, I do what I like, you get with my crew so we can ride all night (all night, all night, all night, all night...)
