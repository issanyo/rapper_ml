[verse 1]
Hello, I'm Donnis
And I provide the future supersonic
All the girls want to jump on it
And the niggers say they want it
Cause I'm fresh, yes like a box of Krispy Kremes
I'm 100 miles and running and I won't run out of steam
You can dream (dream)
Like you was Martin Luther King
Yeah, she used to be your girl but now she's starting second stream
On my team
Yep, Donnis put her on the roster
And her ass so fat that she don't even got the proper posture
She's a monster
Yeah, I know it hurts she leave with me
In that G5 SUV
With the speakers bumping me
Heading to the waffle house for Patty Melts with extra cheese
Nigga please
Country rappin' ATL oh yeah that's me
Rocking flip-flops with my socks man I'm country to the T
Woah is me
I am everything your boyfriend wants to be
Tell your friends Comfort Inn they can meet us there at 3
It be me up in this hizzle in room 32 3B

Hey radio man
You gonna play my jam
Radio's gone mad
Wave your hands and dance
Cause we got that supersonic, sonic, sonic
Donnis got that supersonic, sonic, sonic
For you baby
Hey radio man
You gonna play my jam
Radio's gone mad
Wave your hands and dance
Cause we got that supersonic, sonic, sonic
Donnis got that supersonic, sonic, sonic
For you baby

[Verse 2]
I get paper
Yeah
Like a brand new trapper keeper
I just fuck and then I leave her
Safe to say I have amnesia
Who are you?
Ouuu
Girl you thick like Elmer's Glue
Let me in your intersection
Cause I fuck with NextSelection
Here's a question
Yeah?
Have you ever hung with stars
Cause you acting as if you don't know who the fuck I are
Here's my card (card)
Call me when you get some sense
Understand that I'm the hottest and that's in the present tense
That is now
Wow
Guess I'm something like the truth
When I pull up in my Phantom all the girls are getting spooked
I know it's scary
And that make pussies chase like Tom and Jerry
They go down and they come up and say it tastes like Ben and Jerry's
Ice-creams on my feet
Make the whole outfit complete
Three finger ring gleam
They can't fault complete technique
I'm just the shit
And if you rap I'm saying you should quit
Because I'm young, fly and rad and quite awesome with them beats

[Hook x2]

Woo
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

A-T-L-A-N-T-A
A-T-L-A-N-T-A
