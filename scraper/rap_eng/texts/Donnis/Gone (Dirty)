In the middle of the club blowin indo
Rolling up with swishers sweet, that's as fat as Mr. Winslow
Cause right now only family matters
And all these other niggas pissed cause they got little bladders
I came to shout at haters dreams kill they self esteem
Don't try to make it now my nigga this ain't maybelline
You have made it seem no body like me
And now I ain't gay so I don't care if niggas like me
B*tches know I'm cool and I rock like mikey
I, I, I rock things way out of your price range
We don't look at price tags never will never have
When you see my chick you see a chick that you will never have
And that's a concept you will never grasp
I'm the sh*t fertalize Iin that greeny the grass
I'm bout to eat Ramadan watch these niggas fast
Now puff puff pass now and pour another glass

We on
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone

( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)

My momma asked me is the bragging really necessary
I say no but this shit is gonna make me legendary
And I apologize for cussing, but when it come to rap I don't apologize for nothing
Disgusting nigga yuck to the maximum
These rap niggas Rerun I'm yelling what's happening
Even if they deaf they fucking with closed captioning
When you niggas dis me you ain't gettin no reaction
Cause emotions is for women and niggas who just be sittin when they pissin I ain't asking for permission
I'll just ask for they forgiveness later on
After I take the throne and bring it back to my home
No we on like the opposite of off, come from the same cloth
Like TI and some Andre, Hov and some kanye
So how could they nay-say that donnis ain't the illest where even the hottest niggas consider the boy a menace
No we on

Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
