[Hook: Brandon Hines]
Never really been good at expressing myself
So I chose to write you a song
All the times that we had, good and the bad
I never meant to do you wrong
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex
Song for every ex that I have
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex
Song for every ex that I have
Song for every ex

[Verse 1: Donnis]
This song is for my exes
Not to be specific
Ain’t asking for forgiveness
Just take a minute, listen
Envision what this could be
What this would be if you and me
Could just see eye to eye
And why we broke up? I don’t really know why
And do I want it back? I ain’t even gon' lie
Nah, I ain’t even gon' lie
Not a day goes by I ain’t thinking 'bout you
Or trying to come through, but you can do you
And I'ma do me 'cause truthfully
Ain’t no nigga cool as me
But missing how we used to be
I’m missing how we used to be

[Hook: Brandon Hines]
Never really been good at expressing myself
So I chose to write you a song
All the times that we had, good and the bad
I never meant to do you wrong
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex
Song for every ex that I have
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex
Song for every ex that I have
Song for every ex

[Verse 2: Donnis]
And I don’t wanna fuck every girl in the world
No, not every girl in the world
No, wherever I may be in the world
If we been there right, then I care
'Cause I'm reminded of you
And if what mama tell me about timing is true
It’ll all come back
Or I’ll fall back
'Cause you’ll call back
But take it from me, I’m all out of tears
They drown in the biz, so no more the biz
And I don’t mean to treat you different
'Cause baby, you so significant
But I’m no longer interested
No, I’m no longer interested

[Hook: Brandon Hines]
Never really been good at expressing myself
So I chose to write you a song
All the times that we had, good and the bad
I never meant to do you wrong
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex
Song for every ex that I have
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex
Song for every ex that I have
Song for every ex

[Verse 3: Donnis]
If you listening now, I apologize
Ain’t here to point fingers, ain’t here to tell lies
It’s the way that I feel inside
That drives me insane on days like this
So I get high, then I feel low
And I don’t know which way to go
So I send texts to you, make calls
And I run game and you won’t fall for that
Say your new man ain’t all of that
But you say he treats you nice
But I’m the one who did everything you like
And if you leave him now
It just wouldn’t be right
So you stay there and I'ma hold tight
And I'ma wait for them blocked calls at night
And I'ma wait for them blocked calls at night

[Hook: Brandon Hines]
Never really been good at expressing myself
So I chose to write you a song
All the times that we had, good and the bad
I never meant to do you wrong
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex
Song for every ex that I have
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex
Song for every ex that I have
Song for every ex

[Outro: Donnis & Brandon Hines]
I wrote this song
Song for every ex that I have
Girl, I wrote this song
I wrote this song
I miss you
And I'm just being real with you
Donnis
B Hines
Oh, I wrote this song
