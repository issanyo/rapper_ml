[Hook]
More fire, more fire, more fire, more fire
More fire, more fire, more fire, more fire
And we don’t need no water, let that motherfucker burn
No, we don’t need no water, let that motherfucker burn
No, we don’t need no water, let that motherfucker burn, burn motherfucker, burn

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Donnis, I’m exactly what a don is
Boy, I stand behind my bars like a convict
And every time I spit a verse, you reminded
Why Atlantic signed it and why you never signed shit
Nigga, what I’m about to drop is timeless
Like a nigga who just lost his Timex, I’m next, no others, Southern
I swear my teachers said I’d never be nothing but fuck ‘em
‘Cause I’m coming so tell them hoes to open wide
I’m on a star track, welcome to the enterprise
I swear the rise is making me less humble
My mama said she don’t like me but she love ’cause she supposed to
I got a father that I ain’t ever spoke to, watch your boys turn bitches to raw food
But on the up and up, these hoes wanna come through
And everything’s fabulous and I ain’t even got a clue what to do but bring they ass…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Donnis]
Look, little nigga, you are number two
And that don’t mean that you the shit nigga, get a clue
‘Cause I'mma kill it with a dagger and a diamond boo
So tell Professor Plum and other rappers they done
Yup, I’m on a mission for the title like my bitch
But I ain’t talking nothing bridal, Alfred Hitchcock
I’m about to go psycho while y’all keep playing, Tyco
Top ten, double XL don’t make typos
You ate last year but now you about to see lipo
I nip tuck it and then take all of your duckets
And spend it down in Vegas on weed, booze and luggage
Bitches to rub and tug it ‘cause I love a happy ending
No Disney, don’t kid me ‘cause down here in the South
We bear arms like a grizzly, believe it or not Mr. Ripley
Simply, I only came to do one thing and that’s bring…
