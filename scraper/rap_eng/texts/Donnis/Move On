[Hook]
I think it’s time that you move on, somebody tell these niggas that it’s over
So pack it up and then move on, this time around, it’s only getting colder
Shorty, sit your ass down, shorty, sit your ass down
You had your run, you had your run and now you’re done
I think it’s time that you move on, somebody tell these niggas that it’s over

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Aye, aye, aye keep it moving shorty, ain’t nothing to see here
But see that you are closer to the bottom than may appear
You think that everybody know your name, boy, this ain’t Cheers
We’ll take your little spot, this here is musical chairs when the music stop
We back to the block so we don’t care about your chain or that little car you got
Failure’s not an option, it’s more a promise for these other niggas
Surely that can’t be for Donnis, yeah, that’s for whatchmacallit
Spitting them candy bars, niggas’ minds is on Mars
I can hear you haters snickering, giggling, lonely, I live close
You so Gilligan and I’m so fly, I’m on top of my shit again
Thank you very much, your ship set sail and then it sunk
In memory of you, we pop bottles and light blunts, I lied, no we don’t
You just another pussy rapper gone, until you are, we dedicate this song

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
I get going when I go in, got bad bitches on my groin
Oh, you and that girl go out, so? Why she about to go into that whip that I be rolling
While video game controlling? She posted up like she posing
My Lindsey but no Lohan and my flow is Grey’s Anatomy
For slow ones, man, I body it, I’m on my Konami shit
One inch punch karate kicks, see my way like lobbyists or Gotti’s kids
In all honest-ness, I’m quiet as a mouse with my modest-ness
So catch up like a condiment, you don’t know my accomplishments
Taking over villages, burning down cottages
Selling out venues and panty raiding at colleges
Playing Raiden on Mortal Kombat ain’t even as shocking as this
Vizzy here, busy year, we raising our toasts
Up in that bread like raisins in toast, losing, I don’t do that, I been here
How could I move back to that city that I move at? You new cats, I think that…

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Donnis]
See, many men get fifty cent and think they got a dollar
I say they should see Dre or any other doctor
To prescribe they ass some medicine if they think they better than
My sign’s always greater than, there can’t be no equal
Yup, or a lesser evil, I dare devils to come test me
I am so Evil Kenevil, vroom, way above you niggas
I am married to the game, you got wedding day jitters
She got jive, breasts and thighs, I only fuck with Misses Winners
Nah, I don’t fuck with chicken head hoes, higher education
But know how to drop it low, keep that Libra balance
Fuck me like a Scorpio, all I do is win according to my horoscope
Yeah, we in the building, get with the program and stop being a doorman dom, man
I built it ground up, copy the floor plan, you already copied the flow, damn
