Chorus:
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you

Hey, listen!
Come through and let a nigga put it down for you
Ever had a nigga send from out of town for you
Signs in that baggage claim,that read yo name
Just go with them in that lincoln car
Make sure they know who bitch you are...
When they drop you off at this 5 star
But it's general, in general I'm saying no
5 days, 4 nights, niggas ain't living that sort of life
Room service better get the order right
Nothing like summer time Florida nights
I live for live, so we do it bigger than last time
Doing it like it's our last time
Bottle poppin our past time
And it's past time for us to make it sexy
Though I know you in that dress
You know I'd rather see you naked singing

Chorus:
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you

How you want it, on some new House of Balloons shit
Or just quite cause the music continues to be so useless
They can hear you loud and clear, ten four, ten four
Flight at 6 but Its already missed, cause I need an hour
And you gone need a shower
Cause you gotta check in, and your bags over weight
Spend another hour with the TSA
Cause your lost i.d. never got turned in
I feel like you gave it to one of your girlfriends
Right, cool I knew that, it's only right you do that
Cause that molly got you zooted
And now just wanna do it
Till yo next flight out to Houston or maybe you should stay here
Exchanging sexual favors 'till you're waking up the neighbors!
Singing
Chorus

Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
