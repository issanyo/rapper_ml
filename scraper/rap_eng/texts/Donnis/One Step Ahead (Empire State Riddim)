I'm only one step ahead of heartbreak
One step ahead of misery
One step is all I'd have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be

I'm only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips

Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?

I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards

Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from you

[Outro: Donnis]
What's happening shawty, you know what this is. [?] blunts! My boy, what's happening shawty man, you know man. I told y'all I was gonna do this drop for you shawty, but you know I kept procrastinating man and that wasn't the move. I've been busy working on Southern Lights, man, out here in the A-Town but right now I'm out in LA, and I told my fans I was gonna do your motherfucking drop because you're my nigga and shit
