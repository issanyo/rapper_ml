[Intro]
Riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang
Aye I’m just riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Notorious for rolling B-I-G, my hustle grand
You ain’t see me out with T-I-P? You minimal, I max nigga, 3D
Push button TV, vintage whip, ‘63, six plus three sitting up under the seat
She six times three sitting next to me, if age ain’t nothing but a number
Better see an I.D or be gone for the Summer, speaking of Summer
Yeah I’m about to take that, these wheels cost me a fortune, Sajak
And my niggas gon’ find you, I chase money, I don’t need to remind you
Would chase bitches but ain’t never got the time to but I take some head
If she in the red like Piru, there’s some things I can’t avoid
She from a single mother home so I fill that void

[Hook]
When I’m riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang
Aye I’m just riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang

[Verse 2: Donnis]
Out sipping Pellegrino with my Filipino, about to hit the North Side
And see my nigga C-Note, gold chain tucked in, not they’re here to debo
Moving fast, put your ass from sixty to zero, neighborhood hero
South Side legend, see me riding, throw the deuces nigga, Ronald Reagan
Hit first gear, switch to second, hit tree sound, start up a session
Sounds to the beat, light up a swisher, niggas feel my 16’s like a child molester
Made me push your T on ‘em, gold chain made me Mr. T on ‘em
Yeah nigga, I am rolling with the A-Team, Academy, Pyramid Gang
They mad at me but I don’t hear a thing ‘cause my speakers just bang, bang, bang

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And I’m rocking and I’m rolling, ain’t no stopping ‘cause I’m going
Till the wheels fall off, till the wheels fall off
And I’m rocking and I’m rolling, ain’t no stopping ‘cause I’m going
Till the wheels fall off, till the wheels fall off

[Outro]
Aye I’m just riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang
Aye I’m just riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang
