I'm late on this one, it's cool
Still think this beat is pretty neat though
It's pretty awesome
Gucci!

[Verse One]
Okay I'm Donnis and any bitch you want uhuh I got it
My gizzard tectonic is something faster than Sonic
Bitch I vomit on any beat, Any O-N-E
Cause I am the O-N-E, like N-E-O, Reeves
Word to the tats on my sleeves
Turn no money to show money show
Money to bought money Scrooge McDuck
Swimming in it, you can't even float money
Hold up is that dope money
Hold up is that blow money
Yeah if your nose runny
Hahaha we call that Kleenex
Mj, Billie jean checks
Woo show me love, that's a whole bunch of puff
Drizzy keep the jacket all Donnis want is the glove
I'm a moon walker, shit talker, Donnis Skywalker Yeah!
Every verse magic, I'm feeling like Harry Potter
Relax grasshopper, I am the holy father
And these niggas is sneakers, I ain't takling Foot Locker
They will set you up proper, just to knock your ass down
I'm just waiting for my green day, when I come around
I eat when the sun is up and hunt when the sun is down
It so sad Misses Krump don't want her son around
But everywhere they go they play him in surround sound
I am down for the cause, if the cause is The Academy
Bitch do not be absentee, are cars got Go-Go gadgetry
Snap your seat-belt rapidly, Puoom I'm so gone
You won't find a nigga cool as me, won't catch no nigga cool as me
I'm not into violence but I'll hang you by your family tree
You can trace your ancestry and see that ya'll some hoes
Live from the 404, this Donnis if you ain't know
I'm a young Leroy, you can see I got that glow
Lets go

[Singing]
In the chain with the big guns
Gonna find your bitch and I'm gon' fuck
20 pound inches on my new truck
I'm lying, I'm lying
Fuck it
