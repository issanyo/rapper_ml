[Verse: 1]

The education they give us seem to be minimal
Dont waste your time on them niggas they gon be criminals
And when they say it they mean it
Its so cruel and demeaning
What the fuck are they teaching?
As I sit here daydreaming about Lacresha
Light skin, long hair, all the right features
And then (beep beep) there go my nigga E beeper
Interrupt my dream, Interrupted class
Teacher confiscated damn thats my nigga ass
And not because of school
Its because rent is due by 2
And his momma got laid off so he trying to pull through
For the fam, do my teacher understand?
Naw.. cause she ain't never had it like that
She ain't never been young, wild and black
With the odds stacked forced to cop crack from the dopeman
To sit around a good meal and hold hands

[Hook:]
Blackberry molasses
One things that will never change
You gotta keep pushing on over the sun
Itâ€™s gonna be some hard they can pay/headache and pain

[Verse 2:]

9 year old me wants to be rapstar
25 year old me wants to run away far
Into the unknown
Started not give a fuck about no microphone
I spend my nights alone praying
Saying, "if I could get one hit, i'd stay far away from satan."
Till then ill be smoking and drinking
Porno-watching, five-finger discount shopping
Down that old that hill
Trying to make history and have a story to tell
My future daughter and son who have just begun to be thought about
But they ain't comin' til this rap working out
Im trying to figure how to get up out my momma house
Im on TV watching me from my momma couch
Feeling like time is running out
I think its time to re-route..
