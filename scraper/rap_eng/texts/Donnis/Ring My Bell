[Intro: Dev]
(Donnis!) Ring my bell, ring my bell…

[Verse One: Donnis]
What you doing with all that shit?
Make me wanna come over, give your mama a kiss
Tell your daddy I’m as good as it gets
And that you had a broken heart but it just got stitched
You got a ex-boyfriend ‘cause he just got ditched
And he had a little burn like a cop had did
Way hotter than a dime boy, I just got rich
So your blew the 250, Abercrombie & Fitch
Girl, you know them don’t fit, you thick
Like a chocolate milkshake when you take your first sip
Matter of fact, I should be tasting that shit
It’s so good as soon as it hit your lips
I frank the tape right after the first drink
I’m old school little mama, let it seep in
We ain’t got to hit the car to go streaking
All wet, faucet, got her leaking

[Hook: Dev]
You can ring my bell, no, I won’t tell, no, I won’t tell
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling my bell, no, I won’t tell
Back, back, forth and forth, this is what I waited for
Back, back, forth and forth, this is what I waited for

[Verse Two: Donnis]
Let me wrap your legs around my head
And wear you like the crown that you are
Seen too many people at home
Maybe we should do this in my car, sex trafficking
Fat black pussy cat, that’s a jaguar
I’mma pull up to your bumper, no Patra
Then we go, go green like a rasta
Speaking Patwa to Kardinal Offishall and you know that’s you
Let’s put this thing together like two plus two
That equals four more bars that I have in store
To explain to you I’m not gaming you like I lost Vegas commission
Girl, I’m Bobby Brown dope, new edition, get with me
And get Whitney, dope dick take you a different world, ask Whitley

[Hook]

[Bridge: Donnis]
This the type of shit that make a motherfucker
Get a whole bunch of ones and just throw them in the air
While she work that ass to the ground
Girl, work that ass to the ground right now
Shawty, work that ass to the ground, go

[Hook]

[Outro: Dev]
You can ring my bell, ring my bell, I won’t tell
Back, back, forth and forth, this is what I waited for
Back, back, forth and forth, this is what I waited for
