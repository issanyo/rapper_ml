[Intro: Donnis]
Donnis, Chiddy Bang, hit 'em with a blunt, Xaphoon Jones, we outcha, ow

[Chorus: Neil Garrard]
Follow us, now
Try to all the way, now
It's not another let down
Got somethin' to say right now
Follow us, now
Try to all the way, now
It's not another let down
Got somethin' to say right now

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Yeah I've got something to say
With one stroke of the pen
I tune in to your satellite radio or FM station
I've been patiently waiting to weigh in
Been under construction for two years
But now it's 'bout that time I double-dutch my way in
Left foot, right foot, steppin' over biters
It's like the game is haunted 'cause there's so many ghostwriters
Me, see, I'm a lifer with supply that may seem endless
Straight rider like a biker on a chopper with a hit list
Witness the nigga that spit that vicious
Pit bull attack shit when it comes to this rap shit
Daddy Fat Sax, bitch, follow us

[Chorus: Neil Garrard]
Follow us, now
Try to all the way, now
It's not another let down
Got somethin' to say right now
