[Hook]
Dream chaser, dream chaser, I am everything that dreams are made of
Ooh, I hear ‘em talking, ooh, I know they talking
Ooh, I hear ‘em talking but I won’t let ‘em bring me down
Ooh, I hear ‘em talking, ooh, I know they talking
Ooh, I hear ‘em talking but I won’t let ‘em bring me down

[Verse One: Donnis]
Excuse me, have you ever had a dream? I have
Dreams of being something better than I am, you know
Rich as Hov, cool as ‘Ye, wake up every day in another state
Another stage, on another plane, sky high, I’m flying now
Dance on the Moon, fly on a cloud, I just wanna make my mama proud
But every door I’m knocking on, they say I’m not allowed
Raps ain’t good enough, style ain’t fly enough
But I’m a starry night sky, watch me light it up
And leave ‘em star struck, come and fly with us
Live from the dirty South, now watch me tidy up

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, I won’t let ‘em bring me down
Oh no, oh no, oh no, aye shawty, I won’t let ‘em bring me down

[Verse Two: Donnis]
Now imagine going from nothing to something
The same folks that was fronting is now in your face blushing
And smiling, what? Is they wilding? Try to control my temper
They act like they don’t remember last Winter’s coldest December
I was sleeping in Sasha's, depending on her mama to feed me
Hold me and clothe me when nobody else would show me no love
Or give a fuck when I was way down on my luck
And now my fan base building up and I’m almost famous as fuck
So I don’t have nothing to give you, I don’t even give a fuck
And you know what really sucks? When I was stuck inside the muck
You wanted me to self-destruct, now I’m better than ever
And now it’s my pleasure to write you this little letter
With all my appreciation, thank you for all the hating
That’s what kept me play making and turned Donnis into Peyton
See, that was the motivation for me to take on a nation
I waited so patient just to hear your fake congratulations, good night

[Hook & Bridge]
