Look me in my eyes, here’s where I reside
Lost all of my friends ‘cause of selfishness and pride
Needless to say, I’m all alone but most importantly
I guess that means I’m in my zone
Pictures of my girl’s best friend inside my phone
I fuck her while she gone, that’s the type of shit I’m on
The show must go on, I don’t stop for nothing
And that includes feelings so fuck how you feeling
Nothing’s better than the truth so from this point forward
I guess I’mma let it loose, got nothing else to lose
Got no one else to love, it’s always just been me
I ain’t never known an us, I am not the one to trust
I have fallen so deep, I use the money as a crutch
Only thing that picks me up, she don’t never let me down
Or pack up and go fuck with other niggas outta town
Some nights, I wanna drown in the whiskey
Let the weed just wash away the memories
Of anything that ever meant shit to me, this is a nightmare
This is misery, I can’t control myself mentally, I’m going crazy
I’m going crazy ‘cause the friends that are saying I have changed
Haven’t remained the same, look at what they’ve became
They watch me sell my soul for a cheap price
And didn’t nobody think twice about me or the life I was taking on
I made it but I don’t think that I’mma make it home
I made it but I don’t think that I’mma make it home, I don’t think that I’mma make it home
I made it but I don’t think that I’mma make it home, I don’t think that I’mma make it home
But I don’t think that I’mma make it home
