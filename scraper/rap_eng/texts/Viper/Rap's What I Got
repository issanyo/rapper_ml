[Verse 1: Viper The Rapper]
Locked in the game, now it's time to do this
Roamin' through the land, like Popeye and Buddhists
Ocean on fire, while my boys in the back
By the railway, second lane to the left stack
Off on a mission, to move the sound
Uptown, goin' down, [?] beats all around
Stockin' the arena, with words and phrases
While cash work around, like mice in mazes
As our tunes, fill the whole room
To ride [?] is what I live for
I wanna see you [?] by the age of 33
[?], and all my homies feel me
Now we're gettin' paid in a major ass way
Exchanging words like train cars daily
[?] cash, to rappin' G
That's [?], big dog on the real
[?] like there's a motherfucker
Woulda have to change, and he's [?], [?]
[?], the player god arrived
In your stereo, jammin' it like Pac'
In this ocean, there's some people real
Tryna' catch a G sleepin' when a balla's [?]
And it's fucked up, it's just whack in a bitch
Checkin' ya dome, four/four [?], shit, quick pass, Lee
But I got control, of a body
My shit like a [?]
I'ma fall through pumpin' that thang
[?] ghetto game
[?] element [?]
Flyin' through the urban beat just like a dove
Where it go, shinin' bright like my shades
Rollin' to the clubs, that's keepin' it real
Playa [?] A.C.T
All them boys gon' be, that boy J.R.I.D
Yes it's me, and I betta fit it up
Ballin' through, [?] showin' much, much love
Comin' [?], and I'm [?], and I'm pumpin' and screwin'
How the boys in the deep south, we do
Much love to the thugs at the 8th and [?]
Much love [?] got goin' on
Rippin' into the mic and I'ma keep on clippin' it
Keep on rippin' it, keep on [?] it
Watch me [?] microphone, 10 triple up O
That's how it is, it's your boy triple O
Comin' through, makin' [?]
Baby bro, you know me, it's just your baby bro
And I'ma [?] rhymes till the day that I die
And [?] and [?] and [?] and [?]
