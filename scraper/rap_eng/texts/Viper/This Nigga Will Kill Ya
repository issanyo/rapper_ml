(Hook x2)
Heartless
Nigga
That will
Kill ya

Fuck these haters
I'm tryna' put them to sleep
Domeshot(?) partner
On the concrete
A lot of these niggas
Takin' life as a joke
But it won't be funny
When that ass get smoked
The hollows go out
Of my nine too fast
You too slow to dodge
And you can't blast
See the lest of these bustas
Means more hoes for a thug
So I'm quick to catch
A nigga square in the mug
Like the invisible man
I appear out of nowhere
And I gives a fuck
If your life ain't far
Cause I'ma keep ballin' like crazy
And a mark's hair split open won't phase me
?? an emergency
9-1-1 I did surgery
But instead of a scalpel
To open him up
These boys got split
With the 20 round stuff

Heartless
Nigga
That will
Kill ya

I give's a fuck about your goatee
Fool
You supposed to have one
Punk
Your under 6'2''
Plus you got a small chin
These homos workin' my last nerve
Time and time again
Now you know I give's a fuck who you is
Oh you a rap star?
Fuck you too then
These boys trippin'
Makin' a baller act
It's time to grab my Glock
And blast on these fags
I'm tryna' understand
How this is goin' down
But I ain't trippin'
Cause everyday I see less of these clowns
Hope these boys are cowards
Walkin' round scared to buck
But I'm cracked(?)
That's why I'm hittin' ??
Every other month
You'll meet up later on in life
They'll tell you how I hit that gat
Please, I'm a G, I get down like that
I got these punks on the run
And hoes I left clingin' on me like a dead song
