[Hook]
They saying I'm unique
Cause I sell the best cocaine on the streets
It's bout me they tell you it's A1
I sell the best coke, holla when you want some
They saying I'm unique
Cause I sell the best cocaine on the streets
It's bout me they tell you it's A1
I sell the best coke, holla when you want some

[Verse 1]
I sell the best jay
Smoke it with me
Top grade cocaine
I still sell the sticky
Powder so killer
Swear after one hit
It will make you and yo gal wanna groove it
World class powder
Straight from Colombia
Put it on everything
My coke will numb ya
Certified to be tha best
You ever had
Don’t forget about the horse
'cause it’s gon' keep you glad
My coke so gravy
Otha dealers jealous
When they pushin’ up daisies
Cause they dope
Inferior to mine
HIT ME UP
Imma have you on cloud nine
Link up with your thug
If you ain't scarin'
You gon' fall in love
And my cocaine ….. (?)
I like my competition
Ain't no attitude
Ice-cold
Uncut
Viper, they mad at him

[Verse 2]
Call in when you buyin'
I can get it to ya
My customers stay happy
They keep saying that
I'm the realest
Dope boy that ever lived
'cause all to the dope game I give
My top grade cocaine
You hit it once and it's locked off in your brain
You will float to a new plane
And we ain’t afraid to shoot, take a shot to the vein
Coward people out there
Time to go home
'Cause it’s time to take a hit
Go to another zone
I'm your dope man
But I’ll take a hit with ya
So you can see it's safe and accept the big picture
Cocaine is the movement
Judgemental cowards just gotta do it
Ain't no B-boys beating my prices
And if your money low then my price I'll slice it
Choose me
When you work and relax
I sell powder I sell crack
My work is something like you never experienced
One small sniff on my line you can feel it in
My twenty-packs lovely
Have you up all day
Haters jealous of me
Because they know I sell the best jay
Never caught a dope case
Cause I got the best goods
Customers don't snitch cause I sell the best in tha hood

They saying I'm unique

They saying I'm unique
Cause I sell the best cocaine on the streets
It's bout me they tell you it's A1
I sell the best coke, holla when you want some
