[Intro]
I wanna sleep me a nigga
I wanna murder me a figure
I'mma ball through, all so player
The one malla to mash on these haters

[Verse 1]
I'mma stang licks and I'm gon' chill
I'mma be the one, they pray who blood get spilled
9 milli clipped up, ready to clown
Chain hangin', catch me fallin' through midtown
Word around town j-j-j-jealous of my chain piece
If they reach for it, on my life they gon' meet they G
Rap's best medallion got these hoe-ass niggas jealous
If you try to block my shine I'm killing you and your fella
You broke-ass fools ain't making nan penny
So you wanna hate on me, 'cause I'm making plenty?
That's some bitch shit, nigga you should know better
But since you don't, pussy bitch, your shirt gon' get wetter
You mark-ass niggas don't fight no more
'Cause if you did, on my bitch I'd drop you to the floor
These marks gon' respect my hustle
If they don't we gon' square up and tussle
Take this shit to another zone
Pistol play, iron it out with the chrome

[Hook]
I wanna sleep me a nigga
I wanna murder me a figure
I wanna sleep me a nigga
I wanna murder me a figure

[Verse 2]
These rappers piece 'n' chains look like trash
On the coup look like them got 'em outta garbage bags
Man that shit there make me laugh
Now I understand why my bitch so bad
'Cause bad bitches won't fuck with niggas like that
These yellow-gold ass niggas lookin' like doormats
They wearin' yellow 'cause they yellow, scary cats
Nigga get some white gold and take that bullshit back
Do I gotta teach you dumb rappers everything?
Nothing motherfuckers, go buy some white gold rings
