Sittin on 3s
Flippin plenty
Keepin close company

Sittin on 3s
Flippin plenty
Keepin close company

[Verse 1]
We got 2 choices, to ride or die
So we gone ride through this thing and we gone ride so fly
G'd up, thats what Im talkin bout
And I can't wait till my boys get out
I see my partners throwin love back
As we flippin it up, coz its just like that
I dont understand how them boys is keepin it so real
But we kickin it together and everything is chill
As the world goes round, and keeps on spinnin
We stayin on a mission bout to be big winnin
Study with the game of true Rap Psalms
And straight getting paid as we goin on
It ain't gone stop tho, until the love get drop
We ain't gone stop tho, until the body gets shot
And if it dont, we just gonna keep on hittin
Keep mic trippin, and keep on rippin

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You might see a balla ridin on them 4s
Ridin on low, ridin on the roads
Can you hear the bass bumpin out the back of your car?
Bumpin' so hard, as we travelin' far
We tired of bein broke so we read up on this rap game
To blow up, (and despite the change ?)
The boys throwin up the deuce
Showin much love, as a balla fall through
Yes im gone be ridin through the flavor hood
Where the love is good, bustin rhymes that I should
And it ain't gone ever stop till the casket drop
So move your head and let your body rock
And holler at your boy when its time to come up like a Chips Ahoy!
Cause you know I'm gon' be throwin' it back to you
A ghetto child, super star, young fool

[Chorus]

Sittin on 3s
Flippin plenty
Keepin close company

Sittin on 3s

[Verse 3]
Im ridin' in the middle of a caravan
With the paper and the pen in my hand
I gotta write some lyrics that ballas will hear
That players will feel, that ladies will chill
My homie behind me, he's rollin on 3s
Yes its the truth, yes my boy be a G
I remember back in the day we used to parlay
And stay in this game, thats so player made
But now we done flipped the script, a little bit
Straight getting paid with major hits
And thats what it's all about, you know I gotta clown
Throw up a hand, then put it back down

[Chorus]
Gs
Sittin on 3s
Flippin plenty
Keepin close company
Gs
Sittin on 3s
Flippin plenty
Keepin close company
