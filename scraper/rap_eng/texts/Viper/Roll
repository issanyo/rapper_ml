[Chorus]

These niggas gon' roll
As my girls roll my cash
And they roll that fast
From the past
These niggas gon' roll

[Verse 1]

I gotta ball
Deep in the cut
Ready to blast
On one of these punks
You boys know how
You'll be quick to be smoked
Takin' they life
As I motherfuckin' jump boys rollin'
Dodge with they life
And I don't give a fuck
I'll make a meal out of ya wife
I like to roll
Through the hood in my Benz
And if you ain't a bitch
I ain't makin' a friend
You roll yourself into a wall
When [???] you ain't got it all
I roll
Solo fool, fuck you and your boys
What y'all gonna do?
[???]
Leave you dead in my truck and set fire to my rover
Then I roll out saying fuck my range
I buy another one and give it to a homeless nigga

[Chorus]

These niggas gon' roll
As my girls roll my cash
And they roll that fast
From the past
These niggas gon' roll

[Verse 2]
