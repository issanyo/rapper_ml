[Intro]
Haha
Here's a little something for the hustlers
Yeah

[Hook]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

[Verse 1]
Hater, you, don't even smoke crack, you's a snitch fool
Miss me with that mark game, that's a G, that's him
I'm about to blaze up, even when it's after dim
I changed the game don't get it misunderstood
Hitting it out the glass and that smoke all good
Can't water it with green, get work, got that stick
Stars know I keep it, they on my jock, these haters sit
But when I do smoke some weed
It's straight out that rose, you best believe
But green ain't better than that white, white is so much fun
Seven for forty-five, wholesale gets it done
And I don't care if you judge me
I'm smoking kush, and living so lovely
So stop looking like you're dumb
You know you wanna try, but scared to get some

[Hook]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

[Verse 2]
It's on and poppin'
I'm blazing work, now my destiny ain't stopping
I'm coming up in a song to rap
I sold my soul to Satan but bought it back from God with this song
Y'all haters ain't mallin'
Until you smoke some work and see who really paper calling
Y'all falling off like the last century
No respect from me till you get that cheese
And you see what life is all about
Till then you just a little bitch with a raised snout
I gets my clout from the mainstream
It's always love and death in my dope scene
I'm clowning, and keeping it rock
My coke chopped and screwed cause I'm on the block
I'm movin' coke and smokin' work
All the while keeping y'all haters feelings hurt

[Hook]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
