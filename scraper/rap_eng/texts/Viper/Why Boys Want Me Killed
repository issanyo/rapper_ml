[Hook]
(I know) Could it be my ride?
(the real) Could it be my shine?
(why do these boys) Could it be my cash knots?
(want me killed) Or because of my height?
(I know) Could it be my crib?
(the real) Or the way I live?
(why do these boys) Could it be my dough?
(want me killed) Or why the girls can't leave me alone?

[verse 1]
On the real, all I do is chill
Them boys walk around, with anger concealed
Truth is revealed - I ball
Cake, jewelry, cars, hoop, I got it all

I stand tall as I walk
Diamonds on my neck
Got boys on no-talk
I'm loving the way I'm making this cake
All the cash I'm seeing from the decisions I make

I done set myself up for continual cash
G's up, marks down, as I hide my stash
Keeping dudes on retreat - that's how I'm doin' 'em
They can't get away, bankruptcy pursuin' 'em

Every plan, they done had
To come up in this game, I done trashed
These haters, I done locked
Out this game, that I only rock

In this hustle of infamy
I'm that top choice G
The one they can't fade
The one thats got it made

[Hook]

[verse 2]
In this infamy game
I make more money while punks know your name
I'm infamy-blessed
That's something you don't wanna test

In this lick I'm in
I made it so only I can win
These perceptions are made - reality
Cause they think they gon' cease a G

Cause I always change it up with somethin' new
A new style that can't lose
When these pussy niggas try to steal my swag
So I switch it up again on they ass

You can call me all auto-tune
Computer Viper, that's what it do
So you cats better start playin' the lotto
That's the only way that y'all comin' up, bro
