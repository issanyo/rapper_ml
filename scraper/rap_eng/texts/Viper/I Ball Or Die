[Chorus]

I ball or die
To keep it fly
I ball or die
To keep it fly

[Verse 1]

Boys gon' see how I floss
When I tap 'em cross the head with that sawed off
'cause if you try to catch me for my stack
I'm tryna blow your head clean off of your back
I got too much to lose
So I'm quick to have your folks singin' the blues
With your face down in front of your trues
As a mark ass busta who ain't wanna pay dues
And if they wanna come retaliate
It's a hood war nigga and I'm throwin' the H
Plus I'm chuckin' the A while I'm grippin' a million
Niggas oughta know we'll put you to sleep
These boys don't wanna let flex swing
My venom's the bullets and the foe's my fangs
And my fangs get hot
Hit a hater with the venom and they heart just stop

[Verse 2]

This nigga beggin' for his bitch ass life
Hell na, mark, you about to die
Ain't no more second chances, this is the end
You think I'm gon' let you go so you can come back again?
Fuck that, nigga you crazy
It's time to take a nap, yo eyes about to get hazy
See ya on the other side, tell ya boys I pulled off that -- hoo-ride
Quick shot, time to bounce
Done deal, I'm about to roll out
And to your other partners, last thang I ain't mention
If you're lookin' for ya boy, he behind the buildin' flinchin'
Now they see how hard I go
'cause they takin' time away from me fuckin' a hoe
And that's a no-no to the extreme
I'ma let these bustas know what Viper means

[Chorus]
