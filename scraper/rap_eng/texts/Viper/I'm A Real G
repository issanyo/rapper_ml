You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie

[Verse 1]
I don't understand these niggas
Riding with them bustas like, sis my nigga
What the fuck can another nigga do for you
But talk behind your back, dumbass fool?
But ya'll bustas steady riding packed like bitches
I can't tell if you gals, niggas, or snitches
And to top it off you're scheming on niggas riches
I hope you coming this way, cause I'm leaving you twitchin'
But it ain't just ya'll, it's other rappers too
Dick riding other rappers to get a record deal
You got other rappers nuts in your mouth like a girl
Don't ever bring a rap war to my world
Cause you gon' get defeated
And a new career you gon' be needin'
Back to working at Micky D's
And back to livin' with mommy

[Hook]
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie

[Verse 2]
So my heat, stays on my shelf
For boys who ain't man enough to flow by themself
Gotta have another nigga with ya
But this nine will make both ya faggots get the picture
Split ya wig, right open and leave the coroner scopin'
How many bullets lead to your demise?
And what kind of bullet went in between your boys eyes
Suprise, bitch niggas ya'll stanking
Suprise, i'm still banking
Back to balling and making that cheese
While your taxed and smelling, pushing up daisies
Now, the stories been told
Motherfuck you and your bitchass home
Stop riding with niggas that's old news
And ride solo, fool

[Hook]
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie
