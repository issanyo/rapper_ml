[Intro]
Haha
Here's a little something for you busta's
Yeah

[Chorus]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

[Verse 1]
Hater, you, don't even smoke crack, bitch, you's a mark fool
Motherfuck that ho shit, that's a G, that's him
I'm about to blaze up, 'specially when it's after dinner
I changed the game don't get it misunderstood
Hitting it out the glass and that smoke all good
Can't water it with green, get work, got that stick
Laws know I keep it, they on my dick, these niggas sick
But when I do smoke some weed
I'm straight out that rose, you best believe
But green ain't better than that hard, hard is so much fun
Seven for forty-five, wholesale gets it done
And I don't care if you judge me
I'm smoking cooked, and living so lovely
So stop looking like you're dumb
You know you wanna try, but fail to get some

[Hook]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

[Verse 2]
It's on an' poppin'
I'm blazing white, now my destiny ain't stopping
I'm coming up in a song to rap
I sold my soul to Satan but bought it back from God with this song
Y'all bustas ain't ballin
Until you smoke some work and see who really paper calling
Y'all falling off like the last century
No respect from me till you get that cheese
And you see what life is all about
Till then you just a little bitch with a raised snout
I gets my clout from the mainstream
It's always love and dap in my dope scene
I'm clowning, and keeping it rock
My coke chopped and screwed cause I'm on the block
I'm stinging big and bringing work
All the while keeping y'all haters feelings hurt

[Hook]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
