Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling

[Verse 1]
I ball
I always with it
Nine in the clip
Still waiting for a killing
If i have to, i ain't even tripping
Use the .45 or the [???]
Parlayin', just cruising
Wondering who catch a bruisin
Wondering why bad choices boys choosing
And ended up losing
They lives over bullshit
Like trying to catch a G boy's grip
It ain't nowhere, that shit is played out
And everything that keeps on that get high
But fuck it, don't get shy
I'll leave you hermoraging, bleeding in blood clots
Head down, torn nose, hair knots
In red light, and your hand stops

[Hook]
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling

[Verse 2]
"I can't ball, all i do is ride with it
Why i'm always mad?
Is there some other cash in it?
Why i get sent to the mall?"

Cuz you ain't ballin like a G does
It's best to chill and lay low
Get your shit together
And come back for mo'
Instead of walking 'round like a hoe -
-ass nigga
Cus you broke

These boys sticking like [???] ninja
Run up on me they caught me dead in they clothes
Even if you're rich, you'll still be smoked
Identified on a table by your folks
And no it ain't a hoax
You'll be shotted up for your first word spoke
I don't understand
Why they think I'm playing
These boys speed to a stealth slaying

[Hook]
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
Parlayin', doin my thing
Boys hypnotised, traumatised by the bling
