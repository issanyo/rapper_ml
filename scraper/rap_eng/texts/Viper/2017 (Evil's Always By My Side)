[Hook]
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side

[Verse 1]
Underneath, it's competition's [?]men
On the house, they dead in the basement
...
They can't escape my imminent doom
They like ...
Want to be hard, but you are soft
They can only be on me
There will never be another
That's why they want me under they covers
I discovered
...
Before it's implemented escape
And broke down into something fictitious
These haters can't understand a thug's renditions
It's probably because they all like vape
I stay true to this day while others lose they key
...
That's cuties flop to a hoodlum and triples in doubles
Any other in this grind it's my job to the bodies
That's bad chicks in the ...

[Hook]
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
Under me, it's competition's [?]men
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side

[Verse 2]
Underneath, it's competition's [?]men
On the house, they dead in the basement
On the top, ... to bottom
Am I astronized?
Dangling around with a goon like me ain't wise
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
And I stay stripped, embedded with thug prime
In the hustle of life
I'm sick, he's coming ...
And that's a bit ...
...
Do you know hustlin, that's how I roll
...
Easy go, but lay back, it's always my booze
That's pretty girls treat him bad
...
The hot girls want to be not you
And they don't care what you goin' through
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
It ain't safe, evil's always by my side
