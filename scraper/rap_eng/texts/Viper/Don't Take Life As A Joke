[Chorus: Sung harmoniously.]

(      Ballin'      )                (  Ballin for sho....   )
(      Mallin'      )               ( You can get smoked... )
(    Neva fallin'   )            (    Taking life...     )
( Straight crawlin' )        (    As a joke ......   )

[ Repeat ]


I'm on a level neva felt
Peep, the cards, that I've, been dealt
But every way felt, my rise is fine
The realest G, in this cash-climb
You might see me ridin' by clean
As I glide in that new thirteen
From these boys, I'm seein frusturation
Mad at the world for they present situation
I'm just a hustla, and a deep blanga
Trickin on these haters cuz they filled with anger
Ever since I got, ot the penitentiary
I had this attitude that, you can't fuck with me
It's like, I got, a chip on my shoulda
Cuz they took some years from me as a balla got older
But I ain't trippin on that no mo
They done let a G loose, now I'm running tha show
You think that you know me but you probably don't
Neva did, and probably won't
Boys motives, are questionable
It's like they all in a hurry, to get bold
Any way I want it, is how my money's spent
Meanwhile, cuties give themselves to me as a present
Boys are fallin off, like a nine to five
Taking a whole life time...
And never realise...



[Chorus]


Their propositions deep, but they're just a player hater
Mad at a G, cuz I'm stackin this payper
I'm locked on dis hustle like a train on rails
And wit dis mission, there's no way I can fail..
..Cuz this is real life
Run up this thug
And you can die
I'm deep in the cut
With so much money in the bank I think it might blow up
Catch me mallin, with somethin new
Or on that whole court, dunkin on dudes
But wherever I'm at, you know I'm with some bads
Keepin models so cold, boys wanna blast
The only thing on this earth, that's as real as me mane
Is my numba 1 rank, piece and chain
My infamy got these boys goin insane
It's like they can't figure me out, got em wreckin they brains


[Chorus]
