[Chorus]
Boys want my life
And I ain't trippin
Already ready
Always willin'
If the hollows fly
I'll be chillin
Forever blood even if mine spillin'
Boys want my life
And I ain't trippin
Already ready
Always willin'
If the hollows fly
I'll be chillin
Forever blood even if mine spillin'

[Verse 1]
My cash game is endless
I only chill with girls not dudes so I'm friendless
My green game is incalculable
Daily I can't add it up, my time is too valuable
I mash on these boys, with merciless precision
They don't stand a chance, it's shown by their mannerisms
I dominate competition from the start
They see total annihilation because they got no art
To these dudes I ain't polite
Let these bustas see, that this is real life
My stangs are so unique
They got all the ladies lovin' my techniques
Forever blood 5-9 Piru
Cocaine empire highway clique
What they gon' do
Nothin
But watch me ball
And plot on my life as my new ride crawl

[Chorus]
Boys want my life
And I ain't trippin
Already ready
Always willin'
If the hollows fly
I'll be chillin
Forever blood even if mine spillin'
Boys want my life
And I ain't trippin
Already ready
Always willin'
If the hollows fly
I'll be chillin
Forever blood even if mine spillin'

[Verse 2]
Competition is becoming an endangered species
Boys don't want none of me
Cutie pies say my shine grind is so impressive
That's why with me all the girls are so protective
I'm making sure these dudes have a bad temper
I keep em on they feelings as they minds I enter
I'm not letting boys be cool I'm keepin' em mean
That helps em understand why they're fallin' off the scene
My cash stack is so high and increasin' steady
It's got me chillin' and relaxin' as i get more fetti
To these fellas, I'm causin' harm
I'm the coolest in the world like when I was in prison forms
The gorgeous girls, hearts I prevail
And with, only me they bail
They know the realest nigga when they see it
It's me
And you can't be it

[Chorus]
Boys want my life
And I ain't trippin
Already ready
Always willin'
If the hollows fly
I'll be chillin
Forever blood even if mine spillin'
Boys want my life
And I ain't trippin
Already ready
Always willin'
If the hollows fly
I'll be chillin
Forever blood even if mine spillin'
