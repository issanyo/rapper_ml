[Chorus]
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride

[Verse 1]
Motherfucker, thought your sawed-off would split me
But I was ready when you tried to come and get me
It was real though, you gave it a try
But I saw your bitch ass out the corner of my eye
I saw you comin' fast, in the black cap
Nigga, 'cause I heard that
You wanted to smoke, because your ego got sexy
When you heard I called you, I'm walkin' around
I got your willy
But that shit just small
You goin' down on your mom like a whore
But what you ain't know, I was ready for what was next
When you spin, 'round the corner
You ain't know I already had everything set up on ya
My nigga, I'll box you in, and put that bag over your head
So you don't know what's happening

[Chorus]
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride
You gon' die

[Verse 2]
Now I got yo' bitch ass in my penthouse
With that bag over your head, now what you talkin' 'bout?
Straight beatin' that ass, makin' sure that you know, I'm about to blast
You gon' die, in layman's terms
You willy killer, and get yourself burnt
But don't worry, it won't be much more pain
'Cause I'm about to put this bullet, inside your brain
Now tell me, how does it feel, to know that you's about to get killed
And to know, that you made a fatal choice
To test the G, that keeps the most
So die bumhole , and say your last words
'Cause this gon' be the last shit that you ever heard
Now weep, this was your life
Watch this shit blast, in front of your eyes

[Chorus]
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride
You gon' die
