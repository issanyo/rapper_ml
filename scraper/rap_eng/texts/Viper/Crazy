[Chorus]
Money game crazy
My crib game crazy
My model game crazy
Got me feelin’ crazy
My car game crazy
My family kinda crazy
My team stay crazy
Everythang’s crazy
Money game crazy
My crib game crazy
My model game crazy
Got me feelin’ crazy
My car game crazy
My family kinda crazy
My team stay crazy
Everythang’s crazy

[Verse 1]
I got so much money, some I don’t know what to do with
He’s got hatas so aggravated that they want my wig split
My cash game crazy and my street cred insane
The whole hood screamin’, I’m the realest shina of tha game
Word around the town I got the coldest piece on the globe
My medallion so fly rappers back to wearin’ white gold
Rivals wanna get like me, but they only perpetrate
Cash so heavy on me feel like I got on ankle weights
My bread stackin’ up, like a sky scraper
Fuck the police, they worse than the haters
I’m ‘bout to feel a million (?) nothin’
While you at your job, just think of me stuntin’
Ridin’ in somethin’ new, sittin’ next to somethin’ bad
Headin’ to a spot that’s new, where that bad thing gon’ make me glad
While I keep these snitches sad
My money so sick, I think it’s goin’ mad

[Chorus]
Money game crazy
My crib game crazy
My model game crazy
Got me feelin’ crazy
My car game crazy
My family kinda crazy
My team stay crazy
Everythang’s crazy
Money game crazy
My crib game crazy
My model game crazy
Got me feelin’ crazy
My car game crazy
My family kinda crazy
My team stay crazy
Everythang’s crazy

[Verse 2]
My whip game crazy, my cash game foolish
I go so much money it’ll make a hata lose it
Money pourin’ out tha sky, somethin’ equal to a dream
Bad gals choosin’ up like I won the lotto
But it’s self-earned from my swag models
If you wanna get rich, lemme tell you how it’s done
You make more money, the more times you stunt
Wealth is a patience game, when it hit make sure you’re ready
Play the hand you’re given and hold your royal flushes steady
Another tip to know to get this type of fetti
Is: Except for mine, most people’s advice is petty
Whoever want it gon’ get they 15 minutes
The question to ask is: How are you gon’ spend it?
I chose to use mine, showin’ out
Coz’ that’s what this hustle’s all about

[Chorus]
Money game crazy
My crib game crazy
My model game crazy
Got me feelin’ crazy
My car game crazy
My family kinda crazy
My team stay crazy
Everythang’s crazy
Money game crazy
My crib game crazy
My model game crazy
Got me feelin’ crazy
My car game crazy
My family kinda crazy
My team stay crazy
Everythang’s crazy

(Crazyyy)
