[Hook]
Needing you
Missing you
Wishing you
Were here
Right now

[Hook]
I'm needing you
Missing you
Wishing you
Were here right now

[Verse 1]
I daydream wishing you would let me come back
But you ain't feeling me so I'm dealing with that
It's wild too, the way I feel
I'm on probation though I wish I could blow kill
But it's chill cuz I'm thinking of you
And I know you'll forever remember me too
Now I'm just thug ballin'
Caught in the loop, and I'm seen ballin'
Gangsta Hustling
A ballers mission
Destroying, mashing, and crushing competition
Thinking about how we used to grind
You in my arms as I smile one time
Like damn, that's my girl
The one and only piece of my world
The one that was meant for me
The only girl to catch the ellipticity

[Hook]
I'm needing you
Missing you
Wishing you
Were here right now

[Verse 2]
Last night I had a good dream about you
Me and you making love
Do what I do
And I wish we would do it again
I'd give it all up to be your best friend
I'm being real, I changed my ways
Even though you don't believe me and you think it's game
But one day, you gon' see
Cuz you gon' come through with opportunity
And I'm gon' snatch it by the horns
And be the realest to you that was ever born
And show you how I'm gonna treat you forever
Nothing but happiness though all kinds of weather
You and I
Holding hands
Going to the top level of a woman and man
Eternally blessed by the folks above
Us lying higher than the eagles in love

[Hook]
I'm needing you
Missing you
Wishing you
Were here right now
