(Chorus)
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel

(Verse 1)
Yeah, lets pop it off
I'm ready for you bustas to see my (?)
Ready, at all costs
I gotta let you know I ain't taking a loss
Three shots and a nigga gets tossed
Then I ball and floss
Haters meet me at, see what a ballers all about
I'm grinding for sure, getting paychecks and letting bustas know
These boys phony
Plus i'm only one of the illest niggas in my hood
And imma let these boys know its all good
You boys will recognize, that i'm ready for my steel to chastise

(Chorus)
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel

(Verse 2)
I don't trust mad niggas
Run your ass up to keep the shells, skilla
Cause I don't really care, who you be
And to tell you the truth punk, you don't know me
But if you wanna know, it's that gangster out your best side
Ready to get niggas in on that drive by
And it just don't stop
(?) in this world non-stop
I know these boys are plotting
But mane i'm on them and I won't be forgotten
It's the one you never seen before hoppin'
Prepare to loose when ya'll bitch niggas riding
(?) (?) (?) if I got to hang em'
Waiting to see if I have to bang em'
Fuck you bustas, cause I don't trust ya!

(Chorus)
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
What's the deal?
I stay chill, but stay ready to get ill
Plus here's something you can feel
