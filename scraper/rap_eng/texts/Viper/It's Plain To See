[Hook: Viper & Jdejinae]
It's plain to see (it's plain)
My love's for thugs (to see)
Never to hate (my [?])
'cause ballers keep it crunk, as I ([?])
Tussle my struggle
Born to maintain
Hop in the game (anymore got my)
I let my mind be tamed ([?], what's up?)
It's plain to see (it's plain)
My love's for thugs (to see)
Never to hate (my [?])
'cause ballers keep it crunk, as I ([?])
Tussle my struggle
Born to maintain
Hop in the game (anymore got my)
I let my mind be tamed ([?], what's up?)

[Verse 1: Viper]
I flip through rollin', while my bass is hittin'
'Woofer's kickin', it's time to be rippin'
I gots to show love to them thugs, in the back and the front
We keepin' it real, and that is what's up
Thug is a definition, that I've got in my mind
Girls and boys, pumpin' rap all the time
I see playa's drinkin', G star flossin'
Back of the club, mugs keep hoppin'
So trill, keepin the baller crunk
As a playa' throws a deuce up
Like literature, you know the picture
Everybody in the house, I wanna see you witcha
Hands in the air, on the deuce bases
Many different people, and many different places
Many different faces, ridin' through the roll
Playa' throw it up, as we kick it with soul

[Verse 2: Viper]
So I'm throwin' up the deuce
All my ladies out there I wanna see you groove
Opportunities get scoped
An MC, host with the most
Where my thugs at? A player like me
You might see parlayin' in the place to be
As I fall through the mall, you know I'm gon' call
Hittin' my cell, give me a call
Let's holla 'bout this major paper chase that we're tryin'
Thugs never cryin', ocean front glidin'
When it comes to this thug life, where I'm sittin'
I'm the type of G who's gonna keep on livin'
Give in to the sea of m m m u n i t y
Tell me, can you feel me as my lyrics travel through the sky?
I'ma keep on going on going till the day that I dizz-ie
And lay it down in the ground and ride
