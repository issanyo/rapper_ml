[Hook]
Roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll

[Verse 1]
I'm down, we stacking licks
And making cash as the clock ticks
I sleep to my track
I'm making a loop whenever getting it made
Haters get played like a fiddle
For thinking they can catch me in the middle
Of my stacking
But that's when the haters start laughing
I'm fine and tutored, my papermakin' game
And if you was' wise you would do the same
My rise to the top is low and steady
And my patience will make me ready
So I'm getting expended
And my mind won't let me
Need a to make it or money's lost
My ego is too much to swallow

[Hook]
So I roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll

[Verse 2]
Balling, hustling, doing what I gotta do
Stacking, winning, and making plenty cash too
Tuning, bumping, thumping in my tight car
Stacking, packing, my heat is up to par
I'm on the west of the world, and west of the states
South-east all it takes, south-west to the H
I don't care if you know my location
You will get smoked if you start baller-hation'
I'm Inning these green ones
My boys' foes look scared to go get some
While I'm lookin like it's whatever
My boy ain't doin' nothing so he stayin clever
Will I ever fall? Never
Made it to leave your lift away in your lever
From my gank you'll be severed
And I'll roll like on a drop of a feather

[Hook]
I roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll
I roll on a gangsta's stroll
