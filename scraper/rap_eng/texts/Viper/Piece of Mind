[Verse 1]
Enemy's challenge is a mistake
I'm dustin' off haters with a Shake 'n Bake
In the Fight Club, lose, but still try to salvage
Whatever they did, but they can't manage
Because I'm too talented, lively and energetic
They hate my swag - my cash, they detest it
Anti-supporters are incapable
Of stopping this, as I'm makin' the
Competition, concede to me
[?]
I make all this money 'cause I'm a G
These snitches can't figure out my salary
Or who I be, 'cause I'm so real
I work several times a day, I collect the mail
I'm also known as The Paper Man
I got mail, cash and checks in my hand

[Verse 2]
My grind is enhanced
By my shine
It puts cuties in a trance
All the bad girls, I own
They have a second life in my home
Meanwhile, what's enemy's logic?
They don't wanna battle, but yet they wanna stop this
So why do they maintain resistance
They punishment increase 'cause they stay persistent
[?]
Never again will they test the cash I make
