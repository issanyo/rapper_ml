[Hook]

Now I'm out here tryna bang bang
I won't stop 'till Viper is a household name
So they can gold name brand me
The realest of the grind, can you stand me?
I'm tryna hit it , a major win
With checks going out, and mo' pourin' in
And I'ma do this 'till they brand me
So tell me will they stand me

[Verse 1]

I don't pay dues fall night time
It's been a hype minute, I been hustlin for miles
Sittin on the bench from comfortable to pain
Waitin for fate to push a malla over the game
It's like I see the prize in the distance
So my grind ain't allowin nothing but persistance
I still ball late, don't get it twisted
? have my people say they miss this
They say ? I'm the realest
?
Imagine these haters ?
They say ? I'm the realest
My swag ?

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tryna bang bang
I won't stop 'till Viper is a household name
So they can gold name brand me
The realest of the grind, can you stand me?
I'm tryna hit it , a major win
With [?] , and mo' pourin' in
And I'ma do this 'till they brand me
So tell me will they stand me


[Verse 2]
Goal after goal I'm gettin mo paper
Stain after stain, I'm gettin mo haters
