I ain't trippin' on you chumps
I don't care, if you ever buy my stuff
[x4]

You'll haters got me hyper
You'll heard all my CDs on CDBaby dot com, backslash viper
Matta fact ten thousand of you'll heard my album
It's only a hunnid of you'll bought em..
So that's 9900 haters on the wall
So to you, I say, f*** you'll
Cuz while you'll rockin rhyme cash like some tricks
I'm still paid, in real estate b****
And that's cash you can't stop
No matter how much you hate, your mouth drops
On me, when they see the SUV
And leave, with my cap back clowning
It makes they eyes hurt
Peepin' out a thug on your way back to work
While a n**** cross the street, on hate block
On his way to punch, they clock
See I'd be mad too
If God made me you

I ain't trippin' on you chumps
I don't care, if you ever buy my stuff
[x2]

See you boys makin' money by some a**
But the girls I got, they done make me cash
See you punks don't understand what I'm stressin'
So now it's time, for a lesson
I got seven companies for clientele
And seven secretaries, that greet me well
Two black, two lat, two asian, one white
You know what's a trip? Is they all fine
And they'all mine, makin' my loot climb
And when you homos try to holla, you get denied
They answer my lines, sayin' my business names
Openin' me a quick, route to fame
So I'm paid, anyways, so I don't care if you baller hate
Then, my stuff online showin' up great
And there's a space to send an email after you listen and hate

I ain't trippin' on you chumps
I don't care, if you ever buy my stuff
