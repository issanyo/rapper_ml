[Hook]
I know (Could it be my ride?)
The real (Could it be my shine?)
Why do these boys (Could it be my cash?)
Want to kill me (No, it's all because of my...)
I know (Could it be my crib?)
The real (Or the way I live?)
Why do these boys (Could it be my dome?)
Want to kill me (Or why the girls can't leave me alone?)

[Verse 1]
On the real, all I do is chill
My boys walk around, with anger concealed
Truth is revealed, I ball
Cake, jewelery, cars, dude I got it all
I stand tall, as I walk
Diamonds on my neck, got boys on no talk
I'm loving the way I'm making this cake
All the cash I'm seeing from the decisions I make
I done set myself up for continual cash
G's up, marks down as I hide my stash
Keeping dude on retreat, that's how I'm doing them
They can't get away, bankruptcy's pursuing them
Every plan they done had to come up in this game, I done trashed
These haters, I done locked out this game that I only rock
In this hustle of infamy, I'm that top-choice G
The one they can't fade, the one that's got it made

[Hook]
I know, the real
Why do these boys want me killed?
I know, the real
Why do these boys want me killed?

[Verse 2]
In this infamy game
I made more money while punks know your name
I'm infamy-blessed
That's something you don't want to test
In this league I'm in
I made it so only I can win
Misperceptions or bent reality
Cause they think they gon' see some cheese
Cause I always change it up with something new
A new style that can't lose
Then these pussy niggas try to steal my swag
So I switch it up again on their ass
You can call me All Autotune
Computer Viper, that's what it do
So you cats better start playing the lotto
That's the only way that y'all coming up, bro

[Hook]
Could it be my ride?
Could it be my shine?
Could it be my cash?
No, it's all because of my...
Could it be my crib?
Or the way I live?
Could it be my dome?
Or why the girls can't leave me alone?
I know, the real
Why do these boys want me killed?
I know (Could it be my crib?)
The real (Or the way I live?)
Why do these boys (Could it be my dome?)
Want to kill me (Or why the girls can't leave me alone?)
