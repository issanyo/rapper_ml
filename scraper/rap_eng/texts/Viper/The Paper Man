[Hook: Viper]
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling

[Verse 1: Viper]
It's a trip
The life of a superstar
The way I roll is like an armored car
Im ridin', with checks and loot
My money growin', like a tree root
I put some in the bank, and I keep some with me
And ride solo, so you can't get me
For my dividends
I'm amazed how this money comin' in
I don't even trip about how much to spend
And how much to lend
Cause I got plenty
And now these folks feel me
I just chill out watchin' all my diamonds shine
And it's gravy cause it's all mine
I done hit a level where the money won't cease
And its got me to where I'm wantin' peace

[Hook: Viper]
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling

[Verse 2: Viper]
This green where I'm keeping some
And it gives me so much freedom
To do what I please
Like ride with 50s
Hundreds of Gs
Now I'm on my lane
My banks pay me out
I'm keepin' paper just like a mail ride
This lifestyle done put me in high demand
Folks call me Viper, aka the Paypa Man
Somethin' bout the cash made the G wanna try it
And now that I'm payed, everything done got quiet
I gotta spend it
No longer am I waiting for it
Looks like everything slowed down so I'll enjoy it
Money hoppin' in my account like a rabbit
I don't care about the past now's the time to have it
All these
And you know whats tighter I got the money for it mane

If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
Cashing checks
And paper hauling
If you're looking for me I'll be ballin'
