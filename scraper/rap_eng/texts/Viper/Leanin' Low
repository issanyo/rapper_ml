I see you gone
And ballin' on
Leanin' low
G'd up fosho

I see you gone
And ballin' on
Leanin' low
G'd up fosho

You died, but your memories I keep
Like how we used to battle rap on my back street
It was amazing, your freestyle was the best
You said shit that put other rapper's careers to rest
But last time I saw you was outside of the club
You lost the ring you was givin' to yo girl agged as fuck
And if I knew I wouldn't see you no more I wouldn't believe it
That this would be the last time that I would see you breathin'
We was on the same team, assemblin' cars
To come up in the rap game, ball and floss
It was some fraud shit, you died too soon
Now I roll around, aggravated, starin' at the moon
Contemplatin' all the good times that we had, and if roles were reversed, I know you'd be sad
But I ain't even trippin, I'm gon see you again
And when I do, you gon have a platinum mic in your hand

I see you gone
And ballin' on
Leanin' low
G'd up fosho

I see you gone
And ballin' on
Leanin' low
G'd up fosho

I remember when I heard the news
I was rollin' down the freeway bangin' screw
They said it on the ray-dee-oh
I was mad then a mug, but all I could do was say no
I pulled over to the liquor store bought a fifth of hen
And poured til it was a fo

Now I roll, still trippin' at the world, wonderin' why it had to go past the twirl
Your flow was the best, I mean number one
A homie I could talk to in this game of guns
And will I ever have another? Hell naw
'cause you was like my big brother, that showed me how to flow
And now I know
I wish you didn't go
But when the tunnel's end is light again
And when it's said and done
I'm gon be rappin' with my friend

I see you gone
And ballin' on
Leanin' low
G'd up fosho

I see you gone
And ballin' on
Leanin' low
G'd up fosho
