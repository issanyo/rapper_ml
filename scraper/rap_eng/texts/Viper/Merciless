[Verse 1]
I'm waiting for the day I can take a nigga life
And when I do, I promise I'll think twice
Bitch-ass niggas, I let 'em know from the jump
Run your ass up and you're gonna see the pump
And I keep with me the slugs
Ready to pop one of these punks in the mud
I'm watching them like an eagle watches prey
Waiting to catch the first jump and say
Something, out the norm
It's pre-meditated, man mark getting warm
I roll the swarm on these boys
And let my toys make some noise
Like the poor folk own a Glock
To put these boys down on the block
I cock my hammer in position
And leave your family tears in fruition

[Verse 2]
Motherfuckers die like it ain't shit
If I pop in the seventeen-round clip
It's the truth how these boys will fall over
And if they ain't old, I told ya
Gunshots will ring out
While tricks run north and south
But you can't run and you can't hide
When I got you in my mind for a homicide
If I gotta go to war, I'm prepared
No hunches, I don't care
'Cause if they want to go there, I swear
Your life won't be spared
I show these tricks how I do
I leave 'em without a clue
Wondering who
Left me on the ground by your .22s?
