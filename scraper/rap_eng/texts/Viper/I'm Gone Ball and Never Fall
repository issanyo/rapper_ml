(Hook)
Ahhh, gone bling
I'm gone ball, ahhh, gone stang
And never fall

(Verse)
It's the baller rollin' out the hood
That boys wishin' that they could
Be like me, ballin' bling in the clean SUV
And I still keep my pistol, just so these boys know what's crystal clear
What I'm sayin', you'll be smokin' before you realize I wouldn't playin'
I'm just an envied hitter, I'm ridin' diamonds and glitter
In the day time or the night, sittin' white girl is gonna guarantee to invite
Your mind to Wonderland, what your life gone be like if you were someone else
Get me off the chain, I'm tellin' you, man

(Hook x1)

(Verse 2)
I'm stingin' places when nobody ever knew and is forced the hatred, I'm used to it
I wanna hail light, make them take your girl, cause they see from what a guy going in my world
Steady wonderin' what I'm doin', but they see look what you ruin
From that whole shit, you'll pursuing chitter chatter
I'll get you a ??? bruisin'
I'm cruisin', it's all them gotta see
And they wanna smoke weed cause they stangin' licks
Before we shine, blockers, ain't we intimidating
Cause from these hot waters, we should be in for trail
Done walkin' by it, like ???
He thinks it high, when it exclosure
And we'll see if you still ball the hate when you lose some blood at a fast rate

(Hook x2)
