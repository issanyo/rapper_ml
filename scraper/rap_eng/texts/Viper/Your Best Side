I THINK ABOUT YOU WHEN I SLEEP
I THINK ABOUT YOU WHEN IM UP
I THINK ABOUT YOU WHEN IM DOWN
I THINK ABOUT YOU WHEN I CUM
I THINK ABOUT YO ASS A LOT
I KNOW SOMETIMES WE DONT SEE EYE TO EYE
I KNOW THATS NOT YOUR FAULT
SOMETIMES I THINK I KNOW TOO MUCH, I DONT
I KNOW I HAVE THAT PROBLEM
YOU KNOW I KEEP MY FEELINGS BOTTLED UP
I KNOW I SHOULD BE TALKIN
I LET MYSELF GET ANGRY AND ABRUPT
I LET MYSELF GET ROTTEN
I THINK I JUST ACCEPTED GIVING UP
I JUST BECAME MY PROBLEM
I SHOULD’VE BEEN MORE STRONG THROUGHOUT THE STRUGGLE
I SHOULD’VE BEEN MORE HONEST
LATELY IVE BEEN SUFFERING IN THIS FUNK, I JUST FELL DOWN LIKE AUTUMN
EVERY TIME I TRY I CANT GET UP
IM STUCK RIGHT WHERE IVE FALLEN
EVERY TIME I CRY I CANT GET UP
FEEL SO FAR AT THE BOTTOM
I JUST WANT YOU NOW MORE THAN MYSELF
I JUST WANT BACK MY LOSSES
DONT THINK I DESERVE ANOTHER CHANCE
I THINK I GET WHATS GOTTEN
MAYBE YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY OF ME
I HOPE YOU HEAR ME CALLING
I KNOW IT HURTS YOUR HEART TO SEE ME CRAWL
I HURT YOU WAY TOO OFTEN
EVERY TIME I DO I HURT MYSELF
AND IT MAKES ME FEEL AWFUL
EVERY TIME I DONT EXERT MYSELF
I SEE WHERE I WENT WRONGLY
EVERYTHING I DO I SEE YOU NOW
AND YOU NOT THERE AROUND ME
EVERYTHING IVE MISSED THAT MADE YOU SMILE
ITS THOSE THOUGHTS THAT SURROUND ME LATE AT NIGHT AND SCREAM AT ME SO LOUD
I CANT ESCAPE THEM CALMLY
CLOUDING UP MY JUDGEMENT IN THE CROWD
OF ALL MISTAKES I FOUND
ALLOW ME TO MISJUDGE YOU AND GET LOUD
LEAVE ME WHERE YOU FOUND ME
FOR BOUNTY
