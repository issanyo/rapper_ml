I'm gone sting
And bling in this thing
I'm gone sting
And bling in this thing
I'm gone sting
And bling in this thing
I'm gone sting
And bling in this thing

[Verse 1]
I'm coming up large
And so recognize I’m the nigga in charge
I chill all the time
This cash is amazing (easy)
I need to recline
I roll through places
Sit and relax
Parlay
And kick back
This lifestyle done got me complacent
It’s like I’m living one big vacation
As the clock spins around
I hardly look at it, that’s how I clown
As I sting on this cash mission
Watching boys fall off for making bad decisions
And ending up in life collisions
The final result? A wig splitin'
While I’m steady shinin'
Livin’ it up and unwindin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's gravy...
I always ball and now these boys sayin “maybe
One day I will shine like that”
And you will, as long as you don’t keep...
Actin'... like a mark
Unlike these haters who I knew from the start
Couldn’t fade me
And can’t persuade me
Into thinking that
That was cool
And thinking that they could’ve fought me too
But I’m wise, and I stay alert
For all these punks, that wanna put me in the dirt
I work, and grind on the slip
To maintain the cash so i can live (last) long
In the game
And ball while these boys scared of fame

[Hook]
