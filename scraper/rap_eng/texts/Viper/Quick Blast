Bitch niggas in the place
Gettin' hit in the face by a
(Quick Blast)
Takin' life as a joke
Boys gettin' smoked by a
(Quick Blast)
Shit you never saw
Punks slapped in the jaw by
(One real quick blast)

Verse 1

Not a picture, but still a dome shot
Punk motherfuckers rest well from the Glock
Thugged out hustler catching boys one time
Hard lessons learned that I'm stuck on grind
Slappin' boys cross the head with a pistol
??? and now it's crystal
Puttin' these marks in check
Got em more broke up than a corvette(?)
I'm like an assassin
Only difference is I ain't hidin' when I'm blastin'
I'm on a gangster stroll
Boys hiding in their cribs
Scared to roll
Gunshots got em duckin' all behind couches
Make em take off their tanktops
And put on some blouses
Can't get away
Might as well get around
Cause' I'm the wolf with a pump
Bout' to blow the house down

Verse 2

Niggas goin' broke so they losin' they minds
Making bad decisions
And losin' they lives
Choosin bad licks like
Comin' round here and getting they wig split
Life is a game boy
Steady ?? while I'm winning my ??
It takes a lot
To make them comprehend
But a Glock cross the forehead
Will make a nigga bend
Blood drippin' down
Everywhere from they mug
Heads tilt back
Big hole from the slug
Eyes wide open
Froze, starin' in space
Nigga bit the bullet
But he ain't like the taste
I'm tryna help a hater find
Peace of mind
From the hollows comin' out my nine
Cause' niggas scared to open they mouth
When they look to both sides
And see they boys took out
