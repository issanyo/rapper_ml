[Hook]
I gots to ball
I can not fall
I gots to ball
I can't fall

[Verse 1]
I'm gon' keep winning for real
I'm loving this like my drop Lac on twenty inch wheels
Just hopped off the new Lex on things
My Lamborghini doors open like chicken wings
But I never touch the steering wheel of my Bentley
'Cause when I ride that, my chauffeurette come get me
In my house I got thirteen maids
Seven from the motherland and six from Spain
These ladies straight take care of they thug
Massages, bath sex, showers and back rubs
What... can a baller say?
Sometimes I just chill and don't leave for days
Gettin' freaked while watchin' my ninety inch flatscreen
Ring a bell for ten more girls, are checkin' to see
If they G need huggin'
Warm touching, or old fashion fuckin'

[Hook]
I gots to ball
I can not fall
I gots to ball
I can't fall

[Verse 2]
My Maserati go hard
Indoor and outdoor court in my backyard
Every race, of female I'm housin'
My pool big enough to fit one thousand
So why did I get that Navi?
So I can freak it out, like my Escalade caddy
And that there bump...
Put the box in the back and let it thump 'ot the trunk
Appetizer puts me in an eatin' mood
My cook peepin me 'ot, as she makes my food
But this time I don't like the meal
She come to kiss me and say she love me still
How many cars does one G need?
I don't know and I don't care 'cause I got the green
Security cameras on my house, no burglar bars
'Cause I keep more heat than a day on Mars

I gots to ball
I can not fall
I gots to ball
I can't fall
