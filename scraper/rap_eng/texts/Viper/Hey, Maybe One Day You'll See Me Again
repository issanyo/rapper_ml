[Hook]
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me

[Verse 1]
I won't forget about us
I was a full time thug
But every day
You gone through my mug
There's something about you I can't shake
All the years you've known me all the troubles we've made
I still call you every day and send a text at night
One day we'll hook up again, and everything gone be tight
See these boys like jealous' cause the cash I stack
They want me gone from you forever, and sleeping on my back
But that ain't gon' happen
We gone both keep getting paid and I'm gone keep rapping
We'dve finally made it
And we can't be faded
Life is great, and I'll be thinking of you
And all the things we used to do
Like always holding hands when we roll in my cars
And going camping, looking up at the stars

[Hook]
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me

[Verse 2]
At first, things ain't go as planned
But you kept it real with me
And one day I can, I'll be your man
And make all your dreams come true
Remember, I was always proud of you
I know sometimes I can't carry myself the way I should act
But I was born a thug, and that's just that
But every day, I'm a better man
And for our future, I got a nice plan
You and me forever, no more I'll be stunting
Our pockets very cool and in that RV you want
I'll take you round on trips, across the world
I won't break your heart, you're my only girl
I'm gon' make your life so perfect
So you can tell your friends, show out and splurge it
So when you say your prayers at night
Remember me, I got your back for life

[Hook]
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me

[Outro]
Yeah
