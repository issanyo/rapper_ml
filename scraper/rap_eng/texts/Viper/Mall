Yeah yeah yeeuuuhh
Here's a little something for them thugs
And them ballers


[[Chorus]]
Now they know, who the best
It's that G, out S-West
I know you, don't want flex
It's best to chill and stay blessed

Now they know, who the best
It's that G, out S-West
I know you, don't want flex
It's best to chill and stay blessed



I'm gone ball, I'm gone grind
I'm gone sting, I'm gone shine
I'ma fool, I'm gone hoop
Catch two hand hanger alley oop
You know how high, you can go
My game fast, your game slow
You's a hoe, I got the word
You get agged, before snowbirds
But I don't give a fuck
You gone see a snowbird dunk
But don't worry bout my game
Bitch just play, your own mane
But if you, wanna flex
Cause my hops, cause havoc
Yeah I know you with your boys
I'ma let my toys make noise
If it was just one on one
Then I wouldn't need by gun
But y'all bitches gotta jump
So I'm ready, to get crunk
You keep on, sayin' leave
Cause you can't, jump like me
On straight defense cause y'all ain't bangers
Just fuck defense I'm gettin' hangers


[[Chorus]]



I'm gone ball, by the mall
All this cash, I can't fall
I fall through, any store
And buy things, you don't know
Never buy or ever seen
Especially when it's my jewelry
W - H - I - T - E
Diamonds on me, Bezatine
Back, up to tennis shoes
When I buy em it's times two
One pair for hoop, and outdoors
One pair for indo wooden floors
Cashing in with different goodies
Next on store, buyin' hoodies
Stars peep me as I glance
As I buy, my sweatpants
Money rolled, super fat
Cause they were so tightly packed
Hunnids fifties twennies tens
Four more days we win again
But, be-fore I bail
It's hoop clothes time, for my mail
In there it's a different story
Just bought all they inventory



[[Chorus]]
