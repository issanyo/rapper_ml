I'm lookin out for these ridas...
Ready to blast on these ridas..
I got my eye on these ridas...
Waitin to mash on these ridas

Here mane, I'm watchin these bustas
Got no love for the faggots and I sure don't trust em
This nigga ride '07 like me
Somethin ain't right, hustlin too closely
Must be a football player or somethin
And I don't give a fuck, I hope he start frontin
I hope he keeps swinging big body fast
So I can let this 4-4 blast
Just scared so what you can't run
Come get in this mix cuz im waitin to bust
Scary motherfucker, if you enter
It's gone be lead, and not a splinter
West coast big thug, and
Your wasting your future giving your click a new task
So come and getcha car, and your body off the highway
Anotha episode of pistol play

[Chorus]

Oh you hoop for the rockets??
I can hoop too watch as I cop this
From my bag, hold my gat, cuz u eyein like a bitch
Although you hating you gone have a rigamortus twitch
A bitch nigga,  he goes
Now watch em book it, as I'm catchin boys in the dome
I got these boys, afraid to go
And every time I'm lookin for em they looking down my dome
These tricks wastin my time
They won't step up much less cross the line
I ain't trippin on your diamonds mine much bigger
And to top it off you a mark hatin a** n****
In your '06 Yukon
You bought yours for business I got mine for fun
Last thing I don't care if you're 16 or sixty
I leave you dead in my Bentley

[Chorus]
