[Hook]
I'm all about my tussle
Brown-black cats know I'm all about my hustle
I'm all about my struggle
The gold age know I'm all about my hustle
I'm all about my tussle
Real made G's know I'm all about my hustle
I'm all about my struggle
Real made G's know I'm all about my hustle

[Verse]
Catch me in another state
Moving big weight
Making top cash while these marks wait
Wonderin' why y'all fake
It don't make sense
It don't matter, I'm the realest thing that there ever did
All these haters jealous 'cause they envy my swagger
Hit you with the heat and make your ass fall backwards
Fuck what they sayin', my clique is the shit
I'm the realest in the grind and these bustas feel it
When I step up to a killer
I decapitate a snitch and then go dealer
Bad bitches with my little nigga
Can drop one of you bustas like the flour in the miller
I heard your clique finished last
Word in the hood, y'all ain't makin' no cash
While I'm out here, movin' this cocaine
Makin' so much, they has you marks goin' insane
I done made it my mission
To treat these haters like competition
It's got me wonderin' will they ever get they money right?
It's got me happy that they'll never join this lavish life
