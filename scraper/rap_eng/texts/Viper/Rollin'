[Verse 1: Pacardi-Proof]
Invisible scars, and futuristic cars
We put them down, under [?] stars, ain't tryna' see no wars
I went through [?], and it's steadily flowin'
Like we the Houston [?], but [?]
The whole 9 yards, pay to be on the boulevard
If you a [?] you lose your whole-court for livin' fraud
I done witnessed a whole lotta bullshit
Niggas tryna come up with, really wanna be the shit
But you're never legit, or never a real
You're just a kid, [?] bitch past niggas deal
A raw deal, [?], I'm a fucking menace
We're [?] mixed with Guinness, Guinness
I'm in control, but need a [?], gave their soul
Look me in my eye, and tell me what ya'll see
A real fuckin' G, breakin' 'em off in this industry
Like it was meant to be (be, be)

[Verse 2: Viper The Rapper]
[?] big body
Everybody pimpin', and it's like a party hardy
We gonna knock it up, we gon' do what we gots to do
Them boys are G's as they steppin' on the blues

[Verse 3:  Pacardi-Proof]
Reppin' and ballin' while they goons be fallin'
[?] is crawlin, while they hoes be hatin'
I'm associating with the real niggas on the [?]
We gonna come up, blow up, in H Town
I got the cups, so fool won't you fill it up
I got the cigar, so bitch won't you roll it up?
As we peel out the lane, going state to state
Hurtin' motherfuckers, H Town [?]
I got the [?], and that boys name [?]
When we fill in the [?], we can never stop
It's that [?] proof, comin' out the roof
I'm [?], while my pants is saggin'
Not givin' a fuck fool, I'm just braggin'
Hold my damn self, and the hoes fuckin' jigglin'
The whole motherfuckin' world knows, we da shit
Rollin' and ballin' and it never stops
