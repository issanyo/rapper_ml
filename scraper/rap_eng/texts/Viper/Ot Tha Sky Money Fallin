[Hook]
Let’s get to ballin’
Let’s get to shot callin’
Out the sky the cash fallin’
While these twenty inches crawlin’
Let’s get to ballin’
Let’s get to shot callin’
Out the sky the cash fallin’
While these twenty inches crawlin’

[Verse 1]
I’m the god of making cash
While niggas sayin’ they gon’ take my last
These haters pass more info than a encyclopedia
Gossiping marks, jealous of seein’ the
Cash I make and how I’m livin’ so [fly?]
So with these snitches, I don’t sympathize
[?] chumps off tha muscle
And I changed tha game up
I made it shuffle
New stangs to be hit
Are incoming
And if these fools run up
Then heat will be hummin’
From the [?]
I paid my price for fame
And it ain’t a man alive I let touch my name
They strategy [come?] best moderate
‘cause my destructive offense
Got me living first-rate
I just kick back and parlay
My life is like a bliss
I livin’ every day

[Hook]
Let’s get to mallin’
Let’s get to shot callin’
Out the sky the cash fallin’
While these twenty inches crawlin’
Let’s get to mallin’
Let’s get to shot callin’
Out the sky the cash fallin’
While these twenty inches crawlin’

[Verse 2]
Once again, let me reconfirm
I’m first in the win
And rivals never get a turn
As pretty ladies give me love signals
And these clowns ain’t got a nickel to they name
And that’s why me they loathe
I’m tha sender of tha hate cause my pockets stay swole
I’m mad on these cowards, I don’t treat them fairly
They can’t mall like me and they can barely
Maintain they own life
So they know they can’t handle me in a battle fight
After tha war, I recollect on the bout
And recount the mortal blows that I dished out
Competitors ain’t cool
They can only be enemies ‘cause they hate on you
But I got too much heart
To let these marks
Play a part
In my life

[Hook]
Let’s get to mallin’
Let’s get to shot callin’
Out the sky the cash fallin’
While these twenty inches crawlin’
Let’s get to mallin’
Let’s get to shot callin’
Out the sky the cash fallin’
While these twenty inches crawlin’
