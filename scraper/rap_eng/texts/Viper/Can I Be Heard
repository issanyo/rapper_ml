[Chorus]
Playa can I be heard?
In this game of fame
Doin' big body thangs ballas know my name
Many dos and don'ts, many don'ts and dos
Love to the soldiers singing ghetto blues
Playa can I be heard?
In this game of fame
Doin' big body thangs ballas know my name
Many dos and don'ts, many don'ts and dos
Love to the soldiers singing ghetto blues

[Verse 1: Lucky So Sick]
