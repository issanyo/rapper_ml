[Chorus]
My Swag
Is what I like to feel
I'm tryna give a folk
A brand new deal
And win mo' pay
That's my dream today

[Verse]
My money game stupid cause my dope sale game retarded
Yet I ain't a coward, sell you coke and with you snort it
And I sale them Lorocets
And I sale them Oxycodones
Swear to God you buy my pills, My pills brand new, Ain't nothing sloppy
Molly I sell so killer, have you on your float
Hydro I sell so buyer, have you high in the ozone
And if you ain't know, I sell that mushroom tea
The high kind of like X, and it's gone have you rolling
I sell that meth, and I only charge 80 a gram
And if you money low, I'll give you a free slam
And if you ain't got half I'll do a half or 35
Now tell me what dope dealer you know that that real and life?
Cause I'm the coolest dopeboy you gone ever know
I always cut my prices, if your money low
I ain't tripping on the profits customers come first
With my dope you gone feel like you heaven on earth

[Chorus]
My Swag
Is what I like to feel
I'm tryna give a folk
A brand new deal
And win mo' pay
That's my dream today

My Swag
Is what I like to feel
I'm tryna give a folk
A brand new deal
And win mo' pay
That's my dream today

[Verse 2]
I sell that black tar too, holler if you want some
The streets is saying it, I sell the best heron
I sell lean, and my prices so ripe too
If you no, do 200 for a pint
And I got them X-Os  if you need them
Double stacked, triple stacked, mane I get 'em to ya
And I got them Norcos for sale
I'm doing 3 for 10, who got a price so well?
And if you buy some of my Hydrocodone, I put it on my soul, you'll be wanting so more
If you need powder, to me make 1 call
My connect so cold do 60 for a 8 ball
And now let's speak on my sale, of the yayo
I'm selling 7 20 rocks for 50
Who does that? You don't know
Nobody
And my wholesale 50 packs so fat
You can sell them retail and get 140 back

[Chorus]
My Swag
Is what I like to feel
I'm tryna give a folk
A brand new deal
And win mo' pay
That's my dream today

My Swag

I'm tryna give a folk
A brand new deal
And win mo' pay
That's my dream today
