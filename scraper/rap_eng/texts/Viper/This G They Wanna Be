[Chorus]

This G, they wanna be
It's this G, they wanna be

[Verse 1]

I got this girl game locked
Haters agged 'cause of the stars I bring on the block
Ever seen a redhead on her knees? Double that nigga, and you're talking 'bout lee
Every week I do at least one menage
Two gals on my dick means killa ass foreplay
I remember when I hit my first Indian meat
Smashed that pussy like a dog in a heat
I'm cold when it comes to these hoes
I'm tryna knock that ass off like my rolls on fo's
I never get head for less than an hour
Catch me in the jacuzzi with four dimes in my shower
My homie, 3 captivates the mind
Follow up by the 20s and they hypnotized
Then I reel 'em in with the bling
I'm catchin' more hits than a boxing ring

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

I'ma Viper nigga, I stang hoes and put 'em down
Catch 'em once from the back and they out from they gown
I stack 'em from the front, straight hit 'em with the fangs
Yeah they know what's up, hoppin' on a thug mane
I'm movin' these gals, too advanced ???
I get more call backs than the US stacks office
It's like an addiction these hoes can't shake
Kind of like a crack head fiendin' for cake
These see me rollin', in my 850
All the stars, they wanna come get me
I park my car, and make a phone call
As they tappin' on my windows and want it all
My limo driver answers and she come scoop me up
She comes through grindin' in my black stretch truck
Ever seen a balla sucked in a long whip
Follow up with anotha dime who wants a free trip

[Chorus]
