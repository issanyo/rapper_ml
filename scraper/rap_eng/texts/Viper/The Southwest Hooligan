It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me

[Verse 1]
I show up clean
It's the diamonds that gleam, that lets them know it's me
It's a trip how I stack this paper
The saying true, that it's greater later
Sometimes I chill in the mall all day
While most niggas slang working hard for their pay
Yeah mane, I'm loving this
Cause I got boys looking like they making a wish
But if they react to their feelings, they'll regret it
And get they bitch ass wetted
Shot up, real fast
Cause imma make sure that my licks gone last
And once they gonna fuck that up
That's why I stay ready to bust
My gun is my only friend I trust
That's why it's only me never them and us

[Hook]
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me

[Verse 2]
So I stick to the game plan
Til I (?) these haters and let them know where I stand
Chumps mean mugging, looking like tricks
While i'm balling, buying some kicks
I guess it hurts to see a G's pockets so swole
While their pockets full with lint and holes
But that's how things go
I will always have it and they will never know
What it's like to have a fat bank account
And cash in your crib to go buy another house
I ride in the after noon time
While other punk on they grind
Life styles of the rich and famous
I got it like that, these marks can't claim this
So they rolling around upset
Roll this way, you're smoked bet

It's the Southwest Hooligan

They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
It's the Southwest Hooligan
They know who it be
And you know what
They can't play me
