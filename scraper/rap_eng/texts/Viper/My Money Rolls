[Hook]
Knots, cash in my pockets
And what's the trip, ain't no body hockey
I'm stacking, stacking, head ain't stopping
My banging, banging, man I'm clockin'
Knots, cash in my pockets
And what's the trip, ain't no body hockey
I'm stacking, stacking, head ain't stopping
My banging, banging, man I'm clockin'

[Verse]
I don't give a fuck
I really don't care, these boys bang out of luck
And I know it sucks
[?]
But it's cool
[?]
So don't touch me, bitch, your hatred
It makes it easier to say I made it
[?]
Ask yourself, is it worth it?
To lose my life, cause a nigga workin'?
Then ask yourself, do I wanna die?
Cause a nigga ballin' really high?
[?]

[Hook]
Knots, cash in my pockets
And what's the trip, ain't no body hockey
I'm stacking, stacking, head ain't stopping
My banging, banging, man I'm clockin'
Knots, cash in my pockets
And what's the trip, ain't no body hockey
I'm stacking, stacking, head ain't stopping
My banging, banging, man I'm clockin'
