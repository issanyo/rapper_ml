(Chorus)
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time

(Verse 1)
I'm bout to show this mark i'm the man
And let his bitch ass know, he's dealt his last hand
This boys lights are about to get put out
And no one will hear the shots
It's too late, mark trick you made your choice
When you put, a tone front your voice
And talked all of that bitch shit
Not knowing, who you was clashing with
Deep down you know you's a mark and it shows on the outside, coming from your heart
Subconciously you think supposed to feel for ya
But you's a busta and I won't cut for ya
Your decision was made, we in death mode
You're part time but I keeps mine locked on
Today is your day, your shit at home
To bad for you cause i'm bringin it on

(Chorus)
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time

(Verse 2)
You just a hater who threw off my move
But what you don't know, you're about to be pursued
See i'm wise, I won't shoot you in public
Imma wait until nobody knows it
Imma catch your bitch ass around the corner
And you won't even know you's a goner
And if you do recognize my car, it won't matter cause your ass won't get far
Caught you slipping with that steel
Had to give you something you could feel
And the feeling was permanent
Cause you stiff on the cement
Asphalt got your body in a straight plane
You're chill now that your mouth is closed mane
Now your trap locked, you's a cool nigga
Now you back to real status, thanks to my trigga


(Chorus)
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time
Clear your mind
It's death time
