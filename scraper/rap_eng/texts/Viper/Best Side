[Chorus: King Xavier]
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side

[Verse 1: Viper The Rapper]
Tricks, all about the paper
Stayin' in the game, never been a hater
I'm taking big trips across the world
Thinkin bout my diamonds and my pearls
Chillin in the spot, where the players ball
Deep in St. Paul in America's Mall
The tour startin' in Minessotta so crank it up
At "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" Club
I rocked the show, now its time to go
Due east on my way to Chicago
As I'm ballin' I fall through Milwaukee
To pick up some beer talkin' on my walkie talkie
Cell phone, hollerin' at my boys
I never seen a lake bigger than the one in Illinois
Man, this here's for real
Takin' trips round the states for my rhyme appeal

[Chorus: King Xavier]
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side

[Verse 2: Viper The Rapper]
Leave Milwaukee on my way to Detroit
Where the thugs are thugs, Gs on point
I'm kickin' it all in the city
Ballas actin' wild, and ladies lookin' pretty
I'm thinkin it's just so real
Seems like most the folk here work for the steel companies
Now I'm headin' to Boston
Stop to watch an NBA game, and The Garden still flossin'
On my way to Washington
Where my cousin lives out by the projects
One, love as I chill with my niggas
And they say I got an accent, how do they figure?
He's headin' me off with style
Breakin me off with a nine inch wild
Now I'm in New York, to be exact Manhattanhn
Stoppin' in Harlem cause I can't be high cappin'

[Chorus: King Xavier]
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side

[Verse 3: Viper The Rapper]
Now I'm headin down the east coast
North Carolina, where Jordan was hoopin no doubt
Out on my way to G.A
Atlanta, the town where them ballas get paid
Then I make a move through Tennessee
To spend some time with the crunk OGs
Then I pass through Mississippi...
...Now, Gs know me
Gotta do a show in New Orleans
Stop at the Grand for some D-I-C-E
Then I roll through my home state
Texas playa', where life is great
Hittin up Phoenix, AZ
On my way to LA if you know what I mean
Last stop, San Fran, that's a bet
Lookin' at the world's best sunset

[Chorus: King Xavier]
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
As I ride
Through the best side
