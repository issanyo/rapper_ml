[Hook]
It ain't nothing like shinin'
Find me reclining
With somethin' new
When it comes to this blang game I'm a fool
It ain't nothing like shinin'
Find me reclining
With somethin' new
When it comes to this blang game I'm a fool

[Verse 1]
I'm the coldest shining
Models knock me off then they smash rewinding
That means they rewind then ask them the next day
And let me hit the same way
But if I want, they let me change it up
And let me knock em down any way that I want
This cash got me stuck goin' crazy
But the way I got a lil' even amaze me
I done got paid and bad chicks on my jimmy
Now, all they bodies, they all give me
My diamonds blang as I mall, by my Gs
All these haters thinkin' they can be like me
I'm sayin' please
And they tryin' everything to keep me from my green
They even threw me in the penitentiary
But it ain't work, and I ain't goin' back
And now I'm locked in on a nigga cash
Now I'm makin' major bread, free or incarcerated
They can't stop my money flow, and now these [?] haters hate
Everyday a new spot, everyday a bad chick
Everyday new bread, protected by a goon clique
Cutthroat thugs that'll put you to sleep
Just fuck thinkin bout testin' me
Cause a lot of marks hate instead of keepin' it G
Change the root of all evil to jealousy

[Hook]
It ain't nothing like shinin'
Find me reclining
With somethin' new
When it comes to this blang game I'm a fool
It ain't nothing like shinin'
Find me reclining
With somethin' new
When it comes to this blang game I'm a fool

[Verse 2]
My piece and chain shine everywhere
Even in my dreams, I'm locked in a shine stare
I'm made in real life and made in my sleep
It's like I can't get away from my money
In reality I got cars and houses
And a gang of bad gals that pull up they blouses
I got so much cash, clothes, and jewelry
That I could give my piece and haters still wouldn't feel me
I got so much money, it's almost like I stole somethin'
While snitches popping cheap champagne bottles, frontin'
I'm on another level
Foes wanna catch me for my [?] and my bevel
The dividends I make
Got me givin' high stakes
It's like I got eyes in the back of my head
For these clowns that wanna end up dead
But tryna get me for my bread
Did you hear what I said?
I don't care if you're hungry or fed
Try to snatch my chain, I'mma fill you with lead
I got too much value
To lose my life to ne'er one of you
Cause it done got too good
So I'mma keep it goin' like I should

[Hook]
It ain't nothing like shinin'
Find me reclining
With somethin' new
When it comes to this blang game I'm a fool
It ain't nothing like shinin'
Find me reclining
With somethin' new
When it comes to this blang game I'm a fool
