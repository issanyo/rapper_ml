[Hook] [x2]

I roll big bank
I stack all day
My cash don't cease
It just increase

[Verse 1]

I'm a thug that destroys combatants whereva
It's like I'm thunder the way I bring tha weatha
When I clown these boys they claim they not embarrassed
But how can that be when the girls they scarin?
The ladies flock to me through the conflict duration
Meanwhile these boys game plans need alterations
After they loss they run back to they clique fast
But it don't matter 'cause nobody in they clique has
The talent to beat this G they know what they facin'
When it's bout testin' me it's best to do a cancellation
'cause when boys think they can beat me
I help em see, they i-mag-in-ing
I'm the power behind the grind, its generator
Men lose to me, and it don't get greater later
Dudes are jealous
Of my shine
But not enough
To come try mine

[Hook] [x2]

I roll big bank
I stack all day
My cash don't cease
It just increase

[Verse 2]


My diamonds shine, so bright whereas
Boys want to be in my shoes but they can't handle the task
Of being the best
In the hustle of course
My call out for competition goes unenforced
My shine and grind go together, they don't alternate
Meanwhile all these men broke
And stuck with no cake
And when they finally step up
They lose then bail
Give em' a heartless assault, cuz they tested my mail
I light 'em up, like a candle
With a barrage of strikes, that they can't handle
I'm the one and only, while these dudes are all the same
Busted pocked bustas that'll always be lame
Foes minus me is me, do the math
They choose they routes wisely, and don't take this path
'cause when they do it's imminent destruction
They self-esteem I shatter, their confidence I busted



[Hook] [ x2]

I roll with bank
I stack all day
My cash don't cease
It just increase
