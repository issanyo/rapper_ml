I'm stuck on grind
I gots to shine

(Verse 1)
I'm making paper constantly
Sometimes I don't know what to do with the cheese
Might just go and buy a new low

Gunshot and i'm outta here
I'm a star you'll never a trust like (?)

(Chorus)
I'm stuck on grind
I gots to shine
I'm stuck on grind
I gots to shine
I'm stuck on grind
I gots to shine
