[Hook]
Money, coming in from everywhere
Got me feelin' like something equal to a millionaire
It's like it's pourin' out the air
It's got me thinking, should life be this fair?
Money, coming in from everywhere
Got me feelin' like something equal to a millionaire
It's like it's pourin' out the air
It's got me thinking, my life is so fair

[Verse 1]
My cash makes these haters have manners
And take the title as they bawl off planners
These marks' plans never go forth
I laugh about it, while I rake up my starred decisions
I make to break cops, they undisclosed
And they attempts in battle, have been disposed
When I'm offered in of there's, no escape
I eradicate them, and don't let them mate
Eh, in this hustle
They knew off the top that they swag had no muscle
I even decimate click, no prisoners, just casualties
Leaving entire teams is nothing but catastrophes
My life is so plus, or shall I say, so great
There's only 7 days in the week I wish it was 8
These snitches can't approach, they stay still
While I intimidate, always in motion

[Hook]
Money, coming in from everywhere
Got me feelin' like something equal to a millionaire
It's like it's pourin' out the air
It's got me thinking, should life be this fair?
Money, coming in from everywhere
Got me feelin' like something equal to a millionaire
It's like it's pourin' out the air
It's got me thinking, my life is so fair

[Verse 2]
Pretty girls come to my crib and get bare
While rappers are wearing, piece and chain shaped square
The way I mall, dang discreet
I buy things that are unique, and shine every week
Enemies wanna finish me, but I won't have it
They offence is disoriented and erratic
I'm left with cash and thangs on the ride
While all of they efforts ladies criticise
Then analyse, then finalise
Then put me number one after they categorise
All rivals will either
Run from the battle, or get pounced by a beaver
Shiner, that bare chicks bring the gift
Of letting their clothes slip off for the top G, mallin'
One reason why I make, so I'm never fallin'

[Hook]
Money, coming in from everywhere
Got me feelin' like something equal to a millionaire
It's like it's pourin' out the air
It's got me thinking, should life be this fair?
Money, coming in from everywhere
Got me feelin' like something equal to a millionaire
It's like it's pourin' out the air
It's got me thinking, my life is so fair
