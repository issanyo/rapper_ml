[Hook]
My hops
They wanna see me gone cause of my hops
Shot in the dome cause of my hops
And fallin' on four cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprained cause of my hops
And sleeping in a grave cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops

[Verse 1]
Ballers know the deal when they see me in the place
Follow up, two hand dunk
Nuts in ya face
See, you was under the goal
Where the big boys play
So now you know
I'm 6'2 with crazy hops
From that two-hand in my video
I'm still gettin props
Like me, I wear a size 10
That's why I'm gettin' bucked time and time again
Boys look like they wanna squabble
When they see me snow-bird
'Cause they know they gonna get a 2 hand reverse!
Or I might just do a self alley...
And hang on the rim until your posse wanna blast me
Yeah, that's how I do
On this hoop court, I'm a fool
And I'm still getting up
To get the whole place crunk

[Hook]
My hops
They wanna see me gone cause of my hops
Shot in the dome cause of my hops
And fallin' on four cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprained cause of my hops
And sleeping in a grave cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops

[Verse 2]
I'm paid, I gives a fuck about a win
I'm trying to get me a nasty bandit
A loss I dont parâ€”
I leave the court and get freaked by three stars
That's the life of a G
My hoop shorts too long to ever see a knee
White or black t-shirt
That's a bet
And I'm always dry, 'cause real ballers never sweat
Damn, a thug got game
I could've hooped in the pros
But motherfuck a play
And boys know where I be
Marian ballin, is where to find me
Hooping on a Thursday night
Rising to the occasion, and taking type flight
And oh yeah, I got that thang with me
Under the bleachers you'll do a 360

[Hook]
My hops
They wanna see me gone cause of my hops
Shot in the dome cause of my hops
And fallin' on four cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprained cause of my hops
And sleeping in a grave cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me gone cause of my hops
Shot in the dome cause of my hops
And fallin' on four cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprained cause of my hops
And sleeping in a grave cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops
My hops
