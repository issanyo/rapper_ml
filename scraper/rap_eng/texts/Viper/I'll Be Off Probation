My diamonds got you speech-less
Your hatreds at a peak- rest
You ain't seen nothin like this
No way for bustas stingin mayja licks
See im chillin, with gals on my dick
I know u wanna kill, gone and try trick
I'm goin off like a bomb
Blazin them thangs, rich gold, and I'm smart
It's a trip you marks can't get nothin I just get paid
All you can do is baller hate
And I'm still gone get this cash
So as far as I'm concerned, you can kiss my ass
I'm goin in if you ever by the hoop court
Everyday im swangin, steady clippin
Holla cuz you death wish evident
To show your favorite rappers, my trips like this
But to my true fans I got love cuz
You kept it real, thats tight, always showin up
But i'm the peoples fav, and you kept it trill
So we can run and ball our gats while i'm slangin bills
We goin ballin thats a lifestyle that malls
We didn't ball, we just.. Shot called
We gone sip drink and blow kill
Wit a little X and pop a few pills
Do a little baller hating, you'll see
Just why wit that nigga VIP wit Lee
But not too much
Just enough for me and you to show love
For one another, we kick back
Thats how real ballas do it just like that
I'll be off probation and there will be no retest
We'll have more fun, than yo friends
