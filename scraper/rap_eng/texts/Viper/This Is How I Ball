[Hook]
This is how I ball
This is how I ball
This is how I ball
This is how I ball

[Verse 1]
Always knew, call despair
Cause I always ride new
Don't ask why
That's just how I do
My hip staying packed
With them greenbacks
And it ain't playin' or an act
It's real life, I roll like that
When dows' swipe me
From the diamonds in my pieces like a fire-starter
My brain has got my eyes on hold
I look down, all I see is shining bright gold
I hold above my eyes
To make sure my blingin' got me hypnotised
I'm gone sting with my jewelery
I wonder will these boys ever feel me
Probably not, and I don't care cause all the shit I got

[Hook]
This is how I ball
This is how I ball
This is how I ball
This is how I ball

[Verse 2]
My legs won't stop
Back to back, as I reach the top
[?]
And what's while
[?]
I ride in style
[?]
Like a solar flare
It's not fair, the way I mash on these boys
When they see me, they self-esteem is destroyed
My toys, will let me crush these perpetraitors
And become a pride annihilator
And it's just gonna get harder for these haters
[?]
And if they don't, they won't matter
[?]

[Hook]
This is how I ball
This is how I ball
This is how I ball
This is how I ball
