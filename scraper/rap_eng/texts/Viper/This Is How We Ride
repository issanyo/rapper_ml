This is how we ride
Forever we gon' glide
Hollow points that slide
This is how we ride
Forever we gon try

[Intro 1: Viper]
Money
Whats the motherfucking deal
I got my pistol tell ya thug just how you feel

[Intro 2: G-Money]
Now straight to the point motherfucker
I just smoked a joint motherfucker
That means I’m on point motherfucker
There’s a dot on ya knot motherfucker
There's a legend in your ear motherfucker

[Verse 1: G-Money]
Got 20s on my impala, we came to holla
Check, my bitch count run from here to Guatemala
Oh, as if you didn’t know? It’s simple
Trynna ride my ride to the top yo heart stop
Fuck gold diggers, I only fuck with mob type figures
[?] fucking pitiful
The legendary crew is top notch
A slip - they be collecting ya blood in blotches
Cause y'all hate how we're quicker than stopwatches
This ain't no fucking bump on tha song
If you think it is you got it all wrong
Ya funeral be full of sad song
I also smoke - got a bong
So be quick to thump, if ya jump, chump
[?] crown in my glass
As I flip in my motherfucking E class
Oh my ride, consists
Triple beams, four screens, special effects, and techs
I like number 9
Use it if you fuck with my shine
My mods stays in grind
Is all about getting paid
I got a private pilot and a jet
To dump my distractors in the everglades
Got hollow point slides for shady guys
See y'all rather see me on the ventilator
That’s why I’m hoping with my elegant touch my
Accelerator, [?] city player, yep it's bread
Like fine wine, my love gots to shine
Rearrange your spine, nigga ain't got time
Love actually
Fuck - Can't even raise hoes like attraction
Why? Cause I can
Got my whole benjamin plan
To tell the truth, it’s kinda hard to swallow
Make the trip like Fred trip on Rollo
Hair line like Apollo
Jump back in my ride with a bitch in slides

[Hook]
Cause this is how we ride
Forever we gon' glide
Hollow points that slide

Cause this is how we ride
Forever we gon' glide
Hollow points that slide
