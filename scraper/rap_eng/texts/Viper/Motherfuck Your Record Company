[Verse 1]
Wassup bussa, I gotta let ya know
I got the fo-fo moving fast on ya ho
Motherfuck you and your record label
Let's gone get raw and take it to the next level
I heard what you and your partner was spittin'
That was bitch shit, now the pump gon be hittin'
Fuck all the niggers in yo crew
Be a real nigga and ride solo fool
Bustin' station cars swanging in ya videos
And you use the same gals that I used before
I know you wanting me to shine
Hell naw nigga, you done lost yo mind
And come on time, with a bitch ass nigga
Bout to see flame pops true ass killa
And I don't give a fuck how much they pay me
It'll be on your shit they have to slay me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm calling you bustas out
I dare one of you faggots to come to my house
Cuz while you come through to hoop or hate
I'm blasting soon as you hit the gate
And I'ma go hard
Fuck a funeral, you getting buried in my backyard
Stepped on the lawn of G
And got popped in the head real quickly
I'm supposed to be sad cause you a walkin five ten?
Holla at Gawd, that's between you and him
What's between us the hollow point to your chest cavity
Now pause for a nigga as you pulled by gravity
That's what I'm talking about, gangster shit
Faggot ass busta got your top half split
