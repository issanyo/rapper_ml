[Chorus]
So...
It is on...
And I'm back...
In my chrome...
[x2]

I walk around widda chip on my shoulda
A lot more mature and a little olda
I look at the world in a ruthless way
A aggrivated killa ready to smoke u mane
Although an optimist I look at thinks differently
Eyes open, watchin, for anything
Maybe it's because I'm holdin' myself into this
Caught into a black abyss
Now I just ride
Hopin' to blast at the drop of a dime
Watchin' boys ot the corna of my dome...
Cuz any second it could be on..
Cuz now shit could turn to a street war
Everywhere you go, niggas ready to pour
Yo blood in the sewer
And leave you leakin' like a lua

[Chorus]


Everyday, I'm seein' less and less haters
I guess the sayin' true, that, it's greata layta
And I'm lovin' that there
So I keep rollin through with no fear
Steppin around, like a lion in a jungle
Waitin' on a nigga to prey on and take under
I ain't playin witcha, this shit life
And im quick to take you down and cut you up like a knife
Niggas wit smiles on they faces not takin shit serious
And they get fucked up and left delirious
And curious, leave wonderin', “why did it go down?”
Cuz u was fuckin' around, like a damn clown
The bustas better wake up and think
Before you see a flash blink
Right by the corna' of your head
Then realize your bitch ass dead

[Chorus]
