[Hook]
Anywhere you wanna go, girl it's on me
Don't worry about the price cuz I got that cheese
Whatever it costs, I got it to spend it
Your imagination is the only limit

[Verse 1]
My shine is official
Competition ain't close, not even a little
These dudes know what's up
They se I'm made and it makes they anger erupt
Me ballin on ya is inescapable
Furthermore, no man is capable
Of shinin like me
I wish these men would start jumpin'
I've been waitin for a reason for my 45 to start dumpin'
But these fellas scared to test me, and I know why
They seein' how my money multiplies
And it's good that they so observant
Cuz if they sets gone get broke up
The hearse gone start splurgin'
The end result
Of bein' my prey
Bein' put to peace wit
Nothin to say
As I continue clownin'
With these girls on my tip
Sitting back in the cut
Watchin' boys anger trip

[Hook]
Anywhere you wanna go, girl it's on me
Don't worry about the price cuz I got that cheese
Whatever it costs, I got it to spend it
Your imagination is the only limit

[Verse 2]
I top ball, these marks smiles I erase
They wanna win like me but they know they cain't
They straight loose lips as they watch me clown
These haters talk down but I still run this town
These dudes are worthless I wonder what's they function
And when a G get close, they ain't sayin nothin
I mean nothin, not even a mumble
All day, these men I crumble
And crush, unda my feat
As the girls say I make they heart skip a beat
It's my obligation
To inform these marks about they balla-hation
On me, but my shine too nice
When I buy something, I don't care bout the price
Peep a balla's rise
My cash pile done got so high, it's as high as the sky
