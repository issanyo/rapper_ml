Feel the play of a G
So much money, haters envy me
Wavin' that paper like it's going out of style
It oughta be against the law the way I clown
Feel the play of a G
So much money, haters envy me
Wavin' that paper like it's going out of style
It oughta be against the law the way I clown

[Verse 1]
All you haters, pretty girl exclude
Cause this paper they persue

With merciless aggression
[?]
And then we make it rain
[?]
I got so much money
[?]
I spend 20 stacks at the mall, it ain't nothin'

Feel the play of a G
So much money, haters envy me
Wavin' that paper like it's going out of style
It oughta be against the law the way I clown
