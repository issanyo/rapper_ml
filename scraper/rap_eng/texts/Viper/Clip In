(Chorus)
I lost her
I faced it
I lost her
One day she'll come back, but I lost her
I lost her
I lost her
One day she'll come back, but I lost her

(Verse 1)
I sit and wonder how it would've been, If I would've kept my girl in my life
But, I threw it off
Trying to be the boss, slang and floss
I got tossed like a nina ross
I was tripping, now i'm thugged out
G'd up, with clip in, hustling, shot calling, not falling, big balling
And I'm deep in the game, ain't nothing changed
It just got rearranged, I be like man, how long can I grind?
How long can I shine?
How long will time be on my side to ride, as I glide
And I be like man I bumped it off
I wish I would'a been more real to her, mane
But I throwed it off, now I'm just moving in this thang
Riding through, contemplating the days of my past
Waiting to get somebody straight, ready to blast
Hustling, tussling, rustling
Never will a G be struggling
Shrugging, loving
The memories of when we were hugging

(Chorus)
Though I lost her
One day she'll come back, but I lost her
One day she'll come back, but I lost her
Yeah, one day she'll come back, but I lost her
I lost her
I lost her
I lost her
I lost her
