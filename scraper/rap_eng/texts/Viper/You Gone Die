[Chorus]
You gone die..
You fucked off my drive-by
It can't slide...
If it was me it wouldn't ride...
[x2]


Mothafucka thought yo sawed off could split me
But I was ready when you tried to come and get me
It was real though you gave it a try
But I saw yo bitch ass out the corna of my eye
I saw you comin' fast in the black, lac
And I knew what was up, cuz I heard that
You wanted to smoke me cuz yo ego got tapped
When you heard I called you, a mark and a rap
I got you now mark you tried to resolve
But that shit you shot, really wasn't nothin
You rolled down ya windows, and you throwed your flex
But what you ain't know, I was ready for what was next
When you slid round the corna...
You ain't know I already had everythang set up one ya
My niggas all box you in
And put that bag ova ya head so you ain't know what's happenin

[Chorus]

Now I got yo bitchass in my warehouse
With that bag ova ya heard now whatchu talkin bout
Straight beatin that ass
Makin sure, that you know, im about to blassst
You gone die, in layman's terms
You was fuckin widda killa, and got yoself burned
But don't worry, won't be much more pain
Cuz I'm about to put this bullet, inside ya brain
Now tell me, how does it feel?
To know, that you's about to get killed
And to know, that, you made a fatal choice
To test the G, that keeps the most
So gone, and say your last words
Cuz this gone be the last shit that u eva heard
Now peep
This was yo life
Watch this shit flasssh
In front of yo eyes

[Chorus]
