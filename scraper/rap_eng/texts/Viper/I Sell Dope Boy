[Hook]
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust

[Verse 1]
This is Southwest rolling in
Ready to bust time and time again
I'll let these boys know from the start
None of these cowards got no heart
I gotta throw it out there, for all y'all
These are no contact, like baseball
They wouldn't do nothing, even if I enticed ya
Cause these bullets'll slice ya
Up, like a knife
Ten seconds later (later), you lost your life
All for looking for a quick comeup
But they still got ya done up
I got my gun up, ready to bust
In lead I trust, I'll put these boys in the dust
It's time to take a little trip
But you ain't coming back, cause bitch you slipped

[Hook]
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust

[Verse 2]
Watch how I ride
Ho-ass niggas know it's homicide
When you're just a beginner,
Shoot you in the throat with the pull up, nigga
Getting under their skin
I don't ball blanks
After I smoke 'em, I wonder who's next
Aiming at necks, like a guillotine
Tell these bitch niggas I hustle for lean
I roll by, looking clean
With the coldest piece and chain that you ever seen
Right before your lights get dimmed
After you're hit by the 9mm
Your head explodes
Like a plastic bottle left in the road
Something 'bout you looking dead look tight
Adrenaline got you too high

[Hook]
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
