This is thug verses, I thought'cha knew
No sounds came out, and you don't know who
Hitcha, butcha got put down quick
Now you dead dreamin' bout two thousand six
Back door hit yo boys in tha dome
Now you gone from the nickel plated chrome
Those haters thinkin' they could stop me
But I switched it up, and made you sloppy
They gone catch you up and send you to church
But you ain't hoppin out a lac you comin out of a hearse
And when they read yo eulogy
Word gone pass, you got stumped by C
Another dead in the line of fire
Wasn't drafted but enlisted, and got retired
Now you know what's the deal, R.I.P. chill, the cap gone kill

R.I.P. verses


Just got word from my lawyer he say
The most that I'd get is one to thirty days
Preached at'cha DA finally saw for real
And the judge showed a balla, how she feel
Now it's time, to celebrate
Life is good, yeuh life is great
Bout to hit down town chill for a little bit
My cap three quarters back mane im legit
Niggas lookin at me crazy as these gals set me down
And they choosin the thug, as the club parks a sound, out the speakers
Why? Cuz I'm the shit
And to top it off, a nigga rich
Eight gals to a head time to do what I do
This dime rubbin' on a balla, and her crew is too
Drinkin', and they straight lovin' me though
Hit some powder, little X, now they ready to go!
To my crib!
