(Viper: Chorus)
Girls love me cause i'm so real
Cause i'm laid back, cause i'm so chill
Sharing they emotions and how they really feel
That's why with me they all make life long deals
Girls love me cause i'm so real
Cause i'm laid back, cause i'm so chill
Sharing they emotions and how they really feel
That's why with me they all make life long deals


(Cobra: Verse 1)
I call, all the girls come with expedience
To see what i'm doing and how my times being spent
They all call me boyfriend so they know what i'm doin'
In the cut with some models under my influence
Demolishing I put on these boys isn't broke
While i'm seeing cash in the form of triple digit notes
Makin these boys feel the suffering they need
All the while maintaining my power and prestige
The world top shiner, droppin' boys in the first round
Super heavyweight, puttin' all of these dudes down
I keep it baller every single time
Men hate me as i'm winning for mine
Be hustling staging big licks
While these boys wanna put me in a fix
But they can't harm me, i'm too paid
Already stung and already made

(Cobra: Chorus)
Girls love me cause i'm so real
Cause i'm laid back, cause i'm so chill
Sharing they emotions and how they really feel
That's why with me they all make life long deals
Girls love me cause i'm so real
Cause i'm laid back, cause i'm so chill
Sharing they emotions and how they really feel
That's why with me they all make life long deals

(Verse 2: Viper)
I'm the grinds only expert
Peep out a balla as i put in work
My cake got the cutie pies jubalent
I get what they want and don't see a pocket dent
I'm the only man that the girls notice
And the shine of my grind keeps boys unfocused
I'm giving these bustas doom
All the while the pretty ladies resume, to go all out, for this thug
They all fall for me and give me all they love
In conflict challengers are always proud
I'm always a winner it's never a close bout
My grind shine game, reigns supreme
And i'm getting the rewards from what my hustling brings
Jewelry, cars, houses, girls everything in the world

(Viper: Chorus)
Girls love me cause i'm so real
Cause i'm laid back, cause i'm so chill
Sharing they emotions and how they really feel
That's why with me they all make life long deals
Girls love me cause i'm so real
Cause i'm laid back, cause i'm so chill
Sharing they emotions and how they really feel
That's why with me they all make life long deals
