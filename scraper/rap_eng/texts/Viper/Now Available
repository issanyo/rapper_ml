Aw baby when you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it

[Verse 1]
The way that body lookin', got the hustle on pause
Tryna' get you on my team, and outta them drawls
Let me [?] my word game, tryna' get you out the thong and into the rain
It's strange, the way you make me feel
Is it your personality or sex appeal
I don't know, but you got my attention
And it's a few things I got to mention
This girl got the face of an angel
It's like you're looking at a queen from every angle
A butt like that is hard to find
The dimple in her chin is bigger than mine
The backside, looks so damn clean
With the prettiest legs a nigga ever seen
Smooth-ass skin, with the six pack
Perfect all around, you'll fall in love with that

[Hook]
Aw baby when you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it

[Verse 2]
Damn baby girl, body off the chain
You a work of art, that's stuck in my brain
I'm like "Man, this girl is fine
I better put her down as a girl of mine"
I'm inclined, to throw up my weight
The fact that I'm winnin' in this [?] would chase
But she ain't even trippin' on the cash I'm pullin'
This girl don't have no ulterior motives
She just ballin' for me 'cause I'm grindin'
Though she probably do like the way these diamonds shinin'
Rainbow colors, blue green yellow red
Flashin' through her mind and goin' through her head
It's something 'bout the way she looks in my eyes
She ain't 'fraid to stare, and with me that's alright
Never had a boyfriend, just turned nineteen
She want me to be the one that turned her on to the scene

[Hook]
Aw baby when you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you --
Aw baby when you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you --
Aw baby when you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
When you move it, and you groove it
And you grind it, please rewind it
