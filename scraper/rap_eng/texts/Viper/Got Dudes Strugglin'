[Chorus]
These dudes can't find a new hustle
Cause I got em all locked on struggle
I watch as they fall off the grind
They realize it'll never be they time
[x2]


Potential licks, I evaluate
If you talking pretty girls I hold the most weight
I make my competitors tremble in fear
Show em they'll never compare and then get em out of there
I'm such a calm and collected individual
That win so big, it's critical
For these boys to understand they can't get with me
I'm too talented and skilled and they can't compete
I'm clownin' too hard, and that's a bet
Men wanna throw me off and catch me up like a net
But i'm too smart, and self contained
To get myself caught up in the game
I ball, and fall thru clean
Boys want my life cause how my diamonds gleam
But I won't let it it happen, ima keep rappin'
Hittin major licks as boys keep dirt nappin'


[Chorus]


In battle dude's first strike, I just evade
I win every fight then chill, as I made
All the girls say me n them are indivisible
And the way they handle me is so sensual
I'm the emperor, my whole home power is fearless
Before challengers hit the square I make them hearless
I'm running circles round boys like Jupiter
As cutie pies call me and say 'we scoopin ya'
Up to freak it down so get ready to have it
That's the lifestyle I live, straight up lavish
You boys ain't even had, your first three way
While I'm foursomes and fivesomes every other day
I'm big cash, these chumps are small cake
Holla at a thug when you get up your greenweight
These men ain't ready, cause they funds too low
And they frustrated cause with me all the girls go


[Chorus]
