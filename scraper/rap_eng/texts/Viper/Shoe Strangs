Fat stacks
Is what I stand
Fuck a rubber band
I tie cash with shoe strangs
I don't do small bills
And we don't do frontin
10k and 20k stacks
All hundreds
Fuck a price tag
I'll about a stole
I'm also straight stunting
Like you Neva seen before
Crank it up
Boys mean mug gives a test
Real easy when I pull a strang on my cash
Your rain game is trash if it's dollar bills
So We rain hundreds just to show our strang skills
It's real in tha Field
Watch as I make hunnies dip
And while we in tha field
Let me take ya on a trip

All this cash I got
I should put it in tha bank
I won't do that
Cause I got too much already in that thang
I like to keep four stacks
No less than 10k each
No need to pop a band
Cause that string pull with ease
I be cashed up
Like I stole something
They be looking mad
But they ain't gon do me nothing
Stocking up on APL's
And new gold
Cause tha game is sold
And i told
My cash stacking up
Like that White House steps
Your presidents burned out
But mine never left
Reach in your pockets
And tell me what you feel
If you got stacks we call that a fire drill
