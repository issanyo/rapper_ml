I ride for my gang
I'm keepin' my thang
I ride for my lick
Im deep off in this
I ride for my gang
I'm keepin' my thang
I ride for my lick
Im deep off in this


Heartless..
My style as I'm bussin'
I gotcha boys sayin `in god we trussin'`
You dealin' with a ruthless, killer
I had to blast on ya, left your eyes open front and center
And hot lead straight poured on ya
Another body for the corrona'
Now sleep in peace
Like boys in the hood
For the kids to see
Except it's more than just one body
It's you... and all your click, ridin' homies
Cuz I'm sending boys to judgement in packs
You just die quicker when you're crewed 'ot like that
See mane, I don't slumber
They lied when they told you it was safety in numbers
See you thought that your click could save ya...
But I smoked your boys first, before I sprayed ya


I ride for my gang
I'm keepin my thang
I ride for my lick
Im deep off in this
I ride for my gang
I'm keepin my thang
I ride for my lick
Im deep off in this


These homos body like, hoes
Five bustas in a ride, three niggas in the back rubbin', thighs
And you claiming that ya hard
I backslap your best-friend, and pull his bitch-card
Marks barkin' loud cuz they not fuckin' in the mall
Tell me how you think your thuggin', and thatcha ball
The only ballin' that ya doin is rippin your bottom lip
Im bout to grab my nine, and commence to pistol whip
And pimp you, and all your crew
And leave you toe down, in the back of your coupe
These boys need to take some advice
Stop ridin trick-deep like your buyin my white
I give a damn if these your cousins or your brothers
Cuz I can't tell if this your homies or your horny side-lovers
These niggas lettin boys talk they way in they loads
When real niggas only ride with hoes...

I ride for my gang
I'm keepin my thang
I ride for my lick
Im deep off in this
I ride for my gang
I'm keepin my thang
I ride for my lick
Im deep off in this
