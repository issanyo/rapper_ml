[Chorus]
Thuggin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Hustlin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Bustlin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Tusslin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made

[Verse 1]
Fallin' off
In tha cut
We're fallin', knock a nigga out
In one punch
But niggas won’t fight no more
Cause it’s like that
So I do what they do
And chill with a black gat
Balla made, my click
Used to be three but now its one
And the whole team balla made broke up
Now it's just a dog ridin solo
Ballin' deep doing thangs
Riding on you hoes
And those boys know
Who I be
Same thug that starred in 3 movies
"Fifth Ward", "Thug Life", "H Town M.O.B"
Rent the DVD
And you’ll remember me
In the movie
I was a baller selling cards
And like then, I'm
Still keepin' on
And I'm still talking to (?)
(?) hearts maintaining heat like my swanger

[Chorus]
Thuggin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Hustlin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Bustlin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Tusslin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made

[Verse 2]
I’m on a loop
Cashin' hustlin' thick every day
Gotta have it made
Thug gotta get paid
Locked off in this gangsta shit
Ballin' up fetty, better hit not miss
While these hatas steady talkin' and fakin'
I'm off in they hood stackin' loot, they ain't makin
Getting major ghetto love
Makin' tricks fly away like doves
Players give me invites to come ballin' hoop
I show love back, stayin' forever true
This what’s going down
That’s whats up tho
While these boys steady happy with the 44
It's fucked up tho, when it go down I'm strap
Fuck these bitch ass niggas, yeah
I got my pack
I keep my eyes open, ready for the blast
"POW POW POW POW" as the bullets cross

[Chorus]
Thuggin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Hustlin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Bustlin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Tusslin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made

[Verse 3]
The second member of the clique
Is doing thangs
Making big money deep in the dope game
The third member
Moved to LA
Grindin', surviving
In his own way
One day, (?) acting (?)
I wish you the best, I hope you transpire
While some boys (?) to hustle
Standing tall, still I ball
Locked in the struggle
Imma hold it down till the day you reunite
But if we never do I know we’ll still be tight
Lee Dogg represent
The balla made lee
The balla made clique
Yeah mane that’s on the real
That’s how I feel
Check ball
Lee Dogg forever
Catch ya boy slippin' past
It's whatever

[Chorus]
Thuggin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Hustlin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Bustlin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
Tusslin’
Locked off in the game
Ain't nothin’ changed
The clique still balla made
