In the hood
There's no other place for me
In the hood
There's no place I'd rather be

[Verse 1: Viper The Rapper]
Ghetto rules are hard to understand
It's tough to survive if you don't know a man
Thug deep, ballin' through the urban sands
Ridin' solo, wheels at my command
It seems that ghetto dreams
Are deep in my mind as they just beam
I can see 'em in the distance like a light
Making me do the thangs that I do, it's alright
Stars down, ready for the sparkin'
Playa' on the scene, and you know I'm ghetto walkin'
I'm stompin', falling through a ghetto [?]
Run up on my Glock, and you know it's ghetto talkin'
All my homeboys, yeah they showin' much love
Like it's comin' down, from above
I keep on pressin' with these ghetto dreams
Ghetto beams, and ghetto things

[Hook: Ice LaBell]
In the hood
There's no other place for me
In the hood
There's no place I'd rather be

[Verse 2: Viper The Rapper]
I'm flippin', and I'm fallin, and I'm kickin' so real
Everythang is chill, lick reveal
It's amazing, matta' fact, balla' made
As I kick back, doin' this thang every day
But it's cool, It's calling r.a.p.p.i.n.g
And all my boys feel me
I ride with G's I grew up with
And I ain't even trippin, it's a major lick
Them boys are all about they paper, and all about they cash
Movin' thangs quick, and movin' thangs fast
In this concrete jungle, as we're bumpin' these woofers, in 6 x 9's
With an 8th on the [?]
Greater, later, left/right, faders
System heard for miles, and you know we ain't no haters
We stackin' paper every day
Ballin', shotcallin', and [?] away

In the hood
There's no other place for me
In the hood
There's no place I'd rather be

[Verse 3: Viper]
Ghetto rules had me mad, but never sad
Plenty did my head while I'm doin' our task
Thinkin' to myself, as the tape rewinds
A playa' gotta stay deep on his grind
I'm scoopin' up, one of them G's
We're bout to head downtown for a meetin' in the industry
The game of fame, and everythang' is so legit
In this game we ain't gon' neva' quit
My boy told me once "parlay and just play"
In this thang' that's real, for us to be made
I dwell amongst tall buildings, a city slicker
Keepin' it cool, so I'm blowin' up quicker
I'm chillin' like that boy said to do
Keepin' it cool, even with the ghetto rules
And understand the ghetto wells
The ghetto rules, and the ghetto tales

In the hood
There's no other place for me
In the hood
There's no place I'd rather be
In the hood
There's no other place for me
In the hood
There's no place I'd rather be
