Let's ball
We ain't gone fall
Twennys gone crawl
All we gone do is hoop call
[/hook]


[verse1]
Peep play, it's hoop time today
I'm bout to rise, on my opponents mane
Going to the whole court at Marian
Hoop court tonight and it's on son
You better have your hops right
Don't take it personal when i take top flight
I only play whole court and basketball is my main sport
Im dribbling behind my back
Niggas sick cuz I got that AND1 swag
They can't steal the ball
Plus im a star so I got it all
Im going behind, all my thugs layups
Cuz im looking for a 2-hand follow up dunk
Aw yeah, I just got me one
Hanging on the rim til' these pussy niggas want some
Man, I'm lovin dis here
That's why I be hoopin' every day of the year!
I gotta move the ball around
Peep play as we handle these clowns
They ain't even score yet
Ha--ha!  That's a bet
We might blank these rookies, 7-0 skunk on these mark ass pussies

[verse2]
These snitch niggas mad
Cuz I'm hanging on they nothin ass
You hung around my paint too long
So don't get mad cuz you got flushed on
And my goons is wit me
And they gone make sure everything stays lovely!
Heater under the bleachers will put u bitch niggas to rest
If yall decide to test
36 inch leap got these fake niggas sick
And they ain't gone do nothing cuz my click too thick
And that's my word
We kill em so nobody trippin, when I snowbird
We in the game they won't flex on the rim so I pass whole court
Tryna see what i can get in
Maybe one more hanger for the road
To let the other team know
