[Hook]
When will they feel this? 'til they do, my pistol I conceal this
My swag on hustle
And my money on muscle

When will they feel this? 'til they do, my pistol I conceal this
My swag on hustle
And my money on muscle

[Verse 1]
I don't care, I'll leave you smelly
Sleep on the ground with a hole in your belly
A thug poppin' is all you'll hear and see
Next thing you know, you're D-E-A-D
I thought you knew
I thought I told ya
You're dealin' with a thugged out merciless soldier
That will leave you gone
On the concrete
With a hole in ya head
Showin' raw meat
Peep the play, it's how I hit ya head
Before you make it to the hospital they'll pronounce you dead
I'm a southwest goon screamin' fuck the feds
DRHL, heard what I said?
'fore I leave ya, to bleed out
Body scarred, straight open, all the way out
No movement, without a doubt
And no time to send a shot out

[Hook]

Don't think I'm playin', I promise you that I'm not
Cause' it'll be too late when I hit you up with that Glock
When it pop it's somethin' louda than a track gun
Except when mine pop you won't be able to run
I put that on everythang that I love
You'll be left lookin' more peaceful than a dove
You pussy so I leave you sleep like sleeping beauty
Except you won't wake up cause' this ain't no movie
Not by the kiss... of a princess
Not by the shocks... in the ambulance
Either way, you'll be left in a death trance
On a gurney doin the rigamortis dance
'cause that's the only dance, that you don't move
Then do a zero-step, the grim reaper's groove
Now, R I P... RRRRROT IN PEACE
