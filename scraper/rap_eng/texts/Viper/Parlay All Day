(Chorus)
It's gonna be crunk, tight
We're hitting VIP tonight
And I guarantee, you'll remember tonight with me
It's gonna be crunk, tight
We're hitting VIP tonight
And I guarantee, you'll remember tonight with me

(Verse 1)
Imma leave my house at eight
You's a superstar so i'll try not to be late
First we're gonna get a bite to eat
Steak or Ell or some place to skreet
Cause boys already gonna be sick
When bring you in the club thats my clique
I look over cause you look so fine
As we start dinner off with a bottle of wine
We'll ride in my new infiniti truck
Cause I ain't drove it once since I bought it last month
And that club from earlier that you speaked
We can't go there, I did a show there last week
And the girls over there wanna get with me
And I don't wanna see you have to protect yourself for me
Playas, gots a two star plus this other spot is up to par

(Chorus)
It's gonna be crunk, tight
We're hitting VIP tonight
And I guarantee, you'll remember tonight with me
It's gonna be crunk, tight
We're hitting VIP tonight
And I guarantee, you'll remember tonight with me

(Verse 2)
The club will be crunk, off the chain
But stay lowkey so the DJ won't say my name
Cause I would probably throw it all for you
Seeing fifty dollars rushing at your shoe
So imma go in and try to stay silent
Just following and the light streams from my diamonds
Go to the VIP and keep my shit on the low
As i'll order any drink that you've never had before
Oh, you wanna try hypnotic?
Yeah it tastes good, but I don't think you will like it
But if you do, i'll get some pergion
Twelve hundread a pop guarenteed to turn you on
Follow it up with about sixty french bottles of wine
I plan to make sure that you have a great time
And you'll never forget this night
When everything was just right

(Chorus)
It's gonna be crunk, tight
We're hitting VIP tonight
And I guarantee, you'll remember tonight with me
It's gonna be crunk, tight
We're hitting VIP tonight
And I guarantee, you'll remember tonight with me
It's gonna be crunk, tight
We're hitting VIP tonight
And I guarantee, you'll remember tonight with me
It's gonna be crunk, tight
We're hitting VIP tonight
And I guarantee, you'll remember tonight with me
