[Chorus]

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby

[Verse 1]

I ain't trippin on these punks
They ain't gon' do nothin'
Especially when they know
I'll make a move son
With this 44,  in my hand
From the hood these bitch ass
Niggas are dead
I'm locked in this cash game
Peepin' set
As boys are going under
And that's a bet
Females... lovin
The way I put in work
And leave these pussy niggas with they feelings hurt
With me, all the ladies flirt
And leave these dudes with they emotions desert...ed
And that's on the real
While I'm locking all the girls with my G appeal
That's why in they phones
My numba is sealed
Where declarations to freak me are revealed
That's..why..I sit still
Cause the world belongs to me
So I chill

[Chorus]

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby

[Verse 2]
I lock my name, in these boy's bitch
They aggravated lookin'
Like straight tricks
I parlay all day
As time ticks
Straight up G'd up... hitting licks
It's a trip how I make this green
And then break it up like freshly dropped leaves
You boys know
That y'all trash
With no game
On ya lettin' me mash
I keep paypa stackin' like a paypa mill
Then mix it up like Jack and Jill on the hill
For real, I'ma make boys find
Peace of mind
When they fallin' off on they grind
Boys mind, the rules I set
In this game, that keeps 'em in check
It's my job to leave boys wonderin' why
They hustles are garbage
And they ain't fly

[Chorus]

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby

What did I do to deserve this?
I didn't even get one last kiss
From you, oh baby
