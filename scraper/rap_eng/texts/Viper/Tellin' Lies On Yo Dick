[Chorus] x3
Pussy nigga lyin' on yo thang
Claimin' that you hit my main
So I went and fucked your girl
And I'ma keep that pussy in my world

[Verse 1]

Nothin' ass nigga, I heard what you said
Claimin' that you had my main in yo bed
But I already knew
It wasn't real
You ain't got no face like me
Or no skill
But when I heard it on that song
It pissed me off
And I swore to myself
You would pay the cost
You was on the airway straight up frontin'
But guess who in yo main thang straight up stuntin'?
Viper The Rapper, they call me a doll
When I got a lady in my bed I can't fall
They lovin' this thug
'cause I'm sexy and pretty
And to top it off..
My cash is so plenti...ful
I'm lovin' your girls
I fly 'em in and fill 'em up and fly 'em back like a swirl
While you're in the studio, thinkin' you're ballin'
Guess who your main and your side thing callin'?
ME

[Chorus] x3
Pussy nigga lyin' on yo thang
Claimin' that you hit my main
So I went and fucked your girl
And I'ma keep that pussy in my world

[Verse 2]

You shouldn't have lied on your dick
I took it personal
Now peep the hits
I'm doing a  ménage à trois
With your main and side thang
In my car
They lovin' me
'cause I'm a cute young thug
They lovin' me
Because of my mug
Something 'bout the dimple in
The middle of my chin
Lets me in the middle of your girl time and time again
Yeah, you got some cash and fame
In the game
But they both fuck me
'cause I'm cooler than you mane
And to top it off
Your chicks give me that anal
'cause how I ball and floss
But they don't give you that ass
And yet they give it to me
'cause I'm something they can't pass on
So when you think your main
Is out and about
I got your main, your baby mama, and your side in my house
STUPID NIGGA

[Chorus] x3
Pussy nigga lyin' on yo thang
Claimin' that you hit my main
So I went and fucked your girl
And I'ma keep that pussy in my world
