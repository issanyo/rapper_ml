[Chorus]
Just to show I-
Imma throw 50s and Hundreds
Just to show I-
I'm going in the mall stuntin'
Just to show I-
Imma drop 40k on it
Just to show I-
Hear me clowning, money ain't nothing

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't see my having all this bread
Y'all better put a price on my head
I dun lost all value of money because I get so much for doing almost nothing
The cash coming in so easy, If I said how much you'd be hard pressed to believe me
I wake up when I want
Everyday of the week to pick up bank accounts and my royalties
They pay me in US cash and even in Euros, it's got me feeling like an international hero
I'm getting money from countries I ain't even know exist
I'm like mad, how I hit a stain like this
I'm getting stacks so great, I'm getting some and flipping it in real estate
Some in the service company some in products
Got a feeling my meter broke on good luck
Go in good luck I'm stuck and it won't change after even 1 million bucks
It'll still be heavy and roast up
Champagne, a gold chain and a silk brush

[Chorus]
Just to show I-
Imma throw 50s and Hundreds
Just to show I-
I'm going in the mall stuntin'
Just to show I-
Imma drop 40k on it
Just to show I-
Hear me clowning, money ain't nothing

[Verse 2]
I dun won on a major stain
Been had the peice but I might buy another chain
Or I might buy a kilo of 'caine
Break it down into grams and only sell it when it rains
I'm the beast of the money game
Cowards talking: you could never prove the same
With the break I make it's hard to refrain
From acting mad and maternally
Let me tell you all about my day:
From when I get up to down my head I lay
I get up after 12 noon
Waking up to something bad in my bedroom
I always take 'em out to a 5 star
Some place they never ate, with a top bar
Spared no expense, mixed drank until we buzzed
With the lifestyle of a thug, she in love
Back to the mall
Get some things just to prove I can buy it all
Almost dinner time, usually 9 dine in
Yellow pages cuisine, random point, dial it
Corn flip [?] other side [?]
Magic with me so I'm heaped at by haters
Head to the party spot with a chick so bad I just might get shot

[Chorus]
Just to show I-
Imma throw 50s and Hundreds
Just to show I-
I'm going in the mall stuntin'
Just to show I-
Imma drop 40k on it
Just to show I-
Hear me clowning, money ain't nothing
