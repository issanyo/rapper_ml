[Hook]
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' on me

[Verse 1]
Makin' more money than I ever made, this year
Got the hoes up shinin' like a chandelier
When bad chicks see me, I get cheers
And when haters see me they disappear
This my swag that make sure they stay out it
And it my money that make sure they leave rowdy
I dont give a care how I rise
Past the top level cause my cash traumatise
Yeah, sail ships so I keep my mouth shut
Meanwhile you done snitchin' tight
They keep theyself in a rut
As I'm all cashed up, gleaned up
From head to toe
And now your whole team know
This power blanger roll
I'm wrapped in green, I'm a snake in the grass
And it keep haters mugs mean, here's a test
I'm some lifesaver, with just a little work
Hand down to heaven, God bless we got a curse

[Hook]
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' on me

[Verse 2]
Gon' keep it real, in your heart you's a coward
Claimin' that you know, when you ain't got no power
I don't trust you, I think ya jankin'
And when I call your demise, the world might thank me
I close, click, done, makin 6 G's up
I start thuggin', makin' teams freeze up
Finding deep in the club, mall swag stylin'
365 24/7 pro ballin'
I'm guaranteed to win, I got win on lock
While square rappers wearin' pieces shaped like a box
Meanwhile I'm laughing at that thing
As they say I'm the realest with the realest piece an' chain
Thinking to myself "Will my realness ever end?"
But it won't cause when I die later, they'll wake me up again
Money keep comin' hour after hour
I'm street certified to keep you haters lookin' sour

[Hook]
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' on me
