(Hook x2)
Knots
Cash in my pockets
And whats a trip(?)
Can't nobody hawk it
I'm stackin' stackin'
And it ain't stoppin
My packet baggin'
Man I'm clockin'

I'm comin' up real fast
Hittin these licks
I can't pass
So
So I keep my chrome
For boys who wanna baller hate
While i get my cash on
When i hit the bank
It ain't a (?)
These greenbacks that took me
To another zone
I get two knots
In my home
One by the laptop
And one by the phone
Just in case
I gotta leave quick
Two knots in my spot
Won't let me forget
?? two in my sweatpants
And jackers thats hatin'
Dont stand a chance
Cause in the back pocket
Is the heat
And thought its just a .38
The bullet's unique
Hollow points
Have you lookin' funny
They twist you up
Before you get to my money

And it ain't stoppin
My packet baggin'
Man I'm clockin'

I dont give a fuck
I really dont care
These boys ran outta luck
And I know it sucks
When they see a flossa
Come in a (?)
But its cool
Cause they dont test me
They know if they do
Its gonna get messy
So go on and touch me
With your hatred
It makes it easier
To say I made it
Envy
Flowin' within ya
Gonna be the reason
The bullets gon' spin ya
Ask yourself
"Is it worth it?
To lose my life?
Cause a nigga workin.'"
Then ask yourself
"Do I wanna die?
Cause a nigga
Ballin greater than I"
Chill you gon' get your 15 of fame
Only difference is
I'ma be already paid
