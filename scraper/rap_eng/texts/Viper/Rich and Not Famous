[Chorus]
I'm so made
I'm so made
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
And when I'm in that thang
They don't know who I am
Man, this shit is so cool
This shit is so cool

[Verse 1]
Catch me in that drop top
Taking models out your hood
Straight bangin' your block
Boys hollerin', who is that nigga?
He must be a deala, cuz he ain't no rap figa
They partially right, I was in the dope game
Now I'm retired in this thing
Rich as a bitch mane
While you boys workin' J.O.B's
I'm out here every day vacationing
Balling, is all I do
Catch me on the whole court, acting a fool
Dunkin' on your homies - two hand hangas
Goons always with me so don't test or it's danger
Totin' a red flag, but still gots homies that's blue
The way I'm winnin' thinking U.S.A, I love you
Headin' down the mall, buying everything in that bitch
You've got me sayin' is heaven better than this?

[Chorus]
I'm so made
I'm so made
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
And when I'm in that thang
They don't know who I am
Man, this shit is so cool
This shit is so cool

[Verse 2]
Piece and chain, no shirt
Who the fuck is that thug
Yeah, it's that creator of them mean mugs
Clownin' and stuntin' is what I'm known for
Catch me in any spot, lettin' money go
You boys are broke and ya'll won't see none later
Meanwhile I got so much money this shit to me is like paper
What the fuck, I'ma do with all this money?
Model's choosin' like it's stupid man this shit ain't funny
I'm a tall shorty, that make it look easy
15 off the porch if you don't believe me
First I won in the trap, then in the streets
Then in the schoolhouse, then on the beats
Now I'm the top of this game, and doin' everything
From getting top bread, to getting top stangs
And all I know is getting this money
And since you don't know I'm a star you niggas won't take it from me

[Chorus]
I'm so made
I'm so made
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
And when I'm in that thang
They don't know who I am
Man, this shit is so cool
This shit is so cool

[Verse 3]
Step in the club, piece and chain bling
Niggas like damn, he must be an athlete
They partially right, I'm a baller it shows
But you know the best hoopers don't play in the pros
You seen my hoop videos, yeah you seen me clownin'
Still got 20 more years till I hit my prime
6'2", hops like I'm 6'9"
One of many reasons why boys want my shine
I sleep all day, in the club all night
Money everywhere mane, this is the life
Buyin up the bar, man I'm acting a fool
All the bad bitches choosin' up on me and my dudes
I'm rich and not famous, but boys is [?] to hate
These pussies don't know what I got on my plate
But if you look under the table you gon' see that [?]
And me and my g's gon' turn this place [?]

[Chorus]
I'm so made
I'm so made
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
And when I'm in that thang
They don't know who I am
Man, this shit is so cool
This shit is so cool
