[Hook: Viper]
Crazy cash
Sick cash
Tell me, what am I gonna do with all this money?
Stupid cash
Retarded cash
Tell me, what am I gonna do with all this money?
Unnecessary cash
Let it rain cash
Tell me, what am I gonna do with all this money?
So much cash
It's too much cash
Tell me, what am I gonna do with all this money?

[Verse 1: Viper]
Uh-oh
I done went and got wealth
Now these boys wishin' that I was in bad health
Models choosin' up
Like I'm the last man on Earth
Meanwhile, I got these boys feelings hurt
Tall pretty nigga it ain't fair I got it all
Killer hops, with cash to blow up a mall
Life ain't fair for y'all
So just watch me ball
Will you be a hater like folks that wanna see me fall?
I hope they all stall
Just watch my new ride crawl
Holla' at me at the whole court for a hoop call
Bring yo homies even if they can't stand me
Just don't take it personal when I get that grammy

[Verse 2: Viper]
I'm waiting for them to make a new Lambo body style
These niggas riding around the same old body style as '05
How did these nothing rappers get deals and even think they rippin'
No need to answer that cause I'm rich so I ain't trippin'
Getting [?] got me lookin' towards beef
Test this and you'll be cold beef in the streets
I'm a magician when it comes to that pistol play
Make you disappear and reappear dead a different day
Ok
Keep me playin' in this money
You boys broke as a joke
That damn funny
I'm something more than a balla'
Ask around about me and and find out I'm that top malla'
I'm somethin' like a baker
Flippin' pizza bread
And tryin' to keep all of this dough from going to my head
That's a triple rhyme
Did you hear what I said
Don't get high on your own supply
Lesson one of street cred
