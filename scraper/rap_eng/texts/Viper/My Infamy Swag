[Hook] x3
(this right here)
This, is my infamy swag (my infamy swag)
In, this, my infamy swag
Watch, this, my infamy swag (I gotta keep infamy)
Peep, this, my infamy swag (so you won't know who I be)

[Verse1]

It's always me, swangin' through your hood
My infamy swag got me feelin' so good
As I ride, you wonder who I be
Is he a dope boy or celebrity
I stay mallin' chillin in the mix
Meanwhile your clique mad cause I'm hitting all these licks
Our trap game territory bigger than y'alls
And now we infiltrate puttin y'all on fall
I use my profits to live better than kings
You should see the types of hotties that infamy brings
Not to mention my diamonds from all my stings
Makin' cash look easy cause it ain't a thang
To this hustla, these models cling
You should see the way they hold on a G
Tighter than the chains on a swing
So tight, sometimes I wish it was just a fling

[Verse2]

Even though I'm a bachelor for eternity
The girls tell me they'll do anything to marry me
Peep as a thug can't stop his shine
Locked in grind as my loot inclines
I can't stop my cash even if I wanted to
I got accounts that grow no matter what I do
Not just interest, and annual yields
But I'm talking bout paypa that's real in appeal
You know how you feel when you cash a check
That's how I feel two-fo-seven from all this money I get
I'm making non-stop guap, every day
Keepin' stacks on stacks cause I'm straight up paid
Lifetime made cause I can't spend it all
My money like an armored truck, it don't neva stall
So bow down to the emperor
Takin' over your city as it's conqueror
