[Hook: Ice LaBell]
Grindin' well
Thuggin' never fails
Grindin' well
Thuggin' never fails

[Verse 1: Viper]
I'm locked in this thang', no doubt
Ballin' thugged out, is what I'm about
I can't keep cash away
Plenty boys want me gone, and I'm still gettin' paid
Stars [?], and I can't shake 'em
See they do anything, 'cause of my paper
Playa' fo' life, is like a dream
I'm 6'5", carry diamonds in your eyes, watch 'em gleam
Girls wanna smash, holla' from the north, southwest
And east, just to say the least
And I stay fly
Chrome shinin', twenties swingin', iced out as I ride
With my iron, I guess why
That's just how I do, peep out a gangsta who's
Held, up on shine
Thug, that's, stuck on grind

[Hook: Ice LaBell]
Grindin' well
Thuggin' never fails
Grindin' well
Thuggin' never fails

[Verse 2: Viper]
I done told you mane, run up, and got
Done up, sun down, got come up
I put you down real quick
Gotcha in the face, one shot, feel it
Now you dead
Gone from my holder blast open ya' head
Now sleep, holed out in the grave
Ridin' sideline, while the thug play the game
Man it's all gravy
Stay cool from head to toe, no if's, and's, or maybe's
On the up and up, no one does it better
And let truth be told, I'm about my cheddar
I keep big heat, cars, toys
Holdin' out the first time a girl called me "pretty boy"
I'm big ballin', hustlin', mayja for my bank
Playa never fallin', thugs stackin' everyday

[Hook: Ice LaBell]
Grindin' well
Thuggin' never fails
Grindin' well
Thuggin' never fails
Grindin' well
Thuggin' never fails
Grindin' well
Thuggin' never fails
