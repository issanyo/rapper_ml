[[Chorus]]
These boys are cheerin'
I'm hollerin' fuck you pussy nigga I know you scaring (We know!)
What you wanna do?  Nothin'
You only gonna got yourself, to lose (Your life)

You're like these boys are cheerin'
I'm hollerin' fuck you pussy nigga I know you scaring
What you wanna do?  (Nothin')
You only gonna got yourself, to lose
(Your life)

[[/]]


The life, every month, I'm informed
Of new interest earned on my cash, that gives boys harm
All my challengers are defeated there are no exceptions
To live out the duel, they must ask for permission
I intimidate boys hearts and minds
And help them, to disappear in a short time (marks)
I'm so flamboyant, money bought my happiness look how I'm glowin'
Cake holdin' is my theme
Look how it's got these men, fallin' off the scene
I'm a real life gangsta so I'll never die
As these models say it's me, that occupy
They minds, only with me they loose
And they give me they all, as I reduce
These fellows to nothing, I'm shinin' and clownin'
These boys know my name even though I keep em frownin'




[Chorus]




On me, cutie pies exercise, one reward of my cash bein' stuck on rise
In tha grind, I crush boys for infractions
Look mane, catch these marks slippin' before they know what happened
How to defeat me, dudes theorize
But I never lose, so they theories die (ha haaaa)
You can find me winnin' on that gangsta glide
The pretty girls askin' me to take me on a joy ride
I'm the one they want and need so I do as such
This onslaught I put on boys proves to be too much (snitch)
All the ladies call me they present
That's why they keep me, feelin' so pleasant
I'm all they ask for, in they life
It hurts these boys, and chops em up like a knife (cut em up!)
I'm the top of the game
You boys gon' keep comin' up short, even though you retrain (ha haaa)


[Chorus]
