[Hook: Ice LaBell]
I'm bumpin' on them
Twenties
You fellows can't play with me
You can't believe it's coming from the ride of a lady
I'm bumpin' on them
Twenties
You fellows can't play with me
You can't believe it's coming from the ride of a lady

[Verse 1: Viper]
Where the ladies at? Ridin' two hoes
I pull up to the club, I hear a truck pumpin' throat
I hear it as I pull, in the lot of the spot
Thought it was a head, but it was not
When I pump, the bass, shook my rear view
I was drippin', she was makin', a bass monsoon
I hop out my vehicle, and look in her eyes
Two seconds in, more like five
Hours, 'bout to fall in the scene
Peepin' out my '04 Expedition, shiny clean
Ladies, where ya at?
Makin money, lettin' assets stack
Buildin' empires, female sires
Burnin' corporate structures, higher, and fire
That's real, get paid, while I rise
And if it's rainin', catch me out the sky

[Hook: Ice LaBell]
I'm bumpin' on them
Twenties
You fellows can't play with me
You can't believe it's coming from the ride of a lady
I'm bumpin' on them
Twenties
You fellows can't play with me
You can't believe it's coming from the ride of a lady

[Verse 2: Viper]
As I step in the club, yeah I see her, there she go
The same female, that was bumpin' in that low
If she knew, the way, she looks back
If she gets close, time to react
I make her walk around, and sit a bit away
Last night I drank beer, so it's liquor today
I'm parlayin', passin here to catch a clown
While chillin', listenin' to the club sound
I see her from afar, we glance at a distance
I play it cool, 'cause I'm never persistent
Then she gets up, and makes a loop around
Then she sits about 6 feet down
From a balla, I ask about her system she says, "amplify"
How could a girl that fire, have such a tight ride?
She said I was cute, plus I'm rich, so it's on
Where the ladies at? Rollin' with chrome

[Hook: Ice LaBell]
I'm bumpin' on them
Twenties
You fellows can't play with me
You can't believe it's coming from the ride of a lady
I'm bumpin' on them
Twenties
You fellows can't play with me
You can't believe it's coming from the ride of a lady
