[Intro]
I'm staying licks
And hustlin' big
I'm stanging licks
And hustling thick

[Verse 1]
I'm staying licks, then hustling every day
A deep down balla winning every way
Watching out for the haters, I see 'em comin'
When they move in full powered clock running
[?] Like they wanna blast me
But then they see the ice and drive right past me
Riding solo, stepping out of my mind
So much bling as though I get
Hustla gotta switch his eyes
Ride to a six-forty-five
Face pounding, so many gals calling my cell I can't count 'em

[Bridge]

It's like heaven on Earth
Sometimes I think I got it for what it's worth

Oh yeah, I realized she said this is the best

[Hook]

And hustlin' big
I'm stanging licks
And hustling thick

[Verse 2]

[?] This loaf, the rest use imagination
Heavenless, the way I ball
Priceless, like the pain is on the wall
My twenties crawl through the streets
As I rather sound numb I speak this room cause my diamonds [?]
End last, navigator is my key mast
Seat back, head out, and I made her walk out

[Outro]
Ballin'
Deep in the [?]
I'm on a level never felt
Stacking so high make the ozone melt
[?] Factory, that's how it's going down
