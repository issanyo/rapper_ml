Money, checks in my mailbox
Boys can't get it, cuz that there's a stash spot
And that's not all, I got other cash lots:
Banks, my crib, my pockets in fat knots
Money, checks in my mailbox
Boys can't get it, cuz that there's a stash spot
And that's not all, I got other cash lots:
Banks, my crib, my pockets in fat knots

[Verse 1]
A G never slacking
A hustler done got stuck on paper stacking
Making cash, in other words
Came kicking punks to the curb
Always pushing something nice
Always covered in ice
Draped up from head to toe
But when it gets dirty, it's gots to go
Down, in my hood
Im G'd up hustling and it's all good
Shining, in every way
Under my shirt - the three eight-
Ty the boys is trippin
They think that they can catch me slipping
Making sure life of haters ain't fair
It's a trip, got cash everywhere

Money, checks in my mailbox

[Verse 2]
I ain't never gon' stop stacking
As if I'm going insane
That's cuz i got that loot on my brain
It's something about it, got me wanting more and more
And with it i get anything at any store
Motherfuck a price tag money is no object
Long as its fresh enough to break necks
If a nigga act crazy and enough to make his eyes lazy
Hazy is the way my eyes stay because of the di-
Amonds in my piece and chain
Karats in my ear won't help the boys maintain
They composure but i do, as my wealth increases it multiplies by two
Im loving this cheese
And the boys behind the ones be good to me
