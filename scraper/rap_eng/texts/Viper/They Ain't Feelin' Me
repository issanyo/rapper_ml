Lord...
They ain't feelin' me...
It's plain to see...
You dealin' widda G...
Lord...
They ain't feelin' me...
It's plain to see...
You dealin' widda G...

This your only warnin', watch out for the fo-five
And if you fuck up, that's when it will go live
I don't care which nigga will die
For thinkin', that he was so fly
I try to let these boys see reality
But when I split it 'ot it's like they ain't hearin' me
I guess they think I'm jokin' or somethin'
And I'm steadily waitin', for the first nigga frontin'
I don't understand, why they livin' on the ledge
When they know the end result is bullets on they head
But I ain't trippin' Lord...
You'll be smoked, and I burnout turnin' corners slow
Lookin' down at my fo-...
And the last of the gun-smoke
I'm just a G that's ballin'
And, my, cash is, neva' stallin'

[Chorus]

Peep as I roll... and fall through clean
These diamonds got these boys sick, if you know what I mean
As they bling... all in they face
They look so stiff, it's like they starin' in space
They put you in your place when you see 'em up close
Then you know, it belongs to the G with the most...
I'm hated coast-to-coast, and I'm lovin the feelin'
I got these boys agged from the cheese I'm revealin'
You don't wanna be, on the end of a killin'
So nigga play it cool, and keep on chillin'
And don't bring flex...
'fore this mothafuckin 'fo, break ya neck
I'm cut up too, so what is your muscles worth?
You'll be in a casket in that hoe-ass muscle shirt
These boys think they swole, hard for miles
But this eagle put you down like rice in the ground
