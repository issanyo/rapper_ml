It be that baller out the best side
Everything's cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said
It be that baller out the best side
Everything's cool, and everything's alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said

[Verse 1]
It's that slanger, the one you can't get with
The one who hustles is priceless
As I breathe, and don't slip
And these boys want me on the dead tip
..Literally..
But that ain't happening
My cash got me a elated
And it got these boys frustrated
Yeah, I know you're upset, but don't let your anger get you wet
Cause if you cross the line
I won't hesitate to shoot you one time
And catch you in the forehead
And see how much your skull bled
From them hollowpoints..
If you try to take my joints

[Hook]
It be that baller out the best side
Everything cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said
It be that baller out the best side
Everything cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said

[Verse 2]
This is how I do, boys
Lookin' actin' like they scheming on me too
I don't understand why they don't see i'm focused on every plan ..That's devised to break me apart
But I can't lose, you knew that from the start
All the barricades only wastes your time
Cause i'm still stuck on win, on my grind
And can't no-one stop it
Just like the money in my pockets, can't nobody hock it
My hustle is respectable
And my shine is impeccable
My gleam is a spectical
My nine is undetectable
I'm untestable
And your trace is unreflectable

[Hook]
It be that baller out the best side
Everything cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said
It be that baller out the best side
Everything cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said
