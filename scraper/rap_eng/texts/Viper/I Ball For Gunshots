[Hook]
Gunshots...
I ball for...
Gunshots...
I grind for...
Gunshots...
I stay for...
Gunshots

[Verse 1]
You don't wanna hear what's singin'
Gunshots bangin' out...
When you're comin'
And I promise, it's gone get ya runnin'
Gunshots roar out like a lion
We'll get these bitch boys cryin'
They better beware...
I stay prepared
A band of plugs sound out the coil...
If these boys try to get my spoil
The noise gone make 'em think twice about
Tryin' to catch a baller for things he sacrificed...for
So I can't lay down...
I gotta put you on the ground
Real quick like...
As I let these take flight

[Hook]
Gunshots...
I ball for...
Gunshots...
I grind for...
Gunshots...
I savor...
Gunshots

[Verse 2]
If I have to, I'll catch 'em off guard
Sound hit after the bullet, but still go hard
It's like the volume guys
Every time I pop my nine
The power of the heat, the man's respect
And it's fast to put...these boys in check
You might hear it out the Tec
Except these ain't a lec...ture
It's you dyin', muthafucka
And goin' out like a sucka
Naan nigga needed-
Just me and my index get the place heated
And you win...
Gunshots and you use the med
Time for sleepin'
For these stains I was peepin'

[Hook]
Gunshots...
I ball for...
Gunshots...
I grind for...
Gunshots...
I stay for...
Gunshots
