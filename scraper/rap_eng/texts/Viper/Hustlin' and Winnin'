I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls


Yeah it's me...
That down south rida' that u can't be
I'm comin' thru' treatin boys like tricks
And don't really care, cuz, im the lick
I'm tellin you it ain't wise to test
Cuz the nine, neva' lets me get stressed
But if you wanna, come on and get some
And get left stiff, and numb
I'm rollin', in somethin new and clean
While ya lookin up witcha mug on mean
You know I gotta show 'ot
Cuz that's what a balla, all 'abot
Yeah, that how I ride
My pockets on swole, my diamonds blingin' in my eyes
I'm clownin, and I don't really care
So chill, you don't wanna take it there


I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls


I got em sick, mad when they see me rollin'
Aggrevated, at the cash that I'm foldin'
Yeah it was me, stangin' through your hood again
Hittin' all your licks, in the south-west hooligan
A paid baller is the flavor I bring
Mashin' on boys, hittin licks as I sting
Now you know, what's the deal
Now you know, how I chill
Now you know, that I'm real
Now you know, you'll get killed
I'm winnin thats just how it goes
Do us both a favor keep your hatin' on the low
But I ain't trippin if your attitude ain't great
Cuz that theres what gives a G more weight
And I can't lose cuz im already locked in
That's why I'm on top time and time again
I'm top price, kinda like fine wine
So chill, watch as a hood shine

I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
I ball... And I can't fall
A G'd up hustla... That, shot calls
