I wanna have infamy
I wanna be infamous
Droptop porsche no shirt as u wonder who i be
Droptop audi no shirt as u wonder who i be
Droptop lambo no shirt as u wonder who i be
Droptop rari no shirt as u wonder who i be

The ladies tell me life with me is essential
Meanwhile my bill stack game is exponential
My green growin like a field full of pear, trees
My money building up everywhere
These competitors run and bail
It's cold, the way I destroy these males
My paper grind is exclusive and unique
And my grind shine is shiny and sleek
Never lost a battle givin boys defeat they need
They leave the battle disrepspected at the tee
To the pretty girls im they only
Priority that they carry
They care of me as i sit back and recline
Gettin service with unlimited time
My life so easy i never had a ripple
I make ballin lavishly, look so simple

No shirt as u wonder who i be
Droptop audi no shirt as u wonder who i be
Droptop lambo no shirt as u wonder who i be
Droptop rari no shirt as u wonder who i be

All the girls blush when i come in they presence
My swag chicks love, my aura and my escence
I mash enemies with destructive malace
And make them respect my best, of the grind status
To boys im heartless but to girls im mild and meek
One reason why the ladies come and take a peek
Of me in private, and you kno whats gone happen
Im livin a dream, as my pockets fatten
And thats why every womens passion is to be in my life
My cash climb is fast
Meanwhile i keep these males livin in the past
Peep play, i make boys never neglect
To wonder how this game would be if i wasn't in it
Cuz in the infamy game im the livin never miss
Since i got infamy it ain't been the same since
