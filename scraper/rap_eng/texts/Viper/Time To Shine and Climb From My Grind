[Chorus] x2

Now, it's time
For, me, to shine
And, time to climb
From, my grind

[Verse 1]

It's amazing, how, I'm comin' up
While these other boys, sittin', in a slump
I'm paypa chasin', while, they steady slippin'
I'm rollin' through your hood solo, ain't set trippin'
Ain't worried about flex, callin' boys 'ot
But they scared, 'cause they know I got clout
I'm G'd up from head to toe, let the truth be told
Ice blingin', sittin' in that white gold
In a clean big body, I be rollin' through
While boys jealous, wantin' to smoke a troop
But they know they cain't, and they cain't take it
I see it in they eyes, man they frustrated
I'm just a balla, that's lovin' this
Maybe that's why I seen ya wavin' ya fist
But no body-language can stop it
My money risin' while my stock steady hoppin'

[Verse 2]

I'm tryna do thangs large, like they dream about
Big cash, big clothes, big cars, big house
While sayin' thangs that make niggas pout
And still maintain, without a doubt
Kind of like the way, my navigation screen
Keeps me chopped up in the scene
I'm just a balla, that's u-nique
Rollin', in back streets
Playin', parlayin', and havin' a good time
While my car spinnin', creatin' a bright shine
Night or day, tha colors from my diamonds
Keep revolvin' like it's a rainbow ya climbin'
My money roll packed with fifties and twenties
While bustas wonderin', how can they get me?
But they cain't, 'cause I stay on the move
And if they try, they mama singin' the blues

[Chorus]
