[Chorus]
Get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up

[Verse 1]
I had to come through and let you know it be
It's stead-ee V - I - P - E
Vipe - a, catching boys slipping
Deep in the game while haters steady tripping
All these boys suspect, dropping mix tapes
I'm dropping real albums like ?? drop grapes
What's up partner, you see a G on his grind
I know you hating, watch me drop the duece one time
And I ain't even tripping because I'm deep in the game
Stars call me boyfriend, I done forgot their name
Got three right now, about to hit 1 - 8
Two hitting it tonight and one I'm hitting later
And that's what I'm hitting
And I'm patient because all of the dimes I'm splitting
Superstars and models
That's when I roll, I don't mash the throttle

[Chorus]
Get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up

[Verse 2]
Ever seen a G
Stepped in the spot and have stars at his knees
And you ain't know who it be
Til you hit VIP, and seen it was V - I - P - E - R
It's gravy being a rap star
Especially when you want to knows how to ball
Except it's hard to find hookers when you're dunking on a model
Cars looking for a spot constantly on move
Gotta like the way you're moving to the groove
Do it baby girl, gone and work it for your boy
Let me get in the pants, it's like a brand new toy
I'm like a kid in a candy shop
These stars are looking in for my lollipop
And when I step out
They running up on me like I done got shot

[Chorus]
Get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
Get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
