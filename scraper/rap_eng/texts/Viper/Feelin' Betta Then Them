My swag lookin' lovely
I done got rich, ain't no one above me
I'm getting cash I thought I'd never win
On the cool, it's got me feeling better than them
My swag lookin' lovely
I done got rich, ain't no one above me
I'm getting cash I thought I'd never win
On the cool, it's got me feeling better than them

[Verse 1]
All the ladies fall in love with me, 'cause I got that money and that energy
Check out the grind, of a cash winner
In war I crush comp and leave 'em having a fit
Then they see and realize they can't beat me then they split
Every day my daily activities be poppin'
'Cause my money got me left with unlimited options
With me, the models act banished
And the hustlas that I got keep my enemies famished
I ain't never lost a contention if I ain't told ya
And cutie pies keep me posted up in enclosures
I position in the broads, and to me they yield
Throwin untamed respect to the realest in the field
Undisputed in all contests, and I remain
The number one shiner of the game

My swag lookin' lovely

I'm getting cash I thought I'd never win
On the cool, it's got me feeling better than them

[Verse 2]
I got no vulnerability for comp to stand
So they lost, scramblin' for a battle plan
As I keep em, battled and brittle
Refusin to let em shine, not even a little
I'm the one and only, the commodity that escapes
And if I'm challenged to a duel, best believe I'm there
Chumps are jealous of my shine with me they're made to fall out
While stacks I keep getting so they know what I'm about
In the fight, I leave combatants incoherent
Mama said not to test I get on 'em like they swearin
I win every match by blowout,  no need to score it
My specs are powerful enough to knock the moon off orbit
Big cash is known by me, and for defeat from me, there's no remedy
Big cribs, cash and cars is all I keep in my world
Other than all these super bad girls
