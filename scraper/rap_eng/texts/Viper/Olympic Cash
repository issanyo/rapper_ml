Who do I love
More than me
Who do I warm
More than me

If you ain't know I'm the man with the power
One day I looked in the mirror for 24 hours
Just to see if I could do it with a face like this
When I look in the mirror, sometimes it gives me chills
How the fuck could a young nigga be this real


Could it be all this money I made I ain't gotta do nothin it just flies to my bank
All I do is parlay while the world spins around
Meanwhile my bank account jumpin up like a clown
It's got a nigga wonderin' what I did to get so blessed
