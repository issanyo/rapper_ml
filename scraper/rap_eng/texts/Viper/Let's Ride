(Chorus)
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!

(Verse 1)
In this macking game i'm too cold
The way i'm winning on these boys got my head swole
From these dimes, I get pull
These gals strangers to each other and they got my car full
I'm on a new plateau with so many gals around me, some I don't even know
Thirty six gals, six alaskan, senior high
Ten black, ten asian, eight latin, eight white
When I pick them up from school, they look good what they wearing
They hop in my car, while stupid niggas staring
I'm coming up fast
Locking up these models, with all this cash
Man, my life potent
My win game off the chain, I keep an unreal quotion
And you lockers can't make it cease
It'll never go down only increase

(Chorus)
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!

(Verse 2)
How many times they just post me up?
Lock me down in my spot so I can't get up
But when we go out it's whatever they want to do
Movies, fine cuisine sometimes the two
Find they asses no boundries
It's like they my bodyguards the way they surround me
And they start texting me when I come home
They hit me so much shit gets stuck in my phone
Cause, where we go it's whatever
Rain, sleet, snow it don't matter the weather
And sometimes when it's dark, they take me to go parlay at the park
Folks see it and they wonder what's going on
Then they see it's me and they just move on
That's everyday in my life
Nothing going wrong everything going right


(Chorus)
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
Me and you, let's ride baby girl!
