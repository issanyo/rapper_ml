I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes

[Verse 1]
My piece and chain got these boys in check
I see blank faces when they see whats hanging from my neck
And I know deep down they wanna smoke a baller
Cuz they know I'm a cash hauler
I done stang
And got these boys sick
From what swings
And shines from underneath my dome
The brightness put you boys mind all wrong
Im stacking cash places you'll never see
Its put away in places you wanna be
The beauty of my jewelry makes haters smile melt
And I'm hidden in a zone, that they never felt
I got you wishing I was never born
Cuz the steam from my shine brings the mind home
Too bad, I'm here to stay
Increasing these dollars everyday

[Hook]
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes

[Verse 2]
My shine emplied by my green glow
Cuz I mash and green show
My pockets fat, pullin twenties
And when it comes to cash, i got plenty
I'm making many dollars in this thing
My money looking lovely like my piece that hangs
Down from my mug
And makes these boys wanna put me down with a slug
But i ain't worried bout ya cuz the cash coming in
And it's freezing on me like a light wind
Im balling these boys can't stand it
No hesitation, you'll get smoked if you demand it
These boys can't manage
It's like they calling out for death to be granted
Its like you tired of living
And if you fuck with this sleep will be given

[Hook]
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
I like the way my diamonds shine
It's a sight for my eyes
