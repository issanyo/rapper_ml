[Chorus]
I am sorry for the way that I've been treating you
You've been so good to me and I have been so cruel to you
I know I'm not the person you expected me to be
I still care for you
I still want a life with you
That's true
Only to you can I be faithful
So I say sorry
I hope that you can understand (and I say sorry)
I promise you from now I'll change
I just want you to know that I care

[Verse]
Now I'm God's favorite
Does he seriously see me walkin' on the pavement
I don't know why he love me so much
But he gave me his exclusive touch
He told me I'm his number one G
He told me he in love with me
He constantly asking me to hold me
Can I hold my number one in the W-O-R-L-D
I come and let him fuck with me
Just cause he so crazy 'bout Lee
He straight loves me, a little less than his main gal
And tell me constantly that I'm his main pal
Which means he keep it 100 giving me
Cash to be stuntin'
He said he gonna keep me made and then clutch my soul
So I say, on the double G, God gangster's bro
He say there only two things he want me to remember:
That's Easter, and the 25th of December
And get ready for some fun cause at the end
He said he's sitting me next to his son
