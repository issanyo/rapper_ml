I bring the drama like Osama, a suicide bomber
I fuck your baby momma treat your kids to Benihana's
She like Pocahantas, braids to her ass and
I be pulling that, from the back, when im mashin'
Back to the class inn, one on one assasin, Desert Eagle blastin'
Did we get them mashin', fuck the pussy ass-in
I know where they massin', I pull up on me jet bike
And give y'em whole headlight, right back, light back
The traffic doing dumb-shit, snitches like to sing
Bullets like to hum bitch, come and get your some shit
I give em' out for free and I be shooting from the bass line
Trying to hit the three


I bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em'
Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em'
All in his beemer, you want em then' we assen em'
Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women

I got that bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em'
Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em'
All in his beemer, you want em' then we assen em'
Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women


I got the cop killin' billies in my shit loaded quick
40-cal. toys for you niggers talkin' shit
And I can make you run like Reggie
Coz I be popping hoes' to the dough's in your chevvy
And no I won't bite you, fight you or scratch you
Catch you on that way way, let them boys snatch you, been meaning to get at you
Where you been pimpin', I got some hot shit that be poppin' out and chippin'
You know them boys fishin' and guess who comin' with me
And I be slippin' shit in your ball -stones and kidneys
Smokin' with the hippies, everything is drifty
And ill be in the bank if you wanna' come and get me, come and get me

I bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em'
Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em'
All in his beemer, you want em then' we assen em'
Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women


I got that bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em'
Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em'
All in his beemer, you want em then' we assen em'
Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women


H-ane, block game, know we like the cop thing
Squak things, pop things, all up on the block man
I tell you off top man it ain't about the boogie

'its about the boogie and ill motherfucking show her'

I am tryin' to be patient, patience is a virtue
You play with my emotions, you gon' make me hurt you
Ill show you what the girder do, put you on a shirt or two
Stick my helmets on you and I bet you they gon' murk you
You know you got that work too
Supersofa squirt you, boy you just abandoned motherfucker i can purp you
You can keep this merk too, and bullets they gon search you
Show you what that suit, and that gasket and that church do


I bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em'
Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em'
All in his beemer, you want em then' we assen em'
Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women

I bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em'
Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em', all in his beemer
You want em then' we assen em', like corners with rinem
Run in em' just like women
