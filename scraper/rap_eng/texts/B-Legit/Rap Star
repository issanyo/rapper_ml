[B-Legit]
True worldwide player, got the game on lock
Spendin' money, flippin' drops like I still slang rocks
Still hit the blocks, light blunts when I swerve
I do the speed limit cause I'm twisted and perved
Hoes got the nerve, to turn they head and switch
Like they didn't see me comin' in that big black 6'
Bitch please, I hit the horn when I pass
Got the homie out the window tryin' to rub on yo' ass
Now peep the S-Class, Rolex Platinum
And now you wanna come with the question askin'
Do I ballplay? Yeah I play for the Jets
Hillside, with money like Kevin Garnett
Now can I get it wet? She say it's drippin' with juice
And what I gotta do to ride the V-1-deuce?
Sit yo' ass on my leather, and rub on my wood
See we got notches in Cali, plus that pussy be good

Bitch I'm a motherfuckin' rap star
Gorilla milk, B-La blunts and the caviar
Bitch I'm a motherfuckin' rap star

[Lil' Bruce]
I tell a bitch I ain't got no motherfuckin' money and laugh like it's funny
Poppin' my Movado, sittin' low in a Eldorado, sippin' on a bottle
Pimp drunk 'til the sun come up, sleep behind Denny's on Sunset
Sweatin' bitches about my money cause the album ain't done yet
Bitch I'm a motherfuckin' rap star, get the fuck away from my car
And hell nah you can't hit this weed, bitch walk 'til your ankles bleed
Put the paper in my pocket please, she love the way I pop my P's
I love the way she knock them G's like slangin' rocks in '83
I'm a pimp slash rapper like my cousin Mac the Most, slap a ho like me
And never talk for free, nigga can't you see?
It's for the money and the fame, and I see my money comin'
With the vice on her ass in her high heels comin' around the corner runnin'
I ain't trippin', I'm so cool, I'll pop the trunk of the Northstar
And the bitch jump in and I'll sip my gin and smash off like a rap star
(Bitch I'm a motherfuckin' rap star, Lil' Bruce in a '99 Northstar)

Bitch I'm a turf boy, we don't fuck at the house
I'm to the cover suites, to put this dick in your mouth
I'm on my paper route, can you contribute to that?
And if not, can you send your homegirl for a sack?
The "Highest Niggas In The Industry", Smoke-A-Lot with Yuk'
Bossalini, you see me, I gives a fuck
Stick 'em til they stuck, when the crap game starts
I was told to have money, have heart
I'm puttin' houses on the hill worth a million or more
Marble on the floor with the french wood doors
I flipped a old school, and still slang that
Got the guns in the trunk, you don't want no funk
I'm on a money mission, slangin' verse for verse
Some premeditated and the others rehearsed
I got the thirst, so bring it on like Sprite
And we can make some shit tonight, beotch
