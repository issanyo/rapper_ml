[Chorus: E-40]
Tally up, rally up, get ‘em
Fuck them niggas, they in cahoots with ‘em
Guilty by association
Them niggas guilty by association
Tally up, rally up, get ‘em
Fuck them niggas, they in cahoots with ‘em
Guilty by affiliation
Them niggas guilty by affiliation

[Verse 1: E-40]
Uh, guilty by association
It take a patient to catch a patient
They’ll do it in front of po-po’s station
Give a fuck about how many years they facing
Some of them come from broken homes
Some from foster care and group homes
Grew up without a father, it’s sad
Ain’t no uncles—see, an uncle is like a second dad
When I talk to ‘em, they get mad
I try to tell these little bastards but these little bastards bad
Some rack to get their status up, they pimp
Nowadays if you ain’t on drugs then you’s a simp
Same concept in their videos and songs
Can’t do a visual without guns
Powder, ‘phetamines, and lean
Dog food and everything in between

[Chorus: E-40]
Tally up, rally up, get ‘em
Fuck them niggas, they in cahoots with ‘em
Guilty by association
Them niggas guilty by association
Tally up, rally up, get ‘em
Fuck them niggas, they in cahoots with ‘em
Guilty by affiliation
Them niggas guilty by affiliation

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
Guilty by affiliation
My little nigga home, he on fed probation
25 what they got him facing
Another strike and it’s life, nigga, no escape (yeah)
Ants in his pants, wanna move around
I told him ‘fore he do, I wanna sit him down
I told him watch his homies, man, them niggas clowns
Be blowin’ up the spot, they don’t want you ‘round (nah)
Gave it to him straight, I don’t think he heard me
‘Cause he was on the block about 7:30
Heard it from a birdy he was back dirty
A bunch of Oxy pills with the number 30, yeah
Plus he sippin’ on that boy again
Seen him mix it on the Facebook—oh, it’s him
Got them people tattle-tellin’ like, “Oh, it’s him”
And them goons on your line wanna get your skin

[Chorus: E-40]
Tally up, rally up, get ‘em
Fuck them niggas, they in cahoots with ‘em
Guilty by association
Them niggas guilty by association
Tally up, rally up, get ‘em
Fuck them niggas, they in cahoots with ‘em
Guilty by affiliation
Them niggas guilty by affiliation

[Verse 3: E-40 + B-Legit]
He having his bread, he having his wealth
But he eatin’ at the table by himself
People say that he don’t look out for his niggas
But his niggas be trickin’ off on them bitches
Keep putting milk on your porch and I’ll bet you that
Keep feeding cats and they gon’ keep coming back
You try to teach ‘em how to fish but they know it all, that’s for certain
You think that you helpin’ ‘em, but really you hurtin’ ‘em
The 12 blue bluffin’ ‘em, they young and they rich
I get it: fast car with the bad ass bitch
I get it: weed card, and probably a zip
Plus you in California, so you figure legit
But what if, swine pull you over and he know your name
Search your backseat, plant the cocaine
Snatch you out the whip, put you in restrain
And say he lets you go, you give him four names

[Chorus: E-40]
Tally up, rally up, get ‘em
Fuck them niggas, they in cahoots with ‘em
Guilty by association
Them niggas guilty by association
Tally up, rally up, get ‘em
Fuck them niggas, they in cahoots with ‘em
Guilty by affiliation
Them niggas guilty by affiliation
