[Intro: ProHoeZak]
Move your head back back back back
Lean it to the side (lean it to the side)
Lean it to the side (yeah)
Tell me if you’re high (I’m high)
Move your head back back back back
Lean it to the side (lean it to the side)
Lean it to the side (yeah)
Tell me if you’re high (I’m high)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Block talk from the jaw, woodgrain in my paw
Car drippy like a spa, oughta be against the law
Baddest bitch I ever saw (ever saw)
Suck a ball through a straw, make you run up in her raw
Bust big cole slaw (cole slaw)
Big stack in her bra, got her shape from her mom
Scratch a ho with her claw (with her claw)
Work at Jamba Juice at the mall
My VS hittin’ (yeah), diamonds giggin’ (uh)
Not Foster Farm but I’m having chicken (yeah)
Got muscle on the streets and I’ve been to prison
If you spook me, you gon’ come up missin’
Born to fail, but I’m anointed
Run up on me and get disappointed
Got 30 in the clip like a half-an-hour
Blowin’ on a pack of leprechaun flowers

[Chorus: ProHoeZak + (E-40)]
Everywhere I go (everywhere, mayne)
I stay high
I stay high, all the time
Even when I’m blowed (even when I’m blowed, mayne)
I stay high
I stay high, all the time (BIATCH!)

[Verse 2: B-Legit + (E-40)]
Fuck it, I’ma hit, pick it up tonight
Everybody know B-la light bright
Damn near white, really don’t matter the hype
Long as she servin’ it right
Brand new bike, Rolie on the way
‘Bout to get away down to Half Moon Bay
What I’m tryna say, fuck with the kid
Promise, little mama, you gon’ wish you did (Talk to ‘em)
Yeah, thing about B, I be really on (really on)
Cartiers on, I be in the zone (in the zone)
Probably on the phone tryin’ to get a bag (get a bag)
With the LS2 in the deuce rag (deuce rag)
I be runnin’ drag (runnin’ drag), Bruce Jenner (Bruce Jenner)
Tell her anything when I’m runnin’ in her (runnin’ in her)
Probably fuck again little after dinner (after dinner)
Let he know she a winner right before I spend her (BIATCH!)

[Chorus: ProHoeZak + (E-40)]
Everywhere I go (everywhere, mayne)
I stay high
I stay high, all the time
Even when I’m blowed (even when I’m blowed, mayne)
I stay high
I stay high, all the time (UGH!)

[Verse 3: E-40 + B-Legit]
Woop woop, I don’t owe nan nigga, I’m recouped couped
If I beat your ass in a fight, don’t shoot (don’t shoot)
Your bitch wanna blow me like a flute (BIATCH!)
I’m smokin’ on the vapor, I’m breaded up like a baker
Treat a Mercedes just like a Buick LeSabre
Friends think I’m crazy, think I’ma wife her and save her
All up in the Kool-Aid without no flavor
Bad attitude with a slick talk (slick talk)
You can feel it in the floor when the chick walk (chick walk)
Ice in the bezel of the wristwatch (wristwatch)
Bag cherry red like lip gloss (lip gloss)
Stay pissed off (pissed off), irritated (irritated)
Think you’ll feel better if you medicated
Or even if you try a little meditation (meditation)
And focus on me and on this paper chasin’ (paper chasin')

[Chorus: ProHoeZak + (E-40)]
Everywhere I go (BIATCH!)
I stay high (that’s right)
I stay high, all the time
Even when I’m blowed (even when I’m blowed, mayne)
I stay high (I stay high)
I stay high, all the time (all the time)

[E-40]
Let me that, bruh (yeah)
Let me hit that shit
