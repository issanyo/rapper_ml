[Intro: B-Legit & E-40]
What's up, fool? I got like about three bucks on the Rossi
Let's go get perved
You don't wanna get perved, nigga
You don't wanna fuck with this Rossi shit, fool
(Man, don't forget the ice, man)
Oh, you want something too, fool? Okay

Top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi, Carlo Rossi

[Verse 1: E-40]
Top of the line wine Carlo Rossi Rhine
I drinks it all the time, it's hecksa satisfying
Three of four times a day you can catch me drivin'
Back and forth to the liquor store buyin'
Jugs and jugs of the shit because I'm addicted with no denying
Pervin', swervin', runnin' all into the fuckin' curb and
If I get one more D.U.I. then it's curtains
I can't call it, I guess I'm an alcoholic, sometimes I hit the chronic
It's just like gin and tonic when it's time to get erotic
5.99 for a big ass bottle of Rossi Rhine, it's right on time
Once you become a member of my drinkin' club, you will find
The key to set you free so give it a try
But don't mistake it for Chablis unless you're already high
Spread the word get sprung and drink it with your down cronies
That's another word for sahobs, potnas, folks, homies
Hell muthafuckin' yeah
We do this shit every other fuckin' day if not every day
But anyway, I want

[Chorus]
Perkin' off some of that top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi

[Verse 2: B-Legit + (E-40)]
Hocus muthafuckin' Pocus
The top of the line wine, yeah, nigga, that's the dopest
And if you in The Click, them motherfuckers notice
That we be downin' jugs from the tallest to the shortest
Everywhere I go, people wants to know
What's the name of that shit you and the Click be like fuckin' wit'?
I keeps it on the hush, 'cause brother I be perved
Fuckin' with some shit that will send you to the curb
And if you with a bitch, then nigga you nice
Cause Rossi goes good with some dank over ice
Take her to the telly, let the wine fill her belly
Fired up some smelly then you jam her like jelly
Bust a couple of nuts, hit the butt and then the grill
Dick hard like I did time up in Vacaville
But still I be bossy (What you fuckin' with, though?)
Fuckin' with some of that top of the line wine (Yeah, nigga)
Carlo Rossi

[Chorus]
Perkin' off some of that top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi
Perkin' off some of that top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi
Perkin' off some of that top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi, Carlo Rossi

[Verse 3: E-40]
Sunny day, sky blue, shit, I think I'ma barbecue
Let me get my ass up outta bed and call up the whole motherfuckin' crew
Ray, you bring the chicken; Kaveo, you bring the links
Mugzy, you bring the hamburger meat, and I'll supply the
Drinks
Shit, it's fixin' to be on dammit
I got Suga-T in the house whippin' up some potato salad
Four slabs of ribs up in the refrigerator marinatin'
Bring on the biz, I got the munchies and I can't be waitin'
Well, what do you know, through the door comes Kaveo (you know)
Mugzy and Tap Dat Ass, T-Pup and hella more
Big ass niggas like B-Legit and E-Deuce
.... Mac Shawn, Mac D-Shot and Little Bruce
The man behind the counter of the liquor store loves me
Be dang near ready to hug me
On the strength that I done spend
Over a G within a week off the Carlo Rossi
