Where me and the homeboys ya know?
We get together you know what I'm sayin?
We might uh, shoot some pool, play a little dominoes
Call a few tenders over

I kick it in the Bay
You know where I stay
The V A to the Double L
The homey flossin in the V-12
So when you comin' to kick with it
With the Sick Wid It
You bring the whole team
When you hit magazine
Like the other day a car low from E-P-A
Came through with some Hennesey and Alize
I'm on the corner gettin' burnt with the chili mac
They hit the block in a dark blue ville 'lac
Wassup wit y'all?
Nuthin, tryin' to get it jumpin'
And it's the first can we go to the mall or sumthin'?
I got to laughin' but now I was pimp the baby(?)
Lookin' like she want to tongue kiss my Mercedes
I got a spot where we all can go kick it at
We got the bomb and y'all got the Cognac
Don't even trip I got a click and I want you to meet 'em
Once we make this left we to the Hemp Museum

Chorus:
Grab your sex and your beach
Hit some corners let's get keyed
The Hemp Museum
The Hemp Museum
Got my drank and my blunt
Check that bullshit don't be no punk
The Hemp Museum
The Hemp Museum

I'm sittin' real low tip toen' the block
I watch they mouth drop as I hit the lot
Now peep the plot
The gates open up slowly got they eyes on it
Spotizotic 'cuz I spent the M5 on it
You ladies help y'all self and pour the do it fluid
While I break down the pound and manicure it
Al Greens with the Victor Barons got her starin'
Tryin to get her out here Donna Karan
Uh...I'm callin all top notches
Homies with the rolex
Watches slide through
Like the thing to do
We're all players
No square be allowed in the house of hemp
We campaigns like the President
I got four or five dank rooms
Big screens with playstations
Wet bar, perculation
A vacation?
No, more like the Mardi Gras
With hurricanes and thangs that you ain't ever saw

Chorus:
Grab your sex and your beach
Hit some corners let's get keyed
The Hemp Museum
The Hemp Museum
Got my drank and my blunt
Check that bullshit don't be no punk
The Hemp Museum
The Hemp Museum

I'm seeing 'stangs in the game of the young stages
But I'm a hog like the pig on Momma day
Proked out today was a good day
A baby Freaknik jumped off in the bay
I told baby maybe later on we can chill
And we can meet at the Denny's up at ???ville
But as for now your playa patna gettin' hot
And a quarter mile runners linin' up at the light
They gettin' tight and I got G's off in the Nova
A big block and I'm hot
I'm trynna told ya
Mini mart turned side show
Tear 'em off no need for the nitro
I'm known to give it from the gate like every time
Make the 6-8 skip and walk the line
I got a dime in the pink if you down to see it
And we be posted at the Hemp Museum

Chorus:
X2
Grab your sex and your beach
Hit some corners let's get keyed
The Hemp Museum
The Hemp Museum
Got my drank and my blunt
Check that bullshit don't be no punk
The Hemp Museum
The Hemp Museum
