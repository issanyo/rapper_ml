[Intro]
Mob shit bitch

[Verse 1]
Now I be known as what they call a savage
You gotta give it to me when it comes to wearin' carets
Game is on this chain like they don't wanna wear it
But you don't want the problems baby girl, I swear it
Now, if I'm your favorite rapper, then you musta been in it
Either push it or you shove it, when you get it, you spend it
I'm a nigga so I love it and I tell you to hit it
Ask the snowman he know man, tell you let's get it
In northern California, white girls they blow
Hit the track where the tricks at, you know they get dough
So I tell 'em "let's go, for sure we get mo"
Hop in girlfriend while I mob the fo-doe
Bitches outta state love the game I display
See they know I'm from the Bay and Bay boys don't play
You can say what you say and do what you do
But this game that I can pay they never came from you
Let's get this money

[Chorus]
Come, fly
Let's get this M-O-N-E-Y (bitch, let's get this money)
Girl, fly
Let's get this M-O-N-E-Y
Bitch I'm tryna get this money
Come, fly
Let's get the M-O-N-E-Y
Bitch get the money
Girl, fly
Let's get this, let's get this

[Verse 2]
Know this chick up at Def Jam that won't leave me alone
Ever since I took her home and fucked her off the Patron
I'm a boss who set if off, ballin' like Jim Jones
Only nigga [?] but get naked with Tim's on
See I'm in the friend zone, so friends I bone
Them others get the dividends, I leave 'em alone
Or I lead 'em to Stone, he lead 'em to tracks
Strips and Cadillacs, bitch you fuckin' with macks
Went and flipped me a hog, nigga gave it the [?]
Courtesy of my nigga once I got him his fee
See there's rules that we live by out in these streets
Like never leave home without that thing we keep
[?] I keep a brick in the trunk
See I'm tryna build a house it might take me some months
You know a nigga sick when his pockets got mumps
Instead he blowin' blunt after blunt after blunt
Let's get this money

[Chorus]
Girl, fly
Let's get this M-O-N-E-Y (bitch, let's get this money)
Girl, fly
Let's get this M-O-N-E-Y
Bitch I'm tryna get the money
Girl, fly
Let's get this M-O-N-E-Y
Let's get the money
Girl, fly
Let's get the M-O-N-E-Y
Girl, fly
Let's get the M-O-N-E-Y
Girl, fly
Let's get the M-O-N-E-Y
Girl, fly
Let's get the M-O-N-E-Y
