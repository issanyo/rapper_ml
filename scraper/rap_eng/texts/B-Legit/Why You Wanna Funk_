Intro: (*some dred woman*)

Dere's no time for dem future
Come short wit me 9 milimeter
Body beater, doesn't pick up
Fully automatic collar point beater, uhh
*repeat*

[Verse 1]
[Spice 1]
Unload the whole fuckin' clip and break down a nigga body
Don't think I'm bad, no boxing, no karate
Just a down ass nigga that you think you know
What you don't know is that I'd like to see you die real slow
So pull that motherfucker out and you'll be buried somewhere
S-P-I-C-E-1, a nigga's worst nightmare
I set the game from the killers I knew back in the past
And I'm tellin' you if you fuck with me it's a slug for your ass

[E-40]
Ain't no more ballin' up your fistes
'Cause niggas be actin like bitches
Pull a strap and don't use it, nigga that ain't smart
I know some niggas that'll take that kind of shit to heart
Like me, bring it back e'rybody die
Spread fireworks make it look just like the 4th July
Have his head, leave it laminated on the shelf
Even though I'd rather do the shit by myself

[Chorus: Marcus Gore]
Why you wanna funk when you ain't gotta chance
Don't make me have to make that call, aah-aah
Why you wanna go and pull a strap up out'cha pants
When you know you ain't gon' shoot at all, no no

[Verse 2]
[D-Shot]
Things are kinda cruel on the streets
Shit, ain't nobody really tried to fade me
But it seems nobody wants to fuck with me
Why is that? I had no sudden enemies
I got rid of every last motherfucker
For the simple fact I can't trust a
Nathan in this motherfuckin' outfit
You come my way, sorry, ya have to die, bitch

[B-Legit]
I make em lay down, I gotta playground full of hardhead
Beanie-capped, Triple FAT Goose wearin'
Wanna catch me loose starin' at a barrel
Chances get narrow when I'm maskless
Bare-faced, finna blast this
Enemy provider, fool, I'm a ridah wit a driver
Keep the Uzi clip switched on slider
Neither you or crew that you pumpin'
Wanna see the big dog about nuthin'

[Suga T]
Flow-a-matic automatic nigga to my 9
Paper chasin, I'm heavy on the mine
Every now and then a nut feels a bit dainty
Hoes by the dozens, they really can't stand me
Swing my way you get your dome sprayed
Nina Ross done fucked around and became my best friend
Every now and then I yell "Get the urge to floss!"
Like every now and then I yell "Call my daddy 'Boss'!"

[Chorus: Marcus Gore]
Why you wanna funk when you ain't gotta chance
Don't make me have to make that call, aah-aah
Why you wanna go and pull a strap up out'cha pants
When you know you ain't gon' shoot at all, no no

[Verse 3]
[E-40]
M and H, money over hoes
Mustard and mayonnaise, Zeniths, spokes and Vogues
Go on a rampage, beanie, smokes and clothes
Drunk as the funk, Wild Irish Rose
Graveyard, dope track, nigga, might as well
Put in some overtime, make that scrilla, get some mail
Late night, greedy gut, major clientele
Money-hungry, same draw, same rapper will

[Spice 1]
Blaow! Biddy-bye-bye-bye-bye S-P-I-I-I
Love to do a d-d-d-drive-b-b-by
Reach out, reach out and touch a motherfucker
With my nickel plated chrome, have you foaming at the mouth
When I fill your ass to the rim like brim
I got slugs for you, one for you and one for all of them
How could you play me like a bitch; I ain't no sucker
I put slugs in nigga's arms, chests, legs, motherfucker

[Chorus: Marcus Gore]
Why you wanna funk when you ain't gotta chance
Don't make me have to make that call, aah-aah
Why you wanna go and pull a strap up out'cha pants
When you know you ain't gon' shoot at all, no no

Why you wanna go and pull a strap up out'cha pants
When you know you that you ain't gon' shoot
Why you wanna go and pull a strap up out'cha pants
When you know you that you ain't gon' shoot
