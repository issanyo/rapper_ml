[Verse 1]
Shit gets funky in the deuce
They wanna catch a nigga like Legitimate loose
I keep a sprayer, player, and that’s on the gooch
‘Cause niggas nowadays be missin’ on a fluke
It's Legit, bitch, and yeah, I’m down
Strikin’ like a match, mayne, back to the town
Thinkin’ of the days when I was grindin’ in slums
Hillside, Cali, mayne, servin’ ‘em love
And $19.50 wasn’t getting you shit
You needed 20 bucks to fuck with a hit
You never seen a big nigga run so fast
Four white men in a van yell “task”
On that ass but I’m out
And nigga I doubt if the one-times could find my route
Runnin’ through the creek splish-splashin’
I hit the picket fences, threw my stash in
Two par nine and eleven be hatin’ her
Nigga like Legit, ‘cause shit, I’ll be shakin’ her
Roll it one time for the green, you know what I mean?
It’s just my daily routine

[Verse 2]
I’m a danksta, right? The gangsta type
To mob on Rally’s with the gangsta whites
Beanie cap fouls with my mug on mean
And cleaner than a nigga ridin’ Vogues and zeens
Vogues out low ‘cause Legit rides slow
Full of the dank but I can do that, though
I scope the whole block and then I bump the sounds
By-nines hittin’ like 15’s now
Homies give it up when I’m seen on site
I might give it back or just show I’m tight
Stopped at the light like the car’s in park
I slap it low and let the Cut’ dog bark
I'm outta there, man, and left the homies sprung
Plus the doobie I was smoking was burning my thumb
With that, I’m out, and off the scene
And back to the track, mayne, ‘cause it’s a daily routine

[Verse 3]
Early morning call for the wake
I gotta get dressed, and go and cop a cake
My beeper going off about a thousand times straight
The brothas buying O’s on the block can’t wait
So I’m on the mix, and bringing it back
Hard white solid good A-1 yack
Comin’ through slammin’ at your porch side
I was even droppin’ D in the northside
So ask any pigeon ‘cause I’m sure he's heard
The Click crew niggas was servin’ them birds
Rollin’ on the cuts with the boom blam boom
And taking y'all bitches to the motel room
Or either at the condo with the Kenwood loud
And smoking more dank than the law would allow
The bitches did the dishes and washed the clothes
We even had the hoes who shined up Vogues
Mobbed around town like a candidate
I even got danked on the Interstate
Whatever it takes to make or stack me some green
I was wit’ it, mayne, ‘cause it’s my daily routine
