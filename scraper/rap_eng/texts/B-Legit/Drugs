[Verse 1: E-40]
This thang all the way mobbed out
This thang beatin' the trunk loose
I'm on a big ass bottle of Goose and some Ocean Spray cranberry juice
And I strongly suggest that you don't sit in my transportation
Cause the slap is so severe, and the beats excruciating
My amps my pop your ear, and possibly collapse yo lung
What color is your exterior? The same as grey poupon
What is you a baller? Yeah but not Lebron
Then what kind of baller are you? The kind that sell heron
The kind that lives his life illegal, tote a gun and desert eagle
Mobster like Bugsy Siegel, I listen to 40 music
Don't fuck with too many people mane most of them rappers fake
See Feezy be speaking on some shit that I can relate
When I was in the shoe his CDs is what got me through
My nigga from Nebraska put me up on dude, uhh
The grit don't quit and my hustle'll never pause
UH OH! Here come the law I got dope in my draws
BEATCH!

[Hook: x2]
We be grinding seven days a week, heat under the front seat
Been to hella corners in my new school, one deep
Every hood I'm in I get love from the plug
And I probably sold your family member drugs (drugs)

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
How much money can a man make?
I'm on the block cooking chickens with the pancakes
And my fan base love to get high with me
Get tipsy prolly slip they own self a micky
Get em Vicky
B-le, he be militant
Send the whole fifty clip through ya ligaments
Got a knot, pocket full of them Benjamin's
Move bricks like I'm try'na build a pyramid
Shit
40 Glock with the laser dot
And I can make mash potatoes outta tater tots
Action talk and I don't really like to talk alot
Block move like James, Wade and Chris Bosh
Let's get it, I'm the real boss with the plug
I don't play I'm the nigga man I run the club
Keep it rough I'm in there doing hella stuff
Pass puff and they smell it when I light it up
Nigga what?

[Hook: x2]
We be grinding seven days a week, heat under the front seat
Bendin hella corners in my new school, one deep
Every hood I'm in I get love from the plug
And I probably sold your family member drugs (drugs)

[Verse 3: E-40]
What you do for a living a little bit of this a little bit of that
If I ain't got it I know where to get it or I can take you to where it's at
I can probably get'chu a deal, get'cha thirty percent off the sack
Depending on how many you want, and how much dough that a hustler got
Fuckin' right now y'all beefing, then circling yo block
Came to the right place, I got chops fresh out the box
Can have a fools erased, if you want me too I can
But I gotta be honest with'chu it's goin cost you twenty grand
And I been with the gumbo pot too, I was taught by the best, Raul
See Raul been the neighborhood iron chef since 1982
Raul stay clockin' loot, the boys in blue ain't gotta clue
Raul ain't never popped, caught with a spoon or residue
Well what about some weed you got it? I beg your pardon
I gotta hella connections my Negro my people they got gardens
Need a fake ID or benefit card, times is hard
You know Christmas is coming up, I got them gift cards
