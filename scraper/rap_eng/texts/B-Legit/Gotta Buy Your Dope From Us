[Little Bruce:]
I got Now and Laters, bubblegum, and sour candies
With a trunk load of cookies like Amos 'n' Andy
Got the plug from Hershey and Mr. M&M's
And me and Willy Wonka is old school friends
It's the American dream
On the triple beam
Little Bruce got the bomb-ass cookies and cream
And I'm serving more kids than Chuck E. Cheese
And a German chocolate cake'll cost you 16 Gs

[B-Legit:]
It's the big time deala
Sucka side killa
Real about the fetti
No Ben baby
Got a truckload ready for the Hillside ride
Bombay all the way from the Bay we slide
Through your hood
Getting off our goods
Fiending for a knot
We put it in the box
We got a brand new batch
And we put in the smash
Better get it 'cause we selling out fast

[Hook:]
You gotta buy dope from us
You gotta buy dope from us
You gotta buy dope from us
If you wanna ball please
If you wanna stack Gs
You gotta buy dope from us
If you wanna ball please
If you wanna stack Gs
You gotta buy dope from us

[B-Legit:]
I got variety packs
Hit so fat
And that's platinum status
I'ma let you have it
Zone for a little bit or nothin' at all
I'm going wholesale
I needs mail from all

[C-Bo:]
Suitcase full of G's
400SC
It's the candy man with all the cream
I put the candy on the triple beam
The ziplock baggies
Distribute to the nation to have your whole crew cavvy
Now fools want to blast me because I'm ballin'
Cause got more cream than 31 flavors at Baskin Robbins
Slanging thangs for 16, 9 for half
Got ya flying to the Westside to double up your cash

[Little Bruce:]
I'm playing chase with the FEDS
And got the DAs pissed
They raided my spot
Shot both my pits
While I was in Atlanta smokin Swisher Sweets lounging
Counting hundred thousands in the Lexus clowning

[Hook]

[Answering Machine:]
What's happening?
You reached Sick Wid It / Jive
Leave your name and number at tone
I'll get right back at you
*Playa, we at the All-Star Game in San Antonio
You and Bruce meet us here and don't to forget the thang*

[Little Bruce:]
I hit the All-Star Game with a thang my backpack
Ain't on no train, we riding '96 Cadillac
The Northstar system on 100 spoke Daytons
I smokes big with Rider and Gary Payton
Behind the back door where ballers be livin'
Transactions on nationwide television

[C-Bo:]
I'm down to make G's
Slanging straight cream
In the land of milk and honey
On a mission about the money
Breaking down in quarters
Saran wrappin' across the border
In my 500 Benz behind the '96 Explorer

[B-Legit:]
I pull the keys out my pocket
And I started to G
Bo-Loc back seat strapped down with heat
Track after track
Unit after unit
Running straight through it
It ain't nothing to it
It's kind of like being sprung out on ducks
And when you buy dope you gotta buy it from us

[Hook]
