(*E-40*)

Huh! Rockin an rollin, like the car was stolen
On my way to see my weebles up in deep east Oakland
Smokin on some premo, in a clean ass, coke white El Camino
Dual exhaust sparkin
Park it like Reno, I ain't soft I see some hoes in Moschino
Lookin like they wanna get tossed
E-40 you be careful 'fo I tell one of yo biggest fans
Do what you do all I listen to is you Maxwell, and Erykah Badu

(*Richie Rich*)

When I was off on caviars, dalmation spotted
Niggas spoke on me like I wasn't nobody
Foolish as a youngsta I packed eightballs
Broke the ice, an often sold weed to stars
But hey now an they how I run my sweet
Yay Deep from the lungs to expose my heat
Like my nigga 40 waters an Legit wit the B
Niggas know fuck tha cuttie wit the triple gold beam

(*B-Leigt*)

Niggas from the Bay be so damn vicious
Fly to Atlanta fuck Morehouse bitches
It ain't no swishers, juss zigs, an zags ho
Super bad bitches turn regular tracks hoes
We mack hoes, then sell 'em a dream
From here to California have 'em holdin my cream
I'm on a winnin team, off heen an begals
Make 'em drink 'fo a bitch nigga pay me

(Chorus)

We slide, we slide, from south to west we ride. (x4)

(*Richie Rich*)

Now slip, slip slidin, rip, rip ridin
I hurt a mutha fucka when I bang westside
See this side be the smokes bliss side
Not the if, if was a fifth side

(*B-Legit*)

Well pass it to me, pass back to you
Hit the light green til I turn dark blue, I'm through
Need not to do what I do
Yay Deep only fuck wit a few

(*E-40*)

But if I hit rock bottom an lose everythang
I come back up, pimp, pawn my weddin ring
Re-up, re-cop buy some yeyo
Auction my shit off nigga give 'em rum an zale
BEEATCH!!!

(chorus x4)

(*B-Legit*)

I'm Yay Deep, come an talk sleep, el g, in this old jeep
Out slangin by the oak tree
You know me the homie wit the big O dub's
An everytime you see me I be blowin it up
I'm from the land of the weed dealaz
Heat killaz
Heat feel the half fo the scratch nigga fuck that
Bounce back an make you bubble
Long as you don't double yo dribble
Campaign wit the swift hoes

(*E-40*)

I went from a, ten speed wit a backpack
To a, six-seven coupe left wit a luggage rack
To a 400 SEL
To a fresh off the show room floor V-12
I'm a timin ass tycoon from Magazine
I remember when my shit wasn't always clean
Rappin niggas, an hustlin that's my bread an butta
You niggas betta hurry up cuz there's money in this mutha fucka!!!

(*Richie Rich*)

Cuz I take morphine fate, cuz I serve mo fiends
Fuck wit bitches duct-tapes to crates
Richie be the ballin bitch if ya snooze ya lose
Ride hoes like vogues, switch up like tennis shoes
Bitches gettin one mo chance to suck dick
Hataz who be waivin they hands, duck quick
We buck shit
Yo gift be the four-fifth
Tough niggas play sweet, park we Yay Deep

(chorus x4)

BIAAAATCH!! Fo sho! 40 waters, B-Legit an Double R, we ride
Southwest, riders, southwest riders man, you know what we do
E-feeze-fozereeze, wit Z-Savage, that nigga, Double R, Double R in the
House we ride, Richie Rich, we ride, seven-o-seven, seven-o-shnebin
Enough

(chorus x4) Sik Wit It
