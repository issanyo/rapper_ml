[Intro]
E-40, B-Legit still mobbin’ (Still mobbin’)
Johnny Versace on the muhfuckin’ slap and what have you
It’s 2-thou-wow-15, you feel me?
We still movin’ mean (Come on, mayne)
You know, rappin’ like we 17 (Like we Seven-muthafuckin’-teen)
You know, gassin’ everything, feel me? Yeah

[Verse 1: E-40]
I’ve been smoking all day, and drinking all night
In the studio spittin’ bars on the mic
Some shit that you need to hear, some shit that you like
And I’mma rock this muthafucka ‘til the broad daylight
I woke up feeling woozy, last night was a movie
Didn’t take a shower, I was fresh out the coochie
A hundred bucks an hour what I make every day (Where at?)
On the boulevard with a bundle of yay (OK)

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
I’ve been drinking all night, red eye flight
Touchdown, move around, I’mma be alright
Cheddar boy named Mike got it lock in the D
He be trappin’ out the strip club, movin’ the tree
You know little Monique and her niece Denise?
Got a nigga from the cast for his Rolex piece
I’mma need me a piece and a microphone
And a lot of provolone, I be movin’ the stones

[Hook]
Heavy in the game (In the game)
I be pushin’ them thangs (Them thangs)
She wanna attach to my name ‘cause I’m heavy in the game
(In the game) Big gun, big chain (Big chain)
And a four-finger ring ‘cause I’m heavy in the game
(In the game) All my niggas be the same (Be the same)
Yeah, we all gettin’ change, so clean, no stain (No stain)
Either Benz or the Range (Or the Range)
Backseat gettin’ brain, bitch, I’m heavy in the game

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Hand in the cookie jar, one on the 40
In the spot where we kizzop, me and E-40
Know a not’ with a green dot’ll do shit for me
A condo in her name on some new shit, homie
I be in on the business, whippin’ this artform
Niggas turn cop without a badge and uniform
Believe in them unicorns, them goons is comin’
The spot’ll get rocked when the G wop somethin’

[Verse 4: E-40]
In the trap zone on my TracFone throwaway
So them people can’t zero in on the things that I say
Throw off emphasis what a true hustler specialize in
(What about the game?) Don’t ever the play the game if you ain’t playing to win
(Don’t do it) Don’t you lighten up, my nigga, mash
Get it while it’s good, my nigga, get your fuckin’ cash
I was built for this, the shoe fit so I wear it
(What you was doin’?) I was pushin’ birds when Big Bird was a parrot

[Hook]
Heavy in the game (In the game)

Backseat gettin’ brain, bitch, I’m heavy in the game

[Verse 5: E-40 + B-Legit]
We be bangin’ E-40, be slappin’ his music, me and my vatos
Shit that he be saying be over they head like a shower nozzle
Lame ass muthafuckers, man, blew he bitch goggle
And we ain’t from the Bay, we from Denver, Colorado
Got a auto full throttle with the bottles of the ESS
Hopped out in a drought like we so West
I mean, we so fresh, you could smell the green
And we do it for the whole damn team
Always finish what you start, never be a mark
Be ‘bout it or shut the fuck up, put your tongue in park
Don’t be woofin’, they’ll leave your head on the rug
Niggas be bluffin’, selling more tickets than StubHub
You selling them tickets, never kick it in public
I’m a boy, I thug it, make a move like ‘fuck it’
I’m a one-man Army with a gun machine
Put a hole in your muthafuckin’ Robin jeans

[Hook]
Heavy in the game (In the game)
