Hold up..

It's the motherfuckin Corruptor!
Since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggas brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let em hang To the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, It's for survival
In the intestines of the city, cause the game's shitty
And Piggly Wiggly on the payroll, So they can't bust us
And we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers

[Bun B]
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin
I go, cold loco lay em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin
Why why why? (It's the Corruptor's execution)

(It's the Corruptor's execution)

I be workin and twerkin
My portable digital triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter!
(Teeter-totter!) Kind of like a see-saw, up and down (up and down!)
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that there soft white
Baby powder, equals a quarter pound
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, "Who's sack is dat?"
All the tiffles and po'po' (and what happened) I got it back
(BITCH!) Don't make me do ya (don't make me do ya..)
I know these streets, like the Gracies know jujitsu

I'm havin small change, with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main (ball main) with thangs, I let em hang
It ain't at all strange (at all strange) with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' (guns smokin') leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken (words spoken) put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hoppin' (block hoppin) not to choke up in ?
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that

Now we get the cash the stash and bash your brains
All over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in fast foreward
Now BRRRR stick em I kick em, Bobby you lick em
We stole em and brick em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick em, bitches is breathin
They last motherfuckin, breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby deal with the talk
You backin the guns and all the law
So just hopin these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure ? don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then
