So much mail I can hardly spend it
VS lumps in my rolex pendent
Shit been spending for the past ten years
Face done escaped all tatooed tears
I guess I can only thank the Lord for that
'Cuz shit was gettin' hectice tryin' to get my scratch
If it wasn't them one time penelopes
It was coward ass niggas tryin' to take my G's
When I first started out I was broke as a bitch
Grew up in the slums wouldn't trade it for shit
'Cuz the niggas that was rich when I was poor
Is now on blow and comin' through buyin fat 2-0
See they spend it with me
But pretendin' to be
On the grind
Tryin' to get a stack like mine
But now I'm knowin'
Pockets growin'
And when it's snowin'
???????
Yo' nigga can't lie I was livin' it up
The rule of big pimpin' now my '70 Cut'
I probably hit the park drinkin on Bo's berry
Slammin' Rick James 'cuz I'm in love with Mary
You can't be scary if you want your scrill
Pack you steel
Nigga kill at will
Guard your grille
'Cuz if you real
Then it's on
I'm talkin' so long

Oh so long making my revi's

So many playas comin' up in the game
And everybody got a sack of rock cocaine
Mobb car drivin'
Condo livin'
And every fuckin' day was just like Thanksgiving
The city where I'm from is getting so damn cold
Niggas outta control
At 16 years old
Them young muthafuckas ain't givin' a fuck
They tryin' to get a buck
And get some hair on their nuts
The savage ass grind starting takin' my mind
A nigga came through with all new tec-9's
Semi-automatic with extended clips
A chopper every nigga down with my click
Neighborhood funkin'
Mail's on slow
It's barely comin' through
And all I'm sellin is O's
I ride high performance when it gets like this
Electric everything, racing cam and kits
I'm livin' on the edge but I'm lovin' the high
I'm either goin' down or I'm goin' die
Hot ones echo through the geto limp
Put the tip out the window let the AK spit
They just caught my homey with a pound of crack
Plus the other day they said he robbed a bank
A million dollar bail in his Uncle's own
All charges got dropped cuz it's oh so long

Oh so long making my revi's

My Momma must have prayed real hard for me
'Cuz I woke up in the mornin' wasn't slanging no D
I was on my way out to the church to see
If the Lord could find a better way today for B
Read me some scriptures
Fed my soul
And I'll tell you like this I ain't slangin' no more
Your boys been blessed in so many ways
In the night and in the day and in His name I pray
Thanks for the Lexus, jewels, and home
Even though I can't take 'em with me when I'm gone
But Heaven is the place for Legitimate B
So when You come and get Your folks You comin' for me

X4
Oh so long making my revi's
