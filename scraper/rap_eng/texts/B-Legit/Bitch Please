[Hook: Big Scoob]
I been sellin' dope since the tenth grade
Nothin' but gritters over this way
Walkin' up, talkin' that shit, hey
Me and my niggas like "Bitch please"
I been sellin' dope since the tenth grade
Nothin' but gritters over this way
Walkin' up, talkin' that shit, hey
Me and my niggas like "Bitch please"

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I ain't gang bangin' I'm a gang member
Love for my Blood and the rest get the middle finger
You can get the trigger finger
Funny actin' pussy nigga, fraud
You ain't hard, play the part
You can get it nigga
Old head, long bread, chillin' and I'm sittin' back
Feet up, livin' good really and I'm kickin' back
Orchestrate to gettin' back, button pushin' pigeon pack
Stuffin' up the duffel with the hustle, nigga gimme that
Naw really give me that
Greed time, gettin' fat
Multiply the paperbacks
Gorilla I'm a silverback
My mama cut the Similac
With hot sauce and bacon fat
Really don't know how to act
Started, I'ma finish, nigga remember that

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
I be out a lot, probably on the block (on the block)
We runnin' from the cops, runnin' into knots (into knots)
I put it in the pot, then I put the whop (yeah)
Foam and let it lock, then I lock the spot
Like welcome to my neighborhood (neighborhood)
Got cookies and the flavor good (flavor good)
Put Gelato in my Backwood (yeah)
Keep a banger when it's that good (that good)
Watch ya hangin' if ya that hood (that hood)

[Bridge 1: B-Legit]
My bro he on the roof with a sixteen
Choppa in the bushes with a red beam
You done ran off with the wrong dope
Mini 14 got a long throat

[Verse 3: E-40]
Started off with a pinch, hoppin' over the fence
Garbage cans and dog shit, albino piss
Yola up in my fist, toaster up on my hip
Bringin' home the bacon, and the cheese and grits
Sometime my paper saggy, sometime my yaper crisp
Takin' a stab at this rappin', selling dope a hit and miss
Grew up on the tar
Pluck you like guitar
I be high as fuck, tryna touch the stars

[Bridge 2: E-40]
Franck Muller on my right, Rolex on my left
I don't like to fight, I just like sex
Hustler all my life, popo like to raid
I been gettin' paid, since the tenth grade (Biatch)
