Tanji, I snatched her up at a house party
Her appearance was quite lovely
I wanted to get plugged with old baby
So I told my older cousin to introduce me
She did that indeed
She said Tanji
Tanjii this is  E
E?  You mean E-40 from The V?
I said yeah, she said glad to meet you E
I said obliged, glad to meet you too
She said right
So tell what’s up with you?
I said nathan
How bout some steak and wine and an autograph?
I scratched the top of my head and then I started to laugh
Let’s scoot to my spot, in what?
My Cutlass Supreme drop, where’s that?
Outside in the parking lot, let’s scat
We’ll be there with a jiffy, now sit back
Dag nammit I ain't taking no crap
She said man baby is it like that?
I love for a man to take control, over 250 gallon and bold
She kissed me and then continued down the road
Stay tuned for the next episode

I'm outta here, peace
