[Intro: WC]
Hallway on the beat
Hallway on the beat
Sound like a gang of elephants in the trunk around this motherfucker
Somebody let them motherfuckers out
What's happenin'?
What's happenin' with it?
Chicken Hill
Motherfucker
I see ya'll

[Verse 1: WC]
Hustle all day
Leaving hater sauteed
Down on my knees, shootin' dice in the hallway
Yeah nigga, time to turn the noise up
Play time is over, pick them motherfuckin' toys up
Here come a savage, I'm grabbin' my hammer and shatter em'
Crackin' all the lenses in your paparazzi cameras
That O.E. 4-0, with a stagger
Bald headed Ingle motherfucker with no manners
Skip skippin' and grippin' the full clip
I'm firing up that good again and
Ya'll bullshittin' in it
Fuck a love rap, where them dubs at?
I'm a thug, grind to the tops with bird tucked in my buttcrack
From South Central to Northern Cali
I galley through the alley with the gamblers
Hard crack scramblers
Who got the game sealed?
Niggas better say Chicken Hill
Move back, we 'bout to pop like pills

[Hook: C Plus]
We just ridin', ridin'
And smokin'
Through Northern, Central, Southern California
West Coastin'
I keep my pistol tucked
When the hoes show up and make the G's come out
So we can party all night til' they kickin' us out
Then we take a couple bad bitches back to the crib
Excuse me, that's just how we live

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
Street nigga, slap a sucka with my left hand
And I don't peel em' tall, speakin' on the next man
And yeah ma, I can be your pussy's best friend
Hit you from the back, fuck you til' you can't stand
I like a pretty face, long hair, pretty feet
And good grief, baby look good enough to eat
I got her boyfriend jealous and the girl geeked
The bitch can't breathe, nigga, let her off the leash
I'm a beast and fuck g's, I'll split your onion
Hollow tips go zips, if you hear em' hummin'
Cinnabon on the bottom of the tommy-gunnin'
And that'll have a nigga runnin' like a lil woman
I'm where it's sunny and the money like to grow on trees
I'm talkin' Cookies with the Kush and the purple leaves
I could get em' where you at if they need to be
And you could holler at the Chicken if you lookin' for me

[Hook: C Plus]
We just ridin', ridin'
And smokin'
Through Northern, Central, Southern California
West Coastin'
I keep my pistol tucked
When the hoes show up and make the G's come out
So we can party all night til' they kickin' us out
Then we take a couple bad bitches back to the crib
Excuse me, that's just how we live

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I am
A sicko, psycho, is so, nitro
Schizo, tight flow, pistol, tyco
High speed, I need, a little bit of that light green
Might seem, venomous, movie and a dinner shit
Grrr, I'm an animal, a cannibal
And when I come to Chicken, they cook meat for mannibal
Yeah, and I drop heat with stamina, rammin' her
Butcher knife, all up in your famila
Grrr, just caught a case
Now I'm on a murder spree and scrapin' off your face
Then I put your face on, face off, face it
Rock it through the woods like Jason
Face lifts
Like a space ship
Millennium
I'm talkin' Darth Vader and I bake it and rape it
Let me slow it down and I'm smokin' one more pound
And I'm huggin' on the ground

[Hook X4: C Plus]
We just ridin', ridin'
And smokin'
Through Northern, Central, Southern California
West Coastin'
I keep my pistol tucked
When the hoes show up and make the G's come out
So we can party all night til' they kickin' us out
Then we take a couple bad bitches back to the crib
Excuse me, that's just how we live

[Outro: WC]
Dub Cizzle
A.K.A skip skip all about the skrill
Fuckin' with Chicken Hill
That's right
Can't nobody fuck with Chicken Hill
Dub Cizzle
Das mee nil
Hallway on the beat
Fuckin' up the concrete
What's happenin' with it?
What's up?
What it do and all that other bullshit niggas be hollerin'
Motherfucker, you know what it do
Chicken Hill is what it do
Right here
Beat your ass black and blue motherfucker
What's happenin'?
Bitch ass motherfucker
Ya'll can't fuck with Chicken Hill
