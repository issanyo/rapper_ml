We taping.....
What it is...what it is...what it is
Ooh...bitch

[Hook x2: B-Legit]
We ain't in love with no money, the money love us
Cross country with this pimpin' on a tour bus
Up in Florida or in Georgia
Bitches love us, they adore us

[E-40]
Bitches (What) Greasies (What)
Hoes (What) Groupies (What)
Hoochies (What) Sluts (What)

[B-Legit]
What can they do, the pimpin' love us

[E-40]
Housekeepers, game thievers
Pop goes the pop pop pop pop
Heat misers, chest tuckers
High siders, game providers bitch

[B-Legit]
But they don't run from it they run to it
They knew it, I'm so true to it when I do it
I pursue it, cash it, I auction you off
Highest bidder get to hit her, bitch break mine off

[D-Shot]
Ha, and now I'm on the freeway
Perkin' like a motherfucker just got paid
Another night, rollin' like a playa do
Comin' through, gettin' my revenue

[B-Legit]
Sick to stomach when I do to a bitch, so don't trip
Thirteen hundred all up in her ass, that's where they fit
I run shit, the Sic-Wid-It dumb shit
Ya know I need that big bank roll bitch
I'm undercover, pop ya collar fo' the dollar
If ya hoes need a sponsor then bitch holla
I won't stop ya, I'll fit ya ass with a skirt
I'll make ya bring back the dirty work

[D-Shot]
We stopped into a place, a Louisville, Kentucky
I went to a gambling boat and lost all my money
I put my last five on the black
On the roulette tables, I broke ten right back

[Suga T]
I'm the best kept secret, mark it fucks up
But I won't get stuck
Keep a broad full of tricks
And my underground niggas do rock us
What you think, blinkity-blink
You act like yo shit don't stink
Hoodrat town, that bitch Suga T gotta come see me
Who you think you is
Hope ya don't think I won't pull the trigger
I fucks with some bigger figures
The Click you'll never get rid of
I'm a bad bitch, flip the script you a trick
On some boss shit worldwide ghetto bitch

[Hook: Suga T]
We ain't in love with the money, money love us
Cross country with this pimpin' on a tour bus
Up in Georgia or in Florida
Cincinnati the niggas love us

[E-40]
I be like all up in the Bank of America
About to regurgutate, talkin' criz-azy
Smellin' like beer
Makin' a deposit, large lump sums
Cussin' out the cashier
For comin' at me wrong, bitch I'm federal
I might get more than the man
In my hand, I stay with a cup
Some of my fans like again they life up
2000 Bentley on the dubs, on the car
Light brown Excursion, sport utility truck
You lil' miss scuzzies better open ya eyes and take a look
And keep em' open for my dictionary book
I spit a slang, a bang nigga, nigga
Full of straight game nigga

[Hook: B-Legit x2]
We ain't in love with no money, the money love us
Cross country with this pimpin' on a tour bus
Up in Florida or in Georgia
Bitches love us, they adore us
