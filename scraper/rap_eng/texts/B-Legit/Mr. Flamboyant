[E-40 talking]
(Yes!) Yeah, it's that old mackin' fast
Old school gangsta style, smokin' dank Cognac lounge beat
Cognac lounge beat, motherfucker
Cognac lounge beat, mother-motherfucker
Yeah, this that old mackin' fast
Old school gangsta style, smokin' dank Cognac lounge beat
Mr. Flamboyant, motherfucker
M-m-Mr. Flamboyant, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
As a youngster, I never knew nathin'
That disobedient ass child in the neighborhood
You know, the one the police was always chasin'
Straight down and dirty for my props
Eleven years old, extra mannish, hard-headed shinin' rocks
I killed a powerful ass motherfucker no size to it, it was hella bigger than me
Prettiest thing I ever seen, a 1979 AR-15
Clean, fully automatic and the whole killer kit
It's hard for me walkin' up and down the street, folks be pointin' they fingers talkin' about "Partner got a grip"
Actually, what I was doin' was protectin' my people’s million dollar spot
It was my duty, I got paid to guard the whole motherfuckin' block
Try to catch me if you can now that I'm a grown man tho
The mail I got stashed away, people’ll never know
Mr. Flamboyant

(Gangster voice: I came in here on business
I-I-I came in here on business
It could work out pretty good
It could work out pretty good)

[B-Legit talking]
Yeah, pertainin' to this bein' a dog ass world and all
A brother need some kind of occupation to make his mail stand tall
Whether it's slangin' ‘em or whatever ya do, mayne
Just make sure you true to the game

[Verse 2]
Still in the game, everything pretty much the same
Tryin' to reach a certain goal but I gotta ditch that there metro
Alcohol and Tobacco Bureau, Feds and the DEA
Yeah, just to run up on me when I'm off that there Grand Marnier
Well what if they blast you and slap yo’ ass in the truck
Potna, if if was a fifth all of us would be drunk
Don't even like watchin’ B trip off petty punk shit like that
What is you sayin’, bruh? They might be talkin' about how he’s killed the back
Meanwhile, pussy was comin' around the corner on two shoes, I mean wheels
Scattin’ in the ‘76 Cutlass Oldsmobile (motherfucker!)
Turnin' 360's like he was an Alaskan mobile (motherfucker!)
Sittin' on gold ones high-flamin' and didn't really know the deal (Motherfucker! Mr. Flamboyant)
I said, "What the fuck wrong with you, you crazy ass motherfucker?"
Partner back there tried to mean mug me and turn two tight ones like I was a sucker
Well, slow ya lil' ass down this here side of town
Before you find yourself melted or either beat down

[B-Legit talking]
Like that, and that's on the gooch, my brother
Because nowadays a dollar comes harder than a motherfucker
So if you out in that world don't get caught up or be slippin’
‘Cause today's society ain't trippin'

(Sly Stone: Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Gangster voice: There's a fortune in this business
There's a-there's a fortune in this business)

[Verse 3]
Mr. Flamboyant, yeah, that just might be yo’ name
The center of attention, money, fame (Mr. Flamboyant)
Fuckin' with a bitch’s brain, a player, insane
Leader of the squad, much younger, a gang
See he throws the whole unit in a big ass gumbo pot
Foam, stir, let it settle and then make it lock
You can like righteously tell a real swing when it’s by the smell, spark the overkill
Five underground tapes but pertainin' to the triple beam scale
Solid as rock, white, white, white, A-1 good yola
None of that ol’ scandalous ass cakin' with baking soda
Whether you know it or not, this here's a dog’s game
You gotta watch ya back and play it well
Way too many brothers gettin’ took for large lump sums of mail
You can't be frail and don't be light in ya lil’ narrow ass
Gain some weight, drink beer with potatoes and gravy, it’s not too late
Become a savage, get swole but once, 20-inch arms establish
One-hitter quitters, the whole get down, now run up on me now

[B-Legit talking]
Uh, E, why you come at ‘em like that, mayne?
You know they can't understand that shit
When you doin' about a buck-fifty, mayne
But now, put that shit in perspective for ‘em though

[E-40 talking]
Ay, check this out my sahobs
Due to the fact that I am at liberty
To release such valuable information towards the public
Ya know what I'm sayin'
Every one of my last sahobs been like hollerin' at me
Demandin' that I define the definition of Mr. Flamboyant
Pertainin' to me havin' inherited the gift to spit
So I had to like let loose

[B-Legit talking]
Like that
Well ya know the shit is good listenin', mayne
But now I want you to go back to that tune that you was doin' earlier in the song
You know that lil' tune ya was doin'

[E-40 talking]
Ah, you mean this here:
Yeah, I'm just a hustler on the go
Out here gettin' my proppers don't ya know
I'm livin' kinda comfortable, large mail and all
And a lot of jealous fellas would love to see me fall
