[Verse 1]
Two times two equals four doors
On an old school Chevy ridin' on Vogues
Windows up, 'tac getting stuck
Ice cold Rossi in my Quik Stop cup
Little Bruce is extra manish
I'll punch it sideways and grandmama can't stand it
Smoke 'em up at the Springs Road stop sign
And then I spin 'em by the church about two more times
Hoes hella scared, me and Mac Shawn laughing
That's when the 6-7 Cougar starts blasting
It was burnt orange with the black canvas top
I goes for my Glock, I didn't have to pop
'Cause it was K-1 getting dumb with the Israel-
Made chopper with the cooler for the real deal
Funk Mobb funk put together by a gangster
Frank Nitti done possessed this youngster
It's all good, I'll pass the dank
Then I'll slap my kit in low to make my new Vogues stank

[Hook 2X]
Mobbin' in my old school
Smashing like a straight fool
Ain't trippin' on no police
'Cause you know I'm down for the high speeds

[Verse 2]
I'm a nappy headed singer with the smoker's choke
'Cause I'm addicted to the doja smoke
I bought half a hill, forever got kill
Now do you wanna smoke with me?
The kush is in season, got your cousin steezin'
To fire up the Humboldt County greens
I'm tacked out, so don't roll my windows down
So high I gotsta put the blunt down
Have ya lit, put the wax kit on my clear
On my quarter-panel, no, you won't sit there
You'll be slidin' and I'm glidin'
And all the hoochies at the school wanna ride in
The love boat and smoke some dope
I pulls to the curb and says 'What's up, hoe?'
Only seventeen but looked way older
Hopped in my mob like she seen the rollers
I let her hit the dope and now she know the time
Poured herself a cup of that Rossi wine
A straight super bad with a barbed wire cut
And now you wanna know is I'mma tap these guts

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Triple gold Zeens with the straight laced wires
Doobies in the ashtray starting a fire
Leather insides plush to kill
Funk Mobb mobbin' through the Millersville
Six 15's with the Zapco hook
I bought my Colossus from Nanny the Crook
My cousin Darren slammed the horns under the back seat
The Alpine pull-out makes it complete
Gold with the silver base and hella coats of clear
Coke white top with the peanut butter interior
Pinstripes and mode is to catch the hoes
Every other week I gots to buy new Vogues
I love to burn rubber and punch my gas
I got a Posi rear in my four-door's ass
So if you see me spinning in the intersection
Mob your old school in the left direction
And fire up the kill me for Little Bruce
And what's up to my cousins in the seven-deuce
Cutlasses, bumpin' this
To the hoochies at the bus stop, get with this
It's lunch time, and that one's mine
I live like a kingpin all the time

[Hook]
