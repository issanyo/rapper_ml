[Chorus]
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
Hey, yeah
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
I dot the I's, cross the T's
Ain't a spitter in this rap that can trap like me
Or mack like me, throwback like fee
Ballin' do it all in the streets of the V
Beastie I approach 'em
Really don't like 'em, fuck 'em smoke 'em
Hitters I know from the yard in Fulsom
Rippers I know that go I broke 'em
[?]
Game stay sharp, keep creasin' baby
We cash ours out, fuck leasin' baby
Everything bang from the Range to the piece of the chain
I got money in the bank, [?] what you drink?
Candy ass paint
I'm doin' what they can't
[?] hydro and keep blowin' and blowin'
And it could be six in the mornin'
I'll still be

[Chorus]
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
Hey, yeah
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
Hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
Northern California man, home of the hemp
You can tell he had the money man, look at the limp
[?] three deep so I guess he a pimp
Tried to hold him in contempt of a murder attempt
I be feelin' these rippers, sixty on the [?]
Hit me on the text on the MySpace rightly
Seems so exciting but to B it's ignore 'em
I stop, pop [?]
West coast get it off of pills and yadada
Hitters in the cut with the skills to follow ya
We hit you at the spot, blue steel will swallow ya
Thanks to my connect up in Guadalajara
This is money motivation, operation Gouda
Beware of the owner, 'cause the owner's a shooter
We cash out everything, covered with [?]
Especially when you dealin' with them M's

[Chorus]
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
Hey, yeah
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
Hey, yeah

[Verse 3]
You can check G fouls man I go that hard
Like niggas from the pen when they walk that yard
I'm beast in the street yeah I got that car
And bitch I'm a mothafuckin' rap star
I go sick on a cycle, [?] in the air
Niggas rollin' Bela's got smoke everywhere
Baby I'm a player, get a load of me
Ain't met a bitch yet that put a hold on me
Because

[Chorus]
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
Hey, yeah
Gettin' money, I'm a stunna man
Hey, yeah
