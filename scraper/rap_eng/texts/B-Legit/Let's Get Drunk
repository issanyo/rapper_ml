Now drink up, let's get drunk
Le-le-le-le-let's get drunk
Now drink up, let's get drunk
And throw up in the car, let's get drunk

[Verse 1: E-40]
I'm sideways doin about a buck fifty
Perkin' off some of that top of the line wine, Carlos Rossi
Drunk about a gallon to the dome, the neck, the head
Everything's blurry, burnt twisted eyes bloodshot red
Straight up on four

[B-Legit]
Don't forget about Legit though
Danked out, and full of that Cisco
Siding with the proper dame I don't know her name
But I'm lovin this part of the game (yeah)
And I'mma take her for a real ride (uh-huh)
Somewhere deep in the Hillside
I got about a eighth in the coo-ler (coo-ler)
I thinks this just might do her (might do her?)
And ain't nobody gonna stop me mayne (yeah)
Once I gets her sloppy mayne (sloppy mayne)
Drunk as a skunk, and high as a kite
I hope I don't "Earl" on baby tonight

[E-40]
Used to be sophisticated, but now she's intosticated
High society stuck up broad, violated then graduated
If we was the seven, can we get eight? (uh-huh, sure)
Just by you forgettin' to say (yeah)
And then the question later, just like my big old middle finger
Such an ignorant question, sittin' in the corner blushin'
It's really no problems I'mma go head and side and like I'm hecka stuck
And watch baby drink up

[Hook] x2
Now drink up, let's get drunk
Le-le-le-le-let's get drunk
Now drink up, let's get drunk
And throw up in the car, let's get drunk

[Verse 2: D-Shot]
Mac D-Shot needin' a dose of that gin
'Cause I'm in it to win, as I'm tossin' a ten
To plug it right, that is my motive
To dig real deep, as I explode this
And watch the expression, on her face
It gets me off as I collaborate
But that's how it goes another night, another session
But the tender straight taught me a lesson (uh-huh)
Night number two (yeah) I know I shoulda been sober
But now I'm advanced, and I'm about to bend her over
I can't get enough of that [?] for real
And now I'm hopin that she's on the pill
Night number three, I'm well prepared
I got my Eight Ball, and I'm ready to tear
I'm stiffer than a doorknob, I do the job
Enough to tell a friend, that D dug in

[Hook] x2
Now drink up, let's get drunk
Le-le-le-le-let's get drunk
Now drink up, let's get drunk
And throw up in the car, let's get drunk

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Here we go again, and I'm in pursuit
I gotta hit the liquor store before two
'Cause me and D-Shot, Big Bugs and Dan
Needs us a case of them tall cans
It's not a birthday, but let's celebrate
And get hella keyed 'cause it's hella late
I gotta thank God that I'm still alive
Cuz last night I died about 3:45
I hit the lights quick and I jumped in the bed
And somethin went real wrong with my head
The room started spinnin and I needed a breeze
And somethin told me nigga don't you breathe

[E-40]
Dehydrated, nauseated, got a bad case of hiccup
Gotta go fetch some H2O, feel like I'm fits to upchuck
Gots ta have it, looks into the medicine cabinet
Hmm, there it is, plop plop fizz fizz
Oh what a fuckin relief it is
Mumblin and grumblin goes my stomach growling
I'm sick as the fuck I see the devil smiling
It's like a motor, I think I got a damn ulcer and shit
Every other fuckin day I'm tellin my sohabs I quit
But you know that's drama, niggas be barkin they ass off
Life is too boring, that's why I wakes up in the morning
Pervin', swervin', runnin' all into the curb and
Twisted on some of that cherry flavored bourbon, yeah

[Hook] x4
Now drink up, let's get drunk
Le-le-le-le-let's get drunk
Now drink up, let's get drunk
And throw up in the car, let's get drunk
