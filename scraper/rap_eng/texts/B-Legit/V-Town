(Hi, the state and what city, please?)
Vallejo, bitch!

Ha yeah, what's up though
We got some players in the concert tonight
And they all from the V-Town
These muthafuckas is dope though
I'm tellin you, bro
You ain't never heard no shit like this befo'
So Jay Tee, step up to that mic and tell em how you rollin

[ VERSE 1: Jay Tee ]
A 40's what I'm holdin when I'm rollin around
We got the top down bumpin the sound
It's the boys from the V-Town, come right inside, straight pimpin
Dip, hit the strip, I take another sip, then
Kick back and count my bank, yeah, I got dank
Straight skunk, that shit that stank
So now I got my mail on, got another sale on
I don't care who you tell, I got my bail on
Fuck jail, man, I'm out on the street
Here to kickin it with the crew or with a young freak
It's Jay Tee comin cooler than most
Rhyme sayer, pipe layer from the West Coast
Where we toast, kick up and hang
No, we don't gangbang, it's just a crew thing
So you know that I'ma always be down
(With who?) With the muthafuckin V-Town

V-Town, V-Town

[ VERSE 2: TL ]
Once again in my 'Lac, strictly sex on my mind
Got the kind so it's time to relax and unwind
( ? ) I need to get my yak on
Once I get a rock on I'm gonna throw a sack on
So it really doesn't matter if she's thinner, if she's fatter
Than a bus, all I'm gonna do is bust nuts up in her guts
Trust, thrust just a little more till I hit the vibration
Down on my fours, finish up my nut
I make you come through, gee
Look at my pager, it'll say 553-
0461 ( ? )
The Vogues got the hoes just waitin in line
( ? ) TL (back to the hotel)
And after that we'll (hit another hotel)
If the bed is taken throw her on the ground
Cause yo, that's how we sling it in the V-Town

V-Town, V-Town

[ VERSE 3: Jay Tee ]
Now it's the V-a-double l-e-j-o
We hope you know that ( ? ) with a hoe
Cause yo, the players don't roll like they don't do it
But no one's gonna know that every player's been through it
So buy you some ( ? ) and everything'll be cool
And just to be safe, yo man, you better wear two
Cause yeah, they thick and they all look good
But they hot as a fire and they burnin like wood
In the V-Town...
Now when I say the V I mean Vallejo
You gotta have game to stack your mail
You see the times is tough and the streets is rough
But hey, nobody said that you was put here to play
So just be a mack like me (Jay Tee)
Get signed to Rated Z and get paid correctly
I make my money, then bounce
Jump in the train with a real cold 40 ounce
Before I sleep with sluts, playin nothin but old cuts
I'm feelin on big butts
I love life, no wife, I'm just straight up mackin
The big dollars I'm stackin
The plug is on every time that I pick up the mic
I do what I feel and I say what I like
I'm on top cause you know I've always been down
(With who?) With the muthafuckin V-Town

V-Town, V-Town

[ VERSE 4: B-Legit ]
Legit from the Click, yeah bitch, I'm down
Another muthafucka representin the Town
I'm from the V-Town Hillside ( ? )
Two-inch white walls, Vogues and Zeniths
You gotta be right when you side with B
It ain't too ( ? ) when they're fuckin with me
(What you got?) Gold tone plate with the shoes to match
(What else?) Gold pin stripes and gold tone sacks
Sick Click shit, man, that's for reala
And California lifestyle's cool, killer
Late night loungin, I'm in pursuit
Of naythin but legs open after two
So I hops in my coupe and I'm after a
Bitch in a '92 Acura
Straight ( ? ) and you know I'm down
I'm up in em when I bust one for the V-Town

[ VERSE 5: E-40 ]
Magazine Street, Hillside
Vallejo, let's side
Would you look, would you listen
I know you're sayin to yourself: E-40's missin
But man tiger, I was outside of Rated Z pissin
Comin off ( ? ), perved, keyed out my fuckin head
Burnt, twisted, eyes bloodshot red
On the cooch muthafuckas don't want me to let loose
We get our 'Lacs, me, Muggsy, Mac D-Shot, Lil' Bruce
The Valley-Jo, these are the things that you need to know, man
The shit I'm spittin, niggas don't understand
Speakin up for my land ( ? ) all that old shit
Straight up out of Vallejo, E-40 and the Click
Scattin Cutlasses, the beat is boisterous
Smokin muthafuckas like a clitoris
Me and N2Deep, you know we're at this
E-40 holdin his ground
(For who?) For my folks in the V-Town

V-Town, V-Town
