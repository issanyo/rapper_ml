[Chorus]
Hey e e oh oh oh
Ouu
I seen a lot of pain since I was a child  so pray for me I’ve done a few things that just ain't right so pray for me
What I’ve been through will  make you cry so pray for me, pray for me ( for me )
Ooooh I'm trying to change my life so (pray for me )

[Verse 1]
Uh ain't no dope on the streets man I'm behind on my rent, I ain't got nothing to show for all the fetty that
I done spent I told my momma to cash out my life insurance policy, the money  that she was planning on using to bury me. man my rib touching my papers struggling man all my life
I've been hustling running in place but can't seem to finish the race
Seen dudes get whopped in the face plucked like a bass flew into space for senselessness
Thats why I stay prayed up and say my grace even when i'm blended never know when your life is suspended
God can take his arms from around you and easily end it at any time any place anywhere
I know that my lifes been a spared on several occasions suckas hating I’m still here
How come loved ones fall out never talk again to  each other?
Why does it take a funeral to bring family together? Bad weather always looks worse through a window. Stressin and rubbin my temples I make it look easy  but its really not all that simple

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Young dude full of soul food mama cooking pork chops  uncle slapping dominos sister playing hopscotch
And this before the block got hot and infected and everybody knew my granddaddy well respected check it !
Time went on and the game kicked in I was losing comrades either death or the penn
I was losing comrades but i'm stackin them ends we ever go to 600 how we losin our friends
When grandmama passed is when it all went bad
Aunties don't talk my cousins fightin is bad.  and theres no thanksgivings
Like the ones we had and its sad so i express through a pen and a pad
Im on my third wind pimpin knowin Jesus is with me ain't no weapon formed against me that could come and defeat me
I be post in the cuts when them angels come get me until the day homie, Just pray for me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My kin folk and baby mama on welfare they house is bigger than ours
Cuz they got section 8 vouchers WIC and benefit cards my homegirl daughter diabetic
She like to eat whole lot she only nine and a half and taking insulin shots
My dude got a heart condition his ankle be swollen cuz he got high blood pressure and he refuse to quit smoking
But I'm no better than ya’ll I like to drink alcohol
Bring out the pen and start writing about the things that I saw
Like kilograms of that raw and cut peruvian flake wrapped in aluminum foil and duct tape bust open
And thrown in a pot foamy and mushy melted and locked in a shape of a gigantic sized white cookie;
Put on the towel and dried and broken down into zips quarters and halfs and sixteenths of yola get flipped
I maintain my faith in G.O.D cuz its just a test, repent and confess extra grateful man yes Im blessed uh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
