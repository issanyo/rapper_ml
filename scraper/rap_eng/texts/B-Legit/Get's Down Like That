Artist: B-Legit f/ Big Bone, D-Day
Album: The Hemp Museum
Song: Get's Down Like That

B-Legit:

I clear the corners like homers with the bass is strong(?)
They can't stand to see me with it so I fakes no funk
No punk in my bloodline
Just killas and shit
Ride to town like the biggest dope dealers with grip, bitch
It ain't easy being wealthy
Staying healthy
Knowing sucka muthufuckas they want to melt me
But I ain't ice cream, butter, or the cheddar cheese
You better peep the Berreta of a nigga sleep

Big Bone:

'Cuz they be knowin' about the city that I'm comin out of
Check your shit
You might come up short of your hefty grip
We nightcrawlers straight underground
Jackin' you for your shit nigga
What you gonna do now
When you see us niggas comin' through
Grab your bitch and your kids
We want 'em too
Yeah, 'cuz playaz come out when it's sunny
But when night time comes
Those playaz turn into gangstas and get they money

D-Day:

All the time I'm pumpin dope
For those who underestimate the propa shit
And won't quit until I accumulate the propa grip
So don't trip
As we get with these fools who thought they knew
From the gate
Keep it straight when fuckin' with my crew
'Cuz I'll be going up out my way to keep this shit straight
Mobb down about the town like a pancake
Earthquake I'm shakin 'em up like my hurricane
Applying pressure whenever and it's a damn shame

Chorus(X2)
We spit the superfly shit
Makin' a bitch say hey
Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money
We keep them pistols and gats
Down for peelin' them caps
'Cuz them niggas from my camp get's down like that

D-Day:

Keep on hearin' niggas hollin 'bout they ass gotta go
And where they gotta be
One more time I kick rhymes and they don't wanna see
Do Rae Me
Rippin' shit on this M-I-C
Down with two more muthafuckas
Who finna spit it see

Big Bone:

Fuckin with this rap could be bubblelicous
Clear the industry of guppies and goldfishes
We spit the super fly raps
Makin' a bitch say shit
Who the fuck could it be
A-1 and B-Legit

B-Legit:

They got me twisted as hell
It seems I see some females
Some long ass weaves guess jeans and lee nails
But I can't tell
The corbel ain't got me brainy
Bitches all stuck to my paint 'cuz I'm candy
Hand me the muthafuckin' blunt ba-by
I do's a bird 35 down I-Eigh-ty
I'm tryin' to get this bitch to the show now
Oh you know it go down
Fuckin with the t-nown bitch

Chorus(X2)
We spit the superfly shit
Makin' a bitch say hey
Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money
We keep them pistols and gats
Down for peelin' them caps
'Cuz them niggas from my camp get's down like that

Big Bone:

I'm clowin' muthafuckas givin' 'em away
Got your whole block flooded with meth and yay
Tell the asian man I'm on my way
I need major hook
Niggas hog moggin'
Tryin' to keep the whole book
But it don't go down like that
I bring the heat
Leave a nigga relaxing in his front seat
Head back like he asleep
With the reak of a muddy lake
Caught a man code 3 bring the yellow tape

D-Day:

As I get in where I fit in
Some funky ass shit
Down with niggas in my click
To let 'em know who they be fuckin' wit'
Got the shit locked down like up in SQ
Comin' new in '96 is what you best do
I test 1,2 and then I straight run through
Up in the V-A double where you best come true
'Cuz I'll be choppin' up on this game like a ginsu
And all you bitches and tricks know what a nigga like me into

B-Legit:

Some thousand gram units with the cash around 'em
I'll pour 'em out the window
And the task they found 'em
They try to get a nigga
But it's too much scratch
And fools from my camp get's down like that

Chorus(X4)
We spit the superfly shit
Makin' a bitch say hey
Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money
We keep them pistols and gats
Down for peelin' them caps
Cuz them niggas from my camp get's down like that
