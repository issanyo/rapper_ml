(Cal-A keep it lit)

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
Damn, I feel bad for your ex
Girl, you got it all, you blessed
She gon’ show it off—girl, flex
Son ‘em all in a sundress
Who do you belong to?
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know

[Verse 1: E-40]
Who do you belong to?
You make a player wanna spoil you
Show you the other side of the game
Take you to Nobu, no disrespect to PF Chang
Shrimp and lobster tempura with vegetables
Sippin’ wine, matchin’ oyster perpetuals
I be big timin’
Boat cruises, Baja coast, Catalina Island
You oughta cut it out, you cuttin’ up
I know your butt know what you doin’ with your butt
It’s stages to these wages when you bossin’
We could go bowling or we could go miniature golfing
Or catch a flick and hit the matinee
Touch the shooting range and practice with the K
Every night before we go to sleep, we pray
Wake and thank the Lord for another day…UGH!

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
Damn, I feel bad for your ex
Girl, you got it all, you blessed
She gon’ show it off—girl, flex
Send ‘em all in a sundress
Who do you belong to?
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
Little mama hot, do a thousand squats
Lunges all month tryin’ to get a butt
Yeah, I’ma hit her when I get around
See if I could slide through and pick her up
Lunch at the lighthouse, watching the coast
Little adios then it’s back in the Ghost
Times like these, she be lovin’ the most
Photo op queen, she be lovin’ to post
Toast to the good time, laughs in Cali
But B-la really tryna get that ass in Cali
If you ain’t heard now, you should ask in Cali
Leave your mind alone and harass your body
I take you to the bird hut, let you get your nerves up
Breaking something down then we roll a little something up
You could get another cup, maybe even double up
I ain’t tryna lay you down, I’m just tryna line it up

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
Damn, I feel bad for your ex
Girl, you got it all, you blessed
She gon’ show it off—girl, flex
Son ‘em all in a sundress
Who do you belong to?
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know

[Outro: Rexx Life Raj]
Every freakin’ night, and every freakin’ day
I think about freakin’ you, I think about freakin’ you
I need to know
I need to know
