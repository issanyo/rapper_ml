[Intro: Harm]
Only mess with those hustlers
I never mess with those bustas
Only role with those hustlers
I never mess with no bustas

[Verse 1]
[B-Legit]
Ante up, 'cause they done fucked
Wit' a nigga tryin' to get a buck
I leave 'em stuck posted up at a standstill
Beat the case off in Danville
Now I'm back for the overkill, hundred dollar bills
Stuffed in the duffel bag (duffel bag)
Five pounds in the back of the deuce rag
So Harm could ya, would ya help the big fella'
Tell 'em how you about yo' mozzarella

[Harm]
It goes down like Brandy, Peruvian, mother pearl
Caucasian white bitch, dirty white girl
Uncut raw like Eddie, sharp like a 'chete
Steady on the program with missions to get fetti
And I'm ready
On the pedal heavy when I smash
The same muthafucka that hit the gas and dash
To the other side on the down low
'Cause I only deal with hustlers not bustas, you know

[Chorus: Harm]
Only mess with those hustlers
I never mess with no bustas
I only mess with those hustlers
I never mess with no bustas

[Verse 2]
[B-Legit]
And not too many get to ride with me
And you know how a punk ass bitch can be
A snitch to me, heart pump on hundred
And probably ain't never gon' have no money

[Harm]
I know the same situations but know the vocations
To a brother that's lackin', no muscles in your crack'n
What happened to all the days that you spent hustlin'
Now everytime I see ya' you be strugglin'

[B-Legit]
The batch better have my cabbage
And keep the shit comin' like the little pink rabbit
Dagnabit
I gotta have it to support, can't come up short
So I'm solo in a Super Sport

[Harm]
I'm still independent but in a minute I'mma be lavish
Got the game from B-Legit, told me, "Harm, you can have this"
So I had to get the focus
Let fools know I wasn't no joke in this game that I play
And representin' with hustlers everyday

[Chorus: Harm]
I only mess with those hustlers
I never roll with no bustas
I only mess with those hustlers
I never mess with no bustas

[Verse 3]
[Harm]
A funkin' we goin' go
In a Carpice four-door
Ready for war
Suspects get took playin' the wrong crooks
Legit and Harm wit firearm that leave you quiet like a storm

[B-Legit]
Infrared, niggas fled from the street side
From a nigga droppin' mess in a fleet side
Niggas ride to blast wit no masks in the broad daylight
See I neva fuck with bustas, right

[Harm]
Game tight, 'cause the game be thick
Gotta watch out who ya fuck wit 'cause bustas die quick
So Legezee, would you let ya' playa pezee knezee
How it goes dezee in the tezee

[B-Legit]
For shezee
The Savage move chickens like a Mexican
And I'm back to writin' bad ass checks again
We'll check yo' chin, bitch, believe that (Believe that)
Spits nathin' but game so receive that (Receive that)

[Chorus: Harm]
Only mess with those hustlers
I never roll with no bustas
Only mess with those hustlers
I never roll with no bustas

I only mess with those hustlers
I never mess with no busta
I only roll with a hustler
I never roll with a busta

[Outro: Harm]
I only roll with hustlers, right
Now baby like to roll with me
I only mess with hustlers, right
Now baby like to roll with me
I only mess with hustlers, right
Now baby like to roll with me
I only mess with hustlers, right
Now baby like to roll with me
