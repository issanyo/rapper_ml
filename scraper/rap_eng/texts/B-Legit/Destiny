B-Legit (Levitti)
And it goes down, like this, like this
(Into my des-ti-ny , now I see now I see)
And it goes like this, like this
(Was once confused by these haters, now I see now I see)

Im in the house about six, twist the lit
I park my V-Hic feedin my bitch
They wonder if I switched since I signed my deal, Im Legit!
Im deep up in this game for real
The bars of steel I got the black gate
Twin 38's just to keep things straight
Im late for everythang money is joy
I run the rap game like a ol'  D-boy
I can rock gator boots and wear K-Swiss
Put the diamonds on my pinky watchin the wrist
I'll tell you like this the g'z gon' sag
Wit some real freem in my bag
And it goes like this, like this

(chorus)
Des-ti-ny now I see, was once confused by these haters in this cold
So-cie-ty
Now maybe Im wrong about the way I fluc
But the game stays real to me I can't help but get my skrill

Im in the wind, 600 Benz up in the traffic
My rims, reals girls in it's like magic, its drastic
Tryin to live the life that i live
I rap P.I. and stay high as i need
Im a factor, brought in a rapper
Im from the game
Legit is the name the mo' skrilla the fame
In the train, all in Seatle where it rains
You can by my slang Im from the bay maine
A rap star peice Im a beast on the mic
It's ten, I'll creep up in by midnight
You can check my rap site B-Legit.com
And it tell you that yo' boy he the bomb
And it goes like this, like this

(chorus)

Make way, a brand new day, so peep the boss
It's true when I come through so tear it off
It cost, so we all kick it and ball
And talk about the platinum and gold on the wall
Im a savage, ain't nobody bad like me
Got people from the bay all the way to DC
Ask the boy RP and KRED
About a hog out the valley named legitamet B
Im a mac, I rap on special request
Call me superman without the cape and the "S"
Im from the hillside and plan to hold that down
So let me know when you fools hit the westbound

(Levitti)
Im feelin like I got the whole world in my hands
Give the boots on the feet for the limp-in
Sophisticated high classsssy
If you gonna have it, have it Lavissssh
(chorus)
