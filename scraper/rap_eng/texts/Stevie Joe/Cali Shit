[Verse 1: J-Easie]
Stay true to my sound I'm just the same
I saw she watchin' me like the sharks playin'
My city comin' out one day at a time
Once I'm out, there really be no contemplating
Think I'm going in now, it's just the beginnin'
My flow stay hot might need some mittens, pimpin'
I'm on the rise like a bunch of pigeons
Catch me rollin' in the hood wit' some syrup that I been sippin'
If you talk about the homies, they been trippin'
If you talk about J-Easie, I been livin'
They don't really want it like a car they ain't driven
Me I look at my best work and think somethin's missin'
From Sano but my fam from Chicago and Oakland
On mamas you don't wanna provoke 'em (ayy, ayy)
Appearance got me thinkin' that I was chosen
Got shooters on the team like DeMar DeRozan
From Cali so Curry got the Bay goin'
Lil' mama at the club said that I go in
Do anything for a nigga, even talkin' hoein'
She a rider, anything to get the money flowin'

[Chorus: J-Easie]
This be that Cali shit
Grab shawtie and work them hips to this
Wake up and count yo' chips to this
Got backwoods you know we keep it lit in this bitch
Got my thang 'case a nigga act strange (act strange)
In my city they'll rob you for your chain (for your chain)
I like my girl street smart wit' a brain
My fame is the plus so we meet and we arrange, uh

[Verse 2: Slimmy B]
Slimmy B what my name is (gang, gang)
These hoes wanna fuck me 'cause I'm famous
Big boss, I'm the wrong one to play wit'
Masked up when I slide, like I'm Jason (boom, boom)
North Vallejo, Crest nigga, throw them C's up (gang, gang)
SOB x RBE, throw them B's up (gang, gang)
At the house countin' hundreds wit' my feet up
A nigga runnin' round broke, I can't be one
On the road for that cash, I be OT (I be OT)
Still money over bitches, M.O.B. (M.O.B.)
I was laced wit' this game from the OG's (from the OG's)
Never snitch, don't be a bitch is what they told me (gang)
You ain't really in these streets, nigga stop it (nigga stop it)
Tuck yo' chain around the gang, you can't rock it (you can't rock it)
On the block wit' that .40, yeah rocket (boom, boom)
And if a nigga want a verse I need to rock it bitch

[Chorus: J-Easie]
This be that Cali shit
Grab shawtie and work them hips to this
Wake up and count yo' chips to this
Got backwoods you know we keep it lit in this bitch
Got my thang 'case a nigga act strange (act strange)
In my city they'll rob you for your chain (for your chain)
I like my girl street smart wit' a brain
My fame is the plus so we meet and we arrange, uh

[Verse 3: Stevie Joe]
Thuggy man bitch doin' a hundred on the highway (skirt)
Hundred band lick got that foreign in the driveway (oh)
Bad lil' bitch and she do whatever I say
Run me money up yeah I put that on mi madre
Solid for forever ain't never been on no sucka shit (naw)
Those that went against the grain them is who I ain't fuckin' wit
They blew wit' Joe, got some new dough and it's coo though (it's coo)
Kilo on my neck, these lil' niggas rockin' fools gold (ha)
On that Cali shit, project and the Valley bit
Mapquest to a check soon as the addy sent (pull up)
Shine like the sun whip cleaner than yo' daddy shit
Lookin' like a platinum nigga and I ain't never had a hit (naw)
No deal, still never missed one meal
5 carats in my baby girl and my son's ear (fa real)
Do this shit easy, that's on me
Ol' Stevie still a cold ass SOB
Mufucka

[Chorus: J-Easie]
This be that Cali shit
Grab shawtie and work them hips to this
Wake up and count yo' chips to this
Got backwoods you know we keep it lit in this bitch
Got my thang 'case a nigga act strange (act strange)
In my city they'll rob you for your chain (for your chain)
I like my girl street smart wit' a brain
My fame is the plus so we meet and we arrange
