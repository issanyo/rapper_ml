Shit!
Thuggy
You already know

[Verse 1]

Aye
They say life is what you make (what you make)
But once you make it hatin’ niggas try and take (shit)
They claim you ain’t keeping it real ‘cause they ain’t make shit
When you was just out there with them, time waste, some of that
I do it for the niggas who ain’t have a chance
Shoot pistols, make pussies do the hammer dance
Stuff stack, make them pockets look like hammer pants
These niggas need help, somebody call the ambulance
I don’t like the niggas kind
May God strike me with automatic rifles if I’m lying
I love music but sometimes you’ve gotta draw the line
A nigga try and [?] you keep that hammer all the time
If you disrespect me put that hammer on his mind and squeeze
Greed is like some kind of disease
They say it’s better to give while we all trying to receive
The pimps, the dope dealers, the robbers and thieves
School of hard knocks, I’ve got a massive degree
I smoke cook, 34 zip 33 4p
No hook, this music shit is therapy for a G
These raps shook, ‘cause they know they ain’t fucking with me
They hoping that the people don’t see who really eating these
Niggas, every beat, spit ether every feature (thuggy)
I got big dreams and I pray I really rich
Bitches say I’m handsome, I fuck ‘em by the threes
Fucking some decent, I came up from the scene
Sonning these niggas like they came from my semen
You better believe it, if I said it I mean it
Whoever the fuck want it you can get a disease
I heard from a bird on a wire
These niggas is nerds and liars
We got this shit on lock like a pair of pliers
Bitches Livewire, the fucking empire
Thuggy!
