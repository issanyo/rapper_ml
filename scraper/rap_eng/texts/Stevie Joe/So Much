[Verse 1: Berner]
Got so much cake
Damn I sold so much weight
I'm in bed with two girls that'll go both ways
Cold days in the summer time
They got me heated
Got me looking up at Jesus like "God I don't need this"
Why the suckers try to be us
It's the mob
I'll leave that pussy bleeding
On the ground barely breathing
Its drought season time to pay way more
I love it because i make way more
Grade A Pure
For my nose
Got my face all froze
Its twelve o'clock and got three cakes sold
And this game's old
But this money is great
He got killed right in front of his place
Right in front of his kids
What a way to go
But the shooter got caught because his neighbors told
Two lives gone over money; that's sad
Damn I hate it when it gets this bad

[Hook 1: Ampichino]
Cheaa uhh uhh
Cheaaa
I pop up with the top down
Hop out with the chop spit fifty rounds
Cheaa life of a rock star
My ice bright like the lights on the cop car
Block stock broker
Checking on the stock sections
My money longer than your intestines
We move blow at a fast pace
Come up short on the dough and get the gashed face

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I got so much dope
Damn i sold so much dope
In the kitchen cooking so much coke
Like that's all i know
Light the kush up
Pour that fo'
Life's a bitch
But i'm on that hoe
I get on that road
Outfit four days old
Wrap 'em up
And in four days sold
This the life i chose
I know its wrong but that's how shit goes
So I'm thugging it til I get old
Close knit clique
Every nigga with me play his role
Niggas know they position
All focused on one mission
Any nigga go against this
Then that nine clickin'
This here is an army
Front line [is a signed list][?]
Momma always said life was hard
And I need to get right with God
But I feel I'm out here hustling for a righteous cause
It's fucked up in this life evolved

[Hook 2: Ampichino]
Cheaa uhh uhh
Cheaaa
I pop up with the top down
Hop out with the chop spit fifty rounds
Cheaa life of a rock star
My ice bright like the lights on the cop car
Block stock broker
Checking on the stock sections
My money longer than your intestines
We move blow at a fast pace
Come up short on the dough and get the gashed face

[Verse 3: Stevie Joe]
I got so much cash
Damn I'm moving so much hash
Four pounds in a duffle bag
Now you do the math
Plus i got so much grass
Fuck the white girl I'm moving the black
Now who fucking with that
D boy all my life I just started rappin'
Fake niggas they all fold like a fucking napkin
One store four pots in the microwave
Young fifty rich bitch I'm tryna get paid
Ask them niggas out of town they say i got it boomin'
Bad bitches sending money through the Western Union
And I tell 'em run it in bitch I need mine
Because the kid all about a fucking dollar sign
My nigga lil blunt
He sending white hoes
While you other niggas just try to wife hoes
Broke all your life
Ain't gon' never have nothing
But get up on this bitch and do a whole lot of fronting
Feel me nigga

[Hook 3: Ampichino]
Cheaa uhh uhh
