[Intro: The Jacka]
I got my cannon out
Count a couple hunnid thousand on my couch
Now put the check away, never flex till you fed every mouth

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
(?)
Voice of the street, fly girls wanna meet too
Straight to our place not safe but they still go
Trappin' in they face and we ain't trynna be cool
I know you love me now
(?) is my sound cause it gave you style
Knocks spend money when we come around
Don't play first time you don't pay I'll probably gun ya down

[Hook: The Jacka]
I got my cannon out
Count a couple hunnid thousand on my couch
Now put the check away, never flex till you fed every mouth (x2)
