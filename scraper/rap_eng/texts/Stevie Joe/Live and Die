[Verse 1: The Jacka]
In the (?) and he chillin' with two bitches like JA
Drum look like two titties on a AK
Y'all ain't gettin money then you nutty as a payday
(?) can't get on 'less you take safes
Got a hunnid guns can't stop us with your vest plate
Got a hunnid patnas, hunnid choppas in the best state
In the projects ain't no connect safe
Never stop the Mob shit cause we really miss Dre
Yea, so we keep the shit going
All my niggas drive foreigns, every bitch we got hoeing
Yea nothing but knocks call my home
30 in the G-lock all I think about is scoring
On a bitch ass nigg gonna find out where you live
You won't wake the next morning
Can't believe we getting payed for performing
We was trynna find a way selling yae while its storming
