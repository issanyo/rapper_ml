The girl was lookin good
Like a lady should
I remember where I saw her
I saw her in the magazine
Her body's tight, her fingers right
Reminds me of a girl from around the way
Ooooh oooh, I saw her in a magazine

Verse 1: Queen Pen, 911

Uhh, I heard you been lookin for me
Diggin me down, giving me nothin but peach
Ha please, you know where to find me when you need me
Queen P, got you charmed out like them trees
Or Lexus, heck a car load full of G's
Impress thee, wit the realism technique
Automatically, pulled you right into my lead
Feel me, as you indulge in your magazine

I couldn't believe my eyes
When I opened up that magazine
It was the finest girl I ever seen
I think I knew her face
I saw her hangin out around the way
Watchin all the players play, whoaaa
Her smile sets off this glow
And when she walks, it's such a sexy flow
I think I want to let her know, that
(She's a bad mamma jamma) Owowohhh
Just as fly as she can be, ohohowoh

Chorus

Verse 2: 911

I, often dream of us
And I can't believe it feels so real
It gives me such a freaky thrill
I like to hold her hand
And tell all the fellas I'm her man
But my dream came to an end
Now that she's on my mind
I just wanna make her mine
We'll be together til the end of time, ooooohhhhhh
(Yes I can make my dreams come true)
Then everything would be so cool
And I would never spend one night without you

Chorus

Bridge: 911

I can't explain, what she's done to me
So fine that it's a crime
Ooooh, I want her in my life
She's one of a kind
That girl, she blows my mind

Verse 3: Queen Pen

Uhh, ain't no need for awakening, cos you're not dreaming
I mean your optics be as clear like semen
It's me, squeaky clean, mentally and physically
I be's the one to weigh you down like a triple beam
Whore on the low low, never showin off like dem other hoes
I let my appearance show and prove
That's my motto, boo, styles of all types
So peel the lights and Pen, keeps it tight

Chorus: 911

The girl was lookin good
Like a lady should
I remember where I saw her
I saw her in the magazine
Smilin that day, she still looks good
Like she's got it goin on
Ooooh ooooh, I saw her in the magazine
