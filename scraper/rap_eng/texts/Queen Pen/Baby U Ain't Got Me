[Intro]
Boy, I think that you should know
You could have all the doe
But you can't buy me, money can't buy me

1 - [Changing Faces]
You can have all the whips
You can have all the cribs
You can have all the chips
You can have all the hits
You have any girl you need
You can be living like a king
That don't mean anything you see
Cuz baby you ain't got me

[CF]
Baby, I know you're not tryin' to tempt me
Gas me up on empty
When you know I peeped game right from the door
You're mistaking
To think that I'll go crazy
You may think that I'm hating
But I'm not the least bit infatuated

2 - [CF]
I'm not impressed
With all these things you own
Could care less, save that
For some chick who don't know
I want a man who's got
It goin' on up top
And I know doe is cool
But it don't buy my love

Repeat 1

[CF]
Now you're skatin'
On Cloud Nine cuz they been
Playing your song on a station
And all them fakers are your new-found friends
Livin' lavish when you know you're average
You're too much with karats
Check you got a Benz
I was diggin' you more when you had nothing

Repeat 2
Repeat 1

[Queen Pen]
I see this end of the street done fucked your head up
You done made a little doe and stepped your game up
But you can't handle it like a real nigga could
I'd rather you stay broke and never left out the hood
You don't impress me yo, cuz I knew you from before
When you was doin' spot dates before doin' major tours
Before you hit it big, when you didn't have no whip
You was a nice guy, way back then
And I, can't deny, now you ain't worth shit
Tell me how you gon' live off of one good hit?
Go on, run your game on some new jack chicks
Cuz me and Changing Faces, we own our own chips nigga

[CF]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Repeat 1 to fade
