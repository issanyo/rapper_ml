[Verse 1 (Dizzee Rascal)]
Come on England we need to sort it out
Put the champs down
Pull your finger out
Leave the WAGs alone
Set aside your ego
We're tired of bragging about 40 odd years ago
We need a victory, quick, fast
Tired of getting a kick, oi!
World Cup 2010
Don't wanna see ya slip past
Think about the future
Surely it's the right time
I wanna see you win it in my lifetime
1966 Bobby Moore and that Geoff Hurst put it to the turf, we applauded that
There was no ignoring that
Nobody could stop him
I gotta myself an England shirt I'm gonna rock it

[Hook (James Corden)]
Cos there's so much to play for
But we've got to come together [Ay oh, ay oh, ay oh, ay oh]
You know we've got to come together now [Ay oh, ay oh, ay oh, ay oh]
1, 2, 3, everybody sing
Shout! Shout! Let it all out (Come on England!)
These are the things I could do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on
Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough!
Ay oh, ay oh, ay oh, ay oh
And all the people sing
Ay oh, ay oh, ay oh, ay oh
Come on England!

[Verse 2 (Dizzee Rascal)]
Pull your socks up let's get physical
We need team work - we don't need a miracle
We need Rooney in tip top condition
Aaron Lennon down the wing like he's on a mission
It ain't no superstition, its not a luck thing
Rio Ferdinand nobody can fuck with him!
Hope we get stuck in, on't get caught out
And stop trying to hog the ball
Knock the ball about

[Hook]

Steven Gerrard with the shot
It's in the net for England
Well there's been some doubts
But those doubts have been swept away now And England are heading for South Africa

[Hook x2]
