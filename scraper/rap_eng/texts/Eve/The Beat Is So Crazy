[Verse 1: Eve]
Some nights, all alone
Thoughts of you come creepin' in
Temporarily insane
Cause you're never gonna change, no

[Refrain 1: Eve]
We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought
We'd be happily forever

[Chorus: Madonna]
The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

[Verse 2: Eve]
Never thought I was the type to hang around
Lied to myself constantly
Bout the person I thought you would be
Who's to blame, I guess it's me
I cause my own misery
Tit for tat, this and that
I needed my own life back
Now here I am
I'm so happy it's time to move on

[Chorus: Madonna]
The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

[Refrain 2: Eve]
We had, we had, we had, we had
(Are you listening?)
We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought, we'd be happily forever

[Bridge: Eve]
I'd always thought (what you want her to do?) now here I am
I'd always thought (why can't you listen?) we'd be happily forever

[Chorus: Madonna]
The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
