[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
You're telling me were cool but that just ain't enough
'Cause everything that you do makes me want you more
Feeling that I have for you can't be replace easily
But you seem to think that you have the best of me

[Pre-Chorus]
My love is closed for you
Let nobody enter
Even when I'm with someone ain't the same when I'm with ya
Please tell me that you're listening
Please tell me that you're hearing me
'Cause I'm gonna be here always

[Chorus: 2x]
Even if you give me all your love
Even if you give me all your kisses
It will be never (never too much) [x2]

[Bridge: 2x]
Give me all your love never too much

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
I know that baby if it's meant we'll be
But every time I see you boy ooh what you do to me
Make my body shiver lips quiver when I say your name
Loving you is like an emotional ride
Dare to stay?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Eve]
I don't give a f*ck about the money in the bank you got
Love you the same even if buying me trinkets stop
Got my heart in your hands and I think you know
Can't put a price on my love and the way you grow
I think I melt inside when you look in my eyes
Baby all I see in you fuck them niggas who try
Don't ever worry bout my loyalty
Try the others and I'm cool cause you treat me like I'm royalty
Been through the bullshit
Been through the games
Been through the telephone arguments
With nothing ass dames
On 'em crazy days you help me maintain
Sometimes I think your love be keeping me sane
Never worry daddy I ain't never going nowhere
Whatever happens best believe I'll be staying right here
I need your kisses and I need your touch
Don't ever think I had it all cause its never too much

[Breakdown]
Give me all your love, never be too much, give me all your love
Never too much repeat [3x]
Even if you give me all your love
Even if you give me all your kisses
It will be never (never too much) [x2]

[Outro]
Don't matter if you're rich or poor baby
I never wanted anybody more baby
