[Intro: Dawn Richard]
I don't care what they say, I'm in love
There ain't enough money in the world
Go together like hip-hop, smooches, our lips lock
Together like get hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

[Verse 1: Eve]
So you want a black Porsche, knew I was in love
Come on up a brown skin, yea give it up
Fell so hard, won't you come and pick me up?
Had a taste once and I can't get enough
Mesmerized by the gleam in yoir eyes
Takin it back by the swag in your stride
I done got picked up by the love boat
Eat it up, go hard with yo love girl

[Hook: Dawn Richard]
I don't care what they say, I'm in love
There ain't enough money in the world
Boy together I get high, smooches, our lips lock
Together I get high, get high
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you
Keep me from you, keep me from you

[Verse 2: Eve]
You know that thief in the night
Stole my heart so you better treat it right
I ain't even wanna listen what my friends say
Cause I know that it's all just jealousy
Is it punched or ?
Or could it just be infatuation?
Uh, whatever that is
Time will tell, I don't care, let's live
For the nightless world
Alien love, wanna be your girl
Milk chaser, stumbling
When I get next to you I'm mumbling
If a chick try to step up we rumbling
Want a future with you like remember boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eve]
You're so much more than a crush
I'm down like the Chevy on dubs
On lock, like a pair of handcuffs
Your house is my home, let me get my stuff
I'm sick, don't need no medicine
Cupid shot me in the heart; veteran
I'm gone, ain't no coming back
Drunk off love, drank too much of that

[Hook x2]
