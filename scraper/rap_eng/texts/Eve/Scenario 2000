(Swizz Beatz)
See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff Ryderz is a family
Ruff Ryderz....Ruff Ryderz...Ruff Ryderz
Lets go...Swizz Beatz

(DMX)
This is the darkest shit sparkest shit
Hittin wit the hardest shit 'cause before we started shit
Wit kidz I knew my f**kin friendz all turned against me
Said f**k it bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this
He got my back I got his schemin on mad niggas
Dats how we do bidz
It's about time to start another, robbin spree
'cause yo, my way is highway, robbery
When I was up north since 16 I was sendin niggas home in a coffin
Livin like a orphan, you bad nigga?
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here
You know my style will put yo f**kin man, in a wheelchair
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
Dats how I left him G, scared to death of me
Niggas cannot run, hit wit da hot one
From the shotgun, catz was close wondered how we got done...

(Eve)
Yo yo, E-V-E
My dogz believe in me
Petty thugz hide yo cake, never teasin me
I show love to, all my bitches hustlin one'z, tussle wit these
Makin moves, second to none, I locked it, huh
Made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit
Da blond hair bandit, you got gunz, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
'cause I don't wear sunblock
Ask Drag if the fire is hot (Flame On baby)
Shit pop shellz, fall three feet, roll over and stop
We warn niggas that we comin, then we total the block
We scorn niggas like they mothers, then we wet up they socks
Red dot, excapin on a radar, to seashore, then hide out
And buy out bars till we see far
In this game, we beat y'all, you got money?
Keep y'alls, for us be tearin tryin to hide, then tear out fire
Beat y'alls

(JadaKiss)
And you can come see me if you tryin to
Get some gramz for the night
'cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white
F**k rap yo, I'd rather be plannin the flights
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning wit dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of em givin me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me, and get wit me
And still end up bein mad 'cause I charge 50
And as for you suckaz, you can keep those rapz
And screw yo awardz, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shipped but some thingz I never forget
Like if you spent three you garanteed to make back six
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stashed, tick the governer off
Even the catz that be hatin still be lovin the dogz
'cause they know that the double R's comin for war
Wha

(Styles)
You ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
'cause when I start bustin the gunz you hidin the kids
And the Pieer's still ridin wit clips, survivin wit bricks
We beefin on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin dope or robbin the blocks
Starvin or not, carvin the cheek, palmin the Glock
I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice this shit is my life
Catch me wit a .45, hot pair of Nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face
Gimmie a shank It's Holiday(Uh)
The hooptie's in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggas wanna ride tommorow when they'll probabaly die today
'cause da Pio'll hollow the gunz
Then holla at son (I feel you nigga)
And when he go to holla back, niggas swallowin one

(Sheek)
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggas and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggas that took yo leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon bust
Cause they crazy, but crazy niggas bleed like us
See I'm one shot thru the heart like Cupid
Y'all niggas might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
It's 99, I'm killin you, woman and kid
F**k Scarface, watch me, I'm mo action to see
Than the muthaf**kaz that y'all see on T.V
And f**k what you heard, check how Sheek get down
Comes the gun, shit, I'm rhymin wit one on me now
You neva know, what clown could walk in the studio
Talkin shit, and there's gon be more than the amps that blow
I'll pour gas on yo skin and watch yo shit detach
Wit a book of matches, now dats when you met yo match
And the worst thing for you is for me to have a gun when I'm thirsty
I'll turn niggas more Holy Man, than Eddie Murphy
And I deal wit mo bricks than that city do in Jersey
I got call cops niggas
I got autops niggas, that'll bust you and slide
Wit some of 6-drop niggas
Revolver Pop niggas, easy Ox niggas, get knocked
Say I smoked detox niggas
Drug program, hit the streetz and cop 56 mo gramz
Y'all niggas ain't f**kin wit the fam and dats word

(Drag-On)
Hey yo boy, whats the difference between fire and water?
You whether drown or die off torture, cause yo skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo bitch a perm wit that
Keep shellz in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets
More blood that a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, got a extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you
You gon do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp you gon be crunchier than chips
Wit my hand all up in the bag, munchin on this shit
Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block is brick on brick
So I got knots on knots, got thingz that'll pop yo top
And double R spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin up, lest they in the wheelchair
Sittin up or spittin up, either way I don't give a f**k
