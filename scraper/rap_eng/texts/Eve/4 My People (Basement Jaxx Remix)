Yo, yo, yo, yo get it right

The party's jumping
I see something fine
Boy I wanna kiss you
But I'm just too shy
Let me dance with you
Let me wear you out
Here's a glass of orange juice
Let's go X it out

The music's banging
Way down in my soul
When you dance behind me
I lose all control
Make me grind my hips
Make me move my waist
When the music come on
You take my breath away

This is for my people
My party people
And this is for my people
My ecstasying people
Come on, get down
Come on, get down

This is for my people
My party people
And this is for my people
My ecstasying people
Come on, get down
Come on, get down

I'm at the bar now
And I'm buying drinks
And I got this feeling
And it's all over me
I wanna dance with you
Let me lick your face
Meet me on the dance floor
To feel some ecstasy

The vibe is right now
And I'm bout to score
Mr. DJ can you...
Play this joint once more
Cos I see the man I want
I want him right away
I look him right in his face
And say dance with me

This is for my people
My party people
And this is for my people
My ecstasying people
Come on, get down
Come on, get down

This is for my people
My party people
And this is for my people
My ecstasying people
Come on, get down
Come on, get down

Skip that flip that bring the beat back
