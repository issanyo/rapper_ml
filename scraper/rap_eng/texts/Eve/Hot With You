[Prince]
Hot with you

1 - [Prince]
I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the creamy ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tummy in saying ooh
I wanna get hot with you
Take you upstairs to the four inch room
Multi-colored lights and an ocean view
Ooh I wanna get hot with you

[Prince]
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
I want to get hot with you
I wanna get you underneath your cream and do the marshmallow
Ooh I wanna get hot with you
I want to get you to do something you'd never thought you'd do
Like dancing in front of my headlights on a hot summer night, nude
I wanna get hot with you

Repeat 1

[Prince]
I want to get hot with you
I want to make you climb this chain around my waist
So I can prove
That I'm the only one that brings out the freak in you
I wanna get hot with you

[Eve]
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you, huh
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you, what?
You know the body banging
Got you singing
Ignoring shouts from neighbors, telephone ringing
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine and now you know you can't stop her
Trying to turn me out, it never happens, so softest
I'm supposed to tremble cause they call you the Artist
Let's wile out, can you handle ruff ryding?
Treat you like the freak of the week and have you hiding from me
I do whatever you like if you can take it
If I can be your girlfriend, you can catch me naked
Can front, sexually, I'd like a sample
But I don't think that I'm ready for you to make me an example
I mean come on, why front on?
I'd never place time claiming your life, I'm there whenever
The things that you're feeling for me, mutual
Bet I'm even ready to call you daddy, even get hot with you

[Prince]
Meet me early morning
And aboard the mansion plane
As your traveling higher
I know you know my game
Underneath the cream I'll meet you
And then we'll rearrange
Everything you know of love
I'll give you reason to change

Get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you

I want to get hot with you
I wanna steal a kiss in the middle of an overcrowded room
Yeah that's what I wanna do ay-ya-ya
I wanna get hot with you
Hot with you boo

Repeat 1

Take a drive to the ocean
And drown you in a wave
Of a whole thousand compliments
Boo I want you everyday
You need to be cool
And the only way to do that is every night
Get hot, get hot with you, yeah baby

Repeat 1

Hot with you, yeah
I wanna get hot with you

Repeat 1

I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the creamy ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tummy in saying ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
