Now I'ma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'ma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
A lotta niggas is bitches, a lotta bitches be trippin'
A lotta them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lotta niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay, half of the rest ain't
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do, reality they can't
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em, half the time I'm not
It ain't nothin' new though, learned it from off the block
People think I changed much 'coz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad, most of the time I don't
'Coz if I don't protect my shit, other niggas won't
Some want me to neglect my shit, take it for a joke?!
But I'm stayin' on the grind, never goin' back to broke

Anything I want'
I can get it 'cuz I know I need it
You see me comin' and I know you heat it
Anything I need'
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am'
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need'
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

You tryina enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin'
This whole ship is my ship bitch and I'm the captian
Can't beat me join me baby then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whip to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends what they wanna do to me
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'coz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby what's the deal I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my mission

Anything I want'
I can get it 'coz I know I need it
You see me comin' and I know you heat it
Anything I need'
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am'
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need'
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat y'all, it's like a magnet
I don't really mess wit too many 'coz they be plastic
That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic
Anything less than a banger will not have it
Still I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
But in the mean time ball while we live the dream
And now I need to hear y'all sing

Anything I want...
I can get it 'cuz I know I need it
You see me comin' and I know you heat it
Anything I need'
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am'
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need...
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction (x2)
