[Verse 1: Eve]
Step back, where she at, man I’m in my zone
If you can’t keep up with where I’m at
Then take your ass back home
Raise the flag and tell the people come
The queen is on the throne
Watch how they leave you standing there
Just leave you all alone
You a clone of a bunch of people
Go and get your own
Matter fact, I don’t give a fuck, you guessed that from my tone
I’m a Philly born, bred, raised, never left my bones
I’m a bossy, glossy mogul, world wide my name is known

[Hook: Eve]
Ain’t no guessing it’s E-V-E
I’m the chick that they wish they’d be
Know by now, do not fuck with me
Stay on top, no touching me
I’m the reason you wanna hide
Smile on your face, fear in your eyes
Better than ever, ain’t no surprise
See all of me, need no disguise
I’m E-V-E
E-E-V-E
E-E-V-E
E-E-V-E
Ain’t no guessing it’s E-V-E
I’m the chick that they wish they’d be
Know by now, do not fuck with me
Stay on top, no touching me
Ain’t no guessing it’s E-V-E
I’m the chick that they wish they’d be
Know by now, do not fuck with me
Stay on top, no touching me

[Verse 2: Eve]
You see how they need her, they was loyal, they keep her
All my fans you the best, feel my love through the speaker
You the reason I do it, I’m so lucky I can
And taking over the world, now that’s just part of the plan
They see me riding in a matte black, drop head, look at that
Tom Ford shades on, understand that I’m it, that’s that
Rock life jet set, Rob report, I’m living good
Yeah I knew I would, I know you wish you could

[Hook]
