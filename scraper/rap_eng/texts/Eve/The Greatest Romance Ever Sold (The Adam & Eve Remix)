The greatest romance that's ever been sold

So whadda ya know U and me
Finally face 2 face
Checkin' each other up and down
In all the obvious places
Was there ever a reason
4 us 2 be apart?
The air that fills up this room
Say's not hardly

So this is where u end
And U and I begin
(This is where U and I, U and I begin)
The greatest romance thats ever been sold

Baby, baby. Now ur mind is open
2 poetry seldom heard
Ur heart has never been broken
Until u've heard these words
"Ur body was designed 2 respond 2 mine
In spite of ur desire to mold me"

And in the middle of it all
We kiss and like rain we fall (Like rain, we fall)

Into the greatest romance that's ever been sold
Baby. Oh baby, baby
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

Oh, oh I know U feel me, I know that U can dance (Help)
But what do U know about the greatest romance?
Not what U think but what U believe (Tell me)
What was the real reason that Adam never left Eve?
And if the truth sounds like a memory
Then U know it was meant 2 be (meant 2 be)
Leave ur inhibitions behind
Come on, come on let's see (What? Why?)
So this is where U end (This is where U end)
And U and I begin (U...)

And U, U, U. U offer me ur love, ur love, ur love so devine
And in return girl, In return I will surrender
Oh yeah. I will surrender, Oh yes I will
