How heavy the sky was outside of my windows
And from the inside I watched it go by
With all that I've got to reach back to remember
The things I fought, so hard with each thought
Then your voice returns until every word burns the walls
I tried to keep you outside, you're part of me now
But you're not around
Why you're under my skin
You found a way to get in
Why you're under my skin
And now the thoughts I resist
I reuse
Strange how it hits me when all of the moments I used to know travel so close
Through my invitation, I'm reluctant to feel it pierce through my skin
And with every inch it brings back the hurt
As thoughts recur inside my head of all that we said
To leave it behind but now you're inside
Why you're under my skin
You found a way to get in
Why you're under my skin
And now the thoughts I resist
I reuse
You're a part of me now but you're not around
