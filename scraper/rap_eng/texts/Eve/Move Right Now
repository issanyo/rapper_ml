[Swizz]
Uhh, yeah yeah yeah
Yo yo, come on
Come on Eve, Swizz Beats
Drag-On baby

[Chorus Swizz]4x
We want y'all to move right now

[Drag-On]
Break 'em down
Put 'em up
Shake 'em down
Pat 'em down
Then bat 'em down
Get the gun
Gat 'em down
Get the rope tie 'em up
Strike a match lite 'em up
Then fly 'em up to the spot a pile of dust
Get the chips stack 'em up bag a bitch dig her out
Then kick 'em out let dogs sick 'em out
All I do is tell 'em get the tissue
I only fuck wit chicks that suck nuts out of pickles
You want problems? well I'll solve 'em and make examples
I love bustin out crowds so all people get trampled
Spit crowds wit the 4-5
Like when Moses split the tide
Those that froze chose to die
Stay higher than a hello, how you doin?
Burn the rubber till the tires ruin
Burn a coat of fire human
Cause this Drag
Burnin like the grits on Al Green's back
Causin a switch rock

[Chorus]8x

[Swizz]
Hold on dog
Who want some of this, gun right here
All y'all clown niggas put your hands in the air
Is it you over there? Is it you over there?
Is it you, is it you, is it you right there?
Nigga, this ain't that shit that you used to bounce to
This that thing that you smoke a ounce to
I'm gonna do it, even without you
I pop all them clown niggas around you
This for my playas thats swingin the 4-4
Wildin out, bustin at po-po
Comin over here, you got to go yo
Y'all think y'all got beats it's so so
Swizz fallen off, nigga thats oh no
Y'all remain let the dogs go
Listen y'all I stick in the streets like cleetes
Y'all niggas know Swizz Beats uhh

[Chorus]8x

[Eve]
Yo, yo ,yo
Nigga pack up, watch a pro player get her stack up
Cowards in my way any second then he plaqued up
Dogs all behind me roll out, section racked up
Simple situation blown away cause you backed up
Watch out now know you heard about the Ruff ryde
Deaded at the door watch the floor, who the tough guy?
Brick house run 'em down knwo what we about shut 'em down
Keep these niggas like "Here she comin now"
Yo in public yo I'm evil
Fuck wit only people that I know thats my peoples
The fake shit I see through
Hated just to be you cause faggots is lame
Get fucked say "Gettin fucked" nigga why change?
It's anotha that was sweet takin out
Anotha that I peep fakin out
Tryin to take the easy route
A yo look I hold it down got my back while we ride
It's over for you fake ass bitches come on and hide
Swizz!!

[Chorus]
