[Intro: Angie Stone & Alicia Keys]
Alicia Keys on the remix
Roll with Collangi for life (Yeah, ha, ha)
Alicia (Say what, Angie?)
Eve (Come on, Angie)
Roll with a sista for a brotha (O.K.)

[Verse 1: Angie Stone & Alicia Keys]
He is my king, he is my one, my father, my son
He understands just what I am, he's my man
I'm here to show ya nuthin' but love for ya
Let a sista glow you
My brotha, brotha, brotha, brotha
He's my support system, he likes his soul sista
And I can't live without him
I love his lips, his kiss, his touch and his smile
That love is legendary, his love is necessary
I want him with me daily
I just want the world to know about my...

[Bridge: Eve]
Come on, yo!
I'm a hold down my soldier, weight of the world on his shoulders
Be real who else gon hold the

'Course I'll never leave speak in tongues when he rolls deep
All I need is him, how he pull me in?
Rough and rugged daddy do me right no refusin him
Some they like to call him criminal cause of his style
Hustler, caged by the world so he live wild
Gotta stay strong cause we they backbone
And if a chicken try to creep then your coop she get slapped on
It's the reality, what's mine is mine
And look but don't touch until I resign and
Everything I need in him, I fiend for him
Fights the heavy knight, see the way I adore him
He never go nowhere without her, he gotta keep her
This is a dedication for me Angie and Alicia to my
