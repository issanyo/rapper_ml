I'm a boozer, I open my eyes
To see a loser in the mirror I sigh
I see a boozer
I'm a loser

Take the curtain and open it now
Because it's certain you will forget now
That you're a boozer
And a loser

Oh, what a beautiful day
The sun in the sky, the children that play
Oh, oh, oh, oh, what a beautiful day
Go take me up high and let's fly away

Oh, what a beautiful day
The sun in the sky, the children that play
Oh, oh, oh, oh, what a beautiful day
Go take me up high and let's fly away

How funny, funny
Yeah, yeah, it's sunny, sunny
Oh, oh, oh, what a beautiful day
The children that play

I'm a teaser for myself I'm a teaser
And a squeezer for my half I'm so glad
That you release me
While you please me

I see a flower in the morning dew
And all the hours I think of now
We didn't see it
Didn't feel it

Oh, what a beautiful day
The sun in the sky, the children that play
Oh, oh, oh, oh, what a beautiful day
Go take me up high and let's fly away

Oh, what a beautiful day
The sun in the sky, the children that play
Oh, oh, oh, oh, what a beautiful day
Go take me up high and let's fly away

How funny, funny
Yeah, yeah, it's sunny, sunny
Oh, oh, oh, what a beautiful day
The children that play

Oh, what a beautiful day
The sun in the sky, the children that play
Oh, oh, oh, oh, what a beautiful day
Go take me up high and let's fly away

Oh, oh, oh, oh, what a beautiful day
The children that play

Oh, what a beautiful day
Go take me up high and let's fly away
