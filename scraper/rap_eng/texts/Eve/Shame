[Verse 1: Jill Scott]
I'm the one you really want but you just can't see it
I tried and tried to make you understand, don't believe it
It's a shame, you're missing out on a good thing, oh, oh
And it's a shame you can't see a damn thing, ah huh

[Verse 2: Jill Scott]
Well, well
What you scared of me, for? I'm just a woman
Maybe I got it all together like you think
Maybe I do 'cause yo, I'm fresh and cool

[Hook: Jill Scott & The A Group]
I can fend on my own, I'm magnificent
I'm a queen on my throne, I'm magnificent
I'm the magnificent, say what, say what
I'm the magnificent, say what, say what

[Verse 3: Jill Scott]
You're standing 'gainst the wall, baby, why you fronting?
When you could take my hand
And we could get into something
It's a shame, you're missing out on me
And it's a shame, you don't even know my name

[Hook: Jill Scott & The A Group]
I can fend on my own, I'm magnificent
I'm a queen on my throne, I'm magnificent
I'm the magnificent, say what, say what
I'm the magnificent, say what, say what

[Bridge: The A Group]
I'm your sunshine and your rain
My heart it doesn't tire, my love remains
Why you can't see me? Why you playing?
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, yeah

[Verse 4: Eve]
Uh aiyo
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style, yes
Check her head to toe, don't forget the smile, 'Blessed'
If you were smart you would try to snatch it up
Moving like a snail when you 'gon catch it up
Be on it 'cause I'm bored laughing
'Cause you just a clown now
Ain't worthy of the queen, papi, bow down
Really bow out, how does that sound?
Had a chance in the past, fall back down
I mean way back like disappear
I see through all of you and it's so clear
And I'm so good, how you so whack?
How you let this get away? You gon' regret that
Shorty so live from the 2-1-5
And you was too late, now I'm saying bye bye

[Outro]
And it's a shame, it's a shame
And it's a shame you're missing out on me
And it's a shame you can't see a damn thing
Uh huh
