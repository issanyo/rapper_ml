Looking like u glued to your chair
It's a party going on in here
Don't u dare leave no stay
I just wanna boogie baby
Just take your time and ease your mind
And Let the rhythm take control

[Chorus]
You need to get on…get on the dance floor
Cuz im gonna rock yo body baby
Lemme rock yo body baby
Girl just get on…get on the dance floor
Just lemme rock yo body baby
Ima rock yo body on the dance floor

I don't know whos gonna let you see
MJ and Usher got nothing on me
And I know you can move yo thang mama

And you just where ill be
I just wanna boogie baby (yeah)
Just take your time and ease your mind (ease your mind girl)
I just wanna mooove

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
Are you looking stop looking
Just meet me on the floor
Know you thinking if you moving
You know you want some more
If you trust me just trust me
We'll rock right out the door
Girl such a beautiful night started on the dance floor

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
