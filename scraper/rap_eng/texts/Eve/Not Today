Uh, this is another one of those heartbreak hotel joints
For the ladies, uh, mmm, ooh, hmm

[Mary]
Why won't you grow up and be a man someday
I can't believe that you're still playing silly games
Now why do I put up with all this child's play
Now if your word is all you have then you ain't worth a damn thang

[Mary]
Promises, you told me everyday (yeah, hmm)
That you made, you never ever cared (ooh yeah)
Not with me, I really want to believe
Well not today (mm, not today), not today (not today, ooh)

[Mary]
You're the worst, I can't even depend on you
You say I'm not a good thing, but something else you always do
Be a man of your word, try to love something of loving you
But now you can be on your way, cos I don't want you (promises)

[Eve]
Promises bout a house
Bout the kids, lifestyle, we would live
Who the fuck you really is
In my face all the time spittin line after line
Broke down my wall and you got in my mind
You's a fake should a known
All the signs I was shown
Can't believe what I saw and your cover was blown
Break up, leave
Make up, please
You's a magician all them tricks up your sleeve
Had me for a minute, I was in it
You played good
But I'm a bitch you gotta get it so I make moves
And I'm a leave you where you at, dog, chill
Go back to square one, wait for something real, huh
Selfish nigga, coulda helped you nigga
Usually know better but I felt you nigga
I guess gettin in my head was a part of the plan
Cos in reailty the only thing you giving me is

[Mary]
Promises, you told me everyday (that you told me everyday, everyday)
That you made, you never ever cared (you never, never, never)
Not with me, I really want to believe (never cared)
Well not today (not today), not today (not today, babe)

[Mary]
Promises, you told me everyday (that you told me everyday)
That you made, you never ever cared (you never, never, never, never cared)
Not with me, I really want to believe (I really, really, really)
Well not today (not today), not today (not today, ooh)

[Mary]
Don't let him waste your time girl (don't let him waste your time girl)
He's only telling lies girl (he's only telling some lies to you)
When he apologizes (and he will, he will)
Don't even leave ? a ? (ooh)
Cos he will do it again

[Mary]
Promises, you told me everyday (ooh you told me everyday)
That you made, you never ever cared (you never, never, never cared)
Not with me, I really want to believe (I really want to believe)
Well not today (not today), not today (not today)
Ohhh
