Chorus: Lady look I'm tryna figure you out (OK)
I'm tryna find out what you all about (Yeah)
Baby girl I wanna get in ya head (My head?)
Damn is you everything that you said? (No Doubt)
Mean no harm. I admire ya style (Hmm)
Just take a second baby here me out
I know ya game you tryna make me shout
Yo look I'm just tryna figure you out

He approached me boldly. Said he felt me said I'm lookin lonely
I had to stop 'em. Tell him daddy chill cause you don't know me
He said listen ma mean no harm
Just wanna let you know my story yo, don't be alarmed
Usually I'm like the bitchy type
I'm quick to hit 'em wit a 'Ha yeah, ok aight'
'What's ya name again?'
But I was feelin dude
And to my surprise for once I wasn't being rude
Had these eyes that'll make you melt
So what its corny. That's the way I felt
Had this body not a big deal but it helped
I mean this nigga had some shit wit 'em
And everytime I tried to talk
He grabbed my hand and said sweetheart just listen

Chorus

Felt like I was little. Got me back to shy days
Is he being real or is he comin at me sideways?
Said he want a build wit me. I'm like here we go
Said he was a regular nigga that liked my flow
Confidence is key wit me so I let him go on
Casanova sayin shit like damn you got a glow on
I'm like he did his homework knowin what I like
Can't find nothin wrong on 'em and he might be my type
Continued wit his story bout his 3 years in jail
How he missed the streets cause being in there was like hell
Bout his little daughter Kira center of his world
His princess and she know she daddy's little girl
I'm lookin at his face-I looked at my watch
He smiled said he wished that time would stop
I apologized to 'em cause I didn't mean to be rude
He said 'I know you busy. Just really wanted to meet you.'

Chorus

Asked me if I had a man I said that I didn't
Wanted to know if he could be that wit my permission
Told 'em that I wasn't ready. He said 'Yeah right'
Told me that I need a real nigga in my life
I agreed wit 'em. Told him that'll come soon
Let him know that I enjoyed the talk but had to run soon
He asked when's the last time I took time for me?
And if I ever reflected on how shit could be
He told me I was blessed. I said 'Dog I know it'
He said just a reminder. Feel that way and never blow it, huh
Slipped me his number said use it for inspiration
Kissd my cheek and whispered thank you for your conversation, huh
