Na na na na na, oh (uh uh) [4x]
[Eve]
Yo, you was the last dude
I thought I'd be attached to
Caught me off guard
Started feelin' on my tatoo
Lower back
Then you whispered in my ear
I don't want to scare you
But I think that we should disappear
Homie, we ain't known each other very long
Now you trying to lock me in the room, trying to turn me on
Any other time, I could resist
Now my will is gone
Getting weak, that ain't E-V-E
Hell, it's going on
Oh, I'm tryin' to let it go
Tryin' to keep my eyes closed
Tryin' to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't want to tell you what it is
Ooh wee, it felt so serious
Got me thinkin' just too much
I wanna shout it out but...

[Chorus]
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (you did)
This one thing that so made me feel it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
Hey, we don't know each other well
So what? I keep thinking to myself
Memories, just keep ringing bells
Oh-wo-wo-wo-wo (ding-ding, ding-ding, ding)
Hear voices, I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clickin' towards your door
Oh-wo-wo-wo-wo (ding-ding, ding-ding, ding)

[Chorus]
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (you did)
This one thing that so made me feel it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
And maybe I just can't believe it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
I can't deny, tired of tryin'
Nothin left to do but to keep on seeing you
I'm hopin' you can keep a secret
(For me, for me, for me)
Look what you did, yeah

[Chorus]
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (you did)
This one thing that so made me feel it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh-wo-wo-wo-wo, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I can't help to simply agree)
Oh-wo-wo-wo-wo, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (It's just, I don't know, it's there)
Oh-wo-wo-wo-wo, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I don't want to fight it)
Oh-wo-wo-wo-wo, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Eve]
Slipped up, let you in my space
Got it chicksed up
Close my eyes, see your face, that's a bit much
I ain't the type to get strung all out
Now when I sit and dial your number, got my tounge all out
Wouldn't never tell you though, almost, cause I would never show
Gotta keep it to myself, gotta keep it low
You got me trippin', who you thought it would be?
Keep it knockin' with E-V-E & Amerie, c'mon
(Oh-Oh, Don't know what it is...)

[Chorus]
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (you did)
This one thing that so made me feel it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did, oh, oh, ooh, oh
Oh [4x til fade]
