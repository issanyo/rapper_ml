[Intro- Eve]
Uh, what? What? Huh

[Chorus- Eve]
My enemies, my enemies
All of y'all is my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Fuck y'all niggas, my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Playa-hataz, my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Fuck y'all niggas, my enemies

[Verse 1- Eve]
Yo, yo, yo
Crackass can't bother me
Watch me get money with the double R team
Niggas be schemin' about robbin' me
Chicks mad they ain't got this job like me
Money makin' bitch called E-V-E
Million dollar itch, nigga can't stop me
Used to be broke and you used to love me
On tour, now you don't fuck with me

[Chorus- Eve]
My enemies, my enemies
All of y'all is my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Fuck y'all niggas, my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Playa-hataz, my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Fuck y'all niggas, my enemies

[Verse 2- Eve]
Uh, uh, huh, huh
Yo, yo, yo
Up late night, wanting to sleep
Thoughts of cats on their late night creeps
Cause of my relations with some one on peep
You should've kept it real and you would've been with me
You're still on the corner with Smoke and them
Still makin' plans about smokin' them
Stupid, running around and be poking them
Could've been on stage and not smoking dope with them

[Chorus- Eve]
My enemies, my enemies
All of y'all is my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Fuck y'all niggas, my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Playa-hataz, my enemies
My enemies, my enemies
Fuck y'all niggas, my enemies

[Bridge- Eve]
You wanna fuck, you wanna fuck, you wanna fuck
But you can fuck Eve
You wanna fuck, you wanna fuck, you wanna fuck
But you can fuck Eve
