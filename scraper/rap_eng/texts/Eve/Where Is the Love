Everybody is having sex these days like sex is going out of style
You know what I'm saying
Nobody is in love any more
You know what I'm saying
Once upon a time, you had to meet both of a girlâ€™s grandmothers before you could get it
You know what I'm saying, now a days it's like you can fall and slip and land in some
(what kinda loosey goose dat)

[Hook (Eve)]
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love
You said that you love me
Oh what happened to the love

[Verse 1]
And there is a rather large population
Of hole sale suppliers
Dat might as well hand out fliers
Some gyals nowa days give you
Faster than preyers
And there is no love
Mama always told from the age of ten
She can't be my girl
If she can't be my friend
Fi think some gyal love man
Just for money for spend
I'm hurt my love
What about di youths dem
Weh love fi breed off the girls
And still nah care for da youth dem
Wahapn to the boots dem
And hear wah mek go worse
Nuff a dem did have and nah use dem
Fire fi di bait who love using the girls
So friend can congratulate dem
Rasta nah rate dem
When dem abusing di girls
Gun shot for bwoy weh ah rape dem

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Some gyal like the hour of talking before dem will mek you shoot it
Meanwhile some gi ya anywhere the car is parking
Some only when secluded
Well some gyal put themselves on the market
Pum pum fit to suited
With di more expensive packages marking
Batteries not included
Some bwoy shoot wild like machine gun cupid
Just cause dap and doop did
And still don't have no one to call there own
Don't you think that's kinda stupid
Some bwoy have dem weak
And that's why dem can't refuse it
And dem think with dem john every day of the week
Well some fool better mind dem loose it

[Hook]

[Verse 3 (Eve)]
Ayo, some take life for granted
Some don't understand it
The way we living is outlandish
Sex, they oughta ban it
Sometimes I think niggas lay down with any type of female
Blame it on the drink
Scream I love you like it ain't an issue to diss you
Wanna make love but he can't kiss you
I wish you cats would understand procreation
Instead of using it for recreation
I mean, it's just my obligation
Plenty of kids running 'round without their daddy
Plenty of hungry mothers tricking, kids be looking shabby
And they only trying to make ends meet
Plenty of struggling mothers scrubbing toilets, scraping up the bottoms of their feet
What we need is more conscious people
Need to teach the world their children need you
And cats be at the people like they never knew their problem's here
And on the real this is a problem that we all share
Come on

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
How some gyal head so light
It must the altitude
How some gyal get so bright
Within their attitude
Why some gyal wanna wuk
Down the multitude
Don't they know their the mothers of
Aahhhhhh
Respect to the ladies
Weh care the youths
And all of the ladies
Weh bare the youths
Single parents wid no one
To contribute
She goin 5 months and over
Aahhhhhh
All of the ladies
Weh face the truth
Even when belly bigger
Than a pumpkin fruit
And still no one there yet
To contribute
She goin 9 months all over
Aahhhhhh
Why some parents
Don't hear di youths
Why some parents
Don't prepare di youths
And why some parents
Must fear the youths
From all ten years and over
Aahhhhhh

[Hook]
