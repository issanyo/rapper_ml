[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Remix!

[Chorus: Cainon Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dinin' room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better

[Interlude: Lil Kim]
Lil Kim!
And you can not be me, no never
Ain't got to explain why I'm better
Your man is a dog
He chase my kitty and he say my pussy is wetter
Hooooooool' up, remix!

[Chorus: Cainon Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dinin' room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance (Woo!)
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better

[Verse 1: Lil Kim]
Lil Kim!
You can not be me, no never
Ain't got to explain why I'm better
Your man is a dog
He chase my kitty and he say my pussy is wetter
Me and Missy be high in them choppers
Landin' on hundred foot yachts
In Giuseppe heels, I kick in the door
Wavin' the 4 like I am Big Poppa
I'm better, I'm better, Balmain be the leather
My watch is so icy, if I walk outside in the summertime
I just might change the weather
I'm done with the Benz so I bought a Wraith
I don't trust the bank so I bought a safe
This fur on me like I fought a ape
I'm killin' 'em, yellow tape

[Chorus: Cainon Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dinin' room (Hoooooool' up!)
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better (Remix!)

[Bridge: Cainon Lamb]
I wake up, I wanna dance
I wake up, I wanna dance (dance)
I wake up, I wanna dance (dance)
Dance, d-d-dance
I wake up, I wanna dance
I wake up, I wanna dance (dance)
I wake up, I wanna dance (dance)
Dance, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better

[Verse 2: Trina]
Trina!
Yeah, I'm better, I'm better than them
And I get wetter than them
And fuck where you've been
Get too much cheddar for him
I set the bar and them bitches only settin' trends
I put the pressure on them
Still ain't turn into a diamond
I got the Midas, billionaire minded
Seat's on recline and I'm gettin' some head
Right in back of the pilot
Switchin' up pilots, damn and I'm shinin'
All my bitches with me, 305's finest
Don't come around us if you ain't 'bout commas
Commas, commas, commas, commas
Show you how to hit a lick
Collect the profit, watch it flip
(He watchin' my body like he watchin' Scandal
But I'm just yeah) Never front, so you spend

[Chorus: Cainon Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dinin' room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better

[Verse 3: Eve]
Eve!
I've been away, I'm so anti
Winnin' in life by a landslide
I know you see me, you see me
Your chick wanna be me
But she can never be me, no
Man I'm too stuck in my ways
Countin' this money for days
Life is so good, it feel good
No worries with all of these foreigns up in my driveway
I ain't got no time for no dumb shit
A lot of y'all be on some bum shit
First I got my D's up, then I got my pounds up
What you been talkin' ain't addin' up
March to the beat of my own drum
Philly to London conundrum
I've been this way, baby since the first day
But they keep askin', "Where the fuck does she come from?"
I'm better

[Chorus: Cainon Lamb]
I'ma start it from the bottom
Show you how to flip a dollar
I got food in my dinin' room
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
It's another day, another chance
I wake up, I wanna dance
So as long as I got my friends...
I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
