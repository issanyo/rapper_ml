You, me and she
What we gone do baby, baby

Yo, I did it to myself
Couldn't help the way I felt about him
Sick when he wasn't there
Like I never dealt with out him
Played the fool by choice
All I had was this man
Let him have the best of both worlds
Cuz it was his plan
All the things I wanted to hear
He told me gently
What ever it was nothing gave me plenty
Told me he split with this chic
But couldn't shake her
Cuz she had his child
So he fed her with his paper
First it started off like that dough for closure
Started slackin off
In fact, it wasn't over
Now my world is crumbling down
I'm feeling shaky
Used to be a Super woman
No bitch could replace me
Wanted him to leave me alone
But I was caught up
Thought I was strong
Broke down when breaking up was brought up
Tried to really ride with this dude
I thought I loved him and
Everytime I asked what I should do
He said trust him!

Chorus:
You me and she
What we gone do baby ( trust me) baby( hold me)
You me and she
What we gone down baby(believe me ) baby (you need me)

Damn, I must be crazy
Feedin into bullshit
Attitude and trying to hold out
That shit was useless
The more I tried to back up the more he kept coming
Lie after lie
Shit lying wasn't nothing
Tear after tear
Telling me to be cool
All I need is you baby
Nobody can be you
Believed him
He decived me just to keep me
Calling me from her spot
Saying that he needs me
I had to step back
He got me stressed out
This ain't what I planned
Thought I had me sketched out
I guess not
Love me to hurt me
Hurt me to make up and
Make up to desert me

Chorus
You me and she
What we gone do baby ( trust me) baby( hold me)
You me and she
What we gone down baby(believe me ) baby (you need me)

Back and forth
With the he said, she said
Got me dizzy
If I leave know the routine
He beg cuz he miss me
To late cuz you had me lost me (daddy)
Move on
Boss bitch
No more floss me nigga
I'm gone
Arguements for hours
Me and her comparing notes and
After all the screaming stopped
We comparing quotes (yea)
You got sloppy
Thought you wasn't the nigga to let me catch you
Heart didn't hurt till I covered up your tattoo
My statue on a padestal every breath too
Never knew the worst
Till you felt what the best do
And i'm that
It's over now
Hope I stressed you
But niggas only do what we allow and I let you

Chorus:
3X
