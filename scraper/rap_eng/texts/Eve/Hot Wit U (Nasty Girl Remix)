I wanna get hot wit U
Get U underneath the cream and ooh
Get U doin' thangs U thought U'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot wit U

I want 2 get hot wit U
Wanna get U underneath the cream
And do the marshmallow
Ooh, I wanna get hot wit U
I wanna get U 2 do something
U thought U'd never do
Like dance in front of my headlights
On a hot summer night... NUDE
I wanna get hot wit U

I want 2 get hot wit U
Make U climb this chain around my waist
So I can prove that I'm the only one that brings out
The freak in U... I want 2 get hot wit U

Eve's Rhyme:
Know the body bangin', got U singin'
No shouts from the neighbors, telephone ringin'
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine, now U know U can't stop her
Tryin' 2 turn me on - I never had this, so stop this
I'm supposed 2 tremble cuz they call U "the Artist"?
Let's wild out - can U handle ruff ridin'?
Treat U like the freak of the week
And had U hidin' from me
I do whatever U like, if U could take it
If I could b ur girlfriend, U could catch me naked
Can't front sexually, I'd like a sample
But I don't think that I'm ready
4 U 2 make me an example
I mean - come on - Y front on
I'd never place time - Queen of ur life

Meet me early mornin' in a 4th dimension plane
Astral travellin' hottie, I know U know my game
Underneath the cream I'll meet U
And then we'll rearrange everything U know of love
I'll give U reason 2 change

I wanna get hot wit U
I wanna steal a kiss in the middle of
An overcrowded room, yeah That's what I wanna do
I wanna get hot wit U

Take a drive 2 the ocean
And drown U in a wave of 100.000 compliments, boo
I want your every day 2 b cool
And the only way 2 do that is very night - get hot wit U
Yea, baby!
