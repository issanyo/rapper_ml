I used to give you too much power
Trust me, them days is over
Can't understand how I
Let you sit on my shoulders
Them times when you messed up
I made escuses for
And I always knew it, that I should have headed for the door
But I stayed and you played the right way in your place
And I prayed everytime you was away you'd see my face
But the me was you, and your
Pain was mine, and the
Same situation playing over in my mind
It seems

Ain't tryna hear you
Just tryna hear me
Don't wanna hear nothing, baby it's selfishly
I blaming you for the hurt in me, but it's not your fault that
I'm so incomplete

You see everytime I do it do it
I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love
And it's effecting how I'm breathing
Effecting how I'm eating
Seems like I'm all up on drugs
So beg you my pardon
Loving you deep in my heart
And I can't take no more
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the seek
One thing I found, I had to take a look in mirror
See I can't leave you, until I learn to leave me...

What was I thinking
That you could talk to me like that
You was holding me down, but I was holding me back
Looking inside myself, and has to see who I am, cause this is my trial, affecting my smile
I'm gotta walk (? ), this is gonna be a while

You see everytime I do it do it
I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love
And it's effecting how I'm brething
Effecting how I'm eating
Seems like I'm all up on drugs
So beg you my pardon
Loving you deep in my heart
And I can't take no more
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the seek
One thing I found, I had to take a look in mirror
See I can't leave you, until I learn to leave me

Everything I thought I knew
All them times I ran away
You see, really I was running for me
I know constantly we're trying, we was living in a lie
Finally looked into mirror to see
Probably would have left you sooner, but I was being scared, that ain't how I ever should be
Yeah I was searching for a while for the sores of the problem
One thing I found, I had to take a look in the mirror
