(Sol Patches):
I know the sun is all rising
I’ve the seen the falling united
Pardon my heart in these planets
I’m trying to manage, the earth in my story
Polluting my roots, all that before me
I can see
What you doing to me?
Tell me!
Why you doing this to me?

The world look like
What my world does bite
All in my glory
Bloodied my friends so they can end
You told that me I can make it
Built me up from the ground
Held me up me up like would you smile
But ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone
And she’s always gone too long
Anytime she’s goes away

(Eve):
See the sunrise anew
Set to a purple moon
Rose petals and thorns
Pink light breaks thunderstorms
Only whips protect me
Stand alone, but I ain’t lonely
I strike hard 'til bloody knuckles
Break the glass in front of me
I don’t touch breaks
My life’s at stake
Wide eyes, I’m awake

(Sol Patches and Eve):
Fly, fly, fly, fly
Why don’t you
Spread your wings?

(Sol Patches):
I gave love, apart from the medals
I never exploited your heart for a marriage
Remember when my dark thoughts inherited
All the sunshine?
Burning the asparagus
Chopping the roses
Planted - An ocean
Drowned: my hope
With all that you fire
Why you doing this to me?
Tell me!

Time was always slicker than you
Slowly, slowly remember the tune
This city I am raised me with the force of Hades
My love for it breeds corpses of babies
With movies claiming they
The ones who can save me
You talk dark thoughts
But aim for the chart
Yelling that the sun is all rising
Yelling that the sun is all rising
But you're the one
Disguised and hiding
But you're the one
Disguised and hiding

(Sasha NoDisco):
Every day I, day I, day I
Wake up just in time (time)
Scre-scre-screaming
For the su sun shine (shine)
Every day I, day I, day I
Wake up just in time (time)
Scre-scre-screaming
For the su-sun shine (shine)
(Ohh, ohhh)

It's alright I say
It's alright I say
I said I’ll stay, I’ll stay, I’ll stay
So you can go, go
It's alright I say
It's alright I say
I said I’ll stay, I’ll stay, I’ll stay
So you can go, go
So you can go, go

(Sol Patches and Eve):
Fly, fly, fly, fly
Why don’t you
Spread your wings?

Fly, fly, fly, fly
Why don’t you
Spread your wings?
