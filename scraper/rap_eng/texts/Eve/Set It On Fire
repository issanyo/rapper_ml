Set it on fire, fire, fire, fire, fire

Uh yeah, if you came to play our game
Make me say a lot of things I never face
Still tryin' to catch up, chasin' me for days
I'll be in the fast lane, you'll be up away

What we do we see each other and no play
Still got the mask, they break jaws but no face
Brand new, think breakin' laws is okay

Talkin' shit are only get you blown away
So take my advice stay fare, this fame, you'll never want that
In and out, no trace like that
Know you'll feel the heat your on back, come on

Listen, I gets time when the clock is moved next to movin' lights
Drownin' at the sounds of the crowd but they're in placed safe
Steppin' on the fire, fire, fire till it explode

Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire
Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire, fire till it explode

Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey yo, hip hop dead and I'm revivin'
Contagious flow call poison madman
Everybody doing it, Jersey to tight Tee
Followin' the transam never excite me

Always a leader and the rest to follow
Short [Incomprehensible] as well as the bible
Maybe are called but few are chosen
You know it's will if Eve is spoken

You know it's get crazy when the lights go out
You better be prepared for different route
The heat keeps comin', you better start runnin'
The way that they aimin' that thing, you can't stop them

You know it's get crazy when the lights go out
You better be prepared for different route
The heat keeps comin', you better start runnin'
The way that they aimin' that thing, you can't stop them

Listen, I gets time when the clock is moved next to movin' lights
Drownin' at the sounds of the crowd but they're in placed safe
Steppin' on the fire, fire, fire till it explode

Listen, I gets time when the clock is moved next to movin' lights
Drownin' at the sounds of the crowd but they're in placed safe
Steppin' on the fire, fire, fire till it explode

Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire
Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire

Listen, I gets time when the clock is moved next to movin' lights
Drownin' at the sounds of the crowd but they're in placed safe
Steppin' on the fire, fire, fire till it explode

Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire
