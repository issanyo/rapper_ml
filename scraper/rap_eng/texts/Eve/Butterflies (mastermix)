Butterflies

All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

I just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
I just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i

If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
I just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i

I just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
I just wanna touch and kiss and i wish that i could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
