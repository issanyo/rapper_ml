[Hook]
They’re like
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad

[Verse 1]
Yeah, that’s right, I’m badder than them
E-V-E, the cataclysm
Blow 'em out the fucking water
Kill ‘em dead, called a slaughter
Ain’t my fault, I had it built up
Had to get it out my system
Now I’m back, forget about them other chicks, man, you won’t miss ‘em
Yeah, E-V-E hungry like a lion
I ain’t never easy
Never scared, why you tryin'?
Your gimmick make me sicky
What you're sellin' I ain't buyin'
Man, I live up at the top so you keep climbin'
No they can never catch-a
Me, I’m the chick that keep ‘em under pressure
And every nigga smell her wanna sex her
They say they won't protect her
But really they just wan' kiss and caress her
Now sit your ass down
Cause class is now in session

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When they see me comin' at ‘em
Heels and hips, they wanna grab ‘em
Lips and now I'm starin' at ‘em
Mesmerized, gotta have it
Warning, I've become a habit
Need it, always once you had it
Ever lucky enough to grab it
Guaranteed you're becomin' an addict
Yeah, the type of chick that like them big trips
Big jets, mega yachts, yeah, big ships
Wanna get all my affection, here’s a big tip
I need to see that you a ball ship
Man, I ain’t playin' with you people
You know my style already scorpion, she stings, she lethal
I ain’t even got no patience for your bullshit I can see through
I get bored real easy
Sorry, I must leave you
Got ‘em singin' like

[Hook] x2

[Break]
You know my style already scorpion, she stings, she lethal
You know my style already scorpion, she stings, she lethal
You know my style already scorpion, she stings, she lethal
You know my style already
You know my style already
You know my style already

[Hook] x2
