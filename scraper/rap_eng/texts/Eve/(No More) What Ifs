[Intro: Eve]
Uh-huh, come on
E-V-E, y'all
Natasha Bedingfield
Let's go, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Natasha Bedingfield]
All the could bees buzzin' 'round
My mind a thousand tiny clouds
And now I cannot see the sun
All the worries on my list
Rush like lemmings off a cliff
I'm powerless to save even one

[Pre-Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
All my friends tell me I'm thinkin' too much
It's not over 'til it's over
Because today is trouble enough
Leave tomorrow 'til tomorrow

[Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
I'm not jinxing what could be
Second guessin' what I see
There is you and there is me
And no what ifs
Not crossin' fingers, knockin' wood
'Cause worryin' about it could
Spoil the moment when it's good
No more what ifs, could be's, one day's, if only's

[Verse 2: Natasha Bedingfield]
The intro's looping on and on
Don't really get to feel the song
When it's only playing in my head
If I don't listen with my heart
Trust my instincts from the start
Then I'm as dumb as dumb can get
So I'm not jinxing

[Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
I'm not jinxing what could be (no, no)
Second guessin' what I see
There is you and there is me (and there is me)
And no what ifs
Not crossin' fingers, knockin' wood
'Cause worryin' about it could
Spoil the moment when it's good
No more what ifs, could be's, one day's, if only's

[Verse 3: Eve]
Looked in my eyes, made my heart skip
Knew I wouldn't take no from there
Only right that we would start this
I'm not really sure what we would call it
But let's not give it names, wouldn't care
You're mine regardless, I'm all in
Baby in the crib, look at how we livin'
Happily forever after that's just what it is
And I know I shouldn't do that, I'm only causin' stress
I know I should just let it flow, I know that's for the best
And trust, I'm tryin' y'all tryna stop my brain from
Makin' up a future that could cause me pain
So, I'mma a get my head out the fantasy
All we got is now and it's good
I ain't gonna let it bother me

[Bridge: Natasha Bedingfield]
I'm thinking too much
It's not over, 'til it's over
Because today is trouble enough
Leave, leave tomorrow 'til tomorrow, 'til tomorrow

[Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
I'm not jinxing what could be (no, no)
Second guessin' what I see
There is you and there is me (and there is me)
And no what ifs
Not crossin' fingers, knockin' wood
'Cause worryin' about it could
Spoil the moment when it's good
No more what ifs, could be's, one day's, if only's
No more what ifs, could be's, one day's
No more what ifs, could be's, one day's
What ifs, could be's, if only's
No more what ifs, could be's, one day's, if only

[Outro: Natasha Bedingfield]
What if I lost you with all these what ifs?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if
