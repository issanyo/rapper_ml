[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate

[Verse One]
Some days I be wanting to get away from it all
To be real this game ain't all it seem to y'all
I mean I'm blessed by my good God
Haaa, that's no question
And I know my journey long
Just a life learned lesson
But the world just a mess right now, going crazy
Thankful for my single mother
Strong how she raised me
Could have gave up long time
And been lazy
But my dream strong
Hear this song I'm not complaining
Just the realization living in this world is draining
I mean I cry real tears and I got real fears
Wanna marriage and some babies
Do y'all hear me in your ears?
Discouraging, keep your courage and walk your path
Question everyday how much longer will we last?
How can you apologize for mankind?
No heart, so soul got sight, but you're the man blind
Not really seeing what he doing to the future
He lost

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]

[Verse Two]
Love, hate, pain all the same
Still took for granted
Need a reason that's to blame
Gone cause he loved her
Gone cause she hated him
Flipped out taken out from the pain
Who she datin him?
Its like we don't have no meaning
What we breathing for?
Birth child raised right gone now fighting for the war
Damn, enough to make you crawl up in a shell
Cry for the innocent babies in this Hell
Stuck from a fast fuck no shelter from the cold
Drugs and disease never growing to be old
Do you feel me?
Am I seeing all this by myself?
Can't trust the air I breathe
Im praying for my health
Wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow
I said I wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]

[Verse Three]
Sometimes my heart hurt
Wish I could take away the pain with music
But it won't work
I guess I'm just an optimist
What's it gonna take for all of us to stand up
Put a stop to this?
Man, we in this thing together
Live and breathe together
Everybody love life
But never make it better
Everybody talk shit
But never get together
Shit, I ain't trying to preach
I ain't even teaching
There's some shit bottled up inside me
Im just speaking
Wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow
I said I wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow
