I'm talkin' packs out the back do, standin over black stoves
Cook it till bubble double even when it trap slow
Rizzle got couple what the fuck I wanna rap fo
What you think I'm strapped fo what I gotta scrap fo
Had my son mak'em wonder if I'm asshole cocaine veins herion hard and crack flows
I'm filthy rich I ain't get time to relax though
Unless I'm in a Phantom wit the automatic back do
Triple Black filled wit Hispanic and Black hoes
On a back road got'em blowin like Satch Mo
You can ask Dro if Young Pimpin'll let the make go
And even Mac know I ain't far from Puffy and Shaq though

Aye, instead of hatin cause you ain't me
I figured you would've thanked me
For doin what you didn't and bein everything we can't be
Representin the A and still spittin like Yankee
Ball hard enough to make a hater wanna shank me
Iced out the crown and flooded the Franck Muller
I'm lightin up the town you outta think my jeweler
I told'em listen ma'am you ain't thinkin this is peculiar
And I don't want nan if I can't have the two of ya

[Eve]
Yo, Yo, You can't act act crazy thinkin it's a game
But it's too clear gimmicks in yo lane
Tricks it's ova this is my year
Hate to say my name out yo mouth but you have too
No other chick is out there fly enuff you can attach to
Man they love to hate damn they can't escape me
Floatin in a mansion on the ocean can't take me
Sick cause she came back hotter than before
It was time for her thanks for feelin in now be gon yea
