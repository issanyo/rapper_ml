[Intro Hook - Gabe Saporta]
When I close my eyes
I can see me fly in the hope
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back if I get chance
Oh, I won't come back around

[Verse 1 - Eve]
Yo, have you ever laid in bed and it's late in the night
Staring at the ceiling talking to God about life
Asking when it's gonna happen, just maybe it might
Made a lot of life turns, some wrong and some right
Wanna know when it's your second, your minute, your time
Sick of dreaming, wanna lay the pictures in your mind
Never been like all the others, you're one of a kind
I know you're feeling like you wanna break free, it's a sign
Just wanna fly above it all, see where you can land
Know that you can do it on your own cause you can
Know that you can conquer all with a plan
Forget about the negatives buried in the sand
Yeah, never forget this is your life
Your path, your dream, this is your fight
Victory you'll see, you'll be alright
Get through the darkness, on the other end is pure light

[Hook]
When I close my eyes
I can see me fly in the hope
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back
If I get chance
I will come back around
If I make it out this time, yeah
I gotta make it out this time, yeah
I'm gonna make it out this time, yeah
I'm gonna roll the dice
And take a risk tonight
Gotta make it out this time

[Verse 2: Eve]
Have you ever felt alone like the whole world was missing
And when you prayed it seemed like no one was listening
You try to keep the faith and keep on living
But when you struggling the future looks distant
All your hope seem to be just pipe dreams
And you really gotta wonder what your life means
That's when you gotta pick yourself up out the dust
Make a change and find a place in your heart you trust
You ain't always gotta take the first card your dealt
In this life only you can represent yourself
Never let your circumstances hold you back
You were born free, never gotta feel trapped
And on the pursuit to happiness you're gonna feel pain
But the only way to win is to stay in the game
The naysayers they're gonna try and embarrass you
But I've learned that the struggle builds character

[Hook]

[Bridge - Eve]
Put your hands in the air now
If you feel it let me hear you loud
Put your hands in the air now
Yeah, ain't nobody gonna hold you down
Yeah, come on, come on

[Hook]
