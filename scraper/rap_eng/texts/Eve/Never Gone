[Intro: Eve]
Who’da ever thought it would be me
Talkin' to you about life, look at Eve-E
It been a lot of wrong and right, never easy
I’m trying to make it through, like you believe me

[Verse 1: Eve]
Ayo, every day it’s a struggle
Waking up, stressed emotions I juggle
As I look around and watch the world crumble
Something tell me, "Pray and always stay humble"
Yea, what doesn’t kill you only make you stronger
Stay chin up, hold on a little longer
They used to doubt me, and tell me I ain’t have a voice
But then the angel showed me a better choice
Never let the world tell me how I’m defined
I give myself credit, never need a co-sign
Some days I cry but then I think and realize
I’m a star, and damn it, I’ma shine
Show the world all the greatness that I possess
Gotta keep the pushin', keep on makin progress
If a beautiful rose can grow from concrete
Then there’s no reason for man to accept defeat

[Hook 1: Chrisette Michele]
Tell the world for me
Who’ll miss me when I’m gone
What’s a fight without defeat
What’s a day when there’s no Eve

[Hook 2: Chrisette Michele]
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone

[Verse 2: Eve]
Remember like a permanent scar
The feeling I had when you said I wouldn’t go far
I knew how to shine, but life kept me in the dark
Dreaming I’m the moon, ‘cause the world’s too hard
Goals with no plan, running through quicksand
Thought I’d go under, but I’m still breathing
Not afraid of war so I keep fighting
I’m worth a lifetime, no one nice in
So I go back to the lab again, grab me a pad and pen
Write a legacy for my children’s children
Build a world for everybody to live in
And who would me I’d gladly do it again
Wouldn’t believe, now I know that I’m chosen
And everyone that kept it G, I owe them
Treasure my heart, so I always stay golden
Live for the dream and I’m lovin' the moment

[Hook 1 & Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Eve]
Hey, there are many moments in life
That make you feel the only option maybe is to fight back
And it feel foreign to you, ‘cause you ain’t like that
Never let nobody steal your powers, snatch it right back
You gotta be the person you was born to be
I learned the only person I could control is me
And maybe they will see inside of me eventually
And even is they don’t you got the right to disagree
Now listen, I ain’t got the answers or the plan
Me, I’m trying to figure out, trying to understand
Trying to be the best woman I could be for man-kind
Love is to be shared so I give mine

[Bridge: Chrisette Michele]
I’ll go hard, I’ll go hard
And this time I won’t miss
I’ll go hard, I’ll go hard
On top of the world I’ll live

[Hook 1 & Hook 2]
