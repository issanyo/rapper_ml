I'm sittin' down in da corner
Chillin' with all my boys
Mr. Biggs is in the house

U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby, baby?

Get at the party, city of Venis

I did it to myself, couldn't help the way I felt about him
Sick when he wasn't there, like I never dealt without him
Played the fool by choice, all I had was this man
Let him have the best of both worlds 'cause it was his clan

All the things I wanted to hear, he told me gently
Whatever it was, wanted nothin', gave me plenty
Told me that he split with this chick but couldn't shake her
'Cause she had his kids so he fed her with this paper

First it started off like that, dough for closure
Started slackin' off, in fact it wasn't over
Now my world is crumblin' down, I'm feelin' shaky
Used to be a superwoman, no bitch could replace me

Wanted him to leave me alone but I was caught up
Thought I was strong, broke down when breaking up was brought up
Tried to really ride with this dude, I thought I loved him
And every time I asked what I should do, he said trust him

U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby?
(Trust me)
Baby
(Hold me, yeah)

U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby
(Believe me)
Baby
(Need me, yeah)

To hate, I must be crazy, feeding him the bullshit
Attitudes and tryin' to hold out that shit was useless
The more I tried to back up, the more he kept comin'
Lie after lie, shit, lying wasn't nothin'

Tear after tear come down, tellin' me to be cool
All I need is you, baby, nobody could be you
Believed him, he deceived me just to keep me
Callin' me from her spots sayin' how he need me

I had to step back, he got me stressed out
This ain't what I planned, thought I had my life sketched out
Huh, I guess not, love me to hurt me
Hurt me to make-up, then make-up to desert me

U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby?
(Trust me)
Baby
(Hold me, yeah)

U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby
(Believe me)
Baby
(Need me, yeah)

Back and forth with the he said, he said got me dizzy
If I leave, know the routine, he beg 'cause he miss me
Too late, 'cause you had me, lost me, daddy, move on
Boss-bitch, no more floss, nigga, I'm gone

Arguments for hours, me and her comparing notes and
After all the screamin' stop, we comparing quotes
You got sloppy thoughts, you was that nigga let me catch you
Heart didn't hurt till I covered up your tattoo

My statue on a pedestal, every breath too
Never knew the worst till you felt what the best do
And I'm that, it's over now, hope I stressed you
But Niggas only do it when you lie, when I let you
