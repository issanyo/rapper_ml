Plottin' ways to get in my mix
Boy, already there's a little spice in this

Uh, uh, yeah, turn the lights off, it's about to get plenty dark
You wasn't smart, you started fuckin' Ja with your heart
If I ripped it apart don't hate me, thank me baby
If my world was yours it would drive you crazy
Cuz I love what I do, like fuckin' you hoes and soon
Talk to your tears until you feel there's something to prove
And with nothing to lose I can see you being a tease
You fuckin' with me, just know we fuckin' for free

[Eve]
Yeah I know that you was lost, first bite had you tossed
E-V-E, caramel skin bitch cost
And before you stroke the kitty nigga better break off
Nigga wanna fuckin' run, better shake off
Show me something, diamonds and the furs ain't nothin'
Impress me, bless me with a Hummer, think I'm frontin'?
Big cat with the big gat ready to fuck
One nut you done screamin' damn baby I'm stuck

[Ja Rule]
Why in the world would you continue to run my way?
Got hit once, found out that I don't play
What the deal mami?
Who pushed you through the irony of
Fuckin' and suckin' me, splitin' the coke with me

[Eve]
Yeah you use to have me flippin'
All your ex-hoes had me bitchin'
