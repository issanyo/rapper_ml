[Verse 1]
Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
A lot of niggas is bitches, a lot of bitches be trippin'
A lot of them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lot of niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay (half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do (reality they can't)
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em (half the time I'm not)
It ain't nothin' new though (learned it from off the block)
People think I changed much 'cuz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad (most of the time I don't)
'Cuz if I don't protect my shit (other niggas won't)
Some want me to neglect my shit (take it for a joke?!)
But I'm stayin' on the grind (never goin' back to broke)

[Hook]
Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

[Verse 2]
Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
See how we do this thing, dog, here we go again
Dre and Bombshell, don't you love how it blend?
Radio stations, DJ's they spin
Told y'all determined to win
You tryna enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin', this whole shit is my shit, bitch, and I'm the captain
Can't beat me, join me, baby, then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whips to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends, "What they wanna do to me?"
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby, what's the deal? I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my wishin'

[Hook]
Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

[Bridge]
Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat y'all, it's like a magnet
I don't really mess wit too many 'cuz they be plastic
That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic
Anything less than a banger will not have it
Still, I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
But in the mean time, ball while we live the dream
And now I need to hear y'all sing

[Hook]
Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
