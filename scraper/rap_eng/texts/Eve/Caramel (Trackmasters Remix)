[Verse 1: Claudette Ortiz]
You can say I'm plain Jane, but it's not the same
I ain't into big names, but I like nice things
I watch boxin' matches and the football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress, but I love to sing
I like goin' out, takin' walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home and curl up next to ya
Though I'm ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm having sex with ya

[Refrain x2: Claudette & (Eve)]
Anywhere I go I'm spotted (no doubt)
And anything I want I got it (yeah)
5'5" with brown eyes (caramel complexion)
Smile like the sunrise (come on)

[Verse 2: Claudette Ortiz]
Baby look me in the eyes and tell me yeah
I'm the kind of girl you like, I'm feelin' you
Cause sweetie you're my kind of guy, that's what it is
Think about it you just might wanna run with this all night long
And if you want me we can keep this going
But let me tell you I'm the type that's strong
And I don't trust a lot of men, I'm independent
I ain't like some other women

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Eve]
I keep 'em mesmerized; listen to me closely
E-V-E is how a thoroughgood supposed to be
Hate the thirsty type, can't even get close to me
That's why I got my own stackdaddy; how it's supposed to be
I ain't about the game playin' and gift chasing
All in frontin' "Daddy, please be broke" big facin'
All the things I want I got, forget me not
Just from my stance, why you staring at me, got'chu hot
Not too many bitches like her, one of a kind
I ain't even in the bitch's life, she's just a dime
Not impressed by your Cris' popping
Cause if you would, I might end of the night we gon' be lip-lockin'
But only if I choose to; I don't fall in love easily
Heed 'em the blues boo
I had you sitting 'round misty-eyed
Caramel get 'em all the time; hot shit from City High

[Refrain x2]
