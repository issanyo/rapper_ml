Hot with you

I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with you
Take you upstairs to the fourteenth room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you

I wanna get hot with you [4x]

I want to get hot with you
I wanna get you underneath the cream
And do the marshmallow
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get you to do something
U thought you'd never do
Like dance in front of my headlights
On a hot summer night...nude
I wanna get hot with you

I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with you
Take you upstairs to the fourteenth room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you

I want to get hot with you
I wanna make you climb this chain around my waist
So I can prove that I'm the only one that brings out
The freak in you...
I wanna get hot with you

I wanna get hot with you [4x]

Know the body banging, got you singing
No shouts from the neighbors, telephone ringing
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine, now you know you can't stop her
Trying to turn me on - I never had this, so stop this
I'm supposed to tremble cuz they call you 'The Artist'?
Let's wild out - can you handle ruff riding?
Treat you like a freak of the week and had you hiding from me
I can do whatever you like, if you could take it
If I could be your girlfriend, you could catch me naked
Can't front sexually, I'd like a sample
But I don't think I'm ready for you to make me an example
I mean - come on - why front on
I'd never place time - queen in your life
I mean - will never
The days that you feeling for me...neutral
That I'm ready to call you daddy
Even get got with you

Meet me early morning in a fourth dimension plane
Astral traveling hottie, I know you know my game
Underneath the cream I'll meet you
And then we'll rearrange
Everything you know of love
I'll give you reason to change

Hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
(I wanna, wanna...)
I wanna get hot with you
(I want you)

I want to get hot with you
I wanna steal a kiss in the middle of an
Overcrowded room, yeah
That's what I wanna do, eye-eye
I wanna get hot with you
Hot with you, ooh

I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with you
Take you upstairs to the fourteenth room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you

Take a drive to the ocean
And drown you in a wave (Hot with you)
Of a hundred thousand compliments, boo
I want you every day (Hot with you)
And to be cool
And the only way to do that is every night (hot with you)
Get hot, get hot (Hot) with you (Hot)
Yeah baby

I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do (Never)
Make you suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with you
Take you upstairs to the fourteenth room (Oh, honey)
Multicolored lights and an ocean view (Can't you see)
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you

Hot with you
(I wanna get hot with you)

I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things (ooh) you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say "ooh" (ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you

Wanna get hot with you
