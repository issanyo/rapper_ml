[Hook x8]
Grind or die, gri-grind or die

[Verse 1]
Who you know gonna come better than me
Putting in work while the birds still sleep
Call me the best jump man; 23
Call the police cause I'm murdering beats
Nothing mediocre, tings always proper
Something like the kush, burned it up, they forgot
I got the game on smash and I'm up with the hammer
Have 'em all flabergasted, leaving with a ?
Out of this world, like deal in the party
All up in the ears, I'm dropping this knowledge
My buzz stay strong, your buzz never started
My albums are the shit, your career never farted
You thought I left, I wasn't gone, I'm just back again
I was overseas making them millions
From Belgium to Brickston, over to Japan
International paper, getting paid again

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
It's crunch time, my time, baby, I'ma get it
Heat it up, stir the pot, throw some Eve in it
Cook it up, serving fiends just a little bit
Having them addicted, better believe it
Tell them suckers go hard or go home
No surprise, make a claim to the throne
Time's up, kingdom overthrown
Make way, you catch it back to the dome
I can be sweet, got my lyrics steady man
Bodying these hoes, yellow tape at the scene
It is what it is, I'm a lyrical dream
Show some respect and bow down to the queen
I'm sitting pretty, Haute Couture Culture
But don't doubt me, I'm a pure brand hustler
Everything I had I had and gonna get
Cause wasn't nobody ever giving me shit
