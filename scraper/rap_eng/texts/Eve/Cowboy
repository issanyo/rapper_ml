(Verse 1)
Uh ,c'mon,uh,yo,yo
Niggas they drug her up like liquid
How she dish shit
Man,woman,boy and girl got addicted
Damn she flipped it ,when gone they missed it
Been on cuz, they can't stop her climb
Nigga you digs it?
Want that ,well u can keep that
Cuz other bitches out there wack but u can't see that
E-V is top notch, I had to spot watch
To make sure I had it mine
Cuz u can't cock block, came up
Fucked the game up
Now your record sales is weak but u can't blame us
Cuz none can tame us ,the game'll never drain us
Cuz we gon' stop your shine
And it remains us
It's all good ,you takin everything sweet
But it's the problem and the pressure that they can't see
I'm tryin to make a quik flip
Nigga can u dig this ?
Shit is real, make a mil forever be that rich bitch

(Chorus)
Where my niggas at ?(WHAT)
Where my thugs at ?(WHAT)
Where my niggas gettin stacks ?
U know where we at
Where my bitches at ?(WHAT)
Where my hoes at ?(WHAT)
Were my bitches chasin at ?
U know where we at

(Verse 2)
Uh ,yo
They callin me a savage
Cuz I gotta have it
I ain't work this hard not to ball and live lavish
And let some clown take my shine like I ain't workin overtime
I refuse to fuck up, and lose my place I got in line ,uh
Bitch please
Erased your name with ease
And it was nothin, caught u stuntin got no room to breath
Only into big things
All day spit game
Tryin to put my people up on paper before shit change
I be up, late night
Tryin to get my papes right
After every show, I gotta go, I got a late flight
Thought they had us figure out
Cuz we pullin figures out
Not that bitch, who is she and what that nigga Swizz about ?
Questions start to come about
Thought my time was runnin out
But never cuz I'm better under presssure, guess u figured out
Stop all the dumb shit
I came to run shit
Think I'm leavin, not at all I'm havin to much fun sheet-it

(Chorus)
Where my niggas at ?(WHAT)
Where my thugs at ?(WHAT)
Where my niggas gettin stacks ?
U know where we at
Where my bitches at ?(WHAT)
Where my hoes at ?(WHAT)
Were my bitches chasin at ?
U know where we at

(Verse 3)
Uh, yo

We always keep it gangsta we change what y'all be talkin bout
Some get away with bullshit
But they the ones who drown quick
Back on the block, hustlin, scrapin money up to buy a brick
Too late ,cuz it's over now
