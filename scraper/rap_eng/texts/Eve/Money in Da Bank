[Chorus: Timati]
I got money in the bank
Shawty what you drink
I make it rain, rain, rain
Gonna make it all black, ey ey
I got money in the bank

[Verse 1: Eve]
They call me bombshell - skin color caramel
Said he wanna get to know me and to know me well
EVE got the body of a goddess
Yeah, I could be modest but why, I am the hottest
He said he wanna take me 'round the world
He said he wanna make me happy, be his baby girl
I told him daddy you could do it but just do it right
I mean I like a quiet engine and them private flights
I know I sound a little snobby but I need the best
Told me he the real boss and forget the rest
He told me chill cause he gonna set up everything
He took my hand, made a plan and I heard him say

[Chorus: Timati]
I got money in the bank
Shawty what you drink
I make it rain rain rain
Gonna make it all black, ey ey
Shawty throw it in the bag
I don't mean to brag
I make it rain, rain, rain
Gonna make it all black, ey,  ey
I got money in the bank

[Verse 2: Timati]
They call me Mr. Gamble With Your Life - Russian roulette
Half a million spent on the new jet
Suicide trips, do or die threats
All around the world you and I, yup
I keep your hair lookin' flyer than the rest of them
Louboutins - I'll put you in the best of them
I see them other girls but I don't even mess with them
Why would I when you the epitome of excellence
Make money, all I do is make money
And spend it all on you so you can look great for me
Go-getter, I ain't never been lazy
Cause it's all about the Benjamins, Baby

[Chorus: Timati]
I got money in the bank
Shawty what you drink
I make it rain rain rain
Gonna make it all black, ey ey
Shawty throw it in the bag
I don't mean to brag
I make it rain rain rain
Gonna make it all black, ey,  ey
I got money in the bank

[Verse 3: Eve]
I know you like my Louboutin shoes, my YSL bag
He said he had to have me, fell in love with my Swag
I'm the type of chick to ball out on her own
But if you wanna be with me, you can't be comin' wrong
See I'm a special kind of breed
My mama knew it too, why you think she named me Eve
Ha, I'm just speaking out game
He smiled at me, took my hand and I heard him say

[Chorus: Timati]
I got money in the bank
Shawty what you drink
I make it rain rain rain
Gonna make it all black, ey ey
Shawty throw it in the bag
I don't mean to brag
I make it rain rain rain
Gonna make it all black, ey,  ey
I got money in the bank
