(MO'NIQUE)
Ain't nothing worse then a brotha
Who always bling blingin
Flossin, rollin like he got it like dat
Always up in your face telling you what he got
What he can bring to the table
And then it's like this nigga cinderella
Cuz he always dropping yo ass off at midnight
And you can't seem to understand
Why at midnight is he always dropping yo ass off?
Cuz let the truth be told
He ain't bling blingin or sling slingin
He ain't doin shit!
That 500 benz he drivin - thats his mamma's a
And that goddamn jewelry he wearin -all that shit is ridded
And at 12:01, they come and lock his bitch ass up
Now ain't that some shit?
