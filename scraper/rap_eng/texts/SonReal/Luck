You gon love me

You gon love me

Can I have a penny for a thought, baby?
Can I have a nickel for a say?
Cause I ain't got a lot of luck
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF LUCK
I ain't got a lot of luck today
Just a penny for a thought, baby
And just a nickel for a say
Cause I ain't got a lot of luck
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF LUCK
I ain't got a lot of luck today

[Verse 1]
I don't need much, just a pen and pad
Just an emo beat when I'm feeling sad
And I don't give a fuck what all these rappers say
When they acting famous before they got accolade
Ain't real, that ain't real, bro
I don't need a lot to make it work
Don't need no molly to go make it twerk
I'd rather drop my money on some clothes
And drop it up on these hoes whey they saying they love my show
Go get her, go get her
I don't ever really try hard, I sound better when I don't
And I don't need to tell you that I'm real
If you really wanna know, just buy them albums that I wrote, fucker
I don't really need no shades today
The sun ain't really even out
And plus lately I'm down up on my luck
So would you spare my ass and listen if I wrote this hook to show

[Hook]
Can I have a penny for a thought, baby?
Can I have a nickel for a say?
Cause I ain't got a lot of luck
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF LUCK
I ain't got a lot of luck today
Just a penny for a thought, baby
And just a nickel for a say (true)
Cause I ain't got a lot of luck
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF LUCK
I ain't got a lot of luck today

[Verse 2]
I don't need a bad bitch, I just need a nice girl
You can go and call me corny, I just call that mad real
I don't need no glitter for you to see that I'm shinning
You can go and cop my disk and check the way that I'm rhyming
I don't need a lot of money, I'mma get a lot of money
When I do, me and my homies don't get rid of lot of money
I don't need no Henney but I'll sip it if it's there
Man, I'm cool with Pabst Ribbon on another shitty beer
I don't need no double time, but trust me, I can sink it all
Any motherfucker that be tripping on my lyrics gonna soon become extinct
People say I'll blow off the fact that I'm really good
If really good is how you blow, then there'd be a lot more who would
I woke up here this morning, no cereal in the box
Just locked up in a room with no keys to any of the locks
But I don't need much, you heard that in the first
Before we getting better, we always be getting worse so I'm saying, I'm saying

[Hook]
Can I have a penny for a thought, baby?
Can I have a nickel for a say?(can i?)
Cause I ain't got a lot of luck
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF LUCK
I ain't got a lot of luck today(That's true)
Just a penny for a thought, baby
And just a nickel for a say
Cause I ain't got a lot of luck
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF LUCK
I ain't got a lot of luck today

[Bridge]
I've been giving in for so damn long
Feeling like the end of my song
But all I want before we're finished
All I want before we're finished
Is for us to say, "We did it!" (x2)

[Hook]
Can I have a penny for a thought, baby?
Can I have a nickel for a say?
Cause I ain't got a lot of luck
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF LUCK
I ain't got a lot of luck today
Just a penny for a thought, baby
And just a nickel for a say
Cause I ain't got a lot of luck
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF LUCK
I ain't got a lot of luck today
