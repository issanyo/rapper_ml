[Chorus]
They can say what they like
They can say what they like
But you can live forever
Yes, you can live forever

[Verse 1]
I know not what I do, sorry, yeah
It was as easy as a phone call, yeah
I get so nervous when the light's on, yeah
I'd rather turn 'em off and go hard, oh god
I always thought that you would be around, yeah
To let me show you what I dreamed about, yeah
Now it seems that it's just too late
And I's just to busy to say "Hey, how you doin?"
Or "I love ya" or "I miss ya"
Give you a hug or get to kiss ya
The sweetest things in life come from a picture
But we can never snap 'em from the bleachers
So I face my fears, let me tell you this
I know it's impossible to turn back time
But ones like you never leave my heart
So when this song play, that mean you can never die
Never die, never die, no

[Chorus]
They can say what they like
They can say what they like
But you can live forever
Yes, you can live forever

[Verse 2]
I get so nervous when the light's on
Don't always feel like I'm the man
I always act like I can do it myself
But right now, I think I could use a hand
And yep, this be our happy song, yeah
From up above, I know you'll rap along
Mama gave me your bracelet, I wore it tight while I wrote it
So I don't need a plaque to go call this my Grammy song
Gold chains, man, I get it from my grandma
Outfits like an early MC Hammer
Witty attitude but always taught me manners
Cooking pasta while she giving shit to grandpa, hold up
Help me face my fears
Tryna write a song about the shit on my mind
Ones like you never leave my heart
So when this song plays, you can never ever die
Never ever ever die, no

[Chorus]
They can say what they like
They can say what they like
But you can live forever
Yes, you can live forever
They can say what they like
They can say what they like
You can live forever
Yes, you can live forever
