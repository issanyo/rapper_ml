[Verse 1]
Know I'm fucking with my grind
I'm balling on my happiness, I know
Right now with my time, I'm stalling
They ain't in my lane, I know
Shit been getting weird like Austin
People tryna change their role
Label dropped my ass, I'm sorry
Y'all done fucked up bad, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know
No matter what they tell you
Pretty baby, you is special
I know, I know
They wasn't fucking with the vision
'Til you're hot and now they love you

[Chorus]
Who care, who care, who care
Who care who watching? Knock Knock
Who there, who there, who there
Who there, I'm popping, Bop Bop

[Post-Chorus]
I know, I know
Who care, baby? Who care?

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning, put my mind to this shit
All I gotta do is inspire with this shit
150 shows, I ain't tired, I'll admit
Mama told me I'm designed for this shit
Geez, I got too much on my plate with the cheese
They say that everything fall in my lap
I gave it all 'til I fell to my knees
I been around but they say I don't [?]
I am the underdog, paving my way
I don't give a fuck what anyone say
I got the juice and I'm serving all day, here pull up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know
No matter what they tell you
Pretty baby, you is special
I know, I know
They wasn't fucking with the vision
'Til you're hot and now they love you

[Chorus]
Who care, who care, who care
Who care who watching? Knock knock
Who there, who there, who there
Who there, I'm popping, Bop Bop

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you, my friend
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you, my friend
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you
So fuck 'em

[Chorus]
Who care, who care, who care
Who care who watching? Knock knock
Who there, who there, who there
Who there, I'm popping, Bop Bop

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know
No matter what they tell you
Pretty baby, you is special
I know, I know
They wasn't fucking with the vision
'Til you're hot and know they love you

[Outro]
I'm balling, I'm balling
You ain't fucking with my grind
You ain't fucking with my grind
