[Chorus]
You can tell me lies, tell me lies all day
But I ain't getting smaller, supersize all day
Future on this shit, Marty McFly my way
To the point they can't tell me nothing like Kanye
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Whatcha, whatcha been up to, up to?
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Whatcha, whatcha been up to, up to?

[Post-Chorus]
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Homie, be proud, homie, be proud

[Verse 1]
Dalai Lama with the karma, I ain't fucking with the fake persona
Love being the underdog just like I love my mama
They love me like I'm Jordan when your boy is on top
Went platinum in my country the same day I got dropped
My papa never saw me go shine
So this album for him, you hear him when I rhyme
And I know in my heart they gon' sing every line
That's why I go insane, go insane, fuck it

[Chorus]
You can tell me lies, tell me lies all day
But I ain't getting smaller, supersize all day
Future on this shit, Marty McFly my way
To the point they can't tell me nothing like Kanye
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Whatcha, whatcha been up to, up to?
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Whatcha, whatcha been up to, up to?

[Post-Chorus]
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Homie, be proud, homie, be proud

[Verse 2]
People wanna sound the same, I just give 'em exercise
People wanna follow order, I just give 'em extra boss
Bloggers wouldn't fuck with me, now loving me's a luxury
Last year, I couldn't even get a showcase out in Texas, bruh
Couch surfing to go make a wave, yah baby
That's that shit that made me change the day, yah baby
1851 tat on my leg, yah baby
That is why I say, yeah, that is why I say

[Chorus]
You can tell me lies, tell me lies all day
But I ain't getting smaller, supersize all day
Future on this shit, Marty McFly my way
To the point they can't tell me nothing like Kanye
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Whatcha, whatcha been up to, up to?
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Whatcha, whatcha been up to, up to?

[Post-Chorus]
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Take your time, lil homie, be proud
Homie, be proud, homie, be proud

[Outro]
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
