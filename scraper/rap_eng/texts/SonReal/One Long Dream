[Chorus: Sid Sriram]
The moment that we realize that everything is new
That's the moment that we come alive
And all our dreams come true
Oh, all our dreams come true
All our dreams come true
All our dreams come true

[Verse 1: SonReal]
Yeah, one long dream, you know that's all that I know, fella
From my first gig, you know I stole that show, yelling
This world, it gon' know about me
All I need's a boom box and a burned CD
Fast forward 10,000 hours, 1,000 shows, 100,000 miles
Few million views ain't justify how I got the sauce, thousand island
I wrote this verse, I's scared as hell so I closed my eyes
'Cause I ain't wanna make no music, man, my pops just died
Now I make you feel like thunder now
Quit my job and said "Fuck the boss"
Can't tell me who I'll be under now
Bust my ass for that star power
Now everybody wanna come around
Tell me shit like if I dumb it down
I could have a number one by summer now
But my number one goal ain't the drum roll
Rather have the encore
Every time I get a taste of it like a drug
I just always seem to want more
They say fame'll kill it, bang bang the million
Way before Cobain ever left the building
When I write the line that I'm saying here
Don't take for granted, it ain't pain I'm feeling
Them hard times bring sunshine
Now the sun sings up to the world, mama
All these [?] that we dreamt up
Become [?], mama
Remember flying to Atlanta
Playing out dumb records for Drama
Praying on the floor of the airpot
Smiling at a bank account with no commas
Man, I ain't that and I ain't this
And I don't need a paint brush when I paint this
Everybody said what I can't get
Like my lane's just outrageous, uh
Point it and I aim it
[?] Big Daddy Kane shit
All I had is my life, look into the mirror, little homie
Everything's beautiful, all I'm saying is
Everything that I'm not made me everything that I is
Used to couch surf at my friend's house
And dream about all this shit
Used to tell my pops I'll be famous
In them days and I'll remain nameless
He say, "How you gonna obtain this?"
I say, I say

[Chorus: Sid Sriram]
The moment that we realize that everything is new
That's the moment that we come alive
And all our dreams come true
Oh, all our dreams come true
All our dreams come true
All our dreams come true
When everything we see inside and everything we do
That's the moment that we come alive
And all our dreams come true
Oh, all our dreams come true
Oh, all our dreams come true
Oh, all our dreams, all our dreams come true
