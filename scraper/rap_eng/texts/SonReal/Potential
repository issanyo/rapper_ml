[Verse 1]
I wanna live for ya, I wanna try for ya
I wanna stop bitchin' 'bout what's inside for ya
I wanna change my ways, I wanna turn the page
I wanna write it better, take time to recite it better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all my strength and all my mind
But I could never turn back the hands of time
And I know that shit but it's haunting me
This is how it's gotta be

[Refrain]
I ain't cool with it
Struggle, nah nah nah, I ain't new to it
Perfect, yeah, I guess we all assuming it
So I say, well I say, well I say, well I say

[Chorus]
I'm gonna grind for ya, I'mma shine for ya
Go walk that line for ya
Been searching, I'mma find it for ya
We gonna see the day when we won't be afraid
To show our true potential
I just wanna show my true potential

[Refrain]
I ain't cool with it
Struggle
Nah nah nah I ain't new to it
Perfect, yeah I guess we all assuming it

[Verse 2]
And I'mma ride for ya, like it's my last moment to say
That I'm alive for ya, die for ya
Try for ya like that old song we play
I got something for you, my friend, hey
I got something for you, my friend, hey
I ain't talking bout credentials, I'm talking bout potential
I'm talking about moving you, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all my strength and all my mind
But I could never turn back the hands of time
And I know that shit but it's haunting me
This is how it's gotta be

[Refrain]
I ain't cool with it
Struggle, nah nah nah, I ain't new to it
Perfect, yeah, I guess we all assuming it
So I say, well I say, well I say, well I say

[Chorus]
I'm gonna grind for ya, I'mma shine for ya
Go walk that line for ya
Been searching, I'mma find it for ya
We gonna see the day when we won't be afraid
To show our true potential
I just wanna show my true potential

[Bridge]
Hold back, hold back
We can fight but we ain't winning anymore
Run that, run that
Let's just live it like we ain't living anymore
Who cares what they say, they don't know 'bout us
Call my ass crazy, I'll still be shining

[Chorus]
I'm gonna grind for ya, I'mma shine for ya
Go walk that line for ya
Been searching, I'mma find it for ya
We gonna see the day when we won't be afraid
To show our true potential
I just wanna show my true potential
