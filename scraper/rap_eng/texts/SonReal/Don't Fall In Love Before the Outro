[Chorus: Sid Sriram]
Don't go fall in love before the outro
Let me prove just what you came to see
Oh, don't go fall in love before the outro
Go on, take your time, let me show you me

[Verse 1: SonReal]
Outro
Man, I done came up in that city tryna cut it the slack
I always dreamed I'd have it all so I could give it right back
My daddy told me, "If this ain't work
You'll be swingin' them hammers"
I locked myself back in my room
And now I'm singing them hammers, no grammar
But grandma used to rock all gold when she go to church
She don't ask me why this gold be hangin' all on my shirt
And no, you ain't love me, baby, baby
'Til I prove to you what I'ma really be, baby, baby, hold up

[Chorus: Sid Sriram]
Don't go fall in love before the outro
Let me prove just what you came to see
Oh, don't go fall in love before the outro
Go on, take your time, let me show you me

[Verse 2: SonReal]
Met you in '05, we from that small town
I tried to hit that, but I got shot down
Who knew we'd cross paths way, way, way down the road?
You thought you were out my league 'til I made that heart explode
Who'd ever thought that I could find true love?
You were there before I even got to buy you stuff
I was broker than a joke, but you were by my side
I don't take that shit for granted, let me tell you why, hold up
People search they whole life, yeah, tryna find what we have, yeah
On the road for three months, yeah, them girls be so bad
And I said I want them, then I said I want you 'cause
Nobody love me like, li-li-like you do, I
I just don't like to t-talk 'bout love anymore
I know I've said a million times I give no fucks anymore
But can I take that statement back, because I'll give 'em for you
Do what you love and let it kill you
I guess I'm living proof, I'm saying

[Chorus: Sid Sriram]
Don't go fall in love before the outro
Let me prove just what you came to see
Oh, don't go fall in love before the outro
Go on, take your time, let me show you me

[Verse 3: SonReal]
I wrote an album 'bout my dreams
Wrote these songs about my flaws
Talked it out with a piano, had trouble talking with God
Since I've been 15 years old, I gave a fuck about the odds
'Cause my plan a rocket launcher, bitch, we shootin' for the stars
Yeah yeah, 10,000 hours, 10,000 hours and puzzle pieces
10,000 hours, 10,000 hours of huggin' bleachers
But all that bleacher time taught me how to go speak my mind
Taught me how to be hungry as fuck when I get to speakin' lines
So, my dude's, who knew back then I'd blow? This one's for you
My circle's smaller than my buzz when I first started
Those the days when they would call us cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo
I guess we was, but that's what dreams are made of
I sacrifice a few relationships to make my layup
I almost quit this shit, but every night, you made me stay up
I wanna thank you for saving me with this play I made up
Play on
