[Verse 1]
I've met with the angels
Danced with the devil in my head, and that's okay
I've tried to be the strongest
When I was the weakest inside, and that's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I will wake up on my homie's sofa
Weight all on my shoulders
All for this dream tonight, dream tonight
I would fake it, hide from my mistakes
But fears, I had to face them just to be here tonight

[Chorus]
We've all got something to offer
Everybody got a dream
Everyone's got some problems, not just ones you see
Everyone's got some falling, everybody needs to speak
Everybody's got some problems, not just you and me
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems

[Verse 2]
We've tried
There's nothing wrong with being wrong sometimes
Just not me
Goodbye to all them L's I took last year
I'm on mine, J-O-B

[Pre-Chorus]
I will wake up on my homie's sofa
Weight all on my shoulders
All for this dream tonight, dream tonight
I would fake it, hide from my mistakes
But fears, I had to face them just to be here tonight

[Chorus]
We've all got something to offer
Everybody got a dream
Everyone's got some problems, not just ones you see
Everyone's done some falling, everybody needs to speak
Everybody's got some problems, not just you and me
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems

[Pre-Chorus]
I will wake up, on my homies sofa
Weight all on my shoulders
All for this dream tonight, dream tonight
I would fake it, hide from my mistakes
But fears, I had to face them just to be here tonight

[Chorus]
We've all got something to offer
Everybody got a dream
Everyone's got some problems, not just ones you see
Everyone's got some falling, everybody needs to speak
Everybody's got some problems, not just you and me
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems
Everybody's got some problems, problems
