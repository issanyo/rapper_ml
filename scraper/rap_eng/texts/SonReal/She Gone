If loving yous would kill me
Baby then you guilty
Lock her up she so cold
What we had was filthy
She stabbed me then she killed me
Lock her up with no parole
Yeah and now she gone
Yeah, she’s just a song
Yeah, i knew it all along, along
All she meant was harm
Now i am so calm
Free from what she on she gone she gone
Yeah, met her back in ’02
Fed a bro that soul food
Spun a rubix cube until she made me say i know you
Used to eat steak, and chicken, burgers, now it’s tofu
Never feeling full, it’s worse than feeling a christmas cold flu
Had a bus stop without a fuckin soul in sight
She always tempted me was wrong when all i wanted to do was right
Turn on the tv when all i want to do is write
When i sleep i want to dream but all she want to do is night, mare
With me, restin but this sleep ain't even real
Where’s nemo when you need him when i find him, i will
Drop cruella de ville, now we in the hall fightin
On our anniversary, we clashing but she the titan
And im more like a rubber dingy deflating
She always seem to pop me
And when shit pop off, she the only one to stop me
As she looked me in my eye she say what im about to do is hard
As she grabbed the knife off up the counter, stuck it in my heart
Now i say to her
If loving yous would kill me
Baby then you guilty
Lock her up she so cold
What we had was filthy
She stabbed me then she killed me
Lock her up with no parole
Yeah, and now she gone
Yeah, she’s just a song
Yeah, i knew it all along, along
All she meant was harm
Now i am so calm
Free from what she on she gone she gone
Yea, now im fast asleep and she be far from what i dream
I never went looking, but i found this new girl i’ve been seeing
Treat a bro like gold and so i treat her like a diamond
My music gotten better since our stars became in alignment
And i really can’t tell you so i’ma show you how im shining
Everywhere you look i ain't right there like crime and
Litter, graffiti and billboards, hope you like my look now
Since you killed me i been so damn high that i can’t look down
Never thought it’d come but you made it came
Never thought i’d feel it when you made it rain
I was so confused of the way you had me feeling
Got me feeling like i might just be the insane, one
And now i finally look you in your eye
On your visiting hour yes i know you thought i died but
You won’t dock in hell so i smiled as you just cried as you beg for my forgiveness
I just look at you like why
Buzz time’s up
I give my last goodbye
As she break through the glass and kill me i wake up and look into the mirror so i can say to her
If loving yous would kill me
Baby then you guilty
Lock her up she so cold
What we had was filthy
She stabbed me then she killed me
Lock her up with no parole
Yeah, and now she gone
Yeah, she’s just a song
Yeah, i knew it all along, along
All she meant was harm
Now i am so calm
Free from what she on she gone she gone
