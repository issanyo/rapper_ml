Well Alright, Okay
If We Ain't Already There
Then We're On Our Way, Today (Today)
Not Tomorrow
Because Tomorrow's Too Far Away
Away From Me Now. [X2]

[Verse One] - RICH KIDD
Well alright, okay
Feeling like Lil' Jon on my east side wage
But I'm west end raised
And I gotta let 'em know that, You gonn' hold that
Hanging on to every word I say
I deserve to get payed, Working harder than most
Cause I don't want to go back to margarine 'n' Toast
And I won't ever relax, this musics in my soul
And I know many will crash, gotta stay in control
With my hands on the wheel, tires on the pavement
Hitting and running on these women, it's reckless endangerment
Now my focus is Luchini, too greedy, nah, I put my nigga's on
Ask Huddini
It's all starting to take shape, it's too 3D
Uh, we make good news spread like VD
It's all hype, always, all like, onstage, All night, All day
Alright, Okay

[Verse Two] - JD ERA
Took a chance and didn't think twice
You wouldn't either if you this nice
Win or lose, you gotta roll the dice
Above the clouds, that's where i live life
That high grade cologne had us puffin and
Discussing till like 6 in the morn'
I knew that one day I would wake up and get
Whatever I want, Do whatever I want
Fuck whoever I want
I want my money today, Not tomorrow, today!
Got that from my homie Kamakaze, That's what he say
But that was back in the day, and now they givin' us play
Was no room for us to follow, Had to make us away
I tell 'em dream and achieve, Make a plan and believe
Give your all and be thankful, the blessings that you receive
I mean these bitches they love me, I'm Hugh Heffin' the road
First i take over the city then i take over the globe!
Alright okay

[Verse Three] - SonReal
Yeah, I made something out of nothing, [Nadda]
If life's a bitch you can call a bro McLovin
Put it all together, pop her in the oven boy
I'm hungry when i write like this, you know I'm up to something
Like, like, [You Know That]
0 10, no one knew i broke
Now i got believers like I signed up with that Scooter Braun
This that very moment that I justify that "who'da known"
Mentality you was on fore you knew that I was gone
Like tenth cross the bars
Playin my position, with ambition like Malaun
Haters cannot listen, I was busy while you was snoring, because
I knew that's what it took, for you to listen to my song
Pick your own and flip a coin, you never knew when my shit is gone
My shit is on, some other dude too, if I signed up, that's prolly due too
All the time, I put in, put it wit da pain, no Vicodin, already then
I'm hyped again, now chill
