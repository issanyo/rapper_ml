[Verse 1]
I might not find the perfect line
To tell you just what's on my mind
Turn down the lights and close the blinds
'Cause all we got is all this time

[Chorus]
All I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
I fell in love with you for believing
Now all I got is time for your loving

[Verse 2]
You turned me to a better man
We used to argue 'bout my plans
I left 5 months to make it back
Now, I need you to understand

[Chorus]
All I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
I fell in love with you for believing
Now all I got is time for your loving

[Verse 3]
You were there in them new song days, hey
Sleeping with me in a futon days, hey
Chilling when my shitty new song playing
And that's just so real, yeah, that's just so real to me
Right beside me when I crashed your car and
Right beside me when I wasn't for you
Right beside me when I fought so hard
Tryna explain how I could do without you
And all these flashing lights
Could never outshine what you gave me
Been searching all my goddamn life
For you to let me call you baby

[Chorus]
Now all I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
I fell in love with you for believing
Now all I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
All I got is time for your loving
I fell in love with you for believing
Now all I got is time for you loving
