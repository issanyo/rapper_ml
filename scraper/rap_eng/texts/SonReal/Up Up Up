Now I been up up up and I been down
Ain't smoke no (shh) but I'm higher than a cloud now
I been lost lost lost but now I'm found
Here I'm on my city where my feet be on the ground now
I c-c-came in this game in a way hey
Too broke to catch a cab so they say I'm too late hey
Lookin' kinda funny use my skill as a gateway
But that sh*t ain't cool so everyone hate me
Hey you, how you doin' girl my name is Son
Pretty soon I'll be that dude you call the famous one
Even though I'm couch surfin' like a joe-smo
Rap career lookin' like a motherfuckin no go

But I swear to god I be that dude who say I told em so
Uhh, mom callin' me again

The year is '09 and I'm gettin' no better now
Broke up with my girl but I still got no cheddar now
Tryna play catch up with these dudes I'm ahead of now
Go to sleep dream to be up instead of down
Did a tour but we made no money
How my look is so fresh and I be livin' so bummy
Gotta call from new yeddi, said i been chosen to open up for Lil' Wayne in Mississippi
Turns out they want a 2 grand deposit
Shit was all a scam good thing I never got it
My struggle ain't nothing like their's boy
I come from a small town where everybody on steroids
And only famous dude from there is Daniel Powter
Had a bad day since I stepped out of the shower
I been down where you never want to see me
But now I'm feeling flyer than a mafuckin genie

The year's '010 and I buzz like a killer bee
No WuTang but the real has been feelin' me
And I can pack a bill without open for [???]
The f**k if you hatin' go head and try to get rid of me
Boy I go, we know we go that's the motto
Log onto twitter, all these people start to follow
Last year I couldn't get a feature less the price is right
Now they hittin' my management saying the boy is nice man
2012 roll round band wagon fans love me since I made the countdown
And now they actin' like we in though
Labels say they'll take a bro where I ain't ever been though
I just sign on nothin' as I kinda sort of grin though
'cause everything I said I'd do I'm makin' sure I did yo
Uhh so watch us as we finally bring it
And if you feel the same man why don't you just sing it for me

And it goes like this
This sh*t ain't easy baby
But you gotta believe me baby
'cause what's up must come down
And I think that theory even work the other way around
