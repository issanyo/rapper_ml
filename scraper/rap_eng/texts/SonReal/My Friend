[Verse 1]
We grown now
You my only father and the only father I've known
And you old now
Bet your bottom dollar if it's up to me
You wouldn't be alone, no no
You home now
Smoking on a bowl, hoping Sonny gonna phone like, yeah
I'm gon' to, but to be quite honest
I need you more than you need you, and that's true
But I know, I know, I know, I know its times like these
When family is the one and only thing we need to get by
I know, I know, I know, I know I ain't no saint
Neither is you, I'm just you in a different way, so I say

[Chorus]
If I got you, then I know I got something
If we ain't got time, then we ain't got nothin'
Ain't got hate, then we ain't got lovin'
If we ain't got each other than we ain't got nothin'
If I got you, then I know I got something
If we ain't got time, then we ain't got nothin'
Ain't got hate, then we ain't got lovin'
If we ain't got each other than we ain't got nothin'
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend

[Verse 2]
We grown now
You my only father and the only father I've ever known
And you so damn similar to me
I'm hearin' me up in ya every time you phone
So you know, just slow down
Only 59 got some life ahead of you
So just roll, don't go down
The same damn road you've been heading since mama let go now

[Chorus]
If I got you, then I know I got something
If we ain't got time, then we ain't got nothin'
Ain't got hate, then we ain't got lovin'
If we ain't got each other than we ain't got nothin'
If I got you, then I know I got something
If we ain't got time, then we ain't got nothin'
Ain't got hate, then we ain't got lovin'
If we ain't got each other than we ain't got nothin'
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, I know it's times like these
When family is the one and only thing we need
I know, I know, I know, I know I ain't no saint
And neither is you, I'm just you in a different way
And all I know is

[Chorus]
If I got you, then I know I got something
If we ain't got time, then we ain't got nothin'
Ain't got hate, then we ain't got lovin'
If we ain't got each other than we ain't got nothin', yeah
If I got you, then I know I got something
If we ain't got time, then we ain't got nothin'
Ain't got hate, then we ain't got lovin'
If we ain't got each other than we ain't got nothin'
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend
It's all on you my friend, it's all on you my friend
