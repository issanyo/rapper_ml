Man, I used to suck so fucking bad that ain’t nobody would listen to me
Until failing that basically scared the piss out me
So as I urinate on all the ones who hated
I’ma give a high five to the new fans we created
We go on one track, and the shit cause scene
So I made that there my slogan now my slogan on your tees
Thought I was gonna quit when I only turned 23
But once I plugged all my energy, my shine got LED
Oversized fitted and tall tees, used to front like one now I’m finally seeing G’s Like
I gotta call from my dad saying he mad, like
He ain’t agree with the opinions that they have
On the youtube page, I had to break it down
Only way they all gonna love you if never make a sound
And I’d rather put a blade to my wrists than never be heard
If cool was being conservative I’d rather be a nerd
I speak for all the people who be speaking out of turn
As long as you saying something that gonna make these people learn
I spend an hour a day replying to fans who love me
And I still ain’t fucking made it, but that make me rich as puffy (right?)
My first five years rapping I was wacker lyrical, spiritual, miracle
Rhyming with venereal, just a teenager eating a bowl of cereal
Listening to pac, to sound like him would be a miracle
Instead I’m stuck with this high voice, gotta blow against me
That ain’t even fucking my choice
Writing shitty songs then I’m sending them to my boys
And how they feel about it be predetermining my joy
Man I used to be a loser but now they saying I’m cool
Still feeling like a loner but working hard as a mule like
Tight jeans but I rock that shit like they baggy
Pants so low that it’s pissing off the grannies
If I wrote whats on my mind, you probably wouldn’t understand me
So I keep it point blank like them boys from Regent Park
Rappers looking dumpy if you cut back on your start
You could probably have the stamina to spit an okay bar
People always talking about haters and I hate us, I’m hating on haters
And which haters starting the instigating
I just keep my mouth shut, save myself the debating
Like my step dads son, man we ain’t really relating
Said I never wanna blow unless I’m ready
So when you say I should, I just say I wasn’t ready
Now they throwing out confetti free falling like a petty song (WOO!)
When it be that shit, we steady on, like we be already on
You know I be stunting, fuck it I’ma be honest and really tell you something
People act we be paid not knowing that ain’t a fact
I go and make all this money then I spend it twice as fast
But trust me I’ll make it back
Call my grandma to tell her I’m doing fine
She tell me she be so proud a week later she died
I’m tryna tell what’s right, but caught up in something wrong
I’m killing it where I’m at but not living it where I want

[Chorus x2]
I’m just trying to be the man
I’m just trying be the man
Cause when they say I couldn’t, that’s when I say that I can
Everything I’m not made me everything I am
