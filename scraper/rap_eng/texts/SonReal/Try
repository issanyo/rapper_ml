[Verse 1]
Been working all damn day for this pay check
Boss ain't never ask me how my day went
They say working hard will get ya where ya wanna go
But I been running ever since my feet done hit the Pavement
And when I walk outside, I don't see no difference
Yeah, I got a suit and tie, but I don't feel too different
'Cause my hydro bill just came in and it's twice as much as last month
I got couple kids, so I been filling the bathtub
Oh baby, that's the struggle of a motherfucker doing his thing
I was gunna stop ya on the street and complain
'Stead I walked the other way like I feel no pain 'cause I gotta show em
I'm trying, ain't waiting in no line
Ain't walking in your shoes, I'm booking it in mine
'Cause people got too much and this life ain't enough time
So before you try fix and 'em, just know, just know

[Chorus]
All my problems don't need no solving
They just need time to unwind
And all my worries don't need no jury
They just need me to decide, I'ma try, I'ma try

[Post-Chorus]
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying

[Verse 2]
Waiting all damn day for the weekend
Lately, I been feeling shit, been off the deep end
And I been waiting, I been waiting round for time
I been waiting round for yours, I been waiting round for mine
And this waiting never help me, nah, this waiting never grind
Nah, this waiting fucking kill me, yeah, this waiting like a crime
Had to shoplift what I got so I could get up out that line
Now I’m running down the street like I’m about to cross a line
Like ooh, damn it, mall security chasing me like it's for fun
Pulling out his phone, he dialling 911
Said I got 2 minutes 'fore I'm hearing cops come
So I try to show em I’m trying, I’m sorry I broke lines
I’m really a good person, I never done no crimes
So go and check my record, not one thing that you’ll find
So before you try and fix 'em, just know, just know

[Chorus]
All my problems don't need no solving
They just need time to unwind
And all my worries don't need no jury
They just need me to decide, I'ma try, I'ma try

[Post-Chorus]
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying

[Outro]
Do just what you like, maybe that's okay
Do just what you like, maybe that's alright
Do just what you wish, maybe that's your gift
Do just what you like, maybe that's alright
Maybe that's alright, yeah
Maybe that's alright
Maybe that's alright
Maybe that's alright
Maybe that's alright
