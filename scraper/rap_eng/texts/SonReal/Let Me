[Verse 1]
I know that I ain't perfect for you, perfect for you
And I understand, understand, understand
I'm certain that I'm worthy for you, worthy for you
So please give me a chance, just a chance
I see you with that douchebag, baby
What is up with that?
Now here I've been your smile, been your smile
Now I don't mean to be blunt
But I really don't give a fuck, so [?]

[Chorus]
Let me be your man
Let me be your man
Cause I see this is what you got, baby
So let me hold your hand


One time that hater was looking at me like I was so damn fussy
She just needed a little attention and I ain't afraid to give it to her
That's my bitch
People always want things that they can't have
From the second I saw you, I knew I will be that nigga
You thought I was too addicted and wanted to send me to rehab
To send me to rehab
[?]
'That's word to my mother
And I ain't too funny when I 'm being nervous
But I when I see their faces [?]
[?]
'It never down on you
It never won for you
I don't mean to be'
But I really don't give a fuck
So listen to that tonight
All I need is your love

[Bridge]
Cause I don't care about the take-up, take-up
All I need is your love
Cause I ain't here just for a day-job, day-job
All I need is your love
All I need is your love

[Chorus]
Let me be your man
Let me be your man
Cause I see this is what you got, baby
So let me hold your hand
Let me be your man
Let me be your man
Cause I see this is what you got, baby
So let me hold your hand
