[Verse 1]
I got thick skin, but not as thick as they want it
I ain't too cool to be affected by the hate in the comments
And now my problems gettin' big like Christopher Wallace
And I wanna fight back without resortin' to violence
Got a message from a girl, told me, "Artists like you
Get me through a tough day when it's heavy at school"
I replied, "Don't you let up," but replies mess my head up
Come to think about it, maybe I am just like you

[Pre-Chorus]
They can say what they wanna
But it's time I let it go
'Cause I been holdin' on for too long
So it's time to let 'em know

[Chorus]
I've had about enough, you can't take me out, oh no
'Cause I'ma build me up, you can't break me down no more
I'm singing oh oh, oh oh
When the world's weighin' on your back
You should know that I will carry that
I'ma build you up, so they can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more

[Verse 2]
I put myself out there, feeling no repercussion
I understand I have a voice I need to spread to the public
So let me ask you just one question, would you say it in person?
Keep the same energy as I'm addressing the subject
What if I brought myself down to that level and tried to dim your light?
Instead, I let you shine like a bezel
I'd rather fight for something I believe, changin' like the seasons
People out here grievin', that's why my pen is bleedin', it's bleedin'

[Pre-Chorus]
They can say what they wanna
But it's time I let it go
'Cause I been holdin' on for too long
So it's time to let 'em know

[Chorus]
I've had about enough, you can't take me out, oh no
'Cause I'ma build me up, you can't break me down no more
I'm singing oh oh, oh oh
When the world's weighin' on your back
You should know that I will carry that
I'ma build you up, so they can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more

[Bridge]
I've been running, running my whole life
So I ain't runnin' from you
I've been running, running my whole life
So I ain't runnin' from you

[Chorus]
I've had about enough, you can't take me out, oh no
'Cause I'ma build me up, you can't break me down no more
I'm singing oh oh, oh oh
When the world's weighin' on your back
You should know that I will carry that
I'ma build you up, so they can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more

[Outro]
They can't break you down no more
They can't break you down no more
