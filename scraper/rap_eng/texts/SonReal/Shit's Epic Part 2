[Chorus]
Got one thing right, sipping little juice up on a Sunday night
Had dreams of believing, had dreams of believing way before things right
So put something in the air, put something in the air if you run your life
If you love your life, if you run your life
I, I, I got what you want, what you need, baby
I, I, I got what you want, what you fiend, baby
I, I, I got what you want, what you need, baby
I, I, I got what you want – Shit's Epic Part 2
Blame it all on my mistakes and my B roll and my outtakes
But there’d be no me without the outbreaks
Watch us take this mother fucker right out space like blow
Singing what’s up now, singing what's up now
Singing what’s up now, singing what's up now
Singing what’s up now
Shit's Epic Part 2

[Verse 1]
Man I just drop that new shit, make them feel like its boxing day
You can have the right to remain silent, silent, silent kinda like a cop would say
Man, my neighbors getting all pissed off
They sayin' they hear this shit from like a block away
I just keep the music thumpin', thumpin', thumpin', now I never ever hear em knockin eh
This the shit I was dreaming when I was sleeping on the couch
And ain't nobody know my name and no one know what I’m about
And ain't nobody really hear me even when a homie shout
My mommah calling me and telling me to take a different route
Like I ain't made a fuckin’ dollar, ain't no record label holler
I'm just sitting on a sofa with an ounce of marijuana
Kinda feeling like a loser, don’t know if I’ll take it farther
Just staring at the wall, doing nothing that I gotta
To get here, let me make this clear
I had no handouts to get up to this year
But I can shoot a video that come off a bit weird
Make that shit go like I put’er in 5th gear
Vrum vrum, I feel like I’ve already been here
Vrum vrum, I feel like I’ve already been here
Peel out, peel out, taking a win here
Used to stand in line, now they letting me in here
I be that hook flinger, real talker, bit awkward, chill speed walker
Product of 90’s rap, but my life story's all I offer

[Chorus]
Got one thing right, sipping little juice up on a Sunday night
Had dreams of believing, had dreams of believing way before things right
So put something in the air, put something in the air if you run your life
If you love your life, if you run your life
I, I, I got what you want, what you need, baby
I, I, I got what you want, what you fiend, baby
I, I, I got what you want, what you need, baby
I, I, I got what you want – Shit's Epic Part 2
Blame it all on my mistakes and my B roll and my outtakes
But there’d be no me without the outbreaks
Watch us take this mother fucker right out space like blow
Singing what’s up now, singing what's up now
Singing what’s up now, singing what's up now
Singing what’s up now
Shit's Epic Part 2

[Verse 2]
Man, I just dropped that mixtape, critics getting all after me
I’m just trying to live, bruh, turning beats into casualties
I just say what’s on my brain then I push them off to them factories
Press the shit, they go exorcist, heads spinnin' now everybody after me
Yeah, everybody rocking out, but what the fuck they really talking 'bout?
Yeah, Sonny for the kids, Moms buy it, now their children never ever ever dropping out
Smart rap, this ain't hard rap, I been through shit, I make scar rap
Now we running shit like my bar tab, living life like Ye after the car crashed, now hold up
I was going to say let a bitch breathe, but a bro in 5th speed
Started when I’s 15, taping up my spit screen, plotting out a big dream, currently I’m living
Now a bro be giving minimal fucks, I got the win in the trunk, with no subliminal love
My boy got flash banged in the nuts, We Go
Somebody tell Jimmy Kimmel what’s up
Ayo, Kimmel, what’s up?

[Chorus]
Got one thing right, sipping little juice up on a Sunday night
Had dreams of believing, had dreams of believing way before things right
So put something in the air, put something in the air if you run your life
If you love your life, if you run your life
I, I, I got what you want, what you need, baby
I, I, I got what you want, what you fiend, baby
I, I, I got what you want, what you need, baby
I, I, I got what you want – Shit's Epic Part 2
Blame it all on my mistakes and my B roll and my outtakes
But there’d be no me without the outbreaks
Watch us take this mother fucker right out space like blow
Singing what’s up now, singing what's up now
Singing what’s up now, singing what's up now
Singing what’s up now
Shit's Epic Part 2
