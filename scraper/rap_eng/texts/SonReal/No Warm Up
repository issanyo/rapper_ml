[Verse 1]
They told me things like, uh, "Go get a job"
I told them things like, uh, "Go, go fuck off"
I'm cool kid to these cool kids, I lead my own parade
Cause this new shit I drop right now gon' make your fuckin' day
I got shit to lose just like a plumber
Locked down like Ye for three summers
Locked down like DMX when he peel out
Vroom vroom, you know I'm the only real out
First try, no warm up with no diploma
I used to drive to Kelowna, get booed like a fuckin' loaner
Cause I was scared of myself and I showed it to everybody
This go out to anybody who yelling "We ready, Sonny" like
Ready, ready, ready

[Hook]
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
Yeah, I might just go ahead and say
First try, no warm up

[Post-Hook]
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up

[Verse 2]
They told me things like, uh, "Go back to school"
I told them things like, uh, "I fucking rule"
I'm Quim Cardona first try
I'm David Blaine on mushrooms
So this shit right here, this gon' make me levitate right 'bove you
I get higher than Peter Pan going skydiving
I can't miss, so I'm putting with my five iron
Vancouver raised a boy to a man
From a hundred dollar show to a couple hundred grand
I write my music like a 12 year old who's sitting in the stands
Cause that 12-year old was me when I was looking for my dad like
Chicka-bow-wow, chicka-bow-wow, run it
So if you see me walking, come and say "What's up" to Sonny like
Run it, run it, run it

[Hook]
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
Yeah, I might just go ahead and say
First try, no warm up

[Post-Hook]
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up

[Verse 3]
Hot damn, why you looking at me?
I been beaming like I just went pro
You can act like you running the show
But since I came here, man, I just don't know
Mama told me, "Don't break no rules
'Less you're planning on doing it first try"
I dedicate this song right here to anybody yelling "Free yo mind"
Run it, run it, run it

[Hook]
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
What's up? What's up? What's up?
First try, no warm up
Yeah, I might just go ahead and say
First try, no warm up

[Post-Hook]
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up
First try, no warm up
