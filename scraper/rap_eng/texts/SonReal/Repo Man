[Verse 1]
Hot damn, why they lookin' at me for?
I been sittin' back, starin' through the peephole
Now I'm back, got the keys to the wheel
I'm the repo man, repo man, hey
Old soul bangin' all out with my new flow
I made it my way, never had the glucose
Rush told me don't stop 'til they move on 'em
I'm the repo man, repo man, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
There we go, yeah yeah yeah
There we go, yeah yeah yeah
There we go, they be talkin' that shit
All I gotta say is

[Chorus]
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up, boy
Shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up, boy
Shut the fuck up, ay

[Verse 2]
I run shit like Hal Johnson, no need to wine and dine
Get the fuck up like I'm Pharoahe Monch '99
Don't mean to be rude, but I have no choice
I'm the repo man, repo man, hey
What you think? What you think?
I'm pretty sure I'm fuckin' awesome
Boy, I got the label like I'm Dibiase
Still, people wanna take shots at the repo man, repo man, ay

[Pre-Chorus]
There we go, yeah yeah yeah
There we go, yeah yeah yeah
There we go, they be talkin' that shit
All I gotta say is

[Chorus]
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up, boy
Shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up, boy
Shut the fuck up, ay

[Bridge]
Oh man, they be lookin' at me like
"Oh, damn, hope this motherfucker drop the ball, man"
But I'm like Steph Curry when he hot, man
Hammer after hammer, woo
A PSA to go and free my talent, yeah
I might just go call up Jimmy Fallon, yeah
I might rock a camel suit to the awards
'Cause I grew up rappin' along the War Report
Oh man, I'm the referee with the calls, man?
Y'all make laugh like LOL, man
'Cause ain't nobody out here got balls, man, fall back

[Pre-Chorus]
There we go, yeah yeah yeah
There we go, yeah yeah yeah
There we go, they be talkin' that shit
All I gotta say is

[Chorus]
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up, boy
Shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up
Woo, shut the fuck up, boy
Shut the fuck up, ay
