[Chorus]
When days just turn to nights, and everything is new, and
You just play your part and I'll just play it too
That's when I'm coming home
That's when I'm coming home
When everything is faking, everybody's smiling
Nobody can hear you 'cause everybody's mouths
That's when I'm coming home
That's when I'm coming home

[Verse 1]
I been off on that road, okay
I'll be damned if shit don't go roll my way 
Grew a little from them to doe days
I upped my mojo, no polo spray
I B-lined for the city of dreams
From the city of rain, I brought the city of pain
To give my city the light, and make my city a name
And let em all know that the kiddy got game 
Take it how ya wanna, I just do it how I do it
Never been about the glitter, always been about the music
Never been about the power, always been on how I use it
Never been about a hit, I always been about the movement
I been trying to get along, yeah, I been trying to lead the way 
Yeah, I been trying to keep it real, and I been dodging every stray, okay
Do he sound like Drizzy? Do he sound like Cole?
Do he sound like Chance? Fuck it, I don't even know 
Fucking 8 years deep, then a mothafucka blow
Ain't that some grind, high five-ing time
I been creeping on the low, don't need no friends, I got the bros
Don't need their's, yep, I got the flow
Yeah, yeah, I guess it's time I go when 

[Chorus]
When days just turn to nights, and everything is new, and
You just play your part and I'll just play it too
That's when I'm coming home
That's when I'm coming home
When everything is faking, everybody's smiling
Nobody can hear you 'cause everybody's mouths
That's when I'm coming home
That's when I'm coming home

[Verse 2]
Lately, I’ve been giving zero fucks, I got zero problems 
Got a 100 ways to get 0’s with commas 
Off of spreading art just like mural bomers
My city crowned me, never crowned myself 
I fucked around 'til I found myself 
Got enough flow to go ground myself 
Don't come at me unless you wanna drown yourself
Vroom, vroom, I been going harder than a muthafucka
Ever since I told my mommah I'ma be the biggest
I was smoking on a ciggy, swinging hammers for a living
That was '04, I guess I was my own worst critic
Vancouver down to my stone
Don't need no liquor shots to my dome
To tell the truth about shit in the booth about shit
To prove this shit all on my own
And I been trying to get along, yeah, I been trying to lead the way 
Yeah, I been trying to keep it real, and I been dodging every stray, okay
People change like numbers do, and that's way before the pay
I was dreaming of this way before today, so don't take me to that place where

[Chorus]
When days just turn to nights, and everything is new, and
You just play your part and I'll just play it too
That's when I'm coming home
That's when I'm coming home
When everything is faking, everybody's smiling
Nobody can hear you 'cause everybody's mouths
That's when I'm coming home
That's when I'm coming home
