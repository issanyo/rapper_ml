[Intro]
Yeah, Burd n' Keyz
Who that there, huh?
You ain't gonna ask no longer, right?
You ain't gonna ask no longer, right?
You ain't gonna ask no longer, longer

[Chorus]
Who that there, huh, everywhere we go (we go)
Everywhere we go (we go) everywhere we go
They saying who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go (we go) everywhere we go

[Verse 1]
Its me, jean jacket with the chopped sleeves
Showin off a young homie (zzzz)
No, no, no, I doin' him, him, him
Nah, nah, nah, I'm doing me's, me's, me's, me's
Grew up on the type of rap to really make you spit it
So if you see him kill it, you ain't gotta ask who did it
Girls say they totally love the way I'm singing
I said, baby, that's the hook
They check the verses that I'm bringin like
'Bout one year ago, I was all on my own (my own)
We was trying to get on, so I put the pen to my dome (my dome)
Wrote the realest shit in my life, then I put it all in a poem
Critics said that I was crazy, now everybody write they ass home

[Chorus]
Who that there, huh, everywhere we go (we go)
Everywhere we go (we go) everywhere we go
They saying who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go (we go) everywhere we go

[Verse 2]
It's me, never talkin' bout no molly
Or a rap to get a hottie on my body like a god-y
I'm tourin' up in Cali, but I wrote this in the lobby
People ask me who I am, I just give their ass a copy like
Take that shit and good news, baby, I'm back
Ain’t gone nowhere, yeah, that’s fact
You could tell by the way that I rap
Came up in this motherfucker, ain't nobody like it
Thought of what I thought of and now I gon' write it
Get up in the booth and its time that I recite it
Fuck waiting to blow, ya know I take that wick and lighter like
Dollar up in my pocket, tryna make this my own
Critics call my ass crazy now they writing they ass home
They sayin'

[Chorus]
Who that there, huh, everywhere we go (we go)
Everywhere we go (we go) everywhere we go
They saying who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go (we go) everywhere we go

[Verse 3]
Cool kid, cool kid, ay, tell me what you see
'Cause if I see it, I'mma be that, too, ay
Go ahead and follow me, follow me
That new kid, new kid, ay, it's all a buddy really be
Mama told me way back I'm a star
Now I'm walking down the street ,everybody that sees says

[Chorus]
Who that there, huh, everywhere we go (we go)
Everywhere we go (we go) everywhere we go
They saying who that there huh everywhere we go
Everywhere we go (we go) everywhere we go

[Outro]
You ain't gonna ask no longer, right?
You ain't gonna ask no longer, right?
No longer, right? No longer, right?
Yeah
