[Intro]
Shots fired

[Verse 1]
Back to the future
Catching air like I hit a Floaty Booter
Move, bitch, out the way like I'm Luda
I'm making moves like I'm doing Kama Sutra
Doing kama sutra
Move, bitch, out the way like I'm Luda
Doing kama sutra
Move, bitch, out the way like I'm Luda, hold up

[Pre-Chorus 1]
"I fell in love with you cause you made me feel
I fell in love with you cause you kept it real
Man, you done changed up on me, you changed your flow
Now I been hating on you everywhere I go"
Um, hold up

[Chorus]
No, I ain't too flawless and no, I ain't the best
And no, I don't say sorry and no, I ain't perfect
But I am the man, I am the man
Shots fired

[Verse 2]
Back to my business
Used to dreaming, now I muhfuckin' live this
Kill this shit, mister, can I get a witness?
Yelling "Move, bitch" like we doing fitness
Can I get a witness?
Yelling "Move, bitch" like we doing fitness
Can I get a witness?
Yelling "Move, bitch" like we doing fitness

[Pre-Chorus 2]
"I fell in love with you off that first mixtape
I fell in love with you cause rap ain't my thing
I thought that you were different, I guess I's wrong
Cause I ain't fucking with none of your new songs"
Um, hold up

[Chorus]
No, I ain't too flawless and no, I ain't the best
And no, I don't say sorry and no, I ain't perfect
But I am the man, I am the man
Shots fired

[Bridge]
I am the man, no, I ain't aim for no crown
But when you mention them, no, don't leave me out

[Chorus]
No, I ain't too flawless and no, I ain't the best
And no, I don't say sorry and no, I ain't perfect
But I am the man, I am the man
Shots fired
