[Hook]

(Go and tell my mom right now)
I’m already there
Oh Ooh Oh
(Man I’m...)
I’m already there
(Yeah!)
Oh Ooh Oh

[Verse One: SonReal]
It’s like
People always question when to seem to have a dream
Please apply the pressure I love challenges I’m keen
That’s why I take the long route with everything I steam
And hold my brain accountable for everything I’ve seen
Acting like I did in ninety six when I was ten
Back seat of truck yelling, “Daddy Daddy when?”
Will we reach the destination that we that we heading
Never understanding that I keep on moving for eleven
Years plus three, oh wait, that’s old as me
And I’m rollercoasting harder than I’d ever even dreamed
Since 09, yes a lot of things changed
It ain’t even been a year but check the rpm gauge
Pedal to the metal with my eye’s closed whistlin’
Cracking champagne with anybody listenin’
Spent a couple seconds racing with the hands of time
Until I took a closer look at where I’m at and realized that umm

[Hook]
(Yeah)
I’m already there
(We Go)
Oh Ooh Oh
(Yeah)
I’m already there
(Yeah)
Oh Ooh Oh
(We go so hard right)
I’m already there
(Haha)
Oh Ooh Oh
(I know rich kids be saying)
I’m already there
(Otay)
Oh Ooh Oh

[Verse Two: Promise]
Listen
I’m already there
I’m already home
No house arrest
Your boy is very grown
That was 06
That was stress up on my dome
Fast forward to 0’10
My goal is to be known
To be famous, no
This is entertainment though
Your face is on the screen
You see em creaming in the ray of hoes
You made it though
Under rated by hated by broke hopeless joe shmoes
That will give up their soul to play your position
Wishing they could do it like you you do it like none do
You said fuck the rest of the alphabet you done u
Shine like the sun do
Preach like Redrum do
Show em how to move in a room where dudes trying to trump you
This year I’ve flown the most I ever flew in my life
These missions are experiences that influence my life
You know the shit we go through in our life
Tell me where you need me to be I’ll be at the island boarding a porter flight
And that’s nice, fuck the price cuz

[Hook]
I’m already there
(Yep)
Oh Ooh Oh
(I know Vocabs saying)
I’m already there
(AH)
Oh Ooh Oh
(My man big pops saying)
I’m already there
Oh Ooh Oh
(My whole teams saying)
I’m already there
Oh Ooh Oh

[Verse Three: SonReal]
It’s like
People always love you when you seem to reach success
Quick to take your picture when you looking at your best
Still the same me, nothing new and nothing less
I just ain’t got my hands up on my head looking all stressed
(Not not more)
Still the same team, but built higher
Make that show even with a flat tire
Rock that stage like I ain’t gotta show again
Body that record like I ain’t going slow again
Light year mindstate, use what’s left of me
And like my man D said, dream is destiny
So I’mma just exemplify that
Family comes first I’mma emphasize that
It ain’t rocket science how we come together
Vokab, Big Pops, Double Header
And me and Rich unite a vivid motion
As we detonate this bomb and give this world a big explosion
Like, tick tick BOOM

[Hook]
I’m already there
Oh Ooh Oh
(I want you to say to yourself)
I’m already there
Oh Ooh Oh
(Congratulations)
I’m already there
Oh Ooh Oh
(I’mma say it one last time)
I’m already there
