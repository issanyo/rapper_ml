[Verse 1]
I'm out my sorrow, Kilimanjaro
Put it in the poem like Walt Whitman
Short flow with a tall rhythm
Got balls, so I ball with 'em, splish, all knittin'
Take you to the bank like Oprah
Off the shit I'm rockin' off my dome, no Jofa
Anybody sawin' logs bout to get woke up
New Jack, OG, popular as kale
They used to wanna see me get hit dead by a train
Now they all be catchin' feelings as they hop up on my rail
Shit got dry, so I'm pullin' in the whale
Two buckets and fuck it to an L
Jack and Jill went up the hill, but who the hell be down?
Do it for my city, yeah, I do it for my town
See a lady in the grocery store, I hold her down
With a "Hey, how's it going? Don't you know how it sound?"

[Chorus]
Blow, I ain't too damn cool now
To ask you how you do now
Hatin' on me, too, yeah, so have a nice day
Why people too damn quiet, yeah?
On a shit-talk diet, yeah, just some food for thought
Have a nice day

[Post-Chorus]
I ain't got no worry, I ain't got no worry
I ain't got no worry, I ain't got no worry
I pull up in a hurry, pull up in a hurry
I pull up in a hurry and say "Have a nice day"
I ain't got no worry, I ain't got no worry
I ain't got no worry, I ain't got no worry
I pull up in a hurry, pull up in a hurry
I pull up in a hurry and say "Have a nice day"

[Verse 2]
I ain't a one-trick bro-lo, a gold Tony Romo
Put it in a story like John Grisham
Love you like narcissism
Take one, yeah, my palm's itching
Blow, it sound bitching
Talk shit diet, on a keep it real hiatus
Let's be honest with the work, yeah, you ain't loggin' any data
Let's be honest with the perks, yeah, we ain't lyin' in no hammocks
I go back to back with annex, this ain't simple mathematics
Cartwheel over all the static, this ain't simple acrobatics
I'm about to order, had to treat the waiter like the CEO
People poppin' pills for the glam, actin' up for the 'Gram
Understand that's as real as a TV show
When shit hit the fan, I found that ain't nobody 'round
Do it for my city, yeah, I do it for my town
See a teller in the bank, you know I hold 'em down
With a "Hey, how's it going? Don't you know how it sound?"

[Chorus]
Blow, I ain't too damn cool now to ask you how you do now
Hatin' on me, too, yeah, so have a nice day
Why people too damn quiet, yeah?
On a shit-talk diet, yeah, just some food for thought
Have a nice day

[Post-Chorus]
I ain't got no worry, I ain't got no worry
I ain't got no worry, I ain't got no worry
I pull up in a hurry, pull up in a hurry
I pull up in a hurry and say "Have a nice day"
I ain't got no worry, I ain't got no worry
I ain't got no worry, I ain't got no worry
I pull up in a hurry, pull up in a hurry
I pull up in a hurry and say "Have a nice day"
