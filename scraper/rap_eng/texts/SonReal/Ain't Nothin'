[Intro]
(Ch-chyeah baby, come on)
Yeah what's your man got to do with me
(Hey now)
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin'
What's your man got to do with me
(Check it out, yo')

[Grieves]
This ain't a complicated question
I'm senior
Chillin' on the fifty-yard line with no freshman
Livin' like a legend
Got 'em lined up waiting for refreshments
Anybody poutin' can place their little lips around my erection
I am hard
Leavin' Charles in charge defy slander
Middle fingers up like where are my manners?
The whiskey goes down, but never do my standards
Lookin' like Sean Connery from Highlander
Badass
Get your fatass on the dance floor
Robot
Runnin' man
Wheelbarrow
Grassmoor
I hit the rhythem like that motherfucka asked for it
So watch me slow down, rewind and fast forward
Girl you know that I've been eyein' you
I wanna do some things that only freaks on private islands do
If I could spend some time with you I'd make you see the light
And show you how a funny lookin' dude can be your type
Shit

[Hook]
What's your man got to do with me?
(Yeah)
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin
What's your man got to do with me?
(hey hey hey hey)
What's your man got to do with me?
(Hey now)
Ain't nothin', Ain't nothin'
What's your man got to do with me?
(hey hey hey hey)

[Fearce Vill]
I'm [?] and never lost
But I'mma lose it they think I'm just some new kid
[?] get hit with a pool stick
[?] what you said in your music
Car rides but you're not that amusin'
All night and I gotta keep it movin'
Call twice and see who you is
I'm cruisin'
Gas mileage
I'm a fast pilot
I might smack that ass when I pass by it
While lookin' back smilin'
Might crash pilot
Got a huge head like I'm half giant
Let the haters talk while I count my cash silent
Livin' in the moment like there's not a tomorrow
The others not up to par
I'mma tell her drop off ya drawers
Then you can pop of ya bra
They gon' need to mop of the floor
Then we back it but not the mattress
Probably the wall
Everybody give [?]
I don't care for the hype
J.B.C you a stereotype
We imperial right
I've seen it all, this ain't new to me
You got a man?
Shit, what he got to do with me?

[Hook]
What's your man got to do with me?
(Yeah)
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin
What's your man got to do with me?
(hey hey hey hey)
What's your man got to do with me?
(Hey now)
Ain't nothin', Ain't nothin'
What's your man got to do with me?
(hey hey hey hey)

(Can your man do this?
Well uh
Can your man do this?
No?
Shit, didn't think so)

[Sonreal]
I ain't perfect but I'm workin' on it
Speakers she be twerkin' on it
Yeah they say I'm cool, but this new shit
I be Urkel on it
[?]
Who dat new cat with the boombat
Tell me where the hell is crew at
Better yet yo' where is Boo at
She be chillin' in the crowd
Ass like a blimp
Take a shit to make you hungry
[?] Pass me the shrimp
Surfin' through the crowd with no mast on the ship
One hand in the air
One hand on my shh-
What's your man got to do with me?
Nobody over there lookin' at me
Oh wait, now he runnin' over bookin' at me
Lookin' like he about to throw a fuckin' hook-it at me
Rapper problems, rapper problems
My bodega's [?]
So they whip a fuckin' you'ie like he 'bout to shit his pants
I ain't Bobby Bands, but this shit'll make you dance
Then she go and grab my hand
I said wait

[Hook]
What's your man got to do with me?
(Yeah)
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin
