I learned this shit from my pops
I just do it on top
Always knew my time would pass, since recording in the loft
Give a fuck who's who
I got things to do
So I been surfing my own wave on a blue sea doo

They don't like me no
Cause no one like me no
I press the snooze on ya'll and sing em kumbaya
I’ll sing anyway I want
I’ll rap anyway I feel
I do everything myself [?]

I been getting lonely
Hang up on the phonies
No one even know me just last year
Its Time I write the story
Now they can't ignore me
I be switching lanes every time I steer

Who you know hitting every angle like [?]
Who you know ain't afraid to talk about a loss ay
