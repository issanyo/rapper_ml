Well Alright, Okay
If We Ain't Already There
Then We're On Our Way, Today(Today)
Not Tomorrow
Because Tomorrows Too Far Away(Away)
From Me Now. [X2]

[Verse One] - RICH KIDD

Well alright, okay
Feeling like Lil Jon on my east side wage
But I'm west end raised
And i gotta let' em know that, You gon' hold that
Hanging on to every word I say
I deserve to get payed, Working harder then most
'Cuz i don't want to go back to margarine 'n' Toast
And i won't ever relax, This musics in my soul
And I know many will crash, Gotta stay in control
With my hands on the wheel, tires on the pavement
Hitting and running on these women, It's reckless and ???
Now my focus is Luchini, too greedy, nah, I put my nigga's on
Ask Huddini
It's all starting to take shape, It's Too 3D
Uh, we make good news spread like VD
It's all hype, always, all like, onstage, All night, All day
Alright, Okay

[Verse Two] - JD ERA

Took a chance and didn't think twice
You wouldn't either if you this nice
Win or lose, You gotta roll the dice
Above the clouds, That's where i live life
The high grade cologne had us puffin and
Discussing Til like 6 in the morn'
I knew that one day i would wake up and get
Whatever i want, Do whatever i want
Fuck whoever i want
I want my money today, Not tomorrow, Today!
Got that from my homie Kamakaze, That's what
He say
But that was back in the day, Now they Get
Wit' us ???
Was no room for us to follow, Had to make
Us away
I tell 'em dream and achieve, Make a plan and
Believe
Give your all and be thankful, The blessings
That you receive
I mean these bitches they love me, I'm Hugh
Hefner, oh
First i take over the city then i take over the
Globe!

[Verse Three] - SonReal

Yeah, I made something out of nothing, [Nadda]
If Life's a bitch you can call a bro McLovin
Put it all together, Pop her in the oven
Boy I'm hungry
When i write like this, you know I'm up to something
Like, You Know That
Like, '0-10, no one knew I broke
Now I got believers like I signed up with that Scooter Braun
This that very moment that I justify that "who would'a known"
Mentality you was on fore you knew that I was gone, Like
Tenth cross the bars, Playin my position, With ambition like
Malaun
Haters came up missing, I was busy while you was snoring, because
I knew that's what it took, for you to listen to my song
Pick a road then flip a coin, you never knew when my shit is going
My shit is on, some other doo-doo, if it sound dope, that is probably due too
All the time, pop it in, put it wit da pain, no Vicodin, already then
I'm hyped again, now chill
