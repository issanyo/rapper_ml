[Verse 1: Dominique Young Unique]
Yeah, you know I thought it was real but-
Uh I'm finna do my thing
Can't believe, what you did you left me insane
Man, I thought you was a real one
Can't look me in my eyes
You don't say nothing
Damn all these things I done sacrifice
You don't want to let go, boy you fighting for it
Like Mike Tyson for it
I know it wasn't real, man, perfect illusion
All this right here is heat of fusion
Can't complain, lets get to conclusion
I'm winning but you losing
Say what
I'm winning but you losing

[Chorus: Lemon]
It wasn’t love, it wasn’t love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

[Verse 2: Dominique Young Unique]
Heart beating 125 on the meter
Look me in my eyes
I don't never never lie
All this time went by you didn't do it right boy
You was counterfeit, I was authentic
I'm the one always make moves
Sitting here watching you
What you gone do
Getting out of this make me want to dance and groove
Like it was in June

[Chorus: Lemon]
It wasn’t love, it wasn’t love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

[Bridge: Lemon & Dominique Young Unique]
(Oh my gosh)
It was a perfect illusion
You were a perfect illusion
Mistaken for love
Mistaken for love
Mistaken for love
Ooh, yeah

[Spoken Outro: Dominique Young Unique]
Hold on, hold on
Uh
While you sitting over there on the couch
Acting like I don't know what's going on
I done been through all your text messages
You been texting that same raggedy girl
Nappy hair, drag foot
I took your necklace
All your jewellery
You know what? I should take all this to the pawn shop
I'm done, you keep cheating over and over and over
What girl gone put up with that? Not me
Uh-uh
I done flock all your credit cards
I shut down your bank account
I'm gonna have the last laugh
[?[
Know dat
I can't take this no more
Get the fuck out my house
