Miss Fred, hello world
My world, you know, you know

Niggas on me because I’m fresh
Apple bottom jeans with the bathing ape hat
Keep hating I'mma you come last
I’m finna show my ass
And get your boys to count my cash

Niggas on me because I’m fresh, Baby Phat heels on
Girl pictured that
Cost me bout' 250 (hold that)
All that flawgen! Bih buy that

Too real so gutter to the game
Keep em hating love them hating cuz' they see my name
CK gave me my strength cuz' I love my fame
I ain't trying to get attention cuz' I rap my pain
Thinking I ain't strap bih with the goons getcha your shit stain
Coming hard to the game everything going to change
Lil' dominique stacking decks do my thing
I’m a switch my style that’s the way it’s going down
I’m a come so hard to the beat got a team
We can’t defeat make a move that’s my dream
I’m stepping out the building so fresh so clean
I’m a pop my collar let em know I’m on the scene
Now turn the music up, I’m finna get real
Make a nigga make a nigga pop a pill
Turn off the lights camera action and chill
Run up in your place take your money and kill

I’m a take nigga break a nigga take a nigga life
And messing with unique you fucking
With your life
