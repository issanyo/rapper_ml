What about that girl, she's a lady
She's only 18 riding in Mercedes
She's doing her thing, big dreams like Oprah
But she's slim, yeah, with a pretty little face
She says her favorite bitch is miss Trina
But she ain't fucking when she fucking freed with the brain
I got your hoes, yeah, going insane
But guess what miss Unique, yeah, doing her thing
You are the baddest rapper in the fucking game
Black diamond, yeah, royal to my game
Miss show stopping pussy popping on a head stand
I make ya hoes salute before you step in my lane

What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique
What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique
What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique
What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique

What about my like a flicker
I'm posing for your camera pictures
Pretty, pretty girl, diamonds and pearls
Doesn't satisfy, start on my leg
I eat it up like my daddy good corn bread
Who is she, not no super head
I'm the bitch that ride with my baby
380 by my side, ride or die

What about me, I'm a stripper
Not the fucking stripper on the pole
I'm the one who cock back and let it go
And have you undress from head to toe

What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique
What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique
What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique
What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique

What about me, what, what about me
Miss Unique, miss, miss Unique
