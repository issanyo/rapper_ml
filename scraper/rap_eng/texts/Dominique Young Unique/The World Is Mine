First trip there, it was so amazing
Pretty light stars (like the cold bars)
It's London, first move I'm here now
I'm gonna show'em how da pretty girl get down

The girl is mine
The world is mine
The girl is mine
The world is mine

I'm touring here and rapping it like it's my town
When I step off the plane, I thought it was a dream
Like Martin Luther King said in his script
But was real anines, my fame was famous
I perform in clubs, cargo the main like hot girl when I did the damn thing
When I stepped out, damn I was in the world
18 of age travelling like I'm the girl

The girl is mine
The world is mine
The girl is mine
The world is mine

Like really, yes, I'm the girl
Whipped the passport out, yes it's my go
Why you girls touching me, no homo
I'm a pretty lady getting tons of cheddar though
But, anyway, back to the trip thin
Second day, out of control shopping no brain
Your hoes assassinating like the fucking trigger flames
I'm on fire, call me hot girl insane
Oh, I was so thirsty like
Oh ,I was so thirsty right
I rock the stage yeah, I'm the girl, oh dur
Your hoes can't touch me, I got plenty cash

The girl is mine
The world is mine
The girl is mine
The world is mine

Yeah, yeah, yeah, showing my little ass
You know, yeah, yeah, back on blast
Shoot a video
People all on the floor
In London they party and don't go
US rock the party like a bitch over dose
Why you girls like that, first of all
I'm getting getting money than you could ever solve
Excuse me, I'm a boss chick
I'm in London, around the world like a bad chick, you dig?
