[Verse 1: Dominique Young Unique]
It's not up to me, it's not A-13
It's not the Circle K at the top of street
I know it may seem debonair
But there's time on the line that we just can't spare
Hold up everybody, put it all on ice
Gotta feeling on the mic that's twice as nice
Gotta cope with the dope by cutting soap
So turned on livin' out my horoscope

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ninja]
No one can do it like we can
We take the stand with a master plan
We are the educated, motivated, skin-tight, rawhide, hardworkin'
Blood sweatin', hollerin', your world wreckin'
Ladies of eighty three
Ladies you want to be
We're not the first, but that matters least
'Cause there's free rough justice for the masterpiece

[Chorus]
I said a panther is what a cougar ain't
What a royal wants to be, what a hustler can't
What the ladies like, what the fellas love
What U L C can't get enough of
I said now, walk like a panther
I said, walk like a panther
What the ladies like, what the fellas love
What U. L. C. can't get enough of

[Verse 2: Dominique Young Unique]
We got no second chance, we got a soldier's stance
We got the thrills in our skills that you can't advance
Never gonna get ninety nine percent
My get up and go, just got up and went
So unrelenting, pay strict attention
My mind is heading In the right direction
More hits than bazooka smooth
Our guarantee is we can move

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ninja]
Our Q and A don't ricochet
We make the play with a double A
We are the educated, motivated, skin tight, rawhide, hardworkin'
Blood sweatin, hollerin, your world wreckin'
Ladies of eighty three
Ladies you want to be
We're not the first but that matters least
Cos theres free rough justice for the masterpiece

[Chorus]
I said, a panther is what a cougar ain't
What a royal wants to be, what a hustler can't
What the ladies like, what the fellas love
What U L C can't get enough of
I said now, walk like a panther
I said, walk like a panther
What the ladies like, what the fellas love
What U. L C. can't get enough of

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I got rockets to the left of me
Bullets to the right of me
Flames to the back of me
Spark the TNT
Cobras to the left of me
Vipers to the right of me
We're the G-O-T-E-A-M

Oh, oh, double O-P
Oh oh double O-P
We say, you say
You say, we fly
You're the ones we notify

[Chorus]
I said a panther is what a cougar ain't
What a royal wants to be, what a hustler can't
What the ladies like, what the fellas love
What U L C can't get enough of
I said now, walk like a panther
I said, walk like a panther
What the ladies like, what the fellas love
What U. L. C. can't get enough of

One nine, one three
You know you wanna be like me
One nine, one three
We gotta life to set free
One nine, one three
We gonna shake the AKG
One nine, one three
You wanna bring it back like me
