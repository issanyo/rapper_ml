Miss Unique, oh yeah
I'm ready for that right now

Hoes wanna be like me, got game miss Unique
Hoes keep on watching me and niggas keep on jocking me
The police on my tail fuck'em
They can't catch me
I'm like a wild cat running out with no leash
I stay shining like a mouth full of gold teeth
Hustling thugs and gangsters all on me
I'm too fly, you all ready know
Bay girl 18 pocket full of doe
Rolling with big dogs, pass the draw
I'm on cloud 9, can't hit no mo'
Money on my mind, I'm on the straw
Getting money is the motivation, let's go
1, 2, 3 to the 4
I'm a bad ass bitch, I'mma let you hoes know

On the grind I'mma say I don't give a fuck
He got the long dreads
Feeling up in the back of the club
I'm funa grind on this nigga, show him that's what's up
But I ain't feeling daddy, I gotta get in his pockets
They call me miss Unique, there's not gonna be no stopping
There's not gonna be no stopping
Man fuck this club shit, I'm trying to get to the crib
Daddy had a mean swag and I like his whip
But i ain't trying to fall in love, yeah
Daddy ya thug, I gotta do my thing
I got a nasty game
I know you got a girl
But she ain't gotta know
It's just a one night stand, daddy I ain't no ho
I'm just a hustler, I gotta get it and go
Miss Unique on a mission
So fuck you ho, so fuck you ho
Music for millions
