I'm a gangsta, hard hitter outta 813

Respect me, I'm on fire girl

Catch him at the house stepping out the shower, girl
You gotta a lot girls claiming to be a soldier in the bedroom, I make'em retire girl

War talk, war talk, war talk, war talk
All you motherfuckers just take a walk, walk
Get up on my block and you will feel this Glock
War talk, war talk, war talk, war talk
All you motherfuckers just take a walk, walk
Get up on my block and you will feel this Glock

Many times you fought, life is up in the street
Many times you fought, who's ready to get beat
Like too all my ladies in the street killing beam
Knocking they're bussing niggas down
Making up weed
But still freed by my side on the battle field
Any nigga who step to him, I promise to kill
Fill your body with lead and my words are real
Move your body on the ground, let your Magnum milk
We don't fight, we kill, kill, kill, kill

War talk, war talk, war talk, war talk
All you motherfuckers just take a walk, walk
Get up on my block and you will feel this Glock
War talk, war talk, war talk, war talk
All you motherfuckers just take a walk, walk
Get up on my block and you will feel this Glock

War talk, war talk, war talk, war talk
All you motherfuckers just take a walk, walk
Get up on my block and you will feel this Glock
War talk, war talk, war talk, war talk
All you motherfuckers just take a walk, walk
Get up on my block and you will feel this Glock
