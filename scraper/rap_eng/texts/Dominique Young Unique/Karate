[Verse 1: Dominique Young Unique]
Started out with just a little fun
Now we workin' out in every room
Yeah, the more that you like
Yeah, the more that I like
I don't mind if I call you Jackie Chan
You, you could be my, be my stunt man
If the rough what you like
Yeah, the rough what I like

Cause you're a black belt in the things you do
It's the things you're doing to me
Ain't no wonder then that it's me, you
You, me, all we need is you & me
Boy you changed my life the things you doing so right
Cause you're a black belt in the tings you do
It's the things you're doing to me

[Chorus: Mandy Jiroux & Dominique Young Unique]
We up all night with karate
I love those moves that you show me
Lovin' me like hah!
Kissin' me like hah!
I go on you, you, I go on top!

We up all night with karate
Just us, let's call it a party
Touchin' me like hah! (like what?)
Kissin' me like hah! (like what?)
I go on you (what?), you, I go on top!

[Verse 2: Dominique Young Unique]
Up all night drinking on Margarita
It's cold outside, put on the heat
Me, you, me, you in the room it's going down
I ain't talking about that!
Ya mind in the gutta
It's a good night, we don't need the club, right?
Playing Uno, man, I done win twice
Jumping on the bed, ready for a pillow fight
Karate! Kick yo ass like jet-li
You the best dude I had, hahahaha, might be
I see you staring at my body
Watching me like TV hahaha sexually

[Chorus: Mandy Jiroux & Dominique Young Unique]
We up all night with karate
I love those moves that you show me
Lovin' me like hah!
Kissin' me like hah!
I go on you, you, I go on top!

We up all night with karate
Just us, let's call it a party
Touchin' me like hah!
Kissin' me like hah!
I go on you, you, I go on top!

[Verse 3: Dominique Young Unique]
Rap the games up pop!
Popa rated, you trying to stick it in na-na-navigated!
Banging all night, night
I mean assassinated, assasinated, I mean assassinated
You remember where we left off?
He was watching me like TV
You're cute when you beggin' me please
Fighting for this love, karate!

[Bridge: Mandy Jiroux]
Feeling good, sing, sing, sing, sing with me
Sing, sing, sing, sing with me
Feeling good, sing, sing, sing, sing with me
Sing, sing, sing, sing with me
Man, Karate! (yaah!)

[Chorus: Mandy Jiroux & Dominique Young Unique]
We up all night with karate

Lovin' me like hah! (yeah!)
Kissin' me like hah!
I go on you, you, I go on top!

We up (yay!) all night with karate (hey!)
Just us (yaah!), let's call it a party

Kissin' me like hah!
I go on you, you, I go on top!
