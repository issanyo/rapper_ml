[Chorus: Justin Tranter]
Put them cherries on ice, ice, ice
Put them cherries on ice, ice, ice
Put them cherries on ice, ice, ice
Put them cherries on ice, play nice

[Verse 1: Justin Tranter]
Where your hips at? Where your hips at? Where your hips at?
Where your fist at? Where your fist at? Where your fist at?
Where your lips at? Where your lips at? Where your lips at?
Where your kiss at? Where your kiss at? Where your kiss at?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Tranter]
I ain't your mama
But I'm your drama

[Chorus 2: Justin Tranter]
You make my heart stop! (When you're drunk)
You make my lips lock! (Your lips lock)
You make my head spin! (Ring the bells)
You make my heart stop! (When you're drunk)

[Chorus: Justin Tranter]

[Verse 2: Justin Tranter & Dominique Young Unique]
Where you drink at? Where you drink at? Where you drink at?
Where your puddy-cat? Where your puddy-cat? Where your puddy-cat?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
You make my heart stop! (When you're drunk)
You make my lips lock! (Your lips lock)
You make my head spill! (Ring the bells)
You make my heart stop! (When you're drunk)

You make
Every single bitch this side of Missisip'
Just wish, wish, wish that she had you
Every single bitch this side of Missisip'
Just wish, wish, wish that she had you

[Outro: Justin Tranter & Dominique Young Unique](4x)
(Cherries on ice, ice, ice)
Put them cherries on ice, ice, ice
Put them cherries on ice, ice, ice
Put them cherries on ice, ice, ice
Put them cherries on ice, play nice

I ain't your mama
But I'm your drama
