Dominique Young Unique
Tell them to burn my shit
Ha, we gotta another one
Get em

[Verse 1]
Ugh
Pop, pop, pop, pop that thang
I'm popping shit
Like I'm popping in the gun range
I'm tearing it up
While these niggas so close range
Take a selfie, bitch
I got to get the aim

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yea, these girls is my daughters
She don't won't no smoke
Bitch this ain't law, an order
Call Papa Johns
I'm about to put in order
I'm slaughter any one of you
Mental disorder

[Chorus]
So take two steps back when we on the floor
Make it all round out when I see the show
When we out here It's going off
Like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke
When you walk up
Know you in the red zone
Make it so damn hot
Give you gunstroke
When we out here It's going off
Like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke

[Verse 2]

Shake that bitch body
Swerving  bugatti

[Chorus]
So take two steps back when we on the floor
Make it all round out when I see the show
When we out here It's going off
Like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke
When you walk up
Know you in the red zone
Make it so damn hot
Give you gunstroke
When we out here It's going off
Like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke

[Bridge]
Gotta keep your head up

Look boy if you touch it
Ima come round (come round )
So keep your head up
When you run your mouth (run your mouth)
Keep it in your lane
While you fucking with the greatest

[Chorus]
So take two steps back when we on the floor
Make it all round out when I see the show
When we out here It's going off
Like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke
When you walk up
Know you in the red zone
Make it so damn hot
Give you gunstroke
When we out here It's going off
Like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke, like gunsmoke (x2)
