[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo, yo

Keep talking hoes, keep lipping
Keep talking I'mma rush ya like the Russians
Nobody don't want to see young ...
You better grab your man
Yeah, that nigga keep blushing
She don't want me on her song cause I crushed her
A crane bitch, I'm finna go insane
You don't grip the .45, ho it's all lies
Fuck a AB bitch, I'mma ride or die

These bitches keep wondering who the fuck is I

Puffing on the Garcia Vega like Audi
I see you rap bitches throwing top shottas
Just aim the right way before I kill your guardian

[Hook]

Thinking that you're bringing me down
Champion sound

Hot like the hot street wave on fiya
Hello to you sir, I say hiya
These bitches can't stand me it's dandy

Tell this ho to make her mind up like really - oh
