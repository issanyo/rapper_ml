[Verse 1]
My flow drops like an earthquake, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake
I make that ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake
It's time to devastate, devastate, devastate, devastate, devastate, dev-dev-dev-dev-devastate
Hit 'em, make the glass break, glass break, glass break, break, break, break, break

[Hook]
Drop like an earthquake

[Verse 2]
My flow harder than a bitch fucking good dope
These hoes hating, why these hoes so cut throat
One hit wonder bitch, I make that shit pop
He told me to go in, fresh, I pop that shit
My flow shake hard, harder than Alaska quake
The one in 1964, it was devastate
These bitches wonder who I is, tell 'em shake 'n' bake
Ricky Bobby, bitch, I'm nobody
Shake that ass on the floor, let me see you wobble it
Tell them to burn my shit when you hit that replay girl
Smokin' while I'm riding, bitch, nigga, hiding
Do this shit like every day

[Hook]
Drop like an earthquake

[Bridge]
DJ Fresh, where Diplo at?
Hey Diplo, I see you, baby! (Ugh)

[Verse 3]
It'll make the ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, gr-ground sha-
Play my shit, hit the replay, replay, replay, replay, replay, re-re-re, replay
I will never hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate
Hit 'em, make the glass break, glass break, glass break, break, break, break, break

[Hook]
Drop like an earthquake
(yeah, play my shit, uh)
(yeah, aha)
Drop like an earthquake
