[Verse 1]
Booty popping on the head stand
I ride that dick, yeah boy, with no hands
You talking to me? Uh uh, I don't comprehend
I'm with that freaky shit, smell of berries, lick it good
And if you can't lick the pink to the girlie-hood
Eat it up, daddy, eat
It
Up, front and bite
Make that ass clap, yes, it's only right
And if you love me, baby, I'mma love you right
Sixty-nine, I'm with it, make this pussy split
Oh my, mmm, it's really 'licious
Miss unique, yes, I'm so vicious
Yes, yes, I'm so vicious

[Hook]
Pussy popping (I ride it)
Pussy popping (I ride it)
Pussy popping on the head stand

Pussy popping (I ride it)
Pussy popping (I ride it)
Pussy popping on the head stand

[Verse 2]
My sex game amazing, I'm so bright
His face game, yes, it's so right
But he's a little winky down south, shut your mouth
I'm aggressive when I ride your face, bouncy bounce
I know your bitch don't like, tell her to chill out
But if she wanna join, she gotta give me her mouth
And if you don't like, bye bye, get out
The girly wet, slippery drippery, with no doubt
Lick it 'till your tongue get numb, ho don't
Wait, daddy, I think I better get ready and (mmm)
It's very moist, I turn you on, my sexy voice
Like mmm (mmm)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been an animal, what the fuck ya talking 'bout?
The freaky bitch, yeah, right here, down south
Ball wash, not that, I've been top notch
I got your hoes licking me like the wash dryer
You can't complain, I'm on your fucking man, best flyer
He's lying to you, he's a fucking big liar
You's a fucking rat, he's a fucking mouse trap
I've been a rock star, you, you fall back
Not on my level, freaky game, I'm so undercover
It's your turn, you wanna lick it like a lollipop?
This pussy go pop pop, right in your mouth
Ha ha (where they do that at?)
Down south

Unique (oh!)(x4)
