[Intro]
So you're the balloon, you've got that helium, and we travel with you through the string. So we're going up there with you even though we're on the ground. We can't fly, I can't sing, I can't make music, but I can get a-- I can buy it. So I can get a balloon. I can't fly, but I can get a helium balloon

[Verse 1]
I used to put my faith in the yarn, and now communication is gone
I agree we've gone distant, my new location the charts
Naw, mm, can't count the days, but let's just say five
Years, coming of age, it make you blow by your day job
So cry for me, wild for me
It's a horror story, eyes 20/20s that I-M-E your normal C
And I'd be different gettin' diplomas in peace
But gettin' applause and across, I'm hittin' Diplo for a beat
Slight work to Dahi, it's a purpose y'all see
In a world of dopplegangers, niggas ain't worth the copy
You capiche? You got me? Cool!
Niggas'll fly you up this high, won't let you fly to the moon
Goin' up!

[Verse 2]
They love your moves made 'til you make moves
Achievin' new feats every few 8 shoes
16, took a nigga dream different
Had SOBs lookin' like it's new Supreme in it
See that the line's been beastin'
The main attraction, I got 'em hangin' their cleats up
I've been keepin' it G
It's levels to this fellow, hello, I resemble the cheat codes
Some shit good, some shit flop
Some love to see you blow, they don't want see you pop
Shit good, some shit nah
Some shit recycled like second timers in Tour de France
First you picked up, now you picked apart
You get too far 'til your core fans au revoir
They like, "You stuck with us, cause you let him fly"
Swear this life is like a helium balloon, I'm sorry
But I gotta fly

[Interlude]
Now when a kid gets a helium balloon, he's holding that string and he's keeping this balloon from going anywhere. But he also wants to let it go

[Verse 3]
Gave you a contract, stay true through all that
Came through with Ross, writin' bangers for y'all
But I ain't lose my content, fuck all that nonsense
Diverse with rappin', I'm a writer with passion
Tell the purist that laugh I don't reach out for daps
Cause "No Hands" triple platinum
Better writings for retail, why not see my detail?
Gettin' box office spins, only box I fit in is by thigh on a female
So they hatin' me for that, sayin' I just make women songs
It's perfect style, every versatile got me right where her walls at
Still know what my core needs, so fuck who ignores me
'For I need niggas, I'll purchase three mirrors
And show y'all what's for me

[Interlude]
So he wants to let it go and he wants to catch it. Eventually he loses it, he doesn't want to lose it

[Bridge]
Why they give a fuck about the songs I write?
As long as my thugs and my fans them nice
Movin' forward with my life
Crucify me, man of Jesus Christ
Nah do no more favor
Cause 'nough of them are traitor
Them a real back-biter
Them a try take your glory and your energy
Buffalo soldier
Selassie tell them man a gangster
And mi no see no boy me 'fraid of
Them are try take your glory and your energy

[Outro]
Whatever, tell 'em it's whatever
Wanna see me good or never see me better?
Fuck 'em, can't say nothin'
Cause the same hand heal you might cut you
Fuck 'em, you ain't sayin' nothin'
Cause the same hand heal you might cut you
Whatever, tell 'em it's whatever
Wanna see me good but never see me better?
