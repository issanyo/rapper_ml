[Verse 1]
I might skrrt off of on the lot in a drop
I might put a elevator in the spot
Neighbors always gon' call the damn cops
Cause they could smell the OG up the block
In Miami, bought a yacht
Gotta thank God cause we elevate a lot
I see you hatin' and I find it kind of odd
I pick the ride, press to start to come alive
I know the plug, swear to God, that's my guy
Every time I get a pack, it be fire
Got a nigga super high
You could see the red in my eyes

[Hook]
Come see what we on
[?] look like Jim Jones
[?] just like pink [?]
New hundred, need that, that's what we on
Rack it up, stack it up
Talk [?] back it up
Rack it up, stack it up
Talk [?] back it up

[Verse 2]
Let me check the Rollie just to see if it shine
Last time I checked I was ahead of my time
And your bitch just gave me neck [?] my mind
If you think about, she get that shit from her mom
But she a needy bitch
But she a freaky bitch
Hit it in on the wall on some TV shit
Hit her on the 'mand on some TV shit
We got hella bands to blow
Shout out Gucci [?] Texico
Free my nigga Mexico
[?] Mexico

[Hook]
Come see what we on
[?] look like Jim Jones
[?] just like pink [?]
[?] just like pink [?]
Come see what we on
[?] look like Jim Jones
[?] just like pink [?]
[?] just like pink [?]
