[Verse 1]
Woozy, I’m feeling woozy, I’m downing D’usse
D’usse, I’m ‘bout to lose it, my life like movies
My bitch boujie, she put her name on my uzi
Gucci hold the tooly, tooly sing like Skooly
Hot boy like Juvy, I get high like Cooly
You niggas is clueless, your bitch tryna woe me
Ooh, perkys kickin’ in, ooh, lean is kickin’ in
Ooh, i’m just blinkin’ in, countin’ chickens

[Hook]
My life for real, I’m throwed off for real
I count dough for real, I’m loyal for real
I’m here for real, my ice all real
My guys for real, you might die for real
Naw, for real, real recognize real
These niggas ain’t real, I’m here for real
Naw, for real, real recognize real
These niggas ain’t real, I’m here for real

[Verse 2]
Choosing, these bitches choosing, I see ‘em choosing
Money, they money hungry, they want my money
Leaching, I see ‘em leaching, these niggas creeping
Hang around for no reason, hang around for no reason
The coupe ain’t got no room for nobody
I ain’t got none’ to prove to nobody
Ok you lil niggas, ain’t soon, you got no bodies
Ok be worried ‘bout your ho, she just got bodied

[Hook]
My life for real, I’m throwed off for real
I count dough for real, I’m loyal for real
I’m  for real, my ice all real
My guys for real, you might die for real
Naw, for real, real recognize real
These niggas ain’t real, I’m here for real
Naw, for real, real recognize real
These niggas ain’t real, I’m here for real
