[Hook: Key!]
Life is a bitch, you can't do nothin' but love it
Watch me blow this cash, it ain't nothin' but money
Shit on all these niggas, show my ass out in public
Niggas hate, but bitches love it when we stuntin'
Life is a bitch, you can't do nothin' but love it
Watch me blow this cash, it ain't nothin' but money
Shit on all these niggas, show my ass out in public
Niggas hate, but bitches love it when we stuntin'

[Verse 1: Sonny Digital]
Life is a bitch, but I motherfucking love it, yea
Money over bitches, can't put nothin' above it, yea
Gotta run it up, okay, I need me some more of that
Why they hate the kid?
Shit, I don't know what's up with that
Gucci Flip Flops, just to lounge around the crib
Lavish lifestyle, Birdman, that's how I live
Gotta watch these bitches, man, my nigga I'm for real, yea
Gotta watch these niggas, cause they get it how they live
Yea, Atlanta on, Gucci home, ain't no clone
Most these niggas ain't put him on
You ain't take no risk, you can't live like this
Taking major risks just to live like this

These bitches love me, I'm sippin' bubbly
My life is lovely, put nothin' above me
I'm ridin' 'round crusin' in your town
I'm goin' up and still puttin' it down
These hoes be callin' and they callin' every night
I ride around like I'm on a dirt bike
