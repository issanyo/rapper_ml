Hook:
And she bussin and she bissin
And she do that thang for me
Now we fuckin and she cussin
She can't take no more of me
I don pinned her ass down
She can't go no where no more
And I stroke I stroke

Chorus:
I can't be ya man (why)
Cus you turnin me on
Girl stop all that playin (uhh)
Keep tellin me no
Say you got a man (uhh)
Wat you tellim me for?
Its just that certain shit (what)

Im so player, im so player, im so player, im so play
Im so player, im so player, im so player, im so play
Im so player, im so player, im so player, im so play
Im so player, im so player

Verse 1 (Skooly):
Ima player baby
These hoes my trick bike
And I call her my plumber
She know how to twist pipes
Drop 4 and a big sprite
Let you roll like 6 kites
Then we roll like 6 ties
Out to the neighborhood fish fry
Player
Always up to no good
Ya brother a hater
Cus I'm always up in his hood
Probably got a bitch that he want but he can't get
With the crew that he watch but he ain't with
State kid
Jackie Chan, Jet Lee, Bruce Lee
And his crew on the same shit
Bit he ain't shit

(Chorus)

Verse 2 (Keleb):
You tellin' me you got a man with a stale face
That ain't my problem
The only problem is girl there ain't no problem
And 'im all in church
Bashin' all the pretty girls in the choir
And I'm still player
Seen her yesterday (ha)
And tomorrow
Young tommy had said might break me a young bitch today
So if you young dont let tet swing my way
Oh I'm a grown ass kid
Don't hop all day I play
And she still don't got a splinter but she been on the wood
Yell all day

(Chorus, then hook, then chorus)
