[Intro]
Gas Station Owner: "Hey buddy."
Man: "What bro?"
Gas Station Owner: "Hey, Move your car man. You can't-"
Man: "Fuck you man."
Gas Station Owner: "You can't stay in front of my store like that. You're messing up business man."
Man: "Aight bro, chill out."
Gas Station Owner: "God damn."

[Hook]
I got gas like a fucking gas station
But the pump's out of order be patient
You want work then put in application
Cash only no credit card payment
I got gas like a fucking gas station
I got gas like a fucking gas station
I got gas like a fucking gas station
I got gas like a fucking gas station

[Verse 1: Mike Fresh]
Me and Que we makin' quick flips at the quick trip
Started out with 6 bowls now I'm down to 6 hits
I said you need to play a ticket we can do it
I put that popcorn in your candy that's a movie
325 for the zone and I might do 12 for the phone
But that's small change you want the whole thing then maybe we can talk a lil' lower
See I used to fall with that 89 but that mid-grade move slower
I got them lucky charms, no pot of gold but you can find you a 4-leaf clover

[Pre-Hook]
I got that loud smell sticking to your clothes
Laughing gas coming through the bong holes
Break it down sell it to all of your friends
Thank you for your business buddy come again

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Que]
I got gas like my name [?]
Make a nigga look like Yao Ming
93 Octane
No Reggie, just Irene
You can here it even when it's in the wrapper
AKA that alpaca
1 hit'll get your mind right
Make a nigga take off like NASA
Got gas on me, no unleaded
All I blow is that diesel
Paranoid higher than an eagle
Shakin' like I got the measles
How you say you rich
But your guards full of men
5 for a blunt
What you smokin' is for kids
That's Reggie Miller with that Pacer pack
If I was you, I'd take it back
I don't even see how you facin' that
And who the hell convinced you to pay for that
That's headache weed with seeds in it
And if I was you I'd be mad
You need to go back to that same nigga
And tell him to swap it out for the cash

[Hook]
