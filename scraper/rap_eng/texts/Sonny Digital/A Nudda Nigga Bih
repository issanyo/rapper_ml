Another nigga bitchh
I'm with another nigga bitch
She another nigga bitch
She another nigga bitch
I'm with another nigga bitch
I'm with another nigga bitch
You know me I'm with the shits
I'm with another nigga bitch

[Verse 1]
She another nigga woman
But she feel so good on me
I like the way she give it to me
However I want it
He calls when we are alone I let her pick up the phone
We just be laughing that shit a shame
But that shit I [?]
I know we wrong but that's just how we play
I know he hitting wrong cause its so tight
And what we do is wrong, why it feel so right
She don't like it slow she like it rough
That's why she like me more cause I beat it up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She misses me, she wishes we
Had what we had in the past
But that's the past
And when she passed all I saw was ass
Shit come here with your pretty ass
You know my nigga but you ain't his friend though
I just keeping it real I ain't going to pretend though
What the fuck I've been knowing you since Nintendo
Playing Sega your middle name Genesis
Remember I had you fucked up on that Hennessy
Cause you drunk it all up
A toast to memories we got history
How about history repeat itself right here

[Hook]
