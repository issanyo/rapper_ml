[Intro]
I look so coo coo, motherfucker
Smokin on tutu, motherfucker

[Chorus]
All these niggas hating on me cause
My wrist is like a freezer
Smelling like loud, I'm a reeker
All black, I'm the Grim Reaper
Whose bitch this is, she's a freaker
Whose homie is this, he's a geeker
Get yo ass off the court, sit in the bleachers
I walk in and you know I tweak up for tweakers

[Verse 1]
One thousand dollar peacoat, nigga
My car a speedboat, nigga
We walk up in the party turn into a limo, nigga
Don't come for me lil nigga
Go and find Nemo, nigga
Get your face repo-ed, nigga
Go to sleep lil nigga
Yo bitch want me to save her, I'm no hero nigga
Call me subzero, nigga
How I freeze hoes, nigga
These niggas always copying, where the kinko's nigga
You think I own moo and oink with all these meatrolls, nigga
Call me Sosa Future all these freak hoes, nigga
Call me Sosa Turner how I beat hoes, nigga
You know I got the burner got the heat lil nigga
If you can't stand me go take a seat lil nigga (Bang)

[Chorus]
All these niggas hating on me cause
My wrist is like a freezer
Smelling like loud, I'm a reeker
All black, I'm the Grim Reaper
Whose bitch this is, she's a freaker
Whose homie is this, he's a geeker
Get yo ass off the court sit in the bleachers
I walk in and you know I tweak up the tweakers

[Verse 2]
Where my food Blood?
Where my food cuz?
I like mula, don't like rumors
Maison Margielas fuck Concords
My Nina a tomboy
I ain't got time for it
Go wait in line for it
I'm cooling with my boys
We blow at you and your boys
You say that you're balling you ain't got nothing to show for it
Bitch I like driving
What I need a chauffeur for?
The heat on my hip
The fuck I need a holster for?
Cause I got all this bread
That's why I need a toaster for
Don't know why you love the whore
Her pussy like open doors
She sit by the fire
I told her, "Here go some smores"
She seen that I like her
I give her back, "Sir, here go your daughter" (Bang)

[Chorus]
All these niggas hating on me cause
My wrist is like a freezer
Smelling like loud, I'm a reeker
All black, I'm the Grim Reaper
Whose bitch this is, she's a freaker
Whose homie is this, he's a geeker
Get yo ass off the court sit in the bleachers
I walk in and you know I tweak up the tweakers
