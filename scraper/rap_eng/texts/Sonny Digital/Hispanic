[Verse 1: Zuse]
2 door with the roof it's panoramic
Pull up on yo block these hoes like "Goddamnit"
Dope boy fresh these niggas won't understand it
Money the root of evil but nigga that is my language
Nigga don't let me panic I'm toting my automatic
I'm tooled up ain't no mechanic, anybody can have it
Who wanna play with a nigga who got that cabbage?
The flow so crack, the plug he speak spanish
Cocaine crack the brick it gon vanish
Pyrex boy I whip it on to a crackhead
Dope boy fresh but all of my niggas savage
And if you ain't know my plug is Hispanic

[Hook: Zuse]
My plug is Hispanic
My plug is Hispanic
I told you my money my language I know you can't understand it
My plug is Hispanic
My plug is Hispanic
Nigga I make it vanish you wan't it well you can have it

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
I got a Mexican plug, he from overseas, he fuck with the keys
He send 'em in 3's they front them to him, he front em to me
I get the work gone, you know how that go, my shit for the low
I stunt on the block, diss it and flip it and then I go back to the store
I trap hard even on Sundays
Bunch of young niggas bout gun play
They say I only end up one way
Like fuck it, shit, you gotta die one day
I ball so hard I can't miss
Posted on the block on the same shit
I don't go in till the work gone
So you might see me out with the same fit
But you'll never see me out with the same bitch
Red beam on the Glock so I can't miss
I just gotta cock it back and then aim this
Broke boy I don't speak yo language
And my plug fuck with me cause he know I make it vanish
And he speak Spanish my plug is Hispanic

[Hook: Zuse]

[Verse 3: Rock City]
I can be yo West Indian plug
I'm also from overseas where niggas believe
That they can just lay on the sand
Not knowing they hustling crack on the beach
That's why they losing they teeth
Them niggas is hungry looking for beef
Grew up in the streets, where everyday they be searching for something to eat
You know how niggas get when they ribs touching
Quick to go and hit the kill button
Rob a bank or they just moving dope
Even if it's just a lil something
Regular job you been working but you can't quit cause them bills coming
Few of my boys done been on the run since I was a youth and they still running
Sensimilla ain't the only thing they hustling on the corner
But when you come down to St. Thomas you good
Cause all of them man is my partner
Kadafi and Sebo yeah, that's that island boy cartel
Lil Bibby and Rock City we run shit, you can't tell?
