Verse 1
When I show up, When I show Up
All Ima do is sit chill and roll up
What's the hold up
All these threads in my message log
Might as well say I got it sewed up
And so what
Money like north on the map you can say it's only on the road up
Wearin gold up                                                  Y'all n*ggas squares wit the paper under pressure all you do is fold up
Pick your load up what ya gone
Don't talk if they got nothing on you
If you get enough bucks
And you got enough luck
Have the lawyer make the call like a phone do
All freebies when I hit it
No Charges, got acquitted
Keep Me updated wit them digits
She be on my page like a widget

Verse 2

Yeah they love me, awh man they love me
Saying that it is when they knew it really wasn't
Came upon something
Now I sit back take time read people like they came wit instructions
Blunts on a chain that i'm puffing
Got ya boy sitting at the lab with a brain full of nothing
Price make em change the discussion
Don't worry bout a dime, when them ho's came in a dozen
All them ho's saying they love me
If the rich homie need a friend then she came wit a buddy
I ain't talking bout chicks i'm talking bout bricks
My bad if i'm changing the subject 
Yep, Yep,............... Fuck how he do it
Gas,Gas,Cash,Cash i'm free to it
Lines ain't crossed till you put the fucking T to it
Don't say I unless you fucking see thru it
