[Hook]
Aye, roll it up, let's get lit (Damn, damn)
Like my backwoods exactly how I like my bitch, damn that's thick
Aye, take a puff, take a hit (damn, damn)
I don't chase 'em, but your hoe be on my dick (that's my thottie)
I got cups, I got drank (damn, damn)
Niggas stuntin' with no money in the bank, get your bands up Pullin' up, quarter tank (damn, damn)
Blowin' loud hoe and the section stank, what you think?

[Verse 1]
I don't fuck with no frauds (with no frauds), aye
Backin' right out the garage, aye
Runnin' I need a massage, aye
Workin' like I had a job, aye
Eatin' cause nigga I starve, aye
Minneapolis I'm wavey, killin' rappers on the daily
She took me back to her bedroom
Novyon gave her that leg room
That moment she gave me a head full
That she charged me up like a Red Bull
Wings, she gave me wings
I'm spittin' dope and collecting the fiends
I break it down then I roll up the tree
I got the sauce, what the fuck do you mean?

[Hook]
Aye, roll it up, let's get lit (Damn, damn)
Like my backwoods exactly how I like my bitch, damn that's thick
Aye, take a puff, take a hit (damn, damn)
I don't chase 'em, but your hoe be on my dick (that's my thottie)
I got cups, I got drank (damn, damn)
Niggas stuntin' with no money in the bank, get your bands up Pullin' up, quarter tank (damn, damn)
Blowin' loud hoe and the section stank, what you think?

[Verse 2]
I need a bitch who don't talk back
Just give me head like a ball cap
Keenan and Kell bitch I'm "All That"
Young nigga changing the format
Don't give no fuck if you hating, aye
Don't got no time for no caking, aye
I've just been drinking and kegging, aye
I just got lost in the Matrix, damn
Please don't get lost in the sauce bae
I still got work on my off day
She callin' me like a ball play
I got that heat like Picante
Woah, working my wrist
Working these tracks, then I'm working your bitch
Then she gets passed like a fucking assist
I keep that flame cause I really be lit

[Hook]
Aye, roll it up, let's get lit (Damn, damn)
Like my backwoods exactly how I like my bitch, damn that's thick
Aye, take a puff, take a hit (damn, damn)
I don't chase 'em, but your hoe be on my dick (that's my thottie)
I got cups, I got drank (damn, damn)
Niggas stuntin' with no money in the bank, get your bands up Pullin' up, quarter tank (damn, damn)
Blowin' loud hoe and the section stank, what you think?
