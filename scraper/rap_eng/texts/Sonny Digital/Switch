[Verse 1-Strap da Fool + Quez +  Ali ]
Fucked around and got drunk, going through my partna phone
Seen a text message from a bad bitch named Simone
"My nigga you fucked up too?"
Yeah, she got some good dome
What you know about this?
Nigga give me my phone
Aye boy you dumb as hell
You remember Michelle?
Remember we had her at the crib, fucked her on the stairs?
Oh yeah, she had a bad twin named Rochelle
Fucked her then delete her number, give these bitches hell
Okay, tell me what you young niggas know bout this
Got five bad bitches on my muthafuckin dick
My dick got a cell, they calling my shit

And I'm a speed demon, so I had to smash it

[Verse 2-Ali + Strap da Fool  + Jose Guapo + Quez]
I ain't give her Ciroc, cause she wanted Patron
And yeah, she gave me dome
Ali, leave her alone
Save some for a friend
One-one shot she going in
Two shots, two shots, she kissed her friend
Three shots, three shots, the party begin
She dyking with her friend
She like it on the chin
The type to fuck me and my niggas when we in the Benz
Oh yeah, tell em bout the time we hit her in the Hummer
We had the AC blowing on a hot summer's
She wanna fuck for a buck
Suck for a follow back
Drop my kids off at a swimming pool and told that ho to swallow that
Guap, where the hell you come from?
I was in the back
Switching up with Fee-Lo
Bust a nut, and then I pass her back
