[Chorus: Que]
I smoke gas and I take meds
I sip purp and I drink red
If you ain’t my nigga I don’t shake hands
And ‘round here, we make bitches break bread
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on

[Verse 1: Que]
I’m the type of nigga that’ll break a bitch
Ballin’ on that 2002 Lakers shit
Six gold rings, feel like I’m Michael Jordan
Took your bitch and upgraded her for Michael Kors
We set all the trends, the other niggas follow
And for that paper I’ll knock the beef straight out your taco
Head honcho, I’m plugged with Pablo
Four-five Glock stole, it’s loaded with hollow, oh
Only rock gold, my niggas will not fold, no
Top floor at the W, we mob ho, oh
Knock the pussy out, two piece and a combo, oh
Red dot woah, turn niggas to John Doe

[Chorus: Que]
I smoke gas and I take meds
I sip purp and I drink red
If you ain’t my nigga I don’t shake hands
And ‘round here, we make bitches break bread
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on

[Verse 2: Que]
I’m a dog nigga and my niggas is too
Styrofoam cup filled up with pimp juice
They want to ride the wave but they don’t know how to surf
I don’t want to hit you blunt, you can keep that dirt
Took a vacation just to clear my mind
I know your jewelry fake, I can tell how it shine
Ooh, I smoke gas and I pop strips
Money pussy drugs, them my three addictions
I’m with the same niggas, never switching up my mixes
Getting top inside my office like I’m Bill Clinton
How the hell he do that
Selling dick to all these bitches, only known for New Jack

[Chorus: Que]
I smoke gas and I take meds
I sip purp and I drink red
If you ain’t my nigga I don’t shake hands
And ‘round here, we make bitches break bread
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on

[Verse 3: Que]
You ain’t got my payola, it’s game over
If she ain’t tryna fuck, do not bring her over
Now it’s time, overtime to wake him up
And nine times out of ten the dog why y’all breaking up
Hopping out that Tesla
Rolex with the big bald head like Uncle Fester
Top chopped dog
I’m with you big and top dog
She suck me so long she caught lockjaw
Hopping out the Tahoe, got the woadie with me
Got a point to prove that I can fuck these boujie bitches
Mixing up the xannys with the adderall
I’m a dog, I got bitches in my catalog

[Chorus: Que]
I smoke gas and I take meds
I sip purp and I drink red
If you ain’t my nigga I don’t shake hands
And ‘round here, we make bitches break bread
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
That the type of shit that we be on
