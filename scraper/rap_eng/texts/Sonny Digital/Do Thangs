[Hook]
Fucking with some thangs, fucking with some thangs
Fucking with some thangs, fucking with some thangs
We could do thangs, we could do thangs
We could do thangs, we could do thangs
Fucking with some thangs, fucking with some thangs
Fucking with some thangs, fucking with some thangs
We could do thangs, we could do thangs
We could do thangs, we could do thangs

[Verse]
We could do thangs in the back of the Range
Or you could give me head while I drive (skur), let's chill, alright
You wanna get me up to your place, but I rather go to my place
You can't trust hoes these day, oh no, no way!
I be sippin' Act again, shouts out
Shouts my nigga SB, now we back again
Alright baby Nate3D now we back again
TGOD i still got the same friends
Pack in that Go with my main bitch

[Bridge]
I'ma pop a Molly, pop a Percocet, sippin' Actavis
My momma mad at me, told me I spend too much money
I've been buyin' bottles like sure, you only live once
My ex girl right now cause her home girl told her I was up in the club

[Hook]
Fucking with some thangs, fucking with some thangs
Fucking with some thangs, fucking with some thangs
We could do thangs, we could do thangs
We could do thangs, we could do thangs
Fucking with some thangs, fucking with some thangs
Fucking with some thangs, fucking with some thangs
We could do thangs, we could do thangs
We could do thangs, we could do thangs
