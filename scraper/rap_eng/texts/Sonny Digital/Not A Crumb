[Intro]
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sorry for the Wraith I pulled up laced
Dressed really fresh I don't do release dates
If I want it right now nigga I don’t wait
Money to the sky, hoe I don't play
And I couldn't see it going any other way, let us pray
That we continue touchin' money put enough away
Flippin' through the menu so much shit in my driveway
Ballin' like I sold out, I sold out but I did it my way
Broke it down like a brick, what I did for sure
Split it up amongst the fam now we all spending dough
Bitch I'm the score, served and spent a stack on the gold roll
Fuck a solid gold kilo

[Hook]
Celebrate every night the money come
You see we party every night we always hustlin'
My nigga you were sleepin' when we turn the oven on
So when we cut the cake don't you be expectin' nothin' not a crumb

[Verse 2]
Pink diamonds in the Rolex
Rosé Champagne all my hunnits blue
They ask a nigga if I gang bang I maneuver coupes in the fast lane
Roll through what I run through and then you be the man
Stayin' in the house ruth in the ceiling fan
I had it all Mac calls, Mac calls
Process of the come up, had a few drawbacks
Small thing to a giant
My whole crew shinin' we ain't even gotta tell you where we show you 'bout it
Little boy we making bumper cars out them Maseratis
My new machine making 'em nervous
They don't know what to do around me
Them bitches flirtin', them niggas watchin'

[Hook]
Celebrate every night the money come
You see we party every night we always hustlin'
And nigga you were sleepin' when we turn the oven on
So when we cut the cake don't you be expectin' nothin' not a crumb
