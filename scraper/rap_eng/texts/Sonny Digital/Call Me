[Intro]
Sonny roll grams of wax

[Verse 1]
I know, I know, I know
Call me up when no ones round, aye
Im down, to give you what you need

If your out pick me up, If your out pick me up
Oouu, Oouu
Oouu, Oouu
If your out pick me up, If your out pick me up

[Chorus]
Call me on my telephone
Call me on my telephone
(Call me up, call me up)
Call me on my telephone
Call me on my telephone
(Call me up, call me up)
Call me on my telephone
Call me on my telephone
(Call me up, call me up)
Call me on my telephone
Call me on my telephone
(Call me up, call me up)

Hate to have to see you walk away
But baby can we be nice
I know this is for the moment
Me and you just one night
I know me and you just me and you
But baby that's alright
I know me and you just me and you
But baby that's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
If your out pick me up, If your out pick me up
Oouu, Oouu
Oouu, Oouu
If your out pick me up, If your out pick me up

[Chorus]
Call me on my telephone
Call me on my telephone
(Call me up, call me up)
Call me on my telephone
Call me on my telephone
(Call me up, call me up)
Call me on my telephone
Call me on my telephone
(Call me up, call me up)
Call me on my telephone
Call me on my telephone
(Call me up, call me up)

[Outro]
Call me on my telephone
(Call me, call me, call me)
Call me on my telephone
(Call me, call me, call me)
(Call me up, call me up)
Call me on my telephone
(Call me, call me, call me)
Call me on my telephone
(Call me, call me, call me)
(Call me up, call me up)
