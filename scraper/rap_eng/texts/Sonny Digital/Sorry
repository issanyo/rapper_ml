[Intro: PnB Rock]
I ain't never sorry

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I woke up today (yah)
Feelin' good, I'm ballin'
I just copped a drop
Could've copped a 'Rari
Feels like yesterday (yah)
Nigga I was starvin'
I just fucked yo' bitch (Sheesh)
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry (nah)
I just copped a drop (Scurr)
Could've copped a 'Rari
I just fucked yo' bitch
And I ain't never sorry

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I woke up today, feeling super saucy
Took yo' bitch last [?]
Said she wanna party
I used to be broke but, nigga that's another story
Now, I'm gettin' money
You can't tell me nothin'
All of my niggas is stuntin'
I might take a trip out the country
Damn it feels good to be paid
I just might move to L.A

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I woke up today
Feelin' good, I'm ballin'
I just copped a drop
Could've copped a 'Rari
Feels like yesterday
Nigga I was starvin'
I just fucked yo' bitch
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I just copped a drop
Could've copped a 'Rari
I just fucked yo' bitch
And I ain't never sorry

[Verse 2: Sonny Digital]
Look at me I'm winnin', got my chains up
Salute to real niggas, never changed up
Remember when them bitches tried to play us
Now the money going out, them bitches praise us
Yeah, I'm on it, yeah, I want it
Dat my swag, why you clonin'?
Never winnin', bitch we on it
Why you dreaming, wake up good morning

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I woke up today
Feelin' good, I'm ballin'
I just copped a drop
Could've copped a 'Rari
Feels like yesterday
Nigga I was starvin'
I just fucked yo' bitch
(5x)I ain't never sorry
I just copped a drop
Could've copped a 'Rari
I just fucked yo' bitch
And I ain't never sorry

[Verse 3: Trill Sammy]
Yeah, I woke up today
Today was a good day
I got icescrews on my chain
I got money and the fame
My car ain't got no top
You ain't countin' guap
Bring her to my spot, make the lil' bitch give me top
'Member I ain't had no money, wore the same clothes
Now, I pull up in yo' city in a Range Rove
Yeah, youngest in the game, I've been ballin'
Yeah, I just fucked yo' bitch, why she keep callin'?
Gang!

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I woke up today
Feelin' good, I'm ballin'
I just copped a drop
Could've copped a 'Rari
Feels like yesterday
Nigga I was starvin'
I just fucked yo' bitch
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I ain't never sorry
I just copped a drop
Could've copped a 'Rari
I just fucked yo' bitch
And I ain't never sorry
