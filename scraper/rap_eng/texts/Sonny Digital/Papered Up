Focused on the money, nigga, nothin' else
I got my team with me, we don't want no help
Talkin' that shit is gon be something else
Cuz I'm focused on the money, nigga, nothin' else
Papered up: got racks, homie; papered up: got racks, homie
Papered up, got racks, homie, papered up, got racks, homie
Papered up: got racks, homie; papered up: got racks, homie
Papered up: got racks, homie; papered up: got racks, homie

[Verse 1]
Have you ever seen an out-of-towner walkin' up in yo hood?
Hoppin' off of that plane, got that weed burnin' that good?
Bad bitch in my backseat, bad bitch in my passenger
.40 Glock in that Louis purse, talk that shit, it's a massacre
Presidential that Rolie (don't stuff crust my blonde)
Big racks all in my pocket, big smoke all in my lung
Get 5K for a show, I hit the club and I throw that
Cuz I know when I wake up I'mma go get mo racks
Chrome rims with my long chick on a long trip and I'm gon hit
You need a favor you hit me up and then cut the check, and I'm on it
C.O. of my own shit, general for that wave game
Y'all niggas so dickless and I always bring my A-game

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now y'all focused up on this money, and I ain't worried 'bout nothin' else
I done count so much bread nigga, I can count to million by my fuckin' self
Fuckin' money machine, nigga, I'm in love with these paper cuts
I'm a real (?) extraordinaire, nigga, I need my fuckin' paper cut
Hatin' niggas get your money up, fake niggas can't fuck with us
This (?) is in my double cup, my goon niggas stay huddled up
I'm papered up and got racks, homie, UPS my packs, homie
Overnight they touch down, just (?), homie
If you don't, that's your choice
I bet your ass get cracked, homie
With that .40 I ain't even playin': like "click-clack" I'll blast, homie
Hold up
Wave, wave game got rack
If EPA got rack, fuck it, (fifth?) stacks at Saks
