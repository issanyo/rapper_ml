[Verse 1]
All I got is money and some time
And I can't waste a dime
I ain't like these rappers I will put your ass in line
Bitch I'm like the reaper you can't cross me without dying
Got to grip the eighth so you can catch me on the nine
You taking shots without the pistol I got real clips
I got 4 K's on me just to make it real clear
I gotta make these niggas focused like I'm Will Smith
Cause I think they need a push like a wheelchair
I made it half way through the order and it's time to make another one
Drop the work up in the water it's time to make another one
I ain't really feeling this bitch I need another one
Hop out the whip I'm about to hop up in another one
Change clothes like I change hoes I ain't change you
Niggas get a lil bankroll when they change up
Came up switched the name up fucked the game up
Same one from the Money Block whipping cane up
Now these niggas wanna fuck with me cause I'm famous
You may not wanna hang with me that shit's dangerous
This that Money Block shit, this that new Chicago
This that shit you wanna hear when you be popping bottles
This that wrap the work up tight and put in the Tahoe
If it ain't straight to the money why the fuck would I go
I'm just saying though
I got bands though and grams hoe
Ten though that's a no no on my land hoe
We're on 16 bars that's a lot to handle
Keep the fan on me but I'd rather let my mans go

[Hook]
Blaow Blaow Blaow
Can you hear me now
Blaow Blaow Blaow
Can you hear me now
Blaow Blaow Blaow
Can you hear me now
Blaow Blaow Blaow
Can you hear me now
Code red we got a man down
Fuck around and caught him with his hands down
Code red we got a man down
Fuck around and caught him with his pants down
Code red we got a man down
Caught him with a chopper had to lay him down
Code red we got a man down
Left him at the light with his head down

[Verse 2]
I ain't really looking for no friends these days
All I'm really looking for is M's these days
Money Block on other niggas and D. Wade
Tryna fill my safe up I don't want no empty space
50 rolling swishers I be rolling Backwoods
I don't think I'm killing these niggas as much as I should
Put my city on my back I'm putting on for my hood
I was taught it ain't no lacking when you up to no good
Cause I was hanging out the window
I was letting him ride sideways
Nigga tried to run but I caught him in the driveway
Asked him for that money and he looking at me sideways
Don't you know us niggas getting killed for that shit nowadays
Hopping in the trap same clothes for like five days
I'm just trying to make a hundred thou' by friday
