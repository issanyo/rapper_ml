They say the party crackin', I'm like "Who there"? (Who there?)
Which Louie should I wear, I got a few pairs (I don't know!)
That strong in my lungs, call it new air (Loud)
M.U.B.U in this bitch, yeah the crew here (What?)

Bitches, I need 2 pair!
Porches, I need 2 pair!
Of course, I need 2 pair!
Chains, I need 2 pair!
Bottles, I need 2 pair!
Models, I need 2 pair!
Blunts, I need 2 pair!
Extendo call that 2 pair!

[Verse 1]
Ridin round, gettin it', gettin' money like there's two of me
Two bad bitches, and they talkin' 'bout doin' me
Get them to the crib, and they don't know what to do with me
I tell 'em, suck me at the same time, like there's two of me!
Too legit to quit, they can't touch me on my hammer shit
Too many choices, hella Porsches don't know which to pick (Skrrrt!)
Too much money, had to ask God, is it a trick?
Do it for my homies, and we split it like we prick the shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back to the money, doin' numbers, call me phone book
Hella bands of loud, we gettin' money, smokin' strong kush
Racks on top of racks, times 2, I'm gettin too paid
All about my business, really don't have time to play
Gettin' money's foreplay, all I do is blow cake
Like everything's my birthday, racks comin' fast way
Seen in a sports car, feelin' like a drag race (skrrt!)
Thumbing through a check, baby you can go and act chase
