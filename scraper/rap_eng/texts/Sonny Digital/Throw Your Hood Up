[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Neighborhood Nip I came in on this shit
Most of my homies in the pen' for this shit
Westside N's, ain't friends in this shit
Bust at you niggas that pretend with the shit
A lot of niggas tryna blend with the crips
Make him break bread, kick in for the shit
Run him off cuz he been was a bitch
It's a big ass hood but it's a small ass clique
(Look), full of real niggas and we hate fakes
Round table, politicking on the late late
Can't run a nigga credit then he ain't straight
Gang of volunteer killers and they can't wait
I'm from where they cut holes in the gate
Take him to the back, and expose if he's fake
Point Blank, shoot a hole in his face
No weapon, no witness, that's the whole in this case
Look, county jail front line with a shank
S Gang, neighborhood in they face
Homies left got detained to the state
But I kept it that way in a whole different tank
Roll it up, you a whole different game
Rap money, that's a whole different bank
Niggas done so much dirt in LA
Got these niggas banging this in a whole different state
(Look, Look)
