[Verse 1]
I still can't believe it girl, from last night
You said that you gon' leave me and that's not right
Like I've been doin' soo much, girl, in my life
Tryna be with you babe and make it right
You been actin' soo strange and kinda wild
I ain't even seen you lately, in a while
I think that you been trippin' babe, you should stop
You should just take it back from the start

[Hook 1]
So I'm gon' leave it there if that's fine
I'm gon' leave it there if that's fine
Girl, I'm gon' leave it there if that's fine
Cause we could start again one more time
But why'd you leave it there? That's not fine
Girl, why'd you leave that there?, That's not fine
So I'mma leave it there, cause that's fine
And we gon' start again one more time

[Bridge]
You say I be trippin' babe and that's a lie
Cause I've been really doin' things for us tonight
You think I be trippin' babe, but ain't no lie
You know how I feel 'bout us every time

[Verse 2]
I should've stayed, but I don't really want to you
Should've stayed, but you don't really want to babe
I know that you just really want someone else, uh

[Hook 2]
Why'd you leave it there if that's fine?
I'm not gon' leave it there, not tonight
So tell me, why'd you leave it there if that's fine ?
I think we can start again one more time
So I'mma leave it there if that's fine
Baby, I'mma leave it there if that's fine
So I'mma leave it there if that's fine
Cause we can start again one more time

[Hook 1]
So I'm gon' leave it there if that's fine
I'm gon' leave it there if that's fine
Girl, I'm gon' leave it there if that's fine
Cause we could start again one more time
But why'd you leave it there? That's not fine
Girl, why'd you leave that there?, That's not fine
So I'mma leave it there, cause that's fine
And we gon' start again one more time
