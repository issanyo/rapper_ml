[Intro: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump!
Up... word!
Huh, up, up
Sonny Digital
Up, now you done fucked up
Ear Drummers

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Read my lips, I do my own stunts
Bitch wanna go on a date, pull up to SunTrust
Wear my hat to the front, like I drive a truck
Like I drive a truck, all white Bentley truck
ATM go nuts, I do what I want
I say what I want, I grew up on Pac
Kush smell just like musk, turn it into dust
Man, my style is tough, y'all huffed all that puff
Twerk like she from Russia, try hard not to love her
But she so damn bad, I might have to cuff her
Rock like Billy Ray, that's a nigga idol
Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes, read it like the Bible

[Chorus Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Up like Trump, all of the sudden
Solo cup when brought to the public
Balmain's clean as a whistle, green ain't the issue
Lil bit of money make a difference, nothin' is somethin'
It's so hard to function with all of these hoes in the house
Fuck y'all assumption, my blood still rushin', my heart still thumpin'
Up like Trump, geekin' like "I.T."
Got a bitch twerkin' on Skype
MGM every night, Sremm after dark, king of the swipe
Motherfuckers worry 'bout likes on they pictures
They ain't got an "Iguadala," or a nickel
They ain't even got a penny, for the strippers
And they wanna pop bottles, like winners
Check my pedigree I always been a money fiend
All these fuckin' rings, I'm shinin', like a fuckin' king
Breakin' down the kush, don't it look so plush?
Take a couple puffs, up like Donald Trump!

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up
