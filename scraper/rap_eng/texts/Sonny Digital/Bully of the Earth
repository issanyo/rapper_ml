I thought you were the bully of the earth
But you were just a man
Just a man
I thought you were the bully of the earth
But you were just a man
Been awhile minute poppa
I switched styles on ya poppa
Your boy got a new barber
Your daughter gotta new daughter
And bought a ride for your mama
I moved the tribe out to Georgia
I lost Bambi and Adaora
Cuz I want a little bit-a more-a
I memba in '08
When you cried for Obama
If you were here to-day
You would cry for tomorrow
We won't hail to the new king
As the politicians mood swings
Everybody showin' true colors
Like a motherfuckin mood ring
And the school ain't reachin them
And the teachers wonder why
Silly bird you don't know how to swim?
Silly fish you don't know how to fly?
Ain't no wonder niggas thinkin we stupid
Urban legend is you’ll never be students
Ye’ ain't worthy to get shot by Cupid
But get shot by a cop that’s ruthless
I joke with the wicked men who wanna see us all in Attica
Start a hunned million kick starters and go on kick us back to Africa
I'll be waitin there with Akon
I'll be out of Dodge no challenger
This a new day nigga why you only thinkin you can run to Canada
Too many rebels just follow convention
I thought it was all about breakin’ tradition
I never believed it's all money and bitches
Or that the best human beings are the richest
Fuckin ridiculous

[laughing]
You fooled em chief, you fooled em all
You see
I thought you were the bully of the earth
But then you were just a man
I thought you were the bully of the earth
But then you were just a man
But then you were just a man

[string instrumental]

You’re not a man til’ the day your father dies
You’re not a woman til’ you make your momma cry
You’re not a man til’ the day your father dies
You’re not a woman til’ you make your momma cry (oh me oh my)
It ain't the end of the world
Just the end of the day
It ain't the end of the world
Just the end of the day (oww!)
