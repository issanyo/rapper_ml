Watch me do that bird walk
Bird talk

[Verse 1]
Okay, everybody listen
I done ran the track, I done been to prison
Trappin' all star, first place the ribbon
Gucci for my children, how the fuck I'm living
Here we go, I'm ducking the fence and I'm dodging the system
I swear that the trap I be jumping ignition
I give it and go, I be balling like Pippen
My bitch is a doctor but look like she strippin'
She got some friends that say they wanna ball
I dunk on every fuckin' one of y'all
Every fuckin' one of y'all
I dunk on every fuckin' one of y'all

[Verse 2]
[?] money dance, I do my bird walk
It's triple OG, I seen them birds flock
Free Young Choppa, free Young Guwop
Hey we been trappin' since the school house
Roll around with packs and roll around with shooters
Strap up with them Uzi's, bullets, tommies, rugers
Bricks that look like [?], pass it smell like maneur
Yo bitch, that's my old bitch, I already flew her
It's funny how the money change
It's money over everything
I gave the game a fucking wedding ring
I said it's money over everything
