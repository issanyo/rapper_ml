[Intro:]
O-U-Y, yea, talking to you
Umhm
28 Grams

[Hook:]
I ain't tryna hear about all them other niggas
I just woke, I just wanna come over and have
Ugh, heard he ain't a real nigga
Call me I'mma come feel you up
Like a real nigga

Cause when lights go out, we're all alone
I don't see no one
Ride slow
I won't let nobody know
Ohh, who you are
Be who you are
Be who you are

I want you, you
I want you
As bad as you are
Why would you wanna fuck with a nigga like me girl?
Why would you wanna roll weed for a nigga like me girl?
Why would you wanna throw the ass for a nigga like me girl?
Grind on her when you throw that ass for a nigga like me?

You, you, you, you, know what you want
You remember where you came from
Oh yea, you know the business
I swear that pussy is the business
Might give your ass the business
You, you, ugh

[Verse 1:]
We going away
She riding for the kid
Riding for the squad
Riding on this dick
Gone with the wind
Gone with the whip
Gone on the liquor
She going to my crib
Phone blowing up
Kush coned up
Sheets all wet
Hair messed up
Tied around my neck
Face on deck
Just let a nigga know what it is
Still want you (x3)




You! for real

[Outro:]
Yea, bitch
28 Grams
We in the trap all day
I'm trappin' like motherfuckin' uh
Young Jeezy, you know, Snowman days
That's me right now, whippin'
