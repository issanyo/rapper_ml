[Hook: iLoveMakonnen] (x2)
Damn, we going straight to the tip-top
This fast, why should I stop
I need all of my money, we need it now
So run it

[Verse 1: iLoveMakonnen]
We play games like Jumanji
I got bitches in the hood bungee jumping
Off of bridges, I'ma be in San Francisco
Told em they ain't need to grease my parm like crisco
They gon' hit me off with at least about 15 bands
I'ma hit the stage and see my favorite jams
Like, I don't sell no fucking molly
At the same time I'm the man of the party
God damn, we done had to switch up
I used to have that lean in a blue cup
Now I had to go and get smarter
ILoveMakonnen, it's the drink more water

[Hook: iLoveMakonnen] (x2)

[Verse 2: Key!]
I need mine now ain't no time to waste
I got good lawyers, I just beat the case
Tell her come over, let me beat her face
Niggas jocking styles, man I need a fav
Thumbin' through cash while I'm waiting on more
I hate to father more, man these hoes ain't import'
Thumbin' throwin' cash while they fiending and plotting
Thinking to myself who the hell gon' stop

[Hook: iLoveMakonnen] (x2)

[Verse 3: iLoveMakonnen]
Same time turning young boys into scholars
Teach 'em how to whip it, how to flip it for the dollars
Or if they want Ferrari, or maybe fucking jets and
I fly em out and town and they be feeling like the Jetsons
Now you selling dishes, young get it all in the kitchen
What's the mission, what you wishing, girl what you needing?
I'm out here riding, out here, out here fuckin' fiending
