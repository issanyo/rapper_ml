[Intro]
Sonny Digital in here
My boy Brian Dorsey in here
We only playin' the hottest shit forever
Haha, get it?

[Hook]
Police pulled me over, they thought I was drag racin' niggas
I ain't got no patience nigga
Pull up and we serve you like a waitress nigga
What the fuck you want I'm out of favors nigga
What you think it is when you see ravens nigga
It's death, pull up to the parkin' lot
Yeah we flamin' niggas
Told the plug meet me on cool winter nigga
I got all these hundreds but I swear they cannot change a nigga

[Verse]
That's danger nigga
Name my d-line Topanga nigga
See these swirls in my banger nigga
It's one up in the hit and it'll change a nigga
Nina a thot, she brainin' nigga
Four-five Glock, bang a nigga
AK with knife, tango niggas
Fuck her in the mouth, we hang a nigga

[Hook]
Police pulled me over, they thought I was drag racin' niggas

Yeah we flamin' niggas
Told the plug meet me on cool winter nigga
