[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
She shake her ass for it nigga I don't blame her
She a stallion I'mma tame her
Freak that pussy make her put my name on it
Weather man how I make it rain on her
Bartender bring me more bundles
I'm about to have these hoes jumping
I'm about to get these hoes naked
Get your money baby I don't blame you
Jimmy rolling right out the bath
Nah nigga I don't want to match
Go ahead and check a nigga tags
All this sauce I'm killing swag
I'm the type of nigga spending fast
But you know you got to show your ass
Do a trick make a nigga spazz
Tell me can I get a private dance

You a stripper I don't give a fuck
I don't show no basic bitches love
All my bitches tens and above

[Verse 2: Riff 3x]
Popping, shaking, make it roller blade
Power up like I'm Powerade
She in love with the big face
OG got a good taste
You and your friend can get it
I'm the man when I step in your city
Getting brain from boogie bitches
And whatever else comes with it
Living my life 'til the ending
How can you blame a nigga that's winning
Different designer all over my body
She want to rub all over my body
I told that bitch come straight to the crib
I want to put it all in her rib
Call up your friend I want a menage
Bands on deck I don't have to flaunt
I like these bitches that's down to ride
Don't give a fuck they'll do the whole squad
