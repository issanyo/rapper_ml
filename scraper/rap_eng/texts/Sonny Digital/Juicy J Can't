[Intro: Juicy J]
I get so damn trippy in my mind I go blank
The top 10 get-high rappers, number 1 is my rank

[Hook: Juicy J]
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't

[Refrain: Juicy J]
I get so damn trippy in my mind I go blank
The top 10 get-high rappers, number 1 is my rank

[Hook: Juicy J]
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
Juicy J, Juicy J, Juicy J, Juicy J
Juicy, Juicy, Juicy, Juicy, Juicy J can't

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Lean overflowing like New Orleans' broken levees
No relationship with hoes, I just want that Becky
I'm bout my money, I gets my fetti
Street nigga, north Memphis, bitch I still rep it
Smokin' weed from the bong
And the lean got me sprung
Molly in my veins got my heart beatin' like a drum
Grinding on my teeth like a nigga chewing gum
Eyes Chinese tight, but I don't work at Yums
Juicy so high I feel like that I'm on a cloud
Weed don't talk, but the shit I got here loud
After the show we grab the groupie hoes, I'm smokin' out
No smoke for free, no IOU's, no I don't do no vowels

[Hook: Juicy J]
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
Juicy J, Juicy J, Juicy J, Juicy J
Juicy, Juicy, Juicy, Juicy, Juicy J can't

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
The club doped out, we dove in
Shawty got that ass poked out, but I'm pokin'
I get that cap and gown, like I'm graduatin'
Shawty straight on the bed, she ain't hesitatin'
I'm on that loud, you on that hush
Nigga, I'm the shit, can't be flushed
I'm gettin' money, ballin', without a contract
I ain't gotta smoke for you to catch a contact
I shoot guns, I don't blow guns
Smoke so much I should've had four lungs
I'm smokin', 'til my money gone
And that's no time soon, 'cause my money long

[Hook: Juicy J]
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
You say, you say no to drugs, Juicy, Juicy J can't
Juicy J, Juicy J, Juicy J, Juicy J
Juicy, Juicy, Juicy, Juicy, Juicy J can't
