[Intro]
You better get familiar with the sound, baby
This what happen when you win an Oscar
They make 'em sing for you
Juicy J, DJ Blak
It's the conexion, baby
O's to Oscars, who woulda ever thought we'd win

[Verse 1 Juicy J]
I'm still working while I'm on vacation
You can't tell me nothin' by my dedication
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my medication
Feet up in my whip cause it's very......

[Bridge]
Hey, hold up, hold up
I told you with no mistake
Ain't no missunderstanding
Juicy J, DJ Blak
Yeah, we here, baby
O's to Oscars
Who the fuck would ever thought we would win a Oscar in here?

[Verse 2]
I'm still working while I'm on vacation
You can't tell me nothing by my dedication
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my medication
Feet up in my whip cause it's very spacious

All these niggas nervous, what the fuck is pressure?
You not on this level cause you lack the effort
You thought you seen the drought, you 'bout to see a desert
Getting to this money is my guilty pleasure
I should take a break and let 'em get a chance
Fuck that shit, I'm turnt up in this bitch again (YEAH HO!)
Bitch I ain't your daddy, I can't hold your hand  (YEAH HO!)
One thing that's for sure is bands gon' make her dance
Play this at your party, play this on your block
Yeah play this at your office, play this in your shop
Play this when you and the homies load the Glocks
Play that shit again when my album drops
My business gets personal
Forgive me for birthing you
I heard a couple lines that you stole from a verse or 2
My flow is too versatile
My punchlines get surgical
'Foe I even heard of you, I already murdered you
Hard work pays off, so bitch you know what to do
Lock myself down in the trap for 'bout a mon or 2
I got work, so you know that client√®les is coming through
We got grams, we got grammy's, we got O's and Oscar's too

She wanna hop in the Range, I wanna hop in the Wraith
She want it  all in her pants, I want it all in her face
All I be wanted is bands, all I be wanted is bas
I don't wanna be no friends, please get the fuck out my face
She fell in love in a day, I fell in love with the yay
I fell in love with the cake, ain't gotta tell me to spray
Had to make sure we was straight
I was the reason we ate, I put the food on your plate
You should just let me be great
Half a melon or a grape, all these niggas full of hate
I'm so high, I need a cape
I'm so high, I'm in outer space
My safe is runnin' out of space cause I be spreading to the cake
Like I'm tryna win a race, your bitch is all up in my face
Tell her she got good taste, cause all I know is first place
Who is the one that was telling you niggas 'bout cooking and whipping the yay? (HEY!)
All of these bitches be on me when I'm in the Bentley, what more can I say?(HEY!)
Bitch I been kicking this paper since pimpin' did pimpin' way back in the day
Real niggas gettin' this money so fuck you little bloggers and fuck what you say
