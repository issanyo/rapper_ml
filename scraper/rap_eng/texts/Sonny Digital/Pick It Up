[Intro x8]
Make it rain

[Verse 1]
Bands all in my pocket, diamond watch on my wrist froze
Niggas doin' that hot shit and I'm gettin' paid cuz my shit cold
I got ten bands in my pocket, ten bottles at my table
Ten models in my section, I kill y'all niggas like Cain did Abel
I stuff crust with my blunt, three grams in one swish
I travel the world in one trip while you laid up with one bitch
You work hard for that paycheck and I throw that shit in one night
We playin' jokes in first class, got ten homies on one flight
Niggas ran in my room, seen that .45 like "Oh, shit!"
"My nigga on one! He on one!"
I been on one since '06
Club Live? I did that
King of Diamonds? I did that
Magic City? I did that
Your main bitch? I hit that

[Hook]
I see it in your eyes, you tryna get some money
And I'mma make it rain, rain until it's money
Pocket full of bands, got lean in my cup
I got so much money need a team to pick it up
Make it rain, make it rain, make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain, make it rain, make it rain
Pocket full of bands, got lean in my cup
I got so much money need a team to pick it up

[Verse 2]
Hoppin' offa that jet, I get the weed: roll up
Actavis in my dirty Sprite, I'm double cuppin': pour up
My team the shit and we know it, got .45's reloaded
Got old bread that's moldy, told my pockets I can't fold it
I throw one band, two bands, three bands and four
I come in the club with ten racks walkin' up in that door
Lean got me on slow mo, niggas packin' that .44
Lil' homie got dude to do "click-clack" for some promo
(inhales) Smoke break, smokin' that pound 'til my throat ache
John Doe your main ho, yeah turn that bitch into cold case
One band, two bands, three bands and four
I came in the club with ten racks, now it's on the floor

[Hook]
