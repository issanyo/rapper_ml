[Verse 1]
I wish my ex the best but i am the best
Who you gonna find better than the kid

You trynna' keep me home like im on house arrest
I'm on the road you know what it is

You trynna' flip the script point the fingers at me
I'm telling you the truth and you say it can't be

I wanna leave out but you always grab me
How tf im sposed to live like this

I tried to change my ways and the past at last
I did all of this shit for you

I tell some jokes and you laugh good times but you got trust issues
And I'm never the one to tell a lie to you shawdy' I love you but I don't miss you

When I pulled up I can feel the pain in your lips every time i went to kiss you

[Hook]
And that's the reason why we don't talk anymore, anymore
You the reason why we don't talk anymore, anymore
Because of you we don't talk no more
When they ask I say no we don't talk no more, no more

Female Speaking: "Nope and that's why I don't fuck with him for real"

Lacoste Speaking: "Yeah for real for real"

Female Speaking: "Riding through the city and I got you on my mind you know you know"
