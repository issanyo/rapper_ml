[Intro]
Aww yeah
Pardon My Take
Taking over for the 99 and also the 2000
(Sonny Digital)

[Hook]
Drink paint, that's grit
Drink paint, gettin' lit
Drink paint, that's my shit
Drink paint, that's grit

[Verse 1: PFT]
Sipping on some glossy white
Wash it down, stomach's tight
Hand me a straw, head feeling light
Chugging primer like it's Sprite
I eat pieces of grit like you for breakfast
I'm on your head, weigh you down like I'm a necklace
Give you CTE then you forget this
Driving RV3, driving wreckless

[Hook]
Drink paint, that's grit
Drink paint, gettin' lit
Drink paint, that's my shit
Drink paint, that's grit

[Verse 2: Big Cat]
Big Cat with the juicy taint
I'm going hard in the motherfucking paint
I'm a dirty boy, ain't no saint
Huff the fumes until I faint
Got a pine finish when I stain my deck
Watch it drip right down my neck
Paint, look got paint  in my mustache
Paint all in my butt crack
Paint all in my nut sack

[Hook]
Drink paint, that's grit
Drink paint, gettin' lit
Drink paint, that's my shit
Drink paint, that's grit

[Bridge]
Coach O down in the bayou
Coach O hold that tiger
Coach O down in the bayou
Coach O hold that tiger

[Outro]
That tiger Jeff Van Gundy. Let me tell you a little something about that tiger. That tiger seen it all. That tiger's been through it all. And you know how it persevered, Jeff Van Gundy? Grit. The nittiest of the gritty was that tiger. He never gave up. He had the eye of the what? The tiger, Jeff Van Gundy. Celtics by five
