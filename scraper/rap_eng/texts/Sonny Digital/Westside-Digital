You scandalous ass nigga, ayy
Alright this it

[Verse 1: G Perico]
Ain't nothin' but the dope shit goin' on bitch
You won't get far just hangin' on my dick
Let me run your credit
I need a Harley for this hot weather
My curl blowin' in the wind when I push the pedal
Gang slide in with all gang violence
My homie down in MCJ he violated, shit
Put some money on his books, hit the hood
To get like me, these old niggas wish they could
Nigga stop it, I'm out makin' profits
Niggas better watch they tone when the Glock spits
I'm bout to be a free man
No parole, cleared child support
Get my L's then I'm gone
Hit another city, all blue, lookin' Crippy
Hundred million dollar mission
I took 20 thousand, threw it around a couple times
And I ya ya ya ya ya ya

[Verse 2: Sonny Digital]
Bet I could make the money blow
Chyea, I just made a hundred blow
Chyea, 50 on a nigga wrist
Ayy, know I took some major risks
Chyea, yeah, ain't got no time for a bitch
Chyea, won't spend a dime on a bitch
Fall back, recline on a bitch
Chyea, like a barber, get in line bitch

[Verse 3: G Perico]
Won't spend a dime, plus I'm thin on time
In order to make it happen gotta kick it from mine
My daughter need shoes and a private school
Once I hit it rich I'm passin' everything down to her
That's a gangster for real na mean?
Top of my game if i get killed na mean?
In my hood ain't no tellin'
Niggas say that they love you
Truth be told them niggas be jealous
So I'm like, "Fuck ya'll, all ya'll"
When I was in jail a nigga didn't call ya'll
If it ain't Senile, or Lil Win, or the rest of my niggas
Then you know what it is
I'ma holler out
"Bye bitch, bye bitch, don't care if you cry  bitch, or die bitch"
I'ma take all my problems and put 'em all in a blunt
Roll that shit tight and light that bitch up

[Verse 4: Sonny Digital]
Westside Will smokin' stunner blunts
Only niggas really gettin' it, bitch you know it's us
Hundred racks on me bitch you know what's up
Ayy I been layin' low but the money up
I could make the money blow
Chyea, I just made a hundred blow
Chyea, 50 on a nigga wrist
Ayy, know I took some major risks
Chyea, yeah, ain't got no time for a bitch
Chyea, won't spend a dime on a bitch
Fall back, recline on a bitch
Chyea, like a barber, get in line bitch
Chyea
