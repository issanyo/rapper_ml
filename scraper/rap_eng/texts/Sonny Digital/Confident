[Hook:]
I think I'm just too confident,  confident
Too much five-o im out for the shit, godzilla shit
Dont get confused and get left in a ditch
Tryna make sense, I'm cocky I dont run off limit
Hulk Hog shit, I think I'm just too confident
Confident, confident, confident
I think I'm just too confident
Confident, confident, confident
I think I'm just too confident

[Verse 1:]
Don't give no fuck of what you think of me, I'm stuck to the dollars
Its just somethings with my demeanor that won't take me away
I've been accused of some stealing and most cases some robberies
But you know how the shit goes its all same
I pay attention and I listen but if money ain't coalition
Then I might not give a fuck bout what you saying
I tell her love me a long time baby give me all vibes
Ima show you how I got  her out my way

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
That bitch too bad shes just confident
Confident
I fuck her and get lost in the shit
Drowned tryna hit
That bitch pussy the best that I hit
No sleep no rest, I promise you I almost forget
She down with the shits
Cause I make boss moves off of the checks
Tryna get rich
I'm cocky I'm like rocky and shit
Fight til' the end its simple I ain't chasing a bitch
Thats common sense
