[Verse 1]
Uh, four B's and we in this, Bat Gang bitch big business, yeah you know what it is
Right from the beginning, I've been tryna keep it real with these niggas, but they just don't understand
Everything changed since I left home, tryna do it big, say I'm dead wrong
Can't worry about putting no one else on, motherfucker I'm still trying to put myself on
Every day blowing up my cell phone
I just disappear, yeah throw the stealth on
Uh, I'm looking at them like fools
But they still looking at me like fool what it do?

[Chorus]
We made it through the storm, lost a couple friends
I don't toot my horn, I just tell it how it is
Let me tell you how it is, once you get the fame and the money
Swear ain't nothing the same, but I can never change
Two cups, two blunts, yeah
They tell me that I'm doing too much, but I can never change
For real, for life, if its wrong, I dont wanna be right
No, I can never change

[Verse 1]
Uh, I can never change, man of my city, no LeBron James
Hands if you with me, yeah we on the way, team strong even though I had to make a couple trades, check
Hardhead's still up, nigga L's still up, better watch the throne, make you get up out your chair
I believe in God so there's nothing else to fear, rolling with the A-Team, I can never fail
I turn 'em into ashes, burn one
Tell these niggas I've been on my rap shit
West side throw it up
See if you can catch this, I pay dues in taxes, bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No, for nothing, came in the game, straight up out the oven, too hot to be ready
Nobody was ready, bitch, I'm on fire, somebody come with me, uh
Come get me
Boy talk that shit, life ain't fair, but, I can show you what that wafer is, uh
I'm off that shit, uh, coughing it, sick as fuck, call a medic
I ain't talking to these niggas like they all feds
Remember back in the days we was riding pegs
It was simple then, now it's all weird
Just call me five thou' cause I'm outta here

[Chorus]
