[Intro]
I'm a fuckin' bad guy nigga
Murder Gang nigga
Two guns up

[Bridge]
I'm poppin' ain't I
I got 10 racks in every damn pocket ain't I
(21, 21)
I'm poppin' ain't I
I got 10 racks in every damn pocket ain't it
She seen the savage and her panties went to droppin' ain't it
Diamonds dancin' on a nigga, playin' hockey ain't I
(Bling-blaow-blaow-blaow)

[Verse 1]
Run up a check and I bag and I fuck it, I love it
She lickin' and lickin' and suckin' I love her
Motherfuck a wedding bitch I'm a dog
Motherfuck a label, bitch I'm a boss
Wiping, I'm swiping, niggas stealin' sauce
Came from the mud, nigga paid the cost
Hundred thousand cash, hid it in the lawn
It ain't bout a bag, I don't wanna talk

[Hook]
(21, 21, 21)
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy
I fucked his baby moms he's a mad guy
Nigga you ain't gettin' no money, you a sad guy
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy
Hundred round drum, I'm a bad guy
Blow this bitch up like Osama, I'm a bad guy

[Verse 2]
I'ma do the dash when I back out
I'm a rich nigga, I can't take the trash out
Better cuff your bitch I brought my cash out
Nigga better watch they mouth cause I'll spazz out
Catch a nigga down bad and I'll air it out
Bitch I rep that Murder Gang and we'll clear it out
Catch a nigga main bitch and we gon' shell out
And she so fine, I love the way that booty spread out
And you know I keep that Glock with the red dot
Shoot a nigga in his face, he ain't bad now

[Hook]
(21, 21)
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy
I fucked his baby moms he's a mad guy
Nigga you ain't gettin' no money, you a sad guy
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy
Hundred round drum, I'm a bad guy
Blow this bitch up like Osama, I'm a bad guy
