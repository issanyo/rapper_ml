Ay

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I'm with Lil Tracy and we posted on the couch
We gone hit the mall take them goth hoes out
GothBoiClique make a goth hoe shout
With the GothBoiClique everytime I leave the house
I'm with Cold Hart and we rolling at the show
My teeth pink, Cold Hart chain gold
Black clothes, club lights I don't even own
How I'm getting home I'm just mobbin with my bros

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
I was in the background you was in the front
I was in the back of the club turnt up
Mackned strapped up he don't give a fuck
Funny how my ex girls wanna make up
Lil Peep getting bucks, big bucks, big bucks
Wrists still cut from my last break up
Bitch still stuck on the goth boy love
Telling me it's nothing like a goth boy love

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I'm with Lil Tracy and we posted on the couch
We gone hit the mall take them goth hoes out
GothBoiClique make a goth hoe shout
With the GothBoiClique everytime I leave the house
I'm with Cold Hart and we rolling at the show
My teeth pink, Cold Hart chain gold
Black clothes, club lights I don't even own
How I'm getting home I'm just mobbin with my bros

[Verse 2: Cold Hart]
You were in the background I was in the front
Me and Lil Jeep pull up Chevy truck (got)
Got her in all black with some fish nets on
GothBoiClique can't leave you alone
Sitting in my room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger while she giving me neck
Baby yeah I told you not to fall in love
'Cause baby there ain't nothing like goth boy love
Bitch
