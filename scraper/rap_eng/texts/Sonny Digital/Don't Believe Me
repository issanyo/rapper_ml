Two nines with the safe off
Molly got me talking fast like im Take Off
Couple leaching hoes i gotta shake off
I fucked up when i fucked her at the lake house
Niggas just wanna be Gucci
Niggas just wanna wear louie
Niggas just wanna be actors
Living their life like a movie
Cut
Its a wrap then its over dog
I know i ain't like yall i need my money lord
K to the E to the Y
Thats me thats me
I motivate stop trying to hate thats Key thats Key
K to the E to the Y
Not you not you
The limit is the sky
Thats not true not true
(chorus)
How you watch and don't believe me x3
A commodity in front of y'all
I done heard, seen, and done it all
How you watch and don't believe me x3
Clear as day, in front of yall
Looking for the truth, its right in front of yall

(Verse 2)
Niggas just wanna be famous
Niggas just rapping to say it
Trapping a act till they rapping
Rapping on addictive actions
Women that wanna be famous
I ain't mad that she fucking
Lovin me cause I'm buzzing
Can't fuck with a nigga with nothing
It ain't here yeah but its coming
Don't want to but I'm thugging
Hit a lick cause I'm struggling
That show money ain't nothing
Hoes just wanna me gucci, in a , rocking louie
Ho should've got her masters
Bitch living life so backwards

(Chorus)
