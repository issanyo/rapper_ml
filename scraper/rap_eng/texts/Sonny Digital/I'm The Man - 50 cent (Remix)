It's like 5am
Xan'd Out

(you know i'm the man) x2

I'm barred out

(bitch i'm the man
You know i'm the man, you know i'm the man)

I'm barred out

(you know i'm the man)
Bitch i'm the man
You know i'm the man
-bitches they know i'm the man

Verse I:
Bitch I'm the man

I don't understand
The concept of competition
-I don't see a man [Nah]

That's man enough to take the crown from my hand [Man]

Bitch I'm the man (i'm the man)

Go ask ya girlfriend
-I know that she know what I'm sayin'
You think that I'm playin'? [wha]

You know who I am
I ain't got the time to be playin'

Bridge:
Oh no, no, no, i ain't got the time {repeat}

Verse II:
I'm the man
I'm the man
I'm the man [let's getit]
Pop a xan
And again
And again
*xans shake*

Xans in my hand
*xans shake*

I'm on another planet
-And you wouldn't understand it
You ain't been through what i been through
-Mama kicked me out the house
Had to sneak in through the window

And that's true story
I was smokin' on some loud like a new born
-I'm luke warm

You don't want me gettin' hot
I might fuck around and burn down the whole block
-Nowadays all my niggas worry bout is gettin' shot
So i keep a green dot on my mufuckin' Glock *BANG*

So please just remember ya place

I hope you remember my face

I wanna be famous
I wanna make billions
I want me a mansion and maid

Who knew life could be this crazy
Feelin like im walkin' 'round at like 8 feet

Ima make the money
Money ain't gon' make me
-That's prolly why they hate me

Haha I'm on the top of the world
I'm at the party in the back room on top of ya girl
-She suck me up just like a vacuum
I nut in her curls
And then i give her right back with the mouth of a squirrel

*cough*x5

Gotdamn that's a fat ass dab
Took a bowl to the face
-Now I'm somewhere in the clouds
Or maybe even outter-space
-Somewhere that i can't be found

Bridge:
Ain't that the dream ?
Ain't that the dream ?
Ain't that the dream ?
Tell me ain't the dream ? {repeat}

Verse III:
Have you ever wanted somethin' so bad
You'll kill any nigga in the way ?

Man i want this shit so fuckin' bad
I just hope that you just stay up out my way

Smoke a cigarette
Get rid of the stress
'Cause the pressure really startin' to gain some weight

But you know it ain't phase a young nigga
Cuz you know that I'm a mufuckin man

Outro:
Bitch I'm the man
Hoe I'm the man
You know I'm the man x3

You know I'm the man
