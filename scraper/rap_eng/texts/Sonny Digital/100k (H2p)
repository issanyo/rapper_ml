[Chorus: Mathaius Young]
100k everyday, it's gon' be hell to pay
Everyday 100k, it's gon' be hell to pay
Every way, every J, get shit every way
Gettin' cake 100 ways, bitch I make it rain
100k everyday, it's gon' be hell to pay
Everyday 100k, it's gon' be hell to pay
Every way, every J, get shit every way
Gettin' cake 100 ways, bitch I make it rain

[Verse 1: Sonny Digital]
100k everyday, bitch I make it rain
Every way [?], bitch you in the way
Keep that shit 100 when I'm on that Hennessy
Real nigga, [?], 'cause he let my niggas free
I gotta keep it a hunnid, you keep this shit 99
I need my place on a hunnid, you need your place on a dime
When you keep it a hunnid, you doing that shit without tryin'
And I just made a 100k
And I ain't have to sell my name on the line

[Chorus: Mathaius Young]
100k everyday, it's gon' be hell to pay
Everyday 100k, it's gon' be hell to pay
Every way, every J, get shit every way
Gettin' cake 100 ways, bitch I make it rain
100k everyday, it's gon' be hell to pay
Everyday 100k, it's gon' be hell to pay
Every way, every J, get shit every way
Gettin' cake 100 ways, bitch I make it rain

[Verse 2: Sonny Digital]
100k everyday, bitch I make it rain
Swear you in the way, get out the lane
Yeah, keep that shit one hunnid on the Hennessy
Ayy, real hunnids, I feel like Lil P
Lets check the status, bought a apparatus
Everyday 100k, this shit automatic
Shit I gotta have it, been around the atlas
Hit a hunnid band [?] feeling like a bandit

[Chorus: Mathaius Young]
100k everyday, it's gon' be hell to pay
Everyday 100k, it's gon' be hell to pay
Every way, every J, get shit every way
Gettin' cake 100 ways, bitch I make it rain
100k everyday, it's gon' be hell to pay
Everyday 100k, it's gon' be hell to pay
Every way, every J, get shit every way
Gettin' cake 100 ways, bitch I make it rain
