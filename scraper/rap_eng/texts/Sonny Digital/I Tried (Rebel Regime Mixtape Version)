[Intro]
I tried I tried
And I tried I tried
I tried I tried
And I tried I tried

[Verse]
You try to be useful
But they take your kindness and use you
Play you for a fool
In the back they stab you
Mama say: keep your eyes on dem
Mama say: you will know your enemies from your friends
When they should be building bridges they put up a fence
And if mi murder one ah dem
Better know it was in self deffence
And if mi murder one ah dem
Better know it was in self deffence
Murder doh make mi murder dem

[Chorus]
I was born free a product of revolution
Born free, I was born free
I was born free a product of revolution
Born free, I was born free

[Verse 2]
Tried to assemble the army
I tried, I tried
Tried to wake you zombies
I tried I tried
And dem still ignore me
So please accept di warning

[Chorus]
I was born free a product of revolution
Born free, I was born free
I was born free a product of revolution
Born free, I was born free
[Chorus]
I was born free a product of revolution
Born free, I was born free
I was born free a product of revolution
Born free, I was born free
