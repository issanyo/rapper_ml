Money my religion nigga know that
Dollar sign now my zodiac
Rolex same color cognac
Got mud on the Louis V doormat
Whole bunch of whips in the cul-de-sac
I'm a dirty ass nigga like a mole rat
Jewelry hanging off a nigga like a coat rack
Friendly ass hoe get no daps

[Verse 1]
Money that's a young nigga's ???
Tryna run it up I'm tryna load it like P Diddy
Glock four five in the bed I sleep with it
Come in my shit bet you leave with some teeth missing
Jewelry hanging down like a bitch titties after she done breastfed
Racks got me walking like I got a fake left leg
I just want some money like a motherfuckin' meth-head
(Pew pew pew) Put a nigga on the deathbed
Holy moly guacamole
Rollie on me and its golden
Sipping purple potion got me slowed up like a roly poly
Smoking Obi-Wan Kenobi
Jedi kush and I'm choking
Roast a broke nigga taking pictures, talking and the hoe'in
That's the type of shit that we do
You get money? Nigga me too
What, you want her back?
Then I can make your bitch a up and leave you
Diamonds make it hard to see you
.223 and up when we shoot
Down a hundred thousand when ??????

[Verse 2]
Just a young, rich, high-class lowlife
I fuck with all hoes ain't got no type
Hit the jewelry store and got some more ice
Now my whole body lit up like a strobelight
Post up at Dior, pour a whole pint
Spot filled up with bows and Snow White
Remember when I the 'fro like Dolemite
Now me and money married, made my hoe throw the rice
??? dope and money on my ???
Pourin' fours up in orange soda like he in the can
Bringing truckloads in like I got my city yeah
Gotcha baby mama sniffing dope from out my fingernails
Ring around the rosy, stones all in my ring and Rollie
Posted up ??? at the telly with a gang of hoes
Run it through em', drop it through em'
Damn I got the bases loaded
Might go get an old school, try to throw some gains on it
