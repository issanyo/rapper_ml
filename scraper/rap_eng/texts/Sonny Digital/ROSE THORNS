[Verse]
I got all this
Drip
And she like the way i whip
Looking at my shits
Looking at my kicks
These louboutin you cannot
Touch this yea

All in the bay with a bad bitch
Kiss her on the neck and she laughin
Pushing these horses in a fast whip
Look at these pointers they careless
All of my diamonds they flashin

All of these hunnids I’m cashin
We movin on to this fashion
I take of mine with a passion
200 im digital dashin
Yea

The way that i drip
It’s a habit
I get my clothes
Straight from Paris
S/o to loose he in Paris
He tucked in his chain he embarrassed
I remember when she played me
She hit up my phone on a daily
I can’t cum unless you pay me
Ima real boss Lil baby

4 pockets full
In this cedes

Pearl with the suede you can feel it
I copped a Benz with no ceilings
I stay in my bag with no feelings
So i can get to these millions
Gotta pay my mama bills
N keep it 100
That’s what real is

Yeaa yeaaa yeaaa
I been leaning off a kick stan
You can watch how i balance
I remember flippin packs in
Now we getting to the racks
I want them hunnids them rackathinnnss
Gucci slippers in the bag
Extra cozy in my raf
We want the front then the back

Throw it all in the bag
Ion give a fuck about the
Price tag

If i want it i can have it
We ain't worried about the tag
Ima go and blow the bag
Goyard my bag just to stuff it
I got all the blue faces in the world
If you really want to touch it

Look

This not a Rollie is a audermars
Dick her so good she call me mars
Remember when i was a falln Star
Now we ride around in foreign cars

They ain’t believe it
They ain’t see
Now they wishing they was still around

Never bite bite the hand that feed ya
Ion really trust these niggas now

Every Rose got some thorns nigga
Had to grow from from the soil nigga
Careful who you calling your niggas

They be snakes on the low
I ain’t trippen boutga hoe
You can come and get ya hoe
All that hatin you a fan
You can stand in line  and
Wait yo at the door

Fasho
We countin money fasho
Stack of these hunnids
Can’t fold
Real niggas never fold
I stay on all 10 toes
Bin laden  my time to fasho
Trust me
