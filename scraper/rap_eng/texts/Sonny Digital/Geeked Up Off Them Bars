[Intro:]
Double cupping right here, you know what time it is
You nahm' sayin', its a trippy nigga tradition
I got the PS3, I just got the motherfuckin' PS3, nahm' sayin'
You know we always gon' stay super trippy mane

[Hook: Juicy J]
Geeked up off them bars
Geeked up, geeked up off them bars
Geeked up off them bars
Geeked up, geeked up, geeked up, geeked up
Geeked up off them bars
Off them bars
Geeked up, geeked up off them, geeked up off them
Geeked up, geeked up, geeked up, geeked up

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I'm on them Xanny bars, my weed is medical
And I ain't had nothing to eat but some edibles
Drink a lot of gin, in love with a stripper
Juicy J one crazy high ass nigga
Throwin' money in the club, bitches takin' pictures
And we keep that MoÃ«t flowing like a Bar Mitzvah
In the bottle section, bouncin' on a leather couch
Money everywhere, bouncin' out the Louis pouch
I ain't Willy Wonka, I don't sugarcoat shit
I keep codeine in my cup with a Sprite mixed

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
50 bars in a party bag, swag
And some weed from Afghanistan, swag
I'm on footballs, I hit the Superbowl
And I live in a liquor store
I'mma stop buying weed, I'mma make it grow
I'mma stop burning weed, I'mma make it smoke
I ain't no medical doctor but I am self prescribed
Ain't that nigga cooking up sushi but I got the eyes
Before I hit the plane I'm already in the sky
Two weeks later, I'm still in the sky
G6 jet, make them pussys wet
Have you ever snorted Xanax? Some trippy shit

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars, so geeked up off them bars
