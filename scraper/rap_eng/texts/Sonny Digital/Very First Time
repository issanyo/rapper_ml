[Intro]
Ba ba bum…ba ba bum…
Ba ba bum…ba ba bum…

[Hook]
It go, shawty you a ten
Let me chauffeur, you on a ride that never end
Take you all the places that you ain’t never been
Fulfill all your fantasies and ain’t none of em pretend
None of em pretend

[Verse 1]
Miss number after nine, damn it girl you fine
And I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t tryin’ to take your time
I know you probably been approached a thousand times
By lots of guys who probably lied about their lives
And left you hangin' out to dry
Well this ain’t that type of story, my love is mandatory
And if i had a price tag, very few could afford me
I’m mister call me when you horny, and I’ll be there till the morning
Now every sentence wit my name is so exclamatory
I stand in her guts and glory, she sing me a Spanish story
And she ain’t even Spanish, how unexplanatory
She keep it wet like a storm and i drive her she ridin' sports
See there’s a first time for everything and you deserve a felony
Cause shawty you a ten

[Hook]
It go, Shawty you a ten
Let me chauffeur, you on a ride that never end
Take you all the places that you ain’t never been
Fulfill all your fantasies and ain’t none of em pretend
None of em pretend,tend
She said she never tried
And it’ll be her very first time
Her very first time
Told her everything will be alright
Just buckle up tight and leave the rest to me
You ain’t gotta worry bout a thing at all
Relax girl everything will be ok
You need a chauffer, i’m the one to call
Sit back, enjoy the ride, and lemme me do my thang

[Verse 2]
I’m on it. Your boyfriends been demoted
I’m so potent shes so focused
No shazaam or hocus pocus
I divide her whats the quotient?
And no i’m not her man but i’m the closest
Thing to her heart when i enter
I’m in her like a splinter
Dessert her after dinner i go sinner
Than i send her to a place that she ain’t never been
And now she stuntin' hard like they never did
Damn

[Hook]
It go, Shawty you a ten
Let me chauffeur, you on a ride that never end
Take you all the places that you ain’t never been
Fulfill all your fantasies and ain’t none of em pretend
None of em pretend, tend
She said she never tried
And it’ll be her very first time
Her very first time
Told her everything will be alright
Just buckle up tight and leave the rest to me
You ain't gotta worry bout a thing at all
Relax girl everything will be ok
You need a chauffer, i’m the one to call
Sit back, enjoy the ride, and lemme me do my thang

It go, Shawty you a ten
Let me chauffeur, you on a ride that never end
Take you all the places that you ain’t never been
