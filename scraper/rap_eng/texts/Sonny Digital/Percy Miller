[Intro]
Bullet
Bullet
Bullet
Bullet


[Hook]
Two door coupe and the seats vanilla
Look into my eyes and you gon' see a killer
M.J. I'm bad all you see is Thriller
No limit boy, like I'm Percy Miller
Percy Miller, Master P, Percy Miller
Percy Miller, Master P, Percy Miller
No limit boy, like I'm Percy Miller
Master P, Percy Miller

[Bridge]
Yeah, this shit won't never stop
You can let them know I'll be forever hot
Never shoot myself like Chedda Bob
I'm a rude boy, I'm forever strapped

[Verse 1]
I don't give a fuck and you can tell'em that
All these bitches fishy like a pound of sprat
Talk behind my back you might run in my strap
Michael Corleone, I'm getting them whacked
I do this for my niggas all over the map
25 bands will catch me a rat
Check my resume, all I speak is the facts
Run up on my goons, it's a combo attack

[Hook]
Two door coupe and the seats vanilla
Look into my eyes and you gon' see a killer
M.J. I'm bad all you see is Thriller
No limit boy, like I'm Percy Miller
Percy Miller, Master P, Percy Miller
Percy Miller, Master P, Percy Miller
No limit boy, like I'm Percy Miller
Master P, Percy Miller

[Bridge]
Yeah, this shit won't never stop
You can let them know I'll be forever hot
Never shoot myself like Chedda Bob
I'm a rude boy, I'm forever strapped

[Verse 2]
Caught up in the moment, my nigga you show it
Drive by, convertible Lotus
Nobody won't notice!
Don't be to heroic
All my killers rollin'
All you niggas bogus
I'm the shit, I won't flush
Smoke you when I roll up
Eat you like a doughnut, don't you see a nigga focused
Chewin' my opponents, all I do is go in

[Hook]
Two door coupe and the seats vanilla
Look into my eyes and you gon' see a killer
M.J. I'm bad all you see is Thriller
No limit boy, like I'm Percy Miller
Percy Miller, Master P, Percy Miller
Percy Miller, Master P, Percy Miller
No limit boy, like I'm Percy Miller
Master P, Percy Miller

[Bridge]
Yeah, this shit won't never stop
You can let them know I'll be forever hot
Never shoot myself like Chedda Bob
I'm a rude boy, I'm forever strapped

[Outro]
.45 caliber'll let ya stop
My head hot like a kettle pot
Bloody murder when I catch a body
Red rum, nigga, me a take a shot
