[Intro]
Sonny Digital
Turn around tonight
Watch this
Sonny roll up gram of wax

[Chorus]
Daddy wasn't there
It isn't fair
How he ain't care
Daddy wasn't there
It isn't fair
How he ain't care

[Post-Chorus]
We just gonna laugh 'bout the past
We just gonna laugh 'bout the past
Hey, we just gonna laugh 'bout the past
Get rich, nigga, fuck the other half
Aye, look

[Verse]
Daddy wasn't there
He didn't care, anyway
Told him that I wanted to see him
He said "Not today"
Aye boo, yall know just like you
Uh, say I ain't told you
[?]

[Chorus]
Daddy wasn't there
He didn't care
It isn't fair
Daddy wasn't there
He didn't care
Aye, aye

[Bridge]
We just gonna laugh 'bout the past
Baby, fuck the other half
We just gonna laugh 'bout the past
Baby, fuck the other half

[Chorus]
Daddy wasn't there
It isn't fair
How he ain't care
Daddy wasn't there
It isn't fair
How he ain't care

[Outro]
We just gonna laugh bout the past, aye
We just gonna laugh bout the past
Middle finger other half

Daddy, Pt. 2

[Intro]
One, two, three, four
It ain't as simple as
As you say

[Verse 1]
When he thinks of his mother and father and how they were just one soul
All the lessons that taught him, from struggles that others will never know
Hangin' on to a limb of a branch and a stem of his family tree
'Cause the roots are still strong, but what wrong is one half is still unforseen

[Interlude 1]
...I mean like so many people can relate but shit is still individual if it happened to you...

[Verse 2]
When he's told his conception was a misdirection, that was not planned
But somehow they kept him, it's turned into a blessing that was not chanced
How a bastard can grow to be nasty known as full grown man
With a mind full of values, that came from a queen that did all she can

[Interlude 2]
...She kept a nigga, look at me now...

[Verse 3]
When he thinks of a time back in 2009, when he almost met
His unforseen half of his tree memories, he could not forget (how could I tho)
He would say he's too busy in some other city to meet his son (alright, my nigga)
He would not be free to receive company until fame begun

[Interlude 3]
[?]

[Verse 4]
When you cheat on your children, by lettin' them pillage without your care
And the lessons they learn from your presentless is found, about how life ain't not fair
When you hear this recordin', he needs no support of you and yours
Just knows to be never like you, when his seeds are born

[Outro]
