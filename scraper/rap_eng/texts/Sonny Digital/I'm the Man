[Intro]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the maaaan
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the maaaan

[Verse 1]
Aye, fifteen, I was gettin' money
Seventeen, I was gettin' money
Twenty, I was still gettin' money
Twenty-three came around, bet I'm still gettin' money
Came from the mothafuckin' bottom
Took it to the mothafuckin' top
Time moves forward, it don't stop
Take a look at the clock
I don't know what to do with all these bitches
And they're swearin' that they love me
I don't know what to do with all this cash
I'm in love with the money
I don't know what to do with all these niggas
I don't know what to do with all these bitches
I don't know what to do with all these hoes
I just know it's somethin' that you really need to know

[Pre-Hook]
Too much on my mind right now
On my grind right now
Lookin' for somethin' that don't need to be found right now
No time right now
Can't make your mind right now
Ain't got the time right now
Can't get behind right now
Gotta stay in line right now

[Hook]
Hope you understand that
Bitch I'm the man, ho I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, ho I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, ho I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, ho I'm the man, you know I'm the man

[Verse 2]
Been a man since a nigga can remember
Puttin' niggas on January to December
I'm a vet in the game, ain't changed, never changed
Same team, young nigga I'm a winner
(Where you from, nigga?)
Born by a hustler, I know I'm gon' get it
I made you niggas, now don't you forget it
Yes I'm the man, no I ain't playin'
So many bitches, no I can't be your man
Just to let you know, I'm probably fuckin' your friend
Hope you understand

[Pre-Hook]
Too much on my mind right now
On my grind right now
Lookin' for somethin' that don't need to be found right now
No time right now
Can't make your mind right now
Ain't got the time right now
Can't get behind right now
Gotta stay in line right now

[Hook]
Hope you understand that
Bitch I'm the man, ho I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, ho I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, ho I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch I'm the man, ho I'm the man, you know I'm the man
