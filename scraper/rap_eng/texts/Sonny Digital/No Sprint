[Intro]
My money keep runnin' over nigga, no sprint
These bitches see me and run to me, nigga, no sprint
For the money nigga, I'ma run to it, nigga, no sprint
And the money, these niggas talkin', already spent

[Verse 1]
Comin' off the line, Pierre Paul
Come into my life and see how we ball
Passin' yo bitch down, Chris Paul
Why these niggas talkin' like sissies, Rupaul
I'm goin' extra crazy, give me a straightjacket
I'm pullin' up at niggas shows and we straight jackin'
Chopper in his mouth, call that jaw-jackin'
Whole t-shirt wet, nigga here's a napkin
I always knew my life, I was gon' be something
And y'all thought y'all was some hoes to let me see somethin'
And my blunts be super fat like I rolled a tree or somethin'
And the feds be watchin' my movies like I'm on the Wii or somethin'

[Chorus]
My money keep runnin' over nigga, no sprint
These bitches see me and run to me, nigga, no sprint
For the money nigga, I'ma run to it, nigga, no sprint
And the money these niggas talkin' already spent
And I'm grindin' hard so I deserve to ball on y'all
And when a nigga was fucked up, I couldn't get a call from y'all
My money keep runnin' over nigga, no sprint
These bitches see me and run to me nigga, no sprint

[Verse 2]
I spit dope like I'm on crack or somethin'
Bitch can't treat me like no trick, girl treat me like a mack or somethin'
And bitch niggas, they get smacked for somethin'
And my life is so real, no Denzel can't act for nothin'
Get rich or die tryin, so I'm gon' get rich
If I put my eyes on your girl, I'm gon' get that bitch
If I put my eyes on that car, I'm gon' get that whip
And sometimes dope be losin' so you gotta know how to whip
Extra grams out the pot, got my wrist hurting
Extra girl on the block, I got your bitch workin'
Extra snitch on the block, yeah these niggas workin'
And that's for certain

[Chorus]
My money keep runnin' over nigga, no sprint
These bitches see me and run to me, nigga, no sprint
For the money nigga, I'ma run to it, nigga, no sprint
And the money these niggas talkin' already spent
And I'm grindin' hard so I deserve to ball on y'all
And when a nigga was fucked up, I couldn't get a call from y'all
My money keep runnin' over nigga, no sprint
These bitches see me and run to me nigga, no sprint
