[Hook]
I came from the noodles and the ramen
Made it from the sewers and the bottom
Been on the grind for a while now
I don't really got them types of problems
Now all we do is eat like piranhas
Got my ex girl goin' so bananas
Nah nah nigga, you don't know that
You don't know the half, nigga, go and do the math

[Verse 1]
I be goin' round the world
Hopin' TSA ain't goin' through my bag
They be mad at a nigga
Cause I'm wearin' all my jewelery
When I'm goin' through the scanner
Blrr, blrr, ring the alarm
Got a long flight, nigga bring me a bong
She just figured out a nigga name in a song
Now the fuckin' flight attendant won't leave me alone
Got a full house sauce, all Asians
They don't wanna let me into Vegas
If they don't wanna let us in the club
Then we kickin' the door down, just let me tie my laces
Back then, they ain't really wanna embrace it
Now I'm all up in they grill
Need some motherfuckin' braces
No it's new to you, bitch to me, it's just basic
See me on the pavement
It's a motherfuckin' payment, bitch

[Hook]
I came from the noodles and the ramen
City got it tatted on my stomach
Remember when the day wasn't sunny
Now everyday feel like summer
Still out here lookin' for the come up
Gotta make a band like a drummer
I got a big team in the photos
Everybody need a chain with the logo

[Verse 2]
We talkin' that money talk, it's no convo
Chillin' in my big crib, it's no condo
Just me and my main chick, watchin' Netflix
Bought her some big tits so I can motor-boat
And then I get up in that ooh-a
Tell 'em what's my name, baby whoo-a
Let me see you bust a bust, baby whoo-ha
One more hit and I be too high
Treatin' these bitches like we the 2 Live Crew
It wasn't too many, we made it here, right a few
Now I'm top of the cities, see from a bird's eye view
Pull up, park in any curb that I choose

[Hook]
I came from the noodles and the ramen
Could been a young nigga robbin'
