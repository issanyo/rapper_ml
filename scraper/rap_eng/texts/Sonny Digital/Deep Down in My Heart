Sonny Digital
This be the realest shit I ever spoke
Feel me?

[Verse]
I worship you, deep down in my heart
Oh baby, deep down in my heart
I'm all for you, deep down in my heart
But on the surface, I might treat you like you worthless
On the surface, I'm a do shit on purpose
But deep down in my heart, you know I need you
Deep down in my heart
Baby, deep down in my heart
I'm all for you, deep down in my heart
Oh baby, deep down in my heart
I worship you, deep down in my heart
But on the surface, I might treat you like you worthless
On the surface, I'm a do shit on purpose
But in my heart I'm all for you
Deep down in my heart, oh baby
Off the acid, I'm gone, bitch
LSD with the diamonds
Yeah niggas know I'm with LVRN
All to the fucking top, we be climbin'
Oh so many folks that wanna get down
But deep in my heart
I know that they really frowns upside down
Just tipping apart
Nah, you ain't with us, hey
Come here girl, you know I love you
Come here girl, you know I trust you
Come here girl, come here girl before you tell TMZ 'bout me
Come here girl, come here girl before you tell your peeps about me
Only tell 'em the good part, the good part
'Bout the good sex, the direct messages
As you hit me up
I treat you like shit on the surface but deep down in my heart
I worship you, deep down in my heart
