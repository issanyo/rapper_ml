[Hook]
All the times we've had
All the good and the bad
All the lives we've led
All the lies we've said
All the ups and downs
All the smiles and the frowns
Forget about the pain
The future is now
So let's celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Let's get hella faded
So let's celebrate
Celebrate
We barely made it, so let's celebrate
