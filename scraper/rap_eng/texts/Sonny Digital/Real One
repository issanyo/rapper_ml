[Chorus]
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
With a real one, with a real one, with a real one
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
With a real one, with a real one
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
With a real one, with a real one

[Verse]
Ayy, still never bought you no Jimmy Choos
Still never bought you no Gucci Louis
Still ain't got you a house with a pool
Still ain't got you a house with a pool
He ain't never really had nothin'
Still ain't never got nothin', hey
I'll get you the whole entire world
Matter fact get you your own world
Treat yourself, don't cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don't cheat yourself
He ain't got money but I got some left
He ain't got money but I got some left
Take you wherever you want
Take you wherever you want
Lick you wherever you want

[Chorus]
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
With a real one, with a real one, with a real one
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
With a real one, with a real one
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
How many bitches in the building wanna leave with a real one?
With a real one, with a real one
