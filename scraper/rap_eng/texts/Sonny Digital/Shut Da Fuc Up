[Intro]
Get up bitch, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up
Get up bitch, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up
Get up bitch, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up
Get up bitch, get up bitch, get up bitch, get up

[Hook]
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up
'bout to spend 100 on these models, tear the club up
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up

Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up
'bout to spend 100 on these models, tear the club up
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up

[Verse 1]
Came from the north side, now I'm sittin' court side, still close range with the shooters
Still sayin' fuck it, buying bucket  after bucket, I don't even know why I still do it
You didn't give me bread, you can give me head, hold up baby let me show you how you really do it
I walk like a pimp and I talk like a pimp, got game but she already knew it
I gave them a chance with the grams and the killa, couple million but they already blew it
I smoke that weed and I drank that drank, on the block and my trap house boomin'
I do it for my gangsters and I do it for the hustlers on the block tryna get somethin' movin'
I do it for my Three 6 niggas, that's Chat, that's Black, that's Paul, that's Pat
I do it for the hometown, all my niggas on now, had to put the city on my back
Niggas taking shots now, niggas gettin' shot down, married to the semi, I'm strapped
Shit gettin' hot now, ridin' with the top down, let the city know a nigga back
Might as well name this club after me cause I'm bout to tear it up like that

[Hook]
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up
'bout to spend 100 on these models, tear the club up
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up

Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up
'bout to spend 100 on these models, tear the club up
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up

[Verse 2]
I'ma hustle till I die, why you think I be so fly
I don't even break a sweat, promise I won't even try
30 inches off the ground, all my bitches booty round
Rolling up another doobie, I just put the other out
Bitch I got some dope that make your ass go run, play hide and seek
Bitch I got the fire weed, I'm the boss can't fire me
Made it through the violence, we had silencers and lots of beams
All my niggas proud of me, all them niggas doubted me

[Hook]
Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up
'bout to spend 100 on these models, tear the club up
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up

Order up a couple 100 bottles, tear the club up
'bout to spend 100 on these models, tear the club up
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up, I put a dub up
