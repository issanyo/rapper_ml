Man somebody better tell these (niggas)
Don't watch that
Yeah, don't watch that

When I'm in the city (nigga)
Don't hate what we doing
Don't watch that

[Verse]
Aye, moving 'round the city on a late night
Yeah this shit a great night
Young niggas always trying to stay high
(And best believe we did it) Yeah
Come and take a ride, come and take a ride
Come and get inside, come and get inside
Make sure you get a pack of Backwoods
Make sure them hoes ain't stale
Aye, make sure the motherfucking pack good
Cause I ain't trying to raise no motherfucking hell
Aye, I'm that (nigga)
Got the news from your motherfucking bitch
Aye, bitch
Really rather have a convo with my motherfucking jeweler 'bout the diamonds on my wrist
Wrist wrist wrist
Niggas said I wouldn't be shit
Well take a look at me now
Same bitches wouldn't let me hit
I bet they let me fuck now, yeah
Balmain stitches for the realest
YSL denim for the winners, aye
Gucci and that Louie (shit beginner)
(Boy, get that shit the fuck outta here)
Ever since mufucking Dennis been a muhfucking menace
But I gotta give it to myself I always been the realest
Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Hook]
Don't watch that
Yeah, don't watch that
