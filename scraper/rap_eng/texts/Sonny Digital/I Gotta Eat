[Hook]
Black glove, black mask, I gotta eat nigga
Do anything for the cash, I gotta eat nigga
Body parts in the trash, I gotta eat nigga
You looking sweet nigga, trick or treat nigga (2x)

[Verse 1]
Put the kids to bed and woke the chopper up
Skating on thin ice like a hockey puck
7 or 11 don't give a flying fuck
.357 MAC 11, go on try your luck
Two shots to the head I ain't sparing these Niggas
Halloween dunk, I be scaring these Niggas
No water hose, I be sprayin these Niggas
This my clique I ain't sharing these Niggas
Robbing spree to a shopping spree
Like a AIDS patient don't fuck with me
No MTV but I'm sucker free
High on fire can't touch a G
Kenny got the MAC on tuck with me
Dirt gang nigga they a bust for me
RIP if a nigga busting me
Cut throat ain't no trusting me
Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk
Dunk yeah that's right
Catch a nigga ass
Slipping broad daylight

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bricksquad in the hood, whole team hard
Come to Grove Street hope you got your green card (Grove Street)
Small talk but the pockets on my jean large
Vlade Dunk Divac, catch a mean charge
Hands on deck, knock em out fight night
Catch a nigga sleep, wake 'em up, night night
Mug on his face, think they don't like life
Lay his ass down, great white hype
Baby got a girlfriend, great white dyke
Credit or debit, either or, swipe swipe
Bricks in the house, ooh that's nice heist
Shoot a nigga dog Zane might bite
Buckin on my pistol like you're gun proof
Finna push your top back like a sun roof
You got Dirt Gang running in your trap, damn
It's Robbin season, fuck a Batman

[Hook]
