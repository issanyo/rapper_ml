[Intro]
2015 the year of the trippy niggas
Make way bitch
Cause we will pop pills, pop pistols and get high
And fuck the strippers
(that's what I did mane)

[Hook x2]
I bought some guns yesterday
I'mma buy some more today
Ain't no units in my name
I got out the way
Try me I'mma show you why they call 'em bitches throw away
Plenty bodies, only fuckin' 'round and be some more today

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm D Wade cause I got some new Heat
I ain't buying shit in the store, I'm buying mine off the street
Desert Eagle sticking out the wriggle
Ready to blow your ass off right in front of people
You keep a bunch of goons with ya
It won't take but one pistol
Shoot you in the head then you dead they gon' all miss ya
I hope your choice of car is not a Chevy but an armored truck
Cause Terrance is blowing shit up and they ride with us

[Hook x2]
I bought some guns yesterday
I'mma buy some more today
Ain't no units in my name
I got out the way
Try me I'mma show you why they call 'em bitches throw away
Plenty bodies, only fuckin' 'round and be some more today

[Verse: 2]
I'm coming for you niggas different angles, got a lot of routes
Hold up, cotton mouth
Is what you gon' have when you see this .44 to your face
Nigga BLAH, I ain't playin
And I ain't fan of none of these ratchet bitches
Put a Glock to your feet and yo back was flipping
Scared running marathon for your life
I suggest you get a gun for your wifey

[Hook x2]
I bought some guns yesterday
I'mma buy some more today
Ain't no units in my name
I got out the way
Try me I'mma show you why they call 'em bitches throw away
Plenty bodies, only fuckin' 'round and be some more today
