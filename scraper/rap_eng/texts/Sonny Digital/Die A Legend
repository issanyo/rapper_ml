[Intro]
Sonny Digital, Sonny Digital


[Verse 1]
There's not a thing you could tell me
I ain't have shit in my pocket
Ain't always have food in my belly
Momma just hired an apartment
Sister was fresh out of jail
Stuck in the bricks wit' a stick
Shit was just feelin' like hell
Shit was just feelin' like hell

[Verse 2]
Lyrics is simple as shit
As least I can say that I wrote 'em
I cannot relate to your Rover
Nigga I'm still in a Camry
Bet I go get a Carrera
Soon as the blues go to sellin'
I just came up from sellin'
Brought me a seven eleven

[Hook]
Bitch I'ma die a legend
There's not a thing you could tell me
You can not stay where I'm at
I just be hangin' wit' felons
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
There's not a thing you could tell me
You can not stay where I'm at
I just be hangin' wit' felons
I just be hangin' wit' felons
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend

[Verse 3]
Pop me a pill and I'm up
Swung me a gang and I'm stuck
Think I'ma pull his shit
'Cause I get a new bitch every month
Had the same sneakers for years
Had to go re-up my sauce
Fresh outta school wit' the road
Jam forever my dawg

[Hook x2]
Bitch I'ma die a legend
There's not a thing you could tell me
You can not stay where I'm at
I just be hangin' wit' felons
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
There's not a thing you could tell me
You can not stay where I'm at
I just be hangin' wit' felons
I just be hangin' wit' felons
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
Bitch I'ma die a legend
