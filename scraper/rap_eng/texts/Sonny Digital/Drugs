Whole sheet of tabs, whole bunch of weed
Nigga got drugs
Whole bunch of blow, couple ounce of lean
Nigga got drugs
Whole sheet of tabs, whole bunch of weed
Nigga got drugs
Whole bunch of blow, couple ounce of lean
Nigga got drugs
Blow, lean, drugs
Tabs, weed, drugs
Drugs, drugs drugs
Blow, lean, drugs
Tabs, weed, drugs
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Blow, lean, drugs

[Verse 1]
I just made a half a million off  free rock
Cap boy, beat box, nigga rock steady
I’m a Y3 nigga, not Reebok
Whole zip, nigga got my cup so heavy
Danco on the song, got your bitch kind of ready
How you think she love me, she ain’t never even met me
Get a band and I blow it like confetti
For them niggas that be hating
Saying that my niggas wouldn’t make it
Now we mixing up drugs, nigga codeine
Little blow, couple tabs, nigga good weed
Nigga can’t drive, nigga take my keys
Nigga might pass out if I don’t stop
Nigga I cash out every time a shot
Nigga got A1 niggas, straight drop
Drugs
