[Intro: Juicy J + Kanye West]
Did he smoke something before he came out here?
The answer is yes. I rolled up a little something
I'd be lying to you niggas if I told y'all I was sober
Winner's circle
We scraping up all this money man
The hustle continues

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm feeling faded and elevated
Buying everything so they can tell I made it
I'm rolling papers they trying to fade us
I keep that money coming in I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'm rolling papers, mane I'm faded
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Mane I'm blowing all this loud
I'll be damned to let a nigga take it
I'm a stoner, Wake and bake ain't no eggs and bacon
Plenty syrup, plenty loud, nigga you ain't heard
All this cake, a nigga making better than dessert
Keep the chopper on the lurk, Bombay quench my thirst
All these dead, Presidents I'ma need a hearse
I'm getting faded, I'm so high, bout to spark, Captain Kirk
Wasting weed in my lap, tryna roll up but I swerve
You say you not sucking dick bitch, you got some nerve
Put this condom on your ear hoe, fuck what you heard
I'm the shit, you just a turd
You ain't shit mark my words
Got bitches who give me brain, until I'm a nerd

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm feeling faded and elevated
Buying everything so they can tell I made it
I'm rolling papers they trying to fade us
I keep that money coming in I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'm rolling papers, mane I'm faded
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
They tryna talk about me cause I'm always staying positive
Riding clean, she waking up and cleaning that's just how I live
Niggas busy stressing, I'm just smoking weed and taking shots
Gotta keep the proper medication cause I think a lot
Fresh up out the Jacuzzi, smoking doobies in my subies
FaceTime her, bring her to the trap to watch some movies
Netflix, Champagne, Apple TV
Best believe it going down you fucking with a... G

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm feeling faded and elevated
Buying everything so they can tell I made it
I'm rolling papers they trying to fade us
I keep that money coming in I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'm rolling papers, mane I'm faded
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Scrape it up, scoop it up
We just tryna pile it up
Buying drugs where I'm from, you might get fucked like a slut
Medical Cali in my lungs, hustlers hold them Rollie's up
My gal skinny my pockets fat, stuffed like a Stromboli bruh
In the club, sparkles on them bottles like 4th of July
Booking a show for Mississippi all the way to Dubai
Rolling papers smoking like a hippie, brains in the sky
Warrant like police asking me questions, know I'ma lie
Cause I'm 100 like a Calico
Cigarillo full of medical
Do no deals off the credit roll
We popping bottles and we stacking dough

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm feeling faded and elevated
Buying everything so they can tell I made it
I'm rolling papers they trying to fade us
I keep that money coming in I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'm rolling papers, mane I'm faded
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it

[Outro:]
(Screech)
Mane I'm as high as motherfucker nigga
I'm in Vegas right now you know what I'm saying
I'm in a big ass suite recording this damn song
Fuck what you talking bout'
