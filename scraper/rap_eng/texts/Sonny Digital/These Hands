These hands done rack through plenty cash, (swag)
These hands done slap plenty ass, (swag)
These hands done whip plenty niggas, (swag)
These hands done bust plenty triggers (swag) (x2)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
With no thinkin' blew a half a ticket, when shit break I don't fix it
My last bitch wore red bottoms, my new bitch just learned the business
Bill Gates so old school, I'm speedin' by in a old school
Bad hoes, no more rules, fendi belt, bally shoes
High fashion for a high nigga
A bunch of bitches, an' my niggas
I'm rich fool with a lot of tools
All the bands got wet, I left the pool
Just a song, that got her wet
I gotta' out er' dress
It would be an understatement if I say we had sex
When Juicy in the club, them hoes be cashin' out
Cause I can't help it every time she bring that ass out
Angelina Jolie, that mouth could get no better
I just let her cool off then kick off the double header
