Verse 3:
She came through with that cheetah print, that kitty shave, no fur
That lingerie coming off today, that kitty cat gon' purr
What she do to me is absurd
I just sit back and observe
Her sex drive is in overdrive, I just can't describe, no words
She looking for the greedy love
On a greedy night
Said she got a appetite
And I'mma feed it right
See, you ain't eating right
Go ahead girl, take a bite
Bet you had a hard time, won't you go and trade it in for the easy life
I'll see you tonight

And your hair just right (hair just right)

Now back it up cause baby this yo life
