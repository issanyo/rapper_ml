RIP to them young boys who used to run the streets
Who got caught up in the beef, Rest in peace
You'll live forever on a shirt
You'll live forever on a shirt
Some niggas they dont deserve it
The situation was worthless
But look, you live forever on a shirt
And I'll forever own this shirt

[Verse One: Hugh Bloww]

Dancing in the livingroom to all the hottest 90s tunes
All we did was talk about life; how we be on soon
Damn you loved them Nike shoes
It was always hard to choose
Had to get them pennys though
Respect the game he love to hoop
Shaunda cheffed them tacos too
Everytime I come thru
Velly on the beats Hide and seek
Life was too smooth
Until them niggas chose to shoot
I wish we didn't need a crew
Dream to make it out the nasty
Fucked up how they come true
Who gone raise that lil you?
Prolly need a lil me
Next time Im in the Sag
Thas the man I wanna see
To make sure he know who to be
A better Q
The realest G
And rest in peace to QG
Thas my nigga man

[Verse Two: Que]

I recall seeing it all back when I was young
Never thought that I would live to be 21
Cuz its some niggas I grew up with that ain't breathing
Like my uncle Jimmy, shoutout Timmy W(?)
They did him foul faceshot while he was sleeping
And shoutout to that bitch made nigga Meech
Killed my uncle dead by my grandma stoop
And he got hit one time by a 22
And I just knew that he would pull thru
So I wasn't really trippin til I heard the bad news
Seeing my momma breakdown it made break too
Rest in peace I know you watching
Im just tryna make you proud and make ya baby sister smile
Tryna keep it kosher cuz I know you looking down
But the future isnt promised so Im tryna live for now
So until we meet again I salute and take a bow, RIP

[Verse Three: Sonny Digital]

Its not about how long you live it's how well you live it
Lets talk about the shit you did and not the shit you didn't
Everything gotta be great from the choices that you make
Every move that you take gotta learn everyday
The other day I had a convo with my friend
She asked if I knew Ben
I said the one from Chi town
He gotta shot now supposed to go to the league
Then he got shot down now he underground way down six feet
Its kinda funny how life be
To think how likely I might be the next on a white tee
I can't picture that movie no spike lee
My pops passed in a car crash
It hit me fast I was kinda mad
All I got for memory is my blood
Its love I swear I did this shit for us
Whassup
