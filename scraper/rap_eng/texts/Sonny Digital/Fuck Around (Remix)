She gon’ fuck around with the fuck around

[Verse 1 – Rico Love]
She gone fuck around with the fuck around
She gone fuck around with the fuck around
Used to date a ball player riding in that G5s
But the bitch riding in the buses now
Nigga I ain’t talking tour bus, I mean Greyhound
One way with the work on her
And she gone need more than some holy water
You gone have to drop the whole church on her
My nigga Que said he knew the bitch
I said word, is it cool if I use the bitch in my verse
Os it cool if I use the bitch in my song
Them bitches be like we working their nerves
But it put me in a 2 door
Naw, sike, already had a coupe ho
Been rich ‘fore a nigga hit the stage
Bitch I been paid, what about you though?

[Verse 2 - Que]
She just like for me to pick her up and then dick her down
If you ain't gotta flipper then lil nigga you are missing out
Gotta keep it pushin’, never kick it at my bitches house
Que swapping bitches like ya britches, gotta switch em out
We could leave the kids in the house, fuck her then kick out
Triple double with ya bitch, 10 assists, Imma dish her out
Put her in the mix with all my niggas just so they can see what this about
If she don’t know what to do, she better figure out
Let my nigga dick her down, bet she get the picture now
Niggas coming in and out, lined up like In & Out
All my niggas slide through, she look like a drive through
Like the pussy bald head and pink, like Caillou
Beat it, beat it, beat it till it’s red like a Piru
Then I disappear, get ghost like Ja Rule
Pass it to my dog Imma throw a perfect spiral
She gon’ fuck around, nigga anything liable

[Hook: Que][x2]
She gon’ fuck around with the fuck around

[Verse 3 – Bankroll Fresh]
She gone fuck around with the fuck around
She gone fuck around with the fuck around
She gone suck me up then suck me down
Fuck ho good, she [?]
We didn’t even use a fucking mattress
I just call her up, satisfaction
[?] truck money, it’s fashion
She was sucking dick, I shot it on her glasses
Bankroll pulling up, [?]
Yellow 458, 357
Young nigga preaching, just [?] like a reverend
Life is a gamble, Rose, I’m in the lamb
Nigga was mad, all of y’all nigga trapping
Throwing gang signs up while they be dapping
Don’t fuck around with the fuck arounds, we clapping
Fuck around with the fuck arounds, we clapping
