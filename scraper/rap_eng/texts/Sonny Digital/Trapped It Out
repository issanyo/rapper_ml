[Hook]
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I'm really living what I'm rapping 'bout
It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I'm really living what I'm rapping 'bout
It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out

[Verse 1]
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap going crazy
Junkie heat the dope, fiendin' for the blow
Nosey old neighbor (double up)
Keep on calling twelve while pushing bail
Someone gon' pay up
Pour up the 4's and the lemonade while
We cook up in the microwave
TMT, Slaughter Gang
Gotta keep the choppa by the door
Fourty in the sofa, I've been whippin' soda
Plug came in with the pains
Drop it in the soda, got me leanin' over
Beat the block, and gotta feed the block
Think of it like the pyramid
Selling ice cream to a dope fiend
Buying ice cream for the children

[Hook]
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I'm really living what I'm rapping 'bout
It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I'm really living what I'm rapping 'bout
It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out

[Verse 2]
If you take a picture, itâ€™ll last longer
On your ass like some pants on you
Slaughtergang, slaughtergang, 2-gang, murdergang, smash homie
Trap house going crazy
Beat the block, now I'm having cash homie
All my nigga thinkin' everybody bloody
Nigga playing, we gon' spazz on him
I come from a Penny, no Hardaway
Now I heat the club and make a title wave
I got stain, I'm poppin' like a microwave
I trapped the whole house out in Michael J
Michael Jackson that them Jimmy Choo
Drop the Mortal Kombat off and finish you
You tried to gain, nigga outbidded you
Lotto Savage having plenty juice

[Hook]
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I'm really living what I'm rapping 'bout
It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I'm really living what I'm rapping 'bout
It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out

[Outro]
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
I'm really living what I'm rapping 'bout
It ain't nothin' for me to cap about
All my life I had to trap it out

All my life I had to trap it out
I took you whole house and I trapped it out
