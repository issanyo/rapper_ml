[Verse 1: Los]
Ugh, king!
Countin money, get me high
Custom custard colored Caddy whippin by
Sittin high
Man I’m talkin bout two fours, like K O B E
Got 2 whores from K O D
Hop up in these 2 doors, you can J.O.B. me at the same time
The same time, the same damn time
I’m with Diddy, I’m with Future at the same damn time
On the BET stage, got a nigga high like a PCP
Rays got a nigga fly as a bitch
My watch is a Benz, my Benz is a house
My house in the hills, the hills in the sky
My mind in the clouds, reminding the clouds
I’m out for the shine
Bitch I’m faded, off this green
No, not weed, talkin' C.R.E.A.M
Yea I grind, coffee beans
When my high come down, gotta hit another lick
So I’m up like a fiend tryna get another fix

[Hook: Los]
See some niggas
Need codeine
Pop a molly
And more lean
I get money, like go me
That’s my drug, I OD
Like go me, I OD
Like homie, I OD
See some niggas
Might blow trees
I get money, I OD

[Verse 2: Los]
Man we rock Mink and beaver bare
Lion, Fox, and Rabbit too
Just never be her beaver bear
‘Cause that pussy like a zoo
I like em new like my clothes, when I cop and grab a few
I’m not just addicted to money, I got shopping habits too
I be like Jordan, J’s
Your money fadin away like Jordan’s J
Boy I play, the stores and pay
A lot of money out where the Hoyas play, enjoy your day
‘Cause I’m enjoying mine, doing me; wrapping rubber bands around a stack of $100 bills
If you wanna bet I wouldn’t make it
Then I’d probably take your bet and fuck around and spend your money on my wheels
‘Cause I’m ridin on cocaine
Nah man don’t mean I’m high, that mean it’s white on white
And top going back so far that I bet that bitch probably
Need Rogaine
When my high come down, gotta hit another lick
So I’m up like a fiend tryna get another fix

[Hook]

Like go me...
