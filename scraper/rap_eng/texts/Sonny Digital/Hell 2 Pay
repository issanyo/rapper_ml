These motherfuckers, I walk in and change the weather on these motherfuckers
I know they feelings get heavy in this motherfucker
But who is y'all? Kill 'em all, what you bodies for?
In the hall but you used to call me the underdog
Shine on 'em let's get it, pull the ride up and I whip it
I designed all of you niggas, I'm the God to all of this shit
Shit, who that kid?, I'm the shit, look who I'm with
Look who I'm with, well legit, only on that

[Verse 2]
Cars, boy I'm taking cars, I don't want your broad
Boy I'm gone, boy I'm taking off, I ain't hearing y'all
Steady talking, but why you walking? I'm in the yard
In the market, they meet me often, I ran it up
Yeah, 100 degrees, hot as hell in this motherfucker
They coming to see, going to tell you lil niggas
Don't want it from me, they toast down, I came so down
We're 10 toes down and I can't slow down
