[Intro: Pat Ryan]
Swank
Mmm-yah
Yah

[Chorus: Pat Ryan]
She caught my eye, baby girl so fly
Pull up on me, yeah, girl don't be shy
I know you got that juice and these other girls dry
Always breakin' necks everytime you walk by
Dressed like a queen, gettin' money like a boss
Balenciaga heels, it don't matter what it cost
Diamonds on her neck, ice bite like frost
Lil' mama so bad, shawty know she got the sauce

[Verse 1: Pat Ryan]
I just wanna get to know ya
Unravel while we travel, I got things to show ya
Crib with a terrace in Paris, champagne I'll pop it for ya
I know we new but what we got is true cuz baby I adore ya
Yah
Don't stop mama
Make it pop, now we gettin' groovy
Power couple, camera flash, and lookin' like a movie
She don't blink or think about how I be gettin' groupies
Who that? Who that? Pat and [?] I say you'll be
Yep
She know I ain't a player, I don't play
Hold it down, she not worried if I'm leavin', ain't no way
From the start stuck with me comin' up with [?]
So forever we together whether what my heart gon' say

[Chorus: Pat Ryan]
She caught my eye, baby girl so fly
Pull up on me, yeah, girl don't be shy
I know you got that juice and these other girls dry
Always breakin' necks everytime you walk by
Dressed like a queen, gettin' money like a boss
Balenciaga heels, it don't matter what it cost
Diamonds on her neck, ice bite like frost
Lil' mama so bad, shawty know she got the sauce
