[Intro]
This point niggas ain't catchin' up, get over that
Touch me and we make you an organ donor
Boy, we over-strapped
Count the money by myself
I don't need help with them bands
God, I can handle my enemies
Just protect me from my friends
Bulletproof all in the Benz
I can't let 'em leave me for dead
Uncomfortable with you be-
Sonny rollin' grams of wax

[Chorus]
Niggas and bitches playin' me, okay we over that
(They know we over that)
Niggas started the money race way ahead
They got overlapped
(You know they got overlapped, nigga)
Niggas and bitches playin' me, okay we over that
(We ain't trippin' 'bout it, bro)
Niggas started the money raise way ahead
They got overlapped
(We ain't been hearin' 'bout you, bro)
Now I'm like look at me now, look at me now
Took off on them niggas like
Look at me now, look at me now
Still will take off on a nigga like
Look at me now, look at me now
Took off on them niggas like
Look at me now, look at me now
Still will take off on a nigga like
Niggas and bitches playin' me, okay we over that
(You know I'm over that)
Niggas started the money race way ahead
They got overlapped
(You know they got overlapped, nigga)
At this point niggas ain't catchin' up, get over that
(Get the fuck out my face)
Touch me and we make you an organ donor
Boy, we over-strapped
(I'ma blow 'em away)

[Refrain]
And I count the money by myself
I don't need help with them bands
God, I can handle my enemies
Just protect me from my friends
Bulletproof all in the Benz
I can't let 'em leave me for dead
Uncomfortable with you behind me
My uncle got hit in the back of his head

[Verse 1]
My niggas was broke, we used to steal out the store
Buyin' and sharin' our clothes
Finally rent us a Benz and they sent me down
Got lucky it wasn't for long, out of that bitch
Signed a gun law, I still play with them sticks
The lawyer appeal so I won't catch a bid
And I handle that wet like I'm back in the pit

[Chorus]
Niggas and bitches playin' me, okay we over that
(They know we over that)
Niggas started the money raise way ahead
They got overlapped
(You know they got overlapped, nigga)
Niggas and bitches playin' me, okay we over that
(We ain't trippin' 'bout it, bro)
Niggas started the money raise way ahead
They got overlapped
(We ain't been hearin' 'bout you, bro)
Now I'm like look at me now, look at me now
Took off on them niggas like
Look at me now, look at me now
Still will take off on a nigga like
Look at me now, look at me now
Took off on them niggas like
Look at me now, look at me now
Still will take off on a nigga like

[Verse 2]
You niggas bug, why niggas hittin' me up?
Knowin' I ain't tryna talk, don't hold bitches up
Like baby, right after we fuck
Get up and go straight to the car
Keep me low key
And control your nigga or that boy gon' die in your arms
When I drop you off
Don't expect a call until the next time I get hard
We ain't gotta kick it
I don't owe ya'll niggas, ya'll don't owe me shit
[?] with the steak and chicken
I was just choppin' up meat sticks
I was just in a room with a nigga that'd kill over 34 cent
Now I'm sittin' in the Coup with a nigga
Just ran up 30 more strips, bitch

[Refrain]
Count the money by myself
I don't need help with them bands
God, I can handle my enemies
Just protect me from my friends
Bulletproof all in the Benz
I can't let 'em leave me for dead
Uncomfortable with you behind me
My uncle got hit in the back of his head

[Verse 3]
If it happened to Dex, it could happen to me
When I shoot it, I'm makin' 'em land
Look at what these niggas doin'
My baby, don't listen to what niggas sayin'
Feelin' like a drum line down in Hampton
Look at how niggas handle them bands
Fuck money, I'ma put pineapples over you niggas
'Cause you niggas ham

[Chorus]
Niggas and bitches playin' me, okay we over that
(They know we over that)
Niggas started the money raise way ahead
They got overlapped
(You know they got overlapped, nigga)
Niggas and bitches playin' me, okay we over that
(We ain't trippin' 'bout it, bro)
Niggas started the money raise way ahead
They got overlapped
(We ain't been hearin' 'bout you, bro)
Now I'm like look at me now, look at me now
Took off on them niggas like
Look at me now, look at me now
Still will take off on a nigga like
Look at me now, look at me now
Took off on them niggas like
Look at me now, look at me now
Still will take off on a nigga like

[Outro]
Still will take off on a nigga like
Still will take off on a nigga like
Still will take off on a nigga like
Look at me now
