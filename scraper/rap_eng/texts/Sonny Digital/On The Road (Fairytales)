[Verse 1: Mo'Haze]
I've been on the road all day
Devil want my soul
No way
It's so cold, cold, cold
Where I stay
Love don't have a home
Where I stay
I've been drinking
I've been swerving in the wagon
Can't stop thinking
Why you talking?
Please stop touching me
Please stop sucking me
All this money
Made the world move at different paces
All these white faces on me
You'll know I'm dangerous
You'll see the paintings
Condos on these placements
Warhol on these placements
I know you can't take it
Centerfolds we
Bake them
Roll them
Fold them like crepes then
Then we move
And shake them
I don't know what you been drinking
I don't know what you been thinking
I don't know what you been taking
Mama always told me
That the Gods live forever
I'm gone listen to her when she say its forever
God



[Verse 2: Steve Ricks]
I've been on the road all day
Devil want my soul
No way
It's so cold, cold, cold
Where I stay
Love don't have a home
Where I stay
I've been smoking
Losing patience
Losing feeling
Memory fading
If I die
Justify
Scars still linger
Call my beeper
So we can talk
Aye what's the word?
You down or not?
Baby this shit is absurd
In the function with your man
But your eyes on me
Under oath girl
Don't you lie on me
Cause I'm that nigga
Aye yeah you know
Stress forever
Run cover
Finna blow
Watch these hoes disappear like magic
