[Verse 1: Que]
Momma caught me red handed playing with them pans
Tried to have a talk with me and spank a nigga hand
Daddy on the phone and then he tried to reprimand
Till I dug in my pocket and I flashed a bunch of bands
I used to be a hooper till a nigga started juugin'
Got that taste of money and it felt better than pussy
While you was in your class, I was skipping playing hookie
Tryna come up on a mill as a kid juugin'

[Chorus: Sonny Digital]
I juug, finesse, all I want is cash
I juug, finesse, all I want is cash
Cash bring you power and the power bring respect
Gotta learn to juug if you gon be one to finesse
(x2)

[Verse 2: Sonny Digital]
If finessing was a sport, I'd be the first round pick
Houdini with them numbers man, watch him do them tricks
If the plug gave me 20 then 10 is what you get
NASCAR finesser cause I get on gold quick
Finesse you out your shit and make you buy your shit back
Name a nigga in the nation who finesse it like that
Never played football but I'm 'bout to sack
I was born in this shit, man that's what y'all niggas lack (finesse)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
[Que]
Okay, I finagle a nigga just cause
I took off and swindled my plug
I went to my jeweler, blew money like hookah
Now my wrist it look like a [?]
You little niggas is scrubs
Jacking and robbing for dubs
With money come power then next is respect
So broke niggas get no love

[Sonny Digital]
[?], nigga fuck how you feeling, I done made me a million
Just chilling, finessing and flipping, I done made me a living
In the kitchen, whipping up them pigeons, tryna flip them digits
It was loud, I'm finessing you now, cause it really [?]

[Chorus]
