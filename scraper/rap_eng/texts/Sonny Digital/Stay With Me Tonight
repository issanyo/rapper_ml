[Verse 1]
Now we been tryin to kick it
For like six to eight months now
You're the one that I'm wanting
You can tell when I come around
I really really need you
You can tell it when I touch you
I hate it when we're fussing
So I put none above you

[Chorus]
And you say please won't you stay with me tonight
Cause I been feeling lonely
And want someone to hold me
And then you say please won't you stay with me tonight
Cause I been feeling lonely
And want someone to hold me

[Verse 2]
No I'm not trying to lie
No no
I wanna be your guy
For on and on
Tell me what I gotta do
To make this thing come true
Cause I just really need it
I know you want it too
And then I say I'm leaving
And you do that thing that you do
And then you say

[Chorus]
Please won't you stay with me tonight
Cause I been feeling lonely
And want someone to hold me
When you say please won't you stay with me tonight
Cause I been feeling lonely
And want someone to hold me

[Verse 3]
And I could be the one
To hold you all night
If this is what you want
Then let me know that I'm alright
Cause baby I ain't lying
Lately I'm trying
To get deep into your heart
But then I should start to walk
And you say

[Chorus]
Please won't you stay with me tonight
Cause I been feeling lonely
And want someone to hold me
Then you say then you say please won't you stay with me tonight
Cause I been feeling lonely
And want someone to hold me
When you say
