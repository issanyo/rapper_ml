[Intro]
Wrap it up and ship it out
Wrap it up and ship it out
Wrap it up and ship it out

[Hook]
When pack touched down, I was 21
I bought a F&N, hold 21
When I couldn't get a zip, I bought a 21
You ain't jump out in the streets, then you a you ain't jump out in the streets till you was 211
I was in the booty club 'fore I was 21
I lost my bestfriend when I was 21
I'm Slaughter Gang bitch and I'm 21
I just flooded out my wrist, it cost me 21

[Verse 1]
Wrap it up & ship it out
Yeah, cooking up that shit inside my grandma house
Yo bitch, she love the gang, I put it in her mouth
I might tie yo kids up and pistol whip yo spouse
Hunnid gas bags, nigga trappin' out a loft
Disrespect the Slaughter Gang, I'll get you off
I had a lotta fake friends, had to cut em off
And I'll pay you for pussy, tell me what it cost

[Verse 2]
I fucked ya bitch and passed her, it took me 21 minutes
Bitch I'm in the studio, I'll call you when I'm finished
Yo baby daddy broke, I bet you still eatin' Wendy's
I'm pourin' up syrup, bitch I don't drink Remy
I fucked ya baby momma then I nutted on her titties
I hit for 20 bricks and then I went and bought a Hemi
Ima real street nigga, I got street niggas with me
And free Big Guwop cuz these rap niggas bitches
