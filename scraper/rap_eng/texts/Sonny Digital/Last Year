Yeah, this time last year, aye
I was staying at my momma's house
All my problems, tryna kick 'em out
All the problems got a bigger route, yeah
This time last year, yeah
Know a nigga 'bout to blow, aye
They was moving way too slow, aye
Thought I had to let 'em know 'bout
This time last year, aye
I was dipping in the stash
I was running low on cash
I had to go get the wagon, yeah
This time last year
I had to get a new Rollie
Shorty act like she ain't know me
Lost friends and focus, yeah
This time last year
