Im hotter than water that sit in the car
I keep my sauce in a jar
You might not see it but i am a star
Just gotta go do my part

Public restroom, cause i am the shit
Hit Them with glist from the wrist
Come Get your girlfriend cause she on my dick
Taking your bitch like a pic ( Uh, Wait )

Just like vans , im off the wall
She goin' pick up if i call
Wrist is piss like bathroom stall
Call me lonzo , cause i ball

Preme Logo on my drawls
Hella hoes , like santa clause
Bape sharkhead might bite you
Woulda thought i got my hoodie the movie called "Jaws"

Need 10 on my wrist
Bitch thats cinco 2 times
And im all about my lettuce
Like a fucking crouton

Boy im talking bout' that money
Gotta' get my groove on
Fuck my ex , i think its funny
Think i been moved on

All of these niggas , they know how it go
If i got your hoe then its wraps
Please stop the shit , man i know you ain't with it , you never stepped foot in the trap
Gold on my wrist, and it cost me like dos ,  touch my shit , you will get zapped
Fuck all these niggas , except for my niggas , this for the folks, think i can't rap
