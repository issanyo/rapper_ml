[Intro: Desiigner]
Git git git! High!
Git git git! High!
Grrrraaah! Git git git git!
Sonny rollin' grams of wax

[Hook: Meek Mill, Desiigner & Quavo]
You got a bag and I got a bag
But they know the difference (Bags, bags)
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash
But they know the difference (Cash, cash)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference (Skrrt skrrt)
Bought the machine in 2016
So they know the difference (2016)
The diamonds is shinin', the rollie is clean
So they know the difference (Grrrraaah!) (Ice, shine)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
Your bitches is bad, and my bitches bad
But we know the difference (Bad, bad, bad, bad)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
In the trenches, gettin' back at it
With the haters and the backstabbers
Head huntin' for a wack rapper
Head huntin' for a wack rapper
I ain't really with the back and forthin', nigga
I'mma send a hundred stacks at ya
Nigga probably send the rats atya
Ninja turtle with a rat master
All this money won't stop, nigga
30 round that Glock, nigga
Feds lurkin', we hot, nigga
Swing through in that drop, nigga
Moon walkin' in that dealer, like it's Thriller with the skrilla
I'm a cop, nigga
I'm a killer, you a cop, nigga
Kick the door like we SWAT, nigga
They know the difference (They know the difference)
I really get it (I really get it)
I'm with the scammers
I'm buying bags for all of my bitches (For all of my hoes)
Only the family
Keep all them niggas from out of my business (From out of my business)
'Cause I really did shit
I rapped about it, you know that I lived it

[Hook: Meek Mill, Desiigner & Quavo]
You got a bag and I got a bag
But they know the difference (Bags, bags)
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash
But they know the difference (Cash, cash)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference (Skrrt skrrt)
Bought the machine in 2016
So they know the difference (2016)
The diamonds is shinin', the rollie is clean
So they know the difference (Grrrraaah!) (Ice, shine)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
Your bitches is bad, and my bitches bad
But we know the difference (Bad, bad, bad, bad)
Quavo

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Get to the bags, run up the racks
My bitches are bad, your diamonds finessed
Came in on a jet, 50 my neck
30 my clip, I pour a eight and just sip
I put the brick on the trip, I put the dick on her lip
Money before the deal, I had to go bury a mill
She wanna pop the whole perc
I told her we splittin' that pill
My niggas been in the field
We know you put something in that seal
Used to pull up in that Audi, I make the work do pilates
Screw the lil tip on the uzi, young nigga shootin' in silence
Huncho, I'm havin' the stars and stripes
Lil nigga you is a private
Too much money that will change your life
Power moves on a island

[Hook: Meek Mill, Desiigner & Quavo]
You got a bag and I got a bag
But they know the difference (Bags, bags)
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash
But they know the difference (Cash, cash)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference (Skrrt skrrt)
Bought the machine in 2016
So they know the difference (2016)
The diamonds is shinin', the rollie is clean
So they know the difference (Grrrraaah!) (Ice, shine)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
Your bitches is bad, and my bitches bad
But we know the difference (Bad, bad, bad, bad)
