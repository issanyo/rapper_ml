[Intro: Jimmy Wopo]
I might blind myself
Can't find myself
I be lost in the lean, lean

[Verse: Jimmy Wopo]
Ask your father who he used to serve, all us put in that work
Ask your mama who used to work her nerves
All us out on that curb
Whipped the heart out, all us on that first
Trying buy us a True shirt
Ask your daughter, Nes was out here first
Nigga start usin' our words
Aunt Jemima all in the kitchen, no syrup, all us sippin' on syrup
Killers and robbers, ask any nigga in the Burg
How man niggas I burped
Before I had problems all my niggas had murked
One of y'all niggas got dirt
Ounce of coppers, always hollowed my turf, all us pop them percs

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmy Wopo]
I got two phones, one for the flavors and one for the drugs
And my styrofoam, double it up and I fill it with mud
I got two traps, one for the racks and one for the flood
I got young thugs, follow you after the club if you mug
All us turn up (ayy), all us no love (turn up)
Baby bottle no cup (baby), Sneak Gang, no trust (gang gang)
Raw dog, no cut (urr), raw dog, no rug (urr)
Big dog, no pup (urr), ice on gold dust
Down to my last dub, that shit get raw with the porno like hug
Grams in the pants plus bricks in the mattress and zips in the rug
I'm from the projects, where it get fresh but ain't hop in the tub
Lay low hallways, rest on the cracks from my young nigga drugs

[Chorus: Jimmy Wopo]
I give the drip to Koli (ayy)
I got the sauce in my drink (the sauce in the lean)
I turned it all Easter pink (ayy)
I brought your mama some clean (ayy)
I got that wop in my sleeve (the wop in my sleeve)
I just get lost in the lean (I just)
I just get lost in the lean (i just be lost in the lean)
I get the call from cocaine (i just get lost in the lean)
I give the drip to Koli (the clean)
I got the sauce in my drink (codeine)
I turned it all Easter pink (ayy)
I brought your mama some clean (ayy)
I got that wop in my sleeve (ayy)
I just get lost in the lean (i just be lost in the lean)
I just be coughin' codeine (lean)
I get the call from cocaine, ayy

[Post-Chorus: Jimmy Wopo]
I'm killin' all different teams
Fuck papa gay or he team
I'm only cheatin' 'bout these lames (ayy)
Groucho OG, candy cane (Young Gus)
Tom Brady, we play for the rings (the rings)
You play with the lord of the rings (the rings)
You war with the lord of the rings (the ring)
Like Savage we slaughter your gang (ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmy Wopo]
I got two phones, one for the flavors and one for the drugs
And my styrofoam, double it up and I fill it with mud
I got two traps, one for the racks and one for the flood
I got young thugs, follow you after the club if you mugged
All us turn up (ayy), all us no love (turn up)
Baby bottle no cup (baby), Sneak Gang, no trust (gang gang)
Raw dog, no cut (urr), raw dog, no rug (urr)
Big dog, no pup (urr), ice on gold dust
Down to my last dub, that shit get raw with the porno like hug

I turned it all Easter pink (ayy)
I brought your mama some clean (ayy)

I just get lost in the lean (I just)
I just get lost in the lean (i just be lost in the lean)
