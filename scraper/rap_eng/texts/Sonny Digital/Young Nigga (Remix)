[Intro: Que & Quavo]
Young rich nigga made a milly off swipin' (hey)
Seen it come and go, like a motherfucking psychic

Remix, remix, remix, remix, remix

(Young nigga shit man, young rich nigga shit
Hold up)

[Bridge: Quavo]
Hundred bad juugs young nigga had to snatch it
Young rich nigga made a milly off of trappin'
Young nigga playing with Mariah like Nick Cannon
All my goons young, I know I'm a money savage

[Hook: Quavo]
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga young nigga young nigga
Young nigga I stay with the pistol
I hang with drug dealers, gorillas, and killas
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga young nigga young nigga
Young nigga I stay with the pistol
I hang with drug dealers, gorillas, and killas

[Verse 1: Que]
Young rich nigga made a milly off swipin' (hey)
Seen it come and go, like a motherfucking psychic
Brand new chopper with the beam, no license
Try to steal my cash, that bitch gone bite like Mike Tyson
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga young nigga young nigga
I stay with the pistols and I hang with drug dealers
Gorillas, pill flippers and killas
I chill in the slum, concede with my plug
I made a mill using my skillet
Get lean by the tub, I'll show you some love
You cop some and get a free pigeon

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Young nigga, young nigga
I laugh to the bank, I'm Tigga
Come try me I'll pop that pistol
I promise nobody won't miss you
Tell 'em cut the check with no scissors
I keep Keyshia Cole in my swisher
I've been counting money so damn long
That all my fingers got blisters
My young nigga straight illin'
That chopper ain't got no feelings
One phone call, they go ape shit
That banana clip start peelin'
They sick, they stop on your block and let off
Then dip, that's it
My young niggas know how to ball
And get rich
With a trip, getting trippy
Nigga nineteen sittin' on a milly
Young nigga won't pass on a penny
If it's out here nigga, let's get it
All these change niggas know we stuntin'
If your fam ain't eatin' then it don't mean nothin'
Got goons on deck niggas think we bluffin'
Like Durex condoms, bitch we bustin'

[Hook: Quavo ]

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
Young nigga getting head while the engine running
Ten swishers, I'm burning, I'm getting blunted
Yeah so say what you say and feel what you like but a nigga is paid
She see what she like and I know why she came
I give her that pipe, she be dizzy for days
Wow, she got amnesia
But I don't remember her eitha'
Niggas be swearing they seen me
But to get where I'm at you need a Visa
Uh, in a two seater
Black and white Beamer
Look like a zebra
Man I'm so sick, I'ma need anesthesia
You wanna feature, you gone need Jesus
To get your G's up, uhhh
85,000 people fill the arena
Give 'em a seizure
Running through green like I'm a receiver
With a bad bitch that look like Serena
I swear to God you should've seen her
Bobby Ray bands, you know what it is
You know my demeanor (ayy)

[Hook: Quavo]
