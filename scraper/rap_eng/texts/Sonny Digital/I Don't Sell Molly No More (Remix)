[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
I Got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean
(x2)

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
OG pimping, trench coat mobbing
Money keep flowing from lil biddy to bompton
West coast Makonnen, the best thing going
They really like my movies is the best thing showing
Boss hard playing, competition slaying
Sell the whole pack then relax before the day end
Making hella moolah give a damn about your joolah
Shouts out west Baltimore and free young moolah

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I got the shit that make Craig fight debo
California weed smoke
Mobbin' with my ATL niggas
Brought a pound if it's green
Closet full of Supremes
Still hit American Deli for the wings
I turn Gin & Juice dreams to the big screen
The kid from the 'burg doing big things
Not to mention all of my niggas on, on they own bus
Smokin' to the head, we all there
Everybody growin' dreads

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]

[Verse 3: ILoveMakonnen]
Haters can't see us, Nish or Taniya
We be in L.A. posting like the coliseum
Big smoking, PCH coasting
Sherantino Hotel pent house toasting
When Straw-ber-ita dreams turn to champagne reality
Old friend been down since New Life Academy
Now we bound to the dope and all it make sense
On our own homes we ain't gotta pay rent

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen x4]
