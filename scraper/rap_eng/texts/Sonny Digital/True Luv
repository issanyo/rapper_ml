[Verse 1]
Fully automatic fifty round clip I really got one
A lot of women out here perfect wife material
But I hate to let you down she is not one
She's mine she's yours she's all of ours, No
She's not mine or your's she's everybody's
You should know, yeah

[Hook]
You might love her but she loves everybody
She don't love you nigga she love everybody
You might love her but she loves everybody
And if she says she love you that ain't true love
It ain't true love, It ain't true
And I don't want fool's love
Don't wanna boo love with you
If she say she love you nigga it ain't true love it ain't true

[Verse 2]
I know she said you was the only one
I wonder how many niggas was the only one (x2)
You go to church on sunday you supposed to be the holy one
You gassed up nigga you gassed up
I never let a bitch gas my head up I know better
Match some, Babygirl match some
I know you got a nigga i swear i can treat you so better
You heard that imma dog to the heart that's right so what
Baby it don't matter I can get you so wetter
Soul snatcher, true villian, don't do no header's
Take you from your nigga
Send your ass back with cold sweaters, ahhh
My momma told me not to trust you hoes at all
Cause that'll be the year that a young nigga gotta talk a fall
I told you not to fall in love with me bitch
This ain't what you wan't
Told you not to mother fuckin do it lil bitch

[Hook]
You might love her but she loves everybody
She don't love you nigga she love everybody
You might love her but she loves everybody
And if she says she love you that ain't true love
It ain't true love, It ain't true
And I don't want fool's love
Don't wanna boo love with you
If she say she love you nigga it ain't true love it ain't true

[Bridge]
Fuck it, naa forreal fuck it, I can't believe you gave up on me
Like i'm average, (x2)
Can't believe you gave up on me like a regular nigga
Like we ain't spend time together
Can't believe you
I don't love that bitch, i thought that I loved that bitch
I don't want that bitch but i want that bitch
I just wanna hug that bitch
Na fuck it i don't wanna touch that bitch
Don't you ever tell that bitch that you love her
Don't you ever let a hoe meet you mother
I got too many hoes to be stressing
I got too many thot's to be stressing
I hit these hoes and i cross em off my checklist
Thought she loved you boy she ain't love you
She loved me and my man too
You was never real (female talking)

[Hook]
You might love her but she loves everybody
She don't love you nigga she love everybody
You might love her but she loves everybody
And if she says she love you that ain't true love
It ain't true love, It ain't true
And I don't want fool's love
Don't wanna boo love with you
If she say she love you nigga it ain't true love it ain't true

[Ending]
You promised me you would never change (x3)
But you changed , bitch you changed up
You promised me you would never change (x3)
But you changed , bitch you changed up
