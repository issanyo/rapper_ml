Sell their soul for that gold

[Verse 2]
Owning this shit like I'm oprah
Word round the city you loco
Banging your bitch like I'm Sosa (bang)
Stand the ground high like I'm supposed to
Stay in your lane or get over
Put the little bitch in a rover
Put that little bitch on the game
Teach that little bitch how to zone
I might just fly her to Cali
Bust her ass out in the Valley
I might just buy me a Grammy
Cause they won't give me a Grammy
I put this shit on my granny
I do not fuck with them Xannies
Only gon' fuck with the reggies
Only gon' fuck with them stackies
