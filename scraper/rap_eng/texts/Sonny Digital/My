[Intro]
Super Future
Sonny Digital
Ay we’ll never be global nigga


[Hook]
My wrist on a forty
Fresh in Michael Jordans
My car ain't even drop yet
Already don' ordered it
Came across a fortune
Now I got endorsements
You wanna see a movie
You can press record then
My bank roll enormous
And my girl is gorgeous
Hit it with the forklift
Pull up in them Porsches
My chain is the stoplight
And I'm sitting on Forgi's
Tricking ain't a habit
If you can afford it

[Verse 1]
My shoe game is a thousand
What the fuck you doing?
Hit it with the aviators
Ain't no way you losing
Codeine in my styrofoam
Leaning like a motorcycle
Order me a Bentley
And its coming with the title
Dolce and Gabbana
Hermes and Dior
I'm dressed so exclusive
This not in your stores
Fresh as Michael Jordan
I think I can fly nigga
Drinking me some dirty
Have you checked my background?
Audemars Piguet
Presidential Rollie
I might wear that Hublot
And its fully loaded
My bank roll a building
Up there with the millions
I'm not your average star
I'm no regular civilian

[Hook]
My wrist on a forty
Fresh in Michael Jordans
My car ain't even drop yet
Already don' ordered it
Came across a fortune
Now I got endorsements
You wanna see a movie
You can press record then
My bank roll enormous
And my girl is gorgeous
Hit it with the forklift
Pull up in them Porsches
My chain is the stoplight
And I'm sitting on Forgi's
Tricking ain't a habit
If you can afford it

[Verse 2]
My VVS my necklace
Glistening like some crystals
I got on my jewellery
Think I ain't got that pistol
Pocket full of Franklin's
Stuffed in my Versace’s
Lean inside my cup
And I put ice inside my watches
Ordered up that new coupé
I just left the dealer
Ballin' like I shoot hoops
Michael Jordan my nigga
ESPN and Showtime
Want to see my highlights?
Future is a rock star
And I live that high life
Bottles in my section
Didn’t you seen them sparkles
Shawty in Giuseppe's
Ain't that girl a model?
Splurging is a hobby
Money not a problem
Yes I am a rich nigga
Came straight from the bottom

[Hook]
My wrist on a forty
Fresh in Michael Jordans
My car ain't even drop yet
Already don' ordered it
Came across a fortune
Now I got endorsements
You wanna see a movie
You can press record then
My bank roll enormous
And my girl is gorgeous
Hit it with the forklift
Pull up in them Porsches
My chain is the stoplight
And I'm sitting on Forgi's
Tricking ain't a habit
If you can afford it
