[Hook]
I said look baby I'm sorry (I told you that I'm sorry)
Shawty I can't be your Drake (I can't be your Drake)
I'm not that emotional (I never been emotional)
[?] I don't wear no cape (I never wore a cape)
I said shawty I'm sorry (I told you that I'm sorry)
Baby I can't be your man (I can't be your man)
I'm really not a [?] (I never been a [?])
I hope you understand (I know you understand)

[Verse 1]
Now some of you pussy ass niggas got a lot of these dumb hoes thinking that they wifey type
If a nigga say [?] that don't really mean [?] popping he just wanna see if you fucking right
Suck a dick with no hands do a couple handstands now you running round bitch like you a prototype
Never say we go together you just one girl that I like
Baby I don't need your number we just fucking for the night

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shout out my nigga Drake
That's my nigga [?]
But don't compare me bitch I'll never be that nigga ho
I cannot love a bitch
I can't convert a ho
What she can do is fuck in my convertible
While you shaking and [?]
I'm getting head while I'm driving
I pull up getting noggin
She sucking and swallowing
I'm watching her smiling
She's seeing me styling
Call me solid girl
My dressing's italian

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She her booty shake like jelly
Skin soft as butter
She's a nasty motherfucker
[?]
I would never love her
Let a nigga cuff her
I woke up in the morning getting head off the covers
I didn't pay for shit
Cause I am not a trip
On somebody bitch you ought a be paying his dick
But instead I just gave the bitch a bust down
And smoke a 7 with her call that shit a touchdown
