[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Squad, squad, squad
Give a fuck about shit but my motherfucking niggas
Click full of pits, orangutans and gorillas
Run up if you want, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
Itchy trigger finger, keep my hand on the pistol
Fight, fight, nigga, shoot something

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Doing too much, standing too close
Talking too loud, nigga, night night
One hitter quitter, flatline, nigga
Turned this bitch to a motherfucking fight night
Try it in the club, ride in the club
Man down 'cause there's shots fired in the club
Fighting over here, shooting over there
Bitches pulling hair, niggas throwing chairs
All my niggas head first, nosedive
Flexing in my own lane, roadside
Nigga .23 is back, .45
On my bullshit, wreck crew, don't try it
Bitch, I'm going cannon
Free my nigga Cannon
Nigga run up wrong, leave him laying where he's standing
It's Mr. Two Cups, I give two fucks
If you ain't scared, why the fuck you got your jewels tucked?
Dunk

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Squad, squad, squad
Give a fuck about shit but my motherfucking niggas
Click full of pits, orangutans and gorillas
Run up if you want, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
Itchy trigger finger, keep my hand on the pistol
Fight, fight, nigga, shoot something

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
You either with me or against me now, cool or on my hitlist now
Keep my circle tight 'cause most these niggas bitches now
Wrong one to play with, go on 'head and try me
One shot, split a nigga's shit like a Siamese
Ambulance picked him up, I'm shooting at the siren
Flatline a nigga, then go home and blow some Irene
MapQuest, yeah, I know where you live and where your kids nap
Fuck around with Slim Dunkin, D-Bo get you kidnapped

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Squad, squad, squad
Give a fuck about shit but my motherfucking niggas
Click full of pits, orangutans and gorillas
Run up if you want, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
Itchy trigger finger, keep my hand on the pistol
Fight, fight, nigga, shoot something

[Verse 3: Wooh da Kid]
Who wants some? He wants some?
I ain't really come to fight, I'm trying to fuck something
I ain't really try to hit, I'ma bust something
First nigga act up, I'ma rush something
Pull a midget out the bag, smoke something
One swing, all swing, jump something
Wooh da Kid my name, want something?
Still trying to be a player, crush something
Hold on, Wooh da King, I am the best
His flow stuck in one spot, it's on house arrest
Paralyzed punch when I'm at my best
Have your ass singing through a wire like Kanye West

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Squad, squad, squad
Give a fuck about shit but my motherfucking niggas
Click full of pits, orangutans and gorillas
Run up if you want, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
Itchy trigger finger, keep my hand on the pistol
Fight, fight, nigga, shoot something

[Verse 4: Lil Capp]
I gives a fuck about shit but my motherfucking niggas
Money ain't the issue, fuck with us, they gon' miss you
Shoot your block up, light it up like Christmas
Now your homeboy pouring out their damn liquor
Slim and Wooh, them my dogs, fuck with them, I'll Mike Vick you
It's all bite, no bark, I hope you get the picture
We could shoot something, we could fight, nigga
It don't matter, we could do it all night, nigga
'Round here, we smash on site, nigga
Shooters on the roof, fuck around and get sniped, nigga

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Squad, squad, squad
Give a fuck about shit but my motherfucking niggas
Click full of pits, orangutans and gorillas
Run up if you want, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
Itchy trigger finger, keep my hand on the pistol
Fight, fight, nigga, shoot something
