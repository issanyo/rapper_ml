[Intro: Juicy J]
Free Guwop!
Your boy Juicy J

[Hook: Que & Juicy J]
I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed (What’s up Que?)
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head (Sonny Digital)
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
I'm still a dawg, still dawg just like Gucci said

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I’m a dawg like Gucci
My ex ho is bougie
Push that bitch out my Phantom and I kept it moving
Nigga, don't you try me
My driver's a shooter
And you ain't no goon
'Til you get behind a computer
Ain't no secret, shit, everyone know I'm the plug
Smoking on a joint so big
Like a dead body rolled in a rug
I be with Que in the A
Shittin’ on niggas at Onyx
If I blow a bag then he blow a bag
That’s 500 thousand deposits
I’m pouring up
Purple [?]
She ride my dick
Just like it’s a Harley
I don’t feel sorry for niggas
You can’t get this money just liking pictures
You all in my comments
I’m out on the road with ‘bout 30 bitches

[Hook: Que]
I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
I'm still a dawg, still dawg just like Gucci said

[Verse 2: Que]
I’m a dawg, my pet barking
New Chanel, no Charles Barkley
Even if she bad and a Barbie
I’ll still put the bitch on Maury
Still faded like a Boosie haircut
Beside the main bitch finna square up
Dog nigga like my name is Air Bud
You know it’s a hit when Sonny doing the snare drum
Bunch of bitches like I’m Stevie J
Hitting these bitches with the Stevie face
Want Karrueche top, Blac Chyna box
And would love to get a piece of [?]
Riding ‘round with the carbon now
Bad hoes in my starting five
She gon’ go and fuck a starter now
Bitch don’t get pushed out the carter now
Me and money still married though
Few rings on like Larry Holmes
Fucked your bitch just like a dog nigga
Left my drawers and my hair in bone
Quick to tell a bitch to shut the fuck up like I’m Juicy
I’m still his dog nigga, still a dog like the Gucci

[Hook: Que]
I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
I'm still a dawg, still dawg just like Gucci said
I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
I'm still a dawg, still dawg just like Gucci said
