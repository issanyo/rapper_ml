[Intro: Kodak Black]
It's like, I don't even got no self control no more
(Sonny Digital)
I be tryna keep it gangsta and shit but you know
You be having me on that sweet shit

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
You got my heart, got my mind
I think about you all the time
You shoot my blood pressure through the sky
If you leave my side I swear I'll die
Girl you got me I don't need nobody
I'm in love with you and just yo body
And I hope we never separate
I wonder do you feel the same

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Girl you got me now don't look no more
I'm all yours only if you want me to
And there ain't no pressure I ain't no rushin' nigga
But bae I got a lotta feelings for you
I got different stashes dog I love them routes
But I got all this money in my CD account
You see I'm gettin' all the cheese like Mickey Mouse
Would you still be here if I'm goin' through a drought
You in and out bae what you about bae
Do you want my heart bae
Or you want my clout bae
You got my heart you got my soul you got my mental
I'm talkin' 'bout you even on the instrumental

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
You got my heart, got my mind
I think about you all the time
You shoot my blood pressure through the sky
If you leave my side I swear I'll die
Bae you got me I don't need nobody
I'm in love with you and just yo body
And I hope we never separate
I wonder do you feel the same

[Verse 2: Plies]
You know I love you babe i'll help you take your weave out
You know I'm fucked up about you sitting around your people house
If I was Kodak right now baby I would sing to you
I don't even like to kiss but i'll be kissing you
I could smell you on my sheets, it got me missing you
You ain't no ps4 or NES so I won't play with you
I don't even like to cuddle but I'll be all under you
I know this shit getting very real cause I'll be claiming you
I had a dream you fucked around and put my name on you
I was ashamed of my last bitch but I ain't ashamed of you
I ain't a bond baby I hope we never separate
When you ain't around to hold around I keep a poker face
I love looking at you that's why I got you as my screensaver
Sometimes I don't know why you stay around 'cause I'm so complicated
You my red velvet babe I want a slice of you
And I can see myself spendin' my whole life with you

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
You got my heart, you got my mind
I think about you all the time
You shoot my blood pressure through the sky
If you leave my side I swear I'll die
Bae you got me I don't need nobody
I'm in love with you and just yo body
And I hope we never separate
I wonder do you feel the same
