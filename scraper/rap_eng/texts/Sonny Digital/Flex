Well it's the same old, same old, of this info
Got a side bitch and I got me a main ho
Addicted to the bank roll, yeah that bank roll
Count my money right cause that's just what I came for
Cause all I do is flex, all I do is flex
I'm countin' paper daily, it feel just as good as sex
Cause all I do is flex, all I do is flex
Them niggas they be hatin' cause I'm runnin' through checks

[Verse 1]
Ok, I'm tired of havin' sex, just bring me my check
I'm thumbin' throught he money, just make sure that it's correct
Tryna short me on some paper, I hope you brought you a vest
Keep my nine, when I slide, that's one thing I won't forget
Got my twenty minute spread, I use a chick just for her neck
Catch it all and you better not spit, better not bite baby girl, just lick
Runnin' out of time, better make this quick, shorty there mean when she suckin' that dick
Tell her slow down and she might catch a fit, sippin' on the white while she gobble that shit
Back to the money like I never left that, see me in the Phantom never did the Maybach
Keep a hundred grand in the black Lou bag, black .45 right up underneath that
Got a couple bad bitches, let her teabag
24 show, nigga run and tell that
Blow a couple bands and I run it back
Fuck a nigga mad, nigga straight like that

[Verse 2]
Okay now, Rose, pop that open, pockets stay all swollen
Walk in with that blocka, ain't no tellin' what I'm holdin'
Got Ermands on my waist line, Phantom in the day time
Catch me out at night I'm in that drop and the top on lay-down
See a bad bitch, I'm like "hey, hey now", big money make a bad bitch stay 'round
Real money don't belong in the playground, real niggas that's who I be 'round
Nigga all I do is flex, all I do is flex
Got a bad lil momma, wanna fuck, I show my dawg the text
Got the Rolley on my wrist, hundred on my neck
You can call me crazy but you can't call me collect
Cause I do this as a hobby, I'm paid, no "if's" or "probably's"
I'm the shit like a nigga done pottied, white girls and they all on mollies
