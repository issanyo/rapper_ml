[Hook: Finding Novyon]
They been sleepin', I been buzzin' like alarm clocks
I been saucin' with that heat, just call me hot sauce
That's why everybody fuck with me the long way
My hood show love and mad affection for me always
I can't lose, I can't lose
I make moves, she came through
I can't lose, I can't lose
I can't lose, I can't lose

[Verse 1: Finding Novyon]
I just sipped that juice now can’t nobody tell me nothing
I just took a dream and then I turned it into something
Made a vision for the team, now we after millions
Had to cut her from the team, get up out your feelings
Never had to sell no pills, or had to sell no pussy ever for the profit
I be killing all these rappers and these petty bitches nigga I demolish
I don’t got nothing to prove
Big steps in my shoes
Please give me something to do
I been paying my dues

[Hook: Finding Novyon]
They been sleepin', I been buzzin' like alarm clocks
I been saucin' with that heat, just call me hot sauce
That's why everybody fuck with me the long way
My hood show love and mad affection for me always
I can't lose, I can't lose
I make moves, she came through
I can't lose, I can't lose
I can't lose, I can't lose

[Verse 2: Jace]
No I cannot lose, I think I’m Golden State
I can’t lose shit, my pockets overweight
They see me, they like OMG, there goes winnin’ Jace
And if this was a winning race, I think I’d be winning, aye
Undefeated Floyd, coming for the boy
Messing with the kid, man that ain’t the biz
Tell ‘em what it is, tell ‘em what it isn’t
Péle how I kick it, goin’ for the goal
Goin’ for the gold, I’m in the Olympics
Second place is for the bitches
And that ain’t me my nigga
So you know how I get it

[Hook: Finding Novyon]
They been sleepin', I been buzzin' like alarm clocks
I been saucin' with that heat, just call me hot sauce
That's why everybody fuck with me the long way
My hood show love and mad affection for me always
I can't lose, I can't lose
I make moves, she came through
I can't lose, I can't lose
I can't lose, I can't lose

[Verse 3: Curtis Williams]
Counting up while I’m ashing on all these hating niggas
Bad bitches, good weed, that’s what this paper getcha
They talk a lot ‘til they see us out
Them niggas that was doubting, bet they see us now
No grams, boy I need a pound
Roll another while I plot on getting paid
I bet they talking real if they mentioning Danco James
And I ain’t got shit to prove
I told my niggas that I got ‘em
And I promise that we wouldn’t lose

[Hook: Finding Novyon]
They been sleepin', I been buzzin' like alarm clocks
I been saucin' with that heat, just call me hot sauce
That's why everybody fuck with me the long way
My hood show love and mad affection for me always
I can't lose, I can't lose
I make moves, she came through
I can't lose, I can't lose
I can't lose, I can't lose
