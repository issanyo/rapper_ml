[Verse: Polo Tha God]

Let me talk my shit for a minute
Y'all got the game confused
Tryna down play me n they know I'm big
That's what a lame a do
Bitch I'm, Holy Water Lo
Holy Father, y'all done started sum now
Talkin' bout facts, talkin' bout stats, niggas better calm down
Pioneer shit, cop the Balmains 'fo they knew what it was
But its cool homie, big screws on me, clocking overtime nigga what
Walkin' thru other niggas hood
Had em shook...  it was only me
Fuckin' ya dream hoe, like Thugga say "they notice me"
Motherfuckers call me when it's beef time
I get the first call
Come through for gang'nem each time
I take the first fall
Bitch quit lying, like Lo wasn't fuckin up commas
Wrist cold like a motherfuckin' tundra
Bitch check my, check my

[Hook]

My nigga numbers don't lie

[Verse]

I fronted niggas O's, half O's, clothes
You know you owe Lo, movin' niggas P's
Front it. So thats POLO, movin' dolo
We ain't goin', nosotros? No
What the fuck you sayin' to me?
You could never fuck wit me
I'm the coldest out the culdesac
They never been up on a colder sack
They never seen how the cold react
When I'm hot, sizzle, no 808
Mafia
They like Lo ain't no stopping ya
Sights on me like binoculars
I like Bape n Versace but
Too many motherfuckers rockin' it
Don't follow trends, make it popular
Blonde bitch came late wit the pictures
Like damn lil' baby u missed it
Gotta be quicker that
Especially to find me, out west 290
Hustle hard, get up on my knees then worship god
I'm a sinner, I was born in it, but I'm winnin'
Check my

[Hook]

Check my numbers
Check my stats
I got numbers up on you

Look at the scoreboard
