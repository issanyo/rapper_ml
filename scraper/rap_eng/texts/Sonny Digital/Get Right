[Intro: B.o.B]
Man, I'm 'bout to get right
Man, I'm 'bout to get right
Trip, trip, dead light

[Hook: Mike Fresh] x8
Everybody, get right
I'm 'bout to get right

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, J, I'm 'bout to get right
Yeah I'm 'bout to twist off, I'm 'bout to lift off, I'm 'bout to take flight
Flyin' with the brakes off so don't blow my buzz and don't kill my vibe
And you ask me is this the way I feel or is it still just a high
(is it still just a high)
There goes my imagination again
There goes my thoughts, away with the wind
There's no medication amazing as this
Your favorite fragrance, your favorite spliff
As real as they come, for niggas like us
Where days where the fakers get fake as they get
We take us a hit
We just be coolin', you lookin' anxious as shit
I know they see me, doin' my thang
I go too many places to trip
This shit I'm on, this shit so strong
You could take 20 vacations per hit
Man, ain't nobody as faded as this
Man, ain't no life as outrageous as this
And I would pull out my resume
But it's too many pages to flip

[Verse 2: Mike Fresh]
Everybody's got that vice
Everybody need what they need to get right
I won't judge you, so don't judge me
When you see me cranberry moonwalkin' my Sprite, all right
Fuckin' with Fresco, you smokin' the best dope
You been workin' all day, it's time to let go
So what, we high? So what, we drunk?
And if we run out, it's nothin' to get more
Livin' my life one day at a time
Tryna get right one play at a time
You never can predict what I'm gonna do next, No Genre
I ain't finna stay off in a line
If I had it my way, I'd ball everyday
Hit the mall everyday
Go through 100K, and put it all in the safe
What the hell are celebrations for?
Drinkin' moonshine out a mason jar
Patron margaritas, pretty señoritas
Bringing me everything I need like, "Si Señor"
You could pull up to the kick back
But you better have a six pack or somethin'
You don't wanna be the one empty handed
When everybody ask, "Where the liq at?"
Get right
