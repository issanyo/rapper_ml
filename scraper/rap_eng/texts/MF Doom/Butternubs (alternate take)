Aggressive, passive-depressive, I go hard with a massive erection/
Now my dick becomes the toy of a perky-titted kitten/
I let her have a taste as long as it's not bitten..../
Ouch!/ she got too excited, toothrub on the tip made me
Fuck up while I'm writing/ lyrics that cringe craniums when entering the earlobe
And will heighten your senses when booming from the stereo and
Light your eyes up like a spliff in the darkness, chosen to win like Sora
Against the heartless/ uh, cozy and restless from battling the stress
Of many potential EXs", one swing and off go their heads, but really the hardest part
Is the location of where they rest/ chaotic, unstable and psychotic; I go commando in
Sweatpants and tank top, the neighborhood girlies likin' how the sweaty nuts pop/
Slide the pipe in a sweet thick shawty, once you go cozy, you'll never be lonely
Not being over confident it's all this "testosteronie" girl/ as I look in your immaculate eyes
You can be the chieftess of my tribe cause honey check it out you got me mesmerized, with your black
Hair and those phat-ass thighs/ barbie girls with no brains get the blind eyes
But my dick doesn't discriminate like a goth wearing tie-die/
A good body and a good personality can both get you a night with the swank dick daddy
So bend that ass over let me beat them patties, she didn't believe, she screamin' to the pillow that it hurts now/
Sling shit like politicians that throw dirt that's monkey business it's all in a niggas days work to
Be a jerk and rock the mic till it melts from all this acid that spilled from my lips and the gasses leaving the stands faceless/
I can't get paid cause my managers arms and legs are misplaced, eyes falling out his sockets i got no time to waste/
Imbeciles categorize tryna' put a nomad in his place, I'm an artist, fuck rap genres are only constraints/
I been in the game, less than 365 days, give me a year I'll have this whole fucking city in wastes/

Cozy
