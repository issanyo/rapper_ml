[Chorus]
World Domination (Nation), You better tune into my station
And if you didn't know, I got a wild imagination
Domination (Nation), you better tune into my station
And if you didn't know, I got that best investigation

[Verse 1]
World Domination, got more fire tunes than a station
Spit your four bars with your so-called rap nation
Nope, I'm not 21, but hang around them Haitians
And if you wanna spit some bars you gotta master patience

[Verse 2]
And if you wanna spit more heat
Like fire verses in this beat
You gotta tune into my station
It's World Domination

[Chorus]
World Domination (Nation), You better tune into my station
And if you didn't know, I got a wild imagination
Domination (Nation), you better tune into my station
And if you didn't know, I got that best investigation

[Verse 3]
So you sneak diss on one
You use mouth instead of tongue
And it doesn't end here, I mean it only just begun
It's like a nuisance
You a peasant, a sibling, I'm a Prince
Don't step up to me or don't try to be hard
You only do that to yourself, you can't even spell retard
This the final 8, so I'll allow to end it here
I add one more line just to say back off you whack bearded musketeer

[Chorus]
World Domination (Nation), You better tune into my station
And if you didn't know, I got a wild imagination
Domination (Nation), you better tune into my station
And if you didn't know, I got that best investigation

[Verse 4]
World Domination
It's a good mix, a combination
24 degrees, rhymes hotter than a population
5 Great Nations
It's better than that thing with vegetation
Final verse, come back with the fire
Put it on Empire
Promote this rap like Eminem with pliers
And if you didn't know, this going big and live on the maker
It's bigger than your house of wood and come without the paper!
