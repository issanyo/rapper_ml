Cruising in my conscience
Should've said, cruising for conches
Now this killer flow flows wetter than unidentified dead veterans
Wordplay got me feeling like I'm older than a Letterman
Let him out
Let him spill his soul/fears to the fucking globe
How you finna level up
If your thoughts ain't evolvin' from the coffin
That these niggas try to put 'em in
I see it as games, but my homie might shotput a man
Rustle your crew
Leave 'em restless and peaceless
Ironic cause when I'm through
All they'll do is rest in pieces
College bound and this poetry's my thesis
I hope my English teacher loves my Aposio-...
*Mmm*
Turned my herbal visions to verbal incisions
And that's word to every decision that I made since a nigga spliffed it
Spiffly spliffing with my dogs
And we simply kicking
Causin' up a scene like one of us got evicted
Listen with precision to my double entendres
Swear to God I lyrically spit that shit you cannot conquer
Brooklyn nigga, 'til the day I go bonkers
Indie rapper, not trying to get sponsored by monsters
Look, one in a million make it on your type of mission
But I believe I'm a natural by selection
So overtime adapted and grew resistant to the negative slurs in words belittled by bigots
Who think that rap's the reason why dudes get lazy and ignant, huh?
Well nigga please
But a little push is what is needed, guarantee it
Homie hold your ground and I promise you'll never feel defeated
They only shoot down your dream when they feel its something worth reaching

Said imma rep I mean rap my vision, everything I believe in
'Til I'm hotter than June when it gets a little impatient and gives us all a little taste of a lot of its summer season
You know, a little something to believe in
Won't rap about hoes and clothes
Fabrication not my style
Don't go spit behind a mask if you ain't Danny Dumile
