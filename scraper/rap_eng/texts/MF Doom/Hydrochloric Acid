Keep your mind on your mask, kid
Holler for my classics, it's drastic
Villain the hydrochloric acid, splashed it
Pull the Nine, reached then he blasted, Pow!
Pin stripes on a basket
New York style wild
Cheddar grab easy
It's only entertainment though, when thought out completely
Sad demeanor, could get him the drop and bag cleaner
Master schemer
Expert in that arena
Puffin' Pasadena
You read the grass was greener
Black beamer
I8 she gyrate
Rubbing shoulders with pigs don't fly straight
Just ate, causing indigestion
Will soon regurgitate, into profits, no question
Nosy agent sniffing around, pay attention
You could take that to the bank
"Thanks", don't mention
Pleasure's all mine, ain't mad at y'all
Clear advantage like playing paddle ball on adderall
Be brief, that is all
Aight, one more rhyme
Self-snitching rappers who's lines is pure pork rinds
It's yours, it's his, and mine
Your homework space cubical, smirk face crucible
Super luminal, (???), loose pull
Need to re-roll that, he sold stat old hat
And Dungarees, new shoes for baby
Food, clothing and shelter, no if ands or maybes
Maintain the gravy train, laid claims of slavery
Bad investment banking, the best went blanking
Shitting, stanking
Witnessing the slang king, hypnotist ranking
And don't quit
Keep your mind on your mask, kid
Holler for my classics, it's drastic
DOOM, hydrochloric acid, splashed it
Pull the Nine, reached then blasted, Pow!
