[Intro]
Yeah
David Twist
1, 2, 1, 2
Show you what this do
Uh huh, uh huh
Yo, yo
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You know the way I come in, dope as a crack spoon
I beat the beat up, leave the eyes black, like raccoons
The bars cold, leave your nose running
The lil rappers think they’re nicer than me? They be bugging
Plus, you see my stats getting massive, like D. Freund
Any rapper wanting beef gets smoked like tenderloin
Ha, these local rappers mad cheap like Kmart
They begging that I don’t fuck up their careers like Gayheart
And my reputation got these clowns sweating for answers
I’m known to school a mumble rapper since they keep testing the standards
My technique like a tweak, going wild
Still a child, but I got bars for weeks with sleek style
They all acting now, mask on, like Jim Carrey
I see that shit, bro, I’m Wide Awake, Katy Perry
It’s a lotta youngins here, but I’m the best of the juniors
12 inches in this rap shit, call me the ruler

[Chorus]
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
‘Cause I’m the ruler of the studio, spittin’ all night
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
‘Cause I’m the ruler of the studio, spittin’ for life
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
‘Cause I’m the ruler of the studio, spittin’ all night
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
‘Cause I’m the ruler of the studio, spittin’ for life

[Verse 2]
I flow doper than a stream of base head blood vessels
While I pick whack rappers out the game like flower petals
I’m always taking shots and never miss, Steve Nash
The way that I deliver these hot rhymes be kinda like DoorDash
I got more metaphors than corpses on D-Day
While these bootleg rappers be fake as the products on eBay
David the realest on the mic, don’t get it twisted
Garbage rappers get crushed up and thrown away, like it’s Christmas
Truthfully, these mumble rappers broke, they make no (sense | cents)
While I’m writing hard bars with lead, my rhymes dense
I’m so violent when I spit, all these beats executed
They bleeding so much that all these crips start shooting
I’m always taking w’s, whiskey like jack
And my rhymes rocking through the schools like Jack Black
The underground’s finest, like a brand new sewer
But how I’m inching towards fame, shit, I must be a ruler

[Chorus]
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
‘Cause I’m the ruler of the studio, spittin’ all night
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
‘Cause I’m the ruler of the studio, spittin’ for life
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
‘Cause I’m the ruler of the studio, spittin’ all night
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
‘Cause I’m the ruler of the studio, spittin’ for life

[Outro]
Let it breathe
