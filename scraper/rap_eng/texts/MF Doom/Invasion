[Intro]
There they go the clown and the two thugs
See what you fuckers made me do?
Another five days huh?
Fuck

[Verse 1]
Oh my
Mama always said watch that black boy fly
Last week me and Pizzelle was burning old school ties
Got suspended in one year; you think that I'm the bad guy
Where you see other immortal's sparking magnums and knifes
Talking the same shit from yesterday say he's really going high
All these mags say that I'm num; the nigga that's bout to come
To blow everybody's house cause I compose like a drum
You march bands are invalid, this the fucking goofy ballad
Sushi salad with my uzi splattered, gooey gloomy traffic
That's made of plastic
For all you fucking forged gymnastics
Thinking your so damn elastic, cognate Mr Fantastic
Tax evasion is raising, got your fucking heart that's pacing
Cosmic drag racing underground stations, artillery is waiting
So beware of death by Kenny Phoenix in this invasion
YJ
Stash Squad Phoenix Gang nigga....
Fuck with me
Bitch


[Verse 2]
Yoo
It's Kenny Klux; representing Bracey Street
My ears starting to bleed so drop down on your knees you fucking creep
Parents think that I'm a role model that needs to lead kids
I rather eat special herbs and forbid to eat ribs
I rather get rushed by gangs who thought this record is dissing
I rather invite random people to watch and witness me Taylor Swifting
Then to tell ignorant pupils to behave themselves, but they'll never listen
So I'll poison food then in their mamas kitchen
(NEWS WEATHER FORCAST!!!!!!)
Good morning everyone, I hope you guys enjoy the sun
Cause tonight it's gonna be a rough one
Starting with an invasion
There's no calm weather for this week
Just horrendous sleet coming to a street near you
I ain't done yet this is just the afternoon schedule yo
Beware for the sandstorms, tornados and thunder snows
Typhoons, spooky cartoons and unnerving shocking puppet shows
Things will change during the midnight
So if your hungry tonight, be sure to get your umbrellas
They'll be lots of ice cream hails and raining cheeseburgers to fulfil your lonely appetite
Temperatures will be million deggress and a trillion Fahrenheit
So hold tight muthafuckers better run for your life
Cause I won't sacrifice my life so ugly bullies can laugh at my grave
Or become a new slave
Fuck D Sterling
I'll take a lot of pics then go to bed with her just to irritate you
She invite me to the game so I can fucking penetrate you
Stupid racist bitch broadcast you with my fucking fists
Then super slam dunk yo ass and let Solange finish this
Transform to Megatron flicking humans like its a home run
It's just a normal day in this fucking invasion

[Verse 3]
Lemar had a scar, just because of that T-Rex
Where's the thesaurus so I can get this muthafucking pet
(I left them here); then why the fuck I'm not seeing them
I told you in the meeting to look after them (sorry master)
The window is a book
I didn't watched the clown cause Captain Hook already got him in his crook
Jack Daniels said you want some fuel to make a pitch black cup
You should have saw the reaction when Captain Morgan fuck Zach up
Imagine me going to that fucking dump again
I rather get drunken fist; throat collapsed in the Namekian
Rock, Scissors 'N' Paper, palms striking your arms
Invasion still carry on
Don't even try call your mum you cunt
Knock you to the ground with a double axe handle
Now I'm really mad you bitch give me some muthafucking candles
I'm a muthafucking vandal
Take that Nokia that Dizzee took and snap it
Then turn this shit to a classic
Wait I got verse cursed; holy shit
Paralysed



[Outro]

RAPMAN: Doc, Doc here he comes again, what do we do?

TRACEY KRUGER: I'll tell you what were gonna do, first of all were gonna run from that ugly thing, then were gonna make one of his best friends girlfriend to call him, she's gonna dump him saying "OHHH I'M SORRY WE SUCK AT RELATIONSHIPS AND SHIT!!!!!" Or whatever so that I can mingle with her later, and we popping bottles for a celebration how's that feel lads?
