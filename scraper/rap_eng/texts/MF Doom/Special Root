[Inception]

Vice valley villains
Chilling while we thinking
To kill these little girls
Since I ain't really feeling em
Oh, then I say
Oh you're like the sun
Brining all the
Pain to me
When you come around
I hate my day
She told me
You're the perfect one
To just quit music
And keep on using dro
I told her
I will rock this microphone.. always

[Verse 1]

Fuck it
Kicking off my Adidas
Scribble out my halo
Watch my demons come forth from the screens
Solitary and I'm far from hitting jackpots in Vegas
Cop the pot and rotate in the stars
Cosmoses sentences giving ya mind some space
Painting up the basics of a mosaic industry
When you're rich in auras everything is the most important
Even when the world around starts crumbling
Grass fumbling
Doubling the light in my tunnel
Fire in the jungle
The night can't muzzles my trouble
I'm not colorful just burning with spite
Animal side going wild looking for the right appetite
Glass skies only seeing what's inside
Nothing ripe for me to slice
Nation wide we occupied
Thinking who could redo the typo
For all I know you could be blind throwing down twice gambling my life away
Don't trip on the ricochet by my wordplay
Rid your eyes of evil let your sight catalyze from my rhymes
Enlightening the blown out until I get a full count world wide

[Verse 2]

My mama told me to write a story before i die
Well here it is the shit that makes your hair stick up
The supply of a whip that only fits in my mind
Dipped into my third eye now they strict with it saying that I dream to big
No fast forward only rewinding in the worlds orders
Pause and try to find some help
Picked a pig quick to bring to home coming
Digged so deep I ended up choosing me
Weird how I can't find my self
No grip and the lust is still automatic
Love ain't happening
The double standard cinematic is channeled to nothing but static
My theory was to plug out. now I'm underground
Idiotic child raised around nothing but photographs and some kanye west
Mom meet me halfway there
Pop was the shot of the house I guess
No need to cry now I just move it to the side like italics
My balance always bold like over passes
Flow with some ink my gut
Spit on chords now I'll see who's about to hang up
