Third eye mascara running
Into the truth
Keep an ear pressed to the ground
So you hear those marching blues
(Window to the sole)
Over hills buffalo dance
Click to clack in one high heel shoe

But of course
You love it You love it
And you love it oh
And you love it
Love it
Oh

Dogs screaming babies are barking
And bulletproof
Lines wrapped around the block and I'm
Pressed up 'gainst you (Window to the sole)
Smash the glass I'm double parking
Laced with MJ's shoese

But of course
You love it You love it
And you love it oh
And you love it
Love it
Oh

Need a foot to earn an inch
When it was tied to you
Am I tripping?
Leaving footprints
When they're two for the price of one
A man's worth is given birth in his shoes
Shoes

Strap 'em up and leather's bound
Puss in boots pass it around
Crack the plastic feel the spike
Come in any color you like
Chopped and screwed rubber's worn
On the sweat farm
Politicize hypocrisy

But of course
You love it You love it
And you love it oh
And you love it
Love it
Oh
