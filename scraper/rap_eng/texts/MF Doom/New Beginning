[MF Doom]
Yo, yo
Bring in the big guns, weapons is ready
In the square shoot the heady reppin the yeti is ready
Bout time last train from Gun Hill, Dunn chill
Stay filled with exhiliration from one kill

[Scott Free]
Yo, rock for ? row don't tempt me
Smack the drum black, black rap Jack Dempsey
You get laced without a trace just for takin up space
Bill Bill the bombville you still catch a Gas Face
For real
