He wraps lads up, strapped up, in the back trunk
Pendulum swing lower every time you use a second up
Good luck, answer quick, before the curve hit's
Before it leaves you cut up and swimming with dirty porcelain
Took an advil, act fast, but mind still
Wrapped the body up, forgot the blood stains on the anvil
Out the back door, then peeled off like an orange
Heartless and broken, like screws lost from off that door hinge

Trap door! Come near, and get your head off
Trying to be a great like these other rappers, cough cough
Was just kidding, Twenty deep like we were moshpitting
Talk quick before the family sees that he went missing
Flash written, hash ridden, while I'm brashly spitting
The way he flows nice, got these other rapper's all conscience smitten
Did this track, hoping to make a good impression
Prepared for Brutus's and numerous friend secessions
Out and about looking for stuff to cause ruckus with
Presented to his face was some cash and a fourty fifth
Alarm! awoke, from laying soggy on the stuffed up couch
Now we out, face stuffed, then downed with some smelly stout

While i succeed, they plunge madly into deep depression
Stare in the mirror, see that good is what's least reflecting
Would push rivals off like Gene did at Devon
To get to the and have the game on lock, in our possession

We chokehoding these niggas
Gold bowls with these triggers
Old folks hate us, cause damage got them wasting figures
Fame not getting bigger, but skill held for ransom
The way he spit cold, bypasses that he's not handsome
Ninety girls all gone cause that one problem
Not good with looks, face, puzzled, so he can't solve em
Girl plus boy, then add hate a solvent
Now you see why his trouble mind revolving
