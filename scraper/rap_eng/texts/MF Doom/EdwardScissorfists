[Verse 1: Jay Diem]
Hey look I feel like EdwardScissorfists
Whack rapper killin' militant
Destroy belligerence, the illest nigga who ain't hit it big
I hit and quit these tracks pornography up in yo system its
That nigga heaven sent that kill tracks for the hell of it
Lifes a stage and I refuse to be an actor
They put me in the script and then killed off your favorite rapper
Sorry thats showbiz, and I know its not yo biz but I
Slept with the track and then I murdered it right after
Showed pictures to producers but was only met with laughter
But watch perceptions change when the grapevine start to chatter

[Break Down: Jay Diem]
About this poet, thats bound to be noticed
So take my vocals to your focals instead of these hood rodents
Niggas bite styles like cobras they venomous
Reptilian spitter minds shredding off of that ignorance
And they sweeter than licorice

[Jay Diem]
Homophones cause they all sound the same
I came to change the game like RuPauls vocal range
Ima probably be ridin' in the Range
Cause I burn tracks like curling irons on black dames
Lifes a "b" but she a vibrant thing
And if you treat her like a queen you get to watch her change
Complain about yours
Im tryna maintain mines(minds)
NY state of mind to be nastier than Nas in his prime
Climb the ladder of success
And Ima make it to the top
Cause you know, once I hit the first step I won't stop
Like Im AI
Every rapper seem to claim that they fly
But see Im EdwardScissorfists so get clipped like a canine
