[Intro]

Ariiteeeeee, shout out the nigga J-Yance
Yo before I start this joint off, though
Random disclaimer: this ain't about nobody in particular
So nobody should take offense. Just let that thing ride out
Aritteeeeee?

[Verse]

Never sweat it or regret it, move on and forget it
Music gets me high, got me feeling lightheaded
Tight with it, lines go over your head
Not talking about leaving when I say a got a jet
That's an F-18, I can fly you out the states
So baby, can I bust like the guy that battled Cool J
In 98? I meant to say bust a rhyme
Or whatever you want, you looking mighty fine
Act ridiculous if you get lascivious
But don't tell anybody if we get intimate
She asked me, "Baby, why not?"
Why blow up my spot cuz we both got hot?
That's TNT and C4, they see me they want more
One me, I seen a thousand you's before
Everything you've said, I've already heard it
Don't ACT perfect, composite ain't a 36
Worthless, loose lips sink ships
And I'm like, "What a waste" like a chick with big hips
When I rap, she be biting her lips
She said she wanna nail me like the homie on the crucifix
I decline and get about my business
Then she says our heart are in sync like dishes
Says she wanna cuff me, she wanna be my misses
I say no, but then she smothers me with kisses
She's crazy, I ain't gonna reconsider
Ain't talking 'bout sex when I say I wanna hit her
I'm lying, I'm not really violent
But she's a groupie and shawty be wylin'
I don't wanna be mean or act ugly
I rather be in VIP, popping bubbly
Every day's a blessing, every day I'm lucky
I know I made it when Rosario hugs me
And I don't even mean disrespect
But sometimes you gotta keep these chicks in check
You think she's yours, but it's on to the next
Then she turn t-shirt and give the whole crew neck

[Outro]
Damn
Super, my man
Ariteee?
