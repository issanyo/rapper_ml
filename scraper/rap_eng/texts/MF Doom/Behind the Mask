[Verse One: Kayncee]
He walks around each day, like nothing can touch him
Even though he knows that life is coming to punch him
But nah he ain't scared, he ain't running, nah stuff it
Cause that's leave a fat dumb kid huffing and puffing
Hidden away all of his feelings behind that mask
No one can see the real him, if he's about to cry or laugh
Hide emotions from the world until he writes the bars
He's staying cold, metal mind cause life is hard
Painting pictures with his words like Picasso or Da Vinci
Many smudged with metaphors while he sketches some clearly
Until he sculpted the mask everyday he was crushed nearly
So he turned cold, bitter, detached, what a glum pity
Sixty seconds in and his head is now aching
Pent up with rage, need to vent his frustration
Trapped as his body still tries defending a station
That's lost in a war fated for the end devastation

[Hook: Kayncee]
Steady breathing, Behind the Mask
Maybe sleeping, Behind the Mask
You won't see him, Behind the Mask
You can not know the man who's Behind the Mask

[Verse Two: Kayncee]
So this kid has grown up apparently filled with intelligence
But he's of Indian decent so I guess that he's a terrorist
As he tears his wrist, hidden cause he cannot tell 'em this
So all of this causes him to be his own nemesis
Shelving it, these problems have stacked higher than Everest
What happened to the potential he had, blame him, he's wrecking it
It was all on the line, told us he'd give up never, it's
Seeming as if he'll be the dumbest bright kid who has ever lived
Been a few years, failed attempts, sleepless nights
Behind this mask he's numb cause dark eyes ain't seeing light
But on the outside he's fine, an actor faking feelings right?
They can't tell it ain't him, this is now his demon's life
And he hates it, this fake-ness, like a Kardashian naked
He's patiently waiting for a way of escaping
All the rage and the shaking swearing he's gonna make it
What happens if he doesn't and his life ends with him failing?

[Hook: Kayncee]
Steady breathing, Behind the Mask
Maybe sleeping, Behind the Mask
You won't see him, Behind the Mask
You can not know the man who's Behind the Mask
