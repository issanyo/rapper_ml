[Verse 1]
Yo, road to success
Running trough the red lights
Flat line flows, where these niggas know im dead nice
My future bright like DeLorean headlights
These niggas ain't fucking real, like a fleshlight
Uptown, Ace that, nigga NIKO
Step into the booth, then I go into beastmode
From Harlem world when niggas fucking spray shit
On the block with that white girl, like Taye Diggs
On the come up like planes on a runway
The shit I talk is gonna get me killed one day
Lyrical assasin, what I spit is like gunplay
God body flow this shit is holier than Sunday
I call women women, and call bitches bitches
You say there ain't, but there's a fucking big difference
So shout-out to the women doing shit on they own
And fuck you to you bitches only go for a bone
I'm in the zone like 2-3
This fucking beat is getting ripped like loose leaf
So bitch nigga, please don't push me
Shitting on these vets, and I'm still a fucking rookie
Some niggas throw the seas up, but others throw the bees up
Fuck red and blue, green's the only thing that please us
Rhymes can turn atheists to believe us
Murder shit, yolo, fuck I need, what a feature
Our lessons, my nigga Solo, my nigga Billz
We team homiciding the booth, my niggas kill
Silicone rappers find it hard to keep it real
We from NY so why the hell we saying thrill?
You already know what I'm rapping
Killing all these weak rappers no fucking exception
The rap game will get murdered to perfection
Heading to the top cause its the only direction
I'm pure ignorant, never on that country shit
If you want that country shit then go listen to common sense
With these niggas, nothing I have in common with
Cause the shit I spit is raw, like when the condom ripped
Acting tough you know you wouldn't break an egg nigga
Family got shit, you remind me of Meg nigga
Cause nobody really fuck with you
We here now, what the hell they gonna fucking do?
Ovalords all day and forever that
You think we wack? Nah, never that
That's why we don't fuck with you fuck niggas
OVA at the top it's only us nigga!
