Four Four in the morning

[Verse 1]
When death smiles in my face , then i smile right back
Imma young Brooklyn Nigga , I dont know how to act
Im so hungry for my shine i prolly rob Con Edison
Always spitten sick shit never needed no medicine
From the age of eleven remember robbin 7/11
Rackin up sins prolly never see heaven
ALways had a knack for making people disappear
And leaving all my love ones flooded in tears
Leaving ridiculous phony niggas exposed
Face never looked north so my heart turned cold
So my heart turned cold
Face never looked north so my heart turned cold
I see my future clear, clear as plastic
Protected from the shit that comes like prophylactics
Lifes about finding perfection in imperfect-ed
Thats why i show love to people who been neglected
Lifes about finding perfection in imperfect-ed
Thats why i show love to people who been neglected

[Verse 2]
Doing way better then motherfuckas expected
Cuff to the game yeah you know i got arrested
Schooling dumb fucks , yeah class is in session
Niggas doing wrong , Mr Write teaches lessons
Put my heart out, not to put less in
Maybe when i make painfull memories will lessen
Words like lethal weapon,like  Mel Gibson
Prefer to kill my beats through lethal injection
Dont fuck around hip - hop the profession
Gettin up there like a nigga went erection
We the best, No Dj Khalid
Yeah i want the green pockets filled with the salad
Not italian or french but look how im dressin
Got many people looking at my direction
Take each day like its a fucking blessing
Part of the new era dont question my progression
