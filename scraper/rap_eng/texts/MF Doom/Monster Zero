[Planet X Soldier]
The monster again, Zero!
[Controller of Planet X]
Monster Zero, command all units to take defensive position
[Planet X Soldier]
Yessir!
[K. Fuji]
What is Monster Zero?
[Controller of Planet X]
Monster Zero is the reason we cannot live on the surface
But must forever live underground, like this
[K. Fuji]
Oh, right
[Controller of Planet x]
I will show you... Monster Zero
[K. Fuji]
Hey, look!
[Glen Amer]
It's King Geedorah!
[Controller of Planet X]
Yes, indeed. On Earth, you gave this terrifying monster the name of "Geedorah"
Everything is numbered here; the monster is Zero. (King Geedorah roars)
[Woman]
Pay heed to my warning, the entire Human race will perish from the Earth
When the monster, Geedorah passes, only flaming ruins are left
[Man]
Geedorah, of course, that's why she had the pistol
[Woman]
What pistol?
[Man]
I - When I first met her, she was carrying a pistol in her purse
I asked her about it and she explained to me, and I believed her
[Planet X Alien]
And now you're convinced that we're from outer space?
[Glen Amer]
That's right. What do you have on your mind?
[Planet X Alien]
Peace terms
[Glen Amer]
Peace terms?
[Woman]
A nice idea
[Man]
It would be a bad situation if that creature came here to Earth
[Woman]
It's worse. He's arrived
[Man]
How could that possibly be, and why?
[Woman]
Is it.. is it alive? (Geedorah chirps) May I hold it? Oh, it's adorable. What is it?
[Man 2]
What is it? My lovely lady...
[Man]
It's Geedorah! Geedorah the space monster!
(Panic and commotion)
[Woman]
I think we should-
[Man]
Jesus Christ, shut up and listen! (Tuning radio)
[Radio Reporter]
It is very likely that one or more of you know this individual
Someone who's experienced working in a laboratory
With access to select biological agents
With the knowledge or expertise to produce a deadly product
Someone who's standoffish and works in isolation
A killer who may have used off hours in a laboratory to produce-
[Man]
Music, brother!
[Man 2]
You call that music?
[Man]
Yeah
[Man 2]
By the grace of Almighty, it sounds like god damn jungle warfare, I'll tell ya. Now let me get this straight, you stand out here selling-
[Peter Craig]
Trees. That just what they are: trees
[William Fletcher]
Where'd you find this?
[Peter Craig]
I told you, I've been looking around
[William Fletcher]
Where?
[Peter Craig]
I was gonna show it to you. As a matter of fact, I've been testing it. I just found out it was pure a little bit ago
[William Fletcher]
I underrated you, mister
[Doctor]
I do call myself an expert, but I'm sorry to tell you, I've never seen King Geedorah
[Man]
Not even on long side?
[Doctor]
On Lagus? I'm very sorry young man, but I can't waste time talking to you anymore
[Activist]
The people want to know, and they want to know now!
(Screaming and commotion)
[Man]
King Geedorah!
[TV Reporter]
Evacuate the streets! King Geedorah is in your area!
[Woman]
It's King Geedorah!
[Man]
King Geedorah!
[Man 2]
King Geedorah will destroy the whole country!
[Man]
But why? Why King Geedorah? (King Geedorah roars)
[Man 2]
He's not from the Earth
[Doctor]
What happened?
[Planet X Alien]
Geedorah is a space monster. I will get in touch with you when you feel like giving up
[TV Reporter]
Remain where you are
[Man]
King Ghidora!
