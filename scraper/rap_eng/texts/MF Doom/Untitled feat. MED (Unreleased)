[Verse 1: MF DOOM]

Yeah yeah, cheers
Chug a few of these hot beers
Mostly rep for my true thuggers who's not here
Physically, spiritually or mentally, even heathens
And right there was all still breathin' and eatin'
Manna brownies, hold the walnuts, extra ganja
All one or all none to quote professor Bronner
Doctor of hot mamas
Johnny on the spot, on dot, got honors, partner
Spit it on a CD like he did it on graffiti
Writ it like a Dear Jane letter gone Tahiti
Make it seem easy
It ain't, but sho fun though
With more sponsorship to rumble in the jumble
With tongue-fulls of lung flow
Every breath count
Foe like toes feeling very left out
Boy, imagine how the heel feel
Seal a deal
Santorini Black metallic with the alloy wheel
Supercharged by the time he get the rhyme wrote
Seen the future retired on an old time boat
With some rice, curry and a bowl of prime goat
Word, heard they stole a vote, hold up, hold my coat
Soldiers for hire, fire
They're full of more ear than you spare a good year tire
The hood is where
Ah, he, he gets his inspiration
Like nobodyâ€™s business
For your information

[Verse 2: M.E.D.]

Okay, k, chill
Pop a few of these chill bleeps
'till I feel smeared like the rope on the wind shield
M.E.D drill, spill another beer
Still on them heels like mom's had a free meal
More will and pill and dollar bills near
Still come in like the way the after [?] feel
Male straighter than [?] nail stainless
Can't blame a mom pregnant drinking Old English
Famous from [?] out speakers
Leave beavers stuck to the box like cheese pizza
Leave her, she ain't got a job neither
No-visa mom raised to Leave it to Beaver
The game need change like parking meter
[?] like fat man scoop [?]
Above is the Sci-Fi
Fly guy more dips than a side fry
Live wire watch RA. 455
Cook ramens like cold pie
FYI
