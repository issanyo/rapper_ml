[Sample: Let it snow cover (Unknown)]

(Dilla, Dilla) Dilla Mix (mix, mix)
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric that your bottom nick on somth' thick
Ick from the drumstick come with the dumb shtick
Sick slick, hidden in the book
The only way they find it is the spittin' n' the hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, keep talkin'
Hawkman stalkin' hon-o-wee (Hanoi? - disambiguation) hearken often
Cough into a coffin might as well scorch the pork then
He's like Warf, some say stronger though
Off the top Jay Strongbow, play along bro
Wear a mask, like yo off the Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For your info, when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
I act as if some nympho bimbo
Just playing Ray Jay, the old tape
Doin' well, what can I say, like J.J. in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain, and you won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy barb with the frogs with a dot on the guard as he squat on the log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work, half rock'd and half shape
My mistake, signed a track agreement
With more G's than lines than cracks in the cement
In any event, its fake like wrestlin'
Get 'em like Jake the Snake on mescaline (clears throat)
Elixir for the dry throat, tried to hit the high note, villain since a itsy-bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' emcees packed in with their feets draggin'
These stats is staggerin'
Had his PhD in in-the-street (industry) street hagglin' - villain
