[Intro - Christopher Hitchens]
Not Scorning The Tree Delightful Children Who Are Everything To Me and Who Are My Only Chance of Even a Glimpse of a Second Life, Let Alone an Immortal One, And I'll Tell You Something, If I Was Told to Sacrifice Them to Prove My Devotion to God, If I Was Told To Do What All Monotheists Are Told To Do and Admire the Man Who Said, "Yes, I'll GUT MY KID to Show My Love of God" I Would Say.. NO, FUCK YOU

[X-FLAME]
Spiritual Tests and Heartburn's
Life Is a School Ain't No Wrong Turns
In order to Know Truth You Gotta Choose The Right Terms
We Doomed To Fail But Hell is a Class With Lessons That You Must Learn
The Soul Must Earn Strips To Become God-Like
If You Ain't On The Cross You Ain't Christ
The Cross Meaning Being a 4 Way Being All Seeing
Overstanding Being All, Becoming One, Being Life
With Opposites and Duality, Ain't No Wrong and Right
Good and Evil are Equal Forces The Difference is Sight
Before Light Separated From Darkness There Was No Eye For Day and Night
The Gods Are Above That Cause They Have Spire Insight
To See From The Highest Perspective
A God is a Consciousnesses Collective
Channeling Forces of Different Energies
In Formation Forming Lifeforms With Psycho Genetic Memories
Spiritual Codes You Can't Read Without Psychic Abilities
Before The Satanic Matrix Speech
Communication Was Telepathy
Your Definition of Logic Is Insanity
We All Life In Human Form, There's No Humanity
Every Soul Has a Nature, At The Core We Closer to The Creator
Embracing The Bond and The Connection Makes the Spirit Greater
The Only Law is The Cosmic Law, There's No Other Law Maker
The Anti Nature is The Only Law Breaker
Life is a Giver.. Yeah.. Death is The Taker
Decode 010 and 101, My Point is Direct Like Laser
The 24th Letter Doing You a Favor, The Codes I Break Are Major
I Hide My Mathematical Equations Like Inmate Hiding a Sharp Razor
Its My Destiny To Go Through The Flames Eventually Like Rolling Papers
X is Inter Dimensional Not a Freak of Nature
Its Unquestionable If Spirits are Real
Ask The Rasta;s from Jamaica How It Feels
To Smoke Herbs and Speak to The Trees In the Forest
I Got The Keys like Horus, Left No Room for a Hook
Cause There's No Need to Repeat the Chorus
One is Deep The Other is Shallow, Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris
