[Verse 1:]
Money's the motivation
Count currencies on occasion
I'm spacing and pacing back and forth
Sober mind racing
Adjacent to this greatness I'll make a case for my tape
And in case you're thinkning of facing I'm undefeated unchanging
Got Mona Lisa jaw hanging
These crooked teeth don't have braces
Counting out on the couch I think it's time to make some changes
And basically what I'm saying's a come-up is being arranged
You know- browse my flows; Anthony Davis couldn't save it
My homies lurk in the places that leave your face on the pavement
Outrageous mama don't recognize you, crazy what I'm saying
Enslavement to the cake is damnation
When your capers failing- racing and you end up dead facing your dead faces
I fill the pistol with the lead of the pencil
All-white Annies on my feet rest in peace to temple
I spit that inflammation I'll enlarge your lymph nodes
An uncommon ascent? I'm from godly descent
Kid don't know how to act
Used to stand outside of class no interact but just to rap
In fact, I used to bug the teachers
Always talking about the difference between hooks and features
It was books or speakers
They was hating; I was cooking ethers
The shook recieve them
Success that I took? Forseen it
Strike at the heart of the fakers
The cards on the table
The hearts that I've taken are lost in the matrix
The kid is amazing
Pay me
