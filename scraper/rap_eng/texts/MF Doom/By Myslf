Sing along with me [x2]
What is real? [x2]
What is real? [x2]
Staring out my window
What do i see
What do i see
Everybody trying to get down with the rhythem
Get down with the sound
So profound
I don't even know where i am going
Half the time [?]
I been holding back all my life
Holding back all my fucken life
And i was always taught i was always a jerk
I have been helded back my entire life
From my potential, everybody knows that its essential

These demons crawling around scheming
Trying make me feel like i ain't even dreaming
What is real
Why can't feel
I'm numb I'm dumb and uh
Rule of thumb i don't succumb
Yo I don't even cum half the time
I bust a nut by myslf
What the fuck
What is real
What is real
I can't feel
I can't feel

You promised you would be there
You promised you would be fair
You promised you would promise


I don't think
Think for myself
I walk by my self
In the shadows
So nobody can follow
Where are we going baby
I don't even know
I got my headphones on and they is cordless
Fuck the cordial formality
I can't stand it
They don't even know where the passion lies anymore
Everything feels like it dies inside my soul
I was always taught not to think for myself
Now i think for myself
I don't know how to do it, how to pursue it
Use the music just to push through
The andomibal snowman
With no plan of capturing that girls aide
I walk by myself
Stand by myself
