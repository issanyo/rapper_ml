[MF DOOM]
Well you know who spill rhymes to spit hurls
Killed it like a dude doin' time for hittin' girls
And tellin', smash handheld shell skin
Crash van on bell in, felt twelve spin
Hot molten metal from out hell's kettle
Ill dent health bill, take pills and settle
Cement mental will
Bent it in like a dent in grill
It happened before once but went still
Fool me twice
Keep in mind the golden rule be nice
Jewelry with ice prices sold to a fool
Goin' through [??] on who's all ghouls
Knowing new tools, flowing drool pools
Thinkin' it's a joke, must be smoking Kool wools
Not so thurst to take no old lady purse
Everybody got a mama, ladies first
Crazy verse
