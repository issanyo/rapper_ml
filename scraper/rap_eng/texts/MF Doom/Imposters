[Verse 1]
Im purging in Persia
First nigga down
Is gonna be the prince
Long Jake Gyllenhaal
In my house
Where i sit
Over the balcony
Like Michael Jackson's son
Hear the king of POP
As bullets fly
Out of pops guns
Straight hits on my arsenal
Turn this Freaky Friday
Into a Bad Thriller
With the flick of
A middle finger
Sippin' imaginary elixir
Heard this beat through the grapevine
Extra loops in my rhymes
My fame lasts about
Seven seconds online
About as long as you wait
For your tampons and steaks
Leave you bitches bloody
C's up
Little crippled chicken little crippin'
Sky might fall
And that's word to Kid Cudi
Cuddle up with your thunder buddy
Calm down
The only Ted here is Bundy
Hes the one who cut the rope
While you was Bungie jumping
From Microsoft to Sony
Child Rebel Solider, like P, Ye, and Kony
Grab you by your throat
And put a cancer  hole in it
Shove my dick in it
Wasn't enough orifices
Or faces to break, just to get my point across
Plottin' on a graph
Basic math
Got you bonus bogus niggas
Stepping off, signing off
Nigga
