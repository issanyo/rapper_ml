(Before VERSE 1)

Yo We all live but...
Nobody Else Dies right...

Yoooo!
Mac with a sideways 8
I keep it 100
That mean ya boy be rapping
And never fake
Yeah

(VERSE 1)
She pulled up at 8 on a Friday
I was a Junior and had a Senior coming to my place
My bros was giving me props like a movie
Hoping tonight
That the ball would roll like a movie
Groovy
Like Metal Fingers produced it
I had the sauce
But I finally had a chance to use it
She texted me first so I wasn't gone lose (*censor beep*)

Or maybe I was mistaken

I got dressed and she was in the living
Talking to my mother and pops
About her plans for college
Tryna get scholarships locked
Looking as fine as cherry blossoms
Mixed chick with curly locks
Like..
Damn
I really pulled a dime and its a crime
10 out 10
I really did it alone this time
But after the small talk
We decided to talk small
We hit the road like jack
And headed to the mall

My moms like be back by 11
And be safe
I'm like
Mama I'm with her ima be straight
We made it
We parked
And we walked to the theatre
I'm tryna keep it low
But it's follow the leader
And I end up running into some other seniors
("De'Auan I see you bro!")
I'm like...
Nigga I don't see you
I'm tryna move in silence
Keep it 100 like Trikru
We walked by and now I got control
Like the WiiU
And I don't wanna be you
She taken my pride
Paid for both of our tickets like I wanna see you
And I wanna see you too
I got a 10 on my side
And I'm looking hella coo
These niggas got 9 and they tryna shoot
Quit messing with these thugs
And get a guy thats true
Because I guarantee
They'll end up dead or in the ICU
So we head inside and get our seats
And its sweet
I put my arm around her and we fall asleep like

(*Snoring*)

We wake up and the credits is showing like a transcript
I'm staring at her like...
You too fine to be from Kansas
She cracking up like I'm actually hilarious
Taurus and Sagittarius
The ball rolling and I'm not carrying
Marrying?
Nah
But I'm thinkin'
We can sing like Selena
When we linkin' on the weekend

That's not the point
Lets getting to eating

So we pull up the restaurante
I tell her
She not paying for (*SHIT*)
She like boy...
Not today
I'm independent like July 4th
The only time you paying game
Is when you balling on the court
(Swish!)
I'm like whatever (*reverse sfx*)
Get it together
I'm hungry like birds catching worms in stormy weather
We sit down at the table
And people think we together
I'm just hoping that I can keep it together
Just check the signs
It's obvious infinity is forever
So when I get it i try to never say ever
We order our food
And then we leave like....
Together
I'm tryna gather some balls
Like tether

(In Between VERSE 1 and 2)

And the Corniest Bar Award
Goes to...
(I already know who it is)
Mac Infinity!
For his line in...

(VERSE 2)
This is a date right?
But nobody ever (*censor beep*)
Taught me how to date right
So when she dropped me off at my house at midnight
I didn't know that I was supposed give her a kiss
Alright?
