[Intro]
Uh
Shoutout to big- big daddy, MF DOOM
𝘠𝘦𝘢𝘩
You already know he probably has a big peepee
𝘠𝘦𝘢𝘩 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘪𝘵
Sorry for using your beat without telling you
But you probably won't notice 'cause I'm not famous yet
Anyways

[Verse 1]
Let me say it straight
Lately I've been fuckin' with fantasy
Sanity is fuckin' up my reality
When I was a little kid I dreamed of being special
Big dreams, big hopes
Things I thought was special
Lyrical talent is nothing to someone who thinks that other people who mumble are better off as a rapper
Every single artist got the same damn flow
As they're rapping 'bout shooting and smoking, man I guess so
I guess they do what they told 'em
Because their parents who raised them
Were pretty shitty at moments when they just needed some lovin'
Hip-Hop is dead
It's taken over by the rappers who claim themselves to be rappers
But really inside they' nothin'
My talent doesn't matter 'cause all of the other rappers gettin' vividly famous
They rapping shit that don't matter
The people want some shit about the shootin' and killin'
Because at home they daddies told them 'bout the shootin' and killin'
I'm like shink '02
K9 sensitivity
Lovesick shit
That's my speciality
Rally the cavalry
'Cause I'm free to my salary
Eating money for calories
Like I'm writing a diary of my poetry
The flows of me

[Outro]
The words
What's the word
What's the word
What's the word
𝘈𝘺, 𝘶𝘩𝘩
Bitch
