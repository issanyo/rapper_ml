(verse)
A mental challenge
To mentally charge
Their mental talents
Meaning it’s made up in their head
Making a simple balance
Of minor major higher keys
Of madness
Making matters worse
Til their man is
Mattered and made of maggots

I give a fuck bout their major status
A major pain in my mind
Is just another major pain in their asses
A mental rage to review
With maliciously made
Manners
My making of murderers
Is called making
My own manners

Take the total or get totaled
Tackled or toe tagged
Satan’s saint stated
To stay until i’m speaking in static
Beat em, bruise em, break em up and
Leave em all in a body bag
Fire up them squares
Them cancer sticks
And them filthy fags

Shit
Whatever you wanna call it
The last line i spit is gonna cause a tizzy
I can call it
It has nothing to do with balls and
It’s nothing to do with sex
It’s just what they call cigarettes in Darwin

That’s Australia
You rappers iggy azalea
Whenever my name is mentioned
Celebrate parentalia
You got a problem send the work
Pop up and we’ll be mailin ya
You’re probationary level
Like drug paraphernalia

Get your shit together
Cuz all of ya bars are failin ya
Digging your own grave like
You’re working a shovel pale and a
I’m setting sail on the city
To sell your space in regalias
You’re drunk if you’re sleeping on me
You celebrate bacchanalia

(hook)
I’ve yet to hear you spit shit
Well i’ve heard you try to spit
But i’ve yet to hear you spit some sick shit
You think you hitting hard
But i’m always hitting harder on the hit stick
But i mean
Cool bro
You got a nice shirt
And some nice clothes
I guess you got a sick fit
But
You ain't got this kind of sick fit
Bitch
