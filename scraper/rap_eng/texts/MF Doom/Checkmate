[Intro]
In the year of 1994
A motherfucking earthquake just hit New York
You know what I'm saying
Earthquake is here
Straight up

[Verse 1:Earthquake]
I'm wrecking niggas like pencils on a piece of white paper
When I fuck up I can just use my eraser
Deck em, rub em' out and have much clout
Like Damon Wayans Bruce Willis on the Last Boy Scout
My pockets rollin' thick like a milkshake
I overflow the party cuz that shit says earthquake
I get on stage, start to rake em, I bake em
I use A-1 sauce and eat that nigga like steak-um
Earthquake is up when they come to [?]
I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven
I get the nack when I pack
A 3-5-7 in my sack
Cuz I'm short of a new jack
Aw heck, here's a peck on yo' cheek
I fold em and roll em' and dunk em like Dominique
I get the inspiration
When I see the girls in jubilation
Racing to my place and
Wanna touch my face
As I start to pace and race
Brush em' off like toothpaste
So think twice if you wanna step to this miss
I'll have ya burnin' like [?]
Hey up ya can't leave without no say so
If we were [?] I take all yo' pace so
[?] this is earthquake on yo stereo
Fuck with me I leave you soggy like yo' cereal
I'm gone, checkmate

[Hook]
Make a move like chess then checkmate
I make a move like check, nigga then checkmate
Move like chess, nigga, checkmate
I make a move like chess, nigga
Then I yell checkmate

[Verse 2: MF Doom]
Back as the invisible killer up on yo' screen
So get yo neck thumpin' between my guillotine
Checking magazine for x the unseen
Mad niggas know what I mean
I come clean as a whistle
Or filthy as my last pistol
Mine get you now- BUST
I get down to the bristle and burn em'
Like from up under the mistletoe
With the ho and she ain't even
[?] like a flow tec
Switch, i'm the suspicious, viscious X
So shit i'm a mission got this punk like a
Yo probably [?] I say like a fish
But bust a how I front punk
Punk I get em' like a blunt
And my middle finger index
A thumb [?] a bum nigga
A son of a gun
Squeeze the trigger hallelusa
Looser than the bullshit ya used to
I jam like a tec' I am the [?]
Master of the zero harrasser of yo' zip code
Disaster to the superhero, flipmode
In 93' I heard mad emcees that annoyed me
Like DTs on CDs
Checkmate

[Hook]
I make a move like that, then I yell checkmate
Makin' moves like chess, nigga, checkmate
I make a move like chess nigga then I yell checkmate
Makin' moves like chess, kid, checkmate

[Verse 3:?]
I cremate, dominate
Then sell some lemonade
10 cents a cup, little kid
Then I terminate like Arnold
Schwarzenegger
I am a little bigger
Ten shades darker than that
With the itchy finger
My whole game is a bible
I kill a nigga dead
With some lead
And put my head on his [?] bible
I swear to God I didn't do it
It's just another day of my life
[?] i'm sick and you niggas knew it
I'm crossing criss cuz i'm pissed
Time to diss
[?] for doing a motherfucking twist
I hid the body now it's over
The cops are havin' a really bad time finding that ass like a four leaf clover
So before you check me and try to do me
Quaka' kick ya ass just like Hong Kong-Fui (CHIKA)

[Outro]
Checkmate
I just crossed the board and I got checkmate
I just crossed the board and I got checkmate
I just crossed the board and I got checkmate
I got the checkmate I got the checkmate
