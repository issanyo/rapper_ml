[Verse 1]

Spazz Spazzed when he saw this track
Bet he caught a heart attack
You'll kill me lyrically ? nah you got it twisted B
"i'm gifted" sucked, like homie what is this trickery?
Leave ya mental frozed up you don't want it with the wizardry
He's a swag fag rapper not fit for the industry
MC's like you bring out the superhuman within me
Spectro tell him quit dickeating 'fore he catch strep throat
And step up, take notes before you step to EsOh
Talking all that loud on twitter like its nothing
I just wanna know who laced the loud that you puffing?
That caused you to start bluffin' and frontin'
Man, all I'm saying is quit acting tough kid
See the day is darkening, and the hate is harboring
The years are turning to a much darker scene
They wanna talk down but this is the "memoirs of marcus"
Take long steps to me , catch ten yards of carnage
Detonate ya mind with lines of a warhead
Say "I told ya" then write a third eye on ya forehead
Busta
Jovany just looking to get bust up
Have him in the grave crazily throwing blood up
I'll tie todd with his shoe lace, with your lyrics you lose me
You ain't no illumi-nati kid
But your girl is possessed to do some naughty shit
To me

Break..

[Hook]

And there's a plague on my enemies, sad to say there's no remedy
You have entered the demon, legion, don't look at this spiritually
There's a plague on my enemies, sad to say there's no remedy
You have entered the demon, legion, don't look at this spiritually

UH

[Verse 2]

Alota people claiming that they bought to play up
But check the triangle to see if they chose ya
Cause, you stay in the box, and you always closed up
And if you not made for it, then homie own up
To the fact, that you wack
And your tracks are in vain
And you act as a slave
Do you grasp what I'm saying?
Probably not, it's ok
Step to a cyclone , get stomped
Kid I spit vomit on your incompetence
Assholes black hole, reaction that occured
Deepthroat a chainsaw, an orgy and a massacre
I'm in for this game, for the rewards that you get
Honestly a souped up acura , sounds accurate
Ya'll don't get it , I'm heartless
And hardly ever sympathetic
I hate romance, somehow I think that it's pathetic
Rhythm and poetry, what I use as my weapon
To rob citizens of their bank
And undeserving rank
You write about nothing
Trying to be clever but shooting blanks
And you still wonder why ya production stanks
[Hook]

You hear this, and now ya brain cells all distorted
Bring you hell, I got spells in all of assortments
Tell me why these niggas wanna hold me back?
My nigga, these niggas won't hold me back
They trying to slash my aspiration
Only cause he know he wack
Man they just copycats , copy that?
Roger that, you can't LA dodge the fact
Homie holla back ...
