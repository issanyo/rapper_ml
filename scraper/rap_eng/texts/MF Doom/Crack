Step off me nigga
Before I off the nigga

Bitch I'm often killing niggas with
Shit I deliver, like liquor inside of ya liver
Or
Stabbing ya inner child
Then I run wild, into the night
No feeling of fright as I take bites of Mary's delight
Now pass me a light so I can get high as kite
That's not right
Niggas tryna take a satellite flight
Only invite the bitches that are tight as a bowl pack
I love that
Honey buns, sonic and run rap
You run track
Your mouth run more than ya legs do my kin
Don't act
Like a nigga ain't made you
I'm Jes√∫s mixed with fallen angels unstable
Netflix with your girlfriend fuck cable

Lightskin niggas bout to take the fucking world again
So tell your friend to tell a friend to tell your girl again
Sorry
But it's a party and it's no niggas aloud
Unless you bringing pounds
Of the loud
For the crowd

Acting wild as possible dank
Loud as possible
Got the connect for Actavis it's optional
Nigga

I been the one to get it done when the microphones swung to the hands of the man

The nigga with plan
Yes
I do concur that my deliveries absurd at times
And I'm surprised that rhymed
But truthfully we all gotta surprise ourself at times
And that's cool

R & R with the type of chick you meet at med school
She a fool for the fool
With the dunce cap

Rapping cause I love rap, and she loves that, so she loves rap$ and I love that
It's a fun fact
That I bust tracks

Most of y'all go nuts for that
I ain't signed to label controlling me I'm unstable I said it
Like You read it on reddit
But I tweeted on twitter
Now here's some crack for you niggas
