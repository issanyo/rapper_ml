[Verse 1]

(Thandi)
I hydrate your souls, aquatic meditation
Goddess of the river
Lover of precipitation
I am the love and I am the beauty
Protection of a mother but sometimes I can get moody
Especially when my children forget that there’s work to be done
Ignoring the truth of the Supreme One
Your greed and irreverence has dried me out
Rebel or prepare for eternal drought
Oh

[HOOK]

Orishas, we your teachers, open up your eyes and recognize
It’s a, a reason for the demons
Refuse to comply, speak your mind, don’t abide
We the
Orishas, we your teachers, sister deities, the rivers and the seas
Orishas, your teachers, Queens of Africa, Oshun and Yemoja


[Verse 2]

(Niambi)
Orisha and abosum
And the ancestors too
Keep the trinity Blue
Because when me and you
Were taken on the Ferris
Were taking from our families
Were taken from our terrace
Were taken to a land that wasn't really there’s
See I followed you there
And I washed off your tears
You were wondering where
I was when you were saying your prayers
I was swimming in the water
Swimming in the ocean
Swimming in the seas
See I was chosen
To nurture your hope and keep it awoken
May Jah bless your token
Stay reverent and open to

[HOOK]
