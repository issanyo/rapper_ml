[Intro]
Alright, here we go
Uh
Take you to that new plateau, through rap slow
[Verse]
The world is mine like Brian De Palma
Illuminati wants my mind, soul, and my body
The kid's a mix between John A. and Irv Gotti
Golden shotty in the bed, where all these bloody roads end
Where all that bloody dough spent
Nas raised the bar, I'm just trynna grab it
For me rap is life, it's no longer a habit
Now that shit right there, it's phony as fuck
Kind of ironic the name Trillmatic stuck
Just like the world, the choice is yours
Give to the rich or expect more from the poor
But think about if you lived on the top tier
Is it worth all the glitz to live your fucking life in fear
Most of you spit like you can't have any fun
Voices like vampires, never been out in the sun
Put a positive spin on the tough guy' rhyme
Just gotta thank God you ain't gotta pray for a single dime
Cause from time to time, I sit back and just think
What would life be like if I didn't have a sink?
If I lived in the projects and avid used the pyrex
Contract the killer crabs when I'm going up in raw sex
No dad or mother, just me and my brother
Only looking out for him and the PD undercovers
Going home to no food or family at the dinner table
Same shit happens everyday until you're picked up by the label
All you wanna do is sweep your mistakes under the carpet
Take them like a man and don't try to start shit
Grandma always told me we people are equal
We also kill one another, we lethal
Man, fuck being peaceful
Think I go hard now, just wait for the sequel
[Outro]
