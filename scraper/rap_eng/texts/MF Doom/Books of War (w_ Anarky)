[Verse: Wodiene & Anarky]

Ice Cream cone dreams, make a nigga freeze
Come back to reality and realize rapping is the key
To be successful, even though writing is very stressful
You just wait for your time and wait for opportunities
Get patience for the maintenance of your rap career
Hoping your come-up won't be your fall
Just like a stack of beers
It's like working a day shift and a night shift
It's all worth it once you end up driving nice whips

Yeah
Nice whips, with the top down, and surround sound
But then it gets cold outside like some ice chips
Don't be afraid to take that shot if you might miss
Case closed disclosed like rollercoaster eyelids
That's x flight no wolverine in the origins
Still feasting on this game with, beast portions
I can mix and master shit like green potions
For the witch, burn and she dead like parents of orphans

Being the center of attention nobody get's that
I plan to touch J. Cole's microphone, & bless it
When it comes to talking bout' my lyrics, don't test it
I come in the rap game, because I am the best fit
Erase his identity, if he try to forsaken me
Chop him, kill em', cut em' up & turn him into bacon please
These people have no patience for good lyrics
There's limited good shit, when everybody needs to hear it

At the top of the food chain with wodiene we so clean
Sit back relax sipping kool aid like codeine
Cause I never been the one to grow up from the kid days
But my height took a step up soon be like 6'8That's why I always say I stay on top of the food chain
But I still keep it hidden like Batman to Bruce Wayne
They never guess it's me cause I'm the one man enigma
Keep it moving off the steps cause I don't have a minute

Many people can't just come up from the trenches
Many people stuck sitting on the benches
I'm neither one, always climbing up in the game
Whether it be rap, or EA sports I'm rising to the fame
I gotta lot on my mind, more on my shoulders
They look around without helping out the soldier
I drop a lot more music when I get older
And keep my lyrics stuffed in m 9th grade folder

I'm still making sense but these people say I changed
Either way I get dollars & coins it's all the same
Lost a lot of friends to learn a lesson in the end
That not everybody real and a lot are just pretend
Cross me once like a street then I put you on a leash
But cross me again, like ski mask you will regret
So now I got a 6th sense and I see blood in the water
Take me to your leader and I'll put him up for slaughter

Last few chapters, stay woke young rappers
We blow up like balloons, nah we blow up like clappers
We flamethrowers and the heat is 451
Team cold like the solar system but hot as the sun

And that's over 9 thousand on that super flame shit
Too hot get out the kitchen and don't complain then
Cause you know we wrecking it like Ralph and the glitch
So sick like neyo ain't talking bout the matrix

I dodge the start cause I'm always starting at the end
These rappers silly string, they all easy to bend

I send that S.O.S., for anybody on end
Then I type the message to a text, hit return and send
