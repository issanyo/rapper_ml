Give me a shot of the liquor on the rocks
With some warm top off the top Im Nice With It

Kids get hit on the block like everyday
Where im from SouthSide don't play

Get played? Many days Im lucky to get play
Used to be a dusty n***a no Waves

Chicks see my linens and they be like NO WAY!
No im off the top wit the Rock toup√©e

Save a seed no need to be a candle light sorrow
Eating one meal today rich tomorrow

Peace to the sun planting love in the dirt
In a all white shirt like Versace, Hilfiger

Something of worth to the Unconscious man
I speak and bleed revival read through greed

I see one one bible acknowledge one God one Woman no Idol
