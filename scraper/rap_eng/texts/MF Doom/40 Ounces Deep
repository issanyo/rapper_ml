[Verse: Geez Francisco]

Marijuana staining my clothes
Been packing bowls to get my mind another plane than my soul
In other words the kid flow corresponds with his goals
To get the gold and kick a thirst jezebel to the curb
I burn herb then go to work with a verse
Suitcase full of money louis tie on my shirt
See I'm a business man first but still will give em that work
The xannie man too proficient in the art of disperse
Throwing kicks at ya circ, wit a dick in ya bitch skirt
It's obvious she acknowledge my prowess with the rhymes
Shotgun flows'll break the link between your spine
I was chosen so it's faith I'd be the bringer of demise
The grim reaper
Catch two bodies just from the scent of the speakers
See these bitches get deep in deeper then daucons creek get
18 year old genius but still gripping my penis
And feeling like I'm ceasar's right at the door with the evil
Wicked old soul warlock with the nappy hair
Half a man for the shit that I'm toking it's super rare
Inducing fear off the shit written need scuba gear
When I flow leave em submerged 40 deep in a hole
40 deep in my soul searching for chicas and hoes
To give my whistle a blow and give my swishers a roll
Ride solo , Og told me it's way better
It's all about the cheddar so best keep few burretas
The wushu shogun on words that were never spoken
Kamehameha waves when I'm flowing his souls open
Excalibur what I'm toting decapitated in moments
King Arthur supreme rapper the king author
Since I been smoking jane my third eye got sharper
But it also got darker inducing thoughts of a coffin
Whether shots from the ruger or my asthmatic coughing
Imma die one day til then remain cautious
I'm militant more like rorschach with the vigilance
Skillet shit surface of cowards I get too grilling shit
I'm menacing O-dog Kane mixed with some Benjamin
To old for my years 3 wiser to my peers
So pop you 5 xanax in your mirror I'll appear
To take you on a journey I portray in these journals
About a kid in the sauce whose flows just be thermals
Verbal execution let me find out that you looting
I apprehend, geez taking out a hundred men
Bare handed with a 40 in hand while hand standing
Walked home without no scratches just vacant caskets and laughing
Show to the funeral repeat the tragedy
Only the finest pussys crossed my big lips
And big spliffs then greet your baby mother with my diz-nick
Don't test me cause I perfected DDT's especially
The zannie man back with that motherfucking recipe
So roll my sour D let me spit
So you can get high on me backwood packages
Left on top of the fucking cabinets
Right by the packets of kool-aid to get my bladder thick
I batter shit, dont bring reggie around my area
Illadelph for ever Kwan geez running for mayor top slayer
Part dragon and terminator while home third base was tryna play tomb raider
That's why I keep the shepard's healthy but also rabid
Full house of killers and I feel like Bob Saget
With the moves of Sagat as I lay on my cot
With ya shawty hitting all her fucking spots
And just enjoying my life
