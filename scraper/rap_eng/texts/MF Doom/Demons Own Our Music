Feel it in my veins when you feel it in my wrist
Feel it in my veins when you feel it and you flip
Feel it in my veins when you feel it and you’re sick
Feel it in my veins when you feel the twitching so dismissve

Go get
Need to win it
Where’s my pendant
I always end it
They barely breathing
No oxygen

Wait
That didn't rhyme

Shit

I love to write bars till the fucking beat drops
I love to write bars till the fucking beat stops
Your blade ain't as sharp as the tip of my tongue
LA is where I’m at
South central where im from

Sense that aggression
Let that shit build up
Tank full of anger
Yeah that bitch filled up

Damn go ahead
Now I step on the gas
Damn im possessed
Now im stuck with the mask

Life’s a canvas but im painting with my hands
My shit’s halfed ass
Wait
That’s a lie

I’m tryna catch buzz
But im not in the hive

Bumblebee in real life
When I roll out you die

I don't even try
But i stay fucking cold
I’d melt your barbie ass
But everybody has bro

Get it
That was stupid
Fuck it

Why jab when you ain’t gonna hit back
Why jab when your music always gets smacked
Get a check
But we knew you’d never get that
I’m a keep it fast
This is just a recap
Why am I always trying to stab at the corpse
Leave them on your door
Resting inna porch

There ain’t no point in me even doing this shit anymore
Why the fuck i still do it
I’m a just keep to myself

Keep doing you
Bitch imma do me
Keep doing you
Bitch imma flow free

Four wounds on my chest
Call me bruce lee

Direct an X
Put your head on a spike like lee
See how i speak
See how i see
Chop up the beat
Cuz i could never weave
Wanna go ham but these pigs ain’t clean

Chop them up
Sauce them up
I guess there’s a lot of us
Gotta bust
Lost the rust
Shit
Who’s on top of us
From the heart but we start at the roots like chakras

Damn take it eazy
When i duz it
Always keep the syllables coming in dozens
Fuck it what a ruckus

Bitch i’m up to something
