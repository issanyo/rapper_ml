I move through in the sorta mist that blind my vision
If I could get up outa this mess resembling sheets and cold feet
I wouldn't be stressed out at the moment
Over people requesting favors like shark loanin'
I'm roamin' around the designated past
There's usually outlines directing my lazy ass
The motherfucker where they be at
Who does he accept for a remedy to they ails
Moanin' melody escapes from a quill and I will
I chose to wake up instead of staying asleep
In my house or a home I can't find it in my room
Or a bowl in the hole the basement the floor mat
Don't have a key
Now how the hell do I escape this misery
This feeling inside of me, this shit is beyond belief
I wish I learned the courage to fall asleep at day or at night
My sight holds no light good night

Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)

Now there's fear and love in the guise above
There's a war for your mind all of the time
Beauty here but ugly there, everywhere you go
All that really matters is which side
So I just wish the feeling of feeling something
Like the desert Mr. Rain it's been dry since I came
It's all I know, I travel on the road
Trying to look for my soul, avoiding a pothole
I worry most of the time when I'm supposed to incline
I don't know what's mine or yours
Been searching for a sign, or something divine
For some time now, nigga get me out from the black hole
I love you so much my body aches
Take such good care of you but I can't see
The ghost behind the machine, and what I don't see
I have a hard time believing in conceiving in this dream

Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Good night!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Yeah!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Oh yeah)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Yeah, yeah!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Yeah, yeah!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Yeah, yeah!)
Do you know of a way to embrace the sun
(Yeah, yeah!)
