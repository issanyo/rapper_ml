[MF Doom]
Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fail
Sunday in the A-T-L and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the ale
Makin sure they can't see your sale via snail mail
Mind like a sewer, servin rhyme on a skewer
Doom'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
My black sister, she said "Step back" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap is just a friendly issue to
I'm like these dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end, when the day come
Buy an album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CD's you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like steak'um
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paparika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker
Every week or so peaked out the lab though, eureka
A technique to keep somethin uniquer in your speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat y'all
It ain't my fault, if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, got Peter to pay Paul
So you can drink it on Mary so she can play ball
... So let her have my scrilla
And cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
And rhymin to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him build walls like a goalie
One for the money, two for the better green
Three for methanine-dioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock kneed ghetto queen get the head fiend
Tell him it's for Medell√≠n and use oxyacetylene
Who needs airplay, it's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was havin a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said Shasta, and turned to formaldehyde faster
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night she tried to flail me with her ukelele
Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat
... You better have my scrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?
Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me
And if you don't feel him build walls like a goalie
