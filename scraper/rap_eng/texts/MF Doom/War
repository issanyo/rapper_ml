[Verse 1: JJ]
Start the shit, it's the apocolypse of metropolis
Not profiting from studio's false promises
Honor this
The legendary of motions
Blowing up, fire, incendiary explosions
Said you wanted war now your missionaries are floating
In difference various oceans
Pacific, Atlantic, they're coasting
47 my visionary is opened
To experience occurence of military compulsion
Listen, I'm reading these niggas with intuition
And visioning people chilling, put rhythms into submission
Note book/ No book is irrelevant, Lyrics is improvision
We're living inside a mission of governmental restrictions
We're blowing up I hope you're moving in time
Cause we're avoiding the explosion while iluding/ Eluding the mind/ mine
Over thinking situations is a nuisance/ new sense of mine
And without the dedication I'm abusing the spine
Everybody saying death is a bliss
I never met a situation as depressing as this
My dads gone, and my mother works 11 to 6
Situations got me questioning if heaven exists
Because everybody's philosophical but deaf in the lips
Carrying weapons with clips, without a definite risk
Life is as great as an elegant mist
So why would I waste the shit, impressing a bitch
I mean women that's the passive aggression
I'm trying to get in touch with this astral projection
I'm trying to see my dad so I could ask him a question
Of why does life have to be so sad and depressing
And what's the meaning of life
And why these niggas getting girls if they're not treating them right
And why's the grim reaper reaching his sythe
Is is cause of a soon fate or am I leaving tonight
(Hook)
[Verse 2: JJ]
Pissed off I'm aggravated like politicians
With this microphone I'm eradicating the competition
All I'm hearing is allegations and contradictions
Ever try to front I'll ejaculate in your mommas vision
Life's a novel I'm emulating a horror fiction
Anybody hard then I'm demonstrating a harder friction
Go ahead and contest your fate with the hottest mission
We gone' test to see if you respirate with your collar missing
Little niggas is playing with my tolerance
Parading me with complements
And gaining my acknowledgement
But they're just waiting for apocolypse
X-box flow a variation of accomplishments
No friends no patients for incompetence
You better stay alert like there's a rapist in your providence
Saying blatant statements I'm raping stages with dominance
Accomplices'll eat your conglomerate with some condiments
