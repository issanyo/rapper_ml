(verse1
Smoother than moisturizer, always been joyful child, idolizing god, running around with toy messiah while, stepping out the single file, singled out, cinc de mayo, 5,5, I could get you high gal, right now, got to find the high ground, nice sounds welcome to my iCloud, I'm facing the internet, I browse, time allows my brain to be impounded in the web, spider man release me now, I’m innocent, I’m teaching how to get the win
While you hopping the fence, I been blocking, I'm in defense, mode, and yo chick should be
Too, I'll turn into incubus, and you'll have ten minutes to rescue her from this anaconda
Safety first wears the condom, world in my hands, I palm it, and plan to drop it like it's hot, when I stop, helping undergrounders to the top
But I won't, give in to ya, I won't, writtens to ya, I spoke, give the tutor nice applause, I live in music, lifes a song

(Hook
Time is getting lower
Look into my eyes, I can't lose focus
I feel the devils presence, he's approaching
He telling to me stop and that makes no sense, my god
To make a killing you gotta murder 2x

(verse2
Interstellar travel, into hella gravel, while my partner getting sick, I tell him gravi-, ty is no more, cause U is next, tell me who the best, tell me who gone shoot with you, and bring the extra vest
Let me correct the guess, I'm mortal, but I'll resurrect, leave my heaven bed, return to earth and spark an innovative head instead
Sporting all black, instead of holy white
You know me like to switch it up, ain’t giving up, I’m picking up the holy Bi-, ble, a Taurus a bull, coming in full, cool, diving in your swimming pool, I call that baptism fool
This ain't my instrumental, but I produced
A father to any beat and nigga this child abuse
Anything you tryna do, I tried it too, tied with two minutes left, against time, without the refs, lie to me, put trust to death, running to death, cause the race with life is infinite, the beginning, you witnessed, with pictures, evidence that he’s heaven sent

(hook2
Never thought you’d like this, did ya
Feeling all the power, ready to devour
Ladies do you like this nigga, he murders by the hour, oh yeah
Making killing is my fate, crime scene is my home place, never meaning to lose control (aye) (nigga what you doing)
So annie tell me you’re okay

(verse3
A cannon lose and I’m shooting, the aim is stupid, ain’t it, cannibal, drink ya blood like it’s campbells soup, and I’m spooning with new women
Animal like an antelope, with dannon yogurt stuck in the antlers, hopeless, got silent lambs and hannibal in camera roll, this writers hand you can’t control, dancing with janet jackson in panty hose, frantic, the panic happens when antidotes, are handed to ban the happy moments, you know, like blowing a high, rob lowe in a knife, fight, with mike an ike, not the candy, tyson and turner, hydrant left behind, fire man, I hide in a furnace, the furnitures burning, family returning’s concerning me, my mom and dad pulling up to a murder scene, I come out with burning jeans and a miami heat jersey, with eddy curry
Expressing the hurt and guilt, but regretting the murder, no, first to go, and I second the fact that my third eye is open, tightly focused on the prize, tightrope walking across the sky, and if I fall then I, won’t apologize, I’ll say sorry for all the lies, then stop falling and fly, uh , preposterous guy, offering high, quality, songs for the college kids
Y'all look what my father did
Mommy raised a Frankenstein, a monster taking places, I'm a problem for the basic rhymers, knowledge ain't the way? You lying
But no need to go school if you know the rules, getting deep, I'll swim with the sharks and own a pool
