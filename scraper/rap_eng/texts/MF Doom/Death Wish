[Intro: Sample]
This is the day of the dead
An ancient tradition during which the deceased are believed to return to their families

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Wrote this rhyme straight across
Clown sure to take a loss
You know they jealous
If behind his back they ever say he soft
Spin back around, quick!
Confront 'em and they play it off
Young and the world is full of it
Forge ahead stay the course
At the bar, who's buying?
Been in the game so long
He can tell when DOOM's lying
Sneaky pricks sure to get hit with a ball of spit
*spits*
Nahhh, keeps his integrity all of it
Must be too strong for tugging spirits
Guess everything is fair in love, and lust, and lyrics
Kinda fancy as suckers hide behind the bread
To the point that the hammer be behind the head
*click*click* Fire kid, bang!
Cocky since the power think they running shit
By the hour dissipating into nothingness
Villain up in this bitch, with a bottle
It's empty, it won't go to waste
Zero empathy

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Ambulance is rushing you
Insurance paid deductibles
Ninja Turtles backpack, 38. next to my Lunchables
Took 'em to the sweet suite
I made a drink, no Doctor Huxtable
Benz got massage seats but a bitch can't get too comfortable
My bottom line and my revenue
Man that's the only thing that ever resonates
Larry Fishburne, deep cover hoe
Sit back and watch a nigga medicate
How the fuck is rehabilitation
When you tossing younglings to the prison gates?
I ain't kill 'em, I just shot him in the face
But they gon' give me 20 if I violate
God damn, nigga
Might have to come out that mask if you snort a line of this
Bitch I'm half man, half cocaine in a pissy staircase
Serving gigas in a dirty kitchen cooking up Christina
Got it from a Mexican off Alameda
Told the homie we can swap it out
He gave me two bricks for the two-seater
Put a Steve Young in a 2 litre
Niggas having seizures, bitch I'm through leaning
I cannot afford to sleep out on the streets
Niggas tie you on the news leaking
Put a nigga face up on the news station
Wanna TMZ me eating tortellini, Maserati keep me central hoe don't see me
I'm the Don call me Freddie Gandolfini
Nigga what, nigga

[Outro: MF DOOM]
Zero Empathy
