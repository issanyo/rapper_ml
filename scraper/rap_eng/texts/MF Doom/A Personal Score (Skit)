R: Why don’t you tell him about the time we faced Doom?
S: Alright. Well as I remember, Doom had threatened the world leaders with destruction of every major city on earth
(Telephone rings)
S: Headquarters
D: Good evening
S: Would you believe it? It’s Doom on the phone!
R: What’s on your evil mind?
D: Hold your insulting tongue and mark my words well. I have plotted my revenge on you. Now I shall have it! Bid farewell to your friends!
R: Doom hates us all, but in his warped mind, he has a personal score to settle with me
