[Verse 1]
Villain got banished
Refused out the U.S., he ain’t even Spanish
Oaxacado, sock with a hole, toe
Miss the mean streets of LA, a pothole pro
The gold, though, in the nick of time
To kick a slicker rhyme, do your face like knickin’ a line
No, not deported
Be a little minute before things get sorted
Known to get money, never got caught, kid
Escape with a soft skid, short bid
Knock on wood, dope for plastic
Rock so hood, hope on spastic
Put it on the Ritz
Put your bullshit facial recognition on fritz
I’m afraid you’re sadly mistaken
BING! Spit it like a bad piece of bacon
Take the bread
Even if you gotta lay down on the ground and fake dead
Grab that, way out the habitat
Where the rabbits is at, far from the lab rats
Man’s right to know
Contemplate that as these hands write the flow
It ain’t done yet
He’ll let ya know some of the results come sunset
‘Til then, pack ya bowl
Jack it to ya crack hoe with the black soul, coal
Tune the diamond
Just so ya know it ain’t some buffoon rhymin’
Hey, watch ya tonsils
End up in the hospital, not responsible
Bust that gizzard
Then start to think how it ain’t worth the risk – is it?
Third degree black belt flow
Whoop his monkey ass ’til the track felt slow
Melt snow, now that’s gold
Blowin’ ‘em, make funds, wow, that’s cold
Stole on ‘em, throws them dice
Cool ‘em down, set to overflow with flow with ice, like
Liquid nitrogen, ain’t no wins
Macro to Micro, begin, into your skin
Villain strikes again
Equivalent to hundred-thousand milligram Vicodin
Not for nothin’
Your guess is worth more
Barefoot, doin’ Rick James on a dirt floor
Dirt poor, like don’t get your shirt tore, boy
Crown of thorns, chain made of razorblades
Gallon adorn homemade blazer suede
‘Bout to retire
Sit up somewhere in the sun and breath fire
That includes tipsy gettin’
We get it in like your big fat gypsy wedding
No more thuggin’
But don’t think you won’t get slapped kid, you buggin’
It’s all love, rhyme with more dough
Remind me of the fine wine time, raw flow

[Verse 2]
Not to interrupt
But anybody else notice time’s speeding up?
Make your local police worry monthly
And won’t be nowhere nears your country
Grown, and got no time for ‘em
Naps on his belly, do not hold onto iPhone
Bitches don’t knock me, slack jaw
Don’t speak Afrikaans, Cockney, or patois
Alhamdulillah, last off the corner
Only thing in this is blastin’ off on Warner
Super Villain, smooth sicko
Why oh why did I leave that booth Klitschko?
That’s not up for debate
Be straighter than straight off a big gulp of V8
If she wasn’t so bent
She’d know how the camel got it’s nose in the tent
Please, enough’s enough
Don’t get snuffed with the key to the cuffs
Gs on your bluffs…
Keys to the cuffs…
[Outro]
Please, enough’s enough!
