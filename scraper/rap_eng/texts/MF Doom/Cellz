[Intro: Charles Bukowski]
Born like this, into this
As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs
As political landscapes dissolve
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
We are born like this, into this
Into hospitals that are too expensive that it is cheaper to die
Into lawyers who charged so much that it is cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this, walking and living through this, dying because of this
Castrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God
The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs
Land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shape the earth
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of that
The sun hidden there
Awaiting the next chapter

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
DOOM from the realm of El Kulum smelly gel fume
Separating cell womb to Melle Mel boom
Revelations in Braille respiration inhale view
Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due
Blazing swords trace the haze praise the Lord
Saving Grace, lace your broad she say she bored
A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin
Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison
A Bad Samaritan averaging above average men
Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging
For scraps, perhaps road kill if that
Gift of gab and he flowed ill chrome stiff hat
Known for writing lightning tight lines
Chief and beefing being off deep ends divine bright shines even
Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine
Slight rewind tightly bind blind lead blind
Need mines now that was this is then, listening
To sizzling officialtons whispering, "Him again"
Metal Face Finster playing with the dirty money
Sinister, don't know what he saying but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath gave a F pay your debt they forget
Make her sweat bullets crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates

[Voice]
Three thousand years ago Moses said
Every human being is responsible for his actions
Or thy being is still thy beast, not yet human!

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
You ought to let your uncle flow my motorcyle trunk fulls
From 2 1 2 1 lose crumbs to trunks in bundles
Hands down, better than what your mans use to get
Standing around from where the translucent looses spit
Missing wheel you don't listen you're a feel head
Sitting in the kitchen pissing twitching kissing steel lead
Crime pays no dental nor medical
Unless you catch some time in county, state or federal
You heard like roaring waters in a seashell
If a tree fell you couldn't tell from 3 cell
Be real careful, they tell him by the earful
Kids doing skid bids acting out is terrible
Word is bond, fix your clothes put a shirt on
Pants sagging back when you use to meant you had a skirt on
Squirts posing as thuggers and hustlers
El Eloh closer then y'alls ball huggers and jugglers
Motherfuckers

(Voice)
DOOM is transmitting a message to you
Super fools
I need to use more power
