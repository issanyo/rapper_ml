[Verse]
Nigga whatchu know about the struggle
Don't you give me no rebuttal if it's subtle
I feel like i'm the only nigga bold enough to say he hate himself and really mean it
With no shoulder clutch, most you got a soul to love you
Don't like my tone that's cause i'm pouring what you born without
They be tryna tell me what ain't true fuck
What they talkin bout i been hatin shit since middle school
I'm talking in an out, since a sprout
I was firmly rooted in a fucking drought
Life behind the scenes ain't what it seems
To a nigga i was dreaming bout a dream
I made believe and i did it i been shitting on myself
Cause i can't seem to envision, life as appealing as making it
I made it my mission now i'm faded getting pissed off
Talking bout how you might get ya shit tossed for talkin bout my shit wrong
Lately it just seems like i'm my greatest critic
I took a lot i put it on myself and hated bitching until i lost it everything i wanted i ain't gotten and i guess it's just the kid in me who really wants it all sit in my room lie in the darkness while it holds me
I'm just tryna live without seams that seem to control me
I been cryin by my lonely
I got lots a problems but i never talk about em
Whether it's my wallet or my mama
I dream of making money just to find a way to leave her
It's funny how her product sell himself without her dealin
It's funny how a nigga fight his demons
Unload another dutchy burn the weed until i feel it
Nothing matters approach him wit a hammer
Break a nigga shit quick stab him rearrange his face
Placement like a face lift
My patience worn thin sweater on a summer day
Shit just don't feel right promised i would make a change
Fukkit, there i go again trynna discuss it
I find it hard to function till i'm moshin at the function
Fuck you fuck her fuck that other nigga too
I got damages ahead of me i got a lot to lose afraid
I don't think so
And these days everyone around me hiding right behind some thin smoke brighter than a burning city i could see you in the distance
If a nigga actin silly hit him til he bleedin shittin
I dont give a fuck i swear i'm running out of luck
Had to walk a thousand miles just to say i'm givin up
I could never be what you imagined
I'm a challenge but i manage
I'm as sad as ever passin pass away
I'm looking past it the shit
I'm saying drastic
This might give my lil niggas goosebumps treat it like a kids book
Jumpin from the rooftop i just wanna feel the concrete before the noose drop
Imma see my niggas when the time comes
Hopefully at that i'm emotional i know it it's a teeny wit a magnum
Speaking verses like a poet po' it out for everybody
This a singy song singaroo bullet holes, penetrating windows
Thats a couple clues dodging every topic in a nonchalant posture
Wit a goddess sitting on my crotch body cockblocker
Back it up toe dancing like a motherfuckin heathen
Im laughing while i'm heaving
I'm famished but i'm healing
I'm lavish while i'm screaming
I'm jabbing at the knees trick smile cause he step in and he noticed i ain't pleased yet
