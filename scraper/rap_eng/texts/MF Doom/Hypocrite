[Intro]

[Verse 1]

Reminiscing bout the days when I was a youngin
Instead of fuckin we huggin showing each other loving
Snacks in lunch bags we findin straps behind your back
Whip it out and niggas dropping to the ground like door mats
But before that I would sit around and chill in my tomb
Mummy watching toons from morning to afternoons
I was influenced by 2pac and Biggie Smalls
Cause my bro would always blast their songs bump it through the walls
I would play ball with the kids in my neighbourhood
They made the wrong decisions and guess what now they're locked for good
It's funny how I said that I would never smoke now I'm ripping these bong tokes, and getting broke cause of the dope
I lost hope in this generation
I know you're sick of waiting, you get impatient want someone to change it
I hope you're learning from my thoughts getting educated
Translate this because i feel like speaking up a different language
Nobody is even focused on the message, to sum it up, talk shit, get dropped like a miscarriage
Or get the gat to your ribcage, and sweat up buckets
Cause all you rap about is how you get blown like a trumpet
Pump a musket to a stomach if you think you the toughest
The youngest get influenced by the crazy and the dumbest

[Verse 2]

I don't care if you get hoes and love making dough
I want the realist rappers spitting in the studio
And take the gay ass techno music off the radio, some one get the paper towels cause I'm about to overflow
Woah
You never knew that I can spit this well
I guess it's since I'm shy and awkward you can never tell
I keep most things to myself you can't trust these snakes
And they always startin beef claiming it's never steak
I can't trust these fakes, I knew that since the day I was born
Fake friends get cut off like umbilical cords
I'm on a mission to chase and pursue my dreams
Spitting these lyrics feeling like it's a daily routine
Fiend for the green like I'm Popeye
Visine in my pocket cause you know I got the red eye
Left eye, staring at the world half blinded
Open up both eyes to seek exactly what you findin
