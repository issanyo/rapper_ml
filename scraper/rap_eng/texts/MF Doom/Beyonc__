Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

[Pre-Chrous]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh!
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
