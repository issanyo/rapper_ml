[Verse 1: Tommy Faucets]
I'm not you're average teenager
I walk around with a Motorola pager
I always bet high wagers
Cause simple I don't care
Put your hands in the air
So I can give ya free body shots
I can fix ya song, call me Tommy Doc
With the crazy socks and the big cock
And big booty bitches in my huge yacht
You could have all this if you would like
All you gotta do is start from where you at
Maybe with the huffy bike
It really was the struggle for the fucking team
But we joined together like a fucking seam
But it seems that the team would want a challenge
I am the leader but the pressure is balanced
But it never fazes us, cause my niggas be blazing up
And we just trying to beat the numbers
Cause if we don't we won't have any covers
But you'll never catch us sleeping or weeping
Cause we always winning and pinning the opponent
And we can identify the opponent as grown men
And can't none of them fuck with the TEN Boy

[Verse 2: Frosty Duplex]
I'm said fast and I'm furious
You niggas trash and I'm curious
And identify when I'm so fly into the sky
But I'm school like the blue like the blues clues
I'm so nice but I gotta be nicer, so I gotta be precise
On the beat when I go cause I realize its to steep
I gotta keep never borrow cause
I don't want to stop for tomorrow
And I'mma do what I gotta do to keep it true
So I'mma influence you to follow me
Follow me follow me
I'm the leader, so if you want to go down I got the liter
Liter, meter yeah I mistreat her
So I'm about to bag and I put it in the hand
I'm to cool for new school I'm on that
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on more
Two more, I sore, I'm hardcore
Cause I know I'm about to bring the bass to the freakin' floor
Put your hands in the air, listen up kid
I'm about to go ahead and feed you with the no bibs
I'm about to go in, I'm going in as I do
So I'mma go ahead and I'mma make sure I'm through
