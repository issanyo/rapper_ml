[Verse]:
Mopping up rappers don't confuse me for no custodian
I'm more wicked then Mr. Crowley is
Getting blown by two bitches who happen to be Estonian
God told me I'm the holiest
And the most sacred, I'm the Bull-Deity Apis
Know the secrets of a Freemason
Str8ridic, got your girl cooking in the kitchen
She even do the dishes, my name engraved in her apron
Home-cooked meal and it's amazing
This is the sweetest that victory has ever tasted
Pop some monoatomic gold, now I'm ageless
Just another soul taking part in the Matrix
Like the movie, haters come & step to me
Beat you with a gavel that I stole from Judge Judy
My raps are always rude see, and I never say excuse me
It's pretty clear that this lifestyle suits me
Frame like Goofy, I'm Yeshua on Lucy
On Tuesdays I fuck a bitch named Ruby
She pays the fee for the D then she leaves
Mentality of a G, my dope-dick ain't for free, ho
When you spell my name don't forget the zero
See the three eyes hidden in plain sight
Jumping from the free-throw line like my names Mike
Now I'm dunking on these rappers with insane rhymes
They say I'm out my mind, astral projection
They both didn't know that the cattle was infectious
Now he got cancer, she got cancer
We all lookin' for answers to the problem that's presented
You and I are lab-rats being tested
Eating this ice cream, now I have to see a dentist
Dom's a menace like Dennis
My presence lights up the room like Edison's best invention
I got more drive than a brand new Lexus
Determination hides behind the mad cool essence
Grabbing full attention, so I can teach you lessons
Spitting that ancient knowledge hopin' you get the message
Lyrics always literal
Drinking on some water, fresh taste from the minerals
Inhaling in the Prana
Flow remains hotter than any volcano's lava
A real mobsta, they don't know where I buried Hoffa
Y'all still searching, I'm like why bother?
It's the monster, born without a guilty conscience
Bout to take the game by storm & that's a fucking promise
