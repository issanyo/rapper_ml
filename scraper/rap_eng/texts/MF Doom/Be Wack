There are sounds coming out of these speakers, maaaaan

[Verse 1]
Grabbed a hand of cash, ashed a can of hash, blasted Acid Rap out the door
Back to record; fact of the matter is I’m rather bored with all of the chatter and hype surrounding this astounding rap-battling type
See I happen to be rapping wit' ease, so pass me the keys and get your ass in the passenger seat please
Or relax while I’m padding the stats
The free throws, east coast beast with three flows
Nah, I’m just trynna drop a tape before college
No apologies to all of my followers ‘cause I’m honestly hollering from the end of my rope
Had a hard drive crash, lost all of my songs and went back to the drawing board, to what I started for
I’m on a mission to get richer than Richie, digging a ditch for competition
Y'all must’ve forgot to mention when he diss his peers, careers disappear
When dutch touch the lungs, I blow the most potent
Opponents go ghost on the mic; no showing
Christ it’s a crisis, crowd’s hands up, it’s a heist
They ain’t heard nothing half as nice as what I’m flowing

[Verse 2]
We back and we back and we back and we back and
We back and we tracking these dastardly deeds
He’s a savage, a natural disaster, catastrophe
Averaging league-leading stats in three categories
Most rappers dissed
Most dope rhymes
And you know I got the best personality for sure
Best producer
That's four, you guys can't keep up!
I’ll tell you what’s scarier tho
There’s barely any rappers in this area code
You got one guy who thinks he’s a pro cause he dropped three tapes and video from Cherry Road
A rapper? Nah, you're trying to be a local celebrity
Name a song for Dupree, say you got heart just to get Soundcloud plays
You're in your third year in the game man, that’s not a good start!
These local boys ain’t half me
It’s so past me to name drop Trojan athletes
But if it were to be, I’m sure to be Worley
Or no worse, I spit amazing as Mason
Air raids, first place, none adjacent
For sure he’s complacent on no verses
Fist in the face of impersonators
Murder you on the verse and then hit you in person later
