[Verse 3: MF DOOM]

Swig more, here you go, a big pour guzzle
Put a plan together like a jigsaw puzzle
Okay, here it go, the big score, huddle
The fuzz'll never know what hit 'em with the muzzle muffled
Scuzz bucket, it's in the dufflebag, tuck it
And don't be scared to pluck it when it's time to make ducats
A lot of crews got cold feet
Hold the microphone like hold heat on an old beat
On a roll- brothers gotta eat -- whole wheat
Child not live on bread alone he need meat
Rice and beans at least, and that cost paper
You might wanna lay off the sauce before the caper
Whoever get in the way go bye bye
Aye Aye, Captain Fly Guy, I try
To catch it off a dry sip of Mai Tai
DOOM pry a penny off a dead guy eye-- (Just To Make A Buck!)
