[Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
It’s the maniacal obnoxious Messiah with the knowledge
You lame probably mocking ya like Galifianakis
My gallery is stocked I’m losing calories to rock
I’m the bad seed the last to speak the last to leave the block
I’m the last of a dying breed more bodies than a Chinese cemetery
I’m legendary with these rhyme scheme
Fled the city with eleven bitties they say I’m clever witty from the
Third world where some’ll sell a kidney
To trade places play the game of life with poker faces disconnect they
Shoulder blades your show looks like it’s overrated
Paranoid be thinking everything is orchestrated
Met Pharaohe Monch he only talk when shit is sports related
Incorporate a bar praise Allah I’ll pray tomorrow
I got your money son relax I’m a pay tomorrow
Garcia Vegas Gone to Vegas knew the God is major
You can stand right next to the man talent is not contagious
Confrontational slang my conversation’s banging
The bars cost gotta pay for those man with both hands
Behind my back without a note pad
I toe tag an adversary here you go hold that

[Hook: G.U.R.U]
Am I the target for destruction and is it the system and total corruption
I can’t work at a fast food joint I got some talent
So don’t you get my point?

[Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
Its diabolic how we die for the dollars why even bother
Being civilized surrounded by savages at the bottom
Like Sodom and Gomorrah chop it up in the tour bus
Depositing the cash watch the government extort us
Exploiting us dogging us out like Calvin Broadus
Life can get weirder than a Salvador portrait
Drop gems more precious than a dinosaur offspring
Grab necks sub-zero rip spinal cords off em
Fuck a metaphor get medical attention for em
They tried to give us crumbs but we never settle for it
Too much melanin will mess up the decorum they said
Could be building with one another but we warring instead
All mislead strings tied our arms and legs
The puppet master’s profiting until the target is met
We just numbers tax IDs social security black men die prematurely
Perception is reality what you believe is what is
Consumer more is what we feeding the kids
Using wire taps who’s on the phone move swift like brother Mouzone
Mistakes can be fatal from the cradle to the tombstone
To each his own I shine let it be known
Soul searching Sojourn until my soul reach home

[Akon]
The system in the America was never built for black people

[Hook: G.U.R.U]
