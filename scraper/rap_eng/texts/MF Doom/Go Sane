[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo
1,2,3, in the place to be
Having a P-A-R-T-Y
Check me out now

[Verse 1]
Whoever dare to follow
Eats humble pie with merde gelatto
Nowadays you can buy a Rothko at a Costco
News is entertainment even if its gloom and doom
Customers create by mixing up what they consume
Like a DJ
Lichtenstein picked a time to hang comic books on Broome and Broadway
Marketplace lies at the crossroads
Ads are better products cause they cost more than the show

After maximal fragmentation it's natural to converge
Church and state merch is hate, that's why they should never merge
I advocate for abstinence when it comes to cocaine
The brand is recognized by color scheme even with no name
In a crazy world it's difficult to go sane (Go Sane!)
Hurts no worse than the curse
Of habits that don't work
Or to burst on stage completely unrehearsed
These basement tapes are savin' grace from chasin' papes

Ass-fuck with brass knucks
If you pluck my last buck, pickpocket
I'll rip your balls from out your dicksocket
And combination lock your lips for shit talking

My rhymes stick around like a cold sore
How come Mead don't make unruled notebooks no more?
I don't like the Russell one
Cover the color of bubblegum
Plus the binding always comes undone
I'm so New York, I changed my number to 3-1-1
Try starvin' and you'll prefer eatin' by wide margin
MC Paul Barman presents a tempting fall bargain:
More knowledge in one song then the next man's whole album

Fluffers drool gladly
Suffer fools badly
It's hard to pardon a fool
Comin' fresh like shesh besh
That's the cardinal rule
Fake purist is an undertaker
Thinks he's an operator
My wife had to explain that if we were all innovators
Then the systems would stop and quit
But the system's a fallacy
Reality's duality, My theory of opposites
Biz Markie clowned around, was really in charge
Jay-Z comes Joe Schmo, google plex extra large
Clinton dodged questions but watch lies bounce past the gate
Whereas Bush spits opposites, shits smacks in your face

You swear you'll never bitch like your grandmom
But an opposite pole defines the plane that you stand on
So how to create an idenity you're proud of?
All those threats just beg for loud love
The hitman's a chump, the boss keeps the riches
Gunguy takes risks, first to sleep with the fishes
KERPLUNK!!!
Doublepump's only power for gutterpunks
It's harder to run the factory for Puffalumps
New kid on the block, Glock locked by Euclid
Hook it up
And if you don't know, Look it up---stupid
