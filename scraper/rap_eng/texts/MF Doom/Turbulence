[Intro]
This is, your captain speaking
We will land in about 40 mins from now
So sit back, and suffer in turbulence

[Chorus]
Can't get this high without my permission
Ain't got supplies to land this distance
Either got bars or you speak that real shit
Ether one song but you album's missing [x2]

[Verse 1]
I'm trynna out rap my last track
Raised in a place, where real bars get whipped at
It's jenga, pull one and your whole block goes down
This a battleground where askals hound, hear two sounds
Me hittin' you and you landin' the floor
Unconscious these bars grilling you raw
You boxed in ain't no hotshot can deliver
Crumpled paper ran out of ink and all jammed up
Lines ain't even straight without stanzas
Only eating rappers for breakfast
I spat eulogies to they families
Flip the message
Spit at their grave, to hear each sentence
Done with phony fans cause, they ain't receptive
Get your wig pushed back slump
Fake hair, wait too political
Fuck it Donald Trump, ain't trynna be subliminal

[Bridge]
Dig deep in rap just to find minerals [5x]

[Chorus]
Can't get this high without my permission
Ain't got supplies to land this distance
Either got bars or you speak that real shit
Ether one song but you album's missing

[Verse 2]
I control the world with my thumb to destroy
Crushing ants A to B bout to blow in this Game, boy
Y'all ain't ready skills grow
And these words scar overtime like a Keloid
Your hand shaking on the pad no light at the end
Carpal Tunnel, want me to stumble but
Following a psyco's path
Think Training Day instead it's a blood bath
Watch the shotty blast while the cops raid your stash
Family's house full a gas, throw a fucking match and
I shoot at it with a rambo gat
More corleone than Simba
(Pew Pew) advanced gun, Galactica
I done fired more people this season than a manager
Think they dead grab the ecg

[Chorus]
Can't get this high without my permission
Ain't got supplies to land this distance
Either got bars or you speak that real shit
Ether one song but you album's missing [x2]
