[Verse 1: Mikey]
A sick spitter equip with a slick wit and fitted with all types of abilities
No zen I'm sin free this is simply my last basket empty
So I take a shot/and lay a track on a doom beat
The movies and television fuck with your inherent visions
Leave you on the wire to dry like hella pigeons
Guess I'm hella ignant with Cinderella pigment
Rockin an umbrella in the trenches so bombs can
Miss me and I can hit speech and diction
Syntax with thin raps and thick bitches
I don't take pictures 'cuz I am invisible
Metaphysical Democritus with anatomic visuals
And I'm highly touted as a bout it individual with no rituals I'm mystical
Ludacris spirits livin' in my crystal box
Sad sister an her sister livin' in my closet

[Verse 2: Mikey]

Id just like ya try to look beyond the spectra
Something unexpected shouldn't frighten should enlighten you
To hit the Buddha till you see a sign of your investment
And see dividends in the live stock invested
Infested with crooked crooks with no defenses
And flashes of brilliance and letters from Mensa
But triple nine Mikey been resilient
Offensive protective destructive familiar and distant
Illicit within visions divine intervention
From gods my saliva affect your decisions
I spit like an infant that's quick in the instance
To grab all the cash and dash like a Kenyan
