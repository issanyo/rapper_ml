[Intro]
Follow the light. The light is your guide
I am controller of Planet X (Three-three!)
And I've invited you here to discuss something that's very important

[Verse: King Geedorah]
King Geedorah, take me to your leader
Quick to claim that he not no snake like, "Me neither"
They need to take a breather
He been rhyming longer than Sigmund the sea creature
Been on Saturday feature
Pleased to meet ya
And came to wake you up out the deep sleeper, like
He needed to stop before he caught the knee-drop
Even give you more zip-zip than ZZ Top
With full beers thou shall not ball corner
Geedorah like, "One more steps, and y'alls goners"
So-called rich, front if you wanna
When he spit electrics don't be in y'all saunas
He only here to warn us what the plan is
The hour is upon us, shit's bananas
Born alone, die alone, no matter who your man is
Hope he live long enough to tell it to his grandkids
King Geedorah, three-finger ring fever
Spring chicken eater, ID'ed as the ringleader
Who needs a heater? Catch 'em with bare hands
These same hands that make razors out beer cans
His own biggest fan
And got a fan base as big as Japan
Uh, yeah? And?
All hail the king, and give him three cheers, fam!
Like "Hip, hip, hooray!"
Do his thing for the little kings like Sling Blade
To the grave, put in work like a slave
On how to flip scripts on the dipstick brigade
Rock 'em like "Sus-sussudio" played
Back when we used to rock the shag, no fade
This skilled trade like a tailor made suede
Hit the studio - and I'm paid
Half upfront, half upon mastering
"Would you like that in cash?" Last thing you should ask the king
You don't have to be no crystal ball reader
Allergic to saltpeter, used to be a wall beater
In the game like a Wall Street cheater
A lot of rap noise is annoying like Cita
Turn into a triple-X monster from a fairy tale movie
He don't know me very well, do he?
King Geedorah, crush on the seed's teacher
They need to pay 'em better, she had nothing on the reefer
Heffer, and I had to offer her a stick of gum
She was as thick as they come, but taught a strict curriculum
Which is only good for my son
When I'm in the hood, razors on tongue
Nowadays it's amazing raising young
Rule number one: Keep your fazers on stun
