[Verse: MF DOOM]
The rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd
The best emcee with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the Tec-9 holder
They've bit, and don't know they neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitter ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint, get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not an act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back, clack, clack, blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra, chart topper
Start shit stopper, be a smart shopper
Shot a cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let him spit the venom said him got a lot of shit with him
Let the rhythm hit 'em, he still can hear his brother voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butter-moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me, the dough rake
Daddy, the flow make her fatty shake
Patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' "thank ya ma'am" an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks, hot enough black
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot you? Ooh, got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, boast yo' skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast, Joe Schmoe's flow's ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose NoDoz pills
Off sides like Worf ride with Starfleet
Off pride tykes now talk wide through scar meat
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he gets older he gets colder than a witch's tit
This is it, make no mistakes
Where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro
