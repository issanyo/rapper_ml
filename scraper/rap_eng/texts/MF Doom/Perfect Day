[Intro]
If I die today
It's gonna be the best day I've ever had [x4]

[Verse 1]
I ain't worry (I ain't worry)
Hurry into the pearly gates
So I.. (Oh ayee ahh)
Every batter ought to see what you god-ess
Some peace of mind (Babeh, babeh)
And I'm high in the sky yup
Don't bring me down
Bring me down
I be just fine
I'll deal with myself
Everybody'll be alright (Alright)
Enjoy yourself
Laugh at yourself
Everything will be alright (Alright)
Alright?

[Bridge]
Enjoy yourself (Enjoy yourself)
Laugh at yourself, babe (Laugh at yourself)
Everything will be alright
Alright?

[Verse 2]
You're lovely and I love you
Shit is cool, it's cool
You're lovely and I love you
Shit is cool, it's cool
Don't concern yourself what other people do
They do
Don't concern yourself what other people know (They do)
Whatcha doing now whatcha doing now?
I'm a fool for y'all
Whatcha doing now whatcha doing now?
I'm a fool for y'all (bitch)

[Verse 3]
What can I say, what can I do
When I can't make the pendulum move
Giving it ti-time-giving it time
Livin' ti-time-da weather that shine
Looking at you I'm bae looking at you
Making me wanna tip-toe on the moon
I ain't gone too soon
Have to start
To know that I can continue
Was on pause now I resume
Check the resume
Feeling fresh to death today
No one can bring me down
Except myself when I realize
I actualize

[Bridge]
'Cuz I'm sick of being tired and wasted
Feeling like my dream the only girl I am chasing
My mind like the rolls and vases
I wish that I could fly, I say what's up with the day
Before I fade away

[Outro]
If I die today
It's gonna be the best day I've ever had [x4]
