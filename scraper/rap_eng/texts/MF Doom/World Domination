[Intro: Rocky and Bullwinkle & Pinky and the Brain]
Now here’s something we hope you’ll really like!
Say Brain, what do you wanna do tonight?
Same thing we do every night Pinky, try to take over the world!

[Verse: May Rock]
Yo, on the scale to 1 to 10 I keep it a thousand
Ima beat the beat the up like it's Ronda Rousey
I got girls in my room, I call it public housing
And I take em all to bed, I pull up they blouses
I've been real motherfucker since day 1
Bottom of my shoes been blacker than Akon
You been hatin on the squad, that's a hate crime
Cause Mason attracts hoes like a Drake song
Yeah, fuck the world, finna give it a baby
People lookin at me like I've been the fat Slim Shady
Got sharp shooters in OKC like I'm KD
Livin my teenage dream, and you can really get it Katy
I'm back in this bitch like we friends with benefits
She blew me like a cartridge from the Sega Genesis
Get the money stack it up like it's Tetris
Get them bitches, pretty face with the elegance
I don't like short haired girls Ellen Degeneres
But I like the blonde girls with intelligence
Fuck a hoe, even if she got a boyfriend
I'm the shit, and all I need is a toilet
This World Domination, yeah you're tuned into my station
Coming to you live this a fucking celebration
May Rock been real, no negotiation
And I'll ride this beat until my fucking graduation
Flow dilating like my pupils
I told em keep it neutral, tell em no beef like noodles, pause...
I tell em no beef like noodles, get em, get em
I kill the game got people raising an eyebrow
I’m constipated, I gave no shits for a while now
You talk shit about me, bitch please
Call me a faggot, spell it right, got way more than 2 g’s, jeez
And all I wanted is the cheese
I don’t save a hoe, they don’t call me Hercules
Girls they turn on you, like 180 degrees
I don’t play no games and that’s word to Cailee D
Live and learn that shit made me better
Man it’s a cold world I didn’t need no sweater
Yeah you cut me out your life well I guess you made one error
EG Unit we something like Pro Era
Been keeping shit up on the low since I was 17
I’m dead sick boy, I need some promethazine
And I’m making all this cash, shout to Kellie G
And my checks don’t bounce, it ain’t no trampoline
You know I’m straight to the point like a safety pin
And I’ve been getting to the money, where the fuck you been?
All this white around me, like where’s the snow man
Get money now, fuck a five year plan
They say thugs cry, I never shed a tear
And they say life’s a bitch, she’s worse than Britney Spears
My tape drop like an earthquake, you’d think I was Haitian
Bow down this the World Domination

[Outro: May Rock]
Who the fuck passed you the mic?
'98 till Infinity
