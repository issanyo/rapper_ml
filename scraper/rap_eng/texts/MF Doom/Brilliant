[Verse]

A walking stereotype
Big, fat, white male and I'm ready to fight
If you'd like, I'm taking on adversaries tonight
So drop chery-shaded blood when I bury my knife
In you
Find a female I will marry tonight
Politely fill her with sperm
So she can carries my child
It's brilliant
Working for the enemy's nice
I mean a paycheck
My inner rebel's barely alive
He's a civillian
Look down my ignorant eyes
The train of thoughts can't arrive in the village of lies
I'm the corrupted media's illegitimate child
It's been a while, since I got wings but I am not willing to fly
I'd rather watch TV 'till I am truly dead
Wishing I was Louie C.K. or Hank Moody's friend
The movie ends and I am scared cause I am losing my health
Nicotine, alcohol and illusions of wealth
My mind's polluted an death's breath away
Pop pills like a maniac, chase the stress away
My head's spinning like I am doing ballet
Yeah, what a shame, interesting how we messed up
Yesterday
And rape tomorrow with no condom on
Then we start to ponder, where's the problem from?
But, we get a new Ipod, Problem solved
Civilization's going strong, fuck the starving ones

[Hook]

You don't know shit about us
We don't no shit about you
It's just you're not vivid enough
An image on the news
Vanish when the TV's off
There is nothing real about you
You see, the meaning is lost
And we are just animals
You don't know shit about us
We don't no shit about you
It's just you're not vivid enough
You're just image on the news channel

[Verse]

It isn't enough to get us interested
Fuck the hero
Let us suck on the villain's chest
'Till he spit some money on me
Give me a check
Corporation, you are growing on me
Give me a raise
And I will work for your praise
'till the end of my days
My workspace is a horror story
Cubicle maze
This environment is wrong for me
I'm in a haze of a paperwork
And a part of me thinks I'm a slave
And it feels I'm restrained in invisible chains
This mundane office harmony's
Killing my brain, like:
La la la lalalalala la la x4
