Who got the most whips gats and cash?
If you ask the villain, he say who gives a rats ass
Can't take it wit'choo you when you breathe ya last
In the meanin in between pass that grass
Give thanks, his rank is that of big stank dank
He often'd time drank by the river bank
An kept a silver shank, for a calm cat
Always stayed strapped for hand to arm combat
For DOOM the bell tolls
Let them fools know ain't no more room in these hell holes
It's filled up to the brim wit sold souls
Crackheads dope fiends an 40's of ol' gold
Hold up, the boldest who ever sold it
Whoever dare roll up, prepare to get folded
Like holly hobby, gosh golly gee
The back of hector hoskerish's trolly red wash me
Dag nabbit, the mask is like a chick magnet
Some'll let you stab it for a nic' of the babbit
They say he talk slick like Dick Cavett
A fiend for the mic an can't kick it like a sick habit
Give him a hero's holla
Along wit more free dough than Creflo Dollar
Holy toledo how he make base on the today show
They say he wear a mask in case his face show
It's better than a stocking bird brain
Find him on the corner rockin mockingbird lane
He's a odd man grandma
And she's a bad mamma-jamma either squeeze the damn hammer
Or stop complainin, on the top he's remainin
A lot of pop sensations need more proper home trainin
The people say he's the nicest
He only wants to be left alone to his own devices
If the price is right he might sing a new smash
Then laugh an twist his Rollie Fingers moustache
Tear ya crew a new.. gash
An prepare a new batch, of his own special herb goulash
Villain, the dork who talk funny
An he'll put one in ya, so watch where you walk money
Like Semy say, do more boomers, they cure tumors
And beware of the Doomsta
