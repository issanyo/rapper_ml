[Verse 1: Skittie]
Keep my career pushing
Like the boy forced to go to war
The boy that the other kids called poor
What if i were to tell you the boy made it hella far?
But in reality he didn't
Not spared by the others
Killed of the like the dry paint on your door
Why sure its all fiction
The fake bitches will still use it as a selfie caption
If you don't believe me check the @
Basic fake bitch 03
With the bio of the same day old new age hoe
I've established them as the John Doe of new street corner hoes
My personal biggest foes
The cops go after these corner standing hoes
But would rather off and chase the innocent colored man
The corrupt white man needs to stay at hid own pace
They'll give the guilty man freedom on the case
But a man of another race?
Elimination
Faces the governments twisted discrimination
The distant face of the watchful eye of the fake savior
Pave the way for the youth of today
Forced to watch and listen to the fake shit take place
Taught mass hate against another race
To spit it right to their face

[Verse 2: Skittie]
But you know
It goes with the flow
The Skittie Show
Exposing the fake
Slaughtered them down by the lake
Kids being fed lies
Like clowns and their cream pies
The law of the land
Actually ran by the man that can pay your bitch to jack him off with his old man hands
Don't ever trust the man
The lust of his money
Leaves you in the dust
Throwing you away like last weeks funny's
Blowing you off like your unloyal bitch
And that rich white
Let the lights dim down
As the mourning family's frown
The whole town cry's
As to why the man Dan
Had a problem with the young tan man
The young tan man who blind to believe
That the hatred was real
While the man named Dan
Claimed that the innocent young tan man ran
With the wind of a fan
So the gun shot off
And now the family's mourn
With scorn in their cry's
As another young man dies
And another guilty man named Dan runs free
