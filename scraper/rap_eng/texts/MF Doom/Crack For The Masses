[Verse 1]
Nigga welcome to good raps
The champ is on the mic and he spits shit
The killer on the loose finna' kill beats
It's deeper than hip hop, I'm feedin' dope rhymes to the masses
I'm comin' up slow as molasses, my times near
...Uhn, I'm -- Iller than sick pups
I be on my iron man air missiles fly as fuck
The dope crew ain't no point in even trying us
Fuck shady deals ain't no labels gone' be buyin' us
Desire to spit ill shit
Thinkin' out the box, I be on that hella real shit
Blast through the speakers as I'm rappin in these sneakers
And these NB's got a nigga rockin' foreign features
I be jammin' in these beat by Dre
And I'm know for makin' beats by the day
I'm a rapper by night
Better beware cuz' a nigga be on the come up
I'm cuttin' niggas off and ain't' no room for a fuck up
The rappin' ass genius, yall rappin' is tedious
Denim with the creases, higher volume than speakers is
Top scorer, ballin like small forwards
Beat pad bangin' on dope MIDI recorders
I'm enlisted in an army full of emcees
Thirst for the fame, they talent is half empty
Keepin' every verse 100 like two 50's
The labels still sleepin' they continue to be picky,FUCK EM!
I don't think that they could handle the reality
And I sneeze when I hear you rap it's the allergies
You spittin' the BS this is recess
And I'm on the job so just ask me "where the beats at?"
When it comes the instrumentals, Ima statutory
Rape it, and pay the engineer to fuckin' tape it
And get a disc jockey on the stage just to scrape it
I'm tryna blow up but my head ain't gettin' inflated
Too many emcees thinkin they killin it but isn't sick
Them niggas bite, but I bite back back I'm venomous
Friday the 13th, Mask on killin shit
Bombs over Baghdad , blast in the villages
Modern Vintage on that Wu Tang Roots shit
The rhyme scheme have a nigga lost lookin clueless
Gimmie' the mic, gimmie' the loot, gimmie the instrumentals
I deliver a brass knuckle to yo fuckin' dentals
Forever laced in the cleanest threads
Make a nigga reconsider everything he said
Bodybaggin' these sixteens with ease
I rip spleens in these SB's and raw denim nigga
They hate hard cuz' a nigga spit
They said I should stop cursin' but I said, "Fuck censorship"
Aw man, what's the plan tryna' cop?
What you got?
Man I got the dopest rhymes on the block nigga
