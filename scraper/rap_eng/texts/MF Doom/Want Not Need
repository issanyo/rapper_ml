Wrapped, Packaged
Pleasing to the eye
Advertised, Brainwashed
You're ready to buy

Want not need
Consumer greed

Don't know where it came from
And don't really care
As long as there's more
As long as it's there
Everyone has one
Why haven't I?
Saw it on TV
Just gotta buy!

Want not need
Consumer greed
