[Intro]

I'm goin harder than these motherfuckers think they can
Man to me ya'll might as well be spittin "Sam I am"
Weak rappers pollute the fuckin' internet
An whats funny man is they think they'll ever get a check
Fuckin' funny, ya'll ain't even got the money
To buy your own mic or gear, gotta ask dad and mummy
I'll put it bluntly, put the fuckin' mic down humbly
Cause if I ever hear ya name, you'll fuckin' leave the country
I'm feelin' funky, so fuck pullin' punches
Man I'll say one more thing, whack rappers, c'mon do something
Cause I think we could always really use a good laugh
And man your music, that's fuckin' laugh tracks
That's a sad fact, but sometimes truth hurts
But anyways man I've been spittin for like three years
And I'm making ya'll faggots look like started yesterday
And that you fuckin' get hammered on like three beers

[Outro]
