Just because you think that you're gorgeous
Doesn't really mean you're flawless
Just because you think that you're gorgeous
Doesn't really mean you're flawless

[Verse 1]
She didn't want me nah
She didn't want me nah
Sipping a PBR and a cigarette
I feel like a star
Lick battery acid just to get a charge
Positive take away negative

You are the one I wanted to get lost with
To find myself with
No matter lets skip the chit-chatter, lay down
Make love, take drugs
Get a buzz, feel numb
Go down in a ashtray
Dry leaves take long to figure out what I want
I had it all but then I lost it
But I figured that's what I wanted in the end
Never show when its time to pretend to be grown men
And women who want children who are like them
But sister so sister so you is a Ghost a ghost
I want to be dead like you
Can almost walk through walls like you
I would be glad to go to hell along side you
Just to be with you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's true i been the kind of cat
To worry where he left his tracks
In the house, in the apartment
Where it's dark my head can draw up thoughts
Where it starts, having no clue what to do
But to eat my stale food
Like saltines spit them off (?)
The only components in the cupboard
That can take away my hunger, thirst
Water is the healer, but liquor is the dealer
Gaze at the mirror for hours
Till I look for Minnesota
Alone so alone nobody home
I got to go
Back in those summer days
Mine was like a maze
No get away car could take us that far
Just, only to the forest
And we dance around and undressing
Laugh at Ouija boards and dark lords
Take us through the portal
And we become immortal
All these emotions to sort through
Bitch look what you put me through
Back no matter how demolished my old self come back to you because
