[Verse 1: Pilot]
Beef platters, I'm flattered you eating off chattering on me
That's pussy, you chatter box, see I'll erase your matter shortly
After this verse finish and devour you corny rappers
I'm so hungry, I'll eat the wrapper too
Shorty throw it backwards, so I don't need that quarter back, sir
I'm pure and sure she'll want to see me again, tomorrow afternoon
Sent her home before the sun set, she sent a text saying, "We should be together staring at the moon,"
But I said, "The weather sucks. My idea is better, hun, you should just send me nudes,"
She said, "If I did, I bet hella niggas will envy you," she already knew, they already do
Practice led me to mixing my bars with catchy tunes and honeys escorting me to empty rooms
Smelling like sexy perfumes, leading them directly to wanting me to get in between like interludes
She wanted to cuddle, said it was chilly, I said it'd simmer soon, she was shivering too
Sweet like Winnie The Pooh honey, but bitter too like the clitoris do something that trigger you to act like a fool
And when that bitch bugging, wrap you in cocoons, you gotta tell her, "Holla back, boo," niggas that dap you wanna trap you
To find me, you need GPS, almanacs too, stoned like statues, hoes might jack you, ejaculate or grab the cake out your stash
And leave you with frosting, and the salad you'll soon get tired of tossing, and flee with a gee who's balling to Palm Springs
I don't trip over small things, reign hard and cold, that's hail, all hail to the king,
Turtle beat the rabbit, but snails left chem trails that make you feel weaker every time you exhale
A bright speaker who break the speakers he speaking through, shock the world like Pikachu, parasitic friends, I got at least a few
I bet the leech is you, ill beats unleash this new side of me, when my speech is through, you'll wish you had a clearer and cleaner view
Of the spirits inside of me cause I rap solemnly, three sides to every story, it's hard to even call me isosceles
Even if you saw Solis cross the street today, you don't want beef with me if you don't eat filet mignon and can't slay King Kong
And your mind's to easy a book to read, and you're still attached by the time the hooker leaves to bring the gwap to my team
You a duck, I'm the chosen one, a goose amongst a few geese, elegant whip with two seats: what I dream to ride
Put ducks in a bucket of grease to fry, ready for war, only we survive, lost soul roaming with Caesar's pride
I wrote this verse in my leisure time,
Supply dope lines to loyal customers, when it's re-up time, I gotta see my supplier
Visit my mind to see how to take these people higher
Use it as a catalyst, say I gotta get a grip like pliers
Now I have calluses and blisters, sour piff sparked, I'm Mr. Spark-A-Conversation-With-Shorty-And-Her-Sister
Slash world domination obsessive, on the hash, fed hash browns by a shorty that's red-skinned, how does that sound?
Wipe off my Elevens and act a clown with my bredren, the torch and the black crown has been passed down
The word "classic" is thrown often, I sat down on the throne, inhaling dro, coughing
Soul in the ozone, enemies in a coffin
Soul in the ozone, enemies in a coffin
Soul in the ozone, enemies in a coffin..
