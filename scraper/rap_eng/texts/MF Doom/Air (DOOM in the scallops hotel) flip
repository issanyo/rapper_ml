The beat is sicker than the blood in your stool
The way it repeats can trick you like a stuttering fool
Uttering butter king jewels
His mudda been cool
Schooled on how to wash away the crud in the drool pool
Made his chrome dome glisten
At first he couldn't tell she had a chromosome missin'
Kept a spare somewhere
In these underwear, he swear
To help her get the gum out her hair
They need to get they thumb out they rears
And show some skills the one time they come out in years
Instead of dumbing out in fears of they own shadow
In a game that swell 'em up to dead 'em like cattle
Take your rattle and skadaddle
Before you get a whipping with the pen and pad paddle
Ghouls, got 'em modeling gear
He came with more rhymes than molecules in the air

Ghouls, got 'em modeling gear
He came with more rhymes than molecules in the air

The track was like a thorn in his back
As for the rhymes, I'll give y'all fair warning, it's crack
Whoever start smoking, come back
Quit or catch a heart attack up in some bum shack
Sharper than a thumb tack
His body was a temple made of chemicals to the dimple
To him still, it wasn't so simple
Kept his right and left hand beefin'
One knocking teeth in, the other one chiefin'
But first this song'll make you wanna stomp ya ten toes
Swooped up hooptie Pinto off a pimp my whip
Before they put the system in and had it all stripped
It ain't no need to trip
Indeed he ripped scripts from here to Jebip
Get a grip, leave it a dag mess for beer
Burning like a bag of swag cess in the air

Ghouls, got 'em modeling gear
He came with more rhymes than molecules in the air

Ghouls, got 'em modeling gear
He came with more rhymes than molecules in the air
