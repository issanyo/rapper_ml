[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
They calling me the newest teen prodigy now
Sixteen with big dreams, the world's finally found
The next guy to be crowned
Still I frown because I'm drowning in stress
The amount I've allowed to devour my chest
It's just off the meter and leave a Batista diva
They see a kid eager and swear that he's not a leader
And I need a reliever
My mind's going through cyclones
When others mind-blown like minds in fight zones
He might go psycho trying to top Michael
But I know my rhymes pyro and won't spiral
Unless it's vinyl, still it feels like a curse, it hurts
To know a verse could lead to me in a hearse
Hate's first, they'd rather see me fail than succeed
That's why I'm alone, on my own with no team
Don't need no green though I got some to spend
In the end, all I really need is a friend

[Hook]
I'm so, so alone (so, so alone)
It's just me by myself (I'm so, so alone)
It's just me by myself (I'm so, so alone)
I said I'm so, so alone (so, so alone)
I'm so, so alone (so, so alone)

[Verse 2]
Wish I could find someone who cares just a little bit
Enough of being home and alone, I've grown sick of it
Thinking different so nobody wanted to stick with him
And chances getting slim because money finally made it in
And I can't pretend like I don't hope for friends
But I hold my goals and others hold they tens
Whether gats, crack or weed, it can't be me to bleed
I got a mother, a sister and future seeds to feed
Believe that I'ma get it done, I'm pleading to see some fun
Not even on the run and still I'm home thinking in the sun
In need of some one or thing to bring me up
I'm stuck, yup, I wanna film stuff but get tough lucks
Cause there's no cast, just me (just me)
Always just me (just me)
I know what I could be but what's the use of being the king
When we die anyway and we could die any day

[Hook]
