[Verse 1]
Look, lets get this show on the highway
No time to play, I've been up like fire escapes
Late night writing like poets, in fine space
I'm feelin' like a hero all I need is a fire cape and I'm straight
Then you can call me Mr. Emperor the greatest kid
Then shredding competition like G's when they're grates
The one that they say is rude till' they see him in his face
And notice that his intentions pure as the 9th grade
I need a Mother Theresa to be my new babe
I be father [?] as we lead new slaves
I walk Earth, reading the signs like new waves
I used hurt building inside to make raves
Like the legion that I placed em' in, when I'm goin' ten
I got em shocked, like tasers and surprising a friend
If you feel you got a problem don't watch and pretend
Because I got it on lock like I'm tryna defend
Cause I ain't never been the kind to depend
I could body the pen
It goes down like when politics ends
That ink lines help me travel time again and again
Like twisters, had to spin in the position I was in
Now everybodys' kid, and who would see vividly
Fuck it, I know its because I'm gettin' in the industry
So I don't let it get to me, I see it all differently
Could never let it set a nigga back like [?]
Double XL, ready yeah these tee's
Like the senior in the Freshman classes getting D's
Still I've been tryna be breathtaking like a wheeze
I can see, I'm boutta blow like it finna be a breeze
Peace!
