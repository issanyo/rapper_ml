[Verse 1: Mospants]

Spotless-rubbish ralph lauren attired up
Shining more than dwarf stars or cameras
Flashing on the stanley cup, im a bad black
Kid spitting gotchu stuck thats cavities in
Teeth latched to gums, dally pack the blunt
Son of a bastards son more cereal in his stomach
Victims to screens and dumbness greed, assumptions
Hitting green no xbox controllers no FPS running
Deadly as duncan on a path to a triple double or something
Diligently not giving fucks n what's a percussion? oozing
Like pus out of mosquito bites i keep it slicker than prince's
Hair burning the system down forrest fires, in the background like
Foreign wire tapping can you see my view............

Without thinking of a porno star actress cold sag running captain
Plus the bandit playing jack&daxter, drug passing pub antics dublin-
Drunken-smashed in, dooming kids i live in a wild house like dewey
Did, and jordy in the middle caverns of lyrics to lay when you lay
Lttle, serious and skillful, I keep it "Leaguel" til my head hits
The pillow bi$hes want our info, billing on rooftops giving you
Knowledge in loose spots, soothing with the usage of words thats
To hot, my rhyme schemes you knew not mospants my crew rock and my eyes red super-man's
Cape coz i used bong heavily overlooked know diddy kong? that last
Dose hit me hard, my last concern is a bitching brawd, all i need is
This weed&money and i'll be gone, a team was assembled since day one
Failures turn to pay runs, i stopped with the coldchains, now im in that
Fog got these rap kats on mute like lanny Ahhhh im spotless-rubbish mixed
With damage cause

[Verse 2: DaLLY]

They say i need counseling I already got an ounce of it
Mounds of piff woods unrolled big as control
They just control what we watch and what we know
But whos we? ready or not like the fugees
What do you see in the future
Body leuter as your tutor whyll hes riding on his scooter
Cop shrooms from cooter
Im here in the future and back to the past
Brewing bowls tassimo
Mos with the ronchy flow
Nintendo gadget then i go into the world with no soul
Walk to the store n cop me a zona
I used to be a pothead but now im a stoner
They contemplating im no one
But im a hero like shogun
My skills i show know one
You the purple cobras im the average joe bruh
Natural cures on the earth thats what i know of
Strategy to go up, the bandits get are doe up
Wake up and have a zute with my coffee no donut
Spin the ganstarr album n go nuts use captain falcon and smash bros
You know we got the gas up like esso
Lets communicate im like fuck text mode
We wreck those, unknown soph on steam like a kettle
Your team forfeits
Dont settle with a placement break out and make shit happen
Like me rapping its funny to most but not funny to mos
Coming from the best that i know
ASAP and the pros taking over new york whyll the leagues in the north
Robbed rob fords crack and used it on a track
Shoutout to MF DOOM
Dont forget the ALL CAPS (x2)
