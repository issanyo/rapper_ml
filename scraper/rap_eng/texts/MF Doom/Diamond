[Verse 1]
Never seen anyone fresher
I'm alone on this island
Y'all put me under pressure
But I'll come out a diamond
I'm not afraid to go toe to toe with the Giants
Knock them all off and prove that they lying
Cause they think they got the seat
When really it belongs to Zeke
Hottest nigga on the East
But I'm from Las Vegas
Making hits on a daily basis
Only 17 but achieving greatness
I'm checking shit off
I'm getting sick with my flows
I think I have a cough
I glow and I'm boutta blow
So I'm young but going for the top
So until I get there I will not stop
And I'll knock off anyone above me
Till I'm bymyself all I see is me
Till I'm bymyself all I see is Zeke

[Verse 2]
So they can try and hate
Doesn't make me less great
So I'm always straight
I ain't never late but I just wait
Cause yo boy is patient
I'm my own agent
Y'all on some evil shit
I'll call you satan
But we all about love
As for the hatred I had enough
Cause I'd rather talk about real stuff
Than rap about some junk
So y'all flow trash
Mine is world class
Like Michael phelps
If you stay true to yourself
And keep it real it does help
So I'll spill all of my thoughts
Til the whole world applauds
They love my songs call me Cupid
I got verses so ill it's just stupid
Future looking really solid
I feel like I'll get everything I wanted
So I'll go outside spoil myself
Come back in looking like wealth
Yo boi looking like wealth

[Verse 3]
So when they talk about the team
I'm like a shitty barber, I can't fade it
Cause I just hate it
Like who is you to talk about the team
We the niggas chasing our dreams
My team tryna get Zeke on the scene
My team tryna get Zeke on the scene
My shit flows like wu tang cream
I'm one ambitious ass teen
With a dream to be iconic
Like Hakeem "The Dream" throwing up lobs to Kareem
I'm on my way to the top don't intervene
I be going so hard this shit's obscene
Work like this never been seen
You never seen anyone fresher I'm alone on this island
Y'all put me under pressure  but I'll come out a diamond
