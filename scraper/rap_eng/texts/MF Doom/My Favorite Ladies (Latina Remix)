Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Frangrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin everybody hit it
I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinnner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds
Little young thing, she likes to do the tounge thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin wit that white girl
She fuckin wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish
And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on
