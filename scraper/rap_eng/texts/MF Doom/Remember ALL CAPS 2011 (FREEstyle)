[Verse 1: Tommy Faucets]
All caps but I'm using all low case
Call me Ricky Henderson cause I’m stealing base
I got speakers with nice audio
I had a lot of water so now I got to use the potty though
Shots fired now we aiming guns at everyone's knees
Can you see I want to live my life peacefully
Straight facing hoes now everybody knows now we are ready to go
Straight slapping faggots with skateboards and they love me so they ask for more
On your way out please don't hit the fucking door
This is bullshit, fuck this music shit I'm about to call a quits
So the haters can hop off my dick
Coloring the pictures with Crayola crayons
Cause I never took advice from my that nigga Uncle Stan
10th street we ain't a clan
We a bunch a niggas who play in the beachy sand
I just put on a fresh pair of white socks
Why am I the coolest kid on the block
Accept my acceptance but ignore my last sentence
Who you impression
Bitch, just get the step-in
My day wasn't so bright
I got into a fight with a hairy dyke, despite that she had no sight
I'm getting very tired
But I"m going to keep going because I'm inspired
But what's really the purpose
If I’m going to just keep on cursing
And still not feeling my verses
I just am snatching purses and I'm getting nervous
I'm giving purple purples to all these sea turtles
And your hairline is receding like LeBron James leaving the Cavs and it’s that bad
Yeah 10th Street Bye
