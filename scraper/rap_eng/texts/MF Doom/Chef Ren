[One Long Verse: Renegade]
I bust bars to beats check the alliteration
Mortal Kombat defeats, Tekken obliterations
Is what these others will face if they get in my way
Tryna stop my shine with all that mental precipitation
Your brain's a little watered down from the fakeness
That garden hose-like mind needs a little greatness
Rinse it out, let Chef Ren serve you up a plate
From my lyrical buffet and fatten your mind state
3000 calories per day is what I'm serving up
It's written on a page hope this satisfies your urge for lunch
Now wash it down with punch, make it Hawaiian
I filled the famished with food for thought with my rhymin'
And rap's getting wack now I made perfect timing
An example for the youth when I'm in the vocal booth
I blurt these words out, through the gap in my mouth
And I'm speaking on the truth, not getting caboose
Although I want some, I spit this from my heart and not my Johnson
Earthquakes happen when I'm A-Town stompin'
A-Town meaning angels not yet in coffins
Wayne inspired me to rap, naa I'm just joshin'
I turned the radio off no need for shock jockin'
Listened to some Sade and got to lover's rockin'
The opposite of bra and bottle poppin'
I added special herbs to the recipe to get you mecha-chompin'
My rhyme books like a stove top cookin' up gourmet meals
Forget the others, 'cuz they nothin' but Foreman grills
It's like bacon grease how I let my ballpoint spill
Although the stove's hot, these flows give you shivers and chills
Go "Burr" like Gucci Mane matter fact grab the fur coat off of Pootie Tang
The opposite of global warming, apparently when my lips brush the pop picture rain pouring
I can go all day with the braggin'
Shoot you with some name tags with my Don Cannons
But I only got about a minute there's only one Popeye, there ain't no spinach left
I had to pause for a sec because I'm out of breath...
Oops I did it again, no Britney comparison and I'm going in
Less Lil' Wayne, more Errol Flynn
If you allergic to Ren then take some Claritin
'Cuz ima be around for awhile
Three minutes can't even explain my difference in style
Rapping means more than money to pile
'Cuz I can have my stacks fat yet nothing but frowns
Filling my face, rappers are road runners in a paper chase
Yet I take a steady pace remaining in first place
Infinitely rich in self worth
I'm spreading messages without MSG to boost your health first
Better than Boyardi, maybe even Uncle Ben
Aunt Jemima ain't touchin' this not even Chef Marilyn
I'm cooking up classics better than wonton
Soup ain't my specialty, instead check out my melodies
Musical veggies, call them Casey or celery
Better than Rachel & Martha is what they'll be tellin' me
Check out my rhyme book in the produce aisle
Ren's killing hunger pains bringing vegan's smiles
