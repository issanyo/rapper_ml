[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yea, that's right
It's not a Hardy Boy mystery neither
This is real shit
This shit come on right after Hart to Hart y'all
No doubt, 7 o'clock Fantasy Island
This episode is "Death to a Brooklyn Man"
This is Tony's Angels

[Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, it was 3 white bitches who worked for Tony Starks
Undercover agents far beyond narc's
Amazed by their beauty marks
Wonderwoman bracelets, knee-high boots that was made by Clark's
My dick got hard on how they spoke and shit
Every language was music to the kid as if
If I was modern day King Midas
Doreen, Sky, and Kelly
Starks Angels, Shaolin's Finest
Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn
Plus I played the whip real low
Cuz my face was woofin'
My Angels jetted outta Albee Square
Gun out, wrapped in they hair
Kinda crowded so they clapped in the air
Chase a nigga down, block for blocks
Squeezin' Glocks
These Mami's real anxious to blow off his top
He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar
The more they ran, the more they skirts got dirtier
Sendin' shots like Check Day
FedEx Express way
**Boom!, Bow!, Bing!** You heard the gun play
*Who shot the duck out the window*? Mr. Lee said
*Three pay now, you fuckin' weed head*
We can stop the fire, the suspect, he's dead
Then I pulled up - "Come on girls to Club Med"

[MF DOOM]
Stay tuned - The Villain Threes Company
Don't Sleep Part 1

2 Brown sisters assisted the Villain DOOM
He woked up, stoked like they was still in the room
Freed his right arm and leg
It was more like a sweep
Loosened his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet
Staggerin' except for the socks and mask naked
Grabbed up the boxers, fussin', pissed and
Checkin' for the keys, stacked
A robbery expected, yet nothing obvious is missing
Recollectin' now why Hollywood hotties
Stepped in Giuseppe Zanotti, personal nurse's
Chanel purses, she ok? shottie
Chased Patrice with Thai iced teas
She drive wild nice to Veggie Fried Rice Spicy
Told the Hoes "I don't feel so well, my belly"
Rolled down Melrose, "Drive me to the Telly"
"Ya'll go'head and get the L's, and get back, I be 'k"
Feelin' woozy, no oozy, who's seen the lobby? Ray
Peace! peace to man, change 100, stop and look
Naw! Whoops! Left a knot in her pocketbook
Elevator slow, "is I'm that careless?"
Entered the room and fell flat on the terrace
Woke up, dag, who bound and gagged 'em?
Got 'em for 2 out of 3 packed bags Magnum
Each gram of Villain sperm streets worth a G
The part of Mr. Furley was played by Charlie Murphy

[Outro: Ghostface Killah] & (MF Doom)
Fuck Charlie, that's right y'all
We go get back out there on the scene
Kelly you go get me some pussy
(To be Continued)
You know what you gon' do
You too Dorien
You lil fat ass can't get away neither and shit
Uh huh, that's right yea I'm call The Theodore niggas
Swat Team alert and shit
Uh huh, yea that's right
Sky you can't hide baby, you got the best head nigga
Word up, This real Angels shit, y'all my bitches
Toney Bosley in this bitch nigga, word up
Give me back my boots, motherfuckers
