[Red the Supergiant]
This speaks to me, now I'm 'a speak to you
I’m doing the best I can, I hope you understand
Listen

Most sending applications
He’s spending his two cents to be a sensation
Not to be not for me
Red rot to monotony the way he rocks the M-I-C
I see, ick he’s sick, first the block then the nations his
Flock to me
The hypocrisy I can see is tick tock to me
Matter of time, time matters to sheep, autonomy nominally
In all dishonesty, I just want to make sense/cents
Till they talk of me in past tense
This is for them on the fence, hence only the best
Best be jesting or bluffing cause the chest puffin nothing
This that holy shit spit that’ll leave the set blessed
I know you blessed me with a lot, moms, pops
And I’m doing the best I can to be best in land
Only shots I’m taking are at the far reaches of the universe
For what it's worth: while – I’m late for greatness I'm 'a still be the one to do it first
So why you so averse to a verse?
You say you know it’s a challenge, but when you only want one thing it’s hard to stay balanced
Forget a valedictorian or glory I’m writing to hear my story
But I gotta go to college for the knowledge and credit I deserve to go to work
Yeah you said it
All of these zealots
Maybe if I didn’t have the passion but I do
If I do you, what’s in it for me? And who’s who?
Dear everyone
This is history in the making
Stomach aching while I say it, when will I awaken
To my dreams, be on stage speaks quaking, knees shaking
I see seas of people in my sleep breaking they’re necks
I’m not waiting for what’s next I’m taking checks
Making treks
You better realize this life is idealized
These that seem to see through the scheme are demonized
But I’d rather live than be alive
So I may not see eye to eye
It’s only because my head is in the clouds
I vow to stay loud till I’m comfortable in my shrouds
If only I can leave one mind wowed
Then will I be a success?
I haven’t made much yet
But I stay up determined, haven’t strayed just yet
And I’m working till my sermons get sprayed on their heads
Till I’m rocking cross the country and the globe till I know that in my soul
I have proved everything that they said
Was nothing to me, nothing to me, nothing to Red
I’m not the rest, I didn’t rest, attest it till I’m out of breath
And by then they’ll all  be shouting it out of breath

It’s not for sex or to make sense/cents
Yo, I said it’s not for sex or to make sense/cents
Momma your little birdie is flying out the nest
