[Intro]
Cole Phelps: What have you got?
Patrolman: Looks like a drug overdose
Roy Earle: Get away from him, Phelps. This is my case
Cole Phelps: Courtney Sheldon was a corpsman, Roy. He served his country! He went out with a medical kit and an Army .45 and into places that made the Valley of Death look like a picnic

Shh Quiet
Shh Quiet

[Verse 1]
Verbal assassin I'm killing off all these actors
One shot pow(UH) there goes your faverouite rapper
Unorthodox… i don't like to rap in these normal stanzas
On acid like chance the rapper
A mogul come meet the master
Chyphers in the room with UD
Bumping Wu Tang Clan, Pac and Heavy D
Old school vans black on black keep my set clean Dope Chef like I'm selling dope to the dope fiends 
Stunting like a G in that Godly 
Float Like a butterfly sting like an Ali 
The swing from from king Make you fling to the concrete
UD BOYS we on the HOT SEAT
I keep it running like DMC
Read my lips like mr bean
Classy Lil lady I think I'll intervene
Smoke in the room bumping KMD
Whole team waved off that THC

[Verse 2]
Lets bring it back to the basics
I keep it running like asics
These fake mc's test my paitience
Have to dd for these haters
For da college drops no majors
Empty box no papers
I'm destined for fcking greatness
Hit one and now I'm feeling so weightless, counting presidents faced, my minds Taking me places, you niggas is so complacent, I know I just got make it, the look On my haters faces ha sending shots like Leo from the matrix Pow
