Orange blossoms with toppins
Of words with the beat
Make ya dance with ya feet yeah
It's prestige 10 rapper with words of defeat
Try to understand me speak
This is the
Rapp pharmacist versus a whole crowd of narcissist
Waiting to rip right through my cartilage
They need the cure
They need it fast
Telling this to the people like please read it class
Vince stapling these words in ya brain
Construction working on this beat was insane
Go against me? You fighting the wrong army
Consume you with a spoon I'll take it kon karne
Ima general
Very healthy mineral
One of kind person
People need me
Urgent!
A life saving surgeon
I'll help you if ya hurtin
Get rid of all ya burdens
Make way so I can open up the gateway
And get going on my straightaway and finally breakaway
Respect me like labor day
Till the day I Fade Away
Bounce back and ricochet
My raps are minute made

A lot of people want them longer
Like a movie scene where they barely show the monster
Tearin through a city like a lonely war monger
Its Concrete rap
Cause the wordplay stronger
Yeah
It's stronger then concrete
Fake rap loves you real rap is fond of me
Im steady coming with the raps of modesty
I stay so real that a brotha can not lie to me

Young hooligan
Tryna dropout of school again
And could've been a pioneer chemist like Percy Julian
When will real rap be cool again
I see these fake rappers speaking lies at age 2 or 10

You know I'm doing this
And always pursuing it
Flowing
Just like I'm ludicrous
Then I serve it like Stewardess
Im spreading messages
Are really catching this
Im that Anthony Rizzo
The infielder kiddo

Using all these beats like a number 2 pencil
I always get em free cause I'm not messing with a rental
Unexplainable brain
They say I'm goin mental
I'm probably better than you
Check your credentials

You know I gotta give the people more
It will get done just like it was a house choir
Never being fake I'm not advertised sponser
Cause One thing I know
"What is real will prosper"
