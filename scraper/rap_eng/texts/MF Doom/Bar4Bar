(Verse 1)

They always wanna kill my mood, seeing that I'm having fun, how rude, listening to Clairmont now I'm juiced up
Call me saturated cause I'm filled with inspiration why do people keep hating , man I really wonder
Soon they'll leave their slumber and understand that I am unraveling my plan to get cheese real early like the milkman. cause I'm a go getta aka a trend setta. No matter what Ill always do it betta
I know you're feeling this cause I'm killin it like I never did it
Too determined like a sermon dispelling these vermin
Running loops around these niggas like cursive
Trying to be real?  I think you need to some rehearsin
To the world I'm closed off like a circuit
But that means I got a nice flow so I'll always stay current
But, I don't know everything so I gotta keep learning
Trying to stay in my league? I think you'll need a permit
Cuz I'm spitting like a Llama causing drama with my mama wait, pause it with a comma
I'm the don like rama, Got juiced like jamba, neva been an informa, known as a realest nigga since the dawn of
Time as I rewind these lines I realize, I'm better than these other guys but people don't buy cuz
I is just a small dot compared to the line of other rappers
It's ok, I'll just knock em out after, It's laughter what I'll do to these actors. Whatever you're race just won't be a factor
Im back in this shit man, no chiropractor
This is real hip-hop, not some random banter
At the Homies house, that's the crib I be in
Floridian boy, roots from the caribbean
People don't care about their beginnings and only wanna stack money up to the highest ceiling
You thinking money is all your worth, well I can make you feel down to earth, let me put you six feet deep in the dirt
Think you're better than me? Oh that's just absurd
Because I'm am the shit, but don't call me a turd
That's what I prefer, real magician with words
Turn a greedy llama nun into an ugly lame nerd
InfiniteJam killin it on the track yo say word
You can love me or hate me but you'll surely respect me
Flows so icey I gotta call it Gretzky
Calling all ladys you can go ahead and sext me
Girl, that wasn't aimed at you, but you can bless me
Don't test me, or I'll be coming at you like some testies
Thinking I ain't right just because Im a leftie
Strong nigga, momma didn't even have to breastfeed
Girls tasting good and looking pretty sexy
Mmm delicious she tasting like knishes
Pretty nutritious even though she's hella religious, she said it's cause I'm different, I just think it's because she's ignorant
I'm vicious on the mic, I ain't even medication, so I'm always sick, no elementary school fakin so when I say I am the best, don't tell I'm mistaken
Imma make this count
Girls give me neck even when they have a spouse
If you cross me you gotta get up out
Spit flames like the sun, im always in a drought
Rare like stake you half baked fake, go back to your dollhouse
