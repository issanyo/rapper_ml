Someone walkin' in the rain
That's supposed to be an inner sun
Is that ... I like the deM, the demon
Inside, outside of my house
I'm the only one he sees, I'm the only one who sees him
Entering the grey
Was it destiny? I doubt it
Feel like I just woke up to sing about it

[Hook]
I heard some woman on the radio
Say the world gonna end and it's subliminal
Eleven o'clock, eleven o'clock, Eleven o'clock...
I heard some woman on the radio
Say the world gonna end and it's subliminal
Eleven o'clock, eleven o'clock, Eleven o'clock...

I hate when she says "nothing's gonna be alright
Sit right here, don't leave, don't breathe for me
I'll be right back." That's a lot to say, I think you're a liar
Feeling really shitty, I'm feeling really shot
Can't help but feel this impending doom
Like there's a man right behind me lurking in the shadows
Wearing a mask, and just like that my life [?]lasts[?]

It hurt you so bad, it hurt you so
It hurt you so bad, it hurt you so
It hurt you so bad, it hurt you so
It hurt, it hurt you, it hurt you so bad!

I heard some woman on the radio

Eleven o'clock, eleven o'clock, Eleven o'clock...
I heard some woman on the radio
Say the world gonna end and it's subliminal
Eleven o'clock, eleven o'clock, Eleven o'clock...

You're the only one who here, only one left
Everybody's left, exited out the entrance
Devil's lived here forever
Roamin' the streets, the beast with jagged teeth
Eating what's left of my unholy genes
Oh the irony, oh the sodomy, only one here left
"Where has everyone gone?"
I wondered as everybody slept
