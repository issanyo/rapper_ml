[Verse 1]
Veni Vidi Vici, Saw the game, conquered her and then I came
The pain I bring is equal to that of Brock and the Rock
I rock and I Don't stop, 187 the beats and not cops
In my town the streets and blocks hot
Niggas bein' hypnotic with the mouth can get you
Hit with the knuckles like Dr Robotnik
If they spiked leave a nigga bloody red, but I don't roll with
The reds or the blues, I formed my own crew, not a gang but a unit
We move as one and you'll be the next to get done son, we gonna run up
As we enter and gain fame faster than an olympic sprinter, usain bolt
On you assholes, time to get back to class hoes cuz you gonna get schooled
Don't be fooled by some niggas cuz they don't really life that life, but I'm
Bout it bout it so don't doubt it doubt it or I'll treat you like a Zombie in
New Orleans and you can get left 4 dead 2

[Hook]
This is lyricism, young nigga let the spirits in him
B.I.G. and L, I do this rapping very well
This ain't for the radio this for the mindframe
Money, Cars and hoes, they all playin' mindgames

[Verse 2]
Yea I'm back bitches, the guy from verse one
And you should like my music from hearing the first one
I'mma keep it conventional with the flow now, and stop
Commenting on the low down dirty leeches
That spend all their time on the beaches
A young philly nigga reppin' for his city
And I'm just stressin' how nobody fuckin' wit me
It took a while to hit me but like HIV the monsters
In my head are coming to life, want kids and a wife
And all that american dream rah rah, blah blah
But I'm holding down the garrison like SP elementary
On my next tape I'mma have something adventurey
A new flow I might have to invent for me
Like the bada$$, been waiting so long
You can say DB is advent and he
Spit so sick like he got the flu or somethin'
Cold flow, keeps the river cooler pumping
And the bass in ya car dumping
Nigga don't make me be a bandit and
Pull ya card like Gambit, guarantee you it'll be a trump card
And I'm the shit, I'll bring it to your front yard, little bitch
