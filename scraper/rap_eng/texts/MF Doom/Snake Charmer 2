[Intro]
Snake charmer, bringing to life
Like the candelabra, sing it tonight
Emerge from the dust, watching it rise
Celebrate the life and watch when it dies

[Verse 1]
Only to begin again
Ever change, still the same
Ocean tides throwing him off-course, still a game
Still in chains, freedom ring
Bells delayed, see him sing
Freedom song, only when he finds he doesn't need a thing
Damn, shit is complicated
Hearts getting confiscated
Jorge, take a pill and chill
Never over-complicated
Laugh out hysterically
Kurious pedigree
Top dog, monkey man
Putting it down legibly
Come correct, spot check
All right, it better be
Lot of nerve -- don't ever put them weak dudes next to me
Watch a few good souls refuse desperately
Never no agenda, services to render
Never no pretender, benefits to the sender
Gifts is in the giving
Riffs to make a living
Lesson learned on land that was stolen on Thanksgiving
New York's a playground, shouts out to San Quentin
Bendi song with all due respect
Bendi song the bill collector-slash-Pied Piper-skill-perfector
Umbrella, expand, catch some shade
Under the real protector
Take a deep breath, feel the pressure
Ah, on the exhale, tap the next nail
Seal the coffin; hope they get paid real often
Maybe all is just a dream
Paint a sea, see struggle
Leaks out his whole heart
Feel his veins bleed puddles
Now he's composed again
Chill like a frozen wind
? foes, ? and so it begins
Forty days, forty nights traveling across the sand
Awake like a motherfucker, like he high off a gram
Wish it would rain, eyes peeled on the thermostat
Muy caliente, he could feel the burns on his back
Learned the facts journeying
Moving like a meteor
Him and King Geedorah
Like it's the last beer call
