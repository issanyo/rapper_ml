[Verse 1]
If I die tomorrow please play this at my funeral/
I’m higher than the ozone this is just the usual altitude
Wether I be in or out of school
Breathe in and out keep yo cool that’s how I do
How I move is similar to an uzi
Bust off and spray blaze roaches like an oz a day
My flow be on cane cause I’m a bout blow
But for the moment I’m low and opponents are hoping I will fall
Always stay tripping never fall in abyss
You just stall I’m the shit – number 2
I keep a number 2 just so I can insure the W
When you hit fame they gonna try double you
Better double back –
A dub of green crack in the sac
Rolling in a beem
Who the fuck put this nicotine in my green
Get a smack – You wanna bee queen
Get a bigger buzz thats some smack
Backpack full of raps
Never paid attention
Hope I get paid for venting
I stay relentless
I say whatever I want – whenever I want
I’m better than ya’ll
Berretta to jaw – yeah she blew it
No crip unzip the file and listen to it
This is music in it’s purest form
Seeing unicorns from the purest form of LSD
And plus that L was sweet
And I think I reached the highest peaks
So high I beak – never flipped a bird
But I flip a couple verbs and some herb on occasion
Blazing till my eyes are Asian
