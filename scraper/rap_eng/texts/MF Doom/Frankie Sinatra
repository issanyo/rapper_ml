[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Off this rocker, he's off his rocker
Please, Mr. Officer, I only had some vodka
Little marijuana, just a few Vicodin
Only reefer swervin' out here while Iâ€™m driving
Where your registration? OG license?
Because of that interior, your bitch wanna ride this
Plate red bold cat, dick got LoJack
White hoes calling and they asking, "Where the dope at?"
What? Whatever
Modern day Sammy hit I wrote with that Sinatra
All for pasta, spray in her mouth like Binaca
Listening to salsa, rhythm of maracas
M.I.A. on the job sipping in Sri Lanka
I divide and conquer, roll with Willy Wonka
Baby momma wanna suck the dong up at the concert
And they gets no pay
Like Frank Sinatra, bitch, I do this shit my way
Like Frank Sinatra, bitch, do this shit my way

[Hook: Wilmoth Houdini]
Ah, Frankie Sinatra, ah, Frank Sinatra
Frankie, me boy, don't know
You have the perfect voice to sing calypso
(What did they say?)
Ah, Frankie Sinatra, ah, Frank Sinatra
Frankie, me boy, don't know
You have the perfect voice to sing calypso
(What did they say?)
Frankie, me boy, don't know
You have the perfect voice to sing calypso

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I'm so high, you're so high
If I take another sniff then I just might die
Take another sniff then I just might lie
Tell her what she wanna hear
Just to get between them thighs
Underground nigga, but on top of the world
Took the bitch for oyster, now my tongue on the pearl
So fuck what you say, do this shit my way
Like Frank Sinatra, bitch, do this shit my way

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Tanks of vodka, sip slow rocka, ock
Writ rhymes since the days with Frankie Crocker rocked
From more stocky stock
Known for his illy right hook to make Rocky block
That's no poppy cock pirate
We can keep it irie, or we can keep it irate
Dilate, we keep it one hundred
From the heights of Northern Lights to Southern Comfort One fifth, come with that headbanger boogie for that ass
Villain give a bully ten noogies for the cash
Or dash, dip slow on a marathon
Or maybe he gon' sing Calypso like Farrakhan
Or Frank Sinatra, mon

[Sample]

[Outro]
Pssss, haha!
(Fuck off, man)
One two, alright!
