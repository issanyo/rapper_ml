[Mister Fantastic]
It was back in the days when I met a brilliant student named DOOM
Hello? Anybody home?
Wow, look at that equipment
I wonder what DOOM is working on
Now I'll just rearrange a few of these circuits

[Dr. Doom]
What are you doing in my room?

[Mr. Fantastic]
You're even more stupid than I thought

[Dr. Doom]
Give me those papers

[Mr. Fantastic]
I just came by to say hello
But you'd better recheck those equations
You're off a few decimals
And that means big trouble if you use this material

[Dr. Doom]
Get out of here
