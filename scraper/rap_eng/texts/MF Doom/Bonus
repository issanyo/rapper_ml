I keep it formal
I keep performing
I keep it cordial
I’m a monster
I’m enormous
I keep a conscious
I keep a verse I’m competing like it’s a contest
I'm a monster with the comments I keep coming up with concepts
Plenty pastors unconscious hopeless
The dollar signs got they eyes wide open
I see the poison that they pouring in this ocean
It’s a potion pretty potent turn the globe into commotion
I keep an antidote in my pocket
You'd never catch me slipping with the knowledge
I keep a brain that seems to keep up with the content
Monstrous, swimming in a pool full of nonsense
Bruh, and ine see a nun since
Funny, cause we basically a convent
I see my people like to call these deacons clark kent
Giving sermons with no content
