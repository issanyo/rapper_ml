Krazy world, get it where you fit in
Choose how to roll, the dough there for the picking
Switch up—you’re stuck, telegraphing how you’re living
It’s all about me, all about you in a
Krazy world, get it where you fit in
Choose how to roll, the dough there for the picking
Switch up—you’re stuck, telegraphing how you’re living
It’s all about me, all about you

[Verse 1: Gigan]
Check the plan: I’ma bubble them jumbs, then I abolish ‘em
Been doing it since double-0-1’s with five dollars
Pinstripe knees and D’s in the side pockets
Keep it shining in Siegfried shirt with wide collars
See all these shots and bam-bam fed on Channel 5, I was
Scrambling, making sure them heads was satisfied with it
The meter inside the cut was just right, fresher
Than southern dubs, enough to buff pipes while I
Tell married chicks to suck mics and strips for
The bills and get ‘em addicted, prove all their skills
Straight pimping, mac daddy, ain’t nothing wrong with hustling
When the time calls for it, I’m puffing chron and busting, then I
Do shit to chicks some youngins call disgusting
Fuck ‘em in their butt then have ‘em suck off my nut then
Give ‘em all they need to keep turning out tricks
Put ‘em on the strip at nine, have ‘em return about six, then, uh
Then press the ho, pull a burner out quick, get
Moved on the low ‘cause rumors spread through word of mouth quick, and
Pimp hoes, pimp ‘em, lick slugs, lick ‘em, sell
Drugs, sell ‘em, mixing up turn you into a felon in a...

[Verse 2: Gigan]
Listen close: ain’t no doubt in the game
If a heater broke, they’re cutting a whole mountain of ‘caine
We still bagged up twenty-five percent, so they’re chopped
Up or they drop slow ‘til they fly up.  Open
Shop, buffed rims spread fast like bad rashes
Fall back with the gods, and they be badasses
As they come back, it’s pouring mad acid rain
Smoke an L, straight blow from them cells
Stash up, keep that dough for my bail
Plus a four-four with shells in case shit go to Hell
Reup on the hundreds of cash with two jammies
Plus the broad’ll transport the crack in her poonanies
Can’t pick the clique of a cat that’s too candy
Ride-or-die fam, those who wilds is my mans too
Tell it how it is: thug-wild styles plus kids
Money’s smart—don’t talk—just be chill, how these kids be
Down for the game since Gazelles and suede Pumas
Have them broads stashing the cash in the bra and the bloomers
Cock-blocking your spot with fakes, rocks, and ass-pimping
Know that you’re pushing this cash that we’re passing you

[Hook: Gigan]
Krazy world, get it where you fit in
Choose how to roll, the dough there for the picking
Switch up—you’re stuck, telegraphing how you’re living
It’s all about me, all about you in a
Krazy world, get it where you fit in
Choose how to roll, the dough there for the picking
Switch up—you’re stuck, telegraphing how you’re living
It’s all about me, all about you
