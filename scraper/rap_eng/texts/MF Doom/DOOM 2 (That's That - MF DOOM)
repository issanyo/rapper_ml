This is the voice of Zimbabwe

[Verse 1: Black Fin]

This was when the mask was brand spanking new
Before it got rusted from dranking all the brew
Need to join the crew, super quick, save the nation
Silver PlayStation player pad for my homie that I had
So emotional I am watching extra corny re-runs of Kablam
Nickelodi Brody
Secret agent like Cody Banks, getting the honey
Spending the money, waffles and honey, I'm pretty basic
Lets face it, if I was you...
You would most probably only listen to the DOOM
He got mad flows of the griddle
Built just like a samurai sword
Super hard, but damn you if you think he brittle
(Zimbabwe)
Spitting sour metaphors
But the punctuation sweet as a skittles
Mix it with Rubina
Drink it with your local drug dealer
But always remember to map the exit
Bless it! Like a pedo with a mission
Kicking chicken lines at wives who soul missing
Old dissing' penny deadly, Tunnybunny mad friendly
But you think i'm overflowing with envy? Na na!
I need to give it to the man
Always took my Hip-Hop IQ back to zero
I could never get my crumby finger on a comic G
But guarantee, Madvillain was the hero
And that's about the size of it
Beat-biters unite, but if you down with it
All caps, all caps when you say the man's name
And that's word to the Dumile
