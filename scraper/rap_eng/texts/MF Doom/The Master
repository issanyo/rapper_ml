(Who you think i am)

Pan to the left
Pan to the right

Turn my vocals up, My focus is up
My existence ain't fragile
Set you so far back
Leave you by the nile
What so foul about that?
Write a children's book, call it
Cat With A Gat
Ball up in the park with my hat turned back
I'm super like Clark Kent
Some of these fake MCs I leave on the pooper
Scoop em and throw em in the trash
Kiss my ass
Rhyme so sharp it'll cut you like Jack Sparrow's cutlass
Roast you like a carp
The last thing you want to do is play me like a harp
Mind so hard almost brainless
The thing is, I got heart corrupt by the dark
A ghost invisible, yet clearly despicable
If I go silent dont figure it's merely a miracle
Dig ya grave deeper
Nightmare on elm street sleeper
Freddy Krueger
Best won't feel if I hit ya with the ruger
Cause i'm a detective with the profile
Wild like the Savannah
Slip and it won't be a banana
But a man with a bandana, from Santa Ana
Stand up like a man if you are
Sneak disses at me bound to put you so far out of reality
Remember that I am the master
And just like that, your life can end up a disaster
Religious you are, ya better be a faster
Indigenous I am the last one
Break quasars
And like Kanye I shoot lasers out  of my eyes
In a fury, cause i'm a one man jury
And the only punishment that I know is death
If you live, you better find yourself as blessed
Genghis Khan and leave yourself with a lot less
I've been wanting to test to kill a man
Leave the crime scene completely spotless
Be telling me "I'm not this"
I rose myself on these platforms
Screw you I got this
Y'all going hilly, and i'm going mountainous
Amounting royalty checks
I got a handful of cards and you never know what's next
And the last thing that i'll ever do is flex
This ain't poetry text, real lyrics
You know you can feel it
Do more than just hear it
Like a magician I disappear
Adhere the indifference the Rhymemaster a magnificence
Light up a cigarette, call that a significant moment
Explosive like these bomb ass rhymes
On the cover of the people's times
The hip-hop mythology: I'm nearly a rap god
Not just part, but all of me
And 30 years from now i'll be dead or in the hall of fame
Remember my name, Rhymemaster Charlie G
The fresh arrival from the 503
A real MC!
