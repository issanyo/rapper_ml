Intro
I be fuckin rambling yo
Shit sound cool though

Verse
Lately, It seems escaping feels like a tall order
Then I realize that it's my calling by the fourth quarter
And as it rings, I wonder who's over yonder
Maybe it's something as pleasant as envisioning heaven
I am, the one cuz I said I am
And my drive's a force that'll make Jedi dance, moon walking
I'm that cool constant in an awkward setting
I'm Hugh Bossin' and I'm far from timid
Lord forgive him
Cuz I get enlightened by my vices
Shit I get high cuz I don't know, I like it
Shit I get high for all the lows in my life
When you're planning a getaway it's quicker to take a flight, right
I'm living my life
Bitch nigga get yours, step outta my light
You tryna throw shade on my bright
But this little light of mine, mama said let it shine
I'm strolling, third eye open
Oh my, I'll be a giant fore' I know it
I'm the Incredible Hulk mixed in with Hulk Hogan
Til they catch my wave, I'll be out show boatin
I'm just tryna be big enough to make the world listen up and get you in the mood to move mountains
I'm just tryna make history out of misery and show the lost ones that victory is for dudes like em
Huh, I'm just a product of the D Streets
Tryna define dope, til a nigga deceased
Stressin', Praying that my city keep peace
But all we know is bang bang, so everyday I chief keef
Yeah, I'm just a product of the D Streets
Tryna define dope, til a nigga deceased
Stressin', Praying that my city keep peace
But all we know is bang bang, so everyday I chief keef

Told yall I be rambling
Third eye shit
(The Realest) OG Cool
Yeah

Somebody told me it'd be days like this
Chose the bed, laid in it and I made my shit, ha

*Singing*
