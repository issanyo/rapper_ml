This is the voice of Zimbabwe

[Verse 2: Black Fin]

We encourage you to listen really close
As we let the story flourish and nourish your sensibilities
I used to be afraid of all the black
The black that surrounds and approaches you without a sound
The kind of black that you will never wrap your head
The kind of black I’m thinking waits ahead when you're finally dead
And when it made me pee the bed
My brother used to chuckle while it suckled on my street cred, damn
The sweaty palm to my sweaty hand
Tried to find the cheapest ticket leaving for the promised land
My homies always had the little debbies locked
Sundays by the west mall doing what little kids do
Drug abuse with a whisky fetish
Kind of bummy that the homies never missed me
Dreaming of a time that any Debbie would have kissed me
I fantasized it while I rode the brothers Arthur’s bike
Carry on the back so I could tug along the heavy load
These are roads less travelled by the many
Deep until the gravel till the sun goes down and the nutsack tighten
I should have worn my other pants
And then I heard him for the first time
I heard as I wrote my very first rhyme
Damn this feels amazing let me write another
He told me “Go on brother…”
Damn dude who is you?
“I, Djugudju...
Sent by all the spirits who'd love you to make jams
Here I am.”
And I’m glad that he never left
Only had to make the next exit to reach the avenue
And now we cooking
Mama told me go outside
But nah I’m cooking
Power cutting nationwide
Cook it with a candle
Hours after bedtime, tinker while I’m tired
The rapping just got me fired up
Then made a record in a week
Photocopy sleeves on a fax machine
Shibha in the backyard barking
Birds singing...
Next thing phone ringing off the hook
Cause the hooks had the Debbies shook
They like “Homie what you sippin’ on?”
I’m still the same lad
Drama club, choir boy attire clad
Sitting in the front of Ilieva class
Only wine I’m sipping is at the table of your Sunday mass
Damn!
But attention is like a drug
Intravenous, feeding the ego that comes between us
Losing control of my brain stem
Losing my religion, losing rem sleep
Pullin on the hem until it all unravel
Bring you back to where it all began
Nobody with you... everybody moving on
Nobody miss you
Ain't nobody care about them tired ass songs
And pushing your mom and daddy whip
(Chea)
But you stuck it through
Through thick and thin
Way back when, way before the Fin
I was looking for that deus ex machina
Nobody dropping a line except the beats
And then I took the cord
With some duct tape put it together then i hit record
No more fear for the the black
The kind of Black that gives a weak brother his power back
The kind of Black that make you see the light
The kind of Black that's way too bright, yeah its one and the same
We playing the game, moving along the little Fin that could
The kind of Black that make you make it your name yeah
