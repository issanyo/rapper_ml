Uh
Ay, yo shoutout to the Treble fans
And DOOM too, bruh, that nigga's raw
What up
(SUPA)

[Hook:]
Hot ass beat, and it's not Lex Luger or Lex Luthor
And it's hella (SUPA)
Teached the teacher how to teach
And fuck being cougar, don't give a fuck about the age it's still (SUPA)
Keep 'em on they toes like they shoveling out poop
Or meet 'em at the door and let 'em know the dro (SUPA)
Showed me a new way like she was my tutor
Kick it so much it's like I knew Kung-Fu stuff

[Verse 1: Chester Watson]
Heard so many moans Its like my mind is a ghost town
Hit them with the okey dokey cause my flow wild
Get zooted the hokey pokey with the fro down
Fucked a couple girls told 'em keep it on the low-down
Put the blunt to my nose like Nyjah
Call me Human Torch cause I stay with the fire
Homie what it be, put it on, we can cypher
With raw high bros if everything (SUPA)
And plus, I met a chick named Pookie
Said I didn't have to pay and she still do me
I'm guessing its the smoke making her a little loopy
And I never was the nigga afraid of getting some cooties
Team Diverse, we resembling to Goonies
Told me she'd fuck so I didn't need the roofies
Dressed in lace, lips red like boobies
She's a slut muffin couldn't label her a groupie
Because she didn't even know that I was into making music
In the middle of nowhere something like the boonies
I can't even lie, she was looking kinda juicy
Any nigga trynna cock-block getting two-piece
Or a Churches deluxe with a fruit smoothe-knee to the fucking gut
Cause that's just how I do things
Girls getting tummy tucks thinking that it's beauty
But it's all great, yeah, to me, the shit (SUPA)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Skating up town with a brand new deck
Hole in my show, but I still look fresh
A little Shoe Goo and the shoe's in check
But I don't skate switch, so it's not on the left
That means that I'm goofy and I flick with the right
A new 6 set, kickflip it first try
Skate a couple hours, get buck, get high
Kick it with the homies, freestyle, cause life (SUPA)

Yeah yeah, I keep life simple
Best advice that I ever got was to sip slow
Never fall in love and keep your temp low
Smoke a lot, so running from cops got my wind low
Don't fuck with you unless you my kinfolk
Like leftovers, wrap her in tinfoil
And people don't complain if you been spoiled
Others keep ya head up cause life (SUPA)

[Hook]
