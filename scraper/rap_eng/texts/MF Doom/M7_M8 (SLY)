[Verse 1: Ness Wicked]
I mean yes ma'am
I didn't mean to be mean to rude it's the way you comin off kinda make my heart soft and I can't seem to help it's the way you make me feel and it seems so fake but I know the love real
Keep rhyming like this it's my mission life a game I keep playin, I wanna rewind but it's not yet time
I see you on the map but I just can't find
What really keep us close it might be the lust, or the list that I made cause I'm lost on track but your eyes pull me off course I wanna wear shoes in the studio, but I'm bumpin to the blues so jazz got me footloose, or it could be the herb that's running thru my veins, call me what you will but I'll never be same knowin that you didn't change, it's the memory's I want to fade
But they stay, that's okay as long you as you stay
In my heart don't want this man to keep pullin us apart and it feel so wrong, but what we got is true...girrrlll

(X4)
I ain't gon stop lovin you, you

[Verse 1: Ness Wicked]
And I'm back it feeling fanta-stick, I'm so sick of what's happen and the situation that we in I ain't trippin, but  time keep ticking
The mouse ran but the pendulum put to em to hault, WE GON GO FROM TALKIN EVERY DAY TO NOT TALKIN AT ALL ITS MY FAULT IM SHADE YOU ALL SALT, it's fine tho be mine my favorite rifle that I bought, bought...you ain't a got a cost...holla..you ain't a got a cost...holla..

(X6)
I ain't gon stop lovin you, you
