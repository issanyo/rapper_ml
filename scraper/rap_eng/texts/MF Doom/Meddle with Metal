[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Ten-hut!
Officer on deck
Salute, salute, salute

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, bombageddon, hard head descendants
Jarhead in the trenches, Scarhead's relentless
You came, performers, locksmiths and fools
Czar, what's your occupation? (woof)
Anytime I'm spittin', the floor rock
The spell's so strong, I catch hate from wizards and warlocks
Boom-bap ambassador, track master hot as Africa sand
Movin' bodies like a human trafficker
What I'm stompin' to harder than an inmate on a conjugal
Launchin' you with rocket fuel, live at the barbecue
Rebel I-N-S provide a spark for you
And I ain't even dig into my arsenal
Don't take it personal, you know the biz and you know this is
Thoughts, so much force I'm like Yoda's twin
(Fire) I break a sweat in the coldest wind
I'm bad news, they gon' notify ya closest kin

[Chorus]
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
The Supervillain, a maniacal tyrant
Hear footsteps, adapt to your environment
Jungle, all you suckers with the rap jargon
The type of rap you find on a rack at a bargain
Type of crap probably get 'em smacked off the margin
Willis Reed, '72, Knicks at The Garden
New York, this ain't no new talk, true talk
TMZ and fake beef is the new pork
Filthy, regurgitate
Tape him up, lay him down, increase the murder rate
No no no, not that dude, I heard he straight
Wack rappers get spit on through the pearly gates
Final straw, ask 'em what they rhymin' for
Death waits right behind the door like a dinosaur
On a line of raw tryna find a cure
DOOM!

[Chorus]
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM
CZAR, DOOM

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
It was a shit show from the get-go
Every hero needs a villain, weave a web like Steve Ditko
To get dough, they thirsty, word to big Diplo, they tip-toe
Minions 'round the giant with the sick flow
No, no, I wouldn't provoke 'em
They call him Connor McGregor, the way he's fookin' outspoken
In a trial by combat, let's do ten paces
Cesspool erases, Deadpool their faces
Deck, DOOM and Seamus, rec rooms and stages
You gamble with your health, med schools and Vegas
I miss that old shit, rappers used to be stupid def
Now they just stupid and deaf
I stay around bread like twisty ties, look (up in the sky)
CZARFACE stick the superhero landing, extra fly
My mind's scattered but the bars rule
So many voices in my head that every ride's a carpool

[Outro]
Unbelievable!
