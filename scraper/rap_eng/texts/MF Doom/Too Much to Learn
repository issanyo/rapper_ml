[Verse: N0va]
I been Toss and Turning in my sleep
Weed burning on the cheap
Keep lurking on a beat
Funny how rappers now skipped learning how to speak
Just to sell they souls never earning on they keep
See, life and death the type of that I can think about
Never have to stress bout the money in my bank account
If I got issues with my girl we can bang it out
But they always boomeranging back when we hanging out
We problem solvin’
Climb the peaks to fall to bottom
Winter months yo the fall of autumn
We breaking bread at the olive garden
The truth it comin out
We always make peace on the fact we don’t fuck around
Im too Needy - Wish for help -  No genie
All my friends disappear like Houdini
I don’t really give a fuck but none of y’all can see me
It’s like they always blur my face out on the TV
Tryna leave my mark everywhere like Graffiti
But I can’t pick my battles cuz I’m always too greedy
I got lofty goals -  I want nothing too easy
Penthouse Suites, Marble Floors, a Couple Yeezy'
Im dat fly guy, smooth words, and a nice smile
I got drive that can rev up on the gas miles
Yelling fuck the world till my dreams comin tactile
Jumping up and down make it crack on a glass tile
Moonwalking never doubt my footing
I been fearless – New circles – new ponds to dip my foot in
Got a new whip ,  new rims - the dashboard wooden
Grind for the stacks and success and the proof is in the pudding

[Hook]
There’s always Too Much to Learn
The grass always greener there’s too much to burn
Give up everything lose too much in turn
The internal turmoil take too much concern
