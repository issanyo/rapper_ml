[Verse 1]
It's the Megalon don, monster mothafuckin' mobbin'
Curb stompin' the beats and eatin' lyric sheets until I'm nauseous
Take caution before I lock on, regurgitate and exterminatin' all the jokers fit the coffin
The streets littered with bodies, I'm prolly a sicker nigga than Stalley
That mean Maybach is finna sign me? I'm lively, the Def Ninja slick, grimy
Grabbin' on the foot of the game till you lame niggas rewind me
You other niggas sick to your stomach
I layaway and maintain I'm insane, that's cuz they lovin' it
Thuggin' and shovin' shit
3AM, Top of the mornin' to ya, with a bitch in her underwear havin' drunken fits
Yeah a nigga finna be under it, like a blunt this bitch get licked and kicked
A mothafuckin' mysticist, relatin' through this lyric spit
Yes indeed they shittin' bricks as I go in, smokin' on that potent
I leave the track dead with a smell that you notice
A nigga comin' with the pro shit, pen and paper for this prose spit
Pencil eraser as I poke in, nigga I'm Hulk Hogan
Chokin' you other niggas, I blow out like you roseless
Bullrush the stage and stab coke into they IV and then dash
Dead life and then the show ends
