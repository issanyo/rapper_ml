[Intro]
Uh, this YGBâ€”yeah

[Verse]
Snap back to reality
Posted at the cove with the cavalry
Most raps would blow past your dome
Don't battle me, dope savagery
Paint a picture like I'm Salvador
I'm out the door
Gas pedal floored
Glass meant for Coors
Smashed to the core
Stole a flask from the store
Shit's degenerate
Gave no fucks like I'm celibate
Ain't no better kid
Teachers reach the flow and stop bitchin' bout the penmanship
Poems I'm holdin' and storin' inside the touch screen are unseen
Each case hit replay to hear just what the son mean
I make every beat a martyr
Start a Coup
Hear the Carter 2 from car to roof
Straight bumpin', the bass thumpin'
I stay stuntin' at RJ's beat huntin'
I see cousins at barbecues buzzin like:
"Uh, ain't nobody hard as you, you a charmin' dude"
Watching more jaws drop than apartment doors
I target more achievements to see next
The frees hard as cement
I raise ceilings at every event
On YGB the team depends
One more tab and that's the deep end
I'm off it, Tabasco, I'm saucin
I stay hot often, opposite to Boston
See what transportations costin' when I'm exhaustin'
Hoodie off, cops make a nigga stay cautious
Cops make a nigga stay cautious
See what transportations costin' when I'm exhausted
