[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, breaking fearless
Standing ovations got me asking where the tears fit
Careless: Super, Caesar, YGB the fiercest
Got the team behind my back
Niggas I'm tryna climb the stairs with
Young So4p even made the tears sip
Brothers to list in rap, he's growing up
My nigga's bearded
Follow the rise or lie delirious
We got the crowd jumping
Going crazy—Jim Carrey shit
There's no stepping to a nigga—period
Blind spirited, killa got the experience
Eating niggas like we in the cafeteria
If your flows stupid, mine's a mothafuckin' idiot
Drinking pretty shit, gone like arigato
Young Greg Bayne's always a hard act to follow
"Fuck mediocrity" forever stay the motto
These shit's already faded
Why the fuck you wanna cop for?

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture with this shit while reminiscing to Basquiat
Never missed a beat
Reminder, I cannot be stopped
Nigga, fuck a drop top
I'm tryna focus on getting this shit to pop
Before I think about the top
Wait—yo—don't get it twisted
I'mma make it soon
I'mma make it boom
Fuck the sky, I want the moon
To all the rappers talking shit
Man ya'll can pick a tune
The flows lethal man
It's murder when I fuck with DOOM
Tape dropping soon, get ready for the funerals
Niggas listen to my shit and really need a uniblow
Lyrically too cold
And you should know that Supermån is dope
But ain't the only one that breath froze
So keep dreaming while I keep working
Mercin' beats, niggas hurtin' while my shit perfect
Releasing fire, I'll die before it stops burning
So start learning nigga
Realest and I'm just rehearsing

[Outro]
It's YGB yo
That's the end
