He came with a real mental sickness
Lifted his sword and began swinging it with swiftness

He whisered dont be fool cause with next jutsu ima go right through you
Who,Who coulden't been talken about me ima chakra monster about to go and bring the heat
Like an awkward concert were the only smell is damn feet, beat boxers were breifs tightness meet around the feet
Such a neat dork I need some miso Pork, me so horny hit the source with more force then an iron horse
But back to the battle, he destroyed all my Personal chattel, ima go tattle on his ass then gather the cash

Chakra flow that is hit him with the gentle fist Paralysed byaku eyes saw him from the distance

Verse 2
Another chillen night I was at my Post when i heard a bang boom and before i knowed i was in the midst of a knife fight with a foreign ho
Damn she had a body but better yet an intellect, stoP she said like the ho was Possessed there's a guest in here chest mind transfer i guess
I released the bitch now there's a guest,I infested her nest then jet to the west
No worries it simba summon,rouge ninja done with swift kick hits lick another one coming

Bounce out for he nows my wallets all gone
