[Intro]
Hey! Yeah, oh, yeah, baby...

[Bridge]
I really need to grow up
Maybe I should get older, wiser
Hey, sir, can you help me out?
Yo, could you help me out?
Yo, mister, could you help me out?
Just help me out
I really need to get wiser, older
Maybe you can help me out

[Verse 1]
Never was really too good at sports
Never really knew how to play the shit
Everyone always used to crowd around
Everyone always used to get down
With the funky sound of the funky drummer
Number one style for the number one summer
Here he goes again and everyone going to say
"Why it never go my way?
Why it never go my way?
My way, my way"
Every morning, wake up to a bad day
Thinking about you
And tattoos and clown shoes
And good thing I got up's and downs
Got help some time
Drink some liquor ought to help sometime
Maybe I don't need to feel alright
Once in a minute going once in a while
Mama ain't seen my face in a while
Everything going my way
Why isn't anything going my way?
Why is everybody standing in my way?

[Hook]
Somebody help me out
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?

[Verse 2]
Never was too good at sports
Never really ate the fork of the fork
Never really gave a fuck, ya see
Everyone think I got leprosy
Never is really that bad
Nothing really ever really mattered to me
Why the fuck won't she look my way
I can't stand it
Call these women Jay Hawkins of the 21st centuary
The name's DeM atlaS
I'm rocking with MF DOOM on this shit
This is called Garbage Day #3
Maybe you need to pay attention or read
TV or television, get a itty bit of superstition
Or whatever you need

[Bridge]
Whoa, hey!
Whoa, hey!

[Hook]
Somebody help me out
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Won't somebody help me out?
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody

[Outro]
This is dedicated to you
You and you and you and you
This is dedicated to you
You and you and you and you
This is dedicated to you
You and you and you and you and you
Alright
(Help me out
Help me out
Help me out)
