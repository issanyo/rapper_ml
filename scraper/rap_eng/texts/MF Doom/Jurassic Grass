Verse 1 [Max Tringham]:

Astronomical topical problems I keep them bottled in
Swaddle nauseous pockets with either dollars or pocket lints
Every college student think they're buddhist and that's an awful trend
I wish we'd all just act more prudently and bear our thoughts to friends
Forlorn Homosapien orator vaping a fourth or more get
Wasted flow so angry and sort of a hazy brazen bore
More vacant, aching floor, shaking pace, and I'm baking more
Raking your faces, aces placed, and I'm only making sure
Ask me, one more question, and get your ass beat
Attack beats, invest time, but time it doesn't last see
Last week, I felt fine, but now my mind harasses me
Acid seeping, pappy see me, bleeding half my massive heathen
Rap depleting, past deleting, factory of drastic reasons
I can't even actualize my fucking needs, I have no freedoms
Shit hurts- you got the last, they got the first
Bad bitches see I rap different, and all they've gots a thirst
Back in grade 10, packing tobacco inside my habitat
This habit is the battle since, sadly I can never win
Cause I been feeling worthless since Earth turned when I was nine
But now I'm sure its worth the work or even paying fines cause this
Purple leave me perfect before I'm immersed in lady's thighs

Hook [Max Tringham]:

What you thinking bout? Better not be doubting
Me or my sounds, sicker than Heather or Beverly now
Vested in grout, mouth touted like a tether be
How could he drown us quicker than reverie his sound trounces me

Verse 2 [Monk]:

Looks like its time to take my glasses off
Flipping through pages of what my old bad habits are
If you know me, you know I don't pass basketballs
If its in my court, I pick it up, then I laugh it off
Had to call, 1-800
Second I turn around bet you won't say nothing
If I turn around again, I bet you will say something
That's the best case, and you don't want the worst case cousin
Birthday fucking until you busting now its case closed
Lucky, better hope you don't have to replace clothes
Buddy, bet you'll never say that to my face ho
My mask on, pass time, you know how the days go
Took the ring off your finger, and made it to a halo
Possible demon, come mingling with some angels
Walking on the border turning dollars into pesos
If you're still on your knees, polish up and lace those
Look, Nine fingers, all I need is eight though
Hook, line, sinker, gotcha falling for my bait-
Woah

Verse 3 [Max Tringham]:

This Conversation is cosmic, osmosisly odd flowing
An eye for a homonym, so cocky, he's tomohawking
Hot frozen, pot smoking, disguised so I'm not noticed
Locked, key dropped inside a volcano, its hot molten
Rock throwing- I'll put a crack upside your glass house
Clack clack, spitting raps, littering cynical gat mouth
Clocks broken, time don't exist inside my rap house
Sick like I pass out, zoned blunted and trapped cause
The world ain't always merciful, and I might be the first to fall
Rehearsing verses with nervousness until I can hurtle God
Hurl the cross at the moon, furious ready to curdle y'all
Curb stomping in cursive romping, find me high, submerged in thought
Riddled with doubt, but doubt me kid you'll get a kick in the mouth
Pick at a pound, rolling amounts of ounces, lick 'em and give 'em to frowns
I don't, exist, I write my own glyphics
I fight to choke geyser smoke and dive in most bitches
