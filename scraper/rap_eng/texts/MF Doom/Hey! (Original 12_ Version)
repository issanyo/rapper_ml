[Intro]
Hey there boys and girls!
Let me know if y'all with me y'all

[Verse]
I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase
With more rhymes than ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one, Super-villain
Who wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor
Chillin, ready and willin' to inadvertantly foil that plan of the rhymers they be whiners like spoiled brats
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows
Nobody knows the trouble I see from the MPV
Fly dirty tailin' the bubble eye thirty
For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all
It's science fiction that's not permissible in no court of law
I live to rock mics in 3-D
The only reason i seek to stop, to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke with monkey rhymers on a leash like "don't let this nigga choke me"
Hit 'em with a penny so we could get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts
I used to get free cuts
They lock Lex Luthor up in Green Haven
Since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven
Misbehavin' rap stars need Listament
Call me Mr. Bent, I'm at where your sister went, intelligent
Used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell-
Tell joke
This could lead to catastrophe
'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three shots from the black bat that got me at headlock
Holdin' on to sanity by strands of that dreadlock
She told me get off, I said "Bitch, let me set this shit off so I could get rich"
Then this shit hit me like the point of intoxication
Imma come out and rock this nation
Like ox defacing
A lot niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation
I could do it
I'm the super like in your building
Villain like trife Kinder is in All My Children
Plottin', and it's sure to pay ends
With some real mature womens and some more of they friends
And when bad men roll tight
It's actual true, like a pack of big Bambu with natural glue
Who grip necks of deuce to dukes to triple X
He just came in 4-D, follow the ripple effects
And it'll lead ya right to him
Oh snap!
Seems we've walked into a trap through rap
Zoinks! This place is filled with pretender willies
One false move and get broke off like end of Phillies
Yes true believers
Ain't nothing new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uhhhhh...
I picture rhyme of the month, two page long
I'm in it with two gauges and my cape on wrong
Son it's on, it's like a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of superbad bitches, status: Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'all with me y'all (HEY!!!)
It's national and geographic, down to the titty ball
I represents MI City y'all
To my man Wiz doing his unsettling bids
You woulda got away if it was not for them meddling kids

M'er F'ers
