The worst of the worst, very blessed to be honest
See words as my worth, keep em dressed up n polished
Like pleats in my shirt, cologne and corsages
Sins in the dirt, a corpse in the coffin
Often, reclusin' in the studio, wonder if its haunted
Eyes skewed to the door, heard knuckles knockin
But it was just a kickdrum, I'm buggin off coffee
Had to pause the track, take a breathe and get off it
Eyes all glossy, 5 hours passed me
Feelin wired up like FBI tryina tap me
Antsy, figured I'ma call it a night
Look in the mirror swore I saw the ghost of gatsby alive
