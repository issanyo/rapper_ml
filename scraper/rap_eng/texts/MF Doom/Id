[Verse 1: Potus]
Midnight capers
Like a tootsie pop
How many licks to the center
More than she could cop
Props, with the whiskey
Twist shit, spits is thick
Extra nips n bit a bit
Don't cut it like clicky click
Quick, close the tabs
Shit, sixty-nine open
Cut it off like slabs
Grab it daily like itchin' crabs
Snitchin' stabs
Tell it up, a circlejerk
Hurlin' whackin' turks
Smirkin' over a clerks work
Smilin' in your face
Rilin' memories of a place
Where she jerked Id off
Call it inception at the bates
Or the gates of hell
Standin mates is broke as well
Chokin' on rumors, you set sail
For gettin tail
Or some fire sale
Hang me up with a tie
Break it off like you
Ruin lifes, I grew too nice
Try to keep a floatin' ship
Leakin hull, sunken shit
Ends meet like tongue to blood filled
Wounds
Tell the crew it's been brewed
Ruin relationships
Like Id's all you wanna do
I thought there was a friendship
Lend shit with no fits
Met a not friend chick
And you signed off on the check
I'll call it bullshit
Cause you head over heels
For a dude that truth spit
That's nasty as ugly sweater knit
Or better yet
I could give you proof
You talked me through the roof
And then yanked me like a tooth
Go ahead, tell the town
Wear the crown, a dancin' clown
With more lies than politicans
This the last round
