(Need help completing lyrics, done by ear)

See i've been waiting for the right time please show me a sign/
I checked your horoscope and it said you should be mine/
I'm saying that you're fine, and all the other terms/
I'm tryna get to know you so we have a lot to learn/
I'm knowing that you're special and you probably feel the same/
You're blushing hiding feelings but i ain't tryna play no games/
These other dudes are trouble, they're lacking better humour/
Forget your past problems I can be your better future/
I've had my eye on you but i'm not the stalking type/
I try to show you signs between the lines that i write/
I've set the record straight, how much longer do i wait/
I'm diggin' you more than heads be diggin' through the crates/
Let's get to know eachother girl there really ain't no rush/
So we can take our time cause i'm tryna earn your trust/
No matter what you are, scorpio or gemini/
We can be a match together girl just show me a sign/

[Chorus]
Virgo scorpio what do you know
__________________________
Taurus in the house with my aries and geminis
Light it up blow it to the sky
One love my aquarius and pisces
_______________________________
I pay attention to the signs around me... from the sky x4

Approaching different known to keep it kinda distant/
I really dig your vibes never knew that you existed/
I'm showing interest, tryna give you what you're missing/
Comfortable and chillin' with a man that's on a mission/
I know you get approached hearing all type of game/
Every dudes the same, talk simple and plain/
Got that same routine playing like a movie scene/
I'm tryna flip the script, play the king and you'll be queen/
Dreams of being by your side truly caught my eye/
I'm hoping you reply to the words in the rhyme, cause I/
Know we make a match, simple as that/
I know they're saying things about me but lets stick to the facts/
It's more than rap, it's passionate lyrics over the breaks/
I'm hoping you'll relate, do whatever it takes/
See i can hit you with a line time _____ defined/
But i'd rather take action girl just show me a sign/

[Chorus]
