Yaoooo

[Hook: skank]
Somtimes you need to let go
And let somebody else through the threshold
I'm saying i ain't tryna make ya jealous
But when i'm on the the scene
Elvis

Why ya tryna throw sharks through my window
Feds
You tryna throw sharks through my window
Ahhhhh
Why you try to throw sharks through my window
Why
Tryna throw sharks through

[Verse 1: Skank]
Nah baby! Whats on ya mind
Damn you smart, but you ain't fine
Dressing like a stripper every  fucking time
Like you wanna do this job all ya fucking life
Yea you ugly
I said it yo
You wrong as fuck
Making me look like the hoe
Attitude is nasty
Irresponsible
Look at the company you keep.in ua circle
I ain't perfect
I made mistakes
You if you was round more
Same case
I don't know but im sure we could use the space
Looking at the main door
Main source page
You flipped ya magazines
Peggy Bundy face
Mad cause a nigga dreams make you suffocate
Never believed
Must've thought a nigga fake
You should've believed
Cause now we at the pearly gate's!

[Hook: skank]
Somtimes you need to let go

[Verse 2: Skank]
Go ahead, Call ya man
Knowing that he couldn't do it like i can
Being troublesome
Get cha shit chewed up
Like bubble gum
Pop em if you really want
Bringing a stranger in our business
Ya girl's bad enough so bare witness
You got nigga at a scrimmage
Line in ya mind cause a fine but we finished
The hand that rocks a cradle never lie
My super ex girlfriend got me like vanilla sky
The thriller in manila
Made the bitch loose her mind
Got me running to the next
Fresh check sign
Man yo, i wish i seen the signs
Facebook, MySpace, black planet grinds
If time was an issue why you working overtime
If money was the problem
Why the fuck you stopping mine see!?!

[Hook:skank]
Somtimes you need to let go

[Verse 3: Skank]
The word Ex be short for excuses
Bad sex for some could be useless
Relation-ship's
Could sink in confusion
The love boat don't move unless you in
It's proven
One night stands from bar stands
In the back of her mind for mine
How would i know?
How she act sometimes
Always something to hide
Still a rare find
How did i get here
I fly stare through expensive eye wear
Cheers

This the glare from a care bear
Her man thought he was a pimp but he as snitch
Huggy bear
Kids all over the house
Daddy day care
When your done
Slide him a questionnaire
Mean and his girl
Leaning like a rocking chair
Then.she show up
Cape in the fucking air
An yeah
