[Verse]

Life be like I just woke up, don't wanna go to work
But I'm not tryna go broke by the first
My throat hurts like Vader caught me in a force grip
If I wasn't this stubborn I would probly force quit
The short stick ain't that bad it's all I need
Cause even it's not the long one ima succeed
I'm introduced as the modern day Confucius
If you want the belt then you gotta take the bruises
I'm as ruthless as my uncle Bruce is
Be like water, the world is parched
Please try harder and work smart, I do it for the art
This shit is so essential so I do it for my heart don't start
Cause you'll get stopped quicker than blinks
When i flow ima watch while you sink in your thoughts
And you think that you're raw but you're thinking is wrong
You rap like you don't believe in your songs
I rap like its in my genes and i'm gone
Need to get gene fisher on a beat make a song
Cole, fly anakin, caprii make a song
Crosby, atlas, yeen neen make a song
So much talent, so unbalanced
All I say is facts and i'm so unchallenged
I understand that you been waiting on truth
I'm sorry that I'm late i'm in the booth, proof
No excuses, those are useless
Those are why I'm courage and you're Eustice
Gettin' screwed by the things I do for love
But I'll probly blow a fuse I can never do enough
Never do I bluff what if you were tough as me
What a stupid question there won't ever be another me
But do you as best as you can
Cause nobody alive can be a better you damn
No L's just better new plans
Won't quit till I've met all my new fans
I make the shit that you just can't copy
Im always proper never sloppy, Gawdlee
