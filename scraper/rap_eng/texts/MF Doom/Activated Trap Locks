[Intro]
One-two- mic check in my left and right
On your go

[Verse]
Song battle, calm shadows
Walk narrow, trapped in the small babble raps
And the longer [peril ?], wrong channel
Seed water, piece upon your dream
What you see is stars, tree bark
Mark, it's from the green-eyed starship
The lone man on the planet has [?]
Walking on the land of the suffocated astronauts
The gladiator and the Lancelot
Dancing in the parking lot
Prancin' and romancin' in the camera shot
Big, dark sandal [blot ?]
Trip [bombs ?], half the plot
Jigsaw, the fist caught and activated trap locks
You can not stab the mascot
The man laughed off, stabbed the abdomen and yelled "Jackpot!"
Wore the tore colors of the ascot
Poor form to hacksaw, earthworm had to crawl
Warn poor brothers in the Cold War summer
Ukraine babes play wars in Russia
Example of the wax told, actual around post
Mantle hassle factual lack of votes, backstroke
Artificial, not natural
Coffin ritual in South Africa with poisonous tarantulas
Boisterous animals, larger life egos, not my amigos
I love humble people
