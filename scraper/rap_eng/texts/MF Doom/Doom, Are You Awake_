[Principal]
Doom, are you awake?

[Dr. Doom]
Yes, but what do you want?

[Principal]
You fool, it's a miracle that you didn't kill Costez as well as yourself. So, before you cause greater harm—

[Dr. Doom]
Get out of here! This is just a minor disappointment. I shall overcome it

[Reed]
The failure of DOOM's experiment did not end his tragedy
For a few days later, his bandages were removed

[Nurse]
There. Aah! How horrible, that face

[Dr. Doom]
What have I done to myself? My face is...hideous! He made me hurry my experiment! Now I must hide my face from all mankind. But he will pay. Oh, how he will pay!

[Reed]
So after his face was ruined, he just seemed to disappear

[Commissioner Robbins]
Why did DOOM threaten just to—

[Reed]
Well, like I said he just disappeared. I'll never forgot that day
