Verse 1:
First up at night
Smoking loud landmines
In your dreams midnight thief
Make a rack where sun don't shine
Every rapper want to be fathered
Staying close to my stack
Groupies switching up like a bunny
Killing brain cells looking for meaning of life
Dead in your eyes dead on sight
Get smacked
Pulling bunnies out hats magic wand
All white going blind
The fame getting close
Funny done in a honey
Lap dance lost my heart
Late night eyes are a lamp

Chorus x2:
Can't fold under pressure
Black out wake up a miracle
Fake is as fake does fake
And it's just my luck
Fold under pressure
Fold under pressure
Fold fold under pressure
I'm only getting rich

Bridge:
Greet your highness with a bow
Lost in a world of loss
Flying high with the crow
Still can't find my soul

Verse 2:
Misty outside
Don't naive
Cost less to keep your faith
The uncut saga
All we're after is bliss
Seeing who's nicer
Catch a grip
Ask if we care
Curfew still trying to cuff
Weed stash low passing out past
Start the bath to bathe
How we're living life
Dome in a foam pit must have
Hurt to see you go so quick
Stuck around get the pipe
Rip my heart apart your's the same shape
