[Pete Nice]
Ace is the place with the helpful hardware
Prime's got a spare, it's truth or dare

[MC Serch]
Stare into the face of a kid who is a hypocrite
Take all that hate -- why don't you try flippin it?

[Pete Nice]
I never went out out drinkin Pepsi sips
And never laced up my boots in fruity bits
I ain't British so my fetish ain't knighthood
Cause no one wears sequins in my neighborhood

[MC Serch]
Cause my feet are firmly planted on the concrete
High-top fade, with no need for a blonde streak
Now let me chill, it's a sign of maturity
And I would never steal a chant from a Black Greek fraternity

Elvis Elvis baby, too bold, too bold
Ice Ice baby, no soul, no soul

[Pete] Last year we +Gassed+ ya up
[Serch] Now herbals fill your pastures
[Pete] Masters of movement and mayhem
[Serch] while last year record shows stopped for a racist
[Pete] Countin cards and blackjacks, throwin aces
[Serch] Places I've seen and I've seen all types of grills
[Pete] It's the K.M.D. ?? G fills
[Serch] Which builds up the fence for the fibs you're sprayin
[Pete] My ace is in the hole
[Serch] So whatcha playin?

* Daddy Rich scratches Zev Love X saying
"K.M.D. and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole, I mean soul.." *

[Zev Love X]
That's it right? Check it
Humm goes the kick, check out how I flick it
As the thumb presses quick, Sub on the mix (yeah!)
And yeah the Birthstone Kid, Zev Love X
And Mr. X took a lickin, so Onyx what's the time it is?

[Onyx]
Time is to get my cocka-doodle rooster yappin
Wakin devil heads with my poor style rappin
Time is a quarter shorter that in order be sorta
Tap in my line and just Knowledge me

[Zev Love X]
Eats the baby food with no bib
And ad-lib from the Reverand Rib's crib
The lesson is.. YEAHHH, some ?? true and fix
Yeah all garbage no fib
I'm talkin bout the Nubians (wake us up) the black man
No sugar sweet snacks for the sour sap
To see home, why should I have to check the maps?
The haps, is negative I give many many caps
For a heavy heavy gun, about a, ton it weighs
That keep you, bustin off for days as sure as every sucker pays
In time, tis mine
The cause is a hole where the bass is ace for rhymes

[Onyx]
Evils in my midst bound to get crushed, rushed
Helps to manage, we're Kausin Much Damage
So we go on and on, word bond
Mics they got torn by the Kause long as Jimmy Cracks Corn bores
Hamhand gets no support
By the God Squad, God Body, for short call me God Born
Headnod to this like a King of Swing, thing and
Check the verse I disperse, see what I'm bringin
Is an ace in the hole
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh a ace in the hole!
Yeahh.. ace in the hole?
Uh-huh, uh-huh, a ace in the hole!
