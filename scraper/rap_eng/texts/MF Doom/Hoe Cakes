I'm back again with the last class specimen
He started getting bad when momma stopped dressing him
He started acting rad the girls were undressing his
Levi's Kevin cleins and tongue began to interrupt a kiss
Not a banger so the girls won't be humming this
My music don't get love so I'm loving the loving less
No good morning text, I'm without a night kiss
The girl I loves lips must meet my fist
Nigga can you really hate me
Even the girl you dating really, really, really want to date me
You mad, know your heart is racing
Don't let it crash cause jail is what you'll be facing
Together forever I know cause I'm a lupa
Told her that and she said that it was just (Super)
Do you love me?  Do you really really do
If you say no then your parents go have some bad news
