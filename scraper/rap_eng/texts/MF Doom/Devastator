[Verse 1: Trunks]

Last Will and Testament, first Fallen Angel
Kicked out of Heaven, fell at a weird angle
Hit the ground running; scarred, tail tangled
Now he just raises the bar and leaves 'em mangled

So yeah motherfucker
I got the drive of a redneck trucker
Tractor pull, act a fool
We'll see who's backing you
Once we see what these cats'll do

It's like panthro, liono, and tiger in a thunder tank
Fuck where you from, I'm claiming anywhere you ain't
Take anything you can't, now ain't that something?
Tie a rope around the neck of the beat, and get it jumping
