To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosevic
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speakeasy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumpin Jehoshaphat, who's that?
Who cats who do magic like "Tell me how you do's that"
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko
Thought I might do techno
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the vet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette's
Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
But uh... word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage"
Hip hop Benny Hill, Sip Henny straight
Get every penny, wait, then he chill, at any rate
My metal face hoes with tongue or 'least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
Then the super-villain struck again like lightning
In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?
And a name drop like pick the name out the hat
That's a known drop from the, liver conniver
Who vote player out the rap game like Survive while I
Drop degrees like a nerd cat wheeling ten speed
So way back spin your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo
While I, steal the show like "thought so, try hikin"
Super-duper stars need Ortho Tri-Cyclen
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
(Uhh, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain
