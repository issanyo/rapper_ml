[Clive Burrows]
Clive Burrows say your last words
"if theres a god then i'll tell him let my ass burn"
On the 21st for last verse words turned verbs worse, explicit
Refer to previous, just in case you missed it
So try'in listen
Look ive always been I misfit, with a sick fit
Big lipped, triple six, spitting from the motherfucking crypt
Im a dick, slick, with the diss in the writ
Im a trip, think its funny isnt it?
Just watch, fore your snowbunny trip and hop
On a nigga cb's carrot, for some lunch money
Sick as fuck, yeah thats why the nose runnied up, flu
Blue jewels, neck frooze
Rude dude, get a clue
Heres some food for thought for all of you
In the end when its through, who the fuck are you?

2010 was the year that I started rapping dope
Now you better carry a .9, because I'm snapping hope
I ate the track, before I came back for a second helping
Seven days in a week, I murder beats, so heaven help him
When I was six I would've never dreamed of this flow
Maybe five minutes of fame would've been my wish yo
But then I wrote bars like you've never before witnessed
The rap equivalent of shooting threes, and you sure missed it
In order to score maybe you have to drive it in
But I'll always be the one, that nobody was brighter than
