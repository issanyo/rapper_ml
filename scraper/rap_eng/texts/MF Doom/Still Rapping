[Intro]
Ayo, bro
Fatality, I got this
Everything will be on me: the mixing, all that
Alright

[Verse 1]
You mean to say you really thought that I lost it
I was in my shell working 'til I got exhausted
People say it's hot but it was just one song when
I got more in store, but see the way it is I was following my own plan to kick in the door
And hit the industry where I know it'll be sore
Taking this little music, elevate it from the floor
'til I'm hitting world tours and I got my own core
Until then, everyday I'll be working
Only when I'm done will I let you observe it
Once I let it go no doubt it'll be perfect
So Imma do my best to make sure that it's worth it
Cuz truth is, I wouldn't try to fit in off appeal or a gimmick
Only really matters if I did or I didn't
Leave a gem or two just so you can get with it
Cuz riches in the mind tend to leave you with infinite
Riches so you can even smile with your dentures
Be fresh as a dentist, but smile more than artists
Cuz money makes temporary light for the darkness

[Interlude]
Honestly I thought that was perfect

[Verse 2]
I see it as the key to free what's inside
To always bring the heat and murder with every line
Word is bond, and that's aim for every time
So as long as this pencil's on point, I'm cutting deep
Leaving my mark with every word I speak
If you looking for excellence I got what you need
A little preparation and some soul to feed
Help me, Imma help you too
A living paradox for a sick, healthy dude
Blessing the track like I sneezed and got the flu
Giving them verses like the bible would do
It's in my nature, the trees inspired
To give you a dose that'll lift you higher
That's fire

[Outro]
I, honestly, had a hook for this
But I'm not really feeling it
