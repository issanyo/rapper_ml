Its Boom Bap That's Encrypted In My Raps, From Snapbacks And Phat Raps I'm Bringing Juice Back, A New Cat, That's On The Scene, And Down To Get Mean, Obliterate A Nigga Just For Messing With The Team

The Team Is Pristine, In Contrast With The Flows, The Ghangis Khan Of Rap But Please Just Keep Dat On The Low, Been Rapping Like 5 Months I Know The Work Is Moving Slow, But My 3rd Eyes Open To Avoid Contact With Foes, Yano

Cuz There's Rumors That The Devil Wants My Soul, But Jah Rastafari Shun Him When He's Getting Close, He Noes That Young Tino Gonna Start Bodying Flows, The Innocence Within This Kid of which nobody knows

I heard it through the great vine, that niggas tryna take mine, its fine I'm just ducking these guy, coverd in lies, They try to mess with mine so I stay in disguise, I'm up in cloud 9 so I stay in the skys

My lifes on messed up saga, saga to sega genisis, rap patterns I'm diminishing, akura aura finisng, hadookin in the tomb tryna take rap out tootin camoon

Said uuuh I attack with the force a byson, mike tyson get struck by lightning , I'm redefining ,I'm frightening, Like Kruger, Straight Up Lex Luther, lyrical missile into your tutor

Finesse Coast forever making progress disintergrate a nigga just before I start to digest, I could be the best labels just might invest but fuck a v neck cuz I want these six figure checks but check it

Girls be on my set list that's word to bishop on 16 but I know how to get reckless like ice t spike lee couldn't picture jesus blood is our life it was said in scriptures

Metaphors metamorph into a subject of greatness, tino the titans, my whole team got spears like galations, simply amazing so bess protect your neck from these statements, Real Poet, I Tend To Write This Stuff On Occasion

Graveshift bitches weary wid obituarys, Tino V on the come up hope you niggas ready
