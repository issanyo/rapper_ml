[ Verse 1 : Dusen ]

Im'a great speaker staying deeper than coral is
Untamed reaper ain't an mc yah wanna quarrel with
Y'all upon the shores of wit i'm on course to hit
The floor with such force I may boar to the core of it
Warn you're clique as Dusen loosens
Storms of scripts this dudes inhuman
Mucus spewed issues the true solution
To remove profusion of dudes polluting
Music shooting across the web
You get noosed if your off the ebb
And flow then go and pose for cred'
See I loathe those cloaked toe to nose in threads
Show some sense slow down the act man
Don't you're heads hold and ounce of passion
Yah 'More for trends not bout the rapping?
Hand forth yah' pen and leave out the back then
As This rogue aims to dismiss those lames
Y'all ain't learning the first thing bout scripting dope game
I dip with yo chain this mis fit throws flames
Chakras burning in flurries I spit lit propane
Infringe yo' fame crippling image portrayed
Stencils gone break ending sickening charade
From the hip hit as aim never sways
Heading straight to the top head a blaze
Like the ghost rider dope rhymer never getting paid
Even though range is wider than tibetan plains
Craftily surpassing haphazards weak
Mc I chance upon In fact are fast to peace
As my raps elite like acid burn through tracks and beats
Practically the worst dude to pass in streets
Ill melt you're virtues like plasticine
Cause when Its comes to rap its sure Duse is packing heat
Earth soon will crack as he drops his shit
No applause yah sit slack jawed in shock from scripts
But maybe I'm an optimist and not so sick
Maybe I lost my wits and been all talk no spit
But fuck that I'm not gone quit
Till I'm dropping in a coffin i won't stop thats it
