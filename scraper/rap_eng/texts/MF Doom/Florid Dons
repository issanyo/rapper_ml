Get off my ball sack small rat, I’ll melt ya skin with a verse  ,paramedics leave you in gauze wrap
You caused that flappin' ya lips like u Don Juan, next time  close ya mouth  when my songs on


Semi’s the same don that spat lines n stayed calm when i rage on  lay siege missiles n napalm
Drop flows like A bombs// shawties hear the eloquence n face palm its opposite of Drake songs
You might spot me in a new tux I like women with fine shape n huge butts fine taste n youth 'cuz
I’m feelin' like a rich a don women approach  i get kissed on for makin' sick songs
Fist drawn// I’m  Rocky in the meat locker// its weed n wheat lager when the streets prosper
Make the front of the newspaper my crews favored ///My true nature is too major dude later
You’ll get slapped quick for spittin’ that wack shit, you’re challenged mentally so we can’t even match wit
I’ll leave ya brain floatin, I’m like sniffin glue after hazardous chain smokin  foreal you lames jokin'
You’re just a biter dawg everything i drop you copy, I’ll you hit with that shoryuken then a tatsumaki
I was diggin' crates you was diggin ya fat nose i rap flows n mack hoes after rap shows
Yo its the frag thrower marijuana bag blower I’m like Jin Kazama with hands just a tad slower
My pen flow like curves on a slim ho, the gems glow patterns like Big Pun in Twins bro

Get off my ball sack small rat, I’ll melt ya skin with a verse  ,paramedics leave you in gauze wrap
You caused that flappin' ya lips like u Don Juan, next time  close ya mouth  when my songs on


Yo its the rap Steve Austin a stone cold stunner/// spittin' fly sittin' high rose gold Hummer
I crossover  spin the basketball on my index for ten secs  been fresh smokin' while I chin press
Foreign ladies pourin' Bailey  near the poolside, Sasha Grey half naked down the pool slide
I hold the mic like a pimp holds a whores waist  give me more space its no room for poor taste
Damn, i suggest you  book a hotel,  Aventus Creed how my clothes smell hoes yell
The west side’s where I settle hun niggas carry metal guns rebels sons sippin on Ketel Ones
The flows nasty like bukkake ya crews sloppy, while dudes copy the style I’m sippin’ cool sake
Semi Six is more poised than you, you’ll need paramedics n the boys n blue when i poison u

Get off my ball sack small rat, I’ll melt ya skin with a verse  ,paramedics leave you in gauze wrap
You caused that flappin'  ya lips like u Don Juan, next time  close ya mouth  when my songs on
