[Verse 1: Doom]
Give 'em some skin, a real country bumpkin
Get up off his property, Villain, Fuzzy Lumpkin
Dumping enough raw lead to leave a forehead sunk in
When he's on tour, keep your paws off his pumpkin dumpling
Town village nympho, now it's all his though
The way she got down was far from privileged info
Break up to make up, wake up and smell the indo
Just from how she liked to show her belly button window
Couldn't tell him nothing, 5200, Atari, or Sega
Test tube L's with the lid, Garcia y Vega
His tongue is like a sword that's mighty like the pen
And you ain't seen nothing like The Mighty Quinn
Alrighty then!
Seal the deal with the shaking of a hand
Peoples catching feelings like it's Making of the Band
Villain have your fake man quaking in his Vans
When he do a jam, fans break-dancing in the stands
Chances are you'll lose the battle and the war
Trying to go to shore with just a paddle and an oar
Ooh shucks, you should have known them two schmucks
Would have came through the game with lame ducks
Off beaucoup bucks

[Hook: Vast Aire]
Yo, Metal Fingers, fix the beat with fire water
I advise all fathers to watch they daughters
It's going down tonight
We got monsters in the crowd, and they ready to fight
Metal Fingers, fix the beat with fire water
I advise all fathers to watch they daughters
You know we keep tricks up the sleeve
Coming through with the Justice League
(But you don't hear me though)

[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
I used to sew army patches on my favorite coat
BMX got your guns, old folks got soap
Homeless Sally from Cali cursed, cats in the alley
Sounds so foul, we washed our mouths with soap
I came up with cats that never be smiling
I called DOOM he said meet him on Monsta Island
Where the girls look good and the MCs be whyling
You can catch me in velour suits, styling
With Lady J holding hands with the Baroness
Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes don't got nothing on this
I got them Go Go Gadgets
So when the Cobra-la come through the floor
I'm putting snakes in baskets

[Doom]
We rob and do our thang, he's like Stimey from Our Gang
Guitar twang, try me, and wha da da dang!
I don't think you want to know, even if you still do
And want me to, I'll tell you, but then I'd have to kill you
Will you, please, it's like a grilled cheese sandwich
Gotta bring the butter else the bread'll get damaged
Flip it, slice it, and give half to Vast Aire
If you ask nice and bring a glass, we'll share the last beer

[Vast Aire]
After the Cold Vein and Doomsday, we don't need no pop
Revolution, we hit cops with Judo chops
And all you see is red, black, and green
Know I'm down for my team, they killed Radio Raheem!
Now I want to smoke a blunt, you know, blow off some steam?
Open my mouth like Godzilla, and all you see is light beams
This rap shit ain't all that it seems
You can leave it to the Super Friends to spill the beans
