[Verse 1: Kurs]
Medicated heavily, i treat it like a remedy
Cause when the crystal gets in me i'll spit like it was meant to be
Instantly i'll throw an after verse like a trillogy, i'm mentally
Unstable when the pencil and the pen agree
To write a couple bars cause in my head i'm always tryina see
The way that words crash when i'm writing but they tend to flee
But the key to bust a smooth flow like my yellow pee
Is tryina please yourself and talk aloud like a soliloquy
My pedigree, it comes around once in a century
But going instinct happens twice when people mention me
Jealousy is tryina take me out but i'm steadily
Dodging mad agression like if peace was essentially
Enough to piss the masses off and take it to the next degree
Hopefully they let the instrumental flow successfully

[Hook]
Skills to demonstrate is what them peope contemplate
Love or hate the flow that's late to pump up your heart rate
Cause skills to demonstrate is what them people contemplate
Love or hate the flow that's late to pump up your heart rate

[verse 2:]
Ain't tryina leave a legacy, i'm tryina take the vacancy
Spot of king of metaphors with 2Pac sitting next to me
Beats i always kick metaphorically and lyrically
The words get visual in my thoughts like HD TV
So Mtv can hit me up before i lose my memory
And hit the street to live for free and die with homeless misery
Yezzire, i took the time to count the paper, g
Cause only small amounts i got to realize i burn more weed
Than a pothead with a job or a nasty real emcee
"take a knee" that's what them people say when the quality
Of rhymin' words hit the curves, hit the street, people spit
Knowing that they'll probably get attention when the people see
Chemistry going back and forth with diversity
Best to see when the words hit the mics
Because cypher diversity will leave you saying "yikes"
It'll probably leave you saying "yikes"
(yikes!) just like that, uh just ilke that
(yikes! yikes! yikes!)
