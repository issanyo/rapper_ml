Johnny Tombs: Bringing it back like it was an old track in a black girl's head, ha I play too much. But nah, we bringing an old sound that was claimed to be dead found in the earlier days bringing the old ways. Remember them good old days less shootings and meaningful music, niggas abused music, so much ignorance, so many lies, doing your hardest in life, yeah we all tried, not hard enough times are rough, people die, people lie, people steal, people evil, ain't having it invading my farm like weevils. And in History it was "We The People" but now it's "We The Negroes" being peaceful. They say Hip-Hop is dead, but now it's being revived, it's coming alive, it's falling down this slide but lands on feet like a cat with 9 lives. Keep that flame burning it never dies. Gotta keep on trying

Delande: We live in a world, where those are  clueless, niggas be robbing niggas for cream, it's just a dollar & a dream. Monkey see, monkey do, but does the monkey see the true you. I'm in a good mood of disposition, I'm preaching with the microphone and hoping they would listen. Cause we on an expedition to change this world's condition

Johnny Tombs: Yeah, to change this world's condition

Delande: Your skin seems to determine how you act, whether your purple, yellow, or black. Hoping racism doesn't come back

Johnny Tombs: It's slowly rising back cause people don't how to act. That's about it mane, expect the rest later
