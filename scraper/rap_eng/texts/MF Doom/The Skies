Intro :
Burning from the sky burning from the sky
He's burning from the sky

Verse 1:
Jet, burning from the sky, Icarus
Legend, told by the blind it was Bush
Do you believe in myths and fantasies
Do the words you seek contain apathy?
Apparently, I was three
Flipping through the comics
Daddy breaking baby bottles
Sleeping with an empty stomach
Looking for a grail so holy
Solo Jones the game I studied
Money earned from family jewelry
Neji blocked chackras lowest points
Now you stuck in boxes, Tamagotchi toys
Thou wondering where I got this power
God-parents I'm Peter Parker
Fairy flows you Denzel Crocker
You're below I spaz out harder
Pardon me

Chorus :
Got me preaching got me preaching Lord!
Show me pavement to damnation for!
The death of competition it's my mission
Let that verse be, be your mercy listen 2x

Verse 2 :
Forgot about me so I let the blockbuster
In the record store Isle three door knob covered
The connoisseur I kinda saw her
Cheating by the looks, predicted miles
Knew their styles, it was textbook
No love for the allies
I ignored all eyes
Cause when I look through their smiles it was all lies
I'mma let that breathe
Only out of breath
When truth is all I speak
I'm plotting for revenge
Don't grab assumption going ape shit
Fight mode I'm mashing buttons
Mr. Burns, my powers plant
Howd you do that? Don't know a random thing
My bad never meant to conquer kings
With this Laserbeam
Ain't exist, bitch stay woke
We live in Stranger Things
Been raising brands in Instagram
I'm serial scope your house watch the birds-go
Realness when horror scopes through you window
Never wanted jewelry there was gems in I
Vintage bogey from Philly, Kumusta?
For people who don't know then Tang-ina
Google translate these codes for despise

Chorus 2x
