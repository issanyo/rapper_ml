On a lyrical high on cloud 9
Good Vibez
R.I.P. Trayvon Martin

[Verse 1: RichyR.I.C.H.]

Rare, Hip Hop got me sweating
Back & forth wet gravel pitching & I'm hitting
Planning till eons, About to lean & shoot like leon
Glow bright like a neon
Imperial, gotta be in top so reciprocal
As I total recall killing mics is my protocol
Double edged sword, pierces like jaws
Theme song, wuh wuh wuuuuh
From the holster make them draws
Glass jaws when in hulk mode, red, so
Turn to stewie when I need my money owed
Fix up hommes, Look like a true homme
Its disrespect if I ever beat in my home
Hands on both cheeks, under the covers, home alone
Hate when pride lingers, it goes on & on, on your face, nuh linga
Holding on the boomerang
Both thumbs behind the buckle like my name was pootie tang
Had grudges on my back similar to atlas
Found Christ, then loved my neighbors at last
Blasting emo's, redrum'ing their mentality
Take time, patience, you will get your money
Its not sticky but jam? Hare motion
Lowkey flex before they jel man
Please take notion, Forget Bitter Subjects
Cut their connections, Rip BS heads from their twisted necks
The bill to high, my real bro is Clinton
Wouldn't see that nigga even if I had permission
Emit mad hate & he'll be steel smashin'
Its unbelievable, my granddad still smashin;
Aiming from stealth height onto a Stone Island
Factory workers, prepare for landing
At least you stay strong fam
Snooze you lose in life
You end up in, wonderland

[Hook]

On a lyrical high on cloud 9
At the end of the day its just me, myself and I
Being optimistic, please don't kill my high
The fuel I run on is called Good Vibez

On a lyrical high on cloud 9
At the end of the day its just me, myself and I
A sudden change causes a lot mazza
Through my ups & downs I shout cawabunga

On a lyrical high on cloud 9
At the end of the day its just me, myself and I
Being optimistic, please don't kill my high
The fuel I run on is called Good Vibez

On a lyrical high on cloud 9
At the end of the day its just me, myself and I
A sudden change causes a lot mazza
Through my ups & downs I shout cawabunga

[Verse 2: RichyR.I.C.H.]

Snap out of it kiddo, Ok, whatever Kidult
Why are you still broke, Don't speak brokenese kinfolk
Off licence, degrading other mc's
Its common sense to draw their files to see if their now deceased
Sin City Theme I praise eloheim
Relive my dreams and nightmares, Evolve a teen with prayers
Obssessed with Royal faces, Silohuotte figures who move in paces
Solemen with rhythm lace this, Enemies who chase Rich
Cut out the wicked one like stencil
Niggas locked in cages for bussin' lead, that's what I call a pencil
Conduct on that premise, Formula formed like chemist
She don't know slang, does she know what a pen is
Apply different strokes hardcore like Bruce willis
Its the alchemist, ignoring all my voltas, whatever happens I shout
Hakuna matata, also cawabunga
