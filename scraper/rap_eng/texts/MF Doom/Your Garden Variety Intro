"IF YOU AIN'T GET IT FROM THE BAKERY IT AIN'T RIGHT"

[Verse: Var]
Y'all niggas played out, better get some new lines
Trying to step? We spit dirty, so get your shoe shined
No croutons
All about the salad though
Smoking on a salad bowl
No blunts it don't matter though
Got high hopes take your bowls and we shatter those
Then we take your blunts, because I prefer the latter though
Climbing up the ladder
Trying to get higher than Saturn
Lame niggas pitch game but I'm the designated batter
Or hitter
You're the runt of the litter I feel bad for ya
You get her but you don't ever hit like she Sabathia
I take a bath in her
She smell like lavender
Hit it seven times till she weak like a calendar
She Dodge you, I'm your Challenger
Buy her new whips, I charge her for every visit
This ain't quidditch but I sweep her up and score
Yea I'm winning when I capture her
Var on the track and I'm lapping ya

[Breakdown]
This is, not your garden variety
We smoking that fire
Man let me hit my supplier
He got a goddamn variety
He got a goddamn var- uh huh

This is, not your garden variety
We smoking that fire
Man let me hit my supplier
He got a goddamn variety
