This is dedicated inundated with nothing but mad flavor

Rather have a golden age
And I'm not talking about sweet 16's
Or spipping the sweets to teens
Or police that pull the trigger to kill a nigga
Yeah i said nigga kinda out of the ordinary
So what makes it extraordinary
I'm so in touch with my feelings
I mean the language of the soul
So fuck your demon- diablo host to the parasite
I got a pair of eyes plus a third
So i see your face shimmer of paradise
Between her thighs
In the naked I can tell your absurd
And you emcees spit so many lies
It smells like your ass hurt
I walk on grass floors
So bare feet compare me
To some riches try to find a tree
So you can climb into the sky
Say goodbye!


Now I can't see nobody else inside
Sometimes I just wanna go home and cry
Not wanted no more
Nobody ever loved me no no
Can't you see I'm not wanted no more
And nobody ever loved me no mo
No mo


I'm mister Mo-Jo rising to the sun
Clap your hands for everyone
All the children of the brown color
Stand up and make the world yours
Naah-
I don't tote guns
I do drugs sometimes
But its only for fun
I never meant to hurt no one
I play the innocent too often
I do sin
I have sexual urges
I curse
But i love it when my baby wrap her legs around me
Shit my momma would have a fit, if i said this shit
So i just keep it for me
Yo i needed some help
I grab a book off of the shelf
And i learn that i am the king of my own mind

Light makowski
Everybody wanna see me fail
So they can come and oust me
But throw up your confetti
And lets have a party
Because the worlds going to hell
Oh well I lead it to sail
On the good she Jesus
Its been through some shit

"My names deM atlaS hi
Can you tell me your name once again"
"Its so and so do you come here often"
"Nah not enough, its been awhile since I've seen your smile"


I just wanna be young free and wild and peace out
