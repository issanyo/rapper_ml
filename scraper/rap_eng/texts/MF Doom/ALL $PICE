[Intro]
Yeah yeah
DOOM on the beat

[Verse 1]
I'm Michael Jordan with the kike out sportin
And a knife for warnin' that's just right for sportin'
I feel like I need a piss but I ain't gonna miss the Sisyphus when he licking his lips
And the lipstphus when he syphilis and shit
That's them prison bars
You from Venus I'm from Mars
Burn you til you're charred
This ain't about spice its about the nice rice with spice
Diced and spliced till its ready and nice
This ain't just that Jamaica pepper
This that myrtle pepper
This that mortal heifer
All heifers are mortal
No heifers immortal
Get stuffed in the chortle
With the storkle I'm immortal
And I'm in the fort full
Of soldiers
They arms like boulders
That's the war on drugs, back in '08
I need more fawn hugs, stack them flow fates
In the realm of shrugs you get more hate

[Hook]
This is for the grinding spices
Them spices that can't be nices
Them spices who from the antilles
Them spices who ain't so silly

[Verse 2]
To reiterate there is no greater fate
Than to be in the inchoate state in the slate
With allspice, there is no rice
You'll get sliced till you ain't got no eyes
And we'll steal all your ice
And spice with rice
Them Indians ruled the world
Now we just gettin' swirled like little girls


[Outro]
Ah yeah
Let that marinate for a bit
I need that pure as shit spice man
I'm suffering
I need more time
You just hurt a woman and shnucka
Never flipped without a brotha
