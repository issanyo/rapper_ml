It’s the youngets black skinhead ever seen in any kids park
Never outside only take long strolls after dark
Niggas stop bitching cause nigga we just wishing and nigga we just waiting to see yall niggas drop
Tee wearing god meeting friends at the rock
A key to a door that’s already been unlocked
I remain unstable, no one is comparable, saying someone’s better just became a new told fable
Hmm. He gasses himself, no not really man you just belittled yourself
Attack and delivery is always good so keep high with stealth
Yall melt. I just remain icy cold. Yet he’s only 1-5 old, but heart made pure of gold
And he shuts down shit like parades shut down roads
He’s a funny little sucka, punched the kid in the face to show he wasn’t a bluffa, 26 kids backdown or squad up, 5 finger kiss of death, so you better pucker up
Weapon concealed. Pocket tucked, running out of luck, trying to make a buck, get Jomie tatted in his knucks. What a schmuck!
The kid’s going buck!
Killing every rap and beat like I'm amuck
Like he was running out of hope, running to see the pope
Blessings help save him from the rope
Know he's good so his skill stays on the low
Know he’s good, so bragging he’d never show

[Sample] Viktor Vaughn (MF DOOM)

It's like the same hustle bro, two knuckles glow
Tucked in Le Tigre, just let the name buckle show
