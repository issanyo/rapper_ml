[Verse]

In the eye of a storm, better grab an umbrella
I tell ya', these niggas lie hella, I'm a fly fella
I'm living these lines, and they sharp as propellers
These bars will be ripe forever, 5-ever
Go harder then guerillas, don't you ever forget us
You wanna grow up and be strong? Better eat your lettuce
This is basically the opposite of make believe
My conscience doesn't run stably
Even leaving convicts unconscious
Or leave em' sneezing cause my flows sicker then sinuses
You go incognito and got people silent
When I beast you face turn indigo, niggas get violent
Every single day I tranquilize em'
Got a problem?
Every time you rhyming its like litter
You sighing, and acting all bitter
You lacking and jacking, I'm a hard hitter
I'm the reason for blizzards
And when its spring season people get sicker
Haters looking through a peep-hole just bicker
Strong bragging about how you dicks bigger fag
I'm complete antonym of espionage
Dropping bombs in your area, a barrage
Cut you goblins arms off in my garage and examine em'
Niggas faker them some mannequins stop the shenanigans
All you rap about is banging and brains
You ashamed, and you look like an orangutan, and you say we the same
No I'm insane, my dad you should aim to be a mc not a rapper. These lames need to change cause I rage in the stuff
Dang I bet you like "is there one song where he don't bluff?"
But I flex and you rapping just to fuck
Then you say "huh?" quit acting like you ain't know what I'm talking about, you just want sluts
I'm busting through the game like my left nuts
And mama excuse the times I cussed
But the joint is like Obama being appointed, expect I'm annoyed
I'm pissed off, you think I'm ready for liftoff?
I'm ready crush and leave enemies in the dust
You getting an enema, I'm increasing my stamina
Digesting anyone who don't believe my standards
This will not be a standoff, I'll definitely disintegrate you til' Santa's
Day, Christmas, I'm on your wish list
