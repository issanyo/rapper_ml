[Verse 1: Infinite Sidd]

It's Infinite Sidd, with a riddle for your heads
He a sphinx, pyramids twist with his go 'head
He a God, no stop it. Just a mere man
With a story to tell like Sawyer
Soon as he saw ya, you lost your sense of pride
He mesmerized, getting mine is my only goal in life
At least until I've died twice, might I advice a few to step aside, I'm Jesus
This a couple days too premature, wait to
Stop and stare too, bitch
I ate too quick, need a toothpick
Your face too stiff, why you play stupid?
