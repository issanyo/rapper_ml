Aiite aiite
Cause its the Zobha with the attitude
Hilary
Hilary Oh Hilary
Where you have been my entire life?

[Verse 1: Black Fin]

Mr police man, mr police man!
Please don't shoot
I've had a couple things
Feeling really nice
But I’m just tryna commute
You see where I’m from
A taxi only half a buck
Which means at this present moment I’m stuck
(How you so broke?)
Ay! My life is kind of situated south of  consistent
Making my mission to write the ultimate symphony
For my dream girl Hilary
Yeah, the one in the t.v
You see I’m kinda of the guy, who likes shower the kisses
Kissing the kiss so that I never miss cause...
I’ve been known to aim  a little to the right
I’d like to put the light a little lower if i may
So I can serenade you like a tenor
Nessun Dorma, next thing the door go boom!
Why your daddy back so soon?
And now my ears be ringing
I guess he has a thing for clapping the brothers
But who care? when you looking so superb like your mama
And you can pick her either or
You think a burly man, clawing at my neck will make me pay less respect to all that?
You must be trippin
But now I’m thinking that I’m in it now
For my girl Hilary


Oh Hilary
Where you have been my entire life?
Hilary oh Hilary
Where you have been my entire life?
Hilary oh Hilary
Where you have been my entire life?
Hilary Oh Hilary (Hilary Hilary)
I think your daddy getting a knife!
