[Intro]
I'm a fool i believe
I'm a fool i believe
Like Q-T-I-P
I believe

[Verse 1: Sage]
Will you take away my sons mandrake too?
It'll scream and to anyone who hears fatal
A baby crying in the night
Do i wear earmuffs block out
Its sheets loosen mine tight
Its crib like prison bars
My crib my escape leisure
Cesars palace in milan it train my dog
Baby unleash scissor cut it off!
Like me all it want is a bottle pacify
On a boat become pacificised
Swim in Medi-terrain
I an o.k. fisher but a better sage
If i get paid than i can't lay
If i don't get paid baby can't lay neither
Of us exercise happiness synchronised
The only time is when we lock eyes
Mini me of course get up
Spit cry vomit i'll be your towel
Spit cry vomit when you eat be your bib
Wipe it up so you squeak so clean
So fresh i give that to you
It's one or the other i give to others
And another (x7)but

[Bridge: Sage]
I'm a fool i believe
That all i do i do it cognitively
That's what i do retire like Mark Henry
Say I'm gonna stop but i can't and
Won't
If it strains the growth of my seed
Deprive myself so i can flourish
Like Q-T-I-P i believe

[Verse 2: Sage]
There's love
Easy to affect but hard to say
Lose words tongue leads brain astray
Actions seem enough but it's not though
The card is the present not the box in the bow
Not the contents of it but what is written
Legible but the pen not the only fountain
Flick cents in Fontana Di Trevi when in Rome
Paris Tokyo even within the confines of your own home
If you can afford that
Maybe hear cries in the night that
Let you know you wanted without a criminal record
A record for being the best father
Wear the shirt that he bought when he become mature
Be the best hubba to his mother
That's what money can't buy
It can buy you a high rise but it can't make you rise high
Like a hot air balloon get that warm feeling inside
Then touch the sky
