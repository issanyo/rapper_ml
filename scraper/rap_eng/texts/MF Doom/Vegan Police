Blessing the mic with this krylon spit I got a lot to say but ive only got so many days, minutes, seconds, hours. I keep it truth to power. Words wash your mind clean like youre taking a shower (hey) ladies dont love me yet, I know they'll pretend cause when that fame hits I know my name gets a little nicer. It gets a nice ring suddenly like delivery. Open the door up, I'll let you keep the package cause posdnuos said that physical dies with time and I dont know why man, no I dont know why (why?) everytime I come around brothas wanna clown but im just having a ball im here to (get down) straight funky with the vibe thats just what it is, feel the rhythm, look alive, cmon move your hips. When was the last time you heard it like this? Who was the last rapper that you couldn't diss? Now riddle me this, go down the list, who's really potent? Who's needed? Who's really dropping knowledge? Who's the illest wheat bread loving mic killer? Who's that kid with many styles? The vegan lover

(I dont know man, I dont know man, I dont know man, I dont know, I dont know, I dont know)

But they call him cee-won x! Word up the best in your perimeter, hes taking over with the sons of the tongue (who?)

(I dont know man, I dont know man, I dont know man, I dont know, I dont know, I dont know)

But they call me cee-won x and ill never-ever rest until im heard and getting fed off my raps (eating!)
Frustrated cause all these wack rappers get the shine, they got fans and go on tour the whole nine but I dont mind too much cause imma get mines, my word is law you can't stop the prophet. 500 deep and we keeping it live, rocking. Bigger than this rap shit I bring the change, knock it. I know you will, appreciated is hated first so do your worst. I welcome your words cause they dont really mean much. Who are you to tell me who I be? You stay hitting with all that negativity. You think you're free but you're a prisoner to hate. Vacate my space with that knowledge you lack. Come back and see me when you on the right track kid. I wish you well, really I do this is all true. I keep it moving, reminiscing on some better days. Wrong time right place my friend
