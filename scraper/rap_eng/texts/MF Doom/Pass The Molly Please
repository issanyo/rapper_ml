[Verse 1: Infinite Sidd]
On the microphone with the same high that killed Geronimo Stilton, or at least the children
I'm sober now, hoping that the codeine don't get thrown around;
No, no no
I'm vulnerable
Fuck this shit, let's go to the hook

[Hook]
If I had a million dollars, I'd buy another wallet
Or maybe a sauna, make me look hotter

If I had a million dollars, I'd put myself inside ya
Speaking to the women, don't make me say pause, uh
Pause, haha
