My complexity
Catch me on a block
In northern 70s
Complexion?
Sesame
Smack a ref Yo
Fuck a penalty
See I lead the A
For my specialty
Y the way that
Letters end for me

Wide awake
Infamy
Fade away, don't know
How rich you get
Can't believe
Ya death certificate
In the morning
She on all fours
The Head elated
Like to think about a Great Escape
She Told me Have it all
I take it

Think I made it out of peril
I only see the world far enough
That I can flee the epidural
Never had a moment
Had 'em plural
Before I'm gone
Paint oil-painted murals of my girl
If I can keep one

Kinda hard
Yo I'm a seeker
Do anything and everything
To Involve my reason
Shorty from DR
Her father had to re-up
Fam hungry, gotta appear
Passed the K off
In a 900 Kia

I Rather keep it easy
Never know who's watching
NYPD
Have 'em knocking
Pressing bells
Slam
That's how they
Took my man El
Damn
Not a day slide
That I don't
Hawk the mailman

Jamaicans used to serve me
By the lakelands
But then we cooled it
When we saw a man in Ray Bans
Not the Aviator
He look more like
The mediator
No jail time is greater
Flushed out like radiators

Back to Housing
The setbacks is mounting
Deathtrap Manhattan
Reach out to land surrounding me
Grand Ave accounted me
Jersey for the council
Shorty trying to bounce
Yo supply her with a mouthful

Rhyme flyer than me?
Kind of doubtful
I need time to
Clear my mind
But only time
Is what I'm out for

Mental anguish
If I'm out looking real anxious
It's cause I'm darker
Than carpet bombs
When I'm Lurking through
Parking lots
