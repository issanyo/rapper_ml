[Verse]
I swear, life just ain't fair
And I could barely gather up enough feelings to care
They wanna see us at the bottom so I had to prepare
Cuz like I'm third wheelin', I know I don't wanna be there
I move wild but aware since a child I knew I would be here
I said it loud, still nobody would hear
But if a tree falls in the forest and you ain't near
Does it still make a sound or will sound disappear?
Huh? Exactly, just as I expected
Knew if I kept droppin' they'd hear it at any second
They thought I would be second, but nah, I'm not settlin'
I'm movin' nomadic, I ain't packin' any estrogen
I had to man up, view the world from a second lens
Now what I do, they jack it like letterman
So honestly it don't bother me who I'm better than
I make songs that change thought, and spark better men
I'm extraterrestrial, you think we better men
My mob 5 deep, and the third locks me in
So, I be feelin' like I gotta win
You Radames and rider mans, have gotta end
Your juice is minute made, mine live again
I'm Infinite, like I'm unsigned Eminem, yeah
I been torn like limb from limb
Was sleeper, now reaper like Mr. Grim, yeah
I made the cut like I went and trimmed
Now I blow them all away like tents in winds
Still I'm here, lonely and the craftiest
Probably the saddest, but his music is the happiest
'fro is the nappiest, I'm tryna be the savviest
I get that we here to connect like magnets
I'm never draggin' it, they think that I am
I'm been thinkin' passin' it, it's like the pain's an exam
Closed off like the cabinets, It's just who I am
Givin' a damn, I guess it's a habit of man

[Hook]
Look, I aim high like tubesocks
I'm tryna shoot for the sky like it's rooftops
I know that they could see the rise like new stocks
So I'm headed for the rooftops, headed for the rooftops
I been headed for the rooftops
I been headed for the rooftops, headed for the rooftops
I been headed for the rooftops
I been headed for the rooftops, yeah
