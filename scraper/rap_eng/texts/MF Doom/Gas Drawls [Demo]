It's that butter shit niggas know I always never stutter with
Check the styles, check it, uh, peep it

[Verse 1]

I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
Shit, an instant, get smoked like Winston - cancers
And cut halves through them gangsters, too
In real life, the real trife scene
Might steal your life with the assault machine
Rifle, dead up, it's a setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
X, the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run from off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal, to the streets
To my peeps, ??? beats
Like the weapons of war
Now you keep from steppin' on my floor, or delivery front door
Special ed, y'all motherfuckers master yours
My disaster causes you: Hell.. in them gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chills
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown, in the comforts of your own home
Grown, big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, I keep the sty on my eye swollen

Bitch, nigga, switch the style
X a massive-versatile
Big up to Monster Isle

I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Peep it

[Verse 2]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for (you), two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers who's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
That every hooker heard o', next to malicious murder
A track type vicious fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O to predict ya last pause
I told you, Hell and gas drawls, breakin'
Glass and plastic jaws like federal drastic laws
Fed up from fightin' secret wars with them Fantastic Fours (invisible bitch)
Versus Doom wit' the metal face before I go to state
The ho better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace - steady like tricycles
Beware all suckers is froze like icicles
I'm baggin' bitches like nickels
Cause I licked 'em where they tickle before I hit the clit though
I'ma split till I pronounce, more hits than a ounce no doubt
About to bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out

[Outro]
And I like to give a shout to my man Jet Jaguar
You know, D-Smooth, ??? One
Master of the O
I call this joint
In hell with them Gas Drawls
