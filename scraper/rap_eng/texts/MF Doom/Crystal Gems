[Intro: dJ Ghost]
Now, bring it back one more time

[Verse 1: dJ Ghost]
It's the masked lyricist
With the speed force flows
Villains plead for the source of his powers
But nobody knows
Sour cowards trynna to expose
The superHero
But only catch lyrical elbows
Cuz villainous rappers be confused
They way they over doin it
With sex, guns, and drugs
And flows that's more than putrid
Bunch of silly excuses
They never learn so they're useless
Defeated by the mask
Because of their own hubris
Cuz superHero shine bright like a crystal gem
Turn a villain into a henchmen
With the stroke of the pen
Amen when superHero makes it to the scene
Mr. Queen precision when he rides on beat
Speedy Arsenal with Apollo
You need to come and see
The dynamic duo lights up the show like Jubilee
Guaranteed on the price of entry
Full intrigue
Into the masked vigilante
With another trick up his sleeve
Now bring it back
Like McRib heart attacks
Fantastic 4/4s flows harder than Ben Grimm
Slim chance these villains will outshine
Cuz superHero got more rhymes
Than booty shorts in the summertime
Yet villainous rappers be confused
They way they over doin it
With chains, hoes, and clothes
And flows that's more than putrid
Bunch of silly excuses
They never learn so they're useless
And if you don't believe him
He'll just let Apollo tell it like

[Verse 2: Apollo]
Save the damsel in distress
And give her back to her man
She's enamored
But I gotta chase my passion
Defeat these villainous rappers
SuperHero on the scene in flash
Dripping in all gold with lightning in one hand
We glowing like crystal gems
Gotta brighten up the night time
When I close my eyes
I’m seeing myself at new heights
SuperHero never fronting
‘Bout that action like it’s nothing
Eating beats just like a luncheon
Rollin deep like Brady Bunches
Man we pulled up to the function
In the invisible whip
Watching villains jump ship
Aqualad on the mix
I’m the sword and the hilt
Born with impervious skin
Saving lives is my will
Man you can call me a
