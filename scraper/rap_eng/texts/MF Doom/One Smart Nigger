Hey whitey, you and your punk friends killed my man
(Please, don't kill me, I didn't mean to do it

The black was in the trunk, dead

We must not sit back and be spectators
We must um (Killing is good), uh, uh, then we must uh, take a position
And if we're taking any (Killing blacks) meaningful or useful action, then that's our responsibility also

You disgusting men are filled with deceit

Yip-Yip, what's that?

You won't get away with this cracker

Not much we can do against men like them

(And what do you think I should do?)

You won't get away with this cracker
(Men, he's to stop me)

You must all prepare yourself for what will happen

African diversity is substantially greater, significantly greater than diversity of Saharan African
Uh, this is what you would expect in an older population
The original population of anatomically modern humans

They know exactly what they're doing

Fiction or drama

God has chosen to him to lead him to victory
(That's all I need to know from you)

They claim power in the name of God and they control people through fear and suffering and cold blooded murder but now that's going to end

Look out the window
