Repeat repeat the question. The heat get you heated but Peter the pan pan crow cause I can’t stand, Sad kids stuck again in a never land, Miscommunication causing complications all the time. They’re f*cking lies half-truths to satisfy the human mind! But you caught my drift quick and the point is this: Don’t trip and just dip. Don’t trip and just dip. Repeat, repeat the question. You’re neat and you’re fleeting with passion, When we’re rolling in your jeep I’m dancing in my seat deep
We creep -like tlc -so street -like a freak. I never talk sh*t like a weak geek only weekly, On the weekends -shout out to my dead friends Prophets past poets that always kept me going and I’m showing off. I’m blowing off, im blowin up, blowing in the wind, like dinner while you’re killing it! Im willing but im not free-will in it. I like the way it taste please don’t let it go to waste. I like your face, and I love toothpaste. Please stay for awhile, With that pretty smile, stay for awhile
