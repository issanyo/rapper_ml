MF DOOM - “Doomsday (Mister Jason Remix)”
[Emcee(s): MF DOOM]
[Producer(s): Mister Jason]
[Scratches: Mister Jason]

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like ponytails: tight and bob a lot
Stop, stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly, brown, sickled, sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It’s an intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped, then release
A statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF?  You silly
I’d like to take “Mens to the End” for two milli’
“Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!”  That’s an audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble. yo
Watch your own back.  Came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone, turn H2O to Cognac

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by Mister Jason]

“Operation: Doomsday”

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
I wrote this one in B.C.D.C. O-section
If you don’t believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on C-Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if ain’t no escape, blame MF tape
Definition: “Supervillain,” a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I’m trading science fiction with my man, the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime.  Get out
My face, asking ‘bout my case.  You need toothpaste
Refresher mint, monkey-style nigga the Dentadent
And dope fiends still in their teens, shook niggas turn
Witness, real mens mind their own business
That’s the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that’s
Double Dutch, how come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.’s make rounds, never had ox found
On shakedown, lockdown, wet dreams of Fox’ Brown

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Some M-er F-ers don’t like how Sally walk
I’ll tell y’all fools it’s hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let it interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nibbling tip of nipple: Metal Fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang, known amongst
Foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang guzzled out a rusty tin
Can.  Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang!  Crime don’t pay.  Listen, youth
It’s like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spitting all out the sunroof through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turnt it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife, able
To drop today’s math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap.  Far as rap, touch the mic
And get the same shit a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil?  He on another level
It’s a word!  No, a name!  MF the Supervillain!

[Outro: MF DOOM]
Doomsday!
