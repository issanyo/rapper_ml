The way these artists spitting, it's ridiculous
I'm sick of this, no syphilis, I'm listening to Infinite
Reminiscing, on dissing wishing more niggas would spit like this
Cause now they spit like shit, when it comes to skill, they're missing it
It's why I've come to kill and disinfect, who am I dissing next?
I'm in to cleanse this rap shit from it's sickening rep, so listen quick
This is my fucking mission, shit, you had your chance, now zip it bitch
I'm here to cleanse cause you dropped the soap, you fucking prison bitch

I rarely hear "You sound like another artist"
Prolly cause the only one I sound like is Incarnate
Comparing me to rappers you sound quite retarded
I'ma continue to kill this shit regardless/

Lyrically murderous these verses just disperse from him
Serving up the worst, like a nurse coming to hurt you some
Better show nice respect, I don't like neglect
Show it, I'll slice your neck heaven on the mic, I wreak
Blurting more words than the dude who says medicine's side effects
Breaking the rap sound barrier and leaving a path like fighter jets

So don't act surprised my batch of rhymes got you magnetized
My appetite's as high as that of flying satellites
Don't have to lie in my songs, I know my truthful raps suffice
Meanwhile you mask your identity, what you have to hide?
Find me destroying your block, more boiling hot
Than Wiz when you foil his plot to enjoying some pot

If you gon' spit something have adequate resources for enforcement
Never forcing only endorsing knowledge worth more porcelain
And this only a portion of the potion I'm pouring but it's more than
You'll be awarded by bumping artists who are worse than me
Hope this reward is worth it cause I pour on verses
More than bible studies so I could steady make them more than perfect
I already orbit earth and chill like it's the norm, observing
How this war is hurting our earth and how I can't do more than serve this verse I'm serving
I'm certain that you couldn't scratch the surface of the words I'm blurting
Whenever I'm bursting verbs I'm shaking worse than first time surgeons and virgins
Bout to first insert their worm inside another person's skirt and
I'ma be the first bird to blurt these words, cause the early bird gets the dirty worm
Even though I wake up late, beat that early bird like it's a nerdy bird
Steal that pretty worm and fly off flipping the other bird the bird
In every possible way I'ma hurt these jerks
