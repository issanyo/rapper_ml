[Verse 1: end*]
I'm going brazy i'm going crazy
Your momma hate me but i'm chilling cause i'm busy drilling a hole in your ceiling
Waves are strong the audio make a nigga run cardio
This ain't no game no mario
Sorry hoe i don't remember
B-day it's the g-day 5th of september
Want in on profit plus? you not a member
Remember my name when i pop off the game
Finna get lame niggas on me like a glue stick
Depressed niggas be obsessed with acoustic
You ain't listening to the bars you listening to the music
Am i not amusing?
Niggas using tactics to end me but you end up losing
You ain't listening you hearing
Flow so fast; i'm a different entity, a different being
Niggas looking at me weird like they sightseeing
Niggas be agreeing that i'm a goat
I'm too hot can't touch the ground i just float
This shit my tunnel vision
When i speak you shut up and listen
Me and you are in different divisions
My precision and consistency got these rappers miserably listening
And witnessing the great that is I
To all my dead niggas fly high
Working from august to july
No rest no sleep
Work so hard i might end up deceased
So i pop a xan abroad with a few broads comitting treason
I wake up in the fall it's end's season
I do this shit for no reason
But if i were asked for my reasoning
It would be to get insta whores at my crib in the evening
While they lay down recieving my dick up they ass
With a blunt on my lip, mad gas
Hand the mic over trash we need to wrap this shit up fast

[Verse 2: Naturally Trash]
I been sharp my whole life
Til life stabbed me in the gut and sharpened a whole knife
Movin with the Money Gang herd like some bisons
I'm here to fight shit, one two, K.O., Mike Tyson
You don't write your lyrics you just bite shit
I ain't here to fuckin bite shit
I'm here to unload a weapon
And leave the whole building in silence, in silence
Lights out and everybody start to scramble
I got a guard to watch the guard to watch the guard that holds the candle, hollup
And that's somethin you can't handle
Fuck with Profit, get manhandled
Cut the training wheels off of a little kid's tricycle
It's ironic how life is, a fuckin hot icicle
Fuck the internet, Imma do it by the book
There ain't no such things as halfway crooks, I mean
If your gonna load a gun you might as well shoot it
Add that to the list of things I done that's stupid
Somebody with nothing to lose is fuckin scary
If I'm Clint Eastwood, you can call me Dirty Harry
