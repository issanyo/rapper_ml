I'm not like hov
I've never been hustling big
I'm not the bossman, I know that I am not running this ship
I'm just a small fish who is having its fun in the sea
Black Adder of rap, ain't no one is cunning as me
Go run and see, got knights taht are gunning at me
In addition the dictionary people coming for me
Breaking the language as sweet as a geeky woman could be
The flow's magic, don't panic though
Houdini's got nothing on me
Nine bars and I am having my fun
Don't want to brag my son, but I am smarter than them
If you're listening wondering where this banter is from
I'm from Poland, motherfucker, call it land of the strong
Do a light bulb joke, I'll shove it up in your ass
And you'll be asking
How the fuck this Pollack done it so fast
Slick like the genie, fly like a Palladin's rug
A barbarian coming through
All you palladins duck
You're
All out of luck, 'cause I don't plan to give up
Until I'm gold-pantie-rich, call me Kylie Minouge
But for now, I'm just some regular paranoid bloke
Doing voice-crimes, they should have my larynx revoked


Yes, I know I was bragging again
It's in the essence of hip-hop, so it's hardly a sin
Just so you know: if you're thinking of harming me, friend
I'll form my motherfucking  syllables to armies and win
Everybody's screwing each other
Like the monogamy's dead
I saw my nemesis and said:
Dude, aren't we friends?
Fuck y'all too
I am not saying sorry again
Your lives fueled with fake smiles
Bunch of Barbies and Kens
Alright, so I exaggerated a bit
But all you haters should be smacked, feel the pain in your lip
To any folks out there who may hate me to bits
You goota know, The doctor said I'm crazy as shit
I'm gonna' brainstorm now
It should be raining a bit
So, you better keep yor cats in home
Lady, I am sick
I'm infected with drums
Hear the snare and the kick
You can't learn rhythm, dummy
You inherit the shit
Hear the kick and the snaring
And all other percussions that are filling different layers
Listen to kicking and clicking and throw your fists in the air
The revolution's coming and it'll be there in the bit
I'm wordtwisting 'till it hurts to listen
I curse when I'm spitting
Fucking sharing my wit
Matter of fact, gimmie the throne
The rest I'll have:
Some nice tunes ,  gin&tonic
And an the xbox pad


The beat drops
Bitchslap him again. You all thought
The kid's gone, kid is rapping again
Rap considered to be gone, now it's Back with the Wind
That he produces with his lips, when he actually spits
He's such a kid, he's got pedophiles kiddnaping him
In a previous life he might've been Eminem
Before his soul died, when Ritalin kicked in
And destroyed the legendary Shady villain in him
FV, watch him killing the men, responsible for hip-hops's overfilling with trends
You motherfuckers raped the muses, now you stealing from them
If you don't like him, then suck all the vanilla from him
And nobody's ever interfering with him
You better start the fucking cheering
When you're nearing on him
And be giving him six beers
Better do it quickly
Cause the third-person talking is fatiguing to him
