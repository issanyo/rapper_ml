[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wish that I can travel back in time
So I can fix all the things that I can't rewind
There's not a specific dateline
My whole life's been pretty repined
I rather be underground covered in columbine
Every time I call you I get declined
The ones that can't see our talent must be blind
Those are the same ones that don't give a dime
Cause they're too busy doing the wine and dine
Use so much spice but they don't got the thyme
I've had a brother arrested for hitting a grind
I still don't think skateboarding is such a crime
Suicide is on my the mind
Contemplating every night
Said I wouldn't make it big but whose in the spotlight
All of these are such simple lines
But you won't get it with your simple mind
The flow is crazy but I still got the timing
Now we blowing up like Osama bin laden
Been through wars have many knives in my back
That doesn't stop me from spitting on the track
That's a check mate you better take a drawback
It's V's up are you trying to hacked
While I'm sitting in the back using a black hat
Pull out a Mac you could hear the click clack
I'm not sick but I'm coughing on the track
Mess with the squad and a coffins where you at
I'm not trying get signed
I'm just always on my grind
Money's not on the mind
There's never time to unwind
Yeah

[Chorus]
Grinding and sliding
The words I'm combining
The rhymes I'm providing
All from the top of my head I'm deciding

[Verse 2]
As I walk outside there's a light brisk in the air
But at this moment in time I really don't care
Life in itself I can't really bare
But it all disappears when I step onto the chair
Kick it back no longer living in despair
Hanging out with some brand new neckwear
The threats that come along this path I am aware
You can't do anything else just send a prayer
Little brother where are you going
You're giving me a scare
Sister please I'm not going anywhere
You can save your tears
Such a busy life you're a manager at Clair's
For you to look after me it doesn't seem fair
I can hold myself up this ain't child care
I'm saying this cause I want the end to be near
Can't see my future cause my visions impaired
Don't wanna be a millionaire
I just wanna set square
Not even the Lord's Prayer
Can repair this nightmare
