[Verse 1]
The only entity in this room Is my mentality
Mixed with my insanity But I put my time aside
Just to get better rhymes From my third eye
More visuals is better for Your rhymes
Im not gonna lie Im pretty scared to die
But im never gonna hide From death
Shit, I took a step closer Closer to the steps
I wanna go to heaven But shit, I ain't afraid of hell
Wanted reincarnation but this is my last try
Always was known as a wise guy
Looking from the birds eye So say I'm flyer than high
Take the time to sigh I'll say goodbye
Say Good night

[Verse 2]
I'm just chasing the gold I was distributed by demons
I'm looking for dead presidents
In my bank
Shit hasn't been the same ever since the ship sank
Amen for the a-list
Just a useless rank I got what it takes
If you ain't making records
Imma set the record straight
My education, is over these teachers heads
But they still doubt me in the music industry
What's the difference, if I grow up to be
A businessman Or a fucking rapper
Y'all lying through your teeth, spit the real sheet
People don't know the real me, they see synthetic sides
I hide inside my mind, just to get
Away from time
Because all we got is memories, standing on a balcony
Look at everything, none if it is mine
It's crazy Everything you see
It's just a depiction of fiction, every crack
Cocaine and heroin addiction
Everything you have witnessed it's just movie of visions
Even this music ain't real
What are you talking about?
