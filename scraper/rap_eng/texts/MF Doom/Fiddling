[Verse 1: Mikey]
This the first step for achieving the inner peace that you seek through the readings
The snakes and the viruses blood out the irises
And my third eye blinded by the sciences
I'm on mind guided shit
Play the violin and preach violence on the roof tops we huddle in
I smuggle in kilos of butter then break bread in the gutter with the other man
'cuz the conflict is constant and I'm the better man
With the weed and xannies
'cuz life's too short to get hung up on family or bullshit whatever
Stop stressing
Your present is past you your future is brand new
That's cliche whatever
But I got revelations on days
When the weather don't rain
Got demons and dames withering away
Got bills that just sprung up
So don't get hung up

[HOOK]
Life's too short to get hung up

[Verse 2: Mikey]
I knew I was evil genius
When I met the priestess
And unleashed this fiend
That feast on the all the lobbyist
Your word should be your work not a team full of bodies with no hobbys that's obvious
But try to just
Imagine us a world full of strategists
That act in opposition to the curve and the word is the currency exchanged
And the wuwei is balanced and the poon tang is bountiful
People held accountable
For their actions and interactions
Sans acting a fool and shit said in rap hits
I'm asking for passing the masses
My opium and smoke it like the nicotine that's gassing
Your chakras and rasta around me
Astounding
The limitless foundry of mind I could render
If given an hour of time I remind you
Is useless
I'm lifted you're clueless
This sadbox a movement
Like snakes I'm an agent that's praying for nooses
Resistance is useless
I told you

[HOOK]
Life's too short to get hung up
