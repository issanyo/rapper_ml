(Phone ringing; Phone gets picked up)
Unknown:
Yo, what up?

MF DOOM:
They shot T, T, T from 103
Running from the beat tree
They said he tryna flee
Must've had a key, you know how he be G?
Nah, he she ain't even try to help him
Made the call, yelling and telling
Flipped on her girlfriend, caught him freakin
And wild out
Grabbed her by her face and damn near ripped her eyes out
(we can't hear what you're saying)
Nah, nah, they must've slipped something in his drinking glass
All swollen, rolling, I tried to tell him think fast
Dang, I just seen that nigga too, G
Starting to look like that untrue, G
In CT, he should've stayed with the trees
True beauty, he couldn't see me if the trees was 3-D
Ambulance pampered her out, she was dead
Shots flying, caught him to the chest and head
Got up and fled, probably heading for the leg by the bed
And drug ya man out all cuffed up to gred
Tore the head
Told him slow his roll when I see them dissin
Messin with Suzie Chapstick and them
But did he listen?
No, stupid, knew she was a trick
But had the girl tastin the dick
It happened mad quick
