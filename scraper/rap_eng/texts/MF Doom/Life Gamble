[Verse One]

I'm not your average fella or your hood bandit street dweller
That's selling dope just to stack cheddar
Grandmama thinks that cause my pants sagging
I'mma be influenced by all of them gang-banger
I'm not trynna get caught up in that category
Tell my kids a story about a brother named Cory who got shot
It's that stereotype train of thought, more often then not
Hip-Hop's got veins popping out my cranium
Have them looking like Spontaneum, about to blow up just like an Arabian
I'm going Super Sayian, what you saying, cause I ain't playing
This game of life is filled with snakes and fakes
Gotta look straight, no swerving
Trynna get that higher learning by reading facts
The rest of y'all living your life in white and black
Give them some color like NBC, got them reporting me daily like I'm on CTV
But they watching me through the eagle eye, CBS
Who's the next damsel in distress?
Cause the villains are slipping going to prison, I ain't tripping
I keep my distance from the trouble
Ain't trynna break down like minerals and rubble
So come huddle up, skip class like double dutch
Remember the days I had to hustle if I wanted lunch
Global grinding through the rhyming, I wasn't seeing the green
I had to get my optics focused, my eyes were distorted, out of order
Sorta like the soda machine
High-beams beaming, down the road of success, I peeped the address
Atlantic division is what I rep
I want those Grammies and Junos
Kicking it out in Europe, counting all those Euros
Directing the scenery, like Robert De Niro
I ain't lacking knowledge, so call me knowingly
Negus think I sleep, I never sleep
Cause when I have my eyes closed
I'm always looking through my third eye optical
Hammer throw just like a game of Mario
Paint the picture in your head, call yourself a young Vincent van Gogh
No Mona Lisa, but my life's a motion picture
And I thought I could just, kick it with ya

[Hook]
Life a game, so I'm gambling
Any beat like this I'mma manhandle it
Throw me the dice, watch me body it just like a fight, just like a fight
