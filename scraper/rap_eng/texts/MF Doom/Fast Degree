Ayeo I been at the bottom, barley had shit
Broken bottles, burn holes from cigarettes
Nothing but grease, grime and grit, but I took advantage
Made a life of my own , right through a microphone
And I've gained knowledge
Through every single bit of pain I've been through
And I've learned lessons too
Everybody'll be quick to wanna chill once you the deal
But until then you're surrounded by fools
And that's the thing about fame
Once you get just a little bit of money
Everybody's jumping on your dick
Like some of the motherfuckers that told me to fucking quit
Are ready to hang out on the daily
Like it's amazing man..

I went from practically nothing
To actually having something to do with this music
Mathematics were too confusing
Utilizing my talent
Meant to be a newbie until I got it right
Then i'd be in the spot light rapping
Attacking the ones who dont got juice, like jaali do
Test me, I bet you a dollar that you would probably lose
Most of the rappers in the game
Right now sound the same
All talk, so bite down with your a giant tooth
Murder with guns, thugs and burnt blunts
Got mothers burying their kids some carrying Mac-Tens
Instead recognizing that bullshit over and over
I promote affirmative action
Most of those kids including me
Grew up without real-role-model
Empty bottles when you were thirsty
A mother with two lil ones juggling bills, stuggling still
How'd we get so stuck in the first place?

Livin to a fast degree working on my masterpiece
Nobody's got the answer you just gotta adapt
And that's how it has to be. X2

This Lil baby got the world in his hands
2nd house on the left up on Stevenson
Crack head's crackin a Guinness again
He said he's been comin by, lil baby just keeps quiet wonders why?
Mama's stressed out about bills, still struggling
Telephone ringing it's the president of a company
Pardon me mam but i'd like to offer your son a deal
A microphone with a better life for your son to build
Seems nice but ima have to decline she said
'Workin through everything is building him just fine."
Even though he never played with the other kids
He never knew why, but he's sure that his mother did
Side walk drawin with chalk, when he looked up
Saw two kids bout as high as some sky scrapers
One's got a beard, white cylinder in his ear
Asked lil baby, you know where to buy papers?
First 5 yrs, flow into 5 later
Trouble in elementary school acting like a fool
Never paid attention I ended up in a group
With some other students who wrote music to find patience
Found artist he could relate too
People who been through the same shit
Most of them felt the pain too
Its true when they tell ya music could change you
Started scribblin was addicted after page two
Discovered it wasn't to hard to find a melody
Then soon after art became a remedy
Especially dealing with losing his friend
Mack been his background on his computer ever since
His other homie doing 3
Locked down in Wyoming Correctional Facility
But once he out give it a week
And we gon have them matching Benz's
Suddenly this will become a memory because I've been

Livin to a fast degree, working on a master piece
Nobody's got the answer you just gotta adapt
And that's how it ha's to be

One day, one song I make gon change this world
And I can already see it coming
Nothing could change the way i think
I still got more to say, so you can keep it running
This vibe that I send, I can't control
I just follow my own intuition
But now that we ain't kids
We gotta make sure we know how to face
Reality when it kicks in
Although it's happening slow, nobody knows the way it'll go
But that's the magic about you an me
I could be rappin a show
Slappin up hands, giving autographs and then..
Tomorrow you could read my eulogy
So rest in peace , Maurice with the way of the world
But for now ima be schooling ya'll like i'm Junie B
And if you see me on the streets i'll be doin me
Shining bright for you to see what you could truly be

Living to a fast degree working on my masterpiece
Nobody's got the answer you just gotta adapt
And that's how it ha's to be, c'mon
