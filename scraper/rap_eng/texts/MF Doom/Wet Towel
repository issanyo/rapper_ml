Whats the point of being in love when they dont love you back
Both of my new songs have gotten a rack
Driving around with the wide frame steer
And we both know what you fucking did last year
I dont know who this was directed at
I guess i took a little too much of that yak
School, work, friends all want to pressure me
Life isnt so chocolatey like a fucking ovaltine
These fuckers wanna say that my rap is a novelty
Now i wanna throw hands like im alec ogletree
Faggots who call me a mumble rapper better be lying
Im mufasa bitch, im a fucking lion
Me vs rap is like david and goliath
I really like you and now my problems multiplying
Girl youre so divine and
I wanna hit like babe ruth
But we can't
Ain't that the fucking truth
If youre listening, please know im sincere
But this song was a bet and i may not sound too clear
My nasal cavities may not be too clear
Ofo pass was lyrically trash
And i know sometimes i act a lkttle bjt rash
I just wanna feel something like when i dine and dash
Im a goofy boy imma make you mash and im a decent guy we dont have to smash
Basically what im saying is i wanna be your guy
And i dont wanna go to sleep tomorrow saying no gf gn
