[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
It's that number 9 shit
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Mind sharp 'nuff to split ya wide
In the ride before five, hurry get inside
See the prize, it's too bad, I got rid of my token
No more playing games, 'cause they end up being frozen
I did the devil dance, I see much better now
I had like hella chances, wearing a metal mask
This Doomzilla, I see the cream like chocolate, vanilla

[Chorus]
Grade A killer, call me Mr. Fantastic
Go for home stretch ever since I started rapping
(This Doomzilla, I see the cream like)

[Verse 2]
Fuck with all the hate though, you should note take, though
Pretty math teacher, yeah, she give me brain, though
Aries just a young, dumb son-of-a-gun so watch out
Pull the trigger, no turning tides, the time's now
This is something that's been hidden for a decade
Snag your bars so it makes it easier to checkmate
Steady livin' life, while I'm about that pride
You can see it in my eyes, I'ma one of a kind
Til' my sights are blind and I'm living a lie
If you claim you're the boss then what the fuck am I?
Shit, levels above, flock til' the pelicans come
I want that gold in my hands, should be a hell of a run
I took the mic to bless it nine million times
They don't want that, spray rhymes at you and your comrade
Gang of buccaneers, we ain't all bad
I tell 'em go forth, we ain't never fall back

[Outro]
(killa, killa) Mr. Fantastic
Go for home stretch ever since I started rapping
Mr. Fantastic, this Doomzilla
It's Doomzilla, microphone killa
It's Doomzilla, microphone killa
