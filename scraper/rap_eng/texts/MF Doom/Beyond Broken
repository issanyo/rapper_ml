[Verse 1]
This is a love song that I couldn't finish
I gave you the world and you acted like a menace
Why did you act up all the way from start to finish
I'm thinking is it real cuz all your close friends did
You was my princess I put the glass shoe on your foot
Did whatever it took that made you look like..
Cinderella you a devil in disguise
I traded up the world cuz you're an angel in my eyes
I went out of my way every day
Just to see dat smile covered in glaze now let's pray..
I'll never love a chick, never trust a chick
Bitches really ain't shit cuz they do the same shit
They treat the bad guys good
Good guys bad
Then they act phony lookin lonely and sad like..
You hurt me to let another nigga hurt you?
Isn't it ironic karma comes and hurts you too?

Karma comes and hurts you too, you too
I'm tryna find a clue like blues clues
Who's who? who you?
Love's knockin at ya door like there's a connection between you like voodoo
I ain't takin a chance I can't do it but
She could give me brain cuz we both college students
It's confusing cuz I ain't the type to love
But if you show me you worth it then I might just hit chu up
You got the face of a goddess all honesty
Body of a model and I might just pop a bottle
Celebrate and toast get all close what chu provoke
Might happen if you let me do the things I love most..
Caress your body and my body's your party
You're my future Ciara girl
I might just go parlay get a little naughty
Let me see dat Vicky secret shawty
In the kitchen in the bathroom I hit it on the potty
Neighbors know my name
But it's confidential how I beat the pussy up
And I hit it on your menstrual
You tryna keep the seed to keep me around
But we all know that's not how it's gonna go down cuz..
I'm 17 I ain't tryna have a kid
I wanna be successful and I got my life to live
These bitches crazy always tryna have a baby
Put chu on child support cuz you got another lady
