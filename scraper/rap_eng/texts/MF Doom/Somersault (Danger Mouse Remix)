[Chorus]
You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around [Somersault]
You were sweet and you were sound
You saved me

[Verse 1]
She wondered would it hurt again, a scary new setting
A Mary Lou Retton perfect 10 -- was it worth it then?
Would have made the clique switch way back
For a quick pitch in the haystack
With a bad bitch like Payback with interest
Used to keep her nice coo trimless
Flipped it for a high school gymnast
She was thicker than the kick off "Supersonic"
Sicker than the bubonic, to Vik it was platonic
Wow, found a new playmate
At this late stage in the game he couldn't get the name straight
Told her "it was all up in your calf muscle"
Showed her how to pull it off, all laugh and tussle
At one point she thought he was a lame cat, with game for the rats
A dog to claim the blame at
Told her "Maybe it's your momma fault, for giving you the shaker"
Summi-summi-somersault

[Chorus]
You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around [Somersault]
You were sweet and you were sound
You saved me

[Verse 2]
Butterflies at the very mention
The flutter of her eyelashes help to clear the tension
Then went and tripped and fell head over heels
V, and got dirtier than Red Rover's wheels
No matter how high-stake the price
This good-luck charm on his arm shake the dice
It's gymnastics, practice makes nice
She's not the type to be enticed by fake ice
Aah -- the stench of first love
The quench of the thirst made it worse
Truly the burst of upper-thrust motion
Trust, devotion
Lust is like the sand where the beach meets the ocean
Soaking, felt joy in the whirlwind
Never ever did he ever mention boyfriend/girlfriend
Demanded her respect
Then ran and did a handspring, almost landed on her neck

[Chorus]
You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around [Somersault]
You were sweet and you were sound
You saved me
