Hey what's up?
My name is
I'm 12 years old
This is my crib
260 [?] Ave apartment 7B
I live here with my grandmother Effy
She's sleeping in the big bedroom
My uncles Marvin and Laury
They share this small bedroom
And my mom Yvonne
We sleep on the [?] couch in the living room
Around I've been using the DJ D and D Ski
But I've been getting more into rhyming lately
I think I'm starting using the name Ace
Yeah, I like how that sounds
My mom gots a nice record collection too
I've been checking them out when she ain't at home
She gots some nice grooves, I can practice my rap to
You wanna check out our collection?
Alright, but you gotta be real quiet
Come on, shhh
