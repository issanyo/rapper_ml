[Hook]
Answer to the riddle
More hidden than a crook
The only way they find him
If he’s spittin' in a hook

[Verse]
Look, they love to know the story, more grody than Mr. Crowley
For those embarrassed to know holier than thou of holy habits
Paris to the Gobi bring him up to speed slowly
On the low key, Kindles is phony D
Taste stale, see the world in shades of gray-scale
Right there in black and white, protected by chain-mail
Today’s the day, made his way to see his sister'n'um
Took my little mens with her, told em loved em.. kisseded them
These over-sensitive youngins' is on some new stuff
Can't sit still-- focus the time it takes to do enough
From off the mean streets of the ‘Can I get a dollar dude?’
Above measure the singular pleasure of solitude
It’s your poison, if you so choose, absorb it
Feel it in your veins to the brain shoot off into orbit
How you know octagon? Or much less Tetragrammaton,
To get the good stuff you need to get out to the Amazon
With any luck we might just score locally
Shh, keep it on the hush when you speakin' on it vocally
Then you gotta be on the in, a known member
I think I still owe 'em lil something since November, whatever
Who need credit when cash speak, get it
Sweatin' sittin on this package from last week
We all got our weaknesses, along with the functionin' dead
Some'll end up fudgin' numbers, buggin' and lunchin' instead
It’s Netflix to the head, second best trick to get the chicks to the bed
