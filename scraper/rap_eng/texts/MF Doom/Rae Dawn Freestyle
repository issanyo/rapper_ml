Check it, wreck it, don't forget to rep it
IDK on the chest were spreading like infection
Guessing second, you get the sloppy ruins
I have them disconnecting, dropping through em, mocking fluids
Stop i knew it like a déjà vu
I stay by you, soaking all these H I's too
Unless they're V clap, then we say Bye Boo
No lie Dude, until the skies blue
We creep the night but we ain't liable
Undefinable, but our talents undeniable
Undefiable, and my shoulders are unreliable
Bust inside of you, son of a bitch, and a bastard
Cuz after blasting matter ima scatter swiftly after
Eat a platter of pills, unmatchable skills
Try my steez on for a feel of real ill
And still, you couldn't match this
Perfect like practice, the fact is, Jaz tryna master this
I'm masterous, stay cool when i pass a spliff
I'm the cat to kick, cuz when i'm down i'ma get up pissed
And full rage, take out foes my own age
Blow their bone cage and show their own veins
Then sew them closed dazed, to my own song
Hoes my own age still get the flows wrong
I'm so gone, i don't think that i'ma come back
Smoke until my Lungs snap, cosign ya dunce cap
Jazdoobie stay lit
Never gonna trip when I fall for a hit
