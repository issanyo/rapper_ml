This ain't a love song, this is shit gone wrong
And I'll admit it, I wasn't even the nigga to hit it
But I wanted to, wanted to show you what I was gonna do
Too bad shit ended, hit me so fast felt like I got rear ended
Yea I'll admit it, I made the mistake then
But the keys to my heart, you ain't have to take them
Old white flame, not really, she was lightskin
And I was trifling, I ain't even gonna front
And act like I don't miss her cuz I do
I remember all the time I spent talking to you
Didn't hang out that much, but I wasn't like that yet
Is it too late to ask if I can bite that yet?
And yea, shit changed after we stopped talking
Again, that was my fault, I stopped frauding
And realized exactly what I lost, never knew
What love cost until you did that shit to me
Might not have been dating literally
But when you called and told me you lost it, I lost it
Couldn't do the friendship anymore, but couldn't accost it
So I left it alone and continued with the homegrown
Shit probably warped my mind and I wasn't fine
With the idea of not having you to myself
Shit wasn't good for my health, at least back then
If it was present day it wouldn't have happened that way
But I won't fraud, yea girl I still love you
Even after everything we been through
And lately since we got back in touch you done
Changed on me, gotta tell you, I don't like the change homie
I miss the old you, not this new bravado filled bold you
Heh, see how I flipped that? Old White Flame, only a real nigga
Coulda did that, and yea I did get jealous see in' you with new dudes
But I wasn't tryna be prude and comment cuz it wasn't my place
Compared to these niggas I was outta space, I let my anger get the
Best of me didn't care, cuz I blocked you out from the rest of me
I just seen your new twitter pop up on my TL as I'm writing this
Not gonna follow you though, just stay in my writing bliss
Hope one day a blogger asks me about this song so I can
Mention your name and you stop actin' like I'm just some random nigga
Go figure, I don't like the feeling, not one of them niggas out here
Dealing, I'm getting my life straight, workin' out tryna get to a nice weight
Could use a nice plate of drugs with a jar of em right next to it
So many new up and comers I'm tryna be the next to do it
So girl while i'm sitting here writing this song
I hope one day I'll get to right my wrongs
And I'm probably labeling myself as too much
Of a screw up, but that's an affect of love
Old white Flame
