[Intro: J Reall]
Hey Era what up?
I was always told man
What don't kill you only makes you stronger

[Verse 1: J Reall]
It ain't no secret
Through the struggle, only strong survive
Well I overdosed, put in overtime
It's survival of the fittest
No kidding, only put in positions where failure's a [?] vision
I get it, but still I still stuck by me
Been up, been down, some 'cided to up and leave
I know, went pain-huntin' in them hard times [?]
You see who really loyal to you and for [?] type shit
It's like I had it restless during my adolescence
Not havin' my pops, mad depressing
Head call and collecting
Having the coroners come and collect him
My big bro still a cold case, no arrest I'm
I'm supposed to know who stole the show before they left it
Of course I know because I had flow before progressive
Learned the ropes in time to show the folks what my progress is
Turn it up a notch, you could feel the heat up in my sessions

[Hook: J Reall]
I ain't got a lot of mofos in my circle
Too many fake friends, lord that could hurt you
That fake shit is universal
So if I don't play you close, please don't take it personal
Don't take it personal, don't take it personal
Don't take it personal, just don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
So if I don't play you close, don't take it personal

[Verse 2: Knew Era]
Find time through the days that could cover a short stack
[?] I can do makin' more than minimum wage
I could ask for a hand, but that'd lead to smacks in the face
Cause niggas'll leave you hangin' and loyalty is a phase
Growin' up fast, outrunnin' slow bucks
[?] off work [?] ain't the same as luck
Standing my grounds tall, hold the mic with a vicegrip
Pressin' all my enemies and foldin' all these life tips
Now what shall stop me? Nothin', rollin' over
My passion burns deeper than art on this man's sculpture
We all want this dream in our heart, it brings closure
But some give up before they even start to get focused
You see 'em comin' up until they turn around
Got the city on my back, boy a knife would pull us all down
I represent way more than what I'm around
Broaden my horizon, open-minded to another round
I damn sure work this hard to sit on the shelf
Got my own team, we don't really need your label help
Put in overtime in no time, the first place
Grind started from my mind, risen from this birthplace

[Hook]
