[Verse 1: Abraham Uchiha]
Ain't no locks on me but I'm still a rasta
Leave your bitch loose like some pasta
I'm a monster
Fuck with me, look what it's gon' cost ya
Bitch, boutta go super saiyan
Ain't no playin'
Start the prayin', stop the sprayin'
Cause what you gon' do with the heater when I come at you?
Lookin like Vegeta, nigga you gon' need a whole army
And some on me
Nah, hardly gon' harm me cause I'm godly
Rippin' out your arteries, like you took a part of me
Chances you gon' live is like the lottery
So when I'm meditating please don't bother me
Or imma start the slaughtery
Ha, I'm just joking, here's some guidance
Breathe in silence, leave the violence nigga
Cause any pussy can pull the trigger
It takes a real dude to become something bigger
My words connected together like God made
Birds with the bones and the feathers
And the beat's ill shit
When I speak, not even at my peak
And I don't really give a fuck if your eyebrow's on fleek yo
Your inner soul game weak hoe
Searching for a goddess that bounces light within my darkness
But for now imma spark this
Ha, one thing about them tables' that they always turn
So wait your turn and you gon' learn
While this dank procceeds to burn
Have you heard of this? I'm murderous

[Verse 2: Oblivion]
Spitting golden flows, paranoia got me on my toes
As I try to decipher these motherfucking third eye codes
Devastation on my head
Granted I could be six feet underneath, death
On my last breath, trying to inhale all this dread
While others out there trying to butter up the bread
But that's enough said, plenty of blood shed
Understand what's read, society is dead
But that's a messed up game, full of torture and pain
Most people's goal is trying to remain sane
But these people acting different, ended up all the same
Day after day but I still remain
Slave after slave, now we all in a grave
Now we've all misbehaved
And now we've all felt shamed
We're all concave, but don't cave in a shell
Repetition competition, this the definition of sedition
Now we all listen
Now we all wishin' there was food in the kitchen
