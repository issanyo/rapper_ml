[Intro: Sample]
"Step aside, boy, I'mma check in that cash register."

[Verse: MF DOOM + Samples]
In lak'ech, planetary kin ("Step aside, boy...")
Red overtone dragon make your barathary spin (V-Villain!)
In the flesh with a band of merry men
Innocent civilians hari kari over yen ("Uh!")
Is it the end or for pretend?
I can neither condemn, nor defend
Cats that's more pussy than a sanitary napkin bin
Villain ran a scam on his imaginary rappin' friend ("Uh!")
Again; shame on us
We in the same game, put the blame on Gus
Study till your brain vomit
Just don't be out getting money when it rain comets
Armpits of funk, a bomb in the hunk-a-junk trunk
Metal palm on your ma's ba-dunk-a-dunk
In a park in a rave under three days of darkness
Tell a hater, "Behave and spark this"
With the fresh banana berry blend ("Step aside, boy...")
Countin' mad tens than when January begin
The other hand clutched to a pen
24/7—much to his chagrin
Used to drink gin, now, he only drink oxygen water
Mixed with shark fins that cleanse the toxins, sorta
And if they ever come get me
We were sippin' rum on a number one jitney (Ya wit' me?)
I can neither confirm nor deny
On account of the sherm—all high
Villain make 'em squirm till her perm all dry
Sperm to her eye, to a worm to a fly
It's germs and mad babies to kiss
Won't stop rockin', 'cept to maybe take a piss
Or soak his feet in a mineral oil vat ("Step aside...")
Holdin' a Rodin coil in his tin foil hat
Step aside, give him some room, player ("Step aside, boy...")
Till the end of days he'll be the ill doomsayer

[Outro: Samples]
"Step aside, boy, I'mma check in that cash register."
"Uh!"
