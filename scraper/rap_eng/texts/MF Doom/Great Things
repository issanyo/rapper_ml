[Intro: Bishop Nehru]
Emperor Nehru
I'm here with
(What up, kid?)
DOOM the Villain
Peace, Nehruvians

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
I'ma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'mma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'ma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'ma do great things, great things
Great things, great things, great things
1, 7, 9 6, yeah

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Got smooth beats and verses
Rappers mad cause I show them hearses
It's not my purpose they just worthless
It ain't worth this time, rehearse them lines
Me, I never had to practiceâ€“I just wrote and shined
A walking diamond yet they treat me like feldspar (what?)
I'm not as common as you think, you better dwell hard
On the past, the present and the future too
Were you part of the few who knew Nehru before he blew?
No challenger, my mission can't fail
Cause I'm lookin' at my vision and this shit is gettin' real
I'm hoping to get some meals, no hobo
I'm hoping I don't grow old before I show the whole globe
What I know and what I see
Plus who I plan to be, that's a man of peace
Got Gandhi in his genes so you gotta get the theme
Others parking while I speed, am I targeted to lead?
Peace

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
I'ma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'mma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'ma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'ma do great things, great things
Great things, great things, great things
1, 7, 9 6, yeah

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Just put your mind to it, you'll go mad far
Like the plasma in reactors when you're headed to the stars
Let it be tomorrow, it starts on the inside
Use intuition and conscience as a guide, glide
Choose a target, however immaculate
Focus till it manifest pin-point accurate
That's a sure bet, and Villain's no gambler
Freeze frame a thought like it's caught on camera
Advice is free of charge, just pay attention
A donation as they say in this dimension
A game-winning strategy: support your favorite charity
Playing with polarity could drain a whole battery
Beware of apathy and procrastination
And put the plan in full effect for instant activation
Just a few jewels that's hidden in plain sight
Ain't nothing else to it but to do it, but do it right
Aight?

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
I'ma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'mma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'ma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'ma do great things, great things
Great things, great things, great things
1, 7, 9 6, yeah

[Verse 3: Bishop Nehru]
I'm seeing great things in my vision, started with an intention
And then moved farther when I parted with my soul extensions
Erased all the tension that my mind was inventin'
And used it for useful venting, Nehru you do it different
I'm missing mental misery that's usually in-built in me
And building the empire higher, acquire light
And he's growing to be enlightened, a frightening sight
Like Michael Myers when he strikes with the knife
Better grab your reds it's about to get epic
So shoot it in high res while they aligning with the message
Nehruvians wild blessing, we straight from the gods in the heavens
Perfection, we live walking talking seven
Been striving for these goals since eleven, now they hear me
Get ready and prepared for what may appear eerie
Directing my own theories, they finally see 'em clearly
I'ma make change severely cause I can't force dearly, sincerely

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
I'ma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'mma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'ma do great things, great things
No, y'all can't stop my dream and my vision
I'ma do great things, great things
Great things, great things, great things
1, 7, 9 6, yeah
