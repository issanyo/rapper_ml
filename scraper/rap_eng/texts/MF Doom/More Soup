[Intro]

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
No cream, no sugar, Moka Only
Choke the microphone the way he loc and choke a phony, won’t he
Told 'em play ya station like a broken Sony
Tenderoni phone she'll know me come and stroke the pony
That good lovin’ deserves an encore and a Tony
Brats in the hood muggin, they want more raw bologna
Chachi needs to watch his bony skinny Joney
Villain finna fattin her up with Minestrone
Been grown, Chromoly skin tone
While he rock the end zone, tap your toe or chin bone
The choice is yours alone
Came for the throne, and to get the game sewn
Doom name known as the don for sure, troop
And he won’t show his face or sponsor your group
He sneak up and throw you for a loop
She peeped up, speak up if you want some more soup

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Moka Only]
New sues again, who do’s crews again
Who’s too smooth, whose flues want snooze with them
No surprise, no new-news to him
Here’s a light bulb now how many of you screw this in
I do better when there’s less team effort
Went from old blue sweater, I’m a less clean dresser
Full circle, back to the grind war
Mic by the mirror, I’m the best I ever saw record
Mok and Doom get it sewn like an open wound
Two scientists up in the lab will make it go Kaboom!
And said don’t mix those two properties together
Prob’ly end up with some empty eye sockets or whatever
I’m only here to hunt pleasure like some treasure
Never from a wack pack of bitches like the Heathers
After this you better hone for some loot
You freaks with the funk’ll make me want some more soup

[Hook]
