Just take look at your ripped jeans, you're killing me
Take a look at your converse, you're killing me
Please get a shirt that fits you, you're killing me
Blow it up tonight and fight and fight and fight
(x2)

I wasn't drunk, you're just a jerk
And I can still see your smug smirk
Even though you didn't know I lied
And you didn't see me quit my job or "fly off the handle"

I still got your keys I'ma crawl in
I don't have your keyboard, I sold it
I didn't even wait to hear back
To pack, back to PVD, I haul ass

Take a look at your haircut, you're killing me
Take a look at your glasses, you're killing me
Placement of the piercings, you're killing me
Blow it up tonight and fight and fight and fight

You talk all about life on life's terms
All I can think about is "this girl needs life alert"
You got off hall restrict
You couldn't get your cords
Spend all night saying you don't wanna lose your dog

And I get it, I made friends with the losers
The yoga-doers and computers
Taking vacay at McClayclay
They've been here too many times
All the nurses assists getting pissed

And the sad thing's that
It shouldn'ta happened at all
I get home and I stare straight at the fucking wall
I write poems and try to rap to spend the time
Getting money from my family and my pity, I'm fine

In the hall sittin' pretty playing scrabble
Board games bored life
Apples to Apples
Everyone somehow makes it work
And you're stressing about your silly little band's merch

I'm a moron with mom's laptop, say it's poetry
And I could draw the pattern on the ceiling from my memory
Maybe someone else'll write these fuckin songs for me
I'm bomb and I'm not even in the industry

Take a look at your ripped jeans, you're killing me
Take a look at your converse, you're killing me
Please get a shirt that fits you, you're killing me
Meet the quota or fight and fight and fight

This time I'll try not to lie
About the shitty things that other people did
I'm exiting the tiny shell you trapped me in
Here i go retreating to my castle in the sky
Write rhymes and cry and hide
'til i'm verified

Just take look at your ripped jeans your killing me
Take a look at your converse, you're killing me
Get a shirt that fits you, you're killing me
Blow it up tonight and fight and fight and fight
