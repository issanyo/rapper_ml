I am Red
Who are you?
What is this?
Ace, one taste grace space, lace the pace then out straight without a trace
High tie-dye clad guys with the pseudo psi, few know the true glow shoot through the eye
Aye Aye, Red Rover roger, I di-
Gress, through the chest, God why
Assess human complex for the answers
Instead of asking Comet, Vixen and Prancer
If it wasn’t for the long arm
Anyone with ears from here to Hong Kong harmed
But truthfully - take it how he means it
Unseen so before you think do not demean it
The fun one coming undone spun off trying to outrun
Drovers whose motives are overdone
Son, to rule planets
They’ll have my hand on banners before they ban it like

(I don’t know I just feel as though, sometimes they can’t hear me, well I mean maybe they hear me but do they listen?)

Is something missing?
Never assisted amidst subsisting
Everyone out for they own
Even at home, so nose stay close to tomes never closed
Ever so close
One day I’m out like Shalom, so I’m trying to build Rome, and Michelangelo’s dome
To some I’m just trying to write
I mean I do write, truly trying to do right
Leave you appalled with shit that keeps me up all night
I’ll fall right with the rest of ‘em
Till then, Red will be the best of ‘em
But it’s hit and miss
Poo poo stew
Alive then dead
What is this?
Who are you?
I am Red
