[Intro]
[Sample]
As soon as you get to earth, deliver any information found in the spacecraft to the commander's office::
[Cool Calm Pete]
Set your microphones to stun
Nanu nanu, check one two...

[Verse 1]
[Jaymanila]
Yo, rushin' through the stars like a comrade Cosmonaut
Got planets roped on lassos, in U.S. they called me Astro
Rokay Rorge, shipped forged from Cogwell Cogs
Which one of you let the toilets filled with the Captain's log?

[Cool Calm Pete]
Bad voodoo, beware the black monolith
In deep space, no one can smell shit
Dark side of the moon, hummin' at MF Doom
??? and vodka makes energon cubes

[Jaymanila]
Yo, fuck bounty, we hungry, I'm moody
Kidnap Rosie for her duty
And keep Judy for her cartoonish booty

[Cool Calm Pete]
For rhyme's sake, Bonzai Buckaroo
Ahoy nerd, crabs grab Zoidberg
To the Buck Rog mechanized bird
I'm takin' a rocket trip to say "word!"

[Jaymanila]
We're on our way to earth
The sandwich meat's nice and lean
All they got in space is freeze-dried ice cream

[Cool Calm Pete]
Launching space monkeys, NASA's tryin' to play us
Keep sendin' 'em up here, we'll send back Dr. Zaius

[Jaymanila]
Damn you's, damn you's, damn you's all to hell!
Hyperspace booze cruise, planetary Dave Atell
Drunk off No-Doz and Tang hip hop's Krodos and Kang
Bad swerve through worm hole came to co-do our thang

[Bridge]
Reception airlock open

[Verse 2]
[Jaymanila]
Just got back from the final frontier
Space Shuttle ??? drinkin' light beer back in light year

[Cool Calm Pete]
Earth's shitty, Xanadu ditty
Rollin' with homegirl, groped the three titty
Yo my bad, thought you were smugglin' moon rocks
A man named Bundy got fuel in his socks

[Jaymanila]
Your brain hurts in a post-Klatuu earth
I say take me to your reefer, then take me to your leader
Yo, they dug it and then asked me if I knew Sputnik
I said kick it up to warp speed or you're gonna get your butt kicked

[Cool Calm Pete]
Don't make me off-the-dome like Highlander
Ain't no danger, Will Robinson, where's the commander?

[Jaymanila]
They got nervous and started lookin' for an escape hatch

[Cool Calm Pete]
You think all we aliens do is body snatch?

[Jaymanila]
We're not Unicron tryin' to transform the planet, people

[Cool Calm Pete]
"We Are the World" was writ by Captain EO

[Jaymanila]
He took us to a Dago bar that was slim filled like Dagobah
I said under my breath, in jest, "Yo where's yoda?"
They hit us for some yogurt and some bubbly carbonated soda
Ironically, played Space Invaders in the corner
Pete, don't cry over spilled milk, we'll get drunk later
And talk to that rotten Killer Tomato in that junk-freighter

[Cool Calm Pete]
Miss, let me get the cat like ALF, a mouthful
Earth Girls are Easy but tonight's it quite doubtful
Come on, ain't no felines fit in a thong
Bi-week grind, Ba-weep-gra-na-weep-ninny-bong
She looked back at me in an uninvolved dumb way

[Jaymanila]
I said, Miss, you don't know my friend, Gordon Shumway?
He's from Melmac, try to attack your potbelly, yo
I said, Chill that's Kuato, open your mind, burrito and taco
She said, Pete, HAL-2000, these humans' gonna get you
I said, Pee on my face, and my Schwartz be with you...

May the Scwartz ... be with you

[Cool Calm Pete]
Kicking that moon-dirt inkling like Gattaca
You're on the Soul Train Battlestar Galactica
Don Pardo, tell 'em what they've won
A date with John Lithgow and a brand new ray gun!

[Jaymanila]
Believe it or not they threatened us with puss Ripley Clones
I always say "I come in peace" right after the CD's through
Out the Divider jumped Rowdy Rowdy Piper
Shouting out "They Live," didn't expect the Galactic sniper
Yo Doom, let 'em rip!
Buck 'em down! Space Tech Banana Clip

[Cool Calm Pete]
Hit 'em with a displaced case full of space cakes
Watch as space case face hallucinate
Close Encounter take a Tribble as a decoy
Surface pool, Astro b-boy
Forbidden Planet, nasty like Janet

[Jaymanila]
I'm intergalatic planetary, goddammit!

[Cool Calm Pete]
Yo engage, he's headed for the ship!

[Cool Calm Pete and Jaymanila]
Buck 'em down! Space Tech Banana Clip

[Jaymanila]
Without haste, yo, P laid him to waste
And we didn't get in trouble
Cause there ain't no pigs in space, Zoinks!

[Sample]
Army bombers ready ... enemy
Get ready for a surprise!

[Cool Calm Pete and Jaymanila]
We punked Elliot for his BMX

[Jaymanila]
And hit E.T. on his two-way and told him he was next

[Cool Calm Pete]
Nah, that's a Speak-N-Spell hooked to a Technic

[Cool Calm Pete]
That's why I'm High Commander and you're the tech-geek
Keep it movin' like Starlight Express
Good God, he's headed for the escape pod

[Jaymanila]
"They're gettin' away to Babylon Five!"

[Cool Calm Pete]
Nah stupid, I said "Babbletron Live"

[Jaymanila]
He was out, bang-zoom, straight to the moon
I got a cheese sandwich and got young like Cocoon

[Cool Calm Pete]
Lost in Space, searching for inner peace
Lost in Innerspace, just to say the least

[Cool Calm Pete and Jaymanila]
Roamin' galaxy, far, far in the East Coast
Peace out, Brak, and we're Space Ghost!
