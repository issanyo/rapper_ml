[Intro: Dat Pretty Boi Bitch Killa Nigga]
Uh, don't call me OMWP call me uh, call me, uh
I got bitches, yeah
We all have huge schlongs, uh, swear

[Lemson]
Walked in this bitch and came on the carpet
Drawing tattoos all over my body in Sharpie
Snorted angel dust off Jams' mom's asshole, 'twas enchanting
Looked in the corner and saw Jams slowly fapping
Wut

[Verse Nosmel: Cockring]
Nosmel your fur suit is cheap
I spend more money on sandwich meat
Rap to me you gonna get beat
Leave you like the carpet under my feet

[Verse 1: BBDS aka RTJ3]
You think you're all that cause you got some thumbs up
Why don't you pipe down, quit making threads and shut up
Damn son you are so fucking thirsty
You probably think Ab-Soul is good, ah, it hurts me
You know that editorship has no correlation to IQ
But you wouldn't know that, you aren't too bright, are you
You started off with Dolan, god such a played out gimmick
I see you, standing there, soaking in limerence
And now you're stanning one of RG's WOAT forumers?
You're irrelevant enough to be sent to the RG coroner
When I hope of this track, vocal destruction leave you surprised
I got Diez eyes, that's 1 plus 3 times Tien's eyes
Now I need a filler bar, 3 away for sixteen
Lyrical line of the year that you never foreseen
I forever rock the bells like LL
You steady taking L's like you're Nosmel

[Interlude - Teddy Westside]
Guitar Solo

[Verse 2:James301]
I played Uno with Lemson once
He was rlly smelly
Who's nosmel
Must be irelly

[Verse 3: RapPolymath]
Snitches need a .44 in that dome, paratroopers in their home
Paid niggas to flick that on switch off, knock these lights out
Have that nigga eating baby food in the wheelchair with the severe gout
I'm talking 'bout you nosmel, riding on lemsons relishness
Best guess is you probably rock dresses while playing chess
Better drink yourself into a stupor, new liver
Put niggas on blast, that shit ain't cool
Put your head underwater and try drinking the whole pool
If you get into editor chat, you'll get clapped in the dome
Press that chrome into your temple, have you crying for entrance into the next level
