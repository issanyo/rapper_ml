[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Eatin' Captain Crunch for lunch, don't get your panties in a bunch
Shorty passed out, he coulda put the whammy in the punch
Had he a hunch, he could get set up like one Cosby
Slidin' off of three snowflakes like Tom Bosley
Remember Charlie's Angels? They had to make some changes
Three broads with burners, these dames could gets dangerous
Dude you never see will forever remain nameless
Two of them things black, the last one's stainless
Don't deal with the devil on a deep level
They see metal and sound off like a tea kettle
Blow the spot up lovely
With no reference to skin color, God don't like ugly
Wise man once said not to showboat
And treat the yacht the same way as a rowboat
The snakes'll hang theyself with they own rope
And watch a jewel transform to a known quote

[Chorus]
All I'm tryna do is just make mine
Why a sideline rider tryna take mine?
Cause I shine like the sun, broad day time
Puttin' facts to the claps and the bassline (you know!)
All I'm tryna do is just make mine
Why a sideline rider tryna take mine?
Cause I shine like the sun, broad day time
Puttin' facts to the claps and the bassline (you know!)

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
What's Mary Poppin' y'all? Shout to Michael Rooker
You with a mic is like a eunuch with a hooker
Pressure (pressure pressure) cooker
My confusion's organized, I'm the lord of light
Yandu with an arrow's like Eso with the cordless mic
Flow holy, no gospel trap, writin' like
Michael Crichton put the rap in Velocirap-tor, or
I hit you like a trap-door, when it rains it pours
No mental strains but I, stick out like Kurt Angle's temple veins
You got an empty brain, enter in my lane
It takes balls like a gender change, people talkin' out they ass
Check for the double-cross like 2 Chainz at Sunday mass
Hit you with the belly to belly, the suplex
Off the roof of the duplex, willin' to group text
With Steely Dan, Groot, fuckin' baby Groot, the ghost of Dave Brubeck
Alex Trebek and Boba Fett, who's next?

[Chorus]
All I'm tryna do is just make mine
Why a sideline rider tryna take mine?
Cause I shine like the sun, broad day time
Puttin' facts to the claps and the bassline (you know!)
All I'm tryna do is just make mine
Why a sideline rider tryna take mine?
Cause I shine like the sun, broad day time
Puttin' facts to the claps and the bassline (you know!)

[Outro]
Is that a good guy or a bad guy?
Uhh, good guy
Well it looks like a bad guy
Well, he's a good guy
