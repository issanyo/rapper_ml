[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Straight from out the wilds of turtle island
Where the fellas be buildin', and the girlies be smilin'
Hell of a thing when these worlds be collidin'
They all sing jingle bells complete with violent pedophilin'
Rush hour traffic and human cargo
To nowhere in a hurry, during a truth embargo
It seemed so odd though, how they so cocky
With blatant disregard for life like Hiroshima / Nagasaki
Watch it when we—

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb
There's tears in our eyes
And we got nowhere to hide

Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb
There's tears in our eyes

And we got nowhere to hide
Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb

Tears in our eyes
Nowhere to hide
Tears in our eyes
Nowhere to...

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Drop jewels like they drop toxic napalm
Or even one of their most prized possessions the H-bomb
Guaranteed to kill for generations to come
And degenerate their own civilizations to bunch of bums
And it's the same ones who started this calamity
Turned right around and asked for amnesty, insanity
DOOM representing Ronin squad Kes Kes Kes
Bombing since "Yes, yes, y'all" and the "FreshFest"

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb
There's tears in our eyes
And we got nowhere to hide

Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb
There's tears in our eyes
And we got nowhere to hide

Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb

Tears in our eyes
Nowhere to hide
Tears in our eyes
Nowhere to...

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
The abomination of colonization
Material greed
Sick domination
Straight pawn of Satan
Hatin'—what is at the core of your defiance?
You focus on destruction
You focus on science, like the Mayans
Biker
It's time to pay the piper
So foul and rebellious
The sun don't even like ya, homie
Should've took the time to get to know me
Now I can't do nothing but watch you burn slowly
Fry

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb
There's tears in our eyes
And we got nowhere to hide

Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb
There's tears in our eyes
And we got nowhere to hide

Drop the bomb
Drop the bomb

Tears in our eyes
Nowhere to hide
Tears in our eyes
Nowhere to...
