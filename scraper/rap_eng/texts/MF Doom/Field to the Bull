(Work, Work, Work, Work, Work)

Let's get right in
Eyes low, dropping soul like the Gospel
Been there for a minute, eating breaks but I'm not full
No, No, I'm on that other
I spend some of these days feeling strange and my brothers And feelin' little ill, trying to cope with the bandit
I just wanna move but my license is suspended
So what am I to do, You expecting me to peddle
Instead of in my room trying to get this brain settled
Been filling up them pages 'til the point I wanna flip
But I kick shit, like kick flips, you can't touch my tricks
Sorry for the facts, I just wanna keep that clear
Got love for the homies, say they bump me when they steer
And I never wanna anger, that shit simply came
Cuz people talking shit, because they I want their, fame
But I just want to kick it, y'all don't see me as a threat
I'm happy when I'm spitting, and I only want respect
And that is all I ask, put some rays in the volume
Take off your mask, we all seeing through your costume
I'm gonna serve rap, 'til my vocal chords break
Still staying in my lane, see you riding in my wake
Mama promised, I'm gonna wreak havoc
On track, speak madness
The facts, homies think they nice
But the speech average, at best
I dangle lines and I strangle lines
Never wanna waste my time
Bringing out this drama with this book of rhymes
So when you talk shit and end up in a gutter
I'll be chillin' on a boat and livin' right, cuz it's summer
Feeling hazy, still got time to twist with you benders
Cuz I'm been killing shit since the 2nd of September
And 9, 5, 9, 5, comin' up like high tide
Ain't seeing much tonight
I'll probably have my eyes wide
And my plan, I don't know
Goin' crazy, yea for sure
Got to get in where I fit in, watch me motherfucking grow
Y'all some parasites
Shootin' at my paradise
'Bout to grip the top, best believe that I ain't scared of heights
I've died dropping, I'll down a couple hot pockets
And if you can't see it's dope, check your eye sockets
And I'm ghost, and I'm ghost, and I'm ghost, and I
I got you motherfuckers hangin' by a rope and I
Never really meant to brag or to boast, but I
I think you gotta
When you kicking it this dope brotha
Uh-uh, uh-uh, Tell me that it's not true
Y'all that type that brag about
Some shit your parents bought you
I wake up in the morning doing everything I want to
Hustle to the field of the bull, yo I gotchu
I said I hustle to the field of the bull, I gotchu
