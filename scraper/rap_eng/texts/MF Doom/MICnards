Soul brothers, from other mothers, stutter off each other like butter
But her butts like no other though!
Any who - (sorry) “LEM you hungry?” “Naw that’s plenty Betty Sue!”
Mumbling on the MIC after me, lay off the henny dude
Bring plenty pennies to us, plus twenties too
Do it how we do till 22 and after
After your shows there’s laughter, after my flows it’s rapture
Consult Usain Bolt, he couldn’t lap my mind
Try to find a cat signed that’s messing with my grind
The black pastor, I preach hymns ain’t seen grams dance faster
Young padawans peep the head masters
Ear buds in, sucka I’m your head’s master
Hats off to the cat’s that snapped on
Been slept on, stepped on, rapped and leapt on
Plus a day keeps the doctor away
Bringing in the batter - no matter what he say
Mayday, mayday, get out the booth
Swing a punch line thatta knock out a tooth or two
The super two, Shags and Scooby-Doo
Clueless dubey dudes stunned from the funky dung he spew
Get out ya monkey suits
