[Verse 1]
Mega bosses
Coptic intersections
Cities is gorgeous
With the night gargoyle glarin' on European fortress
Flawless
Fashion kissed amidst the grips of devil's corpses
On bronze velvet loom the Moorish History's pistol, now loaded
Defy logic of definition's issue
Self quoted brothel
Fuck with me, get a mouthful
Sour bands radiate vibrations on Gallivan
Just beatin' down the boulevards
To kick bars that would reroute you
Man
Trigger tongues finger fuck Solomon's Key and bun
These daggers held in a spiral
Thrown like darts when peasants go run
In the presence
Of my mind to eyein' my leverage
Sole controller the planet but soul controllers want me to forget it
Spare the dream
Yo if I sleep I'm chokin' on kerosene
Paper weight
Hold down the hood like murder wrote by the queen
We boycott Christmas fulfillin' God's wishes
My wish for mines to blow inside ya box and blow yall scene
Yall good as gone
Rockin' my grandfather's charm-- Excelsior
Poor righteous flow evolved to enrich
No humidor
Piff lore with a parallel myth from out my pores
Liftin' scores from the manifold
The silencer a cantaloupe
Ponder on the nature
The Neteru that laid some jewels to cut through this equation
Fly nigga at the train station
Kick in the door like a Premier knock or Private Stock libation
That fit the triple seven right through the slot
I'm Classi Middle School hot, came from a hard place
And so the kid decide he should rock and rock at Allah's pace
Iron in the morning sharin' mom's face
Lonely sons that's hard pressed to rise out of shape til they detonate
When black holes bustin' like dutches-- luscious reverberate
Trickle through the deeds for the leads of creasin' the heavyweight
Then ima travel light
Gather like reich
Defiance on mics for the lavish insight
We keepin' shit tight
Above all else sun

[Chorus]
A fine line between makin'
Money that's for your kingdom
Trials that would make it funny
Debt to Hell
A fine line between livin', golden
Thinkin' shit is sweet and get ya cap frozen, down in here
A fine line might make you think you, chosen
But know the realest truth that remains is holdin'
Onto skill
Now if I wanna eat would I....?
I know that I'm a good hood guy
Yeah
