[Rap]
Fear-erasing
Doomsday coming closer
Reveal the racists
Unveil the evilest people yeah
Point em out
Take your time this the point to make
You see em doing wrong
Point em out
Got points to make
We got points to make clear

We got got got got
Got points to make clear
Huh?
Point em out and I'l get em
They been tryna wrong me
Really think that I'll let em?
Hmm
Really think that I'd sit it back a desk job
Really think my reach would reach far as your desk god?
Really thought I might leave it in word form
Really thought I might leave and then work for em
I'd milly rock round an office
No filled forms
Just houses of cards
Cleverly clawed in place
Humming melodies off
I'm no Kelly Rowland
I got destiny on
The phone
They tryna tap in my line
I hear the click click click
They tryna pass it as fine
What? Bitch
U stealin
U can claim at as yours and even make your money off it
But you stealin, deep down i know its troubling your conscience
But you don't care how it feels
I can't say the same in fact I'll say I hate how it feels
To not be proud of me
To not be loud
One day im rocking the crowd with me
For now I'm round just kickin playin with sounds and beats
Ain't none bringing me down...

(Fear-erasing)
Doomsday coming closer
Reveal the racists
Unveil the evilest people yeah
Point em out
Take your time this the point to make
You see em doing wrong
Point em out
Got points to make
We got points to make clear

I'm
Warming up I got time for practice
Old enough, feel like time done did its thing twice
Showed me nough for me to time my tactics
And now I'm hoping that this bitch gon get her shit right with me
In line with me
And now I'm hoping that this bitch gon get her shit right with me
In line with me
And now I'm knowing that this thing gon fit in just right

Bare witness, real ones handle they business
That's the difference between
Sissy boys in it for a buck
Or a fuck
Catch them odds
Boy might be shit outta luck...
You get me?
Cowardice gon stay afraid
Power shit is too outplayed
People hurt you for a check
How am I the one that's lame?
When I'm writing for the dollar that'll only ever pay
For more and more of myself
Ain't no gettin in the way
Of a sound proof sound
Try to stop me imma smile
While I'm bumping my sounds
On the way to bigger grounds
With boots to stomp on
With DOOM to talk on
These fools has won ton
Not talkin soup
