[Intro]
The darkness falls away tomorrow, as a lone masked man [?] the worlds greatest detective delivers three agents of a foreign power
I appreciate all the trouble you went to, you must understand
The experiments we've been conducting here are against our will
Muahaha!
The biggest and boldest robbery in the history of New York, and a one man job at that, so you know who I am
Tell me, How did you figure it out?

[Verse 1]
Check, check
I tell 'em, flow strictly for the headphones
Y'all be treading lightly, but I tread stones
A young Jason Bourne, chasin' more, replacin' scourned, a crown of thorns, placin' on the proper placement, dawg
Live from the basement to the pavement
Wonderin' where the day went, and where the day go
My nuts still hang low, even though they a no-show, oh no
Mans is movin' like hopes, used to be hella close, now they hate us
Fuck 'em, salute to breadren, I still cater, love 'em
Got snakes in my boot, so in the booth I be on the shoe
To infinity and beyond, I never be on the whack shit
Rappers is ass and they just drop shit
But me? I can't just drop shit
I be flowing throughout my subconscious
Dream is stressin' the essence of my progression
Meanin' spreadin' the message throughout recession
Fiendin', blessin' adolescence with my presence
Schemin', lightin incense is my incentive
Dream is stressin' the essence of my progression
Meanin' spreadin' the message throughout recession
Fiendin', blessin' adolescence with my presence
Schemin', lightin incense is my incentive

[Outro]
Word is bond on some double O shit
Flowin' out, we potent, like the ocean
Word is bond on some double O shit
Flowin' out, we potent, like the ocean
