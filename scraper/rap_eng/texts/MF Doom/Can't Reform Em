[Intro]
Here it goes, the juice
*Aggghraagh*

Well, we'll find out
Yeah, ya' know it's- it's funny how a nice kid like that gets to be a gunman
Yeah, haha

You all dug him once!
Because you are hipped that he was solid
How can you now come on so square
Now that he's tapped out of this world
And all of you cats are goofed to wig city
[?] we sure is
You see this right

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Wreak havoc, beep beep it's mad traffic
Sleek and lavish people speaking leaking to the maverick
He see as just another felony drug arrest
Any day could be the one he pick the wrong thug to test
Slug through the vest... Shot in the street
For pulling heat on a father whose baby's gotta eat
And when they get hungry, it ain't shit funny
Paid to interfere with how a brother get his money
Now, who's the real thugs, killers and gangsters?
Set the revolution, let the things bust and thank us
When the smoke clear, you can see the sky again
There will be the chopped off heads of Leviathan
My friend, they call 'em strangers
Anybody talk to him end up in some danger

Can't reform 'em

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
They pray four times a day, they pray five
Who ways is strange when it's time to survive
Some will go of they own free will to die
Others take them with you when they blow sky high
What's the difference? All you get is lost children
While the bosses sit up behind the desks
It cost billions to blast humans in half, into calves and arms
Only one side is allowed to have bombs
It's like making a soldier drop his weapon
Shooting him, and telling him to get to stepping
Obviously, they came to portion up his fortune
Sounds to me like that old robbery/extortion

Same game
You can't reform 'em
