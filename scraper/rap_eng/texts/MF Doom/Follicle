[Verse 1: Infinite Sidd]
First of many rappers with a slick tongue, a bitch hung
Over his shoulder, never looked colder
This a toast to all those who chose to spit
Don't sweat, don't stress, we the lonely kids
Don't lose your hair over this, just comb the shit
Sin, we don't atone to that, tone your skin
Look good, feel good, like a million
Tell me, how you skin a chameleon when he feeling himself?
That's a paradox I think of while me and death in a staring off
I fare him a goodbye, reach over and tear his arm off, surprise!
Mudafucka

[Interlude]
His hair falling, wind blowing
Skin showing on the pavement
Blisters on his knees replacing the hatred
He smiles with a grin. Oh hey, hi, how you been?
Oh say, Jesus, how you sin?
Souls gone, now I'm dead...
Now I'm dead
