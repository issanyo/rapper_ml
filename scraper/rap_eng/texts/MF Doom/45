(Verse 1)

Oh you really wanna be that nigga, fuck a bitch
Oh you really wanna be that nigga, face a zip
Oh you really wanna be that nigga, sell your soul
Illuminati got a nigga rocking hella gold
Been in the game so long trying to make a name
It's only slavery if you're in it for the whips and chains
I been cold but you niggas sleep
Waking up all of the haters when they see me on the tv
With a bitch who's complexion is the chocolatest
I'm on a roll and ain't nobody gon be stopping this
I'm in this bitch, throwing L's to the blue sky
The winning circle you niggas didn't even qualify
Got all of your bitches you niggas couldn't even satisfy
Feet kicked up, just watching my dollars multiply
Sneak dissers and haters I'm coming straight for the cranium
Came into my own and ain't nobody gon be taming him
I'm from the city where niggas kill over Jordan sneaks
And paper, paper, dollar bill is what a nigga speak
Pelle Pelle, Vasques in the summer time
True Religion is what's worn around the waistline
Chi town Illin', Blue Line chillin'
I'm a murderer, that Englewood killin'
I'm so westside, but I'm wild hunnid
They ask me where I'm from Chi City over nothing
Its young Kel rich daily like the mayor
Playerlistic approaches to bitches wanting my paper
Super duper laced in latest sneaker drop
Fuck a cop, fuck a opp, dump on any nigga spot
Green superhero bout my coin like Luigi
Pop up on ya lady and the top i how she greet me
Ion even need to crack I got her wrapped around my index
I'm harder than you thought feel it all in your appendix
The realest nigga on the west of the wind
Don't approach me if it ain't about some bread or some skins
No porky rinds but a nigga rhyme like a loonie
Goonie hitting licks serving out a Suzuki
Foreign broads from Japan kicking shit like Kabuki
She a groupie she a hoochie
Stain then kick her out the hooptie
Hit me up the next day im act like she never knew me
I'm a dog you a bitch looking for you like you Scooby
Laying hands like I'm Knuckles, come and get it come and tussle
I'm just young and getting paid flapping gums and flexing muscle
Shout my niggas from  the 'L' shout my niggas from the 'K'
Shout my niggas hitting Chase cracking cards like a case
Gotta get it anyway, gotta get it everyday
For the love of that cheese making faces Stevie J
I start my day with a J' then I find a beat to slay
Rich daily on the rise but this ain't no easy bake nigga

I'm so 1994 like I'm missing 23
Even in my worst season ain't nobody stopping me nigga
