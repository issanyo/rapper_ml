* girls giggling *

[Onyx]
Oh Pete Nice? I'm smoother than him, man I mean
He wears suits and all, you know no disrespect... *incomprehensible*

[Girls]
Yeah right, just a thought (* giggling *)

[Zev Love X]
Heavy D yo, the girls they love me
(* girls crack up *) They love me, I just know it!

[Onyx]
Yea Positive K? He's dip dip divin ??

[Girls]
Yeah right

[Zev Love X]
Yeah LL, yo he might keep the girls +Jinglin+
But yo.. I'm the man (* girls crack up *)
I'm the man, as a matter of fact
Yo, see they laughin at me man

[Girls]
I'm the man!

[Zev Love X]
Yo, that ain't right
Yo, well anyway

By the hairs of my chinny chin chin, gots many plus plenty
String by string, I think I counts like twenty
If you loan me a ear, I'll return it with interest
If not, I'll simply twist your wrist
So listen up closely, with thoughts to recoup me
Cause I hope to gross like ten cent per groupie
Now only if I had two G's per strand
Ask my anchor banker, he understands
I used to wrap my hand around a cold gold can
Someone once said health is wealth, so check self
I gots a perfect check-up, 'cept for a hiccup, roll with no stick-up
How can I keep the goya nectars on my shelf?
Oh boya how I searched for an employer
But before Z. L. Huckleberry Finn was in Tom Sawyer
Now use your imagination, just a smidgen
If I was a bird I'd be a pigeon
Succumb one to crumbs and pizza crust, when every fella can
Eat fresh fish and live fat like pelican
Then again, that's only if your capable for freckles
Or blue eyes -- I settle for Heckle'n'Jeckle
While I chuckle at my man with the cellular phone
The only phone I own's a funky xylophone's tone
Ain't no joy in annoyin high-pitched ringin
We do the tap twist and twitch bringin
Through soul and this cordless thingamajig
Sure as Subroc's clippers etch a clue to your wig
We'll do the gig so make your mind, thumb twiddlers
The pipe, the bowl or us fiddlers, don't riddle us
I'll even ride a bus to the coast if clear
For okay pay, I'll stay here
Now all this runnin round's kickin me right in the rear
And still I'm judged by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
And I'm able to hit a skin (* girls giggling *)
Just like my man Puba Maxwell, so I'm smooth

[Onyx]
Yeah, Kane he get the job done but yo, I take care of business

[Zev Love X]
{Peachfuzz} Now what's up with this peachfuzz nonsense?
{Peachfuzz} What are y'all talkin about this peachfuzz?
{Peachfuzz} Nah, I just got one thing to say
{Peachfuzz} Ahh man..

[Onyx]
By the hairs of my chinny chin chin, six black hairs
String by string, I think I counts five pairs
That's a little, but still, can I get a thumbs up?
At least for the peachfuzz that sums up
A tidbit, yeah that's it, but who gives a sugar
Honey iced tea besides me
For if, I ever riff, yet and still, ? windmills
So I take time just to kill
I say cute is for a bear, teddy bear like Teddy Ruxpin
Would I be handsome if I pimped in a tux then
Smoked a cigar with some black chinese shoes then
Picked up some friends in my Benz and start cruisin
Huh, that's a dream that I ain't even livin
If that makes a man, surely I'll recommend
I'll stay a toy boy eatin Butterfingers
With Knowledge of Self, and colorin books on my shelf
I wanna grow up, cause maybe if I did then
I wouldn't be treated like a Toys'R'Us kid when
They counts ten upon my chin
By the hairs of my peachfuzz, let's say each was
An inch, sike because I can't pull or pinch
It's a wrench, and I thought life would be a cinch
But anyway, anyhow, let's talk about someway, somehow
How I can make my peachfuzz grow out
But really, do I need beard that grows in all pores
Just to be respected and resemble Santa Claus?
Hear this clear, I'm a MAN I tell ya
No dreams or drugs like the slugs will I ever sell ya
A man I am, in the body of a youth
So don't play me like I'm Born Universe Truth Truth
So when I knock at your hearts, let me in
And judge me not by the hairs of my chinny chin chin

[Onyx]
Yeah, that's what we call, pimpin presence yo
Call me tonight, knowhatI'msayin?

[Girls]
(* girls laughing *) You got it

[Zev Love X]
Yeah, you know I eat no pork
So why can't I be as smooth as my man Dr. York?
(* girls crack up *) I see none!

[Onyx]
Yo.. I'm smoother than the bottom of Hammer's shoes
After three hundred spins

[Zev Love X]
No love here
No hair on my chest, but my boy Ak West, I'm just smoother
I'm just smoother

[Girls]
Yeah right

[Onyx]
I'm definitely smoother than y'all just saw

[Girls]
It's about time!

[Zev Love X]
I'm sayin, yo but, I don't want to hear
{Peachfuzz} none of this peachfuzz nonsense
{Peachfuzz} (Can't understand) Peachfuzz
{Peachfuzz} You know
{Peachfuzz} * girls giggling *

[Girls]
{Peachfuzz} He's a little boy
{Peachfuzz} * giggling *
{Peachfuzz}
{Peachfuzz} * laughing *
{Peachfuzz}
{Peachfuzz}
{Peachfuzz}
{Peachfuzz} .. * fades *
