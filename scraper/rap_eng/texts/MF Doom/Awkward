[Verse 1]

Out of everyone I know I must be the shyest
When people talk I'm completely silent
Then I wonder when I hear "he's so quiet!"
So I say - errr, errr...
Every conversation topic I've been in
I don't understand it but nod in agreement
Then they ask a question about what they were speaking
I bust a - er, d-, err...
I get made fun of and don't know what to say straight away
Then I think of a comeback - way too late
I try to bust it but the conversation's changed
And I'm like: er, er, er-
See I think of the right thing to say in my head
It just comes out awkward the way that it's said
I can't help it. Conversations are lead to
Umm, y- umm, err...

[Hook]

I'm awkward, not a guy you wanna talk with
I just stutter like umm er-errr
Shit yo, fuck, I'm awkward
Fucking up this chorus
I am awkward, not a guy you wanna talk with
I just stutter like umm er-errr
Shit yo, fuck, I'm awkward
Stuttering this chorus

[Verse 2]

I adjust my personality to my surroundings
A different person depending who I'm around with
When groups meet can't do much about it
But beg be like - eh... err...
And I hate when I'm trying to say my point
In a room that's full of people making noise
But they go quiet when I raise my voice
And I'm like - errr... phhh
Or if someone in a club's talking in my ear
And I say repeat that, sorry I didn't hear
They do it again but it still isn't clear
I'm like - ...yeah
Or if we're watching sitcoms or a cartoon
I'm a sheep - I hear canned laughter I laugh too
But it backfires when somebody asks you:
What was that I didn't get it? ...Errr

[Hook 2]

I'm awkward, not a guy you wanna talk with
I just stutter like umm er-errr
Fuck yo, shit, I'm just awkward
Fucking up this chorus
I am awkward, not a guy you wanna talk with
I just stutter like umm er-errr
Aww shit yo, fuck, I'm... chorus
Fucking up this awkward
I am chorus, not a guy you wanna talk with
I just stutter like umm er-errr
Shit yo, fuck, I'm awkward
Fucking up this chorus, I'm awkward
