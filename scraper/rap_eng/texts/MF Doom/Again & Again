[Verse 1]
It's the mind of the adventurous
Used to being shy but he mischievous
And catch 'em by surprise like Christmases
Now that I got everybody watching like witnesses
This sketch artist sharp like Picasso with his vividness
Like Jaden, ain't no way they gonna picket it
I'm sick with it, they never opposed like it was fitting in
Sick with it and never opposed to be fitting in
Before switching I would wish death like many men
I'm illustrating with the pen, call it painting
Getting rich or die trying, patiently waiting
My trail been blazing, I'm reminding them of Damien
Known to terrorize in any space they try to place me in
Like gyms, I'll embrace it within
And blocking out any who watchers who been hating my spin
I been trying to get it proper but the [?]
Cause like doctors for anorexia, my patience is thin

[Hook]
Feel I been here again and again
Again and again, again and again
And all that we knowing is to win or descend
Win or descend, win or descend
And I be out long giving ten out of ten
Ten out of ten, ten out of ten
I fear I'll be here again and again
Again and again, again and again

[Verse 2]
My biggest fear is dying and then waking to be here
Trapped in the Matrix with fakeness and the hate from my peers
Been feeling this for some years, it's sincere and never leaving
There's gotta be more to this cause there's nothing new I'm seeing
I feel like I'm in a life loop, dying and repeating
On the edge of tomorrow and just cruising for a reason
I'm trying to figure this out so I'm finally leaving
And really I ain't tweaking, I'm just seeking the meaning
This can't be it, life has got to more than this horrible pit
All the ism, you can keep us in the prism and split
Got their mind in a prison that they'll never forget
And I'm as free as a bird and [?]
I'm free bird alone, should I what I wish
My mind's like a satellite, I use it like dish
Networking with the gift and abyss
I can't miss, nah not this
Bulls eye when the darts fly by, I'ma hit
This is it, Mike Jack with the rap when I spit
I'm legit, they the kind I been trying to omit
Showing Rick they were hating [?]

[Hook]
Feel I been here again and again
Again and again, again and again
And all that we knowing is to win or descend
Win or descend, win or descend
And I be out long giving ten out of ten
Ten out of ten, ten out of ten
I fear I'll be here again and again
Again and again, again and again
