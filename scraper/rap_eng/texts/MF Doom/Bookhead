Last of a righteous breed
Relax & breathe
Whats on the outside
Is whats underneath
A mad face
That show his teeth
They never understand
I don't think that its meant to be
So I fly away just to see
How your life will be
Without little old me
I dose off & i can hear my Nana speak
She said its destiny
Teach the streets like sesame
But respectfully
100 problems
& i choose em all
If it don't work out
I know that i wasn't wrong
I put my heart in every song
Shit..i know where my heart belongs
So i gotta stay strong
Not for me , for my littl sisters
I'm not trying be just another nigga
But its so much trouble in this mirror
Maybe I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one
Imagine everyone
Having fun
Under the sun
But its Capital Punishment word to Big Pun
