[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
See, it's like, okay, where I come from in my neighborhood
My people know me, you know what I'm sayin'?
See if I try to come any different, they ain't gonna respect me no more
You know what I'm saying, because they, you know, people got that thing about themselves, you know
If you come from that neighborhood, you know what I'm saying, you can, you can
Get out the neighborhood but you can never take the neighborhood outta the people
Know what I'm saying? But if you tryna, like, jump and cross over to the other side, people understand that and they don't like that
That's why they don't be buying people's music
See we keeps it real
We always gon' keep it real

[XL]
They try to shake me down like Parkinson's but all they ought to find is I'm an artist
And from lost times parting with my heart to find a part of mine
And part sides with the lies, but I know the world is full of 'em
And i can feel the aura that you're so thin
Pulled the sword from the stone again
No need to get my rap dagger dull again
And you don't get another chance, so no askin' bout the mulligan
And it ain't cash if I don't see it'n my hand I won't be throwing it
Taking heads, making bread, shaking feds, breaking sets
Better than any fake that ever made the claim they can
Easy bake and my opponent sees the paper 'fore I toast 'em
Dropping bombs spar on 'em pop 'em like a soda
Exploding like a supernova
Leave your shit [?] like a terraphobic land rover
Moving coast to coast looking for some more exposure
But I'm frozen over with the thought pf going nowhere
But that ain't possible, indigo they hittin' licks with them sticks, no Popsicle
Put it through your noggin for thinking you talked about 'em
Taking care of business, my oppositions ain't obstacles
You just some odd balls, or even the plain fields
Compared to me you a child, 'bout to slash some training wheels
The chopper cocked and still they act like they have mass appeal
Who got the mask of skill?
I'm popping off so you should pass the pill
Pastor black as well, no lacking passion, rapping dope for real
Front and center with the heat, like I was Shaquille O'Neal
