Rhymemaster Charlie G going galactic
This life I came from wasn't fantastic
Had to be flexable like elastic
Ain't fake like plastic cause that's cheap
Think deep and like video games stay away from the creeps
I like marshmellows but don't like the peeps
Learned to enjoy winning through defeat
Take a seat on this wild cattle ride
From the funky style to saddle I write
Over a clear light night
Just earlier got a bite at the MexiCali Express
It was the best so I came back wth the fam
Got a few tacos and was just like Damn
Yasiel Puig coming with the grand slam
Found this beat and I just went ham
Without further adue let me say this true
If I dont live my life kicking through the speaker
Ill end up just to be another tweaker
Slip in my sneaker check all my features and clothes
No hoes no drama
Peep I'm almost outta high school and no baby mama
Keep my rhyme warm just like a busy sauna
Lyrics and poems swarm in my head
Let these bad thoughts get me and ill kill myself dead
Around seven pushing in about going to heaven
Swallowed some pills and booze at the age of eleven
Life in the house really wasn't that great
Falling in bad shape
Wrote a poem in the 1st grade
Scribbled hand writing but it was made
Got my first relate of rap as a young boy
Elementary music teacher telling how i sung with joy
And there I begun at point
10 years later seems like just yesterday
Writing funky joints Making that first album right
Keep ya bobbing all night
I like my drinks dark never light
I get into mischief sometimes ain't so bright
My height is about 5 foot 6 inches
I going all in for the riches and tha bitches
Gotta keep cool and calm
Fresh like pomade
I dont want booty sex that's shit craze I ain't magic
And from eazy, the rap community sees aids as tragic
Pass that, here you can have it
Women are still like trading cards
Getting drove on like boulevards
That's a damn shame cause faces are more than names and photos
But brothas can't keep shit on the low so you know
Rumors are spread some shit about head leave you socially dead nothing but some walking pussy
Unfed and selected to break the bed and not the bread
Can't unsay what was said
But hey yo
Life has its come and goes like a mini mart
Good and bad, but remain strong at heart
Dont get torn apart by others
Live up to your own identity
Wanna party or wanna read
Control a mic like an MC
Wanna rock or make stock
Tick and talk live off the block
Wanna be slut or wanna be virgin
Don't wanna graduate high school here's your application for the pizza hut
I'm tryna be the Hip-Hop Head Surgeon
No need for a confirmation this is Version 2 of Charlie G
Coming in hot right on the spot yeah that's me
Out from the 5-0-3 or even 9-7-1
Call it done see ya where the sun sets along the Oregon coast
Where we toast the sea
And be gone with anxiety
Smoke the best tree and get high as me as I climb the billboard to the top
And there I just won't stop
Gimma the crown im the best in town
But yo I'm still underground
