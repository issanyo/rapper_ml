[Kid shokora]

Try to step up to us and you will be the last name of the same nigga who made this beat plus E-D
I'm on like the middle of Vons, take that out and leave the V-S, i guess these kids are competing
We got meeting of people saying we're deceiving
But we're achieving
And bro we keep it leaning

Like lil wayne on syrup with his tires popped
Got em jumping on the couch cuz my flow is lava hot

I'm playing with myself I'm on that Calvin & Hobbes
Jumping over the boarder and taking nigga's yobs

I fill out the applications honestly
And hopefully they promise me
A view overlooking the palm trees

How you say you high and i can touch your ceiling
How you say you're flow is clean and your maid ain't sweeping

I'm just TeamDreaming, CBMing, while I'm Skywalking
Smoking in the Heavens now i got the Angels coughing

Like

[Kid raven]

Sinsation is the name cuz i got the building shaking
Like a nerdy sex scene x equals sixty nine in this equation

And I'm pacing
Cuz normally I'm racing
On speed, no need, cuz the weed is my inspiration
Got the crowd roaring just on anticipation
And i'll kick you in your knee son, dont get your girl taken

He name is...is Liam Neeson...get it?
