[Verse 1: Benzos]
I better crack the window to blow out the good smoke
Blowing and im puffing on this good hydro
This kush that we dealing out to the crowd
All I deal in my sack is the good loud, better sell it by the pound
Now i'm in the ground, dealing out all i could
I did it with the wood, and I know that I should
I do, but you misunderstood
I recitate now i fucking reputate, reputate now i insulate it
Now we fucking reputated about all the things that we situated
Situated-
Now i'm concentrated, all like orange juice
Now I drink it down on the damn sploof
I don't gives a fuck smoke spliff
Now i'm going back
Backwards
Take a hit, take a hit of that blunt, till I stunt on this cunt
I don't give a fuck, I don't even need a front
Gotta front it front it front it on a nigga if we stunting on a nigga
Coming in crazy and i'm blunting on a nigga
I don't give a fuck about you still pulling on my triggers
Forties to your head 'til I see six figures
See them dollar signs pop up, pop up on the highway and I pulling in the driveway screeching out all sideways
Popping with my gat 'til his brains gone slat over the wall just like that
Like a baseball bat

[Verse 2: Yung Lyfe]
So we got a lot of thots in town but I don't give a fuck
Cause everyone knows where to get around
Going for the loud, fined by the pound don't give a fuck now
Im bout to smoke your girl out
About to get in her pants
Don't give a fuck, her titties got the size of a fucking ant bite
But i'd rather get my dick right in the pussy
Don't give a fuck when i'm smoking on the sussy
But I got that warm shit cooking in the microwave
Eating all these bitches, getting really fried
Getting high payed doin my way

[Verse 3: Benzos]
All I know is to blow, all I've ever done is coke
And I never played in anything but snow
Might as well grow up in the Arctic
Better restart it
So retarded that my brain don't even work
Better Make that bitch twerk
If i'm acting like a jerk, I don't give a fuck about you
Obviously all i care about is all my money and my weed
Better plant it from the seed, like its hydroponics
Weed so good, I sold it as tonic
I don't give a fuck, still going in chronic
Got a back pain? Better go insane
Better smoke up on this train, I don't need no plane
Going in now, bitch, staying on my fade
Stay on my fame, and i'm staying on the game
'Imma stay up on the plane, while I stay up on my reign
