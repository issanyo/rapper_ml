I want to scream at the top of my lungs
I want to figure out what is real what's my deal
I want to kill everything that I want
I want to forgive but I forgotten how to move on
I want to punch through a glass fucking window
Break my prouder arm shallow
My apologies are sincere I know that I'm trying



It's hard to move on, so I hold a grudge
Like you holding your fathers hand
All covered in dirt and semen
I could hate you forever if I was so nice
Get walked over all the time
So what do I do
Walk on other people I know because
I see them in my rear-view
Welcome to the land of broken hearted people babe but
Everything is peachy
More potatoes for gravy
Very soft very sour
You could hate me forever over something I did
Instead of forgive
I want to say fuck you

And let it live and let the rise of the
Ashes like Phenoix
Open all the windows so you see it
Free it, stink like shit so I febreze it
Then I wear it instead of take a bath
Like a otter when I wanna puff a bit of Marijuana

I want to scream at the top of my lungs
I want to figure out what is real what's my deal
I want to kill everything that I want
I want to forgive but I forgotten how to

I want to scream at the top of my lungs
I want to figure out what is real what's my deal
I want to kill everything that I want
I want to forgive but I forgotten how to move on

Get down, get down with (ya funky self?), Move on x3 iii
Get down, get down with (ya funky self?) x5

You could hate me forever over something I did
Instead of forgive, Put some lotion on ya ashy face
Don't you understand I am a man and I make mistakes
Call me up in the east part with the frozen lakes
Where no one can find me obviously
Want to hide under a rock
