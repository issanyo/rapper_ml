[Verse 1: Cass Hadley]

I wasn't tryna catch a case, like Max B
But pretty green always seems to attract me
Her eyes harassed me
I stared back and she asked me
Damn you cute
You tryna run this like a track meet?
Where was you last seen?
Just don't attract heat
If you don't blow this, I will
And make you happy
She dapped me
Her ass was immaculate
I took it back to the crib
And rolled the blunt fat as shit
Now we scheming
Talking like we're out of it
Walk in with the AK like it's Payday
Then we out this bitch
Yeah I'm bout this
Foxy can drive the get-away
It's not like he's been getting paid, Anyway
Just some kids getting fucked up in anyway
16 C's but we can't afford Medicaid
Anyway, Excuse the hyperbole
Thoughts are obtuse when i get a little herb in me
She served the tea
Pennyroyal I believe
All I know is I know nothing, like Socrates
Bitch please, You know you've got to give me more
Started off with liquor stores
Now we on to bigger scores
Armored trucks aren't really much I'm getting bored
Ain't been sober in a month or 4
Plus the cops curse the day that my mother fucking cut the chord?

Bonnie's loko but i love her so
I called her Hunnybunny
We wrote a Pulp Fiction
She's got a pretty face but i won't miss it
Cause now she's got me framed up like Biggavell
One last kiss she said you devilish
So give them hell
So i gave them hell
