[Verse 1: Infinite Sidd]
Blowing smoke up in the air seemed to clear out the clouds
Hopefully soberness get a little less tough to handle, so the going gets stepping backwards
Ego fills me up at times, but still just average
Mood gets dampered, low class no attendance, dosage heavy
This trench coat be smelling, jeez
When this bad habit get me addicted, a fiend
I'm missing the scene, we called the other day...
Melancholy got me. I'm ripping the receipt with your number!
Go fuck yourself, bitch. Or four others!
Forget it, this just hurts me;
But what irks me is I forget to smoke weed one fine day, and I start to recollect
Every little poor decision I made, regretting them
I grab the medicine, and recuperate
If I don't regret this, then maybe I'm made to sin
All my thoughts are cluttered and vaguer than the dream I had last night

Fuck
