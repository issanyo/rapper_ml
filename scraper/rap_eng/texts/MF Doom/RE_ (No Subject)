Check, check
Yeah
One-two, one-two
Here we go
DOOM
So happy i got through
Tell me it's not true
That you got fuckin' deported
Talk about retarded
I bought two of your last seven inches
It's my lunch hour
I brought nothin' but gun powder
But ya gotta tell me, what's new
I got a lot to do
It came as quite a shock
When i heard my man doin' the inside-a talk
On a podcast sayin' you got writer's block
So i thought i would write you this letter
Who knows, maybe ya could even light a spark
I just got my eyebrows trimmed
And now i look 25 again
My boys are not 5 and 10
Their 10 and 8
And neither are ever gonna menstruate
How the hell do you live away from your babies
I'd rather try and pay for a Mercedes
In other words, sounds like a bad deal
As a dad, i can't even imagine how you feel
It defies the social contract
What's up with the bi-coastal contact
The telepathy signals got disrupted transatlantic
My bars cause other emcees stands a panic
Ha ha made ya clap
Hey Sway how's the state of rap
Pretentious, facetious, empty i hate you
Questlove gave me a gang of beats when my 2nd son was born
And i've been makin' demos since, the kind of under perform
But yo i'm workin' on em, i'm makin' progress
I'm the trifecta, i got a crazy process
I'm still obsessed with rhymes and that'll never stop
But supportin' a family in brooklyn
And makin' a worried, good-looking women happy makes my head pop
But trust me, my new joints can make a dead cop do the wop
I'm a rap bat from back when tap that didn't mean snapchat
Plus i'm workin' on YOUNGMAN with Paul
And i should have somethin' bumpin' by fall
And somethin' to see, a bump (diddley?)
Talk about good company
The men behind the cameras coach ryan
My sons baseball coach
He and his team took down sheldon silver
A felon super villager
Now a fallen figure
Made a fuss, later cuz
You the greatest there ever was
Well second greatest, rakim's number one
The (quote go roll now monarun?)
