[Verse]
Im mentally sick but i pick the right instrumentals
Your girl so gently more like sentimental
Whoever try to see my rhyme book its confidential
I ain't playing please dont be judgmental
Can i be chance and be experimental
Chillin' at central waitin' for that medal
What else can i say i really wanna shine
But i won't lie my mind is fluctuated i keep pressing that number nine
Its on my mind girls now days are always on my line
Niggas on site give it up
I told you im coming up
This is my warm up
Third eye open investigating
Government lies with these eyes
20 years old but im so wise
The devil gonna rise
Need to hide my soul cause its a prize
Whenever someone dies someone cries
Im only in this world to give you advise
Are you surprise
Hell yeah kid with no confidence
Going to the top
Deep down am i really gonna flop
Im tryin' to make history with this weird dream
Haters everywhere shinning me down
Gonna live up to this dream
Blowing out steam
But oh well i have my team
The scheme is to get a deal and die tryin'
Im goin' extreme wit this words
So poetic its pathetic when you see a guy chase for ass for so long
Eyes are magnetic
Met a real bad chick
She wanna hang around with my clique
Oh thats SICK
Praying for my sins
Peeling of skins
Hiipower, Hiipower, Hiipower
Rules the nation and the... radio station
Persistent when i write so consistent when i rap
On a mission do you girl in every position
Now she wants to be my mistress
In every season thats the reason
With that great pleasing
Winning the race to success
Such a dream chaser
King in time
Remember the name
And...
What i sayyyyy
