(Verse 1)Yahzee
Y'all motherfuckers
Y'all mother fuckers
,yall motherfuckers make my stomach ache
Cuz y'all to sweet like now and laters,y'all here now but never here later
Y'all niggas checking who checking for you,but nobody checking for you
You growing old in the school of new school
Better gather ya soul and use it as a new tool
Cuz i'm playing pool with ya boys and i already hit two outta eight
One out of four of y'all niggas wasn't ready like y'all ain't runnin without the weight
What more can i say
All i want to say is im doing a sound check
(Hook)*2
Yahzee and kellz doing a sound check

Bouta kill this shit man

Looking for y'all niggas check check

(VERSE 2)Yahzee
Y'all here talking like y'all been here for awhile
Y'all here talking like you setting a new style
I'm here not talking and i'm outta breath
Bcuz im tryna show out from my bigger shadows ,like my name was seth
I ain't jacking im the best yet
But i'm tryna be the best yet
Don't play with me before i make you meet ya death bed
You know what i said
YOU CAN MEET YA ACCLAIMED MAKER IN THE DEATH BED
But that's all
Im Gone Nigga
