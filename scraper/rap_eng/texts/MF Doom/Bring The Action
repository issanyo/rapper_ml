[verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
Yo the grain I go against it like a slave boat in Memphis
The stage show’s electric and my late flow is Netflix
Mindframe is overzealous my main goal is to get it
Paid flows collecting pesos from angels and devils

[verse: Skeezo]
With music ill never settle Set the bar at higher levels
Bang it out like heavy metal Verbally express my mental
Through verses written with pencil While others trace it like stencil
I exercise on instrumentals Lyrically I’m presidential

[verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
And now the rents due you gotta pay the piper
I was in the gym putting in work like the greatest fighters
Po and Skeezo bring it to whoever claim the nicest

[verse: Skeezo]
Before the righteous I was slap boxing  with lifers
Doing pull ups in the yard With da gods in the cypher
Build with Osiris And dropped gems
So heavy its priceless You moving like us
A Cookie cutter of illest writer's
But You a biter like 97 my ears on fire

[Hook: Skeezo]
Napoleon & skeezo Like clockwork

[Hook: Napoleon Da Legend]
Step in the square Get your mic broke And feelings hurt

[Hook: Skeezo]
Pursue the passion With the rapping Now let’s get it cracking
What they talking We been walking So we bring the action

[verse: Skeezo]
The sharpest dagger Wit the swag of a pastor
Poker face stay straight See i move like a master
Spray the place Beat laced We some actual rappers
You an actual actor Acting like you a trapper

[verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
Regardless you just a corny recording artist we just corner the market
Bookers ain’t calling you they calling you garbage
Polly like Gorbachef handling beef like Stroganoff
Fly to Bogota while you screaming the most you can get close
But no cigar you overloading bars trying to act lyrical
Shit is laughable they love you first as soon as you pass em
That’s when they mad at you always been a hustler
You always been a buster anything I ever utter’s better
Than what you can muster

[verse: Skeezo]
Certified line's Hook sinker
Roll with sharp thinkers The bait heavy like steak
Chase the beef get laid to sleep your shorty on my meat
No pardon how i speak I’m from the street
Hard for me to be discrete While you sucking like leech

[verse: Napoleon Da Legend]
For some likes on the “Book” like stripper chicks
I make em melt from getting too close to the son (sun) like Icarus
I’m on some different shit building with knowledge wisdom and wealth
Why ask another man if you can just get it yourself… nah mean

[hook: Skeezo & Napoleon Da Legend]
