Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, complexion like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit it while you would've sold to the highest bidder like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute, and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight and letting everybody hit it

Unlike Ally (sometimes she gets bitter)
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her until to this day and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably could've been, if I'd never meet Evie
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, man, find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touching her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds
Little young thing, she liked to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, fronting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her out in Central Park--that's one sign
Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine
She said "you need to stop messing with that white girl
She fucking with your head and got your heart in a tight curl"
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dunce price OT
Plus she from Colombia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, older woman, mature black
Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin towed back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to make up for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on
