[Verse 1: DOOM]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Mother, father, it's my God-given honor
To eat a sucker MC like a hot sizzlin' donna
Respect, deep check, dope line dialectic
Dig the perspective of open minded skeptic
Where your skepticals, looks don't count
Better off judgin' by rhymebooks and sheer amounts
And work backwards from there
Angle of attack on the track was like a spear through the clear air
What's your status? It's Don status
Reserved for those who chose to go beyond madness
Cause we like "Villain you must be out your toboggin' hoggin, it's a horror"
Eatin' MCs like there's no tomorrow, starvin'
Welcome to the club, registration
We be waitin' right here collectin' off of nation's revelations
Sensations for latter day saints
And more lies than blacks splattered, spray paint, faints
Ain't live and direct
And kept his eye on the game like spy tech
Mic check
Villain get booted out your online school
Student got straight up A's in divine rule
Quicker than a sleight of hand, like, damn
Telepathy and telekinesis, faster than Instagram
See what he said, laid his wood, get paid is at
From the States to your in-state flat
Ain't that

[Jneiro Jarel]
Yo
Taking back my style, ey yo, get yours
I've been making beats before you wore drawers
Baby diaper having dudes do your chores
Giving more than what you had in store
Setting up a show and do no tours
My props get weight like them B boys
I don't need your co-sign or rewards
Just need that check to cash to feed my boy
Da-da-da-dey, da-da-da-da-da-dey
Ain't nothing else to say
Can I please collect my pay

Now we talkin
JJ on the beats when I'm spittin'
And hawkin' rhymin'
While I'm reclinin in the vocal booth
Image with the lies, only know how to speak the truth
Never compromise, keep it real
Never peek at you
Rolling through the jungle
Glowing eyes like a kinkajou
Ay my man Dr. Who Dat on the cool
Can I link with you?
Only if you really got G.O.D. in your peripheral
Had a talk with Yasiin bout the world that we livin in
Beginning to the ending, yo
I keeps it Viberian Viberian experience
Until my deliverance can't cut me those step
Man I hide out in the Caribbean
I'm like the ghetto Gilligan
In Planet of the Apes
With nothing but a radio, a mic and a cassette, straight
Pause tape
