[Intro: Dolly Lama]
Yo, picture this, you just get home
From getting shacked off your ass at Ala Moana Bowls
And you remember you got some homework to do
So your headin’ over to the small scale shop
And you got to get hella work done and your all surfed out

[Verse 1: Dolly Lama]
Spark up the torch to anneal the copper
Quench it, pickle it, to make it softer
Made the moon with a hole puncher
Sand it, polish it, to make it shinier
It’s a pack of wolves rappin’ on the moon
The clouds roll through with the mornin’ dew
And their silhouette’s dark as sulfur patina
They’re rhymin’ about spreadin’ the aloha
Turn of the furnace to a thousand degrees
I’m goin’ to forge up a coconut opener
Learned it from John, helpin’ me
We’re twisting up this metal like its rubber
Wire brush this surface, to make it clean
Add gun bluing to prevent rusting
Gave it to D-Rez cause he the homie
Now we can open up coconuts like Wolverine

[Hook: Dolly Lama]
What’s your magic, your surprise, your take on this?
Only you can do it, so whats goin’ to make your different?
