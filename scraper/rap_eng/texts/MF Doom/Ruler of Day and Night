[Intro]
Monstas, come on

[Verse 1]
In these streets, eating and breathing
Believing, keeping these devils bleeding
Leaving these snitches sleeping with the fish-eyed heathens
Stringing them up, now we first stringing like Willie Beamons
Odds and evens, rhyme to reasons
When the spring summer fall, the Earth revolve
Freak of natures like fifth season
One with the ability to speak
Leapt out the womb grown
Prophecies and predictions, full moon blown
On the A-grade New York City skyline
Look like a silhouetted giant tombstone
Eternally marked final resting place of big gold and fools bones
Till that fateful day, we got the next good song
With common-threads, fold the line pharmaceuticals
Mechanics that's irrefutable, immoveable and immutable
Like the three signs of pugilism at the same moment
Both brutal and beautiful, unusual suspects
Cut and combined the divine with the subhuman
Sublime communion, e pluribus unum
Next time find me communicating with Fidel Castro
Went from smoking newports to smoking Cubans

[Hook]
Rodan on ya' mind
He's the ruler of day and night
Up on the moonlight
Under the moonlight
Rodan's so divine
He's the ruler of day and night
Up on the moonlight
Under the moonlight

[Verse 2]
We perform the rites of passage with [?] chemistry
Saying motherfuck in February, put that on the calendar
That ain't black history, learnt the one to ninety-nine
Composition by helping gamble
Representing the best examples of firepower, pearl handle
DJs behind the wheels for the quick getaways
We never clear the sample
De-escalate the scandals, current situation market
Radio pop stars sound alike, looking retarded
Who started this fucking garbage?
Was it the artist, or the greedy faggot-ass corporate office oligarchist?
It ain't fucking hard to tell
Which group's got benefits, extending the bonds?
Which group got members in the millions still starving?
[?] different to that as a [?]
Measuring the distance of a motley crew of perpetrators
That critiqued every sentence
Warden's broken, barely thought provoking
And barely piqued any interest
Keep bohemians caught up in the raps with my urban rhapsody
Masturbation on track, caught feeling myself like pfft
I'mma motherfucking rap so deep, but-

[Hook]
Rodan on ya' mind
He's the ruler of day and night
Up on the moonlight
Under the moonlight
Rodan's so divine
He's the ruler of day and night
Up on the moonlight
Under the moonlights

[Verse 3]
National geographic, passed [?] on the fat rap dancing
Living jungle of asphalt, left his camp plastered
Time to bag up the bad habit like a biohazard
Ashes scattered and buried the headless carcass in a black casket
Match a rap crappy gat master just for a couple of rocks
Told you motherfuckers I ain't playing, I knuckle up a lot
Quick with the blasted block, you faggots really need to stop sucking cock
Free advice from [?], AKA. Doctor love-the-[?]-a-cock
With the audacity to say that Theophany is a classic
With only ten thousand on the first go round
But when a mighty oak tree falls in the forest
And no one is there to see
Does it still make a sound?
By the very nature of the inquisition, question's loaded with tricks
Like which one of these weighs more:
A brick of trees or a pound of bricks?
Prioritise and execute, speed beats strength
And timing beats speed
Map the equation
The right amount of swift force makes for perfect time management
Wise, the story is take heed
Global languages written in bloody hieroglyphics
[?], need talent just to read

[Outro]
Monstas
Come on
