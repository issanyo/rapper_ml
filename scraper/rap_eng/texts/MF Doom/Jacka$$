Gettin somewhat macho
Make a little gold and call myself El Dorado
Got a strong arm like my name was Johnny Bravo
But that could just from all the tawny pr0no
I kill white women and drive a bloody Bronco
It would explain a lot though
The Five-O couldn’t even catch me dippin in Pāhoa
Should switch to a Tahoe, sheriffs be nippin in pronto
They pull up to me like “Sean bro, gettin off in public is a no no”
As if I didn’t know though, I just like to show foes
That I’m like Herman slash Edgar Allen Poe so
I make you clip my grove, and stow you in my stove
And turn you into Meatloaf for all my pretty hoes
It just goes to show that if you don’t get my flow
I’ll serve you like fast food, “is that for here or to go?”

Who the fuck passed you the mic? And said that you could flow?
Point em out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic? And said that you could flow?
Point em out bitch I wanna know

Mixin with zirconium
Can’t say I fuck with the stramonium
But my words come alive like Ben Stiller in the Smithsonian
Get cleansed like a custodian, you know me then, you stupid fools
I sit atop you like a stool, and drop one for extra measure too
I’m not rude I just know that straight edge means I’m better than you
I fear that the years of smoking with the peers has got you unable to steer
Ah fuck it, you only hear what you wanna hear
I’m moving in the fast lane, while you remain a grass stain
I feel like you are you not remembering?
All your actions have got me givin sanctions
Like how your girl’s in my basement, her corpse is becoming ancient
From taking like eight dicks, why you such fake bitch?
I think I’m going spastic and I’m bout to leave ya in a casket
Turn you into plastic and leave you rotting in the attic
I’ve really had it, I’m ready for this shit to be named the next Illmatic
These are just my thoughts when I be fappin
I’m fucked in the head but you can’t deny my tactics
You might be tempted to call me a Jacka$$
But my rappin has got the masses getting real orgasmic

Who the fuck passed you the mic? And said that you could flow?
Point em out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic? And said that you could flow?
Point em out bitch I wanna know

Who the fuck passed you the mic? And said that you could flow?
Point em out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic? And said that you could flow?
Point em out bitch I wanna know
