[PART I: Locked]

[Verse 1]
Jonny Farias, Bronx boy with the ape raps
Sick lyrics of fury like we bringin’ ‘88 back
Wait man, hol’ up, I’m about to spit some straight facts
At the end of the day, the aim is to say what I gotta say
I dominate, the lauded great obligated to demonstrate with every jarring page
The bars are harsh, but major
I charred the paper rehearsing, the hearse is parked in the back
Having thoughts, so now I’m talking some crap
‘Cause I’m the rusty cutlass who ices you on percussion
My punctures nothing but cutting, I rupture any disruption
The one heir, 6’1” with the hair, I come bringing fear
The peerless rarity who stuns every year
Royal status, but I won’t ever live for the accolades
My persona the rap alchemist, not the animes
You walked out your issues, I heard what you had to say
But I was busy trying to jump the barricade
I maul like the Palisades, I ball like I’m Magic
Livid marksman, spit like carbon from the pocket of a gangster
This is residual heat, and I still perform these lyrical feats
Makes you think of what my pinnacle be
Yes, I mastered the art of clobbering to a T
My two lips blossom like a garden, obviously I’m the king
I got the ardor and it harkens back to Eminem 3
The only author who can slaughter putting gems to a beat
My dark pigment, it makes me a nominee for prison
But the bars don’t always sell, I gotta cop a hit to give ‘em
I’m really hoping that these wannabes are kidding
If not, I gotta be vicious, my MO no BS
Dishing the realness, the quill is quick and I grimace at every joke
I’m a psycho ready to explode, need to be contained in a silo
It’s vital I throw ‘em for a spiral once in a while
Saying the project won’t come out, you best quit running your mouths
Spending hundreds of hours on it, right now I gotta go hard
You can’t dodge this challenger, I ain’t talking sports cars
Forgive me, I can't search for purpose in a report card
Rappers and some other students sticking to the flow chart
The Mozart of vocals, Jonny shines brighter than the Northern star
Guiding all these writers to compose their art
Flow so harsh it matches the flood that only Noah’s Ark could manage
I’m off the handles, they have to know that I’m cold as Arctic glaciers
Your gravest mistake is saying I’m not your favorite
I got some words that’ll rock the nation just like a cradle
And I ain’t talking Jay tho
Still I’m ill and my home is the solar system, I was discovered by Galileo
The cadence lava, and I’m hard as volcanoes
I could off an artist quick, don’t make me offer examples
I’ve been alike to Plato since I played with Play-Doh
Everywhere I step is Sarajevo, I leave a region like Waco
I’m more than grateful that I’m able to bring to the table every sentence
Y’all don’t know what I’m equipped with, I’m fatal
Only days until April, time flies like the peregrine
Peculiar child, and yet I’m in my element
Seven kid, the venomous penman that’s known to wreck a diss
Making sure that the message is the prerequisite for forming a song
I speak my piece for no reward, it’s never for the applause
And that’s a warning to all
Couldn’t walk a mile in my shoes, you’d feel off and then fall
And it’s funny because all your lines are corny as cob
Look, your talk is ruger, but your bars are Bueller
They’re nonexistent, you can’t top me, listen I might be the most honest musician you’ve met
I bet y’all never massacred a track at all
I’ll give you something to remember like the Alamo
Reverse my trek, I’m still top level like a palindrome
The gifted in this school need more than talent shows
Though my status low, I look down on the status quo
I let my heart tell tales, Edgar Allan Poe
The rhythm circadian, sustenance for your cranium
Seize a mic, I’m Octavian, trailblazer like Damian
I’m more urbane than Cambridge, every verse baffling
Ever since revealing my rap ability, I’ve been looked at as an alien
Am I supposed to be flattered or feel some type of way?
All I know is that my foes won’t see the light of day
Locked

[PART II: Loaded]

[Verse 2]
A moment of silence for the opponents that died ‘cause the flow is mortal and toxic, yet hopefully inspiring
My devotion to writing is more than a hobby
The outspoken poet is lively, let the chosen demolish, I’m as dope as narcotics
Not a proponent of violence but I’m finna blow like Nevada tests
Letting go of my shyness when I get to ghosting my rivals
Tell the globe that I’m rising, let ‘em know that I’m tired of these hopeless jokes in attire that show off their entire makings
I ain’t faking, y’all pumping up some crazy individuals
For the few that agree, I guess we’re in the same little boat
Honestly dude, it seems obvious too
I’m just confused, where’s the want to improve?
I’m sick and tired, all you trappers are so odd, and it’s stupid how they depend on beats
They’re all green, but I know what they sippin’ on ain’t Lipton tea
To each his own is never an excuse to be a drone
Some of y’all got strong bases, but the weakest songs
This is something I gotta throw light on
Thinking that you’re invincible, but you aren’t like gods
They like, “so I can pop, I’ll say I don’t like Pac”
Oh my gosh, I think you’re losing your mind, bruh
In all honesty, I haven’t heard a line from anybody under twenty-one this past year that’s blown my top
I’d put money on it, but this talent’s all I got
The shows, I rock ‘em, now I gotta get all this off of my chest
Kept it real, and now I’m seen as glorious by y’all
Although I’m really honored, my emotions still are down
Some people marching start to think they’re holier-than-thou
When my stormy ode to melanin could only earn a smile
I may be angry, but in any case, I’m staying truthful
And don’t skew this as being against the movement
But while talk about Stephon Clark was on the macro
I questioned how much people really care ‘bout brown and black folk
Shadows of the past hang over the masses
They ignored us, so gangs grew prevalent, now we used to our morales low
I’m sad at how people act woke, when they’re really blinded
You don’t like my world? Too bad, because you’ve been invited
And I won’t sit in silence, I’m done with being quiet
“Let your voices be heard”, but they don’t wanna see the riots
They’ve given me the stage to render all my rage
But it feels as if I’m screaming in a cave
The echoes envelop me, but it seems things are the same
We never gain, and when in pain, FOX immediately hates, it’s not a game
The media’s insane, I shouldn’t need to hesitate to break that glass ceiling
So I’m not here to merely entertain
I do not exist as just a topic of discussion
If y’all don’t get the messages, my jotting was for nothing
I pray that I don’t submit to the leaders and their evil ways
What’s funny’s that the homeless have been out on the streets for change
But we ain’t fork it over
We’ve been busy trying to find the angle of each other’s sides like it’s SOHCAHTOA
And that’s important too, but some things aren’t red or blue
And I’m not here to tell the truth just because the boy’s supposed to
Naomi Wadler, Emma Gonzalez, God bless you both
The tone brown, and I dream like kids straight from Mexico
Until your ears and eyes open can we amend and grow
That’s how I feel, you know I be trill from head to toe
Yo, I’m on a tier I haven’t been before
The boy’s so solid, you can hear the passion in the flow
I’m not sorry for my anger, being passive takes its toll
I was lavish with my fabrics while the Klansman changed his clothes
The aggravated, agitated, maybe hated, underrated, underestimated kid who’s breaking limitations
Hopefully I’m triggering some sort of conversation in this testament to systemic segregation
And this is cabaret night, I don’t play right, lines like a playwright’s
High up in the sky, but my rhymes staying airtight
Blood on the paper so you can feel what the pain like
Try to expose me, I will burn you with that same light
Sorry to the beat because I kill it often
If that was the summary, then this the doctrine
Easier to rhyme, but harder to rap
Until you guys can understand that, I'll be top of the ranks
