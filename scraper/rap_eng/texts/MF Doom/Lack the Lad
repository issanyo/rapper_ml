[Verse 1]
Why you doing dabs
Or taken drag
That reminds me
As a child i was a brat
I had a tattoo on my ass
They like the laugh
I could jump it's ok leave me in the back
I wanna stop feeling so numb
Penicillin feel good
Filled up the dood now I'm the new villain
Sealed in a hit
I'm a heathen
Civilized looking all from the outside

My fat lips kissing her neck slow
She love that shit and she told me so
She keep me tied up with a lasso
At times she make me feel bad like an asshole
Or the devil on her shoulder
Blades trying to kill her halo
I remember when I was there she couldn't say no
Wanting to do me how could I say no
Gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
Can't believe how many conversations I kept up with her
Over coffee and cigarettes, a beer and cigarettes
Fuck
Now all I want is a cigarette just to remind me of her instance
Bitch don't kill my vibe
When i'm barely alive I feel like dying inside
Sky is falling and you keep calling
I can't deal with this shit right now

[Hook]
Jimmy isn't best on his back
He finds it hard when he can't relax
He keeps running for head back
Yes, jimmy isn't the best on his back
Jenny isn't best on her back
She keeps heading for going back
She finds it hard when she can't relax
Jenny isn't best on her back

Would you like that x 15
Would you like thaaaaaaat

[Verse 2]
Give me the mic cause it's all to the next
But nothing in this life is guaranteed like sex
And I would like to fuck you now
I never would shun you or dug you
Like so many others would
I'm packing up everything I own
I don't own anything
I'll leave it all behind me
You should hear the news outside manoose?
Doing what I choose that's what I was born to do
And hindsight, high life feel like a low life
Got nothing to lose I got to improve
Gotta make due didn't pay my dues
I didn't even pay my debts
Find me on the back of your milk
Carton cause I'm a missing child
That's why I live a mild climate
I won't stop till I climax but I keep holding it back

I'm a low life professor never could I confess
A readers digest
My reasons: Well I had to do what I do
So what they put me in a box of robots
And botox clorox hydroxy cotton tube socks
I go off I give off a lot of semen
I be the scene
Awkward, Last word, Hers was a son of a shotgun
Sirens arrive, keep quiet, fuck that
