[Verse 1: Sage]
Lee spiked my drink
Sink like water drown drained
Twist and tap i dont give a damn
When he regins they're poor
Inundated by tears see you sore
Out of wack wack you out
Can't handle bass of subconscience
Tremble to the treble
Like malcom is the middle
Lost is the world and im in it
You got a pool of thoughts
Though dont know how to swim in it
I stroke to progress
You stroke through nervousness
I congress
You vote out of fear
My ear pierced by the sound like a diamond in it
My pitch black so my ideas blinded
The light shines out of common sense,
This makes me reflect
My reflex is paper not currency
Write like it's wrong
Thats my mean so i dont interact like that socially
Thats my mean but far from average,
A place to find solace
So lace tracks for cultures to cruise not race

[Verse 2: Sage]
Pace it doesn't mean a thang
We move at the same equality
Beard stroke in your pool of thoughts,
And i come out the other side the same
Just more wisdom attained
That's what i do got grey patches,
In a metaphoric sense i got dollars and sense
Pounds pence hence
I don't want to deprive you of my charity
In dark places u can do with enlightening
In dim shit gets romantic candle burning
Sense that my desire I'm yearning
