[Verse 1: B-Primitive]
Maaaan
I don't read books, I write em
I'm digging to the minds of the youth, override 'em
Mackin' 20 pesos in my pocket just to buy an item
Cheap comes quick but that wasn't the ultimatum
We made 'em, doing dirty by never trying to face 'em
Case one, too quick to face blunts
Never wanna face us, on the hunt for rap quasar
Piping metal tea kettle taken right to the taste buds
Mellow yellow settles, leaking on a teacher's desk
'Til the mellow yellow fellow's weak enough to cut the check
Weak enough just for a sec, lacerations for the neck
Generating granulation and the D's for hit the deck
Then we wreck it, rebuild and wreck it again
Foster imposter fixing up his posture again
Chiro practicing his soccer just to pay off his rent
Accenting his ascension like it was a blessed event

[Verse 2: James the Keeper]
Who, where, or what not written
Bleecker street sittin'
Speakers keep shittin'
Scholar tip, feed em out the mouth
With the vomit spit
I'm residing in the crater where the comet sit
I'm Poseidon riding waves until the honor student
Blazes with the congress woman
Jaded over politics
Placing bets until I'm placed above the collegiate
Face to face with mace
And my vision is still astonishing
Ain't another face inside a room of other faces
I'm far beyond the room inside the world
Inside the spaces
Starships to spaceships
Hardships to facelifts
To understand the planet is not the same
As to embrace it
We feel the music like messiah in a synagogue
The rhythm lucid like Elijah in a winter storm
Bloody mary to colada in the renaissance
We saw it coming, my becoming ruined innocence
We're making until Harlem is upper echelons
Lower Class representative, president of the iller cause

[Verse 3: B-Primitve]
A loss for words, across the cross I go
Sauce the mass and toss the caps
I write the raps alone
Achille killing kobe, so be ready for the stones
And the lonely one who told me to be ready for the lows
Crack 'em in the nose and get ready for the senses
Relax and kick back for me and my consensus
Nitro, psilocybin, too much for me to mention momma
Ima change the world with my stupendous intervention
