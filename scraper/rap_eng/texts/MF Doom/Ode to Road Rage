....Yolk em, leave 'em with his feet danglin
Got his degree in stranglin and street hagglin
You could find 'em on the beat braggin
Then discreetly draggin emcees towards the meat wagon
And they chicks to the bang bus
Make 'em kick and slang cuss
To Vik is no dang fuss
He sense a trickle of lingering hate
But refuses to get tickled by the fickle finger of fate
..Fuck dat nigga
Vik, in it for the buck by the giga
A short truck ride to the liquor store to refuel
Rookie at the counter, manager told 'em "he cool"
Walk, tellin ya hard luck story
Or else that's gonna leave a scar, yuck gory
And we're outtie, peewwmm!
V and his rowdy crew
You could see how loud he blew
And now that's a fine howdy doo
Sperrrrrrr! Stay in your lane!
Keep drivin straight or catch a stray in ya brain
Go deep divin off the side of the bridge off a slide and a skid
Who wanna ride with the kid?

....Tryin to live to see old age
So he roll wit the loaded gauge
Ode to road rage.. (Road rage)
Better get up off his bumper
Before he get dumber and let off the thumper
Yeah take the next exit
Catch 'em on the back street, clack the heat but forget it
That's one less buttface
News lady said they found coke, open and shut case
They convinced it's drug related
V skated off in the ugly buggy faded
After that last turn
Seen an old man crash and burn
They have to place his ashes in an urn
In return the world is a safer place to race
Just don't invade his personal space
..Worst case scenario
Place your back away from the bass that's in the stereo
Insurance can't bring you back to life
From a pissy drunk driver when a big rig jack knife
Sclerrrrrr! Stay in your lane!
Keep drivin straight or catch a stray in ya brain
Go deep divin off the side of the bridge off a slide and a skid
Who wanna ride with the kid?
