I'm a problematic adolescent, smart but I never listen
Not going to fall like physics, cause my mouth spits mystic
Working at this since 3rd grade, to pay off stuff with wordplay
But hey, I did better in the past life, people thought I was the reincarnation of Christ
They wore my country's color which was nice, and all had to bring was water no glass no ice
But now I'm living in times where people rather commit crimes, and do some time, than be employed which means their in the back of the line
Some people spend their life rapping and get mad, cause their broke now and use rapping as a party gag
But that's what you get for thinking without a plan b, you think I'm a hypocrite but I have plans from a to AZ
I rather call my dreams faith, and faith call belief, but if belief is a dream then what is this circle that we don't need

[Hook]
Life lessons learned over here in 48th street, philosophy and showing niggas not to gank me (x2)

[Verse 2]
Praise the shaman on your block, he probably looks like the one whose smoking some rock
But you must of forgot, philosophers don't get the check
So don't disrespect his set of guilded wood on his neck
And give a shout out or two to the og's intelligence, giving exact way to get dead presidents
Without selling crack, dope, cocaine, by getting a good job that doesn't require pain
You can settle down now with your baby mama, with no drama, and knowing you coming home with commas
Homies way trying to get famous isn't going his way, his mom said just pray and say gods great
But there's an eviction notice cause the rent was late, now homie is thinking that gods passing faith
If you want to think differently than look this way, I don't believe this but it was made
Science say we came from outer space across so far, so thinking about it we were all born stars
Truth is we're tested in the struggle, to see whose coming up and whose stuck in the rubble
I'm focused to my future reality like Hubble, trying my best to stay out of trouble
Because once I'm in I'm going off like a shuttle, meaning I'm not coming back just to be subtle
And also Kaleb I.A. has been dope since the cretaceous, proving to kings, Pharaohs, and emperors that they ain't shit
Neither am I but I'm trying to, right now I'm that gastric acid after you eat food
Might come back from where I began, but to free has been the plan
Taking out rap zombies since 04 man
