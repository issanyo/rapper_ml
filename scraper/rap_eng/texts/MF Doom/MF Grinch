[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Jumping to a conclusion, could stunt your evolution
Like the trees, dumped into some dust, blunt fusion
Old cocktail of mine, chemicals derail time
It's all good, as long's he ain't inhaling swine
Dare decline, scared money makes none
Take one, you should've flushed before the jakes come
Oh shart, specialty is flow art
Smart, but go in circles like a go-kart
Yeah, don't start, make 'em have to finish
Just bounce like gold-diggers
Once the dough diminish
Phony, it gets lonely at the finish (yup)
You see some deal dope, others steal hope
What's revealed is of a certain feel - grope
Yellow moist mushy, banana peeled coke
At worst, could not be confused with real soap
Nope, you see disaster is intended
In the face of truth, don't ever be offended
Overstand the past to get a grasp of the present (psst)
I make it faster than you spend it
End it

[Sample]
You're a mean one mister Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch, you're a bad banana with a greasy black peel
