[Intro – Horson Wells]
Ha,ha,ha! That’s a good one, That’s a good one, one for the good guy
Thank you,thank you for coming back with us
My name is Horson Wells from Global News and we’re sitting here with Mr. 20/20 of our sister station Galactic Network
Now Mr. 20,what do you know of this man they call John Robinson?

20/20:
A..nothing much but I can tell you this
Listen,just listen to me

[Verse 1]:
March like a elegant elephant
Over  Mount Everest, all the beef is settled like a veteran
Bruce Lee roared The last dragon
Usually the truth’s decoy is the backstabbing
Just imagine, grabbing the mic like a primate Silverback
I’m lactose intolerant you’re Sipping on similac
Minds with more punch than Hawaii juicy red
I keep it ghetto like quicker oatmeal and Wonder Bread
Shook mcs are scared to look under the bed
Claim that they’re super fly, but Freddy is dead
Ah..this just in, 20/20 seen Plenty, plenty
Your brain will burst
From one thought from my memory
My style’s your enemy
And I will not stop busting till I’m empty-empty
Behind the cameras where the action happens
Deep in the war zone, the chemical ashes

[Verse 2]:
Confident strut with his head up high, hell of a guy
Stealth movements miss stroll like FBI
Educated young man who spoke with elegance
Made well for his family stories that was tell of ‘em
Relevant to what unfolds come vocal tones
As he spoke to the world
One at a time in the room or alone
Heard his phone but he wouldn’t answer
101 was with a dancer from LA and New York
Cause Ma Dukes suffers from cancer, see
Never plan to tickle her fancy or nuttin’
Usually end up written with Auntie and frontin and care for this youngin
A little more than platonic friends, spends limitless ends
Will it ever end? Who knows? It depends
Gems are caught blindly
Insecure inside he, doesn't know how to express true love without buying things
Dying dreams is reality for too long
Trying to save his soul before his essence is gone
He’s invisible


[Outro- Horson Wells]
Well, we didn’t get to see him
