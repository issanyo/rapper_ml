[Verse 1 : Erykah Badu]
Oh my my my I'm feeling high
My moneys gone, I'm all alone
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day
Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned
If your knowledge were your wealth then it would be well earned
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same

[Hook]
Oh on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
All night till the break of dawn
I go on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh on and on and on and on
Goddammit I'mma sing my song

[Verse 2 : Erykah Badu]
I was born under water
With three dollars and six dimes
Yeah you might laugh cause you did not do your math
Like one, two, three
Damn, yall feel that
Like one, two, three
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day
The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same

[Verse 3 : Erykah Badu]
I am feeling kinda hungry cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours cause your food does not endure
I think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burning
Oh what a day, what a day what a day
You rush into destruction cause you don't have nothing left
The mothership can't save you so your ass is gon get left
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same

[Chorus]
Oh on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
All night till the break of dawn
I go on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
Mad props to the God JaBorn
