I shine with fine hymn's, can't out rhyme him
Don't mind them, they waste my time with whack men's
No sim, dismantle em, rambling
I been cause ruckus ever since I was with, Hamblin
Rappers need handling, before I strangle them
Spitting yada yada, only beats should have the samples in
Look at him, like, "Damn who walked in"
Hop along kid, get on the DeLaNoise, band wagon
Clothes smelly, like "Whoa nelly", something loud?
Pass it around, digging the sound?
Confound, astound, I know no bounds
Look around town, nobody chuckles at this clown
Bozo's let go, ain't fucking with my set though
Middle of snow I'm hot as fuck, sweating molly ho
Flows like Navajo's, im spitting thoughs
Catch a show, foes see microphones and elbows
What an ass hole, only spit lactose
All natural, you cats just intolerant
Make a broke nigga ask where his dollar went?
Have a little kid, asking where his momma went?
Don't make me repeat myself
Buddy, dis my set, I'm a danger to your health
Crew's stomping on the daily
Basis giving niggas face lifts from off the fucking pavement
