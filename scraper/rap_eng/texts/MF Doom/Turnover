I might be going insane
I think I'm lame
But my crippling depression says I'm great
Okay man
Bake me a cake
Fill it with whiskey,  pills
Pieces of some broken glass windows
For a little pain
From a shard or pane
Game can be arranged
If your bitch would be my queen
Sex could be her breakfast
My dick could be her Jimmy Dean
Peep my mean lean -ing
On this corner block square
Lookin' at these fucks like "don't come 'round here"
Pass a beer deer
I'm a hunter tryna kill some scummy rougher uppers
Money couldn't buy me out just put me in a nice house
So it won't bother you
Or sucker punch you my dude
But if this beef is serious I'll ostracize you
Til your head gone delirious
I'm merely sitting, searching for some meaning
I'm drinking up the Merlin magic
Why you faggots sit and eating
Money tone phone
Won't get you floating up
On the upper echelon, play my song
And I threw up
Cuz it's weird for it to go the other way down my system
Eyes stuck in visions
Demons and Angels
Fighting while God debated suicide
And zombies on their horses
Riding to the end of days
Nobody says the truth is crazy
My mind makes manifesting lazy
Behind me is seven billion people, waiting
Seph is for the cause
The clause is about over
I eat the bad fruit only in a Turnover
Maybe I'll turnover
To the other side
I'm just waiting here
Looking for a sign
