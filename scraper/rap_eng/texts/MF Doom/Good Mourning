CAPTAIN SUN -
Its like 4 in the morning, and im mourning
About what used to make my feel heart warmer
Than a sun burning , 4 years torn in, i forfeit
With these cold tears, warning
Love is a war and , itll scourn and torture ya
If you dont come fourth with bravery then you won't make the cut
Now im accompanied with indica
Watching memories like a cinema
Filling voids with the orchestras
Affiliated with the orbit of
Our love
Pulled me out of darkness cuz of her
Heroine from the gods and the universe

Our love is disolving we've got a problem
There ain't no solving to be honest i like me up in
The solace

ARNICA -
You are the poison and the cure baby
So tainted but so pure baby
If life was just like a movie
We could try it again
Give me hot some past love
I could not get enough
Love is one hell of a drug
Youre the reason why im dying slow

Asking me what happened
As if you didn't stick the knife in

Ouoouuu ouuuu uouuou ouuu
