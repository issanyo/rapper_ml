[Verse 1]
You never know it might be better than yesterday
Yeah, the last word you hear a Wall Street investor say
That’s the way the ball bounces off the asphalt
He hit the concrete and came to a fast halt
It could really hurt your brain
Was it worth the pain, ask Milli or Kurt Cobain
What profit the man who gain the whole world
Just to lose his soul, plus his main ol’ girl?
Sounds slick, he wrote it with a Bic Round Stic
Tie a brick around his neck so he drown quick
Prick… the tricks the Villain plays
For kicks make a killin’ like ‘Six Million Ways…’
A four pound, Tec or shotty
Turned the party out, bound to wreck your body
Til the soul’s gone, he keep an old born
That make more noise than a gold horn, hold on

[Verse 2]
Whats the score? Still slaughter, such a bore
Whoever want some water, come in and shut the door
There’s too much to live for
Got more, give to the poor
I’m abso-tutely positively sure
Put the raw in the wind like missiles
A lotta wack beats bring the gin like whistles
Shot the black heat, sting the skin to the gristle
Got the back seat to the kingpin, sizzle
Fire burn, it’s not none of my concern
Villain for hire for those who wanna try and learn
From the clever, wise brother who’s forever in disguise
Don’t be surprised when he sever ties
He never lies like Doctor Doom
Trust me, he keep it musty like a guys' locker room
Trying to find out who stole the roll on
And make moves like a bold pawn, hold on
