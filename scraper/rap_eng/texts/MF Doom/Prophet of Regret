Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(Mhm... uh)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(This is... This is, this is)
Bran... brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(Brrr this is, this is... yeah )
Yo.... C'mon

[Verse 1: Black Fin]

Realizing everything getting real
Effecting the righteous energy gathering rust
Even trust rescinds
Epiphanies get reckless, edge-less
Talking radical ends gradual
Remember Easter time? Rapping Epistles?
Grimy raps, exposing the rational evil gods rebuke
Emphasizing the revenue
Everybody gotta repay
Empty today, rarely entertaining good rhymes
Enterprise time, roll economically growing
Roughly expect ten racks every go-between. (ha)
Rigidly extreme to remember
Eating glamorously rocking every touch
Royal exhibit getting rough, every Thursday
Really everyday! gotta repeat
Emphasizing the raw effort
Gotta relish every tidbit
Ripping egos, group repo, euthanize the rhymes
Extroverted guy round every thick red ebony goon, rigid
Especially, talking review
Every game replay, extra time recalling each grimy rhymey episode
Telescoping, roladexing, etching grandiosely, rosy
Eating the roasty, exceed grossly
Rudimentary enamored to really exciting grammar
Riding eloquently too
Right exit go revving enter through rude
Easily God
Relaxed even talking
Rocking Ebonics, grooving robotic
Entering the ring enthusiastically, get ready
Eventually Tunnybuny running every geographically registered encampment
Then reminiscing, everything glistening right
Every twinkle ringing
Egad good riddance, exquisitely,  typically
Fin
