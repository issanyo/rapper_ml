Maybe we're just too young
Or just maybe I'm not as fun
As i thought
When you closed your eyes
Then you shot
And you hit my heart
And you shocked me
I saw a spark
You turn the green into dark
You packed your flowers in bowls
And packed your beauty in my art
How could i even pretend to pretense
You know you still do
Its the first step
To letting go of letting go of you
So now I'm sitting here
Thank You,No Thank You
I'm fine thank you
I'm fine with you leaving your scarf
And never coming back for it
Just run and run please never come back Forrest
I saw your game
I was screaming please like me
I'm human too
Or am i too human too pursue you
I'm vulnerable
With my heart on my sleeve
Your too sleezy to see
You're not easy to please
Just not easy for me
So just
Likey like me
Lovey dovey
Trust me hug me
Fuck me
Just me
And we'll be fine
Hopefully
Hold me tight
Rosary
Open mic
Open seat
Holy grail
Holy please
Holy shit
You're what i'm looking for
We cuddle under stars
And watch cartoons
Your favorite ones
We can adventure
Venture out anytime you like
You can ride
You dont even need a bike
Or a home
Just us
