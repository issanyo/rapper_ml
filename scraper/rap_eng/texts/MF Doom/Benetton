[MC Serch]
Long time coming huh Jorge?
I gotchu. Hip-Hop to the death
Let me tell my story
[Verse 1: MC Serch]
I'm the blood from the stone
And that stone is Far Rock
Home is off Virginia near Cornega and Mott
We brought kicks from sneaker steez
White tees with creased sleeves
To make dough we shoveled snow
In the fall we'd break leaves
Then my pen took its path
And I began writing my raps
I was kicking it with females
In biker shorts and gold caps
And Ebony and Mahogany
Bring em home to meet my family
And when the heads around the way saw me
They started dogging me
Talking all reckless trynna knock my success
Better to climb them stairs instead of project steps
See my people in Far Rockaway never seen me more than a block away
And when your crew need you
How you gonna say no not today?
So I got caught between a Rock and hard place
But never last place
And then we came up with the "Gas Face"
KMD Zev Love X Subroc R.I.P
We'd get dissed by chicks and this is the face they gave me
We'd drive back to Long Beach with my tank on empty
And my my bank on empty
I had a quarter for a loosey
The Newport I inhaled and exhaled through my nose
Dusting the cigarette ash from my clothes then I rose
Planning to never be in the same place ever again
Being broke was my people but it was never my friend
But my love will never die
I am what I supply
See I am Hip-Hop music and I use it to get by
And this culture accepted me for the skin that was on me
And then came "Step into the A.M." and the "Cactus" CD
And it put me on the course that you see me on today
And truth be told I would have it no other way
That's why I say it's not a game
[Kurious]
Hey yo' Serch
I appreciate you coming through
Good looking out yo', y'all used to let me get on stage with you
Pop goes the weasel
So hot that I'm diesel
Nowadays I couldn't paint this picture better on a easel
But back then I didn't know what was truly the prize
Soon after I'm on tour with Fugees and Nas
Such a great honor I wasn't ready
I was late pana
My whole shit pause like a straight comma
I had to search within
Take the wrong make it right
Mend my broken wings
So once again I take flight
Now I'm free as the wind
Don't know where to begin
I gather my thought's every time I breath in
Believe in self
Give thanks to where it's supposed to go
Lord knows my beloved
I'm supposed to flow
Don't get a twist between that rap and that street shit
Stay on the humble
But never on no weak shit
Those thinkin' otherwise can buckle down and eat dick
Get your money, buy a ticket, come see me spit
Kurious Jorge
See the name in lights
Incredible how 20/20 be the hindsight
[HOOK:Kadi]
Get your rhymes right
Get your minds right
This that big purse heavyweight prize fight
Get your life right (Money)
Get your life right
This that big purse heavyweight prize fight
[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Persistence always overcomes resistance
Is the words of Mr. Magic
Not to be confused with the magican, hat tricks
Out the bag, look at what the cat done drug in cousin
If you don't know, you buggin
There's about to be muggin
My brova Jorge is here
Swords is clear as I pour beer for years
More to share, Cheers
It's good to see you back boss
Game ain't changed since the Crack to Iraq wars
Villian, droolin still share his last snack bar
Feeding these chirrens with the knack off
The black tarts
Swervin' double lines bubble lines been through
Nerve to beat the odds when they against you with a pencil
It's all in the mental OOOOH saw what he said?
Metal Face DOOM open doors with his forehead
*click* Call it hands-free wireless
The burnout plan and the fans be tireless
Turns out there's no bluff
Pump you punks but kiss the DOOM Dunks like Sho'Nuff
The bottom, pond scum, swallow some
To the T-O-P
Left for Harlem, what the problem is? Fondel'em
