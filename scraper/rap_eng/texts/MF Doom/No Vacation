[Intro]

[Hook: C.I.A. $EI]
Grind Hard No Vacation
Grind Hard No Vacation
Grind Hard No Vacation

[Verse 1: C.I.A. $EI]
Grind Hard No Vacation
Even when I'm sleeping I be lacin'
Down tracks so I can get a payment
From a label that's making at least a million dollar statement
I ain't never been a nigga who liked waiting
No patience
When it comes to these girls it's no placement
For a ring on the finger or cuffs on the wrist
Dont wanna see yo face unless it's in front of my dick
Shxt that's kinda harsh
But no Disney this Kingdom has no hearts
That's how it is when you chasing bread dark to dark
Thats the reason why my Cash stackin' my numbers in dollars
Starting to look like my numbers in followers
You can always catch me with the bad bitches like Oliver
Im from the garden son
Where niggas be wild as fuck
Make a wet t-shirts contest out of a pedestrian
But shit I reside in Georgia
But I ain't leave the north cause we on top of Florida
Sir Louie the last king fuck a coroner
Catch me on the corner
With a black in my ear chuggin an Arizona
Youngin tryna get paid yall tryna get a diploma

[Skit]

[Hook: C.I.A. $EI]
Grind Hard No Vacation
Grind Hard No Vacation
Grind Hard No Vacation

[Verse 2: C.I.A. $EI]
$EI back in this bitch like new growth
XL OG$ CIA No joke ho
Money tall like Tebow
Eyeing my girl but you can't hit like shaq at the free throw
But yo bitch just left my spot
Now I'm pulling up no volvo
Now I'm rollin up but I'm dolo
Purple kush got me taking off like Flo-Jo
Lights flash when I'm come threw but we ain't taking no photo
That electrifying like Dwayne
And I'm here to change the game
But C.I.A. be my name
And it be the gang
And Got another hit under my name
Last Ash of the Roc this be the house of flames
Come to the steeze nothing change
Even if we was naked you couldn't be the freshest in the game
Switchin up yo flow x style still can't compeite with my campaign
Brock lesnar to you niggas Here Comes The Pain
Brock Lesnar to you niggas, uh here comes the pain

[Outro]
