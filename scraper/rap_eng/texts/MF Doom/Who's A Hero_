[Audio Sample:]
The final battle has not been fought!
The fruits of victory shall be mine!

[Verse 1: Trunks]
Kill the noise with a skull on his chest
Call him the punisher
War machine like Iron Man
I'm warning ya
He's a beast
Just here to bring apocalypse
Fools call him The Thing
The way that he be rocking this
Burn ants as hot as the Human Torch
Came with their team, they all lost
? your X-Force
Next course of action
Red skulls from bashing
Him, her, them, and they crew
In that fashion
Concrete corner Galactus
Except I don't crush worlds
I crush girls that work at Saks Fifth
Avenue, haven't you heard?
I'm inhuman like Blackbolt
I crack frames by speaking in word
Challenger rapidly burned
Now you got an eye patch like Nick Fury
Just for having the nerve
No justice in the league
In a flash, you'll surrender
And ya'll ain't got talent for the West Coast Avengers
We heat, set flame to the street like Ghost Rider
With no lighter, you Peter Parker minus the spider:
Useless! Ruthless! What did you expect?
I'm danger like Gambit playing with a full deck
Daredevil, I show skill at a rare level
Archangel, my heart's mangled and won't settle
To be, less than the juggernaut
Stomping through your danger room
Rocking a metal plate on my face like Doc Doom
How soon before savage dragons'll roar?
And we even the score for all of the secret wars
That ya'll missed?
I wish this crisis had hope
I ain't a joker but this is the killing joke
The last comic standing
Pause with the wet works
Sin city, watch men do dirt
A savage land where the titans ain't teens
And they 10 times quicker than Quicksilver at top speed
To pull a weapon X and unplug your cable
Assassination plot, McFarlane at a table
With an iron fist
Venom in this pen
I write another graphic novel
Blacker than the dark night
A harder fight than the war within and can't pretend
That this is where the story ends
I hate to send the vision
Another image than I came with
Now who's a hero?
I'm a villain with a statement

[Spoken sample:]
Now who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Now who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Who's a hero?
Now who's a hero?

[Audio Samples:]
He's still dangerous!
He is unscathed! He freed himself with ease in seconds!
What's wrong with me?
