[I Self Devine]
Poisonous attack cancer black lung
Nigga with forked tongue is lynch hung
Insufficient funds (?)
Sure to a blank strike individual
I'm goin all out for self shyst when it's critical

[MF DOOM]
Word and it don't make no kind of sense
Dudes walkin round here staring all intense
Yeah, well look at how the gods done gone crazy
With edge ups gone like Jefferey Osborne baby

[I Self Devine]
Consecutive blunts my chest leather like moccasins
Infinite sin dealin with toxins of noxious deluxe
Extra (?) ill enough for three villains
With weed fetish, black (?) and keep buildin

[MF DOOM]
It's all gravy get crackin or get packin
Passin for flows before the age of Jet Jackson
Bet action it ain't no camera
They can get (?) like they stamina is amateur

[Hook]
The mind pull the strings while the body does the dance
And the dream fully awake walkin on stolen land
The mind pull the strings while the body do the dance
And the dream fully awake walkin on stolen lands

[MF DOOM]
Psst you, yeah you, come here keep it low, I see you not from here
Welcome to hell son, you might wanna wear your bum gear
Also here to let you know the mic is dumb clear
Then you disappear, so quiet you can hear turd fall
Just when you thought you heard it all, bird call
They think they so slick, up to they old tricks
Sendin the little dude, grimey with the old kicks
He on some old "oh those shits is hot, what size is those? Lemme try em on!"
Rob you blind like ya eyes closed
Nine other foes on the corner I suppose
Personal space (?) his nose
I need to find I Self to split these jingles
Still while we wait to dry these counterfeit singles
With more rhymes than any time is DOOM senses tingle
Those who got the nuts too bound to get the spinkles
While we, is more vivid than digital TV
All live, feel me like burgundy DVD
Eat 'em like mango, follow how the slang go
It's like a flurry, now who bloody on my furry Kangol?

[Hook]
The mind pulls the strings while the body does the dance
And the dream fully awake walkin on stolen land
The mind pulls the strings while the body do the dance
And the dream fully awake walkin on swollen glands

[I Self Devine]
At eleven years old I sold my soul to the devil for kicks
(?) white kids buildin wood crucifixes three sixes shit ain't no joke
Reverse the mission seen reflection in the mirror
Foreign objects, government projects, after school program pay cut, boycott
Single parent kids in the street half dead flesh rot
I lack internal discipline, play you how you play yourself
Thievery stealth, fiendin for wealth plus a meal ticket
Blood in my hand I feel wicked, hell's dwindlin
Live by the minute within the second said trippin
Fake gods with bad lessons
Todays mathematics is acceptance, dont question shit
Muslims call me athiest
I can't wait to leave this planet behind me
(I thought by now that you)
You would recognize the battleground
Agile, step in razor walkin on a high wire
Risk taker out in the cold with slit wrist makin
Balled fists terrorists threats
To paper machete marionettes
Machete kept, I'm very tense
It don't make sense, fuck a black cloud it's black tint on my lens
Stolen grey Tims
Swollen face
Blazin
