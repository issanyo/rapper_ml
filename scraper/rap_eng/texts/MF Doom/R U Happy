Yeah
Check
Yo
Yeah

Listen to you talk
I don't believe any of your words
It seems so hard to figure out if its pride that sore
Well I am pretty sure it is dog
Pretty sure it won't go away

Stay here forever
Or until you feel better

Could you tell me what I am running from
Could you tell me what I am running towards
Could you tell me why whenever i'm a front there's a locked door
Dirty clothes on my floor
I Woke up its another day
Gray skies out my window
It was open and I shut it
Its so cold in here
Like my feet are in ice rusty bucket
No moisture in the air
My throats dry like Sahara
What did i do last night
Tried to fuck a broad named Sarah
Hair all in my mouth
She wouldn't go down-are you happy?

Yes I am
Are you happy?
Yes I am
Are you happy?

Oooh ooo
Are you happy?
