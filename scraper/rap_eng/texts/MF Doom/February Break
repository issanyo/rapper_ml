(Verse 1, Polo)
Check, and you know we gonna make it
Wolf told me bark
So you know we gonna take it
But fuck it I'm complacent
My niggas adjacent
And if the Jakes get to chasing the forest is where we're staying
Ooh lit
And they talking shit for no reason
E-Coli virus that you teething like you fucking fiending
Crack fiending my brother had crack demons
I crack your egg nog in its the holiday season
Motherfucker I'm a motherfucking fucking demon
But if this bitch regurgitate
My motherfucking semen
I'm patting her on the back
I still can't hop off these tracks
I'm trucking through beats AP
Retiring a running pack
A punchline
I'm all about mine like a narcissist
Not a narcotraficante
But 9-5 won't trap the kid
Smhoove
And if these tracks go loco
My motive is a logo
And music that goes global

(Verse 2, FlyGuyWolf)

Its Wolf, Money
The weeds lit
Got my niggas in the backseat, sorta flashy
I'm to the goal, no Lassie
No ashy hoes in my circle
Get hoes like Urkel [?]
Still put in that work though
On my work flow, making history
Call these other rappers Holmes
They a mystery
On my own shit, motherfuck the industry
And I ain't never quitting 98 until infinity
I ain't caking, but I ain't faking
When I say that I been slaying, leaving hoes in amazement
Hoes couldn't take it, foes couldn't touch it
Hoes say they loving my kicks, tell them its nothing
Fuck with the rhyme that I spit
Drop a few dimes on a bitch
Spit on the yime that I hit
Shit, I'm bluffing
All in all I'm just trying to hit the mall
And cop a couple KD's
Cause I'm just tryna ball

(Verse 3, Polo)

Yo, shoutout MF DOOM dawg, that's my dad
Want more?

I feel like there's a million things to talk about
If I don't like it I thought it out, then toss it out
I feel like unk when I walk it out
And the beat stomp the yard when I stomp it out
Polo can't rap? whats you talking about
Sometimes I don't see the light like a brownout
Sometimes I don't feel safe to be brown out
Sometimes I think my verses won't make it off soundcloud
Ooh
But then again we could go viral
And these vinyls could be vital to mankind's survival
Yo this is history in the making take a photo
Vocals climbing up your torso, Polo going global
