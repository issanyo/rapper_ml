[Verse 1: Donnie Trumpet]
I don't really write anymore
Don't have time for words, I guess
So I let notes speak for me
I vocally admire the trumpet every time I let my vocal chords vibrate half as beautifully as she could
She, can sing
Together, we swing
Like big bands we flap to our own music
Muses would be jealous of our love
We sing
Colors evaporate from within her
We spray paint canvases of crowds
Leaving our colorful remains on stage, splattered and cluttered
Where she left my heart fluttered and flushed
Where I once was cold she left covered in blush
Between her solid golden frame
We, are breathtaking
You, take my breath
And make our voice
You show me your mind, and I show you mine
And together we share our love between the sheets of ledger lines
Where we recline into spaces, we sing
I push her buttons, grip her body gently
Our lips vibrate when we touch
She's not afraid to get loud but stay sensitive
Time slips through cracks in my daily routine like open shoelaces, but
Every time we cry together it renews my strength
Your braces hold me in heavenly places
Where you are a blessing
I finally have faith

[Hook (in Spanish): Donnie Trumpet]
Mi aire, mi cielo, mi fantasia
Nadie ame esperanza como ella
Mi vida
Musica, mi vida
Musica, mi vida
Musica, mi vida
Musica, musica

[Verse 2: Malcolm London]
See, Spanish ain't my thing
But this language speaks to bodies gyrating to the vibrations of my voice like bait
I'll string you along on the reel
But baby, I got you hooked
Baby now you're drowning from the pounding
These speakers blasting from the sound of God in between your lips
Speak to me
Your flow, I swoop you off
Coughing up lungs, over your volume
When Mary Jane enters the room, don't be jealous
I'm here
Here, like a pair of ears
To listen to you
Music, acoustic, losing it
Sore losing it
Kid growing up these days to put their backs into elbows
To throwing hands to hard times
You string me along on the reel
Keeping me afloat
Keeping me wrapped up in coats
To shield me from these cold city streets
Headphones calling me from reality, casually
Casualties, in Chicago, in Chicago, Chi-ca-go
It seems to mines, save 'em
Save music, save money, save mine
