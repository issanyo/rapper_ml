Oh fuck, here we go
Bust a nut inside the stereo
Another whack rapper huh?
This shit is timeless
I can see you rolling your iris
And the size of the shit's ginormous
Look back I did some dumb shit
Who did it
My ass was kissing somebody else's
Just trying to get through, now

Shake
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Shake
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Shake
(who cares who cares nana nana)
I'm just tryna get through just tryna get through
Shake
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Shake
(who cares who cares nana nana)
And I'll shake
(who cares who cares nana nana)
(nana nana nana nana)

[Verse 1]
Now come one
Come one Come all
This is an evening you don't want to miss
Watch what you say
Watch what you say
Watch what you say
All you children are inside in membrane
Can't maintain ever struggle
Remembering my own name
I forgot why I came here

Hey do you have free beer? (No)
That's ok I brought a flask
Put me up to the test
To blow up the president
For thinking he [?]
Take over the White House
Go up in your wife's blouse
(that's disgusting deM)
Now I already told you I don't give a fuck
These motherfucks don't give a what about your life
Fight for my right I party
And I am doing nasty shit in the hallway
If I had it my way
Are you going my way?
I'm afraid not girl
Yeah I got the bad brains don't I
No could in the sky
Don't aim to high
And why you looking down at the time
I'll show you how to do a little rain dance
Unzip your pants
1 2 3
Sing to me now
4 5 6
Take a motherfucking bow
Mama gonna kick you out of this house
And your daddy's gonna whoop your ass
With his brand new bag and that's sad

(Ladies!) can I have your attention
(Fellas!) can you spare me your time
Kid go rhyme over MF DOOM instrumentals
Ready I was special ready 'bout to go mental
Here we go let the trumpets blow
Be careful 'cause the {?] is a pro

[hook]

Your ass better shake like it was a motherfucking earthquake

[Verse 2]

I don't have any eyes because the light is too bright
And they can all see inside
I don't know what dreams from reality
I learned to walk on either side
Are you a genie or the antichrist
Can someone please tell me why mama cries in her sleep every night
I emptied all the cupboards in the pantries
Trying to find something good to eat
I walk right down the street
Trying to catch the bus
The bitch bus driver don't stop
For a dark brotha
Undercover racist (racist?)
I'm developing a shark's fin tail
And my teeth are sharper than a ravenous beast
And I lay my fangs at your armor
That stands in between me myself and I
I'll bite the hand off whoever try to feed me
If it try to fuck with me
I'll meet you at the middle or the end
I don't got any friends, Please
Would you come again
I am having a bad day
Go away thanks I just wanted to settle the score
Shits not good between my father and me
When I was little kids used to call me a spaz
But at last. Would the ?
Please play that jazz
And I am loving that

[verse 3]
Dejected rejected infested in subliminal messages
In context I feel as big as an ant
Sitting next to giants and tyrants and hydrants
My pants on fire like i am a liar
Twist my nose with some rusty pliers
I finally obtained what I desire
I go coast to coast
With the most flows I boast
And also with the dopeness
Don't try approach this
You niggas is hopeless
Please Mr. DJ would you drop my shit like an atom bomb
Napalm and anthrax all in one
Hijack and track and leave a nigga done
And if the police come what you gonna do
I'm gonna shoot the fucking pig in the head til they all dead
I am ready to place bets
I'm gonna slay you all, big or small
Short or tall, come one, come all
I'll make it sound so profound
A pronoun can pronounce it
I burned down my fathers house and
I pissed on his carcass and sheepskin carpets
[?]
Formerly known as the one called "It"
Coughing up phlegm and spit and shit so much
I got used to it [x3]

The whole world is out of order
Give up your boy, girl, son or daughter
The whole world is out of order
Give up your boy, girl, son or daughter
The whole world is out of order
Give up your boy, girl, son or daughter
The whole world is out of order
Give up your boy, girl
The whole world smiles
It smiles at you
The whole world smiles
It laughs at you
Everything is broken
I wanted to wake up from these bad dreams
I been having lately
Can you wake me
Leave me here
Ain't nothing left to do but
Shake me
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Shake me
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Shake me
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Ain't nothing left to do, ain't nothing left to do
Shake me
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Shake me
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Shake me
(who cares who cares nana nana)
Ain't nothing left to do, ain't nothing left to do
