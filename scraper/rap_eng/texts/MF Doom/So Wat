I'm so self demeaning whats your meaning-
I got a high self esteem I'll be in my dreams
I'll be in my dreams [x2]

I'm a grown man
Oh shit I'm still a little person
Carry a tommy gun forfront
Like Al-Pacino or Scarface
Against anyone who wasn't good to me back then
I'll blow the bastards head off
I'm not the type of angry nigga to cross
Actually- I'm just a pushover
My real name is Larry and im very sorry
Losing like Jenny Frazier
Nothing plays out of my favor
But its alright where it should be
I'm nestled right underneath your Christmas tree
Before I burglarize your presents with my presence and that
Nothing but fingerprints and stencil
I lost my pencil
Whatever
I'm worst at what i do best
And I'm so tired i can't sleep
All the problems in the world my soul don't need
And my body's hungry
Nothing in my pantry
Barely escaping the poverty
I need to get some food-stamps
I need to do my taxes
And teach myself
Just trying to end this life


I'm so self demeaning whats your meaning-
I got a high self esteem I'll be in my dreams
I'll be in my dreams [x2]


So i left, left
Left and i don't regret
Apathetic don't sweat it I'll be in the basement
Who are those strangers
They look like cardboard that i could tear apart
Hey charlie lets go play darts
I love to start shit but i will never finish it
Be the first one in and the first one out
I been here a mighty long time now
Still got a quarter century left
Sitting on the church steps waiting for god

Hello hi
Forget me?
People often do
I expect my funeral to
Contain a few individuals who
Are willing to go the distance
Are willing to go the mile
And even in my coffin I'm still smiling

Maybe hell is heaven and heaven is hell
I couldn't tell the difference that well oh well
I was never very smart
Where the hell do i go now

Why are you sad
Why the long faces [x2]


I'm so self demeaning whats your meaning-
I got a high self esteem I'll be in my dreams
I'll be in my dreams
(so what!)
Fuck
