[Verse 1: The Real Ice Cream Man]
49 doesn't have the time for lame rhymes
Wait in line for the internal rhymes inspired organized crime big as optimus prime
49 the paradigm of sublime rhymes
Climb the game part-time no chime like a mime could you spare a dime

[Verse 2: Ryan Flip-Flop]
Ryan Flip-Flop is back with 49
The Real Ice Cream Man i will give you a dime
We destroy at the game of pool
You think you're cool, you're a fool
We are the shining jewel
And trust you are nothing but dust

[Verse 3: The Real Ice Cream Man]
Cause we kick you up don't give a fuck
Better duck when i chuck amuck bad luck so you get stuck
Get struck with a garbage truck you schmuck and beat up with some golfing clubs you scrub
Wake up in a shrub next to a full tiger cub with a stub

[Verse 4: Ryan Flip-Flop]
49 we are the best we won't rest
Till we rip open you're chest and play hopscotch
We will kill it just watch you're not real like sasquatch and mermaids
When we win there will be a parade in our name

[Verse 5: The Real Ice Cream Man]
So step up your game you lame
Put you to shame
Proclaim the stage names that are critically acclaimed
Leave you maimed its all the same your the one to blame
While 49 in the hall of fame
Hashtag nom is the name, Bitch

[Verse 6: Ryan Flip-Flop]
ATC that stands for anti-Tyler club
Can't you see Tyler as no friends
Sumos are you twins
Do people like you it depends is your name Tyler?

[Verse 7: The Real Ice Cream Man]
I'm just a swifter bigger bitter blister shape shifter mister tounge twister known killer of your young sister
49 is realer than you wanna be killers
Just wanted you to know what the deal is
Before we kill it
We on some real shit

[Verse 8: Ryan Flip-Flop]
Were also on the Golden Mountains
In front of my house are golden fountains
'Scuse me are you doubting our skill
What are you a Bill?
Every track we kill, destroy you against your own will

[Verse 9: The Real Ice Cream Man]
This is 49 world domination
Hashtag nom narration
Music for the duration of your vacation
Our dictation sweeps the nations and plays on the stations
Critics feel elation on location
Our music gives sensations

[Verse 10: Ryan Flip-Flop]
I'm not a good doctor
I kill all of my patients
And hide them in hidden locations
Kill you in mixtapes is what ill do
Challenge me to a duel but there can only be one rule
It's that 49 wins
