[MF DOOM/Viktor Vaughn-Talking]
This is an editorial funded by rhymers
Against phony gangsters
And mainstream evil
The Supervillain

[Manchild]
I showed up lampin with a soul strut anthem
And a plan to mess your fan and a legend is a tandem
Some low cut abandon tiger fist mic handlin
Heard your feminine sound and had to prescribe pamperin
Crampin your style like your parents on a first date
Yeah word is born with a dangerously low birth weight
Scenario: worst case, you dealin with a monster
I keep the peace but they wanna hold heat like a sauna
Gonna step into your nightmares, you pull it when you sleep
I'm still standin right there catchin bullets in my teeth
Police and bap with a reason that speaks to black to the back of a mind
That I want my people back and that's fine
America's pastime is now alive and kickin you
Another public scandal, a Michael Jackson interview
I'm addicted to Real World and I hope I can kick it soon
While my aspirations and skill level are still in tune
Midnight's a high noon, fly jewels with MF
A Villain and a Manchild, possibilities endless
Get close to the speaker, yeah you too princess
Unless the restrainin order specifies at least ten steps

[Manchild] (Chorus)
Word placement, is this seat taken?
So sick of waitinin ya'll they sayin nathin
We expect payment for this level of greatness
You dealin with Manchild it's so hard to face it
Word placement, is this seat taken?
So sick of waitinin ya'll they sayin nathin
We expect payment for this level of greatness
When you dealin with IZ it's so hard to face it

[IZ-REAL]
Everystep I take another fake hood rate
I don't make the mistake to put my foot on the waist
But I make my state, I don't sway in anyway
When I grab the micro play
I reign on parades, especially the suckas
The big ruckas duckas big ice wearin fool motha (*fuckers*)
With a knack for every single day of the week
Gotta watch my step, can't get no crap on my feet
Walkin tall straight to the dope of opportunity
Been too many years and let the weight get a pull of me
I'm chillin with the drastic, they call me rap bastard
Envy's a bitch when ya dealin' with the masters
I'm trying ta compensate for ya ill rap traits
By concoctin' schemes to sell a few rap tapes
Ya played ya odd but somethin' wrong wit 'cha numbers
It's time to pay the bookie or take a long slumber

[Manchild] (Chorus)
Word placement, is this seat taken?
So sick of waitinin ya'll they sayin nathin
We expect payment for this level of greatness
You dealin with IZ it's so hard to face it
Word placement, is this seat taken?
So sick of waitinin ya'll they sayin nathin
We expect payment for this level of greatness
When you dealin with Doom it's so hard to face it

[MF DOOM/Viktor Vaughn]
Can't stand the beat, there's no sense bitchin
Can't stand the heat, go get from out the kitchen
Ran through the street and leave a whole set twitchin
Skip the stitchin, complements of the henchmen
He rocked it, the flow got her dizzy
He keep a few knockers cocked and loaded for grizzly
It's no big deal, niggas say they real
But ain't got no heart to bust shots at a pig mobile
Putzes got the game all mucked up
Must be nuts kids, fuck up and get fucked up
Beat the heck out a rapper for street wreck
And laugh, playin with a half a full cheat deck
Pull your burner to earn you some respect son
And be the next hun, to get a C-section
With no epideral screamin I heard ya'll
Cats is talkin coughin up info like a furball
Do ya bid, don't be scared
The wrong three words on the tier, get'cha eared
Everywhere blood smeared, ya should of been prepared
Layin there balled up lookin all weird
Villain hold the heater on a cold day
And keep a old throw-away for a old fay
No way get bagged on no day
DOOM'll change his name to Jose' Yo No Se

[Manchild] (Chorus)
Word placement, is this seat taken?
So sick of waitinin ya'll they sayin nathin
We expect payment for this level of greatness
DOOM, Manchild and IZ you can't face it
Word placement, is this seat taken?
So sick of waitinin ya'll they sayin nathin
We expect payment for this level of greatness
DOOM, Manchild and IZ you can't face it
