Vintage Tapes

Verse 1

Izzy ayy vintage tapes gp renegade

Err day err day forget what everybody say can't see you cause the girls in the way renegade wassup

Album the outcome of me

Spitting cold verses drop the degrees

Rap tendency to kill for the family

The life that I seek includes a college degree

The kids who don’t work on education might just end on the streets

The kids who try hard end up on this beat

The teens that get called freaks and others geeks

Mountain that my team crawled won’t get pulled from under my feet

Cause successfully it took me time to reach what I have reached

Vintage tapes with messages

Gave me drapes

The tapes and the success got em Trynna hate

But the hate don’t just give me hatred it also motivates

Double the acres triple on my landscape

Got it stretched out and backward like these elastics

My skills is so balanced call em gymnastics

And I admit that past six my lyrics get adlibs

Tactics bout raps including the classics

Stuck in traffic than I kill with no practice
Ladies hit me up love the questions they asking

She is fond of me cause I am a beast

Rapping insane sounding elite

Imaging thing that people shouldn’t even believe

Sharing this experience with the rest of my team

Meet me boii
