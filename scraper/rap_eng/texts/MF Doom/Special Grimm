Spitting fire molecules like the outline of meteors
Time to infect my mouth with more rhymes like porn whores getting germs
Over heads like outdoor church bells but the flow is never getting rusty
Propelling style that expands over the crumpling lands
Each line that I write sticks in my mental like the inside of empty jello cups
Abstract dubs
Exotic fucking nuggets interrupting my education like bombs going off leaving the area around vacant
You will never obtain the visual pages within my mind like trying to spectate the other side of black holes
The book of control that goes beyond a professionals perspective of love
Infinite limits like universe exhibits
My soul bleeds in crickets
Mislead breed that is beat down but still growing like fertilized seeds
Exceed in cell count of fans
Amount to an army and surround the corrupted heads that have not advanced to this cancer shore
Speared and shred the Feds like operation patients statements combusting in the sea of the medias pours
Explore the supreme supported super human beams
Exploded grips designed to constrict these evil clips I consider dreams
Decrypt these Shakespeare scripts which drip from thick blunt sticks
My lips are unzipped like the first stage of DNA replication
In the second phase of dropping bricks down the stairway
Metaphor for releasing problems
I can't afford to trade chromosomes so I focus on the waveforms
Showing the resemblance of a regular kid that spent his years on the table drawing cards ready to summon my destiny heroes
Audit swim flicks continue while I gulp my anger ready to go like Tybalt did
If the night is to forever be extended not showing any sign of light
Then I will take place In the act of death to show my commit towards life
