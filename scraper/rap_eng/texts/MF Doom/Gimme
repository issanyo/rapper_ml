Here we go here we go
Give me a girl, if not, I'll still pull it
Gimme a tek 9 millimeter, full 'em bullets
Gimme like eight quarters for every buck
Gimme three feet I swing too fast and duck
You suck
I give ya gutter balls if you plan strikes
'Cause I'm the pin hitter, skinner of my likes
You get it all back in a big bunch of PSYCHES
First, gimme props and double check 'em like Nikes
I be an old man if ya judge by my thoughts
Gimme none of those, I take no shorts, um
If in case ya stop flippin'
Gimme now take it back and let ya Waltz, Whitman
Gimme guidelines, gimme my toast
You pronounce tomatoes, I pronounce tomahtoes
Yo, black, that's my cheese, don't touch, it's nachos
I'm a dog every day, I taste el gatos (that's riiiiiight!)
Gimme good eats and don't think to pork it
I gots a plank and I'll make your mother walk it
Don't talk shit New York I stalk it
Gimme reason to shut your mouth my fist'll caulk it
What ya got?

(Give it here!)
The whole shebang

The whole shebang

The whole shebang

Well, welcome me back like my man Kotter
If not, I'll leave ya flat broke with nada
'Cause I gotta keep my style flexin' like areobic
Gimme elbow room, I'm crazily claustrophobic
Gimme a doo-rag for my hair
I'll give ya a ten foot pole
Touch it, it's up your rear
I hear a sequence, gimme so I can tell a tattle-teller
Now, shut your mouth while I speak it a capella
I'm the yellow maraca medium brown tone
I do what I feel 'cause, child, I'm grown
Gimme no cologne, I rock oils
Gimme a lot of looten, I still won't straighten my nappy coils
You won't gimme a lot of loot? (What!?)
I'll give ya a lot of lumps
My fist'll graze ya and give ya razor bumps
Never did like chumps
The grumpy man comes with a grudge
I don't budge like tree trunks
I been a bad ass since I's a child
Throws me in jail, I got the nail file
Gimme a roti for my curry
Playa, trade it to me, yes you should worry - a lot
What ya got?

[Subroc]
(Give it here!)
The whole shebang
(Give it here!)
The whole shebang
(Give it here!)
The whole shebang
(Give it here!)
The whole shebang

I'm like the IRS ready to tax someone
So when you see me comin', come and dread
Hold up a big tight fist for power to blacks
Gimme a choo choo train for my bad ass tracks
Gimme a kite or it might be a head I fly
Gimme a old record and kiss that shit goodbye
Double or not I want it back, chance it, black
If it nice roll the dice...
Ya got a six, five and a four
But the rat-a-tatta in my pocket says
I don't think so
Give it up (give it here)
Whatcha got?
Reach grab ya get elbowed or speed knot
Gimme a frame I'll put it around you
So 5-0s and all my folks can hound you
Disrespect my boys will surround you
Smack you up, black you up, pound you
Down the drain like day is plain
Ya can't stand me if ya can't stand the rain
Hail earthquakes or thunder
So if I knock ya off don't wonder
No wonder what ya got

[Subroc]
(Give it here!)
The whole shebang
(Give it here!)
The whole shebang
(Give it here!)
The whole shebang
(Give it here!)
The whole shebang
