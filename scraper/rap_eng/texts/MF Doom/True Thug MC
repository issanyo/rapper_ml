[Intro: MF DOOM]
(Gibberish)
Might have to do some fancy punching but we can do it

[Hook: Megalon]
I wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
But who you want me to be
A true thuggin' MC
True thugs
With no strings attached
Wanna give you my slugs
And don't wanna take 'em back

I wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
But who you want me to be
A true thuggin' MC
True thugs
With no strings attached
Wanna give you my slugs
And don't wanna take 'em back

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nickname for nibble and tibble nibble metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang, guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen youth
It's like me holdin' up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sun roof through her missing tooth
She has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop todays math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic and get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealin'
What the devil? He on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF, the Supervillain!
He cleans his mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling a chick like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarted in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they weak crew
That's no mystery like Hardy Boys would do with Nancy Drew
Sorta wear her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
Suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villan in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's a off day for Ferris Bueller
Niggas pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, you still got beats to catch the

[Hook: Megalon]
I wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
But who you want me to be
A true thuggin' MC
True thugs
With no strings attached
Wanna give you my slugs
And don't wanna take 'em back

I wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
But who you want me to be
A true thuggin' MC
True thugs
With no strings attached
Wanna give you my slugs
And don't wanna take 'em back
