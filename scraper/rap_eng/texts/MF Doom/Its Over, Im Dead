Come sit alone with me
Come lets waste our time
Give me room to breathe
Inhaling through mine
Come all over me
Singing its over its over
Yeah

Come sit alone with me
Come lets waste our time
Give me room to breathe
Inhaling through mine
Fuck this shit never-mind
Its over its over
Yeah...


I take a drag breathing in space
Living in soul so its all good
Its easy
You don't need to agree
Got my soul on my goal
Working for a better day
Always feeling like a drag somedays
If only i could rip the paper bag open
Not living healthy these days
But anyway, give me a raise


Come sit alone with me
Come lets waste our time
Give me room to breathe
Inhaling through mine
Come all over me
Singing its over its over
Yeah

Come sit alone with me
Come lets waste our time
Give me room to breathe
Inhaling through mine
Fuck this shit never-mind
Its over its over
Yeah...

And loves all it takes
I love how it lasts
Never goes slows
Sorta flys right past
Desperate
I'm just tryna chase some ass
Living like you, looking through a glass eye
You don't even have to ask, give me some love
Thanks for listening
Can you make it, ill be there any second
Had a destined mr rain sorta dream
And i wish you could made it
