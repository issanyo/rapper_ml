[intro]
Verse 1

Finding ways to passionately make
Snowing in march like why
Astro zone is perplexing
Maybe its the type of ways to create
I would try to be educated from the factors of life
Pondering of what is my blessing
Destiny is what it takes for a person
I'm surprised i don't know how to write cursive
Relaxing in the bus of Fullerton
Dreaming of the destiny I'll take upon
Writing my name on that fucking rap bulletin
Hoping me and demon will keep  it going
Education is making me go slowing
On these bars that go like the sauce of tar tar
Wondering if my dreams can go that far high
I'm just laying at the clouds
Every type of idea being profound
At least spread my name around
Testing of my potential at least i gotta try
I'm not sure i would finally reach the sky
Though, this is the intro of this tape

[Skit]

Ay demon should we make a tape?
Sure man, just... u do the rappin, Im just good at hooks
Aight then one of the tracks u gotta spit man, u gotta spit
Aight some songs, some
