“If you niggers interfere we’ll kill you!”


(This is the voice of Zimbabwe)


I used to teach Sunday school to the grade two crew
Spitting knowledge, wise man with my leather lands
"Could you drop a nice verse cause it please us?"
How i'm meant to know that little Judas meant Jesus
As you can probably decipher
I had to leave the premises lest we have to call on the authority
Pardon me i'll just grab my bag
This is how the fin was living life at a glance yo
Fast forward to the clock in your corner
I’m on the same hustle same bustle tryna write a rap
For the kids and they mamas
Could you leave the drama in the foyer
I got a coat hanger to rack your beef
A gangster who runs the street between 57 and 59
Between 9 and noon
He got a busy schedule
Cause we living double trouble lives
9 life living tryna juggle exponential wife numbers
In the city that never sleeping a peep
Rolling 7 brothers deep in a jeep
We got the attitude
Beep beep
Who got the beat in a vice grip?
Throwing bad omens with a chicken in a Greco-Roman
3 count pin
Special move the groove
Fineas ready to win!
And as we move to the crescendo
I play it really close like an itty bitty t.v and Super Nintendo
Record the jammy on Nuendo
They tighten up the drums, I’m fitting to let the whole entire bass go!
And distort your whole life
Crush the metaphor and they deport me on some bogus charge
Saying that my style is mad potent
Run you 90 bucks and have you run another 90 miles focused
Thank me in the morning if you make it little dunny
Don't laugh unless you find it funny (haha)
But the rapping always is
Tryna make a living on a listen to my shi…
Yo don't be stupid
This is only build for raw links
Cause we never cook it for the winks and the hijinks
I hope I didn't touch a nerve up on your spinal
Your voice fluff, Black built tough like some 80's vinyl
The kind of vinyl that snap crackle pop
The kind of vinyl you don't touch twice... cause its too hot
And as we enter through the hourglass
I'd like to ask that all the bigger ladies sitting in the back
Please fasten all that ass, cause you know I love you
From the pilot to the chicken heads in all the classes
We about to lift it off
Dusty in the engine wait a minute yo i gotta cough
(uhu uh)
A poet with a club
Bite the tiger hide and then he wear it like a tiger cub
Cause he dangerous
Breaking down the discipline
In tiny little pieces
Something you can wrap your head around the realer thesis
Playing on the only city radio fam
Take you back to your kin. Its Fin
