HOOK:
Aw, shit, this shit is disgusting

Can’t forget yo chick is disgusting, black licorice, she lick it disgusting

Every thing we discussing be disgusting

My black lips spit nothing but  disgusting
Trust, this gross .. also interesting

Mojo, u know on disgusting, u mo' so so, I go get to resting

VERSE:
Doomsday just a new moon away, string shit together like looms in my face, emergency call, set a boom to the place, emerged from the grain, don’t u move in my lane, clocking my seconds, couldn’t even  think of shit I jot in a second, eating currently, been plotting on seconds

Got a collection I reckon u would just gotta f with
Be a' lotta two stepping

All my life only wanted one thing

To be this nice and spit it disgusting

See the future for realll, I see the thugs sing

Gotta coupe, get a mill ?  it’ll be something

I promise, that’s a million mo options
I could go candy shopping like which flavor should I pick
Like em thick melanin rich, black licorice
Give me brain cause I’m literate, when I dip say she miss the drip

OUTRO:
[dayum.. damn baby, I ain't know .. i ain't know you like it like that .. aw shit, awh .. disgusting]
