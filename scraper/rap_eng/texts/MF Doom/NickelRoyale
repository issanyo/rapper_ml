[Verse 1: Epifani Telon]

I been tryna' catch a wave
Get away but they followin'
Twitter's not the cause on how these people still swallowin'
Die hard lyricist
Word play and penmanship
God sent me bars cuz my flows got a heaven scent
I'm killin' every nemesis
That's steady tryna hang with this
Fuck a fake apperance
Fake people keep a distance
They never loved me they just love the big faces
I keep em' to myself
That's a man to man basis
PAUSE, I can't blame em'
My flows is outrageous
Get all types of praises till' the labels give me payment
Don't try to contact less a 6 mill contract
Ends up in my hand
I'll be a better boy man
Topic of discussion
Conspicious consumption
Braggin' bout' my fads like concussions
Women come in bunches
So I ain't got the time to be cryin' over nothin'
My style just keeps it pushin'
Known to find another if you don't want chances
Relapsin' on these tracks that blast these niggas beeswax
Mind they own, ya heart man I put on for these haters
Always tryna down our love that we created
You took a chance and I know you didn't mean it
See it wrong doing minds thats a misdeameanor
Hypothesis listened to them peeps for wrong procedures
No Castro I'm just tryna see where it's gon' lead-us

It's just NickelRoyale
Nick Nick NickelRoyale
NickelRoyale
Nick Nick NickelRoyale
NickelRoyale
I been tryna get that light out my eyes
But you there so I gotta let it shine (2x)

[Verse 2: Epifani Telon]

Out my mind like my brain moved out
Without some points so let's make this count
I scream and shout like WILL
When I.AM upset
Tag teamers never give me a rest
Always stressin' the best I object
Bang the hammers on the instigatin' heads
That's just an obstacle when you out here gettin' bread
Just a pigeon to the game
Never countin' on these lames
It's just common sense so you can go and keep the change
Out my range with fakeness
Think quick hit ya' girl like a neat lick
And bring her in sequence
With lines that attracted the heavenly goddess
Chill with lyrical prophets
Drop constant bombs for big targets
Damn I needed time so went and stole a couple watches
Houston had a problem cuz' she took off like a rocket
With memories in my socket and emotional no just stop it
Hoes wanna hit me when I'm risin'
I'm INFINITY BEYOND it
Buzzin' on these niggas
World full of hate so it's no lovin' in these niggas
Ain't no trustin' in these niggas
Dyin' by the triggers
A jimmy on my heart cuz I ain't fuckin' with these bitches

[Hook]

It's just NickelRoyale
Nick Nick NickelRoyale
NickelRoyale
Nick Nick NickelRoyale
NickelRoyale
I been tryna get that light out my eyes
But you there so I gotta let it shine (2x)
