[V1: Rusty Ventures]
When the bolt hit I swear my mind split
My embodiment holding a loading gun against his conscious
Pill of non sense lying on the ground then the coppers found it
Pops around popped around, regardless of my action
He said be what he missed
Messed around now his dreams are dreamless
I'm the second coming like i'm barley eating
Killah Bandit season bout to rake it in like we missed a leaf
Leave the hate in a pill of miss belief
Drown um in that pool of liquor Kendrick drinks
Smack um in the face with a stack of bills like that late on the lease
Least we could do
Know before you preach least you could do
No vest , stay bullet proof , no bullet wombs
Niggas know we the latest cause we stay on new
Stopped by there mothers said sorry for the blues
Clues to the deed , I had to take um to
Flowers at there grave potted medical if i choose
Roller of the butch i'm high when i choose
No introductions, you know who is who

Damn, aaron, you're head big as fuck nigga

[V2: Mordecai Malice]
So it's either you or him
Spit patterns that could desecrate your paradigm
Pick up the paper mate
Then scribble evil thoughts onto the paper, mate
But don't get it twisted it doesnt correlate
Look at my ambitions and let it corruscate
Peace and balance when i hit the bong
Strong lexicon, got more words than a Buddha song
Can you relate?
I meditate, sit back and let my mind 'vaporate
Namaste i see the common hate
And wish that it would condensate
It's either you die young or vice versa
Versus my raps damn i just made it worse huh?
16 with a vision my mission
Is to have these competition missing
You can't do it if you're holding fear
Treasure you're life that's why it's called the golden years
