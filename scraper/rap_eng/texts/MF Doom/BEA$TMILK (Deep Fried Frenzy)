[Intro]
Catch me swanking in the winner circle passing the dub

[Verse]
Since sixteen I’ve been spitting sixteens, airborne, giving emcees the illest disease
Scratching 'em CD’s to keep my records clean, so no backwoods please, my esteem’s got me higher than trees
Plus the way them roots stemmed got me smoking loose leaf
Now I’m cruising in a hooptie with two feet on the dash
While my third legs pinning the gas
And ion need hooks like Kareem to box out Ali
Put me in a box and i'm taking corners for my team
That's word to Chugs Lean, said I ain't gotta chug lean to mix the dirty with the clean
Them indigo dreams became daily routine
Told shawty I hate to get in-between cookies like cream
But I prefer breast milk in my cheerios especially when I’m crunching the competition like cereal
That's a tit for a tat
Rappers be flowing on maxi pads claiming they next to blow like jihad
Yet they can’t even compare to what this g had
Since he was a yute
And he grew into a fine protein with healthy ass glutes
Now he’s trynna squeeze the world with his crew
So you’d be playing catch up if you let us through
And some say he’s in cahoots with a villain named DOOM from the way he devours loops like mm..FOOD
On a deep fried frenzy, so watch it our you’ll get bread up like the recipe
And rest in peace to all my G’s
I know their present cause i can feel their energy
Opened the gates to release my inner chi, now I feel like Rock Lee or Barclay when I kick it on a beat
We in the league of legends but i ain't gotta compete, cause i got em tense on their feet like their rocking a re release
And whats the big deal? They be like the flows unreal but i just toy with it like a happy meal
Serve emcee raps and watch em fallback in line like i screwed the order for the last time
Digest the rhyme its quite edible
I’m trynna shake the globe with a couple decibels
And ohms known to hold it down like a decimal, so you’d hate to be in the centre of my reticle
Reloaded AK, got knowledge way above your paygrade,them shadows in plato's cave leave you entertained
I’m trynna crack the universe, no post sec but i still spit a uni-verse
2300 degrees like bitch what you thought it was?
And I’m still swanking in the winners circle passing the dub
