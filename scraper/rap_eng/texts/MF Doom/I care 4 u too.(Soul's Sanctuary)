Pulled up in a black beamer
My rims are black too...
She was cheesin...
You should have seen her ooh...
Smile of a goddess
Just like her body
Wanted to ride it
But............ patience is a virtue....
I know her worth too...
So in this race you'd better know that I'm the turtle..
Cuz haste can hurt you....
Hurt us..
In God we trust...
Eyes away from the lust
Cuz you are more than a woman...
And way more than enough...
Look...
No idea why my spirit is kindred to yours
I gotcha back you're a blessing that is for sure
I refuse to wonder what if...........I promise I'm yours...
If you're ready let's soar....
You're the reason the word perfect exists...
I'll let that settle in...
You're the reason the word perfect exists...
Now that that's settled in...I'm not settling...

Listen.... I care for you....
This is my 4 page letter....

Ms. One in a milli
You told me I should Just Breathe...
So..... i'll enjoy the ride.. read in between the lines....
Depression hit you whispered babe just try again...
You rocked my boat and now I'm flowing like the ocean...
You're hot like fire but extra smooth.....
But let me show you what your man Ed frost can do...
You probably get this all the time but you're beautiful..
And I couldn't live with myself if I never...ever let you know....you know?
So sick and tired of these loose raps....
My loose raps...you sang that song for me...
Knew it was my destiny...to be a great emcee..
I love that you can check me....
Keep me in line like a teacher in elementary
I know who the best be...
She got them angel wings...
So needless to say I missed you...
So...without further ado....
Aaliyah, I love you...
