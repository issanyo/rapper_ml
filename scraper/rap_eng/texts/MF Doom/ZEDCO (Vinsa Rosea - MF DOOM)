Hmm, this one, this one is for...
For Patrick, Isaac naLaizah

[Verse 1: Black Fin]

Only three of my people's is gonna get this
The Black Fin back on the block
Stacking the rock like he Tetris
Cracking the lock, stacking the barrel
He chew concrete, floss the street then poop out the gravel
You can't see, me the PCPunk
Killing the killers, kicking the skunk
You faking the funk
Tickle piano but he be digital
Using all the RAM like bam the situation has become... scram
Get away before I leave your tissue critical
Mr Calabash he gonna smash it like the brass
Never skipped a class but he never present
I leave the teacher with the heebie-jeebies
Rocking all the rags like super peasant
Playing Super Ninja on a 64
Back in ‘97 when the homie was the president
Hold up... The homie still the president
Praying that he never get the jam
Yo let me genuflect right quick
I’m pious
Rocking my FUBU leather
LL made me do some really dumb things
Well just some things, cause he taught me wreck a mic heavy
Turn a chunky beat into some angel hair spaghetti
Are you ready?
Sharpen the teeth i’m bout to nibble the entrails
Inhale the spirit of the rap
Let go, the boy Lego
Putting it back, back to the block
The boy on the clock until the early morn'
While your baby and her baby yawn
Feed the baby the best corn
The goulash, the sauce
Of course
Imi musaderere malevel
For instance
I’m ‘bilongo’... there's a difference
‘San’ Domingo
Hooped up like street ball
Street calling goons for the breaker platoon
Breaker breaker 1-9
How you write the rhyme with all the beef in the city?
Cause I’m young and I'm pretty
Cue Voltron
Come together slick to the stash
Brainwave thicker than a Rasta middle finger on the hash
Hashtag turbo when you looking
Side-tag, I be looking sexy in a do-rag
“Same Old Drag” but he picking the pace
Some be African some be Caucasian
Black Fin race be amazing
I come from a long line of some dudes who sip wine slow
Then roll feeling sublime, commit crime in the night time
Then I take a little nap to get the energy back
Boom, back and forth
You know the memo, keep lean, stay get the green like the gecko
Rinse it and repeat it like an echo
Junior certificate from ZEDCO! Haha!


Yes, I, I play too much
But you guys, you guys.. you don't play enough
That's your problem
Ehh!
