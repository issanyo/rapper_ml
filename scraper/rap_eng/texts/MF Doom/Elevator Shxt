With a knife that strikes one fearless
I'm politely slicing parents
Id be trying to repair it
After stifling an heiress

To my liking of awareness
I am slightly sight impaired
And so I blindly slice at air
In dreams of finding silent stares

I'm right beside a dragons lair
But its unlikely that I fear
Because I'm thriving on a tier
With laser lightening and a flare

So guard your knights and tell the mayor
Were bad as riots with a bear
And having fights with him compare
With tying dyra to a fair

And fighting fire with a pair
Of fire hydrants is apperently
Enlightening as staring though
The eyes if blind Americans
As I

And I appear
To be as white as blinded stares
Apparently that Is a lie
As if  I'm likely quite aberrant

No one is fly as am Arab
You could take a flight of stairs
And still not be high as a parrot
Was it aware that I care
Cus if not it isn't apparent

I'm robin a baby carriage
With monsters from hati
And then we stabbing ladies for karats

Strong hits from a dragon painted bong
Hittin' mom wit a long dick
And she gettin stomped
Like a moth In a moshpit

Then I'm skippin' off to an authentic auction
Call it criss cross
Switchin' Rick Ross
Wit a slim bitch grippin' ballskin
Often as awesome as 56 coffins and
Carcasses
All up In the office of bosses

Call em all hogs to abolish the nonsense
Stop this
Nothin's been as odd as adoption
Only option is to lodge it in dog lip
Jog 3 blocks find a phone in a box
And call the cops with
Hard chrome in my pocket

Had her gimmie dome an i drove till i stopped it
And rode all the way up to my home for deposits
Joshing
No car so i couldn't start shit
Hopped out and i did her arse like an ostrich

And bought it
At the local super market
For a bargain
Spittin' harder than retard kids
On a starship

Call it mars with a forest
And a sharp twist
I'm a smart kid
Wit charted lips
Wen I bar spit

Call me Sargent
What I'm barfin's lethargic
Hit your car quick
Have optimus car sick
Tony stark
Goin' lark on a go cart
In the stars
With an all spark on his target

Yeah she ardent
But I'm harvestin' her heart
And departing to the park where I party In the darkness
Obviously on it so I'm probably demonic
Flossin'
With a fuckin monster in your closet

Nigga flawless
Hold a crackhead hostage
And back shit off till I backflip of it
Fuck a bad bitch
With elastic sausage
Drawbridge?
Droppin' mad kids a in a long ditch
