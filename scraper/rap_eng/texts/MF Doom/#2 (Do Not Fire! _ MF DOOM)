Here’s my grand entrance:
Nameer crawls in with his banging fists
Blood trailing his pants and shit
I’m screaming, "Hey there’s a cat who’s ticked…
I picked the wrong cat with a stick!"
But they all laugh at my shit like I’m some cracked up kid…

What am I to do..
When two minutes later
The whole room
Ignores me like my parents loved to do…

But when the door's opened and I see that damned cat…
I peed my pants and grabbed the nearest knife in a napkin
I wanna stab my neck with a slit worse than if the cats claws could get to me first...
Which it does…

Man it’s been a while
Since I
Let me voice get out
Feels good
To give my inner thoughts
Freedom
Before Mr. Trump
Kills the
Freedom…
