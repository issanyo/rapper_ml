[Intro: MF Doom]
Party people
Doom
Here to let you know
That I have no prior knowledge to any invasion
Or
Any invasion being planned or executed
And I have no ties to Madlib
Or any organizations affiliated

[Chorus: Donald Byrd]
Stepping into tomorrow
Got funk beat on the ground
Stepping into tomorrow
My destiny is back
