[Verse 1]
When I was 14 I came across a pizza shop
”New York style” that shit was topped with the lot
That image spawned an idea that damn near changed my life
Big Apple apartment eating pizza watching Family Guy
Since then I’ve been thinking of this reality late at night
Turned 17 and now I wanna see this girl I really like
West side ho, heartbroken so I don’t wanna go
Now I’m 19 and I’m still down for New York though
Obsessed with American culture since day one
I hope next year I’m strapped with enough dough so my friends can come
My older brother took me to the candy store last summer
Bought twinkies and snickers that were peanut butter
Dropped $70 on sugar you can bet your ass I did
Running around the store crazy like a little kid
’Cause homie you know even spiders have dreams
I’ve been thinking about this day since I was 14

[Hook]
Even Spiders have Dreams you know what it is
These ideas came to me when I was just a kid
I hope I can achieve these before long after my teens
Even Spiders have Dreams, Even Spiders have Dreams

[Verse 2]
Ay yo
When I was 15, an insect ate my hand
Before long I was running around telling everyone Eminem’s the man
Early style Marshall and I are synonyms
Calling every asshole and dickhead I see that they’re feminine
Refuse to expand my taste but thank god I did
Listening to other artists like ‘Yo this dude’s the shit’
If my top 3 were the Avengers then I want to hit the big time
I know to get there it’s gonna be a steep climb
But I’ma keep at it, I’ll try to do my best
Kanye West, Tyler the Creator and King Kendrick
Those the type of motherfuckers you don’t wanna mess with
For the past 4 years I’ve been behind the mic just testing
Music for my friends, music for therapy
Music I dropped for my year group but none for my family
I want to tour with the homies appear on talk shows
It might 1, 5 or 10 years who knows
I know for a fact I’m more confident now than I’ve ever been
I’m gonna unleash a side of me no one has never seen
Now I don the mask to help achieve my dream
I’ve been thinking about this day since I was 15
