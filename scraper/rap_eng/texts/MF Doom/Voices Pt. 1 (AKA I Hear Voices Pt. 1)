[Intro: MF DOOM and (Sample)]
Out in the streets
You won’t survive with wack-ass beats (“We can see that”)
These days and times
Watch how we get
Ours with rhymes

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo, the con artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milošević
Anyhoo, how ‘bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage, the party people thanks me’s
If I may speak freely, nasty
Like the freaky-deaky at your local sleazy speakeasy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It’s risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who’s better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumping Jehoshaphat, who’s that?  Who cats
Who do magic be like, “Tell me how you do’s that”
Heck no.  Especially those who cop pleas like
Gekko.  They thought I might do techno.  Haha
The best’ll bust out laughing at the vet
For no reason, you get cussed out like Tourette
Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
But, uh, wordplay since third grade age
Back when we used to play “Bang! Open bird cage”
Hip hop Benny Hill, sip Henny straight, get every pennyweight
Then he chill.  At any rate
My Metal Face hoes with tongue or at least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing like
Kung-Fu fighting, everybody was biting
Then the Supervillain struck again like lightning at
The same spot (Hzzz!).  Now what’s the chance of that?
And a name drop like pick a name out the hat
That’s an old driver from the liver conniver
Who vote player out the rap game like Survivor while I
Drop degrees like a nerd cat, wheeling on ten-speeds
From way back, I spin your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball to zero
So-called rhymers, go call Cleo while I
Steal the show like, “Thought so.  Try hiking”
Super-duper stars need Ortho Tri-Cyclen
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying, “That’s the Supervillain”
(Uhh, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women
I hear voices
Supervillain
