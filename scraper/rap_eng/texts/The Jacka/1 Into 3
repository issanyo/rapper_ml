[Verse 2: The Jacka]
If you trynna score from me meet me in a plaza
Not a Superbowl party but we lookin' at your plasma
Pulling cannons 'fore you blink all I did was wink at you
The connect saying next week but we gotta link faster
Meeting on the lake while we smoking Pink Panther
Soon as he think its sweet I tied his ass up then I splashed him
Got the gas tank out the whip then I dashed it
Lit his ass on fire singing quire at a baptist
American horror we just bringing war where there is no order
Taped they face lock 'em in containers with no food or water
See our mothers start using base when they lose our fathers
So much pain that I'm not the same took in by the darkness
Innocent kids killing to live we had to be taught this
Getting rich but we not gon' live soon you'll be a carcass
Life's wild nice smile they can't see through the surface
Killing shit moving town to town while I work the circuit
