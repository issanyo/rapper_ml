[Intro: The Jacka]
Jack..JA man
Mob..Mafia
I know they know what this

[Hook: The Jacka]
Killing everywhere with my gun
Become a millionaire with my gun
Murder everywhere that I gone
I can leave the house when I want
I've been everywhere with my gun
Became a millionaire with my gun
Murder everywhere that I gone
I can leave the pad when I want


[Verse 1: The Jacka]
6 niggas 6 K's soon as the bank open
Jumped on the counter while the safe still open
Tell a bitch fill up the sack before I smoke her
And disappear into thin air and split the loaf up
Happened so fast like a inside job
I prayed I get away then after that thank God
The OG's tellin' me what I do ain't sharp
Then soon forgot when I pulled up in the o'12 drop
It smell like weed in the trap but we don't sell pot
Im from the Mob, fight nod when I inhale hop
Stay out the way hard to get paid when you in jail pop
Niggas say they ill then leave the detail out
Must be a cold day in hell, they say we sell out
Cause all I know is the goons, thousand moves in my thoughts
The young bull, fourteen, thousand shoes in my house
While you was livin' with yo moms i was fuckin' off thousands

[Hook]
Killing everywhere with my gun
Become a millionaire with my gun
Murder everywhere that I go
I can leave the house when I want
I've been everywhere with my gun
Became a millionaire with my gun
Murder everywhere that I go
I can leave the pad when I want
