[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Wake you up like Folgers
Ambulance come to stalk you down
Lost alotta soldiers for our young friends to walk around
Can't nobody owe us, all we know is to knock you down
I just wanna rap, wack niggas wanna stop our sound
But I got a chop, don't see Jack 'less the Glock's around
If you see Gap, hunnid clip, no stock around
Got bodies under your belt? We got many
Cause King Freak & Pum ain't not with me
Cause P-Black & (?) ain't not with me
L̶i̶l̶ ̶M̶o̶n̶i̶e̶, the Fed-X, nigga they not friendly
We don't party 'less there's Peru & a Benji
Empty Tommys, then they can die from the injuries
You ain't fly, you ain't fuck with the Mob, you our enemies
Kill & rob, walk with more arms than a centipede
(?) ill shit, gangster rhymes we invented these
You ain't got the Mob on your sleeve then you've been a dweeb

[Verse 2: Gap]
I'm a killer my nigga I gotta stay strapped
Probably burn in hell, I sold my momma crack
Yeah I'm part of the Mob that's why I'm with the Jack
Yeah I'm the Gap and nigga I'm the way I rap
Nigga got bands, still kill you for them stacks
Shoot ya ass broad day if you is a rat
I don't trust these suckas they stabbin' in the back
I can never love a bitch because they all (?)
Shoot ya ass right now ain't no comin' back
Naw it ain't in the trunk man, it's on my lap
I ain't like these other rappers man, I really trap
Man this shit is real life, man it ain't no act
Man I'm past the states, the Feds want my ass
Loyal nigga, never sell my sold for no (?)
Real nigga for my homie I will give you (?)
Real nigga for my homie I will give you (?)
