[Hook]
The pines were roaring o-ooon the height
The trees like torches blaze- with- blazed with light
2 dungeons deep
Bla- blazed with light

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I've smoked a lot of weed in my lifetime
Seems just like yesterday I was a teen because life's flyin'
It's a struggle everyday but still I tell my kids life's fine
Everyday I would push Yae nigga if I did not rhyme
Out here in that Louis V just to lean on a stop sign
The bitches notice me they say i'm fly but i'm not flyin'
Finish with the Yae, hit the grow and my crop dryin'
Package hit the traffic and the trappers won't stop buyin'
Got the Wesson poppin' like meat in the pot fryin'
Better have respect like the vet when he feed lions
Knock your head off your neck with my fists I don't need iron
If it's over my Fam or my bread then I squeeze iron
They hate that I'm ahead gettin' head while I breeze by 'em
They say that they ain't scared but when I'm there they seem frightened
DMG shades gettin' paid from the tree I'm lightin'
Or in the lab and there's bars on the mic, cause we ain't writin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Marks act like they hard, they scared of everybody
Wanna be just like the MOB, they mirror everybody
In my circle we gone fuck around and murk you
This for my niggas in the box you squares is just commercial
Got nerves you know i'm higher than a bird of blow
These niggas think dope but they never seen coke
Me n Rob-Lo higher than a Mink coat
When the trigger squeeze we only leave bones, like a Lynx home
That's a big cat, Fully no kick back, silencer on the tip all you see is nigga splat
You can never be my nigga you ain't into that
They smell us before way before we pull up cause all we smoke is Plat
You wanna hang with The Jack, you better hold your strap
Soon as your enemy rundown, expose his naps
I'm bouta murder all the rap niggas posed with straps
He gone need luck cause he's fucked if he sees The Jack

[Hook]
