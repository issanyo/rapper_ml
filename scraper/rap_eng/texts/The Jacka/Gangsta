[The Jacka]
The last samurai, god damn I'm fly
My niggas super hyphy, I be super high
I'm in the box chevy, sittin' stupid high
The rims don't move, look like we floatin' by holdin' my
4-0-C-A-L, it's the J-A-C, from C-A-L
You niggas playin' with it, but boy I be stayin' with it
So keep it in the circle mayne, cuz it's never different
It'll keep em' lifted, hour after hour
Unwrapped 20 kicks while inhalin' sour
The Jamaican Shower P-O-S-S-E, involved in the type of crimes you'll never be
Check out my wetter B, it's zero in the clip
It was fun I was numb as shit
Shells fall bodies drop dam the game is thick
A addict to the streets, it's hard to kick
Easy to sniff whatever make me drift, through the night shift Takin' chances  daily baby precious as my life is

..I'm just a gangsta, mane..

[The Jacka]
What happened to the world is my biggest question
What happened to the cuddie Furl was the biggest lesson
Up the block sideways through the intersection
Seem just like yesterday we was in the session
What you know 'bout holdin' it down with a weapon
I don't think you do, the words from Never Blink was true
Now sink deep me and you, that's I & I
I was high in smoke too thick to see through
Clout my brain, I was barely sane
Hey nigga shit ain't really been the same, since I been a grown mane
Should of got an education, only got myself to blame
Gettin' older every day, tryna smoke away the pain
Gunshot, one shot, blaow, I can see his brain
I can't see his face no more, I don't feel a thing
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas in the hood, we won't never change

[Hook]
I'm just a gansta (I'm just a gansta man)
Who's caught up in the game (Who caught up in the game)
I'm just a gangsta (I'm just a gangsta)
I guess some things will never change (Some things'll never change)

[The Jacka]
I got my hand on my strap, these suckas makin' me nervous
All I need is The Bay they say the world don't deserve us
Sold out the first day, the people they don't return us
They say when you returnin' with a new release Jacka
I love the game and the streets, then the rap will come after
Watch ya mouth shake suckas cuz the boys will come snatch ya
Friday afternoon we facin' towards Mecca
You got an album in the stores, but the hood don't respect ya
You's a bitch ass nigga, why would we accept ya
Anyway, I'm windows up tact out with the mini kay
Thugged the fuck out, but the bitches love us anyway
My whip so dope, it ain't really much I gotta say
Let the top down, in the town with my partner Kay
Know you see The Jack cuz he who the real mobstas play
Somethin' in my lap knock ya cap off a block away
I ain't playin' in these streets, I'm tryna take ya life away

[Hook]
I'm just a gansta (I'm just a gansta man)
Who's caught up in the game (Who caught up in the game)
I'm just a gangsta (I'm just a gangsta)
I guess some things will never change (Some things'll never change)
