[Verse 1]

Ipod in my ride, ain't no head set
Ya girl in the front seat giving me head-sex
My nig in the backseat yelling out he's next
We be in the p-jects eating like T-rex
Smoking kush heavy, never seen no cess
Till I left the west, greatest alive, but you ain't seen my best
I ain't reached my goal yet but you still upset
You know my face nigga, you know my silhouette
You know why I'm here, the real niggas' champ
The real world love the J cause I'm more than rap
He got a punchline or two but he ain't the Jack
When I was born niggas left me hanging like a bat
Only out at nighttime with a jaw full of crack
Crack spitters you know
Go hard at the trap, drug dealer fasho
And how I carry myself, is really starting to show
So I marry the life, and keep this shit on the low...

Know what I'm saying? Jack

(hook)

It feel good to me
Maybe it's the hood in me
Maybe I should leave it alone
Maybe I should give it away
Really it's what's making me strong
Clearly it's what's making me stay...

It feel good to me
Maybe it's the hood in me
Maybe I should leave it alone
Maybe I should give it away
Clearly it's what's making me stay

[Verse 2]

I'm late night in the Cadillac, drinking purple sipping Yac
Caught up in the life, got this rap shit on my back
If you seen my life yeah, crown ya boy for living that
Brought up in a house full of mice and them insects
Seen it all done it all, cuddy I been that
Nigga that you see, add the Jack to your friends list
Never get enough of me, I was in Italy
View through the hard times, follow Allah's signs
I'm ready to die trying, I was in the Range
Daydreaming I was flying, they say they better than Jack
They dreaming, them niggas lying; they wish they was high as I am
All the time hating on me, boy you'll never shine

(hook)

[Verse 3]

100 racks got a nigga feeling amped as fuck
Slapping Messy Marv, smoking like that's wassup
Wasn't open at the liquor store, holding it up
Made him give me all his scrill, then I opened his guts
I was thinking bout my kids, they future and growing up
I was thinking bout them years, fuck court, I'm never showing up
I never see my niggas again, I'm on the run
It ain't never been easy is what they tell me
And it'll never be either, smoking tree to take a breather
With a felon; we hella deep Golden Gate chilling
Everybody selling D, and it's all in front of children
Shoot-outs everyday, chips falling from my building
At the same time it's the place that I live in
So I send my grace for every taste when I'm eating
The streets got me fresh, mothafuckas think I'm cheating
I'm a king boy, I've never been beaten of all time
I suggest you fall back, close your eyes and relax
Before you in your scrape with your brains in your lap

(hook)
