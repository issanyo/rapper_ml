[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Just like the Shower Posse
My niggas do a hit off a Kawasaki
Salat times, still go n pray beside my ahki
23 bodies, all I wanted was a Maserati
Pull up to the after hours, we ain't tryna party
Pickin' up them bands while your girlfriends count 'em for me
I just laugh cause you guys is funny
Drum in your face, no place to hide your money
Any time I did that is cause they had it comin'
Bubb doin' time in the Max. he never ask for nothin'
Lil thugs coppin' from Jack, I don’t tax 'em nothin'
If you ever try double back, I smack you with the Russian
Slow down and get walked out
Have you ever seen a clown chalked out
Hit you and don't kill you, man that don’t count
You want respect in here then don't smile

[Hook: Freeze]
I got eyes in the back of my head
Its real rules to the game
When you after this bread
It's the Mob (?)
My price is my price
I drive a hard bargain
I don't need no bitch, I get the chop barkin'
Worldwide we in places you'll never see
I get tired sometimes but I never sleep
Born a leader, I don't the world prepared for
I’m a boy, that's somethin' you'll never be

[Verse 2: Berner]
More money more killers Ima keep around me
Bullet proof Range, you can keep the Audi
Keep it cloudy, smoke tough Mendocino County
Have my pockets fat no (?)
Fed hot, Conspiracy is a cold charge
Playin' with that girl got my nose clogged
In and outta state I sold weight
New car, fresh off the lot with no plates
I'm tryna make a move
Rollin' Y, the shit you brought to burn got no taste
What you know about a quick trip real double
I’m talking 42 for the outdoor Bubba
Yea when the outdoor hits it's like I hit the lotto
I got Cherry Pie, Y, and some new Gelato
I bring my own smoke out to Colorado
25 pounds and the fully auto

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freeze]
I tell a sucka he ain't fly like I'm fly
And I'm smokin' on the best, you ain't high like i’m high
Black on black shit pullin' up, it’s the Mob
Open up the door we emerge from the clouds
You looking at a king, Egypt is where I get it from
Malcolm with the (?) for the truth I’m just gettin' some
I shine in the dark like some VS1’s
Childhood, innocence gone, what did he become
Went from the pupil to the teacher just by livin' some
My niggas locked (?), I’ma send 'em some
But you only get a couple options when you livin' wrong
Rollin' Jack-Hammers tippin' bottles in my living room
I’m the MCM on your girl Instagram
MCM luggage catchin' flights I'm a business man
I unlocked my potential then I built the brand
I’m a boy you can't get close enough to to shake my hand

[Hook]
