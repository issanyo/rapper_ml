[Verse 1: The Jacka]
In first class sippin' straight syrup
On a 10 hour flight non-stop to Europe
Fast shout to my dawgs from Prague and Zurich
Posted in the fog make it hard on every tourist
When the time tryin' find out what my fur is
Its a lion my designer fine cause I'm fearless
Niggas leanin' out they mind but we straight killers
Have a meeting then divide with the gang pillage
Weed for the lames but I drain with the real hittas
Split the sea for the yae, counting payers like painkillers
Never see MOB gone spoken like a strange language
30 gang bangers copping coke out of plane hangers
Bitches hoping that we change cause the game dangerous
I keep picking at they brain till they way changes
We got famous they still love us cause we stay gangsters
Not just gettin high, thank Allah everyday because
