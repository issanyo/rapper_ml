[Intro: Husalah]
I want to be a husalah (husalaahh)
Yeah, yeah, biotch yeah
Oh shit dis shit slap cuddy
I ain't gon' lie this shit knock, you feel me?

[Verse 1: Husalah]
Yo yo yo ever since I was a young nigga, I want to be a husalah
Playin' hella slap in my candy painted drop
I used to love vogues, now them fours mollywop
'73 caprice drop, coke white guts, dumb knock
Nigga when I slide up the block, I see the hoes choose
Niggas get mad and smirk, cause they know these niggas'll get the blues
When the .223's a get spittin' out the 'K
Make way for the H-U-S A, L-A-H, out da gate, they got nerve nigga
I'm like Mcdonald's over 12 million niggas served
So get your nerves blew the back out ya face
Get the fuck out my face, you'll get clapped by the 'K

[Chorus: Husalah]
I know you wonderin when the mob gon' stop
They see they main girls on the side of my drop
I told her don't talk to me bitch talk to my cock
And if yo nigga got problems then talk to my chop
I come around the corner in my '73 drop
It's coke white top and you know it's dumb knock
Ya girl, and she ridin' in my drop
If you got a problem with me nigga just talk to my chop

[Verse 2: Husalah]
Talk to my chop nigga have a conversation
When them .223's they, a get to separatin'
The left side of ya chest from the right side
I'ma catch a nigga with a left from the blind side
Sleep a nigga, run through his pockets
Hop in my 350 rocket and drop the top and just rock it
I don't give a fuck, yeah nigga, it's young Husalah, Husalah
Gettin' stupid dumb retarded and I'm geese on suckas
I'm a beast, a husalah, a true life nigga
Not an internet thug, I get two paws nigga
Then I flip on the four, then I flip at ya eight
Then I flipped at the twenty now ya nigga livin' great
Even though I got this five piece Fed time
I don't give a fuck I'm countin' money on my bed time
Talkin' on my mobile against my skin tone
While ya bitch tellin' me she all alone
She want me come over and bone, I told her bitch
I kept talkin' shit, 'cause I really think the piece of shit bitch is ugly
Trust me, the bass is bumpin', ya face is bumpin', bitch don't say nothin'
I don't write raps so I just make knocks
My pockets all green like ya girlfriends twat
I'm ridin in my, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, I love my car, I love my car

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Yeah I'm from the mob figz, I believe you know me
Gangsta's and husalah's, we neva get no sleep
24 all the time, when I make my money back
I'ma need anotha nine yeah, a nine piece for the girl snorters
The whole hood orders, whole ones, half thangs and quarters
Bitch niggas and police never seem to notice, but they seem to know us
Fuck niggas stand near but they all below us
Hopin' one day you'll be here but you still a owe us
A hundred rounds inside your house ya kids'll never grow up
I'm smokin' real shit nigga that'll make you throw up
Up chuck, ya wife gettin' butt fucked, by a wolf that's hungry as hell
You let the mess talk now we on you for real

[Pre-Chorus]
We on your head nigga for real though I'm not even gonna lie, yo yo yo
Jack and Hus, shower posse them my cuddy's the V and the V done hooked up we getting' money
And girl like Hus say ya face is far from lovely
I ain't even gon' lie ya face is hella ugly

[Chorus: Husalah]
I count a hundred thousand in my backroom
I show niggas how my gat boom
These niggas hate me cause beautiful
But I keep two guns as usual

[Verse 4: The Jacka]
I slide through stickin' in my mufuckin' drop
You fuck niggas wonder when the mob gon' stop
But I'm off top, I got coke, I got hop
My strap don't lock and it's one in the hole, ya done in da cold
See the steam come off ya dome? I come off the dome, I come off like I'm stoned
Made 60 thou' off a single clone, spend 30, leave 30 alone
We connects face to face no cellular phone
I hope that ain't ya girlfriend we been sellin' her holmes
Feel me? It's trill boy
