[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I'm with, Berner & Liqz
Drum on my shit
Shots make you hurdle your fence
Murderin' since, the park bench
Shells spark, leavin' marks in the darkness
No contest, we ill, not complex
See the smoke twirl, your girl is obsessed
With nice sized breasts
Buy a verse from the Don, but my rhymes' priceless
I bet you wanna be rich, then tuck away your pride
Never let your eyes rest
You better be the quietest, cause we cop a couple times
Double back & tie you up nigga

[Hook]
And they keep looking for
A place called home
And they keep looking for
A place called home

[Verse 2: Berner]
My blow is so nice
The house with grow lights
Mud no ice, been up for four nights
Sleep, not me, I've been on more flights
All white stones, a Benz with floor lights
More cheese, set traps for more mice
Talk to the man, I’m snatchin' your life
I'mma give 'em what they really want
3 Xans, 20 grams got me really on, bring it home
Baby made eleven G’s, Mitchell Brothers at a century
Live forever, nah, I never leave, I'm out here
New warehouse so there'll never be a drought here
Weed goin' legal everywhere, I still cash out
Sellin' picks and shovels, yeah, I'mma play the background
Let 'em try, I’mma breed more
When it come to good weed, yeah, they'll always need more
Uh

[Hook]
And they keep looking for
A place called home
And they keep looking for
A place called home

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
They call me wonder worldwide I gotta get it
Last train to Christiania I just bought a ticket
Made another ticket now I’m about to go and flip it
The law is behind us I pray I only get a ticket
Or maybe he just wanna compliment my cany paint
I’m not a saint but never made a dollar off of hate
You can do it too don't let nobody say you can't
I pray I don't get too consumed in my quest for bank
Now I’m back like your grand daddy's hairline
The only time I grab palms is for prayer time
My only focus is dollar signs and (?) my time
Pimp C on my mind, I gotta hold it down
I got my shooter on my side I'm tryna calm him down
Mix the cookie and satellite to ease the mind
Most time your biggest enemy is in your mind
The only time I feel at home is out on the grind, gettin' it

[Hook]
And they keep looking for
A place called home
And they keep looking for
A place called home
