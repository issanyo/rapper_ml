[Verse 1: The Jacka]
(Mob...Dot..Jack)
Yo, bump that Mob everywhere
Wake up in the trap and all my niggas right there
Everybody love me now
Cause I bust my strap when everybody right there
Goddamn nightmare, thugs in that night air
Love when that white here, up in that white lair
I'm here, hoes near, Hermes, Cashmere
(?)
Christian Vuitton I want that pair
That shirt, that sweater and I was overseas life can't get better
No way that you can go with me if you don't got cheddar
But if you in the M.O.B you gon' do it forever
