[The Jacka]
Smacked her in the face with my right hand
She said she'll never call The Man
That was a damn lie my PO called me
Told me to stop by (ha ha)..
Smacked her in the face with my right hand
She said she'll never call The Man
That was a damn lie my PO called me
Told me to stop by heard it in his tone it wasn't to say hi
Every since then I been on the run huh truly tryna over stand the keys to survive
Probably end up in the can, damn I'm getting tired but never turn myself in

[Stephen Marley]
She said how could you treat me this way
What we had was more than words can say
Two times the echos of my end
That dont know where else this love I'll find
She's fed up.. She's fed up..
She's fed up.. She's fed up..

[J Diggs]
I do it movin' my lifestyle's elusive
She say my wicked ass ways is abusive
I say she useless she called me a dead beat
I slapper her once now I think she scared of me
Once upon a time she used to be my Bonnie bitch
Now our relationship is strictly on some money shit
She over it, she tired and she fed up I told her I was sorry and she can go and keep ya head up

[Stephen Marley
She said our relationship needs overstanding
And sometimes Steve you're just too demanding
Well I can't help this feeling that I get
Lord I wonder if I will regret
