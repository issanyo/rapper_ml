[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I wrote sixteen bars behind sixteen bars
And I came home to only sixteen large
Just niggas from the streets but they treat us like (?)
Something like Osama this choppa is our bodyguard
But was nothing like Obama no presidents in Islam
Our presence will soon be known, our enemies will be gone
Never go where I'm from they welcome you with a drum
They try to resist now but soon they'll overcome
Send 'em straight to hell a thousand shells had 'em overwhelmed
All my niggas cold as hell empty out reload again
You couldn't fix this shit with a couple (?)
Now every killer in the city getting paid to gun you down
Remember hundred in the chop nigga every time I come around
Beefing with The Jack nigga soon you'll be in the ground
(?) even though they know my style
This dope and this hundred round like twins they both loud
Mean mug frown that hunnid round only thing that smile
So many witnesses die we rarely seen trial
We should never try kill you well nigga unless you seen (?)
But I'm all about brilliance made thousands off greenhouses
Stacks and Young Naj made thousands off a green couch
And we won't never go to sleep but we leaned out
Had us doing bad till a real nigga reached out
He showed us to the bread but couldn't show us wheres it's peace fount
