[Hook: The Jacka]
I know you see me right here everytime you drive by
But truth to admit you don't ever ask why
You know I got paper cus I'm a D-Boy
You my B-Girl, glamorous lifestyle
Rocks on the wrist big things nice car
You wana live life with a rich rockstar
Everybody know us, everybody know ya'll
I think I'm a a rush so I probably never call

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Why you tryna front girl, you know you ain’t ready
I be in the hood every day with my family (yee)
We the mafia, summer love gon get me
I’m an animal, most of my clothes don’t fit me
Hanging off my ass, but we pull up in a Bentley
Nobody ever laugh cause we always been the niggas
All I ever wanted was to see what was in ya
I’m the Jack, ice cold mack from the Figaz
Locked in the county, shared my cell with a killer
All he ever said was Jack, I never heard a nigga realer
Fat shout out to the four XIV gorillas
All my niggas doing life, do what I can to make it better

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
You know you love the Jack, I'm right here
Bout to dip out, set my Six in gear
See the tree smoke, ain't no tints on there
Tryna find the Hus nigga, all white pair
Of the Gucci Loafs but they never know where
Go pop my new shit, hop in the Chev
Sit so mothafuckin high it ain't fair
Never seen my clothes before, and my shoes rare
You could hit the mall, but you never find em there, no
Waiting on the jump-off yeah, yeah
'Bout to make a drop-off yo, yo
This block shit is all I know, know

[Verse 3: Andre Nikatina]
My lifestyle baybee lika a S500
Gather up yo friends jump in and I'm a gun it
Then give me 10 minutes and mah Glock talk hit yah
Andre Nickatina in yo camera phone picture
I watch as the wheels rotate, Break down a 8th
The color of ma sneaker is the color of my face
I wear my wife beater like a banga
My rapstyle freak got one up in the chamba

[Hook:]
I know you see me right here everytime you drive by
But truth to admit you don't ever ask why
You know I got paper cus I'm a D-Boy
You my B-Girl, glamorous lifestyle
Rocks on the wrist big things nice car
You wana live life with a rich rockstar
Everybody know us, everybody know ya'll
I think I'm a a rush so I probly never call

[Hook: x2]
You know I got paper cus I'm a D-Boy

Rocks on the wrist big dreams nice cars
You know I paper cus I a D-Boy
