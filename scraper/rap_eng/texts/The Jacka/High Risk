Still we on some fly shit
Dopest rappers alive no matter who you try get
My nigga Gov called me from the clink
Told me that they gave him 29 I was in disbelief
You niggas trynna shine we'll hope we never disagree
Rhymes so dope we out our minds at this degree
Sometimes I ask myself is this for me
Got so much cheddar seems like everybody's pissed but me
I come from the Rich 2-6 where we pitch for cheese
Got 200 rubber bands you (?) my friends wish for these
Tried to dead a beef that didn't fix with ease
When trynna make it in this shit you gotta mix with (?)
