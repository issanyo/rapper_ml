[Verse 1]
Come around with the windows down
Two 22s comin' at your ass so loud
You can run but you'll never get passed those rounds
So serious you'll never get passed my style
You'll never last unless you follow me and my crowd
We'll always last 'cause the people lovin' our sound
Feel good today, tonight won't remember a thing
Just know I'll murder every nigga you bring
Real nigga mayne, all I remember is pain
Cocked the hammer back point it at you take everything
That's my life that's my name that's how I got on
White tee, blue jeans, nike, Desert E showin'
Treacherous places that you'll never be goin'
Leavin' Las Vegas, caught a ticket, I was snowed in
Really with the shit for real, my nigga, I'm assaultin'
Planes drop our mothafuckin' kicks in the ocean
My kids'll never know that I supply coke smokers
It's what I tell myself but it ain't really hard to notice, no

Automatic start on the suicide
Fully auto on my lap, tonight it's do or die
Open up the garage and reverse the ride
I'm powdered up, and the kush and the blunt got me stuffed
Cause to black that boy, it makes it hard to stop
Pulled up, gun poppin', and we pulled out molly woppin'
Us, doing time in the fed, another album dropping
Cheese on the bread, a hundred g's on your head
Cell phones in the cell they said, "We know we eating slow", yup
I huddled up my team and we had to make the first step
Either the foreign or the vintage on them 26's
Stickin in that nickel, champagne and pourin' liquor
He yellin "murder, don't hurt him" turn my family on the walk
He said police just burnt him and he's wanted for some bodies
Got the Chevy pulled over and he thinking that its over, but a 1000 dead and running, tell him meet me at the headquarters

[Chorus]
Mister Miyagi, black, and tati on the dashboard
Smoking songs of the Barney pressing fast forward
Two minutes early to meet papi at the corner store
Ain't knowing when I turn, but I'm taking the same corner though, nigga
We'll break you off
Bad times looking back and I'm trying to break 'em off
But I'm a careful nigga
You're a stranger to the pain that I've felt, my nigga

[Ampichino]
Posted in the trap house, nigga
I answer the backdoor with my Mac out
If ya try and make a false move then I black out with ya
100 racks around my neck, I got the mind of a killer
A man dies and a child is born
My nigga Smoke came home, I'm headed off to the war
6 months in the can, I'm just a number
Made 16, but I missed a whole summer
A nightmare trying to reverse dreams
The feds caught my niggas in a reverse sting
Knowledge is power, trying to rebirth kings
But money is power so we re-up mean
Cream by the truckload, it came off a ton boat
Start getting money you owe niggas a ton, cut-throat
Ain't that a bitch, I gotta nail 'em
I ain't never switch, all I did was try and help 'em

[Chorus]
Mister Miyagi, black, and tati on the dashboard
Smoking songs of the Barney pressing fast forward
Two minutes early to meet papi at the corner store
Ain't knowing when I turn, but I'm taking the same corner though, nigga
We'll break you off
Bad times looking back and I'm trying to break 'em off
But I'm a careful nigga
You're a stranger to the pain that I've felt, my nigga

[Fed-X]
Back to back Chevys with the Hemis in it
Yea, we been offenders
But gotta live until I die with the semi, lifted, humble
By me, Hindu kush, crossing city limits
Stand up, moving up, can't be sitting timid
Off that XO Remy mixed with sadity women
100,000 dollar cash, plus the GT tinted
Cash on deck, you see me in it
Plasma TVs in it, let my BG get it
And if my BGs (?), my BGs spend it 'til my BGs (?) it
And my GT engine got see through vision like Calico vision (yep!)
Dawg, he looking at life (?) and (?) to touch
Feds coming, re-up papers, I'll see you Hush
Speed it up, be in my crib, the streets is cold
Half money, half heart, yea I see you, folk
