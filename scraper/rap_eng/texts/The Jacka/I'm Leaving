[Verse 1: Blahk Jesus]
They always say you have heart you have money over anythin' else
Some of my best friends is heavers, they'll take your breath
As I march through the valley in this shadow of the death
Wonderin' why I'm standin' right here by myself
Glock .40 with the 30 close to my hip
Louis Vuitton bag full of them ruffles, no 'tato chips nigga
Though I miss my nigga Tato Chip nigga
Kill one of you pussies that hang out on my strip nigga
Bang, gun language we still talkin'
Who knew your next step you'd be in the coffin
My Backwood full of Kush cause i'm still coughin'
Murder anythin' that come close or even cross us

[Interlude]
4 officers down and the suspect is dead
It is a grizzly scene on the streets of East Oakland today
These are live Sky 7 HD pictures of the scene
Where police entered the apartment around 1 o'clock this afternoon
It happened in 7600 block of MacArthur Boulevard near 74th Avenue
And ABC's 7 Leslie Brinkley is close-by but is very late

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Niggas say they want the line but really they don't need to know
Cop from the connect and tie him up like an even score
Never heard of me before? Numb cause I'm breathin' snow
My niggas in the back paranoid cause they breathin' dro
Never been to school in they life, they need me to grow
Mob shit, militant now but was a beast before
Streets full of ex-coke dealers who didn't reach they goal
Mean streets, iron in his jeans before he leaves his home
He say he love us but he'll leave again once he gets on
To another hood to mislead the youth with his evil tone
Over the money look what we've become
My only wish is to free my niggas and flee the slums
Jewels go over your head cause I've intrigued with drums
Nixon make him lock his door, now they need our songs
Yeah, the same way the fiends need a stone
I'm not braggin' on my cards Allah forgive us all
