[Intro]
You know
It’s kinda fucked up but
It’s kinda like you’re born to lose, you know what I mean?
Steady young, get your own nigga
Coke boy
Montana

[Hook]
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at
Bring your love baby, I’mma bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby, I’mma bring my pain
You already know that
All this money I be staring at
All this money I be staring at

[Bridge]
I don’t know what’s worse
To never get it
Or get it and lose it
You know what I mean? it’s sanctuary baby
You know they say
It’s the game of life
And you don't get to play it twice
Juuheard?

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I lived a hell of a life, sellin' them kicks
Copped from the Mex twice and ran off with hella their shit
Blood shot a nigga, saved my life, I'll never forget it
There's never been a time I shot a nigga that I will regret
Real niggas you never heard of, had to murder and never be rich
Never heard of me in the beef gotta war to be fixed
Suckas say they Mob, I knocked 'em down, brought some order to this
Just a real nigga who was born and brought up in this
Niggas say they had it bad, we was poor and fought to exist
Niggas go the flow of the globe, was taught to resist
Resist, resilient, every thought brilliant
Ay yo, this beat is like my enemy, I just wanna kill it
Couple hundred million, I'm about to feel it
Livin' with my niggas, show 'em how I did it
Spend everything you make cause the grave you soon visit
Rest in peace V12, I'm on a wave (?)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Head shot, didn't die
God got a plan for you
Bounce back, hit the block
OG got them grams for you
Did it on your own, nobody gave a hand to you
Now you hot, spitting bars, shows 30 grand for you
God protect the child that can hold his own
Almost lost it all for everything he own
Put that on everything
Thought I knew it all but I ain't know anything
Did it with my dawgs, Had to get my weight up
Pick the K's up
100 round homie lift your braids up
Never put my legs up
I’m working now, it’s working out
They wonder how
Hundred miles running nigga gunning till the sun is out
