[Intro: The Jacka]


[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Do time, come home, & be a made nigga
Or wake up starin' to the eyes of a paid killer
I’m starin' in your eyes while you starin' down the barrel of a .45
I’m in the 'Maro with a fearless mind
Sick thoughts, blowin' trees tryin' not to cough
Tryin' not to knock you off
So nigga show me where the soft
Show me where the cheese and I'm off
Blend in to the darkness
All my life I just wanted to be the largest
No regards for the law
Knockin' shots at the sergeant just for feelin' what I saw
Erry time I ride around
The reality hit, get rich or kill a nigga tryin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Berner]
I’m solid under pressure, you gonna buckle for sure
Half a kilo tucked in my bunk, while I'm on tour
I’m pissin' gold Rosay, last night was a blur
Three or four pills get to makin' me slur
She wanna choose, she'll loose if I leave her alone
I heard she ran through the crew and she ain't even a hoe
Hot shell makes your skin melt, will leave you below
The ground rottin' in the coffin, drunk drinkin' patron
My .45 stay clean, it won't jam up at all
I'm lookin' at a dead man, we clap back at the law
We bounce back every single time a package is lost
Playin' with my money (?) ain't laughing at all
I got you starin' down the barrel of a .45

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Jack]
Got you starin' down the barrel of a .45
Tied up the wishes of another life
You can get the business with my .45
High out my mind, swervin' in & outta lanes
Too drunk to drive, hope I make it home alive
I probably kill myself cause it's hard to survive
These niggas talkin' shit 'til the chrome arrive

[Verse 4: Berner]
I'ma air this bitch out, smell the gun smoke, cut throats
Sixteen when I learned to cut coke, eyes low
(?), (?), Tell me I’m not on
When I pull up with three or four bitches on my arm
And the shots from my .45 sound like a bomb
I'm just tryna live, will they miss me when I’m gone
C'mon
