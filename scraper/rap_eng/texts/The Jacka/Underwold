[The Jacka]
I control the Yay, but I can't control today
Carry your soul away, when you cross the Jack your soul you have to pay
I control the Kay, you wanna control the Bay
But we not listenin', we can't hear you when you whisperin'
Speak louder, You's a coward you ain't out here nigga
We been out here since the winter, we'll be here when it return
In the hood all the time, that's a place you're not concerned
Man we had it, with you and your career
When you come back home, we won't be here
Where did you go? Seems like forever since you been gone
Hop in my super coupe, all I did was shoot the truth
All my life real nigga mislead youth
I was breezin' through, believed in you all my life
Supplyin' the water, is there a heaven for a mobster?
Probably not so nigga stand back and watch a
Killer knockin' choppas straight into the cop cars
Standin' by Allah with the Nation of Islam
Make Salat with our guns, keep a hundred in the drum
Niggas stranded in the slums

[Hook]
It ain't never been easy
For me it's just been crazy
Look what the world gave me
But it'll never break me
The Underworld outside your home
That's where I came up on my own
This what I'm dealin' with all the time
This where a nigga fell in love with crime
That place ain't never been easy
For me it's just been crazy..
