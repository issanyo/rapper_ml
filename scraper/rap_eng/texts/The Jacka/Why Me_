[Verse 1: Scotty Deuce]


[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Heard drugs kill but we tried em still
Wanna live for ever? Never ride a wheel
Death to every rapper tryna bite our skill
Body for a feature, me & Scotty ill
30's on a 7-8 Bonneville
Put the weed out, bout to make my grill
You ain't heard of that then you not my nigg
And heard of that we murder cats just so I could live
Kill for the hood so you can walk through there
They shot (?) and for you he won't walk again
Now everywhere we go i'm proud to walk him in
You never stood up for the low we'll never talk again
If you in The Mob you a hell of a nigga
But if you get a nigga time I could never forgive you
Was just 9 in '89 sellin' Yayo for my siblings
Success was on my mind not Yale or Princeton
Except that this Islam tryna shield the whisper
Every obstacle I've climbed, all hail the victor
No time for my health but hope I live forever
But no time for myself is how I got it together
