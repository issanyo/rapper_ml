[Verse 1: Joe Blow]
30 in my .40, 50 up in the chop
In this game I got a buzz like 50 when he was shot
In this rap shit I'm over I'm like a Biggie or Pac
And my young nigga with me ain't scared to give it to cops
You can get this street-smart at a 20 year college
The AR with me, and I ain't talkin' 20 or Knowledge
Fuck Twitter it's real life, I got a million followers
Before I ever had money, I had a million problems
So I'm smokin' on this new wave, ridin' in ya favorite Euro
A living legend when I die they'll probably paint a mural
My passport stamped from flying all the way to Europe
With my bottom bitch done hit all-states like insurance
All I know is guns money and drugs
While all these niggas talkin' swag be the bummiest ones
On Instagram flexin' with a hundred coverin' some ones
We the real fuckin' MOB, we don't fuck wit you punks

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Niggas in the way and they girlfriends curious
But we from The Bay we don't take girls serious
But get yourself together cuz' she sees that you mirror us
Get you some Italian leather or don't ever say you were fresh
Spent a band on a brick drunk a 8 then I moved the rest
Caught up in the chicken, what would you do if you were us
Rockin' up pigeons only time that we use the pot
You should kill yourself the bitches notice you lose a lot
Sip a pint a day but tell the doc I don't use a lot
Rappers hate on me until the day that they lose they spot
I been sellin' yay, you under paid now look whose on top
Damn you from Sembrani, 30 shots under the e-lock
6 ARs it ain't shit just to take a trap
600 shots ain't no way to protect ya now
