[Intro]
(Oh baby baby babyooh jack)
Yeeee yeeee yeee!

[Verse 1]
It's your turn, now it's on me
Plat around my wrist, on my hips a chrome thing
Steal from your mother cause shes a coke fiend
Got rich overnight it all started from a dream
Introduce me to your wife, now that's the wrong thing
Got chicks everywhere every time my phone rings
It's a light skin thing, or maybe it's a dark one
Got so many whips I can't remember where I park one
Celebrate everyday my childhood was a harsh one
But I'm back now, 20 G stacks in my pocket
Mob figa chain and your girl wanna rock it
Mob figa lawyers, accounts and stock markets
Make a million dollars while you other rappers targets

[Hook]
And all the girls say, say say (Jack)

[Verse 2]
This ain't P. Diddy making the band
This a G in the P City waving my hand
On the stage while the crowd in rage a skeet skeet
God damn ask lil' mama over there why she playing
I see you peeking but you ain't speaking
I'm from the bay but I hit LA every weekend
She said she Cuban but I thought she was Puerto Rican
Fired up the purple and the gals start geekin'
I guess it's been a while since a treal nigga been around
Bend her down jeah it was real spontaneous
She not the smartest chick but she got brains ma nigg

[Hook]
And all the girls say, say say (Jack)

[Verse 3]
Stop at the light let the screens do a hunid
Leave the hoes in a daze for a second then gun it
Up the block one time for ma niggas out there
TVs in the scraper let the whistle pipes blare
Can't see where you at but they hear you everywhere
22s on the van, shock em with the 5th wheel
Beat slappin so hard giving niggas the chills
Running all you hoes to drill, never popped pills
But I pop suckas with the steel, self-made millionare
You say it's on to get a deal, you really just a square
Try to compete with a playa but it'll never work
I'm a rich mothafucka I never work

[Hook]
And all the girls say, say say (Jack)
