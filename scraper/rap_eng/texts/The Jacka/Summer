[The Jacka]
High speed chases my nigga just take em' on one
Drunk and numb bet I still shake em', my niggas all young
God damn years we be facing time we done all done
Facing getting high in my Spaceship bracing The All 1
I'm in space, everyday we be breaking the law some
Makes a lot, everyday we be praisin' Allah bruh
Life's crazy yea, it was crazier in the 80's yo
Made me stress laid him to rest drinkin' the pain away
Hooked to every drug in the book the pain don't go no where
I'm a crook it's all in my look, check out the clothes I wear
Come into my life, my nigga one day I'll take you there
You never thought.. These crackers'll try and give you life you
You never thought you'd clap you a nigga, just trying to make shit right
I'm NASA fast on the spaceship trying to control my life

[ Chorus]
Summer don't love me no more (x4)

This for my niggas who go knocked in the winter, say he was locked for the summer, weekly often exchange then he got ratted on by a runner, now he reminiscin' on gold hundred spokes without a lick of chrome. Present for every 4th of July that's what he depend' on.. Damn he missed the summer jam, he be who all the bitches on, shine brighter than them niggas on the stage singin' songs [lalala]. The sun rays use to darken' his skin tone but he ain't seen the sun and many moons since he been gone and he feeling like.. like the summer don't love him but that winter was even colder when the feds came to rush him.. Like damn..! Summer don't love me no more...

[Chorus]
Summer don't love me no more (x4)

[The Jacka]
Hopped out behind the steel, I might take your life
Pay me still or I'ma squeeze nothing to think about
Getting scrill, hang with the G's, that's all I think about
Hopped in just trying to win pulling them bangas out
You look like your ready to scream so I'ma tape your mouth
While real niggas locked in the pen and all the fake ones out
I see you, you don't see, I'm staking out your house
Bout to run in there with some niggas that's killin' and they proud
