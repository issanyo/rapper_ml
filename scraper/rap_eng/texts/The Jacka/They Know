[Intro]
Mob, ayy
Reign, Jack
(?)
If that shit nigga...ayy
You 'member this shit
'Member? Listen


[Hook]
Niggas say they dope because they out they mind
Hunnid niggas on the block we doin' crime
Suckas hate on Jack cause now they movement die
My niggas still get rich same time they doin' time
I talk about my chop like it's the only kind
We livin' our life fast because it won't rewind

[Verse]
My young bulls they coke suppliers
Your bulls been gay like (?)
We got guns cause we about the violence
And we drive fast cars we don't stop for sirens
Don't gotta go to a zoo know I got the llama
Cup full of glue, die for my patna
We burn the spot up somethin' like Osama
Not enough shots in a damn revolver
But if it's all that you got it's a problem solver
If a nigga get (?)
Niggas slide through the spot and forget to call you
Better pray to Allah that the young bulls thought of ya
I got killas and bulls straight out the Noya
Pull they guns out and forget they know ya
Ill ass niggas come from California
If they wanna knock you down they'll never warn ya
Snitch niggas in the ground we'll never mourn ya
Pullin' canons out they don't wave 'em on ya
Bitch ass niggas won't make the morning
30 in yo face I'll say good morning

[Hook] (x2)
Niggas say they dope because they out they mind

Suckas hate on Jack cause now they movement die
My niggas still get rich same time they doin' time
I talk about my chop like it's the only kind
We livin' our life fast because it won't rewind
