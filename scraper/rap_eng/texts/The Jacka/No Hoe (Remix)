[Verse 1: E-40]
E-40
You know, E-4, he don't give a fuck about no hoe, or no bro, no homo
They hating on my mojo, that's why I tote a 4.4. in [?]
I'm murking off this Lambi and I'm hoping I don't go though
Toto, sick with it, logo on my photo
I drive it like a stolo, tonight I got a show though and I'mma finna see some more though
If the po-po pull me over they gon' ask me for my photo (photo, photo)
ID, L's, yo-yo, cocoa, scale, yell, billy club, chokehold
If I need coke I'm gon' get it from my bro though
My black chick a 10 and my Latin is an ocho
My white bitch just so-so, my Asain is your hoe
I'm mobile, I'm global, I'm mogul, I'm local, not loco, but local
I'm crazy, I'm 4-0, like

D-Lo, he don't give a fuck about no hoe (no hoe, no hoe, no hoe, no hoe)

[Verse 2: D-Lo]
I don't care but the weather, but go get your rain coat (go, go, go, go)
It might get wet, but the money's still the same though
A ripper or your dame, damn the ripper's still the same though
She say she got powers, that's what you call a super
Pull them bitties out like Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl
It's D-Lo, you already know that I was in though
I'll mack a chick until she bow-legged or pigeon-toed
The black girl, the white girl, the Chinese, the Siamese
I need a quarter, I ain't messing with no dime-piece
You-booba-la-boopty, lil mama got booty
The mama's a groupy, but she riding a hoopty
Man I'm running through these hookers like Flava Flave
But I ain't looking for no love, I'm just trying to get paid
You can catch me in the East with my chopper in the hood
Like my brother Sleazy-D, I'd break Oprah if I could

[Verse 3: Beeda Weeda]
Oh yaaa
It's young Beeda Weeda, fuck 'em, don't feed 'em, I don't love 'em, I don't need 'em
Might just stuff 'em in the beamer, take 'em to the trap and leave 'em
Playing with my money, bitch you might just catch a beating
For real though, she already know though
Slap a bitch up and give a fuck about the po-po
Disrespect her daddy and she know that that's a no-no
Any type of weather she gone' be out on that hoe stroll
[?] in those hoe clothes, mini skirts with [?]
Catch them on the 4, by the check cash is stolo, ho though
D-Lo, you already know though
How we eat at [?] we get a lot of hoe dough
All she need is guidance and a little bit of promo
Still on Craigslist you a motherfucking dumbo
Sell it to the [?] girl bust them tricks
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch make me rich, BITCH

[Verse 4: The Jacka]
D-Lo, you already know though, he don't give a fuck about no nigga or no hoe though
Ride around solo, with a Glock 4-0
Come up out the club got your bitch in a chokehold, chokehold
If he get bread, make her come out as homo
Smack you in the head with the ass or the 4-0 (4-0, 4-0, 4-0, 4-0)
