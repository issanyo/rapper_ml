[The Jacka]
I remember the shit like it was yesterday
Gun blast, happened to fast for us to run away
Shit a nigga go through every time you put your gun away
I just pray, Inshalah, I'll get em' back some day
Might not be this month, or this year, but one day
I'll be the one to hear the last words you say
While your Gods feed the drum of the tommy aimed your way
Killers around me every day, fake gangstas when interrogated, easily stray
From the life of trill rap, 4 deep bendin' laps wit a concealed strap
Lil Scrap and T.I. called the hood a trap
I might be high, empty out a clip at my neighbor, then remain stuck to the strip, like fly paper
Remember me before I die, like fly gangsta, cuz I'm from the place where gunshots wake ya
The spot where a rock can take ya straight to the top
Where young nigs scrape the block, thirsty for murder
Where your mom smoke dope, but ya nigs won't serve her
I love this place, but one day I really hope to get further

[Husulah]
Ayo ayo, push up the pace tho
Now it's playdoh A1 Yayo
Fuck wit my guap it'll get mas feo, the opposite of my name Hus El Guapo
Pull up in the Mob slow, let the chop go, .22 treses out the AR 1 cinco
Psycho psycho,  twistin' crip and sippin' lean yo, niggas dippin' like Neo in the Matrix [?]
Pop em (pop em) on the spot, and slide off with my people
Dippin' (dippin') in the drop,  loadin' up for the sequel
The part 3, Hus is on the loose again (loose again)
Stupid again, loosin' it man
I ride up in that 4-door mobshotta, knockin' shots at the [?]
I'm a top shotta, bad man rock mobsta
The idiot in Italy with .45 shells and pasta
Yeah I feel I'm is, yeah I think I is
Niggas [?] time you think I did, not to mention the innocent bystanders I think hit
I know niggas doin' vida in the pinta rich

It's the same shit everyday, smash niggas out the way
Mobbin' every mothafuckin' time
It's the same shit everyday, smash niggas out the way
Mobbin' every mothafuckin' time
Big shit or .38s, blap niggas out the gates
Mobbin' every mothafuckin' time
