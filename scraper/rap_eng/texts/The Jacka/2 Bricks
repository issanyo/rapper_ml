These niggas runnin' 'round lost like they got no problems
Till I got 'em knocked off while they got massages
The new connect was  in shock so I killed him with kindness
I gave him back his shoes & strap he said I see you ma√±ana
I'm smokin' weed to ease my thoughts we drive around with bananas
All of my kids'll move to (?) none of 'em believe in Santas
But they all my biggest fans I pour a ten in a Fanta
I got a '70 Nov' and the seats are Majella
(?) they all know I'm a killer
A African, black man, but my fam is Brazilian
I know that's over your melon, my mother fled the Favela
We grew up poor, you know I know still owe you forever
My manager real bull, toured the world with a felon
Made more than doctors or a lawyer, all the soil I'm mailin'
Thumbed through all the scrolls then we split it in sections
Put you in the soil you don't keep your protection
You not a bull if you fall asleep in a session
Yankin' out my tool relieve you of your possessions nigga
