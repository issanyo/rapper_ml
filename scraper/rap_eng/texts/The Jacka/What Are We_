[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Can you remember bull must be war if you got your cannon on
9-4 face on the floor soon as the cannon drawn
Niggas straight thuggin' don't give a fuck when the game come on
Thumbin' through this chicken nothin' but killers in my livin' room
I need 30 bands a month till my children grown
I know the feeling's gone so i'm here to live it for 'em
I don't like rap unless you live your songs
But if you don't like Jack you haven't lived at all
Before you just hate why don't you give your all
Seems like you got all the answers but won't shock the world
36 dancin, we vampin, we on top of the world
30 in my cannon laughing with a drug dealers girl

[Hook: The Jacka]
Something in the way of me
Sometimes i wonder what what are we
Seems like there's something in my reach
But then it's not there when I find my way



[Verse 2: AOne]
