[Verse 1: Yukmouth]

Look
I beat the block like a terrorist
Them sick fiends need a doc I'm they therapist
Supply the people with diesel give em' they medicine
That Lambo hood got a ragin' bull like Merrill Lynch
It's like I'm heaven sent
Wings I forever had
Flyer than a helicopter no landin' pad
Hit the kush thinkin' back when I was sellin' crack
Mama was still alive and Papa he was sellin' smack
Goin' back and forth to jail selling hella' packs
Junior high back pack full of hella' raps
I could draw they thought I'd be a cartoonist but I rock with the music
Started my own movement
Luniz, Regime, Thug Lordz, I do's this
Drug dealer music like Flaka bitch I influence
Who else turned a drug deal into a record deal
Eighteen years later your nigga droppin' records still

[Hook: Mr. Probz)

Sometimes I don't wanna' wake up
Sometimes I jus' wanna close my eyes and drift off
Just me on my own
[Just me on my own]
They say that todays tear drop are tomorrows rainbows
I don't know
[I don't know]
Sometimes it gets better sometimes it gets worse
So just light up and blow
[So just light up and blow]
Tryna' make the most of all that comes and the least of all that goes
[Verse 2: C-Bo]

Huh, Check it
I'm on deck and they better respect it
I see the Tech gon' wreck shit till the clips ejected
That's on the set
You see the summer jam we wreck shit
Fuck around and get yo' silly ass whooped butt naked
You ever touch me that's some dead homies you dead homie
When shots pop off
Bullets fly at your head homie
Shots won't stop poppin' until you fed homie
Runnin' from my destiny in the State or the Feds homie
I won't stop pushing, call us the pusha' men
We pushing work until the whole squad pushin' Benz
The hood new I was thorough that's why they took me in
Mama new my chances in this world before she pushed me in
I won't cry, ran out of tears when lil' bro died
Mama looked me in the eyes and told me 'don't ride'
But in my mind I was thinkin' of homocide
Till my revenge it's no peace nigga

[Hook: Mr. Probz)

Sometimes I don't wanna' wake up

Sometimes it gets better sometimes it gets worse
So just light up and blow
[So just light up and blow]
Tryna' make the most of all that comes and the least of all that goes

[Verse 3: The Jacka]

Just made a million dolla's
And I ain't never had to put a bitch before my partna's
Got the real connect my hood never pushed garbage
Fuckin' with The Jacka
Gotta keep your skills polished
Really ran a trap I ain't never gotten [?]
Just hit a bank ain't a damn scratch on us
Got so many stripes you could bet your life on it
Runnin' through the night but recite in the mornings
Bring us to the light and off the dark road we're on
Got our hearts sick, hard to kick like heron'
Once was innocent then I bit this shit with my canines
Got my first taste now my prey just stay home
I come from the bay, no pain cuz' we stay on
(I come from the bay, no pain cuz' we stay on)
