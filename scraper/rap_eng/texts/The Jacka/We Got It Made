[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Drivin like I'm bulletproof
And  I ain't skydivin' if I pull a chute
Had him so bloody the nigga drew a group
So I disappeared like magic do
Had niggas shocked like static do
Lookin' in my rear, No Fear like skater clothes
Motherfuckas act sincere then they later fold
G-Boy just got 10 years, he ain't never told
Cause the sellers expect it
You niggas reppin' Mob then you better protect it
I always give back what the door collect it
My niggas so proud they don't wanna accept it
I leave it there anyway cause the pigs could hit any day
Me and Zy caught in a game to where you gotta pray
Teach my young daughters but I never seen my father pray
My grandfather, or my mother but my granny safe

[Hook: MDot80]
