[Hook: The Jacka]
Gametime, using dope and gettin rich at the same time
Everybody love us but we gangstas
All my best friends is on the main line
Doin time with killas cuz we gangstas
Look in my bloodshot eyes
Everybody love us cuz we gangstas

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
A million broads wishin they was my wife
But i'm in the Mob for the rest of my life
Remember lookin at my moms do her best to get by
So young sellin crumbs in the funk to get fly
Age 9, pure crime weed smoke in my eye
We hit a sto, i got away when mo got sent to the wire
That was my nigga, rest in peace, he just a memory now
Po' out some liquor, then we sit in front our enemy's house
Tamika was his sista and my first love
She died too so i made this line in memory of
I was 13 at the time, they had no moms n pops
30 rocks in our pants, trappin out they granny's spot
Parkside, P-World, dame lived down the block
Too young for the steering wheel, still we drove a lot
Old enough for high school now, but rather hold the spot
Fresh out, erry mothafucka made a whole one locked

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A-One]
Im cookin heron n chrys, at the same time
And pushin that d in the hallways
Speak bad on my name, i'll see ya where the frogs lay
One phone call, killaz come, andelay
When i cop the merchant be properly
Half white, half black like Goapele
If the shit not pure imma stop the play
Im gettin money in my sleep, even out the Bay
Sendin U.S. Mail, im talkin game time
If you talkin that yayo we on the same grind
30 bricks of act, they said it was a drought
I ain't seen one yet, you know what im about
Pull a forty out, potato on the mouth
Strip ya for ya safe, fuck ya lil main spouse
All i ever wanted wa 36 zips
So i went n copped that, then i made a mean flip
Started makin green then my whole team switched
AR 15 have ya whole team fixed
