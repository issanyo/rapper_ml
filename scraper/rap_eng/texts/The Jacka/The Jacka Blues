[Hook: The Jacka]
She call me all the time and I don't pick up my line
Cause there's a million on my mind
And I can't get left behind here

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
It's hard to just survive here
I would hate to waste my life here
They ask me am I blind well I overstand the signs near
I'm finally in my prime so I wonder wheres the time gone
Must be nice to wake in 5 stars
Finally overstand that I'm large
This for my friends behind bars
And the women and men that ride for us
And the women and men that died for us
Thank you for giving into this fly chorus

[Hook] [x2]
She call me all the time and I don't pick up my line
Cause there's a million on my mind
And I can't get left behind here

[Verse 2]
Just give me a chance, I know that it's tough
But when I get in, I never give up
Because I'm a man, I gotta live up
To everything that, I'm a part of
They call me The Jack but that ain't my gov
I'll tell you 'bout straps but I don't know love
I just know that if you a thug
You end up in jail or a puddle of blood
They speak about me but they don't know me
They never saw me but they don't doubt me
They know this shit real its too much detail
About the cell block and those key cells
I get wholesale you get retail
They keep me on top cause if i re(?)
I'll have all the guap cause I'm the hardest out
Put all my niggas on whether it's hard or soft

[Hook] [x2]
She call me all the time and I don't pick up my line
Cause there's a million on my mind
And I can't get left behind here
