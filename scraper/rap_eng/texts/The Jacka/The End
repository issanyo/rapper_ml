[The Jacka]
Think hard, what I'ma do
I need paper right now so I load up the Uz
Scrape the block dumb loaded and I'm lookin for niggas
It ain't really hard to notice we ain't dealin' with feelings
You can't hang around The Jack unless you witnessed a killing
And nobody know but you and your niggas
Partners doin' time, can't send them pictures
Cuz we so into crime, the feds wanna clip us
So, just write a rhyme and picture us richer
Your bail was declined you's a flight risk nigga
The reason why we light this nigga
Like I'll probably take his life cuz I don't like this nigga
I got hands I'm a man so I fight this nigga
When I win he still a bitch so I light this nigga
In the end..

[The Jacka]
No matter how hard I try
Ask Allah for forgiveness but we still gon' die
I can be successful and have enemies
Or be poor and have friends out here strugglin' with me
Never been here before, this the height of my life
Never seen this much dough, or this much white
Yeah my heart beatin' fast, but it's alright
Niggas in and out the crib, been like this all night
Got my momma out here stressin', cuz this ain't life
Left my lessons on the dresser, cuz I'm too high
Kaz I won't forget ya, free my nigga Ice
