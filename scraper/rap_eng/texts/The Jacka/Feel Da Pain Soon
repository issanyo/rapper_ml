[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Starin' at my problems through a Dolce & Gabbana lens
Kinks in our armor got me knocking down my patna friends
Slide up on our rivals throwing fire like soccer fans
Laying bursts all you see is red shirts like the Rockets playing
They wishing for our respect
They thought it was a lynching way we tied up the 'nect
I had her chasing next day buy a 'Vette
Like a movie have it quiet on your set
Mothafuckas snoozing till the day they don't wake up
Smack apartments with the Uzi cause they set my homeboy up
Jealousy, (?) cause they dug in the front
Shit we make is thunder pull alhamdulillah and take a bump
Hit you with the steel all you gon' feel is a thump
Rock with the  revolver steel long nose humpty hump
'norting 'caine put your house in pain if I make you jump
Twist your block Rubiks cube now a tube feed you lunch
Smoke so much weed can't read so I need to punch
I get you high but you gon' die as soon as you cross me once
Ride through state lines with my gun trying to get off a punt
It's our time other rappers cried this is what they want

[Hook: Ampichino]
Listen to our rhymes
You hear horror stories
Trapped between heaven and hell, this is purgatory
Murder him for me my nigga, then I owe you one
A soldiers story salute with a loaded gun
On the run, havin' fun I'll feel the pain soon
Locked in chains, for a hundred years, still remain cool
Never see your peers again, this is brain food
Raising your son over the phone might change you

[Verse 2: Ampichino]
The shock from the doc as he labeled me psychotic
But its ironic I cook up rappers and narcotics
A product of the game, in the projects
Hoppin' outta flyin' objects
Shootin' hollows at your brain
The d-tecs tried to knock us, we devilz rejectz
You smell bullets burning through flesh
When metal eject, hit the corner in a 'vette
Strapped with three techs, the plug tried to
Jack up the price, murder for respect
In the pen better pack you a knife
That leave your seats wet, never spoke a word
Me no English, distinguished gentlemen, I'm
David Letterman, move rock like (?)
Two to the head like excedrin
The block veteran, come take your medicine
You could chop off my legs, I'd still be two steps ahead of ya
Wettin' niggas with 9 mills and tommy guns, define real?
I'm ill like Tommy Buns

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Mistah FAB]
I'm from the city where
Niggas get smoked like Cheech & Chong
Lil poe nigga got 5 racks and he think he on
Big Bruh got a phone in a cell and you think he
Home, 'cause everything that goes on he already know
Watched his grandson be born on a IG live
Facetimin' when I'm drivin' wanna see how that
Mazzy ride, green dot a money pack he want a pair of a-d-idas
(?) still starch and crease some Levi's
F.A.B. and Amp tradin' war stories
Just Like 'Bo and Pac
Rest in peace my Ahk
Me and Jack mix the Bo and pop
(?)
Dope boys hit my store and shop
This ain't a radio song, this is different frequencies
Blue jeans and white t's I'm still on my Keak Da Sneak
My real life is a like a video scrap
I wouldn't see my brothers face without
A video app, screen cracked, screen black its kind of
Hard for him to see texts
Rest in peace Jack
Yeah it's still devils rejectz

[Hook:]
