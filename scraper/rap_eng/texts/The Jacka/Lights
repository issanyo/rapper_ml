[Verse 1: Justo]


[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Kill ya self you don't know my handle
20 birds in my quarter panel
Overseas speed boating channels
I ain't never gave a hoe (?)
All I did was cop blow from Manuel
He ain't never scared to serve morenos
So many keys my new name piano
I ain't waiting for the rain to settle
Ask around they know JA, (?) by the solo ray
They love my style from the golden state
My partners down they gone away
Me & K-Loc hold the Bay
Take the five (?)
You niggas high, we outer space
Pigs get behind us shoot the K
Hit the gas that's all we do
High speed that's all we know
Ski mask and a black a pistol
Knock you down and I'm not pissed off
Leather gloves and a black pea-coat
You niggas shine but never got this dope
Hit a bank no girl but I got this snow
Here the Babylon come trying to take me over
But I'm so ill that I can't be found
Man I'm so real that it make me proud
If I'm on a rap song nigga play me loud
Murder every mothafucka ever play me out
But there really ain't a lot that can save me now
Heard a motherfucka breathe and it could bring me down
Got niggas in the pit that I wish was around
'Less we living our dreams we ain't wishing in wells


[Verse 3: K-Loc]
