[Verse 1: The Jack]
Sean first time that he fed a wood clip
Hesitated with the sack, he dropped his shit when he was hit
We east mob bay (?) thought we made it rich
We brought shoes returned to school got a Ruger with the stick
The new ruler here I don't think I've ever  had a cooler year
Hunnid rounds, fifty rounds, then we started losin fear
Struggle, too much muscle to abuse my peers
Lots of money for a youngster all the bitches trynna move us in
Knockin (?) niggas down we don't move with them
When real niggas go to jail, fakes show they face again
Its hard to love when you've wasted a man
Empty space in my heart replaced with cement
