[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Its 5am and I'm just gettin' in
And never once did u ask where I been
Just asked me did I eat, got my shoes off my feet
Been gone bout a week and I still ain't sleep
I was in Fort Wayne, I was in Naptown
I was in KC, Chi Town and the D
But I'm from The Bay you know the P and the Rich
And you ain't up in the streets if u can't remember me
All I wish is death to all my enemies
And I pray that these shells don't ever enter me
Just tryin' to stay clean got everythin' I dreamed
Bout to be a millionaire in this life I meant to (?)
Father John from the stars got dirt on his wings
I returned (?)
Now I mingle with the stars, new home, new cars
Its the life of great (?) but we've never seem free
You should probably mix-a-lot if you've never seen (?)
Feel like a astronaut when I'm in a mean B
All the knowledge that I got, hope that my queen sees
Got fans overseas and never been on TV
Act like you forgot, one day you'll need me
When I'm on top with the world underneath
Outside its a storm kept warm under Minks
Just trying to perform every song I release
Just look at the form of every real nigga face
When they listen to The Jack (?)
Especially when we crack when straps release
Fuck the radio, convicts ask for these
