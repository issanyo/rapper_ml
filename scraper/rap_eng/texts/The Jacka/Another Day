[Verse 1: Berner]
Yeah, I'm still the same dude that you met back then
I got my shit bustin' hard and I don't act like them
I let the candy paint drip like the cocaine sniff
I'm dope and I don't know 'bout days like this
I leave the house and pray to god they don't raid my shit
It's hard, I spent my whole life taking risks
Hit the mall, spend a grip on a couple of fits
New kicks and I know they don't hustle like this
Big faces, no twenty's, not even a fifty
So much money in my pocket that my jeans don't fit me
Remember high school, it was three for fifty
Not that OG, but it was green and sticky
I upgraded from yellow gold to platinum
And lost a lot of friends when I started rappin'
I never finished school, I was caught in traffic
No metal on me homie cause my Glock is plastic

[Hook:]
I was young, I was gettin' my cake though
Now I'm out of state, letting that weight go
I pray for another day, cause this life is rough
I roll up and I light my blunt
Yeah, I'm riding to that Pac, sippin' lean and smokin'
All Eyez on Me, Picture Me Rollin'
Yeah, I pray for another day, cause this life is rough
I roll up and I light my blunt

[Verse 2: Berner]
I get letters from the pen, they wanna keep him in
He can't wait to get out and play the streets again
It gets hard out here in these streets we're in
It's dry and I can't wait to eat again
Fresh money, brand new and crispy
When I'm broke it feels like the whole worlds against me
My baby mother still screaming at my face
Calling me a loser cause I send things outta state
I guess I'm just a drug dealer, living day by day
If you feel the same way and can't take a break
Then you feel my pain, it's like I'm paralyzed
Cause I'm stuck right here, this is where I die
Fuck a 9-5, I couldn't wear a tie
And this kinda lifestyle makes my parents cry
I got a kid now, it's time to make a change
When I open up that door I hear her say my name

[Hook:]
I was young, I was gettin' my cake though
Now I'm out of state, letting that weight go
I pray for another day, cause this life is rough
I roll up and I light my blunt
Yeah, I'm riding to that Pac, sippin' lean and smokin'
All Eyez on Me, Picture Me Rollin'
Yeah, I pray for another day, cause this life is rough
I roll up and I light my blunt

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Up early in the morning, the sun ain't up yet
Thinking about murder, cause mayne I'm upset
Erase another line off the plate, watch the sun set
Soon as you come out the house, it'll be your last breath
But you never came out the house, so I'm out here
Trying to pay bills in the drought, gotta kill again
Never leave the steel at the house, never sleep again
Cause I miss out on so much when I'm in my dreams
So I'm out late on the fourth, trying to shake the bing
Niggas getting breaded of course, but it never seems
To be enough, I'm insane, I be seeing stuff
Ran for the petty club, golds with my ones
Look, I must be having fun, but it's not a game
Two stepping with my gun, feelin' like a king
Head bustas like wassup, tryna' join the team
Sick I'm on the meth pushers then we split the cheese

[Hook:]
I was young, I was gettin' my cake though
Now I'm out of state, letting that weight go
I pray for another day, cause this life is rough
I roll up and I light my blunt
Yeah, I'm riding to that Pac, sippin' lean and smokin'
All Eyez on Me, Picture Me Rollin'
Yeah, I pray for another day, cause this life is rough
I roll up and I light my blunt
