[Intro - Mistah F.A.B]
This song goes out to all them hustlers out there..
Tryna leave the game man, you know
Keep callin' em back

[Verse 1 - Mistah F.A.B]
When I wake up in the morning, you know what I see?
The world is a ghetto, smokin' on D
My little cousin 13, strung out on E
Can't blame him, his mama on C
O-K-E, 27 but she look like a old lady
Gring grind, fuck working at Old Navy
Rather slang girl, and make the world go crazy
Who am I? Man I ain't no better
Just a young nigga lost tryna get this chedda
Staring out the window, wishing on a shooting star
Tryna get dumb money, go and buy a stupid car
Pray to the Lord, tryna heal my flaws
Dialing to the Heavens, hope he hear my cause
Wanna leave the game but I'm stuck and I'm trapped
So I call on my nigga Jack

[Hook x2]
Tryna leave the game but it's callin' my name...

[Verse 2 - The Jacka]
This rap shit'll have you in a hole like 300
Kick a black nigga down the hole like 300
Twist an eighth in the back with boy and breath on it
Down to my last nick, bout to cop a quarter kick
All the real niggas see, I'm still out'chea
They like be rappin when I'm trappin, I'm a real nightmare
White T's, blue jeans, Nikes all I wear
Lost a nigga to a gun shot, I been there
Killed a nigga for a small amount, life ain't fair
Coke white leather seats, 40 Glock under there
Catch a sucka in the traffic then I'm aiming at his head
Ran back to the game, became a millionaire
Hit a lick on my connect, I got so much shit for sale
I'm on my nigga Michael bout to take the streets back
Rainbow fish scale, the coke feel is all I know
Islam help me let it go
When times get hard, it's the game that I'm running to
Many niggas die from the D that I'm running through
What would the prophet do? So Alayhi salam
Got the world in my palm
Somethin' bout the streets got my heart and my mind
Up with the beats, fuck school, I'm on a grind
Got slap in the Benz, my nig lets ride around
Fresh out the lab with the new shit, nigga check out the sound
