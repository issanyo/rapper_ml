[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Connect fresh back in town took some caine and some brown from him
He slid through after a while knocked him down when he came for me
Killing like a sport won't take no shorts that you bring to me
Ladder in the car every nigga who hang with me
Tore (?) apart they lost they hop when the feds came in
Trappin out apartments back to darkness when feds came
Gotta slit your throat before you talk this a man's game
Knocked the witness off then celebrated for 10 days
Pull triggers cause they scared nigga I'm really insane
Outlaws, 300 outdoors to Brisbane
Up the 101 North I really hustled in rain
The people call us Jack and the Husalah they never say our names
In the jects with 'Mouth kill ya self ever (?) our chain
You girl said she love herself enough for her and the J
Suprise yourself flyest girls really into Jack
Mobbest niggas you ever known it's hard thinking that

[Hook]
Somebody loves you baby
Ooh ooh ooh
Somebody loves you baby
Ooh ooh ooh
Somebody loves you baby
Ooh ooh ooh
Somebody loves you baby
