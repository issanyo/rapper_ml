[Hook]
I mob movin' a million times a minute so
Even when you thought you slipped on mine i hear you bro
The Mob movin' a million miles a minute so
I know I'm gone but still I won't forget you though x2

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
(?), green eyes I remember you
Went to county first time fucked with the bull
Bullet, young Pum they my niggas too
Erry nigga enter the Mob is who I kill you for
Back when every nigga sellin' pigeon probably killed before
Figaz makin' millions, yeah we mobsters but we not Sicilians
Hammer in my jeans before my teens because I'm Brazilian
I been overseas, every household was familiar
With the JA, nose-hairs full of Yae
House full of knocks, more chops than a Safeway
A million dollars can't save me
A hunnid shots can't save me
Never had a Glock with a safety
Killas in the spot you'll get shot when you snake me
Because I'm out my mind, Mob cause we never had a 9 to 5
