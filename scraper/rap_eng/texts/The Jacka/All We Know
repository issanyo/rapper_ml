[Verse 3: The Jacka]
I'm a real nigga and I can't remember you
I'm wearing Tommy Hilfiger cause I hate niggas too
I'm with the illest niggas, you bulls is invisible
About to count half a ticket with the Hus' in my living room
You probably never heard of Jack but this what they listen to
500k ain't shit to you but it made us invincible
You mite of never heard of Dot but he who they listen to
I got murder on my mind can't relax when I'm sniffing blow
I'm bout to slide through...
And any nigga standing outside about to die too
We not gangbangers, he not my rival
But we caught up in a game where you talk with a rifle
These kids shooting cause they scared but I'm really a psycho
Jack the real truth every rap is the bible
I just hit the sound booth no pen no title
And just kick that real shit for ill niggas to drive to
