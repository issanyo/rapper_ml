[Cormega]
If you can dream it you can be it
I once idolized a few guys I superseded
See life is mad trife, but 'fore my cypher get completed
I wanna flip a brick and take a trip to Egypt
Son I predict, I'ma be rich
See shit like enemies hit the Lex gleaming, prestigous
You vets schemin', but scared death to try to bring it
Cuz' live niggas move in silence, but die screaming
My third eye seein' niggas manipulatin'
They wanna get you when you situated
My nickle plated made him kiss the pavement
Thoughts are written sacred
My niggas used to live in cages, and spittin' razors
And rippin' faces, my dun on the run with mad different cases
Yet he out of state gettin' paper, got a place in Jamaica
Next to Shaba, where he can smoke acres of Ganja

[Chorus]
Love this life and life is livin'
Knowin' we got you little young Gs listenin'
Love this life and life is livin'
Cormega got you young Gs listenin'
Love this life and life is livin'
Mob Figaz  got you young Gs listenin'

[The Jacka]
Doin' time writin' rhymes in them damn cell blocks
Where niggas still push rocks, and niggas still push hop
[?] feelin' strange what it's like to have life
I rap about real life, you niggas roll with the hype
DJ Unique and Cormega in the zone off that light
Real thugs, on and off the mic
Do a show and make the crowd light, straps in the sky
Make ya gang fight, yeah it's The Jack in plain sight
I know you heard a lot about me, the invisible MC
Cuz' the feds is on my case, a lot of places I can't be
The Jack Artist, the nigga who rap hardest
You used to be my nig, now I wonder where ya heart is
Release my magazine, in the streets I'm a marine
Fuck peace fuck dreams, ain't no future for me
I'm on the run for murder, could've been an ill MC
Now I'll never be heard of, I got the MOB on my sleeve cuz' I'm dedicated
You could've squeezed the trigger nigga but you hesitated
Tell my little bro I gotta cut, but I don't wanna leave
He won't understand when I get back he won't remember me
Just the fact he kin to me, he probably turn thug
Tell em' never test drugs, tell em' never touch guns
I know my moms worry and pray for her son
But I wonder if she realize that Allah is One
I love her like no other, gotta go here they come

[Chorus]
Love this life and life is livin'
Knowin' we got you little young Gs listenin'
Love this life and life is livin'
Cormega got you young Gs listenin'
Love this life and life is livin'
Mob Figaz  got you young Gs listenin'

[Johnny Ca$h]
Nigga I rock the grill with the chills on me
Slight ice, niggas they wanna drop some bills on me
And stop life, but cash cock back
Break you for your jewels and make you drop that
Life on a rollercoaster, so I push the hop black
I brag about a pistol, then bet it's a automatic
Word I swerve through the traffic like The Dukes of Hazard
Me and Jacka, off bastards while gas packin'
So much dough, fuck off a hun and buy the jag with
The 20s on it, plus the tints to match the paint
I puff before the show, blow a whole ounce of dank
Cuz' I'm feddy-cheese, splurgin' workin' with a couple Gs
C-A-$-H, yes indeed nigga
How ya be, how ya moms be, how ya sister be
Heard you makin' history, that's a victory
Out in Richmond I rally I'm makin' it
This nigga hittin' skins in the Valley and got new friends
