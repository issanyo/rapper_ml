[Verse 1: The Jacka]
This shit is outstanding we lamping we on top of the world
30 in my sandwich vampin' with a drug dealer's girl
Came from the Atlantic got a clam if I pay for pearl
Fucking with the J goddamn I'm on a wave right now
Metal in my jeans getting paid is all I think about
Hate my enemies you decease if you link with them
Fly but if you get a nigga time we'll never speak again
Pigs read our rhymes so I never use a pen in here
The Mob like Quentin ain't nothing but men in here
Slick G and Jam Time, I remember them
Lil' Man and Bub, I remember them
Gov and young Khan, I remember them
Head from a kingpin wife because I love the life
She only fucking with him cause he buying everything she like
Never love a bitch nigga make a bitch sell sex
Stryie full of ice, small sprite full of Qualitest

[Hook: The Jacka]
Me with you won't ever make sense
You ain't nothing but the dopeman's bitch
Come around like you wanna live this
It's my dream, you a kingpin bitch
You ain't nothing but the dopeman's bitch
You ain't nothing but the dopeman's bitch
You ain't nothing but the dopeman's bitch

[Verse 2: Ampichino]
Me and you, that'll never make sense
You ain't never been shit, but the dopeman's bitch
Pull up in the foreign, that's a dopeman's whip
Turn half to a whole, that's a dopeman's brick
Sold dope, your bitch on my dick
I'd rather push coke, you wanna play with her tits
Ain't that a bitch, you wonder why you fall off
Every night you in the hotel room pulling you're draws off
I'm in the kitchen with a sawed off, coke get hauled off
U-hauls come from Utah we ballin'
Like the splash brothers, I got goons that tell me when the task come they just shoot and don't ask nothin'
1st rule: never trust a hoe,  I'm already getting bread, what the fuck I gotta fuck her for? You niggas, uncomfortable when you
Fuck with hoes, she only fuck with d-boys that be pumping blow

[Hook: The Jacka]

[Bridge: J Stalin]
Hold me down, never question my loyalty
Bagging up coke, have it turn me back to the old me
(?)
Who can fuck you better hit the g spot
Have you (?) when I showed you how to cut a rock
Bitch quit playin' I'll pick you up on the bus stop

[Verse 3: J Stalin]
Dope boy shit, I'll never trust a punk ho
Back and forth cross the bridge back to Frisco
Nigga, we be moving pure snow
That's what all these hoes wanna know
'Are all these cars really yours, are they rented bro?'
'Yes all these cars are really ours, they ain't rented hoe'
Only thing, the only thing you good for
Is putting dick up in your throat
Now bounce your ass like the (?)
Now bounce your ass like the (?)

[Hook: The Jacka]
