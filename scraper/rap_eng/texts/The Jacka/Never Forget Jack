[Hook: The Jacka]
Now they love this shit
Even though it took a while to tell me that
Now they love The Jack
Even though they'll probably never tell me it
Nooo, they just pull me down
All I wanna do is make my princess smile
(?) we caught up in the world
Get rich as we can before we leave this world
(?)


[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Never forget Jack
Can't give our description cause we wearin' black
Don't need my prescription, they ain't sellin' Act
I'm the first rapper talkin' bout mailin' packs
That was '01, kick around bout the shit we really done
Threat a nigga, better have my chicken 'fore we really come
First time came up on some work, I was really young
Niggas from the turf put in work to the songs I sung
Now it's no hope, can't have dope 'less I sold you some
Real nigga sleep with my hammer in case the soldiers come
Traps scramblin' can't be no killer I gotta loan you guns
(?) put a hole in your lung
Off top, no golf, put a hole in one
Free that nigga (?) sniffin' soft so my nose'll run
Sometime this for who never see the sunshine
Again just know that JA got you on his mind
My niggs
