[Verse 3: The Jacka]
This shit is so dope mane
They think i'm on cocaine
All I do is smoke pain
You'll be here one day

They took my lil nigg life for a gold chain
All he wanted was to be fly in a old Stang
In love with the life but nigga it's a cold game
Niggas think they on till the day they get they skulls banged
Never seen a whole thang? How can you be my nigga
Breakin' down a 20 pack, I ain't even in a kitchen
Nigga you ain't into that? How can you say you livin'
He ain't never heard of Jack? He must never been to prison
How the fuck i'm makin' stacks when I never paid attention
So my nigga turnt up a slap and made them niggas listen
I'd love to thank you for that but I could never visit
Cause we so caught in the trap, i'll end up in there with you

[Verse 4: V12]
