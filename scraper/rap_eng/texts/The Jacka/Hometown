[Intro]
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

[Hook]
Hometown, memories are fresh
Hometown, memories are fresh
Hometown hometown hometown, memories are fresh
Round my hometown, Ooh the people I've met

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Jaaack
Remember me and Fed-X movin' packs out the embassy
In the jects my whip so clean its embarrassing
But if I just unload my thang, then you parish away
'Member you shot Fed-X that won't just go away
Free Tommy Wayne ridin' around look for you every night
Know I let the same 30 drip off the Prada belt
Dopest rap song in the game without a lot of help
Cause The Jack & young Skiem we did it by ourselves
Every man equal but they still try to honor us
We cut our losses, searchin' for what's inside of us
(?) that's a lot of thugs
OPF and The MOB that's a lot of drugs
Nothin' but real niggas around (?)
Standin' up right now, forgot how high I was
I don't give a damn if we are, so save the applause
