[Chorus: Lil Rue]
To all my niggas in the trap house grittin', cookin' up in the kitchen
Tryna make a mill off a quarter chicken
I know how it feel [x4] (forreal tho)
And ya baby mama trippin' over these other bitches
Tell her sit back and just listen
I know how it feel [x4] (forreal tho)

[Verse 1: AOne]
Drop the work off then I picked up my other bitch, dropped the work off then I picked my other bitch
Me and Rue get money all in the doe
I double back on niggas just to let em' know
I'll melt a nigga top just for 20 bands
So what yo benz like, I pull up in that gray van
Got em sayin' Amen, versace shades no ray bans
30 shots knockin' out the 9 M M, I'll sit a bitch down till' I see 1 M
I don't give a fuck what my baby mama talkin' bout
I'm the only nigga got the trap house poppin' in the drought
Pills, promethazine, and cook in the house

[Chorus]
To all my niggas in the trap house grittin', cookin' up in the kitchen
Tryna make a mill off a quarter chicken
I know how it feel [x4] (forreal tho)
And ya baby mama trippin' over these other bitches
Tell her sit back and just listen
I know how it feel [x4] (forreal tho)

[Verse 2: Lil Rue]
I remember takin' losses I didn't think I could get back from
That 30 pack of loud didn't make it to Akron
Lost my last hoe and I'm like fuck it, I'm back up to the trap pusin' packs up out my bucket (forreal tho)
This rap shit don't pay my bills, so to all my niggas out there I know how you feel
This street shit ill, you know that it's real when the closest nigga to you be the first one to squeal
That ain't one hunnid, I thought we were solid I would have took that case for you
Would have slid through the spot and dropped shots to they face for you
That's just some fake nigga traits for ya
Niggas vow to be loyal get cake and straight shake on ya

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
All my little niggas is sick, they ain't scared to fire
Me, I'm ridin' round with 20 bricks in the spare tire
We outlaws, 300 outdoors up in Ukiah
Ain't shit cool about dope, one day you'll be a lifer
Pops brought rocks to mom, and fucked the family's life up
Had to push cain for my brothers, then put pain on my colors
Had plans till' I said the working mans a sucka
Could never take nothin' back the struggle made me tougher
A hundred green house cooks, all came with color
Discovered Islam then I saved my mother
We go every where we dream, but we won't get younger
Now we rap stars, but we came from shavin' onions
It's Lil Rue and AOne, they names is buzzin'
Disrespect Joe you die next time we run in
The whole album's straight thuggin' got your girlfriend buggin'
Gettin' ready for the kill got the whole world clutchin'
They released the Hus from jail now the whole world love it
