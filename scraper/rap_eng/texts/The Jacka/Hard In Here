[The Jacka]
It's hard in here
Cuz everybody wanna be large in here
They thought we wouldn't make it till the stars appeared
They thought it was all a fluke till foreign cars was near
You know that panoramic roof shit causes tears
You know that ladder on this new shit causes fears
You know I always knew I'd rule that MOB shit man
Because that sit and die in jail shit robbed my plans
It ain't no promise I won't rob again
But I guarantee that I go upside ya head
Cannon in my hand 8 felons in the van
You know this MOB shit real ain't gotta tell you I'm the man
Came with the double-drum make you suckas overstand
You ain't the mothafuckin' MOB never say you hard again
Every day we gotta mob just might wake up at a camp
You ain't never peeled a cap, you can never be my friend

[Chorus]
It's large in here
Everbody wanna be hard in here
Hard niggas stars again
Now everybody wanna be MOB again
It's large in here
Everbody wanna be hard in here
Cuz hard niggas on again
Now everbody wanna be MOB again

[The Jacka]
Before [?]
30 dick on my hip walkin' through the Favela
Wishin' this moment'll last forever
Get respect from every hood but I clash with several
It's that MOB shit nigga and it's about to go viral
But I'm hood and I mostly speak on murdering rivals
Got a hundred in the clip on the AR Rifle
Can't get in with my banger bring my dagger to spike you
The MOB mothafucka hell nah we don't like you
I was gone now I'm back again like recycles
Real goons from the streets high, we just like you
Ain't no problem killin' niggas but they don't like you
They don't need a scope, bullet go where the light go
Makin' holes like donuts at the oldschool sideshow
Hoes'll go nuts when the JA slide through
Never play me unless the tree inside you
Yeah, let me remind you
You'll never make it hear unless the MOB behind you

[Chorus]
It's large in here
Everbody wanna be hard in here
Hard niggas stars again
Now everybody wanna be MOB again
It's large in here
Everbody wanna be hard in here
Cuz hard niggas on again
Now everbody wanna be MOB again

[Joe Blow]
Everybody wanna be MOB again
But when was hyphy was around you wasn't mobbin' then
Ridin' round with a hundred pounds up inside the Benz
So I can sweep your whole street if I decide to trip
Niggas say we funkin', they see me and never do much
So if you say you MOB, gotta come through us
Finna take this game over in the next few months
A better life for my daughter, I don't want too much
Ain't too many that I trust so I fuck with my fam
I put my soul in all my music so it touches my fans
Do it for the real niggas that's stuck in the can
Dre showed us the blueprint and we just stuck to the plan
Song droppin' every month, vids to every one
Touchdown to show my face in hoods you'll never come
So they love me and you know they respect me in every slum
If you ain't never came to rock with the MOB then you never was
Yeah, let me remind you
You'll never make it here unless the MOB behind you
