[Intro]
Nigga did you take my money?
Hehehe that's right lil bitch

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
We tryna keep 'em confused
There's bitch niggas near, all I smell is perfume
A hood with the Amp nigga roundin' up wolves
And erry time our stomach growl we hunt you down with them tools
Niggas act hard, they have me amused
I never hit Salah high so I catch every jewel
They say Jack you so fly you'll take the world very soon
I'm wearin' Gucci errything but I don't smell like cologne
About to board an airplane and all I smell like is dro
But we so thugged the fuck out, they don't know what to do
Jack a real ass nigga all I know is the truth
You just smell Italian leather when you open the coupe
I'm tryna hold it all together while we openin' coke
Niggas 'round like they ill but they not what you thought
In perfect health goddamn but I limp when I walk
I'm just a mack but I sound like a pimp when I talk
I used to see the signs clearly now my vision is off
We came from sittin' in the kitchen nigga twistin' up soft
Came from mouth full of spittas with a zip in my draws
Time to go on vacation and they takin' us off

[Verse 2: Husalah]
