[The Jacka]
I'm a ice cold mack that's all I know
Every bitch that I had gave me stacks fasho
Heavy clout comin' out when I cracked my dome
Niggas rapped, but we was sellin' crack ya know
And this is how the story go, met a rich cat he was movin' blow
He knew that I was Jack, so he put me on
He said he'll start a label then get me known
Bought a new lab, new crib we gone
AKs, SKs black with chrome
Fresh tour bus, time to hit that road
Can't take the world if you sittin' at home
Got 3 mil cash, where should we go
First stop was a lot fuck with Young Gamble
Never put the fire out, tell me all y'all know
Told me never tire out in the cold ass world

[Chorus]
Better grind hard to keep up ya know
Drive in a fast car to shake the boys in blue
[?] man that's all we do
In my old school, but the insides new
In the hood gettin' high with my nig Laroo
All the hoes love the mob so they just dip through
Yeah we in a life of crime so don't leave no clues
If they ever take you down don't tell em' the truth

[Laroo]
Cold tequila, you know the true religion gon' sag on the Fila
Roll a cone let me tell you how the play start
Amongst killas, have money and heart
Fumes, no fresh air
We out here movin' pack from the time shares
How we turn dope money to then playin' deals
F-B-I profile criminals
Tell me all you know, approached by a business man say he grow
Got a line on the south if we make that hit
He spend all the bread profit we split
I clean house like a janitor, I make calls like a manager
Peep the floor plan, still pushin' soft packs out a rap van

[Chorus]
Better grind hard to keep up ya know
Drive in a fast car to shake the boys in blue
[?] man that's all we do
In my old school, but the insides new
In the hood gettin' high with my nig Laroo
All the hoes love the mob so they just dip through
Yeah we in a life of crime so don't leave no clues
If they ever take you down don't tell em' the truth

[J. Stalin]
It's the Livewire calico packa, I'm with The Jacka
Ruegar on my hip, plus I'm off a couple smackers
Knock a nigga down like a middle line backer
I'm a West Oakland nigga, boy I make shit happen
Middle of the night, but nigga I'm still trappin'
Banger in my drawers with another in my jacket
Gettin' money is a habit way above average
I'll Livewire murder for hire one of you bastards
It get drastic we still in the gutta hoe
Like my nigga 40 water, bitch I'm goin' federal
I'm in love with the money, addicted to the lifestyle
When the coke come in I need a snow plow
That thang rang louder than a thunder cloud
Get you some banana clips, cuz boy you in the jungle now
Said that thang rang louder than a thunder cloud
Get you some banana clips, cuz boy you in the jungle now

[Chorus]
Better grind hard to keep up ya know
Drive in a fast car to shake the boys in blue
[?] man that's all we do
In my old school, but the insides new
In the hood gettin' high with my nig Laroo
All the hoes love the mob so they just dip through
Yeah we in a life of crime so don't leave no clues
If they ever take you down don't tell em' the truth
