[Intro]
It’s clear that we’re on the verge of a great transition in human life
That what we face now is this fundamental change of the life we’ve known over the last century

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Been a goon naked bitches livin' in my swimming pool
This Canon not for pictures but it still'll make you centerfold
Pushin' keys, runnin' through these trees like Ninja Scroll
Now I'm gettin' bird so cheap we just leave 'em whole
Fuck what you heard don't speak 'less you take a soul
Searchin' for a lash cause the task wanna take the bull
JA same nigga used to chase you home
Young Pac, eyes bloodshot, when you face the thump
Mayday, hunnid shots in the (?)
My shooter seen your paper, pulled his hammer then you gave it to him
Front a nigga Yae, hurry pay, we dont wait that long
Tryna short the J, same day he don't wake up on
Travel cross the globe, real niggas this they favorite tune
Every soda poured, don't wake up till we see the moon
Niggas try to dip through but this nickel had 'em breathin' wrong
Styrofoam Sprite, nose white, nigga we be on

[Hook]
Rich so now the world is in..(love)
So we come around to show..(love)
Rich so now the girls are in.. (love)
Caught up in the world with no..(love)
This is for the people who..(love)
For me it's never easy to..(love)
Never need my enemy's..(love)
Cause I never show 'em no..(love)



[Verse 2]
Ill, cause real gangstas play my music
Anytime that I bought the steel is cause I plan to use it
Coke deals twistin' blocks out like a Rubix
Risk game say you killed a man then you gotta prove it
No deals where they gettin' slain over music
Old fans die then they rise to this new shit
I'm with my man size gettin' high on this blue cookie
It's like magic how these raps ain't even need a notebook
Magic Johnson how these chumps'll get a pass with no look
Drum on my Thompson, bull we mobbin' every man I know shook
These niggas punks, we takin' over now my nigg you know what
I'm the new king shout out to the food chain
Rest in peace Tall this for yall if you move cream
Suckas just gone let my nigga fall, they dont move mean
Better not ever show your face at all bitch if you've seen
What happened to the world, they need some girl so I pull strings

[Hook]
