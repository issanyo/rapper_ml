[Verse 1: The Jacka]
It must be cold searchin' for souls like the early Mayans
Tools searchin' for gold like the 49ers
Answers are in Islam but he thinks it's science
The Anakim were here at first, now they findin' giants
Allah is when the angel gave us Scriptures to remind us
The taller beings brought us out here but they realigned the
Pyramids with the stars in Orion
When the gasses were mixed they fueled engines were flyin'
Aluminum suited machine, they keep em from dyin'
The pyramids let off a beam to a earlier satellite
And transfer gas to his rocket to continue flight
The black astronaut learned what he has forgot
Off to another place, return when he's figured out
The ancient secrets from other beings who charted first
Evidence of war there, they had it hard at first
Mothership crashed in the Moon from a laser's burst
Science just found out that, y'all the first
Black bodies fully intact, from a time before us
Black lady fully intact, still beautiful
Craft bigger than Manhattan, that was 30 thousand years ago
This took blood, sweat, & tears to know
Time to break the chain this is things we need our kids to know
Or keep us blind in The States, we don't get to know
Or keep lyin' in your face so we forget to grow

[Hook: The Jacka]
(?) when he left the Earth surface
Never felt fear cause he over-stood his purpose
When he would return he found war amongs the earthlings
And only shared the scrolls with the souls who were worth it
And every time they came home a thousand years had gone
People that was hard to believe cause they still were young
Ancient Astronauts...
