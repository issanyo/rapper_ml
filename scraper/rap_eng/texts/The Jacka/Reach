[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Pro ballers, rap stars, inspire me
They live rich lives, I realize that's how I should be
Time to go again, the goodbyes never got to me
Bad guys, cause why would good guys have to pray?
Coke ties, made our lives rise right away
Bitches say, they need a real nigga right away (right away)
My kids rich if I die today
Chicks on my line, foreign whips in my driveway
Murder just to be here, why you think that ima play?
My young bull was innocent, they gunned us down anyway
In the night, millionaires can't read or write
We just reach for the stars while we pourin' lean in a Sprite
