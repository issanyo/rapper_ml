[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Yo, life was heavy on my mind then the high erased it
Now all I ever buy is fly transportation
I got coke ties where you guys vacation
Everything I wear is fly cause of the time I'm facing
I can get 300 lifes cause of this drive I'm taking
Just trynna be somebody astaghfirullah if I'm mistaken
I'm bout to meet somebody made me rich in one conversation
Who said you been through all this crazy shit how do you stay patient
Who gave me all these chances now advanced in the new world
Order had court in the mornings thought I would lose trial
Took the bull out the next morning where only fools smile
Subhanahu Wa Taâ€™ala its forsure I'll never lose now
And if you hear this song then you should say it too.. Yeah
And everything you choose make sure you see it through
