You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the.. [x5]

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I'm better than all the rest
Skills pave the way but you payed for your success
The road was long for us now we own this shit
They used to hate on Jack now they on my dick
Me and DJ Fresh strapped who needs a vest
I ain't relieved unless tree smoke leave my chest
At school I never read I just received D's and F's
Young black kids nobody believed in us
Still made it rich here ridin' on my fixed gear
Down to earth though they say I'm sort of a big deal
I thought I'd be famous but gangstas don't get deals
I run up in the Chase with a K to get scrill

[Hook]
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the... [x5]

[Verse 2]
I remember waking up in a cell for breakfast
That's what I get for choosing pagans as my friends and protectors
We on the stage doing shows you in the nosebleeds heckling
Kill ya self nigga you can't see pimpin'
Ain't nothing wrong with my health still I'm limpin'
I don't wanna meet them cause they not living
They ain't rolling up (?) and they ain't sipping
How could you overstand the shit I'm kicking
Soon as the eagle land I'll probably die in the kitchen
I know some real millionaires opening pies from the prison
But he rather be free to keep a eye on his children
Always on my mind though I could never visit

[Hook]
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the... [x5]
