[Hook: The Jacka]
My lil' niggas out all night, they lovin' that
Ill niggas high all night, they lovin' that
Overseas Japanese flats, they lovin' that
Ill niggas sending out packs, they lovin' that too
They love that  JA, I'm lovin' that too
They love the boy HP, they love my whole crew
They love that boy MDot, he love 'em back too
We bringing the hood back so won't you slide through
We fuck with them hood cats but they don't like you
They fuck with this Mob shit cause we ain't like you
We come from the projects, whips and fly shoes
Sip like 5 bricks before my eyes close

They love that  JA, I'm lovin' that too
They love the boy HP, they love my whole crew
They love that boy MDot, they love him back too

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Funking with the Jack better have your tool
Hit you in your gut with the plastic bull
You ain't never put in work better pass the tool
My niggs'll unload at your shit then laugh at you
(?)
We gone live it up don't give a fuck where (?) to go
Havin' fun in a place where the  strays fly past your dome
Seems like real niggas these days don't last that long
We the last, we strong
You got cash I'll have my goons come (?)
