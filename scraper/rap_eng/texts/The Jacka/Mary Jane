Sweet Mary-Jane won't you lay me down
I lost my mind long ago
Lost my heart in California

[Verse 1: Lee Majors]
I blow a ounce a day, I'm rollin' paper planes
I hope the runway clear I'm bout to fly away
I like my tree served to me on a silver tray
A lot of wax in that thang I'm reppin' Swisher Gang
They say a apple a day keeps the doctor away
I'm on my third pack of Sweets feelin' A-Okay
Twenty blunts a day I'm rollin' up constantly
Mind gone can't remember what I was about to say
Still lookin' for my Mary-Jane, and yeah she my everythang
All that I ever need, is a cup of lean and a bag of weed
Girl Scout Cook, OG Kush, Cherry Pie you might think I'm too high
Sour Diesel blowin' smoke to the sky and when I cop I need a heavy supply

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joe Blow]
(Blow, Check a real nigga out)
Hit the club everyday spend a stack just on weed
Girl Scout, Cherry Pie, and some Platinum OG
When I'm with Mary-Jane I can keep my nose clean
Cause she help me with the pain plus she know I'm on V's
Keep noddin' off while I'm smokin' on Dream
When I'm in the U.K. you know I'm smokin' on Cheese
It's crazy being addicted to this codeine
Shit I can't go a day with no lean
Cook goin' for the price of Purp in '03
And I paid four P's for this Blow piece
5 gram hash plate filled with OG
And in my Zag it's all hash it ain't no tree
Call me Joe Blow the most, shit you know me
At least a ten pack knock when my phone ring
You think you smoke more than me you must be on cream
And I'll be sippin' on this lean til I O.D

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Lost my heart a long time ago
Rap Star now all started from a talent show
Really made it far but I wonder where's the talent gone
I never went to school fourteen with my Allens on
Out here (?) first like every time a (?) blowin'
The first time I hit Jamaica it was gangsters with the (?) blown
They took me in, gave me everything but they all were poor
They were thankful, grateful for everything I offered to em
He showed me his weed plants, I taught him to grow indoors
The seeds that I left there, He ended up growin' for us
Oppressed the dark African, how can this go ignored?
Hard to stop traffickin' the plug just throw it to us
I smoke a lot of weed everyday man cause I'm goin' through it
I got a lot of money too and I can't stop blowin' through it
Hermes belts, the shoes that go to it
It's that hundred lights in the warehouse to grow music
