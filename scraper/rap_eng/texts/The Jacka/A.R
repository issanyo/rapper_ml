[Intro]
I mean within an inch of their life
Everyone describes it very similarly
Absolute serenity and calm
Some might even call it nirvana
Then comes a bright light...

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
AR is my rifle
They stars but they don't like you
Must be our turn to put on a cipher
Shout out The Mob in case I might blow
Leave the place soon as the night go
Fiends can wait on by the (?)
Your girl not a hoe but she suck just like one
How you not a bull but you look just like one
Count a hunnid on the couch fall asleep when the sun out
These must be the days buyin' trees with a gun out
Bubb, young Kaz, Lil' Lee was the ones out
My nigga young Mike seem like he in love now
Remember JA dropped (?)
Drummer on the wood nigga whole hood thugged out
Whole block turnt can't believe what I learned
Never think twice bout these motherfuckers that I hurt
You tryna fire with a Glock that'll never work
Real California nigga I never surf
Tryna make a couple million off every turf
Only cop from the (?)
Get strong even though we don't live long
Real niggs in the pris' love this song
We don't leave the crib 'less a Des' or a nick on
Young nigga testing the kid he won't (?)

[Hook: The Jacka] (x2)
AR is my rifle
They stars but they don't like you
Must be our turn to put on a cipher
Shout out The Mob in case I might blow
Leave the place soon as the night go
Fiends can wait on by the (?)
Your girl not a hoe but she suck just like one
How you not a bull but you look just like one
