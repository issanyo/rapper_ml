[Verse 1: Lil Rue]
No sleep just hustle
Play with the weight all night and build muscle
I still represent the struggle
And all my niggas in the trap making it bubble up
Yeah we still push that double up
All night soft white no huddle up
You niggas better huddle up
Call a time-out & get your plays right
Cause I'm playing this game all night
Yeah I'm pushing this cane soft white
In the water like a Great White
True Religion jeans, cool grey mikes
On my New York Knicks spikes
Break it down and beat that bitch like Ike
Now eat this cake (?)
Pyrex kids let it bake (?)

[Hook: A-One]
When we get this shit
You know we get this shit the hard way
This one for my niggas shooting shit in broad day
You don't wanna end up laying where the frogs lay
Cause when you get (?) you get this shit the hard way
Cause when we gettin' it we get this shit the hard way
This one for my niggas shooting shit in broad day
You don't wanna end up laying where the frogs lay
Cause when we get it we get this shit the hard way


[Verse 2: A-One]
Came out The Wire with somethin' like '08
I'm feelin' like the nigga these niggas is so fake
Its all in da doe nickel dime yeah the times right
Hit it with the acetone just to make the money right
Real dope dealers know what a nigga talkin' bout
Got 2 kicks in my luggage bout to board the plane
When I land the money is all in exchange(?)
Pop 2 seals and I call this shit purple rain
Sippin' on this Sprite, Lebron James edition
Elephant Print number 5 she know I'm pimpin'
This one for my niggas gettin' money the hard way
This one for my niggas shootin' shit in broad day

[Hook]
When we get this shit
You know we get this shit the hard way
This one for my niggas shooting shit in broad day
You don't wanna end up laying where the frogs lay
Cause when you get (?) you get this shit the hard way
Cause when we gettin' it we get this shit the hard way
This one for my niggas shooting shit in broad day
You don't wanna end up laying where the frogs lay
Cause when we get it we get this shit the hard way

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
'84 late in the O, it's hard to walk through here
Now that I made it a adult I'm glad you brought us here
Pops locked tried hit a bank that shit costs us dear
She was scarred started smoking hard, my heart full of fear
Left us all alone to just starve but now I'm never scared
First job I'm in The Mob but kill with these hands
I've killed cause your nigg got locked, revealed every plan
Kill cause there's 12 stash spots in the rental van
Watch the words out your mouth or you gone need a dental plan
Dopest nigga in this rap shit, no pad or pen
Dopest rappers I ever heard they all in the Penn
Lil Lee, young Kaz I hope you live again
(?) all they tried to be my businessmen
We in the gutta cause our mothers only one who care
My niggas learnin' from the sunway
Babylon come and take our lights away
