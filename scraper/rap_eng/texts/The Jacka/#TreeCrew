[Verse 2: The Jacka]
...Stupid lit
Me n Slick pour a half a brick
Hit the 101, then he chase it with the cancer stick
Twenty dancers in our cribs, takin' chances mailin' kicks
But my tree so strong you'll lose a lung when you inhale this shit
All my niggas shown to carry guns and wanna down the kid
Bring you to the light, 3 pints in my cargo pants
Bitches love our life, don't get high then you not our friends
With my nigga James, 3 dice finna crack ya head
We just save our ends, then blend in, 'til the package ran
I be in Prague, that's the UK
Fuck with the Mob they dont watch TV
Then go to Melk, they love the JA
Then knock yo ass down the first time you don't pay
Your lame conversations we don't entertain
Fly to Atlantic then we land in Maine
Same day we touch overnight in cocaine
I make the drop then fly right back to Spain
Damn I'm the nig, international bull
Checkin' my bank tryna (?)
Trippy Stix full of wax  takin' a pull
Death to the cats who was hatin' before
Death to the snitch who forsaken his crew
(?)
