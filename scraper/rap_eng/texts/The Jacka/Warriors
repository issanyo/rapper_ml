[Intro: The Jacka]
My niggas is warriors
Big machines is around them
Gun you down
This that street shit you have never been in in your life
My whole life is illegal
Gun you down if I see you
Knock you down cuz that real (?)
My niggas is warriors
Big machines is around them
Gun you down
This that street shit you have never been in in your life

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Put a couple pounds in the air
Pack a 30 round though we never go nowhere
My niggas from the A only smoke OG
He buyin' everythang but we trap cocaine
Where did the real shit go
Niggas act like they don't love you no more
P-World niggas don't fuck around
Real Rich City put niggas in the ground
Real bitches love The Jack
Give me everythin' they got, they don't want a dollar back
In the traffic smokin' Plat
Hunnid in the driver lap, pray he never show you that
California niggas back
And if I got a problem with you, better never say where you at
Cause I'm gon' be comin' fast
The Mob still strong where a motherfucka never last

[Hook: The Jacka]

[Verse 2: K-Loc]
Got a couple packs in the air
Pack a 30 round though we never go nowhere
Got fam in the cell locked down doin' time
Never PC though always mainline
All we ever knew was crime
Sellin' dope is cool but rap is really on my mind
I'm just tryna push the line
Tryna do it both and get my bread at the same time
Never quit keep trying
(?) we gon' Mob till the end of time
(?)...
