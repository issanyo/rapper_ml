[Verse 1: Yng Weed]


[Hook: The Jacka]
Wake up in my trap like its my only place
Sleepin' with my chop cause its the only way
This street shit is so sick I'll never love again
Out here getting rich same time I catch a drain

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Holdin' down the spot same block I sold cocaine in a (?)
Kingpins (?) they want respect they don't want fame
We gunnin' niggas down in the broad day that's how they know our name
It's 20 cars in your driveway and you drive through town like you ok
If you not Mob then you not safe
Any nigga get guap better hide your face
Niggas act live till there's guys in they place
I do it for my niggas doing time in the state
No time for a ride 'less you driving a date
No time for a jail, all the shine that they take
On the cookie but it's nothin' like the kind that you bake
Middlemen gotta die for the line Imma take
The bread on my mind got me buying duct tape
Strappin' my gloves got the plug duct taped
He said he'd put us on but we never got straight
Said I gotta knock you down if there's nothin' in the safe
But even if there's somethin' walk him out anyway
You trying to get on nigga fuck with JA
Come short you can hide but you'll never get away
And when a snitch come out they get death the same day

[Hook] (x2)
Wake up in my trap like its my only place
Sleepin' with my chop cause its the only way
This street shit is so sick I'll never love again
Out here getting rich same time I catch a drain
