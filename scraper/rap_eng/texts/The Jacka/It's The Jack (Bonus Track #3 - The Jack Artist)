To my niggas in Australia
Sweden, Denmark
I'm hungry like a thin shark
Look at what tha pen spark
Once it touch the paper
Hustling in the rain
Gettin brain in my scraper
Get ya ass up out my face
Mothafucka
Fo' I make ya
Graffiti game
Taggin niggas
Buildings got sprayed up
Many nights a nigga stayed up
Thinkin bout the times
When different triggers saved us
And sometimes I saved you
No matter what happened
All I ever did was stay true
A kid, murkin shit
With the tre deuce
Drunk as fuck
Drivin wreck less off the Grey Goose
Respect us
Mo' Fucka
Watchin Smack DVD
What the fuck is a Papoose?
That shit was tight
Relate to gangsta shit
Cause i live the life
Mane
I be MIA
Ya, MIA
Very first seat
Heat game
Like im finna play
Coppin whips, buyin shit
Nigga, like im finna stay
Im out nigga
House niggas never been away
(you ain't never been aware)

Mind blown, world gone crazy
Make a million dollars, but that shit'll never change me
More Crime, never spent a dime on a lady
Just out my mind
25 to life, it won't change me
Im out my mind
Momma said the world been mainey, ill change in time
So i ask allah for forgiveness, cuz im out my mind

Yo, hit the hood with Rydah, J., n Hus
We was only 16, had a lotta yay to push
Never pay for pus, im from the Bay, we break bitches
Im ridiculous, ya the paint, same color as the inches
Two things ill never be, broke or a witness
I had a little trouble, thinkin how should i begin this?
Wanna end up at the top, so i roll around with winners
Remind me of my life, every time i watch Menace
Cookin and im twistn, eatin with no dishes
.40 cal in my pocket, feelin so vicious
Ya, you think you haaard?, but you a faggot dude
Fuckin with The Jack, ill turn ya ass into maggot food
I rap with dudes who clap at dudes, like AP and FED-X
Park my lex, right in the 'jects
Still in the game hustlin', cause i never crossed the Mex
21 over the plane, did it all for respect
Never leave the life on the hype like free Mess, nigga
(yo, you ain't never been aware)

Mind blown, world gone crazy
Make a million dollars, but that shit'll never change me
More Crime, never spent a dime on a lady
Just out my mind
25 to life, it won't change me
Im out my mind
Momma said the world been mainey, ill change in time
So i ask allah for forgiveness, cuz im out my mind

Your breathing slugs from the tech, just breath
Dont fight it, im a crazy Kamikazi pilot
Murder or interrogation i remain in silence
I explain the violence, to my niggas 101
Hopin we change, but its strange, they believe in none
Most our victims even seen it come
I drop a jewel, but the dumb intrigued by the drum
A gangsta, faSheez, don't wanna mislead the young
I sip lean to forget about the things i done
My nigga John from big block still on the run
That shit is petty though, nigga
I be in Mexico, Sinaloa, Negro Bandito
Rest In Peace Chico, hella shit i can't speak on
I rap, push coke, anything to have the streets on
Won't hurt to change, forgive me lord im insane
Just hold ya tongue, even if you feel ashamed
