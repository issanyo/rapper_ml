[Intro]
Look we gonna take that 300 thou and we gonna buy 30 keys of coke
The best shit in town, Rocks and lumps as big as marbles, no cut

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
J.A
Was in the Rich on Eastern Boul.(?)
Soft leather, Diadoras, and the Fila Velours
Ice limbs, True Coat with the acid wash arms
Was little kids movin' rock, now we paid to perform
We nod in class, just gassed from raisin' my arm
I fall asleep in class cause I can't wait till I'm on
I feel like I've been here forever cause the road was so long
And get trapped with my hammer sent to bring people harm
Damn, Nose full of clam, no sleep till the dawn
For real forget about The J if you'll just weep when I'm gone
I'll need no retaliatin' on these fake niggas' hood
Remember walk a nigga out to put your face in the drugs
Still chalk a nigga out after I fed him the one
I'm probably fucked already, still I try to pray for my young
In the field, wit (?) not a place you should come
We takin' chances, no romancin', never marry ya love

[Verse 2: Carey Stacks]
This shit a gamble 7-11 Ima roll the dice
If I had to do it over I would do the same twice
My nigga got into a shoot out last night
That wasn't the first time the thirty clip saved his life
Now when you die funky you leave family that pay the price
They comin' through the slums with Katers in the middle of the night
We land sharks turned up off great white
They mobbin' like Jack they ain't tryna be like mice
Stuck in the trap pushin' smack till the day like gamblin'
Don't tell me how to fuckin' live my life
I don't do this shit for fun, I'm makin' sure my sons alright
Battle with my demons  all the time it's a daily fight
