[Verse 1: The Jacka]
When Lil' Monie slid through he only hit 2 niggas
Thats gon' happen everytime cause they killed my nigga
These niggas 'round like they ill but I'm not familiar
He caught you slippin, starred your world cause you were with your children
I got 100 stacks for 4 bricks of blow
Never leave the house without a Mac in my clothes
Show The Jack your stash he put the strap to your nose before he Takes everything you've got
He cocked the hammer on the nickle slapped yo ass with the nose before he takes everything you've got
He cocked the hammer on his chop and put that shit to your clothes before he takes everything you've got
Real shit won't leave the crib unless a Mac in his Trues
Hit a bank knock him down take yo half 'fore it spoils
Like Jordan in his prime they can't fuck with the bulls
Rich and Jack on your line and we sending the wolves
The clip on the .45 look like cinnamon roll
(?) no habla espanol
Is what I tell the connect soon as he open the door
We just take everything you've got
Don't ever show the Jack your stash he put the strap to yo nose before he takes everything you've got
He cocked the hammer on the nickle slapped yo ass with the nose before he takes everything you've got
He cocked the hammer on the chop and put that shit to your clothes before he takes everything you've got
Soon as he ran down on you bitch he pulled the Mac from his clothes and takes everything you've got
