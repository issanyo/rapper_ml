[Verse 1: MDot80]

[Hook: Shoddy Boi]

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
If you say you in the Mob you intelligent nigga
But if you get a nigga time, we'll never forgive you
I fuck with MDot & Amp. they hell of a niggas
Seekin' for Islam, we killed hella niggas
You don't need to bring a chop when every clip got extensions
I'm in the '71 with the slap shift in it
We in front of the court finna smack our witnesses
I see you in my set and ask you what is your business here
Take too long to answer that, Ima hit you with every shell
You love the streets but we bout to flood the streets like the Murrayfield
On bucket seats 455 givin' Chevys hell
2-6, 2-5 that's a place you can never chill

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ampichino]
