[The Jacka]
Catch me in the H3
Same place the grapes be, same place that laced me
In the Cold War boy can't escape the safety
The first time I squeezed a trigger cause a nigga made me
Second time was out my mind mayne, gotta prove I'm mainey Still outside on the grind even though it's rainin', thinkin bout back in the days till the AM
Niggas wanna be me, sprayin' niggas like graffiti
Niggas send they runners on the move cuz they scared of me
The game ain't fair yeah I used to let it cheat me but never beat me
Remember Uni Mac and Young Zeeky, James and O Dog
Yeah they still with me, that's Rob Lo, Fed ex and Husalahsi Flights all over the world I pay for eveybody
Been havin K's in the house since I stayed with mommy
Kicked out the house, found a kick in the couch
Starin' at the world through my rear view, thinkin' bout what I been through
Yeah you know just a lotta shit man..
A lot of clappin' nigga.. murder niggas

[Chorus]
When I step through the door hoes blow me kisses
Even though a nigga cold off the syrup and the purp nigga Barely holdin' on go to war without a army I'll make it on my own
Bare face head buster even though I'm well known
Black nigga with the black trigger creepin' through your home boy

[The Jacka]
I was a kid the first time my shit was felt
People don't feel you nigga so don't kid yourself
I'm off top with this shit like a 8 of sip
Aye bitch set me up I'm late as shit
On the real only trill niggas play this shit
I'm ill at rap it's like I made the shit
Everyday I wonder where the fuck the nade went
I'm purp'd out had enough of the same shit
Windows up, tact out on the main strip
Don't trip on The Jacka, you'll be mad at yourself
I call the strap a ham sandwich cause it's bad for your health You iced out but foreal under heat you'll melt nigga

[Chorus]
When I step through the door hoes blow me kisses
Even though a nigga cold off the syrup and the purp nigga Barely holdin' on go to war without a army I'll make it on my own
Bare face head buster even though I'm well known
Black nigga with the black trigger creepin' through your home boy

The world is mine like the Scarface picture
Got the .40 stock nigga leave a large space in ya
I'm in space off the killa, 26 inch wheeler
Amir and Young J I was fenced up with em'
Locked down for a year spreadin' up wit niggas
Tradin' war stories leavin' lead stuck in niggas
30 rounds out the window like fuck you niggas
You get robbed cause you know you put your trust in bitches
I'm a prob, finna get in the extortion business
Learn from it, I'm an animal that eat with a full stomach
Doin' 100 can't take it back after I done it
That's that gangsta shit all my niggas come with
Feel me, rich overnight but I'm still me (still me nigga)

[Chorus]
When I step through the door hoes blow me kisses
Even though a nigga cold off the syrup and the purp nigga Barely holdin' on go to war without a army I'll make it on my own
Bare face head buster even though I'm well known
Black nigga with the black trigger creepin' through your home boy
