[Intro]
Authorities say a pint of codeine promethazine has a street value of between 675 and 800 dollars
A dramatic mark up from the 10 to 20 dollars for a pint wholesale

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Shit crazy bulll, listen
This beat almost HAM
Have my young niggs follow dem
To the crib and hollow dem
Where we live its going down
Where we live its not ok
But its been here so we stay
Know the bread won't go away
Lookin round, they know J.A
Whip pow by the solar ray
2000 on the Golden Gate
Top down through the Golden State
Sun rays screamin off my paint
Sun rays through the solar panel
Kill yaself, you don't know my handle
I ain't never gave a whole (?)
Rest in peace to the young Bo Daniel
Dan G he was like my family
King Freak just like my family
Mac Dre just like a family
My nigga Puma, never petty
Rich City, clips empty
My kids gon have a rich history
From this victory, niggas whispering
Get outta line and I'm 30 dickin him
All hail J.A., long live the king
Woke up one day living all my dreams
Why you fake niggas don't live at all these days
Here with Islam when I thought I lost my way
Here the Jack come now you numb, you lost your taste
Cuz this shit pure, gettin high in a mirror
Higher than a Lear flyin at Top Gear
Smoke a million RAW's but it don't stop there
I don't really care, cuz its just not fair
Bout to wake up your hood but it's kids out there
Hate my enemy, even his out there
We the MOB gotta stand by the rules that I wear
On my sleeve to achieve bigger roles that we playin
And my young niggs lifed, so the MOB always win
Yo, real niggas always win, but we still gotta die in the end

[Hook: The Jacka]
You niggas off
Right now we on
Yall supposed to keep up
What the fuck you doin?
All our cars get better
All our bands keep growing
Say you better than Jack, kinda drugs you doin?
Say you better than Stacks, What kinda drugs you doin?
Ice and a triple stack, even though its snowin
Livin life so we live our life, everyday straight pourin

[Verse 2: Carey Stacks]

[Hook]
You niggas off
Right now we on
Yall supposed to keep up
What the fuck you doin?
All our cars get better
All our bands keep growing
Say you better than Jack, kinda drugs you doin?
Say you better than Stacks, What kinda drugs you doin?
Ice and a triple stack, even though its snowin
Livin life so we live our life, everyday straight pourin
