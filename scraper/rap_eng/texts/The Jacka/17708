Yea, the JA
This that MOB shit nigga
Drought season aye

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
They say you only cry when you know you wrong
And every time you see me its like you need a loan
But you fall off every time I put you on
Guess you all lost tryna come up from my song
Fuck this rap shit, when it's war nigga
Every time I see them suckas gotta pull the trigger
Said you paid me for that coke but I don't remember
Guess I run through so much dope they think I'm gon' forget it
I never notice, but I'm always focused
So I'm smokin Jokers, let em know its real
Everybody know us and they scared as hell
Cause they never show up when I come around
Man I'mma po up, the President want me to dumb it down, but before I slow up
I'll gun you down with this K I roll with
Seen every (????) but this one the coldest

[Hook: Young Bossi]
I'm a hustlah, a black entrepreneur
Nigga its the MOB, throwin kush bricks on the floor
All night countin paper got my hands hurtin
Lean in my cup, drought season and I got the work in
Trappin hard, gettin money, thats my motto nigga
One phone call feel the wrath of a fuckin killa
1-7-7-0-8 you niggas gotta feel us
(???) the streets, a fuckin gorilla

[Verse 2: Joe Blow]
Sumthin 09 with the roof in the trunk
A 2 seater with the ruger in front
Sippin promethazine rollin up kush in a blunt
I'm with the MOB I can have Bush touched if I want
In my 95 Air Max and Dolce Gabbanas
10 racks worth of ice fresh from (???)
Money to the ceiling what a wonderful feeling
On the couch smokin, countin on a quarter of a million
In the streets tryna fit a quarter ounce in a Sweet
I know niggas that'll kill ya for a ounce of that lean
And won't sleep till they touch a hundred thousand a week
Benz same color as a Long Island ice tea
Long nose .44 under the white tee
Scrapin' with a few young shooters that's like me
My muscle in the streets think you packin that Type T(?)
Ridin with no L's in the K, then duck, strike three

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Berner]
OG Kush and baby blue pills got me feelin like a mil
Plug it in and press seal
We don't send em in the mail
I put em on the truck 50 at a time
I'ma shine till they lock me up
Cuz just got out, the word is he's ready
And he's right back in the burbs with the reggie
Set up shop, the only ones with the keisha
The purp's a little cheaper, I dump em and I re-up
East cookin cream up while I'm countin this cash
On the floor there's a mountain of cash
Downstairs, 20 light on my plants, just a couple of weeks
Til I have a hundred grand in my hands
The smell of money keeps my mind right
It's been a long night
I got a long ride home but it's all right
When I touchdown there's more work there for me
I risk my life everyday, say a pray for me

[Hook]
