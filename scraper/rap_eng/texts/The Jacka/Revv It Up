[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Pull up to the club on my street bike
Dance floor with your love she ain't trynna yike
When we knock that pussy out like Iron Mike
Bitches in the men bathroom buyin' white
Hopin' niggas' moment last long
Best dress code but real niggas got they hat on
Fresh J's, strap on, no pat down
And when we left they see how ill niggas got down
Sippin' Act when we drive around
Triple stack; my connect live in China Town
No jokes he ain't trynna smile
So much dough we just tell a hoe turn around
Bitch show me what that shit do
And put it all over this dick when you get through
Put it on my nigg too
Fast shout real bitches ain't scared to...

[Hook: Reign]
