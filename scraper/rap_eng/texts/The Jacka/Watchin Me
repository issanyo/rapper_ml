[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Before I pushed (?) I put 4 in a pickle jar
Came back six and a half, I'm the nigga bull
You don't know about that shit you ain't been here before
Never would of hit the connect if I could get 'em lower
They ain't goin' out like that, it's time to kill some more
You ain't had to do like that, you had it easy bull
Hit the hood, undo my pack they left at the door
Think back then turned my life into a amazing song
Real rap funkin' with Jack you not safe at home
They goin' out flashin' they stacks until they place get combed
Rollin' Sweets pack after pack then got replaced with clones
All you fake niggas relax, put down the microphone
I only get head from your bitch, I never take her down
OPF & The Mob, they can't mistake us now
Real niggas back in the place, it's hard to face yourself
And every time we took a man's life, it was to save ourselves

[Hook: The Jacka]
We gettin' stacks while we scramble around
We gettin' rich while you bitch niggas standin' around
Watchin' me, while you watchin' me
Watchin' me, while you watchin' me
We movin' coke when we (?) around
We gettin' loaf while you broke niggas standin' around
Watchin' me, while you watchin' me
Watchin' me, while you watchin' me
We gettin' stacks while we scramble around
We gettin' rich while you bitch niggas standin' around
Watchin' me, while you watchin' me
Watchin' me, while you watchin' me
