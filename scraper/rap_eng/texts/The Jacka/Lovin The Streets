[Verse 1: Berner]
They told me keep on dreaming boy you'll never be shit
And now they see me at my shows and they beg to get in
I tell 'em pay to get in and walk by with a smile
Ever since I was young yeah I rocked my own style
120 light setup in my basement
My baby mama trippin I'm always on vacation
That's what we call a quick run, I was out cakin
Before my mama died yea I promised I would make it
DEA Agents, more interrogations
Call Arthur Lipton, that's all I'm saying
They got me jammed up, with my hands up, tearing up my car
Right in front of my daughter I can't believe what she saw
Like fuck 'em, they'll never find nothing
They really can't touch us spent my whole life hustling
I'm ready for a change but it's harder thank you think
Just one more run to get me back on my feet
I need it

[Hook: Mozzy]
The say it ain't no love in the streets
But all I get is love in the streets
I fell in love with the streets
Kissin all this mud in my sleep
Ridin with a 100 plus and a sweet
What niggas know about that
The say it ain't no love in the streets
But all I get is love in the streets
I fell in love with the streets
Kissin all this mud in my sleep
Comfortable on the funk on the beat
What niggas know about that


[Verse 2: Jacka]
Me, FedX, and RobLo was little then
Connects put us on cause we murdered all the middlemen
Left home like we going to school but we was in the whip
Moving coke, y'all was broke, y'all was stealing rims
They call me Jacka but I'll never have to steal again
I don't write cause I hope they let you out the Penn
They scream for help cause they goons eating out my hand
Black hole, but Ima Raider and a Niner's fan
My hood cold I'll put a hole inside a man
Or a full 20 TV screen inside a van
I live your dreams, shoot a skull if you not a fan
We The MOB, not involved, then you not my friend
You from my hood we was killing thugs for you to walk around
Realest nigga spitting we the only shit they talk about
Hated on The Jack, Liqz, and Berner but we awesome now
To make it where I'm at right here boy you gotta have it

[Hook]
The say it ain't no love in the streets
But all I get is love in the streets
I fell in love with the streets
Kissin all this mud in my sleep
Ridin with a 100 plus and a sweet
What niggas know about that
The say it ain't no love in the streets
But all I get is love in the streets
I fell in love with the streets
Kissin all this mud in my sleep
Comfortable on the funk on the beat
What niggas know about that

[Verse 3: Liqz]

[Hook]
The say it ain't no love in the streets
But all I get is love in the streets
I fell in love with the streets
Kissin all this mud in my sleep
Ridin with a 100 plus and a sweet
What niggas know about that
The say it ain't no love in the streets
But all I get is love in the streets
I fell in love with the streets
Kissin all this mud in my sleep
Comfortable on the funk on the beat
What niggas know about that
