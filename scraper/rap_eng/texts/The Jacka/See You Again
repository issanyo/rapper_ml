[Intro]
You know what man, fuck it
This go out to all the hoods worldwide, ya dig
All my niggas man
Everybody across the world nigga
Born in the struggle nigga
The struggle gotta continue man
(What happened to the world)

[Hook: The Jacka]
Better never see you again
You with them niggas who killed my friend
This mob shit never end
I better never see you again
Oh, oh, oh
(?)

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I think they know what this is
I came from roaches, no clothes, & no food in my ribs
My older cousin he was hustlin', so he showin me his
He said don't spend your bread on nothin', started choppin' the grams
I started makin' a lil' somethin', I could stunt wit my niggs
We hit the club takin' pictures , bitches stalkin' the kid
I had the time of my life, i'll never be young again
But now I only think money cause i'm finally a man
I only seen my pops twice, since he come from the penn
He missed out on our life, then got murdered off debt
I hardly took a man's life then had to murder again
Alotta rappers say that, but then freeze up with the cannon
And when them suckas was there, I never ran
I emptied out the clip and saved my niggas that time
I'll never forget my niggas that ride
Niggas shoot cause they scared but i'm out my mind

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dubb 20]
20, Niggas want beef, front door I'm servin' ya
Go down my family tree, everybody murderers
Claim you a hitta but we ain't ever heard of ya
You wanna slide wit me? don't be actin' all nervous bruh
My lil' shooters turn it up, not a sound, lot's around, knock ya down, leave ya body in the lost in found
I asked my auntie how if felt when she lost a child
No car to ride on niggas, we walked for miles
So far, I'm lucky to be here, your brother got killed why the fuck should we care?
Gangsta then a motherfucker, really wish I could be square
Get ya ass ripped from all the paper dat we tear

[Hook]


[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Sip a whole eight of glue, ain't no juice but we still go hard
We ain't on no roof, this ain't Juice but we let go arms
We ain't got (?), wit the (?) when your set go hard
Y'all niggas fake, we the truth so I set the bar
To the sky, tree smoke in my eye
Hop flowin' through my veins, cocaine in my ride

The were sayin' crack kills but coke changed all our lives
They were sayin' rap dead then I changed all they minds
Say you beefin' with The Jack, I'll track you down with this Uzi, or the K on my lap make you wish you never knew me
{It's a hit on his life so I left, and wit his jewelry}?
Because he tried to pay less than what he owed me

[Hook]
