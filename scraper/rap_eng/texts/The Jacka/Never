[Intro]
Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable
Aye, It's Jack.. Remy
Revolution.. First, what is a revolution?
Revolution is the solution aye
The motive of a revolution Will not
The objective of a revolution Be televised
And the result of a revolution and the message used in a revolution
Yea, I know you know

[Hook]
Put my gun away.. never gonna put my gun away
Put my gun away.. never gonna put my gun away
Run away.. see the Mob you better run away
You better run away.. see the Mob you better run away

This generation of Americans has already had enough--more than enough--of war and hate and oppression

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
You niggas punks we don't fear nothing
Put your head in my trunk like we deer hunting
Tie you to my truck bed like we bear hunting
Politicians shot dead we don't care of nothing
Man could this really be new world order
I got a new world son and two new world daughters
All we did was speak our mind and now the world on us
Went against the grain they want more of us
I know the knowdledge itself you'll never soar above us
We don't need the government's help so now they wanna shut us
Damn the revolution is near man
We just infused putting tools into child's hands
Damn how easy it is to make one
Sixty rounds flip-flop sit under the Draco
Trynna see another birthday gone
They lyin' in our face so we can't grow

[Verse 2: Remy R.E.D]

[Hook]
Put my gun away.. never gonna put my gun away
Put my gun away.. never gonna put my gun away
Run away.. see the Mob you better run away
You better run away.. see the Mob you better run away

[Outro]
Was no love lost; was no compromise; was no negotiation. I'm telling you, you don't know what a revolution is. 'Cause when you find out what it is, you'll get back in the alley; you'll get out of the way
Run away.. Run away
Never gonna put my gun away
Mob
