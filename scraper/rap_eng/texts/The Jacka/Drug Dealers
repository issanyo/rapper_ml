[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I'd rather fuck with a real nigga and risk gettin' robbed
Then fuck wit a bitch nigga that snitched to the cops
And fucked the game up, for niggas on top
Can never fuck the name up for real niggas that rocked
The truest to do it, time don't stop (stop)
It won't wait (wait wait)
I'm one of them black niggas that got money
You one of them rap niggas that act funny
He wanna have everything that I got don't he
I'll probably lose everything that I got one day
It look cool, but it's a fool my niggas on the news
500 bricks seized, cousin you can never snooze
They always watchin..
The nigga who tellin' and the nigga who coppin'

[Verse 2: Ampichino]
My life of crime money entice my mind
Almost cry every time that I write a rhyme
Recite my line, give sight to the blind
Elegant thugs sellin' them drugs most of my life
Ampichino I go deeper than a deep sea diver
Smoke reefer in a spider I'm the main supplier
Nothin' flyer I'm just higher than the rest of you cats
Spit fire, make em' retire me and The Jack, nigga
Who rap realer? I'm known to slap niggas
Put a pistol in ya face a soulless crack dealer
Niggas run up crack the bones on rap niggas
I'll wake ya game up, I'm known to clap niggas

[Hook: The Jacka]
Drug dealers, open the duff boy it's everything
I guess you can count it out while I check the cane
We lost a lot you can never understand the pain
You know my name but I'll never let you shake my hand
See my face learn from mistake that my partners made
This remind me of the shit that my father played
I looked my mother in the face and told her I was made
Though this the type of life that dig a early grave

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
I got Asian mami's, K's, and Tommy's
Amazing damn force my hand
Fours under the van, fours under Japan
Bape zip-up, you fake fizz up
8 hammers, 0 jammers
One double zero on the e-way in the grey phantom
Great dope great cannons
Grave pits, and my great bitch worth a million
I could break my kicks down but I rather seal em
Send em' triple my bread trip over bread
In my house sometime gettin' rich and listenin' to ballers rhyme
I don't know I try to school you for a lifetime
I always knew I'd be the ruler in this life I'm

[Verse 4: Ampichino]
It's family first, but it's money over bitches
We Mob Figaz I'll do the job with ya
Eye for a eye my nigga I'll die with ya
In the high-rise drinkin' on dry liquor
Down on our knees we converted to pie flippers
Niggas dry snitchin', I was .45 spittin'
Thug religion, either dead or slung in prison
Scum of the earth but we was just young and ignorant
Block dues, blow a nigga out his shoes
I dropped school, bought a drop then I copped shoes
Block rules, serve coke and cop jewels
Fresh off the block with a chop at the high school

[Hook]
