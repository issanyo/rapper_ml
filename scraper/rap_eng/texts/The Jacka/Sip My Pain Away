[Verse 1: Joe Blow]
Blow
Check a real nigga out though
I'm addicted to the syrup so I sip a pint a day
While these broke niggas fading up on tryna buy an eighth
And it's fucking with my breathing
I swear I'm tryna change
But I'm addicted to this shit
Plus I'm getting it by the crate
Riding with this new bitch
Cute thick by the waist
But I ain't even fucking with you bitch
Unless you tryna pay
Always pour up with my niggas
But when it to the face I don't need a chase nigga
Cause I'm sipping on it straight
Niggas wanna show their pimping
Keep some bitches in they scrape
I ain't never with these hoes
Cause them bitches on a date
Keep 2 40's with 30's I keep 60 on the waist
Name a nigga hot as me and Philthy Rich up in the bay
Bet you can't, I swear these other niggas int he way
We the realest niggas in it since Dre
I keep nodding off cause I've been sipping all day
Still give it to you broad day right on Broadway

[Hook: Philthy Rich]
I say it's syrup in my Styrofoam
I'm tryna sip my pain away
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
I say I drink about a pint a day
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
It's syrup in my Styrofoam
I'm tryna sip my pain away
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
I say I drink about a pint a day
Syrup in my Styrofoam
I drink about a pint a day

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
An eighth in the liter got me flashing on my bottom bitch
The syrup man dry and I've been tryna cop another brick
Smoking on Sativa and Indica
I ain't into selling pistols and I ain't leaning
Unless you immediate by blood we related
My loyalty we family it's killas all around me
Drunk all the purple now I'm fucking with this red
Tryna drink my pain away cause it been fuckin' with my head
I'm a nothing ass nigga with a million dollar mind state
Ashes on my True jeans bitch won't you drive state
3 bands nigga what I spent on these red bottoms
Broke ass niggas don't understand where I got em
Cause I remember days I was rocking X Jays
Don't forget the 900, two bricks for the 900
(?) special bought 3 so everybody could eat
Out of school by 3 to get off the rest of my (?)

[Hook: Philthy Rich]
I say it's syrup in my Styrofoam
I'm tryna sip my pain away
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
I say I drink about a pint a day
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
It's syrup in my Styrofoam
I'm tryna sip my pain away
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
I say I drink about a pint a day
Syrup in my Styrofoam
I drink about a pint a day

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Everyday I sip glue
To forget what I been through
Ma say she be right back
But she ain't comin' home
Uh, twist a bat sip another zone
Smoke 30 shots
Nothing but knocks call my phone
The 'jects is where we all done grown
Move with real niggas
Murdering everywhere I've gone
Young hitta sippin' bo with no sickness
Or doctor's prescriptions
I ain't even tripping with em
Long as everybody listens, nigga
But I'd rather just body victims
Slide through, over the roof and let the shottie lift em
All my life repped the Mob cause I started with em
My niggas here from out of town I send a car to get 'em
Mafia, hood niggas that's popular
30 in my 9, ain't got time to sock you up
Feds on my line they outside binoculars
Still dumping shells on my ride like a taco truck
Meck tryna give me his line but all he got is (?)
Pour eighth in my sprite cause tree don't get us high enough
Ill niggas ready to die but they ain't fly as us


[Hook: Philthy Rich]
I say it's syrup in my Styrofoam
I'm tryna sip my pain away
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
I say I drink about a pint a day
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
It's syrup in my Styrofoam
I'm tryna sip my pain away
Can't kick the habit
So I drink about a pint a day
I say I drink about a pint a day
Syrup in my Styrofoam
I drink about a pint a day
