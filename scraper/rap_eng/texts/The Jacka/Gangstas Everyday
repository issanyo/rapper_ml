[Hook]
I ride with gangsters every day
So we strapped everywhere we go
And bust choppers where we stay
I'm surprised we made it through

Hold up (hold up) hey
I'm a (I'm a) hey
So what up (what up) hey
Here we come (here we come) hey

[Verse 1]
I got that Mob shit all the time
Can't get that crime shit off my mind
30 bands to my name, put it all on the line
Fuck a fair exchange, I gotta win or you dyin
Man I'm just tryin to get the most up out the streets
Leavin niggas smoked, think it's a joke? Don't get out our way
We call this soft shit white, break it down, bring it back
To survive, it's a wrap if you ever cross the Jack
We just live from the trap, you and I know this slap
Though we in the mob we thank god for everything we got

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Remember the J-A, cause I'm real and they fake
Went to go cop again but it ain't got the same taste
But it's from the same place I said I want that old shit
Then pulled my gun from my waist
And if you pull that shit again I'll shoot you in your fuckin face
The bitch nigga swore to me ain't nothin changed
I could take a life and never have to touch you, man
Better make it right, I'll never trust again
Just make me bust a head, you better use your brain
Before you get found slain over fuckin 'caine

[Hook]

Step up, if you're dumb, and get slumped, with this drum
I got rich, with my nigs, in the hood, where I'm from
You ain't cool, you a punk, and I kill, and you run
If you're real, you should come, to my hood, and get on

[Hook]
