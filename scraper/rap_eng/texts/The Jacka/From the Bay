[Verse 1]

The Bay Area, yeah boy that's where I'm from
I remember '85, that's when the crack would come
A lot of niggas got rich, but most these niggas got stung
With years under they built, tryna feel what it felt
To be the nig, watch the ice that don't melt;
'86 through '88 the game got bigger, we done hit the block
Swatting baby ninjas on our way to school
Park my shit around the corner so fly so cool
Young niggas, Brooklyn breed emcees, the Bay breed drug dealers
You got a youngster that flows, I got a young nigga
That push coke plus he got hoes, stay on the road
He can't understand life but grab the mic and make the track explode...

[Hook]

And you know I'm from the Bay
Mothafuckin A-R-E-A
Yahmean
No other place I'd rather be...

And you know I tried to flee
To another mothafuckin scene
Yahmean
It wasn't thug enough for me...

[Verse 2]

On my way to the port to drop my nigga Cormega
On Too $hort birthday plus all the Figaz together
The boys put us on the weight to hustle out up in the weather
Yup, '85 turned out, hit the corner here
Then hit me on my burn-out, when you niggas gon learn bout
The mothafuckin bay, it's superthug where I stay
From Frisco, North Richmond to O-A-K
Central, South Richmond and EPA
Pittsburg got the coke for a price you must pay
Yeah boy, believe what they say
Ain't nothing scarier than the Bay, high-speeds every day
Adolescents tuck weapons, niggas bleed every day
You got to have heart just to visit where I stay
And I been everywhere, ain't nothing thugger than me
Yo, we live the shit that you see on TV
Word...

(hook)

[Verse 3]

Fuck 'em, one time, like hitters on the payroll
Hits on the streets, the radio don't never play so
Don't nobody know who the real niggas is
I dedicate this rap to the mothafuckin Figz
3X Krazy Askari-X, The Click
Messcalene, JT The Bigga Figga
Tha Gamblaz, them my niggas, The Young D Boyz
Mac Mall, Neva Legal, Sick Insane, Lil Ric
Mr. Brave, The Hoodfellaz, Sincydal
San Quinn, Mac Dre, Willie Hen, Too $hort
Fatha Dom, Lil Bruce, Mac Shawn, RBL
11/5, Guce, Sandman and P-O-D-E
Can't forget G-O-V, and Seagram rest in peace
And Rappin' Ron rest in peace too, I got my ear
To the streets too, this for the Yay, and they never could
Defeat you; The Ghetto Starz, Big Block and Richie Rich
2Pac and 5150 was the shit
So was Digital Underground and Souls of Mischief, Spice-1
Poohman, Dangerous Dame, and Young Cellski
C-Bo, Yukmouth and Nutty-B, you out-of-towners
Study me, want me to show you how you should be
You niggas thugs now but we been that
And I'm the proof cause now it's back where it begin at...

(Hook)
