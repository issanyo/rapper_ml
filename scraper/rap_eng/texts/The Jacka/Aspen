[Chorus]
I was in my beamer girl leavin' my mansion
I'm pushin' more snow than the skiers in Aspen
I'm just a young thug livin' dreams you've been askin' for
Paper comin' fast baby I can't pass it up
I'm from the hood but I live in a mansion
I'm movin' big coke you can never imagine
Paper comin' fast baby I can't pass it up
I'm just a young thug livin' dreams you've been askin' for

[The Jacka]
He ain't ready for The Jack he hear the smack in my rhymes
Everytime I pick you up I got a strap in the ride
I'm thug as fuck , you all in love I be laughin' inside
I be lookin' all crazy hat down on my eyes
I be drivin' all crazy but we make it alive
We make it back safe, we was in the black scrape right
Take you on ya calls yeah we be up late night
Life never take a break makin' paper til' the daylight
I'm a drug dealer I move everything they like
You be right with me livin' everything I write
It's the life, it's not a fairytale
She got a heavy tale, like a killer-whale
I'm with [?] free Husalahsi
The Shower Posse make it rain on the party
Keep it lit when you come home we gon' murder everybody

[Chorus]
I was in my beamer girl leavin' my mansion
I'm pushin' more snow than the skiers in Aspen
I'm just a young thug livin' dreams you've been askin' for
Paper comin' fast baby I can't pass it up
I'm from the hood but I live in a mansion
I'm movin' big coke you can never imagine
Paper comin' fast baby I can't pass it up
I'm just a young thug livin' dreams you've been askin' for

[The Jacka]
Even though I'm gone the love won't go nowhere
Remember that? Or was it too deep for your ears?
When we met, I was on a flight to the crib
Of course you will eventually fall for the kid
You from the La that's dope, I'm from the B.A.Y
Must be a doctor or a lawyer cuz' you sure are fly
Next stop LAX I'm laid over till' five
I'll be home in a minute I got chicks online
But I guess I just rock em' and forget em' in time
All I know is I can never give them a dime
This is showbiz so I guess I'll see you around
I'm the nig now but I started off undergroud

[Chorus]
I was in my beamer girl leavin' my mansion
I'm pushin' more snow than the skiers in Aspen
I'm just a young thug livin' dreams you've been askin' for
Paper comin' fast baby I can't pass it up
I'm from the hood but I live in a mansion
I'm movin' big coke you can never imagine
Paper comin' fast baby I can't pass it up
I'm just a young thug livin' dreams you've been askin' for

[The Jacka]
I'm on a world tour with a knot in my hand
Every time I do a show I toss it out my fans
Knocked a new one backstage when we got done playin'
The promoter cashed me out then we hopped in the van
She showed me around the city brought some good tree with me
Out here to the neck wish my niggs came with me
I'm so crispy the girls unzipped me then kiss me down there
A lot of times I run into a down pair
Who just wanna have fun and wild out somewhere
Take em' to my room and I watch em' go dumb yeah
Out to the night time turn to sunlight
Then do it all again cuz we only live one life
So live it up the struggle continues but I'm not givin' up
I'll never see you again but you'll be in my thoughts
They'll never need me again but I'll be in their hearts
The only gangster that meet so we'll never part

[Chorus]
I was in my beamer girl leavin' my mansion
I'm pushin' more snow than the skiers in Aspen
I'm just a young thug livin' dreams you've been askin' for
Paper comin' fast baby I can't pass it up
I'm from the hood but I live in a mansion
I'm movin' big coke you can never imagine
Paper comin' fast baby I can't pass it up
I'm just a young thug livin' dreams you've been askin' for
