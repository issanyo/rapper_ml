Shit yea, tryin get my timbo scrilla
Pump kush, air kicks by the truckload nigga

So respect a niggas mind, you in trouble if you
Ever try cross a boss, then we'll come and get you

I dont like niggas dawg so be cool
All i cook is coke dealers, turn his brains into seafood

Bullets in the K, as big as your lady's lips
Chop turn your life out leave you smellin like baby shit


[jacka]
Devilz rejects, coke in the p-rex
Got so much doe, never know where im'a be next

Smoke so much dro can't remember where my teens went
Ye ain't never seen shit

Niggas takin shorts, makin suicide notes
Not me, i got pour like a pope

Yea cigarette, the biggest treat
Married blacker than the jet

Magazine, bag of cream
Yea that crack, this is slap

Visine bottle, fresh white a shakin up the smack
Take it up with jack you got a problem then try divin' filthy ground

Demon like you guys i got em fiendin like a piper
Gas my bike up hit the boat i let it go dont be surprised if i explode ye' know

I live in hell, but the world cold
Starin' over a stove, cookin coke, same time tryin'a be like hov

Change time, this life of mine ain't nothing different than yours
Beside the crime, the ones who died, and you keep your ass indoors

Ampichino, i'm fresher than colgate, plus i got yay for the whole state
I blow weight, 8's n the half's and whole cakes

Im the plug at the hob of the tri-state
Devils rejects, nigga we fly weight in on 747's i put coke on the highway

Nothing but europeans up in the driveway
Stay high till i die, im'a go out the fly way

Hop up a spaceship, dufflebag cartel
Cop heavy game, get money and spark shells

The heart of hustler, watchin time fly by
Ran up in the church with my clapper fresh of a drive-by

Homocide rate keep rising cuz the coke dried
Old man fishing saw but dead bodys floatin' by

How dope am i, im fresh like some coke whites
You can get the whole, boatload for a dope price
