[Verse 3: MDot80]


[Verse 4: The Jacka]
Nigga beefin' with the M, he got to die
Squeeze the trigger on seen till the after life
I'm on to catch a drain, cocaine in my (?)
Always on some cheddar wish I was a better father (?)
Fuckin' with The Jack, play the back if you ain't got no stripes
You hear the shit we make this is weight we cook up at night
Gotta thank God but I never look up in the sky
I must be a problem you never look me in my eye
Headed to the top only way I wanna look is fly
Young bull say he doper than Jack? Nigga must be high
Lost his mind in Iraq or in a rush to die
When The Emperor speak don't interrupt The Don
Or end up in a permanent place underneath the pond
I'm the nigg, pyramid with the stars aligned
M-Dot at the line we'll never fall behind
The law tried to make us seen small but we were falling giants
