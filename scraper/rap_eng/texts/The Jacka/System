[Hook: The Jacka]
System, What you ever do for me? Nothin'
Do you wanna knock me down? For nothin'
What we ever do to them? Nothin'
System, system
What we ever do to you? Nothin'
Do you wanna knock me down? For nothin'
Do you wanna lock me down? For nothin'
System, system
What you eva....(Do for me?)

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
All my jeans called True Reli
That's because before I was a teen I was movin' D
My lil cousin ma' smoked out he gotta move with me
And by the time he was thirteen knew how to move a key
By the time he was fifteen pulled up in a V 1-2
Gettin' high with my gun drew
I put the whole slums on ain't even gotta come through
Still I show up with guap for y'all to thumb through
My hood is mean where the kicks ain't Kung-Fu
I'm watching Khan on a eighty inch Samsung
Niggas turn bitch when they bread gone
Me n Dot gettin' rich cause head on
Straight movin' coke with more stripes than a snake
Then Babylon come make your niggs separate
We just trynna have fun but we can't catch a break
With these snitch ass niggas and these bitches in the way

Do you wanna lock me down? For nothin'
