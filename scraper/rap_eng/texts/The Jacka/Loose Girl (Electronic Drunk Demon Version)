[Verse I: Mitchy Slick]
She used to save my number, images, and pop ones who knew the day
You could drive the Elcano and see her on the corner
My first puppy love across town -
Only twelve years old and already hearing -
Blowing - like a thirty-six-year-old chick
That a stared in two thousand or more porno flicks
My nostrils wide open then I seen her with my big homie, Clebone
Next thing you know she was hoeing
I learned the hard way, if she’s loose and choosey
Get out the whore’s way and let her jut the booty
Her uncle was - her young, so she good at it
I’m hearing my salary, she done already looked at it
On the net tryin’ to find a rest haven, some might
Walk out the strip club had to get her breast augmented
She tell you she a model and she going some place
That ain’t no website - that’s a Myspace

[Chorus: Krondon]
She don’t mind getting drunk
And don’t remember nothing when she wake up (Cool)
That girl’s
Loose whenever time
Dick and hairy, long as the balling, black card carryin’
I’m just glad that she’s my hoe
See how you think all this shit's paid for
I am not a gigolo, I really can’t lie
But whether you’re young or older, same rules apply
I have done better things to make dough
But if you gonna come, get what you came for
She don’t mind getting drunk
And don’t remember nothing when she wake up (Cool)
That girl’s
Loose

[Verse II: Phil Da Agony]
Three buffalo girls dressed up in high heels
Roundy outside the like the Buffalo Bills
Still tote like black Rambo, GI Joe
Weed farm like Old McDonald, E-I-O
See I flow bloody like a menstrual
Psycho, like no, - on her period
I inherit the flow cut glass like a twenty-four karat
No, I didn’t go to Jared or Jacob
Silly hoes want to powder their nose
In bathrooms and I ain’t talkin’ 'bout makeup
Come back like nothin’ happen like I’m Boo Boo the Fool
To cool mother- keep rapping
Your sixteen is almost up, half full of half empty cup
It’s all about which way you can set it up
Weight it out like a Libra, a cannabis of reefer
God sent an angel, fly diva like Aliyah, I see ya

[Chorus: Krondon]
She don’t mind getting drunk
And don’t remember nothing when she wake up (Cool)
That girl’s
Loose

[Verse III: Jacka]
This girl open for the stroll
She felt a gigantic poke coming to my show
Drunk on the dancefloor
See her little red eyes peering through the damn smoke
Giving me the, “Damn I just wanna give - ” look
She don’t give a - , she won’t remember when she stand up
In the morn, I don’t understand what she be on
But I be gone ‘cause it’s the hoes who pay a nigga, -
I’m just playin’ with ya, but it’s not a game
See this knot in my hand finna buy everything, yeah
Coke dealer, but the women think I entertain, they
Must be insane, I’m a - party animal, motherf- cannibal
Let your wife - me even if I can’t stand the hoe
Tell my niggas the story, it was funny ‘cause they done it too
Mainly we be running through all these fake models
Shut up, -, goggle
Do it thou wild with my Loui on this bottle

[Chorus: Krondon]
She don’t mind getting drunk
And don’t remember nothing when she wake up (Cool)
That girl’s
Loose whenever time
Dick and hairy, long as the balling, black card carryin’
I’m just glad that she’s my hoe
See how you think all this shit's paid for
I am not a gigolo, I really can’t lie
But whether you’re young or older, same rules apply
I have done better things to make dough
But if you gonna come, get what you came for
She don’t mind getting drunk
And don’t remember nothing when she wake up (Cool)
That girl’s
Loose
