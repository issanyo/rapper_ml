[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Can't move around cause our shows so packed
Yall hold me down while I use these raps
We ill, we hard, yo we all we got
We kill, we rob, but we still give back
To the hood where we from is where the real love at
Where the blacks die young but we still live fast
But it's gangster out here boy we all won't last
But we famous out here n we all want cash
Drugs in our bloodstream they take away the pain
Then shorten our life span so important to write down
Thoughts that I manifest, nobody gave up on me
Not givin' up on myself think about who I am
A nigga from the struggle, Fedi that's my cuzzo
Ready whenever it's war hello (?)
Have you ever lost a case n wondered where they bout to take you
Still didn't let em' break you
Never will mistake you for one of them suckas
Jack and AOne you know we real motherfuckers

[Hook: AOne x The Jacka]
Never will mistake you for one of them suckas
Jack and AOne you know we real motherfuckers x3

[Verse 2: AOne]
Woke up this morning got blessed from my momma
Rest in Peace
