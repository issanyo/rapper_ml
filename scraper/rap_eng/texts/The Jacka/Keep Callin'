[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
Freaks keep callin’, hollerin’ at me often
Wantin’ me to come and put balls in her jaw
And I can’t help it
Her pussy’s just creamin’
Moanin’ and screamin’
Usin’ her fingers and she wants this ding-a-ling
And I’m gonna tap that ass

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
After my show I pick you up from the hills and shit
And she don’t waste no time goin’ down with them lips
You love that shit ‘cause I’m a star and all that
I just left the party where all the broads at
Just to tell you where to put that jaw at
(Splash) The bitch spazzed when she saw that
I’m not playin’, baby, I’m everywhere
In your face, in your hair, you’re fuckin’ wit’ a millionaire
It’s some real faire, and yeah, I get every time
Every girl I meet, she wit it every time
I’m gettin’ higher, there is none flyer
She got me gone on flight
I feel me inside her, I fuck her on another night

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
(She said) It’s like torture listening to your freaky tone
Teasing a nigga when you know it’s hard to leave you home
Once or twice a week is not enough for you, you need it
And I ain’t got the time, but every now and then I’ll beat it
When you whispered in my ear sayin’ that your pussy’s moist
Dick get stiff at the sound of your voice
I have no choice but to take a chance, take a spin
Take my pants off and let you break your man off
But make it home safely though and play it off cool
Yeah, I’ll see you soon, don’t call me, I’ll call you
But before I get into my car, cell phone ring
Got to turn it off before she fuck up everything
I need time, I need my space, I need my grass
But she’s always there when I need a piece of ass
And I’m tryin’ to stay low pro
But oh no, shit, there she go

[Chorus]

(Dev, what’s up? It’s the Jack, boy)

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
(She said) I’m a fuckin’ druggie—how I’m lucky?
‘Cause I push D and these bitches swear they love me?
Why would you trust me? Strap under my front seat
Album out, finna tour, hella whores lust me
All that shit is nothin’, you down to the end
I’m like a Clinton, I hate niggas, I down one again
Them boys ready to test my Tommy, I found one again
We were seeking for Islam, I found it within, yeah
I could drop a bomb, I’d rather crash a plane, man
Rest in peace Saddam, ‘cause that was our main man
Me, I’m like a don, hooked on the fame, mayne
Pull up in my whip the hoes be like ‘Wow’
I’m Xerxes, I’m Khan, all I ask is that you bow
