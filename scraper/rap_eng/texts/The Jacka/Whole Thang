[Verse 1: The Jacka]
One shot, have you on a toe tag
No Pops, grindin' rocks on my notepad
You ain't no shit, but this dope shit won't last
Task hit the crib, now I'm hopin' time go fast
Never thought they'd find it in my drawers should a harvest
No one can control us, call us soldiers cause we all mesh
Went from watchin' (?) Show to thousands at a rap show
Was young gettin' dough sometimes I wonder where did that go
Don't go home till the bundle gone even when it got cold
I was sellin' Ron, friends died before we got on
It's still the same sellin' caine with my strap on
Beam on, team strong, wasn't that long
Before we did our thing, never sleep, live your dreams
I've been through hell, find yourself cause you make believe
Wanna fuck with J, but it's really hard to face The King
Pull up in a spaceship where it's best if we just save our means

[Hook: Berner]
Kingpins, come from the dope game
Wide awake, ridin' around on cocaine
Numb from the game, yeah, my heart feels no pain
All we wanted was a whole thang
Lost souls, but we on our own lane
See things a lil different through these gold frames
And I don't feel no pain
All we ever really wanted was a whole thang

[Verse 2: Berner]
Coke cash, blowin' on my Metro
Six phones, grow weed, and I sell blow
In and out of state, with a trunk full of elbows
And when that money touch, I'mma wrap up and send those
I was rockin' Air Force 1's, no Shell Toes
Seen a man get 25 years cause his cell phone
Real talk, I can never tell though
Heat a nail, watch the wax melt slow
So high, heart beatin' crazy fast
Bright future, but I had a crazy past
Eighty racks in a smell proof duffle bag (Cookie Bag)
Coke money, wrapped up in rubber bands
Man, I'mma do it for my city folks
Baby know I'm with it, I'mma need every penny though (Cash Out)
Look at her eyes before she leave
She gonna bring that money home back to me

[Hook: Berner]
Kingpins, come from the dope game
Wide awake, ridin' around on cocaine
Numb from the game, yeah, my heart feels no pain
All we wanted was a whole thang
Lost souls, but we on our own lane
See things a lil different through these gold frames
And I don't feel no pain
All we ever really wanted was a whole thang

[Verse 3: Cormega]
In the game since my early teens
Dirty currency in abundance kept me very clean
I know my mamma a angel, I felt her wings
Protect me when my father wasn't there for me
Streets raised me, family apparently
Loved me more when I started makin' records B
No lie, when I caught my first felony
I got visits but only one was killin' me
I ain't losing sleep, I got vivid dreams
To make reality, everything to gain
By any means if need be flip the thing
And conspicuously snitches out here givin' names
If you ain't ever live it, you can never feel my pain
It's sincerely from the street not the window pain
I was born among many, few remain
Real recognize real and do the same

[Hook: Berner]
Kingpins, come from the dope game
Wide awake, ridin' around on cocaine
Numb from the game, yeah, my heart feels no pain
All we wanted was a whole thang
Lost souls, but we on our own lane
See things a lil different through these gold frames
And I don't feel no pain
All we ever really wanted was a whole thang
