[Intro: The Jacka]
I think they know what this is
Shout out England
Brum Town, London
Jamaica all Jamaica listen
Canada

[Hook: The Jacka]
Stay far from the linking up anyway
Stay clear cause they linked with your enemies
Smile up and I got dim face everyday
Yet still them gon' link with your enemies
They want me for dead by niggas I was with
Never like when tings don't go my way
One shot have you stretched in your driveway
Car full of laughter on the highway

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Have you stretched in your driveway
All the coke I pitched, I did that shit the fly way
Kill niggas, you fake niggas buy away
Set up 20 chickens when we get there we ain't trynna pay
Nigga, cause we know crime pay
Comin' through the hood but the trap is like a giant maze
It's all birds from Orion, I was on my giant faze
Black astronaut believe em' when they sighting grace
Hash mixed with pot, and pass it through our colonies
I been through a lot, got stripes like a Ganja seed
Pass through your block n leave when I wanna leave
I see niggas lookin' but they pussy like a woman's (?)

[Hook]
Stay far from the linking up anyway
Stay clear cause they linked with your enemies
Smile up and I got dim face everyday
Yet still them gon' link with your enemies
They want me for dead by niggas I was with
Never like when tings don't go my way
One shot have you stretched in your driveway
Car full of laughter on the highway

[Verse 2: Laroo]


[Hook]
Stay far from the linking up anyway
Stay clear cause they linked with your enemies
Smile up and I got dim face everyday
Yet still them gon' link with your enemies
They want me for dead by niggas I was with
Never like when tings don't go my way
One shot have you stretched in your driveway
Car full of laughter on the highway
