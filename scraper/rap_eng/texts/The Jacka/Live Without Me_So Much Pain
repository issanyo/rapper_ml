[Live Without Me]

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
This so dope, you really don't hear shit like this no more
'Cause these hoe ass niggas too worried bout the radio
4 deep in a rental whip, 30 dick in all our clothes
You ain't never seen shit like this, cocaine in all of our nose
You ain't never seen kicks like this, Kingpins in all of my shows
Y'all don't own no clones like this, grow lights in all of my homes
Niggas won't forget about me, they wives know hella shit about me
She like don't stop, she not shit without me
Cause that album drop, she don't live without me
Fake niggas can't stand me, you ain't Mob, you ain't my family
Even if you in my family, free Kaz, free Miami
Sugawolf, that's my nigga and Bub and Trigga
Stay out the hood, you won't be a victim
'Bout to hype the drugs and throw it deep to Lennon
I open up my eyes soon as the flight descended
Would never cross the Mob if my life depended
I never sent a pack and they ain't like what's in it
Brotha he in the trap, but doin' a life sentence
Nowadays if you know what I witnessed
Stuff that every nigga think he know our business
Put a drum on your head if you think you the business
How you fuckin' with Jack' and you niggas is bitches

[Hook: The Jacka]
You don't live without me x4

[Verse 2: Berner]
I sold a hundred pounds before 12 o'clock, this dope money
We whip foreign cars out down the block, that's ho money
See, we don't hold money, we blow money
These rap cats be so funny
I'm in a hotel with a snow bunny
White girl, nose runny
It's 6 a.m. and I'm wide awake and I'm thinkin'
How these haters feel, they wanna see me leakin'
New gold will make 'em sick to see me eat while they were sleep
God, let my daughter live her life and give me freedom
Watch what you say on my phone they listen when we speakin'
All this smokin' and this drinkin' and this killin' for no reason
Good smoke in the air, the type of shit that I'm breathin'
Cost 4k a piece, yeah, I'm outta town, I keep 'em
Drought Season
In October they'll be cheaper if you need 'em
New flavors in my jar, me and Jigga back to breedin'
I'm smokin' and I'm leanin' and I'm feelin' like a Kingpin
In this game, fast lane, yeah, me and Jacka speedin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Stalin]
You could never see my vision from your low position
Watchin' these fake niggas, that's my gangsta intuition
Stay strapped, make sure I got my ammunition
In the kitchen, shirt off, whippin' with my ice glistenin'
Nigga I can turn 30 into 44
Make a bitch who never thought about it wanna ho
Make a nigga never sold crack wanna grind
Make a nigga that never had nothin' wanna shine

I can do it, I can do it (she can't live without me) (x5)

[So Much Pain]

[Verse 1: Berner]
3 cribs and a condo
Smoked out fed hot convos
On my fuck the world shit, yeah swallow a hollow (die slow)
And that money came quick but we spent it much faster
Harlem world we was smokin' Dutch Masters
Thinkin' bout my mother I'm screamin' fuck cancer
Two trucks full brand new hammer
This .45 hold my pants up
Louie shoes, Cookie coat, and a 38 gram blunt
I'm sittin' in the back of this big body Benz
I can see my stones glowin' in a limousine tint
On a one-way flight, only stayed one night
Ima go with a smile if they take my life
We die young but this here forever
Leave my daughter a letter, don't believe what they tell you (I love you)
This  cristals cold and this weed tastes good
And the chain on my neck would talk if it could
464 grams, that's a grower's pound, yeah they love me I'm the man
When the harvest come Ima load it all in
I got em for the low if you want it come and spend
And shout out to the south, Atlanta to the H
You know I got rich when I brought it outta state
There's so much game

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
They'll never take me alive though, O.G. tapin' my convo
In the hood he a beast but he cried to the 5-0
Kill yourself nigga, I really admired you
Turnt us on to a game you can never retire from
Could never get a job cause they test for all kinds of drugs
Boys hit the lab, I was there they ain't find the drugs
Cause I had 'em tucked in a place they could never find
And after this I'll probably have to murder a friend of mine
Astaghfirullah, I never feed my children swine
Seems like I'm fallin', I truly need your help this time
I know I'm blessed the way you manifest the hopeless mind
Into a open eye, never seen a God in the open sky
But I read the signs so I know you are
Right there, unseen like the air you feel
On your skin unseen like the evil Jinn, you know I kneel
I speak another language when I'm makin' prayer, this must be real
Ask god how I make it here? I'm from Brazil!
That's a place you'll never make it out, I'm glad I'm here
Though everywhere I been they treat the blacks...Unfair!
All I try to do is make it pop, somewhere
All my fallen soldiers, dead or locked, you'll live again

[Verse 3: Carey Stacks]
