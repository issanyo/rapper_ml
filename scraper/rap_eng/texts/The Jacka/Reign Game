[Intro: The Jacka]
Killas in the cut we bust moves with them
If they not the Mob we bust holes in them
Niggas talk to hoes like they know I am
I'm on the corner sellin' rocks till 5am

[Verse 1: J. Stalin]
I do big shit, I drive foreigns
You ain't gotta ask me if I'm strapped, I stay holdin'
Shoot my way up outta jam if they try to box me in
I've been tryin' to live righteous I've been livin' in sin
Mamma prayin' for me everyday she just want me to win
Devil on my shoulder he want me to committ murders again
I've been paranoid so right now I ain't trustin' my friends
That's why I be rollin all around with the strap in my pants
Now I ain't Chance The Rapper but rappin gave me a chance
Ever since Banga Dance I've been running it up
Livewire got the whole world throwin' it up
And now I'm in a Porsche but this time it's a truck
And the bitch on my line but I ain't gonna fuck
She fuck around to set me up and that be just my luck
I said the bitch up on my line but I ain't gonna fuck
She fuck around to set me up and that be just my luck

[Hook: Reign]
I got big  dreams I'm not hopeless
We gon be fine if I focus
I push hard lines I do dope shit
I reign game for you to soak in

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
I pull 100 out the bank cause I'm movin' yae
You'll have earned my respect till you lose your way
100 in my chop I won't lose again
Empty out they head if we go with them
Killas in the cut we bust moves with them
If they not the Mob we bust holes in them
Niggas talk to hoes like they know who I am
I'm on the corner sellin' rocks till 5am

We hit the party in the 'Rari, the star of the story
I'm on the scene even tho the law lookin' for me
Brought up in the jects but I never dressed poorly
Highschool so much check kids takin' tests for me
Young Ahks, braveheart, K shots don't alarm me
Hoppin' on a boat to get this coke you gotta part to sea
To pay for it, to get it back is not a part we play
This the coke business gotta kill yas once we far away

[Hook]
