[Intro: Husalah]
Yeah, yeah, nigga
Turn the Zapp up
Cilantro, let's do it my nigga, let's ride out man
You feel me, that's all we doin' man
The mini  baby

[Verse 1: Husalah]
Jelly belly, lime green with the red top
That's lime and Coca-cola, '73 Caprice drop
Stupid knock, dumb knock, chip whose to shot
Disney land, Ferris wheels, dumb mollywhop
Pull up slowly, and all the boppers on me
Then I ride off fastin' and I start to yogi
Everything seem fun in my '71
I pushed the petal in every whip that Chevy done
From the '77 to the '79 Brandy Whine
To the '88 Monte S-Sloppy fresh
I mean overdoin' custom shit, stupid nasty
I got work for doin' a half a mill passing
He cut me loose, every stainless steering wheel is fancy
"Do you mind if I take a digital for my wife Nancy?"
Then the top came down and I dipped off
The whole time I had the mini and a brick of soft
Oh, you love the whip, man
Mollywhop, man
Four on six music, man
Yeah, 2007, BITCH

[Hook: The Jacka]
There it is and I see your Deen
There it is and I see your Deen
These niggas mad 'cause I might nab they ho
These niggas mad 'cause we pullin' up on 4's
Real niggas love this song
I know 'cause every ill whip got it on
That nigga Hus is gone
But he'll be back, so it's a must we carry on

[Verse 2: B-Luv]
I live up to the name
I really ride Tonka, tuck your chick
Before she see me, 'cause I might walk up
It's B-Luv, I put my T in the air
You look stupid in the dictionary, my niggas is there
We dumb, we here, cuddie, we really don't care
Hundred Thizz niggas with us, we ain't goin' no where
Bet a gig on your wig, stop traffic on the freeway
We retarded, don't listen to what you say
My rims is twenty-six, they older than me
Got no option but to do it big, my cuddie lookin' over me
Your chick all over me, but I don't chase hoes
I come through, Tonka Boy, I'm already chose
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
That's ridiculous
That's what they say when me and young Hus slide through
We don't give a shit, nigga, 'cause we some damn fools

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
The world cold
You need our help
Guns, Dope & Religion leanin' on a delt
The paint drip and I'm sippin' on a four of lean
I got my hoes doin' shit you ain't ever seen
I let the whole album slam, boy, that shit clean
So don't remove the king
It was straight
I'm tryna' get high and drunk though I'm feelin' great
I make millions, boy, I don't do real estate
I'm from the realest state
B-Luv & Hus sittin' up like Tonka trucks
I'm in space, bring me down 'soon as we touch
I come back with a sound that's ill as fuck
I know 'cause real niggas give it up
When they see they say "you ill, nigga, keep it up"
I keep in touch with the niggas I got love for
Them niggas thugs though
Tonka Boyz, we covered in Willy Wonka boy
(Nigga, you know what I'm sayin')

[Hook: The Jacka]
There it is and I see your Deen
There it is and I see your Deen
These niggas mad 'cause I might nab they ho
These niggas mad 'cause we pullin' up on 4's
Real niggas love this song
I know 'cause every ill whip got it on
That nigga Hus is gone
But he'll be back, so it's a must we carry on

[Outro: The Jacka]
Check it out nigga
It's the mothafuckin' Jack boy
You know what I'm sayin'
My niggs though
Tonka Boyz mayne, B-Luv & the Hus boy
You know what I'm sayin'
You niggas, you niggas 5'8, 5'9 nigga
You needa bring a trampoline or a lil laddar or somethin' to get in the whip with us boy
Yeah, 'cause we sittin' way up bitch
