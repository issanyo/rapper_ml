[Intro: The Jacka]
No disrespect to Promethazine or codeine
Know what I'm sayin'
No disrespect to Xannies (Perc 30s)
Know what I'm sayin'
All those downers, mane you feel me
No disrespect to no drug in the world man
Know what I'm sayin'
Be happy, live free, ya dig?
The struggle will not giveth up
This for the weed smokers
Know what I'm sayin'
Like I and I, listen

[Hook: The Jacka]
If you've never smoke with J before
Then you've never felt this way before
If you've never smoked NuWave before
Then you've never been to space before
If you never smoke Snowman before
What planet are you standing on
If you've never smoked Girl Scout before
You can help yourself out the front door

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Fire up the cone and tell me how it sounds
Love OG, never let me down
But right now with some brand new strains around
That Blue Ivy got a fire smell
That Y got me feelin' fly as hell
That Sherbert straight work forreal
That Master don't work for him
That Bubble Kush, it dont work for them
We smokin' shit that yall worshiping
That Cherry Garcia just came in
And it already left a big impression
Don't pass me the tree if the shit is in question
My weed farmer, yeah, he smarter than a college professor
He let me smoke Cherry Pie when the shit wasn't tested
But first time I smoked, man, it had to be my best shit
Best strands been gone for over ten years
Jack in the place. you know what's in here
X in the place, got the loudest in here
I know we got the best cause I've been everywhere
Won't forget the Jack cause I'm leavin' the cherry there
Come to my pad, niggas sleep in every chair
The only one rule here is you smoke everywhere
You got good weed, boy put that shit in the air
It's time to move on cause I think that we finished here

[Hook: The Jacka]
If you've never smoke with J before
Then you've never felt this way before
If you've never smoked NuWave before
Then you've never been to space before
If you never smoke Snowman before
What planet are you standing on
If you've never smoked Girl Scout before
You can help yourself out the front door

[Verse 2: Berner]
I’m on that new shit, yeah, you know I got it
Had to roll two joints before I bought it
Two week flush before I chop it
Outta town, everyone want it
OT, it's the weed man, whats your bag like
I'm on Satellite with Paul Wall
Fifty-five pounds in my trunk
My H-Town plug, yeah, I gonna want it all
I use to North star purp in the drought
All in the East bay, down in the South
All through the mid West, then we got Scout
Fifty-two-hundred for a goddamn pound
I'm rich off herb, Frisco Bern
Yeah the first one, who ever smoked Sherb, shit
Blue gloves and the vacuum sealer
In my old garage, me and Jack countin' scrilla
Fresh blue glue, number four gorilla
That Y smoke tough, taste like vanilla
Smoked out, car smell like a grow house
Me and J.A. poured up a four ounce
We smoke that bag that you can’t buy
In my city we got plenty
We don't ever run dry
Jet Fuel, hardcore wax got me feelin' fly
In Kansas city with the whales, countin' money all night
KC and Tacoma, the aroma of the strong
Comin' out the van
In the game, smokin' til I'm gone
Come on, come on

[Hook: The Jacka]
If you've never smoke with J before
Then you've never felt this way before
If you've never smoked NuWave before
Then you've never been to space before
If you never smoke Snowman before
What planet are you standing on
If you've never smoked Girl Scout before
You can help yourself out the front door

[Verse 3: Young Boss]
Smoking out the pound inside the shit
That’s what we do new way little homie
Just keep the swooshies roll
With raw papers we ballin hard on
Ya’ll haters you never smoke bubble gum
Go cook you ain’t smokin player
That’s why in live i stay high
Live the lime life  bubble down the cherry
A hell of amber ice and
And KK a lot of niggers like to fuck with gas
I pass on that cousin I’m smoking stupid stuff
Light it up light it up I’m pulling up
I look them up which park of smoking ham
My niggers JA got the thing on crazy
That boy edge full of tat many keys to fire
Four plus zip i can't get no higher
Smoke a lot of damn trees let me pick on up
Fuck with the trees we be living it up
You know you kinda a crazy guy
The shit give me wedgy eyes
Yea some times it gives me wings
Make me feel like i can fly
I’m always choosing to stay street
If i use the swoshy sweets
Taking up that blue line and i never
Use that out of leap
Meal mill only all i know about is you
Most of mini neesa needed
Like a jacket off the edge
Had a kinda step had this cookie jar
In a tray and breshetta field trip
Gotting me feel jhonny blaze
You always too hell a cheap
I can get you good grade
Four fifty every zip and i smoke that new wave
Trigger graces in the graflex
Smoking fatties to the face tralenters with the oil
Got you thinking you gotta blow his life
And i always gonna bring the munchies
Off the crack joke oh we laugh that funny
She make a stupid pussy bring the money
You smoke high till you put your dick in the coffee
Took two dabs and straight up coughing
So into my body and I’m ready to took off
About to fall but the flower ain't blossom
Six foot three in the middle of august
