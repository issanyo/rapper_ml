[Verse 1: The Jacka]
JA, he ain't got a rhyme book
With my nigga A smokin (?)
Front a nigga Ron, gimme mine, 'fo yo time up
Bitches on my line, I'm sippin lines, I ain't tryna fuck
Lil niggas (?) ride the world, see a giant comin'
(?) never gotta tell my bulls fire somethin'
Niggas sell you dope they'll (?) like they can't die of somethin'
Mind on a mill, they know I kill don't gotta hire gunmen
Killas is around still I (?) for my love ones
Send you to hell, niggas rat just cause they saw somethin'
I hit a nigga pad, double back like I lost somethin'
I'm sippin' Act but this is for whoever lost someone
