[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I wake up in the PM, my car is European
Our clothes are European, my house is a museum
Paper way longer than the time that I'll be breathin'
Gave up a empire be-fore the bulls'll weaken
And that was deep thinkin' cause they all faced murderers
Happen for a reason they only feel the emperor
My kids' father is the real deal, why would they have to work
I don't even got to work just pull up to a active turf
Let em know i got the work that's how it happens first
Play us then the straps'll bust, play and you'll be at a church
But paying for a pile of dirt, nice tie white shirt
Mamma in the front row, everybody there hurt
Life went to that to rushing knocks in they vehicle
And running in spots where they trap and take kilos home
MDot & Jack we doper than where the needle go
This ain't the wild life channel, i'll let a eagle go

[Hook: MDot80]
