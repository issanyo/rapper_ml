[Chorus: Matt Blaque]
Come on let me see you back it up
I wanna feel that pretty round thang
Shorty all over me
All I really want is shorty all over me
All I really need is shorty all over me
Now grind lil mama, move your hips like this
Go ahead shorty get it, just get it all over me
All I really want is shorty all over me
All I really need is shorty all over me

[Verse 1]
No cologne, just kush and Patron on me
All morning long niggas high, sippin lean
I be so on when I get my nose clean
Everywhere I go girl girlies scream my name
Yeah lil mama what you feedin that thang?
In the Bay we like damn without Dre, it ain't the same
But we keep it lit
On the dance floor with a hoe and she stupid thick
Oh you say you don't, okay, let me see you do that shit
They call me the J-A, the one who never play games
You know I'm in the game but they ain't how we play
I'm a real nigga, with this rap shit locked
So you comin' with me 'cause you know it don't stop

(Now back it up)
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
That's not a gun in my pocket, I'm just happy to see you
When niggas say they iller than Jack, that never could be true
Got the type of swag that you never could redo
Yank em to the party all you see is paint drippin
Girls say they know me but I never could remember
Got so many one me but I'm focused on a thick one
Bout to go get her, rock star life forever
In the club stewy, big bottle of Louis
Tryna dip with a model, out here f*ckin with it truly
Got the place poppin, now that I walked in
Girl tryna put it on me, I'm like alright then
Give it to me, they pursue me 'cause they all like him

(Now baby back it up)
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Is that your girlfriend? She all on me
Better take her home before she go on with a G
Got her in the corner goin dumb to the beat
All the little chicks can't keep they hands out my jeans
Listen, I'm The Jack, all my patnas real Gs, baby, do this shit
Slap it in reverse, wind them hips, I know you feel that dick
Let me calm down, know my sound so ridiculous
Comin out your speakers, you get weaker as you hear this shit
Let me be your teacher, I'll reach you, I'll show you this
Push that ass out, baby, get it all over this
'Cause I'm on rock, I think a nigga had too much to drink
And it's two o'clock, I'm tryna get it all over with

(Baby back it up)
[Chorus]
