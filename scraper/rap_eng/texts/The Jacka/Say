[Verse 1: The Jacka]
First time I seen the pack man, he'll give me little
Cause I started with a band like Jimmy Kimmel
Blowin' trees back then callin' sacks pillows
And every nigga sellin' ten it was all Hero
The more you get closer have a clearer picture
My niggas tell me "Yo I wanna live it with you"
Now all I gotta do is get a lil' richer
And only party with the niggas that saw it with you
Now everybody ain't around that started with you
Most your niggas in the ground, doin' time in prison
When shit fall down only time we listen
Have me sick on trial till they read my sentence
My influence was enough to call off the witness
Life's wild damn I'm proud of all our niggas
It's been a while now I wonder what they gonna say
You the nigga if you livin' what the song say

[Hook: The Jacka]
We really livin' what the song say
I'm really livin' what the song say x2


[Verse 2: A-One]
Yo, you wanna meet the connect nigga this shit real
I want my shit in hundreds no twenty dollar bills
It's not a Neptune bitch it's forreal
When I pull it out the package niggas know it's fish scale
Diamonds are forever Kanye West
Have your bitch in the back, call it Mitchell & Ness
I had the bitch on one call it Tribe Call Quest
You gonna need a Q-Tip to clear this mess
I'ts real Mafia ain't nobody stoppin' us
We pullin' up on motorbikes stompin' niggas out
You better get used to this overnight package
Cause I throw it in the air, catch it in a day
I'm ridin' with a brick while I'm ridin' in The Bay
I'm ridin' with a P when I'm ridin' in the A
You couldn't tell me how to do it cause I'm doin it
You niggas better get your mind right nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Berner]
Black tee and Jordans, groupies givin' me neck
When your worse nightmare is to lose your connect
I've been there, shit now I'm the plug
All my girls work the club but guess (?) fuckin' bitches is fun
A hundred grand was a lot back then
Black mini-van full of mid, put this gold watch in my hand
Xannies and a little mud, baby girl I'm into drugs
Sell that pussy for a star your PI is a bum
Extended stay in the A, 300K
I was wide awake, paced until the money came
Tryna get this money home, that's the hardest thang
When I landed in L.A. they pulled me off the plane
Strange, I ain't have a damn thing on me
Leather coat, few rings, gold chains on me
In The Bay tryna let the Benz swang homie
D-Boy, young legend in the game homie

[Hook]
