[Intro]
Mob
SHIIIIET
I know you know what this is
Yeah, Jack
(I know you know what this is)
A-One, Mob, I know they know
Listen
Jack

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Fuckin 'round with a rich man
Now you leavin' out hospitals in wrist bands
Shoulda been in this Carmelo like Knicks fans
Motherfuckas act like they trouble then get fanned
In the drug war had to bury my best friend
Tryin' not to worry so I'm smokin' the best strand
Run a world tour and now I'm back with jet lag
Swishers get borin' so I'm smokin' a jet Zag
Everytime i got locked wasn't nothin' but a setback
All that ever did was set me up for a comeback
And every bitch that left me they tried to just run back
But I'm gettin' richer everyday I don't want sex
Hunnid-thousand cash in the streets I don't want checks
I did everythin' now wonderin' what's next
I come from no AC, no carpet, the rough Jects
There's gotta be more my nigga what's this
Mob shit

[Hook: A-One]
I'm a project nigga
Dope dealer nigga [x8]

[Verse 2: A-One]
