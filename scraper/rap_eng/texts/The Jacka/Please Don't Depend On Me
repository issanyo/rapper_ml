[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Sorry, we had to meet like this
Twenty racks in my fist, shoppin' for 'fits
When Harputs was in the Rich, I was a crack dealer
Nigga everywhere we go it was a MAC wit' us
30 rounds in the clip wit' four-fives in it
Still got it to this day, probably gon' die wit' it
You love how I fuck wit it, the MOB I'm up in it
Make a tough livin', murder just to feed my children
It's fucked up but we chillin' in a place you get ya face knocked off if you enter
Years done gone past, my crew is gettin' thinner
Rest In Peace Mac Dre, King Freak, and Young Nella

[Chorus: The Jacka]
I'm a young rich nigga
But please don't depend on me
I'm in the drug war
The walls closing in on me
You see the rims
Same color as the Benz homie
Suckas scared to come outside
They know they owe me

I'm a young rich nigga
But please don't depend on me
I'm in the drug war
The walls closing in on me
You see the rims
Same color as the Benz homie
Suckas scared to come outside
They know they owe me

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
Chopper in my lap, diamonds on my necklace
Corner full of crack rock, good trees for breakfast
Holly on my seven-one, Davin's on my '06
Ridin' by the projects wit' somethin' that's so thick
Chea, and she lovin' the kid, yeah and I'm a known shooter I'm havin' money ya dig
And I ain't scared of the pen neither
The ghettos tryna kill me so I keep the heater
I cook cocaine wit' very little water
Cut 12 on a O' my nigga I'm a baller
Sat down for a minute but I'm back home
With more of them blue, yellow, and them black stones (and them black stones)

[Chorus: The Jacka]
I'm a young rich nigga
But please don't depend on me
I'm in the drug war
The walls closing in on me
You see the rims
Same color as the Benz homie
Suckas scared to come outside
They know they owe me

I'm a young rich nigga
But please don't depend on me
I'm in the drug war
The walls closing in on me
You see the rims
Same color as the Benz homie
Suckas scared to come outside
They know they owe me

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
SC vanilla pearl, what happened to the world
Pullin' up slappin' ya wonder what happened to ya girl
If I start clappin' ya wonder what happen to ya curl
Damn we be missin' Furl, that was our nigga mayne
King Freak passed the gun blast nearly missed my brain
Since then I been insane, since hustle in the rain
Clapped a nigga for his chain, shit ain't no where near the same
Since I first got in the game, 'cause when I was young boy
We clapped niggas for fame, right where we hung boy
Then rapped about it in the place you scared to come
Niggas holdin' it down, we really dump
Jack and Mess fuck rap, wear ya vest or get slumped

[Chorus: The Jacka]
I'm a young rich nigga
But please don't depend on me
I'm in the drug war
The walls closing in on me
You see the rims
Same color as the Benz homie
Suckas scared to come outside
They know they owe me

I'm a young rich nigga
But please don't depend on me
I'm in the drug war
The walls closing in on me
You see the rims
Same color as the Benz homie
Suckas scared to come outside
They know they owe me

I'm a young rich nigga
But please don't depend on me
I'm in the drug war
The walls closing in on me
You see the rims
Same color as the Benz homie
Suckas scared to come outside
They know they owe me

I'm a young rich nigga
But please don't depend on me
I'm in the drug war
The walls closing in on me
You see the rims
Same color as the Benz homie
Suckas scared to come outside
They know they owe me
