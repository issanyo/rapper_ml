[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Moms gone, Pops locked, I don't go to class
Next time  I seen that man again a thousand moons had passed
Fam said I'd end up like him, cause I movin' fast
Jack & Hus, '01 we was movin' glass
First-class from Hawaii, first time that I flew with cash
When I got home balled out they was gon' be mad
Then I fell back, no stacks make a lonely man
Jack & Lil' Sean left the line, he was only ten
Never a poor sport cause the torch in my homie's hand
Told me I would scorch, back then was my only fan
Movin' tan, task hit the spot I was gone again
Murder on my mind but I be gone long this time
23 and (?) out the box is where I learned to rhyme
Sell a hunnid push-ups a day and hit the mainline
I come from the Bay nigga, real gangsters never cry
And when I leave the cage I'll be sellin' records nationwide
