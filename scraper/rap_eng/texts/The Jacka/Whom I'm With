[Intro: Liqz]

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Tell me how these fake niggas go, from silly boys
To movin' bundles of blow and say they killed before
This that real Mob nigga, you've never felt before
It's war outside you never helped us boy
Pushed up in my ride, seen my enemy, nailed the boy
Anything that I left alive my young niggs destroyed
In the bin where I found out what I'm out here for
And made me be everything that come out my mouth is pure
Jack ill, bitches really hand over thousands to him
(?) like I really made it without the music
(?) like I really made it without the music
Coke sales but we wouldn't of made it without producers
