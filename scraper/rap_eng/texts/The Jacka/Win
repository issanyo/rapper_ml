[Verse 1: Berner]
If this money keep on comin', I'mma buy me a chop
I'm on a island talkin' money, wanna buy it or not
Hunnit pack pushin' stones bigger than yours
Five dollars on each, please, give me some more
I got eight new flavors in a few more stores
In California, shippin' weed around a sold out tour
Balenciagas cause that Louie shit got played
Two-hundred-fifty on a Greyhound train
We really breed and you breathe on made up strains
I'm on a first class flight, on my way to Spain
We really livin' what the song say
They be like, "Bern, can you tell me how that strong taste?"
I'm gettin' cash in a trap, where Lebron play
And got a yellow bitch, look like Beyonce, crime pays
Trust trappers on my flow, I talk real life only
I got youngsters, that'll take your life for me
Bern been rich since '09 homie
Get money, move snow white for me

[Hook: Husalah]
When you start gettin' money and these suckas start hatin'
Sometime when you win you lose
We learnt so much game but felt so much pain
Sometime when you win you lose
It's all about survival, but when your loves don't survive
Make a nigga think about life
Make a nigga ask why

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Bitch ass nigga, you was scared to touch me
Big clit, porno flick, I'mma kill the pussy
I see they lookin' right now, but I been a man
Business man, hit my line but I'm in the paint
Sippin' drank, but I really tryin' to catch a train
Gettin' rich, but everyday I gotta catch a plane
Gettin' guap, better watch where you set your game
Because i'm fly, simple high, have 'em catch a train
You don't mean what you say 'cause you not insane
From where its darker, nigga shot you 'cause you rocked a chain
And when I lose everything I rob a bank
All my niggas hard we the Mob 'cause we hold our weight

[Hook: Husalah]
When you start gettin' money and these suckas start hatin'
Sometime when you win you lose
We learnt so much game but felt so much pain
Sometime when you win you lose
It's all about survival, but when your loves don't survive
Make a nigga think about life
Make a nigga ask why


[Verse 3: Husalah]
We love The Jack', but I was tired of music
I came up shootin', watchin' rivals die for a movement
Or comin' high off the dark, often not when I do it
Most ghetto, you choose to forfeit they mind before they lose it
When all to top it off, they die at the very bottom in ruins
Cause and effect like how society systematically do us
So they rebel from the structure
And from the schools become truant
Perpetuating the cycle that becomes evolution
Seeds evolve into Revolver-totin' youth that'll shoot you
As little kids took a oath to this criminal movement
Hopin' this song redeem our souls and wake you up like a rooster
Still be clutchin' a Ruger, hopin' you die if I shot you
The only way we stop tryin' to kill you is if you took your jihad
Long live The Jack'
I give a fuck about rappin'
I came up watchin' my foes fall and die from me clappin'
They say that life is a road and if the life that you chose
Consists of murder, then boy you better be clappin' a K to your own
It ain't no woofin' and barkin', bitch its the Mob from the start
It ain't no woofin' and barkin', bitch its the Mob from the start
And ain't no mercy for you suckas, Jack and Foo is my bros

[Hook: Husalah]
When you start gettin' money and these suckas start hatin'
Sometime when you win you lose
We learnt so much game but felt so much pain
Sometime when you win you lose
It's all about survival, but when your loves don't survive
Make a nigga think about life
Make a nigga ask why

[Verse 4: Liqz]
Uh, baby I'm a
