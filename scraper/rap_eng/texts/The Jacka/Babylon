[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I just wanna rap, Babylon wanna wrap me
Cuff me on my line, with my little girl lookin' at me
My nigga had you robbed, you tried to cop
Bull you shoulda got at me
I'm starin' in the mirror, my nigga all I see is Larry
Nose full of clam, businessman, no secretary
Sucka want me down but the nigga never said it to me
Illests niggas out, remember that you said
They want that fake shit all the time
Till the point that they forgot they know me
Hard to face the Don, on so much 'Ron you'll never get to know me
They ain't with the shit that nigga Amp'll have you fixed for me
Blow'll have you stabbed, C-Bo my only big homie
Niggas on parole, Lil' brodie gotta piss for him
Niggas on the  Xans make your bitch suck our dicks for 'em
Only buy work from the (?) till we get strong
Toss you in the surf they won't find you till you just bone
Sixty in the chop, don't got a Glock 'less the clip long

[Hook: The Jacka]
We see our sisters crying Babylon taking they loves away
Mamma crying Babylon taking her son away
Just for trying to shine take your time and find a way
Sickness in our eyes they love the Mob we know the way
Hunnid in our ride time to slide we on our way
Not too many tries but this time we on our way
They ain't taking lives they not with me
Killas in our ride we on our way

[Verse 2: Ampichino]
