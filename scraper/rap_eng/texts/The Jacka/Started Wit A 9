[Verse 1: The Jacka]
AR n my mozzy cuz I go hard for my family
If u ain't catchin' no bodies I hear you can't be nobody
I was raised  with my granny cuz suckas murdered my daddy
Put a slug in my enemy then a kid in his mommy
I used to think I was Pac, got Thug Life on my tummy
My partner rib pokin' out, he sellin' brown to his auntie
Put your partner in the ground and (?)
I'm pourin' my soul out now the world can't stop me
They knocked my bull Pum down then the hood got ugly
Kingpin big gunmen but we still don't love it
I heard a nigga on my line cuz his girlfriend dug me
He somethin' like his girl now cuz I killed that pussy
Strike up outta town cuz the 5-O' lookin'
I let him get his traps back then after that I took it

[Hook: Lil Rue]


[Verse 2: Buss Da Husslah ]
Nine grippin, 4 oz sippin
Clips extended, Blunts get winded
Runnin' trap business wit out no permission
Been havin' premonitions of gettin' caught slippin'
So I keep the hand thang, square bitches stay distant
Rollin' suckas out da game like Michelin
Locked down doin' time ain't nobody visitin'
On da grind all the time all I see is benjamins
Yellow ova da gate nigga call me bussie wimbledon
Westcoast nigga in baby blue pendleton
Mob shit baby I just lash all the middle men
Husslah mayfield i'm ya new pusherman
Gotcha bitch turnt like she ran outta Ritalin
Member of da mafia you fuckin' wit some made men
Drugs money n murder like im locked up n da state penn
Only bought 9 but da wrist brought back ten
