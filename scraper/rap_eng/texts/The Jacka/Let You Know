[Verse 1: The Jacka]
We'll always be in war if we live forever
But all my enemies die in front of the trigger
You said you movin' cream so I fronted it to you
You lyin' to the king but who are you foolin'
Polygraph test can't lie to the ruler
Yall ain't with the shit say goodbye to the (?)
Coke in my mustache higher than Kootah
Brown in my Crown gettin' high with the hooligans

It's been a while I still love you though
If you love The Jack then never let me go
I just thought that you should know
Never let 'em down cause I'm the best for sure

Blizzard in my home but I'm not dressed for snow
Niggas buyin' blow is all who comin' through
Run up on me bull and then I'm gunnin' you
Sixty rounds straight gon' humble you
Throw a upside down â€œW"
They tell me Babylon about to come for you, shiit
If it ain't Mob I ain't comfortable
Hard to stop when every nigga honor you

[Hook: The Jacka]
It's been a while I still love you though
If you love The Mob then never let us go
I just thought that you should know
Never let 'you down cause we the best for sure
I just thought I'd let you know
Sixty in my chop'll never let it go
I think errybody know
Caught up in the life don't wanna let it go
