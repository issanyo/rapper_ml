[Verse 1: The Jacka]
In Africa, where you get your ship took by pirate
And them my heroes, in the ghetto where our cries is silent
I've been to jail but my niggas gettin' ills  for violence
Sippin' mud but the drugs make us forget we giants
And make you forget who Allah, they say we owe it to science
Then make you think you dope as Jack cause the labels is bias
Meanwhile we warring on the set, you only safe if you by us
I'm from the Bay, we not gay, so the majors won't sign us
Green Door, Cookie Co.  smokin major exotics
100 niggas in the stu but we twistin' up private
Another show, packin dro, bout to border United
About to go where it's far, where the summertime climate
Fuck the bull over then someone gone have to give you the Heimlich
No matter who you are you'll be a star if JA behind it
