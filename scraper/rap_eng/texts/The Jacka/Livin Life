[Verse 1: MDot80]
Whip look spacious, pockets feel racist
Ball until my death, and i kept it to the basics
Blaper it´ĺl burn you, but the chopper spray like mace, bitch
Holes start poppin´, leave you with a bad taste in it
40 give a face lift like 40 on that bay shit, need to knock a bay bitch
Mdot K Kit (?)
See them white squares, we call that shit a paved brick
The feds come don´t say shit, fuck em and they cases
From the feds to the state pen, i know niggas doin life
Gave my nigga 74, instead he got a hundred years
Look the judge in his eyes and never shed a fucking tear
Looking in a broken mirror, cell block all sick

[Hook: MDot80]
We livin' life like a movie first show chop suey
Few niggas shot dude
When they had the block doin
When they had the pies doin
When they had them pies movin, pies movin, pies moin

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
You sold your soul to get a deal, you not ill you envy me
All I did was package crack, I'm still on MTV
If I shoot my strap you collapse from the injuries
Never went to school cause the jects is what interest me
Turn a zip to a zip and a half is what's interestin'
I hit the Ave. then I put my niggs on instantly
I'm in The Mob I swear to God you gon' die if you mention me
In a ill manner my banana makin' history
C-Bo put us on only God know what it meant to me
No radio play, no big deal, they still into me
Never bring my kids to the trap, but they still live with me
(?) niggas wanna steal with the ill niggas'll give away
(?)
I just my time in the real hittas y'all never brave
Built a empire so my minors'll never slave
Throwin' up The Mob forever nigga I'll never change

[Hook]
