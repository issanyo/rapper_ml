[Intro]


[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Illest nigga alive but you don't remember Jack
Sellin' dope in the Mob, bet you remember that
The murder rate high where we livin' at
Only place for the Mob to make a livin' at
(?) now would you live in that?
Cause just to survive we gotta peel a cap
They see I'm tryna get high what kind of pills you got
2 for 65 what kind of deal is that
Invite killers in our yard cause we sellin' smack
To get my kids a life I gotta mail a pack
My niggas need on so I front 'em crack
And when they bring me what they owe I don't want it back
I just wish that I could do more
Turned our business to a trap when we opened up a shoe store
Tried to change our life forgot what we do it for
Time fly straight don't want to lose no more

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: A-One]
I'm in the trap with a brick it weigh a thousand
You in a Honda nigga I'm in a Audi
I got the line but nigga my thoughts cloudy
I'm from the project housin' but walk proudly
A bitch don't got no paper for me it don't arouse me
Put a four in a Sprite it got me drowsy

[The Jacka]
Pull up on my bike the fiends crowd me
Pull up take your life with a Browning

[A-One]
So swift so smooth at the same time
Sellin' kicks and Bo at the same time
My nigga Tay and Boom doin the same crime
Paper on my mind everyday I grind
Knock a nigga down in the day time
Got your lil girly on my FaceTime
In a car with a .30 on my waistline
You lil niggas wasting time while I'm raisin' mine

[Outro]
