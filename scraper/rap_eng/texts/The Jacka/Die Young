[Verse 1: The Jacka]
(Jack)
Listen, time never phase me, yo
Still got the crazy flow
Sleep till the sun go
Dressed when the night come
I remember the leather task force & Fila two tones
Girlfriend 14, her moms and her pops gone
I was 13, my pops in a state dorm
Moms on her own, felt her pain but she stayed strong
No education, no job to retire
On the Mob, I was selling coke two years prior
In the sixth grade, black and grey suede Pums' on
Stay fresh, but I only trap to bring food home
Out here hustlin' but I'm nothing like the lames you've known
Shit's easy, survival was the skill I've honed
I'm not dreaming no more, I'm already grown
& the road I took so dark, can't find my way back to 'em
But you're always in my heart
So I made that song
& when it seems to fall apart
You should play that for 'em

[Hook X2: The Jacka]
They say the good die young
And he taketh away
If niggas talking they don't live it
Then they're forced to pay
I'm just trying to be a man in this poison land
Forgive me father
They forced my hand

[Verse 2: Berner]
Your girl want to pay me, yo
Pull her let eighty go
Hit Billboard, no play on the radio
I do it for my mom and my homeboys too
Rest in peace Pretty Black, Roger, and Pum
They took Phil too soon
When I got that news
I was counting out cash in a hotel room
I felt sick to my stomach
We ain't take that trip
I was only nine when my dad's place got hit
I watch my daughter sleep
Think, Lord keep me around
I know these haters can't stand seeing me smile
I'mma live
New whip, White leather and all
And I make a few mill, every year in the fall
Light deps too, yeah, I was on back then
Black leather coats, gold ropes, big chrome rims
In '08, we were running the game
And when I die I pray to god they remember my name

[Hook X2: The Jacka]
They say the good die young
And he taketh away
If niggas talking they don't live it
Then they're forced to pay
I'm just trying to be a man in this poison land
Forgive me father
They forced my hand

[Verse 3: Richie Rich]
Jack look
Got it for the low low
Been getting dough dough
You know where it comes from
I know where it go though
Why they call me double
When really I'm solo
I got cinco
Only somebody call ocho
Hustling on parole
Nigga I'm loco
Never seen my face
But recognize the vocal
I ate with Russell Simmons
So how could i be local
But a lot of that bullshit
I just couldn't go for
Sipping on patron
Thinking bout my bro bro
The gave him thirty years and all i got is a photo
Last time i seen this nigga we was wearing polo
They found thirty ducks in the trunk of his Volvo
Shit is real
When you're out here in the field
Got me teaching my boy how to lock and load steel
I know it hurts
Buts shit too scared go to church
And all this cosmic slop i think about my nigga Lurch

[Hook X2: The Jacka]
They say the good die young
And he taketh away
If niggas talking they don't live it
Then they're forced to pay
I'm just trying to be a man in this poison land
Forgive me father
They forced my hand
