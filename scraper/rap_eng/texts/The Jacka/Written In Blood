[Hook: Mistah Fab & The Jacka]
Please show a nigga love
That's why I'm thankful for things that I never had
All the bullshit I've been through and I ain't never mad
You can say whatever you want but it's whatever (?)
I know folks that been through worse and they was never sad
I'm getting calls from the Penn. from my childhood friend
Sayin' man what's going up, how you been
I got a letter that was written in blood saying
Please show a nigga love, please show a nigga love


[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I think about you all the time, searchin' for where they love us
I never thought I pull my time, never have I begged so much
Our hood is a war zone kids know it's awful there
Me n J prolly had to kill for y'all to walk through there
Me and Sean found Islam but we was lost till then
A general who felt so invincible till I lost my niggs
Sippin' glue, '02, first time I took a swig
Freak died later then Mac Dre, that took the wind
From out my chest, small fam treat my friends like kin
Never rest cause we trap while the world spins
Enemy creepin but I'm thinking bout his girlfriend
Better pray he make it through the weekend way we on them
Jack and Fab got 'em mad but they tuned in
Thank Allah for what I know, one day'll take our soul from here

I ain't talk to my momma in 5 months
