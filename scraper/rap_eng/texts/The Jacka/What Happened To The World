[Intro]
Let us turn back the pages of history and start..
From the very beginning..




[Verse 1:]
What happened?
I don't know, we fought then I clapped him
Before I murked the nigga he was in a circle rappin'
My pride is all I got, when I travel gotta sav it out
Why you smilin' when it ain't shit to laugh about
A empty clip after 7 shots blasted out
It's harder shit fall asleep every time I sit
So go hard everyday cuz this can be it
I'll go far as to say I am in it thick
The world ain't the same so why even trip
Why care? I'm still here cuz I'm caught up in
The world, it was very different then
My words, owe it all to the tip of my pen
I know it's hard, livin' in the ghetto man
But bein' broke is the life I'll never live again
I know it's hard, but it haven't always been
Forgive me God, I'd save the world but I'm just a man

[Verse 2:]
What happened? To the world is my biggest question
You got 3 or 4 straps and still feel threatened
Check 3 or 4 traps, I got skrill waitin'
You got a lot of fly shit, but your bills late
You niggas never try shit, but you will hate
I catch ya, I'ma turn ya ass into shark bait
Over the San Mateo bridge or the Golden Gate
The golden rule I'm a fool, squares don't relate
I need mine right now I'll never wait
Yellow tape, another notch for the murder rate
Another day another steak on my children's plate
The new king the new great
Sirat al-Mustaqim, It's Ramadan I'm about to break
I suggest you find Islam before it's too late
I'm about to mow the lawn so I can see the snakes
Catch them while they sleep then empty out on they place
Any givin' day a hundred rounds in ya face

[Verse 3:]
While you was playin' with transformers and go-bots
We was d-boys transformin' on stove-tops
Young d-boys transportin' that old rock
I could've sworn we seen a lot
It's cold and it's raining, but I'm still on the spot
Posted in the cut watching all the fiends rot
When I was in school I just stared at the clock
Tryna get it over soon doomed from the start
You can keep your shoes, just want your jewels before we part
Don't make me empty out this clip on your maroon heart
Well groomed, don't assume every nigga is a mark
Got the .40 on my waist and the cater in the Lark, nigga
