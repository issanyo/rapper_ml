Thinking of you

All I can do
Is just think about you


[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Yo
You think about me, all I think about is weight
You want me all the time, all I want is cake
Even though I think you fly, I got a lot on my plate
Locked in them jail gates, all I did was pace back and forth
Crime thang, raced through my thoughts
Lights shined on me, was a slave to the dark first
I slave 'til my heart burst, Allah made it easy
Never had a hard days work, just another slave, yeah
Never take the same steps that I took
Just another soul in the hole sweetheart, and nobody wept
If you ever see me high as fuck, head in my hands
Damn, I feel bad, just know that I am

You say you miss me, I believe I miss you more
And when I get this paper, I'll never leave no more
In the mean time make salaat, praise Allah, yup
Keep a lock first, make it easy on your moms'
And when I'm not home, remember that I'm

Subhanahu wa ta ala
Please have mercy on my mother and her mother
'Cause they raised me to a man and a Muslim
When I got locked, I seen my mother in the court room
I was in the Dunya, should have knew it wouldn't last long
Bless my grandmother cause she loved us, but she passed on
The backbone of my fam, my whole life
She was headstrong, kept the lights on
Though we lived in the slums, never slept on the floor
We was kinda poor, but we really never had it hard
And all she ever said was make salaat, praise Allah
So now everyday, I'm
