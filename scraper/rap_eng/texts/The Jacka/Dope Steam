Jack smoke heavy, in a black box Chevy
On the run facing years, but the crime seem petty
On the crime scene baby, pushin' cream since the 80s
From the O to the Rich, from the Lo to the Bay
Fuck school, love the street life ain't nothin' save me
I see, yeah, but only what's in front of me
Drivin' with my gun on me, sometime my son see me
With the mack 10 on the side of my hip
Hop in the scrape 30 rounds in the clip
Do a thousand to the hood, clown around with my niggs
I just frown at the pigs, hop out my shit dumb slappin'
Pushin' kicks to the AM, but I got on jackin'
Rest in Peace King Freak, he got on kidnappin'
Tie a nigga up, take off my mask then smack him
With the ass of the Desert E I be packin'
It's hard to last out here, forreal, ya'll just rappin'
