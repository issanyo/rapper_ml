[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Ron graduated on time they fell in love with him
Boogie got a job whole fam fell in love with him
Funny thing is back then thought I was one of them
Good job proud black men thought I'd be one of them
Thinking bout my past my Grans I try last for her
Just to put a smile on her face I went to class for her
Gave my last to keep food in the place now I'm in Africa
It must be nice reflect on times when we ain't have too much
Visit tribes seen for the first time realized I had too much
I'm in the trap dopest who rap why did I ask for this
Whole thing then be what you dream watch how you act for it
Poor people pray for the dean never ask to be rich
Hard to resist wondering will I be missed
Drug dealer prays for my farms like i'm Sungenis
What's the use of making songs if it's meaningless
I mean I know right now I'm stoned but I mean this shit
