[Verse 1]
I do numbers but I'm still dope as fuck
Shortchanged by one of my runners cuz he was broke as fuck
Caught him at the store with his momma, and still woke him up
In the backseat with his brother he showed us where he was
Soon as I pulled out the cannon I knew he'd open up
Push soft, left his ass standin' because I owed him one
Real shit sack on his face he ain't know who we was
Real niggas back in the place it's time you show us love
When the dope shit went away you was searchin' cuz
Never sleep on us again move the newer drugs
Can't turn away from the game it's all I ever knew
MOB shit diss it my nigga I'll bury you
Time tick it won't wait, better hurry dude
Crime shit, time up-state is what you never do
Hard shit hold up a bank and hope I make it home
Plans never go the way planned, so I never do em'

[Chorus]
Remember my name
30 on my lap, bitch you know I'm the mayne
Don't front on me now, everywhere I go you know I'm gon' hold you down
Remember the nig..
Burner and a mask bitch you know what this is
It's over my nig..
Ever cross the MOB I'll bring the chop to ya crib

[Verse 2]
Open up my eyes.. Will I close them? Never
Just reach the un-advised until they close forever
Ain't got too many tries, but here go another
A mill just on his deen and he is like my brother
I'm tryna walk the mustaqÄ«m though I'm straight gutta
A pocket full of cheese bouta walk it straight through customs
Out here movin' caine, and we hardly trust each other
Shit is unreal - Treat him like my brother
He gon' snake me still..
That's because they lessons came from anger and obsession with being on some gangsta shit
Hangin' 'round them gangstas, but, you can never change some one
I pray so much nigga my mother asked me what I done
Thought I'd never tell her, all I ever knew was crime
I'm from the Favela, I rep this thing it's called the Mob
It'll last forever
Niggas here don't wanna die, so they do what I tell em'
People think I'm blind cuz' I'm high and I'm a felon

[Chorus]
Remember my name
30 on my lap, bitch you know I'm the mayne
Don't front on me now, everywhere I go you know I'm gon' hold you down
Remember the nig..
Burner and a mask bitch you know what this is
It's over my nig..
Ever cross the MOB I'll bring the chop to ya crib
