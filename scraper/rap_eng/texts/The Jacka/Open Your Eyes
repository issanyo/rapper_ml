Hit the hood, nigga with the chop driven
It's war outside, I survive under Allah's conditions
You can never be just like me boy, you sound ridiculous
645 drop, 40 Glock extended
Go pick up Lil' Chuck from school, he just got suspended
Beat a nigga down cuz he disrespected pimpin'
I'm from the slums, boy, places you can never visit
You say it's big, I say everything tall to a midget
You bit my style, now bow and beg for forgiveness
I'm at the edge, pass the sledge and clap the witness
Don't say what up, I just ask what is it
Where the fiends shank ya, burnin' dope
I'm scrapin' like burnt toast, makin' a blank pulse
On niggas who play me, close
