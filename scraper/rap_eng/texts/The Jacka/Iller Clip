[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
It's dope nigga
It's always gonna be dope mane
The dopegame nigga

[Verse 1 Jacka]
Don't fuck with The Jack, that's what I advise ya
I'll turn that size 8 fitted to a fucking visor
Never speak just grab her ass when I walk by her
They love that shit 'cuz i'm a trill ass nigga
Pullin' up with the [?] rims still spinnin'
With the hammer back too just in case I get in a
Situation be some places where niggas be trippin'
I just bounce up out the low and let 'em feel what a clip is

[Chorus x2]
If you push more than 1 drug then say [yeah]
If you got more than 1 plus then say [yeah]
Yo if you shot a nigga before don't say [yeah]
But if you got more than 1 whore then say [yeah]

[Verse 2]
Man i'm off the Remi don't tempt me my heart is empty
My Pops served 15 years felt like 60
Even though you had to ride that one out, you still with me
I don't love hoes i'm a thug, I didn't graduate
I'm glad to say i'm still breathin', after all we been through
Most niggas folks would be grievin', YO
You say you're in a gang and your real i'm the realer shit
You been shot before i hit you with a iller clip

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm so ill you won't believe it on Ripleys unless you got
The willpower to take 5 like 50
I will cower and coward that try denying my rep
I been earned your Wife respect she just gave me her check
I just did it 'cuz i'm a mack not because i need chips
I'm secretive I live in the 'jects but she think that i'm rich
Even in a suit and tie I still smell like 'kryp
She love a nigga 'cuz i'm thug man she think she my bitch

That nigga high!

You been shot before i hit you with an iller clip

[Chorus x2]
