[The Jacka]
What is our life comin' to my respected brothers and sisters?
You say you can't focus it's hopeless cuz' I've been missin'
But here I am so deep in the streets you thought I was livin'
I found myself braggin' on the cards I was given
But this ain't life I need Islam cuz' I'm just a nigga
Won't wanna leave this time, shit never leave the .9 niggas trippin
You used to bring the line, youâ€™s a fiend this time life different
Never leave my mind repeat the crime on beats like this one
Close your beak listen to a G over the rhythm
We must link, shit that make ya think is all that I give em'
Probably slap the grill out ya mouth cuz' I don't feel ya

[Chorus]
It's hopeless forreal am I the dopest forreal?
Or just a coke pusher huh hopin' I live? [x5]

[The Jacka]
I'm out here ever day stressin' and shit
Can't jump in the car without the weapon and shit
Waitin' on a problem cuz' I'm hard as a brick
You niggas say you trill, but about as real as it get
Out the window with the pistol 'bout to empty the clip
Reload, jump up out the low empty out again
We rarely live to be old men cuz there's so much against us
Gotta ride for my nigga, but we killin' each other
I think about it all the time, but I can't do nothin'
All happen, just tryna grind just tryna be someone
Just tryna get my family out the slums why I'm hustlin'
Gotta be a reason why my heart still pumpin'
I seen a man today I think he tried to tell me somethin'
I thought about Pac, and what he used to rhyme about
More than just a thug cuz' he really tried to find it out

[Chorus]
It's hopeless forreal am I the dopest forreal?
Or just a coke pusher huh hopin' I live? [x5]

[The Jacka]
I went to jail, they gave me a county year
Still was on some grimy shit, but studied Islam in there
Read a few books, tryna get through my time in there
Met a few crooks, swear the niggas can rhyme in here
Rapped about our cases tryna get out and shine again
The life of Muhammad, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam
Changed my state of mind, read the pages all night long
Different stages he went on on his journey through Jenner
That's so deep I hold back cuz you're just a beginner
I read Behold a Pale Horse, they got a plan for humanity
On the field with the torch barely cock it' insanity
Tryna deal with the voice that whispers in my heart
I took my Shahada and begged Allah it would stop
The more I embraced Islam the more I got sharp
I'm sick of wastin' time so was lifted from the dark
The Dean teachers killers sickness of the heart

[Chorus]
It's hopeless forreal am I the dopest forreal?
Or just a coke pusher huh hopin' I live? [x5]
