1-8-7 on officer, feel this clip cuz I ain't tryna talk to ya
36 zips of that crack ya know
Get locked, get out, or get bagged fasho
Take another go at that white again, never use the phone in our life again
For a drug deal, cuz that ain't fly, forget it ever existed cuz' you so high
Another move like that I'll take his life with the 9
The last dude like that cost my brother some time
Kept it solid, didn't rat so we still on with the line
These other niggas is the reason why the chrome was designed
Hot as Arizona on the block, though I hold a nine
You ain't seen no coke leave a nose as froze as mine
Rap niggas, fuck nigga, been a drug dealer
All my life and a thug nigga
