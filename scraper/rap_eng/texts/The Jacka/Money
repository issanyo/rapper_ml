[Intro]
Out first test will identify sounds coming from your
Right and left speakers
(Hold it, hold it, listen)

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
You could never be greater
They voting Jacka for mayor
They letting me do my thing but they be after me later
I'll lose my home and my cars, I'll have to stay with my cater
And ain't a lot that could save us
I once thought I was famous
Til' I got out, seen the world and realized I was nameless
But where I'm from I'm the nig, goddamn, I'm the nig
I smoke weed, but I'll never sink my teeth in the pig
I'll sink this heat in your wig
Got bitches, got bread, but still live with my kids
Yeah, man, it is what it is
Murdering, transport to keep food in they ribs
Man, I can't stand court, been on the run, just the Figz
Yeah, I been to jail before, but I don't know what real time is

[Hook: Husalah]
A lot of suckas wanna be like the M.O.B
But they never could be 'cause we fucking with a G
Oh, U-G-H, so mainey out the gate
Test me face to face, get popped and scraped
Nigga, ten-thousand, fifty-thou-wow, a hundred racks
To a half a million
Nigga, we're on one
We gettin' money

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
I'm in the hood everyday though, niggas is dying
I got respect every place cause I don't be lying
Knock a hoe in every state once they see how fly I am
Niggas talking hella shit, but I ain't replying
I catch yo' ass one day and take your life with the iron
And celebrate cross the state, square, one more time
Real nigga all my life, sucka, every breath I breathe
You say you a gangsta, but the streets don't agree
Really, Ridah and The Jacka is who you wanna be
Should I appologize sooner, nah, I can't save you holmes
We boys from the projects, nigga, not trailer homes
Crystal meth turnt' your ass to a traitor holmes
I remember every summer dipped in butter
Having all the things in life, Allah took that from us
Lil niggas on the block, soon, they will become us
All through the 90's, I don't remember these suckas
We was at them house parties dumping straps on bustas
You see that boy righ'chere, he really lived it
If you could take my life from me, I wouldn't miss it nigga

[Hook: Husalah]
A lot of suckas wanna be like the M.O.B
But they never could be 'cause we fucking with a G
Oh, U-G-H, so mainey out the gate
Test me face to face, get popped and scraped
Nigga, ten-thousand, fifty-thou-wow, a hundred racks
To a half a million
Nigga, we're on one
We gettin' money

[Verse 3: Husalah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
I dip a lot, whip a lot, the shots out my 40 stop
Fuckin' with it everyday, I'm everything these suckas not
Husalah, stupid rock, listen to my speakers knock
I became the nigga, bitches, I supplied the tweakers rock
Shit, dumbass, A1, I mollywhops flames out my chop
Same color as your mamas twat
Everything is dropped, dude stole on his drop
While I roll in my stone cold drop, going home or not
Oh my god, the Husalah's just amazing bro
They know we on the smoking shit
So tell me what they frontin' for?
And they know that we go for the kill
And it's on and it's real
Cause they won't and we will

[Hook: Husalah]
A lot of suckas wanna be like the M.O.B
But they never could be 'cause we fucking with a G
Oh, U-G-H, so mainey out the gate
Test me face to face, get popped and scraped
Nigga, ten-thousand, fifty-thou-wow, a hundred racks
To a half a million
Nigga, we're on one
We gettin' money

[Outro: Husalah]
You already know how we fuck with it
Biatch!
