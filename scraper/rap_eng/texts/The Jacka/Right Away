[Verse 1: Twisted Revren]


[Hook: The Jacka]
They need a real nigga right away
If I empty out my chop then you never got away
It's hard to face the J
Double drum on the AR how I make you pay
It's hard to face the Don
Cock the hammer back on the rifle I take for mine
You in love with the world, got the line on the girl, stick the nail then I make it mine

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Snub nose like Koala on my patnas' waist
Niggas swear they mobbin' but they sweeter than impala meat
Leanin' like a '64 Impala be
Fresh up out the system askin' niggas what they got for me
Thought niggas was bitches till mothafuckas died for me
Only in the streets cause Kazi took life for me
He a real nigga, kind of shit you can't repay
I did this for the mothers watchin' 5-0  take they loves away
Love to the Brum I knew this time'll come one day
Beg Allah's forgiveness when we landed on the runway
Nothin' here was handed, back-stabbers and the gunplay
Jack wanna see you on top, what is it gonna take
Trappin' 24 around the clock nigga (?)
Killers snort coke, do dope so they don't weep
We never seen you so weak
They need a real nigga right away

[Hook]
They need a real nigga right away
If I empty out my chop then you never got away
It's hard to face the J
Double drum on the AR how I make you pay
It's hard to face the Don
Cock the hammer back on the rifle I take for mine
You in love with the world, got the line on the girl, stick the nail then I make it mine
