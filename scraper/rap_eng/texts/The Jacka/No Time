[Hook:The Jacka] (x2)
No matter where I go, won't forget where I'm from
Get older everyday, I wonder where the time's gone
No time for my health but I hope I live long
No time for myself, no time to go home

[Verse 1: Freeway]
I'm having recollections of old drug connections
I met my connect's daughter on The Love Connection
And we both love collecting so we love connecting
Guess who's running the whole section now
It's the new boys, Freezer get the people work
But if he ain't using Freezer' work then he's a jerk
And if them niggas ever ever try to cross Freezer
Get their people hurt, Freezer make the nina squirt
And you know that saying pressure busts pipes?
Well we're applying pressure, Philly Freezer make the heater burst
Make ya'll fake niggas need a nurse (That's right!)
'Cause I throw big blows, unbelievable
These are not weaveable, couldn't even weave a few
Your bitch wear horse hair and she unbe-weaveable
And your song's unbelievable
And we're making real music over here, bruh!

[Hook] (x2)
No matter where I go, won't forget where I'm from
Get older everyday, I wonder where the time's gone
No time for my health but I hope I live long
No time for myself, no time to go home

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Gone so long can't go home
Please tell me where did we go wrong
Remember when you used to be so strong
Now you never go back where you're from
Remember when you had niggas behind you
Hoping that the industry find you
Looking for the Jack like it's been awhile
We been in the 'jects since a little child
Hustlin' in the hood with my nigs and everybody know
We got drugs, we them thugs, stay away, them boys'll body you
Jack and Free, we got cheese, still nigga we got a lot to do
Illest rap niggas alive, we never lied to you
Took this rap shit to new heights, we really try for you
Put your boys on with the white and then they hide from you
Meanwhile you lose your life and they cry for you
Died for the friends in your life but no one died for you

[Hook] (x2)
No matter where I go, won't forget where I'm from
Get older everyday, I wonder where the time's gone
No time for my health but I hope I live long
No time for myself, no time to go home

[Verse 3: Joe Blow]
Fresh off a 12 hour flight, I just got in from London
Amazed the value of a pound is almost double our money
So every verse lick I got I actually doubled up on it
And can't believe some niggas love me in a whole other country
I've been all throughout the map, I'm international baby
And what do dreams really mean 'cause I've been having them lately
Then I wake up to a night, man, happy to make it
Through the day and hope and pray that God can keep me from Satan
I know my mama worry 'bout me but I hope that she feel me
Gotta keep my hammer on me so these suckers don't kill me
Or shady cops that killed Oscar Grant, I'm glad that they filmed it
'Cause it's crazy that they never found Zimmerman guilty
So I'm fighting for my rights, plus my hammer is with me
Try to watch my drug habit 'cause what happened to Whitney
But I'm still sippin' syrup and there's wax in my Trippy
But I'm a real humble nigga if you happen to meet me

[Hook] (x2)
No matter where I go, won't forget where I'm from
Get older everyday, I wonder where the time's gone
No time for my health but I hope I live long
No time for myself, no time to go home
