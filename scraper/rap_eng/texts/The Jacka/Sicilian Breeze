[The Jacka]
I been missin' in action, on resorts just relaxin'
Lookin' in the water while the dolphins is passin'
Underneath, a long way from the streets
I slung yay with the beasts, I seen war turn to peace
Then right back into war
I never bought a gun out the store
But I bought one at school from a fool before
I got a 77 box sittin' on top 4s
Sittin' up real high, windows up real high
I got my .50 in my lap cuz' I don't trust no guy
I ain't into swine, but I'm into pushin' a line
All my young niggas see me, they stuck to the grind
Now matter how much I smoke, I keep seein' ghosts
Chop a zip then post, with spitters online
Most my niggas is blind, they don't see a nigga state to state tryna shine
They say Fat Tone didn't kill Mac Dre, and Puffness don't shine
Look nigga, I'm just a crook nigga
I ran up in D-Boy's house and took skrilla
Like fuck you niggas, I need a vacation
When it comes to the streets, you have no relation

[Hook]
Yee, I be MIA, yeah MIA
Very front seat Heat game like I'm finna play
Coppin' whips, buyin' shit nigga like I'm finna stay
I'm out a nigga house, niggas never been away [x2]

After Q, before Pac, now a 19 Glock
91, I seen killas with a curl on top
2-6 and Cuddy had the fiends on hop
Back then moms threw away her dreams for rock
We knockin' [?] Too Short bein' seen in drops
Dougie Fresh keep risin', keep risin' to the top
Young Niggas soon to murder realize I seen a lot
Make Salat in the night time, knowledge is power
I'm in NYC standin' by what used to be towers
I used to be in Martinez bull pen for hours
Interrogation from the boys was my quietest hour
I was right behind the gun blast, rainin' lead showers
I used to be young, hang around cowards
Acting like gangstas tryna figure out what my style was
That's too deep for you squares to comprehend
I'm on top of my game, on the run from the law again

[Hook]
Yee, I be MIA, yeah MIA
Very front seat Heat game like I'm finna play
Coppin' whips, buyin' shit nigga like I'm finna stay
I'm out a nigga house, niggas never been away [x2]

You talkin' hella shit, look at me in my eyes
It's coo cuz' when I return somebody gon' die
Somebody gon' ride along side ya, and open fire
I'm burnin' more trees than the Oakland Hills Fire
Mothafucka I'm ice cream cold, I spit dry ice
Made it snow in the summer, thank God for my supplier
Muder is for hire, make dealers retire
I hate dealin' with liars, nigga you ain't lie to be rich
High school drop out that didn't win the lottery
I'm a dope MC, the world expect a lot from me
So I'ma hold it down, when my niggas ain't around
I'ma stand my ground, like I'm the only one in town
I don't give a fuck, it's hard but I ain't givin' up
I can lose all I got, I'll still live it up
I still live in the slums, nigga dumb as fuck
I made a hundred thousand ones when I was young as fuck
We made the world love The Bay every place we went
We kept it lit, we really with the shit
I can teach you kicks, like Mr. Miyagi
Windows up, smokin' tryna contemplate a robbery

[Hook]
Yee, I be MIA, yeah MIA
Very front seat Heat game like I'm finna play
Coppin' whips, buyin' shit nigga like I'm finna stay
I'm out a nigga house, niggas never been away [x2]
