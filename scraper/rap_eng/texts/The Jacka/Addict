[Intro]

[Verse 1: Reese]
Early stages of addiction, my mind still attached
Still able to keep this paper with this monkey on by back
My friends don't really notice cause they all high too
Hit a lick for a brick, and its all mines too
Greedy like a motherfucka, nobody could stop me
Sweets for weeks and every single day we shopping
Cases of that rozay, pounds of that kush
Keep the circle small, its hard line we gon push
Ain't no man greater than the team that he's on
Some people fallin' off when their dreams is all gone
Folks washed up, their self-esteem is all gone
Told 'em, talk to Allah there can be no wrong
So it's one for the money, two to keep me blowed
Three to keep us free when there nowhere left to go
And [?] take effort, best effort's not enough
And the love you have to lose, it keeps slippin' through the clutch. (Mob!)


[Verse 2: Casey Stacks]
Have you ever had a feeling that something wasn't right?
Imagine living with that feeling everyday your life
And this shit is so strong its burning on the inside
I really want to right my wrongs but I can't quit getting high
And I can't quit ridin' round with that 30 on my side
Cause I'm still in the streets where some of my peers died
Then they say they hold me down, but I just wanna fly
Probably never make it to the top but I just wanna try


[Verse 3: The Jacka]
They locked my nigga Kaz, now he doin' life
He said that the time was the smallest price
Can't be with his kids is the suicide
But now he sees the plan they have for you and I
The pig get a hood and scan all day, they cruisin' by
They look us up and down, they plan a raid to move us out
Of our communities, gangs establishin' unity
I won't sell out to this system so they try to ruin me
They hope this shit just blow over so they won't lose to me
Everyday a new listener is asking, "Who is he?"
A nigga tempted by whispers to do some evil things
So I try establish prayer in a illegal game
Gimme the paper ma nigga cuz I don't need the fame
I call [?] with the creator, its what I need the game
Still I'm trynna make us rich so we won't need the game
I'm tired of breaking the promise that I won't leave again
I chop it up with old timers, they told me just to stay
I'm seeing zeros and commas same time I catch a drain
I'm seeing niggas had it harder so I can't complain
I'm seeing life as that a barber's who once was a king
In the streets where a strong man weeps
When he thinks of his mistakes
So on we can't sleep till the sun rise
In search of a fun time
Lost love, hope she thinks of me sometime
