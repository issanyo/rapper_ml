[The Jacka]
This a letter to my thugs that I'm sendin' out..

They call me, The J-A-C-K-A
Most money most hoes, why I live that way
I know it's drama on the streets, but I still stay
We seen a little light, but our sky still grey
Hustlin' in the rain, feelin' pain like a migraine
Head ache, bit by a two-head snake
With a corrupt jewel, my boy got washed on his first case
Hate to see the look on his mother's face, no time to waste
Hit the block with the 9 on waist, only the real will make the 9 erase
Life or put your nose to a plate and make the white line erase
Mind over matter, and you can even live through a massacre
Slavery or torture, we brought the straps to the club to make them niggas remorse ya
[?]
And All I heard was..
"All these niggas strapped as usual, and if you don't blast first then we all die too."

[Chorus]
I'll be a million miles away
When you get this letter
Too thug for the streets, can't shake the pain
A right to remember
You my nigga and I never would let you down
Niggas change but the world still go around
We from the slums, many nights we done been without
This a letter to my thugs that I'm sendin' out

[The Jacka]
I was suspended from space and time
Stripped from everything I love man, and placed behind
An iron gate
I just try to be cool and pretend like everything is straight
Tryna concentrate and write these raps, but that shit is whack though
Least they let my nig go
He ain't know what to do to keep the cash flow
So a nigga have something to come home to
Nigga what
Nigga fuck you
You a thug I'm a thug too
Put em up or get stuck with the ruck tooth
Get gutted, get your whole fit flooded nigga
No remorse I feel the same everyday, I love to kid but I don't play
They call me The J-A-C-K-A

[Chorus]
I'll be a million miles away
When you get this letter
Too thug for the streets, can't shake the pain
A right to remember
You my nigga and I never would let you down
Niggas change but the world still go around
We from the slums, many nights we done been without
This a letter to my thugs that I'm sendin' out

[The Jacka]
What you gon' do when you get out?
Hit the block cuz' I got much clout
Fire up a batch with the mob cuz' I'm out
Niggas talk shit get smacked real quickly
With the ass of the big body Desert E 50
Don't let Kazi or Feddy be with me
Say goodbye to the world, cuz tomorrow you'll be missing
It's The Jack! It's the Jack! Nigga it's The Jacka
One love the K-I-N-G, don't le em catch ya
It's the bitch ass detective that's really tryna sweat ya
Got our boy Bo locked, the whole mob scattered out catchin' cases
Changin' faces, gettin' flatted out
I guess the Mob Figaz just gotta sav it out
