[Intro]


[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Thugs by the riches I ain't tricking with no girl
Driftin' on the drugs find your love of the short girl
Enemy at our show take his soul its so real
Feel me how to kill a man but we already know how
Move hop my spot already a dope house
Murder Dan G we murdered your whole house
Never thought they try fuck me over but yo its cold out here
Very next day I was sober guess what I done to him
'91 Easter Hill he tried to jump me there
Oomph pulled out my cannon never got touched again
Free my nigga E.E. was with my nigga Fed
You ain't got to believe me they'll tell you what I did


[Verse 2: Ampichino]


[Hook: Ampichino]
Y'all was getting money, the same over here
I never moved cocaine, it just became my career
I started smoking weed and made the pain dissapear
Y'all was getting money, the same over here
I never moved cocaine, it just became my career
I started smoking weed and made the pain dissapear

[Verse 3: Joe Blow]
