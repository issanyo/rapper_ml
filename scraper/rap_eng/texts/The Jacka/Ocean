[Verse 1: The Jacka]
All started from a dream
And my sisters movin cream
And ain't nobody notice us nigga
From hand-to-handin' fiends
From movin whole things
And everybody know it my nigga
Im outta town thousand grams with a story my nigga
Got a 8 in a 4, finna pour it up with you
Hop on a plane with a whole one but too young to drink liquor
I'll probably end up the river where they slowly forget you
My nigga at the top got a lonely position
Alotta my niggas locked, I'll never forget 'em
It's alotta niggas shot who fail to remember
You a member in the Mob, you a hell of a nigga
You rather get a nigga time, we'll never forgive you
We talkin bout somebody down, we take care of it nigga
We probably pick apart the line and they ain't sharin it with us
Cause I done knocked a nigga down just for starin' at niggas
