[Intro: The Jacka]
Yea, yo, Jack
Dnyce sup boy
They know we mafia boy
I think they know what this is
Yea

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Niggas hold it down from Chi-Town to Baton Rouge
Any nigga come with that Mob sound could never lose
Off a quarter pound it all sounds incredible
I can hold it in but its better if I tell you bout
Flat black 7-1 everything electric yo
Just cause I traffic don't mean I expect you to
I'm in the streets where it's all about respect you know
Triple-stack Styrofoam damn its hard to let it go
Windows up medicating next to Highway Patrol
I don't give a fuck with the steel clutched I'm on the move
Yea that's the shit that you go through soon
Lean on my vocal tone, king I don't need the throne
Stacks so big ain't supposed to fold
Posters on the wall in every home they very known
Whoever thought this crime shit could carry on
Might seem scary from a place you gotta carry chrome
36 lights shine bright on these cherry clones
Headed down the 101 thinking bout the miles I drove
Could last forever when everybody's mouths are closed
But if you telling grab the gasoline douse your clothes
Toss a match watch you burn till all doubts removed

[Hook: The Jacka]
When we're gone it must be crazy
You must think about me baby
You must dream about me baby
The dope strands that I've seen lately
So dope won't go off of my mind
Just jumped 2 states damn am I high
Just dumped 2 K's (?) nigga driveway

[Verse 2: Berner]
No service on my cell boy I'm up in the hills
I brought paper with me shit I got the hundred forreals
I'm from the Yae (?)
Dark pink soda I don't need no purp
Yea these factory stones on my Roley are nice
I'm on the hype late night we don't lower the price
I'm running shit, I just ordered more lights
(?) we love the drought when it come around
We keep weight my name buzzing in another town
Baby say she want it raw, I'm loaded I just want the dome
You bought a choker-chain homie I just bought a home
We wash cash in cold water (?)
Race the police when we see the lights flashing
I hope I'm high when I pass
I'm out flexing in the UK
Suitcase full of new strains
Smoking good is just a way of life
You lost a whole box you better make it right
13 pocket full of Nade I had to take a flight
Look I'm on like I hit a whole plate of white
They must be crazy if they take (?)

[Hook]
When we're gone it must be crazy
You must think about me baby
You must dream about me baby
The dope strands that I've seen lately
So dope won't go off of my mind
Just jumped 2 states damn am I high
Just dumped 2 K's (?) a nigga driveway

[Verse 3: Dnyce]
