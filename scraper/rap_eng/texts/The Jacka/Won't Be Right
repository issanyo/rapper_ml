[The Jack:]
Knock your teeth down your throat
Sixty G's in my Raiders coat
All trap money
Split the sea in my speed boat
I live in the Bay, it's a place that never need dro
I can guarantee the best tree they ever seen befo
Really I'm the only muthafucka that you need to know
Bendin' corners, call the corner, they ain't getting nothin'
30's on my Cutlass, we the dumbest, we be sittin' up
From the block, have heart had guap, remember that
The law of da P allowed to speak unless you peeled a cap
Remember me, did it all for the M-O-B
Seein' shit you dream to see
It's the life, it won't be right 'til my niggas free
You know 'm sayin'
Would save the world, but I am just a man
And want to sleep on the truth but I overstand
You should know the ropes, I shouldn't have to hold your hand
Being broke is a life I'll never live again

[Chorus:] ~The Jack~
IT'S THE LIFE, IT WON'T BE RIGHT TILL MY NIGGA'S FREE
IT'S THE LIFE, IT WON'T BE RIGHT TILL MY NIGGA'S FREE
SMOKE TREE AND AIM MY MAC AT MY ENE-MIES
I JUST WANNA CLAP ALL MY ENE-MIES
NIGGAZ RAP BUT THEY COULDN'T SEE US IN THEIR DREAMS
NIGGAZ RAP BUT BOY WE ACTIVE WITH THE HEAT
GETTIN RICH MUTHAFUCKA, I NEVER SLEEP
WE YOUNG MUTHAFUCKAS AND WE RUN THE STREETS

[Cellski:]
Thang on my waist
50 in the safe
Another hundred racks just sittin' in the bank
My money stay long and yours don't grow
My bitches get money and yours don't ho
They call me Cellski, Big Mafi the Don
I done knocked more hoes than Magic Don Juan
Sittin in my Cadillac, blowing on bomb
Ridin' around Vegas with a suite at the Palms
Hopped out the whip, dank in hand
Ran up on the boy, had to clap that man
These streets ain't safe so I keep my thang
Had to clap at a nigga, he try to snatch my chain
Moved a lot of cocaine, made a lot of drug deals
This how a thug feels
Tryn'a see $1 mil
My gun stay on me at all times
I stay heated with the four five or the Glock nine

[Chorus:] ~The Jack~
IT'S THE LIFE, IT WON'T BE RIGHT TILL MY NIGGA'S FREE
IT'S THE LIFE, IT WON'T BE RIGHT TILL MY NIGGA'S FREE
SMOKE TREE AND AIM MY MAC AT MY ENE-MIES
I JUST WANNA CLAP ALL MY ENE-MIES
NIGGAZ RAP BUT THEY COULDN'T SEE US IN THEIR DREAMS
NIGGAZ RAP BUT BOY WE ACTIVE WITH THE HEAT
GETTIN RICH MUTHAFUCKA, I NEVER SLEEP
WE YOUNG MUTHAFUCKAS AND WE RUN THE STREETS

[The Jack:]
Sucka why you frontin', people never come through
Cause we kill niggas for nothin', they still muthafuckin' love us
Don't ask around, 'less you wanna drown in the delta
Let a hundred go, niggas scrounge around for shelta
Everywhere we go, least 30 in the hammer
Bitches love my gangsta, when before they couldn't stand us
See my posin' for the camera
Yeah the damn magazines
It's the life, it won't be right 'til my nigga's free!

[Cellski:]
I'm on the turf with the hammer on me
Like a cameraman, gotta keep a canon on me
K with the 'nana on me
Them alpha boys watchin, but we keep hustlin'
Niggas still funkin' so we keep bustin'
Ain't no love in these streets no mo'
I live the fast life nigga, why yo' life slow?
Gettin' money is the object
I made a hundred thousand dollars out them Frisco projects

(Chorus, The Jack)
IT'S THE LIFE, IT WON'T BE RIGHT TILL MY NIGGA'S FREE
IT'S THE LIFE, IT WON'T BE RIGHT TILL MY NIGGA'S FREE
SMOKE TREE AND AIM MY MAC AT MY ENE-MIES
I JUST WANNA CLAP ALL MY ENE-MIES
NIGGAZ RAP BUT THEY COULDN'T SEE US IN THEIR DREAMS
NIGGAZ RAP BUT BOY WE ACTIVE WITH THE HEAT
GETTIN RICH MUTHAFUCKA, I NEVER SLEEP
WE YOUNG MUTHAFUCKAS AND WE RUN THE STREETS
