[The Jacka]
20 bricks in my luggage, air tight 'bout to take flight
Before I was a teen I pushed rocks on the dope spot
Funk town, I love the town we was drug dealers yeah
Let a nigga get it, young nigga but I'm from the Rich
Out here cuz' that's all that's left, let em' know who I am
20 bricks in my luggage, out here tryna get it man
And I know  the game, I'm willing to play my part
You think it's a game, till' them fully autos spray ya car
You been to the Bay before, you know we ain't playin' boy
P World, Frisco, to V, EPA
Just another risk to take, tryna ice the wrist the chains
Sprinkle came through the hood, and I never tipped em' mayne
Smokin' on a zip of good, swervin' in and out of lane
Free my nigga Husulah-hus, he deserve a lot of fame
I was in the cuts because I was runnin' from the pain
Seal up 20 kicks, pack it up, and hop on a plane

[Chorus]
20 bricks in my luggage, air tight 'bout to take flight
Way before I was a teen, I pushed rocks on the dope spot
Funk town, I love the town we was drug dealers yo
Let a young nigga get it, young nigga but I'm from the Rich

[Laroo]
I serve niggas out the bag, cuz I'm still grimy
3 quarter lift coat, mack inside me
My connect got heart cuz he showed up, yeah I'm stingy with the line nigga so what
Out here tryna touch a mil, hotter than a super seal
Bitches know I don't explain, money, cars, houses mayne
I ain't feelin' no regrets, luggage get ya ass killed
Hunter game, cutthroat, nigga you a human shield
His meat is your poison, no mistake
But your fate, is to eat off his plate
I know it's a gamble, man, I'm ready to do my time
They investigate me for bricks and more crime
Shady when I was a teen, sellin' dope is all I seen
Poppin' niggas up close, squeeze guns with a scope
Now the package airtight, and I'm feelin' so right
20 bricks eyesight, boy'll make you see the light

[Chorus]
20 bricks in my luggage, air tight 'bout to take flight
Way before I was a teen, I pushed rocks on the dope spot
Funk town, I love the town we was drug dealers yo
Let a young nigga get it, young nigga but I'm from the Rich
