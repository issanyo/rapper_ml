[Verse 1: Freeway]
Crack in the pot, Glock on the waist, smokers in the peephole
Welcome to the east coast, this is where the heat go
This is where the youngins stay strapped, serve crack to the people
Had the spread break out, like the Measles hit The Bay
Got with Jacka cause he pray like I pray
Far as bangin' we are active tryna take over your atlas
We consistent with the rappin' serve slap to the people, hey

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
(?) is right behind me, tryin' to let us live today
Just cause i'm with Free don't mean we givin' shit away
Forced to be a gangster you should pray it never gets that way
Make Salat so much prostration burns on our face
So when Allah return the burn'll turn into a light
Got us through the dark while the Pagans lose they mind
So if you wanna survive we the guys you should get behind
Keep the ranks tight like the lines formed in Jumah

[Verse 3: Freeway]
I'm my mom's only, my dad's favorite, my close homies
Turned on me for no reason they such traitors, but that's fine
I learned from my mistakes these are the breaks they'll never catch me slippin' next time
I talk the nine because I read Quran I see the sign
Ima send it straight from the dunya how could I be divine
Don't get it twisted ima (?)
Unlimited bars extended clips when i'm in the booth

[Verse 4: The Jacka]
Allah I think about you everyday, pray you keep my family safe
The ain't have to be here, they shouldn't pay for my mistakes
Named my first daughter (?)
Caught up here cause I was a dreamer fell off my Deen
Certain Surahs I can't remember you took away
I need my knowledge back hope you never turn away
No matter how much I smoke the pain won't burn away
Drop the jewels in the booth so they'll learn the way

[Verse 5: Freeway]
Aren't you really chasin' these broads, fly sports cars
When I should be studyin' a hundred fourteen Surahs
But my family strugglin' I need my money to double
And my last album was only in fourteen stores
Now I put the heat before the chorus I got heat to spare
Better call smokey the bear if you wanna keep your forests
Squeeze and send niggas to the nurse you bout to meet the lords
We gone take y'all deeper to Allah send a reaper force
