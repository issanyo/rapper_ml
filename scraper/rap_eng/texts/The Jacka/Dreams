[The Jacka]
The sun gone, full moon, got a show and I'm on my way
Should be havin' fun, but the ghosts they won't go away
It's the only thing that's real, so I'm focusing on the pain
And again, in the end, everybody I know just sane
She used to be my sweetheart, till' she ended up on the blade
My best friend got shot, and he died from his injuries
I only get blank thoughts when they mention our history
And when my time is up, I wonder will they remember me
I was finna make a drop, but the knock was fidgety
I observed from down the block when the gunshots entered him
I remember wakin' up wonderin' if it's a dream, Till I seen my nigs in cuffs cuz Babylon just did it's thing
When my pops was still down he said the time was killin' him
But when he got out, he got downed by his enemies
How am I in the cold world with this positive energy, [?]
Vampire in the streets, my empire will fall one day
They took Freak and Pum and somebody took Tall away
I only picked this lifestyle to put a smile on my Mother's face
Tell my brother stay in school, but for me the shit was a waste
Smoke weed to ease the pain, till my memory was erased
Shit ain't for everybody this a struggle you'll never face
You pack steal, but won't kill lil nigga stay in your place
I live a ill life that the fake niggas imitate
Any problem that I had, my niggas eliminate
Thought I would tell you that, so you won't make the same mistakes
God damn I did a lot, but in the end I won't get no thanks
I owe it all to Allah, hope the fire is not my fate
We get it all from I & I, we suspended from time and space
In the fast lane, but the cash thang all I'm tryna chase
They say out with the old, I'm wonderin' who did I replace
Help me out, I wanna stop but now I see that I can't
Ladder on my Glock, we in a place where nobody safe
And only time I see peace is when I'm in my (Dream...)
