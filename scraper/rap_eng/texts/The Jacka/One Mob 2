[Verse 1: The Jacka]
They murdered Will, he was ill, he never killed nobody
But for my cousin was the first time I killed somebody
But wouldn't be the last time I melt somebody
This shit so real I could end up with a L probably
Kaz doin' life for us, he ain't never tell nobody
'Member summertime '02 callin' coke Pink Karate
Ten years prior '92 first time I seen a Thomas
Age 13 was a dream, I don't live with momma
D-spot 'fore they called it trap, everybody grimy
Jack & FedX we was next in the party shinin'
Influenced by the music now all my lil niggas climbin'
Murdered the connect and pushed dope on every nigga grindin'
Shots firin' on the Kingpins, eating cause they fat Islamic
I'm with the Lash King I better never see a diamond
Jesus & Regime it's the perfect timin'
KI & JA (?)

One Mob Rest in Peace Jack & Syrup Kid
Lash money came a long way now we the niggs
I fuck with Joe Blow & Philthy Rich we locked in
When i'm at they shows, G-Lock stock with a ten
Rest in Peace Rob Ben still FT

We creep through and your ass get touched up
Double back thirty minutes later, yellow taped up
I fuck with real niggas that's gonna go for me

We strapped daily, we ready for war bitch
Catch a nigga lackin' and we add him to the score list
We push packs on a (?) we bout that
