[Hook: The Jacka]

[Verse 1: MDot80]

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Comin' through incredible, for the hood I'm connected to
My niggas say they need to make a play then I connect a few
But if you love your life don't be short when I collect from you
You was down on life, you my guy so I lifted you
But fuck the bread respect the only thing that I expect from you
You my nigg from way back don't get whacked over principal
(?), then the FBI hit the door
You a snitch now, damn where the fuck did my nigga go
You act like you ain't live when we get pinched we just forget our home
Till we beat the case or leave the state but we never told
And I'm thinkin' bout your fate everyday while I'm breathin' snow
When I catch you ima wet you with the K until you breathe no more

[Hook]
