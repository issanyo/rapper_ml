[Verse 1: The Jacka]
You can tell me you never robbed nobody
Tell me you never caught a body
Tell me you never been to jail
Tell me you never lost somebody
Tell me you never been through hell
Cause I wanna know how that feel
Mob niggas don't know that world
Sellin' 'Ron for a old Camaro
No sleep till the dawn cause I snort girl
Ask around they know the kid
Hunnid rounds on the driver legs
'member 99 hit by the feds
My nigga Boom he still in there
My uncle Gugga he still in there
My lil' brother he still in there
My nigga Ice he came home this year
I picked this life you'll never know me now
They took Pum life I gotta gun you down
Year 2000 Fed on the run
Don't take advice unless its from (?)
We did not make our music for every man
The people don't deserve it but we still give in
How is the world not perfect and we still (?)
I say (?) to break away from the djinn
I fall asleep in the trap and pray I wake up again
You fall asleep doin' life and pray you don't wake again
We in the streets going hard, who got it harder than them
Make salah to Allah never pray to a man
Just try save our soul cause he (?) in our prayers
They got you praying to the sky that's why nobody hears
They cover up lies that's why nobody cares
Then they try keep you down soon as somebody sees
