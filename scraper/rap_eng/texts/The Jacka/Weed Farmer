Call me the ganja farmer

Military helicopters flow through the air
Babylon comin' (?)

[Verse 1]
There'll be war between us
Islam - we heavy readers
Faith so heavy, they can't read, but still believers
Crackers credit everything; We the real genius
Get it out there to be sharp, then they string us
Hide the facts in these raps but these thoughts are the meaning
Ain't it fly that words bring art, like a painting
Keep us all slaves to our thoughts, but they failin'
Yeah, the ancient Egypts chartered Mars, while y'all was sailin'
They came back, the ship crashed in the mountains, they start fading
They were lost in the Caucasoid mountains, their skins changing
We traveled with the scalpel, we found 'em, we called 'em lepers
We brought 'em in, cleaned 'em up, they smelled like German shepherds
Even to this day, they get wet, they smell like Pinschers
Brought 'em back and they payed my weed plants special attention
I woke up, they snuck away in the night with our inventions

[Hook]
