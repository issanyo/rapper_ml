[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I asked her how could you care about a nigga like me
A million bitches how'd you think I'd ever make you happy
A thousand bitches are in love but sure they'd never have me
A million niggas said they thugs but never said it their way
I only said it like that got a strap everyday
I'll really walk your ass out and gotta watch what you say
I'll really knock your ass out, Kaz walking down life
Lil D, real G, he been gone a long time
I only freestyle like I don't know how to read or write
Watch my pink condition but the chicken don't leave my mind
Leave my bitch behind but I'm never gon' leave the grind
Gunning with my nigg, hunnid drum underneath the pint

[Hook: The Jacka]
See the sun rise they realized they need us now
Probably wanna score but our song amaze the crowd
In and outta jail I just want to make you proud
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down

[Verse 2: Ampichino]


[Hook]
See the sun rise they realized they need us now
Probably wanna score but our song amaze the crowd
In and outta jail I just want to make you proud
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down

[Verse 3: Cartiyay]


[Hook]
See the sun rise they realized they need us now
Probably wanna score but our song amaze the crowd
In and outta jail I just want to make you proud
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down
Illest in the world so they wanna try keep us down
