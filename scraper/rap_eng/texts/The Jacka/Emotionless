[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Here come The Jack with another rap song
My enemies smacked, they was never that strong
I ain't have to scrap since straps was involved
Young bulls in the trap and we packaging raw
You don't want a nigga clapped, what you bring Jack for
Kingpins in the trap but we gotta act poor
Member six in the morning, police at my door
Fresh J's screech cause the bathroom floor
Out the back window I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance grab the sauce that I made
All this coke wasn't worth all the numbers that I paid
We was broke at first but now I'm on a wave
I'll murder anytime for the life that I save
Lil' Bubb never killed, got life anyways
The (?) take you out, we gettin' high anyway
Won't fuck with you niggas cause you lie everyday
We'll never see the light 'less we firin' the K
Knock the fake niggas off cause they are in our way
Even though I'm about to be a star any day
MDot & Jack sip Bo any place
Car full of smoke, (?) on my waist
If you think you ill, put the bar in yo face
(?)
