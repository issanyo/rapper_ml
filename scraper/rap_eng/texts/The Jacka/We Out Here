[The Jacka]
This rap shit, it's hard for me to let it go
This the type of shit you'll never hear on the radio
Ain't gotta cuff your bitch cuz she only love the stereo
California let's make a deal, I'll carry you
Loved you all my life, but the game is what I'm married to
People hear my rhymes to put me high on a pedestal
But it don't phase me like Jay-Z I'm already home
You just a maricon who wan't everybody gone
Leave your soul here, but your body gone
Road your on leads to no where, but I am on
The Mustaqim, who is king
Don't nobody care, unless you countin' cheese
Where's the air, can't nobody see
But they still believe, that's whats in they lungs every time they breathe
Rich nigga now but where were you in my time of need
Never see the day, never leave till' it's time to feed
You'll wake up when the sun hits your face, it's too late for me

[Chorus]
I'm a nightmare, breathin' in the night air
Stay up out my way, cuz I am what you might fear
I am from The Yay, found a way in my Nike Airs
Finna make a play, movin' Yay, mayne we out here

[The Jacka]
I chased out plenty of niggas
So late spaced out like an empty arena
Kick your spouse out my house when she empty my penis
She can't pass a test, but she is a genius
I'm passed fresh, upset with political leaders
Don't stress, we'll be right there when you need us
Is what they tell us, but right to the joint where they lead us
I made a point, never accept what they feed us
They're full of shit, and I don't expect you to save us
Cuz you black, we in America right where they slaved us
I gotta ride for my neighbors, die for the gangstas
Who held me down when I was lost
Nothing I can pay you can amount to what you taught
Ladies love my thoughts, they say I'm on some bad shit
They like niggas with money, but respect is more attractive
Yo, I got both but first we was assassins
