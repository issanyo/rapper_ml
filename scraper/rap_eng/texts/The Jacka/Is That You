You niggas hate me, you'll never get far
Like a shooting star, in my SLR
To the top, what I'm headin' for
My shit'll never lock, swear to God that the lead will soar
Through the wind in your door, that's just the first shot
Here come 99 more,  gangsta is what you not
C'mon, why you lyin' boy tellin' niggas what you got
That's not who you really are, you wanna be me
A monday in my rental car loadin' my piece
I can't get loaded off tree no more, I need bo to make it stronger
Can't wait no longer, I'm like a vampire, I can't shake the hunger The one who niggas hire, to take they life from em'
We won't live forever mayne, everybody comin'
Thinkin' 'bout what never came, the game never loved him
Played the hand we was dealt, only God can judge him
Hella paper I done felt, never left the struggle
End up out here by my self
