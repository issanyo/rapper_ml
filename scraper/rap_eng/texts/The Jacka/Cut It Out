[Verse 1: The Jacka]
My uncle Gugga got locked, we grown, he still gone
I'm still in shock my cousin's pop, he on his own
We gettin' high out the zone, one day we'll be on
30 stickin' outta my clothes, don't let no weakness show
Only time I cry is when I laugh, errybody poor
But I still give away my last till we all got dough
Move fast till we all had coke
Let him tax us with the pack cuz then we tied dude up
My lil' cousin (?)'ll line you up
Nice tie, button up, put you in your last tux
Try and be the nice guy all the chicken you passed up
From when the times was hard unless you murder don't get no pass chumps
(?)
Rest in peace Pum, (?) showed me fly pics
Lookin' real for Kazi & (?)
(?), you better know yourself

[Hook: The Jacka]
Look at me now, now way out
You ain't neva been this ill, nigga cut it out
Look at us now
You ain't neva been this real, nigga cut it out
Look at me now
You ain't neva been this ill, nigga cut it out
Look at us now
You ain't neva been this real, nigga cut it out
