[Hook: MDot80]
You fuck niggas hatin'
But we don't hear 'em talkin'
Block (?) block burners, yea we get them Glocks off
Fuck niggas hatin', fuck niggas hatin', fuck niggas hatin'
But we don't hear 'em talkin'

[Verse 2: ]
Man the lifestyle I live motherfucker so street
I'm like Eazy fuckin' E, nigga fuck the police
Cause they trynna lock me up, cause my ass push D
Niggas know I sell dope, all this jewelry on me
Man I know these niggas mad cause I'm gettin' lotta cheese
Ask me will I ever love a chick, dawg not me
Only thing that make my dick hard is gettin dope cheese
Haters mad at my ass cause I do it with a ease
(?)
.40 Cal and them bands got the ice on me
Reason why my trap bumpin' cause my price so cheap
(?)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Just eleven years old first time me and (?) trapped
Then he tried to rob us, next day I bought a strap
Knocked the nigga down we on point like party hats
And my niggas crowned rollin' joints like Marley's spliff
I get your wife's number for the sport and never call the bitch
I go on the run like fuck court until I'm finally pinched
I tell my young bulls hustle hard they only signing wimps
Come to my hood and get on I got all kinds of shit
It's like I'm outter space, out on age I make timeless shit
My best friends on the front page we into crime n shit
God damn I'm in the life I gotta hide my chips
Purposely I rather drive cause of how high I get
AJ, Kaz, and Quran the reason why I'm here
They got everything a kid can dream, no Christmas time is near
So we hit the hood and give gifts, to the smoker's kids
Come fuck with The Jack, you'll see what hopeless is
Close your eyes and zone out, I only want your ears
Nutty B got a degree while he was on the tear
Lil Bubb got on a dean, he a shake in there
We out here chasin' a dream, nothin' but gangstas near
