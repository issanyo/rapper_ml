[Hook: The Jacka]
Hunnid in my chop and it's on my lap
How these niggas Mob, they ain't do like that
You don't move like that, you don't do like Jack
Hunnid in my chop and it's on my lap
Raised up in that Mob, now it's on my back
Even though we hard, bitches love the Jack
30's on my car, 30 in my Mac
You don't know who we are, this is what they slap

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
This is one for them ill bitches who fall in love with real niggas
We fuck bitches, we kill niggas, they don't give a fuck they still with us
Where's your whole thang, we the dope gang mami
You know I ride around with a drum in the tummy
Right now I'm the nigg but you always fucked with me
Our sound so big that the world wanna know me
AR All-Stars but we never need a trophy
European cars and the inside smoky
All my niggas strapped and their clips are poking
And they never laugh even though you niggas joking
Two S's on my Chev and the cam straight (?)
30 in my FN and I got this shit from Oakland
Every place that I land niggas pullin' up smoking
Straight Mob the whole town but the girl still open
Bring 'em in our world now we got the pearl soaking
And we're only in the trap where there's niggas sellin' cocaine
I never said a word and I never heard a complain
20 AK's never take'm to the gun range
To (?) man you gotta start young
Knock down ten niggas if you're beefin' with one
Make it hard on these niggas every time that you come
Hunnid in my clip but I'm leavin' with none

[Hook]
Hunnid in my chop and it's on my lap
How these niggas Mob, they ain't do like that
You don't move like that, you don't do like Jack
Hunnid in my chop and it's on my lap
Raised up in that Mob, now it's on my back
Even though we hard, bitches love the Jack
30's on my car, 30 in my Mac
You don't know who we are, this is what they slap

[Verse 2]
They say ain't no room
My AK gon' make the room
Then the JA gonna take the throne
Gun you down in the night when the laser off
Man this Mob ass shit is the number one song
Fast shout any real nigga never got on
Home-girl not a dyke but she got a strap on
Just in case she gotta clap any nigga act wrong
So many bitches on my dick that I gotta act gone
Bouta free my nigga Ice he don't got that long
But we still pay the price cause there's niggas doin' life
Know they free one day though we wish it was tonight
My nigga Dre got shot then he went into the light
Didn't pull through then but we wish he was alright
That was the only time I made a wish in my life
Nigga I ain't never been a bitch in my life

[Hook]
Hunnid in my chop and it's on my lap
How these niggas Mob, they ain't do like that
You don't move like that, you don't do like Jack
Hunnid in my chop and it's on my lap
Raised up in that Mob, now it's on my back
Even though we hard, bitches love the Jack
30's on my car, 30 in my Mac
You don't know who we are, this is what they slap
