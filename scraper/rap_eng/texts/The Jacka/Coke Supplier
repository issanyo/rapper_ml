[Verse 1: The Jacka]
My eyes are windowed you can see straight into my soul
When I'm gettin' high you can see the smoke in my skull
Bringin' caine back, 20 fiends livin' in the trap
Everyday we at, wake up at, but that's not my home
Quarter in a cone cause I squeeze the trigger on "cabrones"
Pure in a brick cause my 'nect come from Michoacan
30 in the plastic so you better have your ratchet on
Really in the Mob 'fore you cop niggas pat you down
Really movin' soft, knock you off if you ask around
J-1 back around after 17 years
Whole time he was down said they never seen him tear
Brought him J's but the Brons said he never seen a pair
Took a loss yea after thousand pounds went in the air
You took a loss, wasn't my fault but I still treated you fair
Niggas in the life of crime it's the shit they trynna hear
Told me that the hood was down now I'm gettin' rich again
