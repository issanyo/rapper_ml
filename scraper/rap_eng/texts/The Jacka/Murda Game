[Intro: The Jacka]
Yeah
I know you know what this is
Mob
Boss, Gap
Nigga Gap boy
The JA
Is what they call me yo

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
My nigg died, tears in my eyes first time I caught a body
You ain't never felt like that cause you ain't lost nobody
Never rat, real Mob shit, here go a toast to Gotti
Murder game slept in the trap before we drove Ferraris
Had to murder men slept with my strap before I bought (?)
21st birthday came they bought the Aston for me
Any sucka stepped in my lane, my niggas offed him for me
Mothafuckas hustlin' cane you know that's all our story

[Hook: The Jacka]
Steppin' up my murda game
Because I wanna live again
A different body everyday
The things that got us where we are
Loading up this hunnid thang
Drivin' with it in my car
Thinkin' I should go away
But I can never go too far

[Verse 2: Young Bossi]
(?)

[Hook]
Steppin' up my murda game
Because I wanna live again
A different body everyday
The things that got us where we are
Loading up this hunnid thang
Drivin' with it in my car
Thinkin' I should go away
But I can never go too far

[Verse 3: Gap]
Pray to God for forgiveness cause I know I'm a killer
Man my conscious is cold man I ain't got no feelings
Cop wanna lock me up cause I'm big drug dealin'
Can't help the way I'm livin' pushin' dope since children
I was raised in the hood man that's why I'm a villain
Shout out to the niggas locked up appealin'
Real niggas do they time and they never be squealin'
Trynna dodge all these raps man I'm reachin' for millions
Fuck yeah I want bands man that's why I'm still flippin'
.40 cal with a 30 cause these niggas be trippin'
But I don't give a shit cause I'm one of the illest
45, ten inch racket and this bitch be spittin'
Don't let rap fool you give yo ass the business
Man my mamma been told me that my ass was ignorant
Fuck school I was broke man that's why I'm flippin'
Now I'm a nigga with a plan with a clear ass vision

[Hook]
Steppin' up my murda game
Because I wanna live again
A different body everyday
The things that got us where we are
Loading up this hunnid thang
Drivin' with it in my car
Thinkin' I should go away
But I can never go too far
