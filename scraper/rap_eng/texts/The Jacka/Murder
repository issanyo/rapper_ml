[Intro: The Jacka]
Mob, damn
I know they know oh
It's that Mob shit nigga
You digg
We live this shit, man

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Bubb doin' time for a murderer
Kaz doin' time for a murderer
If you've ever heard a crime n you heard of us
We was gettin' rich 'fore they heard of us
Yeah, they gettin' bread but they not where we at
They gave my patna (?) so the nigga set
He don't want no high-fives cause he didn't rat
He just did what he supposed to do
You just mind yo business even though its killers close to you
Drum in the machine ridin' down International
Keep your niggas close to you, choppa on the passenger
We don't need a scope for you
Strapped with my niggs till our cribs got ocean view
Bring rap back cause it feel like ghost to you
Feel like forever cause ain't a nigga show us through
Started losin' hope, sellin' coke with my open crew
Realest niggas alive say we dope cause they know it's true
Never take me light I'll take your life, you dont know me bull
Sellin' dope, blowin' trees, we ain't go to school
Illest ever seen, young teens we went on a tour
Nose full of 'Ron no sleep till they dyin' forsure
Durban Cook, Durban Sherb I'm a connoisseur
Flyer than a California Condor
I dont wanna have to show up to your mom door
Lookin' for you with a Mac wearin' Tom Ford
Millionaire on the slap ain't got time slow up
Or watch you grow up, here the lean go nigga pour up
You sucked every dick you seen bitch you should hoe up
Did everything but I'm here to see my niggas  blow up
