[Verse 1: Lil Rue]
In a whip full of weed smoke
Watchin' your girl choke
She love to deep throat
I love watchin' my trees grow
New crop every 90 days
Get money all kind of ways
Gotta sell him pussy cause she know her vagina pay
Watchin' my plants flower
OG, Cook, & Sour
Your man is a real coward
Tell him I've been bout it
He don't want no problems
I'm pimpin' got hoe problems
And still get the packs to you with no problems
My niggas been mobbin'
You niggas been soft
Trap house still boppin'
Crack, hop, & soft
I fuck with the Seal Boyz
We poppin' them seals off
You better come correct when you talk to a real boss

[Hook: The Jacka]
(Mob)
It's hard to face the king
It's hard to face the Don, murder then we take the line
You know what, it's hard to face the king
Gunshots wake you out your dreams, where we hang at
You know what, it's hard to face the king
Hard to face the Don, murder then we take the line
You know what, it's hard to face the king

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
Nigga try to play me, same day we, shot up his car
Now I'm feelin' crazy, ask Allah, have we gone too far
Just got out the (?), I'll be gone some more
Niggas rat the team, they act the king, so we goin' to war
Moms had the youth as a teen, didn't know we was gonna be poor
I'm gettin' rich it seems but rather have our lives for(?)
Kill but rather scuffle if you got knuckles like that bull Bernard
Think them bulls can fuck with J, then they must be smokin' hard
Came (?) started sendin' niggas to the Lord
Forgive me Allah another problem that I can't afford
Cup full of drank, full drum just in case we storm
On MTV & BET but this the shit they thank me for

[Hook]
