[Intro]
I'm gone, again, the ink in my skin, say MOB
You know what that mean
I can't have just one broad, I move mean, I'm the king
I'm not God but you won't, see me, again

[Verse 1]
Stack a mil', I don't need a cheap thrill
So ill, never sign a wack deal
Women give me scrill feelin' how the Mac feel
I ain't gotta give it back you ain't pullin' on my grill
Everybody on my hill tryna push through wit' me
But they need to just chill, keep playin' how I run it
And the truth from the field, we the best who ever done it
Give thanks 'cause the gangster shit is all I ever come wit'
Say

[Chorus]
Please Jack don't you go nowhere
Please Jack you're all we have
Come back what a time we'll have
Please Jack lead the way
But I never went nowhere
We can keep it real while still right here
Think you need me, why the fuck should I care?
Bitch I'm, I'm the way

[Verse 2]
Jumped on a plane and I met a dope lady
Told her she was cute, matter fact you amazing
Said she went to school and she'll soon be graduated
I said you look too young to be in first class baby
I didn't know what to tell her I'd been pushin' coke lately
So I told her I was rappin' on the Mob shit pay me
Already rich fuck a job I'm winnin'
Every time I leave a chick she always come back saying

[Chorus]
Please Jack don't you go nowhere
Please Jack you're all we have
Come back what a time we'll have
Please Jack lead the way
But I never went nowhere
We can keep it real while still right here
Think you need me, why the fuck should I care?
Bitch I'm, I'm the way

[Verse 3]
The first time that I met your wife
She said where were you when I met this guy
We laughed so hard tears fell from our eyes
Shoulda gave her the rod but I passed on the thighs
Made her realize I ain't one of them guys
I can open her legs rather open her mind
Got clout, leavin' mothafuckas doubt
Told the bitch go to Chase and she emptied her account
Came back with the safe so I let her see my house
But I still didn't fuck, let her put it in her mouth
Tried to bust in her face but it went up on her scalp
She said I love you JA and I'll never rinse it out
For my niggas in the cage who ain't never gettin' out
Man we still gettin' paid pimpin' hoes in the drought
Niggas still ain't on our page so they showin' hella doubt
When we standin' on the stage all we hear is women shout, aye

[Chorus]
Please Jack don't you go nowhere
Please Jack you're all we have
Come back what a time we'll have
Please Jack lead the way
But I never went nowhere
We can keep it real while still right here
Think you need me, why the fuck should I care?
Bitch I'm, I'm the way
