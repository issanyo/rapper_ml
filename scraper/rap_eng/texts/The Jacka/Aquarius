[Verse 1: The Jack]
Aquarius, the Zodiac sign for water carrier
The naked eye could expose your exterior
Why, why interior
Remains a mystery convincin' me to harry carry
And bury this subject, yes
Aquarius, is also a instrument
Aboard the Argentine SAC-D spacecraft
Another thing they bring for climate control
You should stay silent you know, they listenin yo
Aquarius, underwater habitat
Stare at this, is this what you're starin' at
Commit theft Jacks, kill nigga
So nobody got your back, on the real nigga
I want the world nigga, but is it just a dream
See the bigger picture, I travel around the globe
Different thoughts I pick up, hopin' that I grow
Learn from the fiction, that all you niggas live in
Damn I wanna teach em, but I rather get high today
Hope one day I reach em, for now they do what whitey say
But I'll never leave 'em, man y'all need me right away
I make millions so I don't wanna die today
Used to be bright then the whites took the light away
