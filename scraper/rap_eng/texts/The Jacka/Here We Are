[Chorus]
Come through, hammer on me..
We.. We all got money
Damn they asked for me now
Here we are, here we are

[Joe Blow]
Comin' up in this game better know it's a struggle
Hardly ever see my daughter but she know that I love her
Down to my last ounce still pour with my brother
Fuck with Jack, everybody that you know'll get smothered
Just touched from a state and send my ho to another
When your rubberbands stacked, they don't notice your color
Miss my big cousin Harvey been gone a few summers
So I don't never use the phone, I stay with a new number
And I'm coppin' everything if you got a cool number
Ain't a flashy type of nigga everything I do under
Finna hit the road with my brand new bunny
Still spendin' old, ain't touched this new money
What could you do for me? I'm an entrepreneur
Been gettin' dough since 4 finger rings and rockin' Velours
Think killin' Osama will put a stop to the war?
It only made more problems, retaliations in store (I bet)

[Chorus]
Come through, hammer on me..
We.. We all got money
Damn they asked for me now
Here we are, here we are

[Young Lox]
Aye this for my niggas who ain't make it
I lost my heart young and I never did replace it
Yo I just wash the pain away with drugs
See my foe wash his brain away with guns
I'm in the Dunya tryna make it out the slums
Became the future because you'll never see me where I'm from
Home of the losers
Who came up from the front line with the shooters
So we take what we want
Gettin' high I'm a user, 28s on the donk
Rather die and shoot ya, than take a loss
Cuz all you niggas losers so you pay the cost
Tryna shine like a jeweler Mueller on my arm
Yeah, you wouldn't know 'bout that glam-life
It costs dough you niggas better get the cash right
I'll get loc'd if you ain't count the duffle bag twice
I'm pure dope like a solid in a glass pipe nigga

[Chorus]
Come through, hammer on me..
We.. We all got money
Damn they asked for me now
Here we are, here we are

[The Jacka]
Rep that MOB, I'm just like that
We out here, I don't think they like that
P-World, we them fly cats
A mean world in them projects
That's where niggas lose they life at
That's ill nigga how you write that?
I'm real so it came out easy
No one believe you but everybody believe me
I pull out product they pay me
I'm full of Prada and Bale's
I pull a chop out and down him
Or maybe I use the brownie
That's over your head unless you are one of us and you killed
Sandwiches on our belt, that mean cannons is on our hip
I been gangsta before colors, boyz N' da hood and menace
Takin' up for my brothers, into the coke business
Wake you up with my thumper, then clean up every witness
Told us never kill so I beg for forgiveness
You don't overstand tryna picture how I'm livin'
Do the best you can, probably still end up in prison
Never went to school all my niggas out here pitchin'
Got a mothafuckin' tool, jump straight into the deep end
