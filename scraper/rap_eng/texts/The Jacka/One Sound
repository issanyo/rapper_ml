[Intro: The Jacka]
I know they know
I know they know

[Hook X2: The Jacka]
This that one sound
We stay in the hood, we don't come around
I just wanna make you proud
But you'd rather see me gunned down

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Ay
Lash in another town
Tryna' catch a pass for a hundred pound
I sleep with a hundred round
We'll carry cake all the way 'til the sun is down
Cause niggas gettin' rich and they ain't show us how
They get stripped when all they had to do was hold it down
Niggas talkin' to you bitches turn bosses down
But we ain't chillin', he a nigga that'll walk us out
Where killing made it safe for y'all to walk around
Take the drank man he ain't keepin' costs down
We tryna' make bands, never take a loss from them
Came from the D-spot, sellin' rocks till 5 am

[Hook X2: The Jacka]
This that one sound
We stay in the hood, we don't come around
I just wanna make you proud
But you'd rather see me gunned down

[Verse 2: Berner]
I used to get 4,800 for the dark Purp
Hit it with a light one, why we all die young
Who you think they buy it from? Me
I'm fresh, new stones
Let me light more trees, send me 5 more P's
When they touch, I'mma count cash
I'm tryna' get a little money out her round ass
Yeah, they love me like Chapo
Lil D.B.'s layin' pablo
Me, Jack, and Blow sippin' lean out the bottle
Akron Ohio, I'm sittin' in the Range
With a pocket full of a hundred dollar bills, feelin' strange
They love me in my city, I wanna make 'em proud
But a few fuck boys rather see me gunned down
Mob

[Hook X2: The Jacka]
This that one sound
We stay in the hood, we don't come around
I just wanna make you proud
But you'd rather see me gunned down

[Verse 3: Rydah J. Klyde]
Yeah, this that one sound
(?) just like Tony just to numb me down
Cause niggas wanna gun you down
But you better find (?)
Look he got 'em duckin' now (?)
Dip low (?) he used the hunnid but he the hunted now
Moved to another town, pray on it buddy pray on it
This how you know that they want it
Nigga this the sound it got you down from the start
Told you this is so (?) I don't think you wanna be a part
Have money, have heart And don't go playin' with this shit
Pull it out and let that motherfucker bop
Believe me though

[Hook X2: The Jacka]
This that one sound
We stay in the hood, we don't come around
I just wanna make you proud
But you'd rather see me gunned down
