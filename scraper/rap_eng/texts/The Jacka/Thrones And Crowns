[The Jacka]
Ronnie Ron and Kazi Kaz the loves of my life
Part of the reason young Uni Mac breathe on the mic
Kaz was born on Halloween I said damn you look like
Your big sister, When I'm gone I miss you - please do recite
The Apache, high daily cause we know what it's like
To be lost and confused I wandered straight from the light
Watch your health don't get caught up in your wealth cause it's like
That's not why we here, all the signs is clear
Words of divine tell my princess and my empress
Tell em' to be fine and never to be tempted
By the turmoils of life your father had to live it
A moment in my time you wouldn't wanna visit
Some people never see the light Islam just miss em'
My father gone all the time we thirsty for his wisdom
Caught up in this rap, sometimes that's all I have to give em
I don't know when I'll return I'm just tryna earn a livin'

[Chorus]
What's up, with you and your career?
And when we back come home would you be there?
Where did you go? Seems like forever since you been gone
Come back home, we know you stoned, we know you wrong
This can't be right, this can't be rap, this can't be life

[The Jacka]
Michelle and Dest the loves of my life
Floydy boy was born in June I said damn you look like
Your big brother come on blood it takes a man in this life
To lead his family all this shit the world did not hand me
I had to take with a gun, my mother wouldn't let me
While y'all was tucked away sleep I'm on the streets with a semi
No water no food, just weed and Remy
I love y'all with all my heart I could never forgetcha
And if you ever start fallin' then your bro'll come lift ya
You know me, the real me, fuck all this rap shit
If you ever got a problem put a mac in ya fist
You gotta war sometime in a world like this
When I think I'm losin' my mind you put me back in my sense
I can wash the blood away but the ground won't rinse
I'm Southwest CF thinkin' bout shit like this
I threw my life away for rap thinkin' I'd be rich

[Chorus]
What's up, with you and your career?
And when we back come home would you be there?
Where did you go? Seems like forever since you been gone
Come back home, we know you stoned, we know you wrong
This can't be right, this can't be rap, this can't be life

[The Jacka]
Fed, you been the illest
Took one for the team bounced back for ya niggas
That's that real shit we really live this shit
Abandoned warehouse seen ten-thousand bricks
With our own eyes so much bread can make the song cry
You wanna have beef with a nigga then that's the wrong guy
Husalasi the Jamaican shower-posse
You might think that he chillin' but he wanna murder somebody
Bagged with twenty bricks never told on nobody
Just took his time and now he doin' the shit
We pushin rocks, but these niggas like they usin' the shit
You square sideline yappin' we got proof in the shit
Rydah been on the block since he was 12 years old
Coppin' whips, pushin' kicks in a world so cold
We ran wit all the real niggas in the P back then
But whoever would of thought we'd end up rapstars man
Supplyin' the water, is their a heaven for a mobster
Probably not so nigga stand back and watch a
Killa knockin' choppin' straight to the cop cars
Standin' by Allah with the Nation of Islam
Makes a lot, boy, our guns keep a hundred in the drums
Niggas standin in the slums mayne

[Chorus]
What's up, with you and your career?
And when we back come home would you be there?
Where did you go? Seems like forever since you been gone
Come back home, we know you stoned, we know you wrong
This can't be right, this can't be rap, this can't be life
