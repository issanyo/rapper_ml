[Hook: The Jacka]
Soon as I start sellin' drugs
Had to say goodbye to the way that we was
Niggas die when we start using guns
Down em' all even though we was young
So young..

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I told Fed that I needed a strap, he came through with one
Knocked a couple old heads down, now me and you was on
Overnight became the connect, but came from moving zones
Doubted me, we too young to move crack, our parents usin' stone
You don't know 'bout no lights no gas, can't even use the stove
Cousin made the bull feel bad, I gotta users code
Always been a sav, but now it's time to use my jewels
Only way to get this scrit, I gotta use a tool
But I'm dope as the smoke that going to a users skull
And jail will slow me down, Sean introduced me to the scroll
When I got out, still trappin' at my momma house
Open the Quran and show any nigga that was lost
Little brother and my mother, any nigga that was close
Words so deep they look past the fact I package soft
This gon' last forever, so this the shit I rap about
Look like we havin' fun, down a path ain't shit to laugh about

Soon as I start sellin' drugs

Ever since I picked a sack up, I got my stacks up
Any nigga out of line guaranteed I'm 'bout to act up
Time to say goodbye to the innocent privileges bein' taken away
Can't make mistakes you fumble you catch a case
Muzzle on the AR coolin' up on the AK I leave the scene vacant
Momma said she always knew I'd be a problem since a baby
I been contemplating lately, suicide but I know that's just satan
Tryna get my paper right for the future and my babies
Push Mercedes made it off of junkies ain't that crazy in the cut
And I'm crankin' heroin, cocaine, molly, codeine, for you drankas
Traces of the past, devil on my ass
Posted on the Av, duckin' cops chasin' cash
Money I'm addicted to is hustlin' is a habit
I be on my grind
