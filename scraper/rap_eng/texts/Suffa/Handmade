[Intro: Suffa]
Hilltop man
Come on

[Verse 1: Suffa]
We carve a song from a riff in a '70s track
And if it's strong in the mix then we set it in wax
We etch words on the papyrus, what's happened? The pattern is so immaculate
The back of a Macci fractures and cracks from the impact of it
Rummagin' for drums to put in back of it and match with it
Hack and then attack in the track, scatter and wraps with it
Back in the lab, I know our absence was felt
Man it couldn't, but now we're back from it
With hands in the clay we mix the sand with the paint
We take the can and we spray, and your standards won't stand in our way
On the land that we lay we know the lay of the land
We take every break and we shape it by hand
The cuts in my hand to the lines in my face
Are from the cuts in the jams to the lines that I lace
That got you up in the stands to a time and a place
When the love took 'em in and we blind to the hate

[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
This is handmade, tailored for all of the fans' sake
No artificial additives are added, just mad breaks
No saturated fats, natural made and that way
The track's laid, keep you satisfied through the ad break
It's handmade, tailored for all of the fans' sake
No artificial additives are added, just mad breaks
No saturated fats, natural made and that way
We keep you satisfied "what you know bout me?
I'm a self-made man"

[Ad-Lib: Suffa]
Get 'em P

[Verse 2: Pressure]
We in the kitchen cooking up a storm
Fixin' up your supper on the deep frier spittin' and the oven's warm
This ain't a buffet food plate past the used date (nah)
This is gourmet souffle, quite a few mates
Planted our seeds in organic soil
Cause some starved for a feed when we leavin' the land of spoil
So we worked it and nurtured our hurt through the dirt
And went further, gave purpose and birth to it
Nothing came expedient, hustle game, belief in it
While Suffa was digging for another main ingredient
Company hated lunches, gluttony and abundance
Debris got the flavour, they hungry jus' for some substance
So if you [?] and you're after the guard of fresh
Give your regards to the [?] Masterchef
You're still hungry, let me ask you world
Takin' our time in a fast food world
