[Intro: Suffa]
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Said he wanna go outside and to chop it up
I'm like, "Cough it up, bruh, is it not enough?
I'm nodding off, God, what a load of poppycock"
If he poppin' off I gotta sock him with a mollywop
What does it take for you to get the message, huh?
You're rude and kind of messy, ah
Now my mood is quite depressin', who are you impressin'?
Loser, I won't dress it up
Me and my friends, we are not
Here for your bullshit
I don't care who you're cool with
Or where you went to school, kid, nah
Uh-uh
My buddy's at the bar waitin'
And I'm too young to be hatin'
But too old to be patient, so all right

[Refrain 1: Suffa]
Man, we'll be all right
Woah!

[Chorus: Suffa & Pressure]
He said to me, "Look, I'm sorry, I'm not myself
I smoked some weed, took some molly, can't stop myself
It's like I bleed then I worry I cut myself"
I said, "Yo, please, leave me lonely! Leave me alone and lonely!"

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Each time that you open your mouth
A little calm inside me dies
Peace sign and you know that I'm out
Before I feel the tsunami rise
Man, I'm sick of this, ridiculous, I've listened to your gibberish
I figure that you need to quit and go!
Is there no limit to your ignorance
Or spirit of ambivalence? I think that is a no!
Huh, ever found it's relieving?
Tryin' to hold in the sound of your breathin'
Silence is golden, you're louder than cheap bling
So ride like it's stolen, bounce for this evening
Man, I don't need the hostility
Your beef don't feed my virility
Cease with the litany, you're seekin' to trigger me?
Kidding me? Seriously? You'll be all right

[Refrain 2: Pressure]
You'll be all right
Woah!

[Chorus: Suffa & Pressure]
He said to me, "Look, I'm sorry, I'm not myself
I smoked some weed, took some molly, can't stop myself
It's like I bleed then I worry I cut myself"
I said, "Yo, please, leave me lonely! Leave me alone and lonely!"

[Verse 3: Suffa]
I see red like a bull to a matador
See red like I'm dressed like I'm Santa Claus
See red like I'm askin' for the manager
See red like cardiovascular
I'd rather be a passenger on the Challenger
Rather lick a sneeze guard on a salad bar
Rather have it off with a lathered up Labrador
Than explore your character, jabba jaw
This all I can endure
You're your own saboteur
Had to draw the line
I'm tryna spend time with my paramour
You're like Paul Manafort
A giant and spineless jellyfish
A man o' war, I'm a man of war
Be silent, all right

[Refrain 1: Suffa]
Man, we'll be all right
Woah!

[Chorus: Suffa & Pressure]
He said to me, "Look, I'm sorry, I'm not myself
I smoked some weed, took some molly, can't stop myself
It's like I bleed then I worry I cut myself"
I said, "Yo, please, leave me lonely! Leave me alone and lonely!"

[Bridge: Suffa]
It's not right
I have to hide in the shadows all night
It's not fair
It seems like at every turn you are there
It's not right
I have to hide in the shadows all night
I gotta sit and listen
Grind my teeth and clench my fists

[Chorus: Suffa & Pressure]
He said to me, "Look, I'm sorry, I'm not myself
I smoked some weed, took some molly, can't stop myself
It's like I bleed then I worry I cut myself"
I said, "Yo, please, leave me lonely! Leave me alone and lonely!"
