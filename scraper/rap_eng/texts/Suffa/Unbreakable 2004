[Commentary: Vents]
Yeah, yeah. Unreleased Hilltop Hoods from 2004! This one's called "Unbreakable". Set it off P. Set it off P. Come on!

[Verse 1]
He was a lost cause, battle-scarred from lost wars
And years spent underground as he wondered now what for
Doped for his due recognition by pop whores
Got scores to settle, now he's thinking 'I want more'
Dreaming of a lasting harvest, bone-thin, another starving artist
Presents sewn in his heart of darkness
His will to fight is frayed, like a cage
Locked himself in a cellar, didn't wanna weather the light of day
But this is torture, living for the
Scraps from above, he fills his cup from the dripping water
His prison order never worked
Got tired of sleeping on a bed of dirt and wearing a shredded shirt
He wipes the sweat and hurt from his brow, pens a phrase
Upon the paper 'bout how he wants to end his day
Jumps up from his rut, the shackles lead his feet
And takes a shortcut, down a back alley, namely easy street
A group of city thieves, cloaked by the deep night
Approach, moon faded as illuminated street light
Revealed a sheathed knife, one spoke, "No attacks
Won't lease the riches with you, just the clothes on your back
And many lose control down the path your headed
And it could bruise your soul", then at last Armaggedon
Spoke with vigour, "I walk the righteous path till I'm dead"
The cloaked figure, tilted his head and laughed as he said:

[Chorus]
Vigilance is a virtue rarely weathered
Your innocence serves to hurt you where you're headed
But if a man can make his dreams attainable
Then he can stand against the sands of time: unbreakable

[Verse 2]
So as he swore with the bitter scorn of a sinner
Sick of the tainted figure that he saw in the mirror
But he knew this life was suicide, either do or die
Keeping company with cutthroats dressed in suit and tie
Time had taken its toll, the price of laying the fold
It cost his mind and in kind forsaken his soul
He was taking a stroll through the city smoke
When a kid approached and said, "I know you, put me on, shit, I'm broke
This livin' is harsh, willin' to dance if given the chance
Your enemies will catch my shiv in their heart
I'm irrational!" The older man said, "Don't act a fool
You're just one man, a young lamb amongst a pack of wolves
You might dress the part, but do you bear the mark
Of one willing to do anything to get a start?
You best know your head from heart, and wear a scar
As a reminder of where you came from to get to where you are
There's a difference between see through and opaque
And there's more than just face value in what people don't say
So keep it clean, and believe your dreams
The only guidelines in life are the ones you need to read between
It ain't about whether heathens will flock
It's about the words you say and whether you believe them or not"
The young man said, "I'll walk the path till I'm dead"
He smiled in remembrance, and laughed as he said:

[Chorus]
Vigilance is a virtue rarely weathered
Your innocence serves to hurt you where you're headed
But if a man can make his dreams attainable
Then he can stand against the sands of time: unbreakable
