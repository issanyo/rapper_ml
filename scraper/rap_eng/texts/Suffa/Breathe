[Verse 1]
In life, we struggle as individuals
A fine line between a cliché saying and something original
As if in death we left something residual
Behind to mark our time up in this pitiful
Existence, and I'm a man of many issues
If I ever dissed you, no disrespect I never wished to
Hold a grudge, the stress makes me act like this
The day I get it off my chest I won’t write tracks like this
But I'll be bitter on them when all is done and is forgotten
Cos it’s easier to sit and complain than fix the problem
But the power of speech endowers our beliefs
With sour defeats, man nothing is out of reach
Got plenty to answer for, all I do is answer back
Done a thousand things I regret, apologise for none of that
So you get back what you put in, no regret
And keep on until they know your sweat, you only get

[Chorus]
One chance, so I live for the moment
I'm just one man, what I wouldn't give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
We get one chance, so I live for the moment
I'm just one man, what I wouldn't give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
Now breathe in

"They can’t—they can't
Can’t bre—bre—breathe—breathe
They can’t—they can't
They can’t—an’t—an’t—an’t—can’t breathe"

[Verse 2]
Now if life is what you make it it’s time to build
Man I'm for real ain't no telling what this life will yield
I'm a career man, cos I career off any path
That would lead me to a start of financial gains I'm scarred
We learn from our mistakes, that makes me a scholar on
Being a walking talking fuck up and a better man for being wrong
I'm humble and loyal, my friendships are honoured
A man's success ain't measured by the depths of his pocket
I give good advice but never follow it, what’s left for me?
I'm a hypocrite, and if I weren't I’d be a success story
View this wide world through a narrow gaze, these harrowed days
Seen too many men end in a shallow grave
I guess it’s better to have loved and to lost, than never stumbled across
The gift of knowing you whatever the fucking cost
To put it in perspective and under my vision
This world is superficial; I'm done with others opinions, we get

[Chorus]
One chance, so I live for the moment
I'm just one man, what I wouldn't give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
We get one chance, so I live for the moment
I'm just one man, what I wouldn't give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
Now breathe out

[Scratches: DJ Debris]
"They can’t—they can't
Can’t bre—bre—breathe—breathe
They can’t—they can't
They can’t—an’t—an’t—an’t—can’t breathe"
