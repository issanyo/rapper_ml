[Hook: Sample]
"Dashing, bucking, greet by fucking family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion"
"Dashing, bucking, greet by fucking family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion"
"Dashing, bucking, greet by fucking family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion"
"Dashing, bucking, greet by fucking family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion"
"Dashing, bucking, greet by fucking family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion"

[Verse 1: Trials]
Obese work on beats with no sleep
Stand tall on both feet till we start to stagger
My grandma got it rented, put the disc in
Pump the shit and take it back and you're forgiven, listen!
That's what I'ma do when your crew drops an album
The difference is mine's sick as fuck and yours ain't even out yet
Trials wanna, drink with a death wish
My kind of investment's a rich bitch pregnant
We down for the cause, Pegz and 'Oars
You wanna find us when we're drinking? Better check the floors
See I'm drunk and disorderly, I oughta be in a room
That's padded like the passage to a period womb
Doing shows for chump change, thanks, fuck I'm too fat
For fashion parades and album fame
The only reason that I said that is to get the bread back
Ported all the promo packs that get sent back (oy Suf')

[Verse 2: Pegz]
Sample the beat up like a man with a cleaver
Standing between the mic and a handful of cheeba
Used to battle for peanuts with glandular fever
Now I walk the streets like a man with amnesia
This is my fam, I got love and respect
You ain't fucking with Ses' or Reflux on the decks
Big Trials with the freestyles, jump on your chest
Plus Hons will take your soul, fucking with Pegz
Nothing compares, disrespect the omen
Better check your head to protect your scrotum
'Cause we kept the Volvo, forget the Shogun
Now we're all in like Texas Hold 'Em
We put food on the table and opened eyes
We put crew on the label and polarised
We truth down the cable and showed our lives
Real hip-hop, I love you like an only child

[Hook: Sample]
"Dashing, bucking, greet by fucking family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion"
"Dashing, bucking, greet by fucking family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion"

[Verse 3: Hons]
We come together like a Christmas dinner
Obese fam, Suffa's beat slams till it's off the Richter
The 'Oars and Pegasus connect like Slick Rick
And necklaces, a perfect match like we more than a Federer
Pure negligence that we ain't blown yet
So they ain't seen our set till this country's tone deaf
I write rhymes like an obituary, and turn the other cheek
On wack rappers like I switch your sex back to missionary
Obese family, 'Oars are drunk uncles
Sleazy with the gin till I give her stink knuckle
I'ma send these new jacks packing back to boot camp
To polish up their skills and take it back to the Boom Bap
My crew fatter than, speak tones of arrogance
These faggots just make me look better so I ain't mad at 'em
I send 'em packing with a punchline
Obese crew, we keep it pure so they don't infect our bloodline

[Verse 4: Sesta]
Yeah, old timers, their lease is up, fuck 'em
Recent releases, Jesus Christ, nothing
But a bunch of motherfuckers that sound like another
Bunch of motherfuckers, it's easy to see Obese the elite
Me, and Pegz, we drink draught to the dregs
Apartment is charred like a wreck and that's half of the rep
You better halven that step, you got a death wish
It looks like a faggot is hanging off that necklace
Since me and T were dreaming our plans to be seen
Not being demanded, we've proceeded
Redefined a new kind of style, CS9 was left behind in bed
We arrived, we signed that dotted line, the family is Certified
It hurts your pride, you can't rhyme
While your girl's miming every word of mine
Props? You couldn't get a third of mine
The bloodline is deep, peace!
