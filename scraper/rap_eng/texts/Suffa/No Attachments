[Intro: Suffa]
Suffering City!

[Hook: Sample & Suffa]
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back!

[Verse 1: Pegz]
So romantic, I roamed the planet
With a mobile phone and global tracking
Showed you passion, no attachments
Follow the link and download the graphics
It's a digital world, know the language
Online with the home advantage
Check my profile pics and post a comment
Sounds impersonal and overconfident
But I'm letting you know I want it
You got style, no one can Photoshop it
Some girls need a rocket scientist
Instructions and a survival kit
Send 'em straight to the recycle bin
'Cause I don't really have the time to give
Yeah, I'm looking for sexy psycho bitch
What's you name girl? You're the finalist
C'mon

[Hook: Sample & Suffa]
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back!

[Verse 2: Pegz]
How could it come so unexpected?
I been waiting so long for someone special
Rough 'round the edges, cuss every sentence
Tougher than leather, you can trust that I'm genuine
I drink, I smoke, I got a drug dependence
A nasty temper and a thug's perception
I'm a B-Boy, young and restless
I don't care if your mum's pretentious
Break my heart, I'ma come for vengeance
Fuck your friends when I'm drunk and desperate
I hitchhiked along the super highway
With a user alias trying to chose a primate
I don't wanna play stupid mind games
Live web cams and computer typeface
Future's bright like school on Friday
Even my little brother got a root off MySpace
(Damn)

[Hook: Sample & Suffa]
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back!

[Verse 3: Pegz]
I've been waiting so long to meet you
Step off with your inflated ego
I don't care if you hang around famous people
All men were created equal
I know you're hot but when I close my eyes
I see Bec Cartwright as a bogan wife
I hear more bullshit than open mics
I'd rather be at Bias B's poker night, yeah
Give me a call when you crash to earth
When you crack the big time and travel the world
I don't want to be a back seat passenger
Respect's something that you have to learn
I got Russian Alex coming back to the burn
Jumble on the next flight bout to return
And it's time to abandon the search
Put love on hold, put friends and family first

[Hook: Sample & Suffa]
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back!

[Outro: Suffa]
Check it out
Obese Fam, Suffering City
I lost my voice on this jam
Suffering City!

[Hook: Sample & Suffa]
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back!
"I've been waiting so long"
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back! And we're back!
And we're back!
