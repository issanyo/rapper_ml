"I used to play beats on the lunchroom table"
"Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?"
"I used to play beats on the lunchroom table"
"Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?"
"I used to play beats on the lunchroom table"
"Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?"
"That's just the state of mind that I'm in"
"That's just the state of mind that I'm in"

[Verse 1: Trials]
See I was nine in grade five, I got my first mixtape
It was a 100 Miles and Runnin' and their first mistake
The B-Side was ill, Doggystyle ninety-three till
Watched the interviews, read the liner notes, skipped the interludes
Before the beef and well-wishing were dead
Bushwick said "Fuck that" and shot himself in the head
You want that kickback, cool out, hardcore, grimy shit
You can find it right between the ninety-two and ninety-six

[Verse 2: Suffa]
MC Twist used to tell me 'bout the cocaine dealers
And fillers, man you could feel 'em back when Ghostface Killah
Had a mask on his face, blast-master Masta Ace
Third base, no [?]
I used to laugh at racist remarks from X Clan
But come away wishin' I could rhyme like Brother J
And I could give a fuck about a summers day with Fresh Prince
He could suck a, suck a, suck a breath mint

[Commentary: Newsense]

[Verse 3: Briggs]
I had a pencil case full of tapes, player in a bad state
Couldn't tell ya how many joints that bitch ate
Gravediggaz [?] villian, Guerillas in tha Mist
Lookin' at my cousins, I was like, "What the fuck is this?"
Snoop Dogg forgot his name, Cube had a good day
Pac killed everyone... except the Wu-Tang
Mase mumbled too much and couldn't fuck with Ghostface
Even though [?] Missy El' [?]

[Verse 4: Sesta]
[?] started in ninety-three, [?] fin rot
No rap section, shop got no hip-hop
It's [?]
On a shitty tape [?] until it clicks and it pops
And nowhere that I lived could really get in The Source
So my sister got it for me, she was livin' abroad
I got the [?] on the VHS
Doggystyle on the side kill the weekday stress
And no one at my school had really heard of a rap
But I've got Geto Boys on the bus Murder Ave
And if I couldn't turn you with that, I'd turn you with nothing
And then an organ donor made me wanna take up production
No wonder that the girls had no time for Ses
He was listening to B.I.G. before Life After Death
With the sex skit on repeat and talked like sex on the regular
Never woulda guessed that it never got... better
