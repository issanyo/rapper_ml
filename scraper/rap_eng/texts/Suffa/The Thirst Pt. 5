[Verse: Suffa]
We stayed away much longer than explained that we would to be honest
There was a spate of delays for the Hoods I guess a promise
Is made to be made, not made to be kept
The way you’d wait all these days hey I’m blessed and I’m honoured
And I guess that I wanted things a little too quickly
‘Cause the last two years felt a little like fifty
In the middle I sit the centre of the three
'Cause pressure causes suffering resulting in Debris
Hilltop, we’re back from a sabbatical, you miss us?
My briefcase is a suitcase, travel’s my business
Said we’d be back last year, but life got in the way of that
But that's life, we play it out, somehow get old then play it back
We made it out, then we made it back, we take them out, we’re still on the road like
Kerouac, have them having them panic attacks, while I’m having a nap
Look the one thing that I know about losing
That’s that I don’t know one thing about losing man we’re back

[Hook: Aaradhna]
We arrive in the night
We come alive in the night (come alive in the night)
Strip the sky of its colour
We’ll run the expanse in the absence of light
Walking under stars, we breathe the night (breathe the night)
Walking under stars, we reunite (reunite)
We come alive in the night
