[Intro]
As we proceed (as we proceed)
To give you what you need (to give you what you need)
As we proceed (as we proceed)
To give you what you need (give you what you need)

[Verse 1]
Like we always do about this time, ink lines for the sick rhyme inclined
It’s grimy shit but naught that can’t be fixed with a little bit of spitshine
Big time like Frankie in Vegas, inspiring like Ali and Frazier
Spit it out till we spilling out on to the street start a party up with our neighbours
I’d rather be part of your playlist, than ever be part of the A-list
Harness the energy, heart of a pedigree with the scars of a sadist
I go so hard on the pavement; I go so far with my statements
That I don’t know where they end and where I start it’s all part of game it’s
The farthest I’ve came since I started to play it, I spar with these artists, the heartless and brainless
We’re harnessed by chains that are hard to escape and you change then they label us bastards or traitors
They’re charlatans, they’re haters, they start on us but they’re fake as
Our parliament, but don’t be disheartened by them pardon their failures
If we don’t forgive our enemies, we’ll crawl the walls like centipedes
Burn our energy like fossil fuels and fuel our own damn effigy
And we’ll all burn like Hennessey, so keep on then and step with me
John Lennon let it be, dead the beef like abattoirs, before these scavengers tear at me

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow

[Verse 2]
And it might blow up but it won’t go pop
And it might blow up but it won’t burst
She said she might grow old but she won’t grow up
Well she might, but only if I go first
She wears her heart on her sleeve like; she’s wearing a patch on her shoulder
It’s not a matter of whether I can catch her, more a matter of whether I can hold her
She thinks out loud she’s got me; she laughs with her whole body
I think about how she got it all figured out and wonder why she’d even want me?
Each night I find it’s the same ole, when I crawl inside in the evening
I lie down next to an angel; fall asleep and fly with my demons
They say don’t live in the past and live each day like it was your last but
I’d rather live each moment like it was my first, take it slow and sip from the glass
Savour the moment, spit vicious bars then pray for opponents
Sounds so serious don’t it? But I’m not concerned with a thing
This is book three, Tolkien, Return of the King
The kings have arrived; we drink from the sky
We fall from all ‘cause we think we can fly
But our wings have been tied, and the winging and lies
Have me I’m wishing that I could bridge the divide
You living the life? In the blink of an eye
The shine of the bling and the rims that you ride
Can all disappear so live for the rhyme
Not material things your gift can provide

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
Getting ready to blow
I’ve been waiting to come back
Like where the hell is the show?
Like a balloon on a thumbtack
I’m getting ready now, I’m getting ready

[Verse 3]
Since State of the Art we’ve stayed in the yard just waiting to start this shit all over
Laying in bars for a day and a half, had to switch from gin to soda
And by like mid October, record was six months over
Due and I‘m like, 'Dude, what you expect? I’m only three months sober'
Coming up turning tree trunks over, running up burning divas, posers
Run amok till the sun is up or till one of us # live la vida loca
I’m gonna roll until I fold, like I got a hold of Propafol
So beautiful to know you all but for now peace I’m over and out

[Outro]
I don't wanna go, go, but I gotta go, go, go
We won’t go, no, we won’t go
I don't wanna go, go, but I gotta go, go, go
No, we won’t go, no, we won’t go, no
I don't wanna go, go, but I gotta go, go, go
We won’t go, no, we won’t go
I don't wanna go, go, but I gotta go, go, go
No, we won’t go, no, we won’t go, no

[Collision]
As we proceed (as we proceed)
To give you what you need (to give you what you need)
As we proceed (as we proceed)
To give you what you need (give you what you need)
