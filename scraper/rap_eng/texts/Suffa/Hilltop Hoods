"More cunts here than at a Hilltop Hoods show"
"Hilltop Hoods represent, represent"
"With a six-pack of pale
Listen to the Hoods and watch The Double Blues boys prevail"
"Hill—Hilltop Hoods
Hill—Hilltop Hoods"
"Pulling strings you don't stop, like the Hilltop Hoods"
"Minds kept like Hilltops, that's why our thoughts are elevated"
"Hilltop Hoods" "That's a good vibe
As good as the first time you saw Hilltop Hoods live"
"The Hilltop Hoods (Hilltop)"
"Comin' from the woods, the Hilltop Hoods"
