[Draino]

I feel for the folks who were left behind
Denied access to share one more breath of air
With their soul mate
But instead they live in despair
And reminisce on the good times
And wish it were their time to go
Decompose into the earth
And even with a loving family it's sadly
A worthless comparison, it's hurts i know
Even attempts at simulating the feeling scare me
For i'll slowly arrive at that intersection
And hope we both go to heaven in quick succession
Damn aggression, sulking, grieving doesn't change
The reflection in the mirror, just you
Nothing much to do, watch t.v
Learn how to work a p.c
Use a pick and shovel in the garden
And chat with your close companions
But none can match that sacred stallion
No one can fathom the half decade of a-grade
Love and friendship
Every sentence of hers was a gift sent from god
So what can I say, 84 years of age
I hope I cheer up your day
Make you not wanna pray for relinquishment
Of your life, I felt like quitting 20 times
During the making of despite the odds
But in retrospect that was insignificant
When all the blood sweat and tears you've endeared
Over the tiers of your marriage
Vanished just like that..
So I’ve realised I fear loneliness more than death itself
I don’t want to be old and grey with no one but self

The old man dwells in darkness
Goes through possibly the hardest part of life
50 years and over he was married to his wife
Things were hella nice, till that final stage
Aged in days, there she lay
Here I pray that he'll be okay
Though in a way things will never get better
I placed a letter in the coffin
And when I drop in to his place
I hug this man, and try to bring a smile to his face
But I could never erase the hurt
He keeps busy hard at work
Feels worth when he can insert a helping hand
I mean where will ya land when your closest friend descends
Her life ends and yours continues
Hard to proceed, when she became more than a want..but a need
Every little deed to be done in the house reminds you of this person
Yearnin for just one more chance, one last glance
One last dance one last conversation
How long this man will be waiting
Pacin...it's hard to manage
Permanent damage a savage attack
How do you react, when ya life becomes flat
And all that shit that used to matter
Scatters on the floor like scrabble letters
I never leave without a wave goodbye, and a honk on the horn
Hoping when he goes back inside he's not feeling scorned
But I realise deep down he's forever torn..
Worn at the soul, worn at the soul
