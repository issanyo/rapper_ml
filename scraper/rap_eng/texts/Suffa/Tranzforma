[Commentary: Suffa]
All right, DJ Debris, time to step away from the mic, get on those decks. You too Adfu! Faint, get off the decks. Let these two on. Fu… (oh fuck) Adfu, stop gambling! Adfu, step away from the gambling! Damn, this music’s epic! It’s like you’re about to fight an Emboss or something. Hey Adfu, I’ve got an idea, we should call this “Emboss Gambler”. What do you think? What’s the deal?
