[Chorus]
We have the thirst
We have the hunger
We dive head first
Into the wonder
We have the thirst
We have the hunger
We dive head first
Into the wonder

[Verse: Suffa]
Don't know where to start, but then again since this is
The third and final part, I guess it's more like where to finish?
You ever seen La Haine? When Hubert kicks a story
About a man and how he fell from like fifty stories
And as he's travelin' from the roof to the hood
Of a car keeps babbling 'so far, so good'
That's how the last five years have felt, like falling in a canyon
The falling part I'm all in, but it's all about the landin'
I see the ground rushing at us
And when we hit the ground will we be running or crushed?
But that's life, courage gotta summon it up
And no matter if we still matter, sun will come up
Uh, my thoughts are running amok
But in my heart, man I know there's no one other than us
That can tear down a crowd like a bear that came down
On a fairground and found all these scared little clowns
I fold 'em, back 'em down
Sat 'em down, told 'em they could snatch the crown
You'd still be able to see our tan lines by the time that we get it back
'Cause we got one-eyed supporters: Fetty Wap
Call a Medevac, fly out, take aim at us
Christmas Story bruh, you'll shoot your eye out
We'll never die out, safe from extinction events
Been through the best and we ripped 'em to shreds

[Sample: Hubert Koundé]
Eh Vinz, tu la connais l'histoire du keum qui tombe d'un building de 50 étages?
Et à chaque étage, pour s'rassurer, le keum il s'répète:
Jusqu’ici tout va bien, jusqu’ici tout va bien, jusqu’ici tout va bien. […]
C'est l'atterissage

[Instrumental Outro]
