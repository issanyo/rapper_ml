[Sample: Sway]
[?] ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show. Turn your volume way past ten.

[Commentary/Intro: Suffa/Maundz]
Oh, shit! Crate Cartel in the building
(Yeah—ye—yeah—ye—yeah—ye—yeah) Whaddup, Maundz?
(What up?) What you on? We on that ol' "Fee Fi
Fo Fum" type of shit. Wassup?
Boppin' along in the club, on the train
Walkin' around in the drains
The fenders and the Yamahas
Know what we want? Ayo

[Chorus: Maundz]
We want the kick, snare, hats, bass
To wake you up like a slap in the face
Bang for the drums, hum for the strings
Tick go the hat, yo, let's begin, uh
So, we need to [?], what's the problem?
It ain't nothin' when the dome keeps a-boppin'
The four-course meal that make you wanna react
Let the drums bang, find me where the beats at

[Verse 1: Maundz]
[?] in my hand, let's get busy
The rap Johnny [?] champion of Burn City
Who wanna rally in the alley over Mozzarelli
Cartel, he put the cheddar down [?]
Non-stop tango, fuck the last dance
We hustle daily in metropolis like Clark Kent
And that's that, just keep the bars cushy
Designed for my type of people, higher than giraffe pussy
Kick your noggin when you're bombin' the burbs
To ash, K get us lampin' in a concierge
No matter what you think, Sonny Jim, check it
The pepper on the drums get assaulted in a second
Uh, the joint wrecker, serve 'em up the salary
Put flames to a fat beat and burn another calorie
I can't front, the drums got me by the balls
Ch-pow, deck the motherfuckin' halls with the

[Chorus: Maundz]
Kick, snare, hats, bass
To wake you up like a slap in the face
Bang for the drums, hum for the strings
... Go the hat, yo, let's begin, uh
So, we need to [?], what's the problem?
It ain't nothin' when the dome keeps a-boppin'
The four-course meal that make you wanna react
Let the drums bang, find me where the beats at

[Verse 2: Trials]
I said best case scenario, you'd wanna bring an army so
That you can watch your weed disappear faster than that red
Ferrari go (Dangerous) Wavey as tsunami flows
I push your buttons like I'm punching in Konami codes
I fuckin' army roll a spliff, it's that big (woah)
If they smellin' the success they caught a whiff of my dick (that's it)
Golden Era and the Crate Cartel
I roll the L like the clock face read eight past twelve
Hell, said them winds keep me docile
These rappers all reaching next to where I keep my mobile
I said "Fuck them" and their friends, motherfuck them too
We're seventeen different shades of some plum bamboo
It's Godzilla versus Gamera, holdin' all the cameras
The same way the fiends are holding soda stream canisters
On payday with eight mates linin' up before them shop
Blinds are up, pour 'em out, fuckin' line 'em up, and

[Chorus: Maundz]
Kick, snare, hats, bass
To wake you up like a slap in the face
Bang for the drums, hum for the strings
Tick go the hat, yo, let's begin, uh
So, we need to [?], what's the problem?
It ain't nothin' when the dome keeps a-boppin'
The four-course meal that make you wanna react
Let the drums bang, find me where the beats at

[Verse 3: Maundz]
Give the drummer some, [?] said it
Alphabetic acrobat, poetic till I'm deaded
Lesson time ichi-ban I need to kick the thumb
Six-five the one I want, BPM fisticuffs
Shoot a fair one right to your ear drum
The motherfuckers out here yelling "Red Rum"
Groobles in the [?] sippin' ice and tonic
Dudes are maxin' with a bugle full of hydroponics
Neck like a wet noodle, bobble when the beat drop
Ha ha, yo, it's the same when the beat stop
Rock, paper, scissor, who wanna play the winner?
I rock the cut like Pacino is the paper scribbler
Ain't considered when it's time for rap discussion
But rappers they discussin', know I bus on that percussion
Turn the function out, that's what the fuck we 'bout
Ch-pow, deck the motherfuckin' halls with the

[Chorus: Maundz]
Kick, snare, hats, bass
To wake you up like a slap in the face
Bang for the drums, hum for the strings
Tick go the hat, yo, let's begin, uh
So, we need to [?], what's the problem?
It ain't nothin' when the dome keeps a-boppin'
The four-course meal that make you wanna react
Let the drums bang, find me where the beats at

[Outro: Sample]
Said "hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Said "hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Said "hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Said "hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Said "hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Said "hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Said "hell yeah", hell yeah
Said "hell yeah", hell yeah
