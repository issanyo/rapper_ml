[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Standing in line, fifteen, couldn't wait
Couldn't fathom any talent in rhyme
Had to get mine, granted in mind
Was my rapping that I thought would never happen in time
Odds stacked to reject us, attacking the hecklers
Reckless with rap till they had to respect us
Laid tracks, never asked for jack for my efforts
'Cause everything we do comes back to affect us
And as long as I got lungs I'mma say this
Long as we get love, we got some that will hate us
We'll never change, it's done for the faithless
And I don't care for favourites on somebody's playlist
Ain't enough paper for the names I gotta mention
Without 'em, no way I would've made it a profession
I wouldn't trade it for a day of my obsession
We're staying dedicated to perfection

[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again

[Verse 2: Suffa]
"I'm still standing"
Fuck it, one of us had to
Though I'm not standing still like a statue
Man, I can tighten loops like a lasso
You see my blood runs blue like I cut up a tattoo
It's ironic, some say it's even confusing
That I’m still standing cause I'm keeping it moving
And I'm still champion, we keep on improving
And I’m Main Source man, I’m breaking and moving atoms
What we spit is absurd
Since a kid, I've always loved the rhythm of words
The beauty of language and spewing the anguish
All over the canvas like the riff was a curb
Now if you live by the word, you die by the pen
The critics can criticise but we're the creme de la creme
Me and P-Dela we blend, what they're calling the standard
Still standing while they're screaming, "When will it end?"

[Hook: Pressure & Suffa]
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again
It's been so long, we're glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn't changed with accolades
We're still standing, and we'll be back again

[Break]
The whole crowd's like...
How long you been here? "I've been here for years"
How long you been here? "I've been here for years"
How long you been here? "I've been here for years"
How long you been here? "I've been here for years"

[Verse 3: Pressure & Suffa]
We still sharp, still craft Hip Hop that they played in the park
Still jamming, still paving the path
Still making our mark, still ain't for the faint of the heart
Still standing, still state of the art
We still sharp, still craft Hip Hop that they played in the park
Still jamming, still paving the path
Still making our mark, still ain't for the faint of the heart
Still standing, still state of the art
