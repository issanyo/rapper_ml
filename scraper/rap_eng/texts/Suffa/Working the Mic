[Chorus (Sampled)]
"Since back in the days we've been the major crew"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"Do that, do that, do do that that that"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"Since back in the days we've been the major crew"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"I'm gonna knock you out"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Who's fucking with me? Suffa MC
Tongue like sandpaper, who's rougher than we?
We been gone for a while it's been a long cold winter
We back to get the crowd off their feet like back injuries
Raps, flaks and similes, acts to hack into me
They try bring me down like a Mac had backed into me
Back your car into me, fact you can't injure me
We back to crack the back of this wack rap industry
These MC's don't wanna, (they don't wanna) mess with me
Fuck that bitch run his mouth its just a
Storm in a teacup
You wack as Aussie troops going to Afghanistan
(I'm in the world war with Muhammad my man) {imitation of ATCQ 'Award Tour'}
I'm taking MC's to war, fuck the friendships and politics
End this because my lyrical depth is bottomless
We thought you'd forgotten us (There's no forgetting me)
You wanna fight? You couldn't win a battle hypothetically

[Chorus (Sampled)]
"Since back in the days we've been the major crew"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"Fuck you fools that's believing' in your own hype"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"Since back in the days we've been the major crew"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"Touch the microphone, the whole joint catches afire"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"

[Verse 2: Pressure]
I had enough of their dissin's and fucking ambition
There's nothing but wishing to come off phat when they're undernutritioned
Hey there no love in your listen, you getting bumped in my system
Your chance is hardly as much as an Iraqi becoming a Christian
You'll never shine, you can't polish a turd
Your shit is dope? But shove it down your throat so swallow your words
I'm sick of copping slander for what I stand for
You're not the man you're just masturbating in your propaganda
And got a lot to answer, your shit don't stink
Think your ship won't sink? Man then it don't think
That you're large and we're small time, to rob easy small minds
Carrying the heavy weight of their ego on small spines
This is rugged raw for heads who want nothing more
While others talk politics and swallow dicks like a fucking whore
So what're they bugging for? Its just hip-hop, love and war
Pressure MC, Hilltop Hoods - The lyric Juggernaught

[Chorus (Sampled)]
"Since back in the days we've been the major crew"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"You ain't writing, you're only exercising your wrist"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"Since back in the days we've been the major crew"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"
"My shit is fly, you can ask anyone"
"Hilltop Hoods working the mic!"

[Outro (Sampled)]
"More cunts here than at a Hilltop Hoods show"
"Hilltop Hoods represent, represent"
"With a, with a, with a, six pack of pale
Listen to the Hoods and watch the double Blues Boys provail"
"Hilltop Hoods (Hilltop Hoods)"
"Hilltop Hoods (Hilltop Hoods)"
"Pulling strings you don't stop by the Hilltop Hoods"
"Minds kept like Hilltops that's why our thoughts are elevated"
"Hilltop Hoods" "That's a good vibe
As good as the first time you saw Hilltop Hoods live"
"The Hill, the Hill, the Hill, the Hilltop Hoods (Hilltop)"
"Wait a minute, no, you didn't, ayy, ayy (ayy, ayy). You disloyal fool-ass bitch-made-punk. Awwww, you motherfuckers. Okay. All right. I run shit here. You just live here! Yeah, that's right, you better walk away! Go on and walk away, 'cause I'm gonna burn this motherfucker down."
