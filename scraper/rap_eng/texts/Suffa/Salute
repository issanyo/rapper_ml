[Verse 1: Suffa]
These other emcees spit 'bout living big
And boast 'bout the shit they buy
Well I got Moby Dick up in my fridge
I got bigger fish to fry
They're feelin' Suff like half their limbs are broken
They're feelin' Drapht like half the window's open
And that's incredible, that we can get 'em all
Open from something we've spoken, so let 'em all
Talk 'bout their gorgeous new wristwatch and let it be
Awkward as high-fiving fist bumps, 'cause they could be
Talkin' 'bout life and how it's rough, instead they be
Talkin' 'bout their rights and it sucks and it's succ-
Ess that does it, so salute to those who it doesn't
Effect, yes, the chosen few who just love and
Respect, if you take life and share it all
I salute you like a five-star general

[Chorus: Drapht]
We salute [?]
[?]
We all salute you
And you, and you
Salute [?]
Yeah, I'm saying Sydney to London
One thing we know
Is how to salute you
It's for you

[Verse 2: Drapht]
You see at times I lost track of what I'm doing this for
Tours were wars, between source and ego
Now I see no evil, an upheaval
No longer see the world through the eye of the keyhole
Behold a golden age, a whole new nation
Holds a whole new race without a race against
Time, a whole new location, a place
That doesn't involve doctors but revolves around patience
Never believed in Que Sera, Sera
Now whatever's going to be will be
'Cause I believe every shooting star
Is just a piece of my freedom, another key to my dreams
Literally it's history in the makin'
More in it for me than just a piece of the bacon
Seeing different faces each day of the week
Well Suffa will change your life just by making a beat
Now that's special
Can't you see that's incredible, no
But see when you're deemed credible they seem to forget it all
Inevidtably they start feeding the animal
The ego, love's a pedastal and it's your most lethal
Weapon, deceitful as you can see through
It is a Lesson that you should breathe through
I'm tellin' all my people it's for you

[Pre-Chorus: Suffa & Drapht]
These other emcees spit 'bout living big
And boast 'bout the shit they buy
Well I got Moby Dick up in my fridge
I got bigger fish to fry
These other emcees spit 'bout living big
And boast 'bout the shit they buy
Well I got Moby Dick up in my fridge
I got bigger fish to fry

[Chorus: Drapht]
We salute [?]
[?]
We all salute you
And you, and you
Salute [?]
Yeah, I'm saying Sydney to London
One thing we know
Is how to salute you
It's for you

[Outro Ad-Libs: Suffa & Drapht]
Salute you
And you, and you
Salute you
It's for you
