[Verse 1: Suffa]
I dress a lies with my eyes and see the naked truth
My flex will break the blade, my weapon is my youth
I'm growing stronger with every breath you're growing weak like a kid with asthma
Grab your puffer suffer suffocating before i have to
[?] flow and breath before my but you
Smother me like an over caring girlfriend
I send this rhyme in the mail with braille cos it has to be felt when [?] like a virgin with a padlock on the chastity belt
Yeah it has to be felt but you're not feeling me or the ability
On my breath, take time like a thousand kid assembly
Assemble with the greatest minds you couldn't recreate this
A moment of time in your mind and take it like a rapist
Laying out your thoughts and the bottom lines is subconscious
Passing out you're lying on your back unconscious
Repulsing now frothing like your overdosing novacane
Push [?] fuck a south
Though I'm short of fame [?]
Still know my name
My thoughts spill through city streets like a burst water main
The cause of my pain is my ex girlfriend's bitches
The notches in my belt are mainly backstabbing bitches
The cause of my pain is hip hop [?]
When put a cap and hoody on a sacrificial lamb
The cause of my pain is tainted tongues at my back
Suffa suffocating put the pressure on the track

[Verse 2: Pressure]
On the track, making mankind think before he act
The Pressure's back, back, back
Wake me resuscitate me I'm sleeping
I'm giving all I got 'cause all I got is what I believe in
Bleeding from my heart the day my own supremacy's astounding me
Jealously surrounding me suffering for my art unless they drowning me
On the track, I live forever
So regardless of the heartless, it's now or never


[Verse 3: Suffa]
You inflate your ego by deflating my status
There's a method to your madness now my status is the saddest
Aggression hits, aggression hits with the hyper done
Message forgotten with me, Pressure rips a microphone
Remember this those that couldn't walk now follow
[?] lie today, future lie tomorrow
So I'll see you on judgement day and there'll be no redemption
If you listen to the track but you didn't pay attention
Your just writing rhyming raps a drop in the ocean
Rhymes mean jack unless they're packed with emotion
You can have 40 syllable patterns, metaphors like a genius
All this is nothing if you don't really need this
You've never seen this underground you're still learning that
My thoughts spill through city streets like a burst watermain
The cause of my pain is my ex girlfriends bitches
The notches in my belt are mainly backstabbing bitches
The cause of my pain is [?] Suffa
When you put a cap and hoody on a sacrificial lamb
The cause of my pain is tainted tounges at my back
Suffa suffocating, Quiromsytics got my back!

[Verse 4: Quiromystics]
See you tried to rearrange, I sit in windowpane
My saddle up's longer than my vision or your name
Its concerns beyond the grave the surface
We play its not a level playing surface I struggle to attain
Remain across the track with tracks with me and Suffa
We live across the action consequence and I, as a kid, would wonder
Settle in the under
My thoughts become corrupt
My object [?] under
I wonder
