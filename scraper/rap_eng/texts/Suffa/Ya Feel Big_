[Verse 1: Suffa]
Check
I love hip-hop (hip-hop), but fuck me
Sometimes it feel like hip-hop don't love me
And I've learnt this from every single person that burnt us
Since we dropped The Calling it's been like a fucking circus
Now how's feeling worthless 'bout how many you sold
And how's feeling nervous 'cause your record went gold?
'Cause if you move too many units you fuck the underground off
They see it's all poppy and they try to cut it down, what?
Fuck me now, man, could this be really happening?
They're actually pressuring and questioning my rapping
Never compromise a rhyme for a crumb or a crust
'Cause Pressure always said, "Let them come to us"
I never dropped the ball for two-hundred grand
I'd rather be fucking poor and have two-hundred fans
And if you understand I couldn't be more grateful
'Cause every day this culture, it gets more hateful, singing

[Chorus: Pressure]
And the fire that you're burning's the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on you's the same one you bit
The grave that you're buried in's the same one you dig
Ya feel big? (ya feel big?) Ya feel big? (ya feel big?)
And the fire that you're burning's the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on you's the same one you bit
The grave that you're buried in's the same one you dig
Ya feel big? (ya feel big?) Ya feel big? (ya feel big?)

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Dear listener, this ain't a resignation, this is a
Thanks for your time, I had you in mind in lyrics for
Everything I ever wrote, every quote
Every cent that I spent on studio time when I was broke
A leisurely road's an option that I never went
For sake of sentiment (fuck it), every word I said I meant
I ploughed full ahead, brow full of sweat
Telling me to keep it real, fifteen years is how real it get
Some acting ill, they never had a deal
Don't know the difference between a mass of skill and mass appeal
Let me know if I've done something to desert you
You never know how much you love something till it hurts you
And I ain't gonna work till I die in a shirt and a tie
Starvin' on a super for my service for life
I take flight from cares all night long
'Cause I don't wanna wake in the morning and wonder where my life's gone

[Chorus: Pressure]
And the fire that you're burning's the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on you's the same one you bit
The grave that you're buried in's the same one you dig
Ya feel big? (ya feel big?) Ya feel big? (ya feel big?)
And the fire that you're burning's the same one you lit
The lyric that comes back on you's the same one you bit
The grave that you're buried in's the same one you dig
Ya feel big? (ya feel big?) Ya feel big? (ya feel big?)

[Interlude: Suffa]
[?]
To any emcee or crew who's dissed us
Since we dropped The Calling, jealous little fuckers
I got a song for ya, check it out, uh

[Verse 3: Suffa]
Fuck you and you and you so clap your hands (clap your hands)
Fuck you and you and you so clap your hands (so clap your hands)
Fuck you and you and you so clap your hands (clap your hands)
Fuck you and you and you so clap your hands (clap your hands)
When did gangsta rap become the new underground?
You people are embarrassing yourselves
'Cause real crim's they just do it, they don't rhyme about it
And I doubt they'd put it out on a twelve, the fuck you tryna sell?

[Outro: Pressure]
All you fucking fake rappers [?]
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Argh

[Ad-Lib: Pressure]
This is for all of those that dissed us to try get their name out there
(What the fuck makes you think I'd put your name on my record?)
