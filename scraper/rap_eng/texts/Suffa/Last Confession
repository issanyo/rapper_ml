[Intro]
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord

[Verse 1]
This will be my last confession
This industry can leave harsh impressions
I have little faith, forgive me for my past discretions
But we live and learn that history and past are lessons
The day this is work, the love of it dies
A handful make it, the others will strive
And hunger can drive hatred but such is just life
I guess jealousy's the curse that the struggle inspires
These critics seek to break and divide
I know I'm bitter but my faith is divine
Take it in stride, yeah I act like I hate it at times
But I found love through this music and a place to reside
For every friend, I have an eager opponent
For every cent I spent on meagre components
I gave something back so I don't feel the need for atonement
Cause we all get our hands dirty when we're seizing the moment
And we always took the lead, peers would follow
And paid for everything that we cleared or borrowed
If my son can benefit from what you see here, my sorrow's
Justified, just that I might not be here tomorrow

[Hook]
When it rains, it pours, when you're soaked and the world
Tries to fuck with ya, trust in ya own and yourself
My biggest fear's to die not knowing you well
And I ain't afraid to die, I'm afraid of going to hell
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 2]
This will be my last confession
Liberty can leave harsh impressions
I have little faith, forgive me for my past discretions
But we live and learn that history and past are lessons
I've always played the hand I was given
No exceptions here, humanity's driven
You see all men are born equal, just the standard of living
That differs between the Jewish, Adriatic and Christian
I'm a logical man given to science
Forgive me, I know religion inspires
But too many have government and political ties
And use state of the art warfare to bridge their divides
There's hate crime wars on daytime talks
And rape trials walk in state wide courts
We don't pray no more, we only break thy laws
So what this world don't give us, we gon' take by force
Assertion, aggression's, murder then vengeance
We treat peace like it's a term of acceptance
Exception, we're not accepting if we're searching for penance
And so these words are for my son so he can learn from my lessons

[Hook]
When it rains, it pours, when you're soaked and the world
Tries to fuck with ya, trust in ya own and yourself
My biggest fear's to die not knowing you well
And I ain't afraid to die, I'm afraid of going to hell
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
