[Hosts Commentary: Vents]
Yo, yo. One, two. You are tuned to the Golden Era 2013 mixtape, and next up is a track by a guy outta Adelaide called BVA. Wassup man? This one's featuring Suffa. Check it. Holla!

[Verse: Suffa]
Check
I don't need your drama, I'ma not going there
Act like a pear farmer, yeah, go grow a pair
Everbody's salty, sick of being lied too
I feel like McNulty, "Yo, what the fuck did I do!"
Ayy, mind your business and I'll mind mine too
No, my two cents, whether we just might do
What I do, tried to walk a mile in my shoes
I'll buy you a white [?] bottom [?]
If I'm too stressed at home [?]
I break off and try to be on my own
But if I'm left alone with my thoughts then (Fuck)
My thoughts they won't leave me alone
So I can wait until the stress and blood pressure gets
So high death's pinchin' my heart
But I guess my man, Mr Trials, went and said it best:
"Life's hard? Try live in Iraq," it go
