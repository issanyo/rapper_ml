[Verse 1: Hons]
Check it out
I've been busy this year, in my room mining bitcoins
To repair the ship so I can pilot through this shitstorm
Overplayed like top pair with decent kicker
I'm just trying to double up so I can buy some decent liquor
Sick with a pen like a hentai animator
Only difference is you ain't fapping later
Now the crew back together lay it down for the posse cut
We make noise while you back up like lorry trucks (beep beep)
Safe to say no stopping us, we stand tall poppy
While they looking for a crop to dust
He's in the Oars, right? (RIGHT) Yeah, that poor guy
Local on a Saturday crying into forum guides
Body hates me, problems in my back again
Feels like it went through the damn car crash again
Call me 'Farmer Hons', I'm in the parking lot
Scavenging for coins to fill a script for my barkin' dog

[Verse 2: Briggs]
Yeah I slept, I never left, ya felt abandoned
So I’m back with a gang of cannons, Afghanistan 'em
Wiped the floorboards with war lords
I'm carpet-bombing any problem and going at the world tour
Certifiable hand up on the bible
Stand up in the churches man there'd be a fireball
It's the maniacal and I'm going Michael
Buble, Bolton, J Fox, I am so
Effortless I'm effin this, I'm everything they ever wished
I get it off technically, like messing with the evidence
Divine intervention, the messenger was heaven sent
Burning anythin', getting next to me like effigies
Torture connoisseur, not afraid to water board
Get your head down like walking out the porno store
S'all the same if you're in the game or on the force
Golden Era gonna run a train like "All aboard!"

[Verse 3: Trials]
I gotta make sure they get it right
Trials got them leaving in a stretcher like
Petrified, running fucking low on their electrolytes
I bring it hardcore, like slipping in parkour
And got them all convinced that what I'm doing is an art form
(Word) That's an everyday Oars thing
So many people stuck to the pipe that it's exhausting
Got you shovel in the rubble trying to bury facts
Till I'm back, then you're sucking on the urinary tract
Nice try, wanna help me to rhyme
But with that new fancy watch you couldn't tell me the time
(You'd better check in) I'm the boss figure last level
Turn your wines into weeds, flower petal into sharp metal
Had to settle myself from getting drunk
When they told me life is short, but it's the longest thing I've ever done
(SON) Standing like you're holding handlebars
You can get your car keyed while I'm wearing camouflage

[Verse 4: Vents]
Cynical since the prenatal, every birth is painful
Each breath I take is a gift be grateful
Trying to find a female who'll stay faithful
Know how to cook, look good and stay stable
Living like a 8-ball, strapped to my naval
Sniffing up a plateful of rack up my nasal
Awful enough to kill a mere mortal
People get high so we can feel normal
I'm real thoughtful, my mind move a million
Miles every minute, I blame the reptilian
Brain that's killing the pain with aggression
Love is the answer, hate is the question
Fuck all the drama, just like my father
Try, but you'll never find a chink in my armour
Been through the karma and came out harder
Open my mouth and it rain out lava

[Verse 5: Suffa]
Wanna step? Make it worth my effort
I gotta perfect record of making all these perfect records
Best yet to hold the mic
Drop science on meth heads: Walter White
Assault the mic, we rule the court
Get expelled from the school of thought
(THIS IS IT!)
Read my palm leads to the middle finger
Rhymes lead to the middle of the sphincter
(THE SHIT!)
You sound like Chewbacca screwing two fat goats
With a mouth full of chewing tobacco [Chewbacca roar]
You sound like your beating your palm
While I'm the pack leader Cesar Millan
(tst tst) When me and P in the booth
We don't plagiarise like Shia Lebouf
And these beats are like coal whenever we be rhyming
We put 'em under Pressure and he turns 'em into diamonds

[Verse 6: Pressure]
I smash tracks like freight trains collide
Unbreakable maintain a mic
Brave take a ride, vacate your mind
I dunno how a single brainwave survives
Got suitcases, train stations, flights
With this family spending my vacation high
It's painstaking and may take your life
Kurt Cobain say today it's a great day to die, uh
Where the track that the bass shake the jive
Don't skip a beat I'm the pace making type
(P be good) While my mates save the tribe
But they say a tiger ain't change its stripes
Wanna break in the game wait your time
Don't get desperate, giving off date raping vibes
You a sheep in the light, the place ain't finite
I'm the beast to the right at the great Satan's side

[Hook: DJ Debris and DJ ADFU]
(DJ Debris and DJ ADFU scratching the hook)

[Verse 7: K21]
Yo, its K I get away with murder a massacre like September
Cannibals aren't this famished, a rapping this when I enter
Wrecker, left the sector flatter than a placenta
Avenger, set to destroy more when I vent, mo'—
Fucker, it's Aussie rap expecting more then a barbie
Or an opinion from me, unless its forced into your ass cheeks
I'm as nasty as Nas be, hurling tsunamis
At your personal army, with a sweet burn like some sake
Picture me trollin like Dolan, putting work in like a sparky
Holding a spliff rolled till I light up the house like a Griswold
Cookie crumble and take your milk and your Monte Carlos
Shoot rappers down like rabbits, frankly, you're a bit Donnie Darko
So I wouldn't give you a stinking bucket of piss
To put you out if you're on fire and think your fuckin' with this
Never learn stop, till I earn stock to buy out Murdoch
While the earth rots and let a jerk flop when he turns [pop]

[Verse 8: Sesta]
Beat the baddest and trim the fat off for each rapper
Single-handedly defeated famine
You can thank me later hater, feeling forsaked and violated
Gimme two shakes I will annihilate 'em
See, my crew has 2 Dans, two Matts two Adams
One Baz, Adfu and that's Joe a loose cannon
Plus my brother 21 who refused to defuse the bomb
Buddy hose your blood outta the gutter
(WHAT IT LOOK LIKE!)
I'm feelin' about as reasonable as Pac was
Slap your hat backwards, feel it in your chakras
Should have read the fact bruz and you would have seen
The fact that I can ruin a scene like bad actors
(CUT) Nah think you better try
First eating ravioli in my ninety dollar white shirt
With my holier than thou frown
Putting it down, now they found dead, holla
