[Commentary: Grieves]
Yo, what's up? This is Grieves from Rhymesayers Entertainment, and you are now havin' your goddamn mind blown, bitch! On the Golden Era Mixtape 2013. Peace

[Scratches: ADFU]
"Yeah" "Suffa" "Sesta" "[?]"
"Representin'" "Part two"
"Yea—Yea—Yea—
Ye—Ye—Yeah!"

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Check it out
I'll serve you now like Rafael Nadal
Smack you in the brow like Manny Pacquiao
Put a fracture in your crown like, "How you like me now, huh?"
Scatterin' the patterns, have 'em gatherin' around the
Stage like a pig pit, rage like a sick bull
Cage with a pitbull, no place for the bullshit
Oh, it's the Golden Era squad
Stalkin', you're out of your league like Billy Bob
Thornton escorting Jolie, you should really stop
Talkin', it's squawkin' to me, ya boring
Test the Hoods [?] tell 'em "No bro"
Makes no sense like a Buddhist yelling YOLO
Step in my dojo bro, it's a Horrorshow
[?] to Kid Solo
We show these [?] I'm pro [?] their mojo
Pose for a photo then go home like peace
(Fuckhead)

[Sample: [?]]
"Um, think you could maybe take it up a notch"

[Verse 2: Sesta]
Yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' this, I'm feelin' a bit ill
Can't kill him and I'm willin' [?]
Done dealin' with [?] feelings, I must deal
With reality stripes, you're under attack
You got a bad track record for putting bad tracks on your record
Bet on that's all that I can let on, uh
Till I snap, crack, then fap furious
Clear the sample [?] sing a song with us
They're pursuing us, I kick harder
Binge harder just for kick startin'
Shout-outs to Ben Martin
I'm just tryna bury my D in the sea: Bin Laden
I got a version of you as a person
Do a verse and rehearse, do away with the virgin
It deserves with a hearse, being burned is a curse
But the first motherfucker to really want it'll earn
