[Hook:]
I don't dance
I don't jump
I don't front
I do the fuck what I want

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Pressure tired as fuck lining up
It's getting old, it's cold and half the night is up
And you wonder why fights erupt, wisen up
Mr. Door bitch, let me inside the club
With his gelled hair, tight pants, silky shirt, man fag
Let me in soon or I'ma piss in your hand bag
What's he gonna do if he gets bashed in the streets
He ain't a bouncer (What?) he's just the fashion police
You know what's tragic? A girl stops traffic
You let her in, stop a bloke, that's a cock block faggot
Get a sweater for my dress code
What you suggest, yo?
Matching knitted sweaters with my best bros?
An entry pass, give me entry fast
Before your head comes acquainted with an empty glass
Clubs and bad pussy are one and the same
After I talk my way in I'm never coming again

[Hook: Pressure]
I don't dance when the DJ sweats me
I don't jump when the MC begs me
I don't front and there is no cop
I do the fuck what I want

[Verse 2: Trials]
Mr Trials, grubby in a club with a nice shirt
Trying to find a honey with some money and a nice purse
I'm on a bender and broke won't stop us
So I hobble to a rich bitch as thick as their wallet
Promised the world to this girl then I get her heart racing
Simply to put it, find some more and say the same shit
I need a drink like Mick Jagger needs a hit
I need a drink like Angelina needs to leave her lips
I'm at my peace when I'm pissed, if I get a drink
Tell a chick whatever I got tell her to make her my bank teller
I'm a rank feller in need of Jesus Juice
Jesus Christ what I need to do
Stop the whole girl flattery thing
People buy it better when you walk around with charity tins
Now, say I'm fucked from birth
Find a girl with purse that bulge and drinking problem solved

[Hook: Trials]
I don't dance when the DJ sweats me
I don't jump when the MC begs me
I don't front and there is no cop
I do the fuck what I want

[Verse 3: Hons]
Hons the last dude that want to check your tracks
For real what you think I'm about to press it up on ear wax
I doubt that man, that's one thing I hate
When cats spitting in your ear like it's an SM58
I want to tell 'em get fucked, I came here to get drunk
And throw game like bad losers that's run out of luck
But yet I'm stuck feeling awkward
With some cats spitting his flavour in my ear like Craig Mack was in my Walkman
I'd rather shit talk and at least I'd get a word in
And not some rapper's dinner all floating in my bourbon
And when he's spitting I ain't even listening
I came to see the live set not a pop star audition
And I couldn't really care about the shit you writin'
And if I want my ear chewed then I'd go toe to toe with Tyson
And if you're offended, I ain't trying to be harsh
I'll hear your shit when it drops so leave me at the fucking bar

[Hook: Hons]
I don't dance when the DJ sweats me
I don't jump when the MC begs me
I don't front and there is no cop
I do the fuck what I want

[Verse 4: Suffa]
Suffa standing at the bar cos I wanna shout, a round
Getting ignored so I had to pull my wallet out
I'm down with the fact that you wanna get some play bro
But you've been serving chicks while I've been standing here like "ey yo"
Don't take all day bro, stop that weak shit
That girl don't want you, that bitch wants a free drink
Now I'm getting shitted out this cat would've bought the bitter out
If I was a broad and walked in with my titties out
Oh, this bartender thinks he
Can get these girls tipsy in hopes of a wristy
On the real son, try make me feel dumb
If I can't buy a fucking drink I'ma steal one
And spit liquor on the bar to set it on fire
Half price drinks is what it said on the flyer
But I can't even get served man, yeah that's chill
Ignore me all night I'ma rip off ya till

[Hook: Suffa]
I don't dance when the DJ sweats me
I don't jump when the MC begs me
I don't front and there is no cop
I do the fuck what I want

[Verse 5: Sesta]
Uncle Sesta, rolling up already half cut
Bouncer still mad as a motherfucker from last month
I've done fucked up tequila, lethal
Have me stealing and screaming and feeling up a beater vehicle
Names at the door, chill bro I'm good
"Whats your name?" "I'm Debris from the Hilltop Hoods" (how you goin'?)
Post myself with the drinks facing a sick shit
Hanging off my lip while I'm chasing a bitch
Don't buy her a drink, give 'em a flyer and wink
See you at my show next week (oh)
Before I touched the whore
She bounced when her fat friend turned around like "he's a Funkoar!" (slut!)
Called to the bar, now pour all of my shots but four bucks is all that I got
Fuck this I'ma bail
'Cause a lot of fans want me to sign their chest but they're males

[Hook: Sesta]
I don't dance when the DJ sweats me
I don't jump when the MC begs me
I don't front and there is no cop
I do the fuck what I want
I don't dance, I don't jump, I don't front
I do the fuck what I want

[Outro: Sample]
"Once I had a love
Kissed him every morning
Then one day my love
Left with no warning"
