[Verse: Suffa]
[?] Suffa can bring it in
[?]
Bring it in like the new year
When the rhymes are so ill you just heart out
I'm a lion in the wilderness, I'll eat your heart out
Man, I'm sick of this hip-hop, [?] sufferer
For every hot chick there's a guy sick of fuckin' her
Said that to fuck with ya, ayy, Butcher that breakbeat (what up?)
Tom Thum on a beatbox, we reppin' The Crate Creeps
