[Ad-Lib: Suffa]
Gonna have to tune down to get that bottom bit

[Sample: Kevin Spacey]
"An obese man... a disgusting man who could barely stand up; a man who if you saw him on the street, you'd point him out to your friends so that they could join you in mocking him; a man, who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal."

[Scratches: DJ Debris]
"Stay the fuck away 'cause I spit when I'm talking"

[Verse: Suffa]
The rhyme's so Obese that Weight Watchers couldn't save me
Impact is so fat I sweat butter, spit gravy
So leaving a microphone alone with the Gravyspitter's
Like leaving a paedophile at home with the babysitter
Shit it's gettin' harder every day to keep up with
All these new kids coming out, although most of 'em suck
Think they're nothing compared to the Certified (what?)
Prepare to murdered by the Suffa you sucka, that's fuckin' word to my
Man Pressure, ain't no man fresher
Suckas don't try it because we're standing united like fuckin' Manchester
Put your microphone away, you gets blown away
Like castles in the sand, master of this journey, the only way
You're taking me out's if you're hot chick with no taste
A woman that's practically all bosom and no waist (what's up, girl?)
And if she's into hip-hop I'll have a baby with her
Suffa MC, Hilltop, a fuckin' Gravyspitter, uh

"Stay the fuck away 'cause I spit when I'm talking"
"Stay the fuck away 'cause I spit when I'm talking"
"Stay the fuck away 'cause I spit when I'm talking"
"Stay the fuck away 'cause I spit when I'm talking"
