[Hook: Sample]
Do it together, together
Together, together

[Verse 1: Trials]
Listen up, I got this, I got, I got
I got saranarity amongst the suss
But still act surprised when the coppers fuck with us
See that my mates are primates, ingrates and “I rates”
That’s why the [?] are not yours, right mate
See, son? Son, you don’t know my shit
You started rapping for the caption in a profile pic
I’ma rhyme ‘til I got gold (What? Like Slick Rick?)
Nah, I’ma rhyme ‘til I got old (What? Like Slick Rick?)
If it sit still, Trigga got fish skills
Get your phone out and call a star like “What? This kid’s ill!”
Man, Suffa on the beat mean a boom box
Suffa in the street, you got a new release? Chuck it on a heap, huh
It gotta be something in the water
Every week, my friend’s popping out another son or daughter
I guess having kids is played out
Like my rock stars, I gotta give it away, give it away now
Ha ha, and that’s for real

[Hook: Sample]
Do it together, together
Together, together

[Verse 2: Sesta]
Still trying to run with the basics
Either you’re humble or you’re feeling evasive
Keep the trouble to a minimum status
Even your mother’s like “I’m feeling who made this”
Whatever the case is, represent the status core
Well, what needed but being the badest?
Dope, we broke, that’s what we do for the crust bro
Forget the looks, she need respect for the nuts
And please treat ‘em like The Veronicas
‘Cause, if one of them’s gone, then they lost their appeal
And I ain’t dealing with that, nah, for real
I ain’t dealing with that (fame? I ain’t dealing with that)
Everybody want the club but no way I can walk through
‘Cause they’re saying I gotta dress like a court room
And that’s irony ‘cause, when I get it in
I see what’s going down, I wanna start firing
Yeah, nah, nah judge, I’m cool
Just under the weather, fact, let’s just do it together, come on

[Hook: Sample]
Do it together, together
Together, together

[Bridge: Sesta (Sample)]
(When I go) When I go
(When I go) When I go
(When I go) When I go
(When I go) When I go
(When I go) When I go
(When I go) When I go
(When I go) When I go
(When I go) When I go

[Interlude: Sesta & Trials]
What are you actually telling ‘em man?
You know what? I don’t even know

[Verse 3: Hons]
Entertainment by Peepshow, we on point
Like a free throw, got the game locked like the key broke
I grew up in the Suffering City
[?] like a buck fifty now, tell ‘em who with me
My punchlines are butable, swinging in the club rule
The scene turn weak man so fuck ‘em all
The greatest hit like a gutable mine still pumping
In the car ‘til their ears bleed like I cut ‘em all
I got a good soul with bad intentions
A Jagar skull on me, that’s damn impressive
[?] on the turfs through the summer and the winter
The cook too drunk that smile in your picture
The Jack goes down like the whiskey in the oval office
[?] never thought I’d get a problem off him
Must’ve been a bad influence on me
He keep getting up, I need to knock him down properly
