[Commentary: Pharoahe Monch]
Yo, yo. It's your boy, Pharoahe Monch. You already know what it is. Coming straight from Queens. Holdin' it down for my peoples, Briggs. Yes sir, and this is the Golden Era Mixtape. You already know what it is 'cause this the Golden Era. One

[Verse 1: Briggs]
It's me you been looking up, 6'1"
A tonne and none of these chumps are close to good enough
Talk about what you shoulda done
"I'll give him a piece of my mind, but a moment never arrived, but it's what I woulda done"
Alrighty son, whatever helps you sleep
And floats your boat, whatever puts your mind at ease
But I suggest you keep your words behind your teeth
And keep away from me, I ain't raising your seed
Mister Role Model, far from it
Been on the bottle since birth, you put a keg in my hearse, I'm never off it
So how am I supposed to teach your kids
When I can't tell you what day of the week it is?
See, the fact is, you couldn't trust me with a cactus
That shit'd die quicker than me with a cat did
Blacklist? Yeah, that's just fine with me
And when the siren sounds, it's just my sign to leave
(Peace!)

[Hook: Briggs]
Looking at me (Right)
I'm likely to be (Right)
Some kind of thief (Right)
You got the wrong brother!
Looking at him (Right)
He's some kind of crim (Right)
His last name is Briggs (Right)
You got the wrong brother!
Looking at you (Right)
Got something to prove (Right)
Whatcha gon' do? (Right)
You got the wrong brother!

Fuckin' career"

[Hosts Commentary: Trials (Suffa)]
You know the deal for real. You're listening to the Golden Era Mixtape 2011. Peace the fuck out to the Yorta Yorta crew.  Shepparton represent! [?] Briggs, what it is?! It's about time Suffa stepped the fuck up, and wack rappers step the fuck off
(Golden fuckin' Era!)

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Check, you ready for more? (You ready?)
I got those jumper leads arcin' and I'm wettin' the floor
Give you the ACDC, know what I am saying?
Man, I'll get my point across like a Mayan mace
(Take it easy!) Ease it off, or I might blow
Like an IED was strapped to Peter North *boom*
Now that's upsetting man
And we can shoot the breeze like gas at an Afghan [?]
I guess a New York letter, man
I'm bringing that news to 'em like telegram
(Are you a better man?) Huh, am I? You bet I am!
And I better am a better man I tell you friend that he better scram
'Cause when I heard your name, thought "Man, don't hurt him"
It's the dumbest thing I've heard since "Hammer, don't hurt 'em"
Can't fuck with me, the Suff' MC, [?]
So the only way you're touching me's by kissing the ring
It goes
