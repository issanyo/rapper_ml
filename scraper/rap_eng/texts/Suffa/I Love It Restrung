[Verse 1: Suffa]
I'm wondering where the day went
The clouds had me shrouded and grey but
I'm still out pounding the pavement but
Drowning the hurt by pounding rounds in brown paper
Founded a label now I'm drowning in paperwork
But now the crew I'm down with found an escape from work
And I love it cause that's what your hard work gets you
My heart bursts through my chest I'm rescue
So forget what the rest do
I'm blessed to, do it with two of who are the best to do it
Do I love it?

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Look at our goals
If we never stood in the cold we wouldn't evolve
Use to put my crooked foot in what I couldn't resolve
But took control now hard work is good for the soul
And I love it
Growing through life and stress
Knowing the fight is just half of self-imposing our righteousness
Contract owners and licenses, showbiz and lights, we're just
Searching for the moment of pricelessness

[Hook: Sia]
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b boys I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we’ve all grown up and it’s still about the hip-hop
I love it I love it

[Verse 3: Suffa]
Five days deep in the booth then spent Friday leaping through loops
Then spent the weekend Sideways seeking the truth
And I won't lie they keep me on my toes these days
But I won't lie hey I beat him with the flow for days
Cause I love it
A pen and pad is like a red rag to a bull
I see red like Leningrad
Raising the crowd from a vacant lot, like how?
Like raising the brow on the face of God right? Right now

[Verse 4: Pressure]
And I love it
A life with no regret
No success without a price that owes a debt
I roll the dice and despite the road ahead
Hope that in the a crisis I might just know the ledge
But I love it like take away beer
Then a sunset to lay away your day to day fears
See haters underrate us but this status takes years
And it ain't where we at it's how we made it right here

[Hook: Sia]
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b boys I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it’s still about hip-hop
I love it I love it

[Verse 5: Suffa]
And we can be at a hotel worst part of town
And support act we ain't half as loud
But twice as nice you can ask the crowd
And we passing out at the departure lounge
And I love it I hug the road
Like an old friend like the world won't revolve
Unless we're rolling on it, it holds them on it
It's soul melodic, and oh they want it
Come on

[Verse 6: Pressure]
I love it
We’re chasing the dream
Everyday a new place new faces and scene
Living out of suitcase few place in between
There's been very few days I loose faith in my team
Got love far from home through the winter and summer
No matter how hard the road or the distance we cover
Even bitter when I'm missing my significant other
But wouldn't trade it for the world, given another
Cause I love it

[Bridge:]
B-boys
I ask for, I ask for dc, I just knew how I love to do
I’m just loving it, yeah, yeah, another day
Yeah, I just knew how I love to do

[Hook: Sia]
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b boys I met you at the bus stop
I love it I love it
We had nothing but the tuck shop
I love it I love it
We had school ties the skies and the hilltops
I love it I love it
Now I've grown up and it’s still about the hip-hop
I love it I love it

[Outro:]
C'mon, Adelaide, London, Melbourne, Sydney
(I love it I love it ...)
Hong Kong, New York, Zurich
(I love it I love it ...)
I love it I love it
