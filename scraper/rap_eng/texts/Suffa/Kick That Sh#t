[Commentary: Suffa]
Check it out, DJ Debris has decided to not only rhyme on this mixtape once but twice! Well known MC – DJ Debris, ladies and gentlemen. Trigga Trials…and uh…hey, K21? Uh, question:

[Verse 1: K21]
Who do you know? I do it like this at a two O
Want five but no [?] bureau
Pea and pop or a nuso
Numero uno, stick up my sword like a bazook-o
With tour raps, heavyweight sumo
Cause panic with a drum in your speaker
One hundred K’s, I’ma run like a cheetah
Until I go stealth, then I hunt like [?]
Standing up on your bleacher
The bad man attacks, then I've come for your leader
[?] another mission
That’s when I move in your position
Slow it down till I freeze the frame
Takin’ over the house till I lease the place
You Bambino shake like you’ve never been home late
What? I never leave till the beats I make are all
([?])
Damn foul, actin’ like an unfunny land's crowd
With his pants down
But, if you wonder my name, you’re a mad coward
Stuff doing it, they ain't planned it out
They just mad now they get no hand out
Good luck, you can tell me how it pans out
[?] your team bagged out
I'll give you something you can rant about
While I'm on a tune, just spazzin' out
Got a minute till it's due then I cram it out
But ask Ben if you want to know what that's about
When I rap, I'm 'bout to be blacking out
Like I'm packing out what they [?]
Got a dark soul like I was [?]
And that's all till I'm back, for now
But sucker, you were never (you were never, you were never)

[Hook: Sample]
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit

[Verse 2: Trials]
Now, tell me who is next, who the best?
Got human flesh in a junior spesh
In the big belly, I'm thinking that Kirsty
From [?] Shane Warne, you thirsty?
Lurking from popping [?] club
[?] and you stop
Back in [?] with a toaster
Still do a shit on a dunny with [?]
Reefer [?]
Into the [?] golden retriever
I'ma [?]
And passed around the place
Like a feedback, I need that
Wrapped around my face
They call me Mr Ed with that one-tonne
Twenty foot long dick instead
What you want besides this Donkey Kong up in your face?
I put this speller in the works for all your shitty mates
I got foes in different area codes
So leave it alone if you're feeling good like Nina Simone
Or else, I'm coming back, understand
Call to [?] ya, pulverise ya
Stole that show, I'm the organiser
Went backstage, [?]
What's tighter than Golden Era? (what's that?)
What's tighter than Golden Era?
What's tighter than Golden Era?
([?])

[Hook: Sample]
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit

[Verse 3: DJ Debris]
True that, who that? It’s me – the fab
[?] with a bat in mind to match
One tat, full of facts, I love to scratch
Been a long time since I rhymed but I’m back
With avengance [?]
DJ MC, we live in a dimension
Not known for [?]
Debris, GE, comendeering your attention
And did I mention I'm part of the back line?
I hide mine in the wind without chimes
No lying, sometimes it's hard to shine
But hard times bring others to the grime
And, during those times, find I appreciate
Small things like dinner plates and [?]
[?] topic for debate
Debris signing off, never early, always late

[Verse 4: K21]
With a [?] and I'm nervous on a break
Feast on a week, put bourbon on the plate
In a league of the beast [?]
[?] to your brain
There ain't ever a chain you can make like his
To get 'em in the air when I hang my fist
To get a sort of track and a bang like this
[?] type shit, and we're doing that
Kicking your door like Star Force
With no mask for
Don't you ever go there when it's past dawn
You get the last draw and then your heart torn
What the fuck did you ask for?
I'ma call Vents, hell
And bring it class war with no passports
[?] venom on a plane, any second, any day

[Hook: Sample]
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit, kick that shit
Kick that shit

[Outro: Turntablism]
"Check out my track record" "You don't really [?]"
"It say on my track record"
"Hold up, hold up" "Check out my track record"
"And if you can't stand the pressure"
"Check my swag"
