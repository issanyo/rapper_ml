[Segue: Suffa]
—Original's, wassup?!

[Sample: [?] & [?]]
[?]: I said it before when you first came in, if there's anytime it could be anything positive to help with the kids [?] from my just mistakes [?] same mistakes I'm all open for it
[?]: And what—And what would you—And what would you like to say to them about the mistakes?
[?]: About the mistakes... you know, everybody make mistakes

[Verse 1: Briggs]
They got the A.V.O. on the A.B.O
They still play the joints on the radio
Now the A.T.O tryna find me (come get it)
Was ballin' too hard, now they're tryna fine me
I never took a handout (never), I took the mans route
Now I'm what the fans demand like, "Who the man now?"
Eighty-seven [?] caught 'em with their pants down
Twenty-sixth of Jan, ain't it funny how it panned out?
Took that advance for the new album
I took that advance and bought the used Falcon (it's a piece of shit)
We got the whole world captivated
Rapper's emasculated, word is they want me decapitated
'Cause they can't see me head on
I bring flames to their face till their hair gone
They got their hands up, but never shoot a fair one
Talkin' blackball, but where's their pair gone?

"Keep your eyes open, I" "They claim I ain't deep enough"
"Keep your eyes open, I" "They don't want to turn they speakers up"
"Keep your eyes open, I" "Forgot about two—two—two
Things, my black balls"
"Keep your eyes open, I" "They claim I ain't deep enough"
"Keep your eyes open, I" "They don't want to turn they speakers up"
"Keep your eyes open, I" "Forgot about two—two
Thi—Thing—Thi—Thing... black balls"

[Verse 2: Trials]
Yo, the chronic got me feeling delphonic (yeah)
The first hit I'm understanding all the planets, by the second I forgot it
They can polish on my sack while I'm dumpin'
While I'm being fed eggs by girls with bodies like buttered up pumpkins
They stay dominated by fear
If you see us coming, guarantee we're closer than we may appear
While you bitch about your bullshit (my brother that's lazy)
If there's booty in [?] (motherfucker that's [?])
They ballin' on a budget, [?]
Ball so big you can't detect him with that [?]
No doubt, line 'em up and I'ma take 'em out
While I'm tryna find a place they serve my type like a paper-route
And even if the weed's shit, man, I still smoke it
I tap it like the dunny door's locked but still open
If you're not already rappin', what happened? I wouldn't join today
I wish 'em well and watch 'em throwin' all their coins away

[Sample: [?]]
[?]:  A lot of kids saying they get they, they input off of rap music or rap artists, our entertainment. I think, um, some of that could be true
I just got one motherfucking question

[Chorus: Briggs & Trials]
How you gonna blackball the black boys?
If you're gonna do it, hurry up (Black boy)
How you gonna blackball the black boys?
If you're gonna do it, hurry up
Hurry up
If you're gonna do it, hurry up
Hurry up
If you're gonna do it, hurry up
Hurry up
If you're gonna do it, hurry up
Hurry up
If you're gonna do it, hurry up (Black boy)
