[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
So what's your name? Suffa MC on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name Pressure MC on the mic tonight
Say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name? Suffa MC on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name Pressure MC on the mic tonight
Say word, say what, say it's alright

[Verse 1: Pressure]
I got Aussie purity like pollies got immunities
I only litter in public 'cause I'm creating employment opportunity
See I'm ya average fella, mate I have to tell ya
Ignorance is bliss until you listen to my acapella
I read them pictures in magazines, I dug the covers of books
I take hip-hop at face value, don't pay a cent for their looks
I see the scene's getting ugly, lucky we vision impaired
'Cause that image is skin-deep like the make-up they wear
I keep my ear to the streets and my hand on my wallet
I keep my feet on solid ground and keep searching for profit
For what it's worth I carried the weight till it practically kills
It's worth so little I canâ€™t afford my chiropractical bills
I'm actually ill, relax and chill its time to build
There ain't no scars this world can put on me that time won't heal
See it's your own complex that puts you under pressure
Tearing it up is easy fella, but can you put it back together?

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
So what's your name? Suffa MC on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name Pressure MC on the mic tonight
Say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name? Suffa MC on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name Pressure MC on the mic tonight
Say word, say what, say it's alright

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Reverse a rhyme, factory line I'ma tear this mic apart (true)
And I'ma start by giving shouts to Nasty Arts
What's up troops, I split loops like Atoms
A girl like Eve's like fruit to Adam
So take a bite off it, if it's tight knock it
This my stage sucker, get your mic off it (he said off it)
The force in my soul is sonic
My brain's a CPU, I'm simply 2-0 bionic (who ya on it)
My man just clap your hands for style
It's a free trip to Afghanistan, you don't want it
Like keep a priest in the bathroom: this shit is blessed
You couldn't bring it on if it gave you one and gave you its address
I give my boys your address and get your house plundered
Better call Wednesday 4, 'cause your days are numbered
Cut the record like lumber, full tilt boogie
Odds are on Suffa in the battle, ask your bookie

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
So what's your name? Suffa MC on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name Pressure MC on the mic tonight
Say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name? Suffa MC on the mic tonight
Now say word, say what, say it's alright
So what's your name Pressure MC on the mic tonight
Say word, say what, say it's alright
