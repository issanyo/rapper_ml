[Ad-lib: Suffa]
Come on

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Two sheets to the wind in a taxi
Two feet to the wind in the backseat
Two beeps to the car in front of us
Or one of us ending up wrapped round the chassis
Thinking ‘bout these rhymes, and what they gave me
Sounds out this world, but a microphone and
Two turntables saved me
Took me ‘round the world and bought me a home and
I’ve seen all these other crew's bank too
Not knowing all the ways people helped ‘em
Might not ever get a damn thank you
But they’re sure ‘nough gonna get a you’re welcome
Matter fact, I ain’t leaving, I was here first and
I don’t believe them, I was here bursting
Listening to Primo and Chino and Thirstin
And missing out on being there for people in person
'Cause we don’t sleep when we’re working
We don’t bleed when we’re hurting
We wear our heart on our sleeve and I’m certain
That we’ll feel the burden till we call it curtains, you feel me?
Do you feel me?
This that light inside the core that can blind with its force
It’s the writing on the wall; light it up on the porch
It’s nineteen ninety-four, five mic’s in The Source
It’s a mighty; mighty roar from the crowd and of course
It’s this
Do you feel me?

[Chorus]
Went from going through quotes in the liners
To being known from the shows on the fliers
Playing packed rooms, heading to the back room
To cool down my face with some ice from the rider
Looking out to a crowd full of lighters
And the day those lights don’t inspire us
You’ll see me walking out
I’m a ghost, I’m gone

[Verse 2: Pressure]
Two sheets on a surface of water
Loose-leaf writing worthless and torn up
If I could do these words justice
You’d see how much it’s worth that I fought for
Every kid that never got one mention
Every little bit of love or affection
I’m done with pretending the sun is descending
And all good things must come to an ending
'Cause I swore to the day this is
Nothing more than a flawed entertainment biz
And if I walk away with nothing well let me tell you something
That’s fucking more than I came here with
You feel me?
Do you feel me?
And I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t grateful
For my life for my friends and for the faithful
It’s been a ride but there’s been a few times that I’d thought I’d lose sight when the effort was so painful
But rap gave me such inspired dreams
In fact maybe touched my life when things
Got a little crazy and nobody would pay me the ends that plainly justified the means
At last I can see we’ve all been blind
It’s hard to believe that all this time
That I wore my heart on my sleeve for this art and the scene
Gonna be hard when I leave it all behind
You feel me?
Do you feel me?

[Chorus]
Went from going through quotes in the liners
To being known from the shows on the fliers
Playing packed rooms, heading to the back room
To cool down my face with some ice from the rider
Looking out to a crowd full of lighters
And the day those lights don’t inspire us
You’ll see me walking out
I’m a ghost, I’m gone
Went from going through quotes in the liners
To being known from the shows on the fliers
Playing packed rooms, heading to the back room
To cool down my face with some ice from the rider
Looking out to a crowd full of lighters
And the day those lights don’t inspire us
You’ll see me walking out
I’m a ghost, I’m gone

[Bridge: Pressure & Suffa]
Low winter sun, light the dawn in gold
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Though when it’s done night is on us all
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Nowhere to run, writings on the wall
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
So when it come, rise before we fall
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Low winter sun, light the dawn in gold
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Broken and done dying on us all
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
Nowhere to run, writings on the wall
I'm a ghost, I'm gone
So when it comes, rise, rise, before we fall

[Chorus]
Went from going through quotes in the liners
To being known from the shows on the fliers
Playing packed rooms, heading to the back room
To cool down my face with some ice from the rider
Looking out to a crowd full of lighters
And the day those lights don’t inspire us
You’ll see me walking out
I’m a ghost
