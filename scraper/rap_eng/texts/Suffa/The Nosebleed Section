[Intro: Suffa]
For my people in the front
In the nosebleed section

[Verse 1: Suffa]
This is for the heads that's loving the mix
My people in the front, all covered in spit
Batter's in the box, Suffa to pitch
Hilltop Hoods all up in this bitch
And we the funk leaders, punks, you can't beat us
We bump and pump meters, we drunk, you chumps need us
So jump with us, down the front if it’s
Your flavour, come get drunk with us
This life turned out nothing like I had planned
Why not? By now I should’ve had some land
Some money in my hand, 'round about fifty grand
But I got nothing, I write rhymes on the bus
I keep suffering; fuck the lines of the dust
You keep sniffing, that shit is for the punk hoes
This shit is for my bros, my people in the front row

[Chorus: Melanie Safka (Sampled)]
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row

[Verse 2: Suffa]
I got hip-hop taste buds
I wanna hear that bass when I make love
Wanna hear some lyrics when I wake up
Write rhymes to get me through a break up (bitch!)
Rough like whisky straight, no chaser
Went through fifty breaks, no flavour
Till I found this one, and made the
Bass hook with the drum my saviour
This is a comeback, tongue that’s sharp like a thumbtack
It's so tight James is saying, "Give my funk back"
One track, eight track, ADAT, residual noise
Man, fuck that, we clean with the digital toys
I'm the Apache, you're failing to match me
Throw your hands in the air like you're hailing a taxi
And move to the funk flow, you stepping? Are you drunk, bro?
This is for my peeps and the freaks in the front row

[Chorus: Melanie Safka (Sampled)]
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row

[Verse 3: Suffa]
People don’t complain if Suffa’s in here
And you’re in the front row all covered in beer
And club owners don't say, "The place is wrecked, it's your fault"
If the roof is on fire, it's an electrical fault
Man, I bet you all bolt when I bring it live
Like Friday night footy, in my hoody I can hide
I get live on the breaks, son, like Pace One
Lads, if you’re heading to the bar, grab your mates one
Ladies come chill, come rock with me, honey
I got like half a mil' in Monopoly money
There's no stopping me, honey, so you can take my hand
We can lay on the beach and count grains of sand
And take a plane to Japan and drink saké with the mafia
Fly to Libya for some Bacardi with Gaddafi
A dinner date followed by a funk show
We'll rip off our tops and jump around in the front row

[Chorus: Melanie Safka (Sampled)]
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row

[Bridge: Melanie Safka (Sampled)]
Put me here and I'm all yours
Not for the money and it's not for the applause
No, oh no, no, no
(It's for the nosebleed section)

[Chorus: Melanie Safka (Sampled)]
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
You know I looked around for faces I'd know
I fell in love with the people in the front row
