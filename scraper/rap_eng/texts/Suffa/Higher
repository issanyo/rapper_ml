[Verse 1: Pressure]
Life tempo unsustainable
Try memo all my days in full
Time encroach till I can’t escape it all
Or die in the hope of the unobtainable
Drivin' this road's like lucid dreamin'
Sleep through the daytime, fly through the evening
If idol dreaming give life to my demons
Then please don't wake me, I'll die while I'm sleepin'
Man I swore I never been here before
This tour's like a storm, blew me up on the shore
Don't know if I'm coming or going or who's runnin' this show
And whether it's curtains or encore
And everyday I spend in space and dimension
Feelin' like I snap so frayed from the tension
Breaking the connection, chasing my redemption
Looking in the wrong place for perfection
I brought a piece of the road into the peace of our home
You the cornerstone of every bit of peace that I've known
But this fever to roam, I can't leave it alone
It claws at my flesh and it's deep in my bones
The music brought me back to life
But it was you that wore the sacrifice
Lost time, lost sleep, lost point of view
Lost high, lost me, lost all but you

[Chorus: James Chatburn]
If we go higher
Tryna tame the clouds
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Lost in the night the
Only way is down
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Still we go higher
Tryna sate this thirst
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Till we fly into the sun
And fall in flames to Earth
Earth, Earth
Ooo-ooo-oo

[Post-Chorus: James Chatburn]
Higher
Higher
Higher
Ooooh

[Verse 2: Suffa]
She used to say
You make me wanna run to you
I'm so proud of your accomplishments
Looked at me like I had hung the moon
Now she looks at me like I'm blockin' it
Cause when you're deep on a tour, no rest
Not feeling human, like you failed the Turing test
She don't want you to bounce too soon man
I feel like Andy Kaufman, the Man on the Moon, and
When I'm feelin' half-human
I'm still hard to kill like Vents and Rasputin
And when life put the boot in
You gotta hit 'em with the fire, Street Fighter, Hadouken
Twenty-four-seven ride the clouds on a seven-four-seven
Lights out? Damn
I’ve never felt more present than I have right now
Shook to life by the landing gear
Inflight radio playin' Chandelier
Now I'm standin' here with no standing room
Waiting on an old man to grab a bag or two
Then he tipped his hat and asked what I do
I said 'dude this is what I do'
And I'mma be consumed by all this so called fun
I'mma burn up soon tryna touch the sun

[Chorus: James Chatburn]
If we go higher
Tryna tame the clouds
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Lost in the night the
Only way is down
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Still we go higher
Tryna sate this thirst
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Till we fly into the sun
And fall in flames to Earth
Earth, Earth
Ooo-ooo-oo

[Post-Chorus: James Chatburn]
Higher
Higher
Higher
Ooooh
Higher
Higher
Higher
Ooooh

[Chorus 2: James Chatburn]
Higher
High-igh
I-igh!
Oooh
If we go higher
Tryna tame the clouds
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Lost in the night the
Only way is down
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Still we go higher
Tryna sate this thirst
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Till we fly into the sun
And fall in flames to Earth
Earth, Earth

[Post-Chorus/Collision: James Chatburn]
Higher
Higher
Higher
Ooooh
