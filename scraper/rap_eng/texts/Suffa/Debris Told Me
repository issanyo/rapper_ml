[Hosts Commentary: Trials]
We got DJ Madcap breaking it down right now. This next track got left off State of the Art and it's a goddamn tribute to the DJ. Debris wassup!

[Chorus/Scratches: Suffa/DJ Debris]
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
Moving while, we keep it moving while
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
We keep it moving while, we keep it moving

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Man, I been 'round the world representin', where've you been to?
Begin to realise we've been down, we've been true
'Cause hitting the booth, not spittin' 'bout what you've been through's
Like going to the toilet and putting *clears throat* in you
[?] watch you like
You could sell records but it's just that you choose not to (Right)
Well not true, I got something to drop for ya
You're not underground bro, you're just unpopular
'Cause underground's a state of mind, it's a place in your heart
It's when your breaks and your rhymes are fuckin' state of the art
And this is State of the Art, you should've stayed in the yard
"Whinging and moaning aren't ya
You never stop moaning and whinging
And whinging and moaning
Moaning, whinging" princess you're breaking my heart
Meg Ryan, I've never ever seen someone fake it this hard
And I'ma take 'em apart
And set this off, it's like the pube in the urinal
Getting aimed at by a dude in a cubical, man, I'm pissed off

[Chorus/Scratches: Suffa/DJ Debris]
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
Moving while, we keep it moving while
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
We keep it moving while, we keep it moving

[Verse 2: Trials]
Hey sweetie! I'm fuckin' out of this world, believe me
Reaching me means you got a short skirt and weegee
Debris be the keeper of cuts
If your older brother hates the Oars your younger sister [?]
Chump! You fresh? Fuck whatever you said
I still remains to be seen like identifying the dead
It's the mister speaking shit, fucking with Trials
Is like fucking your wife and waking up with a leaky dick
Suspicious, come run with us
Crammed in a car like pretty women and one mirror (jump in)
It ain't like I'm something famous
I'll be lucky if the [?] can remember what my name is
(Who are you?!) They still [?] like I owe somethin'
Fuck 'em [?] my knife's like Ben Cousins'
And I'm done wit 'em, *psst* pigeon
Livin', shittin', I'm pickin' the crumbs Debris give 'em
Set it off, man!

[Chorus/Scratches: Suffa/DJ Debris]
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
He told he set it, 'I set it off'
Debris told me to set it, 'Set it off, man!'
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
Moving while, we keep it moving while
"Set it off, get it off, let it off—Get it"
We keep it moving while, we keep it moving

[Outro: Jay from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]
"The important thing here is a fucking bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the Internet to teenagers and guys who can't even get laid. Putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do."
