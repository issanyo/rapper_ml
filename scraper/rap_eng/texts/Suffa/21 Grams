[Chorus: Thundamentals, Hilltop Hoods & Mataya]
Did you ever believe (yeah)
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me (no-oo)
Got nothing to lose but twenty-one grams (uh-huh)
Just let it all go (oh-ho)
Don’t fuck with your man (ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul’s (yeah-hair)
Just twenty-one grams (ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (oh-ho)
Send love to your fam (ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul’s (yeah-hair)
Just twenty-one grams
It ain’t but twenty-one grams
Ain’t but twenty-one grams
Just twenty-one grams

[Verse 1: Pressure]
One life here to foster, no time here to squander
Grew wiser and stronger, yet still tryna conjure a little ray of sunshine in a Quagmire
For the prize on offer, we divide and we conquer
If I fight any longer I’ma start looking like all my rivals and in time will give rise to a monster
Gotta be more to life than sort of like every morning rise and shine
I wanna see all the lights on tour life then immortalised in time
What’s the weight of a human soul?
Does it change if bruised or old?
Famine or fame, man, it’s all the same
That’s what you stand to gain vs. lose it all

[Verse 2: Jeswon]
All that glitters ain't gold, what's royal is loyalty shown to your fam
What’s the weight of your soul? They say it nothing but twenty-one grams
Slow dance with the devil, he asked for my signature written in blood
I won’t bow to that level, know I can do better in death, hope my spirits arisen above
But yo will I be judged on the good and the bad that I've done in my life?
When I'm writing these songs, I'm righting my wrongs, that’s how it feels with each word I recite
Like I’m earning the right to be making amends, apologies given to all of my friends
If ever I dissed you know that I didn’t mean to offend

[Chorus: Thundamentals, Hilltop Hoods & Mataya]
Did you ever believe (yeah)
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me (no-oo)
Got nothing to lose but twenty-one grams (uh-huh)
Just let it all go (oh-ho)
Don’t fuck with your man (ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul’s (yeah-hair)
Just twenty-one grams (ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (oh-ho)
Send love to your fam (ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul’s (yeah-hair)
Just twenty-one grams
It ain’t but twenty-one grams
Ain’t but twenty-one grams
Just twenty-one grams

[Verse 3: Tuka]
And I can’t help but feel a little blessed like yes, I’ma do it better than the best I can
I’ma get it in with whatever I have like damn by chance
Do you wanna take my hand? Do you wanna dance in the middle of the street like me?
Side step it to the left of the centre ‘cause I’ve never been a fan of that right wing bullshit and negativity
Check it, I don’t mean to preach, this is not an anthem
Tuka’s on a rant let me pen a bit of peace, fuck a hand gun
If your head’s buried in the sand then understand
I’m just tryna get a bit of free in me
Get a bit of free in me
Dive deep sight seeing the earth on cloud 9
Dreaming free as a bird, just try to focus when the scenery blurs

[Verse 4: Suffa]
Bringing life into this world's like
Bringing a grain of sand to the beach, but
Thing is that this little girl's like
Ten point five grams of you and me, love
Everything from our past is passed on
It survives, it’s alive in our daughter
You ever think there's a link when we pass on?
She might have passed on five and a quarter
Immortalised, I thought that I
Had everything I wanted
It all was lies, there's more to life
Couldn't put my finger on it
My daughter’s eyes
I see my parents, see your parents too
Apparent when you stare into her eyes
And she got a pair like you

[Chorus: Thundamentals, Hilltop Hoods & Mataya]
Did you ever believe (yeah)
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me (no-oo)
Got nothing to lose but twenty-one grams (uh-huh)
Just let it all go (oh-ho)
Don’t fuck with your man (ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul’s (yeah-hair)
Just twenty-one grams (ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (oh-ho)
Send love to your fam (ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul’s (yeah-hair)
Just twenty-one grams
It ain’t but twenty-one grams
Ain’t but twenty-one grams
Just twenty-one grams
Just twenty-one grams

[Outro: Thundamentals, Hilltop Hoods & Mataya]
Did you ever believe (yeah)
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me (no-oo)
Got nothing to lose but twenty-one grams
