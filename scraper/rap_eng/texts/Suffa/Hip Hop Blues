[Verse 1: Bliss]
Man I've been around the block and I've seen a lot of faces
Made a lot of friends and drunk a lot of cases oh my
We just take people up, so high, to find faith in the love
Welcome to the old pictured house on the hilltop
Midnight movies screen while my quill jots
A chilled spot, a foreign place just follow the user
His name is Norman Baits and he will seat you in my head
When I'm performing late and you can feel how I miss my girls warm embrace
This is a lonely road I can't ignore the fate cause
Only know I was born to make is hip hop freedom
Until the craving is over in a land of starving MCs and shady promoters
Hey Bliss raps for the country, yeah that's a nifty assumption
Well it is the green and gold yeah the fifties and hundreds
Its like were modern day rap slaves on a crap wage
But in the six pack with ten cats backstage sleeping on floors
Fast food sipping on bupple, economy class pimp bitch piss in a bottle
To read our name on a flyer, yeah I'm a crack the shits I need a magnifying glass
Yo this is backwards bliss like I'm a shit in the shower
And I'm a jump in the shitter, 'cause were the kids with the powers
But the runts of the litter
But now you cunts are just bitter 'cause we must crap gold nuggets
Yo they digging our shit that we made from no budget
But I'm still selling kicks stuffed in a cell cooped up
In them all but I keep tracking though hell for this

Hip hop movement
You there ain't no pit stops through
And it's a colourful world if you adapt to life
But can't feel you're real if it is black and white
Hip hop movement
You there ain't no pit stops through
And it's a colourful world if you adapt to life
But can't feel you're real if it is black and white

[Verse 2: Eso]
Yo yes it Esoterik and Bliss is an intelligent twist of life (it strikes) that fights hell with a kiss
Upper class always looks and gives me shit
'Cause I'm a white kid that bounces on a beat like Jimmy Cliff
Singing this, got me high like music was drug oh shit tell 'em why coz I do this for the love but there's no love
Cash will kill your marriages
You know I'm so chat to chill in chariots
But were broke and can't afford the fast life
So we flow like hover boards in half pipe
I think like I drink: until all the case drunk
In a cold world killing the Bedbugs
They live in a mansion I live in a shed but
When I spit it hits like an intimate head rub
So Grammy's for the gangsters playing the part
One love for my heirs that can savour the art
Cause when I write I rhyme like a day in the park and use
Mother natures rib cage as a harp and look forward to the future
Like Sydney in December and express
An experience like Jimmy on a bender
Avenger whole view of looking at shit
Aee things of fishermen with a hook in your lip
And this is Bliss n Esoterikizm, Suffa and Pressure
You put these motherfuckers together and nothing is fresher

[Verse 3]
It builds bliss when you're round us cause we built this from the ground up and it still hits
Like a town truck with a steal fist that hasn't found love
But when he does he remembers what its like to live in this world as one despite our differences
Change is here and the vision is ours within seconds the pavement was littered with flowers you know the rapping is shady
You know I mean she's so blow and your shits still only close to so, so
Oh no did I just feel the ?? and not conform to whatever the fuck you say hot is?
You're living off old school props, give it up fool you lost
Our spitting will hold you hostage for that gold your rock its bullshit ops meditate
Their Bliss n Esoterikizm fuckers get it straight

Maybe that'll teach his
