[Verse 1: Suffa, Pressure & Summit]
A time that I miss, or was it the time that I missed?
'Cause half the time I was pissed, check the time on your wrist
Sunshine in the crisp morning air of the lamp park
Hanging at barbecues, and other crews who’d never air spark
B-boys, it’s all chill, leave and it’s all chill
That was cool when they greet, broke leaf at the score
Still, school days were cool days, kickin’ the football always
Would be good, we would get detention set in hallways
I used to hate that shit, now I miss the crew from school
When getting pissed was cool and you got dissed if you was a fool
I walked the line to school, when Belair was all peace
Back then I rode with heads, and outran transit police
"Oh shit, the cops," that’s the sound of the pigs
We used to rock, what’s the colour of a true sick beat
(Copper, copper) I pissed off they trying to stop the hilltop
If proper was flopper all the real mates, still ain’t forgot ya
This is not the time or place that it used to be, but you’d agree
That you and me have grew to be the neighbourhood nuisancy
Truancy was regular, these styles were meant for the
Ears of a peer, good times, I’ll remember you
In the mental with a dollar like, we direct and we make
It’s the Hoods baby rocking freestyles at Apex

[Chorus]
On (on) till the early morn’
I keep it on (on) till the break of dawn

[Verse 2: Summit, Suffa & Pressure]
Man, the mouth boxes fly from the house it rocks the fight
Coming from the under south and topside
Strived for summer, with just shorts on ya
Laze in sun rays and the days are longer
Catch a slack from my oldies, till my hat turned back
Grabbed a six pack of coldies, then walk down to Blackwood
Pass the Bourb’ after dark, we try and wind around
It’s okay, the curb and cold park, it’s the time that I miss

"Go inside your heart and find the time that you miss"

[Verse 3: Pressure, Summit & Suffa]
I remember Christmas vacation, hangin’ at the station
Sunny days and money days, and my heart's relaxation
Situation we facing was chasing just one dollar
Too dumb for a school, I thought replacement in relation to intoxication
Conversation with cops led to [?]
I rocked [?] my verse
Settin’ fire to Dacha, then blame the ties and jackets
Better watch it, so let a box get blown by fire crackers
And inspired by Flak is how I got my start
(It’s the hoods mate, rapping freestyles in cold parks)

[Chorus]
On (on) till the early morn’
I keep it on (on) till the break of dawn

[Verse 4: Summit, Suffa & Pressure]
Yeah man, coming off the top, intelligent, with the element
Under the influence of alcohol [?] elephant tenders man
Hell I bet it was a freestyle development
From the settle we invent, to old product
Run up, run and walk, run afar, run amok
Running shit, bring the crews together like Chlamydia
Look down from Windy Point and know we run this fuckin’ city
It’s a pity, bulls aren’t as freaky from the local delinquents
Grab a pipe and a life pass to the right was a sequel
And ignite, day and night where the frequent [?] saying
I aim for the top, just trying to contain my crop
Used to run from our mothers, pretend we were brothers
Score the same hoes but under different covers
Others could not consume as much liquor
As the Blackwood boys, the neighbourhood father figures
Take you back, drink your packs, beer care for your pain
Physically I’ve changed, but mentally I’m still the same
And maintain the memory, remember these days, no strife
Hash would blaze in the nights, some of the best days of my life
So with my memories of Apex, I’ll never be alone
That’s the legacy, so I'ma let Next take it home
