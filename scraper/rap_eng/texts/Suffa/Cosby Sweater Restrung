[Intro: Pressure]
Watch me do my thing, get
Lost into my scene, yeah
Hot like New Orleans in
Cosby crew and jeans, yeah

[Verse 1: Pressure]
They’re not awakened, stare a lot and vacant
Living in conditions of the modern matrix
Only bare arms when I’m proper naked
Only point I made with a bullet was on paper
Ain’t here to fight some dude or fuck around with his spouse
Rather light your mood and burn it down with the house
Get you hyped from the groove on account of the bounce
And looking like Tom Cruise, up and down on a couch
Status never mattered ever, act however
Like Christine Aguilera, just let yourself go
Mad at Pressure, an endeavour that is better left
Pristine track and record to let you all know
That we would be kings even homeless
Building these kingdoms our own, just
Slap a rapper like Solange Knowles
Till they’re gathering, they no longer matter like a black hole

[Pre-Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
(One, two, three, four)
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition, listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 2: Suffa]
I'ma step up every chance when I rumble
They all call me champ of the jungle, it’s fitting
I'ma get drunk and dance like your uncle
'Til I'm all hands like your uncle, I’m kidding
The venomous inventor, when I enter then it's over
When I’m spitting venom I’m as generous as Oprah
You get a scar, you get a scar, you get a scar
Me? Drunk in the back of a rental car
Pat Benatar, brah, love’s a battlefield
Here to get you out your seat like a battle drill
I’m in the saddle still, a little saddle sore
Smash you out the stratosphere, flashy as a matador
When I’m dressed like Theo’s dad
In a Coogi listening to Kool G Rap
I won’t beat around the bush like a seventies porn
I’ll make you wish that you’d never been born and it’s all good

[Pre-Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good
And it's all good

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
(One, two, three, four)
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition, listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater

[Verse 3: Pressure & Suffa]
Take a ride on the wild side of this alley
We can fire up the night like Prince Harry
Fuck the high life, we can vibe like
We got white lines hanging from behind like we’re just married
I’ll turn the art form into a blood sport
And make pea soup out of a pea-brain
They wanna run these streets like parkour?
I’d rather run these tracks like a steam train
(Like a steam train, like a steam train, like a steam train)

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
(One, two, three, four)
I feel like Bobby Fischer
Always four moves ahead of
My competition, listen
They ain’t gonna stop me ever
I feel as large as Biggie
Swear it could not get better
I feel in charge like Biggie
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
Wearing that Cosby Sweater
