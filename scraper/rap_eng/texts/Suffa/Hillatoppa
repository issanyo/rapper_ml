[Verse 1: Pressure]
My words ring true, so until the end of the marriage
Cutting my neck from my back is the only severance package
For this veteran that is blessed and possessed with the language
In a profession that takes less than a second for Pressure to vanish
I scream vocals clear in the hope you're hearing your host
Less we choke in fear of the smoke and the mirrors
This scene is on fire, feeding my bleeding desire
So when P's behind the wheel indeed you'll need to retire
Cause I'm a "Hillatoppa", breath no less than seventy proof
Yeah, we connect with the youth when my left is caressing your tooth
Invested in confessing the truth, the proof, my sweat in the booth
Hang around, this is ending with your neck in a noose
So move back, call truce, retract (move back)
We're too fat to fall through the cracks
And I never had quitting in mind, sick of my rhyme?
Slit your wrist and consider this the finishing line
The finishing line...

[Verse 2: Suffa (Pressure)]
You better swallow your pride like lions eating their young
Cause I'm a beast with a beat, two lungs and a drum
And now that Mister Superflow is back on his feet
I'm going stupid bro so you can go back to your seat
I'm a "Hillatoppa" filled with vodka and vinegar
Mocking you miniatures, more props than Bollywood cinema (last call)
Me and P will be drunk all summer
Jim Carey, Jeff Daniels, call us drunk and dumber
People are starving and they're putting Lamborghini doors on a fucking Hummer?
Give some to the funky drummer
And I'll ride this beat like a drunken lover
With no fucking rubber and I fucking love her
(Bitch!) Girl don't leave me
I need you and see that you don't need me
But if you leave me alone you'll break my heart
I'll fall apart and lose my seat on the throne like an opera

"But you don't want me"
"But you can't have me"
"But you don't want me"
"Leave you down on your knees"
"But you don't want me"
