[Hook: Pegz]
Every show, riders bomb the toilets like a grenade
Every show, emcees get blazed backstage
Every show, honeys sip vodka and lemonade
Every show, we eternally shine while others fade

[Verse 1: Pegz]
Every show I show, I rock, thinkin' I'm gonna get paid
I stagger out the club with nothing but small change
Every show that I rock thinkin' I'm gonna get laid
I get this by the door bitch and barmaid
So every show now to save myself from being played
It's all about rockin' the crowd, havin' a rage
Every show, my bros cheer, jump 'round spillin' beer
Get rowdy, yellin' shit and gettin' spit in my ear
Every show, my flow's tighter than a wealthy cheapskate
So don't ask, Nostradamus couldn't predict my release date
I'm unreliable unless you fam or crew
Or a desirable honey I'm dying to step to
Every show, I forget to do my soundcheck
One time even forgot the beats for my set
Every show, I crack the speakers, blow the tweeters
Overload the boards and short the power meters
Get the non-believers wide open like receivers
Every show, lyrically known as high achievers
Every show's in cohesion of Asian, European
Indian, Middle Eastern, African, Polynesian
All musically [?]
[?] in the art, speaking from heart
Pegasus freezing, keep [?] streetsmart
Every show real heads know soon as the beat start

[Hook: Reason]
Every show, riders bomb the toilets like a grenade
Every show, emcees get blazed backstage
Every show, honeys sip vodka and lemonade
Every show, we eternally shine while others fade

[Verse 2: Pegz &  Jason Shulman]
To every Rocky mosh pits, batter and bruise it
Every rave, hundreds underage drug use
But a hip-hop show that has a few minor blues
We get accused of false shit in bullshit reviews
I refuse to read, listen to the bitchin'
If you can't handle the heat get out the kitchen
And every show, just about anything goes
DJ responsible for beats while I undertake the flows
At every show, sound of feedback, me no need that
[?] words to make my beat fat
Every show approximately at quarter to four
I get twenty calls from me mates to get their name on the door
And every show, regularly, I repeat the word Melbourne
Because I'm passionate, I want the whole crew to feel welcome
Every show and stage, I make my message clear
While some listen, jump around, others kick back, drink beer
Once upon a time every show there was a fight
But these days most are out for a good night
Every show has its movers and shakers
Graffs, DJs, emcees, [?] and breakers

[Hook: Jason Shulman]
Every show, riders bomb the toilets like a grenade
Every show, emcees get blazed backstage
Every show, honeys sip vodka and lemonade
Every show, we eternally shine while others fade

[Hook: Jason Shulman]
Every show, riders bomb the toilets like a grenade
Every show, emcees get blazed backstage
Every show, honeys sip vodka and lemonade
Every show, we eternally shine while others fade
