[Intro]
Come in with what lies inside
Every time I open my eyes
All the things I've found outside
All the ways it can become

[Verse 1]
Yeah
As I break some sort of ceiling I'm willingly [?], but I'm always landin'
Up on my feet like a cat, come purring and whirring
To spin some tops with ya, [?] rockin' ya like a baby
Maybe we could both be saved as we age in the rain
Can you blame us, for decades straining to reach some limits
Push ourselves right in it, one minute to hold ya and I'm
Often in [?] to kick it with ya, hold your hands if you're living
Giving, breathin' and bringin'

[Chorus: [?]]
To find the time to be alone, be alone
Be alone, be alone, be alone
Searching for that place called home, place called home
Place called home, place called home, place called home
To make the journey yourself alone, yeah
Yourself alone, yourself alone
All the while not being home
Not being home, not being home

[Verse 2]
Yeah yeah
At a priest-like house we're groovin' and movin' to fill the room with love
Can't ever get enough, through the good times and bad times
Always looking up to the stars and counting how near or far
We have come, every night, every morning as a breeze blows without warning
We tried to connect this feeling, extended solely to hold some meaning
A place in the seams of the dreams where a dream and a belief in the life that we're leading
A mix of the one that we're given, a mix of the one that we're feelin'
Come on, let's give it all we got, it's all we have, we need it

[Pre-Chorus]
Come in with what lies inside
Every time I open my eyes
All the things I've found outside
All the ways it can become

[Chorus: [?]]
To find the time to be alone, be alone
Be alone, be alone, be alone
Searching for that place called home, place called home
Place called home, place called home, place called home
To make the journey yourself alone, yeah
Yourself alone, yourself alone
All the while not being home
Not being home, not being home

[Verse 3]
To shed some light on the situation too many thoughts in my brain, just sayin'
Breathin' harder like I'm roamin' only to let go, let's hope that
I'm home in a phone call, searching, seeing, seeking, dreaming
Just to breathe it in and breathe it out, now [?] on the ride we go

[Chorus: [?]]
To find the time to be alone, be alone
Be alone, be alone, be alone
Searching for that place called home, place called home
Place called home, place called home, place called home
To make the journey yourself alone, yeah
Yourself alone, yourself alone
All the while not being home
Not being home, not being home
