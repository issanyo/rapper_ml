[Intro]
Woo, put in work
Again and again
Check

[Verse 1]
I been getting mine 'fore I signed my name upon the dotted line
I bodied anybody who bothered to wanna try
You're running on borrowed time, I'm gunnin', I'm on sight
Now my record on your forehead, so I know what's on your mind
From the pessimist nemesis, hate everyone's guts
On our worst day never get the better of us
Your whole squad's Festivus, you worship the pole
It's gotta be told, you thinking about kicking up dust
Or making a fuss? Teeth, you be picking 'em up
Peace, yeah, cuz we [?], ha
Think sensible, bring all your friends with you, they're dispensable
Self-sufficiently, but we don't kill 'em we got vegetables
Can't respect that you better respect respect
Crabs in the bucket tryna grab up on the testicles
Briggs on the bill wreck the whole fucking festival
My ventricles move decibels to move a decimal

[Scratches: [?]]
"Golden—Golden era, [?]
Golden—Golden era, I speak—
"Gold—Golden—Gold—Golden—Gold—Golden—Golden era"
"Now hear this: this era might be the scariest"
"Golden—Golden era, [?]
Go—Golden—Golden era—Golden era—Golden era
Golden—Golden—Golden—Golden era"
"Now hear this: this era might be the scariest"

[Verse 2]
I banish these amateurs, leave 'em bandages quick
[?] badder than your bedroom batting average is
One man army, you bums can't harm me
You're under the thumb, under the bus, under a palm tree
That's where the bad man is, nothin but bad manners
Your words are skin deep just like your bad tan is
Twisting up your panties, popping a couple xannies
[?] get chair wrapped around your head like bandanas
Brain damage, I already did
Famine in my crib, not raising a thing
Did that in my apartment, spent a lot on garments
And drank more milk than a room of dairy farmers
The devilish things the devilish do
Find out, get between a hungry man and his food
There ain't telling his father of the damage he'll do
But I managed to manage a couple bangers for you

[Scratches: [?]]
"Golden—Golden era, [?]
Golden—Golden era, I speak—
"Gold—Golden—Gold—Golden—Gold—Golden—Golden era"
"Now hear this: this era might be the scariest"
"Golden—Golden era, [?]
Go—Golden—Golden era—Golden era—Golden era
Golden—Golden—Golden—Golden era"
"Now hear this: this era might be the scariest"

[Bridge]
You should never speak ill of the dead
But when I'm gone just remember I was iller than them
You should never speak ill of the dead
But when I'm gone just remember I was iller than them

[Scratches: [?]]
"Golden—Golden era, [?]
Golden—Golden era, I speak—
"Gold—Golden—Gold—Golden—Gold—Golden—Golden era"
"Now hear this: this era might be the scariest"
"Golden—Golden era, [?]
Go—Golden—Golden era—Golden era—Golden era
Golden—Golden—Golden—Golden era"
"Now hear this: this era might be the scariest"
