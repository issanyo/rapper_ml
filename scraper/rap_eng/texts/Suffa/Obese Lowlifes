[Verse 1: Mystro]
Well I'm the one to bring the funk although my armpit's not stinking
And I'm known to hold flows like the glass you drop drinking
Never crawled man I started off limping
Plus I rock a fella like I know the art of parking lot pimping yeah
You people know of Mys, the one whose flow's crazy
And is so gravy that it should come with a bowl of rice
The NBS with the Hilltop Hoods
Make B-Boys and Girls break quicker than real soft wood, let's go

[Verse 2: Pressure]
I never hit on a girl, at least with no hand
Girls are like serving time but time waits on no man
Got nothing on women so I spread love on the rhythm
And get you out your seat quicker than corrupt politicians
And I'm on the brink, man it makes me stop and think
I don't drink till I drop cos I think I might drop my drink
Think you're more, than us? We believe in war
Trust me your nothing I ain't seen before

[Hook: Sample (Mystro) [Pressure] {Suffa} *Braintax*]
Deep into the music and his art man (Mystro)
Deep into the music and his art man, his true love
Deep into the music and his art man, his true love
(Hilltop Hoods) [we're so tired] {Obese} *Lowlifes*

[Verse 3: Braintax]
With one pen too high to overextend
In dreamland with freedom starting again
With foresight thrive on the magic of life
And five fingers plus a mic make sick shit, Braintax
Fuck Tony Blair like I hate George Bush
Another seven day week, you ready for the push?
Through the eight million stories that you can't write down
Start again from the top, come on people bounce

[Verse 4: Suffa]
Man all these pollies in power are cowards so it's only fair
That I hate John Howard like I hate Tony Blair
And I croon like Tony Bennet in a rental tux
Experimental cuts, with the Brando Flux and Mys Diggy
No one's as fly as these kings
I'll leave you beside yourself like Siamese twins
We're so deep, so nice, so full of promise
But obese, lowlifes man what woman would want us?
We're like some hooded up bombers out storming the yard
We're going large like a junkie out pawning his car
This is the core of the art, and it's all from the heart
This music put your life together when it's falling apart

[Hook: Sample (Mystro) [Pressure] {Suffa} *Braintax*]
Deep into the music and his art man (Mystro)
Deep into the music and his art man, his true love
Deep into the music and his art man, his true love
(Hilltop Hoods) [we're so tired] {Obese} *Lowlifes*
