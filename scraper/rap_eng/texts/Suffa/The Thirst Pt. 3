[Intro: Suffa]
What up Vents?
Funkoars
Adfu
What up Briggs?
Golden Era, check

[Verse: Suffa]
We were gone so long, spreading our wings, they'd thought we'd broken up
Thought I only closed my eyes for a second, next thing I've woken up
They said we thought we'd let you sleep in, you looked at peace and
I was like you should have spoken up
All this time trying to sober up
Swore a crowd not a Crown would be the next thing I opened up
Saw I was so corrupt, I wasn't coping but
Seeing friends going down, had me choking up
Plus a drunk nearly killed Debris in a car that crashed
Left us a DJ who had to start from scratch
So I arched my back, stretched my shoulders
Said let's shed this wretched coldness
Drink from the sun and swallow the heat
Just to spit it out, and have 'em follow the beat
What we gotta give this crowd's something of another class
March till the sun is down and we're walking under stars

[Outro: DJ Debris]
"They were recording enough music for two albums, that was premeditated
They, they weren't just like, 'let's make a record and we'll pick the best ten or twelve songs'
It was from day one, 'we're making two albums'"
