[Chorus: Realizm & K21]
Life's too short, our eyes never close
You just never know, you just never know
No time for this thing called sleep
In a suffering city you can't catch a wink
Life's too short, our eyes never close
You just never know, you just never know
No time for this thing called sleep
In a suffering city you can't catch a wink

[Verse 1: Realizm]
Pennywise is back, so watch where you step
Every dream that I had got lost in my bed
Inception [?] it's on to the next
Think you figured me out? You got rocks in your head
The clock intercepts a free range destiny
Circled by the weak like a shark in a frenzy
Don't judge me man, the walls are thin
And you ain't seen shit but my dorsal fin
I've pulled the pin, destroy and rebuild
The coldhearted artist avoiding the chill still
Climbing the mountain with Northface protection
Losing my grip but my claws stay invested
Not one to be labelled as a villain in here (here)
I'm on the rooftop with the wind in my ear (ear)
Screaming at the heaven's, "Where's the sun gone?"
And I never sleep 'cause my brain never shuts off

[Chorus: Realizm & K21]
Life's too short, our eyes never close
You just never know, you just never know
No time for this thing called sleep
In a suffering city you can't catch a wink
Life's too short, our eyes never close
You just never know, you just never know
No time for this thing called sleep
In a suffering city you can't catch a wink

[Verse 2: K21]
[?] manufacture, consider it an opus, I'm Mr Holland
Pick up problems and I'll [?] sink to bottom
'Cause hit or doge 'em I'll be guaranteed to finish on 'em
I see the ghost crawlin' on out of my splintered coffin
With the world on my shoulders I hear the city sobbin'
I told him, "No guarantees when everything is rotten"
[?] and the fiction [?]
What you get on the factory belt feelin' old an'
[?] whether the weather stay cold
The future's so distorted, it's never a day old
I was never Hero pretendin' to save souls
With a secret never kept, whoever is [?]
My picture of a thousand words I write on my own
So colour me King Crimson every time I'm alone
But to be honest I'm just glad that I'm alive at most
And that's why I don't sleepwalk, 'cause my eyes never close

[Chorus: Realizm & K21]
Life's too short, our eyes never close
You just never know, you just never know
No time for this thing called sleep
In a suffering city you can't catch a wink
Life's too short, our eyes never close
You just never know, you just never know
No time for this thing called sleep
In a suffering city you can't catch a wink

[Outro (Sampled): [?]]
"For the last three years I've been on these fuckin' streets, B. [?] out here, I'm out here, you know what I mean? Got a cold right now. I get fed up with—with a lot of you people [?] you know what I mean? So I j—I just say "Fuck it" and I stay outside.
