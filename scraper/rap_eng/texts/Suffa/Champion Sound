[Hook]
The champion sound
They call this the champion sound
You're now listening to the champion sound
Turn it up, it's the champion sound

[Verse 1 Tongue]
Now I be here to uplift, because these words are a gift
My city said they the realest, really I gave them my best
It's for a new generation of leaders and champions, yes
Call it a boast and a toast to your future success
I see you overtime hustling, juggling hecs
Tryna make ends meet, feeling like nothing connects
They say there's a beauty in the struggle
But it's ugly in the flesh
You're much more than a number on a government check
So stand tall little brother, I ain't done with you yet
See I perceive a higher calling you may come to accept
Because you 10 times harder than your hardest day best
That you're a dozen times smarter than the mark on your test
Forget those that wanna doubt you sis you are about to be
More than your accountant said that you could amount to
Dream big like Notorious, tear walls down around you
The moment of clarity has finally found you

[Hook] [Cuts by DJ Morgs]

[Verse 2 Suffa]
You are now tuned in to the sounds of the champion
Sitting on the grounds of the pantheon, champion
Giving you a sampling of rhythms that we sampling
Taking words to live by, singing a new anthem
Taking on the big guys, similar to Samson
Similar to cinema, less like music
The more I hear you spitting, I less like music
But I'm blessed by music so never would I
Consider myself a cynical or bitter guy
Only 5 minutes by my watch into my 15 minutes of fame
And when I drop my 16, Citizen Kane
The greatest of all time voted, spitting them flames
It's a way to get small minds open, so just ride with me
I got a herd of elefants riding me
And we'll be heard through tenements
Fly through streets, howl like Afghan hounds
Champion sound
