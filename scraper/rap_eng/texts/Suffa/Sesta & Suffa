[Verse 1: Sesta]
Yeah, I can't understand him
Never underestimate my overreaction
Take flight [?] but no way I can land it
I don't wanna [?], I want the atlantic
Yeah, overdo it, granted
Foot chasing my neighbour with a bandsaw for taking my bandwidth
It's about to get a little [?]
I can't stand rappin' here, most of it's [?]
Pitiful, [?] self-critical
Drinking, starting a war unwinnable
I never drop a filler in my life, that's typical
It's more than immortal: unfuckwitable
The troupe is here, time is up
So let the music decide who sucks so we can tie 'em up
[?] line 'em up and let's go

[Scratches: [?]]
"Yo," "Pay attention"
"This—This—This is how we roll"
"Please re—Please re—Please remember this"
"Ga—Game's over now"

[Verse 2: Suffa]
I'll serve your ass like Ivan Lendl
And guide the pencil [?]
It's life from the Wildstyle [?]
[?] get through
[?] man, I'll offend you
When I commence to write instrumentals
Fired up, but fire inside the temple
When the PI identify by the dental
Records step forth, bite and wrestle
The fight to end all fights, the mental
Treatin' Ms Honey like nice and gentle
But treat this body like mine's a rental
[?] and feather the hardened predator
The heart of the art and their are no better to
Carve a letter [?] competitors
[?] forever, I'm the one

[Commentary: Maundz]
Yeah, yeah, guten Tag. This is Maundz, but you can call me fuckin' [?] for short. This the Golden Era Mixtape 2011. The boy's are fuckin' back in town, shuttin' shitheads down. How it is?
