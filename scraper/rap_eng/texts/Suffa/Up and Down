[Intro/Skit: Cookie Monster & Herry Monster]
HERRY MONSTER: You dropped your cookie and you're looking up in the sky for it?
COOKIE MONSTER: That's right!
HERRY: Don't you know the difference between up and down?
COOKIE: Oh sure!
HERRY: I don't think you do
COOKIE: No?
HERRY: But I know something that might help you. I know a song all about up and down
COOKIE: You do?
HERRY: Yes I do
COOKIE: Well, so do I!
HERRY: You do?
COOKIE: Uh-huh!
HERRY: Well then what are we waiting for?! Let's have some music!
COOKIE: Music!

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Now this is for you people that are in-between
You like hip-hop but you have never liked the scene
Or you like a scene but you just hate the hip-hop
Or you like hip-hop but you would rather hard rock
Now what you gotta do with me is listen close
What we ain't gonna do here tonight is sit and boast
Suffa MC and the Pressure gonna bless your minds
If you're feelin' that it's fresh you're gonna press rewind
If underground is something that you never heard
I'm gonna break it down for you in several words
Pure, deep, and simple, but you know it's more than that
So cruisin' by like it's just [?]
Now Hilltop's hip-hop that is known as pedigree
Ain't no one in a cypher that can better me
If you don't see Hilltop as pure underground
Then can you tell the difference between up and down?

[Chorus: Suffa]
Do you know the difference between up and down?
Do you know what's pop? What's underground?
The question makes you wonder now:
'What's the difference of words? What's the difference in sound?'
Do you know the difference between up and down?
Do you know what's pop? What's underground?
The question makes you wonder now:
'What's the difference of words? What's the difference in sound?'

[Interlude/Skit: Cookie Monster & Herry Monster]
HERRY MONSTER: You dropped your cookie and you're looking up in the sky for it?
COOKIE MONSTER: That's right!
HERRY: Don't you know the difference between up and down?
COOKIE: Oh sure!
HERRY: I don't think you do
COOKIE: No?
HERRY: But I know something that might help you. I know a song all about up and down
COOKIE: You do?
HERRY: Yes I do
COOKIE: Well, so do I!
HERRY: You do?
COOKIE: Uh-huh!
HERRY: Well then what are we waiting for?! Let's have some music!
COOKIE: Music!

[Verse 2: Suffa]
We love music from [?] to Jimi Hendrix
We love music A to Z in the appendix
But the music that's the source of fascination's
Underground hip-hop the classification
Won't be found in your modern (music) literature
Wouldn't be underground (music) if it were
As it were, we keep it hidden so the masses can't abuse it
Our culture, our religion, our life, hip-hop (music)

[Chorus: Suffa]
Do you know the difference between up and down?
Do you know what's pop? What's underground?
The question makes you wonder now:
'What's the difference of words? What's the difference in sound?'
Do you know the difference between up and down?
Do you know what's pop? What's underground?
The question makes you wonder now:
'What's the difference of words? What's the difference in sound?'
