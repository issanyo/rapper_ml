[Intro: [?]]
All right, all right, shut the fuck up. [?] and now we got the Hilltop Hoods [?] and you're gonna be feelin' the vibe

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Don't stop or hesitate, lyrical blows that make you levitate
Rappers think they're fat, damn, they're fucking featherweight
For heavens sake, I never crossed over ever, mate
I regularly elevate while other men regulate, I never make
Statements that I can't back with hella weight
MC's selling their soul while record companies selling fakes
Like [?] they sleepin' while I'm well awake
I celebrate while they feel the rain the weather make
Some will await the album drop, but they never make it
They tellin' me to prepare for the venom when they smell a snake
There's a thousand stories in the city that are hella fake
Can never wait for mine or waste time dwelling fate
Together mate all we need is to delegate
Some mind power so that our thoughts can generate
And segregate the real from the fellas fakers
It's time for b-boys to get yours together, mate

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
I elevate, you elevate, we elevate
Pressure MC rock the acapella break
I elevate, you elevate, we elevate
Suffa MC rock the acapella break
I elevate, you elevate, we elevate
Pressure MC rock the acapella break
I elevate, you elevate, we elevate
Suffa MC rock the acapella break

[Scratches: [?]]

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Ah
B-boy verbally littering, configuring
Lettering, sampling, veterans delivering
Words on the world that I'm livin' in
Unforgivin' in my style, no considerin' givin' in
Accelerate, don't deviate, aggravate
Featherweights, who better wait, never hesitate
Get this right, elevate till you levitate
Demonstrate skills that the hills will celebrate
Impersonators situate styles that you emulate
Lacerate foes with the flows that I punctuate
Intimidate, interlay, how was I stimulated?
Cowards imitate my style, try assimilate
Beginner make noise, b-boys digging in the crate
Innovate then *imitates scratching* till your finger break
Integrate sounds underground, I'm Bomberman
Nominate the Hoods for the crew to dominate

[Chorus: Pressure & Suffa]
I elevate, you elevate, we elevate
Pressure MC rock the acapella break
I elevate, you elevate, we elevate
Suffa MC rock the acapella break
I elevate, you elevate, we elevate
Pressure MC rock the acapella break
I elevate, you elevate, we elevate
Suffa MC rock the acapella break
