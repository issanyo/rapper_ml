[Hook: Suffa]
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
And we say hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
Hey now
Hey, hey, hey now

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Check, I'm either in or out
Ain't got time to sit around, trying to find a middle ground
I gotta live and not exist
Problem is there's not a gift offered if there wasn't risk
I went from poor to invested and stressed on tour
Wrestling the lessons, these questions bore
If I can't feel it right now, what's the effort for?
Don't wanna build a lighthouse on an empty shore
See I can shoot the breeze, but can't do it for free
Cause who are we if I don't make this fucking music for me?
And it ain't about the fame or 'bout recouping a fee
But either way, that's time away from the two kids I feed
Caught in between, any day your fortune can swing
And you don't wanna be a jester in a court full of kings
We set our own pace to the race we're running in
And celebrate what we put out, not what's coming in

[Hook: Suffa]
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
And we say hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
Hey now
Hey, hey, hey now

[Verse 2: Suffa]
I lay down my bars in the bars where I lay down
Till I’m barred by the barmaid, hey, I stay ‘round
A barfly, barhoppin' bars like a playground
Debris's like a barber, he cuts in the fade out
Hey now
We had plans and breakdowns laid out
But Lennon said it better than Suffa ever can
"Life's what happens when you're busy making other plans"
Pushed back plans like Jesse Pinkman's hairline
The way some reacted, that caught me unprepared, I
Had friends throw darts, fuck crew like that
Man they broke my heart, but through my back
But success is the best revenge so I guess
That I've had a lot of vengeance then, yo, I'm blessed
And apologising for being so fresh
Is like Napoleon writing "Excuse my French"
And a tiger don't apologise for being tiger
A Kaiser don't apologise to a miser
Man I'ma wear the night sky like a cape
And add a jewel to my crown every time that you hate
So hate on, little man, hate on
Cause they raze every stage they on
Until they say my name in all capital cities
And they spell my name in all capitals, please rap it all with me, it goes...

[Hook: Suffa]
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
Till the dawn is slung from the morning sun
I'ma crawl through these streets
I'ma walk under stars, fall in and out of bars
Till I fall to my knees
And we say hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
Hey now
Hey, hey, hey now
