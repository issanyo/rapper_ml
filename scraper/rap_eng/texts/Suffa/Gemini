"I'm a-I'm-I'm a...
"I'm a-I'm-I'm a...
"I'm a-I'm-I'm a...
"I'm acting two faced, like the signs of Gemini"

[Hook: Suffa & Pressure]
Two faced, I'm the friendly face and I'm the guilty smile
I'll give you props to your front and, when your back's turned, I'll
Stab it, the saddest thing's so you'll never know when or why
I can't be your friend so I must be Gemini
Two faced, I'm the friendly face and I'm the guilty smile
I'll give you props to your front and, when your back's turned, I'll
Stab it, the saddest thing's so you'll never know when or why
I can't be your friend so I must be Gemini

[Verse: Pressure & Suffa]
What's up? I'm your man, what's that I heard you say?
You're phat with the world play, I got your back like your vertabrae
I got your back, so see if this knife in your spine fits
'Cause I'm sick of this [?] man, it gives me the shits
Like laxatives What's that? I'm sweet, yeah I'm a friendly face
I turn the other cheek, I know it's weak, but we can then be mates
Turn the other cheek, I'll slap it, turn your back on me, I'll stab it
Have you heard about Pressure, man? I heard he's got a habit
I shoot up mics like needles, but a smack rat that ain't me
I've always been clean, I couldn't dream why you'd hate me
Yeah, but lately I've noticed you've been chilling with smackrats
He's on the gear, that's fact, check his arm for tracks
Yo, it's whack that rumours come between us, so what's on your mind?
I know you're fond of mine, 'cause we been friends too long a time
For this to happen, ha, though I was clapping, I diss your rapping
It didn't have to end up like this, but that'll happen
This show is slamming, Suffa, damn man, you getting ill on the downlow
You sound so phat but I ain't sweating, chill
Sweating me? Don't ever think that you can threaten me
I'll pretend to be your friend but you'll find out my weaponry
Is a knife in your back? So why's it gotta be like that?
"This beef shit is so wack"
And now I hear you're dissing me man, you're here now let it fly
Nah you can trust me, I'm your best friend Gemini
