[Intro]
The next train to Adelaide will depart from platform one. Stopping all stations

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Early morn, train station, aching from the arthritis
This war veteran knows what a hard time is
He needs his pension, dementia and half blind is
The reason he rides the train with no car license
So he boards with an expired ticket, has a swipe
Gets a fine 'cause the change he got don't add up right
We're talking about a man who never lived a lavish life
Caught up in the age of computer chips and satellites
A lovely lady boards looking tired and half awake
He smiles, she's reminds him of his wife that passed away
She says something as she walks right past his way
His old hearing aid don't last quite half the day
Some young gentlemen alive with their laughter
Approach the old timer and put a knife to his heart to
Explain that money or blood's the price of their barter
To a man whose friends probably died for their fathers

[Scratches: DJ Debris]
"Taking a train, taking a train" "I—I—
I head toward the train—tra—train station"
"Riding the caboose to hell" "W—W—
We're from a city heroin loves, the devil's in charge"

[Chorus: Pressure]
Whatever it takes can justify
Whatever ends we make, whatever the price
To the end of a life, it's just an observation
So take a ride, we're stopping all stations

[Verse 2: Pressure]
It's been a long night, the sun's lifting on a cold
Morning but she's drugged and drunk, tripping on her stroll
On the way home, she's done with stripping on a pole
But she can't pay for her son, living on the dole
Jumps a train, puts on her gloves, she's wearing black
Being watched by some old mug, she's glaring back
She's on edge and got the bug from sharing smack
So she says, "Hey, what the fuck you staring at?"
He smiles, an unsteady hand rubs on his dome
She takes a seat, a messy band of ruffs board alone
To the digger with a machete at his lungs and he's prone
He can barely stand but ready to stand up for his own
She tries to help him, she doesn't choose to flee the car
And catches a blow with enough bruise to leave a scar
She starts fainting, the room's moving and seeing stars
Ain't it amazing how courageous human beings are?

[Scratches: DJ Debris]
"Taking a train, taking a train"
"Toward the train—tra—train—train station"
"Riding the caboose to hell" "W—W—
We're from a city heroin loves, the devil's in charge"

[Chorus: Pressure]
Whatever it takes can justify
Whatever ends we make, whatever the price
To the end of a life, it's just an observation
So take a ride, we're stopping all stations

[Verse 3: Pressure]
He knows nothing but toil, strife and hard yakka
Pissed at the world for playing wife in a slammer
This man was never given a life or damn platter
So he jumps a train with knife and bandanna
Boys at his back, sleazy, hardened and far
From giving a fuck, an easy target his mark
Sees an old man and says "See we part with your hard
Earned cash or rest in peace, we can start with your heart"
Some girl steps, not afraid she's gonna cop it sweet
And gets decked before she made it even on her feet
The old man leapt to her aid and to his horror he's
Thrusted his chest into the blade of his robber's piece
He grabbed the wallet, dropped the knife as he fled the car
Concerned about the loss of life he'd never went this far
What's done is done, he'd got the prize and he'd spent his half
Of two dollars in change and a pension card

[Outro: Pressure]
So take a ride, cause we stoppin' all stations
