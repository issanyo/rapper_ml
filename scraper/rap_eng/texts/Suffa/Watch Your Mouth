[Intro: Mystro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah what up hip hoppers? (All right let's do that again, sorry)
Yeah yeah yeah what's up party people (Nah) (Come on man!)
Yeah yeah what's up this is Mighty Mystro
The natural born spitter outta UK (Yeah motherfuckers)
UK and OZ connect
This is to all you half arse MCs out there (Take this)

[Verse 1: Mystro]
For the chances of beating me for any coward are slim
'Cause I got the power to finish any clown in the ring
See I'll mark you for death and leave you with scars from your chest
To your legs and sever your head off with the largest machete
Then after I start and the ref shatter some glass on his head
And I'll grasp his neck till he's partially dead and he's starving for a breath
But I'm a devious man, the hardest to stop
Rappers claim to be harder than rock and I beat them to sand
And if you beef with this man I'll probably tie your feet to a van
And drive you through the streets of your land
Not messing with me fool, I'll take you to the steeple of a cathedral
And tie you to the peak with your hands and leave you to hang
So don't come around here talking all that jazz
When your crew ain't got as much juice as my ball bags have
Don't ever let me see you sport that badge
Or I'll leave your face with more footprints than my granny's door mat has

[Turntablism: DJ Izm]
"Mystro, Bliss N Eso" "Dropping shit"
"To these amateur rappers that think they need approvement"
"Y'all MC's talk shit, but I don't give a fuck"
"Somebody put something in his mouth my zipper's stuck"
"I keep it hardcore without a girl on my waist"
"[?]"
"Bitch run his mouth, it's just a storm in a teacup"
"Somebody put something in his mouth my zipper's stuck"

[Verse 2: Bliss]
When the chances of beating me for any coward is slim
'Cause I got the power to finish any clown in the ring
This is a spit battle, you rappers talk shit like piss louts
Constipated rookies mad they ain't got shit out
I gallop at midnight through the darkest valleys
And keep heads rollin' in the city’s hardest alleys
I’m on a bigger bender than [?] Deltora when cop chases
After robbin' Danny Ocean for what he got in Los Vegas
I'm the lost pages of a lonely tale
Fuck beers, I chill with Indy, sippin' the Holy Grail
Man, I'm past the lemon grove, I'm past the light house
I'm past the steppin' stones; I'm past your wife's spouse
I'm the dreamer in the clouds, throwing lightning with Zeus
Striking at you spitting fire and igniting the booth
Emcees say they on the rise but then scream it's not fair
'Cause I burst their bubble and show the world its hot air
Shaking the populous round, breakin' monotonous sounds
Takin' the opulent crowd, thinkin' of chopping them down
They can't be stopping us now, down a beer, we out of here
(Mystro, Bliss 'n Eso) To the eardrum loud and clear

[Turntablism: DJ Izm]
"Who's fucking with me?" "Dropping shit
"To these amateur rappers that think they need approvement"
"Y'all MC's talk shit, but I don't give a fuck"
"Somebody put something in his mouth my zipper's stuck"
"I keep it hardcore without a girl on my waist"
"[?]"
"Bitch run his mouth, it's just a storm in a teacup"
"Somebody put something in his mouth my zipper's stuck" (Who's fucked up now?)

[Verse 3: Eso]
When the chances of beating me for any coward is slim
'Cause I got the power to finish any clown in the ring
It's the flowers in the pavement that led you to the harvest
And crept through then left you webbed between the armpits
That’s why these rappers don’t think
They lay in bed and they sulk
While I go the government like the Incredible Hulk
With insight that these hoes are brainless
Because even Tarzan doesn’t know where Jane is
She’s at my house, tryna get lifted
Cryin' her eyes out 'cause her life is her business
I said that most of these guys now have their eyes on a ribbon
So I'm hoping you fly now and remind me of living
Because I live in the jungle where the buildings are bamboo
The kids are in huddles and we chill on the sand dunes
Like Mad Max, but the sad fact
Is that's my actual name, I shouldn’t have to explain why
My shit's a pool stick in the devil's eye-socket
And I flip lids of school kids whenever I rock it
Get it? I got it, my raps hit your dome with knowledge
And my life's a rifle at the cracked window of a cottage
