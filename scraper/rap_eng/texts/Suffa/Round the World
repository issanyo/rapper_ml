[Intro: Suffa]
Hilltop, Lowrider
Like this, come on, uh

[Verse 1: Joseph Braithwaite (Suffa)]
Oh, what to doing in that cage?
Why do you just sit down and behave?
It’s your choice now, go escape
'Cause you’re headin’ for muddy waters
(Check, come on, come on)

[Chorus: Joseph Braithwaite]
Round the world we go
Oh darling, lift your head
Round the world we go
Ooh, we’ll try to catch the stars
Round the world we go
Oh darling, lift your head
Round the world we go
Ooh, you’ll be forever in debt to her
Round the world we go

[Verse 2: Joseph Braithwaite (Suffa)]
Oh, come with me and join the race
I'll do what I know, you do the same
Don’t be scared now, it's okay
Just keep your eye on, the sky and higher
(Uh, uh)

[Chorus: Joseph Braithwaite (Suffa)]
Round the world we go
Oh darling, lift your head
Round the world we go
Ooh, we’ll try to catch the stars
Round the world we go
Oh darling, lift your head
Round the world we go
Ooh, you’ll be forever in debt to her (Check, Hilltop)
Round the world we go

[Verse 3: Suffa]
We treat our future like a notepad, scribblin’ ideas
Till we build our castles and fill ‘em with IKEA
Be aware of what the truth is
We stitch suits from our problems and wear them as excuses
She was sposed to dress from her suitcase
Ran around the world and every day wear a new face
But she locked her dreams in her drawer, in her office
When she should have walked her dreams out the door of her office
Ride the breeze, stitch capes from clouds
Saw her dreams are out in front of her and chased 'em down
And escaping now, she found fear in it
But ain't nothin’ you could miss more than something never experienced
We wait on hold, and stand in line
Try to throw down the years by hangin’ from the hands of time
But can’t wind it back
Now there’s some food for thought, why don’t you dine on that
Why don’t you dine on that (Dine on that)
Why don’t you dine on that
On that, that, that that that…

[Chorus: Joseph Braithwaite (Suffa)]
Round the world we go (Hilltop)
Oh darling, lift your head
Round the world we go (Suffa MC)
Ooh, we’ll try to catch the stars
Round the world we go (Lowrider, uh)
Oh darling, lift your head
Round the world we go
Ooh, you’ll be forever in debt to her (Check, check)
Round the world we go
