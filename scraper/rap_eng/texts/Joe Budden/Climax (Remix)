[Intro: Joe Budden]
I had to do this one...

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Look, everything was designer
Chanel bag, you deserved that
You came through in the clutch
But then it became about a new clutch
Added 2 Chainz, you didn't give two fucks or
Did I not have time since I blew up?
Maybe you desired more and grew up
Was no longer satisfied with a few bucks
Now you much more concerned with your future
Now your friends that was cool with me
See em' out, they don't want shit to do with me
So who's privy?
When you fly with paper watch theï»¿ whole thing get too sticky
'Cause I see you on blogs now, I gotta wear that
'Cause the shoe fits me
How I lost my mind but you look fine
Baby girl sure does move quickly
At times I think we could start over
Re-do both our parts over
Re-do both our parts sober
My hand be your heart's coaster
But she say, 'fore she ever give, me and her a shot to try and work again
That I almost gotta guarantee
That I promise you'll never be hurt again
But one minute here then it's one gone
Throwbacks like herringbone, now
Now you letting Terry bone
Look, please don't ever compare me to homes
Hopefully this'll be the last time
But it's definitely not the first
Been learned when you hold em' up too high
It'll just make the drop worse

[Hook: Usher]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached our climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to
Run away
Do we separate?
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 2: Usher]
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made our mess, what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all
At all

[Hook]

[Bridge: Usher]
You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

[Hook]
