[Talking Intro]
You look familiar
I swear I seen you some where before, are you sure
Are you sure we never met ?
Naw I'm not using it for some cheap pick up line
I really think you look familiar

[Hook]
Look she be calling my name
Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain
Niggas tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain
It seems a little strange but she be calling my name
Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain
Niggas tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain
It seems a little strange but she be calling my

[Verse 1]
She don't gotta a name, so for now lets call her Ashley
Had her gym clothes on, seen her when she passed me
Met her up in Exxon, body was the nicest
Cursing up a storm, she complaining 'bout the prices
She just left Toronto for Jerz, bought a condo
Know everything about her though we never had a convo
Pops wasn't around much, her mother raised her
Got so much in common that I don't like to face her
Her parents is dope heads, she dropped out of school too
Got the same tats at me and I found that unusual
Mad I smoke cigs stay they're bad for my own health
Said I'll never love me 'cause I don't love my own self
Gave me the ass the first night and I gladly tossed it
The best part was I didn't even have to ask for it
Her period don't ever come
And when I dick her down she always run

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She like to scream so the neighbors might hear her
For some reason like it in front of the mirror
Let me make it clearer, she be making strange request
And I ain't talking bout just pulling on her hair
She be saying choke me like I lost all respect
And every time I do marks show up on my neck
She say punch her, smack her like I'm an attacker
I say "you a fool", I say "just do what I asked ya"
I be going slow until she tell me do it faster
Every time I'm out with her these nigga just harass her
I don't understand it, she so unattractive
Shorty looking terrible plus she come with baggage
I'd tap it, though she below my average, it deceives me
She be talking marriage, saying she'll never leave me
I say I'm gonna bounce but I say I don't believe me
She fucks me every time she sees me

[Verse 3]
I be wanting to strangle her, throw her off the balcony, dangle her mangle her, how long have I carried this anger for?
How come when we argue, we gotta get physical
We crucial conflict, she ends up in critical
Habitual, happens daily, it's our ritual
But show your face bitch stop being invisible
Is it just my mental? Is she just a symbol?
There for me to look at everything that I resemble
Sometimes during sex I blurt another name
Do that mean I look at me and be ashamed
I'm cheating on me with a hottie, with a body
Who so happen to embody everything I so happen to not be
I be trying to leave her but then I get lenient
And since I'm in this room alone, she become convenient
Then we lie together, cry together
I swear I hope we die together

[Hook]
She be calling my name
Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain
Niggas tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain

[Verse 4]
I finally grew the balls to tell shorty we should separate
Save your breath, nothing you can do to make me hesitate
There's no room for me and you to grow
Don't love me and leave me alone, do both
Then she apologize for anything that she did
Said without me she can't think of no reason to live
Said she'll miss getting piped down, the she picked up a shank
I had to tell the crazy bitch to put the knife down
Crying, eye shadow on her face, Filthy
"feel me, if you kill you, it's gonna kill me"
Really, she said "you neglect me", I said "we the same
So whatever you do is gone affect me"
You know I can't let it be
So if we got to stay together just to coexist then so it is
She said "I love you" then hugged me
Took her pants off and proceeded to fuck me

[Hook]

Screaming real loud I would think she's in pain

Niggas tried to tell me her head was insane
Everything she do it takes a toll on my brain
It seems a little strange but she be calling my
