Everybody's a killer but everybody's alive
When shots pop off everybody won't survive
Its obvious who will prevail if we collide
So I ain't beefin with Ran, he's beefin with his pride
Killin him inside, wanna box then I son him
Six years on mixtapes and Koch dont want him
Say your fingers on a trigga nigga pull it then
Instead of beggin for bread on these myspace bulletins
Whoa, might put him with the fishes and the lobsters
You online talkin to my bitches' imposters
Talkin' bout my baby moms and son won't help
This brother need a beatin, Im takin off my belt
Call the king a sidekick, thats suicide with the quickness
Gotta kill my own dog, thats Mike Vick shit
Your girl home sufferin from light sickness
Cause you couldn't take care of your daughter like Wick did
I love Hitch flow, think it compliments yours
Now, only yes men compliment yours
When you was A-team, they said you was trash dookie
Take it from your own squad nigga, ask Pookie
I'm looking at Randy like he a act movie
Some JC heads might wanna lash and do me
But shit was outta order when I came across the border
As a foreigner and hit the homerun like Matsui
This is pointless beef for the retarded kids
The nigga can't even tell you why he started the shit
I mean he can't make a record
The tapes comin out that nobody care about, you can't see that he desperate
The fans can easily solve my shit
If yall cop his tape, maybe he'll hop off my dick
Wanna be hard so bad, no identity left
So he run around committing identity theft
See the kid is confused
The nigga used to work at Home Depot, maybe thats why he spittin bout tools
You ain't hustlin on the steps
Before rap you was in culinary arts, hustlin to be a chef
Come on stop lyin Ran
You never been good with weight, you good with fryin pans
You not grimey you dirty, how long you think you gon rep Jersey
You not 25 you 30
And I ain't gettin shit outta this, I should stop it
But Tony Romo niggas stay gettin outta pocket
I won't cause ya goons harm I already see you tryna get me mad dog cuz his buzz like Boons Farm
I been in JC Since '92
They was the only niggas I could kick rhymes to
Before everybody wanted a label to sign to
You must got me f*cked up thinking im you!
See I ain't have no cash
I was learning from chaos, medicine cabinet and low cash
Sayin I can't come back is the worst rhyme
I was there when Jay Brown changed his name the first time
So now I gotta give lessons bout Jersey
Before wetland everything was 7 30 dog
You the fraud you tryna be hard, I was there when the feds kept chasin after shard
Not westside union, I live with bizzike
Went to st anthony's to go and check big ike
You think you cool wit niggas you say wassup to'em
Difference between us is I grew up wit'em
Rappin's my duty, I admired a newbie, I first meet deon sellin dude my uzi
And it worked out, he had beef and I was broke
But I never cocked it so I ain't see that it was broke
You a joke, watchu wanna keep talkin bout those guys dog
I ain't mad I risked my life for 0-5
You and Meedah fly you spit verses
I took him to the studio so he could lay his first shit
So you right, these young niggas dont know me
But do your homework, go ask a few OG's
Me and you see the hood way different
You glorify it, im horrified of it
Dont be stupid all your life Ran, be clear
I fuck with cats from the hood that wanna leave there
And this is when I know I heard it all;
His stupid ass proud to live on the third floor
He like "Im in the hood all day, I gets it poppin''
You WHACK MOTHERFUCKER, you dont have another option
Talkin bout the city hate Mouse, are you serious?
We go through that once a month, its the new period
Nothin about you's tough, to say the least
Your fans think you a beast, I think you a feast
Keep lightin up the match, but he dont get hot
Scream Webb and Nitty name so he dont get shot
We both unsigned, you hate it, im loving it
Im busy, you bored, you beat, im coveted
Who believes him? bad enough his flows not seasoned
And when you came at Joe, the shit weakened
Push him off the deep end, how the fucks we even?
Your career fell bout short as a great weekend
At fight night, im in vegas when you wanna be
The only time you sit ring-side is on Tonellee
So much drama in the NYC
Liftin weights tryna fit in them skin tight tee's
And ya disses feel like they full of bitterness, anger
Cue the violins Miri Ben Ari
No one asked ya man Dread bout the toys in ya house
You Dougie Fresh'n it just makin noise wit ya mouth
Tell me how I'm a hater, nah I rhyme greater
Next to me you'll always be the denominator
Look I'm too fearless, thought I had a good understandin of who my peers is
Till you pulled this weird shit, careless
Put ya name in some good use, hold ya music for ransom cause we don't wanna hear it
Maybe you never heard Joe Budden music
You can't use my life in a diss it's just useless
So that secret shit you spoke about in a song
Nigga go and download, Where Did It Go Wrong
You can't ride no more like warn tires
You can go to Southern Cal right now to get on fire
Think, if I'm the label, why hire you?
Nothin even pops up when I limewire dude
This nigga's not a thug nevermind what I say
Ask anybody went to Club Spa on Friday
When you tryna succeed, how you a dope boy?
Couldn't support ya own habit I was buyin ya weed
I mean, but how dare niggas talk about the Game beef
When it was off wax, nigga that was gang beef
On Top the only one's that would entertain beef
Yall said he talkin about you Joe, that ain't me
So get lost all that gangsta shit soft
Even all ya songs wit features ain't piff dawg
What you do but go and get out shined by Rick Ross
When you gonna learn I'm the wrong one to piss off
You could put the mic down you don't want trouble fag
The chrome 50 put his brains in a duffle bag
He ain't a killa tell him show you all the hammers
Think he a gorilla tell him show you the bananas
Dawg, nigga came out look like a spartan
But keep gettin smoked, now he lookin like a carton
Cause I'll put the bars in just to create a margin
FUCK prime time he ain't ready for the sparrin
Us in the same weight class is mind bogglin
You goin at full speed while I'm joggin
Tryna get rich live young made and handsome
You'll go down as just another unpaid ransom
A few things in life that you ain't learn
And a few stripes out there that you ain't earn
Like you think niggas love you, think dudes respect you
