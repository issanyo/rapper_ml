[Intro]
Whats up mic check 1 2 1 2
New Joe Budden

[Verse 1]
Now wait a damn minute I done made you listen
I been in the Lamb sittin you watchin you Can’t miss it
Enjoyin all the fruits of my drive and my ambition
Man I gotta tell ya this a hell of a transition
If you ain’t got bands sittin then we understand different
Walk in the club showin her love you can hand pick her
Shaped like a mannequin hey what’s your name n****
Shorty wanna stay with me must think that I’ll stay with her
For the project next I’m thinking project sex
The crib is Project X shes from the products from that
She said “I hate when you treat me like an object in bed”
Bitch what you logically expect I got the top off a text
Now that’s a body in uh army the zombie and I kindly
Wanna party with Kehlani we at a party with Kehlani
But as soon as the flight touch down got one night in this town
How you think you got a right to the crown I Get Around

[Chorus]
The Underground just don’t stop for hoes I get around
Closest thing round to 2pacalypse Now I get around
Ridin round with the mac and the pound I get around
Closest thing round to 2pacalypse Now I get around

[Verse 2]
I’m back on Def Jam again
You niggas keep getting def and I just yam again y’all see how I’m handlin
New Benz big boy coupe seat reclining tho
White pipin on black seats blastin domino
I pull up honk that horn she know its time to go
She take long windows down I’m screamin vamanos
Lately I been reeling with hate all kind of trolls
I’m just tryna stack this bread feel the homonym
Off that my main point back to rhyming tho
Bitches get beside themselves like watching Quantico
And then fools get wet from the tool
Playing superhero here might lead to a deadpool
Surrounded by chump niggas I always hated you niggas
I’m feeling like Trump niggas I’m right in the trunk niggas
The boys got you raising the bar won’t jump with ya
They tailored to be bad in the ring chump niggas
I don’t engage warring with words tongue slicker
I’m probably only aloud because I got to the trunk quicker
I’m not under ashamed Hunger Games but when niggas was full
Joey feel jack hip to the bull
I never sleep shit I get nightmares in the worst way
They say I’m missing screws wasn’t there in the first place
But when that flight touch down got one night in this town
They treat me like a knight in this town I get around

[Chorus]
The Underground just don’t stop for hoes I get around
Closest thing round to 2pacalypse Now I get around
Ridin round with the mac and the pound I get around
Closest thing round to 2pacalypse Now I get around
