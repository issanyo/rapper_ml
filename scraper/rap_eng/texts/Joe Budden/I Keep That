[Verse 1]
It's a few dudes wanna hit me 'til I die
Forced to walk around with the semi on my side
With a couple dum outs that'll empty if you try
In that all blue Charger with the hemi on the side
It's a few rappers that's quick to jones
I just turn their song off and think 'sticks and stones'
Click the chrome, don't pass that to me
Unless you're trynna make Joe the next Cassidy
I'mma addict, I don't cop one, I cop three
And females, I don't stop them, they stop me
And I don't go to parties for the music, the drink, or the dance
I go to watch them watch me
With no watch b, just my regular shit on
T-shirt, rubberband telling me 'LiveStrong'
R&B'd out, bumpin' Ideal 'Get Gone'
And Jersey gon' ride out whenever that shit's on

[Hook]
See I walk with a lean, got a mean diddy bop on me
Niggas know I keep a lil' bit of guap on me
I could buy this bar out but I'm not homie
Cause niggas know I keep a lil' bit of guap on me
I'mma call you right back, I got the cops on me
A black man with a lil' bit of guap on me
Stash box, I need something to pop on me
You know I keep that chopper and that guap on me

[Verse 2]
I'ma gambler
So I pull up in that CLS looking like a Carolina Panther
Philly Eagle on me to avoid the yank
Cops cuff my jackets like a New Orleans Saint
And the boys think something is sweet, I'm Lance Armstrong
Keep getting accused of something I beat
See me in the strip club looking for something to skeet
While watching you trynna wife something I beat
Just see how that guap get 'em, I got lots to give 'em
But not you, slide off boo, I'm not tippin'
I kept it real, told her 'I don't like how you're moving'
She gave me the finger, said 'I don't like your music'
I'm on my grind though I hate the action
And insomnia gave me a delayed reaction
I'm on a money hunt, can't take distractions
And these Os'll add up once I chase Manhattan

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's almost like I'm walking a tight wire
You can't con a con or lie to a liar
Look here, I'll fire
Just say what I feel like I'm Kanye live standing next to Mike Myers
Up like gas prices, might be on a private jet
While you at Exxon, give me 5 reg
You on some Jew shit, a little tight with your bread
I'll spend it all, cook another pie instead, ya heard!

[Hook]
