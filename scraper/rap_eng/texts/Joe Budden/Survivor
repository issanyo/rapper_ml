When your mind ain't right, and it's hard to sleep
And you try to hide the pain, but your scars are deep
Nigga look me in my eyes and tell me what you see, yeah..
When your mind ain't right, and it's hard to sleep
And you try to hide the pain, but your scars are deep
Nigga look me in my eyes and tell me what you see..

[Verse]
1 - And my heart is like
3 - There's one thing poppa told me
1 - If nothin else in this world, it's how to survive
