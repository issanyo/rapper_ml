[Intro: [?]]
Squad up!
[?]
The flow of the century!

[Verse 1 : Cau2G$]
[?] roll up (what!) I'ma roll up (what!)
Keep dumpin' until I see you fold up (what!)
[?] hip-hop's MC murder device
Murder the studio, murder the track, murder the mic (murder the mic)
I could, yes, I can (yes, I can)
Murder a platinum artist and sadden a million fans (shit)
We can make it real like reality shows
If you a bitch ass artist, I don't battle no ho's
Have niggas get that rapper, tie you up, [?]
Until you turn green like a Packer (and I ain't lyin')
Joe, Stack, and G's, reload that and squeeze
Start at ya head and end the clip at ya knees
If I ain't hard, tell me what the fuck is
Go gun for gun, I'll show you what tough is
Ya money ain't right (right), I eat Oprah up
'Cause my stomach is on Ethiopia

[Chorus: [?]]
You know what'll happen once I c—c—catch 'em
Let 'em wear a bullet and see if the shit match 'em
You know what'll happen once I s—s—s—s—spot 'em
Run up and red dot 'em, yeah, nigga, I got 'em
You know what'll happen once I c—c—catch 'em
Let 'em wear a bullet and see if the shit match 'em
You know what'll happen once I s—s—s—s—spot 'em
Run up and red dot 'em, yeah, nigga, I got 'em
You know what'll happen

[Verse 2: Stack Bundles]
([?]) Or we could keep it a secret
[?] ya with the same steak knife I eat wit'
And I ain't really 'posed to dirty my hands
'Cause when I do it I'm just weakenin' my chain of command (bruh)
But sometimes it's worth it (for real)
And most niggas is bitches, ya die with the same problem ya birthed with
Hermaphrodite, uh, nasty
And now the coke prices 'bout as high as the gas be
I read you young niggas like The Great Gee-as-by
Convertible, eight-forty, same colour as NESTEA
You ask me niggas salty like [?] (why?)
'Cause a nigga move green like Lantern (for real)
Or purple like the label on his cardigan, so honor him
Have vinyl hangin' from a tree like an ornament (ornament)
And these niggas I'm supposed to beef wit'?
Ku Klux Klan 'em, have 'em on some white sheet shit ([?])

[Chorus: [?] (Joe Budden)]
You know what'll happen once I c—c—catch 'em
Let 'em wear a bullet and see if the shit match 'em
You know what'll happen once I s—s—s—s—spot 'em
Run up and red dot 'em, yeah, nigga, I got 'em
You know what'll happen once I c—c—catch 'em
Let 'em wear a bullet and see if the shit match 'em
You know what'll happen once I s—s—s—s—spot 'em (it's, it's...)
Run up and red dot 'em, yeah, nigga, I got 'em (it's that On Top music!)
You know what'll happen

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
If it's real beef I'm cookin' 'em with the nine
So you rap niggas best stop lookin' for the sublime
I'm fully aware I ain't cared for amongst my peers
It's also clear these niggas is queer, yeah
If you see me with the Glock then I'm Rambo
We [?] doors, we just cop Lambo's
I'ma sling 'til God put me in a cage
You want South Beach tan or a hardwood beige? (oh)
Dumb out, dumb out, gun out, the one blaow
Will dump out, yep, could'a guessed that he would run out
Yep, could'a guessed that he would squeeze 'til it run out
I might put the revolver up and pull a pump out (why?)
Coppers get at me regardless
Got the key to my hood, I'm gettin' all faced wit' Cassidy charges
You hear that Gat sound?
Tough guy stop tryna be Jeezy with all that "yeah" in the background (yeah)
If it's 'bout [?] I done it
So start treatin' me as if my credit score's over eight-hundred
I ain't with the riffraff 'til it get to the click-clack
Pissbag, have 'em walkin' with a pissbag
No rappers wrestlin', I do it for starters
Fix his wig up, call me Brutus "The Barber", nigga
I told money that I'm his father
Nigga had his whole hood lookin' like Pearl Harbor, nigga
Teach dudes how to steal and get fly
Four bathrooms and up with the ceilings that's high
Driveway when I'm peelin' that five
Man, fuck it, I just copped a whole island since Gilligan died (yeah)
I hustle that blow, call me Hustle & Flow
Cut the top of the charger like, "Fuck it, it's Joe"
'Cause I was fourteen like runnin' [?]
Back when Cappadonna put his number in the song
Stones and [?] shit, diamonds on my neck shit
Bracelet, necklace, yep, get on some next shit
But if your outfit is nice I'ma check it
Marques Houston won't be the only nigga naked, motherfucker

[Verse 4: Bynoe]
(You know what'll happen) Once I c—c—catch 'em (yeah)
Ah shit, the MAC-Eleven made a mess of 'em (what else?)
If you kick my dog I'ma shoot your cat
The right never gon' stop, all hell [?] (salute)
I ain't got shit to lose, you want beef? Let's do it
I get you banged up courtesy of my best shooters (yeah)
All you got is respect, ain't nuttin' promised but death
Lead wounds and pour Henny is the outcome of that
I toured the world and fucked the baddest bitches in all states (ah-huh)
Come back to the hood to bullshit and more hate (damn)
I'm disgusted, all the shit that's goin' on
Lay a hand on me, your mama gon' be singin' slow songs (it's so hard)
[?] lose a couple pints and you stressed like the letter t
You got yourself to blame, so check, check out my nina, b
You know what'll happen (happen)
Your head hurt? I got a fully loaded magazine to aspirin
Them painkillers hittin' ya
I get up in that young boy ass like an enema (yeah)
And that's no homo
I have your ass sittin' on flats like low-pros ([?])
I spit piss on a nigga for GP (what else?)
Bust a nigga head wide open if need be (okay)
So go ahead and make your lil' record
Say my name and your mama gon' be talkin' to detectives, nigga

[Outro: [?]]
You know what'll happen
