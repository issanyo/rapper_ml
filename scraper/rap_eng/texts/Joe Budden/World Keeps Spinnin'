[Talking]
Yeah...
Escape Route
Let's go

[Hook]
And the world keeps spinning! [Nigga]
I feel like the world keeps spinning [Spinning]
And the world keeps spinning
It's like the world keeps winning
And to spite me the world keep grinning

[Verse 1]
I ain't trying to bother none
So how I end up bothersome?
Yeah you damn right I'm my father's son
Minus prison, minus over 20 years in the system
But don't take away the wisdom
Holy water won't cleanse him
Hardheaded, won't convince him
A nigga wear pride like it's denim
Fuck who don't get along with me
I'm alright with everything that's wrong with me
And that's how it's going to be
That opinion is mine, motherfucker, it belong to me
So get mad at it, half beast, half addict
Can halfass it and be better than rap bastards
Black 'matic, give me room asthmatic asthmatic
I spit high class acid, I'm positive, now that's magic
I'm trying to change shit like a Panther
Asking the right questions but getting the wrong answers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I could talk about how a nigga trade slugs
Boast about, toast and what the .38 does
But a nigga seen what happened to the fam of J-Hud
So I thank God for every morning I wake up
Wait up! I could front as if everything's fine
But my grandmother's dying, and shes 89
Older but her mind about as sharp as mine
If this world were mine I would rewind time
To a time when her heart didn't leak that fluid
She needs surgery, doctors talking stupid
Said "she already lived her life so she can afford to lose it"
Talking like their tools is useless
Ain't that some shit, she gotta approve it
Grandma ready to go, she'd rather them not do it
No matter how much it might hurt me
Another lesson learned, some fights ain't fight worthy

[Verse 3]
I'm waiting on a true revival
I'mma call you a coward if you alive and suicidal [WHY?]
Either be grateful for everything God said you supposed to get
Or pull the trigger and get over it
Hip Hop's Poster-Kid, all this weight on my back
But you ain't gotta spot me, I can shoulder it
Life's a rollercoaster, that ride gonna be easy
Why don't you believe me? My parents was high when they conceived me
Say I got a couple control issues
I disagree, I just like to control issues
My train of thought, my state of mind
Is I could change the world one state at a time
With the matters of every hater aligned
Got an agenda, I just feel like ya'll should cater to mine
Ideas brilliant, perservere, I'm resilient
Until the world change, I be right here chilling
Nigga
