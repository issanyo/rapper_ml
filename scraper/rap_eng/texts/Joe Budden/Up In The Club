[Hook: Marques Houston]
You know we be up in the club
Where we do things like throw our hands up
All kinds of drinks are off in the cups
All of my thugs, honeys show me love, DJ's playing the cuts

[Verse 1: Marques]
I'm dancing with a nice honey and her friend
One on the back and one on the front
Shaking it up, shaking it up, mami don't break it
Taking it down, taking it down I love the way you snake it
You got the best of me doing what you're doing
Up in the VIP doing what you're doing
Girl I'm about to buy you anything you want
Get you in the coup and take your pretty ass home
Last call for alcohol, you know how we do, yeah

[Hook]
You know we be up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up
All kinds of drinks are (All kinds of drinks are up in the club)
Off in the cups all of my thugs
Honeys show me love
DJ playing the cuts (yeah, yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: Marques]
I pull up on dubbs, hop up out the whip
Then I'm into the club honeys on each side
And I'm on my cellular talking to this chick
Got a taste for thugs sometimes pimping is tough
White tees and throwback, Jacob on my wrist
Super star, world wide it is what it is
Threw a party at my crib, that's the after
Till 6 in the morning, drinks and laughter
Uh oh, uh oh
Yeah its a fire mama's getting naughty
Got a sexy body like
Uh oh, uh oh
Being erotic, bout to wild this place out
You know how we do it up in the club

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Mami, you won't holla
I can spot you out the corner of your eye that tell you wanna ride
You looking at Papi like uh
Wanna hold hands - no amp, no man, Joe can
But you and your friend can both get rammed like uh
You's a private dancer
Low riders, when she walk pullin' her pants up
Its all good baby
You know where I'm at right
In case you need be me come put it on your back side
Only if you act right
Damn it you doing it, doing what you're doing
You're doing it to me I picture you doing it to me like uh
I only came out because I'm here to find ya
After the bars last call be at the nearest dinner
We be Nextel tagging, SL wagon
You grabbing the whip just off of that XL Magnum
Damn it you're doing it, you and your friend
Next weekend if you're lucky we can do it again, like uh
