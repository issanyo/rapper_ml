[Hook: Royce Da 5'9"]
I tossed I turn, can't sleep at night
I punch, I kick, I claw, I bite
It seems that I can’t win this fight
Hands together, if you there tell ‘em leave me alive
Devil's got a hold of me, devil's got a hold of me
Devil's got a hold of me (Devil's got a hold of me)

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Pen in my right hand, beat on repeat
He hates when I’m writing so the thing on my nightstand
Start ringing and lighting up, vibrating and all that
I don’t wanna sell no more crack, I just wanna go perform at
The biggest place in the world cause I’m dope like them four packs
Sitting in [?] on my windowsill, making sure everything stays on chill
Right shoulder wearing all white saying “Joe chill”, left shoulder wearing red saying “pay yo bills”
So that raw metaphor
That I thought of before, I don’t remember no more
Cause I just ran out the door to meet a fiend by the store
And I heard “So you off touring?” I turn and seen his whore
That I used to fiend for that ain't never let me score
Looking at me like I’m something she ain't never ever saw
So a one-hour run somehow turned into twenty-four
Wifey callin’, I hit ignore, my priorities is poor, listen Lord

Devil's got a hold of me, devil's got a hold of me
Devil's got a hold of me (Devil's got a hold of me)

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
My life is like a box of chocolates
I work hard for it plus I am awkward, uh
I am an addict’s son, plus I am an addict son!
I am an 8k addict, uh, Travis drums
I am the lead done factor
That's why I got an edge on rappers, I am redrum backwards
I see your crew and get deep so you can respect it, jump me
I signed a deal with my maker, Satan’s my record company
I got a K canon, I buy chinchillas
My bitches rocking luci-furr after they say Tannon
Now can you say tannon better yet say Dannon
The coupe look just like yogurt, I fly I ain't landing
I am the bank bandit, I got a buying problem
I goes in and walk out with all the money but I ain't rob ‘em

Devil's got a hold of me, devil's got a hold of me
Devil's got a hold of me (Devil's got a hold of me)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I’m talking, I’m talking
He talks, I listen, GPS on my position
Just living, just hanging out with the opposition
Can’t take the heat, get the fuck out the kitchen
Stupid, y'all, think it was just me
I belong in prison crazy by my own admission
On a mission to grab a podium, let me tell the public
That I’m self-destructive, I ain't looking for no help, fuck it
Look for a way to get high, I’m still alive
6 million ways to die and still a few more left to try
'til my face is red boy, pills in us, still a slight menace
We just going back and forth feeling like tennis standing underneath rain
What are we sayin’, friends and family wanted me to change
But it's too late cause my feet is getting comfy on the flames, check it
I don’t wanna be another nigga with no gold, no fame, success, nigga, no hope
Sleep in the corner in Soho, my uppers down, its no dough
Fuck it they ain't put me under yet
Think what you wish I ain't got one regret

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9"]
I tossed I turn, can't sleep at night
I punch, I kick, I claw, I bite
It seems that I can’t win this fight
Hands together, if you there tell ‘em leave me alive
Devil's got a hold of me, devil's got a hold of me
Devil's got a hold of me (Devil's got a hold of me)

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
My automobile is not a Bentley
He knows that my pockets empty
The devil, so consequently he gotta tempt me
Standing on the block, you should not offend me
I rock a semi, like Prada Fendi, I don’t think the spirit of God is in me
Just wicked whispers of scriptures, Satan is narrating
I heard you got a safe in your crib so I’m there waiting
Nobody safe in your crib, when I’m in that staircase I’m bare-faced
Possessed by what you possess, I’m hell raising
And I just left somebody’s father a quadriplegic
Told em not to move or get shot to Egypt
He did not believe it
He’s losing blood and I’m cold blooded like I’m anemic
I need a doctor I’m psychotic maybe I should watch The Secret
Or see a Priest and I might just chill
Or will I blow ‘em outta the confession booth like on Righteous Kill
Kill, kill, kill, God when I write this will
I hope I seek some forgiveness cause my life was real

Devil's got a hold of me
De-de-devil's got a hold of me
Devil's got a hold of me
Devil-de-de-devil's got a hold of me
