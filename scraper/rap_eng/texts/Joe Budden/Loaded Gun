[Lu Jerz]
Loaded gun
Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang

[Hook]
Feels like a loaded gun, bang
Loaded gun, loaded gun
Aiming right, bang
Aiming right at my head
Loaded gun, bang
Loaded gun, loaded gun
Firing up, bang, at my head
Walking through life
Not really knowing what's gonna happen
Living in fear, in fear of me relapsin'
The streets keep calling, bang
There's no time for talking

[Tsu Surf]
So what you wanna know first?
These streets or these drugs, which one is worse?
Well, damn, shit, this is a cold world
Could only prop a nigga right for a warm hearse
I know, so many niggas trying to cap Tsu
Cause this buzz big and this hat blue
So many answers in this capsule
At the point where I'm feeling like I have to
Well, ever felt you wanna get away?
Man, I hate when that happens and shit
Cause you feel the same way when you back from the trip
But fucking with the same vice or getting back with the bitch
Dark room, thoughts, weed
Demons spread from nothing but sweat
Thinking, thinking like French kissing the fifth, right?
Right, or maybe Russian roulette
Four thorns break to a part
Couple blunts, but I swear I bought more to spark
It'll be a long night. Think I should've took a left, made the wrong right and still trying to right wrongs
Shit, these troubles seem life long
Survive or try to paint pictures daily as Picasso
Grandma pray, and I don't
But I'm here so it's working, shit, it gotta be
How can something I give so much to
Still wanna take a lot of me?
Shit, we don't dare to ask, oh shit, we don't care to ask
If I close my eyes and let it go I probably won't hear the blast

[Hook]

[Joe Budden]
Thinking what am I here for, sometimes a nigga feel dead
Thinking what do I care for, just a fucked up pill head
Nothing left, can't share more, just know a nigga tried, Lord
But an old addicts, old habits
Give another meaning to the term 'Vice Lord'
And I still ain't spoke to my pops
We should have handled this much sooner
Don't agree with me, just be with me
After all I'm still your junior
Look, got two trying to make me choose
They don't get this shit cut close
If I could ever tell him the truth
I might say I'm in love with both
And that can't be the answer, no, gotta go see grandpa
I'm up here fighting with broads
He down South fighting with cancer
And I can't make that same mistake
That I made years ago with grandma
Gotta put my career on hold
And go see him while I still got the chance to
Stained by what I can't do, this pain substantial
And a millionaire couldn't come and solve it
No, this debt ain't financial
More like a loaded gun, and these thoughts keep stalking
I'm caught in between a war of words
What's worse is I'm the only one talking

[Hook]
