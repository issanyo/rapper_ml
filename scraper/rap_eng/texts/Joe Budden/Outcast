Stuck in the everyday struggle, only mines is hourly
Jungle full of wolves with a few lions that's cowardly
Used to make it hot, even that was too mild for me
School of hard knocks, tried to make the teacher proud of me
Sue me, script straight out of a movie
Toooolie, won't get kicked and pushed like Lupe
From groupies to housewives, from scams to skirmish
From sane to loco, from hustler to hermit
You let niggas plot and believe me they goin' try
My nigga been shot nine times and won't die
And so death threats become death threats
When they want you on your death bed and you ain't been put to rest yet
You in ICU
See the gunman in your head, damn can't wait 'til I see dude
Hate hospitals, I don't wanna go see dude
Know I love you to death, I feel it's no need to
In my mind there's bloody hallways and project windows
Dice games, thick clouds of project indo
Niggas creepin' off with the project nympho
Or plain clothes searching for some project info
Projects I resemble, so I don't stand out lookin' clean cut
Hangin 'round the project kinfolk
Cutthroats and liars, connects and suppliers
Fiends and they buyers, liquor store right by us
Kicks over the wire
If you Dave Blaine start choking in the water, send in the divers
Show dudes the real definition of survivor
In my mind I'm butt naked walking through the fire
Oxymoron, stubborn as a brick y'all
I'm a five star suite with the view of a brick wall
A high class scumbag, conceited nobody
Popular stranger, I see shit like nobody
A Tarrantino, Martin Scorsese
Coming up, I was that nigga they called crazy
In my hood, they like fuck em all, gotta pay me
Then get shot in the ass for thinking it's all gravy
I'm on my third C.I. now
And my bitch running round like she a P.I. now
Going through his phone book and his Levi's now
It's two choices, chillax or leave right now
That's how it be right now ain't ya ordinary rapper dude
Menace To Society, a nigga with a attitude
A soul of mischief, I know all about that
Poor righteous teacher, nah more like a outcast
