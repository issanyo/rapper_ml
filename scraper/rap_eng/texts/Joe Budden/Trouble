[Intro: Omarion]
You in trouble
Baby, you in trouble
And you gonna get it
Open up your eyes
Come here, your gonna get it

Baby come in here, lay right there
Gonna touch your body everywhere
You moaning and shaking baby, I like that yeah
Telling me to go harder with your legs in the air

[Bridge: Omarion]
Oh yeah, right now girl its about you, oh

Baby this is how its gonna go go go go
When, when we make love

[Verse: Joe Budden]
She in trouble, had to slide right up under her
Had to be the only reason I would punish her
Tried to avoid it, had her girlfriends come with her
But they gon wait up in that living room till I’m done with her
They gon sit tight baby no interruptions
While I’m knocking down her walls like they under construction
French on her nails with her hair done beautifully
And what the fuck you thought them boy shorts was gonna do to me?
Face like Megan little thicker than Hale
Had me up all night as if my dick’s into molly
I know that our endeavor was fun
Cause she stored me in her phone
As he can have it whenever he wants
