[Intro: Joe Budden]
Uh-ohhhh, uh-oh
Uh-ohhhhhh! That on top, ohh!
Ta-ha, Joey (yeah, shit go hard too)
No comment, no comment
Ta-ha, whole bunch of yappin
Jersey! That N.J. bullshit
Let me talk to 'em, l-look look look

[Joe Budden]
Since the world don't revolve around me
(Then what?) Hoodie on, revolver on me
I'm the wrong one you wanna amp (why?)
Cause niggas could get missing
Like you straight out of LeBron's summer camp (ohh!)
Anytime the fed's see me
I tell 'em that the only thing FUCKERY here gets you an STD
My life, should be sold as a movie
From the *Slum dog* tryin to be a +Millionaire+, no groupies
When did the civilians decide to be a thug?
Motivated by the hate (BUT) inspired by the love
Rappers sayin my name like it's a bright tactic
*Jackson 5*, put your *Mike* in a casket
Let the fans gas you and tell you you're nice
Be a legend in RAP, but a failure in life
For real, I don't think these dudes is spectacular
Pretty Ricky thugs who move like spectacular, nigga!

[Hook: Joe Budden]
What up with you and so-and-so? Heard you got a diss
Don't know about THAT, but I know about this nigga
No comment (what) no comment (what)
No comment, I ain't got a comment
Bloggers, Twitter, Budden TV
No comment, y'all ain't gettin nothin from me
I said, no comment (what) no comment
No comment, I ain't got a comment

[Joe Budden]
So I been called a snitch (BUT)
But I been called worse by better so let's skip over the lecture
That's a common lie (why?)
Cause if I ever call the cops it's only gon' be to report a homicide
How am I in beef? I walk about free
They only talk about YOU, when you talk about ME
So go ahead and act hard
And somebody gon' grab chalk (and) and turn the streets into a blackboard
So I'm supposed to put niggas on a pedestal
For rappin 'bout a bunch of bullshit that they don't ever do
You look stupid when you go there
Say I'm only hot online you ain't heatin up nowhere
SHOT-gun in SHOT-gun, ride right past ya
Windows down, got every right to blast ya
No wonder he thinkin he'll provide a disaster
Cause bitches keep tellin him that size don't matter (ta-ha)

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Joe Budden]
Things niggas say I don't mind it
Say they lost respect for me, who the FRUCK is askin you to find it?
This is me practicing censorship
Since the new definition of real nigga is sensitive
In his interview, say I'm askin for a hearse
But couple months BACK he was askin for a verse
Only hurts is the team used to bump you
Now he look like a fiend, I should slump you

[Outro - ad libs to the end]
