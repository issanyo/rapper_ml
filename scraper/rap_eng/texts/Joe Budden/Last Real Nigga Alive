[Intro: Joe Budden ([?])]
On top (come on)
All right

[Verse: Joe Budden]
Please Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just right [?] ([?] just tell my side of the story)
[?] look at the bullshit I been through (Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden)
[?] next generation of rap, let's continue (relate to it)
[?] might not understand now 'cause the picture is tainted
I'ma take the time out for y'all to try to explain it
I was a kid in Jerse', no name, no stage
Listen close while I get everybody on the same page
Me and [?] made music (but), the times was hard
And we really couldn't pursue it 'cause we both had jobs (talk to 'em)
Bryce said we could get straight cream
Rap over other niggas beats and I ain't know about the mixtape scene (I ain't know about it)
So we did that, goin' off my godbrothers promise
I spit a hundred over "Nastradamus" (y'all don't remember that)
And Bryce knew [?] so I had hope all along
Next [?] tape was two freestyles and a song
He gave C, said "It's the go, I bet you"
C said, "He's all right, but what's so special?" (but what's so special 'bout him?)
Held onto it and it must've been luck
Because some nigga named Webb went in the back of his truck
And found my shit, listened and the rhythm was ill
Said, "This kid's all right and watch me get him a deal" (and he did that)
On Top met me and [?] and we liked him
Gave us ten-G's [?]
Started makin' music loosley
But DJ's was hesitant to play 'em because nobody knew me
I guess Joe Budden was new
I needed some help, so Fab came through and we did "Coming For You"
Did another joint later on with Tah Murdah and Black Child
The streets finally started to react now
Made some songs, it was such a long process
[?] stopped by to check progress
Steady bangin' Clue who was still ignorin'
Cutmaster and Envy were still supportin'
Then Clue got with it, 'cause my man called hype
Tellin' me I'm on the Clue tapes [?] ([?])
People started to really see what was what now
Your boy got a lil bit of buzz now
Everything was so timely
'Cause Game went up there and told Kevin [?] he wanted to sign me (and I was hype y'all)
So On Top went to meet with Leo and Kev about business
They started talkin' some spit shit (spit)
It was a new label, we ain't know all about
The rappers they wanted to sign, but wasn't sure about
Made it sound worth my while, though it was weird for me
Told me if I broke the label they'd take care of me (you know)
You put out [?] speed things up
But that shit ain't keep things up, I started noticin' (what?)
That Def Jam treated spit as a knockoff
And Jump Off's better than that y'all, I got off
Then I'm on Def Jam, waitin' and chillin'
[?] mixtapes to get things straight in the buildin'
Left the streets dry, I ain't give 'em no ether
[?] beggin' for a feature
And they gave us one, and we thought it was hittin'
We thought [?] would sell, but they didn't
And I liked that song and the hook
Plus they was shootin' a video and we was mad thirsty for a look
But they ruined that shit, had my whole camp feelin' the worst
At the last minute cut my second verse
And the politics had me hopeless
And the label just kept overlookin' me [?] ([?])
[?] travel from state to state
Club banger, no video, spinnin' [?] eight at eight
By the time Def Jam knew it bumped and had flavour (it's too late)
Record died down, this is eight months later ([?])
And that whole time I was out of the street mix
So they tried to bring it back with a bullshit remix
And now they respectin' a nigga
But I'm scared 'cause the SoundScan is straight disrespectin' a nigga (it's fucked up right now)
So it's back to the mixtapes where I ain't gotta deal with the nonsense
And the next two leaders [?] (y'all 'ready know)
So at a time where the whole rap game is shaken
There's a slot wide open and it's there for the takin'
