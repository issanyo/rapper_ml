[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Look I want to spend time with you
That's what I'm trynna do
And I know I don't even gotta tell you, "You fine" but you...
But you got me fucked up
Look I wanna get next you
But I won't keep textin' you
And you think every nigga only wanna have sex with you
Baby, don't be stuck up

[Hook: Joe Budden & Emanny]
I done been around bad bitches my whole life
And I don't mean to be rude
But if I had to make a top ten list it wouldn't include you
I been around bad bitches my whole life
And reality of it is
I know you fuckin' with a nigga
And the bottom line you cute too
So while I get to know you
And you get to know me
Whatever gonna happen it'll happen slowly
There's enough pussy in this world for me to not need yours
So even if I hold you
Let you hold me
Even if we spend time together for the whole week
There's enough pussy in this world for me to not need yours

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Now tell me what I'm supposed to do
Should I be like every nigga that you meet up in the streets?
And a beast nigga close to you
I'd much rather get the most of you
Instead of getting my dick sucked
We could hit the strip club and pour it up
Make a toast to you
So let me tell you I got through 'em
And I love already
You the person I be thinking of already
So if we took it further
That would lead to murder
She would find you
And you'd probably get snuffed already
Cause she gon' ask "Who that bitch?"
So when I say "She just a friend,"
I really wanna mean "She just a friend."
