Yeah, (what up, Joey?)
It's, it's

[Verse]
They say a
Closed mouth don't get fed, and an open one does
So it's all about what you believe and not what niggas is eatin'
If open mouths is open long enough niggas can see in
Here you out of reach (nigga,) clear you out of breathin'
They love to hate me, the cowardly brothers sleep on 'im (so?)
I make 'em starve, and Sally Struthers can speak for 'em
Nobody in the game can hold me, I'm the same as Kobe
Dunk over your back, you overmatched, nigga: Shane Mosley
If this is beef I'll get Chris and Neef
Not them niggas from the Roc neither, get it from the block me [?] heater
And if you live 'bout battle, I'll razor ya face (dog)
Niggas'll never get a five-o'clock shadow (yeah)
Thug get a gun, you alone? Get a mob
You scared? Get a dog, and if you broke get a job!
What the fans thought'll make me knock out
Niggas and cam-cord (what's good?,) 'cause all you pack is a JanSport
I hate guns like I hate condoms
Don't like the feel to it, but gotta be safe, so I still use it
Black lottos or get at y'all in my Tim's, cousin
Hit you with the lead, I'm "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan
This ain't cute (nah,) nigga, this is way past a fluke
Ask Okafor, I'm way past Duke
Stop what, nigga?
Don't even start a war if you ain't got bucks, nigga
