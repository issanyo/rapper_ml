[Intro]
All night, we gon' cut tonight
We gon' cut tonight, we gon' cut tonight, we gon' [?]
Go head, [?]
All night, we gon' cut tonight
We gon' cut tonight, we gon' cut tonight, we gon' [?]

[Chorus]
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
Ladies suck ya teeth and roll ya eyes
Keep ya man in check, ma, control them guys
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
My dudes play the wall and grab ya dick
And if she gets outta line the, smack that biatch

[Verse 1]
Now if he call you a 5, it ain't to say hi
It's to get you on ya back with ya legs high
He call you a ten like it's nothin' real major
He a smart dude, he settin' it up for later
If he spends time, y'all all over town hangin'
The more shit he buy you, the bigger the down payment
And if you get the house number on the spot
Then you finer than every girl he already got
Don't fall for the line, get grown in ya head
It's a lie if he hit you wit "my phone was dead"
Or the old "I was sleep", them lines is so [?]
Y'all always fall for the "I ain't have no signal"
If he don't answer when you block ya number
He probably got a wife and he blocks you from her
Condoms irritate him, and he wanna try raw
Chances are he's used that line before
If he breaks up with you like, right before Christmas
Then you not his main girl or you wasn't on the gift list
Couple of rules, just a couple of jewels
If he got a baby mama, don't ever make him choose (you'll lose)
On the weekends, you hardly with him
All you really wanna do is go and party with him
But it's different reasons why we go to the club
Y'all tryna dance, we tryna fuck

[Chorus]
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
Ladies suck ya teeth and roll ya eyes
Keep ya man in check, ma, control them guys
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
My dudes play the wall and grab ya dick
And if she gets outta line the, smack that biatch

[Verse 2]
Now if she call you all day, always leavin' a message
Then you pipe her better than whoever she mess with
If she's tight with e'rybody you know
Then she's prolly a hoe and e'rybody know
Up and coming model, and she goin' so hard
It's just a nice way of sayin' she got no job
If every time you call she turn off the ringer
Then you probably turned her off and she rather use her finger
She makin' excuses lately, nigga
No kids, but she gotta find a babysitter
These are lines made up from girly
She don't really wanna see you if she say she gotta wake up early
(Nah) Don't fall for the BS she try to feed ya
Cause she'll try to beat ya, she'll try to G ya
Have you heated, come back scorchin'
But you know a girl period don't come that often
Get back in the game
If she give you head, she expects that in exchange
And if she got a seed, nah, don't even bother
'Cause if y'all ever beef, she'll threaten you with the father
And shes a good trick, she won't let you hit
She knows pussy's power, wanna see what she can get
And if you think that nuttin' I'm sayin is right
Then at least know to never make a hoe a housewife, nah

[Chorus]
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
Ladies suck ya teeth and roll ya eyes
Keep ya man in check, ma, control them guys
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
My dudes play the wall and grab ya dick
And if she gets outta line the, smack that biatch
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
Ladies suck ya teeth and roll ya eyes
Keep ya man in check, ma, control them guys
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
My dudes play the wall and grab ya dick
And if she gets outta line the, smack that biatch
