[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Check me out, I fell in love with the hatred
Love being hated, y'all should already know as much as I state it
Niggas ain't thinking, drugged or sedated
I could care less I give a fuck I made it
Best in the world, pull the plug on your playlist
Much that I dated, y'all cover parade with
Realest to ever do it, hate to interrupt the fake shit
If I said it I meant it, trust I don't insinuate shit
I turn a deaf ear to the feed back
You come from the bottom, I come from underneath that
Y'all hit the strip club toss a few G stacks
I invest it, and quadruple's what I see back
See I'm used to the all black ski mask
Grew to the louie duffle in elite class
Zero the speed limit I ain't going no where though, just mean they getting no where slow

[Hook: Joe Budden]
Why you want to hate me? Why would you want to hate me, me?
Why you want to hate me? Why you want to hate?
Why would you want to hate? y'all can go on and hate me
Y'all can go on and hate me, me, y'all can go on and hate me
Y'all can go on and hate, why would you want to hate?

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
It's mental, it's all in your thoughts
If you a janitor, mop the floor like a boss
Push the ford like a porsche
Sell a ounce like a bundle
Treat your plain looking girlfriend like a model and the models gon' want you
Rock the tee like it's an exclusive fit
If she give the best head,(nigga) just act like you used to the shit
See I'm good at that, walk like your dick is that big
If you slip out make her put it back, Why you want to hate me?
(See) I'm in the club so low key that you barely know it's me
Don't even like rap, in the cars flow is tree I might jack
Butterfly both virgins I'm on it like that
Ain't the richest or the flyest, best dressed
Just the sickest and the nicest, best kept
So when they hate me it's fun, cause I wasn't even a threat till they made me one, check it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
All I did was, take a small hood nobody knew about
Repped it, let the game know something new was out
Gave y'all my slang what you saying is old
Made it cool to be yourself, stop playing the role
Stood up to the label, said I'd rather have an opinion than sell my soul and be a minion
Majors gave him mad looks was a nice try, we gonna sell the same I just do it off of WiFi
When lyrics was in need around you
Slaughterhouse was born nigga meet the founder
All I did spit like a nigga from another world
Bitch was off [?] turned into a cover girl
Only dumb niggas hate on brilliance
Only dudes that won't last hate on resilience
I'm chilling just counting my blessings
I guess in essence I'm asking a rhetorical question
