See the haters is still soupin and
Y'all ain't happy to hear that I'm really couping it
Haters I'm really doing it
You can't step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
Nah, better yet I'm ambidextrous, I can do it with both
Haters tried to put a stop to it, I had to do it with toast
They don't like that I don't do it like most, muhfucka
Can't help the fact that I spit up acid
I'm from A Different World
Son I'm Dwayne Wayne without the flip up glasses, dog
A lot of you herbs be phony
I never said I'm the illest, but at this present time I'm Jersey's only
Trying desperately to wrap me up, started to fight with the game
Now what other rapper from my hood'll back me up?
And now they mad in the streets, but if I was wack it'd peace
And I never asked to be part of rap's elite
I was like y'all, struggling, I lived in my mom's crib
Then I dropped a couple freestyles and the people responded
And now when you flip about the stations
DJs holler "let's take it to Jersey"
All you hear is, uh, "salutations!"
I'm working hard on my grind I'm about to make it
See my cloud is raising, why can't I manage without the hating
The sooner the greater, if everything was peace
We could be a Unit like Flavor
Look around, you bout to ruin it hater
With a major, still I'm working myself
And I'm right where I wanna be so you only hurting yourself
Hoping I shelf, I'm promoting myself
And the bottom line is that hating is just self-centeredness just showing itself
Wanna bust off to hit me cause all the twenties in the loft is crispy
And all the streets want is Jumpoff and 50
Die traitor, asking me why playa
When I breeze through, all I do is look at you
Hi hater
Best friends become strangers, you shady dunn
And I done gave you some guidance, you chasing my baby moms
I used to feel I'm your man, know what that feel like my man?
How you look yourself in the mirror, still feel like a man?
Joey
Future greatest, I ain't twisted at all
And four albums down the line you can say you witnessed it all
Just think, you could say we had some business before
You could go as far as saying that we was niggas before
But it's just me and my box of bogeys I can't flock with you clonies
God damn being on top, it's so lonely
Sony say I sound like Grafh
I was signed a good year and a half before he popped up
Don't say I'm trying be something I'm not, what
Joe Budden dogs, I'm back in the circuit, the block is shut
This fall is a hot season
Def Jam invited me here and I'm not leaving
Just me and my box of bogeys, got my Glock as my homie
God damn being on top, it's so lonely
