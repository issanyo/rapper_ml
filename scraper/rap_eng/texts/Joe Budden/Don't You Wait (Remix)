Verse 1: Joe Budden

(Wait a minute!)
Look, I wish I could be closer
To the point I'm trying to keep composure
Wine glasses seated on the sofa
Seems our arguing never featured you sober
I storm out trying to concentrate with 30
Missed calls hard to contemplate
And so the, small things we just complicate
How you tarnish faith at this alarming rate?
Now we can't coexist, share common space
Either, we bail out or get the bond in place
And take it, to a time we was actin' right
When we would ignore calls, where its at tonight?
And your girls always say I ain't rap too tight
But we put soul to soul and got back to life
But now, it seems you couldn't love me less
I was cut me depressed, I was Cudi depressed
On the cusp of death, when you up and left
I was starving myself, didn't want to get dressed
If this is love, tell me why I'm under duress
Putting loud in the air to share some of the stress
When you famous, every break up come with the press
Question, do you wake up and wonder what's next?
When it comes to the sex am I one of the best
Like back when I would pull out cum on your breasts
But hold up...
Slow down, we was literally speedin'
The company I'd keep was misleading
Like, is she leaving? If he cheating?
Busy weekends spent with Niykee Heaton (look)
Baby this is real talk
My bitch asked if we still talk
But times passed and you doing you
Though I'm part of your past, I still ruined you
Code red, you in urgent danger
Gotta watch what you say they way words can taint ya
Drink away the pain, all the hurt and the anger
When you all too familiar with a perfect stranger (look)
But it's hard to stay family
When plan A is plan B
All you need is a break from insanity
How'd I expect you to wait, you can't stand me


[Verse 2]: Solange

I gave it all away that night, it was taking a little time, oh
I gave it all I got but now you better know that I know for sure, oh

[Refrain]
You made my bed, dealt with it when the lights went out
Now looking back for temporary nothings
But I bet on it, you'll all be here when the lights come out
Still looking for nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave it all I got to know now
I don't want no part of it no longer, no longer
Looked around this place enough to know now
I don't want to waste the time to know you, to know you

[Chorus]
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me

[Verse 3]
Now, I don't want to bite the hand that'll show me the other side, no
But I didn't want to build the land that has fed you your whole life, no
Don't you find it funny?


[Refrain]
You made my bed, dealt with it when the lights went out
Now looking back for temporary nothings
But I bet on it, you'll all be here when the lights come out
Still looking for nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave it all I got to know now
I don't want no part of it no longer, no longer
Looked around this place enough to know now
I don't want to waste the time to know you, to know you

[Chorus]
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me

[Bridge]
I don't wanna, wanna, wanna wait
I don't wanna, wanna, wanna wait

[Chorus]
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
