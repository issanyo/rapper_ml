[Intro: Sample from The Network]
(We know the air is unfit to breathe
And our food is unfit to eat
We sit watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be
We know things are bad, worse than bad.)

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
They say the world’s coming to an end, homie I don’t care
Bullet proof in my closet that I don’t wear
Niggas talk behind my back as if I won’t hear
Back against the ropes like I won’t dare
Bitch I don’t tear
I know too many niggas facing 25 to life
I know too many ain’t make to 25 in life
Too many look up to me, I’m who they idolize
No soap opera, I ain't your Guiding Light
Worry bout my car and the kit, what up Michael Knight
I bared my all, you would think I’m bout to die tonight
I’m trying not to get stuck, lifestyle of a Trojan
It mean I’m tryna not to get fucked, what up

[Hook]
World keeps spinning as the drama unfolds
I’ll be in the front row
When it all implodes
(I don't have to tell you things are bad
Everybody knows things are bad
It's a depression.)
I got a pocket full of money and a room full of hoes
I’ma have a blast when it, when it all implodes
(Everybody's out of work
A dollar buys a nickel's worth
Punks are running wild in the street
There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do
And there's no end to it.)

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
They say the world’s coming to an end, I find it funny
Cause mine is just beginning
Mine is full of women
Mine's like a roller coaster
But I slow up the ride
Then they get sick to they stomach
But all they could throw up is pride
You talking bout a recession that I cordially ignore
Fuck a dollar if you morally poor
R R R all y'all adore and see is royalty
Nevermind income, spoil me with loyalty
It’s too many fake niggas, not enough real
There's too many emcees, not enough deals
Too many broke, when there's too many bills
Too many ways to attain wealth
Fuck a poor economy, blame yourself
Guess we can’t all leave the hood just rapping
They say society is twisted like it just happened
Nigga, I call bogusness
So if you fucked up, probably cause you just noticed it

[Hook]
(They're crazy
Just like everything, everywhere is going crazy
So we don't go out anymore.)
(We sit in the house
Slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller
And all we say is
'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.')

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
They say the world’s coming to an end
Now everybody got a complaint
Everybody trying live like they some kind type of saint
Only nigga not trying to be something I ain't
That ain't the picture I paint
And if I did it’d be stained
Life’s a bitch, I’m fully ready to meet her
I’ll be in my best fit, I’ma have the fresh caesar
Since I’m eager, be in the room, dusting off the heater
Have a fully loaded 40 pointed at her when I meet her
Take her to the hood, gunpoint, bitch don’t tempt me
Force her eyes open, look at lives, vacant, empty
No wonder that they shower me with hatred and envy
I’ve picked the wrong nigga couldn't make it against me
Fuck your healthcare, health scare
Even though I’m well aware
Counting down till I pull the trigger, like hell yeah
I be the last time you impose
Legs crossed with my cig lit
Now watch it all implode

[Hook]

[Outro: Sample from The Network]
(I don't want you to protest
I don't want you to riot
I don't want you to write to your congressman
Because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write
I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the crime in the street
All I know is that first
You've got to get mad
You've got to say
'I'm a HUMAN BEING, GOTDAMMIT! My life has VALUE!')
(I want you to get up now
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs
I want you to get up right now and go to the window
Open it, and stick your head out, and yell
'I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'm NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!')
