[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
She wanna go through my phone
I'm guessin' she wanna be all alone
She must have forgot that I'm an R&B singer
She must have forgot she dealin' with a real nigga
She wanna be Sherlock Holmes
She must not know that she could be gone
She must have forgot that I'm an R&B singer
She must have forgot she dealin' with a cold nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Hope she found what she was looking for
'Cause she traded in love, she traded in trust for that bullshit
Hope she found what she was searching for
'Cause we was all good 'til she wanted to pull that bullshit

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
These are the pro's and cons, I'ma give 'em to you
These are the ups and downs, I'ma sing 'em to you
This the shit that you can expect
When you dealin' with a real R&B singer
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
When you dealin' with a real R&B singer

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
See, every time I do a show
Or make an appearance on the radio
I meet another fan with a plan
And head back to the telly just to see what it's hittin' for
And baby. I swear, I'm sorry
But it comes with the territory
Lookin' like this and soundin' like this, with a body like this
She was bound to be pissed

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
These are the pro's and cons, I'ma give 'em to you
These are the ups and downs, I'ma sing 'em to you
This the shit that you can expect
When you dealin' with a real R&B singer
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
When you dealin' with a real R&B singer

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Let's get a few things tucked away
I seen your ex, don't act like this ain't an upgrade
It's just real, I don't mean to alarm you
But if you take the pro's then you gotta take the cons too
'Cause if your man really that poppin'
Don't be shocked when you learn that he really has options
You come home seein' parked new Ferraris
Like a cool sorority, fueled by pool parties
Somethin' to do when there's nothin' to do
But we a couple for a reason, they ain't got nothin' on you
One day I'll dead 'em all, be the mortician
You keep playin' your part, I'll never need to audition
But you my baby, you could get the world
Durin' threesomes, I'll even let you pick the girl
Love how you in love with me
I'll put you up for puttin' up with me
But understand somethin'

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
These are the pro's and cons, I'ma give 'em to you
These are the ups and downs, I'ma sing 'em to you
This the shit that you can expect
When you dealin' with a real R&B singer
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
From an R&B, nigga
When you dealin' with a real R&B singer

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
I mean, you can't expect me to be singing to these women and not respond to my talent, know what I'm saying? I don't really know how I can explain it. You'll learn
