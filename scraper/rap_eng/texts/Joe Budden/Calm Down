[Intro]
Calm down... calm down...
Baby just calm down...
(Calm down...)
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
Baby just calm down...
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(She would pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
Calm down...

[Joe Budden]
Look, I was such a lost soul, just wanted to be down with something
Look at your son now mommy I amounted to something
You couldn't figure out, what I had messed with the streets for
Cause you saw my genius without a SAT score
I took drugs and laced it with things
But you a addict yourself
For you I was people places and things (how the fuck you thought)
Angeldust use to have me in the hallways twurked
I tried to hide it, but Visine didn't always work
I needed someone to blame in my mind
I thought if you and dad never used dope I would a came out fine
And so I igged you hard when you threw in advice
Like what I want to talk to you about you ruined my life
You the reason why I ended up a con and I knew it
The reason I filled my body with that bomin fluid, mommy
You the reason that my life's gone illegal
The reason I'm kinda different, don't think like normal people, not calm

[Hook]
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(Use to pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(You got to understand what I was going through)
Baby just calm down...
Everything's gonna be alright
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(But a nigga wouldn't) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all

[Joe Budden]
Listen... ain't shit like seeing your moms crying on the floor
Knowing you the reason why she ain't alright no more
But so young, I was like whatever
You use to chase me through the house with the knife like get your life together
Fucking drugs, how could I ever amp on you
And what made me think that I could lay my hands on you
I'm not surprised that you mad at me
Much as you hated my father, your youngest son is just like his daddy
Mommy I live life rude, how could you not understand it
On the same note I'm just like you
I got moms sensitivity, my fathers balls
His humor, his g, yet my heart is yours
Fuck school, cause I had my major
Come to grips that it ain't so much the drugs, it's the addict behavior (no)
Wasn't the dip jar, it's the cut that came with it
Wasn't really the smoking, but the rush that came with it (wasn't calm people)

[Hook]
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Calm down...
(but a nigga wouldn't) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
(do it with me people) Calm down...
Calm down...
(try to understand it) Baby just calm down...
(those kind of things) Everything's gonna be alright
Calm down... (just bare with me for a... for a brief moment y'all)
Calm down...
Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all

[Joe Budden]
I felt so alone, I had a crew, but so what
Then when Angela stabbed me guess who showed up
And when people said I'd always be ill and twisted
And when the therapist had told us that the pills would fix it
Was sick of being sick, I was finally hurt
With all the praying that you did ma, it finally worked
God gave you a son back, I won't offend you again
Won't let the disease turn me against you again
Use to be high as ever, (but I) Joey Jr. got his life together
As a result, now we tighter than ever
So blessed, so grateful to be seeing tomorrow (see the whole world)
That's why I can't take a drink, not if even a swallow
I can't picture me twisted, like what I'm a do now
Haters I can't stop yet, my mothers to proud
Secure now, don't need to be down with nothing
Look at your son now mommy, I amounted to something
I'm so calm

[Hook]
Calm down...
Calm down...
(but a nigga wouldn't calm down) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all (hold up)
She use to tell me to... calm down...
(Use to pray that I would) calm down...
(But I couldn't, I couldn't, couldn't do it) Baby just calm down...
(Nothing heals like time people) Everything's gonna be alright
(Understand that) calm down...
Calm down...
(Fucking miracle) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
(They said I wouldn't reach 21 y'all... I'm still standing)

Calm down...
Thanks ma...
Calm down...
I couldn't do it without you
Calm down...
Calm down...
You are appreciated
Calm down...
Fa sho...
Calm down...
It's a slow process y'all
One day at a time though... to get beautiful
