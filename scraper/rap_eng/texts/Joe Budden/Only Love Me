Hey, God forbid they let the beat stop
Cause I know they only love me when the beat drop (AYO!)
Hey, I hope they never let the beat stop
Cause I know y'all only love me when the beat drop

I hope they never let the beat stop (Why?!)
Cause them bitches only love me when the beat drop
God forbid they let the beat stop
Cause I know that niggas love me when the beat stop (Blaow!)

[Verse 1: Sikai]
You done met your match, you should go meet ya maker
Name attached to the to the job, Bob The Builder, John The Baker Kai the sick 1 in this inner city
I blow a pretty penny, so I get attention from the pretty bitties
Ain't nobody lookin at you niggas, really ain't nobody scared
Of a chump, punk, pussy, 15 minute career
Get the hell up out of here, homie this is longevity
Ol' heads, younger kids and grown folks tellin me
Highway dreamin, like the A beside the letter B
Got my shit together on the plane where I fell asleep
First class, front row, put me in the better seats
And get my girl the latest shit, cause she deserves the better things
Life is like that mocking bird, told that bitch she better sing
Money and the cars look at all this shit that better bring
Meet me at the alter with the pastor and the wedding rings
I will give my first, my last, baby my everything

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sikai]
It's a shame man, they told me not to hit em hard
French told me niggas don't want nothin more than 12 bars
They just want the hottest hook, ain't lookin if you from the heart
I'm looking for these bitches,I got it in me to do em all
Come and get a nigga up, long hair don't even care
But short cut don't give a fuck, baby yes I take it there
Nowadays they listen to anything that they playin
I don't hold back for nothin, eventually I just say
Either love it or they hate it, I swear they gotta kill me
All my ups and downs but you'll notice that I'm still me
Psychological shit, I told you this is real deep
Quotables for your facebook statuses and your little tweets
All over the internet, you gone drop the ball and allow me to intercept
See I'm catching on the ways of the world
Just at the way I might shine if my instrumental were to last for a lifetime

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Now she wanna call and come through for whatever I wanna do
Wasn't for that mic check, 1,2 would that be untrue
Now all the jokes are funnier than what they would be
Even though they heard the music, niggas never understood me
Aware of what I'm dealing with, got superior focus
Got experience dealing with ulterior motives
A couple OGs gave me sound advice, told me fuck the world and adapt to what I'm surrounded by
Never live timidly, I don't fuck with gimmicks B
Damn right I changed, my advice would be to mimic me
Born to persevere, every move I make relentlessly
Still I got inferior niggas that wanna finish me
Time is money, we got nothing to converse about
No energy to cures em out, I'll stop when that hearse is out
Even when I'm gone, my spirit'll keep reppin
The music'll live forever, when you hear it keep steppin Muhfucka!
