I'm 'bout to say some shit to you
(Oh baby)
I might need you to answer back (Top)
Bad enough that the mic give me feedback
(Ohh baby, Ohh)
I ain't gotta come home and see that
(Top) Let me talk to you for a minute
(I wanna know, I wanna know yeah, yeah)
Still regular!

(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
You'll be my baby, baby

[Joe Budden & Lil' Mo]
Let me talk to 'em
First off, all the questionin', I thought we was above that
We got some time and act like you isn't sure of that
C'mon don't tell me that we already endin'
And fuck I need to cheat on you for? I'm already winnin'
It's like (I wanna know) if I gotta exit them tensions
Callin' her names, tryin' to make her feel like less of a woman
But nah, picture eye shady, hook, line, say I duck fly
Once or twice maybe, forever you my lady my
You gorgeous but, it's more than just your hips that talk
Your strut, let's stall this for one more
It's how we laugh, you know shall we not
My better half slash your eyes the vibe we got, it's like
(I wanna know)
If I'm reelin' and kneelin'
And then, she wanna know if I feel how she feelin'
And real when I'm dealin', please believe boo
Won't deceive you, it's not just a want, I need you

[Hook: Lil' Mo & Joe Budden]
I wanna know if you'll always be my baby
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Joe Budden & Lil' Mo]

(I wanna know)
If I'm at some other broad's
Laughin' in bed, she got it all mapped in her head
Ma, I'm all about you and me
But you slowly losin' me when you keep accusin' me
I know why you be askin' where I came from
Nothin' wrong with arguin', but we havin' the same ones
Either you gon' ride out or you gon' spoil it
Either you gon' take a shit or get up off of the toilet
It's like
(I wanna know)
I wanna know
If I be lyin' to her
Or if I think these other birds finer than her, so
So when your man's on the road, he don't see you
I don't want the sex to be the only thing that keeps you
I give you my all, just holla at me if you want more
You tired of hearin 'bout me talkin 'bout a jump off
You my girl, my wiz, my life
(Oh baby)
Ma we can't go wrong ma, listen to the horns, ma

Out of all the women in the world, why her?
Hold up, now, you gettin' mad at yourself
Just take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself
How many times I gotta tell you, boo, you all that I got
How many times I gotta tell you, be secure in your spot
I understand so I can't knock it, but I'm your man, stop it
Checkin' my two way, and goin' through my pants pockets
It's no need, you my girl, my wiz, my life
Look ma, you my heart, my all, my wife
And you pissed 'cause you know other chicks would love to smash your man
I tell 'em I'm aight, I take pride in that I'm your man
My friends keep tellin' me you ain't shit

Long as we know what we got, we can carry on boo
We can't go wrong ma, listen to the horns ma
