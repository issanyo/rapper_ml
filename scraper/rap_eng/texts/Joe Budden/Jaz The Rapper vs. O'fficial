[Round 1: Jaz The Rapper]
Y’all smell that?
Irving Plaza, did y’all clean up?
I ain’t tryna play y’all crew
But I caught a body here last year-
Oh, shit, this feelin’ like deja vu
A lot of y’all gon’ be upset tonight, especially those who came in with you
‘Cause word to Muva, this gon’ be a ugly body...and it is O’fficial
Me battling you gon’ help you out: bitch, I been official
Whoever ridin’ with Jessica Fisher gon’ be swimmin’ with the fishes wit’ you
Pardon me if I’m wrong, but...your name is Jessica Fisher, right?
Smack, is money on her head? ‘Cause I’m not the one to toy with
Tell me what’s Fisher price (Fischer-Price)!
I’ll dump her in a lake
Y’all gon’ need fishermen to get Fisher out
But I only left the bones…’cause when you eat fish, you supposed to pick them out
Bitch, I’m a menace! Somebody shoulda told y’all
If the bitch die, I’ll go about my day: I am so raw
I’ll go to McDonald’s, get a number 2, small fries, and my Coke large
Then be like, “Anybody want this cheeseburger?”...all after I get O dogged! (O-Dawg)
If y’all don’t remember how I does this, good, I’mma remind you
It’s been a year since I been here, I had a good time, too
If y’all loved me last time, tonight, I’m that times two
I work on my time to address bullshit when it’s time to...and it’s time to!
Aye, yo, Earl…nah, I’m playin’
I hope security turned his ass around
‘Cause he make every single one of my opponents choke
And it make haters not wanna give Jaz the crown
So I told him, “Chill today”, y’all, ‘cause this shit is gettin’ drasti-
Yo...see, he acting up already! Ain’t her go yet! I’M rapping now!
You see, I always get slept on, and that’s the problem, nigga
‘Cause I’m usually the first nigga to go nuts: George Washington Carver, nigga!
Look, she arrived ready to throw it in, ‘cause I’mma come with wild heaters
She came to the ring with the towel: she Val Venis!
Let’s talk about bars, though
‘Cause in that area...you might be neck-and-neck to me
But I plan every detail of my murders, down to what gun I want your head to meet
So I pass the doc, trash the Glock, and now the feds think they ahead of me
But I’m off the hook
I can’t get charged twice with gettin’ rid of a .40: that’s double jeopardy!
I got more bars than lifers, and you couldn’t take a day in the joint
And this round a line segment: I’mma get straight to the point
I get your type strangled, and watch your life dangle
I don’t know why they wouldn’t think I’ll leave you diced, mangled
C3 and Couture picked you apart
Our hands might tangle
‘Cause yeah, our lines meet, but you gotta take the right angle!
All you do is gun bar punchlines
To beat me, you gotta rap with some substance or somethin’
You Tre from Boyz n the Hood
You gon’ be…(*grunts*) Motherfu-
Doin’ all that punchin’ for nothin’!
Yeah, that shit cool, but vers’ my style, that don’t fly, Jess
You food, and once I break you down, you gon’ die, Jess
‘Cause your delivery’s A-1, and like a stuffy nose, you gotta sound sick
But like reinforcements on a ripped loose-leaf, you gotta make sure them rounds stick!
This is my court, so you should know the drill
This is do-or-die
And the fact that you gotta touch these lines make it harder...doin’ suicides!
And I noticed you like to call out dykes so you could kill ‘em
And vers’ Prophet and Lexx, I agree, you did it well
But why you ain’t kill that dyke with the big butt?
Something’s off to I, so now, she gon’ get a L
What, I gotta put it in PG Step?
That spells “O’fficial”
Something’s OFF, TWO I’s, A, L
Peep, she’s like, “No, it don’t”
But who wouldn’t?
Stupid, I know that...but I took C out ‘cause you couldn’t
So how you killin’ me!?
Them OK bitches you slayed not enough
Y’all got her thinkin’ she nice in 2K, but she playing with the game sliders up!
They got you gassed up, O’fficial!
You look nice...just keep that fat tucked, O’fficial
Don’t act tough, O’fficial
Or we gon’ need a replacement ref if you don’t back up, O’fficial!
‘Cause I’mma send you to the Saints, where you could really get your city repped
When I drew the 9, she felt the breeze against her neck
BAH! Shots from the Glock I could give, except
I’mma talk crazy to O’fficial, just so I could get the TEC!
Look at your swag, ma! You don’t even fit in
Smack don’t even know you: he almost charged you to get in!
I said, “Smack, I want this bitch on NOME”
I made sure to tell him you good
He said, “Who?”
I said, “O’fficial”
He said, “Who?”
I said, “O’fficial”
He said, “Who?”
“The one with the titties”
He said, “Oh, Suge?”
I said, “No! The bitch with the titties!”
He said, “Oh, Goodz!”
Aye, yo, K-Shine!
You was mad me and Nellz said Wavy would beat you?
He- he beat you!
And you thought both us bitches drunk?
Well, as far as you vers’ Verb, both you niggas washed, and both you niggas suck!
First round, bars!
Second round, bars!
Third round, I’mma regret puttin’ yo’ dumb ass on this card

[Round 1: O’fficial]
If y’all don’t remember how I does this, it’s cool, I’mma remind you
I went from C3 to Jaz the Rapper in a year, I had good times, too
If y’all fucked with her versus 40, tonight, I’m that times two
But you take too much time to address bullshit when it’s time to…
Well, it’s my time, too!
Now you came to New Orleans, and they was like, “Jaz is here!”
We made sure nothing happened to you
All I seen in yo’ ass was fear
But you made it back to New York safe...now the gas is here
So, basically, New Orleans is the only reason that Jaz is here!
This cat don’t talk when rats around: Tom and Jerry
Test me, my dude watching: I got the proctor ready
Cock the Dezzi? Jaz, you can stop already
Pop a gun!? You too afraid to even POP YA CHERRY!!!
But let me catch your boys in the hood, and they gon’ get the Tommy
And Jaz, you gon’ get the 12-gauge like Ricky...try me!
Or end up in a wheelchair like Little Chris
You can pick the body
I’m basically askin’ what treatment you want: RICKY BAKER, OR RICKY BOBBY!?
I said, my 9’ll get every quarter back: I call it my Drew Brees pistol
And y’all already know what happened: once I drew, Brees picked you
Let’s see if you still cold once this Brees hit you
I ain’t tryna talk...but I’m ‘bout to shoot the Brees with you!
And you be dick-riding all these battle leagues like it’s a hobby now
But if it wasn’t for Queen of the Ring hoppin’ ‘round, bitch, you wouldn’t be poppin’ now!
So don’t say you where you at ‘cause of URL: you swappin’ now
‘Cause in reality, you ain’t get on SMACK until after the Ring: you BOBBY BROWN!
I’ll give this bitch 200 bucks if you pass Go
It’s not a game: I’m takin’ everything she has, bro (Hasbro)!
Can’t believe y’all said she’d beat me...I’m glad, though
Watch every round: I’ll trump Jaz(z) like Satchmo
The bars I add dishin’ out a bigger fight
We can multiply these shots, long as the clip in right
Since she throwin’ subs, I’mma subtract this bitch’s life
She’ll be lyin’ between two dots if the vision right!
Talkin’ about you make bitches choke ‘cause you know voodoo
Well, I’m from New Orleans: bitch, I do, too!
And I’ll let somethin’ spiritual teach ya, and I ain’t talkin’ guru
So I called up my great-granny, and she gave me the Hoodoo
And that’s, “If I choke, this bird getting clocked cuckoo!”
Then the ratchet behind Jaz with an ugly butt: THAT’S NUNU!
And, boy, I seen your twerk video: that was just wrong
Jaz, you kept moving back like you missed home!
So I’m the only one that think Jaz fuckin’? Is it me?
Stop kidding me!
Since you wanna play “good girl”, good, girl: you can get the heat
I’m calm, but my piece full: that’s serenity
So when y’all see Jaz lyin’, she ain’t talkin’ ‘bout her virginity!
But I heard you know how to “work the mic without holdin’ back”
So I guess the best Jaz(z) music is when she blowin’ sacks (sax’)!
Talkin’ about if I ever have kids, they’ll never go hungry, ‘cause my tits so large
Well, I guess, with that flat-ass chest, bitch, yo’ kids gon’ starve!
Yeah, my titties big, but your head wider
No wonder at NHB, you was the headliner
And it’s cool if you say I can’t spell either
Because lookin’ at your name, bitch, yo’ mama can’t spell neither
‘Cause she spelled your name with a J when you came out her placenta
Well, like your moms, I’m ‘bout to take the G outta Majenta!
You look like growin’ up, you never finished any of your meals, bitch
This lane I came emergin’, see, (emergency) everybody I kill switch
How she gon’ give me the pops she never had: Uncle Phil shit!?
If I give Jaz(z) 5, she gon’ snap back: I’m Will Smith!
So please don’t let this gas back you
And if you rockin’ with Jaz, fuck you!
‘Cause I use instruments when these hands touch you
That mean I’mma get Jaz(z) beat with some brass knuckles!
And before I go, let me ask y’all: Is Jaz a cunt, or what?
Aye, Norbes, 3-0, I should get Debo to FUCK YOU UP!
FIRST ROUND, PERSONALS!
SECOND ROUND, BARS!
THIRD ROUND, Y’ALL GON’ REGRET PUTTIN’ THIS BITCH ON Y’ALL CARD!
FLATLINE!

[Round 2: Jaz The Rapper]
Fans say Couture, Hart, even Tori’ll kill me, like I’m not the shit
That’s like a nigga writin’ a song to his girl: ain’t that ‘bout a bitch?
I said I wanted O’fficial next, I ain’t even have to write a lick
Caterpillar comin’ out the cocoon: I knew it was gon’ be a new body from the rip!
Now I’m ‘bout to say somethin’, if y’all don’t agree, then call me a big liar
But niggas said you look like Bunkie from Empire!
But anyway, I heard you don’t like Jaz(z)
Me neither...I’m more of a blues and swing fan
5’3”, punches hit like I’m 6’8”: check my wingspan
I took this fight soon as they brought it forward to a god (guard)
I’mma swing, man (swingman)!
Smack the reason that you got this box: he your wingman!
They said, “Why you wanted to do this in a small room?”
I wanted to do something y’all would not expect
And besides, I ain’t wanna take the show from Clips or Hollow
I woulda stole NOME like Project X!
But soak it all up, ‘cause in this limelight, I’mma need you to bask, O (Tabasco): I’m hot
And you remind me of Jay-Z, ‘cause you gettin’ your name from Jaz, O
That threw y’all for a loop, aye (Lupe)
What’s the fee? Ask O (Fiasco)
Her life, one bitch tied the rope around her neck, but...that was just the last, O (lasso)
Fans said this would be debatable!
They won’t know whether I won or you won
Real shit, the only thing that’s gon’ be debated is whether I beat you 3-0, or 2-1!
Matter fact, make ‘em vote
I bet I’ll kill it on the poll (pole) like Mimi
I been (Ben) savage, you just live around ‘em: you Mr. Feeny!
Last round, you had all these gun bars, and you said I can’t do it
But you call yourself the Gun Bar Queen?
Sorry, bitch, I’m deadin’ that
‘Cause you told a nigga you’ll watch his whole squad move when your machete clap
That’s what y’all doin’ out there? ‘Cause your mans reacted like that was fine
Shit, I’m scared of these New Orleans niggas…
They not clappin’ .9’s, they clappin’ knives!
Clappin’ machetes is not a threat
Clearly you don’t know your shit
That’s like me saying, “These hoes better watch out, before I pull that Glock out...and start to poke a bitch.
Don’t laugh! I’ll do it! I’ll do it!”
You can’t be fuckin’ up like that! You a NOLA goon!
If O’fficial got two G’s strapped up, we thinkin’ it’s some tools involved
But really, if O’fficial got two G’s strapped up, it’s a super-bra!
Or if O’fficial put a round in the air, we think it’s somebody gettin’ slumped off
But really, it’s O’fficial put a round in the air, it’s a jump ball!
All I hear is “Flatline this, Flatline that”
Y’all Flatline niggas gon’ ride for her?
Good luck with tryin’ to help the bitch
‘Cause I got a clip so long - ask me how long
(How long?)
That shit look like a selfie stick!
So tell your crew come, baby
But they better do a 180
I got one .80 that get Flatline flat-lined ‘cause a flat line is 180
