[Joe Budden]
Uh, Neyo, Jump off
Let me talk to y'all, look
Joey got the top down with my arm around
Used to be the biggest flirt 'til you caught me down
You the drug I'm addicted to
It's not just the face on the physical
Or cause your waist is invisible
Sized up your finger, might cop the igloo
Put the whole club on pause when I get smooth (oh)
You that chick cause I actually dig you
Know I'm that dude cause I actually picked you
Keep you lookin' fresh, Louis would never miss you
Birds get so sick any time they see me with you
By my side, cause in you I take pride
Get you the Benz keys, take your girl for a ride
Besides, it's gettin past that
Maybe because baby strong where I lack at
Now let's fly, let's get these seats reclined blasting Neo soul
But never mind, I'm just saying stuff that we both know
Let's go

[Neyo]
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch, and I erupt like a volcano
And cover her with my love
Baby girl, you make me say, ooh

And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
Baby, when we do our thing (when we do the things we do, ooh)
Baby girl you make me say (ooh), oh

Sexy love, girl the things you do
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
Ooh I love making love to you, ooh
Baby girl you know you're my sexy love

I'm so addicted to her, she's the sweetest drug
Just enough, still too much
Say that I'm slipping, I'm sprung on love be above
I can't help she makes me say ooh

And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
Then to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
Oh, when we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
Baby girl you make me say (ooh)
My sexy love

Sexy love, girl the things you do
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
Ooh I love making love to you, ooh
Baby girl you know you're my sexy love

Oh, baby what we do, it makes the sun come up
And keep on lovin' til it goes back down
And I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose your touch
That's why I'm always keeping you around
My sexy love

Sexy love, girl the things you do
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
Ooh I love making love to you, ooh
Baby girl you know you're my sexy love

Sexy love, girl the things you do
Keep me sprung, keep me running back to you
Ooh I love making love to you, ooh
Baby girl you know you're my sexy love

She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch
