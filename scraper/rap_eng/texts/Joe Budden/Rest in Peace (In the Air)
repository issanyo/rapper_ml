[Verse]
I know my dead homies watching upon us
But uh, I ain't gotta know a nigga to mourn
To see a real nigga crying is torture
Get the candles and the drinks, we gon' have our own wake on the corner
You could just vision (what?) all of the memories
Hennessy guzzlin' and you buggin' (why?,) because you was just with him
God called for his son, it was time
You got a beef with the Lord, wish you just saw 'im just one last time
Some think that nuttin' about it is good
He got what every nigga dreams of, he's out of the hood
So why we all sit in the hood cryin' liquor
He's in heaven laughing like, "Look at my niggas
They all sobbing, them tears ain't stopping
God, throw 'em a sign that let 'em know I'm watching
Time passes and things get poppin'
Like he woulda wanted, if he was here that woulda been his option
It's back to old times as if he just popped in
If you had to take somebody, Jesus, not him
All my real niggas put a lighter in the air
There's a fighter in the air, that cloud right there
And I know my time is comin' like
Everybody elses, (but) but by then
I hope that everybody felt this, always that one
Hateful nigga make it seem like everybody's jealous
Somebody here don't like me breathin'
I know somebody here's tryna spite me steamin'
'Spite how I ride these sprees and dap me
Goin' to projects at the end of the night, I'm leavin'
One of my old mans who's now burnt out
Might off me, never know how things turn out
'Cause even your close friends'll steal ya
Come to think of it, I could be real cool with my po—tential killer
That's called taking the bitter with the sweet
The skip with the verse, the gift with the curse
Somebody wants to see the kid in a hearse
But I'd die for this rap shit, clips will disperse
Kill for this rap shit, it gets reversed
Murder you lethal, (so) so don't watch
If the convertible bleeds you
Take your pick with the clips, how you want it: reversible or see-through?
I be another locked dog in the fort
And another wake on the corner will be all my fault
Another body inside the Caddy
That'll make my moms right, 'cause I'll be in jail just like daddy
Daddy come home, somethin' ain't right
I think the Lord 'bout to call 'pon Uncle Mike
Mike got high and he wasn't too strong
Doc said he got cancer and it wouldn't be long
Said in another six-months he'll be gone
Pops still play that one gospel song e'ry morn'
Stopped gettin' high, so it's no more pipe
And they found medicine that would extend his life
Years pass and Mike's still here, he's not hurt
Gospel song e'ry morn', it's funny how God works
Wait! He's got the disease, he's different again
He's starting to get sick and shit's missing again
Now that monthly cheque he's spending again
Goddamn Uncle Mike is sniffing again
Dad, Mike's sprung and God put the cancer in his lungs
Like, "Fuck that cure, you had a choice"
Disease is so cunning when you trippin' high
You can't throw away the gift of life, nigga, you take it or leave it
Nigga play it to keep it, nigga, sacred, treat it
'Cause if the Lord come take it you heed it
No funeral homes, not for you
And I don't really wanna visit in the hospital
Don't wanna see you like that, 'cause I'ma be too scared
I'd rather meet my own demise and meet you there
God, I can't make pretend
At least take me first, so I ain't gotta see you take my friends
Some things I can't even figure, like why you have to take him for?
Come on, God, answer me, nigga
Another tattoo, another name sprayed
On the back window of the car for a month
Another family shattered, in tears
Another night on my knees with a new name added to my prayers
Of all the things we still feelin', 'cause on a nice day
When the sky's clear I almost see y'all staring
Extend your arm, take this pound
To all my lost soldiers in the booth with me while I lay this down
C'mon

[Chorus: Phil Collins (Sampled)]
And I can feel it
Coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well I’ve been waiting for this moment
For all my—
