[Intro]
It's ya muh'fuckin' boy (yeah)
"Jump Off" Joe Budden here
Clinton Sparks we gon' get familiar with it
We gon' get familiar together, matter fact, Boston stand up
Jers' stand up
Sparks, holla at ya boy
It's, it's, it's
It's that on top music!

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes to find a way (oh, oh)
To find a way, to find a way (oh)
I'ma do whatever it takes to find a way (you know)
To find a way, to find a way
I'ma do whatever it takes to find a way ([?] fire)
To find a way, to find a way ([?] I got the soul of a fighter)
Whatever it takes to find a way (walk barefoot over the coal over fire)
To find a way, to find a way

[Verse]
All right
I'm dealin' with some shit, homie, it's in the back of my head
And it's some shit, homie, but I just rap it instead
See I got Wolverine's bones in me, but the whole world's throwin' stones at me
Like they all got a bone with me
Got a child's mother, and I hate her to death
But that's my child's mother, so that's my mate to the death
It's wild how I love her (for) for puttin' little me here
And me and her can beef forever, she gon' still be there
Then there's some other niggas, I judged their character wrong
But they some other niggas, now let's get back to the song
I got a drug problem that I ain't tended to
Because I got enough problems, and my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to PCP and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately, but nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately, I'm sorta feelin' repressed lately
So y'all been hearin' and seein' me less lately
Like 'has anyone noticed the regress lately?'
Look deep, nigga, don't I seem stressed lately?
Seem disturbed, lot of regrets lately
Got a company that I'm signed to
But they ain't in my company when all I need is some company
When I start feelin like e'rybody's done with me
They're tryna see what e'rybody want with me
Then the mistress, yeah, the girl from "10 Minutes," it's her
Now I'm needin ten minutes from her
I can't get into it, but I want y'all to know
That I'll get into it, but I'll save that for The Growth
And there's rap beef, but I'm so secure with me
It's only rap beef, I don't need security (never)
Wanna get at me? Wanna go to war with me?
That's just one phone call for me, check the shit
I got a whole hood (that what?) that don't appreciate me
But it's not the whole hood that depreciates me (okay)
What you gon' tell me when it's the streets that made me?
And I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
And they just crap critics, they say all I make is dance music
But to almost anything you can dance, stupid
They ain't like the single (nah), so they ain't copped the album
Wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it (nah)
They say he whines too much (and) he's too bitter (and)
They call it complainin', (but) I call it explainin' (y'know)
How normal niggas could get caught up in the game and
Lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
There's some shit with me, but dudes been knew that
But I'm gamblin' a lot and I ain't used to do that (I didn't) (nah)
Rap ain't payin' the bills, it's mo' money mo' problems
Or it's no money mo' problems
All enormous when you play at these stakes
That's how it feel to have a warrant on a famous face
Then the album pushed back, 'cause they say he need a single
At the moment, but what he needs is a single moment
Then I'm involved in the he say, she say
(That's) In my mind on replay, each day
(Then) Then it's the bullshit that she say he's gay
'Cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her
Just 'cause she was throwin' it at me and I ain't touch her
She'll say anything 'side from I ain't wanna fuck her (nah)
I don't feel good, so I don't wanna go to a club
Don't wanna go to a lounge, just wanna lounge (I just wanna lounge)
In the same sweats that I had on for days
Same tee I had on for a week, what I got on it speaks
What I got on, it reeks
No shape up, chillin', 'cause that's just how I'm feelin'
And one day at a time, it's God willin'
(See I'm) Tryna see straight but the fog keeps buildin'
Pulse start racin', the bulls startin' to hate me
But I gotta be a king, 'cause there's wolves tryna play me
Hoodie when it's hot like it's freezin' winter
Rap star, eating sleep for dinner
And it's hard tryna keep this in ya, so I write it all down
So one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember
Then it's probation, I know we all go through it
We call it probation, but there's no pro to it
Yeah, my soul's achin', only a few peers know
Funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
Had some shit going on with my *cough* (woah) that felt good, but it's bad
So I'm sittin' here like, "What the bitch had"
It's not rap it's real, look scrappy, it's true
Go on whatspoppin, do he (I) look happy to you? (nah)
Now if it goes to the wire, go the soul of a fighter
Bruised up and sloppy, or damaged like Ali
Up late talkin' to the fans on a website
That's the only thing that send your man off to bed right
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl!
Well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm
This too won't last, this too shall pass
At least that's what I say y'all, that's what I pray for
And I'm the only thing that's standin in my way y'all
But I gotta be with me, there's no escape y'all
I guess depression just stepped in
And took over shit like it's known to do
Guess it said, "Hey Joe, I'm goin' home with you
Turn your phone off, I need to be alone with you
I need to be in the zone with you
'Cause I'm the only thing you're prone to, nigga, look, I own you, nigga
Been with you since ten, but you startin' to confuse me
'Cause it's been so long and you still tryna lose me
Like, how could you show me such cruelty
When everybody turns their back on you, Joe? It's you and me
Joe, you don't want me to see you, right?
Tgeb why you always come get me, how we reunite, huh?
I know you feel for me deep in your heart
Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart
But now you got a deal and you wanna get rid of me
We roommates, I'm in your head, Joe, you live with me"
So I don't write for the fans, nah, I write to my man
In hopes that he'll just leave and understand
Like, like please leave the kid in peace
Let me smoke this one cig' in peace (just give me ten minutes)
Just leave for a second, man, it's been too long and I can't troop it
And long as you around I can't make that dance music

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes to find a way (oh)
To find a way, to find a way (oh, oh)
I'ma do whatever it takes to find a way
To find a way, to find a way ([?])
I'ma do whatever it takes to find a way
To find a way, to find a way
Whatever it takes to find a way
To find a way, to find a way
