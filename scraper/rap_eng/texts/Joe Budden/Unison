[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
You be tryna play shit cool
I watch your eyes, you undress her
And when we be chilling by that pool
New bikini's on, trying to impress her
You and me ain't got no rules
Nah mean, no pressure
Drinks keep spilling, we can all keep chilling
Don't worry about me, I won't catch feelings

[Refrain: Joe Budden]
But you ain't gotta act it, clearly you attracted
It's much more than her style
I see the way that you're looking at her
It's more like you're staring her down
Looking at her tan line, long hair, tell me what go wrong here
We could bring her back right now
You'll put her lips on your face, I can grab you by the waist
If you really about that

[Chorus: Joe Budden & Emanny]
Now let’s make love in unison
No one gets excluded then
And we can do it
However, whenever, wherever
It ain’t cheating if we doing it together
Together

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Backseat on a road trip
Fogging all the windows up in the truck
As you touch her everywhere on her body that you like to be touched
And with the sounds that y'all making
Make me wanna come closer
There's a rest stop two miles ahead
But I can’t wait that long to pull over

[Refrain: Joe Budden]
You ain't gotta act it, clearly you attracted
It's much more than her style
I see the way that you're looking at her
It's more like you're staring her down
Looking at her tan line, long hair, tell me what go wrong here
We could bring her back right now
You'll put her lips on your face, I can grab you by the waist
If you really about that

[Chorus: Joe Budden & Emanny]
Let’s make love in unison
No one gets excluded then
And we can do it
However, whenever, wherever
It ain’t cheating if we doing it together
Together, together

[Bridge: Emanny]
We can cross this road together
Watch the night explode with pleasure
Just don’t let things change your way
And I did the same, the same
We can cross this road together
Watch the night explode with pleasure
Just don’t let things change your way
And I did the same, the same

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Here go', look
Most times she the catalyst, fan of ass and his
She'll hit the club with me to see who get the badder bitch
And I'm a straight man, I'd never be mad at it
It's actually the opposite, I be tryna keep track of it
Picture me in the back of it, telling y'all relax a bit
Way I'm hitting every spot, you'd think I'd have a map of it
Sex is easy when it’s done together
I picture unity, now let us all come together
Joe

[Chorus: Joe Budden & Emanny]
Let’s make love in unison
No one gets excluded then
And we can do it
However, whenever, wherever
It ain’t cheating if we doing it together
Together

[Post-Chorus: Emanny]
Let’s make love in unison, baby
Let’s make love in unison
