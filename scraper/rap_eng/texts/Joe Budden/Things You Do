[Hook: Emanny]
Things you do, to make me wanna' leave you
To make me wanna' go somewhere and do things I ain't supposed to do
You got me going crazy, thinking I just gotta' get away
Baby girl, you're not that far away from a nigga leaving you
Yea

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Alright breathe, let's talk for a minute, ain't gotta be naive
As much as we argue, for real he might leave
In your mind, you say your dude slacken'
But how we go from being soul mates to you packing
Or me leaving, me creeping, us beefin'
Going weeks without speakin' for no reason
How you gonna' ignore me or get a little jealous
Anytime a girl call me, making up your own stories
I been with you for years, supposed to die together
If I risk you for one night, I would hide it better
Now here's something you should think 'bout
You snatching numbers out my phone just to call bitches I don't even think 'bout
And the madness all started with a cute crush
You moving in, it all started with a tooth brush
Told you I'd walk out your life and never look back
You mistook that, so fuck it let's bring the hook back

[Hook]

[Bridge: Emanny]
Oh girl you know I'm tired of coming home to you
(Crying, fussing)
I can't even come home without you saying I'm
(Lying, bunting)
I'm better than this
Girl you know I'm sick of you
(Tripping, cussing)
You keep playing these games and girl you know I'll hit the door
(Quickly, sudden)
Oh, It's the things you do girl

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Look, why scream and why yell
I'm so sure I'm where I wanna' be like Donnell
But that don't mean I can't go out with a friend, calamari and some cocktails
You puttin' curfews on a nigga but it's not jail
Spaz anytime the AOL say you got mail
Hit the club, you think I'm out being Akinyele
With nothing tempting me, sleeping with the enemy
Argue by yourself baby, I ain't got the energy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
You wanna' fight about the dishes, the dog
Your workplace, the cable, my friends
Your parents, Myspace, is he faithful
There's two things cheating will do
Tell me we ain't meant to be or make me just appreciate you
Listen I'ma be fine, just need some me time
Not us or we time, since we can't rewind
You fightin' throwin' shit at me
I ain't scrapin' with you, fuck around
Lose the best thing that ever happened to you

[Bridge 2: Emanny]
Girl you know I can be
I can be what you want and need
Girl you know I can try
To give you everything you need from me
Girl all I need is a chance
To prove to you I can be your man
You should've let me
But I'm 'bout to leave

[Hook]
