Give it away now! Uhh
I mean, make sure the light's on in this muh'fucker
Is that supposed to be though, let's make it hot

L-look look look look look; I can't call it
I always seem to take one step backward and five steps forward
Nothin to gain, it's like everything's mortgaged
Y'all can love me or y'all won't, go 'head and talk shit
Cautious, report shit (I mean) live out of hell
Since all my dudes either alive or out of jail (ohh!)
Won't fold, won't curl - no wonder all this weight's on my shoulders
I'm sittin on the bottom of the world!
They say, tears are words that your mouth can't speak (ohh!)
Rubber on every arm could fire but can't reach
I say, streets learn you what the schools can't teach
My job's to get a gospel that the church won't preach
Somethin like a rock star, keep the live band
Just sub my True Religions for those skin-tight pants (yeah!)
Ass on my wife, no nice implants
I mean no accessories, the crime's been an accessory
It's a thinkin man's world, shit is chess to me
So let the king move, meantime let it be

My blood is on FIRE in this muh'fucker!
Pack your bags, packin up for the weekend
We 'bout to do this! Let's GO!

[Hook: Dub B]
Adrenaline's rising
You could feel the fire rush right through the veins
Look on the horizon
You could see the sun, but the night still controls the pain-yay-yay-yain

[Drew Hudson]
Yo... it's the Junk Yard Gang, Drew Hudson reppin Jersey
Reverse the psyche on life and do the mic dirty
Tired, hungry and thirsty, motherfuck fame
Matter fact, when this verse ends forget my name
It's the message not the man, the vision not the plan
No glitz or glam, just pure connection with the fans
Half your downloads get deleted with the spam
These dudes keep it so real, they come across fake
Straight boring, ignore these wack bastards
Approach us too forward, these frauds is ass backwards
I just vividly spit it to pick it differently
Rip all the vodka, swig it then pissin on negativity
The pen's mightier than the trigger, strike 'em when I spit
Real catchy, huh? I don't even like that shit
What I like, a rock flow that's lava
Melodic, with a high dose of more fire
The fire and the rain, the fire in my veins is hot
Can't be stopped with fire brigades
UHH! No image, I'm livin every synonym twisted
In this syllable spliff six of them hits'll leave you lifted
All heart and gut, feelin the hunts
Adrenaline rush, c'mon! Shit's heatin up

[Hook]

[Joe Budden]
Uh-huh, l-look look; I wear a K as a weapon
Eye through scope case my foes at the top of my stairway to heaven
And I, pop a big step, dressed in my fly shit
IPod, headphones on bumpin my shit
I never cared, I was careless
Fear bein afraid (or) or maybe I'm afraid to be fearless
(Or) Or fear bein fearless but fearful
So even in my carelessness, gotta be careful
I'm like, who's that lookin threw my peephole?
When did my alter-ego get a ego?
He wants the rims chrome
Me I'm tryin to push the pedal 'til my FOOT'S on the ground like a Flintstone
Bluetooth, my girl on the horn bickerin
But even though when she SCREAM I hear it like whisperin
I been around noise all my life
I've been poised baby all my life, just let me live my life!
Live yours, make your own highlight
Then meet me at the top like a butterfly knife
Then you'll, learn how to see without eyesight
If, at first you don't succeed then try twice
See I don't write it I will it, reel it, real shit
Paint a masterpeice then unveil it, come I'm 'bout to reveal it!
Destroy it, rebuild it
Then conceal it before another nigga steals it (I mean)
Milk shit, not a pessimist, I'm a realist
When you think you on, I go and hit the killswitch
Drummer rockin, he's ill bitch
If they sleep don't wake 'em, just drill shit
See I'm somethin they gotta deal with!
