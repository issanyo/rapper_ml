[Verse 1]
"Pump it up, you came to get it crunk
A dame and shit and drunk, you came to get it on"
That's when it all got started, I mean
Back then I wasn't so cold-hearted
With every stanza came an extravaganza
For every question he got one less answer
I was tryin' to be more than cool
Nah, it was before that, maybe boarding school
That was back when I would want to endanger myself
Maybe it was just to entertain myself
I don't need help, I could change myself
Fuck ya'll, I ain't gotta explain myself
Death's around the corner, I could hear his footsteps
Does he think that I'm the only nigga in the hood left
So tell any listener of mine, for twenty-eight years been a prisoner of the mind

[Refrain x2]
Now I lay me down to sleep, and I
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, if I
If I should die before I wake, then I
I pray the Lord my soul to take, I mean

[Verse 2]
Welcome everybody into the brain of a self-proclaimed sinner
Even when he can't win, that nigga won't surrender
Boones Farm put the wheels in motion
I felt every emotion except devotion
Message in a bottle in the bottom of the ocean
But I can't swim, dammit I can't win
So I don't care how you rate me
It'd take a long time to evaluate me
So if, this be the last time you hear me
Just know I got a loved one near me
Please don't cry, let an eye get teary
A nigga good, finally I'm somewhere care free
Past is frightening but the future's scary
And I'm, gettin' to the point that I fear me
In a class all alone, don't compare me
But I'll, blame God this is where he steered me

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
They tell me that eyes is the window to a man's soul
So what you happen to see a nigga can't control
And I turned a def ear
To anything an anybody that'll get my head clear
Why shake the dice if you never gon roll em
I told em, that the straitjacket can't hold em
I ain't psycho, don't belittle me now
It's just a title cause they couldn't figure me out
If you give a damn when shit hits the fan
Please know anything I ever did a nigga planned
Tryin' to better, high as ever
Since I learned how to lie to a lie detector, still I'm damaged
They say if you stay in that boat long enough you'll see where the land is
So I'm right where I need to be
Please believe it believe it please, let's get on our knees

[Refrain]
