[Verse 1: Ransom]
Yo its all about guns N butta, Like Melvin from Baby Boy
Come through & thug your mother
Leave your baby boys undercovers undiscovered
Thats what you get for talking to them undercovers (snitch)
And when it rains, run for cover
Cause the slugs'll hover
And penetrate to leave you thugs to suffer
Like aids on some lethal shit
But I dont gotta worry bout that, Cause Ran keep tons of rubbers
Eighteen spit acid baby, I dont mind if y'all eating
Just as long as y'all pass the gravy
Might see me in the fast mercedes
Speeding through the traffic crazy
Tryna get a bag of hazie
Might catch me in the front row seat
For the Nets vs Magic, all I had to do was ask McGrady (T-Mac)
Been hustlin past the eighties
Only got locked once & y'all niggas can't congratulate me?
Fuck y'all, niggas had to hate me
And I never deal with niggas thats dumb cause the math be shaky
Soon or later you gon have to face me
I dont wanna be calm, Y'all niggas starting to aggrevate me
Its no wonder why you guys approach me, like you probably know me
I treat your girl like if I was Kobe
And you know I keep the fire closely
Cause a clip'll have your ass on one leg like the Heisman Trophy (Nigga!)

[Verse 2: Hitchcock]
Nigga fuck who thought was the best
When you talk, talk with respect
Before I put the hawk to your neck, Your sure to get wet (Brapp!)
This is more than a threat
I'm good with the Gym Star I never bought a Gillete ugh!
I'm sort of a threat, record your cassettes
I got the long white tee with the Nautica sweats ugh!
I'm balling great, touring states
And I stay strapped like the Jordan 8s (cmon)
Sick like Norman Bates
While you niggas tryna grill
I'm tryna make George Forman cakes (ugh!)
And when I hit the chach[?]
Your girl said you was small like Arnold, you got different strokes
Fall back young'n get your folks, This ain't just a hoax
My niggas real they will slit your throat
Hitchcock is a verbal weapon
And it ain't shampoo when I open off that Herbal Essence (ah)
All y'all flowing the same, I put a hole in your frame
Rapping bout how you be holding the cain
I dont really wanna show him the aim, Never doubt him
I'm hugrier than down syn' throwing a flame
Cause my niggas want the glow & the fame
I'm blowing a O and a range, thinkin bout blowing your brains (pause)
Can't do that, cause I ain't a killer
But my man will cause he a gorilla (nigga, ugh..)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
So many people they see you they jealous they envy
Watching wanting to be you, some reason
They feel the need to G you so they speak to you
Since they know you they see it feasible to be with you
Plotting & time it wit, pull it bring the beef to you
And feel that they got reason to
But I'm a straight up & down never changed
Nah never been seasonal
Knock Knock Bang wood this ain't good
Its the Spurs against the Mavericks nigga, same hood
I'm a grown man I won't let friends abuse me
And I think dudes is using that word friends to losely (Nah)
We ain't best friends cause I lent you lucies
Exchanged pounds, exchanged rounds, tactics that exchange sound
Force me to keep one in the hand four[?]
And if you feel like jumpin I'll provide the Red Bull
Wanna start though its hearts jellow
Its young Lebron, but its still room for Darko & Carmelo
I dont speak kilos, no its Neo's soul
Get to the end of the matrix 3, Neos show[?] (yea!)
Know the Jump Off the best thing in Jerz
Wanna rob the house get through Westwing first nigga
Best doubt it now best bout it now
Its a small world we can make it less crowded now
Get into some drastic things
Magneto style, you can't hold me in a plastic beam nigga
