Revenge of the nerds, I'm leading the pack
Gangstas had it, I'm seizing it back
Reason to rap
Is clear that the vision of some of these vets blurry
No shot at putting season in back with Steph Curry
Wait, some of y'all still doubt fam
I get a chick to do whatever I want without bands
Cars foreign, but the .45 from the block
So would've recognized you and go and hide from the cops
Hay makers for these great debaters and naysayers
To their dream team, I'm Isaiah, aight playa
Look, it's a proven fact, top five dead or alive
And we a man suicide away for proving that
These emcees had brains, won't dare test it
Been nice since 2 Chainz was bare chested
Way back, Emmitt still had Troy and Dallas with him
Before Pusha T lived good, still had malice in him
Lose some and you win some
Put my money where my mouth is and that's just disposable income
Got the vision of a virgo, nah, it's more to know
I got the vision of a virgo, nah, it's more to Joe
See nightmares when you look into my eyes, that's just my horror-scope
And who you looking to try?
If there's a price on my head I'll discount it if you looking to buy
This ain't the day to play, catch 'em face to face
Then surround them with chrome
And give them every chapter from 50 Shades of Grey
I started from the bottom twice
Molly's on South Beach, that was my Miami Vice
Losing myself, so out of respect with TV
Not for the bread, for the reality check
When you hit this age you learn from all errors
Like getting carried away might come with pole bearers
Got the respect though already
Sold everything they shipped, E1 have my next check ready
