[Intro]
See, me
I'm talking bout something called...
Something I like to call "it"
Ain't really got a name for it
Only certain niggas suffer from this shit
Talking bout niggas that got like...
Niggas that got like a 6th sense
Sometimes you see shit that ain't there
Sometimes you hear shit ain't no body said nothing
Sometimes you think you somewhere and you really somewhere totally different
It's almost like you hallucinating
But you sober, you ain't high
No drugs and nothing like that
Sometimes you can BE high
Talking bout like some paranoia or some shit

[Hook]
Four walls, they surround me
Loneliness has found me
I'm waiting for you to return
Open the door, walk right on in
Darling let's start all over again

[Verse 1]
Look, I don't give a fuck again
Thoughts in my head
Looking like a nigga stuck with them
Wishing it abruptly ends
But God woke him up again
Everything is seeming so unfair, so unclear
Trying to reach out no one's there
Four walls tell em go run where no one cares
Screaming this too shall pass
Riding on fumes without gas
Bills piling up without cash
Tryna maintain and outlast
Pray for me, keep telling niggas patiently wait for me
Keep telling haters wait and see
I'm busy tryna fill a vacancy
Been a long time it's taking me
Muhfuckas keep mistaking me
Mistakenly, they caging me
Niggas never had no faith in me
Its like I'm one semi from death
I'm just a few pennies from debt
I got no identity left, victim of identity theft
Problems never knew, it's revenue
Keep blaming 'em it's never you
Keep telling baby girl I'm gon' leave and never do
Cause even when a nigga needs space
When you looking for a little leeway
Somebody put it on replay
It's like it gets louder with each day, pray

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look, look
I'm tryna keep it formal now
But the pressure's on him now
I'll go ahead and warn you now
I'm tryna come across as normal now
All my life I've been called insane
Looked at as if I'm strange
Can't tame 'em
Can't blame 'em for looking at me as if I can't change
With that said, still I'ma rise
Though I keep it still in lies
Go ahead reveal your disguise
Maybe that'll kill the surprise
Sometimes I feel deprived
Starting when the guilt arrive
I noticed that the hills have eyes
When you on the heels of demise
And your man's on a ledge
Niggas tampering with my head
I ain't getting head in the Phantom
A phantom's in my head
Can't escape, figured I'd be a candidate
I ain't gotta upper-hand to date, can't be fate
Must think that I can handle weight
See I'm thinking of mansions, lakes
I was thinking Mandalay
Thinking I'd expand my stay
That's just the chance I'll take
Bow to my knees so the crowd's appeased
Put em in the mouth of the beast
Crazy they didn't make him out to be
I'm just tryna make it out at least, please

[Hook]

[Outro over Hook]
See what I'm talking bout
They ain't really got terms for shit I'm talking bout
I know they just diagnosed me with this shit
Like a, like an early age or shit
I don't mean four walls literally, nothing like that
Four walls, I'm talkin' bout
Ain't no windows. Ain't no sunlight. Ain't even a door
No locks, no nothing. Ain't getting outta that shit
You just try and get stuck
I'm talking bout four walls in your head baby
I know a nigga like me
I been talking about a nigga like me for a long time
Fucked up out here, can't even escape
We gon get em, nowhere nigga
Let the guitars ride out
Tell the four walls that I snuck a guitar player up in this bitch
