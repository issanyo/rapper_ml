[Verse 1]
She don't love me
She love the power, she loves a man of my position
Loves the sex, loves a man of my positions
Love the pool, love the hot tub, my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
And I don't just beat it up, I pound her
She reciprocates it with fresh grits and flounder
I counter by letting her put whatever on the counter
Cause I never seen a ass better or rounder
Plus I never seen ass better around ya
No dollars, just ass, bet it surround ya
She don't love me, she love the way I navigate
Love the wordplay and how I make her masturbate
I drop her off and laugh at you while you chasing it
If I was ever in Marvin's Room, I was casing it
But do be calling or right after I'm all in
I be like feel free, pick up, I'm watching SportsCenter
I grew up poor, I never had shit
So now I don't hit the mall I hit the flagship
I got her thinking that's her paper to burn
But when I lock her out, she won't doubt David is Stern
I mean, they don't love me, they wanna send me Llamas
But I can understand why they envy, kinda
Friendly reminder, bank statements with plenty commas
Made it right in front of em, gotta thank Benihana
If you with these rap dudes, I may have tainted it
They blackballed me, I spray painted it
Been accused of cheating, but I never take the blame for it
They did all the fucking, my ass just entertained the shit
Yea, I'm through the hood, red Porsche
They been mad, but I'm pistol whipping a dead horse
Now execs wanna hop on the phone
Cause I snuck in the back door while they was watching the throne
I mean, she don't love me, she just infatuated
She was the side chick, then she graduated
If she loved me, that would be unusual
I think she only say that shit to find out if it's mutual

[Verse 2]
I'm in the zone, but I don't need MTV
I need pills, not percs, I'm on NZTs
Why the fuck would they mess with another guy's rhymes
If the stakes is high, nigga butterfly mines
I mean, hate my bars, but she love the way I say the shit
Hate my job, but she love it when I pay for shit
If she ever wild, tryna ruin my dictatorship
I put her in the oven, let her bake a bit
One land, one take off
One's annoying, one demand make her take off
One's a older nympho, get mad when I say it's soft
But she feels a way when ? cried when the Lakers lost
She don't love me, love the company I keep
But the fans don't love me, mean they wanna be the sheep
My motto is to do it for the culture, they not of the same gene
You want the current wave, stay on the main stream
Is it me or is what I'm hearing just pitiful
Airwaves the same, even the stereo is typical
It don't love me, it love the models that I be with
But when I be talking about all of these models I'm poppin' at least you believe it
Wanna know the secret? I guess it's how you time the shit
You come with wooden jewelry, I give her diamond dick
I hit the booth and the track get nervous
If you say I sold out, try to track that purchase
If we shared the same life, nigga you would understand it
When no matter the charges you accrue, you never panic
You would take advantage
When I feel like you the ruler of the planet
Get some head, a little hookah on the hammock
Rodman with the trash talk, the Magic will Walt with the black ball
The way I bounce off the asphalt like cat paws
Tried to trap me till I started to roam
Tried to keep me out the game, so I started my own
I mean, she don't love me, she just infatuated
She was the side chick, then she graduated
99 problems and a bitch is every one of em
How the fuck I'm gonna give dick to every one of em?
