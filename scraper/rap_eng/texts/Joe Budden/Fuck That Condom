[Verse 1 : Joe Budden]
It started with her lookin' like she couldn't use the company
Started out face-to-face, now she under me
Both be layin' in the bed, but she come with me
It's to the point shorty mad there's only one of me
But she be knowin' what I mean when I'm through
It's just my way of sayin' that I don't want nothin' comin' in between me and you
I knew it when I seen you in them jeans lookin' glued
Plus you gain points 'cause my whole team think you're cool
Her mind was sayin' no, face was sayin' yes
Working my way down to her waist from her chest
She began to moan, legs began to spread
I'm holdin' her down, embracin' her for the best, Joe

[Refrain 1: Emmany]
Been here for a while but now I can see
That we both kinda wasted
Don't know what this time alone gonna be
But I don't wanna waste it, uh-huh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Emanny]
I like to just think we connected
But others would say we just strange
I know I should slow down a little
But now I'm in so ain't pulling away, so
I'm gonna have to be more careful
Unless I'm ready to be there for you forever
You gonna have to be more careful
But she was so wet that I slipped inside
Buckle up, your gon' miss that ride

[Chorus: Emmany]
Oh baby
Make me wanna say, "Fuck that condom"
Oh baby
Make me wanna say, "Fuck that condom"
Oh baby
She make me wanna say, "Fuck that condom"
Oh baby
She make me wanna say, "Fuck that condom"

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I got lead to believe she was deranged quick
Flipped out, started actin like my main chick
Started questionin' my moves and who I hang wit'
Threatin' me with other dudes, like the game flipped
And so I tell her like this:
"You could be with them other niggas
But you gon' still be the same chick
And they might have a little more bread
But they won't provide you with the same dick
We should be understandable
Strip tease, hip squeezed, I manhandle you
They might eat it, but we two different cannibals
'Cause when I’m done you be convinced I gave a damn 'bout you

[Refrain 2: Emanny]
Movin' too fast and I'm startna think
That she already planned it
And I know if I got too close what could be
But I'm willing to chance it, oh—oh

[Pre-Chorus: Emanny]
I like to just think we connected
But others would say we just strange
I know I should slow down a little
But now I'm in so ain't pulling away, girl
I'm gonna have to be more careful
Unless I'm ready to be there for you forever
You gonna have to be more careful
But she was so wet that I slipped inside
Buckle up, your gon' miss that ride

[Chorus: Emmany]
Oh baby
Make me wanna say, "Fuck that condom"
Oh baby
Make me wanna say, "Fuck that condom"
Oh baby
She make me wanna say, "Fuck that condom"
Oh baby
She make me wanna say, "Fuck that condom"

[Outro: Joe Budden]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
In the SL playing SLV
You know what it is
But you don't though, yeahmean?
