Chorus:
Lookin back on the things ive done
Everything happens for a reason
Life is somethin u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
I gotta make a confession theres nothin im regretting
Lifes a valuable lesson to have to pull out a weapon
So dont make me
Life is something u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
Joey B, you know me B
It's the nigga that would tryn' get the blow on GP
It's the nigga in the hood on the low G3
It's the nigga some niggas want so does he please
Is it 'cause he make the flow look so easy
Or do he sit and count up all the dough that he see
Or do they wanna prove they OG and use me
To get the guns out, sending him to ODB
But what I ever did to a nigga? Aside give to a nigga
Try to show the big pic to a nigga
But I can't conclude how some niggas conclude
That the world is too small for them to live with a nigga
I don't regret dude trying me, dude keeping that eye on me
Then they gotta live with this thing called irony
And if I gotta live with the idea reminding me
Then they can't live when the iron's on me, yeah!

Chorus:
Lookin back on the things ive done
Everything happens for a reason
Life is somethin u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
I gotta make a confession theres nothin im regretting
Lifes a valuable lesson to have to pull out a weapon
So dont make me
Life is something u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
And so I bear my soul, my pain, my anger
I beg to the Lord, keep me far from mo' danger
Look I know 'em but can't see 'em, he's a popular stranger
If I never got stabbed, wouldn't remember Veronica's wrath
Standing in the shower looking at the scab
I wouldn't know the hints of a stick-up kid
If I ain't have that short stint as a stick-up kid
If dude never tried to kill me, I mighta went numb
To all the bullshit that goes on where I'm from
And if I never went to jail, wouldn't needed a bail
Woulda probly went on to graduate from Yale
Woulda been a prosecutor standing in the court of law
But then that goes against everything he stands for
And if I never met Glo, how would I really know
All the shit that comes with, when you dealing with a ho
See it is what it is to be
Or it is what it is, at least that's what it is to me
And so if I could ever go back in history
I wouldn't change shit, I'd leave it all just to be
And if my first album woulda did five when it dropped
I'd be chillin, instead of tryna' rise to the top
If I could reverse the roles, would I reverse the roles?
Would it be worth it to try to reverse the tolls?

Chorus:
Lookin back on the things ive done
Everything happens for a reason
Life is somethin u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
I gotta make a confession theres nothin im regretting
Lifes a valuable lesson to have to pull out a weapon
So dont make me
Life is something u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
I got a brother always keeps it real, his name's Guilt
Let's me know I can't stand however it is I feel
I got a cousin named Pride, nigga acts like a lawyer
Gotta a sister named Karma, I be tryna' avoid 'er
Gotta ex that's bitter, wants me to be her nigga
Hates my girl Self-Pity 'cause I'm always with her
But bitter's beef is valid, she don't like shorty 'cause she use me
One time she seen 'er verbally abuse me
Got a friend that's passive, friends call him Passive
He just says whatever hoping that shit passes
My Uncle Hindsight wears real thick glasses
Reminds me of where I been and how shit gets drastic
Got a Aunt named Humility, she speaks low mumbles
Don't care that I'm a rapper she keeps me so humble
In my head I'll debate it, outloud I'll never say it
I'm pretty sure it's a good reason we all related
