[Intro]
New Joe Budden

[Verse]
Let me reintroduce y’all
I guess in doing that I will reduce y’all
Sent away from Parks's shelf, excuse y’all
I’d hate to have the fans to be thinking that they didn’t have a use for y’all, wait!
Even thinking as I write this, yeah
Probably come off as abuse to y’all, so
Think we better call dyfs
Or get a chair, every snare's like a noose to y’all
What I gotta prove to y’all? Already been clear
So serious, I'm so sincere
Thinking I'm overlooked, really I been here
Going on ten years
And by no means at all is that a thin career
I’ll battle anybody in this hemisphere
It’s not recklessness, specialist on some introspective shit
I don’t respect this shit, I thought y’all didn’t care, so
Since they hopping on the same page, wait
Lemme go and write a new book, yeah
Let me show them what we 'bout Royce
Let me show them what we do Crook
They was under the impression we was underground, nah
We don’t do the spotlight and gimmicks
Dudes y'all listen to don't be getting it in
So I snatched every nigga that they mimicked
Authentic, y’all call it a clinic
Y’all race against time but I'm winded
Hip-hop’s son, Kool Herc's descendent (?)
Nah, nigga, never cared who we offended
'Cause they told me I’d be dead by now
Told me I was sick, I’m on meds right now
Shit’s pitiful, I’m lyrical, bitch, in the booth, nigga probably getting head right now
I wish it was a window
To what my mind be brewin’
Y’all pop the bottles or wine cooler
Either way don’t interrupt what I’m doin’
It's my tune it don't pertain to you
It’s not obtainable, this rhyme schooling
So after my latest should be labelled the greatest
And even if I’m not I’m signed to him
Always thought I only had to be myself though
All that ever got a nigga was the shelf though
Built my own legacy without help though
So now I need more room than just elbow
Now the angst is building and the buzz is high, shit is long awaited
Even though I run the risk of having songs be dated
Before I ever conform I’ll be constipated
What I mean I can easily pop off
Sell out and get the whole world to talk 'bout
I’d be rich right, but it wouldn’t sit right
So I hold my own shit before it’s forced out
Every line would be about pulling a Hawk out
Not me, can’t help 'em lower the bar
Label heads keep callin', they know I’m a star
Fuck the charts, I’d rather take over their hearts
Got paper just as long
Got a couple of fags that doubted, I don’t brag about it
I was raised to think that that’s wrong
Surrounded by thick strippers who don’t get the picture
As they poppin’ it to that song
But I’ll put a million worth in your brain
Before I put a single one in that thong
Maybe I’m just fabricating myself
Maybe I’m a sucker for some ass and some hips like that
Powerful enough to set you up with a career
Spiteful enough to snatch it right back
Man enough to never care what other folks think
Tell a chick pack up get done with the hood
But this new lifestyle so foreign to her, her new name Ms Understood
Built my own legacy know it’s fan made
Thousand dollar shades on, hand made
When it comes to pain, no they can’t aid
Maybe it’ll be a temporary band aid
Cause I came in blind to it all
Then I learned the game’s designed for you to fall
I don’t mind it at all, eating my ribs
Good meal, cause I stay prime through it all
I can tell from the whispering that these haters got it so wrong
Thinking bout my currency the only worry I see is which balcony to smoke on
And I know it hurts to hear a nigga persevere kind of man know how to stay strong
Just gotta shake the dice up and throw them shits without a care which side they land on
You’re hearing a legend, a leader
Still brought to you by Kevin and Lyor
Cig lit in the bed with my feet up
Mislead if you think you can keep up
At this point it’s the have’s against the have not’s
Nah we won’t ever share the same views, got different bread
Nigga the same dude has got different ones, went to the same school
The same folks, the same hoes
So it’s clear to me could be blurry to you
In the same regard they got the same heart
And I been there with you, in a hurry to do
We don’t move at the same speed, nah
Probably thinking I’ma cheat code
Unparalleled, it’s called beast mode
Had my real nigga ethics, G code
