Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle
Yo, I know it's fucked up what a lack of cake'll do
A few people want to move in and stay with you
You wish you could help them all, you unable to
Cause the rent's a little late, plus the cables due
You and your girlfriend are beefing in a serious way
You used to be faithful, you in a curious stage
Finally got your mind made, you're going your separate ways, wait.
Now, homeboy, her period's late now think
Time's running out do it quickly
Cause she start crying, mood's getting sticky
If I don't want it she'll want nothing to do with me
Just get the abortion and I'll give you the 250
But if you say that to her then you wrong
You ain't think about that you were getting your groove on
I can't take care of myself never mind a newborn
I guess that pussy got too good for too long
Seems like my money goes by too easy
Why I hate that my job only pays bi-weekly
My hooptie done shitted
Spending more money trying to fix it then what you did when you were trying to get it
Fridge is empty but I survive the hunger
Who the fuck keeps calling from this private number
There's crime on my mind and my nails are dirty
But the floors are real cold and the jails are Jersey
Depression starts talking and his voice is raspy
Cause he ain't shut the fuck up in 3 and a half weeks
Look, beard is full, hair is nappy
These jeans ain't mine, so they way too baggy
priorities is fucked / some starting to gas me
it's like my whole life just flicked right past me
it's starting to trap me
His name's Dwayne so why the fuck my son keep calling him daddy?
Same shit that I feared after all these years
I got to breath / I can't believe my ears
wiping out my eyes / I'm damn near in tears
but you can't be mad / because you know you ain't been there / no
you grab his Moms up / through her against the door
but in the back of your mind / you know it ain't her fault
no / I ain't mad at all / I'm just bothered /
I get honest for real / I ain't been the best father like
toys r us, Chuckie Cheese / u know a lil kid grows up with these needs
new years, a christmas / even a birthday /
at least bring the little one / to school on the first day
I can't believe it / this is the same way that I was treated
so maybe it's history repeated
I know it sounds sick / the idea of having another kid
cause this one / you really feel like it's his /
it's the truth and I hate that fact
wait I shouldn't of said that / I take that back
I apologize, let's rewind this whole story like Nas
C4 just erase that track.
Check it / I don't care if only the track trust me
fuck what y'all say / only GOD can judge me
fuck what all y'all heard, think, or even thought
tried to fix my short comings / I just came up short.
Joey.
