[Intro: Joe Budden]
This what is sound like when the boys back-up

[Chorus: [?]]
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Nigga)
On top we bang this, wassup (Nigga)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Uh)
On top we bang this, wassup (Yeah)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
At first it was weed, then I moved on raw (Okay)
First it was my block, then it was on yours
Whoever disagree get 'em with the long four
[?] on tour, who want more, but naw
Nah, now I'm at a whole other state
And the next king of New York's from a whole nother state
Got the key to Jay-Z and other spots that surround
Like [?] about to lock shit down
Fiends love that you got it, just not enough to try it
"We love your club songs, just not enough to buy it"
Will never be a boss, but you'll always be a sidekick
Means you'll always on my dick, Cosere wassup?

[Chorus: [?]]
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Nigga)
On top we bang this, wassup (Nigga)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Uh)
On top we bang this, wassup (Yeah)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)

[Verse 2: Newz]
I run up on 'em and aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)
You got a problem then let me know what's what (Yeah)
'Cause I ain't up for the talkin', I'm down for the sparkin'
The bouncers let me in with [?]
It's the block gang, homie, don't get [?] me
I thought I told you motherfuckers befo'
Niggas ain't gonna stand 'til I'm in front of they door
Put the chrome Desert Eagle to the side of they jaw
I'm back at it, squeezing a black matic
[?] dope addict
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna dirty my Nike's
Don't make me end the party early tonight, aight? (Yeah)

[Chorus: [?]]
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Nigga)
On top we bang this, wassup (Nigga)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Uh)
On top we bang this, wassup (Yeah)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)

[Verse 3: Ransom & Hitchcock]
You could catch Ran in a white tee, chain and nice watch
A slight bop like I got hit with a nice shot
I'm quite hot like cook cooked in the right pot
The right Glock slugs make sure that your life stop
The dice spot where we post up with the white tops
On [?] we don't like cops
But you could say I'm New York's bravest
'Cause I'm not all that with MAC's, but I'm great with Gauge's
Nigga, a facelift, that's what you gonna need, you gonna bleed
When that 8 spit get on your knees, "Where's all the keys?"
Got a great flip from off the D, you oughta leave
Youse a fake, snitch [?] I order, "Squeeze"
To the big [?] I slaughter G's with quarter keys
[?] it's hard to breath from all the trees
In the Matrix, ignore the [?], I'm for the G's
I know you hurtin' 'cause you workin' with shorter cheese

[Chorus: [?]]
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Nigga)
On top we bang this, wassup (Nigga)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Uh)
On top we bang this, wassup (Yeah)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Your girl know she reppin' a clown
And she called you Roy Jones, said you knockout during in the second round
(I got the) all chrome thing in a rose gold case
Now I be Nick Birdman and don't show face
I'll never be cuffed in a cell (Why?)
'Cause the cops'll never catch me, the engine's a W12
Or I'm in a [?] dippin' the red lights
Hood's dented up and it's missing a headlight
'Cause they play for keeps, and niggas know about me
So how they still sell straight razors in the street?
It's not sweet, if it is it's not me
And you can't wake him up, he's not asleep now, nigga
What up?

[Chorus: [?]]
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Nigga)
On top we bang this, wassup (Nigga)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)
Wassup, wassup, wassup (Uh)
On top we bang this, wassup (Yeah)
See a chump and you want his head buss
And you don't give a fuck then aks 'em, "Wassup?" (What up?)
