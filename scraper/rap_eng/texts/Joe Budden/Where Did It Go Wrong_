Yo, niggas ain't lookin' for me like they say they are
But on some real shit, I pray they are
Cause niggas keep runnin' 'round acting like the AK far
I keep it nearby in case they start
Might catch 'em on a 'Friday'
Chill! they like Day-Day to the God
Think they already know it and it break they heart
With all the hate that he seem to get
Things jus ain't been the same since the A Team split
Got some hood niggas thinking they straight mutants
More like good niggas; straight A students
Dog it's no games, no intermission
Tell him I just seen him die and the premonition in him, listen
Can't eat dinner missing in the kitchen
Could smell but can't taste
I'm three laps ahead
You a snail in the race
Pale in the face
Niggas is lightwork on a scale with no weight
Wait, can't stand these clowns
Gave 'em everything they got so to me they just a hand-me-down
My dude, look around before you think about sparking
You're way outnumbered; go ahead and be a Spartan
It's stones getting thrown in here
Fuck these strip club hoes (nigga) I'll get Pacman Jones in here
I swear, it's getting harder to live with the anger
And home ain't home when you live with a stranger
Thought I knew you like the back of my hand
Fast forward three years and I got smacked with the back of her hand
Caught with my ass out without sagging my pants
Allow yaself to get caught like that with that man
Find out your wife that you sleeping with
Play herself start creeping with
One of your dudes
You confused you don't know who to get even with
Maybe you ain't the same broad that I was even with
When you cheating with dude I see and shit
Nigga I'm fly with, work with, we speak and shit
You the broad that would ride for me
Look me in the eyes transformed in to Shaggy
Bitch, how you gone lie to me?
Fell for the allure that's my bad you broke in something so
Secure
I'm now scarred, see, you make it type hard
For me to see the next broad
And not think that she ain't jus another hoe or slore
But thank you, see relationships in a different view, son
To get over the old girl gotta get a new one
Half of me still witchu and I don't care ya'll
Other half with her, I'm stuck, so I compare ya'll
Me and her's now, me and you got memories
Me and you got love, me and her got chemistry
She's like a friend to me, you like the enemy
Or maybe she's there just to cover that resentment B
Or maybe she ain't as fake as you and won't take me through
That same phase as you
Or, maybe it's simple
She seen all that pain I was in
And won't make the same mistake as you
I mean, (I mean) I never had an issue with trust
Never knew you had an issue with lust
We can get through anything in this world if the issue's discussed
Was it a whole separate issue or an issue with us?
But it gets bigger, you doubting you, you like, shit nigga!
Was his money longer or was his dick bigger?
You getting sick nigga
When you alone, and just you and your imagination, you paint a sick picture, (I'm witcha)
