So that's life and nothing can change it
It's up and it's down, you can't rearrange it
(Ain't that funny?)

[Verse 1: Tsu-Surf]
Toast to the bitch that left me before I reached my peak
Ain't know they was offering meals, she only bought meeks
Blunt rolled, I probably faced the shit
Drive alone playin' 'Kiss
Stressing over a bitch that let Drake lyrics run a relationship
What a waste and shit, still trying to make it hit
Industry won't listen to hood, say I'm hot as bacon bits
Went to stripper shows strapped up, parked that bull
The 24 verses with Gods and parks on the board
24 with options, got me feeling like I'm Yao
Right person, right place, would do this thing right now
You can take it how you wanna, if they sleeping let them slumber
Same niggas, same numbers, same Decembers turned summers
Joey said I need to chill, cool and calm, patient
Focus on the goal at hand, keep my mind vacant
Still keep that wild side, gotta time place it
So my 40 still good, I'm Sanaa Lathan
Budden like them young hoes, I'm more into cougars
38 or better, grown women, grown shooters (get it?)
I don't know what's what, let me get a few more fuck ups
Before I'm cuffed up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ransom]
These critic commenters are switching fast, I did the math
I swam in the pool of sharks and now I'm just in a different class
These kids is trash, the garbage is getting bothersome
I wish I could see the past, I'm eliminating who fathered 'em
You could trace all the scars on 'em
Connect the wounds and you could say that it's martyrdom
Watch me tear out the heart of 'em, ain't nobody as hard as him
The God is him so Holyfield wouldn't spar with him
Just guard your chin
They told me I could replace a reverend
Walk through the fires of hell and get through the gates of heaven
It's Armageddon, you'll find this shit in the heart of legends
It's hard to bet him, you wonder where all these bars is headin'
Too far to get 'em, I'm saying it's just a different level
My thoughts have caused destruction, terror and twisted metal
It's just a ghetto, these bitches telling me step up
So rest up, a boy in the hood is giving their chest nuts
So guess what, the disrespectful even respect us
Fucking with women who couldn't cook, but they chef'ed up
I'm next up, these tales you couldn't relate to 'em
So when you talking it only feels like you fake to 'em
Come and talk to 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Look, she's asking, "what was I supposed to do?"
Tell me who put that roof over you
Them Loubie sandals, trench coats for you
That new S Panoramic roof over you
I just need you to know the game, I can't keep coaching you
She think I wanna fuck bitches cause it's summer time
But I was on some fuck bitches, you was summer fine
I'm talking from experience, it's just what's on the mind
It's sounding foreign to you now, but that'll come in time
I'm a go-getter
I'm Mr. If-That-Bitch-Is-Bad-Then-Go-Get-Her
This is Wainwright up in the fourth of a no hitter
Straight from Joe scripture, bad business
I'm just giving you bars with no liquors
She tell me I'm coldhearted, "how could you be this numb?"
Then she asks, how could she be this dumb?
But there's a transfer of energy
And your hand in its synergy
Is ruining my chance at serenity
This emotion versus logic
So let me put it this way so the arguing can stop it
Wanna know how you know if I really want to fuck that bitch?
Cause I'd go ahead and fuck that bitch
Wouldn't tweet her, wouldn't be a trace of this bitch
No pictures, wouldn't know the face of this bitch
That's real, you can't keep a grown man confined
Especially not a man of my mind, but let me handle this grind
