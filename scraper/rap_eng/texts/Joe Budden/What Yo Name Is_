[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Fucking on the floor, how'd we get this far?
Legs over my shoulder, and im in it raw
I'mma stay inside you as I pick you up
Dripping down your thigh, bitch I lick it up
All that I remember, is I had on a tie
And that ass looked amazing, but you was acting shy
I ain't get your name, I ain't had the time
But I ain't even need it for the things I had in mind
And

[Bridge: Emanny]
We'd dip off together, I grab you
Whats weird is nobody said one thing
One last call, we know what we was on
Whats worse is I dont regret it

[Hook: Joe Budden]
All I know is we'd been fucking all night
Dim lights, came twice, that ain't stoppin us
From going all night, damn lights, so right
We fuck like we know each other well
But what your name is?
And fuck who you came with
But but what your name is?
Bitch, I make you famous

[Verse 2: Emanny & Joe Budden]
Something about the look in your eyes
Will let me know you were down for whatever
And I know I could come inside
But That that will keep me around forever
But damn, it feels amazing to me!
You walk through that door
And the first thing that I saw
Was your thighs hugging my face
My mouth in places unseen
And we'll be one hour lovers
Adore the way that I fuck ya
But I hope nobody hears how you scream!

[Bridge: Emanny]
We'd dip off together, I grab you
Whats weird is nobody said one thing
One last call, we know what we was on
Whats worse is I dont regret it

[Hook: Joe Budden]
All I know is we'd been fucking all night
Dim lights, came twice, that ain't stoppin us
From going all night, damn lights, so right
We fuck like we know each other well
But what your name is?
And fuck who you came with
But but what your name is?
Bitch, I make you faded

[Verse 3: Joe Budden & Emanny]
She said nobody ever got this pussy wetter than you did baby
I've been trying to figure out how I end up on this floor with you
And now im rolling on X, overdosing on your sex im so high I love you baby
And we'd be fucking all night
Ill be here all night with you
Roll around all night with you

[Hook: Joe Budden]
All I know is we'd been fucking all night
Dim lights, came twice, that ain't stoppin us
From going all night, damn lights, so right
We fuck like we know each other well
But what your name is?
And fuck who you came with
But but what your name is?
Bitch, I make you faded
