[Joe Budden]
Can't clone these thoughts
They tryna tear down the homie fort
It's a waste of time I stay on my grind, I'm Tony Hawk
Easy with the hate, let a nigga see a mill first
I ain't into local beef, get a deal first
I bubble these toys, the trouble me boy
But I won't fall off, I ain't Trouble T Roy
Fucker -- don't make me put the thing to your bill
Cause dog you like wrestling, I used to think you was real
Dog, I used to just chill in the hood with no stardom
Now I'm killing the kids, I suffer from postpartum
Don't understand how you cowards be eating
It's time to cough it back up, son it's allergy season
For real, too petty, sunny I move deadly
The jewels heavy, pearl's blue it's like the new Pepsi
And if I'm mad witcha, pull the gat quicker
That'll ruin your Grey Goose and I don't mean bad liquor
The underdog, son I move too greasy
They treat me like De La Hoya, thought dude could beat me
Nah -- I lay low in the coupe when I ride nigga
With a fly stripper and it's not cause I'm a nice tipper
Icy hot, I'm just getting my wealth
The baby's .45, we both contradicting ourselves
They probably more upset
See me ride by with Ortiz Claudette in a beach Corvette
If it's a problem son tell me now
Have band-aids over your face, you overdoing Nelly's style
Haters wanna get their click-clack on
If you don't like my music, it's alright brother skip that song

[Ransom]
I wanna see how many niggas will rep
When I scream out Jersey, I ain't talking about Mitchell & Ness
I'm talking about getting respect
I'm talking about taking one cig out the pack and dippin the rest
You don't really want a problem with me
I hit your body with three and have you shaking like Mohammad Ali
Now you know you done started something
We three niggas from the hood, so you better bring your hawk or something
Can't hustle so you better get a job or something
I rather hit the block, [?] Jaws or something
Hitchcock, Ransom, and we involving Buddens
So if you got beef forget it because dog it's nothin
I walk around with the vest and the shotty
If I get locked up, they'll put me in the same section as Gotti
Come on dog you ain't catching a body
If I jumped in your arms you probably still couldn't catch you a body
Ain't a nigga tryna son Ran, cause that's dumb plan
When the gun blam, I give your body a sun tan, man

[Hitchcock]
First of all, don't make me have to murder y'all
Second of all, don't make me put this weapon to y'all
Third of all, I never even heard of y'all
Last of y'all, don't make me have to blast for y'all
Cause if you sleep I'm a blaze ya, keep heat by my pager
If streets was my major, I would pass it all
I'm MVP of streets before I pass the ball
Shut down the game so I'm the last to ball
I laugh at y'all, talking about your cash and cars
Hitch ridiculous, spit acid bars
That'll melt your face, playa I'll belt your face
With my name on a buckle that'll welt your face
You the type to take the stand and help the case
Even your moms disowned you, you a felt disgrace
Hitchcock's a bastard case, that'll blast your face
Black niggas talking religious like Pastor Ma$e
[?] hawk and a biscuit, now pass the safe
Unmask a face, get your ass erased
