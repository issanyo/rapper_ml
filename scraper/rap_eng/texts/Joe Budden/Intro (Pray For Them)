[Intro]
Joey
Four
Uh, let's get in the mood now

[Chorus]
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Just pray for me
'Body pray for me
Need y'all to just pray for me (Joey)
'Body pray for me
Need y'all to just pray for me (uh)

[Verse]
Now if it goes to the wire
I will never fall, I got the soul of a fighter
Walk barefoot over the coal, through the fire
I thought the toll would be lighter but make sure that blunt's rolled a little tighter
I tell 'em I'm just lookin' for some peace of mind
But they say I'm only working with a piece of mine
If I'ma do it'll be of my own accord, no crush
Swear to God I never called upon the Lord so much
Play the corner of the club, laughin' at the wannabes (why?)
It's ironic, 'cause they 'erything I wanna be
Would light a ton of reef
But that's gon' unleash everything I'm tryna hide underneath
Uh, then I'd lose all I've earned
Uh, and if there's two things that I've learned (what?)
Is I'm the only thing at stake (two)
And when you the only thing real really you the only thing fake
Uh, must be time to escape from that
And fuck rhymes, might be time to escape from rap
Why should I be the only nigga to escape from the act?
So I lie since everybody just escape from fact
Yo, that sucker shit niggas be on, I can't dig it
Joe, won't lose even if you plan to rig it
Yeah, nuttin' to prove with no fear of how I'm depicted
I'm here, won't move, I don't care to be evicted
You don't like how I move? (Well)
Well, I ain't gon' keep still, any nigga want me killed
Wanna leave me in the streets peeled
Well, if it happens, it happens, I believe in free will
Just know that ain't how we built
I'll call niggas that will dead you for a cheap thrill
When the clip's empty, they gon' try and refill
And I'ma be the dude to try stop 'em like "Please chill" (come on)
Y'all know what I'm about
They keep puttin' up roadblocks, I keep findin' alternate routes
Now success seems likely everybody wanna try me
I’m all for it, can’t trip me up, won’t fall for it
I'm just a man without a care (what else?)
Neighbor to heartache, roommate with despair (what else?)
Reminded my past is darker
'Cause when AM died (nigga), I was starin' at Travis Barker
Wishin' there was something I could say to make him cheer up
(So) And so I prayed, and he teared up
I ain't wanna see him go through that
The same shit that I feel, I just never show you that
Guess it's none of nobody business
And it just makes you look weaker, every joke is just smoke
Gotta look deeper, never mind, don't bother
'Cause some of y'all are smart e—nough and got sense
That if you try harder you'll get a glimpse of everything
That I harbor, we all ain't got the strength to be a martyr
So to anyone who ever loved me (what?)
I apologize, and I'm sorry
Whole-heartedly, can't change
It's just part of me, it's not music, shit's art to me
Too fucked up to drive, here's the car key
I don't care where we go just get it far from me
Choices I don't wanna make but I know I have to
World's goin' faster since my ride or die chose the latter
Lookin' for a rush out of habit
Proof there's a such thing as too much for a addict
Ain't the nigga I'm belittled as, riddled ass
Nigga come from middle class, when you speak to me show a little class
Dropped out of school, 'cause a nigga couldn't sit through class
Learnt to fall asleep through the sound of a pistol's blast
I come from where dad taught mom to get high (can you hear me?)
But she strong so we still got by (huh?)
When I picked up the drug why the fuck was they surprised
If it wasn't for your genes I wouldn't lust the supply
I come from a whole hood tellin' me that I'm next
Handin' me a mag, must've noticed I was complex (uh)
They say that you a wild individual
You just not gettin' my style, you too typical
'Erybody got a word for me
Shit y'all deem important ain't pertinent to me, nigga
Put your opinion with a feather, and balance that
Grab medicine when the success and the talent match

[Outro]

Somebody please pray for them
