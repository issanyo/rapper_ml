I’m the best that ever did it
Shoe in for the race
But I’m turning blue in the face
I been holding my breath
Waiting on the rest of y’all to get it
Then your whole perception of who you view as a legend
It’ll probably change
So it’s probably best they don’t admit it
They won’t televise the revolution
I figured out a solution
All you need now is the net to be a witness
Positive if you want to test him for the sickness
You’ll be begging for forgiveness
Meanwhile I push the pedal on the stick shift
Metal on the misfit just in case it’s ever on
CRACCCCCCCK, anything my breath is on
And if you misunderstood that get Rosetta Stone nigga
If you thinking I’ma respond to you, no I won’t
They say the devil wears Prada, no I don’t
Into the art and my passion for the bars
More then fashion it’s a mindstate that other stars lacking

If you and your team get bread, why hate
You’re not getting it, tell me why is there a wait
I’m talking to everybody in the tri-state
That’s New York, Connecticut, my state
Whatever hip hop has turned into is different in my mental
I let y’all continue with the minstrel
Et cetera, me I’m just a replica
Of what two turntables a mic by a cold park bench do
Stop it frauds, can’t mock it cos it’s raw
I’m the closest thing to cardboard boxes on the floor
Anytime the track is up, jail cells acting up
Living room bagging up, subway tagging up
And niggas say I lost my mind
I know where to locate it if need be, believe me
On Pandora with the rest of my kind
Now you owe cause I invested my time

When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you

It’s a man’s sport, damn y’all the show’s here
Y’all can camcord, backpacker without the Jansport
Tight jeans, weird style, I don’t rap politics
Socially aware, but I rather not acknowledge it
Sneaking in dorms, but wasn’t on no college shit
How they think I’m crazy, what I’m showing them is moderate
You damn right I talk a lot of shit (why?)
Cos I don’t mind playing dodgeball with hollow tips
No success having, living off old times
In 010 you dragging that old shine back from 09
I don’t get you, every interview my dick in your mouth
I wasn’t that blessed when I was with you
Why they wanna make c4 ignite
Benzino called him weird, he couldn’t be more right
Too busy trying to do what you incapable of
Time is money when it comes to mine take it in blood

When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you

New year, same old, bad broad, waist hot
Burner staying on his own waist high
Rumours fall by the way side
They try but ‘til I may die
Best rapper in the whole world til the day I
Take ‘em to the cleaners
I make sure there’s a nina
In arms reach of every locker at all the arenas
Ice cold, not hot, never buzzed, has been
Wanna be, never was, mask on, leather gloves
Niggas ain’t shit, how the fuck is they a threat to us
Start the fight, next minute screaming out they set us up
All the blogging ain’t solving a thing
Niggas wouldn’t want a problem if they knew what it’d bring
While the light on his tunnel keep dimming, Ima keep winning
Rookie of the year, about a buck what up B. Jennings
Pointing guns online don’t let me know what’s real
Sometimes silence is the best overkill

When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
