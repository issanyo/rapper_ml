[Verse 1 - Pryde]
Seconds to minutes, I'm blowing up on you cowards
You say you run everything
But I be double the hour
Cause I be killer words so deep: dedicated
While I work you sleep
The rule is: more slumber, no music
The tanks on E I ain't running on fluid
Being inactive right now means less fame
No sleep: that's the best way

[Hook]
They trying to stop the movie
But this film already started
I told you I do this all day
No sleep no nothing
Cause I'mma stay up, no sleep no rest
I do this for the love, won't stop til I'm the best
We gonna work, we ain't sleepin
So if you ain't thinking, get a pillow
And a blanket boy


[Verse 2 - Pryde]
Stopping ain't an option
An object right next to common
I ain't sleeping I be rocking tonight like Batman and Robin
It's a grind no lie, I ain't up on the fence
No slumber I ain't cuddling with the cousin of death
On the move like repo, catchin up to me, no
Hustling every day, making music by the kilo
Cause baby I be living, so listen, I'm flipping digits
By the minute I be killing way more records than Guinness
And I be rocking, they stunning
I am the object they surrounding
I ain't looking like a milli but a dollar, I'm about it
You see our schedule? We nuts
And having a curfew is like a pre-nup
If you hating on my grind, though, speak up
Wanting to be a millionaire: Regis
As of right now means less fame
No sleep: that's the best way

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden]
I was taught two things: never speak to the feds
And if you wanna make money, gotta sleep when you dead
Came from the bottom, used to work me like a slave horse
I'm saying I paid my dues -- have you paid yours?
I never majored in a business class
But you couldn't tell when spotting me in business class
While the hood wonderin' how he got rich this fast
They ain't understand the science, we could skip to math
I ain't gotta play the blame game
Me, I got a lifestyle I'm trying to maintain
I can't entertain lames
Cause they try to knock me down off my high horse
But I'mma worry about mine while you ride yours
A few people trying to keep me from the spot
But if your grind was like mine you would meet me at the top
I came a long way from selling CDs on the block
With no sleep, now believe it or not
Talk to 'em

[Hook]
