[PART 1]

[Intro]
You don't have to be afraid
You don't even have to be brave
Living in a gilded cage
The only risk is that you'll go in

[Verse 1: Honors English]
Damn, it feels good to be a gangster
All these rap-rap-rappers are in danger
I spit that crazy shit, be going over they head
They say I'm the illest, only getting thirty percent
Maybe I need to slow it down, give 'em a slow rap
Hmmmm, maybe a gold tooth, that'll give me that gold plaque
Got a co-sign just so they call it ''a dope track''
All I need is yes men and a lil' sell-your-soul-swag
But I don't disrespect women every 3rd line
And I didn't buy Jordans for the 23rd time
I am less about fashion, more about real shit
Enough about the dress, I mean Kanye already killed it
I say turn the lyrics up, they say whatchu talking about?
Put him in the psychoward, you belong in a slaughterhouse
Oh, my fault, I'm not popping that molly
But check in Africa, you'll see I'm popping in Mali
That's presidental shit, you can't tell me I'm in the lead
And now I got success, now they all wanna succeed
But you gotta be brave if you wanna change the game
They confuse hate with love so fuck it I hate it
I love it - I'm insane

[Bridge]
The only risk is that you'll go insane
The only risk is that you'll go insane

[Hook]
And I, I, I, I think I'm losing my and my, my, my, my
I think I'm losing my mind and I
I think I'm losing my and my, my, my, my
I think I'm losing my mind and I
I, I, I, I think I'm losing my and my, my, my, my
I think I'm losing my mind and I
I think I'm losing my mind, I
I think I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Check - they wrote him off a long time ago
You would almost think they heard the wrong rhyme from Joe
Fuck myself over masturbation
So you're witnessing the growth, call it maturation
Now I don't let it tempt me, ying yang, I'm extra friendly
To all the folk that was extra and tried to end me
Shots of yack on my, they shocked we in the same building
They thought they made it collapse on me
To the accident murderers, take the time to remind 'em properly
Next time, stick around, make sure you find the body
Or kill that plan, pull it loose from it seams
And I'll be the last kid you try to put a noose on his dreams
I mean my moms was a misstress, pops was fiend out
Jail was his address, hear my insanity plea
Fuck me like you tried to and the next kid you try to lie to
Might wanna research his family tree, Joey

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Honors English]
Don't sound like you got a brain, tell 'em to join a gang
Say they stick together better than people with wedding rings
Don't tell 'em your car broke, nah, no sir
Even if you caught the bus, that's still a chauffeur
Say that you was locked down, make 'em think of jail
That way you would look forward to seeing your single sell
Skip that you went to school, say that you was on the corner
We'll take a prison record and scribble it on top of ya diploma
So about your wife - uhh - keep that a mystery
Tell 'em about strippers, give 'em that oral history
But I'mma keep it authentic, hope you understood me
If they could be destroyed by the truth, then they should be
I'm on that change the world shit, that's the answer
But I just can't find a big enough pamper
So I'mma be brave and I'mma change the game
They confuse hate with love so fuck it I hate it
I love it - I'm insane

[PART 2]

[Intro]

[Honors English]
I'm a hired assassin
Look at 'em all high'ed up and laughing
Oh, they can sense I'm here, help me re-imagine
I'm ten paces away, he in that royal chair reclined
I'm here to take over the empire state of mind
Ace of spades liquor, lemon pepper wings
Chronic lit up, candle flicker, dinner for the king
Concubines behind the strippers as I enter
I paint myself into the picture
Paint over the Maybach with a Fisker
The throne is for the taking, I whisper
Zip up or I'm leaving, ten Jesus pieces richer
The curtain comes down, a hush comes over the crowd
I tell 'em I run this town, there's no church in the wild
It's just the youth in me, what would you do if you was me?
To think they had diplomatic immunity
Truthfully we started from the bottom, now we here
What's the problem?
Oh, the problem is you got nightmares of the bottom
Cups full of Ciroc, Cuban cigar box
The Basquiat paintings start to watch
The room is half dark, the king summons the royal guards
But they turn on him and decide to pass the torch
I looked at his crown and noticed the shit was off, it was false
There was an ''F' on it and the ''F'' stood for fraud
He drops his fork as the mandate from heaven falls
His record shady, he governed by martial law
Your dynasty is no more, you assassinated what made it pure
You're now face to face with the state of the art
As the band plays the last drums, the choir have sung
His final words: ''live fast, die young'' - done
As we overthrow the king and we dump him in the back
When the cops approach be like ''Yo, it's deeper than rap''
And in the midst of the upheaval
I shapeshift back into the voice of the people
You gotta be brave if you wanna change the game
They confuse hate with love
Fuck it, I hate it, I love it
You gotta be brave if you wanna change the game
They confuse hate with love
Fuck it, I hate it, I love it, I'm insane
Damn, it feels good to be a gangster
All these rap-rap-rappers are in danger
