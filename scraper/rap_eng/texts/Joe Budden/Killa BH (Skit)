It's that Killa BH music. Nah son, nah, ain't no way this mixtape is going down without me, baby. It's ya boy, Killa BH, baby, yeah son. I got that new crack, you wanna hear it? Here it goes

[Verse: Killa BH]
Brandon's name ring bells from coast to coast
Chicks dig me, 'cause my skin's the color of toast
You can come around my way, see me on the block
My pant leg's rolled up, with some yellow tube socks
You see my L.A. gears, you see my Voltron shirt
You feel the pen, you turn blue like a cartoon Smurf
You better make sure you're GEICO paid
Killa BH heat up like a motherfucker microwave
WOOOOOOoooooo!

[Ad-Libs: Killa BH]
It's over, it's a wrap, baby. No one's stopping me, baby. I'm goin' to the top, Atlantic Records, Sony Records.. ButterFly Records... I don't care where it is, baby. Sprinkle fairy dust on it, this is a wrap. Are you in those shoes yet? Why not?
