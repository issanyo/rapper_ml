Who knew
When he was introduced to the world by Webb
He'd be the greatest rapper in the World Wide Web
I mean, assholes' opinions are like assholes
I'm past those, so you could tell the world I said
Learned from Kanye about Common Sense
Make GOOD Music, gotta face the Consequence
They want me to reach for mine while the seat's reclined
How dumb would that be when I ain't even reach my prime
Speak my mind and niggas start feeling a way
Say what I feel, it ain't my fault they feel what I say
Seem like in every interview, niggas wanna mention dude
You took my good punchline, got it misconstrued
Ain't diss you then but nigga now I will
I'm just saying how I feel
Got your camera showing off your tiny townhouse and a girl car
Cause you ain't a world star, not even on Worldstar
The Greatest Story Never Told won't be ever told
Mixtapes never sold, leak the shit, let it go
How you gonna be a big name in the future
Not even big named as a loser
You backed by a big named producer who gave the smash to T.I
Can't even be mad at Just, cause I can see why
Which leads me to wonder what the fans would see
If we turned to Saigon TV
We'd see a artist struggling to get buzzing with the best production
And looked weaker, when that Jay-Z feature didn't help
Fronting with conscious spitting about conscious living
I see, conscious fiction from a contradiction
Listen, I see a insecure nigga trying to prove something
Getting desperate cause his music don't move nothing
So what he do, start flashing bread
You could tell he probably ain't used to having bread, listen
I see a nigga stay talking bout the kids
But wanted nothing to do with one when it was his
You would take her phone calls til she said "it's yours"
That's when they got crisscrossed, you started getting ignor
I see a nigga just fiending for scrunity
So he show us pics of how musclebound he used to be
I have shooters loaded up at niggas
Put plastic everywhere Lola Luv ass nigga
To that other nigga that had me on my bullshit
Rule 1: don't get sheep into some wolf shit
Trust, I'ma see the MF soon
That ain't him behind the mask, he like MF DOOM
But let's get back to Sai, as far as SOB's
I'da done the same thing and been proud, I wouldn'ta cried
You jetted on tape nigga, how you gon lie?
So if you're feeling like a sucka then ask yourself "why?"
