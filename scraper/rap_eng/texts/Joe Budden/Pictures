[Verse 1: R-Mean]
First time I got my ass beat
I was eleven or twelve, you know what that teach?
I ain't forget how it felt, I learnt a lot by myself
In preparation when life come and attack me
I take the pain, accept it as God's will
Though I know my parents refugees like Pras Will
Deep breath, dive into my dreams
'Cause only dead fish swim with the stream, na'mean?
Realest of 'em all
Never had a father figure so I figure motherfuck 'em all
I ain't changin' my opinion for the masses, shit
Only answer to God, so don't ask me shit
Ha, it's what you puttin' out too
How you make others feel about themselves says a lot about you
So I fight for hopelessness, homie, it's hopeless 'cause
Fake friends, fake love, fake smiles
Real Benz, real Louis V
Real stones, real jewellery
And real loneliness (talk to 'em) you know how true that be
Look in the mirror, I know exactly who that be
Me

[Chorus: R-Mean]
All these pictures people
Take of themselves
Still they don't know who they are
Still they don't know who they are
All these pictures people
Take of themselves
Still they don't know who they are
Still they don't know who they are

[Post-Chorus: R-Mean & Joe Budden]
'Cause we all got potential
What you gon' do with it?
'Cause we all got potential
What you gon' do with it?

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I see some of you young niggas wadn't schooled
I was being myself even when it wadn't cool (talk to 'em)
Which just says throughout my menacin'
That if a nigga hate me at least I know it's genuine (talk to 'em)
Authentic, why you holdin' a grudge?
I caught flack all my life, I'm a golden glove
I mean my reality don't change from opinions
Nor is my perception ever altered by minions
Uh, 'cause we all got potential
Some fulfil theirs, some keep a stencil
All our paths are different, got different mentals
Some keep success, for some it's just a rental (talk to 'em)
And me and mines got a chemistry
Heed my words like they comin' out the ministry
'Cause I understand how you felt still
Don't believe in yourself? Nigga, who else will?
Joey

[Chorus: R-Mean]
All these pictures people
Take of themselves
Still they don't know who they are
Still they don't know who they are
All these pictures people
Take of themselves
Still they don't know who they are
Still they don't know who they are

[Post-Chorus: R-Mean & Joe Budden]
'Cause we all got potential
What you gon' do with it?
'Cause we all got potential
What you gon' do with it?

[Outro: Joe Budden & DJ Megaman (Scratches)]
Don't believe in yourself? Nigga, who else will?
Don't believe in yourself? Nigga, who else will?
Don't believe in yourself? Nigga, who else will?
Don't believe in yourself? Nigga, who else will?
