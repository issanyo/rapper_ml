[Intro: Joe Budden]
Uh-huh
Okay
I can dig it

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Listen, I don't wanna beef witchu, uh-uh
You think I just wanna sleep witchu, uh-uh
You my queen, and baby we gon' make it together
Westside highway, see [?] ([?])
And I can't have you done up crazy
Can't ice your neck now, but dig, I'm on the come up lately
Think all men are dogs, I redeem the name
And she won't give you the drawers, yeah, things have changed
I know your whole past, it's been hard so long
Ex-man was a lame so your guard's up strong
Soon all you want you could have it
Lookin' like you be gone for a while, you got nuttin' but baggage
Look here, I'ma fix that fo' sho
But that's only if you wit' that, just know
I ain't the type to be crowdin' your space no matter what
I just wanna see a smile on your face, it's so fresh

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
Baby, you say you do
I don't believe [?]
I heard it all before
Don't have the time for lies, I need a guy
Who understands
[?] how to be a man
Ain't afraid to show his love
Are you the guy that I can trust?

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Yeah
Listen, I just wanna chill witchu, uh-huh
I just wanna keep it real witchu, uh-huh
Let me help your dome, you say we a coincidence
I say, "It's God just keepin' himself unknown"
[?] hatin' each other
Or sleepin' in the same bed (wit' her) back facing each other (never)
Think I be in the hood with women
Judge me in the long run, my shit is always good in the beginnin'
Know you hear it all the time 'cause you reppin' those jeans
But I'ma keep it so fresh and so clean
I won't chase and hunt, oh yeah, this my favorite one
Think you know every Virgo 'cause she's dated one
But look, I don't wanna fight witchu, uh-uh
I just wanna get it right witchu, you nah'mean?
You can still go out on your dates no matter what
I just wanna see a smile on your face, but all you tellin' me is

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
Baby, you say you do
I don't believe [?]
I heard it all before
Don't have the time for lies, I need a guy
Who understands
[?] how to be a man
Ain't afraid to show his love
Are you the guy that I can trust?

[Post-Chorus: Lil' Mo]
I want to, I need to
But I can now, I won't now
Won't hurt no more
Won't trust no more
I should now, I would now
But I can't now, I won't now
Won't risk no more
Can't love no more

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Before me you I know you had regrets in my life
(But) But you lacked good sex in your life, pardon self
Before you I liked to ball, plus I was hoein'
How could I know my type 'til I tried 'em all?
Ma, I don't wanna step on no toes, but gotta know
I won't change who I always be, regular Joe
Always hold you down, had you safe in your spot
Have you takin' it off when I'm makin' it hot
'Cause I'm gangster, you can't fuck wit' it
[?] real niggas don't fall in love, we stand up in it
She's feelin' you out, I'm in sync with you, babe
Tryna tell you what's what, but you thinkin' it's gay
'Cause I've been there, done that
Tryna have it when we break up up come back, it's all love
I'll get them doubts out of your way no matter what
I just wanna see a smile on your face ([?])

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
Baby, you say you do
I don't believe [?]
I heard it all before
Don't have the time for lies, I need a guy
Who understands
[?] how to be a man
Ain't afraid to show his love
Are you the guy that I can trust?

[Post-Chorus: Lil' Mo]
I want to, I need to
But I can now, I won't now
Won't hurt no more
Won't trust no more
I should now, I would now
But I can't now, I won't now
Won't risk no more
Can't love no more
