"Pump It Up" came out, was a hit all over the country
And so I figured all over they'd want me (Yeah)
The buzz was there and the feeling was timely
And Kev said that he would put the whole building behind me (Yeah)
The whole office daps me freely
And Mr. Cohen always seems so happy to see me
I'm treated like a new man, musta got a facelift
This what I dreamed of welcome to the matrix
BET rated me "Next" we coming up Jersey
Air time, MTV Buzzworthy
If that ain't make things final
The song played all throughout the World Series and the NBA Finals
Wrap up ya album Joey it's goin out now
Only problem is my voice is goin out now
Doc said I need a surgery to fix it
And if something goes wrong it could be permanently TWIST-TED!
Now thats something I can't afford
So steroid shots in my ass just so I could record
The more I talk its ruining my cords and on top of it all
Now Def Jam wants ya boy on tour
This is important you can't back out
It's good exposure and 112's coming back out
I'm on their second single and they're on mine
I'm bout to shine June 10th yup it's time BUT WAIT!
Something must be wrong with the SoundScan
That's when it all started to go down man
Am I wrong or what here?
2 Fast Soundtrack did great and my song was on there
And things the way it seems
The Wow Vol. 7 commercial
Pumping It Up with my face on screen
Had to change my second single cuz theres two 112's/Joe Buddens
But theirs turned into 112/Luda
Lil Jon called me for the "Get Low" Remix
But Lyor was goin through some TVT shit
Then they went and kept Joe off of the "Roc The Mic" tour
Somebody probably thought Joey would rock the mic more
Left the country did a single with J-Lo
But with my luck I knew Columbia would say "No"
Radio hates "Fire" nah they won't try it
But they love that Rah Digga song that sounds just like it
Wanna keep me under dog, I'm the underdog
And they don't want y'all to see up under the fog, so y'all
Tell every man in the hood
Gold album one single I'd say im doin hella damn good
Listen here Def Jam, are you deaf man?
Politics aside please don't interject fam
Listen to my shit now listen to the rest damn
I'm Taye Diggs, The Best Man, thats without a "Yes Man"
Three hundred thou budget I object fam
Did that the last time and I still repped damn
M.H. THANK YOU
Pharrell THANK YOU
Jim Jones THANK YOU
Lil Mo' THANK YOU
Sad part now is when I walk by
And I see Mr. Cohen he can't even say "Hi"
But I'm a new man I feel like I got a facelift
This is what I dreamed of time to tackle the matrix
