[Hook]

It's a brand new day!
Everything is a-ok!
The rain is gone, the clouds are clear
It be a better day-yyy

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I make control of me
I'm feelin' fine, you see it
I know some folks probably messed up my kindness for weakness
Can't bring me down
Though I heard a few tracks
I'm a hundred percent healthy
Got my vertical back
You know the jump shot is wicked
And my defence is seeming so tight
Man, everything's just seeming so bright
I got my game face on
Ready to give back, pronto
Give back to the fans
Get back to Toronto
Going back to the basics
This'll be fun for me
No chase to the game
Yo, Ima let it come to me (uh)
I'm revived, it's time to get it together
Everything's lovely, folks
I'm feeling better than ever (sing it)
