[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
We ain't even got no respect for each other, no trust
All we do is check on each other
You bring the fucking worst out of me
We don't better each other
Now when I met you, you were calm
Now we fighting all these battles
We can't win like Vietnam
You flipping out in our home about the same shit
Screaming on me, complaining and you waking up
And you blaming me for your bad dreams, are you crazy?
I say that I can't take it but I think that I'm addicted
If it wasn't for the drama then I'd probably have no interest, huh Yeah I had a few chicks but now I'm only with you miss and you schizo
So I don't need to cheat cause everyday, you a new chick
Yeah you crazy but I love it, you wildin' when we talkin'
But you wilder when we fucking, bang

[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
My bitch is crazy, this bitch is ill
You tripping hard, you gotta chill
An what the fuck is with you lately?
At first you love me, then you hate me
My bitch is crazy, this bitch is ill (And the fighting then the fucking)
My bitch is crazy, this bitch is ill (And the fucking then the fighting)
My bitch is crazy, this bitch is ill (And the fighting then the fucking)
My bitch is crazy, this bitch is ill (And the fucking then the fighting)

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
You always texting mad, it ain't worth the battery to text you back
Every time you angry, I just want to jump your sexy ass
I remember when your girls was telling you that we'd never last
All you did was try to box me like they sponsor you up at Everlast
Well you get that right girl, god damn, wish I had never taught you that
Every time you mad hanging up on me then call right back
But you ain't saying nothing, you trying to keep that poker face
But girl I know you bluffing, yeah I know you love me
But you spazzing about things that haven't happened
Cause you judge me by your fears instead of judging by my actions Yeah you crazy but I love it, you wildin' when we talkin'
But you wilder when we fucking, yeah

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I keep fucking with these crazy hoes
See the problem for me is that's a turn on
She say it first but I'm way worse
Though she never see that if she don't turn wrong
My tolerance high, I ain't with that screaming in public
So when her voice raise, I lower mine
Make a scene, I'm like fuck it
But she a nympho so whatever's wrong, she'll right that shit
Pull her hair and it's supposed to hurt
But she turn around, say "I like that shit"
We broke up like a million times
It's to the point that I don't hype that shit
Every time shorty gon' storm out, she come around and end up right back with
The funny shit, she call me then hang up on me
But I don't even shout at her she just going to come home
And let me fuck them manners out of her
My daily routine but it's cool cause I'm used to this shit
Plus we done been through the world and back
It's whatever, I troop with my bitch, I tell 'em...
