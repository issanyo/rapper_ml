Check it, I'm the voice of every dead nigga's secrets
That's why the fucktards want me dead 'fore I can speak it
Y'all call it crazy, I'm the heartbeat of every aborted baby
High off every line snorted in the 80s
Let it breathe, no wonder why his thoughts ratchet
See the world through the shades that Stacks wore in his casket
I steal his body from the graveyard on foot, ain't no lookin' back
Bring him on tour with me and when it's over put him back
If you couldn't tell, the behavior
Says if a nigga send me to Hell it's a favor
I never felt that was major
God forgive me or don't, maybe He'll help later
Until I'll share Pac's nightmare post Quad's elevator
Which taught me not to doubt a coward for a thing
Yin-yang theory, shit Juwan Howard got a ring
All it takes is the smallest nigga in your camp to get eternal
Half a match book will transform to an inferno
And jail's so grotesque
That 'cause of my past I can't bask in my success
Peep how my brain masturbates
I mean, I wake up, walk on my deck
And stare at a beautiful yard that just reminds me of the yard
I unlock a cell, a buried man, wrongly accused
Bet it all, the judges to put him there, won't be amused
This ain't Joe y'all, more like the mind of every rape victim
Who can't retrace the face of the nigga that had his way with 'em
When my heart stops it crops
Every 9-1-1 call that took too long
But don't look at it wrong
'Cause the irony of my group's name is, though he seem the luckiest, where we lay our heads seems to be where it's bloodiest
To say we're rebels would imply we're against
That's a lie, nigga, we just convinced
So in case the puppet-masters didn't know Joe
They tried makin' us the guinea pigs
We just killed it and kept it as a logo
