I must admit, I'm kinda freaked out, don't see what the big deal is all about
One day it won't hurt, but I'm not to that stage, I think in time I'll start to act my age and step into the story where anything goes, it's always been this way, I suppose. Hoping I'm doing all right, I take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown
This will be my saving grace, that somewhere in the human race, there's a girl who can replace you - just a simple cut and paste - then I see your face... Where will I ever find another girl like you?
I must concede that I've been misled, missing you keeps messing with my head. But when I'm alone, I kind of freak out, knowing what the big deal is about. - I'll step into the story where anything goes, it's always been this way, I suppose. Hoping I'm doing all right, I'll take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown
Every night I contemplate, the love you handed me was fake, if I can't bend I might just break - you just might be my last mistake, still I'm gonna take - a chance and try to find another girl like you
And I want her to be, a little kinder too, I just want her to be, - a little less like you!
I must admit, that I've been confused, and its gonna take some time to shake these blues - and step into the story where anything goes, it's always been this way, I suppose. Hoping I'm doing it right, I'll take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown
Way down underneath my skin, there's still some love I once fell in, I don't mind starting out again - If I don't play I'll never win, still I'm wondering - where will I ever find another girl like you? I just want her to be...
