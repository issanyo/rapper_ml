[Intro: 3rd Storee] (2x)
You should get with me
If you get with me
You should get with me
If you get with me

[Verse: Joe Budden]
Lady, think I just wanna hug and squeeze?
Think I just wanna touch and tease?
Mami I ain't tryin' to cut and leave
I'd rather cruise the crib let you touch the Keys
Said your ex made it hot, I'm a up the degrees
But lady, it's not a game
I ain't lookin' to kill you with corny lines
Like "you lookin' familiar" never ever, ever ever
You the one I see in my eyes
And I'm just wantin' you to be at my side
Holler at her

[Verse]
Do I look like I'm fakin' with you?
(And I) Am out to hurt you
(And I) Do care about you
(And I) Just wouldn't love you
(And I) Won't get me to you
(And I) Just want it from you
(And I) Is not out to please you
(And I) Could show you I'm true
(If I) Gave the world to you
(If I) Showed you how I do
(If I) Make your words untrue
(If I) Tell you I need you
(If I) Said my heart's for you
(If I) Can't live without you
(If I) Can't sleep without you
Would you know I'm feelin' you? baby, yeah

[Hook: 3rd Storee] {* over chorus}
What do I do? You should get with me
To show you that I'm really feelin' you If you get with me
You would feel me You should get with me
If you just let me get next to you If you get with me
I know I'll do You should get with me
Whatever it takes to please you If you get with me
Baby you'll see You should get with me
If you just let me get next to you If you get with me

[Verse]
If you would just hear what I say
(If you) Would just look my way
(If you) Would not turn away
(If you) Would see I don't play
(If you) Just listen to me
(If you) Knew what I can be
(If you) Weren't playin' to me
(If you) Were open to me
(Then you) Would see what I'm 'bout
(Then you) Know how I get down
(Then you) Would see I can please
(Then you) Would really want me
(Then you) Would know that I'm true
(Then you) Would see that I'm into you
(Then you) You might decide
To make it me and you, baby!

[Hook]

[Verse: Joe Budden]
(Wait, look)
You a Glamour Miss
You don't know if I could handle or miss?
C'mon now, I got stamina Miss
And don't think cause I'm into ballin' that I'm a control freak
I won't stop them male friends from callin'
And I ain't talkin' kids and marriage
You been hurt in the past
Not a thing, I get rid of that baggage
If we - get together, cop mansion, whip together
And if I slack up I get it together
I picture your skin covered in the softest fabrics
Daytimes, Central Park we in the horse and carriage
Or let you push forces and karats
Don't take it as a gift, baby girl
If you my all you could have it
(If I) and could be that dude that you want in your life
(If I) and could put the future right in front of your eyes
(If I) and couldn't live after all that I say
Do you think that I'd go out of my way?
Answer that mami

[Hook] (2x)
