[Verse One] [Joe Budden]:
Circa 01 homeboy, he a vet
I'll make 'em have a deep regret like they Tequila's neck
Word is I made the old heads be upset
Cause I'm a student of the game, not a teachers pet
Handsome homie, fam don't know me
Would have brought New York back but I left that for D'Antoni
Damn that Joey, one of the wildest
Picked this myself, wasn't done by a stylist
If I paid a nigga it ain't done with malice
It just means my boys havin' fun with the cowards
Temper temper, your genders tender
You lightweight sweet, you a Splenda ?
Look
Motherfuckers keep asking, "Where you been Joe?"
I'm in a Jersey strip club with my brim low
A few grands in my pocket, Predator
On the loose, yeah nigga Chris Hanson can't stop this

[Chorus] [Chief C]:
Just one more mile
I'm on the road to the riches
I got my mind on my money
These niggas focused on bitches
This a letter to my enemies, I hope that you get this
And I know these niggas listen, so don't you forget this
I told 'em I'm unstoppable
Yeah
I feel like I'm unstoppable
It's KMG

[Verse Two] [Emilio Rojas]:
I learn about my worth in the game
Homie I worked in the pain
And I kept earning on my personal gains
These little lames that wanna hurt me with shame
So they diggin' they own graves to shovel dirt on my name
But I came in, professionally, messin' with Green
Fucked with Em' then Nas and then it was me
Shit
And we be whippin' in the city movin' mad slow
I don't need a circle cause Emili' got a backbone
My tracks harder than trash all of you cats author
And when we go into war y'all boys draft dodgers
The bathwater means your boo was here
You find a condom ? she kept it as a souvenir
If you are hearin' about the skirts I nail
You know I can build Venice with they birth canals
I'll have you family in church with vows
Crucifying while I hurt the nails


[Chorus] [Chief C]:
Just one more mile
I'm on the road to the riches
I got my mind on my money
These niggas focused on bitches
This a letter to my enemies, I hope that you get this
And I know these niggas listen, so don't you forget this
I told 'em I'm unstoppable
Yeah
I feel like I'm unstoppable
It's KMG
