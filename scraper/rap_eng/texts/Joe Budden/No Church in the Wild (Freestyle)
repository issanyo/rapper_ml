Y’all can threaten me with ya thoughts, just never speak it
One gun accompanied by prayers I never need it
Burning flesh, skin peeling, slow inferno
Take away what we love we’d all be Joe Paterno
Reporting live from the city where they gun tote
Sober in the sauna full of blunt smoke
Y’all concerned with Drake and Common
Me? I’m concerned with niggas havin’ fake in common
Though I’m leading I don’t really know the path
But the future can’t be worse if you really know my past
Begged to be understood anytime I showed the wrath
But how could I expect third parties to know the half
Like, when the temp rises, but you the candle wick
Sorta like Kyle Williams out in Candlestick
E'rybody shouldn’t grab the hammer by the grip, shit!
Billy Cundiff couldn’t handle the kick, shit
They say I changed since stardom
Can’t share the same success, we ain’t share the same problems
So, got big just to show ‘em what the gym does
Nevermind shootin’: they ain’t show me where the gym was
That’s why I do a lot on spite
So if you, look up to me you got ‘em at the wrong height
I mean, I’m not a role model, I’m a piece of shit
A product of never being given a piece of shit
Breaking day got the grind of a trucker
And my logic ain’t designed to intertwine with you suckers
Loaded 9 is a buffer, but no time for you fuckers
There’ll be bodies in the sewers when my minds in the gutter
Last night I had an epiphany
Then wrote it in my rhyme book in calligraphy
I see so many people looking for validity
That’s the wrong search if what’s lost is dignity
I certainly have grown since Mouse
Chrome under the couch
But I’ll stomp his face to make it known what I’m about
If he on what he spout
Put my Nikes on his cheeks, now he foaming at the mouth! (Get it?)
Reminded when I vent
Nigga God designed it's in the print
Two memos for the spineless, one's repent
Second jewel: even my kindness is a strength
No beef, no malice, not at all
I got no vendetta for y’all
I mean I only want better for myself
Sometimes I even want better for y’all, I swear
There’s no love in hip hop
Irony, not even on Love and Hip Hop
Spacious closets, Persian rugs
Make sure I’m dressed at my best for the jerks that judge
Had a talk with my ex and knew for certain I was bugged
So I let the door slam feelin’ worse then I was
She said all I ever made her feel was hurt and disgust
Which in turn hurt cause that was my version of love
I Care! Clear, yeah, that you need better resolution
It seems the chances, we agree, are forever ruined
You talking bout how, I’m talkin’ about execution
You talking bout now, I’m talkin’ about evolution
But better days gotta come
I’m a good amount of bad, right amount of so wrong
And Heidi Klum left Seal, which only prove my point, shit can only be ugly for so long
Slaughterhouse founder, can't derail the captain
Ain’t enough niggas praying I fail for it to happen
Cause on both side of the coin you’ll get fed shells
In unison, hollow heads from red tails
I don’t wanna see your weapon
To keep me from what I’m destined
Some’ll see that as a blessin’
And my dudes swear they’ll keep me happily from harm
So I do the leg work, they carry the arms
Check it, shorty I had over Saturday
Never act away, and squirted ‘til she oversaturate
She go hard in the dark
No chains, but see I’m gettin' it, even when the car is in park
The hood is on some bullshit
So it ain't weird to see ‘em aiming at the pulpit
Fates are empty, collection plate, spirit in ruins
We used to a different type of communion
When guns take the place of the choir, tie up the pastor
If he scared can't believe what he say ‘bout the life after
The stained glass is bulletproof
Sometimes a liar's mouth can be full of truth
I done heard gospel from a sinner
Told me to season my pride if that’s dinner
Said there’s no human that walks without sin
So we should probably call the gates make sure we allowed in
