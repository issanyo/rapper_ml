[Joe Budden]
Joey Talk To Em
Hoping my true motherfucker know this be the realest shit I ever wrote
It's Its That On Top Muzik
I be at the mall, walk up in the store
Glance up at the wall, pick out a few kicks
I need 11′s in these
Matter of fact while you at it bring em’ in a size six
I take shorty’s shoes off
Like here try on these J’s make sure them shits fit
But in my head it gets thick, sayin'
Joey fall back, cause that's not your kid
I don’t know you lil nigga and plus I got a son of my own
But he’s at home and the ways he's being raised I don’t really condone
Naw, cause his pops been gone, fuck it
I'll explain it to him later when he’s grown
Old enough to have a phone
Askin' why mommy hate me
And he got the sneak to call me whenever he’s alone so
You wouldn’t know it but I got a soft spot for you
See, we would shared the same obstacles
Looking from the outside may seem like you neglect him
But when he slips up and calls me dad, I correct him
I protect him, when baby girl start ventin' about you I say, respect him
And though it seems out of order
My own mistakes have turned me into your biggest supporter
Fast forward, you wouldn’t believe
How I could love like mine what I didn’t conceive
Tryin' to help him reach shit what I never achieved
Am I doin' it for him or is it my own greed cause see
Me and my baby moms, we don’t do the conversations
Son cramped in the back, two bedroom shack
With seven people livin' there just congregatin'
So when your child with me, I’m over compensatin'
I’m talkin' eight bedrooms, seven baths
My son thinkin' that’s the shit that only heaven has
Mine's gotta keep it cool, yours get to see the view
White marble around the ground, heated pool
Mine's got to go to The Y
Shit, yours just got to walk outside
And the irony of it all, and it's just sad
Is you walked away yet, I’m the step dad
And then you get on Skype, sayin' how you being, whats the word
And I be on the background listenin' like
This motherfucker here got some nerve
He says, bye Daddy, I love you
I be wantin' to snuff you but wouldn’t want him thinkin' less of you
But, he's perceptive and this shit's wild
He picks up on everything and he's just a child
So through all my resistance
I’m afraid this two-year-old can already see the difference
He sees you don’t provide when you’re capable
Why we never fix things while were still able too
So you’re annoyed, it kinda of hampers me
Get my boy, I always wanted a family
Just to greet when I get to the door
You gon' have to take the L, I can't give you yours
I’ll do all the work, you ain't gotta be bothered
You can be his dad, I'll be his father
I relate though, so I know it hurts
Got to be uncomfortable when the roles reversed
