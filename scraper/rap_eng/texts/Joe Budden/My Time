[Intro]
The alternate route is a long one
But ultimately, in the end, it gets you to the same exact destination
Yes sir, the journey's been long
And the wins have been short
But today, none of that matters

[Verse 1]
The time is now, zoom, get close
The ego is gone, the room is for growth
But talent is there, the feeling is new
I mean, bottom is gone but the ceiling is too
I was higher than Whitney, headed toward the top again
Everything I write crack, like its with a Bobby pen
But it's more than what you hear in a song
The wings are extended, the fear is gone
Hold up, the clips are loaded, safety is off
The business is in the black, I ain't taking a loss
Hold up, standards are high, hoes never hold out
The touring is cool, the shows always sold out
The foes are mad, but fuck it no one else cares
The kicks are custom, you'll never see em elsewhere
The stakes are high, the risk is crucial
And they love to hate me, but I love it when they do too

[Hook]
I've been waiting here for so long
Gotta take what's mine
Since time will never wait
Who am I stand up fate?
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time

[Verse 2]
Look, I've been hurt, I could pull up scars
Now the earth is my pull up bar
The journey was long, the roads were slim
Though I thank God today, I probably owe it to sin
Streets were hungry, I was torn apart
Even though them jails were cold, they warmed my heart
Was living the worst, but prayed for the best
Ain't have a thing given to me, had to rape success
Had to be used for approval, had to use whatever was useful
Had to act old even when youthful
Money don't make me, that ain't what I kill for
Cause I was richer than I'd ever been, and was still poor
Some never thought he would propel
Some talked to me just to speak to themselves
Some broke their arm, all while reaching for wealth
So when you come into the game, make sure you leave with yourself

[Hook]
I've been waiting here for so long
Gotta take what's mine
Since time will never wait
Who am I stand up fate?
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time

[Verse 3]
We all got demons, a few I rivaled
Looked em in the eye, and they became suicidal
They thought it couldn't happen, they were too prideful
His head's an ornament on the wall as proof I survived you
Bills were high, money was low
Strip club was popping, wasn't money to go
Going nowhere fast, but drugs was a one stop
Couldn't shine selling that tan, I had my son blocked
Now I'm on acres, in a house, with a loft
The women are foreign, their blouses are off
It's a whole new me, I redefined my style
And since yesterday's gone, I guess the time is now

[Hook]
I've been waiting here for so long
Gotta take what's mine
Since time will never wait
Who am I stand up fate?
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time
