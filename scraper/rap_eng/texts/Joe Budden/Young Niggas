Gun out

[Verse 1]
Yo
My struggle's a little different, y'all niggas was sellin', I was sniffin'
Psyche, rewind it, I'm just kiddin'
I was hangin' with old cats, tryna put my bid in
Same safe you was stackin' in, I was tryna get in
Y'all was fuckin' with pigeons (Nah)
I was on Malcolm X, lookin' for a jar for my cig to get dipped in
Was still spittin' before the video vixens
Around the time Ewing had got dunked on by Pippen
Niggas was still pitchin'
I was stealin' money from my moms anytime she left her purse in the kitchen (That was fucked up)
Guzzlin' a fifth and I was high as a fuck
OD'n on Visine, so my eyes wouldn't glisten
Moms still bitchin', she thought I knew better
But I didn't, she tried to talk to 'em, wouldn't listen
It's almost like somethin' inside of me kept itchin'
I thought the streets loved me, nah, who was I kiddin'?
God lookin' like the devil (Oh), sendin' me to the pawn shop
Anytime I found shit that looked like metal
I dropped outta school, nah, not to be cool
I was sittin' there bored, thought all y'all was fools
Fuck I wanna read up on Romeo and Juliet?
Way back, I ain't even have my first toolie yet
Angie ain't even make that knife go through me yet (Talk to 'em)
Matter fact, I ain't even smoke my first bollie yet
Tried to have it wrapped, but things wasn't a doobie yet
It was comin' for me, but nah, it ain't subdue me yet

[Chorus]
Young niggas, know I used to be a young nigga
I used to pop off to prove I ain't the one, nigga
B and E's, stick ups and dirty guns niggas
This before I finally had my little young nigga
Young niggas, God keep me from these young niggas
Not the smart ones, Lord, just the dumb niggas
Might have me thinkin' I'm still one of them niggas
Shit changed from when I used to be a young nigga

[Verse 2]
Yo
Ayo, my first time locked up I was a child
Met up with mad niggas I ain't seen in a while (Yeah)
And it wasn't bad bein' locked in with them (But)
But couldn't fathom lockin' in at 10, like fuck readin' a book
Sat on my bunk, mad time to get my thoughts straight
One month, one shower, still without a court date
Just bags of nicotine, rollin' paper
I did pull ups, push ups, how the fuck'd I get here?
War stories, you hear a lot of shit here
Great place to visit, but nah, don't wanna live here
Nah, gotta get my mind in a new place
Grimy ass niggas stealin' my socks and toothpaste
Can't ever remember feelin' such neglect
But snakes get snaked (Dog), what the fuck'd I expect?
I thought if anything I had earned niggas respect
But niggas hung up soon as they heard "Collect"
Had my mag with the tits out
O.G.s' said to me the streets don't love you, they'll be there when you get out
Bunch of the same people, stealin' the same space
A few of 'em'll die, a few will take your place
I prayed to God that I never catch another case
'Cause CO's just treat us like we rats in a maze
You wonder why Joey always hype and smilin' (Why?)
I was this close to Rikers Island
Was bein' on Rikers, wilin' (Wilin')
I done been through way worse shit than havin' a few gripes about my album (C'mon)

[Chorus]
Young niggas, know I used to be a young nigga
I used to pop off to prove I ain't the one, nigga
B and E's, stick ups and dirty guns niggas
This before I finally had my little young nigga
Young niggas, God keep me from these young niggas
Not the smart ones, Lord, just the dumb niggas
Might have me thinkin' I'm still one of them niggas
Shit changed from when I used to be a young nigga

[Outro]
For real
God keep me from these little young niggas, man
'Cause I'll fuck around and get a bid
Make me somethin' stupid as shit
Made me resort to beinâ€”
Bein' a old me and shit
I worked hard to get money
I ain't tryna go back
I ain't tryna go back to the hood, keep my eyes lit up
Keep me from these niggas, for real
