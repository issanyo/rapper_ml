[Intro: Joe Budden]
I say we both spend some time with our memories
It's too bad that memories is all we have now
Do you remember like I do?
If you do then, you should have no choice but to feel the way I feel

[Hook: Emanny]
You're gonna miss me girl
And the way we were making love
You think he is me, girl
But you're just faking us
Go ahead, pretend that you love him that way
Like you wouldn't come home whenever I say

[Verse 1: Emanny]
Cause we got too many firsts
Turned into too many words
And you always said it was the truth
But why were you surprised when I began to hurt?
And I ain't let you go
Just to be in the club throwing money on a stripper
And just because I'm gone
You ain't gotta look for love just with any other nigga
You're like beautiful waterfall
With nothing to land on, yeah, yeah
And now that your man gone
You ain't got a leg to stand on

[Hook:]


[Bridge: Emanny]
Cause ain't nobody ever gonna do you like I did you girl
Ain't nobody ever gonna kiss you like I kissed you girl
Ain't nobody ever gonna touch you like I touched you girl
Ain't nobody ever gonna fuck you like I fucked you girl

[Verse 2: Emanny]
When you had my love you ain't do right
Try to let it burn, but it won't light
We step in the dark soon our love shined
And I know the love we once shared is dead and gone
But I ain't let you go
Just to be in the club throwing money on a stripper
And I ain't let you go
Just so you can be a ho and go fuck another nigga
You're like beautiful waterfall
With nothing to land on, yeah, yeah
And now that your man gone
You ain't got a leg to stand on

[Hook + Bridge:]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I'm dealing with the past presently
Maybe the ass was that heavenly
I always thought that we'd last till I was seventy
Before I knew that whenever I'd spaz you wouldn't let it be
And I don't care if everything he do is brand new
Known him for some months, so could he really understand you?
Maybe we both got tired of being mishandled
And when we tried to fix it all is when we lost the chance to
So I'm with this new bitch trying to get her to take to me
And the greatest part of her not being you is the new slate to me
Your with this mutt nigga, fairy tale, make believe
But you so confused, I don't know who you trying to make believe
Maybe you just needed a break from me
Or maybe you can't tell exactly how bad it's breaking me
Or do you want anybody that you can give your all?
It's so bad sometimes when I'm alone, I relive it all
Walk in, pick you up, throw you on the bed now
Sucking on your nipples, till you want a little head now
Marathon sex, I see us racing up the stairs
Went crazy anytime I let my face be your chair
It's like a never ending dream, never ending screams
Getting wetter with every stroke, it's like a never ending stream
Switch it up, knees spread apart, hands up on the headboard
Couldn't sing for shit, but that dick will make her hit every chord
But do you miss a nigga sometimes?
Just the thought of that question is kinda wrong to me
And if so, then we should fuck again just one time
Don't try to fight, know that pussy still belong to me
Running from the dick, I pull you closer, make you run back
Can you picture a scenario where you would come back?
But when I ask, it's like you never got a come back
Which only forces me to think that you don't really want that

[Hook:]


[Outro: Joe Budden]
We at least owe each other that
Just one more shot
We can't let it end the way it did
