[Verse]
You could see the pain in my eyes
You wanna fix it, your words are fuellin' my pride
Makin' me more dismissive, not the mention
You the nigga that’s putting out all our business
Fuck the niggas in suit and ties, boy, let’s get to business
When you dropped the song "NBA," I didn’t understand
Why you ballin’ in the streets and I’m just watchin’ from the stands
Watch my father on the TV screamin’ "Never broke again"
While some everyday struggles happening within the fam
You gotta eat that, know I got a grudge, old nigga
We flesh and blood, old nigga, no if’s, and’s, or but’s, old nigga
Yeah, I think my dad is nuts, old nigga
You claim you care, but I’m not givin’ a fuck, old nigga
And sometimes I start to think to myself
Keep undercover just to cover all the pain that I felt
Blamin' myself and then I listened to the snitchin'
Unconditional dissin' and I realised the relationship we had was only wealth
You coulda seen me, used my name as a cash grab
Another black story about a deadbeat dad
And mama said you didn't care and I'm convinced that I don't either
'Til I look back at myself and see it hurt so bad
And the feelings, yeah, they manifested
And since you love to explore human brains so much, explain to me why I feel neglected
Explain to me why this is so upsettin'
I'm not cryin' because of you, I'm just cryin' because a nigga stressin'
You ain't shit and I really fuckin' hate you
That's not a bar, just something I had to say to you
Isn't that the reason that I'm starin' face to face with you?
To explain my feelings, my reason and my own case to you
Angie, I love you and his songs will never get to me
Joe he paint the picture, but I see beyond the scenery
Everything you said is gettin' clear to me
He can hurt my heart, but he will never put no fear in me
Thoughts after the courtroom
