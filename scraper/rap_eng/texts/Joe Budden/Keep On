[Hook]
Locks off the door, beast outta the cage
You know y'all done fucked up
Should've never let me escape
They say Joey, where you been
I tell em' I never left
Know my bed stay made, lil' homie I never rest
I keep on, I keep on, I keep on, I keep on
Now, now, now, I keep on, I keep on, I keep on

[Verse 1]
Streets still talkin'
I know blocks keep collidin'
Why my stock keep risin'
Y'all know I'ma keep riding till the wheels fall off
I don't trust a nigga, never, I'll be thugging it forever
And keep it tucked for whatever
Just, Run DMC'ing it, tougher than the leather
For the survivors in Haiti that was tougher than the weather
So, pray to God keep me safe from my travels
As I look at pictures of bloody bodies layin' in gravel
I see pain is a given
Got a better job and now the whole city hate me
I'm Lane Kiffin and the game is different
While my new bitch get on top, and ride out wit just the tip in
And stupid me be laying there trippin'
You think you on my mind then you insane or sniffin'
It ain't how I'm living, still on my same mission
While you Americans idolize lames dancing around
With their pants on the ground, me, I'm branding the sound
They old and washed up, Larry Holmes
So I usher in the new year screamin' Daddy's home
I seen artists fail thinking they would blow up
I seen niggas cry wolf thinking they wouldn't show up
Might, wonder what I scream Jersey for
Tryna show em' Jersey's more than Jersey Shore
Stealing cars, smoking herb
Won't stop till every deaf ear comprehends my spoken word, ya heard

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Off rap it's a whole 'nother genre, a whole 'nother drama
A whole 'nother muh'fuckin' monster
Tryna get through to the masses
A lot bullshit out there, gotta shift through the traffic
I'm on my J. Cole, J. Elec, Blu, Grafh shit
Since my autobiographic might be too graphic for you to grasp it
Me, I know the diff-er-ence
So I perfer the hate, if they only gon' love me when I'm ig-nor-ant
You niggas is so hollow
Drake got hot, now y'all so big on Mascato
Blinds leadin' the blind
Who the fuck you supposed to follow
Keep up my full throttle, modern day Aristotle
So in scripted, prolly ain't meant for you to get it
More like encrypted, or need to be sent to ballistics
Not for dimwitted, it won't pop up in the statistics
Rebel in my own right, could give a fuck about logistics
Be advised, I ain't tryna silence any critics
Cause, the louder they talk, the prouder I walk
It's like it's a rappers job to lie, how they all ballin'
Some only got two one's on em', Jamal Crawford
Who spit hard as me? Very few arguably
Blogs wan' target me, I'm quick to they archery
Tell the labels Best in the World is how you market me
Lost my liquor license, bums won't get a bar from me
Far as birds, how I get them to the Telly maybe
Have em' on E, ask em' if they been to Chelsea Lately
Fuck Morton's, I take em' to the deli maybe
Should'a known she'd had me up and comin'
I ain't wealthy baby
Put it in layman's terms, way simple
Coming for my old spot back, Jay Leno
And not to let off a shot, but I'm better than hot
They don't need a reminder if they never forgot
