[Intro: Joe Budden]
Joey! Let's go!

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Back in the days before your present
Back when it was a little more pleasant
Before I knew this rap shit would ever lure me in
Let's go back like Mike Fox in the Delorean
Back in the day shit, back to the basics
When brass knuckles used to leave a nigga face ticked
Its back to the Diadoras and the Asics
It's back to the New Edition and The Take 6

[Hook]
"I'm number one—one—one—one"
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 2]
Let's go!
Way back if you able to do the math, yeah
I'm talkin' bout the cool table in the cafe, yeah
When the strip was introduced to pedico
Commodore 64 and Coleco
Not back to Cali, back to the valley
Back to Dapper Dan y'all, back to Bally's
Back before Boomerang, Strange'
Before Zhané and go a little further back to Kwame
Damn, we came a long way

[Hook]
"I'm number one—one—one—one"
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 3]
I remember break dancing cardboards and backflips
The royal blue and the orange Patricks
Wasn't like you homo suckas
I had the low top Converses, I could change my logo's color
I remember way back when every clan was stylin'
Flava Flav clocks and X-Clan medallions
In class see a girl you glance at her
Pass her a note, do you like me? Circle a answer

[Hook]
"I'm number one—one—one—one"
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 4]
Winters not the best time warm it up Kane had came through
The eight ball jackets and Columbia Rain suits
We ain't pay minds to the length of our chains
Transformers was a dance Decepticons was a gang
Y'all I'm talkin bout sheep skins
Talkin' bout wearin' two pair of jeans when moms gave me a beatin'
After school three o'clock we was able to fight
Park dibs y'all two turn tables and mike like

[Hook]
"I'm number one—one—one—one"
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 5]
What about when Public Enemy came out and they dropped a classic
Or the Pee-Wee Herman and the Roger Rabbit
And the nerds took our tests and they passed em for us
Back to the roof top back to latin quarters
The olds school's new school now it's the same ol'
It's back to Filas, gazelles and Kangols
It's back to 40 ounces back to OE
Not back to rope chains but back to gold teeth
I was the class clown just snapping at cats
Let's go back to the (?) with the matching hats
Remember the Real Roxanne, remember all the vets
Remember Kool Moe Dee remember Lord Finesse
I bumped Run-D.M.C. almost every weekend
The Bronx and Queensbridge just couldn't stop beefin'
Kept it on wax they ain't have to pack heat
Back to Ron G tapes, back to Black Sheep

[Hook]
"I'm number one—one—one—one"
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 6]
Come on say it with me
I'm talking old Bobby Brown before he thugged Whitney
I used bring all my toys in the tub with me
A snotty-nosed kid eating boogers
It was Ultimate Warrior and Jimmy Fly Snuka, uh
Sometimes I read scriptures like Psalms maybe
And I didn't wanna go to church but my moms made me
TV made me laugh
I remember Knight Rider, Kit used to save his ass
Let's go back to spooning back to Black Moon and
Back to when wrestling had its own cartoon and
They used to sleep on us, now they demand us
Will Smith told parents they just ain't understand us
Back to playing the dozens
Back to humping our prettiest girl cousin
Psych! I'm buggin
N.W.A. was simply known
Let's get back on the block I'm talking Quincy Jones
I gotta Jones y'all

[Hook]
"I'm number one—one—one—one"
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Verse 7]
Let's go back before I burned the booth
When Tevin Campbell was ill before the whole world learned the truth
Hip hop had a message then, jewels was dropping
I never got what I wanted on back to school shopping
Think about it, used to be about shit
That was back when I still got Easter outfits
We all grew up all older folks
It's more than just the music, it's a culture, folks

[Hook]
"I'm number one—one—one—one"
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

[Outro]
Remember sugar water
What was the name of the fucking drink
That they said the fucking triple K
The Klu Klux Klan and shit had put some shit in and
The black niggas were gon' die - huh?
Whatever that was, you niggas knew about it
