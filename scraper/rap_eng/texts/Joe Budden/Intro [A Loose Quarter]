[Chorus: Emanny & Joe Budden]
Finally got me alone
Waited all this time
Stood my place in line and now
It’s here, I’m finally on
Clock was moving slow
Had some room to grow
Life is short, it’s time
I let these motherfuckers know

[Verse: Joe Budden]
What up everyone that been there
Some of y'all know I never left, I been here
Text baby girl I’ll be back
Got some unfinished business to tend to
Gotta go sell out these venues
Y'all niggas just food on the menu
Doubt y'all know what I been through
But it’s funny watching all of y'all pretend to

[Chorus: Emanny & Joe Budden]
Finally got me alone
Waited all this time
Stood my place in line and now
It’s here, I’m finally on
Clock was moving slow
Had some room to grow
Life is short, it’s time
I let these motherfuckers know
