No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man (When Eminem created Slim Shady)
Behind the lies (DJ Cinema)
No one knows what it's like to be hated (He really started to connect with people across the world)
To telling lonely lies (Have outraged just as many people as the won over)
(Mardi Gras)
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep and I'm stillmatic
The way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still
It's like tryin to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped just knowin any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if
Bush rapped I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money you can't pay me enough
You to play me
Is cock-a-mani you just ain't zany enough
To rock with shady
My noodle's cock-a-doodle
My clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose
Yeah the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor I'm numeral uno
If Assuming
There's no humor in it no more
You know I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need fag to come a tear a new whole in my ass
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind the lies
No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To telling lonely lies
Damn I ain't never kill nobody I promise
An I promise if you try me
You gone hafta to rewind this track
And make me go back that thing'll go 'lack''
That boy'll lay flat so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm an I'm masturbatin
Black peter pan fly till I die
Wat u sayin Bathe in ape
Eve Saint - evie sue what I stay & gat me feelin'
Like scarface light the cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four seater
You know I be high get right in the four seater
Top floor of the four seasons
Four of them whores
An they all know how to cook it up
An look I got some and only one know how ta bag
Bitch bundle up
See it's a cold world so homie bundle up
Clean on this grind full or not get your hustle up
No one knows what it's like (I know that you put a lotta pain in your music)
To be the bad man
To be the sad man (Some of it comes from def jam)
Behind the lies (bein frustratin with other niggas)
No one knows what it's like to be hated (Some of it comes from my chick pissin me the f*ck off)
To telling lonely lies (I'm feelin a lotta pain)
(Mardi Gras)
I'm dealing with some shit homie
It's in the back of my head
An it's some shit homie but I just rap it instead
See I got wolverines bones in me but
The whole worlds throwin stones at me
Like they all got a bone with me
Got a childs mother and I hate her to death
But that's my childs mother so that's my
Mate to the death it's wow how I love her for
For putting little me here
And me and her could be forever
She gonna still be there
Then it's some other niggas
I judged the character wrong but
They some other niggas
Now let's get back to the song
I gotta Drug Problem
That I ain't tending to, cause I gotta enough problems
An my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to Pcp and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately
But nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately
I'm sorta feeling repressed lately
So ya'll been hearin and seein me less lately
Like does anyone notice the regress lately
Look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
Seem disturbed alota regrets lately
Yeah
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings like I do
An I blame you
No one fights back as hard on their anger
None of my pain in the world
Can show through
