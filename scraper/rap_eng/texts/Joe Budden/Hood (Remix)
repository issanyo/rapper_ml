[Verse One] [Sheek Louch]:
In my hood we run around with that thing thing
Sheek let it ring ring
Whatever, we don't care about Sing Sing
Or no kind of federal bing bing
And they feel the same thing, so picture me without my pump
Matter of fact, I can't picture you, getting the jump
Pulling up and I ain't immediately getting it crunk
Uh, dope heads and all that, the jails are jammed in
We got the second crime rate next to Camden
Motherfucker
High speed chases, every blucka blucka
Same dress code, black Chuckas
Sheek and Stimuli, we seen the inner city cry
Little niggas flagging and they don't know why
Til a real Blood or Crip come and kiss them goodbye
And I know it's ignorant, but fuck it, we stay high
And I don't expect you to know what I mean
All you seen on the screen was Cosby show and think you know
Motherfucker

[Hook] [Sha Stimuli]:
I'm on the street where the deals going down
I'm on the road taking trips out of town
I'm on the corner by the neighborhood deli
Bring beef, spray shots leave your neighborhood smelly, whoa!
I'm in your whip when you're turning up your system
I'm the weed you smoke, the liquor that you sipping
I'm in every strip club
Every basketball court
I'm the center of attention in every barbershop talk
I'm in the hood

[Verse Two] [Sha Stimuli]:
I'm in the H double O D where the fiends just might OD
And there's still some that owe me
In my hood people know me
As the one, and only, dude who spit like he's holy
But will still leave you holy if you wanna come approach me
Look
From slap boxing to gat cocking on back blocks and rap got
People believing that this their last shot
To leave the hood, you take the littlest kids
Ask them what they wanna do...they either dribble or they spit
Where it's fast food everywhere
Girls resemble women, where mothers are starting younger and baby fathers are missing
Where we complain about hunger, while there's humans that's starving
Where the cops are killing brothers, we be boosting and robbing
Where the parents feel the stress from having too many problems
Where you gotta check your protection now, they bootlegging condoms
Shit
You see I was hood before I got a deal
I'm real after, I rap but this is how I feel
From where dudes do whatever for a dollar bill
Guess we in a black Real World, call it College Hill
I seen this youngin say he'd rather go to jail
Then to try to go to Yale and I know just how he feels
So you catch us by the bodega with Henny straight and no chaser
I get a standing ovation, my joints in heavy rotation
I feel like heads just be hating because I'm too good
I told you why I'm over your head nigga
I'm too hood, y'all don't get it

[Hook] [Sha Stimuli]:
I'm on the street where the deals going down
I'm on the road taking trips out of town
I'm on the corner by the neighborhood deli
Bring beef, spray shots leave your neighborhood smelly, whoa!
I'm in your whip when you're turning up your system
I'm the weed you smoke, the liquor that you sipping
I'm in every strip club
Every basketball court
I'm the center of attention in every barbershop talk
I'm in the hood

[Verse Three] [Joe Budden]:
If you not familiar might need a little preparation
Duck when the lead is spraying, six degrees of separation
Sent a quiet message to the board of education
Dropped out, got a little bored with education
Smoke weed for recreation or for meditation
Cops come we just tell 'em that it's for medication
Some people promised us they'd be back, left us aiding
Either they changed they mind or had other endeavors waiting
We're telling cops I got no license or no registration
But they ain't hesitating, now they start the pepper spraying
Uh, I gotta leave it's in God's will
If music don't take me out, I know God will
From where we all rap but everybody won't succeed
Some will, the one's we won't believe
You can try fame, it's a crying shame
The value of life is that of a nice chain or dice game
Lose limbs over Timbs or a pair of rims
Some people are born to lose, some are scared to win
Daddy ain't around, way too many single moms
Got the strip to hold it down, singles in they palms
Never mind healthcare, we need help here
Not Section 8, unemployment or Welfare
Notice the guns, pussy and drugs they sell here
Look around homie, you a long way from Bel Aire
