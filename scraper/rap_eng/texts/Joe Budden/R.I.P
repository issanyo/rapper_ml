{Joe Budden]
I ain't got a care in sight
Don't blame me, blame the syrup and the sprite
It's the new shit that they'll find me on
Maricon
Best rapper in the world but need help leaving no doubt
Now that Gwen Stefani's gone
Everybody's a Hannibal
Swallowing they eyes watching what they say
What y'all can do is pray
Before i got reformed nigga Glock went on the waste
Cross-dressing nothing but my mothers stocking on my face
Ain't the one u wanna try so fast
Talk crazy but walk the walk
Left a trail down a psychopath
Disturbing the peace
Swearing the v
Everyone word in my speech to heavy to bear
Become a burden on the beat
Look, I'm dealing with passive aggressive nasty women
That take me form humble beginnings to a happy ending
If it ain't about a buck then it's the wrong thought
You balling on a caps space you in the wrong sport
Attack me cause I say shit
Thats they way of curving that they had me as a favorite
They learning from Larry David
Chrome trigger u blown off the liquor
Prolly a tombstone will come quicker
Patron ain't your nigga
None of you dudes ain't soldiers
Ed helms when you lose your dog blame the hang over
Flame thrower
Get me when the label can't control ya
Can't say the chain smoker
Inside a propane holder
Currency is the plan to bury me where I stand
Fuck a record label I appear courtesy of my fans
And they can try to hurt me but they can't
I refuse to ball my fist while the heartbeat of Jersey's in my hand
So, I tell dude like I tell my nympho chicks
Keep it up and you bound to get fucked
Sounding real tough
Every line he move weight like he's a monster
I'm looking at his keys like Mashonda
Round up the troops
To tell him how he both in the booth
You don't sound like the truth
Wanna be on top of the world
Till he found in roof
Told dudes the old dudes
I'll be the poison on their fountain of youth
Nigga, I create it, you mock it
We know the shits belated when you jock it
Holding shit hostage
Penning that garbage
Before I pull the plug on em sending in hospice
Foreign to you American me
Got it locked its foreign, to you skeleton key
You taken em home
I give em the Sheridan key
You saving the birds Denzel
Pelican Brief
And I ain't tryna but what you selling to me
Done babying grown men
I'm done helping them eat
But they say u only rap about joe
Give it a rest
Grow a set
Dog i spit about what i know best
I got skin made of kevlar
Tough as steel say fuck the skill
And i far along blaze the house Russell built
Bring it on
Sing a long
Ring tone
Blank row
I come with a label that say don't try if seen at home
Just smart, figure i be less dark
Tell a model bitch lets part
Over a stretch mark
But being truthful's too brutal to do
So i lie like a bad teacher
Keep going till your pupils confused
Tired of hearing how you bust your hammer
Though this wouldn't be my public answer
Twice as nice as y'all
Though the fans love you grammar
They act like my bitches
Guess when it comes to me they double the standard
Fuck boy I ain't them other dudes
Pick whatever gun
Son found a problem that he can't trouble shoot
Notice I
So its like
Old school-esque poet like
Prototype
Since these niggas can't flow it right
Fans ain't falling for the madness either
You milking the game its from a bad breast feeder
Make you a believer
Doubt what i said
Moment of silence bow our head
