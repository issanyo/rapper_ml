[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
YAOWA What's up my nigga
You say your name is John
Joell Ortiz
Yeah yeah I know I'm familiar with the interview shit
I know what you gon' ask
I got you, don't even stress it

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
No I don't respond with answers that fit a script
So the repetition'll make a nigga flip
We in the game of smoke and mirrors, those engineering a bigger spliff
Blowing circles out they mouth, getting praised but the shit'll shift
I never lived a myth, if I said it I did it
Never alleged, word to dead I grip the fifth (boom!)
I made my housing tenement a strip, movin' medicine and nicks
When I seen 'em comin' I jetted from them pricks
And still to this day, though she clean, I wish my mommy never sniff
But the hurt is makin' me better with this gift
I'm live with this ink you could, die in a blink and
Y'all got the nerve to ask me why do I drink and
Motherfucker, sometimes I cry when when I think and
Y'all ain't there when them tears bein' dried by the sinkIt was cold in the winter, my community centers who gave me dinner
I ain't mind, my table chairs gave me splinters (haha!)
Set up to be loser but was made to be a winner (look)
If they paint Hip-Hop I bet my face be in the picture
If they wrote a rap bible bet my name be in the scriptures
If shorty say I'm her idol bet her face be in my zipper (woo!)
I came a long way from the staples in my scrilla
Stains on my pants, hardly had a gut
The ladies ain't wanna dance so house parties would suck
All my friends on the wall, I'm in the hall with a couple
Nah I ain't complaining, just tellin y'all what it is
So if y'all going through it now just know that another kid
Made something outta nothing, well I'm fronting, I was never nothing
Older ladies used to tell my mother "Ain't he something?"
I look at a lot of you cats and laugh
Cause I'm the shit man, and y'all ain't even passing gas
When I spit I'm the definition of mastered craft
And all y'all ask about is Aftermath
Motherfucker move on!

[Hook: Iyana Dean + Iffy]
I'm tryin to be, more than what it is you see
For every take, do it just like eternity
But I won't let it hold me down, I turn it all around
I'm movin on, oh-ah, oh-ahhhh, yes I'm movin on

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
L-look, look; I gotta give my own interview
Since niggas that do my interviews focus on whatever's miniscule (like!)
Or paint me as a cynical, but the canvas'll limit you (dawg)
You can't go beyond what there's no limit to
If I think Hip-Hop is dead I think it's being revived
And that comes from me being inside
Where the demons get by, see 'em good-bye
If I'm vehement here's why, come from hearing and seeing venomous lies (oh!)
So the beast in me cried, cause when it's all you hear
Shit get overbear, just when the obey near
And so I try to think straight cause when you stare in the rear
Rest in peace Stewart Skakir, nigga yeah
I'm on another label, not that other label
That mean it's no longer my problem, it's theirs
Some say it's a conspirac'
I say if e'rybody's on the throne, that just more motive to kill the heir
Ask me 'bout "Pump it Up" and I'mma think you sheep
Or you must not know I'm deep
I'm so off of music so y'all could SoundScan every week
Me, I just got my lil' man every week
Jersey City loves me despite y'all beliefs
Cause they was baby stepping, I showed 'em how to leap (ohh!)
Ask me about swag - I'mma change the topic
To lyrics in them raps, plus look at you like a fag
I love e'rybody, don't ask 'bout who I beef with
They burned the bridge but they was standing underneath it
I'm on my grind, Benjamin hunting
Was old since I was young, call me Benjamin Button
And stop using slang just for you to be cool
Cause I go BACK to when it was cool to be you
I'm a hero (nah), no I mean I'm Hiro from Heroes
Y'all chase zeroes
Muh'fucker I just got finished hating ME feelin like a zero
They played De Niro, never been there though
So before your next thought, understand
Know it's MUCH more to me than the man
Either that or move on


[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
It's, it's Nickel
My rhyme's the reflection of Scarface and Prem' soul
Before Jordan was wearin fo'-five; I just look like this, I just seem old
But I had to bleed the blood of a dirty motherfucker
To suffer clean clothes and touch what a king holds
The real estate market is harsh, everything goes
From fo's to who you was doin' everything for
But I cut 'em off and move on to the new checks
New friends. chasin' my new ends with new threats
Watchin' my dreams fold, like a stack of bills
In the pocket of who ain't tryin' to push up daffodils
But we the supergroup, you couldn't
Handle this shit if you was standin' before us carryin' a pooper-scoop
You dealt with shady shit, I dealt with shady shit
But I'm the only one can truly say I dealt with Shady's shit
I mean that with all respect to Paul and Shect
But Ryan and Marshall is all you get
My flow's superb, I love Paulie Rosenberg
What I say in a track, those just words
Baby boy forgive me, I'm just street
Cause I can change into anything niggas want me to be like Mystique
I don't gotta dig deep
To realize Slim bought Big Proof a big Jeep
Because he deserved it, how could I mourn
The same way Shady did over him when he knew him when he attended Osbourne
Marshall I'm sorry, I knew it went left
I ain't into fuckin' my family like incest
If you remember Ice used to be my life's interest
Tell Hailie my wife just had a princess
Since I made up with Em it's nothin'
Else that I could move on from so who wants some
Like a jar of Grey Poupon
You gotta ask anybody in any car, one of them move on

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
Yeah, yeah; when fans picture my interviews
They think I'm in a swimming pool with women who been abused
So they turn into strippers makin' they livin' in the nude
One in the middle blowin' my inner tube
While the interviewer's getting ridiculed
Is this your vision
Cool; let me give you a little jewel
Any dude who wanna sit in my tennis shoes is missin' screws
Don't get it misconstrued, don't get this shit confused
I'm two seconds from prison fool, I'm a different dude
Pistol in my reach man, still in Long Beach man
Hoping if my grind don't help me get out my speech can
I been in the streets longer than Yao Ming's wingspan
You can be MTV, I'll be C-SPAN
I deal with politics, bandanas and hollow tips
Half you rappers follow these role models can swallow dick
Was stressed out over cash flow
Hip-hop used to console my soul, now it's a bunch of assholes
Rap about a dance while I'm targeting cops
Spit some shit for Oscar Grant, hit the sergeant with shots
Make him a Ghost like he part of The Lox
I won't stop recording 'til I'm makin' songs harder than Pac's
If it don't happen, at least a nigga know he right there
Every memory under my Dodger hat's a nightmare
As a kid I had to steal breakfast
And now the best question you have to ask me, is this a real necklace
Where's your beat from Dre; your feature from Cube
These things leave people confused
Cause they know I leave speakers abused, I eat the EQ's
I eat through the beat, what's the secret, I think it's the shoes
Back in Cali niggas blaze and stress
Waitin' on Detox to save the West
Even if the shit is dope it ain't givin' you niggas hope
Unless your signature's wrote on a check from Interscope, nope

Move on, move on
West, Coast, nahmean
West Coast move on
And all that shit in the past about me being on Death Row
Move on, or get moved on
Ha ha, Slaughterhouse, biatch
