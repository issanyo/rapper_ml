[Intro]
Turn [?] a little bit C4 (Come on)

[Verse]
No, I ain't the type to be toyed with, play with
Or played like, "Nah, not at all my man"
[?] me and all my fam
With them M16's [?]
And if it's against me, abort that plan, it's like
Just when you thought he wasn't lookin', I saw that man
Turn into Jigsaw, I might saw that man
Then somebody might snitch like, "I saw that man"
Turn my jam up loud for the man of the hour
Fans [?] Hampton and [?]
[?] never ran out of cowards
Keep a gun by me, I learnt that from Cam up in [?]
"Fam, you want grams and that powder?"
Some dirty dudes with me like they ain't big fans of the shower
Me? I let the mouths of [?]
And hire your house out like I'm Angela [?]

[Chorus]
Ghetto America, lend me your ear
Got some things that I need you to hear
And it go like: Money, cars, hoes, guns that pop loud
Those the only things us ghetto niggas about
Now Jersey (Come on) Queens niggas (Come on)
Brooklyn ([?]) Harlem (Come on)
Ladies get naked, niggas can get [?]
Know I'ma be ghetto till I die, tell 'em why
