[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ch-Yeah
K-Dot
Freeway
Budden
It's Real
Bang Em'

[Hook: Freeway]
Niggas want beef ride up
Then Free hit 'ya niggas squad up, squad up
Then my niggas squad up
If you got trees fire it up, fire it up

[Verse 1: Freeway]
This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
Free packed intro, tech with a muffler
Bring it on you busters, watch you niggas flee
He's making a killing off putting his life on Pro Tools
The new school, the rap version of Aaron Jones
The hair and bones
To rock Jane, to cocaine, to spit game
To get us, they get tucked
Nigga don't get gassed up, might get blast up
It ain't about being tough, but even in them interviews
Every time you see me got a semi in the tuck
Chickens at the label like leave the gat at home
You know those Hip-Hop cops got it in for you
They got it in for us, but they ain't bending us
We got a infra strong enough to flip a code

[Hook]
Niggas want beef ride up
Then Free hit 'ya niggas squad up, squad up
Then my niggas squad up
If you got trees fire it up, fire it up

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
Cops trying to cease my beans
No nice clothes were caught in the morning
Trying to crease my jeans
I remember me as a young buck
Trying to put work in
Same pants for two weeks
But I would iron the dirtiness real
Back then the battle was urgent
Now days you see me in the same shit
I didn't have the detergent
I'm riding Six and Park
You used thought you knew like the back of your hand
Turn around and give the glove
So I learn to stay with you
Cause when your wheels look like Terminator 2
It'll turn your man into a hater, true
Hopefully the pain will stay past then
As what's to come, it's better that what has been
Think about it, but if his problems keep playing, solvem'
Joey and Freeway, still hood, still starving, nigga

[Hook]
Niggas want beef ride up
Then Free hit 'ya niggas squad up, squad up
Then my niggas squad up
If you got trees fire it up, fire it up

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
This is for the Gs, and this is for hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gs
My big Unc still fucking with customers
Greyhound not in town, moving them keys
Hoopty or V12, I'm moving them keys
Niggas know me well, can't move me with ease
Go in your pockets at, take all your cheese
That's how I make my profit, rob y'all when 'ya sleep
It's the black Clark Kent, Superman of this rap shit
Play Superman when them gats spit, and them Kryptonite hollowtips
Make you backflip, then chaperone you to a casket
It's real
Goddamn there's no man like I am, that capables the skills of a genius
I'm not Hip-Hop's future, I'm Hip-Hop's Fred Krueger
A new nightmare, I'm right there
With the head of Lucifer killing you demons
God's children, what can you do to us?
This rap shit ain't new to us
Been real, since Mama was stroller scootin' us
Y'all better get used to us, I'm my own scout nigga
How you recruiting us?
Heh, I call your bluff, they said stop
But then the people said it wasn't enough, nigga

[Outro: Freeway & Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas want beef ride up
Then Free hit 'ya niggas squad up, squad up
Then my niggas squad up
K-Dot
If you got trees fire it up, fire it
I'm here baby
Compton

Minor league year
