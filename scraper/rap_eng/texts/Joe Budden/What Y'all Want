[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I can see what they mad for, shit, I would be mad too
They wouldn't acknowledge me, shit, my name was taboo
Could fuck who I want now, should be my next tattoo
Passed up on your bitch, she'll settle and have you
You live in a basement, me I'm in a castle
And since I'm a drop-out, that's my cap and tassel
Closest thing to a rockstar, my friends call me Axl
To keep it a hundred I think the credit is past due
(What y'all want?)
I mean, shit's to be expected by now
When the top-tier MC's dodge, it don't annoy me
If they hearin' it like I am, it ain't a shock they avoid me
Come on! (What y'all want?)
Personally, I think you niggas is beat
He done battled a million times, he got yet to be beat
Signed to an M&M but it's these other niggas that's sweet

[Hook]
(What y'all want?)
Top down and adopted the crown and
I walk out, fresh kicks and all this hatred on me
And I won't give it back, so y'all gonna have to take it from me
(What y'all want?)
Shoulda got this dough by now
Or should I be that nigga, I could show you how
Been a few years, figured y'all would know by now

[Verse 2]
I see why they call him lame though, I would call him lame too
They wanted me out of here, but since then my fame grew
Used to be on house arrest, bracelet on my ankle
Couple million later and they shocked that I'm the same dude
Quick big up to Wu-Tang, deaded all that Meth stuff
Youngins go and look for beef, adults don't let it fester
Some of y'all still judge though, still believe in Esther
Y'all gonna let that ho stop y'all from hearin' what the best does?
Some of y'all don't know no better so y'all just neglect
So they'd rather compare my current girlfriend to my ex
They say I'll loose my mind if Kaylin leaves me, I digress
I think my track record should show
What y'all would think about my next
Countin' my money like it's gonna make you some
On my dick like it's gonna make you come, bum niggas
See it from my perspective, here's a little word for you
You make enough bread, it eventually goes to work for you

[Hook]
(What y'all want?)
Top down and adopted the crown and
I walk out, fresh kicks and all this hatred on me
And I won't give it back, so y'all gonna have to take it from me
(What y'all want?)
Shoulda got this dough by now
Or should I be that nigga, I could show you how
Been a few years, figured y'all would know by now

[Verse 3]
I see why they think I’m old though, I would think I'm old too
Reinvented mad times, I keep makin' old new
Now a nigga worldwide, back then I was local
And every dude y'all said was better than me then is old news
Modern-day present fans are fickle, it's depressin'
One single, one album, y'all gon' say he with the legends
The veterans be pissed when we pay mind to they selections
And the newbies get gassed every time they Jay Elect them
It’s niggas with more money and less respect
To me that tomfoolery's dead
Bottom line real niggas know what’s more important
And dollars ain’t in attendance when that eulogy said
So let’s get it clear first 'fore you compare 'em to me
Wait a couple years, make sure they don’t disappear first
It’ll save us some confusion, everything ain’t a classic
And everybody ain’t dope, some of that is an illusion
The funny thing about a label push
You never know, shit could go either way
Go ahead and run along side it, end up on the wrong side of it
When your life change it could be only weeks away
I'm a result of the fans and deadin' the middle man
With that logic I don’t got to rely on a good day
Did great on a label, did greater on my own
So pick the MC of the moment and ponder: could they?
