[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Now we were once two niggas of the same kind
Went to holla at a hoochie with the same line
Sorta, honestly Ill never guessed you were a hoarder
And all that would manifest cause of what we both thought of her
So I’m like “how could you get mad of what she thought of me”
I found out seasons don’t only change quarterly
Cause you got bitter, it was real fickle
With me saying “girls are a dime a dozen” to a nigga with a nickel
I guess nobody told him that gossip and slander is not the answer
Wish I’da known that she woulda flipped out of propaganda
Ice in my veins, some people are less skilled
And he brought me up on charges when his ego got killed
When my friends in doubt, they learned a valuable lesson bout
In 30 years I ain’t reckon how to reconcile
What hurts more? The act of getting cut off
Or realizing that your 2 cents wasn’t worth more

[Hook: Scott Stapp & Mark Tremonti]
(So, you know it's hell, you know it well)
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell which is you
(So, you know it's hell, you know it well)
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you

[Verse 2]
Nothing could help somebody switch up more then thirst can
I seen the ill effect that fame can have first hand
Am I to blame for the person that you became?
Were you’re already on that path? Its so hard for me to explain
Look, some indicate that im watching who I never met
I see some things happening now that you would never let
If you were in your right mind
Were you showing me the right person at the right time
Or were you trying to make it easy?
Did it really please you to please me
Did that make you change everything about you to appease me?
My prides in shambles, wondering why and when did you decide to gamble
Or are you competing with Mya Campbell
When did that become suitable
How could you make something so ugly out of what was once beautiful
Next time beauty’s headed towards me I plan to dodge
Until I see its not just being used as a camouflage

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Only reason I continue to antagonize
Just my way of bringing truth into a pack of lies
Reveals peoples true colors, removes a bad disguise
Even though its something I predicted I just act surprised
That way the armor never chinks on me
Drunk mouth, sober tongue homie drinks on me
That way I’m protected, y’all got no choice but to respect it
Seen too many come and go to be affected
And how is it not expected
I’m hip to what its bound to be
And them relationships, combined ain’t weigh a pound to me
And so the bullshit, make sure its tasteful when its done
You can keep your 1000 faces, but try being faithful to one

[Hook (faded to outro)]
