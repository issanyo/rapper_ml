[Hook: James Hetfield]
What I've felt what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free never me
So I dub thee un4given

[Verse 1]
Let's talk about the struggle, let's talk about the pain
Some people say they love you, but that don't mean a thang
Some folks is so naive, not me, I go insane
Some people dap you, they hug you, they do it all in vain
That's my depression talking, maybe it's really real
Maybe them doctors was right, and maybe I'm really ill
See I can't really chill without feeling the guilt of me
Stealing these pills, is anybody feeling me still? (Shit)
Except for the hood, nobody told me, I ever could, instead I pushed
Back when they told me I never would, looking at me, like I was just a crook
I express the hood and what I see on the daily
My scenery daily task force B&E's daily
A task y'all, being me daily they want to put, 3 in me nail me
This is stuff you only read in The Daily
Had product, but ain't supply it then, high off more than weed
So the product just got me higher then, product of my environment
Look at where they put me, and look where they telling me I gotta be
Stop and see, the robberies, the poverty naw fam, its not for me
It's got to be, an opt at least without dudes getting chased by police
So they gave us film, sports, and the gift to make a hot CD
Back to the wall, against the ropes nothings believable, feasible
They don't believe in you, you've been verbally beaten to
A pulp, so the result to you think nothing is reachable
Reasonable, I tell you dreams come true yeah haters, even you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now take your hands, and wave 'em high, they told me I can't, but I said, "Why?!"
Like, fuck it, I'll try not fuck it and die
See, this is real emotion we deal wit' often, and don't reveal it
Often we stuff it inside, but I'm like, "Fuck it, let's ride"
I do what I do, because I do what I do what I feel
They do what they do, in hopes of what they do may appeal
They got a image and persona that they gotta fill
That they better do, for revenue, so labels will be thrilled
Kind-of-feel like a wanted man
I can't talk to folk 'cause when I ask 'em to trust me, all they wanna do is judge me, I'm feeling like they don't understand
I'm feeling like ain't too many people friendly
I feel like ain't too many people are what they pretend to be 'cause I'm in that zone, I feel alone like everybody is against me
Just feel like I'm worst enemy, and naw, its not a cry for no sympathy
I'm just thinking out loud to a crowd, I'm just trying to figure out some remedy
Almost like every lesson, it's like every jewel, every tool that's ever been lent to me
But the moment is gone, I'm like a new born I feel like a man with no memory
Slow it down for a second, make sure I'm not losing you
Or confusing you
I'm delusional, if you never been there, then you have no idea what illusions do
Through and through, I'm hoping these signs ain't vital
Or none of these rhymes inside the recital
Why do it mean, I'm suicidal? I ain't that Houston dude
But I'm a maniac
Don't get over, drunk or sober, this the same way I'd act
And I'm striving to pull together, but at least until these voices inside of me
Go forever, be alarmed I'm liable to do whatever

[Hook]
