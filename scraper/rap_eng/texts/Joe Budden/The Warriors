[Intro: Melanie Rutherford]
Check the scene boppers
Slaughterhouse, still standing
There was a murder last night
And the shit didn't really sit right with me
So I had to tell a story, ohh, baby!
Blood on the walls, street life

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
America's worst nightmare, ahead by light years
Hip hop's only shining star in the night's air
Right here, don't fight fair, what I write, yeah
Might there, throw 'em off like they Bobby Knight's chair
I been where you tryna be, I'm already hot
All about cake, Betty Crock' and spit ready rock
They know my bar came venom in a bezzie rock
Kicks from Fight Club, outfit from Eddie Brock
I'm going for the kill, focused on a steady plot
John Wilkes the Booth like when he dead aimed his nezzie shot
You listening to hip hop's finest
You rewind this, Slaughterhouse behind this

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I like rap, this shit is cool, I'm better than mad niggas
But I'm just as good a crack pitcher as a pad ripper
I say that to say this, don't let mad liquor
Turn me to a bodybag zipper and not a ad-libber
Couple joints ago I was right on that ave with ya
Mad bigger than the catch David Tyree had last winter
I'm not a made-up character, that's a Puerto Rican Brooklynite
With two kids y'all see in them mag pictures
And however I gotta feed 'em I will
All they ever gon' need in life is just, me and my will
Interfere with that it's gon' be more than a beat that I kill
Disrespect with an indirect and you will see if I'm real

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Fuck you blood-sucking parasites
I'm bringing the terror right in front of your parents' sight
You parents' eyes and yeah, I wear a pair of pipes
I wear 'em like cellulite on a pair of thighs
I'm Eric Wright, I'm Ruthless, I terrorize
You'll either perish or be paralyzed, I'm a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
I'm even keeping them heaters when we perform
On stage rocking like we from Korn, the people roar
What they don't know it's a secret war
Inside of a rider I'm seeking revenge on the world for bein born!
And the desert eagle is mi amor, she'll fuck you to death
Blow your brains, either or cause she a whore

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
Allow me to reassure your stripe's worthless
Like a pair of Diadora's when it leaves the Adidas store
Don't be comparing us to rappers
Compare us to the Arabs, this a terrorist attack, uh, boom!
Lord have mercy, we here to destroy everything
You niggas is butter in front a fucking machete swing
Mothafucka I'm fly, I ain't no scary goon
Try me and I guarantee you I'mma see you very soon
Leave a nigga ass out like Prince, take his bitch
Put my Graffiti Bridge right Under Her Cherry Moon
We notorious, pushing them Porsches
Y'all niggas the orphans â€“ us? We the warriors

[Interlude: Melanie Rutherford]
Ohh, wait a minute boppers
Royce, slow down baby

[Verse 5: Joe Budden]
This rap shit is a workout on my legs
A nigga going hard on his bike but too many dudes is jumping on the pegs
They know when that raw shit get recorded
Either let your speakers enforce it or lay down in a moshpit
Of course it's the bosses, acting like officers
Running in these corporate offices
Hungry looking for a four-course dish no matter what the cost is
Like the world's lawless so we don't know what remorse is
Cause the V need like a thousand horses
Slaughterhouse hoodie on, that's my new couture shit
It's Jumpoff! He be the best
Computers rank me number one, blame the BCS, it's they fault

[Verse 6: Joell Ortiz]
Ask about your boy, I'm nice with my hands
Maybe that's why, every last thing I write is a jam
Minus the fans, the flights to Japan, I am the man
Anyone who feel they could see me is in dire need of a eye exam
My mind expands wider than the fanbase of a fire band
And what I release from my diaphragm, sticks to you
Like the wrists of Spiderman, fool a average listeners
What you liars can do but you will die a scam
When I die they will retire my entire hand
For years of scripted whoop-ass, making intruders try a can
I guess the moral of the story is Joell's victorious
And everything's all gravy like Notorious

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I left a nigga dead cause he said he was ready for I
Let the Beretta give him wings since he said he was fly
I'm in my Chevy riding to "Bar Exam" and "Mood Muzik"
They the closest to "Reasonable Doubt" and "Ready to Die"
Crooked I, watch for snitches and wire devices
My 45th, fire in crisis, lift you higher than prices
All my ice, and on the mic, I am the nicest
Me and my bitch ride for life like Osirus and Isis
Yeah, word to Run-D.M.C. I'm Tougher Than Leather-face
Never threw a gun in the trash but they call me Weapon Waist
It's like you moving from the projects to the Hamptons
The way my hammers be sending bastards to a better place

[Verse 8: Royce Da 5'9"]
Let me set it straight, they fans been led astray
Niggas keep gassing with guns with unleaded spray
They don't know they one flow, one medic away
From being taken away from here in the leaded state
I handle all of my serious issues with metal
I stick you so deep in the earth your zipper can tickle the devil
I'm skipping the pick and the shovel, I'm picking you up
And I'm shoving your head in the mud 'til your kickings is level
Pardon I live for the moment, you rhymin I give the atonement
Like the Indians, I scalp and I wig the opponent
But I'm a chief, matter fact I'm a beast
I'm a mothafuckin' Slaughterhouse G, boom!
