[Intro: Gwen Stefani (DJ Envy)]
Uh-huh, this my shit (come on)
All the girls stomp your feet like this

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani (DJ Envy)]
A few times I've been around that track (Joe Budden)
So it's not just gonna happen like that (DJ Envy, Volume One)
'Cause I ain't no Hollaback Girl
I ain't no Hollaback Girl (The Growth)
A few times I've been around that track (album in stores, summer)
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no Hollaback Girl
I ain't no Hollaback Girl (come on)

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Hol' up, yes, you is, let's do this
Jump in that whip that's exclusive
You by yourself, not the set you with
'Cause they don't need to know about the head you give
Oh, I don't wan' marry my
Just need a hour at the Marriott
Bad baby girl at that cherry spot
Ten minutes in, got her cherry popped, you know
These ho's some mosquitos
Seem to follow me e'rywhere he go
Says she got class and don't deep throat (bitch)
You ain't even cute, where you get a ego?
If a few times you been around that track
Then you should know it's goin' down like that
Let your head nod like you bumpin' to the sound of the track
And don't stick around after that, now let's ride

[Refrain: Gwen Stefani]
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Look, got a girl named 7 Up, pullin' a seven up
Ass fat, always pullin' her sevens up
Sayin' I don't buy her a damn thing
Act like Conway ain't a brandname
I won't wife you (nah)
And if I do it'll only be for a couple of minutes
Don't wanna talk, don't say a sentence
We'll be divorced right after I'm finished (woah)
Tell 'em, "Don't throw a ball with me"
It's not foul, I'm just practisin' honesty
There's no quality time, won't be at the movies
And I'ma only call you e'ry few weeks (bitch)
Get in a hooptie
Then I'm not your man, you do your own nails and your own doobie ([?])
But I promise, swear up and down
When it's all said and done won't see you as a groupie

[Refrain: Gwen Stefani]
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
