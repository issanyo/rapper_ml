[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Shawty made me feel like the summertime
Feeling like the summer's mine
Yeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga went
To hang for a hundred grinds, a hundred grinds
She don't know the nights that a nigga been
Down for a hundred nights, yeah, down for a hundred grinds
I been on a mission, I been on a mission
I need you and shawty kissing, I been on a mission
It ain't too much that I listen, but I listen

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Look, the text read "At my place you wanna meet?"
Her mouth saying hello, her legs were saying peace
Her alarm in the morning when she wake up to the D
And now half of the bed wet as she lay naked on the sheets
Biting down on the pillows, swear she take it like a G
When we finish it's to the mission, gotta make it through the streets
We go our separate ways, take a break and let it breathe
Say the same about her face, with all that makeup she don't need
Listen, our conversation is best in the moment
That stimulation to me is greater than sex in the moment
Least until later when I know we'll have sex in a moment
She'll fake sleep for a second and then she'll press up on it (ayy..)
Sometimes I'll wild out and let her friends watch
Sometimes we'll pick a show and just binge watch
That's how we get to round four, we should've been stopped
Dead quiet when she flex, could hear a pin drop

[Chorus: Tory Lanez (Joe Budden)]
Shawty made me feel like the summertime
(She made me...one)
Feeling like the summer's mine
Girl, you got something
Uh oh, I'm horny again for ya
You are the 4am flex for me (flex, flex)
You are the 4am flex for me (flex, flex)
You are the 4am flex for me (flex, flex)
You are the 4am flex for a nigga (flex, flex)
(I like that shit you be doing)
Light the weed, and like to go baby
(You know that shit you be doing) and baby
(I fucks with it)
I wanna get to know you

[Verse 2: Fabolous (Joe Budden)]
Yeah, I be out late tryna get it but you wait up for me
Miss dinner 'cause I'm eating, tell 'em put a plate up for me
They be coming sideways, you gon' get that straight up from me
It's always get your weight up not your hate up from me
It came to me from finessing, baby
By they time it get to you, it's just a blessing, baby
They tried to overlook me, underestimate me
Shining like a diamond, I guess I been under pressure lately
Makeup off and she still pretty
I'm on my way and I'm still litty
I like her 'cause she needs no practice
Don't wear panties, I like easy access
Know her role like she's an actress
Laid up with your boy, G's in the mattress
4am flexing on them lonely hoes
Sipping Bobby Brown, Tenderoni flows
My heart belongs to a Roni
She's my only lover, she's my only love
(One more again it go..)
My heart belongs to a Roni
She's my only lover, she's my only love, hey...

[Chorus: Tory Lanez (Joe Budden)]
Shawty made me feel like the summertime
(She make me...)
Feeling like the summer's mine
Girl you got something
(You know what you do to me)
Uh oh, I'm horny again for ya
You are the 4am flex for me (flex, flex)
You are the 4am flex for me (go ahead)
You are the 4am flex for me (I like it when she flex)
You are the 4am flex for a nigga (I like it when she flex)

[Outro: Tory Lanez (Joe Budden)]
It's obvious you got
It's obvious you got
Obvious you got (go, go, go, go)
Oh baby drinking, smoking and whistling please (uh, flex..)
Soon to be (?) (I love it when she...when she flex
Go ahead, FLEX...)
Oh yeah, oh
Shawty the people stop [?]
(I love it when she flex)
