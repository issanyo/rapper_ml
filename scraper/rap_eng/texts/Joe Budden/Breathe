[Intro: Stack Bundles]
Niggas know the drill in New York and the Queens, it's like

[Chorus: Stack Bundles]
One and to the two, two and to the three
Three and to the four, then you gotta squeeze
One and to the two, two and to the three
Three and to the four, then you gotta squeeze
One and to the two, two and to, uh
(It's that On Top Music!)

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
All righty, now we got
Jerz on the come back, run fag, gun bag
Gun clap, [?] when you hear that pump brrrat
A'ight, everybody on the run brrrat
Dudes by the corner store waiting on that come back
Screaming F me, why?
That's a dumb move like goin' to Brooklyn screaming F.B.I
Or going to Brooklyn playing F.B.I
Tryna shake the scene or tryna be Jayreen, nigga
And I ain't got beef with one gang
Just one clown dude who just got rid of his tongue ring
Put us in a room alone, give us room alone
He knows better, he'd never step in a room alone
When it's all done I'd be leaving the room alone
Sad part is they wouldn't even know you was gone
I'm not a killer, I leave that for my mans
Not a gorilla, leave that one for Ran, but I will steal your keys
A'ight with the hands, yep, shorty, that's right
Any nigga tryna shoot me must'a saw my last fight, yup
Niggas comin' to my hood tryna play me, though
Next time find me, not the radio
Not Kayslay, not Sway, nay
Say it to the kid face, not the mixtapes
I know the truth could hurt you
But, dog, you ain't a million dollar, man, nigga, you just virgil, nigga

[Chorus: Stack Bundles]
One and to the two, two and to the three
Three and to the four, then you gotta squeeze
One and to the two, two and to the three
Three and to the four, then you gotta squeeze
One and to the two, two and to the three
Three and to the four, then you gotta squeeze
One and to the two, two and to, uh
(It's that On Top Music!)

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
All righty, now we got
Jerz on the come back, run fag, gun bag
Gun clap, [?] when you hear that pump brrrat
A'ight, everybody on the run brrrat
Dudes by the corner store waiting on that come back
So when the SL creep I get you clipped
Then one hit of that Nextel bleep, nigga
Roll out predator style, I dot a ma'fucker up
He got eczema now, look, nigga
I'm the blame baby once again, baby
Pitch that black or that white, and call it Wayne Brady
He's insane, baby, with that X and that dust red
Fuck you niggas expect from a ex-dust head?
Beef is back, the chief is back
Grief is back but this'll be brief in fact
You can't rap and hustle, no, not a lil bit
You tryna see cash money but get a lil flip
I'm tryna see cash money, shout out to Lil' Flip
I'm tryna see that dummy block it, a lil fifth
And I don't see how dude want it with older dog
Feeling like a pimp nigga gun-butt your shoulder off
All day, Holmes, it's cool
And we ain't never let your type take the short way home from school
Your gangsters cosmetic, it's pathetic, synthetic
And nobody's sympathetic, you ain't mean it, shouldn't'a said it, ma'fucker

[Chorus: Stack Bundles]
One and to the two, two and to the three
Three and to the four, then you gotta squeeze
One and to the two, two and to the three
Three and to the four, then you gotta squeeze
One and to the two, two and to the three
Three and to the four, then you gotta squeeze
One and to the two, two and to, uh
