Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle
Yo, I know it's fucked what a lack of cake will do
A few people want to move in and stay with you
You wish you could help them more you unable to
Cause the rents a little late and the cables due
You and your girlfriend are beefing in a serious way
You used to be faithful you in a curious stage
Finally got your mind made of going your separate ways...Wait!
Nah homeboy her periods late
Now think
Times running out do it quickly
Cause she start crying moods getting sticky
If I don't want it she'll want nothing to do with me
Just get the abortion and I give you the 250
But if you say that to her then you wrong
You didn't think about that you was getting ya groove on
I can't take care of myself never mind a new born
I guess that pussy got too good for too long
Seem like my money goes by too easy
Why I hate that my job only pays bi-weekly
My hooptie done shitted
You spending more money trying to fix it
Then what you did with trying to get it
The fridge is empty but I survive the hunger
Who the fuck keeps calling from this private number?
There's crime on my mind and my nails are dirty
But the floors are real cold in the jails of Jersey
Depression starts talking and his voice is raspy
Cause he ain't shut the fuck up in 3 1/2 Weeks
Look, beard is full, hair is nappy
These jeans ain't mine so they way too baggy
Priorities fucked, nigga's startin to gas me
It's like my whole life just flipped right past me
Starting to trap me
His names Dwayne, so why the fuck my son keep calling him daddy?
Same shit that I feared after all of these years
I gotta breathe I can't believe my ears
Wiping out my eyes I'm damn near in tears
But you can't be mad cause you know you ain't been there
Nah, you grab his moms up throw her against the door
But in the back of your mind you know it ain't her fault
Nah, I ain't mad at all I'm just bothered
I get honest for real I ain't been the best father like
Toys"R"Us, Chuck E. Cheese
You know a little nigga grow up with these needs
New Years or Christmas even a birthday
Least bring a nigga to his school on the first day
I can't believe it, this the same way that I was treated
So maybe it's history repeated
I know it sound sick
The idea of having another kid
Cause this one you'll really feel like is his
It's the truth and I hate that fact, wait
I shouldn't of said that
I take that back I apologize
Let's rewind this whole story like nah C4 just erase that track
Check it, I don't care if only the track trust me
Fuck what niggas say only god can judge me
Fuck what niggas heard or think or even thought
Tried to fix my shortcomings I just came up short
