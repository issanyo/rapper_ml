[Intro]
Turn [?] a little bit C4 (Come on)

[Verse]
No, I ain't the type to be toyed with, play with
Or played like, "Nah, not at all my man"
[?] me and all my fam
With them M16's [?]
And if it's against me, abort that plan, it's like
Just when you thought he wasn't lookin', I saw that man
Turn into Jigsaw, I might saw that man
Then somebody might snitch like, "I saw that man"
Turn my jam up loud for the man of the hour
Fans [?] Hampton and [?]
[?] never ran out of cowards
Keep a gun by me, I learnt that from Cam up in [?]
"Fam, you want grams and that powder?"
Some dirty dudes with me like they ain't big fans of the shower
Me? I let the mouths of [?]
And hire your house out like I'm Angela [?]

[Chorus]
Ghetto America, lend me your ear
Got some things that I need you to hear
And it go like: Money, cars, hoes, guns that pop loud
Those the only things us ghetto niggas about
Now Jersey (Come on) Queens niggas (Come on)
Brooklyn ([?]) Harlem (Come on)
Ladies get naked, niggas can get [?]
Know I'ma be ghetto till I die, tell 'em why

[Verse 2]
[?] G's up (G's up), hoes down (Hoes down)
If the bitch can't swim she gon' drown (Yeah)
And if the broads singin' 'round these parts of town
She know it's about to go... nah
Chill, hold the fuck up, wait a minute
I spit like I'm starving, ain't ate for a minute
Jump low, man, like Robert [?] for a minute ([?])
Might take your coat, you could stay for a minute ([?])
A few pretty broads wan' fuck me for my [?]
So my bitch now bodybagged, ugly [?]
Uh-huh, thick hips, low self-esteem
With big lips, she's real good at lining up business
Yeah, fuck niggas, nobody's a friend of [?]
(Nah) I can't call it, been like that since Kindergar'
[?] learnt somethin', giving out seminars
Been a star, plus dude rock like Pat Benatar
You won't niggas spittin' like him
Coughin' up, spittin' that phlegm
Like somebody's President is sippin' that gin
What I gotta do? Line niggas up and just rip 'em like [?]
There's some other fags tryna play me
I thought Musiq Soulchild was the only nigga half crazy
But I guess not, Joey, no guest spots
And now that all that out the way, let's rock
Come on

[Chorus (Extended)]
Ghetto America, lend me your ear
Got some things that I need you to hear
And it go like: Money, cars, hoes, guns that pop loud
Those the only things us ghetto niggas about
Now Jersey (Come on) Queens niggas (Come on)
Brooklyn ([?]) Harlem (Come on)
Ladies get naked, niggas can get [?]
Know I'ma be ghetto till I die, tell 'em why
Ghetto America, lend me your ear
Got some things that I need you to hear
And it go like: Money, cars, hoes, guns that pop loud
Those the only things us ghetto niggas about
Now Jersey (Come on) Queens niggas (Come on)
Brooklyn ([?]) Harlem (Come on)
Ladies get naked, niggas can get [?]
Know I'ma be ghetto till I die, tell 'em why

[Outro (Sampled)]
Say turn it up, "Turn it up"
Say turn it up, "Turn it up"
