[Verse]
Used to strive to be a G but that caper was over wit
When I wanted a M, this was all labeled appropriate
One I fronted for, one was heavy in the rear
Til I made that and realized that one was already there
Check it, They asking bout my well being, well I been fine
I just did some sets of 50 on the incline
I don't do the games, but if I happen to be into one
Burner to his melon, just my version of temple run
They tell me im crazy, they say that Joe's off
But I ain't tryna rap wit new ideas using old thoughts
The whole premise of they argument is so forced
So what that say for you, if you concluded that wit no cause
That's just some lil truth for you no it alls
Nigga I can roof a bowling ball
I make a mirror change his point of view
And won't always show wit his face depends on who its pointed to
Now a bunch of groupie niggas want to join the crew
Models want to join the pool, it's funny what some coins will do
My regular sex'll be a porn to ya'll
Its wierd since I never fucked none of my friends porno stars
Wait..Forgot about that night up in the fountain blue
Decapitate that other bar, head I wasn't counted dude
When its normal for you, you ain't gotta play to win
Im more concern with how Melo's gonna play wit Lin
I took a break for a sec, I'm done chilling
Thought I lost my hunger, kind of had this numb feeling
Haters say I'm wack, paint me as this one villain
But I'll be nice longer than they gon be unwilling nigga!
Now I'm only chasing bills hard
You won't understand it 'til you face the right pill charge
Worry free cause my lawyer get it crunk
Told me i'd get time serve without ever hitting a bunk
I dont bother wit a Glock
Or haven't since I parted from the block
But if duke talking crazy then he'll do it to a cartridge full of shots
Find his body in a river down in austin won't matter if his father is a doc
Nigga!! Feet dangling from a small stretcher
Convo interrupted by a small heckler
Cause the boy feel like rapping again
You heard a Clue tape you know its about to happen again
Joey...
