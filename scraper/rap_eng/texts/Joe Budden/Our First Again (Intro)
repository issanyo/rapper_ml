Our first again
Our first again
Our first again

Our first again
Our first again

Our first again
Our first again
Our first again

Our first again, our first again
Our first again, our first again
Our first again, our first again, our first again

Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can
And the wisdom to know the difference
Give me the strength to be myself
And with that, we'll be on top of the world
