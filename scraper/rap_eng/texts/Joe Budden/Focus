Ballin war to the crackpot crackspot with it (WOO!!!)
Gat cop with it, white tee black socks fitted
Pop the trunk let the bass knock with it (WOO!!!)
Like, no team could beat us
We pump diesel I ain't talkin 'bout jeans or sneakers
Raid, man we gettin it harder
All day dog I live in the carter, take your time with it
Jump off that nigga
Nona seen me with at least two birds like Jack Tripper
Jerse, true that I'm a rep, new jag on the set durag on my neck
Breathe, and then hide your bait
Cause all my heat stay dirty like a project vent
Whoa, on the lowdown bring the hook it's about to go down, ladies!!!!

[Hook]
