[Intro - Joe Budden - talking] (Suzy Q)
(A staaaarrr)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
One two, one two
(Is inside of meeeee)
One two, one two
Uh, uh, uh
Nod ya head, if you want clap ya hands to it
It's just music, you feel like it dance to it
Uh, uh, come on

[DJ On Point - talking over Intro] (*echo*)
Name of this record right here is called Star Inside
Shout to Dub B on the beat
Let's go

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
If you feel like I feel it's all love, what up?
Now throw ya motherfuckin fingers in the air, (oh), yeah
Mr. On Fact, here to do it like on fact, this ain't about rap
If you ain't come to feel good, we gonna do it without you
Too low, turn the music louder, yeah
Turn the music loud in here
You understand that what y'all about to hear
Feelin myself, homie what?
See I'm a leader, won't show me up
Nah, see they won't slow me down, won't slow me up
Sky's the limit, 'til I die and I'm in it
But that's not the case tonight
Pop a case tonight
Like whatever you want do, it's okay tonight
See cause all of that salt we gon' shake tonight
Now bring the break aight

[Hook - Suzy Q] - w/ ad libs
I'm just tryin to be me
Cause there's only one me
Strip away materials and seriously
These things don't make me
Nothin can break me
I shine because a star is inside of me

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden] (Suzy Q)
I write Mood Muzik, know a lot of you ain't used to
Jot my life on wax, I'm puttin you through it
No lies, it's all truth to it
Do the music cause it's (inside of me) [okay]
Fans wanted the real, I went and gave it to 'em
I'm not a street nigga, nah just relate to 'em
I just relay through 'em
Show the way to 'em, never fake to 'em, that ain't (inside of me) [hold up]
Don't be afraid, show the World who you are
Go and show the World you a star [you could]
Reach to the stars, go ahead show the World that it's ours
And then the World'll know that it's (inside of me)
40 acres and a mule to, 40 K's on the Mueller
See I'm just thinkin of ways to get my dudes up
They use to say we was losers
I beg to differ, that ain't me, now

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Break - Suzy Q - talking]
Give it to 'em Joe
Give it to 'em Joe
Give it to 'em Joe
(You got it)

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden] (Suzy Q)
They say if you don't stand for nothin, you'll fall for anything
Cause of that there, I see the whole game on the ground
Watchin what works, we all chasin a hit
Instead of takin a risk, so we changin our sound now
Now we all chase jewels, big trucks and income
All that and then some, chase whatever trend come [but]
At least 'til the trend's done [but]
But that don't change within none [yeah]
And I'm not sayin to not have a Benz son
Rings that shiny, whatever things' timely
Those things help to unwind me [but]
But naw those things don't help define me
Aim at the basics, aim you can make it
Cause even when the whole game seems tainted
I'm a star without the chains and the bracelets
Cause that fly shit is (inside of me)

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Suzy Q - singing]
A glow is comin from my heart
Open yours and find a star
(Hey!) ...
(Hey!)
