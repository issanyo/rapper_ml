[Intro: Young Chris]
Yeah... uh, C. West
We do this, Joe Budden
Yeah, Young Chris, what, what?
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Young Chris]
To the heart of North of 'delph, pour my spirit and flesh
Give me the crown, watch me wear it the best
I ain't hearin' the rest
Long gone, dancin' with bigger fish here
Fish scale advances for glitter wrist wear
Ch-chea, motherfucker this year Chris here
Homie the strong's so vital, survival of the fits here
Ain't shit sweet y'all, life about a bitch yeah
Say I drive her crazy though I ride that ho fifth gear
Talk so much poverty 'cause I live here
Talk facility 'cause my family's doin' a bid there
You ain't rappin' or ballin', we got our hustle out
That's what a thug about, anything to get the fuck up out
The ghetto, dodge the devil, prolong my demise
Got a green sticky lye, baby, 365

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Hold up, a nigga went from lukewarm to hot
Scratch that, from coldest winter to hell's kitchen
Aside from predictable shots and shells spittin'
Wouldn'ta even known it 'cause nothin' felt different
E'rything dope in this game ain't on the radio
That proofs me, check the dames and the ratio
Brain like fellatio, I mean it used to be 'caine like Horatio
Fuck you, pay me though
Hood form, style in whatever I put on
Come from where you give a wrong look and you would look wrong
Broads off the hook for him
But I treat 'em like Subway, I give 'em 5 dollars and a FOOT long
Young niggas take your vitamins
Your 28-inch rims higher than watchin' me admirin'
JUMP OFF, e'rything that they aspirin' to be
But the bullshit gets tiresome to me
See, only one concern, gettin' my bread right
Hate to see you lose your Life over a website
I'll feel Sorry
Y'all'll only know what I show, I Chris Brown and Rihanna that real story
Off putting words together like Scrabble
Build your Monopoly, they just gon' attack you
Can't Pictionary it, they gon' think it's Taboo
When you get more, they can't Connect the Four, dawg..

[Outro: Joe Budden]
Geah, Joey, Chris
Yes Chad, I fuckin' know the sound
