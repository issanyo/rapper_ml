[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Yo, I seen shorty on the staircase, in front of an empty beer case
Weird face, almost like he was scared straight
Like he ain't have a care in life (uh), wipin' tears from his eyes
That already appeared to have been dried
We chopped it, said he was adopted
And there's a lot of shit he just tucks in his closet (uh)
Real calm, said he'd always feel harm
And all he want to do is meet his real dad and real mom
All the nice home and clothes do is remind me (how when)
In all these years, they ain't even tried to find me
Never mind love, I feel like they never liked me
If I thought there was a God, I would ask the nigga "why me?"
But some things you better off havin' never knew
Maybe they wanted better for you than they could ever do
You got a family, I see that you don't care for them
But love gon' always be love, no matter where it's from
What if I said your moms couldn't give birth
Contemplated leavin' Earth, 'til you brought her life worth
Whatever you goin through, could always be much worse
Don't make a mistake, mistakin' your blessings for a curse (so)
So, told dude you in the right place, right here
Can't run to your corner when life don't wanna fight fair (talk to 'em)
Things'll become quite clear
When you decide to wake up and stop havin' fantasies about a nightmare (oh!), yeah

[Chorus: Emanny (Joe Budden)]
They don't see, who you are
They too busy posin' (uh)
But the front won't go far
Just thank God your fantasy ain't real (welcome to real life)
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
(Welcome to real life)

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Yeah, you damn right she on her high horse
She say "don't worry 'bout hers nigga, ride yours"
Before you talk, clean your own backyard
Souped up and sought after by the athletes and rap stars (uh)
Developin' a name, creepin to fame
She quick to trade her vagina for a seat at the game
And it's so foul, she don't see the shame
In the act or the fact that she view it as an equal exchange (oh!)
But she stay with the newest on, Louboutins
Buyin' groceries with coupons, sleepin' on a futon
No self-esteem to cover her lack of confidence
She get on Twitter, retweetin' all the compliments
Pretty face, nice strut with a nice butt
Disguise of a slut, only tryin' to get wifed up
But when it's party time, she won't be a second late
Once she leaves V.I.P., it's back home to Section 8
What confused me
Is niggas tried to kick it but she come across bougie, in her best friend's jewelry
Part-time mother (but), but somethin' real shady when her
Two year old daughter much closer to the babysitter (uh)
Cry when she alone, product of a broke down home (yeah)
Won't change 'cause she already grown (talk to 'em)
Already set in her ways, no need in tryin' to help (talk to 'em)
So she'd rather find wealth before she can find herself (oh!), yeah

[Chorus: Emanny]
They don't see, who you are
They too busy posin' (yeah)
But the front won't go far (uh)
Just thank God your fantasy ain't real (welcome to real life)
Fantasy to real life
You got everything (tah) but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life (uh)
You got everything but ain't got nothin' (talk to 'em)

[Break: Emanny (Joe Budden)]
You can be what you want
But it's too much for ya to let go
Ain't got to be somethin' else (uh)
Better off just bein' yourself
Ain't gonna get you far (never)
When you gonna wake up and deal with the real life?
The real life
(Tah, welcome to real life)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Real quick, let me introduce y'all to Maverick
Lifetime addict, who recently kicked the habit (uh)
Lookin' for a job, companies won't let him have it
'Cause there's drug and gun charges up and down his whole jacket (uh)
Constantly rejected, can't deal with the aggravation (so)
So now he scared to be honest on the application
Past caught up, 'cause every door shuts like "sorry we can't help ya"
Then it's back home to the shelter (oh!)
Nothin' to lose, givin' up like many other minions
Pendin' his trial in the court of public opinion
'Til he got a call from a temp agency
Said they had a void, asked could he fill the vacancy? (okay)
Unlike what he appears, been employee of the month for a year (I guess)
Self doubt is related to fear
And they'll never replace him
If ya gon' catch up with your dreams, gotta be willin' to chase them (oh!), yeah

[Chorus: Emanny]
They don't see, who you are
They just see your posin'
But the front won't go far
You can turn your fantasy to real
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin', nothin', nothin'
