[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I mean I try not to conform on some sheep shit
Funny how your strong point could also be your weakest
They say that the first wound is the deepest
I say that's the easiest one to be at peace with
I think my misery would have y'all in disbelief
Swear that alone could get a jury to disagree
Should have followed a simple suggestion
In the belly of the beast giving it indigestion
Remember they said being yourself can't work
I always thought being yourself can't hurt
And if it did, wouldn't expect y'all to act cordially
It's a much bigger issue, better work out your priorities
So I always state my thoughts
Knowing they could only judge me if the gate's not in court
Some fought, some feel like a nobody still
Bottom line you don't accept you nobody will

[Hook: Shahroz]
Look up out the window, watch weather change
Just like people do, and it's all the same
But I won't change, no way
I said I won't change, no way-ay [2x]

[Verse 2: Shahroz]
Joey said sheep, we both shepherds on this record
Words are like wool, and I'm stitching em' together
Like my heart, when they ripped it
And the pills they prescribed, evidently won't fix it
Tellin' me I'm fit to act the role in a script
But I ain't going through the motions they pick
Emotions… ain't designed to be intertwined
With fakeness, like the monster of frankenstein
Back as a kid, I would never say shit
Trapped up in my mind, always feelin' so anxious
Guns out, facin' demons like I'm playing doom
With no escape route, RUNNIN' FROM THIS PADDED ROOM
Change personified, runnin' with me side by side
Tryna bag me, but I ain't talkin nickel-dimes
Hiding inside, takes a toll on your mental health
To better me, finally had to accept myself

[Hook: Shahroz]

[Verse 3: Shahroz ]
Listen, I'm switching up my perception
I'm throwin' stones, rippling my reflection
In essence, every second gets harder
As I grow older, all I hear is ben parker
In my ear, tellin' me to be responsible
A role model, is seemingly impossible
Neglecting... the youth ain't unstoppable
It's only hard, if you make it an obstacle
Conjuring my consequence is nonsense to the masses
But I'm on a star mission shootin' like NASA's
And I ain't losin myself like them boosters
Won't have my team turn on me like John Keuster
Lucky if you got a handful of friends
Next to fam, that's all you got to the end
So I ain't puttin on a show or persona
If you ain't gon' be yaself… i'll disown ya

[Hook: Shahroz]
