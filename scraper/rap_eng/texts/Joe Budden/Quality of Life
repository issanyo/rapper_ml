Parks on the board
Klasikx on the beat
Hood on my shoulder

Im on some quality of life shit right now b
Just want my gas tank on F
I want Trey Songz away from all my hoes
Im fucking with you, we dont love these hoes

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Some niggas drink away the pain
I think of ways to gain
And it happens so naturally you'd think its preordained
Straight from Lyor's Reign
Escaped from the ball and chain
Can't tell if I was in it for the long haul or fame
Im laying low on the island
Been learned the saying no is a talent
Niggas want beef but keeping up is a challenge
Can't tell if Im trying to get even or find a balance
But im much closer I won't front
Hoes love it so so but yet he so blunt
A charming asshole, warn them all the same
Tell them I feel the ice as its forming in my veins
Chasing the high so much that we both hurting
To the point it ain't even about the other person
So we even, Im in love with her rear and her pussy
And she in love with idea of what I could be
On top of the world but desire to fall
Cuz Whats the point of dreaming big if you've acquired it all?
But if lyricism is back, I helped it spearhead
If we ordering CL's make mine a year ahead
I skipped the club line and dont get turned around
So girls come at a high volume, I dont turn em down
No pregnant hoes and no minors
A-1 bars with Em as a co-signer
I filled the counter up without checking the cost yet
I ain't rich my nigga but check the way I off set
Dont get confused by the Bentleys and the Corvettes
Got stories from my hood that will rival those of war vets
Jersey City helped to mold what I amounted to
My only beef is they dont hold theyself accountable
So a few resent me, But I'm cool with it
They handed me the city before I knew what to do with it
This last chick that I put under the wing
Just taught me the younger the age, the younger she think
I mean, she shaped like a stallion with bomb sex
But dont understand me when Im trying not to be complex
Done raising my voice, I ain't with it
Fuck is the point of arguing if she ain't gonna get it?
Plus my future is now, hers is down the pipeline
And thats the difference between a good time and a life time
But my current situation
Is I keep meeting chicks who need a way out of their current situation
Some cool, some silly, some serious
They trying to come up, Im trying to come period
Na I dont do the pickup line
I give her the number to the chauffeur with a pickup time
One weekend its Vegas, the next its Turks
Hard to love a dude over him when he come with that many perks
I need a sign she attracted to more than designer fabrics
If by chance I am passed my prime, im trying to lap it
Too many checks to deposit
Smoke too many bones, no skeletons in my closet
But talking rap off the work that I got
If I ain't crack your top 10 you should reserve me a spot
Till then I play the strip club, and Jerz rockin
So when life lands before my eyes its all worth watching
Im about honor and respect
And boredom just made me rent a condo on the edge
Cause God gave me everything I was hoping for, doe galore
Trying to quit smoking more
Just me her, going raw
So how could we end up trusting each other?
When our bond started out with us judging each other?
Both fronting like "yea, we just fucking each other"
But nobody getting fooled while we bluffing each other
Got one broad, theres too much history with
Another thats never happy, too much misery with
Another that will guzzle shots until she literally sick
And another that only text me to say "give me some dick"
I swear, how could you ever say Joe went soft?
When if I told you my problems, you'd think im showing off
I keep it quiet, its all covered on my end
My quality of life is pretty high end
