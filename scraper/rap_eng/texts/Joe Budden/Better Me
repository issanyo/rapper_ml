[Verse 1]
I get a ghetto gospel, only right considering the ghetto was my Hostel
Memory is gone but I’m recalling all through High School
Even at my lowest I was sitting on my high stool, that’s what being high do
If I couldn’t do shit, was always able to tote
They told that a nigga would die before I was able to vote
Probably cause me and my constituents and all the shit we did
The M.R.I couldn’t tell you what the issue is
With my treason came a cause that I believed in
Is it really wrong if a nigga got a reason?
At times I had to take dough, nigga did whatever for a peso
Being from the hood ‘ll be my scapegoat
Or can it be, cause I wasn’t born into a canopy
Maybe I was prone to falling in love with vanity
Tell me shit you reap is the shit you sow
Tell God I’m better then the shit I show, I gotta grow

[Hook:2X (Incubus sample "dig" Sped up)]
Another, Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me

[Verse 2]
Now niggas say I floss too much
So, has he changed cause I don’t think that thousand dollar T costs too much
All they should say is that he’s strong, came out the fire unscathed
Yea I carried on, Lou Vuitton carry on
Had the ‘matti’ on, but my blessings at a delay
Now to lace my chick at Esay is sort of cliche
Plane ain’t gon never land, unless it’s in Netherlands
20 on that gold face breightling with the leather band
Asked for a better hand
I tried colliding with my problems, yea, I never ran
That would make me less a man
I ain’t go from not having it to being arrogant
I dreamt, went grabbin it, just being passionate
Some niggas get complacent, why?
Dudes is new born birds just afraid to fly
If your foot's on the brakes, can’t ride
Me, I spread my wings inhale and embrace that high

[Hook]
Another, Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me

[Bridge]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now!
Give it away, give it away, give it away now!
Give it away, give it away, give it away now!
Give it away, give it away, give it away now!

[Verse 3]
Part of me was gruesome, I ain’t change, I grew some
And if I did change I’d welcome that shit to come
Dudes that smoked trees with me, dudes that used to be with me
They say I switched up on ‘em and did a 360
Cause I don’t burn it down, but to me it’s common sense
Wanna see the other side? Gotta turn around
Show ‘em ya game face
I tell ‘em we was on the same track but wasn’t running that same race
We ain’t in the same space, but I ain’t gonna change pace
Something won’t let me slow down, I can’t explain fate
So don’t say I went from broke to bourgeois
I’m far from high end, I just know what suits me
Ma’fucka!

[Hook]
