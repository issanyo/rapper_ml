[Intro]
Joey
Mic check, mic check
It go

[Verse 1]
Okay the wait's up, waited up, really don't know where to start
Niggas fresh home want me dead and gone, I'm darin' y'all
It's in arms reach when I'm sleep, I'm prepared for y'all
Niggas bleed, BIG agrees, ain't nobody scared of y'all
Besides, let me summarize, they ain't got to wherewithal
I'm every where, they never there, when I'm gon' hear from y'all?
Y'all know me as Joe, don't wanna see me as Mouse
Let me address all these rumors so they don't leave out the house
I mean it started with Clue, that's when the bullshit begun
I was the best in my city, niggas knew I was the one
Ain't have a dime to my name, still niggas thought that I won
And niggas that never did it want to tell me how it was done
I'm hearin' some wanna clap, they don't fuck with me, nigga
They say I never go back, well that's a luxury, nigga
It's somethin' I can afford, so what they say get ignored
They pray I'm on the wrong end of that Ford

[Hook]
They want me man down
They want me man down

[Verse 2]
Okay let's start it from scratch, put it all on line
My character's been defamed, I put it all online
Told 'em that's where we were headed, said I was wrong all the time
And now we finally here, I waited a long ass time
Been called every name in the book, been a liar, a deceiver
A cheater, a woman beater, am I all, am I neither?
Been absorbin' the ether, robbin' Paul to pay Peter
High price to pay to strangers I been offering me to
I've been more than a leader, even with my back to the wall
Thought I was finished forever when I was practicin' falls
Now you second guessin' yourself, you gotta ask what you saw
They fishin', wishin' it's fiction, but ain't no actin' at all
Can't even fathom the gall, they mad I'm appalled
Too much passion to call, nothin' but bars, ain't no fashion involved
How is path ain't adored
How the fuck they laughin', I can blast through the door
Ain't fathom havin' so much cash in the drawer
First they love me and then they hate me, then they love me again
First it's lovely and then it's ugly, then it's fuck me again
Bitches don't text back and then they suck me again
But still it's none of my business what they think of me again
When we talk about skill, they just love again
I call 'em out for the kill, they just doubt me again
But I was born for the storm, I mean abnormal's the norm
Maybe they wanna know how long will they mourn

[Hook]
They want me man down
They want me man down

[Verse 3]
I'm wishin' this was a dream, maybe it's smoke in this mirror
Wish I could change it all just by blowin' smoke in the mirror
Been such a long ride, wishin' I was on the side
To get caffeine pills to stay awake with Sean Price
If I was by Eric Garner, I'd have yelled at the pigs
Gave him all my cash, he wouldn't have to sell that cig
Shout to Bobbi Kristina, let her know that I love her
Wish she was alive or didn't die the same as her mother
Maybe my thinkin' is off, when I blink I get thoughts
Of bullets shakin' the door, and tape around Chinx' Porsche
See it damaged my heart, I'd be right in Yams' car
To get the purp out his cup, and get his hands off the bar
Tell Stack that I miss him, see we losin' a lot
I wanna hear from Shakir, I still miss Stuart Scott
Chris Lighty, Robin Williams still to this day
I pray nobody ever feel that way, too many men die

[Hook]
They want me man down
