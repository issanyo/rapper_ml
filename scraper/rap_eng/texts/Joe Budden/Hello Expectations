[Verse 1]

Check
It’s time to educate a lurcher if you're featherweight by nurture
Looking for a fix, I’m here to medicate and nurse ya
Was putting this shit off, and know I hesitated further
Even me thinking bout it is premeditated murder
So, if when I levitate, it disturbs ya
You ain’t gotta ask who I dedicate this verse to
You brothers - I tried to see shit in all shades
So I’m prepped when they finally show they true colors
Ain’t gotta worry about who I’m trying to appeal to
If all I do is keep it in 5th, what up Philip Hughes
Public Enemy, I’m just missing Terminator X
Now who am I gonna terminate next?
Hearing all sorts of fables probly...
Who if you choose to believe will have you thinking I’m unstable
Contrary to belief, I weighed all I brought to the table
And decided that relationship wasn’t worth being faithful
Words from the wise: When you lie make sure the trail is gone
And don’t expect a happy ending less you in a nail salon
(Nigga)
A matter of time before the jerks'll start
It makes sense I’m being framed, I’m a work of art
But if you broke dog
Don’t blame the economy
Don’t come with a handout
Don’t try to E-Honda me
See, I never ask niggas to come and be fond of me
You met your match now, what up eHarmony

(Hook)
Hello expectations, know I had to greet you
It don’t matter where you at, I’ll always come and meet you
Hello expectations, we can skip the small talk
Probly thought I disappeared and thought that I was all talk
What you been smoking?
You keep getting higher
But that ain’t never been a problem, I keep getting nicer
Hello expectations, who do it like me?
I think you got a good idea of who it might be

[Verse 2]

Been in this game 8 years, ain’t fell off, no bragging
It’s just been a lot of John Doe and toe taggin
The jeans Taverniti, footwear is old fashioned
Barkleys, Jordans, maybe do some Bo Jackson’s
All I’m hearing is coke rapping with no passion
From dudes getting fucked like something Chris Stokes imagined
Black Benz, fuck an R-class, no wagon
Way I’m on that turn pike you will think the pope passing
If you got an assessment of what I represent (Dog)
It’s more then likely negligent if we was never friends
Popping shit online, haven’t even met me
You’s a pussy and a bush, Kardashian and Reggie
Hello expectations, I should look familiar
Every time we meet you tell me ain’t nobody realer
Whatever you expect from me, I always go beyond that
And you be looking shocked as if you thought we lost contact
So if you knew me, you would get why my manners are drastic
Strong minded, a lot of people can’t handle that tactic
To keep it real, politics always hamper the masses
And I rebel cause all I wanna do is hand them a classic
Boo body gotta be right just to lamp on the mattress
Till my accountant pull the trigger I’ll hamper they asses
I'm into fine linen, ma lay a hand on my fabric
Bad bitches, fast cars, no Danica Patrick
Audience is die hard so if my fans spazzin'
You might see the first drive-by from a bandwagon
I’m not a role model, I never claim to be - The
World would be fucked up - If
Yall was the same as me - I'm
Not to be copied off of
Not to be emulated
This music ain’t the club more
So to be stimulated
A nigga far from perfect when you hear my pencil state it
That I would try to be yours
That I would demonstrate it
The naysayer’s talking
It seems I been degraded
And tho I hear their words
None of 'em penetrated
So when its cold out - I
Maker sure I’m insulated
A little food for thought
Hope your mental can take it

(Hook)
Hello expectations, know I had to greet you
It don’t matter where you at, I’ll always come and meet you
Hello expectations, we can skip the small talk
Probly thought I disappeared and thought that I was all talk
What you been smoking?
You keep getting higher
But that ain’t never been a problem, I keep getting nicer
Hello expectations, who do it like me?
I think you got a good idea of who it might be
