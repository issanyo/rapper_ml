[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Let look behind the Swarovski crystals
Behind the 50 calibers and the pistols
Misuse pardon self gotta excuse my issues
For me just to have them a ritual
But I ain't as crazy as I seem to be
It's just that nothing is the way that is seems to me
I'm feeling less than drugging him up with anti-depressants
In essence I'm threatening my character assessment
Truth told, I figure a few hoes mixed with some new clothes
Should cover my loop holes
If I'm misunderstood or misguided
Started when they passed the L, said, "Just try it"
When I don't want to get out of bed I just fight it
Sometimes I don't eat for days I just diet
Only live once so if I just like it
I ain't even checking the price I just buy shit
I'm thinking that will just hide it
But all it takes is life to ignite shit
Thinking bout death wondering how I'm gone go
I can't be insane for just wanting to know
In my head I die often, I use to think of suicide often
Good suit on and a nice coffin
But that ain't something I would try myself
Still they locked me in this room all by myself
I need a, I think I need a...

[Phone Conversation]
Mike: I can't even believe this shit you saying right now
Yo that don't even sound like mouse
B: just like we was at the club the other night
This nigga ran out the club start shooting my man up
Mike: word!!!
B: For no reason then this nigga talking about he's the only one who can save him
The apocalypse is coming and he's the savior of all mankind
Mike: that's crazy
B: that nigga ain't his self no more

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
They say my symptoms are aggressive
They title me a compulsive obsessive slash manic depressive
They tryna tell me that I'm a con and I game niggas
That's one reason I don't even entertain niggas
Not important who they are I won't name niggas
They like to say I have a tendency to blame niggas
I keep fucking shit up but keep trying
If ya'll would just trust me I wouldn't just keep lying
If I had bread I wouldn't be in debt
Let me clarify get in-depth
I feel like every time I been less, whenever I invest
Whenever I am set, I feel like I'm inept
I try to make 'em understand but they just won't [?]
I'm telling 4 million other I am the template
There ain't a book that tells a story there is no index
We got some different type of cuts and no there not princess
All this indigest seemingly endless
How I take in stress when I always went best
Aching in my chest yet and still it won't break me
They say the room's padded for my own safety
But the cushion don't soften shit
They locked the door but still they let my thoughts in it
And no one can tell me why I'm here
I can't even see the sky from here, I guess my time is near

[Phone Conversation]
Mike: ayo we really need to go see that nigga yo
B: hum... I don't know we could do that but last time I saw him
He wasn't looking good they had him in the room
I.V.'s all in his arm looking like he was in a daze like his body was there
Mike: you spoke to him
B: Mentally he was gone they wouldn't let me near him
They had a guard by him on 24 hour watch
Had all these prescriptions he was taking
Mike: damn yo that's ain't even him
B: I don't know what's going on with that nigga
I just gotta keep him in my prays hope everythings good
