[Hook 1: Joe Budden]
New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly
New York, Jersey, Philly, you know I keep it filthy (out in)
New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly
New York, Jersey, Philly

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Rockin spikes and the beater, beside me a diva
I'm hearing all that talk bout how you ride with a heater
Make sure I dont survive, or when I see ya
You'll sleep with a broke heart
Like you went and took advice from Alicia
Tell me if you really wanna take it there
The best in the world if ya ain't familiar
The wear, the latest gear, love nope, hate it yeah
Your scared style will get aired out, start, stop, and stare now
Change the truck grill, yeah, the car got veneers now
Lotta rappers spitting shit I dont wanna hear now
They talking Gucci but they shoppin at Sears now
If you ain't prepared now, you ain't get the warning yet
So I'ma go hard early, call it morning sex
New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly
New York, Jersey, Philly, tinted up, rims steely
If a nigga try to kill me, chalk it up as a brother wildin
Ya minds playin tricks on you, get off Shutter Island
Show you somethin' you never'll see, I'm gettin' checks every week
You tryin' to meet ya executive needs, I'm in executive suites consecutively
Somebody had to body it, guess the job was left to me
So when I kill the track they can't charge me with double jeopardy
They ask if you if I'm a boss and you say no sir
How you don't concur? My go-pher got a chauffeur
Standing on the couch in the club with a nympho
Reppin' Slaughterhouse, see the blood on the window
Actually, I'm tryna get wealthy, being broke isn't healthy
So I ain't trying to buy whatever shit they trying to sell me
Broad up in the 'telly, I can trust her when she tell me
Still bringing lunatics with me, yeah I learned that trick from Nelly
Cuz I know that it get urgent when they see you just splurgin
Strip club, in the private room, tryna fix the curtains
Wanna cause a big excursion? Run up on the kid squirting
Make sure the Mac ain't broke and you ain't buy the Knicks version
Out in...

[Hook 2: Joell Ortiz (Joe Budden)]
(New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly)
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, my stash is never empty baby
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, the Ds will never get me

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
In my hoopty I be swerving, the public's who I'm serving
Boost phone forever chirping, I be out there putting work in
Know them dirty boys lurking, if they nab me then it's curtains
So when I go see a person, I spin the block so I'm certain
That it's cool, I'm no fool, see, Ra√∫l is more than reckless
So I meet him when it's busy at that Meeker/Morgan exit
Off that BQ-B-B-B-B-B-B-BQE near Mickey D's
And occasionally treat myself to a nice little fish-and-cheese
I'm really, really in the street, being broke's my enemy
Teachers said I'm dumb but I dropped out and I know chemistry
I make that soft get hard and meet my homey Pito
In the parking lot of Home Depot off Northern Boulevard
I got my route down pat, I'm about my stacks
And my mouth don't chat, I let my bow!-bow! clap
But I ain't with that though, I'm trying to get that dough (YAOWA)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, oh no, I stay low in that

[Hook 3: Royce da 5'9" (Joell Ortiz)]
(Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy)
Pistol clip and pistol, that's all I rap about's
My dick, my pistol clip and pistol, pistol clip and pistol
Pistol clip and pistol, that's all I rap about, bitch

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9"]
My dick is like a missile, my pistol's in my pants
But my dick is hanging lower than my pistol clip and pistol, bitch
Now we talking bout my dick, you know your shit big
When your bitch give you head and her mouth is only 'round the top of it
Now lets talk about my pistol clip
If the gun is playing music, then the pistol clip's an instrument
The soldier is holding on to the 4-4s, composing
The drum is brrrrrr, 762s exploding
I'm about to stop talking bout my dick, pistol and my pistol clip
Dick, pistol, pistol clip, bitch, I'm a hypocrite
If I say "Fuck the world," that mean that I'm literally
Tryin' to put my big big dick in it, my pistol clip be pistol whistling
[*Whistle Break*] I hope you listening
Pistol clip, pistol, big dick, now your bitch is interested
I'm bout to enter it and injure it
I am not indirect, I am so motherfucking blunt
Pistol clip, pistol, dick, bitch!
I'm saying, you like, "Oh my god, get that gun out of my face"
It's not in your face, it's in my hand

[Hook 4: Crooked I (Royce da 5'9")]
(Pistol clip and pistol) Tequila, vodka, Henny
Tequila, vodka, Henny, that liquor fucking with me
It's tequila, vodka, Henny, tequila, vodka, Henny
Tequila, vodka, Henny, that liquor fucking with me

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
Yeah I'm nickels, dimes, and pennies, I'm dollars, fives, and twenties
Then I'm twenties, fifties, Benjies, buy Beamers, Benz, or Bentleys
Buy bullets, guns, and semis, buy Louis, Gucci, Fendi
Fuck Wendy's, Mickey's, Denny's, I'm Martin's, Chow's, and Benhi's
With Keisha, Tosha, Kimmy, Felicia, Shonda, Cindy
Jamika, Dawn, and Ginny, Tamika, Rhonda, Nicki
They from New York, Jersey, Philly on tequila, vodka, Henny
Patron, Ciroc, and Remy, some weed, shrooms, and pillies
Now we loco, loony, silly, fuck their mouth, box, and tities
(She is licking the shaft of the penis)
That's brain, breast, and kitty while I'm drunk, fried, and tipsy
While I'm twisted, high, and dizzy, pussy juicy, hot, and pretty
Gushy, gooey, sticky, gushy, gooey, sticky
Bitch I'm Eazy, Pac and Biggie off tequila, vodka, Henny
Spit like Wayne, Ye, and Drizzy, mixed with Em, Jay, and 50
And my Nissan, Honda, Chevy, my pistol clip and pistol grip
Rappers got a bigger buzz, bitch I got a bigger dick
That was my Royce line, I'm on my Cali, Brooklyn, Jersey
And Detroit time (Slaughterhouse) Them boys grind
We going past the top, so Mt. Everest won't cut it
You low budget, we bout to go public

[Hook 5: Crooked I]
Tequila, vodka, Henny, tequila, vodka, Henny
Tequila, vodka, Henny, that liquor fucking with me
Tequila, vodka, Henny, tequila, vodka, Henny
Tequila, vodka, Henny, that liquor fuckin with me
