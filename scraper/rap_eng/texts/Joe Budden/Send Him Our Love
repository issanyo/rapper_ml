[Intro: Stack Bundles]
Listen, if you listen to this it's evidence you tryin to figure out if I'm due
Or maybe somebody told you I'm that dude
Or maybe you one of the few that disagree with me
And got your own views about who's really that dude
Well, the South movement got ten months left
And come Valentine's Day the game will merge to the West
And I feel it's absurd that the East is the sellin the less
Screamin 'New York. New York', the pioneers supposed to be the best
You blame it on the vets for our current state of the game
They won't retire, so the generation just remain the same
A bunch of opportunists that was given opportunity
To make a difference in music but gave no opportunity
Nothing new or fresh, it's just the same ass sound
Same old producers, with the same ass sound
Up and coming artists got identity crisis
Cause whenever you you, the labels turn you away
But when you me you think of a way
To cast the criticism aside, get on a track, say what the fuck you wanna say
The radio's goin to play, whatever the listeners say they should
And not what the listeners say they should, indeeed they should
Indeed I should, SMACK a few niggas like Suge!
But then there they'll blackball me
And that's a long story, no crossover so I wrote the Crossover
But if the album sell out, I'd be considered a sellout
The fans keep asking, 'When's the album going to come out?'
Ask your local execs, I'm out

[DJ On Point - talking] (*echo*)
We call this one "Send Him Our Love"
Rest in peace to Stack Bundles

[Chorus 1: Steve Perry (Sampled)]
I still recall
A sad café
How it hurt so bad to see her cry
I didn't want to say goodbye

[Joe Budden - talking behind the Hook]
Uh
I know you up there doin it big

(DJ ON POINT)

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Look, what up Ray? Was speechless, I ain't know what to say
Got the call like at 8 AM, with Nate saying
You had passed away, I'm like why niggas stay playing?
Your MySpace page playing, it started my day aching
It hit me like a tumor, felt like it was too soon to
Thought it was a rumor, until it wasn't a rumor
Can't believe that it's over
But if God called you, I ain't even mad at him, he must've needed a soldier
I was like your mentor, you was like my friend, nah
When I seen you, I would treat you like my kin and more
We used to scream 'fuck these niggas!' like Tim Dog
You was the only rap nigga I would fend for
Was fiending for beats, stuck between your dream and the streets
You just wanted to be seen as elite
Cause you loved Far Rock like I love Jersey, so I feel ya
But love something too much, guarantee it'll kill ya
For real a

[Chorus 2: Steve Perry (Sampled)]
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my—
Send her my love

[Collision/Ad-Libs: Joe Budden]
You nah mean? I remember we
Was in the studio doing, doing "You Know What'll Happen"
It was me, you and Cau (you know what'll happen)
You told me to keep my verses sixteen
I said, "You know I can't do that!"
I went ahead and gave 'em mad bars, you was mad as fuck
You went and tried to stretch your shit out, I wasn't having it though, nigga

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Look, Riot Squad keep your head up
Remember we would diss each other on tracks, laugh about it when we met up
I'm looking in your casket, praying a nigga get up
For a minute, I couldn't help but think that you was set up
No matter who you are, you got to answer when the Lord calling
I told you go and fuck with Jimmy, that's before "Ballin"
Go get your cash right, hard to slow down livin the fast life
I just heard you on Flex show last night
Like was it old beef or was you gettin stuck up?
A line outside your funeral, Ran was really fucked up
And I was too but the difference is
I was more in awe at the ignorant value of life that living gets
Pulled the burner on you, but you fought that dude
I read the paper, it said the pigs caught that dude
It's sad another black man, taken by a black hand
Was your last night in the club, we could have saved your last dance
God damn!

[Chorus 2: Steve Perry (Sampled)]
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my—
Send her my love

[Collision/Ad-Libs: Joe Budden]
I remember like
I remember we was in Cancun
That was my first time out there in Cancun
Me and you was rollin together
You talkin about 'where the bitches, where the bitches, where the bitches at?'
Like nigga I don't know, you supposed to be "The Gorgeous Gangsta"
Don't ask me nothin, I don't speak no Spanish
I love you nigga

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I know the kids really need you
I keep telling 'em, Pac wanted to sign you and Big wanted to see you
Pun wanted to cypher
L wanted you to bring some of that good kush up and get a little higher
Go and help Jam Master Jay get the crowd hyper
Or maybe Freaky Tah switched up and needed a writer
Maybe Aaliyah single up there and need a rider
Know you and Rick James would set the studio on fire
You in a better place up there at the pearly gates
You could be "The Gorgeous Gangster" and niggas won't hate
Some niggas tapped the bottle, pour out a little Hennessy
I'm in the clouds, screamin "Squad Up" in your memory

[Chorus 2: Steve Perry (Sampled)]
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my—
Send her my love

[Collision/Ad-Libs: Joe Budden]
I remember when you called me that day, I think you was in Far Rock
And you had some bitch in your car and your car broke down
And you called me talkin about
'Do I got AAA and shit?'
I'm like 'nah, but at least that answer your question'
And you like 'what question?'
I'm like 'well, I just heard a song of yours
Talking about you wanted to know why she won't stay with you
And she want go ride with a G'
Haha, I love you nigga
Uh, and rest in peace
