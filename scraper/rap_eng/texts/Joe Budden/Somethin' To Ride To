Chea...

[Verse 1]
I always said when I make it, there's no going back
To where the toasters clap, and we can toast to that
Them niggas hate seeing me, I'm like an open scab
I'm OT in a Cabana with an open tab
I'm in the cut though, not too many notice me
I'm strictly baritone, I play it low key
While in New York, they'll say I'm crazy like Rodman was
In Jersey, I'm what Petrović, Dražen was
Politically incorrect, Fuck being proper
Because all the faces looking real like the Fila Prada's
And it seems like they the main niggas seeing dollars
Let me get that off my chest, So I don't need a spotter
Maybe now I see why Marvin just needed to Holler
And if you know me, treat a hurdle like I'm Iguodala
Raisin' the bar, fucking with the stakes
He'll get you that type of fame that your publicist will hate
So we can get the goons involved and have the triggers squirting
But since I'm well endowed, I'll be the bigger person
Throwing darts at a Mozart, you won't go far
Trying to help kill a legend, ask Solar

[Hook]
Nah, this ain't something to ride to
It's more like shit you get inspired to
See I can do anything I desire to
As long as the earth's round and the sky's blue
Nigga this ain't somethin' to ride to
This is shit that you pop pills get high to
This a warrior's anthem for survival
This is Mood Muzik, that's what I do

[Verse 2]
Check it... Nah, this ain't somethin' to ride to
It's more like shit for you to survive to
Roll a blunt do whatever you decide to
To celebrate my return, I'm sorry that I deprived you
Left you with tales of quick riches, thick bitches
Small timers talking that big business is fictitious
No rhymers, slow grinders, that mo' blind us
With skills so vagina, relying on co-signers
Now they mad at me, I keep going hard repping
Cause what's a Rampage to Rashad Evans
That mouth still haul off, we'll shoot at the tires
And you ride until the wheels fall off, Check it
I spent my youth in prison
I thought to get the 401K's a nigga had to do some pitching
But now I'm growing up, they say I'm too different
They tell me I've changed, I say that you didn't

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Honestly this past year's been a burden on me
Unfinished product, God is still working on me
But shout to old girl, she's never to blame
The way she swallowed had me thinking that I never came
With me at the funeral, with me at the wake
Black dress, black shades, strictly for my sake
Our little man's two, to him it's all a surprise
I can't explain death when he don't understand life/
See grandma passed, about a week before mother's day
Forgive me, I was worried about my mother Faye
Bad as it sounds, wouldn't have it any other way
She was so ill, death could have only been her escape
(Talk to 'em) and gotta mask how that make me feel (Why?)
Since the streets is only asking about a Shady deal
If I knew now what tomorrow was gonna teach me
And I told you in advance, you probably wouldn't believe me

[Hook]
