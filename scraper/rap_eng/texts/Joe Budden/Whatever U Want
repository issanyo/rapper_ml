[Intro: Joe Budden]
Once again it's on
And we gonna ride out once again 'till dawn
Cut the lights out once again 'till morn
Keep the lights out 'till the end of the song

[Verse 1: Christina Milian]
Your feelin' me
And it's got you all fired up
Tryin' to walk away
Cause you don't want your heart tied up

[Bridge: Christina Milian]
(But I can feel the proof when your holdin' me
Like to let you think your controlin' me)
Even though that ain't the deal
When I want I take the wheel, and I know
(Can't hide that you're really into me)
(Hold is so tight I can barely breathe)
'Cause you know I keep it real
Giving you what you can feel

[Chorus: Christina Milian [Joe Budden]]
(Whatever you want I got it) Hey
(Whatever you need that's me
Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need I'll be)
(Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that's me) That's me
Feelin' the flow, don't stop it) Yeaheah
(Whatever you need I'll be)
[Verse Two!]

[Verse 2: Christina Milian]
Your frontin' like
You don't want no-one to know
But it's in your eyes
That you don't want me to go

[Bridge: Christina Milian]
(But I can feel the proof when your holdin' me
Like to let you think your controlin' me)
Even though that ain't the deal
When I want I take the wheel, 'cause I know
(Can't hide that you're really into me
Hold is so tight I can barely breathe)
'Cause you know I keep it real
Giving you what you can feel, oh, oho

[Chorus: Christina Milian [Joe Budden]]
(Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that's me) That's me
(Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need I'll be)
(Whatever you want I got it) I got it
(Whatever you need that's me) That's me
(Feelin' the flow, don't stop it
Whatever you need I'll be)
[Joey!]
[We gonna get it started, ok]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Now who get the party jumpin' like me
Who crunk it like me
Lotta of guys here but none is like me
Though some could try to be
With two or three chains up under the white tee
And I got two or three dames that's comin' tonight
See em, done tonight leave
Like one, aight peace
Only Mike puts up numbers like these
And he's no longer playin' but neither am I
So what I'm sayin' is hop in the deuce seater with I
'Cause you know with them boots and that beater you fly
Other dudes act to cheap with the pie
Won't drop a few pennies
Or cop you a guinea
But I'll cop you as many
Toast 'till the bottles all empty
Like pardon the Bravado in me
Us two, that's a plan somehow
Get to know each other later
Let's dance for now, c'mon

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
Whatever you want (Whatever you want) I got it
(Whatever you need that's me) Oooh
(Feelin' the flow, don't stop it) Oh
(Whatever you need I'll be) Take me, that's me
(Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that's me) Ohoho
(Feelin' the flow) Don't stop it
(Whatever you need I'll be)
Whatever you want (Whatever you want I got it)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need that's me)
Feelin' the flow (Don't stop it
Whatever you need I'll be) Whatever you want
(Whatever you want I got it) I got it, I got it
(Whatever you need that's me) Whatever you need
(Feelin' the flow, don't stop it) Baby
(Whatever you need) I'll be

Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that's me
Yeah

Whatever you want I got it
Whatever you need that, that's me
Yeah

Dododo...
