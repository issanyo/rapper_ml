[Chorus]
Ayo, I sold rocks, cause I love the rush of adrenaline
Pick locks, cause I couldn't go without Benjamins
Lick shots, to keep my enemies from entering
Fuck with cops, but without the badge and gun, they feminine
Stay a step ahead of these niggas, leave 'em waiting
You think that you got a plot that I never heard? you mistaken
It's getting got, if I see that's it's there for the taken
I'm cursed, risking it all willing to slap box with Satan

[Verse 1]
Ghetto harmony, judges change hands like local pharmacies
Blazing [?] with my armory, no lie, real nigga loca
Snatch the face-off like John Travolta
Ain't nothing worse than a con with a holster
Shoot-outs is mandatory, I got made niggas to act satanic for me
Family to panic for me, enemies that plan to off me
And friends get cut because they ran before me
Therapists'd take their time out, he's tryin' understand my story
Niggas' be rolling deep, guzzle casket cream
Before we car jack or lamp in a stolen Jeep
Coalition do the same, before I came apart and knew the game
Now I laugh at the Jake's on the scanner, they don't know who to blame
They think the monic' ebonic's is how we translate
Filled with a mans, hate, one thing authorities just can't take
Do what I have to, contraband, following my niggas travels
We watch each others back, never snitch, ignore the gamble

[Chorus]
Ayo, I sold rocks, cause I love the rush of adrenaline
Pick locks, cause I couldn't go without Benjamins
Lick shots, to keep my enemies from entering
Fuck with cops, but without the badge and gun, they feminine
Stay a step ahead of these niggas, leave 'em waiting
You think that you got a plot that I never heard? you mistaken
It's getting got, if I see that's it's there for the taken
I'm cursed, risking it all willing to slap box with Satan

[Verse 2]
Have you ever made a killer bleed?
Attacking nigga's a gorilla speeds?
Eyes are watching, tell the customer to make the deal and leave
I'm bound to erupt with my temper
Hold it back, I'm tired of fucking with public defenders
That's word to Jesus, me and the judge just made a 60 day truce
I told him I wasn't the one carrying the tre-duce
Impressed with my demeanor he made the charge a misdemeanor
Even those I failed the breathalyzer  drunk upon [?]
Had [?] hide the product, in her shoes, blue suits, steady pushing my luck
I gotta choose, should I bounce to nigga [?] or continue to bomb through?
My mind is faring away in a whip like Tom Cruise
Father say, say what you mean, and mean what you say
Plus when you going after yours crush anything in your way
Remain 'laxed, feeling like the whole world hates me
How long will it be before the cremate me, know I seem crazy
But check it, crooks can be deceiving like looks, didn't do it, but I'm feeding the jooks
Put down your gat so we can both act tough
Know my limits, keep calm before I walk off in shackles and black cuffs
Young nigga's pushing explorers, that handle a biscuit, gamble for business
Train of thought, cannibalistic, bullet wounds and bodies over time, they get deeper than the grim reaper
Go searching to find all of the cheaters
Check, [?] parents having sex, it's apparent that I'm vexed
Maybe they should intense my therapy, want my true [?] to know
I'm one of the realest nigga's that you'll ever meet
Wounded deep in the heart, just me and my razor blade when I was sleeping in parks
Hoping they can weave through the dark
I went from stealing ten-speeds to open-mics for all the emcees
Riding the M3s, coalition getting the benjis

[Chorus]
Ayo, I sold rocks, cause I love the rush of adrenaline
Pick locks, cause I couldn't go without Benjamins
Lick shots, to keep my enemies from entering
Fuck with cops, but without the badge and gun, they feminine
Stay a step ahead of these niggas, leave 'em waiting
You think that you got a plot that I never heard? you mistaken
It's getting got, if I see that's it's there for the taken
I'm cursed, risking it all willing to slap box with Satan
