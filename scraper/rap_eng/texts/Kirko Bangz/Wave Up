[Hook]
Too many hoes on the wave up
Too many hoes tryna wave up
Too many blunts in the wave up
Too many ones in the wave up
I said I wouldn't be back but I'm
Back again too many hoes around
Had to bring my friends
My nigga he too young, but we got him in
You know it's time to stunt (time to wave up)

[Verse 1]
I kick this shit like the Dynamo
I'm high as shit yeah Geronimo
My Rollie watch yeah it tell me a lot
But it never tell me it's time to go
I do not find no fun in takin' pictures
I do not waste time on overrated bitches
I'm on the walls like hangin' pictures
Niggas hatin' cause my wrist is as cold as Da Vinci
Go and post it up like Olajuwon
Never ate the bitch out the octagon
Bouta po' the bottle, won

[Bridge]
Feelin' like we bouta win a chip chip
This that clutch city shit shit
Young as niggas gettin' rich rich
Niggas can't do it like this this
Hatin' ain't never did shit
Young nigga got a big dick

[Hook]
Too many hoes on the wave up
Too many hoes tryna wave up
Too many blunts in the wave up
Too many ones in the wave up
(I got too many fuckin' ones, I got too many fuckin' ones)
I said I wouldn't be back but I'm
Back again too many hoes around
Had to bring my friends
My nigga he too young, but we got him in
You know it's time to stunt (time to wave up)

[Verse 2]
It ain't April 1st but my bitches act a fool with it
Young ass nigga got three hoes and they cool with it
I got bitches droolin'
Dropped out, money stupid
Why I'm always stuntin'
Stuntin' like a movie
Yo bitch wanna move in (whoo), and I might let her
But first she gotta get a new ass, new tits, nails done, hair did
Just to get to my level

[Bridge]
Feelin' like we bouta win a chip chip
This that clutch city shit shit
Pop champagne let it drip
Who you with, who you with, who you with, who with
Is you fuckin' with some
Young as niggas gettin' rich rich
Niggas can't do it like this this
Hatin' ain't never did shit
Young nigga got a big dick

[Hook]
Too many hoes on the wave up
Too many hoes tryna wave up
Too many blunts in the wave up
Too many ones in the wave up
(I got too many fuckin' ones, I got too many fuckin' ones)
I said I wouldn't be back but I'm
Back again too many hoes around
Had to bring my friends
My nigga he too young, but we got him in
You know it's time to stunt (time to wave up)

Time to wave up, time to wave up
