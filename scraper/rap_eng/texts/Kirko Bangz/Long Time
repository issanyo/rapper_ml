[Verse 1]
I wrote this letter for my grandma and my auntie mayne
I got some people that really love me above me mayne
Sometimes I think about my people and I drop a tear
To talk to y'all I'll give this music shit up, I don’t care
I’m losing time, I’m losing minutes every night and day
Scared to pick up the phone ‘cause I think somebody gon die today
My grandpa called me told me grandson, I’m doing bad
I’m doing good but that convo got me doing bad
I look at pictures around my crib. my brother my sister
Hate that real life, doing y'all so bad, wish I was still little
And Imma liar if I say I ain’t wish I was still little
Them old folks tell ya man, ain’t nothing like life when you children
I miss the times that my momma put a whoopin on me
‘Cause I was punished but I snuck outside with all my homies
I miss them served sandwiches, that bread and that balogna
I miss not having to worry about who was my real homie
I miss riding my bike and pulling to that corner store
I bought two pieces but my pockets stole plenty more
I miss seeing momma at work, I miss her walking home
Man I miss everything that I don’t get to see no more

[Hook]
It’s been a long time
It’s been a long time
It’s been a long time
It’s been a long time

[Verse 2]
My daddy, he got seven kids, my mama got three
Step daddy locked up, he probably doing 23
Man, he on lock, when it come to kids he got like 23
So every time them kids need something, man they come to me
And I’m just really tryna train them for the real world
But,I ain’t finished training myself for this real world
And I know all the attention that I be giving them girls
I should get it in but man I cannot save the world
I know you can’t, but you can try, is what I tell myself
I know I’m short but short is where I never sell myself
I got Versace, all these diamonds, these Jordans and Nikes
And my little brother don’t want shit but some time and a bike
And I ain’t tryna make no broken promise like you
But I ain’t bought his bike yet, am I just like you?
And this little bitch she hit me up, ask me to take her out
It ain’t no question that Imma pop up in something new
My other brothers in the streets, they hitting leaks and shit
I say you tripping, he say I gotta pay the rent and shit
Plus I got a baby, other brother got a baby, other brother got a baby
My life too damn crazy

[Hook]
It’s been a long time
It’s been a long time
It’s been a long time
It’s been a long time
