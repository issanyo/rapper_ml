[Intro:]
You can say I'm tripping but I'm stingy and I can't hide it
Want to keep you all to me I'm selfish why try to fight it

[Verse 1:]
I been wanting you since we was younger yeah
And my mom used to hang with your mama
You used to run around with nappy haired Tanya (and y'all was so got damn close)
I used to try to get with you every summer (and you always tell a young nigga no)
We had to be in before the street lights
You kept the window up and I would sneak and ride
I would hold you close when we sleep at night
And we was so young but we was freaking right
Come to think about it
And we ain't even know what we was doing
And been down so long I can't even try to find me a new one

[Chorus:]
And this that Sanaa Lathan
This that Omar Epps
And this that all I need is your love and no one else
And this that me and you against the world
Feel like I grew up with you girl
What a nigga gon do without you
I'm through without you
I'm glued to you girl
This that love & basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
Say this that love & basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
That love and basketball shit

[Verse 2:]
We used to be on the block, we would fake all them interviews
You ask me what's the first thing I buy when I get the loot
And then you changed schools so I changed schools too
We used to wear the same shit always had the same shoes yeah
We used to hold hands down the hallway
#1 top 8 on the Myspace
And way before Kim K and Kanye
Me and you we was ripping down the runway
And na na na na
Can you bless me with a lil North baby
Or a lil Quincy McCall

[Chorus:]
And this that Sanaa Lathan
This that Omar Epps
And this that all I need is your love and no one else
And this that me and you against the world
Feel like I grew up with you girl
What a nigga gon do without you
I'm through without you
I'm glued to you girl
This that love & basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
Say this that love & basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
That love and basketball shit
