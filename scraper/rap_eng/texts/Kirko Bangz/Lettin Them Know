(Hook)
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds

(Verse : Kirko)
24’s on my ride, bad bitch up inside
5% percent of my team, ain’t a butter a tire
Coming out with that train
Nigga know you can try
And nigga know you can sip
If none you niggas ain’t by
I hold my H town about the window
And blow it up to the sky
My pinky ring and my watch bling
And they recognizing my shine
A young nigga so trill
Repping that east side
I’m coming down and I’m swanging hard
So you bitches know what I’m bout

(Hook)
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds

(Verse : Paul Wall)
No top,paper plates, I’m glass house on chrome
Too real with 2 cups, in the 2 seater getting gone
I’m far away from them clowns
I’m too 90, I’m gone
Got them little faces that old money
My paper seem to be grown
This bad bitch wanna bone
I met her in San Anton’
Then I put her on then made her walk
You know my mind is on
My grind is on, my shine glowing
Pulling up my stereo phone
You broke lazy and talking down
Please stay above off my phone
And stay up off of my nuts
You hoes weren’t here when I was alone
I smashed a broad in the parking lot
She ain’t never been in my home
I called a cheap by the wrong name
But that’s my bad, I was stoned
I’m showing skill, my cup fill
I’m Texas trill and I’m way too gone

(Hook)
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
Letting them boys know that the south
Is much, much too real than diamonds
