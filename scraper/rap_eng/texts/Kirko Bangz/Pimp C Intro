[Pimp C]
I don't give a fuck about Hip-Hop cause I ain't never made none of that shit
Them niggas been saying we wasn't real Hip-Hop from the beginning of time
They said we wasn't real Hip-Hop cause we ain't have no trains or no backpacks
And one leg, our pants ain't rolled up to our knee and shit
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
So you know, after a motherfucker tell you something for so long
Let you know they don't want you
Know what I'm saying?
After a while nigga don't wanna be down with you bitch ass niggas no more
Know what I'm saying?
We got our own shit down here
A long time ago we had our own music-music-music
