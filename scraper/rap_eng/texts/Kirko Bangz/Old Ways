[Verse 1]
I say lately we ain't been agreeing on some thangs
I ain't tryna sit around and hear yo shit all day
Ain't tryna hear about the shoes you want and I ain't tryna give you no change
And I ain't tryna be rude to you but bitch get out of my face
And I miss all the good times playing dominoes and spades
I know we gon have bad times but girl I ain't been doing the wrong thang
You know a nigga been good to you
And everything that you need then I give it to you, give it to you
But I ain't got time for no ungrateful bitches like you
I ain't even got no time to fight you
And I ain't got time for yo ass straight bitchin' at me
Man I swear I'm starting not to like you
I'm only 23 and I ain't got time for no bitch telling me when to be home
I'm only 23 bitch don't tell me how to spend my money when I'm the one that bring it home

[Hook]
Tonight I'm going back to my old ways
Tonight I'm going back to my old ways
It feel good to be right back in my old lane
Tonight I'm going back to my old ways

[Verse 2]
Tonight I'm about to piss you off and I'mma fuck a bitch cause you won't stop fuckin' with me
Tonight I'm about to piss you off and I'mma call your friend and I'mma tell her fuck with a G
You say you want some food so I went to get you some but I forgot to say no cheese
So you ain't gon' eat?
What the fuck you mean?
Then I'mma wrap it up I'mma take it right back
Give me my keys I'mma hop in the lac
You could take you a shower hop in the bed
Girl don't worry I'mma be right back
But I gotta stop cause my car on E
These girls keep calling me
And if I answer the phone
You won't stop calling me
It's like girls always know when you doing something wrong
And girls always know when a bitch in her home
But girls they don't know how to fuck with a nigga like me
I been tripping lately but tonight I'mma show you I'mma G

[Hook x2]
Tonight I'm going back to my old ways
Tonight I'm going back to my old ways
It feel good to be right back in my old lane
Tonight I'm going back to my old ways
