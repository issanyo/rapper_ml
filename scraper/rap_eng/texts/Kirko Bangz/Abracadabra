[Verse 1]
I see you whining and grinding with them freaky stilettoes on
The way your body's smoking
It's the way you cast a spell on me
We did wrong, but baby, let's go

[Bridge]
Girl, let me give you one hell of a night
Don't hold back tonight, I'm on it tonight
It's guaranteed all these things you gonna like
Know that you're ready

[Pre-Hook]
I want you performing, I'm loving your act
Don't run the bass while you making it clap
I'm so amazed how you moving like that
I'm in a daze when you move it like that
Make it disappear when you throwing it back
Then you are lying, you bring it right back
I'm so amazed how you do it like that
Girl, I don't know how you can do that

[Hook]
I call her hocus pocus, she call me Houdini
She let me lay her body down all night
I be like abracadabra
Baby, do me like magic
I say abracadabra
Watch me do you like magic
I say abracadabra
Baby, do me like magic
Like abracadabra
Watch me do you like magic

[Verse 2]
I'll make your body levitate, call me your Mr. Copperfield
I'mma lay that body smoking, tie you up so you know it's real
You know the deal, so take it if you want it

[Bridge]
Girl, let me give you one hell of a night
Don't hold back tonight, I'm on it tonight
It's guaranteed all these things you gonna like
Know that you're ready

[Pre-Hook]
I want you performing, I'm loving your act
Don't run the bass while you making it clap
I'm so amazed how you moving like that
I'm in a daze when you move it like that
Make it disappear when you throwing it back
Then you are lying, you bring it right back
I'm so amazed how you do it like that

[Hook]
I call her hocus pocus, she call me Houdini
She let me lay her body down all night
I be like abracadabra
Baby, do me like magic
I say abracadabra
Watch me do you like magic
I say abracadabra
Baby, do me like magic
Like abracadabra
Watch me do you like magic

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
I know I ain't the first person, though, but I won't take it personal
I never been the type to spend no change
But it would be worth it, though
She be slutting down the pole, what I do she'll never know
She know I ain't perfect but I'm perfect when I work it, though
Money ain't a thing, baby, you can get whatever you want
We ain't got no aim, baby, do what you do, don't tell me nothing
I ain't gonna complain, no, I ain't gonna complain
'Cause shorty got that M-A-G-I-C
Shorty laid it down, she done hypnotized me
I'm walking around this club and she ain't nowhere to be seen
Damn, I guess this tricks on me

[Hook]
I call her hocus pocus, she call me Houdini
She let me lay her body down all night
I be like abracadabra
Baby, do me like magic
I say abracadabra
Watch me do you like magic
I say abracadabra
Baby, do me like magic
Like abracadabra
Watch me do you like magic
