[Verse 1]
Room full of women, champagne sipping
Codeine cups kinda slowing up my vision
Swisha sweet yeah, but it ain't sweeter than Crystal
That's my ex bitch outta Texas, dedicate this to her
H-Town living, purple Sprite sipping
In and out of town for a late night visit
Party all night, so the clocks still ticking
Hold up, let me start from the beginning
First, we chopped it up and she schooling me like the way she blew me
Had her dripping like candy paint, pussy like a Jacuzzi
"Love you baby" she said that, I ain't fronting I said back
Because I thought I had a rider, now I'm wishing I could replay it back

[Pre-Hook]
Girl, I know you told me that you found somebody
But I never thought it could be true
Now I'm tripping cause you could have had anybody
Instead of someone of my crew

[Hook]
You know what you did, to get back to me
Now you fucking with him, thought you was fucking with me
But you ain't gonna break me baby, I won't let you get to me
So I'm in my phone and I'm gon' call up some company, got this drank in my cup
