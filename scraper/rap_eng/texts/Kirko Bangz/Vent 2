      Uh, rest in peace Lil Snupe
I'm trying to chase the same dream and stay up off of the news
I never met you but I'm affected man it's fucked up dude
Niggas out here killing niggas and the niggas in school
Scared to go cause they can't go if they don't carry a tool
And gunshots to hit the baby while she pray on the food
I don't turn on the news
They done turn us to fools
If you get shot nobody help you rather world star your wound
Niggas will piss on your tomb, break ya little sis in ya room
Niggas assisting with this bitch shit
When did this shit turn cool?
We ain't got enough room
Ain't got no teachers in school
And they create diseases and they say the reason is you
I don't believe in your truth
I don't believe that you'll shoot
But if you do this just my body when my spirit is loose
I pray to God he find some kindness to forgive me I knew
When I did wrong it's cause this world they ain't believing in you
I got some pleasing to do I gotta feast on this loot
I ain't material but when you got shit people listen to you
My real fans tell me 'Kirk I need some lyrics from you'
I will give you real shit but that real shit ain't appealing to you
I got them Eminem roots, and I ain't never seen Roots
Ain't into TV as a youngin to ignore shit I hoop
Can't tell you the last time I hoop I can tell you the last ho I screwed
Can't tell you a verse from the Bible but can write a verse when I snooze
And I ain't grow up in church but I ain't no different from you
That nigga got like 20 years he been in church since he two
My nigga ask are you cool?
I got offended like dude
Don't be getting sentimental, don't I look like I'm cool?
I fuck the girl of my dreams, I got the car of my dreams
I got the crib of my dreams but I'm so far from my dreams
I feel like wanting to be a star it took my heart away from me
When I play basketball I swear I work way harder for me
But I ain't caught up in me
And yeah your daughter is sweet
But I don't want her to think that mama left her father for me
Some shit been bothering me man don't be loyal to me
Cause soon as you show me you love me I'll destroy you then leave
And don't you show em too much love cause they'll will leave you on E
Man I ain't fake it's just that you longer important to me
My step pops just got off lock and the first person he see
Was the first person he seen when mama had her first king
I had them braces on my legs I was forest gumping
Couldn't walk straight but now we sitting in that foreign black thing
Told him how everybody doing don't fuck up my regime
I've been daddy for too long I need some help with the team
