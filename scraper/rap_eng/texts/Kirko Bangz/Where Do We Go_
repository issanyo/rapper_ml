[Hook: Kid Ink]
Where do we go from here?
Waiting all this time, now we finally here
Your body is cold as hell
I just wanted to tell ya, been workin' all day
I think you should come try to have a little fun tonight girl
Grab one of these cups, try to have a little fun tonight girl
Can't get enough, try to have a little fun tonight girl
Go turn it up, try to have a little fun tonight homie

[Verse: Kirko Bangz]
You been waiting all night girl
I heard you had a little fight girl
Don't worry, don't worry
I'ma make it all better, I'ma make it alright girl
You say your man don't talk to you
I'll make you talk all night girl
But don't move to fast, take a sip, take a sip
Little purp, little Sprite girl
Let's take it slow, let's make it last
I'ma get that body, I'ma take that chance
And give you what you need now
I'm in the backyard of your lake house
Bout to go divin' but I hope I don't on me take out

[Hook]
