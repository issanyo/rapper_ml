[Verse 1]
Why the fuck you’re trying to play me
Fuck you tryna to play me?
Girl, just cause we’re fucking, that doesn’t mean we married
Why the fuck you’re trying to play me?
Why the fuck you’re trying to play me?
Girl, just cause we’re fucking, that don’t make you my lady
Fuck you tryna to play me?
Fuck you tryna to play me?
You act like you my nigga
But I know you nigga is shady
What a fuck you’re trying to play me, dawg?
I ain't got no time to sit around and play with y'all
You hate me cause I made it dawg
I guess the right thing for me to do right now is to wait on ya'll
No fuck that, I’mma walk up in this mother fucker with my hands up
Wit my hands up
Makin all these motherfuckers put their hands up
If they ask for a nigga from the ghetto motherfucker that'll kill motherfuckers I'mma stand up
I know some girls that said they can't jam us
I know some girls that can’t stand us
But this is because when we met, we fucked
And every time they call I don’t answer
Don’t play me
Cause you know that if I was there right now
Bitch you would try to see me
Yeah, I fucked your friends, and your fuck ass man wanna be me
And Stacy I used to love her, she was there before I blew up
But I guess I, I just been gone too long
Or I guess I’ve been holding on too long
Or maybe, I’ve been putting me on too long

[Verse 2]
Whatever it is, or what it may be
You got a man or I been acting shady
I enjoyed the moments, sayin girl you made me smile
I just wish that you was here with me right now
Nah really, I’m just pissed cause you ain’t down
Like you said you would, like you said you would
And I fucked it up like you said I would
And I knew I would but don’t be trying to play me
Don’t be trying to play me
Say don’t be trying to play me
Don’t be trying to play me
And my family, I love family
But the word mean more it's embarrassing
They been drop my name, drop my name
Talking about that I’m about to drop that change
I’m the same old nigga, got the same old digits
But everybody about to make me change on niggas
Change on niggas, change on niggas
And it's funny how I made it and these people steady callin'
Same people didn't know me till a nigga started ballin'
I just spent ten in the strip club
Walk in today, and these bitches acting like they don’t know me
Know me, I think my new bitch really want me
But she with a nigga I ain’t tripping cause her homie
Know she wanna fuck, I ain’t really wanna fuck
Then the bitch walked up saying don’t be trying to play me
Don’t be trying to play me
Don’t be trying to play me
Don’t be trying to play me
