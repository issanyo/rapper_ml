Her nigga on a trip so everything go

Her nigga on a trip so everything go

She ain't really worried about the glitter and the gold
She just wanna talk about her dreams and her goals
She wanna talk all the time I ain't got time for her
But a nigga like me still make time for her
She used to be cold hearted now her ass want to vent to me
