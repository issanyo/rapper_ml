[Intro]
A lil bitch pack 12, looking like a case of beer, a lot of cake in here
Young nigga, y'all niggas got me fucked up nigga

[Verse]
Ugh, nigga, I done seen it all, got a lot of niggas involved
They don't even wanna see me evolve
I done pulled up, suit and tie, like a young nigga on trial
Got flow like a nigga was toweled
Hungover off the bullshit, taking shots of Mr. Chows
Burning hoes like forensic fouls
Got a .40 on a nigga just in case it get physical
That bitch screamed like missed the count
Young nigga off the bench and shit
My hoes fly to you boy, man, I call that shit a business trip
Pull up in expensive shit
With a heart of role play, but she don't fuck with that Spencer's shit
Boy I been the trip
Like I had two brothers that was born on the same day and same year, a lot of cake in here
And that lil bitch pack 12, like to call that bitch a case of beer
Young nigga still got money
And I ain't got a lot of friends, I don't need nobody vouching for me
A young nigga got a lot of money
Left my future on her face, young nigga got a lot coming
Make some money nigga stop humbling
And get some bread nigga stop crumbling
Make it stretch, you are not lunging
Nigga I done seen it all, like a movie in the fall
Drop the "f," I am not bluffing
Stop claiming you are not fucking
Throwing money you are not touching
Private nigga, you are not public
Hold, up, these niggas see me, these niggas, they wanna be me
The nigga that got the nun sending pics in a bikini
My nigga I am a monster, I'm honest, ain't got no conscious
Yo bitches, they want a function at my motherfucking luncheon
I tell that bitch take a break like reaching for they grub
Ho, take a recess
Bitch gotta reset
Ass so fat that I beep it
Dick stay hard, that's a preset
I ain't even peek yet
Niggas pissed off I ain't leak yet
I'm Jay-Z, ain't mad, I ain't bleak yet
Young nigga like B.I
Pull up on niggas like T.I
I do not wear no damn Filas
It's a young nigga from the east side of the Houston, Texas
Bitch I kick big game like FIFA

[Outro]
Yeah
Motherfucker
Young H-Town shit nigga
