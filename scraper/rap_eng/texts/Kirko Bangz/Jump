[Intro: Derek King]
Jump jump, Derek King
Jump jump, Sage the Gemini
Jump jump, Kirko Bangz
Jumpin', jumpin'

[Verse 1: Derek King]
Oh, yeah I'm in the building
You know, I had to take it to the club
I see you over there winning
Girl this could be more than just a crush
Cause I love the way you do it
Let's go, baby take it to the floor
Oh, thinking I might be catching feelings
With the way that your moving make it jump

[Pre-Chorus: Derek King]
Girl, you know what I want
And baby girl I can't front
I'm in love
Go ahead and bring it back
Drop it like a DJ
All up on the track, runnin' like a relay
Baby it's a wrap, thinking of making a remix to this song?
You know that it's on

[Chorus: Derek King]
All, all up on the stage, do it like that
I'm calling your name, girl look back
I see you, now baby I need you to do it for me
Go ahead and make the booty jump
Baby, go and make the booty jump
Go, go ahead and make the booty jump
So make it go, go, go, go
Go ahead and make it, jump, jump
Baby you can make it, jump, jump
Go and McEddy make it, jump, jump
She stay turnt up but she keep the booty
Jumpin', jumpin'

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
I am, a real life player
Lookin' for that girl in here that look like Draya
Used to like Keisha, now it's K Michelle
Now I'm looking for a ghetto girl with red hair
I got a thing for ebony, call me Mr. Lozato
And I just seen a girl in here that look like her daughter
And I'mma spend these G's on her, promise I won't beat on her
Sing like R. Kelly, but I promise I won't Pee
I'm McEddy, McEddy, Mac Daddy, I'm back at it
These McEddy, McEddy mathematics, got boys mad at
The things that's getting that doe, Cervezas and that pote
Nicki Minaj just called and said she going make it jump when I hit that though

[Chorus: Derek King]
All, all up on the stage, do it like that
I'm calling your name, girl look back
I see you, now baby I need you to do it for me
Go ahead and make the booty jump
Baby, go and make the booty jump
Go, go ahead and make the booty jump
So make it go, go, go, go
Go ahead and make it, jump, jump
Baby you can make it, jump, jump
Go and McEddy make it, jump, jump
She stay turnt up but she keep the booty
Jumpin', jumpin'

[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
Uh, I heard you good off them other dudes
With that attitude you ain't satisfied and without a dude
Uh, and I ain't tryna battle you
But I guarantee outta you
He's a dog like a malamute
I, mean no, harm but I see you ex-man
Wasn't talking healthy, lean cuisine
Flow, me and P-Lo, heart breakers
But I can see no bad intentions this far
This situations creo
I'm sorry If I'm talking like it's good
Or if we Trayvon Martin, we both from the hood
I seen you looking from afar, so I think I could tell you
That love is free do not give it for a jewel, uh

[Chorus: Derek King]
All, all up on the stage, do it like that
I'm calling your name, girl look back
I see you, now baby I need you to do it for me
Go ahead and make the booty jump
Baby, go and make the booty jump
Go, go ahead and make the booty jump
So make it go, go, go, go
Go ahead and make it, jump, jump
Baby you can make it, jump, jump
Go and McEddy make it, jump, jump
She stay turnt up but she keep the booty
Jumpin', jumpin'
