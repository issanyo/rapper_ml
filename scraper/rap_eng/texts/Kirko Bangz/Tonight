[Verse 1]
She sent me 25 pictures in the mirror
I asked her what she drinking
She say 'It's 25 ways to the middle'
She asked me can I make it
I'm doing 50 in the 95
Tryna keep my cool at the same time
She doing 50 in the 95
I tell her baby girl just take ya time, just take ya time
Say when you want it and you need it girl just call me
But when I'm getting to this money girl don't call me
I know them niggas that you fucking with they all weak, they all weak
Girl that's all me but

[Hook]
Girl I gots to go girl, tonight I'll be back for you
I'mma do you nice and slow girl, slow girl, slow girl
I'mma take my time but girl I can't be all day, all day
I gotta ride, I told my boys I'm on the way
Say girl I gots to go girl but tonight I'll be back for you

My mind is on
What your mind is on
Girl ain't nothing wrong
We can't be that long, can't be that long

[Verse 2]
Say I can give you a piece baby
But baby girl that's all
Don't be blowing up my phone
Don't be blowing up my phone, b-b-blowing up my phone
And I promise girl that I'mma do yo body right
Get them candles girl and I'mma light em up tonight
Just keep my shirt on and them panties you don't need tonight, you don't need tonight
I'mma do you like I'm suppose to yeah

[Hook]
Girl I gots to go girl, tonight I'll be back for you
I'mma do you nice and slow girl, slow girl, slow girl
I'mma take my time but girl I can't be all day, all day
I gotta ride, I told my boys I'm on the way
Say girl I gots to go girl but tonight I'll be back for you

[Outro]
Let me turn them lights down
Light a couple candles like a real nigga would
Ima turn on some H-town
Some Jodeci, some R-Kelly shit
And let you do the rest
