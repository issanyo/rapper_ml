Bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
1’s, 5’s, 10’s, 20’s, round and round, round and round
Work yo way up to that big face money
Baby know that she bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

Say you remind me of my jeep I wanna ride it
Something like my sound my trunk stay pumpin'
Girl you look just like my car
That fifth wheel shinin'
And something like my bank account I wanna spend it baby
Local club in my city I fell in love with a stripper
Made my bitch a celebrity now yo bitch wanna tip her
Double cup in a zipper I got yo bitch on my zipper
I’m a mufuckin pimp I make her come back with triple
I be walking through this bitch like my shit don’t stink
Got the club looking like I put a pole in the bank
Met a bad yella dime with a real pretty face
Threw her ass on that bitch and now I call that ho bank
Nigga we got them dollars oh yeah we got them models
And boy your section full of nothing but niggas no bottles
We up in that VIP
That’s some very important pussy if that bitch round me

Bangz
