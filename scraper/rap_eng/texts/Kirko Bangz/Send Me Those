[Intro: Kirko Bangz]
I was on the bullshit
Now I'm back and balling nigga on some more shit
Shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty on some poor shit
Money going round I'm bout to throw some more shit

[Hook]
Send me those bank rolls
Send me those bank rolls
Send me those, bank rolls
Send me those bank rolls

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Run them up, pesos
One of us got to lose
Front page we the news (we the news)
She bought a new body (she bought a new body)
Then she caught a few bodies (she caught a few bodies)
Yeah! Bitch wanna fuck the crew
My nigga that's nothing new
Don't dab me up in the club (don't do it, dont do it)
You know I don't fuck with you

[Pre-Hook]
Ain't see nothing like you
Throwin these stacks at you
Got them legs wrapped around the pole
So much money she might sell her soul

[Hook]
Send me those bank rolls

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]

[Skit]
Here we are back again at the the National Strip Club Classics We have Kirko Bangz stepping up to that ass
And here he is with the beautiful wind up and he throws

[Verse 2 cont.]
All my real niggas fuck with the same hoes
I been going hard for two days still got the same clothes
I cut my tempo could have gave all this shit to my kinfo
When niggas talking down I got them [?]
Your baby momma [?]
Have to throw it way back like she limbo
Have to hit my trap bitch in the bando
Talking bout the AC in the window
Only light without a cell phone and candles

[Pre-Hook]
Ohh, ain't seen nothing like you
Throwing these stacks at you
Got them legs wrapped around that pole
So much money she might sell her soul

[Hook]
Send me those bank rolls
Send me those bank rolls
Send me those, bank rolls
Send me those (send me those, send me those)
Ooo, yeah, bank rolls
Send me those, send me those bank rolls
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
