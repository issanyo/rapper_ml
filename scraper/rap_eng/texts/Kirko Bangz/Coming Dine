[Hook: Ingrid]
Light it up, light it up one time for your mind
It's the girl Ingrid and you know I'm coming dine
But really I came up though
So leave that bullshit up at the front door

[Verse 1: Ingrid]
If I see it, I want it, I buy it, I own it
Well think that's for certain, this money I'm gon' get
And I know all y'all didn't heard of me, so...
One time for my OG Big Moe
Roll up 'bout three more sweets then blow

[Hook: Ingrid]
Light it up, light it up one time for your mind
It's the girl Ingrid and you know I'm coming dine
But really I came up though
So leave that bullshit up at the front door

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
You know I smoke every day
And I don't care what people say
I fire up in every club
You already know what Devin does
I keep a bag of weed, keep a fat sweet rolled
Smell like a track meet, fuckin' athlete's toes
I had three shows, been three long days
But the nights been to the pipe
They threw some weed on stage
So I'm good for about a week
I buy my sweets by the cases
I'll smoke one in the streets
Or at the beach with my lady
Ingrid's in the house and you know she's coming dine
She represents the South, looking good no doubt
If there's a drought, I'll still go get it
I'll hop to the hippy, stop babysitting
Don't hold it nigga, hit it
I brought my nigga Reggie, yeah he from the dutty
That nigga grew up with me, that's my mothafuckin' buddy
He's loud and disrespectful, but yo, he hasn't seen shit
He don't mean it, sing it Ingrid

[Hook: Ingrid]
Light it up, light it up one time for your mind
It's the girl Ingrid and you know I'm coming dine
But really I came up though
So leave that bullshit up at the front door

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
Yo look, I'm lil Kirk taking trips to Cancun
Drop my tape, my cartoon coming soon
Blowing up like a hot air balloon
Living in the penthouse, twenty-five rooms
Houston Texas, young and reckless
Disrespect me and I'mma come and check it
TV Journey got me by the necklace
Diamonds jumping like [?]
Cut you up 'til you see my blisters
I ain't from third ward but this child was destined
And that purple drink all in my intestines
I'm driving so slow I look like a pedestrian
Yo, I can sing a song or be a conscious rapper
I'm a court you rapper not a cordial rapper
With these vulture rappers, hold up...

[Hook: Ingrid]
Light it up, light it up one time for your mind
It's the girl Ingrid and you know I'm coming dine
But really I came up though
So leave that bullshit up at the front door

[Outro: Ingrid]
Light it up, light it up one time for your mind
It's the girl Ingrid and you know I'm coming dine
But really I came up though
So leave that bullshit up at the front door
