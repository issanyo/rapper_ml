[Hook: BeatKing & Ken Randle]
Keisha she the livest of her partners
Middle of the stage for that paper she gon' drop it
She gone off that liquor, her home girls always blocking
But she love to twerk they can't stop it
Bust it down, bust it down, bust it down, bust it down
Bust it down ,bust it down , bust it down, bust it down
Ass up, face down

[Verse 1: BeatKing]
Club God young H-Town nigga grippin' grain
Got your main on my dick and I don't know her name
She gon' bust it for a rich nigga with some fame
Heard she got that whip, when im finna  her make it rain
Trick throw that ass like a motherfucking pass
If she drop it fast Imma throw this fucking cash
It don't matter if she yella or she dark or she tatted
If she thick I gotta have it, I'm a strip club addict

Head down, ass up girl you know the rules
You finna fuck a fat nigga tonight, bitch I'm the truth

[Verse 2: Rico Love]
She said she dancin' but she go to school
I said either way I spend it on you, what it do
Heard I used to hit a couple shawtys in your crew
But that pussy old and your pussy brand new
Landed in the H told her where I stay
Get here right way
Liquor up on my breath I still smell like the MIA
Keisha know the deal though bring that other Keisha with you
Kiss her, fuck her with a dildo, face all in the pillow
Then put on your clothes and go to work
I'ma pull up round 2 and  spend it like a customer
After that it's round two, me on you and you on her
Her on me [?] shirt
Tomorrow's a fucking blur
Me Keisha and Keisha

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
Them bitches here be actin' like they workin' I swear them bitchesdon't be doing shit
I swear the first time I see Keisha in person I put them bitches in a pool pit
The Keisha babe so my type it's like her first name stereo
I wanna see if that right but I can't see that on the radio
Lil Keisha drop it down to the floor
She got my ex bitches checkin' on me
That Keisha right here gettin' naked on me

She got a nigga goin' dick so hard, she thinkin' I got a pissin' on me
I'm sippin' on the drank, jammin' on the screw, money in the bank, girl what it do ?
