Hook:
Say I'mma hold it down for my niggas put it down for my niggas man
Say I'mma keep it real with my niggas stay trill with my niggas man
Say I'mma hold it down for my niggas put it down for my niggas man
Say I'mma keep it real with my niggas stay trill with my niggas man

(Verse 1)
Uh, shit
My nigga lost his pops
My sister had a kid
My auntie lost her crib
I'm complaining 'bout this bitch
What the fuck I'm on, let a nigga live
But every time I turn around man it's some more shit
My auntie call she say 'why you ain't talking to me?'
Before I ball man none of y'all was talking to me
My cousin call he say 'man thanks for burning me out'
But when I was down and out nobody was burning me out
And my niggas man they look at me like I'm a leader
But I'm just tryna give them something that they can believe in
They feel like everybody done turn they backs on 'em
But ain't no way I'm turning my back on 'em

Hook:

Say I'mma hold it down for my niggas put it down for my niggas man

(Verse 2)
Yeah shit
I pray to God that the times right
And hope I don't get caught in the limelight
My bitch looking at me like what we gon' do?
My niggas looking at me like these bitches all for you
My mama looking at me, like the choice is yours
Go to the dealership, that Rolls Royce is hers
I ain't got shit for my pops, ain't even got lent for my pops
So rich don't even gotta talk shit to my pops
Uh, and I ain't even really trippin' dog cause now I'm chillin'
Just tryna let these niggas know about they children
That just want 'em to throw 'em the ball
And when they get older you wonder why they don't kick it with yaÂ´ll, damn

Hook:
Say I'mma hold it down for my niggas put it down for my niggas man
Say I'mma keep it real with my niggas stay trill with my niggas man
Say I'mma hold it down for my niggas put it down for my niggas man
Say I'mma keep it real with my niggas stay trill with my niggas man

(Outro)
Living this life so crazy, crazy
A nigga got nowhere to go, nowhere to go
They saying that a young nigga made it
But I'm still all on my own, all on my own
Uh, I'mma hold it down for my niggas put it down for my niggas man
And I'mma keep it real with my niggas stay trill with my niggas man
