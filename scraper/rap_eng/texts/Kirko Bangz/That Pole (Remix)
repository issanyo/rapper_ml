[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Say she in King of Diamonds Monday
Ain't scared to get that money
And back in church by Sunday
But we all know she’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
She’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
Uh, say she in school Tuesday through Friday
Friday night, that’s my day
But Saturday through Sunday, she ‘bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Uh, said she in love with that pole, she's so in love with that pole
She love wakin' up, love wakin' up, wakin' up with that dough
I love it when she come home all the way drunk and all the way throwed
Said, "Boy be on that way," so you know I be on that road
Got that drink up in my cup but that don’t mean that I move slow
Drank up in my cup but that don’t mean that I fuck slow
She got a tattoo on her ass, you know it say Kirko
She tattooed to her cash, shakin' that ass and lettin' it go
She like, "Baby boy, don’t trip about it, everythin' you hear 'cause these hoes
Sneakin' round on the low and I’m just out here gettin' my dough"
I’m like, "Baby girl, don’t trip about it, everythin' you hear ‘cause these hoes
Sneakin' round on the low and knowin' they wanna get on that pole"

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Say she in King of Diamonds Monday
Ain't scared to get that money
In back in church by Sunday
But we all know she’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
She’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
Say she in school Tuesday through Friday
Friday night, that’s my day
But Saturday through Sunday, she ‘bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah girl, I got all this money, do it, do it for me
Make that booty clap, I got racks if you want it
It's yours 'cause, baby, we gon' get this party started
You better turn your phone off, don't want them niggas calling
Come here, you be pulling down on my zipper
I'ma give it to you and then her and y'all can get on this pole together
You giving them chills, you 'bout to climax while I'm hitting your back
How does it feel? Say I don't know but you started something
There she go, on the pole
Drop it, drop it low on the floor
I'ma put my hands up if you just do it some more
She doing it like a pro, she doing it like a pro on the pole

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz & Chris Brown]
Say she in King of Diamonds Monday
Ain't scared to get that money
In back in church by Sunday
But we all know she’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
She’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
Ugh, say she in school Tuesday through Friday
Friday night, that’s my day
But Saturday through Sunday, she ‘bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
