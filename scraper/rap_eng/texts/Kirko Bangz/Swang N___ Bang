[Chorus]
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang
Feel like I wanna, feel like I wanna
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang

[Verse 1]
Yeah, swigity swang it to the left and I swigity swerve
All this ice on my neck, look like that what George Gurban
Throwback Michael Laurence, swangin' on a suburban
Tryna make the money flip like that boy with the [?]
Summertime in my city, wood grainin', I'ma grip it
Give me the cup, give me the ice, give me the drink, I'ma sip it
Trunks popped, top shops, still ballin' in the [?]
Those slugs 'bout age like it's 1996
I'ma slip, I'ma slide, boys that got lava
Peanut butter seats on my ass, I'm reclinin'
Gosh you're so skilled, keep my hand on the wheel
Pulled up on my uncle, had some slabs on the grill
It's soin' down in the hood, man, it's live in the hood
Today's a good day, nobody died in the hood
Summertime in the H-Town, I'ma climb
Got these poppers lookin' at me 'cause I'm showin' my surround

[Chorus]
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang
Feel like I wanna, feel like I wanna
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang

[Verse 2]
Whether it’s sunny or gray we gon' ball n’ parlay
Laid back in the shade, rockin' razer face
Got the Volv's with the swings, still throwin' the game
Trunk popped, let it bang, think I'm hoggin' the lane
Start ridin' through the boroughs, I ain't huggin' the curb
20 ounce water bottle and I filled it with syrup
Last house, let 'em peak, take a loot at my teeth
Flippin' it down on i10, 'bout to go to the East
Tryna bring that capper, I'm a perpetrate packer
I'm a bitch nigga slapper and a fast ass tapper
Top drop smokin' reef, all my Qs and Ps
Hatin' niggas around me, so I move discrete
Laid back, start ridin' in a Gucci and a Prada
Put 100 thousand dollars in my niece pinata
Summertime in the H-Town, know I gotta climb
Got these poppers lookin' at me 'cause I'm showin' my surround

[Chorus]
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang
Feel like I wanna, feel like I wanna
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang

[Bridge]
Swang on the North side, on the South side
On the East side, on the West side
On the North side, on the South side
On the East side, on the West side

[Chorus]
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang
Feel like I wanna, feel like I wanna
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang

[Bridge]
Swang on the North side, on the South side
On the East side, on the West side
On the North side, on the South side
On the East side, on the West side

[Outro]
I wanna swang, yeah
Swang it back
Swang it back
Swang it back, baby
Feel like I wanna swang n' bang, yeah
Gon' swang n' bang
