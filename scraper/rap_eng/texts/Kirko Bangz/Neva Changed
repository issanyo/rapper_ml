[Hook]
Say I ain't neva changed on niggas
I always been the same lil nigga
And everything payed for nigga
But niggas throwing shade at me since I got
This money, this house and these cars and these clothes
They said this would happen a long time ago
My mama told me 'watch these bitches'
And my daddy told me 'watch these niggas'

[Verse 1]
Uh, I pray to God he put my pride to the side
I'm looking for my real niggas it's like everyone died
But I gotta survive and hold it down for my pride
A little nigga lying hard and put myself to the side
But I know, some niggas ain't down, some niggas don't ride for me no more
And I know, when niggas get hungry niggas will ride on me for sure
And I know, some niggas that say that they'll kill for me
Take they gun and kill me man
They wouldn't have a meal for me if I wasn't Kirko
I hold it down for niggas, ride for niggas, provide for niggas
I'm on the grind for niggas, supply for niggas, I'm tired of niggas
Asking questions about a nigga
That shit make me wanna ride on niggas
And I don't need that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm paranoid niggas on the way
And everyday another nigga getting sprayed
Feel like I ain't been home in a minute
Can you please leave me alone for a minute?
I see my people hurting man I wish they had some money
I'm driving foreigns but I gotta tell them wait it's coming
But they say don't want no thousands just a couple hundred
But I can't get it everyone I gotta save me something
My mama told me 'son, don't stress about it'
But lately man y'all I been stressed about it
I used to do this music cause I loved it man
Lately I've been doing it just to help somebody, damn
