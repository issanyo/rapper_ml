[Verse 1: Couch Potato]
Why don't you ride with a nigga ma?
Why don't you ride with a nigga ma? Come slide with a nigga ma
Go and get fly for a nigga ma
Round about 9 I'mma pick you up
Got a nice body and a killer walk
Man I can't wait to get them heels up
She prolly wants me more cause she can't have me
Run game like a try meet, keep up
When I'm there, she touching me
When I'm not, she texting me
Tore up flow up niggas try to put a stop to me
Rap so good, my ticket out the hood, lottery
I gotta be the hottest
See your eyes on the drank come girl come take a walk with me
Promise you, back to the crib, do what we wanna do
Pass you the drink and we get them clothes off of you (off of you)
We here, whats up
Come in, Im up
For whatever to up to I girl I got this drank in my cup

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Verse 2: Ca$h]

I've been thinking about you
Damn girl that body
Margarita and a molly, we so turned up in this party
Keep dancing like that, might make you my shawty
Lay you on your backside, tell me how you want it
I must admit I am intrigue by your conversation
Your man be tripping, "Where you going?"
Wanting explanations
Tell him that shit done, expiration
And let me take you to the top elevation
M stands for more
G stands for great sex
The sex is like a magic show I swear you so amazing
Ever since I laid eyes, fantasied you naked
You can trust me with your heart
I promise I'll never break it
They say nice guys finish last, so she come first cause my bitch bad
I nail that like a carpenter
She got a hair done, but I fuck it up
Dick so good i make her sleep and miss class
She try to talk on the phone
But she girl i call you back
