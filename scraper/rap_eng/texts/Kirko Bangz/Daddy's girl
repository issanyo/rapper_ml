Yee... dear daddy's girl
You know that daddy loves you
But right now you still in heaven
So, no one's above you
Whenever times get cold
Your daddy's covers
I know it's crazy but
Daddy's yet to meet your mother
And if I have then I guess I've yet to love her
And in the past if I would've fucked some other
You will come into this world with an older brother
Not even knowing that I never loved his mother
But how can daddy tell 'em moma was a quick fuckin'
N his moma askin me to promise that I love him
He think his daddy wouldn't rather anything but him
But my heart ain't wid her so I can't stay
And his mom tryna throw it in yo daddy face
Like I ain't shit n she hope it's hunts me forever
Knowing her n your dad was never together
And that's the start of how black people killin' each other

I just wanna make it perfect for my baby girl
But ican't, it's such a shame we in a crazy world
I jst wish that I can talk to my baby girl
And give her a little head start so she could see the world [x2]

Yeee... baby, when it come to these niggas
Keep ya head in yo books, cause these niggas they'll kill ya
They'll try ya, cry ya, bribe ya out yo panties
N leave ya heart broken like 'why ya can't stand me? '
When you did everything he wanted you to do
But when the right thing is what a nigga wants fo' you
That wouldn't cross his mind he like 'whatchu wanna do? '
If it's a walk through the park he reply like 2 or 3 or 4 until his day be happy
I jst hope you meet the man tht make my baby happy
With our family, imight as well stop rappin'
But wid baby on my mind, I gotta make it happen man
N every late night, I'm wide awake arguin
With yo grandma, she workin like the Mexican
And my girlfriend, told me not to call again
Nights like this, I just wish I had my daughter man...

I just wanna make it perfect for my baby girl
But ican't, it's such a shame we in a crazy world
I just wish that I can talk to my baby girl
And give her a little head start so she could see the world [x2]

And I know you gon' hate the talks but, I'm a let chu know
Cause I'm a hate to see the day when daddy let chu go...
And for smooth sailing, daddy will buy you a boat
But daddy know, daddy gotta let his baby grow...
And don't you ever forget our lil conversations
Think about it on your birthday and graduation
And don't worry bout daddy baby, I'm a make it
I just gotta work hard and have patience
I will never forget our lil conversations
I'll think about it on your birthday n graduation
N don't worry bout daddy baby, I'm a make it
I just gotta work hard and have patience...

I just wanna make it perfect for my baby girl
But ican't, it's such a shame we in a crazy world
I just wish that I can talk to my baby girl
And give her a little head start so she could see the world...
