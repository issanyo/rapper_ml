[Intro]

Oh my, it's DiMuro

Posta

Legit Paper

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]

Bounce it for me, girl, drop it on me
Put your hands on your knees and come pop it on me
Girl, I ain't come here for no shy shit
If you want to, come get it, come take it from me
I see you lookin' from across the club
Girl, i ain't out here trying to fall in love
Yo nigga to blame, thats who's fault it was
I ain't got no business involved with ya'

And now im like "Wussup, Wussup, Wussup"
Are you sure you want a nigga like me?
Girl, you don't want a nigga like me
And now you like "Wussup, Wussup, Wussup, Wussup"
You want a young playa like me
Lemme tell you one thing 'bout me

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

I know you a good girl, good girl, good girl, good girl
But tonight i need you to be bad for me
(tonight i need you to be bad for me)
I know you a good girl, good girl, good girl, good girl
But tonight i need you to get ratchet for me
(tonight i need you to get ratchet for me)

'Cause i ain't in the mood for no good girl
I ain't go to no club for no good girl
I ain't tryna chill with no good girl

Tonight i ain't down for no good girl
I ain't tryna mess around with no good girl
I ain't tryna waste time with no good girl

[Verse Intro: Ray JR]
Now bounce it for me, bounce it for me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now bounce it for me, bounce it for me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now bounce it for me, bounce it for me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now bounce it for me, bounce it for me (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Ray JR]
Young nigga from the east
Know i fuck her like a beat
I need a good girl in the streets
But a pornstar in the sheets, aye
Tatt my name on your lower back
So i can see it when i grip it
I came to knock it out the park
Like you underarm pitched it
Love when you dance nasty
Like a stripper from the A-Town
She wanna ride on it like a bus
Bitch stretched long like a grey hound, yeah
Only in town for the weekend
Came thru the back door, sneaked in
Pussy get wetter than a pool
Young nigga swim in the deep end

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

I know you a good girl, good girl, good girl
But tonight i need you to be bad for me
(tonight i need you to be bad for me)
But tonight i need you to get ratchet for me
(tonight i need you to get ratchet for me)

'Cause i ain't in the mood for no good girl
I ain't go to no club for no good girl
I ain't tryna chill with no good girl

Tonight i ain't down for no good girl
I ain't tryna mess around with no good girl
I ain't tryna waste time with no good girl

[Bridge: Kirko Bangz]

Where the good girls, where the good girls at
That wanna be bad tonight
(that wanna be bad tonight)

Where the good girls, where the good girls at
That wanna be bad tonight
(that wanna be bad tonight)

Where the good girls on this side?
Where the good girls on this side?
Where the good girls on this side?

Where the good girls on this side?
Where the good girls on this side?
Where the good girls on this side?

I know you a good girl, good girl, good girl
I know you a good girl, good girl, good girl
I know you a good girl, good girl, good girl
But tonight i need you to be bad for me, yeah

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

'Cause i ain't in the mood for no good girl
I ain't go to no club for no good girl
I ain't tryna chill with no good girl

Tonight i ain't down for no good girl
I ain't tryna mess around with no good girl
I ain't tryna waste time with no good girl
