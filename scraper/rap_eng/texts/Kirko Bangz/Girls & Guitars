[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
I be that nigga from the east side
Put my dart up in your pussy, I don't need no prize
And you don't need those guys
These Versace shades I don't see those guys
I'm the reason that you left the guy
And I'll check the guy if he get outta line
And I ain't here to stress you out
I'm here to stretch it out, and I'mma make it mine
I can put you in the spotlight
I can put you I can put you in the limelight
Yeah, girl, tell me when the time right
That pussy cold I'mma hit it with my Klondike
Yeah and I just wanna fuck with you
Them other girls can't fuck with you
And that nigga he in love with you
But I just wanna bust it lose

[Hook x2: Kirko Bangz]
I love the way that you feel
I love the way that you talk
I love it cause you so trill
I love the way that you walk
I'm so in love with your style
And you been working so hard
So I'mma make my way to your crib
And let you play this guitar

[Verse 2: Tyga]
B-B-Back it up
I love it when your jeans show your panties, huh
And I'm grabbing on your waist cause I'm hard as fuck
Uh I don't want to waste time, we can take it slow
Couple overnights, couple x and o's
Now I gotta take a flight now you're back at home
Can't sleep at all, cause you alone
Ain't comfortable, you need me right there right there
I love how your booty's soft
Man, I really wanna take you down
And I love how she ride on top
Right after sex, and she wipe me off (true)
Man, I'm really loving you
Really wanna put my tongue in you
Ain't no telling what the tongue will do
Make the orgasm last longer than it's supposed to, man

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Say anything you want
Girl, you know that you can have it baby (have it, girl)
I got everything you need, you ain't even gotta ask me baby

[Outro]
Tell me what you want
