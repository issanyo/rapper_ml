Bitches all around me man I feel like I’m the man
Posted in my section, sipping liquor, popping bands
Bitches all around me man I feel like I’m the man
Posted in my section, sipping liquor, popping bands
My paint wet, her pussy wet, my ice wet
My neck wet, my wrist wet, your bitch wet
I’m in the crowd, I’m going hard, I’m talking shit
I’ll pull your card, I’ll take your broad, she make me rich
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I’m in the crowd, I’m going hard, I’m talking shit
I’ll pull your card, I’ll take your broad, she make me rich

[Verse 1]
Say, I got bitches all around me man I feel like I’m the man
Posted in my section, sipping liquor, popping bands
Got yo bitch in my pants
Posted up with my band
And all my niggas they play the flute and they'll blow your ass to Japan
I don’t fall in love with no fan, I just send her home to her man
She fuck with him to get bread, and she fuck with me to go HAM
I let niggas know I never been a hoe, I swear real shit from my glands
And if I want the bitch, I could take the bitch, but I rather sip on this Hen
These tattoos on my arms, tattoos on my hands
Got a paralyzed bitch talking ‘bout she’ll fuck me right where she stand
I’m ‘bout to cop me a foreign, ‘bout to cop me a Lamb
Gold chains like Raekwon and I’m paid in full, goddamn my paint

[Hook]
My paint wet, her pussy wet, my ice wet
My neck wet, my wrist wet, your bitch wet
I’m in the crowd, I’m going hard, I’m talking shit
I’ll pull your card, I’ll take your broad, she make me rich
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I’m in the crowd, I’m going hard, I’m talking shit
I’ll pull your card, I’ll take your broad, she make me rich

[Verse 2]
The champagne shower in the club, time to celebrate
‘Bout to cop that new 4-58, make ‘em really hate
Shorty wanna fuck a real nigga, yeah, that pussy leaking
Fuck her good, fuck up her household, now they ain’t even speaking
I’m so disrespectful, it should be a damn shame
I’m so disrespectful, put a hundred in a chain
And I’m so disrespectful, on this track with Kirko Bangz
Pull up beside you at the lights, disrespect your lane
My car fast, my bitches bad, my niggas thuggin’, smokin’ gas and blowin’ cash
And if you disrespect the mob, then it’s yo ass
Bitch, you done fucked too many rappers, so I’ll pass

[Hook]
My paint wet, her pussy wet, my ice wet
My neck wet, my wrist wet, your bitch wet
I’m in the crowd, I’m going hard, I’m talking shit
I’ll pull your card, I’ll take your broad, she make me rich
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I disrespect
I’m in the crowd, I’m going hard, I’m talking shit
I’ll pull your card, I’ll take your broad, she make me rich
