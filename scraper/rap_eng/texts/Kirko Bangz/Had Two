"You mind if I play something for you?"

[Bridge: Boston George]

Thought you was the only one
Even though she had two
Every time she bought you something
Even though she bought two
Shawty say she made you play
Even though she made two
Even though she came through
Even though is that you...

[HOOK: Kirko Bangz]

You ain't the only one nigga
I hate to break it to you
You ain't the only one nigga
Your bitch ain't faithful too you (No)

[Verse 1: Boston George]

Nigga you thought she had one
Even though she had two
Even though she fuck with me
The same time she fuck with you
Even though she fuck with lame niggas and dope boys too
Even though she roll swishas and hit leaks before school
You wouldn't think that she a freak
You wouldn't think that she'll speak
To a muhfuckin' nigga that sale dope and run the streets
Had her buying shit for you
Cos she was buying shit for me
While she ridin' home to you
She crying over me
You wouldn't think that she'll fuck
You might think that she in love
You wouldn't think that he was suckin' dick and fuckin' at the club
You might think that she at the crib takin' notes and writing books
Instead she in the hood talkin' shit and lighting up (Yeah)
You wouldn't think she know a G
You wouldn't think she like me
You wouldn't think she'd be in my Lambo suckin' the life off out of me
You wouldn't think that she a player
But the dick bring it out
Every time she fuck he tell me bout your plug and about your spark

[Bridge: Boston George]

Thought you was the only one
Even though she had two
Every time she bought you something
Even though she bought two
Shawty say she made you play
Even though she made two
Even though she came through
Even though is that you...

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

You ain't the only one nigga
I hate to break it to you
You ain't the only one nigga
Your bitch ain't faithful to you (No)

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]

Said, you ain't think she could do wrong
No she had two phones
Notice her perfume was so strong
Whenever she came home
I bet that you ain't know I was her cousin
Know I was her brother
Know I was her trainer
We do yoga at L.A Fitness every Monday
Go to church when she's with you
Strip clubs with me
She fantasize with you
She throw them horns with me
I'm like Hallelujah
Nigga ain't know there's two of us
Look at all the shit he do for us
We might as well stay together
Play 2K while she cook for us
I promise I won't beat the Heat
I keep the air on 73
And I'll put down the toilet seat
But this restroom for you and me
You don't wanna use the one upstairs
Because the sink is full of hair
You go with her to go do her nails
I stay at home and watch Dave Chappelle
I might think I don't need you
And you think you don't need me
But I know that she need you
In places she don't need me
Like hittin' the mall and holdin' hands
Doin' all the simple things
While I fuck her good
Talk to her bad
Do all the  real nigga things

[Bridge: Boston George]

Thought you was the only one
Even though she had two
Every time she bought you something
Even though she bought two
Shawty say she made you play
Even though she made two
Even though she came through
Even though is that you...

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

Is that you ain't the only one nigga
I hate to break it to you
You ain't the only one nigga
Your bitch ain't faithful to you (No)

[Kirko Bangz]

Said these girls so player
These girls so player
Said these girls so player
And these niggas need to stop acting so gay
Said these niggas need to stop acting so gay
Cos these girls only wanna fuck a nigga like me
And these girls gon' do anything that I say (I say)
