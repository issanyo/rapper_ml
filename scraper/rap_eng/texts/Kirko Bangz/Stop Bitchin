But now I ain't got time for ya
You could say I ain’t keep it real
My name everywhere, they waiting to make a sound for me
I’m deserving every bad thing that I will receive
But she, she got it out for me
She got it out for me
She got it out for me

I can’t blame her
Shit I did her wrong I can’t change her, but really I’m the nigga that changed her
And now this bitch got me so angry
Cause shit she now just how to get to me like nobody else
Like I ain’t gon let you see yo lil girl
See this shit get hard, everything ain't good right now
And I don’t even wanna be around
And she only wanna be around when the paper flowing out a nigga pocket, say she wanna get down
And I’m like girl won't you just take some time to get to know me
I know a lot of shit done changed but I’m the same old G
That you fell in love with
That you fell in love with
But now I’m a nigga you tell everybody you can’t fuck with
And niggas that I used to know telling you don’t fuck with
Better hope I don’t see that bitch ass nigga in public
Cause I’mma whoop him and every bitch nigga that he chill with
Better tell that boy stop bitchin'
Somebody tell that girl stop bitchin'
Somebody tell them niggas stop bitchin'
Stop stop bitchin'

And ever since a nigga came down and said hol up

Say, ever since a nigga came down and said hol up

But before a nigga came down and said hol up
I said hol up
I said hol up, I ain't have no one to fuck with me
