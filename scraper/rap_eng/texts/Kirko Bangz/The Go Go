[Intro:]
When Wyclef get Kingston I'm a pick up Kirko Bangz
We head out to dreams and turn up the scene

[Bridge:]
She wanna get her sex life straight
So she bought a pole and she put it in the middle of the bedroom
She pay a stripper every week
To come and give er lessons but she say she wanna be a freak

[Hook:]
For her man, for her man
She just wanna be a freak for her man
For her man, for her man
The things that a woman would do for her man

[Verse 1:]
Ladies if your man had a fantasy
Why did he dress you up like ebony? Aye
Stacks on yo back girl, stacks on yo back girl
Tell me what you let him do, stacks on yo back
Stacks on yo back girl, stacks on yo back girl
Tell me what you let him do, stat
We throwin stacks in the bedroom
I maybe love er for er clothes
The way he loving of the club

Kirko Banz, talk to her now

Shawty throwin racks in the club
Throwin stacks in the club, throw back in the club and I think
Shawty got a plan for me
Cause Shawty got her hands on me
And I know Shawty want this drink that I'm sippin on
She like the wheels that I'm tippin on
And I'm like Shawty won't you wind on me?
Say won't you come and grind on me?
Fuck with me Clef
