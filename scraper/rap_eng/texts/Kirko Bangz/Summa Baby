[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Girl you know you hotter than the summer
Girl you know you fire, let's burn down tonight
We fannin' all the flames when we turn up
It's too hot to stay inside, I drop the top off in my ride

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Summer's been gone too long, been waiting on it
Go in that sun dress, let me see your progress
Look how that ass done grown, aye
You makin' the temperature rise like June or July, ooh
That's the summer baby
Your body hot like 95 degrees and goin' up
In the summer baby, nah-nah-nah
No I don't see no issue when the sun hits you

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
Your body lookin' like you got a 10
Love how the sun's dancin' all over your skin
The way your body move it don't make no sense right now
We should roll one up and have the time of our lives

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

[Verse 3: Cam Wallace]
When I drop the top on the Porsche
Is when they fall down just like metamorphosis
Everything I say metaphorically
Everything you do I adore it
Body lookin' like some coke
Hangin' on it like a bow
Lamborghini through the coast
When I hit it she be singin' notes
Sweat drippin' off her body you heard me
I got a (?) she ready
I got the numbers and change
You know I came with some fetti
She wanna (?)
She wanna see this all around
She wanna know if I got it
I told her baby my money never running out
Then she run and tell her friends on me
I got the M's on me, pull up in Benz homie
No, I don't need no lighter cause this girl is on fire
We burnin' up in the heat forever but we risin'

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
That's the summer baby
Your body hot like 95 degrees and goin' up
In the summer baby, nah-nah-nah
No I don't see no issue when the sun hits you
