[Intro]
Yeah, yea, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
[?]
Naaaa naaa
Ohhh ohhh

[Chorus]
Na na na na
Na na na na
She calls me "Young Papi"
She likes [?]
She doesn't know nothing 'bout me I be
Riding downtown, with that top down
Yeah, baby this the remix
Young KB the reason ladies feeling happy

[Bridge]
Na na na na
Na na na na
She acting like I need her
But she don't see I wipe her from [?]
In that H Town
I came up and came down
Hold that Purp [?] the liter
It got me leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, hold up

[Verse 1]
I pull up outside
Yo girl on my right
I know she wants to leave by the look in her eyes
I'm feeling like Tony, got the world on my side
And he won't run up on me, cause he knows I get down
It's been so long since I met someone like you
And don't pour up one shot if [?]
I usually don't dance, but I'm dancing with you
Like, naaa naaaa

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ah, na na
Want to get down, cause you see what I'm about
I can show you to another side of H Town
And call my dog Sticky up and pull up to the house
Ah na na, take another shot
Ah na na, put that phone down
Ah na na, I don't know Spanish so I'm like "uh-hu, no no"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
