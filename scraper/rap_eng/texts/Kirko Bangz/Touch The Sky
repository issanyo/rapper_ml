I hold my head up just enough to see the skies
And when we go we won't go slow we'll put up such a fight
And you will be one day exactly what you are
Just keep your head held high
Kiss your fist and touch the sky

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of the rain, tired of the pain
Tired of being played
But never tired of the game
I tied up my shoes
Never lied. I'm the truth
Got feelings I don't express
Until I'm live in the booth
Nobody really cares about the shit I'm going through
Until I make a song about it
Then you're going through it too
You see they bring hate to you
Rap critics debating you
Until you hit home on some shit that they relating to
Then they're like "Damn man, that ni--a go hard b"
But last week you said that you was soft, going R&B
We live in a selfish world
Broke ni--as, wealthy girls
Ni--as turn sensitive
I blame it on that twitter shit
Ni--as supposed to be less talk more action
Instead of sitting on yo ass
And thinkin' 'bout the status
What happened to the soldiers?
The soul of the front line
Captain Kirk up in the sky
Man, you know I got mine

[Hook]
I hold my head up just enough to see the skies
And when we go we won't go slow we'll put up such a fight
And you will be one day exactly what you are
Just keep your head held high
Kiss your fist and touch the sky

[Verse 2]
I'll never slow down
I'm a come and go ni--a
They won't appreciate you
Till you dead and gone ni--a
I gotta reinvent myself
At times I prevent myself
From shinin' too hard on you ni--as
Gotta tint myself
I think about the life I live
And where a ni--a goin' to
Young Brett Farve
But I know who the fuck I'm throwin' to
You're chillin' in your 4-2
Play action force you to blitz
Man I'm goin deep, all in yo bitch
Ni--as cheap money talks
Speak up, I don't read lips
Got a list of people I don't fuck with
Leave 'em pissed, tryna block my shine
Puff Daddy in the eclipse
Steven Spielberg with the words I don't need scripts
You better stop 'em before he turn into a problem
Being real and this young is abnormal
With that being said, shit I'd probably be dead before I get to the top
Either way I touch the sky, ni--a

[Hook]
I hold my head up just enough to see the skies
And when we go we won't go slow we'll put up such a fight
And you will be one day exactly what you are
Just keep your head held high
Kiss your fist and touch the sky
