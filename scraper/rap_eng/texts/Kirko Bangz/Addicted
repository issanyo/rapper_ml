[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I'm addicted to money
I'm addicted to hoes
I'm addicted to cars
I'm addicted to clothes
Dripping ??
Sipping drink marijuana
I stick my dick all in your bitch then give her back, I don't want her
Shout out my dogs in the trenches
Free my boys in the pen
I live my life a balla hustla
I'ma shine to the end
I'm fuckin' these bitches and getting' these riches
Because I be pimpin' my pen
I got the slab on glass house
And got the foreign on ten

[Verse 1: Kirko]
Niggas wanna hate cause I got cake congratulate
Top down in LA but I still ride on Texas plates
Last night i lost like 20 Gs in a casino
I don't give a fuck, I make it right back with a feature
I'm so Houston Texas, I bought ? on the ?
My bed cost 15 Gs, bitch I ain't fuckin' on the floor
Diamond grills, poppin' seals, make it hard to feel yo
Fuckin' hoes, on these shows, that's how your nigga live
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, ? shades behind the ?
Pussy poppin' on my Gucci buckle while she ride my dick
Thugga told me, get your dough and shine on these hoes
I get plenty ? checks and I got hoes on the pole

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Everywhere you see me, you gon' see me with a bad bitch
I keep a pretty lady by my side, it's a habit
She say she a model, my bitch make her look average
Big bank rolls and bad hoes I gotta have it
Live life lavish
Pockets like I'm playing for them Rockets
Courtside with my niggas, tryna see if I'ma profit
Pull up, trunk knockin' ?
Step up out the car they like, damn can you smell that
I'm just being me, and being me is being real
Still roll old school Caddie bumper grill
Thugga still trill, keep my city on the map
Welcome to H-Town where them real niggas at
