*sample of SWV's "Downtown"*

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh
She ain't lookin' for love, she just lookin' for things
She just lookin' for a nigga that's chasin' his dreams
A youngin' she tell him how much she love him
And she know he gon' accept it cause
A nigga been thru some things
She cal around the city to see what he stackin'
What type of car he drive, what type of weight he packin'
Shit is he lame or is he cool, does he bang and is he rude
Does he claim to be in school, is he attending classes
Don't want a low life, she livin' that hoe life, she ain't got no life
But fuckin' and suckin' these niggas and livin' the poor life
Don't treat her poor light, don't give her no light
But we the reason when they loved us we ain't give them no life

[Hook]
That's not right, look how they changin' the game
And now these women want the money, cars, clothes and that fame
It's not right, but tell me who can you blame
When every nigga treat em' wrong and they mamas' the same
That's not right, look how they changin' the game
Look how these women want the money, cars, clothes and the fame
It's not right, but tell me who can you blame
When every nigga treat em' wrong and they mamas' the same
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Who gon' change the world, for that baby girl
In her stroller, when she get older, she could save the world
Her soul is so pure, it ain't made of pearls
And yeah that girl strippin' with somebody's baby girl
While her mama workin' hard to bring the food home
She out here workin' hard just to keep her phone on
So she won't get left behind, in the social battleground
We got the lower end, I want them better times
That 'let me walk you home from school' that was my favorite line
But now these 12 year old kids makin' babies now
By 18, she be doin' lines, and probly dead by age 25

[Hook]
That's not right, look how they changin' the game
And now these women want the money, cars, clothes and that fame
It's not right, but tell me who can you blame
When every nigga treat em' wrong and they mamas' the same
That's not right, look how they changin' the game
Look how these women want the money, cars, clothes and the fame
It's not right, but tell me who can you blame
When every nigga treat em' wrong and they mamas' the same
