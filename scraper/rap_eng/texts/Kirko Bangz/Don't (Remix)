[Verse 1: SoMo]
Don't play with her don't be dishonest
Still not understandin' this logic
I'm back and I'm better baby (oooh)
Don't
What you want, what you want
What you wanna know about girl
How I put it down, how I put it down, how I put it down
Don't you know that everything is bigger in the south
Don't you wanna lay back let me work it with my mouth
Make your heart go boom while you're sweating pour it out
Hold on tight girl I'll hold you down
Cause your so fye baby goals for days
I don't get tired cause she loves my ways
If I need love I can call all day
And if she needs love she can cum all day (yeahhh)
Oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
Girl
I keep on playing games
I ain't fucking you the same
And I'm creeping with your main home girl
I'm a player young nigga
These boys can't do the shit the way I did it
Young boss, big ships imma lay all in it
Imma stand up guy got my J's all in it (girl)
No he can't fuck you better than me
Last night you wrote a four page letter to me
I got you W-E-T effortlessly (woah yeah)
And everything slower in H-Town girl
I text him back for you, you lay down girl
(Hold up, young H-Town killer)

[Bridge: King Vory]
H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Ride paint and we sip 'til we fold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got a nigga so throwed

[Hook]
Don't
