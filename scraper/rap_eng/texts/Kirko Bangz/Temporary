[Intro:]
Oh yea

[Chorus:]
All these Hoes is so temporary
These Hoes are temporary
All these Hoes is so temporary
These Hoes are temporary [x4]

[Verse 1:]
You can’t trust these hoes, trust these Hoes
You can’t trust these niggas either cause they act like Hoes
If I ain’t know you last year I don’t fuck with you
Hit one more, put scissors
Bitch I cut you off too
Hold up
All these Hoes so temporary (x2)
You fuck with me in January
You don’t fuck with me in February
All these niggas so temporary
Niggas you temporary
Bitch you’re temporary
Everybody in this club temporary
And ya’ll scary
Hold up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yow, look
All these Hoes so temporary
All these bitches wanna bust
No you can’t come to the crib
I toss these Hoes at Kirko house
H Town, nigga keep it real
She like how I nigga work the wheel
When she catch feeling
Tell her with that curb
Don’t call me babe, bitch I hate that word
Cause you temporary
Hold up
Club Godzilla, he don’t love
He just fuck and he don’t ever trust
And he can touch you spot
But not in public
Cause

[Chorus:]
All these Hoes is so temporary [x2]
Don’t worry bout these haters man
I’m coming back, I’m keeping grades [x3]
All these Hoes they know my name
I’m coming back, I’m keeping grades
(Echoes keeping grades)
