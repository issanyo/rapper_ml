[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]

I gots to act real bad
Treat my bitch real good
And free my niggas up
And bring them back to the hood
And fuck the niggas mayne that put them up to no good
I will free my nigga Raw and bring him back
But sit it will only take
One Time One time one time
One time one time
They wanna see a nigga going down
Going down going down going down going down shi
And see these boys dont understand it when you coming down on candy
Because everybody want it but dont know how to plan it
Out of most of those that hoop you would be the most that be ready
Most niggas dont make because most nigga ain't ready
See the streets got them locked
Young niggas on the block
Walking around with a couple hundreds in they socks
I remember when niggas would used to compete to the top
Instead of selling they souls these niggas weak in they bocks
See when I pull up im candy painted
These niggas they animated
Im clean im phantomphated
These bitch contaminated
I know they all around for me haha
But the bitch getting down for me
Its like god ain't got time for me
He never picking up the line for me
But I got to hold it down for me
And everybody love the sound from me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kirko]

See ni say where will I be in about 10 years
I say I dont give a fuck as long as I ain't here
Kepp progressing my nigga

But its a blessing my nigga to be progressing my ni
So bring that hennessy to me
And give my niggas the weed
And girl you gotta be fucking with them before you fucking with me
And sh when you try to fucking with me
Ill be gone in my sleep
And its that plan I got to make for the east huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kirko]

See these boys can stand me
Hoes can't ban me
Girls fall in love because these hoes can't stand me
I used to brandy after school eating candy
Now im in the same builing with moesha and her family
You can't tell me I ain't real
Tell you how I feel
Making a million dollars off of my first record deal
Put my momma in some heels

Helped my sister through college thats trill

[Hook]
