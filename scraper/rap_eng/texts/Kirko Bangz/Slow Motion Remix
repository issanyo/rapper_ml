[Verse 1]
Lil country ass nigga from the eastside street
Give a fuck what you think about me
I been gone for a minute now a young nigga back
Better get your girlfriend away from me
And come back so strong tho aye
She throw it back so strong tho aye
I miss playing in her walls
Miss fucking in the bathroom stalls on the low low
I ain't tryna expose you
But girl you know you ain't loyal
My bad if I ignored you
I was just tryna get closer
Aye to the mufucking money
To the guap and the dough
Cause a bitch don't want a broke nigga no no
Girl it's been a long time but it's one thing for sure

[Hook]
Imma hit that ass in slow motion
Slow motion
Imma hit it right in slow motion
Slow motion
Imma get you right in slow motion
Slow motion
Imma hit that ass in slow motion
Slow motion
Imma get you right in slow motion

[Post-Hook x2]
Slow motion
Slow motion
Slow motion
Slow motion
Girl we got all day
Slow motion
Slow motion
Slow motion
Slow motion
Girl do what I say

[Verse 2]
I know you took a little break away from me
Cause lately I ain't been acting like me
I was in my own way
And I went the wrong way
I know you had a long day
Girl do what I say
Pull them panties to the side
Girl I'm tryna get inside
I ain't gon' lie to you
I ain't about to provide for you

[Hook + Post-Hook]

X2
Pull them panties to the side of you
I just wanna get inside of you
