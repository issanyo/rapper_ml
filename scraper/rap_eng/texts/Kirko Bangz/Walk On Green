[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I made that money, I bought me a team
A bad ass bitches, brought 'em all to the scene (Oh yeah)
I got that drank, I mix that lean
Then throw that money up, and then I walk on green (Oh yeah)
I walk on green (Oh yeah)
I walk on green (Oh yeah)
I pull up to the club just to walk on green (Oh yeah)
I walk on green (Oh yeah)
I walk on green (Oh yeah)
Them bitches fall in love when you walk on green (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Shooting dice with my niggas, Miami Vice with my niggas
I met a girl, that met a girl, that met a girl, that's wit it
I got phone numbers and pictures, room keys and bitches
All up in my pocket, no wallet cause shit
(Girl) I walk on green, I walk on green
And if she fuck me, she fuck my team
She too turned up, she on my lean
And you can call me PGA because I walk on green
Bitch moving my speed, jeans on all her clothes
Point guard on my team, bitch playing her role
Keep it real low-key, she ain't tryin' get known
I love a young bitch that be down to get the dough

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Kirko Bangz, Montana
Paid hundred bands for that stunt, I got purple drank in my cup
I just drank, smoke till I'm gone, tell 'em I'll be back next month
I just seen the game not played it, most of the time I was faded
I ain't ask who she came with, she just seen the ice then skate it
I'm just goin' HAM in that field, I'm just walking on that green
Throw about 20 grand in the air, told her walk up on that green
Talkin' pop that, blunt rolled, cup full, getting big
Started from a dollar, now I'm making M's
Walking on that green, started with dirty money
And walking off clean- suited
Sam Rothstein, zoota
Going off the lean, I be faded with my homie Kirk
Montana Coke Boyz, always Montana, always gonna work
