[Verse 1]
I know I love Rihanna
I wanna play with her monkey

Feed it bananas in public
Dont wear Banana Republic

I like the way she be talking like she ain't change for the money
I got her face on my wall
Wanna put my face in her walls
Wanna redecorate everything girl I love when they tall
So keep them heels on I'm real long

I'm the type to get you right

To wherever you come from cause I ain't never seen the islands
And girl I ain't gon' lie I ain't even ever seen Hawaii

And ride on me just the way they dance off in yo country
Or ride on me like we off in Texas in the country
And I don't really smoke but girl for you I turn a puff it
