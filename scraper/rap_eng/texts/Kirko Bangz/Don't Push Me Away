[Verse 1]
We're from 2 different places
2 different worlds
Sometimes I feel like im talking to
2 different girls
Cuz' one day you cool we be texting and shit
The next day you text me you stressing and shit
You be listening to your girl
Got your friend in the mix
But that ho ain't ever right like a bad journalist
Let that ash burn a bit
Yeah I'm back up on that piff
Hoping that that marijuana get me out of all of this
I don’t want no part of this
You got a nigga wondering would you still be calling me if I would had my own whip
I would never got in your car and you would of never said that shit
Out your ass had me thinking that you like my last chick
Girl you had me past whip
Had me goin to class, shit
Had me thinking I should go to church and meet the pastor
I just hope you understand
I ain't tryin' be your man
Well I am but
I just can't be the first to ask it
You told me write you a song
But I ain't imagine
You be gone when I did it
Dear ms Jackson ay

[Hook]
Baby don’t push me away
I was hopin' today I could rain all your troubles away
I say lately you’ve been on my mind baby all the time
And I just found the courage to say
Baby don’t push me away
I was hopin' today I could rain all your troubles away
I say lately you’ve been on my mind baby all the time
And I just found the courage to say ay

[Verse 2]
You got some issues that you need to deal with
I got mines but the issues that you got are in the areas I shine
And the issues that are mine are in the areas you glow
You got money all the time
Most of the time I be broke
You a achaedemic scholar I think school is a joke
If you ask me bring you water i'd probly bring you coke
I do the best that I could do
I'm me and you you
I got a dream I pursue and you got your dreams to
But I don’t think it would hurt if my life included you
And your life included me
In the future well see, ay

[Hook]
Baby don’t push me away
I was hopin' today I could rain all your troubles away
I say lately you’ve been on my mind baby all the time
And I just found the courage to say
Baby don’t push me away
I was hopin' today I could rain all your troubles away
I say lately you’ve been on my mind baby all the time
And I just found the courage to say ay
