[Intro]
Shit, I know it's fucked up
Sometimes it be like that though

[Verse 1]
Girls in the club, hands in the air
Hell yeah I like it when you do it like that
Ain't enough time in the day for the chatter
Any other time, any day it wouldn't matter
But girl right now, it's all about that action
Hit you with this down south thug satisfaction
You the type of girl nigga wouldn't let past him
But I'm the type of nigga let you walk right past him
Girls gon' react when they don't get a reaction
They wanna attach when you don't want no attachments
I'm the type of nigga step up to the plate
In the 9th inning when I'm throwed
Hit her with the thug passion
It's been a while, since you got ratchet
Cause yo nigga had you trapped in the house
Had the phone, you ain't even get to answer
Now every time he hit you, you don't never answer

[Hook]
You lil' baby, far from the average
Damn right, damn right (aye)
Pull up on you, you hot as Arizona
Burnin' up, tonight (aye)
Fuck with a nigga like me (like me)
Get drunk with a nigga like me (like me)
Let's have us a night to remember, girl, fuck that nigga
Yeah you and yo girls in the club
Thowin' back shots of the liquor
Y'all just wanna have a good time
So you screamin' out fuck that nigga
Yeah me and my dawgs posted up
You should come fuck with a nigga
Show a nigga some love, cause I'm fuckin' witcha

[Verse 2]
Girls in the club, hands in the air
Hell yeah I like it when you do it like that
Got a couple bitches and they hatin' in the back
Cause they don't really like it when you do it like that
But girl right now, don't you pay attention
To them hatin' bitches you got everything they missin'
You the type to make em wanna make a good impression
She the type to lose a nigga goin' to depression
Girls gon' react when they don't get a reaction
They wanna attach when you don't want no attachments
I'm the type of nigga step up in the place, girl
How you feelin' are you thowed
I can tell the way you dancin' it's been a while
Since you got nasty, cause yo nigga had you trapped in the house
Had them clothes you ain't even get to wear, shit
Now every time he hit you, you don't never answer

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Let it go go go go go girl (let it go)
Let it go go go go go girl (let it go)
Let it go go go go go girl (let it go)
Let it go go go go go girl (let it go)

[Hook]
