Young nigga with a mind of his own
He the man of the house but he 15 years old
Gotta plan to get out but he ain't got nowhere to go
Hanging with the old heads cause they tell him he can roll
They don't see him as a man, they see him as lil bro
He don't see them as his friends, he see them as big bros
So whatever they tell him, he will it do for show
He doing dirt he'd never do if his daddy was home
But see his mama dating woman now, got her son tripping out
He donâ€™t even wanna come home with all his niggas now
He embarrassed but it's buried in his soul
When they wonder why he snapping all the time slamming doors
Calling his sister a ho, she tell him listen lil bro
Mama thinkin' cause she gay that you dont love her no more
Say I never asked for the life she shows
I hope I get a little piece around here when I go

Hook
Go to sleep having million dollar dreams
That's something you can't take away from me
Go to sleep havin million dollar dreams
That's something you can't take away from me
You can't take away from me

Yeah, he gettin' older, mind gettin' bolder
He divising them plans so his pockets get swoll up
Gun holder, never need a holster
He don't shoot for fun, he don't never need a poster
Call his home boys up and tell them that it's over
Them niggas done tried him for the last time, rolling
On his enemies, for this winner cheese
And they tell him need a gun but he just put it in his jeans
Young soldier, about to grow up
Knowing that he should throw the gun when the cops show up
But he got pride shit, too much pride to take it up out his pocket
And not pop shit, so he popped one, popped two
And pop again whenever the cops came through
Next thing you know he was sitting in the cell
Eyes closed, saying this shit to himself

Hook
Go to sleep having million dollar dreams
That's something you can't take away from me
Go to sleep having million dollar dreams
That's something you can't take away from me
You can't take away from me

When he was locked, the whole fam tried to talk to him
Told people he was innocent and vouched for him
They went to visit, he ain't even come out for them
Never wrote them back, and they never got a call from him
And after that they was still feeling sorry for them
His mama was a wishful thinker so she bought a car for him
She would cry every day pray to god
She thinking it's her fault cause it was her gun that he pulled
She can't blame herself, he don't blame himself
He blames her for keeping him from his famous self
He figured that he would be playing for the Bulls
Vacation with the fam on a beach playing pool
A year later his mama was at the store
When a drunk man came and gunned her to the floor
She died instantly like it was meant to be
And home boy was getting out the pen 10 in a week

Yeah, see we all got million dollar dream
For that, we tend to forget about the people who love us the most
You know what I'm saying?
Can't forget your fam, can't forget your friends on your road to glory
Cause as easy as god put them in your life, they could be gone
