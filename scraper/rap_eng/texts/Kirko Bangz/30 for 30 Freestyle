Monday night in Eugene I'm with the whole team
Fantasizing 'bout running off with the whole game
I've been too busy just to talk 'bout niggas, you keeping
Busy cause you talking 'bout niggas, I know the whole thang
I got goals that's way harder than gold chains, I got soul
I wasn't brought up with no pain, I was the nigga that was
Never supposed to be nothin', so when i turn into somethin'
They like "Bro changed"
Them lonely nights you made no change, you thinking about
Every decision that you should of made
You got regrets, like you used your last chance
You only 26, but you feelin' like a old man
It ain't your fault that you started early, but fuck them
Niggas, I just wish you'd tell em' no and don't help them niggas
I just wish you could be all you can be
Pull up to the all you can eat, and be a selfish nigga
No one ever talks about the helper nigga
You eat your dinner with the poor, respect the wealthy nigga
The nigga you eat dinner with is too accessible
Even though he successful, you still gonna respect the other
Nigga
I could break it down more if it apply to ya
But every quote is more reposted than applied to ya
You rather repost, than post it to ya life, worryin' bout likes
When ya momma right here crying to ya
They give us information late, but you think it's new
They teaching us their evil ways, but you think it's school
And blurred lines between being thirsty and complementin'
The world love when you insecure, I'm a cocky nigga
And shit, we talk about the cops when we doing more
Turn on your televison all they promoting is whores
Turn on your television all they promoting is hate
Retweeting and fighting, be we promoting the hatred
Uh, I ain't a preacher, but I got beliefs on
Gun control and the world and the blind can see
They we are getting used to seeing this crazy shit
And babies growing up without daddies is the way to
Be
And this a warning shot for any nigga talking greezy
Hang it up, don't make this yellow nigga Mona Lis-ya, and
People turning they back on me is all i needed
Truth is, I never felt more undefeated, shit get scary
When niggas realize they worth, I'm searching for God
But I don't think I'm gone find him in church
You searching for love, but dont think you gone find it in
Kirk
Shit my intentions are good, but my heart doesn't work
How the nigga with all the love got no love to give? The
Young boy got more will than uncle Phil, It's fucked up
When you lose more than you gain in this game
And they talking behind your back while you front the bill
Yeah too many dreams getting killed, too many niggas making it over niggas that's great for real, too many niggas out here thinking that them boys killing me, I'ma eat all them niggas for lunch, then feed they boys to the streets, ain't no more Mr. Niceguy shit, and everybody eats, You've been a student of my style, I just never really wanted to teach
Tired of all these new niggas saying what the city needs, and i'm tired of seeing new bitches saying what they see in me
And lately, I've been feeling like I want a child, girl or boy
But I don't ever think I will find a girl for it
They say the good things will come to you, boy you gotta wait
The restaurant just closed and I still got a empty plate
