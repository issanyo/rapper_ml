[Intro: Kirko Bangz]
Tonight it's going down, you know this
Oh yes it is
'Cause I don't really do this
Oh no

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Tonight it's going down, you know this girl
'Cause I don't really do this
But tonight I'm on some new shit
Put your phone down and focus girl
And keep your eyes on me
All I wanna do is go first
Oh yes I do
All I wanna do is go first

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Don't get it twisted baby girl, I'm still a player
But you did this time for me so I'ma change it up
Now it's 3:45 in the morning
I'm still sippin' on this Hennessy, I want it
Gotta let me go first
I'm goin' down, down, down, down, down
Oh, gotta let me go first
I'm goin' down, down, down, down, down
I tie your hands to the bed
While I get your ass on me
And girl don't you get used to this
I'm a player and I don't do this shit

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Tonight it's going down, you know this girl
'Cause I don't really do this
But tonight I'm on some new shit
Put your phone down and focus girl
And keep your eyes on me
All I wanna do is go first (all I wanna do is go)
Oh yes I do
All I wanna do is go first (all I wanna do is go)

[Verse 2: Ye Ali]
You may have had her once (may have had her once)
But I got her all the time (she mine)
Little Puerto Rican ting (Puerto Rican)
Got her down in H-Town (H-Town)
Got me kissin' on her thighs (kissin', kissin')
Lickin' on her waistline (lickin', lickin')
And we never see each other (never see each other)
Girl, we gotta FaceTime
You a ruby, you a gem, these hoes fake diamonds
In the bed you say you love me, girl you ain't lyin'
You can tell I love you, ain't it obvious?
Now come over and just ride this dick

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Tonight it's going down, you know this girl
'Cause I don't really do this
But tonight I'm on some new shit
Put your phone down and focus girl
And keep your eyes on me
All I wanna do is go first (all I wanna do is go)
Oh yes I do
All I wanna do is go first (all I wanna do is go)
