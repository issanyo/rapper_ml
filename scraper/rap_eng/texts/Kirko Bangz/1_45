[Chorus:]
Baby what's your name can I take you home?
I'm gone off the brown tryna get you alone
It's 1:45 in the morning
It's 1:45 in the morning
I'm gone off the brown and I want it
It's 1:45 in the morning

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Ima break you down Ima break you down
And we can pull off on the down low take them panties off let it all go
I don't even know what's happening
Bend it over bust a split on this dick
Girl I'm tryna lick your body up let's do it on your mama furniture
Can I please come over yeah and lay you down
I might sound a little thirsty yeah but I don't give a damn

[Chorus:]
Cause it's 1:45 in the morning
It's 1:45 in the morning
I'm gone off the brown and I want it
It's 1:45 in the morning

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
I know you know my name (Jacquees)
And baby around this time I don't play no games
Give you the blunt and let you light it
I know it's a been a while since a nigga done been inside it
I keep you wet keep you excited
Put you on shit you never did before
He ain't like me pulling up outside black tint on the black Jeep
Take you through the back streets fuck you in the backseat
It's 1:45 I'll be done by 2:50

[Chorus:]
It's 1:45 in the morning
It's 1:45 in the morning
I'm gone off the brown and I want it
It's 1:45 in the morning
