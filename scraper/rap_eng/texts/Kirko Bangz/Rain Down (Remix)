Rain down girl
Rain down girl
Tonight I got time to make it all better
Tonight I got time to make it all wetter
Rain down girl, baby won't you let me
Rain down girl, rain down baby
Tonight I got time to make it all better
Tonight I got time to make it all wetter

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
You say "Fuck me like you love me and how this feel?" and I say "Lovely"
Sign say "Caution slippery when wet," say you want it all so that's what you gon' get
Turn up, bedroom burn up, rain down 'til you make the whole room flood up
Keep rocking and drip dropping, we ain't stopping 'til you get through
Gimme all your precipitation
Bring your girl for participation
I'll lay you down 'til your leverage breaking
But I won't be evacuating
And I think it's ironic, she say her name Katrina
I say I'm from the NOLA, a survivor hope you know I need it all
Hard headed I come up on that G shit
But when it comes to that G spot, it's no secret that I can make you

Rain down girl
Rain down girl
Tonight I got time to make it all better
Tonight I got time to make it all wetter
Rain down girl, baby won't you let me
Rain down girl, rain down baby
Tonight I got time to make it all better
Tonight I got time to make it all wetter

[Bridge: Kirko Bangz]
She wanna fuck me with the lights on, she's gone she told me my baby
She wanna take a little ride on top, don't stop no seat belts baby
I'mma take my time and kiss your neck down to your waist
And if I go a little lower best believe we gon' rain on these sheets my babe
Drip dropping baby, can't stop it baby
You wanna use yo hand, I'mma watch you baby
We in the lobby baby, they watching baby
You could take your time cause I got you baby
On the phone right now, I can't speed it up, can't speed it up
But I can lick you down or I can beat it up
Girls hit my phone, girls hit my phone, they all wanna be that one
They won't leave me alone cause they know I can make it

[Hook]
Rain down girl

Tonight I got time to make it all better

Rain down girl, rain down baby
Tonight I got time to make it all better
Tonight I got time to make it all wetter
