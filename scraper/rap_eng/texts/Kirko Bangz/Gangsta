[Verse 1]
Ain't scared to say im falling for ya
Cause im a real nigga and im a little crazy
I know you notice that
Riding with that pistol on me
To keep it cool and na you can't touch a girl
I ain't into that
Just know that I got it girl if you ever need me
These hoes heard about you girl now they mad at me
My homeboys tell me I shouldn't take you out
And your homegirls tell you that you gone take a loss
But as soon as I get you I tell everyone im witchu
Cause im gangsta as soon as I got you
Ima tell the world about you cause im gangsta

[Hook]
And thats all I can give you
All I can give you all I can give you
All I can give you
As soon as I get you ima tell the world im witchu
Cause im gangsta

[Verse 2]
I keep that ratchet
It's laying right next to me when we on the mattress
Girl I hold your hand whenever
Ain't ashamed to let them know
And I'll hold your bag whenever you trying on new clothes
She say you think this pretty?
And I say hell no but shit if you like it get it
In love with your body
Them heads is mighty fitting
But more in love with your mind girl
We should start us a business

[Pre-Hook]
Cause as soon I get you
I tell everyone im witchu cause im gangsta
As soon as I got you ima tell the world about you
Cause Im gangsta

[Hook]
And thats all I can give you
All I can give you all I can give you
All I can give you
As soon as I get you ima tell the world im witchu
Cause im gangsta

Gangster Love
