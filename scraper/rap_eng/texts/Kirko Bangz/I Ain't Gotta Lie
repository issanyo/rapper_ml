[Intro]
Fuck you thought it was boy?
Eastside shit nigga
1 up

[Verse 1]
Mobbin' in the two door
Looking like the new Hov
Pockets on fat Albert
Last name pull hoes
So many groupie bitches in the condo it's a group home
And these niggas acting like they Jordan when they Luc Long
Forgiato two tone
Pour me out I'm too strong
Slanging hard wood not the type of shit you hoop on
Super Bowl flows but I still get my Manute on
Young JJ Redick boy don't make me get my Duke on
Ha boy I been out here too long
Young boss nigga I'm at V Live with a suite on
Drinking smart water with a fruit bowl
Boy I got old ventures with yo new ho

[Hook]
I'm tired of these niggas
No I'm not a killer but I gotta pull the trigger
Put a end to your lives my nigga and in the end only would a true survive nigga
I ain't gotta lie, lie
Nigga I ain't gotta lie, lie
I ain't gotta lie to these bitches
I ain't gotta lie, I ain't gotta lie

[Verse 2]
Young nigga established
Closest full of ballast
Golf course clean today I'm pulling out the caddy
24 years old and still got grudges with my daddy
That's some shit I can't get over like I caught a flat in traffic
My fan base expanding, doing shows in Spanish
Married women going nuts, her husband last name Planters
I upgraded my standards, I ain't fucking no more dancers
And all my whips tinted like the master went camping
Lacks to the floor I been planing shit
Niggas better react to the flow I'm the man this year
And I'mma fuck yo girlfriend again this year
And every nigga that was hating he a fan this year

[Hook]
I'm tired of these niggas
No I'm not a killer but I gotta pull the trigger
Put a end to your lives my nigga and in the end only would a true survive nigga
I ain't gotta lie, lie
Nigga I ain't gotta lie, lie
I ain't gotta lie to these bitches
I ain't gotta lie, I ain't gotta lie
