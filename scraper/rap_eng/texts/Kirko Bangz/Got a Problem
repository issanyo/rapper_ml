[Verse 1: Propain]
Yo, when I started out, you never gave me shit
But I was trying to survive on the grind for days till it made me sick
Niggas hating on me, talking down they used to make me quit
Nowadays when they call a nigga phone
Try to get me on they song, gotta pay me bitch
I ride round on a mission daily
Tryna get the paper gotta feed my grinds
Bun B told me young its tough, but when you coming up they wanna see you down
Down here they don’t give a fuck about you
No love partner, its a dirty game
Just cos Rico killed Calvin
That don’t mean a nigga won’t merk ya mayne
Seen foul shit when niggas hurt for change
Watch ya back with these lying hoes
If you got a ho when you a shining bro
Then she gonna ride with a nigga who be shining more
She'll only love you when you buy her a stone
Yeah, they wanna fuck you when you diamonds glow
It's the same shine that'll blind ya soul
When you stop all that other shit they around it goes
And I lost a partner
He alive well not to Pro
I go ape shit, one monkey never gonna stop the show
Twin told me gotta watch your foes!
Nigga take from me I went and got some more
With just to let em' picture me rolling
I make the album cover with a drop and fold
Got the club popping while we popping rolls
Got your girl bopping trying to drop her clothes
All my niggas paid and my mama straight
Think I give a fuck bout that gossip ho?
Cause these haters hate & they no stopping
Fuck’em all I made mo profit
Didn't understand when I was broke big-e
But money really bring mo problems

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I got a problem
Too much money, too many cars, got too many bitches
Too many cribs that I ain't even got enough time to live in
I got a problem, got too much heart, got too much soul
Got too much love, I show to much and mayne I never get enough of
I got a problem, I see these niggas hating on me
They at the bottom and they waiting on me
I pray to God I can make a way, give my sister a crib
Put my brother on the lake, & all of my enemies fade away
I got a problem

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I know so many wanna see me fall
I make the motherfuckers suffer when they see me ball
See me in that big bent like fuck’em all
You ain't gotta fuck with me cause I don’t fuck with y'all
Crab ass niggas, snake ass niggas
Say they real but they just a bunch of fake niggas
My mistake niggas, thought you was one hunned
I take that loss bitch I’m a boss
But I learn from it
They tired of seeing me stunting, want me to fall off
They like me better broke & fucked up on that nawf
But bitch I’m still climbing
Ain't sold none of my diamonds
Still dropping all these cars I rap about, & all these bars
Still pull Ménage à trois, with the baddest broads
Like I dreamed it, it’s hogg life for life and I mean it
I see these niggas hating, wait for me to fall
It's 15 years later, hater’s I’m still standing tall!
