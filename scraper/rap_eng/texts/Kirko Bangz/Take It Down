[Hook]

You lookin like the type
Know just how to move it
Don't be so uptight, ain't no need for choosing
Gon' take it down for a nigga like me
And I'mma turn you out baby girl before we leave here
Drop it to the floor, let me see you lose it
Get into the music, why you sittin clueless
Gon' take it down for a nigga like me
And I'mma turn you out baby girl before we leave here yea

[Kid Ink - Verse 1]

Look around, and I can spot you through the crowd
It's gotta be a catch the way youu throw it out
And take it down, like u copywritten
Them other pussies copycattin' ain't nobody killin'
With u babe, all the games you play
Stop that, and come and give me sugar like Kool-aid
Up all night, its never too late
Just wanna lock that pussy down like boozay
Uh, they say who's he, young nigga with the money tree
Bouquet, tryna throw it all over your bootay
That body on fire, soufle
And them lips is looking soup made

[Hook]

[Kirko Bangz - Verse 2]

Uh, sipping on that pimp juice
Money in my pocket tell me whats new
Had dreams of that bentley coup
Til' I copped it now my hood know im the nigga who
Gotta lotta money, gotta lotta things, grip alot of grain I know
They talking now, but im walking round, with a double cup and im gone
Say why you so uptight, girl you just my type
And I might be that nigga, but only for tonight
Now shawty break it down for me
Shawty take it down, lay it down for a g
And I might give her anything that she want from me
As long as she get down take it real low for me

[Hook]
