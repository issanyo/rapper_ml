[Intro]

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
I met this bitch at da kappa
She was finding a hole
Had my camera on that pussy
She was riding my nose
Smoking weed with my niggas
Sipping drink with her sister
I ain't seen her since the night I had to pull out my pistol
Wine berry on gold
Suck my dick with her soul
And the crazy thing about it, she was 20 years old
Ass hang out her draws
Gave me head at the mall
And put my weed in her pussy
When I got stopped by the law

[Hook]
I met this bitch at da kappa
Met this bitch at da kappa
Kap-kap-kap, met this bitch at da kappa
I met this bitch at da kappa
Met this bitch at da kappa
Kap-kap-kap, met this bitch at da kappa

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
I met this bitch at da kappa
She used to fuck Lil Flip
So now im jammin all his music, so she know I don’t trip
Two gold teeth in her mouth
Say she come from the south
Say Lil Keke used to rap right down the street from her house
Tattoo by her pussy, fuck her slow make it gushy
Put that pussy on my dick and let me know when to push it
Tryna fuck in the club cause bitches showing me love
I hit it raw in the club and I’m on too many drugs

[Hook]
