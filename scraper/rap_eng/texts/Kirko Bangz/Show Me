[TRANSCRIPTION IN PROGRESS]
[Intro]
Aye
Oh yeah
You gotta..
Show me

You remind me of a girl i know
But I ain't gon' say no names
No no no no
You could be on the stage, on the pole
But you a smart girl
Yeah you know you worth much more
You don't depend on a nigga
You got ya' own shit ooh thats for sure
But i'm a different type of nigga
I ain't spending money
I ain't spending time
Girl i gotta go on to the next bitch
Girl you ain't a bitch but girl i'm from texas
Thats how we spit
Don't you be correctin'
You know I'm fucked up
I need you caressing a nigga, lets go
A rich ass nigga, moved to the south side
And you ain't coming to my crib unless ya' mouth wide
And ya' panties gone, or not
I ain't a rock band but you gon' fall out
With your boyfriend, cause you can't call out
29 floors up, baby thats a long ride
I figure thats enough time for you to fake him out
I figure thats enough time for you to think about
Are you gon' do it real sloppy or give simple head
Give it to me on the balcony or in the bed
My living room full of rap stars on the wall
And all my ceilings in the pent 10 feet tall
I get my hair cut [?] downtown
And get my dick sucked looking over george brown
The vision nigga, look what i envisioned nigga
Golf course across the street for the richer niggas
I couldn't draw a better pictur with DaVinci nigga
Pull up to the crib, valet like i miss you nigga
Walk in you guarenteed to see bitches nigga
And i guarentee they all drive bentlys nigga
Me and slim thug neighbors, we be switching bitches
Me and slim thug players, we dont treat the bitches
And every friday I hit thee lounge downstairs
Shit be looking like an old bitch christmas nigga

I'm the man, no lie
Crib so high i feel close to the gods
