[Hook]
This is how I do it when I swang thru' my city
This is how I do it when I swang thru' my city
I do it for the north side the east side
The south and I can't forget the west side
Say that we rollin on choppaz ( chop chop chop chop ima keep on chopping )
And we ain't trippin' keep it pimping for them rappers
Long as my city rolling with me who gon' stop us, H-Town

[Verse 1 ]
I swang thru the parking lot
Swang know what im talking about
Rolling on the big wheels
Your tires look like polka dots
Mines look like Botox
Pop the trunk the show stop
You the type to cock block while I create a road block
Suicidal doors on the whip would knock ya tooth out
Have you somersaulting like Cheryl James when schools out
Baby this is my year
Im who you should know about
Peeling thru the streets my car in curious george mouth
Hailing from the east and on the beats im a beast
A lyrical caterpillar ill be flying in a week
And ain't no ice up in my drink, I got the code dont need the key
Im on the road like butter yeah they can't believe its me

[Hook]

[Verse 2 ]
Part of a hustler, mind of a G
H-town trouble maker, spine at her ease
Im the backbone, that all black on
We're respecting and protecting like I got the strap ons
But I never had a gun and I never had a pistol
But I still drop bombs im the shit for a missile on the pearl harbor nigga
Ill be working harder than a mexican in august paying for his daughters quincea√±era
I don't want them folgers money, just give me them starbucks nigga
Cop a coupe and call it Chris Brown, how its crawling nigga crawling nigga
Through the streets like a centipede.. ( nice be killing me )
But through it all, i stood tall and im still a G

[Hook]
