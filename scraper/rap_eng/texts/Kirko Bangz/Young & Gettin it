Young and I'm gettin' it, young and I'm gettin' it
Young and I'm gettin' it, I'm just young and I give a shit
I just want the money, and I've been keeping bitches
'Cause I'm young and I'm gettin' it, I'm young and I'm gettin' it

Hook:
Okay, I wake up in the morning
And I see dollars sign face
Shawty wanna rolling, I'm like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my automor on shine
So why you hating on me huh, I'm just living my life
Young and I'm gettin' it, young and I'm gettin' it
Young and I'm gettin' it, I'm just young and I give a shit

'Cause I'm young and I'm gettin' it, I'm young and I'm gettin' it
