[Verse 1]
See most woman gonna fall for the type of nigga that they daddy told them they shouldn't fall for, we all get it
So instead of blaming me for all my falls I'm just karma for the nigga your pops was we all niggas
Mamas saving pictures of me in her phone like : "baby girl the nigga you lovin' should be your other nigga
And that nigga your calling your other nigga really the nigga you lovin but I know his picturas fuckin withcha. "
These little girls scared of being single woman and these single woman wish they was little girls in mamas kitchen
Standin on your favorite chair helping do the dishes
Instead of makin new decisions like a new religion
And every person that you ever gave your heart to found a easy way to depart you, we all feel it
And people fighting for careers instead of love and the people the only thing that people congratulate for quiten
You do the math and you tell me what you come up with?
The realist woman be the worst ones to cuddle with
Cause when they with you they tell you how much they hate you but when they away from you they do anything to spend a day with you
Know that she gon' fuck with you and know she gon wait for you and every time you see her you fuck her and she gon say to you
I don't need you, I don't need you, but I pray for you
In love with you potential, fed up with the thought of changing you


[Hook]
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you




[Verse 2]
Uhhh, I'm breakin hearts changing girls like I change cars
And livin like I'm 17 when I'm 24
See I done had a couple queens with the crown royal
I played it off but everyone I lost hit the core
I thought the gun and the bullets couldn't pick the war
I had a shot couldn't pull it I had to divorce
And if you called up every girl with a heart that I broke and told them they could all shoot me once I wouldn't hit the floor
Its cause they love me and they know that one day I'll be more
That thought alone made me think I don't need to do more
That thought is scary just to know I don't have to compete
I can't remember the last time it took a week
I can't remember the last time I had to take a girl on a date cause she demanded that respect from me
I'd rather be that nigga that you know that you don't need, cause if I give you all of me then you gon find another me

[Hook]
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you

I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I still want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I, but I love you

I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you
