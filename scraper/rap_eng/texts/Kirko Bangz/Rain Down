Rain down girl

Tonight I got time to make it all better
Tonight I got time to make it all wetter
Rain down girl, baby won't you let it flow
Rain down girl, rain down baby

Ooh, I got you, rain down

Let a H-town nigga get it right girl
Girl I just wanna know

And I don't mind going down low if that's what it's gon' to take ya body rain

In the backseat with yo face down girl
Gotta put it down
