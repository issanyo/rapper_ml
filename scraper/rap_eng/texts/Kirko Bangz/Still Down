Are you down, down, down, down?
Are you down, down, down?
Are you down?
Are you down, down, down, down, down?
Are you down, down, down, down?

[Verse 1]
I've been in these streets, but tonight’s the night
You've been waitin’ all week for me to do you right
I know you got some stress built up
Sit down and let me fill your cup
I love when you get on that Henny
I can (?)
These magnums, I got plenty
That pussy taste like (?)
And I'ma make your star burst
For all the times I made your heart burst
Hold on, hope I didn't take too long
Tonight is for you, for you, for you, for you
I'm a young playa from the 713
Your new nigga can't do shit like me
I'ma pull up with the (?) tonight, tonight, tonight

[Hook]
Are you down, down, down, down?
Are you still down, down, down?
Are you still down?
Are you down?
Are you down, down, down?
Tell me are you down?
Are you down, down, down, down?

[Verse 2]
I'll call you at work
You see my name? Baller alert
But I promise
You the only
Fuck them hoes
You my best friend, my homie
Cause right when I was broke and had nothin'
You knew that a young nigga was somethin'
I thought you cared, girl you swore that you loved me
Now you only need your mountain of money
I got 21 questions like
Who could do you better? Yeah
I pick you up from Texas, yeah
Girl you know what I'm expectin', yeah
Are you still down, down, down, down?
Hit your line when I'm in town now
Turn your frown upside down now
Fuck a 9 to 5, let's 69 now

[Hook]
Are you down, down, down, down?
Are you still down, down, down?
Are you still down?
Are you down?
Are you down, down, down?
Tell me are you down?
Are you down, down, down, down?
