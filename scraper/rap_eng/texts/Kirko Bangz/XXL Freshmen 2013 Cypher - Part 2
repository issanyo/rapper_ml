[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Say what I'm supposed to say this time
Okay I got it, shit
I done came down hold up
I say roll up, she say my dick nasty
I wrap it with a fruit roll up
My nigga I'm a soldier
I'm lil mama's soldier
Riding for all my dogs
Riding for all my niggas I'm dirty just like a hog
I got to cameras in my face I got the paparazzi
Niggas looking at me jewels hanging like a fucking Nazi
Uh, how you do it how you rap on that auto tune
How you rap and do that auto tune
I'm that fucking dude
I do this shit I got money up all up in my pockets
Money in my roof I'm from the H-town like a fucking rocket
I should have used my last flow but now I'm getting better
I'm getting cheddar I ain't a rat dog you master Shredder
I'm more D'angelo when I be singing on hoes
When I be singing it's that young nigga, straight Kirko
Coming from the east, of the motherfucking streets
I got hoes like dogs see them hoes on my leash
Yeah she sucking on me like a flea but I don't have a flea
I got a fleece on when it's cold nigga that's for me
Yeah coming down styling yeah I'm coming down wildin
Could have put me in a jungle do this shit for my uncle
Do this shit for my brother and this shit for my sister
God damn, do my thing man
Do my thing uh

[Verse 2: Trinidad Jame$]
Ha, ha ha
I said god, please forgive our sins
Cause what we're about to say might go against the good book
It's a shame what rappers got to do
Ha, for a good look
How you heard a nigga that decepted all his flows
He do it for the fame and I do it for the cause
I didn't ask for it nigga nigga I was chose
Put a lot up in my blunt and them blessings in the sky
I put my mama first and keep a smile up on her eyes
So call me what you want but a fuck nigga I'll never be
I went to hustling in the streets to XXL with my G's bitch
Ha

[Verse 3: ScHoolBoy Q]
My enemies know whats popping, you get it they know what's popping
Heat, get it when shots get knocking reloaded and taking shots
And he loaded and taking shots at least hollow man be my top 10
Spray a goon and a goblin in shirt maroon
Put my white tee a crip musician what I might be
Ammunition more than likely
More hollow shells in the lobby
Left his ass to an IV
And left my feeling to a body
As mommy cried from the hommie
See it clear as Dasani I got the streets all behind me
Got these coppers behind me this copper flying then find him
Sirens gon need a siren the paramedics done got him
Seen whats clear fore they clear
See a gangsta when I see a mirror
Where you from? then hell appears
K bullet hit like a spear
Hit the chest than exit your rear
Like "damn I never jam"
He smoke quick as a gram
You niggas soft as a lamb
We G ride in Sedans
We blam soon as you glance
Money murder our plans
Kill your home and your fam
Rata-tatat-tata-tatat it's like that
Uh yeah
