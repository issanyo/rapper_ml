[Intro]
Tonight, let's stay in this room
Me and you, and this Patr√≤n
Just us three, all alone
Girl you ain't gotta go home, no, no
You ready to rock and roll baby?

[Hook]
Let me see all your body, let me see it girl
Take off all your clothes, take em' off girl
Don't be shy when I'm watching (You don't gotta be shy)
I make you comfortable baby
Drop it low girl
Go on and work your body like you on a pole, girl
Yeah, I know you ain't a stripper, but
Tonight you goin' get it
Be my stripper, Imma tip ya if you with it


[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Kirko
Take your clothes off, baby take your clothes off
Put it on a nigga, pop that pussy til I dose off
Put it on some R Kelly baby or some Ginuwine
Put it on some Jodeci, while I'm kissing your pantie line
Girl I play the lotto for you, I get all these dollars for you
Spend all my dollars on you, then go back to college for you
I'm in the strip club every damn night
But I don't need the strip club tonight
Pullin' on my peter, got your hand all on my heater
Girl, watch out for that Chiquita
You don't want more than margarita's
Anyday I do a stripper, that's why I'm rockin' Adidas
Girl that ass should got Professor Klump, and my pockets on Cletus
Anytime, just let me know
Anytime, just let me know
Let me know your schedule
Let me know your schedule
So you can..

[Hook]
