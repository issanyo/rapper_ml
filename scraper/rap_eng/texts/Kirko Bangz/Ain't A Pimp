[Intro;]
I ain't a pimp but she should make these niggas pay for it

[Verse 1:]
Now I ain't talking about the pussy talking about your time
These niggas don't compliment your shine
Wanna take you on a date make him pay what he weigh
And nothing 300 dollars thats a high school thing
They try to get you in the club for a bottle of liquor
You don't need to be seen with no lame ass nigga
And the next thing you know he trying to take that picture
Man all these niggas starting to act like bitches
And tell a nigga to book you if he want to be with you
You giving niggas promotion and you don't see the issue
You bringing your value down baby girl I don't get you
But if you fuck around with me I'll show your ass how to get it
Turn going out into a profitable living
Make them pay you by the second by the hour or minute
You need to find you a nigga thats gon polish your vision
Instead of hanging with these niggas out here hurting your image

[Chorus:]
I ain't a pimp but you should make these niggas pay for it
I ain't a pimp but you should make these niggas pay for it


[Verse 2:]
I ain't talking bout the pussy talking about your grind
Let me teach you how to maximize your time
Like first things first you need to manage your money and don't do shit if it ain't making you nothing
And you can give me a call I can give you the game
Stay away from them niggas with them fake ass chains
Girl me and you together we can get us a ring
You can be Wade I can be King James
Tryna give your ass stability (yeah)
But with that that means you gotta minimize your availability
If you feeling good baby girl you can bring it all right back to me
But if you only want to do 50 percent of the profit that's only half of an opportunity (you dig)

[Chorus:]
I ain't a pimp but you should make these niggas pay for it
I ain't a pimp but you should make these niggas pay for it
