I like Hennessy, it make me go all night
I don't smoke that much weed, but I stay real high
My penthouse at the top, ain't no more goin' up
And all these bitches from my city man they blowin' up
Go get that money baby, go get that money baby
Go get that money baby, go get that money baby
Go get that money girl, go get that money baby
Go get that money baby, go get that money baby

[Verse 1]
Uh, niggas know I'm the king of the city
Know I am hi-def that ain't shit you can tell me
My money ain't funny like Keenan and Kelly
My bitches they badder than bitches in ballet
And all of my bitches know they temporary
Don't get em no diamonds don't get no canaries
Don't get em no rings but you dropped the confetti
I'm big Ben and Ellie your mamma is Patty
Your diamonds don't talk like Tom and Jerry
Your girl ain't a ho she a voluntary
She asked me "do I wanna fuck wit her friend"
I said "I do" like its time we married
Ask who better than young KB
Don't know no youngin like Donna Karan
I beat the box and all office niggas
Switch more positions than Tyler Perry

[Hook]
I like Hennessy, it make me go all night
I don't smoke that much weed, but I stay real high
