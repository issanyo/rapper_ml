Pour up, Drank
Pour up, Drank

[Chorus]
I heard about them girls out in Houston
The ones down the ride, they don’t never switch sides
Yeah the girls out in Houston
The ones getting throwed cuz they get it on they own

Even when they talking down they be reppin H-Town
Yeah the girls out in Houston

[Verse 1]
Yeah shawty got a thang for them slabs huh
Wood grain grippin on the dash huh
She the type to make a nigga bust a seal
Money coming in so you know the deal
We gon sip a 8th and get faded just play your role
And if you tell me you love me just say it slow

And that’s the type of shit that’s hard to find
