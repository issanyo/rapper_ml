I was chilling on Friday
Got a text message as I pulled in the driveway
From this lil freak that I met a couple weeks ago
Fine lil dime I been waiting just to freak the hoe
Shid I'm in the H so I figured I could meet the hoe
Make her feel special undress her then I beat the hoe
See I call her hoe cause she was freaky when I met the Hoe
We was at a party had my finger up her dress so
Thats my first impression yo this is was I texted the hoe
Said I got a session around 9 and I'm gone have to go
Maybe next time
She replied do you have to go
Every time I talk to you, you say you in the studio
Every time you leave swear it be around 3
In the morning when you hit me up
No matter what I pick it up
Damn now she got a nigga feeling like she real as fuck
You know what fuck the studio I'm coming to pick you up
Now she all happy smiley faces she can't get enough
Pussy on my mind all the time I can't get enough
Pull around the corner and she standing on the corner like a hooker
I'm like what the fuck she say she couldn't wait to fuck
Smiled at a nigga I'm like hold up is them braces girl?
Looked at her feet is that glitter on your laces girl?
Nah I'm just playing girl, you look great
But to myself in my head I'm saying why are you so basic girl
Two seconds later she was pulling out some heels
And that was her retainer now I'm thinking oh yeah
She pulled her pants off no panties oh yeah
Put a red dress on no panties oh yeah
She laid her seat back and put a bleezy in the air
And I could barely drive cause I was looking over there
And when the weed hit her she reached for my zipper
Looked at me asked do you mind if I kiss it
She whispered in my ear do you mind if I lick it
Turn the volume up here's my answer girl listen
To the radio it'll tell you how I'm feeling
And "say ahh" was on trey songs you my nigga
She put her head down star going hard beasting
She would go faster and I would start speeding
All I was thinking was get her to the room
Hit her with the sonic boom
Turn her night into a season
Stop light was read in my head it was green
I ran that mother fucker like my car said FIFA
Tripping I'm forgetting that my car said fever
Got it from my patna but he stole it from Kanisha
Switched the plates on it changed the plates
I should ease up off the gas but I want this ass
So I ain't easing up if I bust then I'm through
So im thinking of other stuff changed the radio
And I start singing Hillary Duff
"Hopped off the plane in the LAX"
Oh meant Miley Cyrus and then I heard sirens
Pulled the car over grabbed my wallet and my license
Looked at this hoe and this bitch started crying
I would've asked her why but I ain't really have the time
So I told her wipe your tears this gone take a lil while
The cop came up asked a nigga for my license
I gave him that along with a fake registration
He checked that came back
Everything was straight man
But he smelled weed so he had to do a search man
We got up out the vehicle and this bitch was acting weird yo
Come to find out they went to the same church man
He was like Natalie
I thought yo name was Melanie
Took her to his car
She cried "Please don't tell on me"
They talked for a minute
He put her in the front seat
Came to me and said
Son you got yourself a felony
A Felony? Nigga please!
I ain't even smoke that weed
Imma tell you how it is since that bitch snitching on me
See I picked this bitch up
He was like son please
Show me her ID
She was only seventeen

She was only seventeen

Damn
