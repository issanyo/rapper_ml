[Chorus]
Let's, call, up, on drank
Let's lean nigga, let's lean nigga
Let's, call, up, on drank
Let's lean nigga, let's lean nigga

[Verse 1]
Let's call up on drank
Let's call up on promethazine
2017 but we still sippin barre and pourin lean
So much drank up in my cup the ice don't even M O V
E A S T S I D until the E that's where I be
Always been a barre baby, mamma use to share with me
Ain't the type of nigga that be hollin' bout let's share a b
I ain't bustin down a fuckin seal or a 'gar
20 bottles in my car, I'm a million dollar star
I been sippin' so much muddy I can't even barely walk, yeah
VVS's flooded I ain't even gotta talk, yeah
Niggas talkin' drank but don't know why we got them double cups
Niggas talkin' drank with all that Karo shit you pourin up
(Karo in that drank)
Perpetratin' niggas never sip no drank before
Outta town niggas lyin in and out they songs
I got promethazine hula hoopin 'round a sweet
If you ain't got no drank then don't you call up on me

[Chorus]
Let's, call, up, on drank
Let's lean nigga, let's lean nigga
Let's, call, up, on drank
Let's lean nigga, let's lean nigga

[Verse 2]
Let's call up on drank, let's bring back the Act'
Drop a jolly rancher in the bitch and fall back yeah
Sippin on that purple till my earth turn circles
Fuck around and had a show and I forgot all of my verses
Double cup and checkin purses bitch I look better in person
I know I got a lot but none of this shit here for purchase
They say I'm actin funny cause I won't give em a line
I traded for yo bitch and hit that pussy from behind
Boy you know you outta line through the drugs I ain't supplyin
'Sace shades over my fades boy you know I'm comin dine
I be sippin and flippin and drippin that paint while grippin wood
You don't like that I got your main lil bitch
Suckin dick all through your hood
Man I got mayonnaise over mustard on them 84s
4 15's off in the trunk I'm knockin down some doors
I got pulled over yesterday I almost fell asleep
He let me go because I let him get a cup of lean

[Chorus]
Let's, call, up, on drank
Let's lean nigga, let's lean nigga
Let's, call, up, on drank
Let's lean nigga, let's lean nigga

Call up on the drank
Let's lean nigga, Let's lean nigga
Call up on the drank
Let's lean nigga, Let's lean nigga
