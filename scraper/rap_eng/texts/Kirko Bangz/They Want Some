[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I got my whole city behind me
They play my shit and rewind me
Ain't like these other rap niggas
It ain't that hard to find me
You see me in that gallow
Walking out of that Louis store
In late nights had dreams with superstars on team
These hoes say I'm cheap
Cause I ain't trickin' no shit
They look down at my feet
Spent a stack on my kicks
I say what the fuck I wanna say
Do what the fuck I wanna do
Go where the fuck I wanna go
If you don't like that  nigga' fuck you
We don't love one of these niggas
I ain't weakin' out of these hoes
Been a real nigga for a long time
I'm still here, all mine
Real hustlers don't fall out, we just get it back
Yeah the [?] if we just let it stack
I'm in the club and I got to buy twenty racks
And I'm leavin' with at least nineteen of that
Hogg! If it ain't G it ain't me
I'm everywhere you can't be
That's why these niggas envy
Thugga!

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I see a lot of niggas hating on me
But they don't want none
I know a lot of bitches waitin' on me
I thing they want some of that true shit
That real shit, that there
I think they want some
That, that butt beat that there
I think they want some
Each time they coming down, that there
I think they want some
They slammin' doors, their 84's, that there
I think they want some

[Verse 2: BeatKing]
All I see is haters on my dick in my sleep
Wake up and they still up on my dick when I tweet
White bitches in my phone now I'm gettin' money
They're life flicker after they crawl and you see me comin'
Slide through, ride blue, my wrist got moved
Pop truck stuntin' on all them hatin' hoes from highschool
My ex-gal still call my number
Every time I come on in the club she try to get drunk
Hold up, on my daughter ho I'm getting' money
On my other daughter I ain't never fallin' off
These niggas chasing hoes instead of chasing paper
Fuck a nigga I'm up in Cypress playing golf
I'm fucking these niggas' hoes they do not want it
I-Phone with naked pictures of hoes with your wife on it
Go and Slim and Bun I'm the first to get them
Kirko kill'em
Welcome to H-Town, the church of villains

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I'm pullin' up in the newest whip that you never seen in person
I valet park at the front door, the club owner come out cursin'
I'm hoppin' out with a pair of J's that don't come out for months
[?] in my mouth walked in my section, firing up them blunts
These niggas pulling stunts like it's the motherfucking X games
I've been about that cash money bank wise and checks man
Broads playing these sex games and I ain't fuckin' around
So Imma need your ass up and Imma need your face down
See that's the way that I like to hit it
Baby saying don't stop just get it
We in the bed, we on the floor, and she on my pole be poppin' with it
And I'm all up in there so wet she's gonna need swimwear
Sweatin' and stretchin' so much in the bed, you gon' think it's a gym now
Don't try to hate on me, don't want no beef like O.J
My gladiators I've you ever try to touch the OG
Put the hands on you then knock your gal and send her back to you lonesome
It's UGK for life, put that on Pimp these niggas don't want none
Keep it trill

[Hook]
