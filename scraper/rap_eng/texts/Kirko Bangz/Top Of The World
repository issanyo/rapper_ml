[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
You can catch me in a strip club, stacked up, I don't keep 'em visible
Won't see a man get thirsty cause I'm known to keep a bitch or two
Probably both be bisexual, I tell them chill and kick it boo
And never get uncomfortable these waitresses start kissing you
Y'all would call it birthday sex, I call it a ritual
If you seen it like me then I already know why y'all be miserable
You don't really want no problems, cause those shooters they're hospitable
And they gon grab them blockas while you try and keep it physical
Pool house or that guest house it don't matter where it goes down
Driveway is cobblestone, garage is like a ghost town
I ain't even touch 'em yet they feel like they've been hosed down
If you real then you gotta respect this shit, Gs up, hoes down

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I'm chilling on top of the world (top of the world, top of the world)
Now you know all about me girl (about me girl, about me girl)
Tell them niggas I did it, look how I came up
Tell em niggas I'm with it, if they bring my name up
Tell em bitches I'm gone
Don't be callin' my phone (phone) if it ain't 'bout the money baby (baby...)

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Hold up, let’s get back to my loved ones, those of y'all that been with me
Helped me to exorcise my demons, brought them to the gym with me
Probably why she text me to death like, "Joe, I got a friend wit me
And I'd love to eat her out while you on top, putting a limb in me"
Let's get back to them things I like, let's get back to that stripper pole
Let's get back to her popping that, I ain’t even really gotta tip her though
It's bonjour while I'm on tour, I mean every night, different show
And if you a little bit too sober, just tell me your favorite liquor, ho
Wait, tell me your favorite, then lick a ho
We them dudes you wanna get to know, cameras up no pictures though
Looking for them broke niggas -- don't aim at me, there ain't none
To respect my position, gotta respect where a nigga came from

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
She know I like it when her hair curled, sun dress, little bit of make up on
Turnpike, Parkway, either way won't take us long
Hit the club, 20 minutes, deuces either way I'm gone
Be a fool if I stayed there wit an ass bouncing in my favorite thong
I came from nothing like my father was a deadbeat
Wasn't for that, I don't know if I'd say success is sweet
Top of the world let's let how I sustain maintain my legacy
Taking a bit of my soul but won't let it consume the rest of me
Now let's get back to this paper though, every day, same shit
Screaming RNS for life, some of y'all don't know that language
Living for you, never for them, best way to explain it is
I want the most because I had the least, that's why I'm on my game, biotch

[Hook]
