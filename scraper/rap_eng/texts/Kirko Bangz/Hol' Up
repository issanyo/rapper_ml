[Verse 1:]
Watching the sun go down again
Another night I say hello to the end
You never got to see me coming
Bet you see me go, oh
It's getting cold, so cold
I gotta start over again
So many broken pieces
Where do I begin
You get to see [?] up
And never see it grow, oh
It's getting cold, so cold

[Pre-Chorus:]
You did me wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But ain't no love lost here
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause I'm onto the next one
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So I ain't crying no more tears
I know you heard that

{Chorus:}
Boy, get out your feelings
I'm just chillin'
You can hol' up
Sorry if you miss it
I ain't with it. Shawty hol' up
I ain't even trippin'
I'm just [?]
Hol' up. Shawty hol' up

[Verse 2:]
You was chasing them hm
I was putting that work in
Now you want me back
But I ain't trynna react
Ever since you left I've been good on my own
So don't holler at old girl
Cause you too late and I'm on one
Fall back. Hol' up
You ain't stopping my show
Now boy fall back
Hol' up. Live, learn and let go
Now that you know, it's over
I can't say that I wish you best
Can't say that I wish you best
Can't say that I wish you best

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
(Bye, bye my dear)
Got too keep it moving
I ain't even tripping
Cause you the one who losing
(Bye, bye my dear)
Got too keep improving
Cause I'ma keep on choosing
So you the one who losing
