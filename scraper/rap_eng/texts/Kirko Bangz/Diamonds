[Hook – Kirko Bangz & Chedda Da Connect]
My ear, my neck, my teeth, my wrist and my pinky, splash
My ear, my neck, my teeth, my wrist and my pinky, splash
My ear, my neck, my teeth, my wrist and my pinky, splash
My ear, my neck, my teeth, my wrist and my pinky
They all diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
They all diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
They all diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
They all diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
They all

[Verse 1 – Kirko Bangz]
My ear, my neck, my teeth, my wrist and my pinky
Your bitch she want me cause she think that I’m easy
I take your bitch and put her in some Givenchy
Your bitch she want me cause she see that I’m eating
A lot of niggas talking behind the back door
I take what I want and you keep what you ask for
I understand the game, I do what it say so
These niggas lazy, what the fuck did you came for
I’m pulling out tonight, I’m bout to surprise em
I’m swagging swaging, know she make me embarrassed
Them diamonds lying, boy I don’t see no clarity
I’m throwing this money, I should get a charity

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Chedda Da Connect]
My neck and my wrist and my ear and my pinky
The pack on me nigga, you know that it’s stinking
I’m running the check up, fuck nigga believe me
I don’t fuck with bitches right now cause they scheming
My diamonds so shiny, these niggas they watching
My diamonds so shiny, these niggas they plotting
My diamonds so shiny, these bitches they combing
My diamonds so shiny, these bitches they running
Before you [?], ice cream cones on me like [?]
Got these bitches talking bout whole thing
And I don’t roll with him cause he don’t mean, mean no good
Got these diamonds on me
I just caught a play in Arizona
You can call me [?]
Or fuck around and call me [?] jabroni
Cause I got all these diamonds on me

[Hook]
