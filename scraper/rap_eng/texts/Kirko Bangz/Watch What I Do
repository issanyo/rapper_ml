[Verse 1]
Man the last time I seen you I was stuck on yo ass can't believe that I fucked with you
Man the last time I seen you I was looking at myself like damn I was fucking her?
I can't believe I was trippin' over you in the streets had yo ass all the east
I can't believe I was trippin' over you knowing damn well you ain't care about me
Now I'm rolling through the south side girls got they mouth wide bitch I'm a boss now
A nigga about to stunt on yo ass
Pull up pop truck at the stop sign
Bitch I went and bought a all white Bentley last week cause I know that you want one
And I went and moved in the same crib that you wanted
Girl I know that I'm on one
And every time that I get a chance to make you regret your man girl you know that Ima do it to ya
And if I ever get ya friends sit behind a nigga ten then you know Ima do it to her
You turned your back on a nigga when I needed you the most
Now a nigga sitting in the ghost
When I was down I could barley pay my lease now I'm up and I swear I'm about to do the most

[Hook]
Why'd you have to turn your back, turn your back?
You chose to turn your back
You turned on me
Mhm turned yo back turned yo back
Yeah now every time I see you watch I do
When I when I pull up
Watch what I do
When I pull up
Watch what I do
When I pull up watch what I do

[Verse 2]
My friends talking to my friends like damn Kirk losing it
I'm in the room talking to myself like damn Kirk boy you losing it
I can't believe that it was a nigga birthday and you had a nigga going through that shit
I know I fucked up and I know I did wrong but you wasn't suppose to do that shit
I heard that everything that go around come around well guess what it's my turn
And Ima pull up at your birthday party like I work at a law firm
With a little fly bitch
On that suit and tie shit and its tailored Wiz Khalifa
And it ain't about the money
I would look this good if a nigga was delivering pizza
I understand that my life to crazy and a nigga got too many bitches on me
But you living like a high school prospect always trying to commit to something
And now I gotta shine on ya ass
Make sure you make the wrong choice
Ima come through take your mama out to dinner in a all gold Rolls Royce

[Hook]
