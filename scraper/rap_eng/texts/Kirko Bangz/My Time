[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I know it's not my first time
Swear it's not my last time
We ain't supposed to do this shit
You said that shit last time
I'm about to open your legs and do that thang
That turn them girls to women
And make quiet bitches sing
I know you ain't a good girl
Swear you ain't a bad girl
Rub you down with lotion
Oh you love it when I'm back there
Lay you on your back
And let your hands run through my hair
Cause I'm about to thank you for that pussy in advance

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
I know you got a man, but Damn
When im around you quit your plans
Im playa type you understand
You will never meet a nigga like this again
I'm coming through, ditch your friends
Or let them stay I got dick for 10
I got work to do I'm clocking in
It's 3 o clock we don't stop 'til 10
Watch a movie pop it in I'm a movie pop me in
Let you see all them freaky scenes
Call her movie I'm in between
Save your number as Billie Jean
You're not my lover you are just a fling
Experiment into several things
I wouldn't do unless you're my queen
Lick you up and I dick you down
Girl you know that I've been around
Know you ain't been supposed to be with me
And you told me that shit plenty times
You live a lie you getting live
Cause I'm the nigga off in this town
You love the fact that I put it down
And I'm about everything I rhyme
My friend taught me to slow it down
When I was in her she showed me how
To could take my time make it last
And now she love it how I hold it down
You show me love stay gon'
And down let's switch roles I'm a show you how
He should do it, if he pursued you
And since he don't that's why he lose you

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
You fuck with niggas that bust a nut and roll
But I am the king of the ghetto
And I came here to fuck your soul
I don't need no intimacy baby
But I'm a take you to ecstasy baby
You gon cum so hard everyday of ya life
You gon' be trying to get with me baby
Bring a diaper with you cause when you leave
You gonna be leaking all over ya legs
You gon be begging me to stop cause it hurts so good
Everytime I put your feet over ya head
I make them girls get down on the floor
Make they period come early
When I put this nine on the ho
And it ain't no love involved
No motherfucking love at all
She don't love me either
But I bet she love that log
Don't be poppin' up at my crib
Tryin' to get a quick fix
Unless you talk to a nigga first
Then you can get some of this dick
I know I'm a get that pussy so
I'm gonna thank you in advance
I'm a gynecologist RO GBYN take off your pants BOITCH
