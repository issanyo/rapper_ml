[Hook: BeatKing]
Put your middle fingers up if you ain't friendly
Keep your middle fingers up if you ain't friendly
(If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown)
Keep your middle fingers if you want me
(If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown)

[Verse 1: BeatKing]
Studewood nigga, Northside one deep Imma rep it
In the 'lac flexin' with that Glock
Boys tryna plot end up shot, lookin' confused up in heaven
Bitch ain't friendly, ain't never been
Slab crusher watch the propeller spit up, ups I mean blades
Money on my mind on the grind gettin' paid
Me and Thugga turnin' heads on stage
I don't love these hoes , I don't love these bitches, I don't love these niggas, I don't love these humans
I just love this paper, if you want a feature auto cash visa my trap boomin'
One deep in that slab and I'm leaning, got your main dreaming
Money on my mind and I'm scheming
Looking throwed is a pass on the Ave if you see me

[Hook: BeatKing]
Put your middle fingers up if you ain't friendly
Keep your middle fingers up if you ain't friendly
(If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown)
Keep your middle fingers if you want me
(If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown)

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
I'm ridin' round in the truck of trunk
You boring hoes can't fuck with us
You suck my dick I'm bout to bust
To like mama say is suck it up
I hate that's a friendly bitch
She only fuckin' her, cause I'm fuckin' her
I hate a nigga that's a friendly bitch, you ain't hit my drank, you ain't hit my blunt
We talkin' bout you got a hit song like every other nigga in the club
Your car rented, your chain rented, your bitch rented, you rented thug
Old friendly ass niggas tryna take pictures with a nigga of in the club
Got one bottle and a group of bitches and they all 3's like Kevin Love

[Hook: BeatKing]
Put your middle fingers up if you ain't friendly
Keep your middle fingers up if you ain't friendly
(If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown)
Keep your middle fingers if you want me
(If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown)
