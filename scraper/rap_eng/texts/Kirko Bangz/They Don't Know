I'm the type of nigga,don't simp, dont fall in love
And you the type of bitch that all my [?] gone love
And I'm the one that set you and my nigga up

And I was trynna see if we could switch it up

Fuck all that talking and chattin'

Girl i'm ready to eat your pussy lick you lower if you bout it
I already met your mammy and she told me i remind her of your daddy
Put your hands behind your backs when I hit it from the back
On your stomach, on your back while my hands on your neck

If you nasty, get real nasty, i like that sloppy-
A Fine Dime with a young dirty south nigga i know you heard

They gone talk, and they gone hate
They gone wish they had a nigga like me
But I don't play
