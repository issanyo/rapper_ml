I done came down you know what that mean
I done came up you know what that mean
And girl im about to put some player shit
On your mind right now
And if you ever thought I had it
Swear I got it right now

I done came down you know what that mean
I done came up you know what that mean
Man im about to put some real shit
On your mind right now
And if you ever thought I had it
Swear I got it right now

[Verse 1]
Im like a toiling fishing pole
When it come to that real
Cause I ain't never had no time
To debate on it
And Niggas asking about my grind
And they question my skill
Like will I ever see an album
With his name on it
I got a journal full of questions
I don't answer no more
Energy for showing love
That i don't channel no more
Im trynna see when I went left
Right away from my dreams
I even thought what ima do
If i ain't rapping no more
I fell in love with a college girl
And she put it all on the line
Put it all and I fucked it all up
But that's the type of girl
That I need when this shit is all done
Cause right now, right now
I can only focus on one thing
And this game ain't built for niggas in love

[Hook]
I done came down you know what that mean
I done came up you know what that mean
Man im about to put some player shit
On your mind right now
And if you ever thought I had it
Bet i got it right now

I done came down you know what that mean
I done came up you know what that mean
Man im about to put some real shit
On your mind right now
And if you ever thought I had it
Swear i got it right now

[Verse 2]
Every time I have a dream
It's about knowing ahead
And then hating on every nigga
That probably took it from
Everything is what it seems
It's exactly what you think it is
All my old bitches stopped looking for me
Now I got my mind right
Not to mention I got this 9 tight
Not to mention it's on my lap at the stoplight
Im heading to meet my nigga Heart in the limelight
And that's the same night that everything switched
Lost my bitch cause niggas in the club taking pictures of me
I always been the nigga that let bitches make examples of me
Cause I never gave a fuck about what people thinking of me
The whole time im talking to this
Bitch she got a camera on me
After that im thinking to myself
That was just a moment
5 hour difference from our girl
She still slept lonely
And as for that bitch shit she used to fuck the homie
That's if you wanna get to know me

[Hook]
I done came down you know what that mean (x4)
Im bout to come down
Im coming down right now
Stop blowing up my phone
Im Coming down right now
Say girl stop tripping im coming down right now
Just chill in the lobby im coming down right now
