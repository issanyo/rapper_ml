[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
That girl's a rider, yeah
She hold a nigga down
She tell me she don't fuck nobody else
When I'm not around
That ain't none of my business (X6)

[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]
We a little too young
Little too dumb
Maybe just a little too sprung
He my new gun
And I love it when he use tongue
Give me new lungs
Hit it like a fucking new drum
Leave me too strung
A nigga said something, what he do he swung
He been a down ass nigga since we too begun
I always have his back whether fondue or crumb (through the good or bad)
Cause baby I know getting rich with you'd be fun
But right now, right now gon' throw these ones
You know I'm with it, ima throw me some
You run around with your homies
But just remember you my only one
It'll slowly come
You with a bitch, that ain't my business
I seen all them fakes, I ain't change feelings
Baby I'm just working game killing
You will never find me with the lames chilling
Know I'll die for you

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
That girl's a rider, yeah
She hold a nigga down
She tell me she don't fuck nobody else
When I'm not around
That ain't none of my business (X6)

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
I never worry 'bout the shit that she do
That ain't none of my business
She tryna get fucked up with her crew
That ain't none of my business
If she fuck with another nigga, love with another nigga
I ain't tripping if you in the club with another nigga
Why you got them shades on
Girl you should have stayed home
Don't be worried 'bout me, I ain't tripping get your drink on
That ain't none of my business
I ain't all in my feelings
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas
So don't be trippin' when you see me with some bitches

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
That girl's a rider, yeah
She hold a nigga down
She tell me she don't fuck nobody else
When I'm not around
That ain't none of my business (X6)

[Verse 3: Constantine]
I told her
If she got a side nigga
That ain't none of my business, that ain't none of my business
Your ex in love with you
That ain't none of my business, that ain't none of my business
If he ain't over you
Blowing up your phone, girl what's up with you
I don't wanna have control of you
All I wanna do is smoke with you and fuck on you
Love it when I smack it
I love it when you pull my pants down
Love it when I slip and slide in
But down bitch
I swear

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
That girl's a rider, yeah
She hold a nigga down
She tell me she don't fuck nobody else
When I'm not around
That ain't none of my business (X6)
