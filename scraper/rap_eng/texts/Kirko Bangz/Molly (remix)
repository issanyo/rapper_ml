[Verse 1: boston george]
Go for it deep, that show biz she cheap
She be like she win
I run her through the front seat
Grabbing molly, I’m sweating, that little …
All done ‘em rolling, them 30 pulls in that biz
I’m in the club with a model bitch
My pills with hollow tips
You don’t come where I come from
Type nigga you run from
Got young killed like cheap kick
Kill the club like big …
Zip joint no George Beach
We kill each other over the coca a leaf
Big money like Donald Trump
We beat dogs, y’all little pup
Y’all scared of beef well I don’t give a fuck
In the kitchen we double up
Real niggas we over here talking ‘bout …of a deal
Fuck ‘em, bitch don’t gain ho, what the fuck they think they mighty foe

[Verse 2: meek mill]
I said tats all on my body
Shorty want that molly
She gonna get what she asked for
Fuck the girl, my last hope
Check the stash, my team winning
Why they niggas so mad, bro?
Let me get it, I lean in it
Ride by on fast forward
I’m flexin’ on, I’m no tick
Big tags, no ring, if you ain’t talking ‘bout money, nigga
You ain’t talking ‘bout shit
I say you ain’t talking ‘bout nothing ho
If you ain’t talking ‘bout dick
You ain’t talking ‘bout something, nigga
If you ain’t talking ‘bout this
I say drop the molly, she sweat
Nigga strapped with no question
Bad bitch who like Betty Boop
Got niggas talking …
I went and caught me another coo
Four dough plus four hoes
Four hoes on four mollies
They rollin’ like they on tour

[Verse 3: kirko bangz]
Say I’ve been losing my …the bitches just drop
I had a score when they turning the strippers around
I’m hanging with all of my niggas in here
And the molly we just took a picture
For the first time, look at the time
It was 4:30 I thought it was 9
…but I’m used to the brine
Washing it down, I’m off so dry
And I’m like ‘pass me some water
So I can roll harder and man I’m so thrown
I’d probably fuck around in Raja
In this bitch so fine I probably let her have my daughter
My lips talking, I’mma need that plan B up in the morning
I’m so thrown my bitch ain’t straight we fucking these bitches
They flipping away
‘Cause I’m the young gunner the H
Get pussy like every day bait
Fucking these bitches from back in the day
You busting a condom, my nigga, I’m busting her face
