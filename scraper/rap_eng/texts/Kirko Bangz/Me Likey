[Verse 1: Trevor Jackson]
Met a girl in Miami, she can barely understand me
I don't think she got a job, but she do work
I-I-I I'ma let her meet the family
She ain't lookin' for love, go figure
I just met her at the club, she might be a gold digger
Well get down girl, go ahead get down

[Bridge: Trevor Jackson]
She dancin' movin' that thang, for me (thang for me)
I think she got a thang, for me (thang for me)
Me likey, what I see
Your hands all over my body, baby
It's just you and me
W-W-W What's your fantasy baby?

She's such a bad habit, but she make's me feel good, yeah

Go figure, mami sound good on the phone
Such a good kisser, when I get her all alone

[Bridge: Trevor Jackson]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
Cool, cool, baby
I could take the summer off
Young bangz, makin' sure she wheel like armor all
How to be a player baby, I should write the monologue
Mama wanna touch me, she don't want me as a son-in-law
That girl there a gift, Mrs. Santa Claus
I'm just tryin' get up in her prize, like a rental car
She all on me, like I'm walking in the Pentagon
She say I'm sweet, I'm tryna' turn into a Cinnabun
Oooh, he so classy (classy)
And she like the fact my voice, so raspy
I'ma H-Town playa, and the game ain't fair
But the girl's so nasty

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
