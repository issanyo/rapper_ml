(Verse 1: Kirko Bangz)
I like bitches that like bitches, that like bitches that like bitches
Man, I got that from my nigga Nipsey
Fuck her once now your bitch tryna take a picture
Uh, court side with my gang tight
She fuck with me on the same night
Cause she left you if that ain't right
And I'm just gon' be wrong
Girl let's make this quick cause I can't be that long
Got a interview with that magazine
On a talk show with your favorite host
And my dick as long as that limousine
Don't worry about all 'em bitches
Girl just mind yo business
I don't worry about all them niggas
Them niggas there, they wack wack
They talking about that hundred G's
Girl real shit, I could make that
In one weekend, girl don't front right here
Cause I'm the one this year, oh yeah

Hook:
I got a friend, we fuck around
She let me in, I dick her down
And every time she hit me I'mma roll through
And she gon do exactly what she suppose to
I got a friend, we fuck around
She let me in, I dick her down
And then she call up every girl she close to
And tell them that I hit it like I'm suppose to

(Verse 2: Nipey Hu$$le)
She call me and say 'where you at?'
I told her 'In the black on black'
She brought the bottle and a sack
I fucked her once and ran it back
Type of player shit is that
She know I'm balling since she brought the sack
She see the level that I'm playing at
And respect what I made from scratch
Safe to say I state the facts
And always had baby back
See a nigga raising racks
And now the sex is how she pay me back

Hook:
I got a friend, we fuck around
She let me in, I dick her down
And every time she hit me I'mma roll through
And she gon do exactly what she suppose to
I got a friend, we fuck around
She let me in, I dick her down
And then she call up every girl she close to
And tell them that I hit it like I'm suppose to

(Verse 3: Kirko Bangz)
Your main bitch, she say she love me
She get my dick, that bitch she lucky
I'm gone off the Hennessey
I fuck her once she gon remember me
She say I ain't a lil nigga
That pussy, that for free, ain't cost a bill, nigga
I did it with my chains on
And if she real live, I throw my gang on
That's LMG OB, I put my niggas over me
And have them niggas on their knees
And all these bitches wanna cop a feel
I'm rolling through these hoes like an ex-pill
I tell you what the top feel like
All these hoes from magazines, I fuck them hoes in real life
All these hoes from videos, I fuck them hoes in real life
All these hoes from all these movies, man, I hit in real life

Hook:
I got a friend, we fuck around
She let me in, I dick her down
And every time she hit me I'mma roll through
And she gonna do exactly what she suppose to
I got a friend, we fuck around
She let me in, I dick her down
And then she call up every girl she close to
And tell them that I hit it like I'm suppose to
