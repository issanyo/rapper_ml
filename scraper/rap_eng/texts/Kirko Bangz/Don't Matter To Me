I heard about you baby
But I ain't worried about you baby
I know some niggas had you before I got you
But it's my time I got you baby
I heard about the shit you did with Slim Thug
I heard Propain could of hit you at the club
And I heard Doe Beezy had you on the southeast
But let me tell you about me
Girl I wouldn't give a damn if you was a prostitute
And you hit up every rapper that I ever knew
My nigga Killa told me last night that he smashed you too
I told them niggas that shit don't matter to me

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
That shit don't matter to me
No no it don't, no no it don't

Them tattoos on yo thighs killer
I ain't gon' bring up my niggas
And I heard you was a stripper baby
But I don't mind tippin'
Girl we good don't trip
I already know that shit
Why you gotta ask about that
Don't ask me about Mac bitch
Why you tryna tell me about her
Girl I know everything that she did
She called my phone talking about she rapping and recording me on some weak shit
These hoes sell they souls for reality shows
You could book a few parties cause a young nigga put you in the door
And the crazy thing about that shit
I don't never trip about that shit
My big cousin was behind that shit
It still don't matter to me
Boy you learned yo lesson
I hope you learned yo lesson
That shit don't matter to me
No no it don't, no no it don't

Say girl it's alright, girl it's alright
Ooh girl it's all right some shit you can't control
Say girl it's alright, girl it's alright
Ooh girl it's all right some shit you can't control
