[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Say she in King of Diamonds Monday, ain't scared to get that money
Back in church by Sunday
But we all know she’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
She’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
Uh, say she in school Tuesday through Friday, Friday night that’s my day
But Saturday through Sunday, she ‘bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Said she in love with that pole, she so in love with that pole
She love waking up, love waking up, waking up with that dough
I love it when she come home all the way drunk and all the way throwed
Said boy be on that way, so you know I be on that road
Got that drink up in my cup but that don’t mean that I move slow
Drank up in my cup but that don’t mean that I fuck slow
She got a tattoo on her ass, you know it say Kirko
She tattooed to her cash, shaking that ass and letting it go
She like “Baby boy don’t trip about it, everything you hear ‘cause these hoes
Sneak around on the low and I'm just out here getting my dough”
I'm like “Baby girl don’t trip about it, everything you hear ‘cause these hoes
Sneak around on the low and knowing they wanna get on that pole”

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Said she in King of Diamonds Monday, ain't scared to get that money
But back in church by Sunday
But we all know she’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
She’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
Said she in school Tuesday through Friday, Friday night, that’s my day
Saturday through Sunday, she ‘bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah girl I got all this money, do it, do it for me
Make your booty clap, I got racks if you want it, it's yours
Cause baby we gon' get this party started
You better turn your phone off, don't want them niggas calling
Come here, you be pulling down on my zipper
I'mma give it to you and then her and then y'all can get on this pole together
You're giving me chills, you push that climax while I'm licking yo back
How does it feel? Say I don't know, it just started something
There she go, on the pole
Drop it, drop it low on the floor
I'mma put my hands up, you just do it some more
She doing it like a pro, she doing it like a pro

[Chorus]
