[Intro: Kirko Bangz]
See me ridin', my nigga?
My shit shinin', my nigga?
Fuck nigga keep lookin'

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
You see how I'm ridin' right? See me ridin' round nigga
Them diamonds shinin' right? See me shinin', my nigga
Fuck nigga keep lookin', lookin' for a nigga
See his bitch keep lookin', ain't my fault his bitch keep lookin', my nigga
Standing in the club, on the couch, what up, my nigga?
Dare nigga try to kick me out, can't touch my nigga
You won't see no lame ass nigga with me
Won't see it, cause every nigga with me gotta carry that heat
Believe it, I done came down in the foreign
Got a bitch nigga mad cause I just made a milli off tourin'
And I'm still in the hood flexin' like an OG
If a nigga get out of place come and holla at me, aww yeah

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I got it on me, I got it on me, got it on me, I got it on me
I got it on me, I got it on me, got it on me, I got it on me
I got it on me, I got it on me, got it on me
I got it on me, I got it on me, got it on me, I got it on me
I got bitches on the pole, my swisher full of dro
Giuseppes on my toes, your bitch ready to go
Cause I got it on me, I got on me, got it on me
I got it on me, I got it on me, on me

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I got it on me, I keep it on me
My nina it leave you without aquifina
Pull up in the Beemer she get my demeanor
Look like I just jumped out the cleaners
I gotta keep the pocket rocket on me
Like Martin, he gotta keep Gina
Katrina somebody, come FEMA
I'm beating that drum like Ike and Tina
Young nigga I play with them keys
I'm Stevie Wonder, no Alicia
That iPhone I got for that billy phone
Chop phone, that Motorola and the beeper

[Verse 3: Offset]
I got it on me, got it under the seat
Aim at your head, ain't aiming at ya feet
Goons on a real nigga, that's a sneak peak
She fuckin' with me on a loft on a beach
I know that you mad, young nigga got cash
She suckin' me off while I'm rollin' the cash
You talkin' that shit so a young nigga laugh
I skert in the 'Rari, 220 on the dash
J's they knock at the door like Jehovah
Pull out the chopper it bite like a cobra
Ace of Spades bottles like I'm playin' poker
Smashin' your girlfriend in the back of the Cobra

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Quavo]
Trap out the bando, it's Migo head honcho
She all on the pole when a nigga throw pesos
She want a bankroll on Quavo
Gotta twerk for Kirko, trap for the Migos
That's the plug pull up with a kilo, got a white boy like Steve-O
Tryna come rob, I got that thing bet I shoot you like a free throw
Big house on the hill baby, every room got a pole in it
So when I take it to the crib baby, every room I'mma throw Benji's
Big house on the hill baby, every room got a pole in it
So when I take it to the crib baby, every room I'mma throw Benji's
