(Hook)
I'm a playa,playa ,playa
I ain't worried about none of these hoes
Can't no nigga shine like me
Can't no nigga put it down like me
I'm a player ,player ,player
I ain't worried about none of these hoes
Can't no nigga shine like me
Can't no nigga put it down like me

(Verse)
Remember back in high school used to hope that I pass
Now a nigga graduated and I'm chasing this ass
I ain't fucking with the bitch unless she making that cash
And if I'm fucking with the bitch that means she making me cash
Used to holla and smash now I holla and dash
On to the money baby got a highway stash
Used to have a young ho that was flunking her class
'Til I start fucking the teacher now my young bitch pass
She has fat ass ,big titties ,I done fucked every bad bitch up in the city
So nigga don't you coming at me talking about no hoes
And bitch don't you come at me unless it's about the dough

(Hook)
I'm a player ,player ,player
I ain't worried about none of these hoes
Can't no nigga shine like me
Can't no nigga put it down like me
I'm a player ,player ,player
I ain't worried about none of these hoes
Can't no nigga shine like me
Can't no nigga put it down like me

(Verse)
It's , I ain't playin ass nigga from no east side streets
Nigga ride for my niggas , niggas ride for me
Fuck once , fuck twice never go round three
And I ain't never been the type to go and cuddle and shit
I keep it playa I never lay off
I'm basket ballin' on these niggas look out for dreya
I'm on my motherfucking grind, I gotta shine
Got bitches doing overtime watching overtime
It's over nigga
Your girl doin' anything to get close to niggas
And she's your own sibling jumping over niggas
To take a picture of me in the club
Now I'm getting pictures from her in the tub, man what's up

(Hook)
I'm a playa,playa ,playa
I ain't worried about none of these hoes
Can't no nigga shine like me
Can't no nigga put it down like me
I'm a player ,player ,player
I ain't worried about none of these hoes
Can't no nigga shine like me
Can't no nigga put it down like me
