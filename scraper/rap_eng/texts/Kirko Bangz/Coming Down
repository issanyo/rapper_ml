Young nigga get the most hoes
If the city was a high school
Baby young nigga right here fuck a around win the most shows
Bout to get some 4s put 'em on vogues
My brother AT put him on hoes
I tell my lil sis keep her door closed
And if a nigga knock get the .44, .44
But my old bitch front
Know the bitch can't get none
No dick from me
It's a bitch bring a friend and a friend, bring a friend wit a big tongue
Young nigga but the old women want to fuck a young nigga
Like the old nigga then did something
Niggas say I'm fuckin all these bitches cuz a nigga famous
I was fuckin bitches when I flipped the hefty
Women touch me, she fucked she loved me
I fucked her on her honeymoon, once at her wedding
Say it in a church then I got a confession
I fuck with yo friend right now, we texting
The preacher laughed, she start undressing
Then she said this is what you call a blessing
I hit two times then I learned my lesson
Then she hit me up two times it ain't up for discussion

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T]
Coming down, pushing buttons
A broke muthafucka can't tell me nothing
Workin wheel showin grill
If you ain't fuck a bitch ain't no discussion
Stoppin slow, Stop & Go
Shrimp and Lobster at Pappadeaux
Every other day I break a bitch
Don't be mad yo bitch Stop & Blow
You gots to know
She ain't to great for a nigga like me
You a lame at the door, Just a V.I.P
In the back of the club tryin to invite me
If you a busta bitch, get your fuck on
If your a nasty bitch get your suck on
If you ain't fuckin wit it den get the fuck on
While they bussin bands I'mma buss on, a bad bitch
My worst chick might keep me stayin
Yo best chick probably can't spell payment

They be lookin at me smilin like Daddy you da man way back when i got my millions
I told my son don't trust these hoes
Afta you wash yo hands don't touch these hoes
I put big diamonds in my mouth my shits so big I grow tired when brush these hoes

I could make a bad bitch nut when I touch her
But ain't no touching if it ain't no rubber
I rather be a played brotha not you nigga daddy lover
Make this ho get on her knees and put the bottom of my nut sack on top of her nostrils
Be careful when eat my dick if you bite my shit that'll make me hostile
And yeah I got them D Blocks That's why they call me Jadakiss
