[Hook]
Ain’t no nigga did nothing for me
So I did it on my own
I be riding choppas cause these hoes
Wanna see my chrome
Them boys be hating, these boys be faking
That’s cause we made it, congratulate us

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time I ain’t had shit
Now I got shit, but I ain’t rich
But a nigga rich, wanna count the petes
In my family, on some real shit
Got all my niggas, my crew thick
I pay the bills, real nigga shit
Back in the time, I was out my mind
And I ain’t even have a real bitch
Hand me down the clothes, hand me down the shoes
But nowadays I hand out jews
And nowadays I’m like fuck hoes
And all my niggas talk about the crew
Used to have them bitches fucking other bitches
Now my old bitches fucking all my niggas
That’s what you get when you getting fame
And when I say shit, I ain’t tripping
Got family that’s bout to get evicted
Family that’s bout to get evicted
If they call me up and I don’t have shit
Imma make sure they don’t get evicted
I used to play the field, now I’m playing pitcher
Grind hard so I can frame the picture
I’m the bread winner, I’m the money maker
And this song here for all my niggas

[Hook] x 2
Ain’t no nigga did nothing for me
So I did it on my own
I be riding choppas cause these hoes
Wanna steal my crown
Them boys be hating, these boys be faking
That’s cause we made it, congratulate us

[Verse 2]
Forgive those who try to hold me
And fuck those who wanna expose me
Cause they main bitch wanna hold me
Can none of y’all ho niggas fool me
Man y’all niggas gonna need 4 of me
Can none of y’all bitches niggas pour with me
My shit flowing, that’s poetry
Peel back the top, them hoes bop
I’m 22, my car 1 month
Should I bought the shit before it came out
Just to let some of this paint out
My cousin called, she in pain now
But all that shit bout to change now
But the shit hard when you show them good
And they go back to what I fucked them up
Man I don’t know, shit I don’t know
Man I’m trying my best but it won’t show
It’s like everybody ain’t never happy
And I’m just tryina make teeth show
If I give them a dollar, they want more
If I give them reggie, they want drough
If I give them chucks, they want jordans
If I don’t do it then I’m a low

Damn damn a shame, ain’t fuck it maine
Cause you ain’t even fuck gotta love me
And you ain’t even fuck gotta fuck with veins
Cause you ain’t love me before I was getting changed x 2

[Hookx2]
Ain’t no nigga did nothing for me
So I did it on my own
I be riding choppas cause these hoes
Wanna steal my crown
Them boys be hating, these boys be faking
That’s cause we made it, congratulate us
