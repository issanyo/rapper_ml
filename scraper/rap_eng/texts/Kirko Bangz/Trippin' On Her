[Verse 1]
Shit, I've been a player
I ain't ever had a girl before
And there ain't ever been a time where I worried more
Thinking like "Should I call less or call more?"
And "What if I ain't really got nothing to call for?"
But I just wanna talk
Brotha's call get ignored
I automatically think that she dont love me no more
When she could be busy or sleeping
But me being me
I accuse her ass of creepin'
Its on a niggas mind all the time
I ain't leaving
I'm falling somewhere where getting out ain't easy
She know just what to say to have a nigga straight feenin'
We ain't even have sex yet
And I ain't even feenin'
I ain't even thinking
Just saying what I feel
I ain't even thinking
So I'm saying what's real
But this shit is too real
Trippin' ain't fun
She say she's done at 9:00
I'll hit her at 9:01
Like nigga give her some time
You're supposed to be the one
Now I'm losing my edge
Especially when I'm drunk
I send her a text message
Tell her that she's "the one"
She don't reply on my time
I'll tell her to get the fuck
Then I try to apologize
She ain't answering her phone
Then I text her ass again and again
Say I'm gone
I'm trippin' like a bitch
What the fuck is going on?
I'm trippin' like a bitch
What the fuck is going on, man?

[Hook]
Shit, man, I gotta stop trippin' on you
But for some reason, man, im thinking that you're creepin' on me
And shit, man, I gotta stop trippin' on you
But I love you
That's the reason that im flipping on you
And shit, man I gotta stop trippin' on you
Even my partners tell me "Chill, man, you're trippin' homie"
And shit, I know I gotta stop trippin' on you
Before you do some crazy shit
And start cheating on me... forreal

[Verse 2]
Man, I bet she don't call either
I Bet she don't think that I'm about to leave her
I bet she's probably thinking that I really need her
I bet she have an excuse
I bet i'll believe her
I bet she probably thinks she did nothing wrong
I bet she says her phone ringer wasn't on
I bet she says she had to put the kid to sleep
And I bet she thinking "Damn, man, this nigga weak"
I bet she tells her friends "I got that nigga locked"
I bet she's thinking all my player shit done stopped
It did
But I don't like the fact she knows that
I'm trippin' in this bitch
And I don't like that she knows that
Just know that
I bet you when I leave she'll realize
I bet you when I leave i'll be alive
I bet you she ain't even been messing around
And I bet she probably thinks that I'm messing around
So, Is she with me for me
Or just the comfort
Of having somebody around that's about to conquer
The world
Man, these thoughts got me going bonkers
Man, I wish I never met her
But still I love her
Damn

[Hook]
Man, I gotta stop trippin' on you
But for some reason, man, im thinking that you're creepin' on me
And shit, man, I gotta stop trippin' on you
But I love you
That's the reason that im flipping on you
And shit, man I gotta stop trippin' on you
Even my partners tell me "Chill, man, you're trippin' homie"
And shit, I know I gotta stop trippin' on you
Before you do some crazy shit
And start cheating on me... forreal

[Verse 3]
My niggas in my ear saying every girls the same
But my girl's proven to me every girl ain't
And I'm so used to being let down
I expect it
And she's so used to being beat down
She expects it
She says if we don't work out
That she's through with love
I tell her "Don't say 'if'
Cause we ain't giving up"
Her birthdays tomorrow
I can't attend the function
Cause if I show up
It's no longer a function
Everybody wants an autograph and a picture
But I just wanna be there
To share these moments with you
I understand you don't want that type of attention
But you can't hide me
Cause this is just the beginning
And you told me you was ready
You lied to me
And I told you I was ready when you cried to me
Told You Ima Miss you while I'm tryin to make a difference
But you taking my vision
While I'm chasing my dream
I'm out here chasing the cream for us
So we can live better
So you and your baby girl can have that real cheddar
You know that real cheddar
Why don't you call me so I feel better?
Please

[Phone rings/ Voicemail]

[Hook]
Man, I gotta stop trippin' on you
But this the type of shit that makes me think you're creepin' on me
And shit, I know I gotta stop trippin' on you
But I love you
That's the reason that im flipping on you
And shit, man I'm tryna stop trippin' on you
Even my partners tell me "Chill, man, you're trippin' homie"
And shit, I know I gotta stop trippin' on you
Before you do some crazy shit
And start cheating on me... forreal
