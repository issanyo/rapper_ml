[Intro:]
Smoking kush drinking [?] swinging on the swingers

[Chorus:]
They say they want dat Texas
What you know about coming down Benz and Lexus
I gotta do this shit for Texas
Sipping [?] and cleaning interior

[Verse 1:]
Man it's a good ass day in that lone star state
I'm white T'd and J'd up about to swing down MLK
I fill my cup up with [?] yea Texas know about that [?]
You can't say lean and that purple that shit done got to commercial
I take it back to my roots 93 92
Then put y'all boys up on game y'all can take that shit too
Im talking blue over gray where we bound and parlay
And every nigga in the city got a tape from that
I got a grill from that Johnny now a mouth full of golds
Niggas die over swingers 84s and the Vogues
Got niggas saying they tipping got it all in they songs
But you don't know the history that nigga never rode 4s
I'm just proud to be from Texas popping 16 in the Benz and Lexus
Sipping on [?] and my bumper grill make a fuck nigga want to start plexing
Im from Texas Im from Houston gotta say that shit with pride
If you feeling how I'm feeling throw that shit up in the sky

[Chorus:]
They say they want dat Texas
What you know about coming down Benz and Lexus
I gotta do this shit for Texas
Sipping [?] and cleaning interior

[Outro:]
