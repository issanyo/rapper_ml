[Verse 1]
My Annie she told me
That it would be a better day
My momma used to tell me
So now I'll put my smile away
Im sippin' on this Hennessy
Feel like im doing the wrong thing
Nobody understand me
I been going through so much pain
Sometimes I want to let it go
And I look at my little niece face
Sometimes I get emotional
When I see pictures of my niece face

[Hook]
I need someone to pray for me
Aw pray for me aw pray
Aw pray I need someone to pray for me
Aw pray for me aw pray aw pray

[Verse 2]
She say she died 5 times
When I called her on my cellphone
She said she had to talk to me
And make sure I was staying strong
She told me god got a plan
She say he got a plan for me
But I just could not understand
Why she was thinking about me
And she never see god pray for me

[Pre-Hook]
Aw pray for me yeah pray yeah pray
She never see god pray for me
Aw pray for me yeah pray yeah pray

[Bridge]
Melodies from heaven could you rain down on me
Melodies from heaven could you rain down on me
Melodies from heaven could you rain down on me
Melodies from heaven could you rain down on me

[Hook]
