[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Even though I ain’t really fuckin’ wit’ her
And her best friend with her ex-nigga
And a nigga tell her that I’m bad for her
Nine times outta ten, she’ll be probably right
But she still pull up on a nigga every night
‘Cause she know that I’m a real nigga
I got the shit that she can feel, nigga
I’m coming down like a trill nigga
And nine times outta ten, shit, she probably right
Said she know that I’m a real nigga
I got the shit that she can feel, nigga
I’m coming down like a trill nigga
And nine times outta ten, shit, she probably right

[Verse 1]
I got a ‘H’ on my chest, for hustler
He got a ‘S’ on his chest, for sucker
He be runnin’ around here acting like a heifer
I be sliding around here bossin’, having cheddar
I need a money counter to count my scrilla scratch
His money two-faced, it talks behind his back
This what I told the young tender (What you tell her?)
What’s wrong with that nigga?
Look at these thousand-dollar jeans, look at these $500 shoes
Look at these diamonds in my rings, look at these carats in my jewels
I’m mannish, respected, ain’t no debate
I’m early, I’m woke, I ain’t late
I need a real one on my team, she need a real one on hers
I’m all about action, I’m all about verb
I got a couple of bottles, she got a sack of that herb
Give it to her, give her what she deserve

‘Cause she know that I’m a real nigga
I got the shit that she can feel, nigga
I’m coming down like a trill nigga
And nine times outta ten, shit, she probably right
Said she know that I’m a real nigga
I got the shit that she can feel, nigga
I’m coming down like a trill nigga
And nine times outta ten, shit, she probably right

[Verse 2]
It was thug at first sight, she wanted to jump my bones
She playing this here song, on her ringtone
I let her punch her number in my phone
She know I got cheese, she know I’m gouda’d up, provolone
Even if I didn’t, I could mack her
She diggin’ a factor (Like what?) Like a tractor
He probably look better than me (What you got?)
But I got a better personality
All he think about is him
All I think about is you
You a diamond rough
He ain’t even got a clue
Real recognize real, you know this
I been on my shit since Moby Dick was a goldfish
So if you ever need a favor
I’m not a captain, but I’m on deck like a sailor
