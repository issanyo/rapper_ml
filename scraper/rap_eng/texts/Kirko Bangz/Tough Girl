You you a tough tough girl trynna make it work
Not to mention that you in school

[Verse 1]
I got tonight in my pocket girl
If you really bout it we can do it right now

We can keep it real low play it cool right now
I understand you gotta hustle
You don't want everybody to see
So you drove three hours out of town
Just to get that money I know
But girl don't you worry
About me girl I don't discriminate

To put food on your dinner plate
I understand that your young and your loyal
Your daddy he left you your momma don't know
But I bet she won't complain

[Verse 2]
Beautiful girl don't sweat none these bitches
These hoes don't get out alot
The only thing on your mind is your family
And dollar signs I know

When money get low and everything fall on you
But thats why im down to ride

Pull up to your college dorm
Your roommate she's sleepin [?]
Don't let no one see my face
Hell no im not in a Bentley
But I will not give a fuck
I know that my niggas feel me
