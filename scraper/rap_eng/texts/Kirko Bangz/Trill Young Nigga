I see these hoes ass niggas talking shit about a nigga
Wanta make a nigga go and pull a bitch out a nigga
Problably take a nigga ho but I dont fuck around with bitches
That gone fuck around with niggas that be talking down on niggas
And I ain't go do your feature and I ain't go do this song
You know that you dont fuck with me so leave that shit along
I ain't been doing this for long but im already turning cold
Whatchu beleiving doesnt matter and this game is about the dough
And thats some shit that I ain't down with
Your niggas trying to get high with your down bitch
And she already shut him down niggas going quit
But he juste tell fuck that nigga he ain't got shit
And I ain't trippin play the game niggas know I keep it playa
But dont be shaking my hand when you, I know you faking
And I know you nigga waitin for me to fall of
You hating cuz I be the newest face around the south

I see these hoes ass niggas talking shit about a nigga
Wanta make a nigga go and pull a bithc out a nigga
Problably take a nigga ho but I dont fuck around with bitches
That gone fuck around with niggas that be talking down on niggas

I coulndt wait to meet thes famous people
But now I feel like these people be the lamest
They be fighting fo reality and fightin reality
At showsand hoes where go with out a salary
I guess its all good every thing is all good
Private school niggas get to pass to act all hood
Niggas never seen or passed threw our hood
But they can act like it? Shit its all good
That mean allot to me probably not allot to you
I'mma hit reping for that pimp and dj screw
Like bomb when that nigga was just like 22
You say you got monster feat boy I got like 22
Breaking out from texas you respected dont you tested
We the one thats coming down gold grill benzs and lexus
Poring up nigga whut man I did this song because
Everything we created getting stripped awy from us
All thes niggas act like they go go and call a play for us
And these industry people they trying to stay away from us
I ain't trippin on the millions man this shit was made fo us
I see my city down and im just trying to make a way for us
