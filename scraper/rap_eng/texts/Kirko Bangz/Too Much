[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
My bitches are foreign, too much for you
Rich nigga I trap out the W
QC the label, where money on the table
Young nigga, trap jumping like kangaroo
Sipping on Texas, too much in my necklace
I meet up with Kirko in Houston
The Actavis purple, the hell is you doing
You cuffing that bitch but we making a movie
Too much for you nigga, my whip cost too much for you nigga
I pull up, they calling me Diddy
AP cost 50, I’m black and ambitious, sidity
Still in the kitchen like Whitney
Only fuck with real niggas, if you lame we can’t even take a picture
Young nigga taking off like a missle
She’ll suck me, she’ll swallow, you’ll kiss her

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I heard that she a ho to keep it real with you
You cuffing on the low, that ain’t real nigga
And she already know, I’ll deal with you
Boy you don’t want them problems with a trill nigga
Too much for you nigga, my wrist cost too much for you nigga
Too much for you nigga, my bitch cost too much for you nigga
Too much for you nigga, my whip cost too much for you nigga
Too much for you nigga, that pussy’s too much for you nigga

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
You loving that ho, young nigga I pull up in ghosts
She see me, she dropping her clothes
All my hoes got money, red bottoms ain’t nothing
Pull up in the Masi, she stunting
Your bitch she fucking for something
Bring her Red Bull and some gum
Good with her tongue
Holy moly, she ain’t never seen a Rolex
Rich nigga walk around, 150K on me
Fuck the show money, still got some more money
In the mall dropping paper, that’s your ho’s money
On the road and I still got the stove running
Like Biggie, want more money
Way too much lean in my Sprite
Heard that you cuffing that bitch and you ain’t got no life
My necklace it look like the glacier
It’s way too much ice

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I heard that she a ho to keep it real with you
You cuffing on the low, that ain’t real nigga
And she already know, I’ll deal with you
Boy you don’t want them problems with a trill nigga
Too much for you nigga, my wrist cost too much for you nigga
Too much for you nigga, my bitch cost too much for you nigga
Too much for you nigga, my whip cost too much for you nigga
Too much for you nigga, that pussy’s too much for you nigga
