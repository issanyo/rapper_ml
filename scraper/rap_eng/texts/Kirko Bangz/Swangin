[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
My trunk bang like gangs
My foe swang like swangs
I'm coming through them lanes
Rockin two chains like 2chainz
Every season something new mayne
Bout now you know how we do thangs
Just bought a Bentley betcha cocaine
I'm rolling slow, and this slow ain't cruisin
With a cruiser
Ya'll boys gunna pass
But the boss people wait
I ain't gotta drive fast
It says two hundred on the dash???
But I ain't ever seen it
Never dream I'd shine this hard
But I hustle like I'm fiending, (demon)
Like a light when that Caddy take flight
I'm smoking on some kites
I'm covered up in ice
I'm with yo bitch she lookin nice
Got these niggas looking twice
I bust a dime, bust a nut
And gave her relationship advice
Right
At the next light
Third house on the left
Pullin up to the crib
Five bitches by myself
These niggas can't keep up
I still sweep the streets up
And hustle everyday until it's time for me to re-up
Thugga

[Hook: Killa Kyleon]
I put down for my city mayne
Don't give a fuck about what these niggas say bout me
I'm still rocking gold grills and I'm swanging mayne
Oh yeah I'm always going to be H-Town

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
(Check one two what it do)
84's under my fleetwood
Pockets stay fat cause they eat good
Big banga on me like Eastwood
If a hater try me,he gunna sleep good
Seats on lean in my tieback??
I'mma right side when you buy Pat???
Tv's lit you can watch that
I got a pump in my trunk if I rob that
5th wheel hanging like nueces??
I'm on a set of 84's no dueces
But If I hit this button I'm roofless,......???
And my paint job stupid
Box love me like cupid
Pullin up in the slab get schooled quick
Big wheels pokin like toothpicks, too sick
Wait borrow my screw shit, Hold up
Four fifteens I'm a freshman
H-Town king I'm a veteran
Big gun on me like I'm Western
Racks in my pockets I'm countin my blessings
Pints no bottles in my section
Sleepin like a nigga ain't restin
Gettin to the money no stressin
Diamonds on the wood grain wheel I'm pressin
