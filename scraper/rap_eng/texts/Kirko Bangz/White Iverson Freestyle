[Verse 1]
I know you tired, can't take no more
But every time I let you down you want me more
You hearin' rumors in my town, let that shit go
All these niggas talking 'bout me cause they know I get it poppin'
Girl I smack you on yo ass when I know you mad
And every time I piss you off girl that's another bag
I can't believe that you found out I had another pad

[Hook]
Inside I'm still a nigga but whenever I'm with you I act like white Iverson, white Iverson
You think I'm laying up with you but I still shoot my shot
Oh yeah, white Iverson white Iverson
You think I'm laying up with you but I'm still shooting shots
Oh yeah
White Iverson
I got em' all I don't drop no dimes
I do not practice girl I got game
And I probably be 40 without a ring

[Bridge]
I know that I'm selfish, know that I'm selfish thinking 'bout myself
Don't care what nobody think about me I'ma be myself
When I'm in your body that is a party
That's why you love me, that's why you fuck me
That's why I piss you off every damn morning and you still suck me
White Iverson
I know that you feel me like Philly you trust me
White Iverson
My city they hate me more than they love me
White Iverson
And that's why I do you so wrong
My love is not strong, I'm chasing the throne
I'm hoggin' the rock and I'm back in my zone

[Verse 2]
And I'ma take this moment to show how I feel
It's like a nigga eating oranges, had to show my appeal
I ain't in the Ivy League but the hoes still yell
The whole set dipped on me like the old Juelz
Cause they thought I was stuck like a whale in a well
The young nigga got bars I ain't got bail
Me and my nigga D-Will we ain't got no help
But nigga we ain't never trip like Shaq O'Neal
I'm feeling like old myself in 2012
But a lot more bigger and without that girl
Funny how I learned the most when I had the least
Too many niggas was talking and I pass the street
I was droppin' passive shit, they passed on me
And rode me off like a nigga had a cast on me
I done took too many casualties casually
And hearing all my people struggling it's embarrassing me

[Outro]
White Iverson, white Iverson
I tried to cover it all up
White Iverson, white Iverson
I'm 'bout to show you the real me and take that jersey off
Yeah yeah
I'm 'bout to show you my scars
Take the jersey off
Yeah yeah
I'm 'bout to show you my scars
White Iverson, white Iverson
White Iverson, white Iverson
