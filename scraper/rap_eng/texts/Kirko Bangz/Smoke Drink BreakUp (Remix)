[Intro: Ty$]
Girl first I roll up a J
Pour up a deuce
Why you always tripping? I ain't did nothing to you
Your friends hate on me
I don't like them either
Them bitches broke, ainâ€™t done half what we done

[Pre-Hook: Mila J]
Can't keep fighting with you
Can't keep forgiving you
Can't keep drinking just to stay with you
Can't keep blowing them trees
Can't keep pouring up drink
Gotta be outta my head to deal with you

[Hook]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
We smoke, we drink, or we break up
The only time we don't fight
Is when we getting high or drunk
So either we smoke, we drink, or we break up
We smoke, we drink or we at each others throat x3

[Pre-Hook]

[Verse: Ty$]
You seen that message on my phone got you mad as shit
You swear to god you ain't fucking with a nigga, I can have that bitch
You hit my joint took a sip of this shit, forgot about it
Now you want make up sex just the thought about it

[Hook]

[Verse: Problem]
Go pick up the phone
Yeah I was tripping for trying to leave you
I just got the weed, just got the drank, I'm tryna see you
I thought that was you in the Aston passing that's why I flipped
You had no right to try to take flight that wasn't my level
Baby I can't live without you
Just weed that's louder than the screams we make
When we argue, and blame then targeting
Then we drink till 11 late
That lovely face say ugly things
So drama is what ugly brings
Sometimes it's me I can agree to that
Baby I want my baby back

[Hook]

[Verse: Kirko Bangz]
I gotta be outta my head to be smoking and drinking and fucking with you
I call my connect for the drank and he tell me all he got left is deuce
I gotta be outta head to be smoking with you
On Monday I love you
On Tuesday we fucking
On Wednesday we break up
I got this drank in my cup and I'm slowed up
I got these pics in phone I can expose us
Baby girl just chill I ain't tryna go up in yo grill
When I'm sipping when I'm dranking it's roll up

[Hook]
