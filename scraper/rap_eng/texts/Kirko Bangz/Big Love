[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
I'm talkin to my niggas from the block
How we let this money separate us
I got some shit I wanna get across
And I ain't tryna talk about it later
Yeah, I seen yo mamma at the grocery store
She asked me last time I seen my nigga
She showed me pictures of all of yo kids
Looked at yo son and I seen my nigga
I'm happy for you I ain't mad at you bro
She got me thinkin bout the times that I had witchu bro
All them fuckin hoes at the club skippin in lines
And though we got kind of distant you could still hit my line
We too old to point fingers mane we both oughta blame
How I lose my main nigga to the money and fame
And honestly we both trippin need to clear this shit up
I invited you to the party and I hope you pull up

[Verse 2]
I ain't talked to you for a while
Man that shit that you did was foul
But all the mistakes you made you still don't change the fact
When she was pregnant with me you still held her down
I used to say you was my real daddy
I even told that to my real daddy
Seeing you beat my mamma really let me down
I'm 26 and I'm still battling
Yeah, but tonight I'm here to make it right
Cause I would of never made it without your advice
The shit you told me as a lil nigga
And your mistakes the reason I'm a real nigga
Age ain't got nothin to do with wisdom
And your daddy wasn't there and that's why you always in prison
But, I hate we separated when I blew up
Want you to see how much I've grown I up you pull up

[Verse 3]
I know that life real hard for you
And you feelin like nobody got your back
And you my mama favorite niece
But why you messin 'round with crack
You never felt like you had a chance
You never felt like you could make it
But you always cheered for your lil cousin
You always told you friends that I was the greatest
I got resentment in my heart towards you
Every time I think about your kids
Your son askin all these hard questions
He tell me he don't think that he his daddy kid
And I don't think that that's my place to say
But you know with me he always got a place to stay
I just hope you get better before he grow up
The whole family is waitin I hope you pull up
