[Chorus:]
See I put in that work work work work work work
Don't care who hit it first first first first first first
I'll never do you dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt
Come fuck with lil Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk
I promise I'll go down down down go on down
Come and hit me with that na na na Rihanna

[Verse 1:]
And try me I deserve it
No time to have you lurking
Want you to deal with me the nicest
But I never went there with a Pisces
I never been the one to bite shit
But now you got me want to try shit
Don't have to believe in my dreams and my virtues
I told you a lie when I said I won't hurt you
I pull out the 9 every time they approach you
You having some problems in bed Ima coach you
Don't listen to your friends man them bitches don't know shit
I know y'all close but me and you we closer
I know I dog you but now I'm way older
I pick you up put them legs on my shoulder

[Chorus:]
And hit you with that work work work work work work
Don't care who hit it first first first first first first
Swear I won't do you dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt
Come fuck with lil Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk
I be like na na na na na na
Promise I'll go down down down Rihanna

[Verse 2:]
You think I can't see but you can't hide
You can't run from me but you can ride
Don't have to believe in my dreams and my goals now
I put down the lean and I pulled all the golds out
I'm fronting the bill when you say it's time to go now
I know when we get in the car it's gon go down
You be my Aaliyah we rocking the boat now
We was having sex but I'm all in your soul now
I give you your space girl I give you your solo
That pussy like Codeine I mix it with soda
I hope it don't hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt

[Chorus:]
When I hit you with that work work work work work work
Don't care who hit it first first first first first first
I'll never do you dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt
Come fuck with lil Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk Kirk
I hit you with that work work work work work work
Don't care who hit it first first first first first first
