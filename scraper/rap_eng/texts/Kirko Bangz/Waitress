[Intro:]
She a waitress at the strip club
She a waitress at the strip club

[Verse 1:]
She a waitress at the strip club
I met her at the...strip club
Oh no no I ain't trying to save her
Man I just gotta keep it playa
She ain't in the club looking for love
That's why I can relate to her
She know I'm the young don of my city
And I got that shit that every bitch want
She remind me of Jazzy and Jazzy
Oh no she ain't flashy ain't flashy
She like to keep that shit classy and classy
She shittin' all on these dancers these dancers

[Chorus:]
But she a waitress at the strip club
She a waitress at the strip club
She a waitress at the strip strip club
She a waitress at the strip club
She a waitress at the strip club

[Verse 2:]
She a waitress at the strip club and she about to graduate
She got two jobs and a kid yo but none of that can get in my way
Man I know I gotta get her today
I don't even know what's her name
And deep down a nigga want to spend some time with her but that shit ain't part of the game
She remind me of Jazzy and Jazzy
Oh no she ain't flashy ain't flashy
She like to keep that shit classy and classy
She badder than these dancers these dancers

[Chorus:]
But she a waitress at the strip club
She a waitress at the strip club
She a waitress at the strip strip club
She a waitress at the strip club
She a waitress at the strip club
