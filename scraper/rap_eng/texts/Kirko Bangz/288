[Hook]
Ridin' down 288
Got a Bentley it's on paper plates
Give a fuck what a bitch nigga say
When I'm ridin' down 288, 288

[Verse 1]
I'm ridin' down 288
Got Bentley on paper plates, yeah
I had to go do my own thang
I had to get the fuck up out the way yeah
I'm ridin' down 288
And give a fuck what a bitch nigga say
Man I swear I had to do my own thang
I just had to get the fuck up out the way yeah

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Ridin' down 288
Had to pull up on them mayne
Penthouse shit, I could see the whole city on em' mayne
God really blessing me mayne
Tryna keep it low, but this new life stressing me mayne
'Bout to drive this a insane
I'ma let the top down and you know I'ma let the truck bang
That's the only way to heal this pain

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm from the H
I gotta swang
Swang in the lane
Down to the 288
