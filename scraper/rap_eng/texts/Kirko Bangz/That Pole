[Chorus]
Say she in King of Diamonds Monday
Ain't scared to get that money
And back in church by Sunday
But we all know she’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
She’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
Uh, say she in school Tuesday through Friday
Friday night, that’s my day
But Saturday through Sunday, she ‘bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole

[Verse 1]
Uh, said she in love with that pole, she's so in love with that pole
She love wakin' up, love wakin' up, wakin' up with that dough
I love it when she come home all the way drunk and all the way throwed
Said, "Boy be on that way," so you know I be on that road
Got that drink up in my cup but that don’t mean that I move slow
Drank up in my cup but that don’t mean that I fuck slow
She got a tattoo on her ass, you know it say Kirko
She tattooed to her cash, shakin' that ass and lettin' it go
She like, "Baby boy, don’t trip about it, everythin' you hear 'cause these hoes
Sneakin' round on the low and I’m just out here gettin' my dough"
I’m like, "Baby girl, don’t trip about it, everythin' you hear ‘cause these hoes
Sneakin' round on the low and knowin' they wanna get on that pole"

[Chorus]
Say she in King of Diamonds Monday
Ain't scared to get that money
And back in church by Sunday
But we all know she’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
She’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
Uh, say she in school Tuesday through Friday
Friday night, that’s my day
But Saturday through Sunday, she ‘bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole

[Verse 2]
Shit, said she in love with that pole, so in love with that pole
Don't care what nobody tell her, stackin that cheddar stackin' that dough
Lil mama stackin' that change, lil mama stackin' that change
She go to school, got a good job, she ain't waitin' until she get changed, nuh-uh
When she show-up, the show stops, throw her dough up, got a drop top
Keep it closed up when she drop her top and get closer
Uh, she making that money and breaking these bitches in two
Got niggas droolin' and bitches too
She a good girl, from the hood girl, doin' make-up, when she get there
Everybody like, "How'd you get that? Did you hit that? How'd you get her?"
With a pretty face and that good ass hair
With a little waist and that big ol' ass

[Chorus]
Say she in King of Diamonds Monday
Ain't scared to get that money
And back in church by Sunday
But we all know she’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
She’s in love with that pole, pole, pole
Uh, say she in school Tuesday through Friday
Friday night, that’s my day
But Saturday through Sunday, she ‘bout money
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
She ain't scared of that pole, pole, pole
