[Chorus:]
I don't care about mileage
I can't trip about that shit
I can't trip about that shit
I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
I'd still treat you like a queen
I wouldn't care if they threw money on your ass every night
You're still innocent to me

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
I could give a damn about a weak ass nigga saying he fuck with you or if he cool with you last week
Because if we count it up baby girl I'm way worse than you and you can't have more mileage than me
Rolling through the city with the top down
I ain't trying to have you on lockdown
But you know that you are more than just a friend to me
Keep it real with a nigga no pretend to be
Girl I put you before them other bitches
I don't want a classy girl I like them gutta bitches
And I ain't worried about them niggas that you fuck with
But I want to know who taught you how to suck dick

[Chorus:]
I don't care about mileage
I can't trip about that shit
I can't trip about that shit
I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
I'd still treat you like a queen
I wouldn't care if they threw money on your ass every night
You're still innocent to me
I don't care about mileage
I don't care about mileage
I don't care

[Verse 2: XO]
I don't care if you out here wilding
It's all about you girl you know you so solid
I ain't worried about no mileage
You ain't got to be in college
I know they think you were jumped on but I just want you to come around more
Might as well go and jump down I been tryna get to you for a minute
I know you probably still talk to that nigga
I'm done listening to all my niggas
I ain't gon stop until we overseas chilling
I'm tryna sip a cup of Codeine with her
I hope that pussy got that Codeine feeling
Cause I been hearing about you for a minute
And I been wanting you since I was little

[Chorus:]
I don't care about mileage
I can't trip about that shit
I can't trip about that shit
I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
I'd still treat you like a queen
I wouldn't care if they threw money on your ass every night
You're still innocent to me
