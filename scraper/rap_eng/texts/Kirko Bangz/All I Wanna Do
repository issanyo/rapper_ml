[Verse 1]
I hope that you don't take this wrong
But I plan to make it mine right after this song
I been on you for awhile, and girl it's been too long
Too keep on playing around, girl we both too grown
But I don't want you to think I'm disrespecting you
And I don't want you to think that I think less of you
But I do want you to know I'll take that stress from you
And when your dude don't go low, I'll be your substitute
You been on my mind for a very long time
Up late thinking about how would your sex be
Iâ€™m writing this song, just to make you moan
Let me get you alone, watch me go deep
I'm all up in you, you scratching on me
You biting my lips and curling yo feet, babe
Girl don't judge me but

[Hook]
All I wanna do is have sex with you
All I wanna do is have sex with you
And I can't control when I'm next to you
All I wanna do is have sex with you
All I wanna do woah, woah
All I wanna do woah, woah
All I wanna do woah, woah
All I wanna do woah, woah

[Verse 2]
I guarantee to cure your stress, just come and see
And I guarantee yo nigga ain't got shit on me
And I promise you just give me a chance and you won't leave
You can trust me
I'm about to make you love me
And you done been around my girl, been around my girl
And you the one I call every time she complain
You laying with a nigga but I'm just ya nigga
Girl it's late, why you wanna play these games?
I can tell that you feel the same
But I hope that you won't take this wrong when I say

[Hook]

[Bridge]
