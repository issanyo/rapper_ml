[Verse 1: SAARA]
Swim swim, swing way
Light me up, light me up, light me up
My scars, what's it named?
Sign me up, sign me up, sign me up
Go ahead and tell yourself
You can make it to the round
Thinkin' you could hold me down
Let me go, let me go, let me go

[Bridge]
It's just too much, overload overdosing
Is there any sense in waiting
For something to come make it better?
Now we're fading out slowly, I think we know where we're going
Seasons stay the same, it's the fall of you and me

[Chorus]
We were meant to bleed
No we were never meant to be
Bleeding out together
What we're tryna figure this out for?
When we already know the outcome
It's the fall of you and me
Yeah we were meant to bleed

[Verse 2: SAARA]
My hurts and your skin
Rip you up, rip you up, rip you up
My heart at your feet
Pick it up, pick it up

[Bridge]
And you know it's just too much
Is there any sense in waiting
For something to come make it better?
Now we're fading out slowly, I think we know where we're going
Seasons stay the same, it's the fall of you and me

[Chorus]
We were meant to bleed
No we were never meant to be
Bleeding out together
What we're tryna figure this out for?
When we already know the outcome
It's the daeth of you and me
Yeah we were meant to bleed
We were meant to bleed

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
Me and shawty bleed like horses
They say you shouldn't hate but shit I hate to say I told you
I don't know if this love or this torture
I just know when I find you, you in shine all adorable
I shouldn't went and got you out your shell like an oyster
I shouldn't blew that money like I play [?]
I always give out good advice, but I still make the wrong choice's
Got all the money in the world, but I still can't afford this
I hit your phone too many times in a row
You caught me up too many times on a row
We've both seen the end, and we've both seen the outcome
We was tryna get even and ended up without one
Naked bitches all in my phone, if that ain't right, well I'm wrong
You always sayin' how you feel when you get on that patreon
We always knew that we would bleed just like the end of a sentence
Man I didn't even out all of these years and they're still in on my sentence
I'm like yeah
