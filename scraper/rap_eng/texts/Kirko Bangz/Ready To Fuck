[Intro]
Ready to fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm rolling up in that gold thing
This bitch is at the door mane
She giving up that dome man
Don't give my number, she know the name
That king shit that be my game
Ain't got a nigga, her ex lame
She usually dont do this
Tonight she gon' fuck with me
I beated up that pussy
That wet wet in my two seater
Her nails done, her hair did
I'mma about to mess up all of it
Just dont say another word
You wanna talk, just use your tongue
Roll over, give daddy some
I'm gon cum, you gon come like...

[Hook]
Don't it feel good?
Got you dripping down them thighs, then you gripping on the wheel
Alright
She said, "Don't it feel good?"
Then she riding on the top
She about to make it pop
She said, "Why you fucking everybody?"
I said, "Baby I be only fucking you"
She said, "Don't be fucking with nobody
I want you to myself and I want you, too"
So you know what I said
Just get on the bed
I know you want it, baby, so open your legs
I know when you're coming baby
My tongue got you going crazy
Your toes and your thighs shaking
I eat it up
She said I'm ready to fuck
Aww Yeah
She said I'm ready to fuck

[Verse 2]
Dealing with these bitches
You got to have your game tight
Cause most of them won't act right
You got know how to lay your pipe
My ex-bitch named Jordan
She pretty so spoiled
And no nigga gon love you
How I loved you, Sally Blows

Cause ain't no telling

I'm young and rich, I'm these niggas
So I give them clean dick like
