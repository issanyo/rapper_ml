Hold up
Say I got bad bitches takin pictures at my crib
They say they love a nigga style, they like the way I live
Say I got bad bitches takin pictures at my house
Red bottoms on the floor and makeup on the couch
Ay I got bad bitches takin pictures in my kitchen
That's glass house on every wall girl you can see the city
Say I got bad bitches takin pictures in my crib
They kissin on each other faithfully and sippin Hen'
Hold up

[Verse 1]
I like bitches, that like bitches
That put on the right bitches, them dyke bitches
Black, Latin, or white bitches, don't wife bitches
Not lookin for no life bitches, one night bitches
Hold up
Got a every bitch chick from Michigan keep sendin me pictures
Got a lil white bitch in my restroom and she workin my dentist
Is the Spanish chick gettin mad cause I won't giver her attention
But I can't get that hoe on time I seen her naked on Pinterest
And my couch is fulla hoes that's actin like they don't wanna be here
My wallets fulla girls that's like I wish it was just me here
And this bitch just walked in that I fucked last night
That's my ex-best friend, boy yo ass ain't right

[Verse 2]
I got bitches takin pictures in my bathroom, my shower and shit

Takin pictures on my balcony all over the rail

If yo girl get too fucked up I got place that she can lay up
We ain't gotta leave the house for on my knees I'm callin favors

You can't just get up to my floor, girl, remember that shit
Every time yo ass pull up you gotta tell the concierge
To call my phone I tell him tell you I ain't here

[Hook]
