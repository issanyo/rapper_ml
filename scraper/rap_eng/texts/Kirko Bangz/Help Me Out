[Chorus]
I grew up all alone so you can't blame me
Never had a happy home so you can't blame me
I only do what I was shown so you can't blame me
No you can't blame me, no you can't blame me
It's go hard or go home so you can't blame me
They was weak I was strong so you can't blame me
Never had a happy home so you can't blame me
No you can't blame me boy
Can you help me out with it [4X]
Cause I'm wrong and I know
Can you help me out with it [4X]
Cause I'm wrong and I know

[Verse 1]
Uh, shit I said I'm tired feeling like that I ain't worth shit
Man I'm tired of feeling like I can't have that chick
Man I'm tired of feeling like I wish I had that whip
Can you tell me how it feel when you ain't grow as shit
Or when you grow with it all and now you ain't got shit
And everytime you see your mom man she always pissed
Cause she know her only son ain't amount to shit
And every time the bills here she say you ain't buy shit
Plus you look like your dad but you ain't that rich
You ain't got that crib and you ain't got that whip
Plus you always talking back always give her the look
Give your ass a couple of years you in prison and shit
And she ain't got no worries but you ain't listening shit
Could've been a happy family and christian and shit
Had a white picket fence with a cat and a dog
But you rather be behind them walls saying

[Chorus]
I grew up all alone so you can't blame me
Never had a happy home so you can't blame me
I only do what I was shown so you can't blame me
No you can't blame me, no you can't blame me
It's go hard or go home so you can't blame me
They was weak I was strong so you can't blame me
Never had a happy home so you can't blame me
No you can't blame me boy
Can you help me out with it [4X]
Cause I'm wrong and I know
Can you help me out with it [4X]
Cause I'm wrong and I know

[Verse 2]
Say mama how you turn your back on your only s
And showed them niggas in the streets love before me
Tell me how you went missing for 4 weeks
And expect me to sit here and talk to me
How am I supposed to go to school with no school clothes
But everytime you come around you got new clothes
And you wonder why I'm stealing shit and robbing people
And then you got the nerve to tell me that I'm illegal
When you out here doing drugs tryin' to find a love
That my daddy took from you when he left us
And shit my partners hit me up they tell me hit the club
But shit I'm stealing from their cars when they hit the clubs
I'm taking everything these young niggas work for
No love in my body, heart burnt up
I don't blame it on you but you blame me
But shit I blame it on the world you can't blame me

[Chorus]
I grew up all alone so you can't blame me
Never had a happy home so you can't blame me
I only do what I was shown so you can't blame me
No you can't blame me, no you can't blame me
It's go hard or go home so you can't blame me
They was weak I was strong so you can't blame me
Never had a happy home so you can't blame me
No you can't blame me boy
Can you help me out with it [4X]
Cause I'm wrong and I know
Can you help me out with it [4X]
Cause I'm wrong and I know
