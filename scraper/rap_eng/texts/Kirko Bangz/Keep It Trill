Lay it down, lay it down

[Verse 1]
I’m doing thangs I never did before (did before)
Slipping on my pimping (pimping, pimping)
You hearing thangs you never heard before (heard before)
But I say girl you tripping
You know I’m out here with all of my niggas baby
We ain’t doing no tripping baby (tripping baby)
So why you tryna play me?
Cause if you read between the lines,
Your past is bad as mine
So baby let’s keep it trill, trill

[Hook]
Now girl I know you got me (got me)
You know I got you too (got you too)
Them other women they be bopping you (bopping you)
But girl I’m feeling you, lady

Hatin’ ass nigga talkin’ bout me
Everywhere you go, there’s another ho
Like how she know shit about me
I know you doubt me
But just to keep it trill
I heard about you too
So baby girl let’s keep it real

[Verse 2]
Oh, and these 2 women looking real fine
And I can have them to myself
But now this girl blowing up my line
But shit, she talking to herself
She say, you can run the streets with your thugs
I’ll be waiting for you, (you)
Until you get through (get through)
But don’t say it if you ain’t bout it babe

[Hook]
Now girl I know you got me (got me)
You know I got you too (got you too)

Lay it down, lay it down baby

Lay it down, lay it down baby

[Bridge]

Don’t listen to, what the people say
They don’t know about, bout you and me
Get it out your mind, cause it’s jealousy
They don’t know

[Hook]
Now girl I know you got me (got me)
You know I got you too (got you too)
Them other women they be bopping you (bopping you)
But girl I’m feeling you, lady

Hatin’ ass nigga talkin’ bout me
Everywhere you go, there’s another ho
Like how she know shit about me
I know you doubt me
But just to keep it trill
I heard about you too
So baby girl let’s keep it real
