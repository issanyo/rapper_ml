Big K.R.I.T.:
Yung krilla shawty
101 wit it, wat you mean, you know?
Another southern player out ya decka peep the flow
Numero uno ? with the tweets
A lowland dragon but Leeroy gotta peep the glow
Out the trunk
Don't mess around in his whip
Dodgin them law like I'm in the matrix
If you was a winner you know how it is
The gettin awards and forgettin your chips
Unh
I got a ? in the body shawty monkin so good she can squeeze a Benz about it
Talkin top drops, some see it
Throw some rims around it
Shut the ? and check cuz
I'm the only one that been about it lately
Golden child wavy
Give me the knife so I can cut the cake that they pay me
Only and I play for the team, they can't trade me
God and intel and they gave me what made me
Uno
Slammin the door like sumo
For all the time hatas was hatin' cause I was uno
24k to gold, like a Bruno
Choppin these blades on 4 they call it Kubo
For real
All I ever wanted was a
And they candy-painted you can't touch but might spill
On the curb
Catch her bein real wide, ya heard
We're weighin down 8th st's wang and swerve

Who don't want it, who don't wanna be 1
The top, wit it who don't wanna see 1
A legacy, who don't wanna leave 1
If you ain't uno in the game you ain't seen nothin
