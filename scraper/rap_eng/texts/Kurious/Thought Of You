[Verse 1: Kurious]

[Verse 2: The Audible Doctor]

We've been holding this up for years and ya'll can't even raise your hands
Like you in class embarrassed in front of your peers
I'm done dumbing it down son, the sound you hear
Was designed to avoid leaving a void between your ears
And while they toying with my fears I be destroying every stage that I stand on
And planned on this as my career
Except it seems that no matter where my dreams at with these cats
It's more about a fad than a fan that can hear
The true meaning, I've been through feuds with a few demons
Leaving worn down souls/soles like shoes leaning
Believe it
You semen/see men spit like hoes without the kleenex
And then wonder why the seeds hit the cement
Out in the street with nobody to teach kids
Stop buying that weak shit support something decent
I preach this
And each and every time you reach for a record
Be sure you check for the B-B-A-S bitch respect it
They ain't listening
I grip the pen tight and write till blisters end the session
Sending tension up my tendons just to represent
I've gotten ill at this, I don't mean that I'm nice
I mean I've literally gotten sick from staying up nights
Just trying to write and make beats for weeks at a time
He's tight but he can't speak over beats when he's dying
And it's trying his emotions that nobody know his name
He's just in it for the rent and utilities fuck the fame
It's a shame how you put your love in to something so much it sucks
The best you get is independent spins for a couple months
Before you bumped talking bout all the things in your past
But Andre told me boy you only funky as your last cut
And that's what keep me running like I got a target on my back cuz
One track won't last for the masses ask us
Where we gonna be in a few
I tell them I don't know but this what flows when I thought of you
