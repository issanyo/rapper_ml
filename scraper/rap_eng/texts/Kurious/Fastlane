[Verse 1: Biolante/Kurious]
Only god is judge, never plea the case
Always aware of the truth we could never erase
Fallen from grace black North face
Ounce of green smoke, jack wit no chase
Peddle on the floor, thirsty for score, Fastlane
Destination: top of the cash game
Seek heat like a missle with mad aim
You can't blame
Missin spirits who campaign
A mystery at most, universal most stee is hot
Yup more often then not!
Vision clear like a Hindu with the third eye dot
We be weak...nah baby that's my word I got
Nuff rhymes, tuff times try talkin to kids
Who walk around thinkin that (God) doesn't forgive
Life in itself is like a bid
And if you scared to die then you scared to live
Ain't it a shame dealin with the remain
Hennessy on the brain, travel the plane

[Hook: Biolante]
Will the copy cats twist the def traps
Bliss the sex raps, blind to jet black
Matters awake in response since came to life
Singin a seance, escape the realm
Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

[Verse 2: Biolante]
Cruisin' in the Lex out the window seat
While I be trippin' off the rhyme, bop my head to the beat
I can't speak on delirious mood swings
True crowns, are handed to true kings
Tell ya take it back, straighten, money makin'
Vital sign: Awaken. Idle minds go to Satan
No debatin' on the vestle that we navigatin'
Gravitatin', schemin', leave 'em standin' waitin'
Specialize in futuristic mental picture paintin'
We are slave to sick ways, I'm quenchin' with thirst
Gift of a new day they seem like a curse
What we made, penetrate the charade
The incision is barely felt from the sharpness of the blade
Movin' motionless through this masquerade
Loomin' in the dark, but just to save a spark (Rock)
Like a match made in Heaven and Hell apart
But still one, if it's life we start
So real, reveal, sign is sealed
What we feels translates to meals
That 9-to-5 shit is no joke, muscle in
Scientist, but don't look down upon my hustlin'

[Hook: Biolante]

"Look at them, those two space monsters. The one with the three heads is King Geedorah
And that one's Gigan. We are controlling them."
