S-U-B, R-O-C
El Muerto Cucaracha to the highest degree

Fresh out the box, in comes the loot
PSYCH cause it don't, I flaunt the tactic, climactic styles
No I won't go out the back like the vermin
I'm burnin, all sucker MC's whose hittin switches like Erick Sermon
Easier-rider provider of the old school shit
The tool gets hot when it's shot
Droppin shit on the mic, like faggots do in their drawers
When they see my silhouette, surprise, the props is yours
Blue light soars, speed to the heavens
Seperate your body from this piece of shit we live in
You're back to the essence we will always miss your presence
See you later in bliss, for now I leave ya with this..

Anticipation of the groove makes me go RRRRAHH
Kurious the brainiest spontaneous, NAH
On the real Sub, tell me yo yo, why they be buggin?
They shoulders should be sore from the nuts that they be huggin
Never payin tolls, cause I don't own a car (worrrrd up)
Tell a bitch if she wanna bone a star
To ride my dick to the moon like a rocket
Already got a girl, bitch you need to stop it
My dog, I lock this up
I know you're laughin only wish that I could reach ya
If I get my shit correct, I'm guaranteed to meet ya
But you're back to the essence we will always miss your presence
See you later in bliss, for now I leave ya with this..

You tell me, "What up, hops?" I say that's what Jordan got
You think I'm a superstar? Nah, can't afford a lot
Of shit cause my pockets is fucked
Welfare style, why smile? Here stops the bucks
Aww shit, make way for the prolific charismatic
Hispanic, Puerto Rican Cuban plus a functional addict
Rehabilitation is needed
Got soul cruise control at 55, never speeding
The ticket, you stick it, crevice, is anal
Try to match up parallel, and yo the pain will
Make you cringe, but the joint is dedicated
To my man up top, none other than Subroc
Takin time machine trips, go back and correct shit
Roughed up a beat, I freestyle on some next shit
You're back to the essence we will always miss your presence
See you later in bliss, for now I leave ya with this..
