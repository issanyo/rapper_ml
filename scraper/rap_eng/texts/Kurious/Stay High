HOOK
Stay High
So you could start your day right
Stay High
So you could have a good night
Stay High
You can always shine bright

BRIDGE
How high can you go 4x

Verse 1
All soured up febreeze
Do it with such ease something like a disease
Doc emergency got my head in the trees
All covered in funk knock em dead then I breeze
Remnants of leaves, stalks, and bamboo
Ain't no limitations of what we can do
Parallel to puffy purple clouds of smoke
And the rhyme style that jumps out and grabs your throat
Invite your lady friend take a ride on a boat
All aboard bamboo fresh I quote
Style is ice classified sedative
Benchmark is the best but its all relative
We relatives what it is its best to give
Without even acknowledging death its best to live
Yes it is
Hey Hey

Verse 2
Now you can see the Northern Lights from the Heights
And the county of Kings plus the bounty it brings
But you don't have to get high to feel fly
Don't rely on a thing, don't rely on a thing
I feel strong just like a diesel engine
Bench pressing stress, defeat tension
Release tension
Not to mention
Another way to reach that high is when you're sexin'
Natural
Climax crescendo
Imax, nintendo, play stay 360
We rock a show, perform and get doe
Don't wast potential
Its monumental
When they legalize budd, i'll have a pocket full of fuzz
But I get the greatest buzz when my sun gives me a hug
Kiss and high five
