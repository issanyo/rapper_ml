[Verse 1:]
(hey) [x6]
Uh, yea yea 212 DJJS1 if hip hop was a lady we couldn't tell
(Let me tell yuh sum’thing) I was so disrespectful
Neglectful apologize for every single time
I Try to let you feel less special see
I understand why you ignore me wen I text you enough
And not open tha door more mature
I’m here to bless you Love is still the same no different
From where I met you  yo lil boyfriends I don’t stress you
I just let you act a lil fancy and the rest become daddy
Great smile but please know rejections are in a fatty
Vision your beauty bring down to earth no need to chase glamour
Or gain your self worth you use to always tell the truth girl
You were so raw and u still got it in ya
I know dis fo’sure we jus gotta bring you out in music
Cause it's not guaranteed you still love wen I take ma thing
Out toast yo glass may I have the next dance
N like biggie yo gone gimme one more chance

[Chorus:]
(I say she loves me she loves me not) [x3]
Acting like she loves me not I know she loves me, she loves me not

[Verse 2:]
Let me tell you bout  this life hip-hop is sorta like a bipolar chick
Wen you think she got it lock she wanna get confola
Shit now am i to provide on this rollacoasta
Ride with all the peeps and vallies see its wat
It is like a royalty check from prison bet you continental
With the steel missing Craig G, Js1 know how it is hip-hop
Are like car accidents go out and light yo flairs
Fake thugs dancing for crooks and fellas doing one- way
Hip-hop getting on the hooks while models plans back and forth
And type and managers go both ways and might ben em like beckham
Had a few days for mic checking they so far from between
That truckle where collecting she blowing up my phone
Ignore that sucks i know we made plans but I stood her ass up
And since yo thirsty to blow I let her pursue cause honestly I got sumn betta to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Huh- shit yo JS1 she love me? wa could she be?
Delirious we started of as fuck buddies not serious
I was a young boy from the park sum are sadly lying
In the dark there was some b-boys cuttin it up b-boys
B-girls fuckin it up so I step up to her and say yo can i be daddy
One day nigga crown yea its the best a rap she said he gettin
It if I had a chance lady yu hands my love could dance a flashback
Just how we begin this chick be cooking thin
She messed with alot a fags so I don't owe her sometimes
I don’t control watch how to control her
(sober) x2
Let me tell ya something
Chorus
(I say she loves me she loves me not) x3
Acting like she loves me not I know she loves me, she loves me not

[Outro:]
You know this game is fucked up crazy mayne you know I mean
Can you tell me what's going on uh I mean can you tell me what's going on
Uh can you put it together for me oh mayne
