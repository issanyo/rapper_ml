[Chorus]
It's been too long (too long, too long)
Waiting for your love (waiting for your love)
It's been too long (too long, too long)
Waiting for your love (waiting for your love)
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
(I'm on the way)
Fuck what they say, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
(I'm on the way)
Fuck what they say, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah

[Verse 1]
Fuck what they say, I've been waiting for days
People they always portray a picture imperfect
Some things are worth it
When you came along I was swayed
I know tomorrow ain't promised today
I know my actions don't always convey
What I've been feeling inside but I feel it's time that I let you know it can't wait
Soon as I hop off the plane it's a wrap
You ain't gotta ask, I know what you want though
Why waste a moment to even unpack
I'ma leave my bag sitting by the front door
All of this talking, we using up time
You can come first, we ain't gotta rush tho
Three thousand miles you been on my mind
I can care less if the neighbors wake up though, they know

[Chorus]
It's been too long (too long, too long)
Waiting for your love (waiting for your love)
It's been too long (too long, too long)
Waiting for your love (waiting for your love)
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
(I'm on the way)
Fuck what they say, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
(I'm on the way)
Fuck what they say, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm on they way so you know it can't wait
What we gonna do it's not up for debate
Call up your manager, tell 'em you handling personal business and you gon' be late
Matter of fact tell 'em you workin' from home
We can keep goin' while you on the phone
Long as it's muted, they'll never dispute it
This can be our little secret we grown
You ain't gotta run it by nobody
All dressed up that's for show probably
I been on the road so long going hard
Now I'm working overtime on your body
Just punched out, but you know it don't stop
Even when I'm gone, shit I'm still on the clock
I can turn right back around and be right back in town before you even get a chance just watch, you know

[Chorus]
It's been too long (too long, too long)
Waiting for your love (waiting for your love)
It's been too long (too long, too long)
Waiting for your love (waiting for your love)
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
(I'm on the way)
Fuck what they say, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
(I'm on the way)
Fuck what they say, yeah
I'm on the way, yeah
