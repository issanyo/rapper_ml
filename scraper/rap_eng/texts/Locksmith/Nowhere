[Intro: One.Coco]
I don't think it's anyone's fault
And I love you with all of my whole heart
I guess chemistry was all that we thought, love was
Lately I've been trying so hard
To communicate to you all my thoughts
So I figured I would sing you this song, I wrote you

[Verse 1: One.Coco]
You said, "I'll never leave ya"
I said, "Yes, I believe ya"
I just need [little boyfriend?]
I said, "I'll quit smoking"
You said, "Here's one more token"
And I said, "We're going no where"
I'm like, "Why is it so hard for me to be a woman?"
"Why are you going out, and why am I not invited?"
"Why is it so hard for me to be a woman?"
Really baby, get that deal out of your head
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahhh
No one told me loving you would be this hard

[Hook: One.Coco]
Nowhere
Nowhere

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
We never had a problem we couldn't fix or assist to
You never had a reason to wave your fist, I'd remiss to
The cause and accusations, and general lack of patience
If I say I needed a switch, you'd hiss and try to take issue
But I can see what's underneath, and I can see it building
But I won't let you come at me with spots you could've filled in
Sacrifice for free, but I know half the time it's me
I don't want to live inside the past, so I look past it casually
I don't want to be your casualty, trying to go to war for us
If you've never spent the time, then you can't afford the trust
I was on a tour for months, trying to sift through all her filters
That she posted on her page to engage full of rage, going (nowhere)
Fast on the path we both collided
You can't expect the truth, if it's lies that I invited
I don't want to be that guy, I don't want to look you in your eyes
I don't want to have to cut this off and cut you off, I'm not surprised, going

[Hook: One.Coco]
