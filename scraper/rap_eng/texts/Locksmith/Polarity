[Verse 1: Zumbi]

Dark versus light, good versus evil
Man versus woman, planet Earth upheaval
Jew vs. Muslim, Norte Sur, Blood versus Crip everywhere more war
Primitive man versus civilized savage
One's a Pope and the other one lives lavish
Light skin versus dark skin, East versus West
Blessed with balance or you're cursed with stress
Much success or pray your life possessed but
Many are afraid to face life's true tests (huh)
Spirit over flesh, Hard to make it manifest
The government will press the best and brightest
G-O-D got a place inside of me
But it's Church versus State, and they hate it when you're free
The opposition might rock your brain
The universal is a circle and everything soon change

[Hook]

The world never changed for me
It's the same in the place to be
The world never changed for me
It's the same in the place to be

The world's made of opposites
Opposites are the world, are the world, are the world

[Verse: Macklemore]

We can appear the opposite, or wish that we were them
Either hate them or be the lies, that other people live
Contrast the human when you see the soul behind their skin
Take away the pew and see they pray like them
Maybe the cross and the Qu'ran isn't so different
Maybe these lines are make believe and the opposite is pretend
Just a man-made law with a flaw in that gem
I give you the truth and everyone else is sin
Get off it, thinkin' that perspective is godsend
I'm from the city where they invented the mosh pit
And when I fell my people they pulled me up
And told me you got a job to do it's all part of the process
I needed to starve, before I could eat again
I needed addiction to learn what freedom is
Lost perspective so I had to fix a lens
To learn that a leader knows himself and the opposite

[Hook]

The world never changed for me
It's the same in the place to be
The world never changed for me
It's the same in the place to be

The world's made of opposites
Opposites are the world, are the world, are the world

[Verse: Locksmith)

Uh, feels good to do a feature
With someone I respect that I honestly have a keeper
Sense of admiration I'm activating my artistry
To sacrifice style and show you a different part of me
Pardon me when I part the sea with my verse
Niggas selling they soul to hear me converse
It's hard to bare, when people pay me to share
But I always put musical marriage before commerce
Bomb first like Pac in his day, like I'm rocking his Jays
Hawk in your face, Copy display
I'm lyrically polished freeing pockets of slaves
I can raise Christopher Wallace from up out of his grave
Uh, so what's the opposite of real?
If Oprah's a mammy than Tyra's a Jezebel
For ? a Diva ?
The people begging for balance but they tippin' the scale
Oh well..

[Hook]

The world never changed for me
It's the same the place to be
The world never changed for me
It's the same the place to be

The world's made of opposites
Opposites are the world, are the world, are the world
