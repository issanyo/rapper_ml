[Chorus]
It’s not a question at all
I sit and watch you put it all in these bars, they say
It’s not a doubt in my mind I see the plot
I'm looking out for what’s mine, they say
It’s not a question at all
I sit and watch you put it all in these bars, they say
I write my life in the lines
I take what’s rightfully mine, it’s no question

[Verse 1]
I used to view my worth as different
I grew up in a church  as christian
Kids threw rocks at the house we lived in
And dead rats in our backyard, who did this
Use suspicion, abusive visions, accuse the mixing
I'm used to this, but it’s useless to use wisdom
When you’ve been pigeoned
Hold and told that you’ll never amount to nothing
No potential so they sent you sent you down
An eventual spiral
I read the Bible
I quoted scriptures
I used to meet on saturdays with the jehovah's witness
We had a debate over the race in those brochure pictures
I read him my Ayat
He sighed back and said it was sickness
No forgiveness
And no credentials to make the claim
He’s just regurgitating
What he had been taught first
I’ll take the blame
I’ll take the crown
Rip out the jewels and feed the people
The one rapper to lyrically move the needle
No question

[Chorus]
It’s not a question at all
I sit and watch you put it all in these bars, they say
It’s not a doubt in my mind I see the plot
I'm looking out for what’s mine, they say
It’s not a question at all
I sit and watch you put it all in these bars, they say
I write my life in the lines
I take what’s rightfully mine, it’s no question

[Verse 2]
Every day’s a fucking gimmick
And every plays a new facade
Every master of ceremonies
A master of mirage
That is masquerading the maddest bating
The masses waiting
Emasculating any facet or portrait of blackness
That’s portraying
Agitating to tinseltown
With a stencil down
They trace with a haste
That is based on the potential found
And urban dollars and demographics do simple tactics
They taxin’ the poorest of people
The illest equipped to match it
Attach the comics we marvel at they barrage
Instead of the real life superheroes
El-Hajj Malik Shabazz, I beat the odds
Took a page from his auto bi
Thought I'd ought to try
To try find some understanding
I stand on my own
Are y’all surprised?
Y’all divided we all abias
Who’s throwing stones
Your glass house was constructed upon the mobile home (damn)
So fragile and brittle
That’s why they had to belittle
The true future is destined without a question

[Chorus]
It’s not a question at all
I sit and watch you put it all in these bars, they say
It’s not a doubt in my mind I see the plot
I'm looking out for what’s mine, the say
It’s not a question at all
I sit and watch you put it all in these bars, they say
I write my life in the lines
I take what’s rightfully mine, it’s no question
