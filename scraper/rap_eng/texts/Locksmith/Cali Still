[Verse 1]
I’m talkin’ about Richmond, California still, reppin’ my city it’s so instilled, in my soul and so it spills out with metaphors I build
Expose my ills I’m ready, women I swear I got ‘em drippin’ like I’m Levy, minute I get ‘em I got ‘em beggin’ to wed me, and those hang ups never upset me
I don’t got swag, I don’t got game, women see me and get drawn to my pain, how can I endorse what I don’t enforce, what am I in for, nothins’ in vain
Nothin’ has changed, this is just Lock, so how could lie about somethin’ I got, so you could see me as the person I am instead of pretendin’ I’m somethin’ I’m not
Or somethin’ I bought, or somethin’ I purchased, that’s your man? I heard he’s worthless, f**k with me, roll with me, she thought I was Spanish, but no I’m Persian, look girl
Young Lock from the westside, in the penthouse on the westside in the district, got the meat packed when I speak facts n***as seek that, representin Richmond incorporated in Bed Stuy
Best I, hold my own, livin’ in the east but I know my home, lyrics that’ll reach, better know your zone, women wanna speak cause they know I’m on
And she starvin’ for some, beggin’ to harbor my sons, maybe I’ll charge her for one, f**k your swag and the n***a you borrowed it from, let’s go

[Hook]
Y’all know my city, where the f**k I’m from, what the f**k I’ve done, it’s Cali Still [Repeat 4x]
Y’all know my city, where the f**k I’m from, what the f**k I’ve done, it’s Richmond, Cali Still

[Verse 2]
I’m Richmond bred, and I’m Cali grown, and I got the skills but I’m barely on and I carry on like I’m very grown, and I might hit the club but I’m there to zone
I speak baritone when I’m in it, spillin’ my soul on these songs when I live it, spittin’ for my soil, what are you a Mohel, get off my d**k n***a you ain’t Hassidic
Look how vivid I paint these thoughts, really what I’m livin’ and it ain’t just talk, some n***as came and went and they changed a bit, it’s like the pavements’ stained with chalk
But I gotta, keep it cool for my main chick, language sets the tone, I mighta left her home, you mighta found my name in your ex’s phone, I got your main chick deckin’ like I’m Westward Home
But I’m, so vicious, so valiant, my lyrics speak volumes, it consists of substances but some diss, no talent I’m balanced, well rounded, like a negative charge I’m grounded, they say it’s hard to tame, they can’t find a lane, I let the bars explain, now they found it
Astounded when I go off, learn how to win cause I studied your loss, n***as be talkin’ but most of them soft, I found your girl and then we got lost
And she starvin’ for some, beggin’ to harbor my sons, maybe I’ll charge her for one, f**k your swag and the n***a you borrowed it from, let’s go

[Hook]
Y’all know my city, where the f**k I’m from, what the f**k I’ve done, it’s Cali Still [Repeat 4x]
Y’all know my city, where the f**k I’m from, what the f**k I’ve done, it’s Richmond, Cali Still
