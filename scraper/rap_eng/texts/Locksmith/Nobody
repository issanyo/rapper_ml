[Intro]
Listen
(Kato on the track bitch!)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Think about the moment when your boy was unemployed and I couldn't pay the fucking rent
Started making music but it wasn't making money so I used it as a way to vent
Had to take a loan from my father I was bothered I was harboring some ill intent
He'll admit, never thought we'd make it this far his bars got a way of shaking things, I can feel this shit
That was it, thinking back to '05 when I had that '05 so far I had set a precedent
I was with my cousin at the dope spot when the foe shot loved ones and the killers had the crescent lit
And I've been focused ever since, credit go to Nessa told me, "nigga don't be hesitant"
I done made more in this last half year then I did in my career, really that is no embellishment
I don't give a fuck about nobody else opinion, what nobody else is penning, I ain't swimming in the shallow end
I remember when they tried to tell me I could never make an album independent that was sick unless I followed them
But I could never follow trends, I just keep it honest, I don't play into the politics
I be having bitches, I ain't even got to try
They applying for positions like their vying for a scholarship
I done been, all up in the midst of the miscellaneous misses that try to visit his business but diss him heinous
This is the business ain't it, shit is anticipated, they want me to go at rappers but get no participation and uh
Fuck y'all really want to prove? Bobby Fischer, I can see your next 'hunnid moves
Trying to creep up on a player but I'm so in tune
And you used to talk about it, I'm the fucking truth

[Pre-Hook]
I know this scene, I know what to do
They follow my lead, they watching my moves
Think about me, now worry about you, and shit y'all could do
Y'all in the game, but I make the moves

[Hook]
I fuck with nobody
I fuck with nobody
These niggas talk more than these bitches
These bitches will catch you a body
I fuck with nobody
I fuck with nobody
These niggas be cuffing these bitches
These bitches be off catching bodies

[Verse 2]
I've been in certain bars where I was  diverted from
What I would initially do whenever the burden comes
Or whether or not I want to respond, play it off as a qualm, or calmly disregard and infer upon
Upon further review, I was unnerving a few niggas that tried to tell me I wasn't deserving I knew
What I was up against, so I would succumb intense
Personal adverse, the worst was self induced
I don't recall a time, that I was at all given
What I did not earn so I'm not at all smitten
By your concern at any negative term that you disguised as love, but shovel shit when I'm not looking
While you was onlooking, I steadily grew a team
Started to get attention, but that could be too extreme
Sort of a lucid dream, nothing you used to seeing
Look in my inbox, and nigga it's all women
I just continue to fill up these venues and murder these stages, I'm getting my bread
I am no longer dependent on niggas I have no more worries, I'm thoroughly fed
I made decisions to make some revisions to people in my life, so some of them fled
Makes me no difference if you show resistance we heard your opinions now lay in your bed
Mention my name and they react the same
I struggled and bled for the shit that I've done
Everything up to this point, good or bad, regardless it made me the man I've become
I find it fitting how someone who's sitting so comfortably has an opinion on us
Your vision is clouded with whom you surrounded, what you think of me, I do not give a fuck

[Hook]
I fuck with nobody
I fuck with nobody
These niggas talk more than these bitches
These bitches will catch you a body
I fuck with nobody
I fuck with nobody
These niggas be cuffing these bitches
These bitches be off catching bodies

I fuck with nobody
I fuck with nobody
These niggas talk more than these bitches
These bitches will catch you a body
I fuck with nobody
I fuck with nobody
These niggas be cuffing these bitches
These bitches be off catching bodies

I fuck with nobody
Bitches will catch you a body
I fuck with nobody
These niggas be cuffing these bitches
These bitches be out catching bodies

[Verse 3]
Look
Look
I don't fuck with none of y'all, I be on my own shit
Niggas always rap about it, but they never own shit
I don't see the point in me pointing out any difference in niggas I wouldn't mention let alone get along with
On with the thought of proceeding people be reading
Deep into what they need, so sorry this where I leave you
Nothing more I could feed you, witnessed what I had weaved through
Good for nothing, but talking, but nigga we don't believe you
Head to, this is just a preview, niggas act worse than these hoes, they deceive you
You ain't gotta say a single word, I can read you
Yeah they show love, but they really want to bleed you
And we do, what it is that we do feel, usually the fake ones claiming that they too real
They just keep talking and running they mouth like a hobby
That's probably the reason I fuck with nobody
