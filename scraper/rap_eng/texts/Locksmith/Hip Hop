[Intro: Locksmith]

Oh I'd like to think just a moment
And dream my dream
Whoa
Dream my dream
Whoa
Yeah, I want to thank everybody
For coming out today
You could've been anywhere
But you're here with me
Rappers love to say that shit don't they?
Look, yo

[Verse 1: Locksmith]

I used to think rapping was just an outlet
(But I found it)
I used to think talent wouldn't amount shit
(But I'm grounded)
I used to cruise in 6'4
Like Dr. Dre in Dre Day
Before I grew to 6'4'
(Hello)
I used to want to rap like Nas
But when I laid my first track
I kinda rapped like Pras
Then I studied up on rap
And started to back my cause
Back my bars
Watch my talent stack like cars
I had to rely on me
And figure out my own plea
In love with the rhyme
The next time was all eyes on me
I started to spit and they started
To pick on me like I don't bleed
And what do you know
I found a niche
No surprise on me
Still there's love in my heart
I don't hate no nigga
Sorta like the first time you heard
"Ain't no nigga"
Gave you a certain vibe
That make you want to take a ride
Just happy to be alive and stay on pace
My nigga
From the Bay to LA
From LA to NY
From NY to the South
From down South to the Chi
We was drug dealing just to get by
Still managed to finish school
And fill my mama with pride
All drama aside
No hesitation I planned it
Tried to endear what I revered
My maturation from a stand
Through dedication I withstand
The ills where trauma lies
Traumatized
Understand I'm hip hop personified
(Hip hop personified
Drug dealing just to get by
I used to want to rap like Nas) (x2)
