(Pre- Hook) (Locksmith)
Oh us MC’s we hate you
We’ll ruin, erase you
Cause you do what we can’t do but, That’s my-
Oh us MC’s we hate you
We’ll ruin, erase you
Cause you do what we can’t do but-

(Hook)
That's my BAD (5x)
That's my-
BAD

(Verse 1) (Legible)
When I step in the booth the mic is on and I get in this mood
The lights are dark and my beat selection is too
Phenomenon- I'm spittin' the truth
Like Comicon you follow suit while I ensue
To end you
It's not my fault that I'm better than you
Intendin' to do some demolition to every written you've ever produced
Don't step to me boy
Lyricism is my weapon of choice
Cut your head in two, I got you makin' split decisions
Flowing over different rhythms
The tension is buildin'
Pushing my mental limits
I Meant it different- that's essential, driven to be better than the writtens of the veterans I listened to
When I was in my elementary system
Develop a vision- takin’ instrumentals and flip ‘em
Into professional sets of lyrics, flows, and special delivery
Like overnight shipping but I'm the glitch in the system
I got infinite wisdom when I enter the buildin'
I make you question your penmen ship and I'm drillin' into any indifferent foe from their roots cause I'm the dentist of writtens
The way I'm in your head when I'm spittin'
And have your jaws drop as you're fillin' my wisdom
Protect your women and children
I’m in a vicious position
One of the illest that bring it
Exposing and spreadin' your secrets
Never been 'bout the beefin' but Legible isn't vegan
You better believe that I'm talking through my bars, like when a criminals speakin'- Wheelchair basketball, I cripple your defense
When I'm done with you they'll be saying Rest in pieces
Like Hepatitus I see (C) that I entered the rap game like stepping in concrete cause I'm only concerned about the Impression I'm leaving
But I sense that these heathens are attempting to bring me down
In an effort to express their weakness by attacking my pen till it's leaking Guess that's why I'm gettin' an inkling that they’re questioning me like:

(Bridge) (King Tat)
Why you gotta make it look so easy?
Why you got the nicest flows?
Why you always gotta beat me?
I guess you'll never know

(Hook)
That's my BAD (5x)
That's my-
BAD

(Verse 2) (Lil Perk)
?
?
English, oh
?, Oh
Somethin, somethin, somethin, somethin, my bad
I'm a better spitter uh huh, my bad
Just did it in Swahili, uh huhmy bad
You really wanna be me, uh huh my bad
RIP to every rapper, uh huh my bad

(Verse 3) (Legible)
You won’t do nothin’- you flukes come in my room duckin', excuses comin' out of your mouth But you know I’m Goin’ in like food stuffin’
I'm too much for you to stomach
I’m the dude rubbin you the wrong way like a bad misuse covered in lube but if you think I’ll let you slide like cool runnin’s
Show you my true colors
When I look at my rhyme book to try and get the truth uncovered
It’s like opening a booze cupboard
Cause every time I open my bars I try to derive proof from it
Get in the club and the whole place got “p’s and q’s” bumpin’
You’ll get a pocket check like you lose something
No hoop jumpin' - You’ll get used to runnin'
Look at my wins and just count ‘em up
I give you food for thought, but ya’ll are just out to lunch
The hate just isn’t loud enough
You lack aptitude but I’m
At a new summit- Getting views from it
Vanish into thin air as your altitude plummets
You never hit your peak and you wonder why you’re not amounting (a mountain) to much
Cut off both my hands, I’m never out of touch
I got a finger in the game and other rappers pout because-
Zach has unlimited flows
Happen to rip into those that are belligerent
Actually rappin' but talent is lacking in foes
I’m gonna kill it alone
But it isn't hard to keep your 10 toes down and keep your feet on the ground when your floor is made of haters that you beat in your rounds
Beyond a reasonable doubt I’m crafting a flow, In my Palace abode, a Fabulous home
I’m bringing my heat then you're Catching a cold
I grab your face and peel it back
Just to prove there’s more than one way to skin a cat
But-

(Hook)
That's my BAD (5x)
That's my-
BAD
