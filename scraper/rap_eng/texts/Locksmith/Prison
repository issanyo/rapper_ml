[Hook]
Everything's a lie, everything’s a prison
Everything aside you don't see the symptoms
Everything you try only feeds the system
Everything's a lie, everything’s a prison

[Verse]
The same reason why Lil Pump is eating off us
Is the same reason why Donald Trump is in office
We fail society as a whole
So how can we blame him when our president is a troll?
How can we blame kids when adults are hypocritical?
We say “do as we say, not as we do”, that's the ritual
And Kanye said slavery wasn't amalgam
And two weeks later you niggas still bought his album
I don't trust the po-po or the crack dealers
‘Cause both of them motherfuckers are black killers
Both of them motherfuckers attack niggas
Now they controlling us through our rap lyrics
Everything's a program that's programmed
They program the kids while selling their own brand
If we don't band together they banning us from existence
But you stubborn niggas still show resistance
I'm keeping the distance
The difference is that tension’s what they’re pursuing
Media outlets have outstretched past reviewing
And now the interviewers are interviewing the interviewers
They wanna be stars more than the artists they're in view of
Skewed, basically you don’t want to stand in the place of me
I would never take complacency
At the pace you lead I would ache and bleed
I would take your plea I would shave debris
Make decrees, you want them
How perfect must a black kid be before we feel free to mourn him
Born into poverty, liberation is property
Limitations are properly put in place even I can see
Everything's a bureaucracy, everything from Barack
To the current day cabinet they just look for the cash in it
Educated through YouTube, it's brutal
The literary standard for information is Google, it's futile
The internet is our classroom graduate from your bathroom
And spew stupid shit like a gas fume
Assuming you can make the way
I’mma have faith and embrace my fate
I'mma make way for the days I prayed
I will raise my great and escape your bait
I'mma state what's fake, I'mma stake my claim
Ignore y'all, take my aim
You could build walls, imprison us all
When karma come back you can't debate
I speak for what's pressing and feed from aggression
No need to discretion, I peak when niggas least would expect it
I leaped in the metrics, creeped up with a gleeful expression
A lethal obsession, so even in defeat there's progression
I'm like

[Hook]
Everything's a lie, everything's a prison
Everything aside you don't see the symptoms
Everything you try only feeds the system
Everything's a lie, everything's a prison
