[Verse]
If I were a motherfucker right now
If I wanna fuck her put the pipe down
Sound of her voice had a slight ounce
The feeling of revealing I was height now
Prime with a vision and the sight now
Here’s a pillow maybe you can lie down
Gave me a choice I was quite down
Would I prefer boy shorts or a night gown, I frown
On the bed in the middle
Open up her legs put her head in the little
Maybe just the tip and this was just like a tip and
She was on the rebound dead on a dribble
No problem , beat it
No condom, beat it
Like I’m gon’ eat it
Then I proceed it
Fuck the world when I’m in her canvas
Vivid strokes to her eazel’s damaged
This the life and it seems outlandish
Young and in lust we out here stranded
Candid branded when I follow
Passions as it would last in tomorrow
I don’t know girl but what I know girl
That this is no world where love is a model
What you talking about now you fucking up the mood
You didn’t did shit that your mama wouldn’t approve
You didn’t did shit that the law wouldn’t allow
You didn’t did shit I’m an ove like how
Could I ever stop I’m involved with it now
My heart is beating, our lips are grazing
Is this real love or just me craving
I just can’t take it, your soul is naked
I see you shaking, we close to breaking
Consequences ain’t shit when you
In the moment I scream out too
This ain’t something you say in jest
She turns over and says—"What’s next?"
