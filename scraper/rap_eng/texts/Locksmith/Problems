[Verse 1: Locksmith]
Yeah, Locksmith, yo
My vocal expression leaves a global impression
I had loads of depression
Chasin' me like pharaoh after Moses with Stephen
On the shore with the staff in his hands
Swallowin' snakes, exposin' a fake and magic they planned
This is my testament, prophetic in nature
You can't escape what has blatantly been assigned
For something spiritually greater
Like a stick to your lungs
So your pulmonary supposed to carry
Burdens like the crosses in Palestine like a thousand times
They wanna crucify, they wanna scrutinize
Nowadays, all of the snakes wear suits and ties
They wanna see me hanginâ€™ from a noose and die
But I'm a spit the truth till ascended between the roof and sky
These other rap niggas get in the booth and lie
Till I remove 'n untie the blindfolds, but I'm told
You only as good as your last verse
So carry me with the mic in my hearse
This is Goon Music

[Chorus: Rite Hook]
I don't know if I can beat these problems
All I see is what they've done to me
And it's the only thing in front of me
I don't know if I can beat these problems
All I see is what they've done to me
And it's the only thing in front of me

[Verse 2: Skrewtape]
(This is Goon Music)
First domino fell a long time ago
Stay shining like diamonds through the drama though
Uh; It's all love, you are not alone
Seeds need light, just trying to grow
Hate being in the street late since release date
Be safe Lord, it's a police state
I'm a super cop so put one in your noodle box
All he heard was the Ruger pop off front the Lucy spot
Uh, yeah, into God's web
We're all jobless, screaming "Jah bless"
Old head played the corner like cobweb
Devil in a blue vest walking with his complex
But I don't stress we take the high road since
Read the writing on the wall, peep the high road
If you ever find yourself in a downward spiral
Just follow the Starlight, shoutout to Viro

[Chorus: Rite Hook]
I don't know if I can beat these problems
All I see is what they've done to me
And it's the only thing in front of me
I don't know if I can beat these problems
All I see is what they've done to me
And it's the only thing in front of me

[Verse 3: Rite Hook]
I'm so manic, dealing with self-inflicted damage
How many times can a mind become repaired?
After running amok in a marriage
Between caring way too much about nothing
And not giving a fuck I'm careless
Catching myself staring up at the moon
Thinking how the fuck could I think I'm so important to yous
Everybody on my path is a fucking crutch
Just to get a meaningless possession that's never enough
So, how do I know when God has entered my life?
I guess I know when I'm done questionin' life
But, it's so hard to keep a level head, the worlds cruel
I'm used to joining everybody in the whirlpool
Spinning out of control in my bottomless soul
While I'm trying to figure out if a sin is as hot as it cold
'Cause I know we made mistakes, but you know you
Gotta trust that gut feeling 'cause it's fightin' just to show you

[Chorus: Rite Hook]
I don't know if I can beat these problems
All I see is what they've done to me
And it's the only thing in front of me
I don't know if I can beat these problems
All I see is what they've done to me
And it's the only thing in front of me
