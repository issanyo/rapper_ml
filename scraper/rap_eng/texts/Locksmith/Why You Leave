"Then, one day, you said you didn't want me no more"
"Yes, you did"

[Verse 1:]
I can't believe I'm here screaming on the phone again
I can't believe I'm talkin' to you while you're home with him
You said you got home from work lil' a close to ten
And left me in the sea to coast out, now I'm supposed to swim?!
We used to walk in the same circle of social friends
So begins the struggle to figure out my approach to them
Whether I lie to they face or give a hopeful grin
I say the truth, they partner get caught bein' a hoe again
But that's the price that you pay whenever you co-depend
And you lyin' about bein' pregnant, it's like the code to sin
Being cruel to each other is bad enough, plus, it's adding up
And all this baby bullshit?! I've had enough
I try to be the man, go with you to see the fam
And break the bad news, I neva would think that this would be a scam
Till I spoke to your father, he made a plea
He said 'son, her momma did the same shit to me, we was good'

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, you dealin' with my real life story
The nigga got caught up in some real life Maury
Plus, the bitch I'm with said she will fight for me
But regardless how it end, this shit still might flaw me
You knew it was wrong, soon as you slipped it in
Why the fuck you had me drive you to the clinic, then?
What?! That nigga was busy, couldn't fit it in?
And figure you would put it on Lock and try to switch a sin?
Text messages, phone calls, e-mails
Lies, deception, stone walls, females
Put in front like a partition, a part missin'
And break it down to they friend, but omit the details
Your story is placent, you can keep yo love
Play it cool and keep it decent, love
But you love what you do, so you should keep it up
You know that bullshit that I'm speaking of
We was good
