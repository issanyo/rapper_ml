[Intro]
Introduce a little anarchy
Upset the the established order
And everything becomes chaos
I'm an Agent of Chaos

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, say goodnight to the bad guy
My squad suicidal, wave a tec at the rabbi
Swish cheese ya fucking block when I pass by
Fresh to death like I'm at my wake and I'm mad fly, yeah
Evil bastard, tie you up, you get beat with ratchets
Magneto with the heavy metal, turning G's to ashes
Turning war to war zone with these pretty new gadgets
Beat ya ass, take ya cash, then I feed ya acid
Yeah, I got the game in a headlock
I put this red dot to your lens like Deadshot
Middle finger up, I give a fuck if the feds watch
Bullet though his dreadlock, corpse smell like a egg rotten
Life shorter than a Oompa Loompa
I'm in this bitch with two bazookas
Take me to ya leader, I'ma nuke ya ruler
Nah, fuck it, I'll just shoot the jeweler
Riding through the city with some [?]

[Hook: Chris Webby]
We the Suicide Squad, we the bad guys
We sending chills up your spine when we pass by
Supervillain lifestyle, don't gotta ask why
Just run motherfucker, run run
We the Suicide Squad
We the Suicide Squad
The motherfucking Suicide Squad
So just run, motherfucker, run run

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
See we Gotham's new guardians, see the way we marching in
Wreaking havoc to the doors, back behind the bars again
Got a little Harley Quin, lighting up a parliament
Shooting rocket launchers out the windows of the car we in
Everyone of us putting in brain hours, and obtained power
Built up a name, now the games ours
Plate of filleted flounder, they'd add on my tray counter
While I'm laughing as I crash my plane in to Wayne Tower
That's what you hear on any stage I rush on
Robotic intellect in the Age of Ultron
Fire in my eyes, heavy weight, my gloves on
My knife is in my boot, with grenades and guns drawn
But then you'll see my name in the paper on page 2
On display, with a mask on my face like Bane do
Spending 28 days in a cage with a rage flu
Insane, strange, deranged and my gang is the same too

[Hook: Chris Webby]
We the Suicide Squad, we the bad guys
We sending chills up your spine when we pass by
Supervillain lifestyle, don't gotta ask why
Just run motherfucker, run run
We the Suicide Squad
We the Suicide Squad
The motherfucking Suicide Squad
So just run, motherfucker, run run

[Verse 3: Locksmith]
I'm the new religion, a supervillain, no supervision
No use of a noose, or a new submission, no suit can fit him
I'm used to these rappers and new musicians
Act out of superstition
And rap like they beggin' in the trap is a new commission
If you understand the fact I'm cool
But keep a distance, in a instance I can snap, I'm cool
Whatever you like, I pull, don't ever attack, I'm fuel
Heath Ledger, bleak weather and Ra's al Ghul
I'll be chilling at the bank, man, going where you can't, fam
Unbreakable, Bruce Willis with them paint cans
But fuck Bruce, you're more like Damian Wayne
And compared to Locksmith, you motherfuckers is Blankman
General Zod going hard on your iPod
Spittin' at the cameras, break the legs on your tripod
Snatching all the bitches, now they screaming out "My god!"
Suicide, motherfucker, that's my squad

[Hook: Chris Webby]
We the Suicide Squad, we the bad guys
We sending chills up your spine when we pass by
Supervillain lifestyle, don't gotta ask why
Just run motherfucker, run run
We the Suicide Squad
We the Suicide Squad
The motherfucking Suicide Squad
So just run, motherfucker, run run
