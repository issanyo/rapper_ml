[Intro: Sangin Sara]
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooooh

[Verse 1: Sangin Sara]
It was yesterday you was standing right besides me looking in my face saying that you love me (you love me)
Now I wonder how many yesterdays this ol' broken heart can take or will it just keep breaking (everyday)
Now I appreciate all of the times we had together, but selfishly I wish you were still here
You make me better
The place you're in has got to be more peaceful than this pain that we're facing here
Still I wish I could talk to you just—

[Chorus: Sangin Sara]
(One more time)
And I wish that I could see your face just
(One more time)
Even though you're smilin' on me, wish you could still hold me
(One more time)
Can't believe you're never comin' back home
Sometimes I feel so alone and I
Wish that I could talk to you just
(One more time)

[Verse 1: Locksmith]
April 30th, 2010
Approximately 5 PM
My world shook
The aftermath of my family was not subtle
My reaction was to climb inside a bubble
But sometimes—
Feels like you was taken for a reason so you ain't have to witness the sickness plaguing our region
You ain't have to deal with the wickedness that I'm seein'
It's crazy how we treat human beings
You won't believe it
Every week a different murder
The police just murmur
People posted up on their phone through service
We shun the truth & praise negligence
Presidential candidates that are openly prejudice
Lie for whatever, more divided than ever
Contamination in our water, people try to do better
Non-profits are non-prophets that profit off your emotions so executives can pay for their promotion
It's fucked up

[Chorus: Sangin Sara]
(One more time)
And I wish that I could see your face just
(One more time)
Even though you're smilin' on me, wish you could still hold me
(One more time)
Can't believe you're never comin' back home
Sometimes I feel so alone and I
Wish that I could talk to you just
(One more time)

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
And I'm happy it's no longer you can suffer
My one regret is that I never made you a Grandmother
But ever since I been Rappin' the likelyhood that would happen is even less
I just pray you understand, Mother
My pessimism is rightfully kept in vision
Terrified to raise a child in the land that death is given
So freely, but it's cheeky
They pillage beneath this village
And the privileged don't acknowledged that they're privileged
You mean to tell me I'm liable to go to jail if I felt the need to suceed in a business I built myself, bruh?
We work hard, our backs swelters while the rich build dummy corporations created as tax shelters
And we don't get the credit and there ain't nothin' to stand for
People pray to God & the Government for the answers
You ain't even smoke & you still died from cancer

[Chorus: Sangin Sara]
(One more time)
And I wish that I could see your face just
(One more time)
Even though you're smilin' on me, wish you could still hold me
(One more time)
Can't believe you're never comin' back home
Sometimes I feel so alone and I
Wish that I could talk to you just
(One more time)
