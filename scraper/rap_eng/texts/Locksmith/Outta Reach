[Verse 1: Locksmith]
And they use to call me light bright, half breed, white boy, Oreo, what a life right?
Fuck school, stayed home played excite bite, anything to miss class troubled by my mixed past
Little half Persian and black pupil wearing tight jeans cause mum and dad were that frugal
But mum and dad were that crucial, tryna find my way on this path when it was that useful
Their whole life was under scrutiny. A bi racial couple, couple went the fact the mutiny
Confusing me, back then it was that hard, they use to throw dead rats in our backyard
Racial slurs over the fence, a nigga love a Arab paying more than the rent
Portraying more than hits, some even say its immense, somebody save me a glimpse

[Hook: Ceek]
And there's nothing we can't do, nothing we can't see, nothing we can't reach
And there's nothing we can't find, nothing we can't lose, nothing we can't see
But its something deep inside, mountains we gotta climb, something we gotta reach
But its nothing aside of reach, something you can't show, something you can't teach

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
But they say you get attention when you light skin but right then i felt the joke, that was critical
The backlash that haunted me from my pass, i would trade it all away for one day to be invisible
Underneath the social microscope, finding labs in science class is how i would cope
Without a clique to fit in so i devote, or waste time in a situation that i revoke
The white folks said i was too black, the blacks said i was to white, the straight A students said i was too hype
And all i did was write on my desk dreaming a new life, at night i use to beat on my chest screaming a new vice
What you like is your opinion, don't expect me to referee a struggle that only few fight
Portraying more than hits, some even say its immense, somebody save me a glimpse

[Hook: Ceek]
And there's nothing we can't do, nothing we can't see, nothing we can't reach
And there's nothing we can't find, nothing we can't lose, nothing we can't see
But its something deep inside, mountains we gotta climb, something we gotta reach
But its nothing aside of reach, something you can't show, something you can't teach

[Verse 3: Locksmith]
And they use to call me light bright, half breed, white boy, Oreo, what a life right?
Fuck school, stayed home played excite bite anything to miss class troubled by my mixed past
Subjugated to be the subject, bullied by the bully's but fully wasn't above, fuck it
Tryna withstand the quicksand, the wick stands on top of the candles tip keep it lit, damn
Can u feel my insecurities, security blankets, blanket the truth without maturity
Pure is the intention and admiration, tryna navigate through my soul with no downloader or application
After waiting the [?] hauling my past with blatant disregard this facade [?]
Tryna avoid hell yeah that's adjacent when you arrive ask pastor mason

[Hook: Ceek]
And there's nothing we can't do, nothing we can't see, nothing we can't reach
