[Verse 1: Locksmith]

When I was born my mother was torn crazy, They nearly gave me away to the wrong lady
Doctor said 'sorry we didn't see that comin but there's no way in the world that he came from a black woman'
I guess I been fightin since birth
I barely had life on this earth
Already subjected to people and how they judge, Little fair skinned baby, resentment was in my blood
I would love to say things got easier I as I grew, But conflict in my family was nothing new
My parents in the kitchen, they're bitchin at one another, My brother's my role model so playing women was cool
Cool until you start mature, start to endure what is real life and finally admit when insecure
Pure honesty, promise me if you can, that you'll be there to catch me when I land, for who I am

[Chorus: Locksmith]

It's who I am
Will you be there to catch me when I land, for who I am
Need you to understand, everything I'm not made me everything I am, and if we really fam, you'll be there to catch me when I land, for who I am


[Verse 2: Locksmith]

Who I am is deeper than what they giving you, But second guessing myself was my biggest issue
For example at the B.E.T. office had an awkward conversation with one of my fellow artist
He said 'I used to rap just like you, but that was going nowhere so to help my own career had to switch it up'
Stressing he's one of my known peers, Then I realized he was projecting his own fears
Fear I had the courage of what he urges to be, So instead of showing love he'd rather discourage me
And that's how people feel when they deal with uncertainty, And certainly would place the burden on any person but he
And see it plain but can't explain the direction
You can break the mirror but can't change the reflection
Without an aim it all remains a question
Will you be there to catch me when I land, for who I am?

[Chorus: Locksmith]

It's who I am
Will you be there to catch me when I land, for who I am
Need you to understand, everything I'm not made me everything I am, and if we really fam, you'll be there to catch me when I land, for who I am

[Alt. Chorus: Rebecca Nobel]

Who I, Who I, Who I, Who I (Repeat 4x)
