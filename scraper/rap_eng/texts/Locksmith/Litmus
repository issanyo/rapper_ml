[Verse 1]
Bear witness, the highest examination of Litmus
A verbal firebomb for whatever bible you lie upon
A quiet storm, via song, I alarm
That rapper you feel for is a billboard for Viacom
By and large, I try to dodge, the fire's strong
Arm of opinions that barely follow entire songs
I was wrong, decided to write up higher psalm
Tried to buy us time, was tired and couldn't find a brawn
Non compliant soldier, I rap to a higher quota
I am bold but don't put me next to guys you hold up
You can't compare a diet cola to a ayatollah
I invoke the type of foresight that they provided Noah
No I know no boundary, fuck the clownery
Niggas be acting out, so you wonder why there's a frown on me
That's for all of the jealous niggas surrounding me
And all the accolades who would flinch at the very sound of me
Badass, curly-headed, and spoiled
Drift to Durant's Square because the drug dealers were royal
Full Louis V sweatsuit, I couldn't soil
Black medallion in the heavyweight belt made out of foil
Fake as the face to face that I faced on a daily basis from people causing my blood to boil
Fake as the reason they gave for instigating invasion, invading my father's country for oil
Toil with the thought of complacency, there's a hole in the vacancy in my soul, so I responded with latency
Lately I've been focused on more things in front of me
Fronting me if you wish 'till I put your bitch in a summary
Some of these rap niggas, resent what I've been doing
Ruin the social norm, uniform to you and
You and your fake ass social media babble
Regressing us all back to chattel
I know that I'm the difference maker, the syncopator, I sense the favor
You journalists gift the artist that's already with a major
My major was African Diaspora
So my response is laughter, every time you quote a rapper
I know the fascination begins with a lack of patience with pen
And the fact you pacing within, so I'm back and bracing my sins
Back displaying my faults only because I'm wiser
A reservoir for boss sprouted out of a geyser
Self guided, I felt slighted, I dealt flyers on windshields, pursuing your dreams can cost a lot
Fantasies on how the bosses talk, you know
Exotic belts from animal pelts, ocelot
I was taught better to cross the block, whether you lost or not
Whether you weather it all and toss the thought, if ever you watch the pot
I've been, prosecuted and profited from
Now I just watch with an understanding and stand in my spot 'till it's done
