Intro:
(Skiiiwalker, tell me baby)
Yeah
Locksmith on the track..
(Chuckles)
Yeah X4

Verse 1:
Your boy goin cray, its the lab stock
Your ex ivus'icase, me I laughed at him
Buy 2 trays, of that Savanah dry
Bought your medi Tanqueray then copped the man stuff
Thats a bottle Hennessy, yeah that Pac stuff
Hope your medi ain't around, when it pops off
Might break a nigga confidence, when its car talk
Coz I pull up with a V-dub, vrrr-pha

Hook:
You never know
Might fuck around and put that pussy on a
Pedestal
Might fuck around and let your medi show me
What it do
Might take your mami from the hood into the
Avenues, to the better view
X2

Verse 2:
You never know
I might put that pussy back up on the pedestal
Take you places, you gon lie
And say you been before
I'm not the type to tell a lie and say I've done it all
No bambekisa talk
If I was signed to the Roc
Then I'd be walking tall
Now what they doin' with a rapper
That nobody know
But those that do
They claim the boy will be the best of all
The day he drops the ball
I swear the nets will fall
Slow it down, slow it down
For the autotune
I think these rappers should be giving me more gratitude
That its a gift that I don't go as hard as I should too
I think about the ladies bru'
She cums first, so if a bra hatin', I dunno
Probably coz his medi singin to me, high notes
I don't need to switch it up, its just the way it goes
Baby touch your toes
Bend it over, buss it open for me like a pro

Hook X4

Outro:
Skiii with the heavy metal
All my bands on key
Skiii the new gepetto pulling strings only
Swear I'm Donatello with the purple on me
Put the pedal to the metal
Never runnin' on E
X4
