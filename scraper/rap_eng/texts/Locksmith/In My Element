[Verse 1]
Back in my element, under Hell I've went
No embellish, that hellish stint swellin' myself was tense
Forced out like the Palestinian settlements
Or, underdeveloped American kids with melanin
Mail him his reparations my reputation proceeds the cause
Congratulations that adulation received was forced
A small portion of philanthropic abortions that border upon
Payin' your dues or payin' extortion
I've been through some tribulations
Truthfully I'm not used to this kind of pressure, I'm tryin' to contribute patience
Trespassin' and trippin' over my trepidations
The more success, the more you gotta expect frustration
That's what my conscious said
The common thread that is constantly being wound is being expounded upon what I was fed
They said I was dead they said I was done they said I was finished
I followed my purpose, resurfaced without a blemish

[Chorus: Sample]
"Back in my element"
"Back in my element"
"Back in my element"
"Back in my element"

[Verse 2]
I used to want a "Locksmith" chain, flooded with diamonds
Fully encrusted, constructed as a reminder
To bind the future and present, a preparation for what is brewin'
Most of these artists artificially do end up in ruin
I'm doin' my diligence, 12th grade I was militant
Seducible, rippin' out pages of The Crucible
Crucifying my English instructor bein' disruptive
A meeting with my parents, apparently I'm destructive
I'm cuffin' my overalls and we overall in agreeance
Inspiration was stifle, I rightfully have a grieveance
I'm grievin' over my mother and my grandmother's passin'
You holdin' up so well, fuck off, thank you for askin'
I'm baskin' in every moment, but momentarily sulkin'
I sip the Kool Aid, but you motherfuckers are gulpin'
They said I was dead, they said I was done they said it was facts
I followed my purpose, resurfaced without a scratch

[Chorus: Sample]
"Back in my element"
"Back in my element"
"Back in my element"
"Back in my element"
