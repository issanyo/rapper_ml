[Verse 1: Locksmith]
They say "Lock you need a hook, better find a way and make switch"
Go find you some famous friends and hang around who they see fit'
But i do not feed into hype or liking myself to be such
I just rap about my life, to some people that's not enough
Fuck your preconceptions, I don't wanna live inside your box
I see rapping as a vessel, another extension, it's just my thoughts
If you walked a mile in his shoes, you would identify with issues
That would put you in such depression
You would be thankful of what you got
Lost in the vaults of another one's bitter-ness
It could never be resolved so consider
This my final word, if you find the nerve then it's find to serve
So don't limit, here I'm the result of a revolt in your deep soul
Didn't think so, how's that?
Soon as I compromise that my conscious dies
And you flee and I'm stuck in this trap
People expect you to worship their wealth
Follow them blind and don't think for yourself
Soon as you stand on your own and demand what is known
Then they try to play dumb or they bail
I see it all as means till it ends
Rejected and misunderstood by my friends
Viewed as a loose cannon, candid, branded, but abandoned
Let it sink in, let it begin, this what I've been
I feel no need to concede or pretend
I been too humble with niggas
I think they forgot what I'm capable of is a sin
So I send you my best, you can take it as jest
My arrogant ways, left me stuck in a mess
Trapped in the middle, an assassin of riddles
I pity you niggas trying to get a pass
When I fiddle the lyrics and metaphors
Measure chords, ate a nigga like a set fours
Men will pause when I get him in his pores
Pussy nigga going through what is menopause
Would've been, blew up, but I'm in forest full of jealous ass dudes
That was on the same team had to leave
Now I'm going through a metamor-phosis
On my fourth, fifth disc, but I forfeit this like a forklift is
When I force this shit down your throat, then spit
When I fuck girl, you gonna report this dick
Matter fact, never could afford this shit
Flows under water like a porpoise is
And my purpose is to abort this kid
Pride is a whore I divorced that bitch
Murdering niggas running through rappers like marathon
I can smell the bitter-ness in everything you're baring on
Then they tried to tell me slow it down, cause I'm barely on
Going over niggas heads like a carry on
Carry on with the flow, that's the insight
I can tell by your bitch, you the simp type
If a nigga wanna test, here's the invite
A warning, warn him, you contend like
Rap niggas say trap ain't rap, trap niggas say rap don't pay
Simpletons wanna label what's art
Still I represent both either way
Still it represents social decay
Honestly what's the most you can say?
I just speak from the heart and forget about any falsehood I'm supposed to portray
Niggas log onto their pages and lie to their friends while gassing them on social media
They deny their vulnerable side instead of what's real cause posing is easier
I suppose it's a start, exposing my woes on this road I embark
Imposing my vocals on locals and ignorant moguls the same while I'm making mark
