[Hook]
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
We' walking

[Verse 1]
And he was barely 17, started studying music and delve deeper
Had an infection for voice inflection and firm beliefer
No speech for the trappers he's more concerned with the Trapper Keepers
Keepin' his raps in his binder, out of the sight of teachers
He speaks to the kids that he's familiar with
Roamin' the halls, haulin' his ass to his class like a chameleon is
Blendin' with the student body and body and [?] decides
He looks at life through a lens without a social bias
It's buyin' him time so he can find what his purpose is
His average grades are a barricade to a certain bid
Asserting himself is a luxury that he can't afford
His mental health's a concern, his family just ignores
He found solace in the promise of the instrumentals
He downloaded on YouTube, it's incidental
He studied 2Pac, Biggie, Wu-Tang and all the masters
A wealth of knowledge, decided to write another chapter

[Hook]
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
We' walking

[Verse 2]
Fascinated by the culture he sat on his granny's sofa with his headphones
Fully attached to his ears, smearing a red tone
A tactical game to aim controllers at the television
Compared to friends, his taste in music is very different
He's into the boom bap, it's safe to assume that
Makes him a pariah, an outcast and an outlier
He tried to conform, but it's false in his inclination
He likes to feel a challenge, his peers appear impatient
He's pacin' between his house and the train station
Homies from the block seem shocked when they hear him makin' the same statement
Fuck the beat if the lyrics ain't sayin' nothin'
You can lean on the lean but I'd rather wait for some substance
Somethings brewing beneath the surface
He said it's got to be more than life to fucking and getting high, we need a purpose
We need to purchase some shelter until the pain stops
Until then, I'll be walkin' between the raindrops

[Hook]
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
Walking between the raindrops
Waiting for you when the pain stops
We' walking
