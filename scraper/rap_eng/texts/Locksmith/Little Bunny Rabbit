[Verse 1: Locksmith]

I ain't gotta yell, i ain't gotta shout
I ain't gotta a deal, I'm without a doubt
The realest nigga from this desolate region
Without a beacon while they sleepin on the (little bunny rabbit)
And niggas jump the ship, they get a slit between a set of doors
Sacrifice my life for it, how you tryna leverage yours?
Trade lyrics for gimmicks to feed a money habit
Now you wish you listened to this (little bunny rabbit)
So mainstream, mediocre niggas you can suck a dick
Ever since my momma died I've been on some other shit
I'm orphan in my brain, i release endorphins in my veins to record the metaphors that i sustain
Aimed at your silly jingles, major labels are strip clubs, the only thing they really throwing out is singles
Mingle with devil if you need a status or feel havoc from the motherfuckin (little bunny rabbit)

[Hook: Locksmith]
So now I'm screaming out fuck the whole world with a long pipe
Its just me and my buddy plotting all night
Life in my review, now i got a clear view
Here to strike fear with my (little bunny rabbit)

So now we screaming out fuck the whole world with a long pipe
Its just me and my buddy plotting all night
Life in my review, now i got a clear view
Here to strike fear with my (little bunny rabbit)

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Uhhh, little bunny rabbit they don't understand you, they don't see the troubles and the struggles that demand you
They just want to put you in a box and try and brand you, lyrically they know there's really nothing they can do
And you down with a respected veteran who took you under his wing to bring you more fans, true
If you succeed they recede and want to can you, deep inside them niggas really know that they fans too
When nans flue got worse the nurse planned to send us home early, we thought she was being funny dammit
Then we noticed you dying, i started crying, you looked down and said be a good (little bunny rabbit)
Momma why you leaving me? why the fuck you wheezing? we need to get a doctor here look how shes breathin b
And we can she that shes gone then its tragic, time to grow up no more (little bunny rabbit)

[Verse 3: Locksmith]
Uhhh, you know the worse thing to me that you could ever say? is locksmith you the best rapper in the bay
Not to say i don't appreciate the compliment but nigga fuck the bay, I'm tryna take over the continent
My aspirations are greater than what you may assume
I'm reaching for the stars so its hard to settle for the moon
Move out of my path you lack foresight, instead of backing me you gave these other niggas more hype
Like, lock you good but they greater, if i don't agree they look at me like I'm the hater
If you not from this region, you couldn't grasp it
Someone should've told you about (the little bunny rabbit)
