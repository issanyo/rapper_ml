(Verse 1)
I was born as a Muslim
Submission to the most high
Bullets flying with mother's crying was close by
Folks sigh of relief hoping they don't die
Niggas spilling beans for pies no bowtie
Stoves open was overdosing from coke highs
Boogle got murdered for nothing my nigga no jive
So how did I become such a lyricist?
Every Saturday was debating Jehovah's Witnesses
Every Latter Day Saint praying hoping they witness this
Kingdom Hall murdered em all open Leviticus
And hoop was my therapy, rap took its place
Now I'm faced with disparity
Charity case barely escaped screaming hysterically
It's only so long that my parents can take care of me
I'm unnecessarily hyped
But lyrically I break every bass, stereotype
I'm the black sheep of the bunch
The herd tried to fuck me
Ask about the West
They mention every nigga but me
But ain't a nigga that can touch me
Still I'm at the bottom of the pile like Rugby

(Verse 2)
Okay, honesty and loyalty has never been an issue
Try to help your people out and look at what it gets you
This is what it feels like when everyone's against you
When you was thinking like you thinking right but deep inside it hits you
I can try to paint the picture for you but it's broad strokes
I've seen niggas lose their life pulling a broads coat
Tail fail for their dreams now they miserable
Wanna bring me down but let me project the visual
Either you succeed or suck seethe
Like shorty let's fuck more
It's chestnut your soul is under siege
Come and leave with the Devil
Dance with him dead
Or you can take a chance glance at em stare
Yeah, like the swing of the pendulum
I take it as a complement comparing me to Eminem
So let's begin again, look at the man's work
Only the dude you hear now can keep you this hurt
