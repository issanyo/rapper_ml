[Intro]
...Fuck it

[Verse 1]
Good morning new world, good morning America
No warning, no sin, no mourning, no cryin', no tearin' up
No Crescent Park in the news and no cousins that's gearin' up
No mother's weepin' and no reason for grievin' we veering up
I'm clearin' up any past assumptions
I navigated the path you raided and allocated my space from the trap you brung us
I clung to the aspirations
Of gold, but the passive aggressive passion niggas be passin' off is an act of laymen
I'm lyin' my mark in the sand
I don't wanna play no part in the plan
I don't wanna say what's underway you can never understand what's in the heart of a man
I manually manufacture my own trajectory
Still petrified if I step and slide, nobody's catchin' me
Catch me after I cuff a million
I used to stand in the mirror and merely dream in the moment I would ever touch this feelin'
I'm feelin' my light is a part of a larger scope
If you garnish hope then it ain't just my art that you bargain fo'
Wake up

[Interlude]
Yeah I mean I'm not wastin' a minute man. Y'all motherfuckers can play around. Ayo Apollo, yo...

[Hook]
Rise and shine, get on top of your grind
Follow your heart and don't ever stop 'til you fly
Follow your passion, fuck if they askin'
They stay down I "wake up"
Then get down I "wake up"

[Verse 2]
This is just a fraction of his compassion but it isn't cash
And cashin' a check that my ass wrote when I dipped in rappin'
This distraction can never fix the past
How do I switch the caption? Switch the track
Niggas be sniffin' ass just to get a laugh in
Why would I ever rationalize when niggas be hashin' out lies
And it just so happens I'm after somethin' but I'm draggin' this pride
And it's like the baggage you have to claim when the package arrives
Or passenger flies and you have to comply
I've been up, I've been even lower
Even though I've seen 'em grow, I've seen 'em blow
I've seen 'em sew up scenes even though it's so obscene
I know it, but I took those bruises in stride
And I pushed that news to the side and it ain't just you I confide
I've been up the creek but the weight is off
Swimming upstream with the hate I scoff
I don't wanna say what is underway you could never understand what I had to take I fought
I bought a piece of America's nightmare
Sewed it back inside the rapper the highest price you could bear
Wake up!

[Interlude]
Yeah. Y'all motherfuckers wanna procrastinate. Yo. While y'all motherfuckers waitin' on that...

[Hook]
