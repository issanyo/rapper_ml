[Verse 1: Locksmith]

I used to stare at the television and dream of a life free of disparity
When I was young, they tried to put me in therapy
My mother got explicit, addressing the school district
Like this boy's got a gift, either you're blind or you don't care to see
It's like we carelessly judge things that are different
If we don't understand them, we stand back in resentment
This man raps with intentions to separate from the flock
But it seems to stir up tension in more cases than not
But it’s far worse damage to play along for the cameras
If you can't be yourself, you'll eventually have to answer
To the damper of a dark cloud
Instead of chasing opportunities, I just follow what's in my heart now
Embark now on the new path that I'm paving
It's like they want a drink from the same bath that they bathe in
I did my best to try to save him, and break the walls before they cave in


[Chorus: Rebecca Nobel]

I never thought I would make it
Where I’m from they don’t make it
I fell hard when you came in
It’s hard when you’re aimin’
It's only wrong if you waste it
Stay strong and you'll make it
It’s hard when you’re aimin’
So hard to stay here
Find my way home
My way home
I’ll wait for my way home
My way home
My way home
I’ll wait for my way home


[Verse 2: Locksmith]
And it's like we're only grateful for the things we have after we lose them
Once they go awry we deny it in disillusion
It took me to this point in my life to finally acknowledge
I could never keep a girl if I use them for my amusement
Now every new muse that I momentarily move with
I mutually have to feel they can deal with me doing music
But it's hard to stay muted when the temperature is humid
And it's human nature to feel hatred than rather look foolish
Assuming that it suits the issue
I'm the first to admit my basis for choosing women was superficial
I would repeat the same steps then expect new results and be repulsed by the actions that I was forced to live through
But it's only me that faltered
Because of my missteps my destination was altered
Now I walk awkward between martyr and artist
Regardless, besides truth there's nothing more I can offer


[Bridge: Rebecca Nobel]

Find my way home
My way home
I’ll wait for my way home
My way home
My way home
I’ll wait for my way home

My way home
I’ll wait for my way home
My way home
My way home
I’ll wait for my way home

Find my way home
My way home
I’ll wait for my way home
My way home
My way home
I’ll wait for my way home


[Verse 3: Locksmith]

We all have issues in life regardless of our distinctions
I know my biggest hurdle is easily overthinking
It's like paying admission to take a trip on a cruise
But you can't enjoy the view cause you’re constantly scared of sinking You blink then its finished with
How come we always down play our strengths and embellish all of our blemishes
We mimic what we see as wealth
Expending our energy still pretendin’ when it’s easier to be yourself
I felt a shift when I shifted outta my own
When you understand your worth then it’s like you're traveling home. The people that you meet and the new places you venture can only make sense if you sense them before you've entered
Hmmm, And they say it’s silly what I’m chasin’
They'd rather save face and embrace being complacent
I did my best to try to brace em'
And break the walls before it breaks them


[Alternative Chorus: Rebecca Nobel]

I never thought I would make it
Where I’m from they don’t make it
I fell hard when you came in
It’s hard when you’re aimin’
It's only wrong if you waste it
Stay strong and you'll make it
It’s hard when you’re aimin’
So hard to stay here
