[Verse 1]
Speaking our mind, let him do himself
I ain't hard to find, come and do yourself
Pillow talking bills, (Big shout to Amadeo on the track) come and do yourself
Ain't that a bitch, now come and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
(To the West side) go and do yourself, you go ahead and do yourself

(Chapter got pill) Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
(Chapter live TV.com, wad yup!) Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself

[Verse 2]
You took all day, bought these jeans on flipping
A hard to turn keys like a car ignition
The money ain't tripping, the doe a get a hard on
[?] shit, On cross country, Lance Armstrong
Go and, go and, go, go, come
A strong with no off switch, on, on, outch
See pockets fat like the ass on [?]
Making all the rap niggas wanna come touch that
But like cash stacks, look but don't touch that
Before they get the vertical, top keys here push back
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Put the candy in your mouth, get the trigger, shoot yourself
Heavy metal still banging, yeah I rock still
You fucking with a jackass, a real Johnny Knoxville
I travel with a budget, Am on the block still
Band Aid, I rather work, while niggas chase a rat deal

[Hook]
Speaking our mind, let him do himself
I ain't hard to find, come and do yourself
Pillow talking bills, you can do yourself
Ain't that a bitch, now go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself

[Verse 2]
Huh, go rinse your mouth out with bug shot
Big time hustle on ways, an the way niggs get the spot hot
Ain't no hanging if you ain't banging with the banger
On the [?] side of the Chevrolet window damn
Thirty banging niggas, peace out to all my nigga
No California cater boy, whatever [?]
San Francisco 49 at Oakland radar boy
Yeah, controversy daddy, I live illegal
Confidential, we don't say nothing to them fucking people
Hello, Wel, wel, wel, welcome to the snake pit
Best winning cheat the scope, scare of some snakes shit
Stick yourself like Tony, you niggas are selling phony
No you ain't street cause am own it and they don't even know it
That's the benas nigga, you a pillow talker
Die we're at the mouth, can't hold water pillow talker
Do the streets a favor, go ahead and shoot yourself
Suicide fold it in the mouth, do yourself

[Hook]
Speaking our mind, let him do himself
I ain't hard to find, come and do yourself
Pillow talking bills, you can do you self
Ain't that a bitch, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself

[Verse 3]
Yeah, we talking Kurt Cobain
Corian, with her phoenix, Shaquer Stewart
Any matter who is bulimic
I seamless rhythm between religion, and niggas dreaming
I heard your album and what the fuck was you niggas thinking
The pay is like a ferris wheel, instead of us and parent skills
We go in circles, to [?] a peach shit
Now am nauseous and exhausted but I thought it would a cost it
For all shit, the garbage, we can't distinguish
A genius in my own right, patrone might
How you niggas gassed up, until you see me clinched my fingers
No punchline, I am Gia Mannetti front line
Breed the street, there was no between us
I am an extremist, All you fuck boys can eat penis
Or second thought, y'all probably just enjoy it
Thirsty rap nigga, came up on some change
Then you blew your album, do us all a favor nigga
Do yourself

[Hook]
Speaking our mind, let him do himself
I ain't hard to find, come and do yourself
Pillow talking bills, you can do yourself
Ain't that a bitch,  go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
Go and do yourself, go ahead and do yourself
