[Verse 1: Locksmith]
The Know
Small fish, small pond
Crescent park in the alley that’s lil alley john
Mix parents, apparently, my parents prepare me for the perils to face barrels that kept me calm
Directly spawned from niggas posing and posing
Noting those for the notion they only chose never let me on
I use to beg for they validation i enter the maturation
Of finding my own voice with a deadly song
And i had to sit in my mothers beauty salon bored
I use to dream of the sneakers that we couldn’t afford
I got em anyway, anyway I was hooping
Wasn’t thinking bout music, my sister went on her first tour
I had to sit in her room and she would write verses
I use to think it was silly, really like  what's the purpose?
I wasn't conscious that I was being obnoxious
What she was doing then would eventually hit me strike a chord
Fast forward I’m writing more, i started rapping I graduated
I’m quite mature, I started honing my skills inside the zone I would build
Confidence for that contest inside the source
I kept the secrets to others I wouldn’t speak it
Hard to let it fly, was shy
Felt insecure
Is the cure, fuck what anybody say
Never get your respect til you get about the bay

[Hook: Fallon]
You ain’t got to wait too long cuz the days get shorter
Life get’s harder, the world we know
You ain’t got to wait too long cuz the days get shorter
Life get’s harder, the world we know

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Small fish, small tank
Used to play in the alley
Now alley call rank
When they come to rap they try to summon the trap and
What can happen when you happen to self doubt and draw blank
Drawing angst from niggas claiming they made em
Only aim to complain, you get fame and they call you fake
And i use to beg em to give me radio spins
But you never get respect when you try to cater to them
I know, i was young, I was dumb and impressionable
I take advice that I knew was unprofessional
And i use to listen to people that was never the truth
And i brought the negative energy with me in the booth
But i have to follow my dreams and what they mean to me
So i left the bay and I got me some different scenery
And I found peace in the various rhymes that I write
But I lost my job this the scariest time of my life
Insecurity is tacked on there's no plan B and it’s nothing to fall back on
Sooner or later gotta face these threats
Try walking a tight rope without a safety net
Try taking the high road when everybody I know
Is jocking the others niggas every day they slept
Everyday I wept but respect is not given its earned
But I be damned if I miss my turn

[Hook: Fallon]
You ain’t got to wait too long cuz the days get shorter
Life gets harder, the world we know
You ain’t got to wait too long cuz the days get shorter
Life gets harder, the world we know
You ain’t got to wait too long cuz the days get shorter
You ain’t got to wait too long cuz the days get shorter (get shorter)
You ain’t got to wait too long cuz the days get shorter (get shorter)
