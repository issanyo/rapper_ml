[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]

Bright eyes, sky is the limit
From the high rise to the country road
Whoa! I will say this truly
Life ain't no movie
But she'll make me work for a heart of gold

My American Beauty. Whoa!
My American Beauty. Whoa!
She's my American…

[Locksmith]

My American Pie. Such a beauty but truly no comparing you. I
Know these other dudes be lying they're just married to pride
You lucky I'm not your typical American guy
For whatever kind of position you've embarrassed the try
For whenever we get together though your parents deny
Whether you California live or you chillin' in Chi
I stay true. That's a typical American lie
My bad

I know you got me, even when gets rocky
Truly you're one of one. These other bitches is copies
Sort of stuck in a daze. No other woman can stop me
Sort of stuck in my ways, but really look where it got me

(uh) The bright lights
(uh)the big city
(uh) she stay down
(uh) and ride with me
(uh) Ain't got to front y'all can clearly see, could be anywhere in the world but she's her with me
With those…

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]

Bright eyes, sky is the limit
From the high rise to the country road
Whoa! I will say this truly
Life ain't no movie
But she'll make me work for a heart of gold

My American Beauty. Whoa!
My American Beauty. Whoa!
She's my American…

[Locksmith]

Am I devoted? (Yes)
Without motive? (Yes)
When you around, nobody else Imma notice. (Unless)
You give me reason I'm out, an uneven amount
A side look, and that's the reason I doubt

I'm not tryin' to put you in pressure
But I see what it's ‘bout
But I feel a different impression
When it's me and you out
And you show me a little love
I purchase it like a drug
Got the whole world hooked
And that's the reason we out

And, I sort of feel like a fiend
Sort of feel like it's mean
She flirting with other lads
It's killing my self-esteem
It's killing my confidence
I'm hanging on by a string
My beautiful nightmare
My bright American Dream

(And uh) She's so bad
(But uh) She's so pretty
(And uh) She's shut down
(But uh) I'm so privy

Y'all can hate, but it's clear to me
She's been everywhere in the world but she's still with me
With those…

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]

Bright eyes, sky is the limit
From the high rise to the country road
Whoa! I will say this truly
Life ain't no movie
But she'll make me work for a heart of gold

My American Beauty. Whoa!
My American Beauty. Whoa!
She's my American…

[Locksmith]

I feel a chill when I turn from her
Feel it build. I'm concerned for you
Feel like these jealous Try to keep you on your toes
But there's a lot we can learn from you

Word from you in a text
You're not one to be controlled
You're not easily impressed
I'm not tryin' to get you home
I just want to see you blessed
Karma don't understand
That's why you always seem stressed

They try to judge you for the things you've done
Like they never been hurt, never been young
Regardless of circumstance, still advance
But it's not a movie
You're my American Beauty
