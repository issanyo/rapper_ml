[Round 1: Locksmith]
Now see I got this gal of mine, born and raised in Palestine
And she said your style of rhyme is like a fucking phallic sign
All you do is shout and whine
Then you shaved your facial hair to look less Arab and more like a fag that does gay ads in mags for Calvin Klein
He's like a child a mine so contemplate the attack of criticism
And you do is kick wack shit but spit it rapid
To compensate for your lack of lyricism
And what's even worse about your shadiness
You take premeditated pauses to make it seem like what you say is spontaneous
"Ayo, ayo, filler line, filler line"
Who the fuck you think you fooling we all know you killing time
And no disrespect Lush-y but Salman Rushdie can't touch me
I'm so ill I took this nigga to Chicken And Waffles and he tried to order some spinach falafel and a goat milk slushie
"Oh motherfuck me!" That's what you thinking as you sinking
You so ashamed of your race you be telling white bitches that you half Puerto Rican
What the fuck is you thinking? My flow is so meticulous
How could you ever doubt me Cousin Balki, don't be ridiculous

[Round 1: Dizaster]
Goddamn, I gotta wipe the spit off my face, fucking camel
Alright check it out, what are you half Persian half black, check it out Lock-med

Ayo, you can use a knife to cut this the thickness of the air's density to measure this room's level of intensity
They say, "Diz' who's more Arabic, you or Lock?" I said, "Who gives a fuck just let it be."
Cause just for accepting this battle you're clearly more of a suicide bomber than I'll ever be
Ayo check it out, fuck the Loch Ness that's just a forgotten myth that's lost in the sea
You don't wanna argue with D
Bitch I grew up doing home invasions so getting by a Lock was never a problem for me
Plus I'm a cocky MC that will unlock your mother's twat and use my cock as a key
Homie, your shit been fucking with me so homie I'ma let you know
He wanted to treat us all on Grind Time like we down here and he's on his own pedestal
When all you done is promos like a homo so technically you're a promo-sexual
Listen Lock, with that 16 you kicked at Battle Of The Bay 3 you need to fall back
Cause people were screaming like it was all that
But the hardest part of your verses when he described in detail what you're gonna do to another man's ballsack
Ayo listen, you ain't a legend, you're whole life you've been getting served and murdered son
You wanna start the concept of The New Bay cause this faggot is not accepted in the current one
Y'all should've sent me to MTV I would've never embarrassed The Bay fam'
Unlike this idiot trying to say he got jerked in front of the building like a lame fan
Talking about "someone pass me an umbrella I think it's gonna rain man."

[Round 2: Locksmith]
You're a homo and my rap style is ugly
All my battles is promo cause none of these motherfuckers is worthy to judge me
I would stone this fucker, this clone's a buster
Looking like Gaddafi, fuck his own homeless mother minus the Trojan rubber
And gave birth to a Lebanese version of a turban coked up trucker
I own this fucker, another not so hot ho from Morocco with my flow
You gots to stop bro, it's like Farrakhan vers' a Jew from Lebanon
And my flow is the Gestapo
Tell him it's not so
I gotta battle this damn fool and act this damn cruel
Every time I call Sprint I gotta talk to one of your cousins in Istanbul
See this man's cruel, just a bunch of fags that wanna mate and date with each other
Plus your eyebrows look like two caterpillars running away from each other
I'm raping this fucker, got your head up your whore's bush
Your metaphor's need more push
The only good thing you ever did was throw your shoe at George Bush
Cause you just an abused genie
I be stroking your wife while you be opium pipe choking from spite
Playing The Freaks Come Out At Night by Whoudini
I put a price on your head like a foreign bounty
So you and your boring townies can go the fuck back to Orange County

[Round 2: Dizaster]
Ayo listen Lock you shouldn't even bother
He dissed Istanbul and Palestine, good job dawg you dissed your own father
Check it out see, your attempts to discredit me would have hurt me
If they weren't coming from a faggot ass straight A student who graduated from UC Berkeley
See that's why your gangsta cover up act don't pay
Here we were thinking Lock was on the block letting the straps all spray
When really this faggot was in class all day
Ayo fuck your pre-structured pathetic bars
You can never be a Fresh Coast leader or ghetto star
Not when you're the number one high school speaker for the Don't Smoke Weed seminars
Too bad you can't buy street credibility with E-A Ski's credit card
Oh my God I think I just murdered you with eleven bars
See, growing up him and Left were BFF's they were both so intertwined
And like the other low life piece of shit you ditched him and went solo to shine
So how the fuck are we gon' respect your group as The Frontline when he clearly left one of your soldiers behind?
See I spit those hurricanes, massacres and twisters
I'm a disaster on the Richter
You don't wanna battle with me mister
I feel like I'm battling the last existing picture of a younger teenage faggot Little Richard
But you're in debt to E-A Ski, don't lie you know it's true
You're like the vowels of the alphabet cause every time you see him you're like, "E-A I O U"

[Round 3: Locksmith]
Somebody's been Googling me but it's all good
I'm sure you got a whole lot of computers, check it out
Can y'all bare with me for a second? I say

Dizaster, Dizaster, oh bitch ass Dizaster
You're a man of many flows but of none are you a master
You say that you a Muslim but to me you are a calfer
Cause you walk on hot coals and you pray to Zoroaster
I knew you was a bastard when you appeared in my scope
And I can tell you was a bitch I heard the fear in your throat
I said "As-salamu alaykum" but it was weird when you spoke
Cause he was like, "liekamum laiskaum makum"
Look nigga I didn't know if you was talking or clearing your throat
This queer is a joke, get fucking slumped and red
When you wake up you gon' feel like you got a fucking Pumpkinhead
Now you dumb found dead (Dumbfoundead) cause the best I be (I.B.) after this F.L.O
You'll feel so awkward (Okwerdz) you'll need me to direct (Drect) you to the E.X.I.-T
Yes I see, you get murdered in moderation
And fuck the nonsense let's get back to the conversation
He said, "Lock, how about you and I fly to Dubai?"
My reply was, "Dude, why?"
He said, "Cause all the dude's bi."
I said, "Fuck you dude. Bye."
Look at this dude's eyes he knew that I would have to win
Cause those dark circles look like he was in a suba diving accident

[Round 3: Dizaster]
See Locksmith always black balls himself like he's on some hot shit
This ain't Hov, this ain't Young Jeezy, this ain't Lil' Weezy...this is Locksmith
Ayo c'mon dawg, ayo listen, fuck the bullshit
Yo, just to get comfortable playing E.A. Sports you gotta- check it out I fucked the FUCK UP
Man, god damn..
