Look it here, I'm riding round my city Richmond, California. Shout out to my
Cousins, still out on that corner. Everyday n****s wrote off, haters would scoff
Was that loner. If haven't stated I graduated yo B**** is my diploma. Yeah got a
Feeling I'm living dreams. N****s wanna take my pain as jest but they can't
Suppress what I did or seen. You ain't gotta waist no time no I'm in a place I
See life as being more than just bull s*** n****s wanna pull me back off track
But I intervened. N**** got notes for days Frankie Beverly Maze. So much soul to
Console consolidated through waves. Waving bye to disparity bear with me as I
Climb outta this bottomless bucket known as the Bay I decline. I'm just speaking
My mind, using music as clarity. Painting pictures with rhymes you can see my
Sincerity. Mother F*****s is bitter deep inside just scared of me. N****s always
On Twitter, guess its cheaper than therapy. N****s wanna take my spot come try
Got a bad b**** that's ride or die. She be on the grind all day like me. Then we
Get together go hard all night. Living our lives to the fullest everyday its no
Lie. Stronger than them pills and that powder we loaded from life

We loaded from life. We loaded from life. Living our lives to the fullest
Everyday its no lie stronger than them pills and that powder we getting loaded
From life yeah

We loaded from life. We loaded from life. Living our lives to the fullest
Everyday its no lie stronger than them pills and that powder we getting loaded
From life yeah

Uh huh uh huh

Really I'm just living my life nah this ain't a facade. I'm be chasing my
Dreams, they be chasing these broads. I don't worship this game and its not
Replacing my God. I don't suck d*** for spins or to see my face in a blog. Man
I'm just repping my city silly of me to deny. What I knew was better but
Pressure sent my endeavors a rye. So I take my feelings and spill em and put em
All in these rhymes. But a n**** got notes for days Frankie Beverly Maze. So
Much soul to console consolidated I pray. They preying on me I only see what's
In front of me why would I look back what's been indifferent difference I live
In the sky. Lyrically they know I'm a problem matter of fact I'm menace. I
Really came from the bottom. These other rappers is gimmicks. These other
Rappers be biting. Similar bars as Lock. They covered in my DNA like a barber's
Smock. Matter fact I mob like Pac, matter fact I flow like Biggie. Matter fact
I'm really I'm really from Richmond putting on for city. Living life to the
Fullest everyday its no lie. Stronger than them pills and that powder we getting
Loaded from life. Yeah

We loaded from life. We loaded from life. Living our lives to the fullest
Everyday its no lie stronger than them pills and that powder we getting loaded
From life yeah

We loaded from life. We loaded from life. Living our lives to the fullest
Everyday its no lie stronger than them pills and that powder we getting loaded
From life yeah
