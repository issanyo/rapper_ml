I'm the Persian and black version of rap Nat Turner
I crack sternums and put rappers in a gurney
In fact burn him I trap trappers and read them my raps backwards and tell them to practice until they’re worthy
Taking your comments personal, unmerciful
When I converse through verse your words just floor me
One of the few survivors, counting money, your favorite rapper's an uber driver they selling you stories
Never to diss a man but how do I live in this, it's bland
When lyrics are at a disadvan
I’m willing to take a different stand, willing to take the risk, you ran. But what if you miss the gist and plan
The negative rhetoric you been peddling, I insist it's spam
Don't fuck around with me, students used to look down on me, now they begging to lounge with me, now yo bitch on the couch with me, other rappers won't vouch for me cause they're scared of my alchemy
How come he blacking out? Cause you motherfuckers had douted me
Taking the tools you gave, breaking the rules you made
The further in depth to weather the threat don't ever expect the same
I'm constantly evolving and jogging the margin and marching over the small ass box you put my art in
Taking the brunt of niggas who front how do I say I'm in the slum, had to survey what I’ve become
What I’ve become is numb
The fact you happy ain't happen stance
If you have to stand in front of my face then you can’t escape what is said and done
How do I adjust my view?
How I assist the trusted few?
How do I resist the rest of plan and say fuck it I must go through?
I had to muscle the mustard gas that mustered motherfuckers that muffled my message whenever instructed to
And do I feel like I flew by the dudes that you try to say are incredible who you claim as credible
My defense impregnable, what I'm spittin' upsettin' you
Setting you far back cause rapping was really never you
But you got all the money you can dream (right, right)
You got all the bitches on your team (right, right)
You be talkin’ down on my folks through social media posts and you blame it on the lean right?
Don't fuck around with me, students used to look down on me, now they begging to lounge with me, now yo bitch on the couch with me, other rappers won't vouch for me cause they're scared of my alchemy
How come he blacking out? Cause you motherfuckers had douted me
