This is the honest me but honestly who can dispel that
N***as who fell back jealous tell us you'll never sell that, rather they self rap blaming their self lack, claiming that they bringing back the west when they barely can bring they self back
Was held back but I delve back to myself rap was, was just a Trojan horse to ignore remorse and rebel back
B***h n***a you barely can write a verse let alone ignite a thirst through this music that I excel at
Fact, but I guess it's all relative, slow n***as rappin sound like you off sedatives
Every now and then found an end to expound a trend claiming you profound when the sound is all repetitive
Whatever lives in your soul is so blinded either you don't mind it or realize that you're closed minded
You hypocritical typical n***as vow that you ain't living foul, I see through your mirage n***a you're in denial
I'm unique but I speak maturity, everything you do just reeks of insecurity
Everything you do is a result of my art say it, we making up new rues, you n***as is archaic
