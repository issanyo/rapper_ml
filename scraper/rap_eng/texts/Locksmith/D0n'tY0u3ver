(Hook)
Don't you ever tell me no
I've been Killin all my foes
I've been livin' on the road
Don't you ever tell me- (2x)
No- uh
Don't you ever tell me no
Don't you ever tell me No
I've been killin all my foes
I've been livin' on the road
Don't you ever-

(Verse)
You bit the lead not talkin' bout pen and pencils
Cirque du soleil on these instrumentals
These lyrical acrobats and
Legible is the quintessential of talented rapping
Where lyricism actually matters
I’m blackin’ out shows in nevada
Had the chance to enlist A list celebrities for backup dancers
I’ll jack your tracks then sell ‘em back so lets extract the ransom
And Zach’s a phantom
Who’s platinum plaques are back to back like we’re comparin’ height
I’m in the psychoanalytic paradigm
Oakleys on my face because the glarin’ lights
So if I threw this shade you wouldn’t wear ‘em right
I’m packin’ stands so I got a terrorist mind
All these snakes are havin’ glances at my paradise
Smackin’ brats with tantrums with half a stanza
I like my loose leaf with dabs of ranch but
By happenstance-
This an eviction notice
I wake up every morning and sniff the roses
I got your flows split like moses
I got a finger in your face and
Ya'll are just pickin' noses
And yet you can't pick the coldest
I rip it open
You see me on your horizon and as soon as
I get in focus
You think a ship's aproachin'
There won't be any search when you're hit with the Chrome
And my Insta's open, this video is really slow but you'll get exposed as soon as this clip is loaded
Every flow is so ill when I wrote it
That even if you're not sick of me
You'll still need to get diagnosis
Chips on shoulders- Clock you left and right but this isn't hypnosis
I got the chillest flows
You'd think that a river's frozen
All these rappers giving their supporters
Some bigger doses
Of melatonin
And they're put to rest
One request

(Hook)
Don't you ever tell me no
I've been Killin all my foes
I've been livin' on the road
Don't you ever tell me- (2x)
No- uh
Don't you ever tell me no
Don't you ever tell me No
I've been killin all my foes
I've been livin' on the road
Don't you ever-

(Bridge) (Locksmith)
Will someone please tell me what you’re trying to be?
Cause I know it ain’t a rapper, can’t rhyme to a beat
You’re living with your parents and you’re driving a lease
Plus I’ll say your pigment is as white as a sheet
You can spit for 7 days at a time but you’re week
I don't even care ‘bout your Devry PhD
I'm doing everything you’re doing in a higher degree
But we hear you sayin’

(Bridge 2)
Don't tell me no, don't tell me (3x)
Don’t tell me no

(Hook)
Don't you ever tell me no
I've been Killin all my foes
I've been livin' on the road
Don't you ever tell me- (2x)
No- uh
Don't you ever tell me no
Don't you ever tell me No
I've been killin all my foes
I've been livin' on the road
Don't you ever-
