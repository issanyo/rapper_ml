[Verse 1]

Yeah, you know, yo
Living my life in Richmond
California, Crescent park was cruel
Never thought I would be the victim of the shit that I went through
Never thought I would be so lucky to reach even 22
Niggas rarely do see their birthday let alone graduate from school
I done seen niggas turn bitch when they mention my name
Hood friends switch in the mist of my fame
Other niggas here to pretend BUT IT'S KILLS when he can
And they will drive a niga insane
Sort of how I felt on my first day of class
Little mix boy, is he white can he pass
Is he half breed, what that does mean
Is he that clean, need a vaccine, they would ask me
But I never give a fuck about opinion
Truth been told I coulda died on Fleming
Truth been told plenty time I was slipping
Say what I feel to reflect how I'm living
Niggas never show you love and you buzzin mane
They keep saying let nothing change
Would you make it others niggas hating
Mentality all we wasn't change
That niggas say they rap
But they really want a bitch
Nigga say they trap til they really in a pinch
Say they got your back til they see you on the fence
Say they wanna take it back when they see you take offense
I won't take offense til I see a nigga fist
I won't take a print til I see a nigga rest
Thought you was a homie but you really was a bitch
Had to see it all before, motherfucker willie lynch

[Hook]

Niggas always talking what they finna do
Never follow through that's why them niggas lose
Niggas always talking what they bout to do
Try to come at me I tell y'all niggas too
I don't give a motherfuck (x8)

[Verse 2]

See life is a game but you never wanna play
On the same team is that nigga indicate
Sort of like mine from the niggas in the bay
But it's really on the same when you put it on display
Did a whole tape with my nigga ski beats
Did I have tour with the nigga DD
Say I couldn't ride cause he couldn't pay the fee
Then you got a whole bus just so he could smoke weed
I ain't even mad I'm just giving y'all the real
I was naive thinking this a big deal
Second on the tee at the rich ain't about a bitch
When you rather have a deal than a meal
Yeah see a meal can save whores, a meal can save hoes
Either way you gonna have to pay how they choose
Never gonna understand til you walk in the same songs
And I was in the middle of it all
Try to found a reason way them nigga wanna stole
Feeling like a groopie as they fallow in the car
But I still feel blessed cause I made it this far
Maybe I'm scarred, maybe I'm drawn
Still try to tell â€šem that you sleeping on a star
Niggas never get it to see you from afar
Kind to found out it was haters in the squad
Come to find out it was a blessing stressing, what my bro told me
He told me look out for yourself
Never chase hoes, chase the money
But then again in the end we end up with the same results
When it all far apart and you blame it all
You can laugh lil nigga but this ain't a joke
You fuck around and you wake up broke, just know

[Hook]
