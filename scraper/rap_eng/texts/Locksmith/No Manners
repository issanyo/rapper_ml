[Intro]
Yeah
Welcome to The Lock Sessions
Yes, shout out my brother Mike Blankenship
Produced by myself and Mike
Brian Storm on the camera
We gonna let the beat build
Oh, the album is on the way, 2016, just know
Look, look

[Verse: Locksmith]
Imagine you had the talent to reach your vision
But the people backing you, held you back so you need permission
To take advantage, the vantage point that you manage to flourish
Would discourage any other person in these conditions
His condition to speak with diction
These restrictions only push me further to be assertive not a weak submissive
If your natural reaction is to be dismissive, it only proves to me, that nigga we need to keep a distance
I march to my own drum, but I don't run
And charge into the face of adversity, I've been nursing these
Wounds from my past and counter
I would counter my doubts with skepticism
Rap with a certain stigma, the astigmatism blinded by hindsight
Benign hype
From these writers make it hard as an artist to get behind sights
Like they forcefully force feed with a force feed and force greed
Instead of a subject matter with some substance rather
They gather the young and impressionable and then pressure them through
Material sums they can profit from
Every profit plummets at some point but at some point
Niggas gotta be responsible but their response is bull
They pull you in one direction, that one impression, leaves a bad taste on the tongue of any one who questions
To stand in the status quo, if I have to show my true nature
Naturally some of you rappers have to go!

[Outro]
Yeah, the new album is on the way
2016, The Lock Sessions
