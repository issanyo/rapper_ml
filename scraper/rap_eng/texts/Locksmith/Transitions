[Verse 1]
Yeah, I abuse you dudes
I don’t buy Twitter followers and YouTube views
I don’t need an application, to show me the facts of plating
You have to retract statements, through the truth you scuse
I don’t masquerade this humble and mumble on speaking text
I don’t disregard people with talents I see of threats
Desperate niggas thirst for attention, surfing in mentions
With certain intentions, never to think this was worth attention
And real niggas feel me, bitch niggas loads me
I betrayed the real me, who can ever expose me
I display anguish through facts
My father pay for my tuition, bustin tables
What’s more gangster than that?
And I’ma pay him back with laying raps
Never to slack and laying back
They overlooked in my own region like the chelain blacks
I refuse to keep playin in this decayin trap
Now it’s to the point I’m reluctant to even say I rap
And can you blame me or sustain thee
Living love importance was dormant until they changed me
Then they label me angry, but ain’t greed?
The same sea from which the do spawn
Over a few quams, few songs and couple shows
Couple doughs with your grief
It’s so sweet to see my success has passed your belief, yeah

[Verse 2]
More rappin and less spammin
More time recordin and less of a instagramin
More metaphorin, exploring forms to exploit your path
Point loud, voice to craft, how you still avoiding past
Expecting me to accept the plead
To accept the breed, except the v
Second these niggas show disrespect for me
Recipe of jealousy, stuck inside of the breath of these
Thirsty ass niggas wish nothing less than the death of me
But I’m still here when I’m breathing well
Streets can tell when a real nigga has breached the feats of hell
People preachin they smile, showin they teeth as well
Till they face to face with the beast
Reaching to see the well
So take us at the speed, my spirit is incomplete
My lyrics were meant to reach
Deep inside our secrets dwell
These other niggas deceiving and they can’t even tell
They wanna see em fail, yeah
