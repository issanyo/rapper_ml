(Verse)
I guess this is it
The final verse on this album where I get all personal
And tell you I’ll be back for revenge- But nah
How ‘bout I don’t?
How ‘bout I tell you why this album is the last that I’ll pen?
How ‘bout instead I tell you why me and music are going in different directions lately?
Could tell you that the public was meant to hate me
Separating Needs from wants
Looking back on decisions to consider the cost
Gettin’ lost at every simple thought lately
I’m checkin’ out- My memory bank will need direct deposits
Thinkin’ in the box, I hate to admit a loss but-
This album got me thinkin’: Could I have been farther along in life if I made different decisions?
See, My friends have houses, they're having kids now
And suddenly this world of music isn't looking so big now
I can't help but scrutinize what I writ down Cause I feel as if I've wasted time on music so on bigger things I've missed out
That's why I got caught up in making it perfect Cause if I'm sacrificing all these choices this album better be worth it
But I don't think I'll ever reach that point so even if it sounds wrong, I'll settle Cause time is slippin' and it'll be gone forever
Now I'm at the end of this album unsatisfied with how it turned out
And I'm never gonna get back those opportunities I turned down
If I had a choice, I’d still rap, never got burnt out
Had to learn how to turn doubts to words. Found every verse sounds the same, when it’s arranged, off of the page
Can’t switch up my flow, hole is getting smaller on my birdhouse
Too afraid to look out at the world now
Too many things that I’m unsure ‘bout
That's a sure route to the bottom
Don’t know if I earned fans or bought ‘em
How could someone sit and enjoy me spittin’ this noise?
Issues to face (twoface), at the flip of a coin I wonder how I got them (Gotham)
My mom saved a box of the clothes I wore as a baby, didn’t wanna find out that on the top she wrote: 'give to Zach when he grows up'
And the box is mine now
I have to come to grips with the fact that I’m not 8 or 9 now
I’m twice that, so now I’m striving to make my remaining time count
And music ain't a part of that
Yeah- Music ain't a part of that
Wonder why I was ambitious when I started rap
Now I struggle to even start a rap
Spent all this time writing just for them to call it trash
Put my work into these songs just to watch ‘em crash
No eggshells under me, I’m walking on shards of glass
I couldn’t accomplish my dreams and that’s hard to grasp
Think I’m onto something just to find that hundreds already thought of that
Ridiculed because I didn’t have a darker past, So I chose the harder path
What’s the point of all this? I’ll just end up another car that crashed
Or an old man with no family that has a heart attack
5 years after I’m gone there won’t be a single thought of Zach
And my music that didn’t make it will be all the past
I’m packing it up, put my discography in a garbage sack
Sling it on my back and walk out hoping not be be bothered yeah
I didn't get a break and no one heard my call for help
So I’ll have to learn how to enjoy my thoughts all by myself
But Usually I get a feeling, get my pad and go crazy
But nowadays I can’t verbalize what’s been happenin’ lately
So this is the first and last album you'll hear from Zachary Brede
My father used to fix up broken cars back in the 80’s
He saw the frame and instantly he had a vision
After all the cosmetics, his last step was the engine
He rebuilt that engine from the bottom till it was running and suddenly his project that he created in his head was finished
I apply that to the writtens  That I penned when I was supposed to be doing Apex courses
Writing dozens of songs spending hours changing, morphin,’ Reworking them from the bottom till the idea in my brain became a portrait
The day I recorded Program was one of the best days I can remember, that’s when I realized
That these lyrics in my head manifested into something before my eyes
So I starting writing more and realized that I Can't afford it So with every paycheck, I saved a portion
Looking back at this album, I know I Paid a fortune But the money doesn't matter to me now, it's just straight enjoyment
Never had dreams of one day performing And it's been years since music has felt in any way important
I just wanted to verbalize the thoughts and every single dream I ever had. And I think I did that
But when I'm looking in between I see my father fixing cars and try to picture that feeling he had when he finally turned the keys And that engine started and everything he was working for became complete
Yeah, became complete
I know the future can’t be seen
What my future holds? I don’t wanna have to wait and see
So even though I could do more, I think I'm at peace
Cause as long as my car is running, one engine is all I need

(Prehook)
And Music ain’t a part of that (3x)

(Hook) (Locksmith + Legible)
The Enemy, Enemy
Is Inner peace, inner peace
Remember please, all these melodies I wrote
In my half empty glass still trying to stay afloat
