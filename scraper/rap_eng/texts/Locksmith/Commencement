(Spoken) (Locksmith)
Come one, come all!
Don’t miss the great show we have prepared!
Legible, the cautious daredevil  presents his latest effort:
I’m Perfect / Imperfect... A relapse of sorts….illustrating the beauty in sadness
Hold on through the twists and turns of conflicting messages and paradoxes!
Line up and grab a seat when you can…
Because Legible won’t be here long!
Remember: If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it
But do it now before your time is done

(Spoken Word)
In my opinion, this is what I think death would sound like
People have always been afraid of death
But the sooner you accept it as a fact
The sooner you’ll learn to not live in fear of it
The same principle applies to expectations of others
You just gotta move past it
But think about it, the prospect of accepting death is eerie but a relief at the same time
And I know I sound crazy but I believe there’s a conclusion that can be reached in every paradox
You just gotta live on both sides of the contradiction and see how the 2 overlap
So... I think I’ve found that gray area
But things always get a whole lot worse before they get better
So the journey to my conclusion on life and death and all that wasn’t easy
This is my story
And you’re only getting one
So listen closely
