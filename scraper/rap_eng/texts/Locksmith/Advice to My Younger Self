[Intro]
Yo
Ey yo lil' man
Yeah you man I'm talkin' to you
Come over here man let me holler at you for a second
Yo, yo put the ball down man
Some real shit
Listen

[Verse 1]
What's up little fella? I know you're happy and feeling hopeful
I know you play with a sense of love and your heart is noble
I know you vocally haven't learned to express
Whatever repressed trauma, you're still young you're feeling less
And unless you talk about it, it follows you like a cloud
Or some heavy baggage you have to drag through a crowd
But for now it's just a drop in the well, you shake it off
Never speak it again 'til your career is taking off
But we often overlook what we look upon in a rearview
You never touch a drug cause your parents won't let it near you
You dabble with addiction of money, women and stardom
But the camera lens could be a narcotic, don't try to bargain
If you bought her with a sense of morality, more tragedy
But falls the foundation, I hope you find you some patience
I hope you don't put your faith in man, it never helps
Even trust could be a vice, some advice to my younger self

[Chorus]
Some advice to my younger self
Just advice to my younger self
Some advice to my younger self
Even trust could be a vice, some advice

[Verse 2]
And I tell you, never play it safe and never settle for second
Never hesitate, not even just for a second
Never second guess, if you say it then manifest it
But be careful who you say it to, some people will try to test it
If you think, use reflection, have sex then use protection
If you meet a girl and don't, then make sure you have a connection
If she keeps it then you're stuck with that woman, don't wanna hear it
If she doesn't then the guilt you'll feel later will kill your spirit
Make sure you earn some money but money is not your god
Just a means to purchase things, put family before your job
Put God before your family and love before your lust
Protect yourself at all times, put truth before trust
Never fuss with ignorant folks, actions are much louder
You retreat to keep the peace, that does not make you a coward
If you focus on you, you can never go unfelt
Not a lecture, just a lesson I give to my younger self

[Chorus]
Some advice to my younger self
Just advice to my younger self
Some advice to my younger self
Even trust could be a vice, some advice
