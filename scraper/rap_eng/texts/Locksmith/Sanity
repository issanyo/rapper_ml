[Pre-Hook]
I got this feelin,' I got this feelin'
You told me it's good, but I know that somethin' is buildin'
I look at my hood and I know how niggas is dealin'
They want me to stop, but I know somethin' is buildin'

[Hook]
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'

[Verse 1]
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
A part of me wants to be calm, but it's buildin'
I can no longer keep yieldin'
They only talk about half of the problem
The problem is what is instilled in
But what if you Black & you half Middle East
That's double the reason to kill him
I know the target is aimin' at me
Fuck it, I said I just wanna be free
Pray for my niggas whose still in the street
Watch where you go cause there's two enemies
Watch what you say if you wanna survive
How can you cope if you livin' deprived
How can you vote when you know it's a lie
Searching for meaning, but no one replies
I know that hatred is never the answer , the cancer is bleeding through all of their speech
How you react to an act with a cynical tact is the reason why your spirit is breached
That's just the fuel for the fire for those that conspire to keep what they have out of reach
Life is a right for us all, not a privilege
If you don't see that, then how can you sleep

[Pre-Hook]
I got this feelin,' I got this feelin'
You told me it's good, but I know that somethin' is buildin'
I look at my hood and I know how niggas is dealin'
They want me to stop, but I know somethin' is buildin'

[Hook]
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'

[Verse 2]
Picture frame with a missin' name
On a the night stand in a mothers' room
In the mothers' womb was a seed that would grow to a man
Raised on a path only a few understand
Raised on a path on a feud with his fam
They wanna try to ridicule dude for his plan
He wanted to help the neighborhood that he grew in so he joined the boys in blue with the badge
Ain't good his homies they holdin' contempt
Caught in a fire cause no one is exempt
Now there's a mother & daughter that grieves for a father who is murdered because of resent
Meant to be cautionary if you cross the barrier then you'll see what's the extent
We are so lost it's scary
Every loss it varies cause we all need a reason to vent
Write you a speech that won't bring back a life
Type out a tweet that won't fully suffice
We are so disconnected that we disrespect & just look at each other with spite
And it's the fuel for the fire for those who conspire to keep what they have out of site
Life is a right for us all, not a privilege
How can you kill & then sleep through the night

They want me to stop, but I know somethin' is buildin'

[Hook]
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'

I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
I got this feelin', I got this feelin'
