[Verse 1: Locksmith}
Self esteem is a selfish theme to a selfless being
I separate myself from myself but never with held the steam
Was dealt the king with a 5 and a face card, to face god, a face scare with a face guard or play the race card
We race hard to our destinies and trip ourselves as we hurdle through life's little complexities
But whats complex to me is my complexion was the only thing that kept people guessing
Do you think less of me?
Uhhh, and my brother was my role model, he told me study this pimping and watch the hoes follow
But what can happen is after the mackings done and you left with a scorn women she won't stop until you both grovel
Plus its hard to give your child support when you're late with your child support and your baby momma wants to file in court
Uhhh, now you're checking, your soul is garnished, punching holes in your own apartment

[Hook: Allen Ritter]
Ive got to be stronger, i can't let trails bring me down
But I'm on my own, I'm on my own
In this lonely world

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Self esteem is a selfish theme to a selfless being
I separate myself from myself but never would've sell them scene
A Celtic king is as helpless as any wealth less being
Was dealt to dream so detrimental my mental felt the sting
Embellishing to the fella selling him hellish dreams
The smell of cream enveloped their melons and started peddling
The ghetto seen killing bitches with out a [?] and watch them tell the future no Celestine
Uhhh, fussing with momma with what she would teach us, we use to argue over God and the color of Jesus
But we agreed there's only one just different believers
The trinity was sent to me, i rejected the preaches
Still i headed to church when it was mothers day and i admit i was moved when i saw my mother pray
If i could bring her back id do it all another day, fuck the world and what the they say

[Hook: Allen Ritter]
Ive got to be stronger, i can't let trails bring me down
But I'm on my own, I'm on my own
In this lonely world
