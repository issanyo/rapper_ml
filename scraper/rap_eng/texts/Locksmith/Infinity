[Verse 1: Jeff Turner]
I say what I wanna up in this inkblot
Cause in this life there are thinkers and think-nots
They want me to quit moving 'til my feet stop
Heart pumping to the rhythm of my beatbox
While my wristwatch gonna ticktock, it don't get my time
Tryna have friends, never had them, they don't hit my line
I'm trying to take these days and invest for a while
Relearning how to live my life like the steps of a child
Don't wanna be cool in high school, I wanna be dope in college
Don't wanna be pretty good, I wanna be fucking polished
I don't wanna be cute, I wanna be handsome
I ain't beggin' no label no more to hand over the loot, I'm demanding a ransom
With a 12 gauge, not a handgun
I don't want no free throw but a 3 point fade away shot, and one
Basically I'm saying I want more than what they offer
Because now I know my worth and I ain't hiding from the monster, I'mma get it

[Hook]
And I'mma be what I'm gonna be
And I'mma see what I'm gonna see
Ain't no shame in my game homie this is me
You know that my potential infinity
And I'mma be what I'm gonna be
And I'mma see what I'm gonna see
Ain't no shame in my game homie this is me
You know that my potential infinity

[Verse 2: Jeff Turner]
My pen is perfectly poised
Pieces of papers piled up, that's how I stay employed
Peter Piper picked a pack of pickle rappers and I
Pointed pistols of poetry penetrating their paws poison absorbed
Life ain't always sweet sometimes it's diabetic
Depression told me "You ain't got no parents, you pathetic"
Got my PhD in preservation my guidance was prosthetic plus
Papa was a preacher so partner I'm prophetic
That means that I've seen a couple things that are mean that'll make you scream
Got a demon in a dream in a scene that I only see on screens
But I'm me I'm the king gotta lead and it's all about what I bring
So I'd rather have us kiss the sky, we never kiss the ring
You don't get it, they won't behave in our DNA
It costs to be the boss, but never pays to be a slave
Look, this is your life and your call
Just don't let the way that you were raised become the reason you fall
And I'mma get it

[Hook]
And I'mma be what I'm gonna be
And I'mma see what I'm gonna see
Ain't no shame in my game homie this is me
You know that my potential infinity
And I'mma be what I'm gonna be
And I'mma see what I'm gonna see
Ain't no shame in my game homie this is me
You know that my potential infinity

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Now it don't matter what they say about me
They can't go a day without me
Even though they come around I know they feel some way about me
Been on this road so long, seems like every day is cloudy
I find a way to go on, even though these haters doubt me
And I seen it vividly that it never happens instantly
But it all switch up eventually
[?] industry
I, know my intentions seem law deep but that's essentially
Why these niggas have contempt for me, but I know what my heart is meant to be
Picture me, follow us, try
Worship is something that is hollow inside
You never could tell what your mom could hide
You even let go you swallow your pride
I was advised, never be different just listen and stay in your lane
Find it pathetic or you could be [?]pathetic there's someone that is sharing his pain
This is a shame
Never wanna be that person that is emerged in such a deep burden that he keeps searching for a diversion knowing he's hurting this is the serpent
You must redeem my worth
For we can never be free if we cling to this earth, I know

[Hook]
And I'mma be what I'm gonna be
And I'mma see what I'm gonna see
Ain't no shame in my game homie this is me
You know that my potential infinity
And I'mma be what I'm gonna be
And I'mma see what I'm gonna see
Ain't no shame in my game homie this is me
You know that my potential infinity
