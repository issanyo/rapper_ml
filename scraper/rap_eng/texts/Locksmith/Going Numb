[Verse 1]
Uh, we all met at the emergency room
Putting in a call to big sis that an emergency looms
Consider this a courtesy I certainly groomed
Not to freak out, but momma needs surgery soon
I'm at the front desk, digging through her purse
Tryna find a medical card, talking to this male nurse
And what prevails worse, is when this dude leaned over and asks "How much do you charge to sell a verse?"
I almost lost it, I'm tryna fight my tears
This nigga on the computer googling Locksmith
Blasting my youtube battles off
Should I slap this nigga or should I laugh it off
But that's the nonsense I deal with
Being halfway famous coping with real shit
But I learned about it real quick
To this day I never feel shit!

[Hook]
I feel I'm going numb
What have I become?
How do I survive?
Look at what I've done?
Look at all the pain and it's only just begun
I'm tryna find myself and there's nowhere to run
I think I'm going numb
What have I become?
Look at what I've done
Look at all the pain and it's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Uh, and now i'm gettin' inpatient
Pissed off cause we never should of been waiting
I mean its hospital policy
When it's life or death that person becomes an Inn patient
But we still inside of the ER
Right next to dope fiends receiving CPR
And these doctors is being retards
This close to death and they treating with dis-regard
But that's a part of life challenges
Tryna figure this out and how I manage this
Swinging my fist into they calluses
I wrote this verse to the beats of your dialysis
And now it's just your face as an imagery
Remember me as your last son eventually
We all bound to meet you up there
Though I feel it's not fair, I find peace in your memory

[Hook]
I feel I'm going numb
What have I become?
How do I survive?
Look at what I've done?
Look at all the pain and it's only just begun
I'm tryna find myself and there's nowhere to run
I think I'm going numb
What have I become?
Look at what I've done
Look at all the pain and it's only just begun
