They say half of something is better then all of nothin'
I-I'd rather have nothin' than be a bitch
I seen grown men worship other grown men
And cater to that emotions in hopes of becoming rich
But it's hard to believe when you perceive it from the bleachers
I witness it first hand, the first hand before it breaches
Niggas suck blood for that fortune and famed
Forcin' the blame, but the thing is that they need it more then the leeches
So here's an example of what the premise is
Star-studded occasion, I'm on the premises
Ball players and models, bottles of brown
He calls 'em around cause he's addicted to what the image is
The more you deny is like the more it shows
Have you noticed that rich niggas have the poorest souls
You can't ignore it, explore it or even scoff
But regardless how you spin it to people ,you still lost

You still lost, regardless how you see it my nigga is your lost
Yeah, yeah, feeling like my life is about to change
Feeling like nothing gonna be the same aah
Nothing is what it seems
Chasing my dreams

Some people don't see a house until after it's built
Some people will buy shit if you wrap it in silk
Some people don't understand the respect that you demand
Until you say fuck Ã©m all. Then your passion is felt
Other folks, smother hope and re-package they greed
And try to sell you back to you when they think you naive
Other folks sell it dream while plotting no other scheme
Throw a guilt trip on you when they think you might leave
I admit I was peeved, but honestly I believe
Every action has a purpose to the surface i heave
And the baggage accumulated and too soon that they perceive
What I do is a threat, don't wanna se me succede
Don't wanna see me excel than let them ball it
But I couldn't just leave see I was large in that
Niggas wanna subtweet but that ain't hard to detect
But I rather be me than the facade that you rep
See I rather be me than the facade that you rep
Niggas wanna subtweet but that ain't hard to detect
Feeling like my life bout to change uh
Feeling like nothing gonna be the same now
Nothin' is what it seems, chasing my dreams
Tell the person your dreams and they defer it
Tell the person your green and they prefer it
Tell the person you reconsider the scope
But what they spoke will be the truth and they prove is whether they blur it
And ain't funny how people have an affect on you
Interfere so their inner-fears project on you
Any opportunity giving they try to step on you
When it happens, you happy cause now it's less on you
Free to pursue your dreams without strings
Cause you could be rich even without things
Accustomed to  customizing a life that you knew was never right
Now you pray just to get out clean
So put your pride on some sabbatical
There's not a personal on Earth that's infallible
Never thought that these words was this powerful
Make 'em pay they ever doubt on you

Don't wanna get in this place
Lost in the crowd, blendin till im obsolete
If I just fade to grey and leaving no trace
Might as well be an extincy
I try to say, what I'm trying to say
Don't wanna lose my way
What I'm trying to say
Don't wanna lose my way
Don't wanna lose my way
Don't wanna lose my way
I don't wanna lose my way for you, for you
