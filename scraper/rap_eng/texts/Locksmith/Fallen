[Intro: Locksmith]
It's like uhhh, everybody's looking for answers, i don't have em

[Verse 1: Locksmith]
I woke up feeling helpless, the television depresses me, emotional propaganda represses me
I try to spread love instead but every time i look up another body is bled, another quota is feed
Another death no indictment, the media reacts with excitement
The right wing says poor people are criminals. Natural law, these deaths are the residuals
A necessary means that justify the ends, in order to survive we sacrificing limbs
The system is implied, you wanna get out alive? you either fall in line or you wind up like them
And this is just the root of a bigger issue that lingers, conspiracy theorists scream more coffins for FEMA
Worse case you could've shot him in his femur, we all have to answer to time, the redeemer

[Hook: Locksmith]
Feels like I've been falling, falling far away
Feels like no tomorrow, so i hold on today
Feels like I've been falling, falling far away
Feels like no tomorrow, so i hold on today

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
I went to sleep feeling restless, the internet depresses me, instead actually talking you'd rather message me
I think about having kids and leaving a legacy, we embrace fake and avoid truth like leprosy
(we equate fate to attention and seek it desperately, focus on the sythem instead of the discrepancies)
As long as I'm alive and respected, i never understand how we're so disconnected
Infected with a plague that instead hounds humility, the dirty little secret we dread and count ability
They must account for the countless amount of victims, we must account for the ignorance we depicting
And this is just a root of a dying tree that is poisoned, you can't just cut you must dig up to avoid it
Runs deeper than bloody sneakers and badges, violence is part of our culture, utter madness

[Hook: Locksmith]
Feels like I've been falling, falling far away
Feels like no tomorrow, so i hold on today
Feels like I've been falling, falling far away
Feels like no tomorrow, so i hold on today

[Verse 3: Locksmith]
If there's heaven above then there's hell below, some people are born rich, some inherently broke
Some hide behind a mask that they carry a cloak, too afraid to let their transparencies show
If you look past the image that people use to buffer, you most likely find a broken soul that suffers
Our only threat is us, when its said then there's nothing to discuss
I'm talking about race, sex, class, religion, anything we can to expand our division
No need for repetition, yeah you here but you never really listen

[Hook: Locksmith]
Feels like I've been falling, falling far away
Feels like no tomorrow, so i hold on today
Feels like I've been falling, falling far away
Feels like no tomorrow, so i hold on today
