(Verse 1: Locksmith)
Yeah
I don’t know what to believe
I don’t know what’s comin’ over me
I used to pray on my knees
Begging for God to notice me
Maybe my problem is me
Maybe my demons are trolling me
I could’ve easily signed with a label
But I don’t want no one controlling me
I know integrity’s better than money
But money’s something I know I need
People are desperately looking for purpose
But nothing in this life you know is free
(Yeah)
You pay with your soul or pay with your sanity
You pay with your wallet or wallow in pity because nothing is guaranteed
For me this is therapy
This is the air I breathe
This is the part they don’t care to see
I have a fear of commitment I want to slow down but gotta choose carefully
(Yeah)
See one of my ex’s said it with clarity
If I continue this way I’ll wake up one day with nobody there for me
I look at people online
Postin’ up pics of relationship goals
But when I check back in a week I’m like where they relationship go?
(Yeah)
Not understandin’ we’re hurting ourselves
Focus on others opinions more than that person them self

(Chorus: One Coco)
You look at me like you don’t know what beauty is
And you reach for the stars because you’ll be satisfied
When you see on the ground
And it’s two whole’s divided
You can cry and you can smile and you can bleed we’re the same
You can think and you can fear and you can blame
And we’re in the same world
Yeah we’re in the same world

(Verse 2: Locksmith)
(Yeah)
I get the feeling that people are feeling the fakeness of what they’ve been fed
It’s a lie
Everything’s like a commercial they murder your spirit and sell it back to you surprise
This is the price of the life that you covet the things that you thirst and the people you lust
You can spend all your attention and money to purchase your friends but cannot buy trust
I can’t remember before they dismembered emotional scars how to take ours
We have regrettably put our celebrities up on a pedestal worshipped as gods
Can you afford the ticket to heaven?
How can you rise when chained to the ground?
No longer human we used to consuming we pray to the things to which we have found
I met a girl in a small town
She put a couple big things in perspective
She said people in the city love wealth
Because of that fact we are all disconnected
We have all been infected
Separated by the walls we erected
If you understand race
Then you understand class
Then you understand both are subjective
I see the problem that we are devolving because we have been caught in the web of deceit
We have been stuffing and feeding ourselves with comfortable thoughts and ego obeast
Our egos obese
Searching the streets for the truth cause we starvin’
People are hungry for more
But how can we eat if we’re trapped in a margin?

(Chorus: One Coco)
You look at me like you don’t know what beauty is
And you reach for the stars because you’ll be satisfied
When you see on the ground
And it’s two whole’s divided
You can cry and you can smile and you can bleed we’re the same
You can think and you can fear and you can blame
And we’re in the same world
Yeah we’re in the same world
