They say as long as you don't ask for more than your share, the world will never give you more than you can bare. Bear with me

The butt of every joke when other folks would play foul. Life is a bitter tool of ridicule that they plow. Enough to make the even great bow. How else can you explain or say how what happened to Junior Seau. Conversations with my pops, crying as he packing my mother's clothes in a box. It's hard to watch just seeing what type of state he's in. It never dawned on me, like what if he wants to date again? And if he does could I accept it? And if he chooses to would my mother be disrespected?  Nobody knows what it's like to become a widower, to lose the one you love and move on, does that belittle her? Try to reconsider what litters a person's soul. For years I had a problem with reaching for certain goals. What did satan say to Eve? Just God and the serpent knows. From the day I hit the stage and that final curtain close

I feel like getting high to forget about life. A n**** need something just to feel alright all night all right. Let me float away, just another day, we looking to wipe the  shame or something to numb the pain

I used to want to be rich and wife a chick that's gorgeous. Now I just want to help my father pay his mortgage. Now I just want to see my brother finish school and make sure my nieces and nephews are there see him through. I'm seeing through what you perceive as true plus you taught me growing up was more important than being cool. But you would tease him too, being cruel was the topic. They told me I wasn't black and said I was adopted. Adopted a style and swag, protect me from what they had in store but hit my core, confided within dad. I compensated to compensate for my melanin or lack there of scared of the inner hell in him. But what's propelling him can make a n***** eyes welt. I never thought I'd see the day my father needed my help. I guess we all gotta grow until the day I touch the grave and that final curtain close

So let the motherf****** record show. The question ain't why we get high but why is a n**** low?
