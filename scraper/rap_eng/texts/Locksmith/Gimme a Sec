[Intro]
[?]
Confidence is everything, my nigga
All you niggas riding waves
Feel me?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm taking the fundamental approach when I focus in
Dealing with negative folks won't extend
Any ambition, I had to seek out a mission
I had to sleep in the kitchen when I was hopeless then
Niggas they try to boast, I don't fit in
Rather than try to cope I wrote with pen
Told me to dumb it down, the dumber you done it, the dummies 'll bump it
And money will come in until you drown
Niggas steady frown but I'm feasting
I don't need a boss or a label to police me
I don't need a foe or a loss to increase me
Did it for a year then I told them to release me
That's just the bruises you take when you finally arrive
Scraping my checks man I had to survive
Suffocating, I suffered waiting, I'm supplicating my income the shit stung, bottled my pride
Follow my conscience I skipped all the nonsense no cosign or sponsor I breathe
Out of my nostrils for every apostle that's 400 waiting to mock as you bleed
They don't understand then they wanna pass judgement
Rather have spam than a stand with substance
Pussy niggas salivating and celebrating any celebrity selling them any shine cause they never had a spine
Me I got a big mouth, hear me out
In fear I would interfere, they steered to clear me out
Y'all been living in the big house, I'm here now
They burning the slave quarters I'm turning the page forward
Raised in the projects, the process
Mind numbing, niggas is fine coming
To the game with a lot less
My guess, they cool with it so I tell them God bless
Fucking with anybody pretending is really probably the biggest landmine you can find (no)
Trusting a person that you had thought was deserving is even worse when you gotta sever ties (go)
To the extreme now for someone who seems down was sorta the theme now (show)
Any emotion any devotion that you hoped to receive is a steed that you never shoulda rode
Selling you lies cause they fresh outta truth
Blaming the tide but that's not no excuse
How can you follow a wave and then try to behave like you didn't look down on it too
Niggas will tell you that something is lame, wait for like three years and then do the same
I just continue in my lane while keeping the mindframe of flaming you motherfuckers who act obtuse

[Chorus]
All you niggas riding waves (waves)
Look to me to do the same (same)
Y'all too busy counting plays (countin')
Counting money bitch I'm paid

[Verse 2]
And I don't give a fuck for anybody but few
I don't say much until they got in my view
I don't adhere to any notion of fear
I'm revered by the folks who really know what I do, so I flew
To a whole 'nother coast and made the most of the bad hand I was dealt until I felt things slip
Thought I was ready but I was stalling my heart is heavy and fallin apart is petty the hate I caught a bevy
Let it be said if I shed blood it wasn't in vain, now they want me to tame myself
Niggas see the life I portray as some sort of a game and for that had to blame myself
They see it all as so simple deceiving the tempo there's nothing to prove
I just continue with my lane while keeping the mindframe of flaming you motherfuckers who act obtuse

[Chorus]
All you niggas riding waves (waves)
Look to me to do the same (same)
Y'all too busy counting plays (countin')
I'm counting money bitch I'm paid
