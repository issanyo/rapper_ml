[Hook: Locksmith]
I know where I belong
I know it's hard
I know where I went wrong
Now, gotta find a way to go on
I know where I belong

Find Me (x6)
I know where I went wrong
Find Me (x6)
I know where I belong

[Verse 1: Locksmith]
Have you ever been
So frustrated you could give up
So terrified where you end up
So many expectations that you place on yourself
They're too much for you to live up
The friends that you once had switch up
The wool on your eyes you could lift up
The people in your life criticize and advise you to quit
But you really don't give a fuck
Forget about the troubles that you own
Forget about the mortgage on your home
Forget about the job that they force you to get
You about ready to quit
Cause it won't pay off your student loan
You alone, but you long with an appetite
Everything that you're after, right?
My mom passed away with some credit card debt and
Them motherfuckas is still looking for her in the afterlife
My God
Can a nigga find peace in death?
Exhale from a decent breath?
Just when you thought there was nothing in the respirator you found air when you least expect
My Grandma still got hope for my uncle strung out
Locked up on a recent stretch
So you can find faith in yourself
And escape what is felt when you're faced with your deepest threat
Yes Lord

[Hook: Locksmith]
I know where I belong
I know it's hard
I know where I went wrong
Now, gotta find a way to go on
I know where I belong

Find Me (x6)
I know where I went wrong
Find Me (x6)
I know where I belong

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
And they say
Go to school, get a job, a certificate
Feed into it
Now you significant
But you hate where you work and your manager's a jerk
And you only stay cause you need the benefits
What good is having health insurance when you ain't got no self-assurance?
Then they say Lock
You better watch what you say in these songs
Being honest is a wealth deterrent
I don't give a fuck
I just speak how I feel cause I feel it's needed
Y'all know I'm for real cause you see I'm bleedin'
They deprive us of hope
Consuming until we broke
When you try and reach for it you cannot retrieve it
Conceit is the language of the fallen
Everybody worried 'bout ballin'
Everybody steps on the necks of each other
Try to get out the gutter
You be out for a second then you fall in
Lost in a cloud of emotion
Screams from a crowd of commotion
All they do is force-feed people what they want to
Sort of like these rappers and they album promotion
Not just you, nigga
Thousands are broken
Millions are hurtin'
Billions are searchin'
If you can find faith in yourself and escape from your self
You can find life and its purpose
I know

[Bridge: Rebecca Nobel]
No matter where you are, so as long as you go on
No matter where you go, as long as you find me

[Hook: Locksmith and Rebecca Nobel]
Find Me (x6)
I know where I went wrong
Find Me (x6)
I know where I belong

[Bridge: Locksmith]
I know where I belong
I know it's hard
I know where I went wrong
Now, gotta find a way to go on
I know where I belong
So find me
