I don't wanna leave, but I can't just rush
I don't wanna leave, but they say I must
I don't wanna be in the box they put me in, put me in slight disgust

I don't wanna feel, but I can't just touch
I don't wanna give in to anxiousness
Plus I was raised in The Rich, where people do snitch, better check your neighbors trust

So how the fuck you live your life pretending, then try to judge me cause I don't agree with your opinion
Life is not a Twitter post, that's why I watch you niggas close
Your silly thoughts have no dominion

Fuck your swag, plus you're mad
Ppl wanna pry your life & discuss your past
I was right there when my cousin got popped
I don't care what you think, I don't want your past
But I gotta tell mom that I can't get paid while I'm stuck in class
Still I'm stuck on this destructive path

They tell us what to wear, when to speak, who to fuck, what to eat
I don't even listen to music unless it's something deep
I don't even fuck with these rappers cause they're pursuing me
We don't even sing the same tune, nigga are you in key?

The day Obama won I was perplexed, I had to suppress my inner strength with resolution
Everybody was happy to see a black man, but that's the day they sucked away our spirit of revolution

But I ain't here to criticize what some folks epitomize
What one man sees as truth the other man considers lies
What you see as a victory is a trick to me
And when it falls apart, don't expect me to sympathize

In the ghetto where the niggas serve crack
Talk shit cause they want their turf back
These haters sleepin on me, time to go take a dirt nap

And they say this is a post racial country
But Try telling that to black folks that's going hungry
Try telling that to black folks that's living comfy

They don't give a fuck about nothing
But themselves
What they sell is a lifestyle impossible to reach
And provide a false hope for broke niggas in the streets

See, I don't succumb to fear
So don't expect to just throw me a couple crumbs & that makes up for 400 years
Monkey see, monkey do, monkey bleed, nothing new
If you strongly disagree, then probably the monkey is you
And all you niggas do is take shots at me, but what it proves to me is really you are not happy

I don't wanna leave, but I can't just rush
I don't wanna leave, but they say I must
I don't wanna be in the box they put me in, put me in slight disgust
