[Intro: Locksmith]
I mean, everybody's selfish. No body believes it but everybody is

[Verse 1: Locksmith]
Wasting these moments, emotions motion my motives and most of it molds my character
Married to my ego, fornicate with hysteria. Starring back like I'm back on the back of my black diamond
Back tints is balling, the spokes racing from sirens. Defining my findings, finally finding my faith contested
Unbeknownst to any ounce of jealousy that was sequestered, detected my own thoughts
Acknowledged my arrogance, look back at my past tweets felt this sense of embarrassment
Barring with my girl leaving, been six months but I'm still coping, still holding onto this front
Punctured it spills open, people stop and chat like nigga your life's in tact, give a swift pat on the back
Rather conceal than reveal its broken, still promoting this image of  true perfection
Soliciting different women just hoping they using discretion
Bad habits of old and not easily controlled, you know the more you fell depressed less likely you are to use protection?
Raw emotions evoking under this comforter, after she wakes up I know she wants me to comfort her
Coming from being deeply committed for four years to looking at my ex's Instagram page, barely can stomach her
And the girl I'm fucking now is looking at me ashamed, will I ever take her back? I'm sort of deep in the game
And its true the possibility be dancing in my mind but when you cross a certain line you never see them the same
And a part of me has change, I ain't playing like i once did, reminds me of the time I got a message from this one kid
Who said, "lock just know that my words are indication that  music that you making is truly an inspiration
You're fueling a generation don't you ever lose sight, no matter how hard it gets you better take time to write
You better take time despite the bullshit that they been feeding us, they do it for attention you do it because you believe in us"

[Hook: Jarell Perry]
Where you go, on the road is never to far from home and you should know
When you given your everything, you get back on your feet again
All on your own, its hard to see what its for but you should know
Through the highs and lows, do it all for the love
Do it all for the love, do it all for the love
Do it all for the love, do it all for the love

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
And lately everything is just a blur and i can't go a week without someone mentioning her
And i can't even speak without someone pinching a nerve, so i try and keep my distance whenever this does occur
And every day proceeding is bleeding one to the next and now its to the point i don't even look at my texts
And people get upset when you try and tell them direct, that you don't have time to chill
And this builds a disconnect and this billed as disrespect
When its nothing more than just truthful and i can't help the fact i don't look at things like i use to
Blame myself for the isolation is true but when you burnt so many times, to survive what would you do?
Cause everything ugly has some beauty, regardless how you view me. I'm still her the new me
And if you know me you know this to be true i can only stand here and be me, is that enough for you?

[Hook: Jarell Perry]
Where you go, on the road is never to far from home and you should know
When you given your everything, you get back on your feet again
All on your own, its hard to see what its for but you should know
Through the highs and lows, do it all for the love
Do it all for the love, do it all for the love
Do it all for the love, do it all for the love
