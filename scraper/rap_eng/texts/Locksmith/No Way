[Intro]

I know what it means…
I know what to do now…
I saw it in my dreams…
I know I’m in tune now… (x2)

[Verse 1]

I’ve been on a grind. I’ve been on the road
I’ve been hard to find, I’ve been all alone
People from the  past blowing up my phone
I don’t owe a dime, I did it on my own
I’m living my dream, I never want to stop to soak them in
I’m just trying to find a way, I remember nobody noticed him
I just take it day to day, never want to come that close again
You can say I’m crazy hey, I never want to feel being broke again
I never want to be so quick to leave and just quill the thieves
Niggas never want to see you where they wish to be
This industry so I instantly put a wall in between what it’s been to me
Yeah, but I know where my destiny lies
I put in my ten thousand hours and now I’m empowered I feel like I finally arrived, wassup?

[Bridge: Rebecca Nobel]

So far, so far away
My dreams, my dreams away

[Hook: Locksmith and Rebecca Nobel]

I know when it’s gone
It’s gone it’s whatever now
I’m moving on for the better now
I’m letting go it’s forever now (x2)

[Verse 2]

I don’t want to waste my time and start to feel
I can never live with how I’m billed
I know life and can be misleading breeding doubt somehow I deal
I know certain people never really thought I’d get this far, but still
Kept believing in myself I told myself I would never yield
I know disappointment stings and I know everything it brings
Can either break you down or make you strong and build your self-esteem
I don’t open up too often I stay guarded that’s my thing
Better watch who you share your hopes with never let no one kill your dreams
I’ve been through the dirt and back again told I was next and passed again
Said I would never sign back with a label and almost fell in the trap again
I know that my music is deeper than what they’ve been trafficking
A tragic binge the facts are in I knew you would hate me when it's factored in
Fact of the matter I know myself, where was y’all when I got no one’s help?
No one felt the need to be seen when there was no scene I almost fell
Yeah, but I know where my destiny lies
I put in my ten thousand hours and now I’m empowered I feel like I finally arrived, wassup?

[Bridge: Rebecca Nobel]

So far, so far away
My dreams, my dreams away

[Hook: Locksmith and Rebecca Nobel]

I know when it’s gone
It’s gone it’s whatever now
I’m moving on for the better now
I’m letting go it’s forever now (x2)

[Verse 3]

Yeah…
Yeah…

And I all I ever wanted was you to notice me
Don’t be shocked you know it’s me
All the things that held me back just made me strong unknowingly
No one sees the pain your suffered towards still you must endure
Your only hope is what’s in store
Even though you know it’s bleak even know you know it’s steep
Even though you cut me deep, I tried to conceal it still even though it took it’s toll on me
So it seems if you can sew it seems then I can sew its seams
To be the fruits to focus on my dreams cause

[Outro]

I know what it means…
I know what to do now…
I saw it in my dreams…
I know I’m in tune now… (x2)
