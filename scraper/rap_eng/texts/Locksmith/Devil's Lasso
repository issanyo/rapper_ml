You know [repeat 4x]
[Hook]
I’m breakin’ it down simple and plain, you baffled
I’m Kunta, you Toby, you livin’ in chains and shackles
Imagine if Adam had never had tasted apple, would we still be in the devil’s lasso?

[Verse 1]
Okay my soul prolific, flow is cryptic, flow inflicted, so much wicked, over sick shit to these niggas here they think it’s coke inflicted
My souls’ conflicted, I’m so restricted, I’m no statistic, I’m so sadistic that most critics over-glimpse it
I’m over-drenched in that potent stench from this older pimp shit, I’m so intense that my older bitch said I’m so relentless, I poke my stick in that open trench that you call a clitoris to overcompensate your non-commitment bitch
I’m livin’ my life in a manner demandin' the man in the mirror to manage the manic depressant that’s livin’ inside of my head before I go dead cause I know, the more that you give it, the more they consider it weak and these niggas tweakin’ they speakin’ on shit that they don’t know with more ghost writers than the bible, look

[Hook Alt. Version]

I’m breakin’ it down simple and plain, you baffled
I’m Kunta, you Toby, you livin’ in chains and shackles
Imagine if Adam had never had tasted apple, would we still be in the devil’s lasso, who knows

[Verse 2]
Okay now life is like the funniest thing, what money can bring is nothin’ extreme, they funnel your dream, they sucking you beam, they fucking you clean, you ass out
They orchestrate the course of fate with morbid hate, then towards the straight path that niggas forced to take, you run until you passed out
The last outta my region that can really spit, all these other emcees is on that silly shit, you should really quit, or better run like Rev Run, y’all little niggas is on Diggy shit
Yeah this is that grown man flow, Uncle Sam got you niggas like Sambos, ask around, even your man knows, so dope when you sniff it burn your man nose
Post Pac, but apocalyptic see Lock is gifted, y’all constricted and bit down on the opposition, my observation this is more than a simple rap flow, still stuck inside the devil’s lasso, you know
