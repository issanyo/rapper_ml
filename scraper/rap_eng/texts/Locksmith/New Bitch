[Hook: Aqualung]
Need to know if you're letting go
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I didn't know I was hurting you so
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[Verse 1]
I’m sick of this bullshit, how could you pull this
We was like best friends when you was my new bitch
Now you don’t know me , now you just blow me
Off like I’m solely responsabile know me
Both had a part in this shame, both had a part in this blame
Both had a look at ourselves and see what our heart was displaying
Now you just so cold, now you just so bold
From your new man, I guess I know
But something inside of me’s gone, something inside of me’s dead
Thought you was holding me down but was fucking this nigga instead
How could you feed me these lies, how could I fall for your shit
You said we was already done but how could this happen so quick
How could you love me and leave me and fall out of love and don’t greet me
And tell me you still have some feelings to get with this nigga so easy
Then you just pulled this, feeding me bullshit
Now you’re just old news, I got a new bitch

[Hook: Aqualung]
Need to know if you're letting go
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I didn't know I was hurting you so
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[Verse 2]
Sick of this young shit, sick of this kid shit
Just a few months back was talking like let’s have some kid shit
Now you feel lonely ’cause you call homie
Fuck is some new girl now you are lonely
And I ain’t got time to be talking I ain’t got time to be playing
I ain’t got time for your soaking I know that your heart is decaying
You was just so cold, you was just so bold
Now you want me now but I like the show more
So no you can’t come to my show, no you can’t get on my list
No you can’t meet my new girl and no I won’t cheat won’t you quit
Talking and feeding me lies I’m cutting off all of our ties
See all the anger’s you playing stop trying to say that you tried
How could you love me and leave me and fall out of love and don’t greet me
And tell me you still have some feelings to get with this nigga so easy
Then you just pulled this, feeding me bullshit
Now you’re just old news, I got a new bitch

[Hook: Aqualung]
Need to know if you're letting go
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I didn't know I was hurting you so
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
