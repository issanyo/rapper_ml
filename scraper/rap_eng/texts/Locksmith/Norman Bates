[Intro]
This black mark, this manifestation of exaggerated delinquency has exceeded the boundaries of rational behavior within and without the legal structure that is the very basis of our freedom and way of life
You make respectability sound disrespectful

[Verse 1: Taboo]
The illest thing you ever saw
Competitors bringing pure terror
Thought you could front forever more; that was your error
You'll get ritzed on, I'm a kid from that raw era
So you know I can hold the weight like one of Big Pun's pall-bearers
Been running your jaw, forever glad your mouth's working
I am now certain you all a bunch of foul serpents
Screaming "fuck everybody" when I'm out bursting
Run up in a lobby with a shotty, catch a body like you're crowd surfing
The walls scream cause on screen was scary
Reminiscent of Swamp Thing, even a God-King would fear me
I'm quite >bold?<, I might just start stomping you fairies
And turn your local night club into the prom scene from Carrie
Fairly vicious, you little bitches are in trouble
I spit a missile when I rumble, reduce your city into rubble
It's official, you get crippled in a scuffle
Here to dig your grave with a pick, sickle and a shovel

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Look, Masonic symbols, temples, cathedrals, and tarot cards
Washington monuments, monotheist screaming Pharaoh Gods
Clarence 13X with a thirteen hex
Can the 85 bare the job?
Drew Ali to the Bourgeoisie
But it's true, y'all see he was there  > Farad<
More signs, more defiance
Mortals find it slightly odd
Niggas in the middle of a mental meltdown
When the wrath fell down like a lightning rod
Fighting off with a striking rod
Like a viking raw when I'm writing bars
And I might evolve with a slightly thought
Still in the midst of a 19, y'all
Trapped inside this hell I made, I used to watch this game in awe
Now I look at these rappers like the pussies that they truly are
Sort of like when I met my favorite artist with credentials
Then I realized he was terrified of my potential, bitch
Ravenous dogs
I engrave my name across your mother's vaginal walls
Then I chisel my initials on some tablets in Prague
And make your bitch go down on me after I jog

[Verse 3: Diabolic]
I'm a
Freedom activist smacking a peaceful Pacifist
So fast in his mouth that my fist got teeth attached to it
Hoes scheme to keep my penis pre-ejaculate
Seed in a  secret passage and squeezing a fetus out of it
But I conceive immaculate raps for the inhabitants
That believe in blasphemous acts, not being passionate
Back when people packed in this arena's meeting Maximus
Strategically attacking Caesar, I'm reenacting it
Chief and cannabis sativa, leaving Nazareth
With Jesus fleeing Egypt to squeeze on Cleopatra's tits
Read the manuscript, I wrote a lethal hazardous
Mix of ether with some reefer on a sheet of acid hits
And rap as if an alien breed, a beast, and savages
Took my brain and reattached it with cerebral data chips
Now the people count on me like a beaded abacus
To crush you into dust, but who the fuck is keeping track of it?

[Verse 4: Nino Bless]
You can't tell that I'm sober
I write like I tripped off DMT and fell over
Land in a Richter scale hit 12, get out my cell
Now I feel closure so tell 'Hova I'm soon to be taking Hell over
Let's go, it's that holy next bring Cobras
They'll be locked and loaded, ready gun ho for that Oprah fetti
Giving hope to all these folks that's hopeless
Digging low for pennies through they sofas
Knowing like Greg Oden's legs they never gonna hold up steady
Note this: I ain't very focused all for broke the flow is deadly
Like a heavy dosage of meth injected with dope and ectasy
I hold the semi toe for foes to tempt me
Pull out as fast  as Mario Andretti in a Lola Chevy smoking
And you haters just ain't like me
I grind harder than slaves that make Nikes
The thought of my own grave excites me
A film about me could only star Bruce Lee and be made by Spike Lee

[Verse 5: Apathy]
I will sent for your soul like y'all would get sent to the store
To buy your mother some rubbers
'Cause she's a motherfucking whore
On the floor, puking whiskey, rocking Juicy Couture
The God of War, who fucked up Thor in viking folklore
You never held a .44, your height is like 4'4"
You're shorter than the fuckers on the forest floor of Endor
The Minotaur, Megatron was my mentor
Created from the DNA of dictators, I'm sick as Serpentor
I'm on the pen house floor, with Penthouse whores
Shoot coke in they bad mouths, I'm stuffing in they backdoors
I'm Maximum Overdrive, Mac trucks, you're a Rav 4
You got signed and dropped, what's your label called? Trapdoor?
All the love is so fake, but all the hate is so real
I get more brain than Kraang raping April O'Neil
I'm on my way to your baby mother's, she waiting in heels
To fuck her in the ass, make her squeal, make me a meal

[Verse 6: Coal]
You want beef with the goons?
But how soon before the cops are called?
When foes are disposed with bullet holes the size of matzah balls
Watch the walls turn from white to a reddish hue
That spewed from a bloody crevice that hemorrhaged out of this headless dude
I shredded crews when I abuse with martian edicate
Starving for your carbon better sharpen your jargons rhetoric Confederate villainous a murderous will filling my syllabus
Gorillas dick ground an pound a bitch like Pat Miletich
Illest click alive to survive death of the culture
Slit the throat of the king clip the wings of these vultures
Roast who ever you bring , when I swing it leaves your family shook
Now look what I did, the shit slay more kids than Sandy Hook
You’re candy crooks an by your looks you ain't got a fortune
I'm forcing your slut to spread her butt now she’s fucking Awesome
Contort your spine after a minutes time of talking
Fitted coffins for your clan
My fam will finish lines like Boston
