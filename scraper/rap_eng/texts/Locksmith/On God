[Intro]

Never been shit never had shit never thought I'd get this far
I remember when I would dream this scared I would miss this part
I remember when I was sleepless
Yeah I would wish this hard
Niggas wanna sleep on me, fuck it I embrace it, God
Fuck it I embrace it, God
Niggas wanna sleep on me (on God)
Fuck it I embrace it, God
Niggas wanna sleep on me, fuck it I embrace it, God

[Verse 1: Locksmith]
Never had a chance or a nice view of a life skewed
Or an ice cubes shot in hell
Never had a plan I would write through whatever
Hardships or garbage I could smell
Fell, but I never was derailed, was deemed well
I could only tread in the well so long (so long)
Scratch marks on the inside implies strength
And the concrete all in my palms
There was a distance because I was different
So I would just mimic what's cool
That false pretender will present an issue with his shoes
And that was enough to miss school
Felt too restricted, a fish in a pool I swear
Any condition to ever through I beared
Tried to abandon the randomness
Pants were pissed, buckshot sprinkled the stairs
Fair skin, but I got a dark soul
Walking through the far snow nobody would even notice the boy
Fast-forward, now they're hauling ass toward
Trying to get a grasp for anything I do; my voice
Became a beacon, for anyone seeking, to get out the deep-end, but still I grew
Pollinated in the concrete, underneath your feet, but still somehow got through
Richmond, California, Crescent Park
Let's embark, let's dive deep in the sewer
Underneath the skin come and meet the sin
They shape the landscape we escaped then maneuvered
Come and brake the bow, bow but don't hype me
Every death had an effect on my psyche
Every breath met with a test unless you wanna accept
The missteps that just comes slightly
Pipe to the bitch that you love and covet
You can play polite or make light and shrug it
I was offered a deal worth quarter of a mill
I told them that i rather build, thought nothing of it (nah)
You can take the chance, take the advance
But understand my nigga that is just a loan
I would not accept the terms of interest
To invest in anything I can not own
I was thrown to the wolves to the wolves surprised
I was hungry as him no watered eyes
I was left in the den unable to make friends
So I walked through the hood in a wolf disguise
I followed my passion and followed with actions
I knew they were vital decided to write a new chapter
And go out do something that none of you niggas could rival,        I

[Bridge]
Never been shit never had shit never thought i get this far
I remember when I was sleepless scared I would miss this part
I remember when I would dream this
Yeah I would  wish this hard (this hard)
Niggas wanna sleep on me, fuck it I embrace it, god

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
I study the competition
And look at the composition
They commonly, accommodate
With the comedy they be pitching
I solemnly, take admission
To properly make revision
Niggas showing they ass like, sodomy
Rape in Prison, They pissin' in the wind now
Metaphors get ignored, Put the pen down
Is what they sellin' me
Tellin' me to pretend now
The ingest was in jest an interest
Because of what trends now
Moneys the new God, Pussy is currency
Attention is worth more than honesty, Currently
Encourage these niggas to test me is suicide
Assume a side, or sue a side, You survived
You can die now, i care less, I'm careless
I kill rappers regardless, Who wears vests
Niggas will, Smile in your face while stabbing yo' back
Till they poke through to yo' bare chest
I wear less money, And invest, I impress
Where intellect and talent intersect, Understand
The balance I been a threat, Still upset
Waiting for niggas to interject like

[Outro]
Never been shit never had shit never thought I'd get this far
I remember when I would dream this scared I would miss this part
I remember when i was sleepless
Yeah I would wish this hard (this hard)
Niggas wanna sleep on me, fuck it I embrace it, god
