[Verse 1]
Little lamb in the lion’s grip
Scared to fall asleep in the fear of waking in violent feats
Fuck the industry and all these lying tricks
You can say I’m, face to face with the new me
Tryina come to grips, with the glimpse that only a few see
Few plead the fifth but I rift
Whenever I do see the look on the hater’s face
When they hear I went to a uc
Yeah, and I walk the stage but I left odd
And nowadays you lucky if that will land you a desk job
Interviews are interludes that niggas view with rarity
And rappers selling cd’s might as well ask for charity
Walking through mid town, got hit with a barrage
And nigga tryina push his mixtape, said it's featuring Nas
I listen to this pitch then I slipped him a cold 5
Went home and popped it in
And what do you know, no Nas
No surprise there, this is just my story
Don’t suppose that y’all care
How could you ignore me
I ain’t posing, I swear
And everybody’s a rapper, still I know that I’m rare
I know that I’m there

[Hook]
And I don’t wanna try no more
I don’t wanna lie no more
I don’t wanna ride no more, no
When you giving your all
Put up all on your walls
It all comes down
And I don’t wanna try no more
I don’t wanna ride no more
I don’t wanna lie no more, no
When you giving your all
Put up all on your walls
It all comes down
Fuck love, fuck love
Fuck love, fuck love

[Verse 2]
And I know my mother’s gone, my brother’s sick
My girl is on some other shit
Every time I’m on the phone, she thinks it’s with another chick
How can I explain that I’m just discussing another mix
How is she to blame when my track record is smothered with
Constant infidelity, telling me like you better
But I’m a man and using women is something I used to treasure
No lie, I used to think these girls made me complete
Till I found myself in the space, while I saw the loser was me
And I can never hold myself back from music like I used to
Self inflict my own career with fear, I refuse to
My lyrics were meant to bring emotions like the blues do
Never trust your life with another cause they will use you
But these instrumentals are therapy
I swear to god, every new rapper better be scared of me
I swear to god, ain’t a new rapper you can’t compare to me
And all I really wanted was some clarity

[Hook]
And I don’t wanna try no more
I don’t wanna lie no more
I don’t wanna ride no more, no
When you giving your all
Put up all on your walls
It all comes down
And I don’t wanna try no more
I don’t wanna ride no more
I don’t wanna lie no more, no
When you giving your all
Put up all on your walls
It all comes down
Fuck love, fuck love
Fuck love, fuck love
