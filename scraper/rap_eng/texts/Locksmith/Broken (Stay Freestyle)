[Verse 1: Lock]
Never found comfort in my skin
Never thought my words would sprout limbs
Never thought to but in due time I was due time runnin' through minds I was now in
The space of atonement, toned to a pace of an ego laced I must own it
Motives of emotion motion me to remote ends, mold what is broken
Am I broken?
I was told then I was nothin mo' then
Understand n***a, I could barely stand n***a, I was called white boy, A-rab and n****
And sand n****r
Tryin to find where my purpose lies, it's f****d up understand I was purged inside
Half Black but ashamed of my Persian side
Feelin like one less
From the hood not a hood n***a noneless
Not The Shahs On Sunset, More like B. Shaw shootin' from the Arc
Take one step
Feel my pain, see my goals, know my strain
Know I blame no one but me, was pissed off cause I thought no one f****d with me
Now I'm feelin I should dive in
Put it all in my rhymin
Thinkin how my sister must feel workin in the same hospital that my mother did die in
Lost my job, where that boy went
Put it in my craft, f**k your enjoyment!
Never made the hottest emcee list but I swear to God I'm the hottest on unemployment
This is for the few I rock with
This is for the ones that support my content
This is for all the true folks that ever shared my songs and left me a positive comment
We ain't too far
We gon' reach that
I got passion they can't teach that
Every single last negative person I had in my life got left and I can't reach back, I can't reach back
Better catch up
Got a long journey better rest up
Got a whole 'nother plan on hand but in time things do get messed up
Where I messed up l let that s**t distract me
And let my own goals play the backseat
And push through the bumps exactly and I ain't about to stop for you n****s like a New York taxi
Incompetent
Attract sharks when you're fishing for a compliment
And ain't it funny how they skew your accomplishments
But I'm confident
Yeah

[Verse 2: Jarell]
Round and around and around and around they go..
Tell me now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know..
I don't really care how you feel about it now I know that I can't lose..
Livin my life like I dreamed about it, I'm broken but I won't break
Can't take that away.. no, no
I don't know why they crucify my name..
I'll testify with nothing more to gain..
Don't tell me who I did for, who put me on cause I was born this ready..
This for all the broken ones who took the fall to sharpen up these edges..

Don't really care how you feel about it now I know that I can't lose
Livin my life how I dreamed about it, the broken can never break
Can't take that away.. yeah yeah yeah yeah..
Can't take that away.. can't take that away.. Ooh hoo..
