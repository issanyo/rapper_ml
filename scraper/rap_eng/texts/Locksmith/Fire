[Intro:]
Fire!
Fire!

[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
I'm the master of ceremonies
My ass has never been phony
I ask that you unmask and relax, if that's too much to ask, then blow me
Fuck you!
Pay me now then thank me later, you a fuckin' hater
You the runt of the litter
You should've ate your veggies for dinner, but you a fucking beginner
You're braggin' about the money, frontin' you a breadwinner
I can see right through the eyes of a fool that is standing in debt with the Devils and God
And all of these trinkets, the booty's delicious, my Uzi is vicious despite it's so odd
Fictitious, you die as a witness, and ain't nobody coming to your funeral
You fucked all your friends and you burned all your pages counting all your riches
Now there's only one dish in the sink
Only thing left is the time to think of all of the things that you've lost
On a mission to prove that you was the dude with a fancy due, flossy ship, but a spineless crew
A collarless school boy is tighter than you
Ain't no woos, the game's infused the lames of bruised, I raised the roof
Just trying to educate you with nothing but proof

[Hook: (Locksmith)]
Fire!
Watch what you say
Watch what you do
Cause everything'll come back to you
Fire!
Watch what you say
Watch what you do
Cause everything comes back to you
Fire!
Cause everything comes back to you
Fire! (Yeah! Locksmith! Okay!)

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Way before the metaphors, the global tours and all this rappin'
I was in the middle of a social war, had to record my course of action
My thoughts have fractured, my source of passion
Stems from a place of impulse reactions
Every misstep was a missed rep
Had to invest, never waiting on your compassion
I'm man enough to admit my flaws
Put a flame to a lie and it will get thawed
Every single opinion is like a mist or fog
People wanna pretend that they attend for applause
It's plausible if I paused and pulled
And my paws'll pull apart all your limbs
I seen how this industry kills
It eventually rips you to pieces from all your friends
And if every minute you try to repent, some people wanna diminish everything that you work hard for
When you finally get a foot in the business
They wanna hop in your business
Jump on your dick like you do parkour
But I'm too hardcore to reduce our force
Somebody that wanna put me in a noose, I'm 'board
At the very thought of you rappers that wanna get at us, you get burnt by the flame I fuse I'm sure

[Hook:]
Fire!
Watch what you say
Watch what you do
Cause everything'll come back to you
Fire!
Watch what you say
Watch what you do
Cause everything comes back to you
Fire!
Cause everything comes back to you
Fire!

[Bridge: (Ubiquitous)]
If you play with fire you get burnt
(And a word: if you play to burn, your karma gonna give 'em what they deserve)
If you play with fire you get burnt
(What up Kung Fu? And Locksmith? U-B-I!!!)

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]
Do you really wanna play with me? (Nah!)
Ignite the past, and explode any hopes of containing me (Raw!)
You better watch how you came at me
Whatever you do effects you, you're chained to me (Ah!)
So whenever you take aim at me
You take aim at you, the same thing to me
Bang bang when it bursts in your brain of view
What have you done? What of Kurt Cobain would do
Trying to skip a link, entertain a fool
But I'm mister pink to these grays and blues
I get a change of mood when I sip a drink
Disperse the curse and encrypt the gink (HA!)
Let's be honest, I'm half bad, yes!
If you really want it, you can have that - mess!
Let it roll like the good times, if you stay on my good side you be #Blessed
Everybody trying to win, truth is, I'ma have to lose, one path to choose
Everything goes around, comes around, whatever you do comes back to you (Brrrah)
You know, that's how the truth go
They pretend they can bend me like Zuko
Someone try to get around me like loophole
But cross me and burn up fast
I'm finna turn up gas!

[Hook:]
Fire!
Watch what you say
Watch what you do
Cause everything'll come back to you
Fire!
Watch what you say
Watch what you do
Cause everything comes back to you
Fire!
Cause everything comes back to you
Fire!

[Outro:]
Everything comes back to you!
Back to you!
Fire!
Cause everything comes back to you
