Uh

No big homie, no corporation
No diss, only my motivation
I notice most of 'em go with waves 'n'
I go against the current I currently feel encaged in
Raised in a city, civility's disability
This umbilical cord is the discontent for humility
Silly rapper you privileged, lyin' (?) you pretend to be
I disconnect from your withered spoon like Ryan Phillippe
Fill up this web-browser with lead showers and minstrels
Nocturnal journals of un-nurtured potential
Essential tools when exploiting black youth
Multi-racial pickaninnies they pick as a substitute
Suck the truth from the culture, leave you a hollow shell
Fuck an album, algorithms with ad agency sales
Two thousand for a placement, five hundred and your statement from a playlist
That type of math is not adjacent
We chasin' after dreams that we only appear to know
Birds never change feathers, they weather but (?)
You want advice? Well here's a quote
A bitch nigga's a bitch nigga, right now or ten years ago
Karma don't inspire him, pride, or popular opinion
I'm rising above the minions, my eyes have (?) vision
I look away from your negative trenches
Niggas smile in real life, but act petty in mentions
This is Dread Scott, nappy dreadlocks, skulduggery
Bipedal mechanics and fire discovery
This is nineteen thirty-four, Detroit, (?) Fard
This is slave owners teaching slaves the master is God
This is Malcolm bowing to Mecca, drinking from Zamzam
Machiavellian hellions hailing our own plan
The neighbourhood does not condone, false prophets roam
Mr Rogers to Roger Stone
Watching drones fly over religious schools (?)
Back home we all clones, we follow what they presume
We cater what they consume, in costume
Get some money and hop out your cocoon, like a coon
I assume you got the memo: assemble to be effective
Young niggas disconnect, old niggas feel disrespected
This effects the nervous system, essentially kills us all
Pushin' poetic poison, fictitious Fentanyl
Hears a bunch of y'all rappin', frontin' like y'all cappin'
Throwing money around and stuntin' like y'all (?)
Said he was set to kill, really just false actin'
You call it a record deal, I call it Uncle Tom's cabin
Braggin' and fucking thots, gassed cause you bought
Five hundred thousand views and half of 'em Russian bots
Half of the buzz you got? Stolen from his connections
The other half? Controlling people's perception
Deception is like infection, it's lyin' beneath the skin
I'm tryin' to keep a grin, the virus is steeped in sin
Set aflame to the game and murder you post fire
I hate that nigga, but I admire his ghost writer
I'm the sole-proprietor, pryin' my way in the system
Criticise my game plan but ask later for assistance
Persistent but you did judge
If you don't fuck with me don't fuck with me, but I'm sick of pretend love
I'm sick of the fake industry puppets dangling strings, dangling dreams
Dangerous themes y'all promotin', I wouldn't give you the heimlich if y'all were chokin'
I'm the chosen designated distributor and dismemberer
You said you rep the culture but we don't believe you
You said you was a broker so we don't impede you
Some niggas are so desperate for exposure
They just roll-over and lower the standard we should heed to
We worship at the feet of these icons, in the hopes to be anointed
When you meet 'em in person you're disappointed
Appoint not the floors in the pecking order, respect's in order
Expect a quarter of success when they suppress what's brought up
I saw (?), what we seek is the peak
While niggas from 2010 we now see as elite
A mirage, I know it sounds quite odd
But Lil' Xan makes Gucci Man sound like Nas
Lean with it, rock with it, I just spit it how Pac did it
The Bay is in my blood, but I'm not a Blood so stop with it
I'm a lyricist, this is not a gimmick
I remember nights, empty stomach with nothin' but knots in it
Please don't compare me to other rappers you rock with
Yeah he's got a flow, but he's sorta iffy with content
Me? There's no ifs whys or maybes
I would teach a class, smash your bitch, and then baptise your baby
Maybe you deserve to be weeded out
And please don't blame it on the trees to claim later you was weeded out
I'm weavin' in and out the flow like a seamstress
You reap what you sow and I thread a needle, distinguished
Extinguish out the spark that you've been burnin' for clout
Dispersin' your spout, and every word you slur from your mout'
As far as bars I've been servin' 'em out
I deserve an amount of respect, fuck you and your burner account
You see the people in your circle are the first ones to hurt you
The feed your insecurities and downplay your virtues
But I'm virtually unstoppable, stompin' over your obstacles
Your optical receptors are intercepted with lots to prove
I'm the truth, I'm the fact of religion
I'm the reason niggas crumble up they raps when they listen
I'm the reason niggas humble up they act when he's mentioned
When they meet me in person they purposely practice submission
