[Intro]
"You may want to think twice before you laugh at somebody… 'cause they might just follow you home and kill you."

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I got these rappers scatterin' like shatterin'
Your nose bones and splatterin'
Blood in front of a hypochondriac with rare African forms
Of an airborne pathogen passin' through a sneeze
While I'm smashin' through MCs to bring the masses to their knees
I passed all my degrees and handcrafted a masterpiece
Now I'm after that mac-n-cheese to make money like Maccabees
Imagine all these maggots like magnets attractin' G's
Swear that swag is homemade when they studyin' Apathy's
They pacin' back and forth on the stage like they half deceased
Or they speakin' in Japanese or they stuck on a bag of trees
Or they fuck up lyrics and freeze… suckers are so predictable
I miss when it was dope to be original
I'm so heartbroken I part the ocean like Moses to escape
But they threw up the bat signal so I'm goin' to get my cape
I'm gettin' my old tapes and all them heavy ass crates
Scrutinizin' all my mistakes, I'll do whatever it takes

[Chorus]
Rise and shine, write a rhyme
And think about all of them rappers that I wanna kill
Rise and shine, write a rhyme
Another day, another night, another dollar bill
Rise and shine, write a rhyme
And think about all of them rappers that I wanna kill
Rise and shine, write a rhyme
Another day, another night

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
I sit and stare at the disproportionate portrait of portions that rappers speak upon
That sneak up on Ponzis that prompt me to palm, my speakers drawn
Fond of lyricism, subject matter with substance gathered close
I tend to douse 'em with both
Instead of facetious songs that bottom feed methodically
Like Constantine tricked us by mixin' Paganism with modern Christian theology
God to me is probably somethin' you never seen, let it ring
My lyrics come to life like that rabbit crafted from Velveteen
My self-esteem was punctured, lungs drippin' in acetone
My Ex told me, "Stop feelin' sorry, get off your ass, you're grown"
These other rappers suck dick, in fact it's known
Cheeks inflated like them jazz musicians blowin' the saxophone
That cast a stone? You plastic clones adapt poems
Like diggin' for fossil fuels extracted out of Jurassic bones
You excavated a style that I encoded
Spittin' rhymes back to me like I wasn't the one who wrote it, motherfucker

[Chorus]
Rise and shine, write a rhyme
And think about all of them rappers that I wanna kill
Rise and shine, write a rhyme
Another day, another night, another dollar bill
Rise and shine, write a rhyme
And think about all of them rappers that I wanna kill
Rise and shine, write a rhyme
Another day, another night, another dollar bill
