[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to feel? If you can tell it than let it be known
I'm trying to cope with my emotions and sever what's gone
I think back to when Jeremy Jack died, and I looked in his mother's eyes
And I could still hear Beverly moan
That was the first time seein' my father cryin'
Lightning struck twice on the night that they murdered Brian
My only blessin' was followin' Mama's lessons
And I can hear her screamin' down 'Baby, you better be strong!'
Good advice bubble
But it's only so long that I can go on, before I do find trouble
Or trouble finds me, feel like I'm dreamin'
I gotta deal with these Demons, tell 'em 'Devil you better be gone!'
And find another home. Am I neglecting my family?
I contemplate on whether I did my brother wrong
Or did my sisters bad, because we had different Dads
In this fucked up world, tryin' to weather the storm

[Hook]
So tell me whatchu waitin' on
Whatchu lookin' for, whatchu plan to take along
I can only deal with so much pain
I fucked around and got stuck in the rain
Will I make it home?

So tell me whatchu waitin' on
Whatchu lookin' for, whatchu plan to take along
I can only deal with so much pain
I fucked around and got stuck in the rain

[Verse 2]
I never smoked weed or drank alcohol, to stress I'm a factor
Does that discredit my talent, make me less of a rapper?
I'm less appealin' unless I'm peelin' some rollin' paper
Or would it show I had swag, would it motivate ya?
To want to buy an album, I'm feelin' this lies bitter
Cause when you get some money, you tryin' to get high, swisher
When shit change, then people chase after fame
And haters think I'm to blame, but I feel a different vibe nigga
I'm not immune to the sinnin and seein' shrugs
But I gotta stop fallin' for women I meet in clubs
And I know I'm in no moral position to be a judge
But I never thought expressin' my feelings could be a drug
I can't, keep goin' on like I'm goin' on
Cryin', complainin' none of these women I've moved forward on
And it's so annoyin', I'm tryin' to get back with my last girl
I'm stuck in this mad world

[Hook]
So tell me whatchu waitin' on
Whatchu lookin' for, whatchu plan to take along
I can only deal with so much pain
I fucked around and got stuck in the rain
Will I make it home?

So tell me whatchu waitin' on
Whatchu lookin' for, whatchu plan to take along
I can only deal with so much pain
I fucked around and got stuck in the rain

[Verse 3]
Okay, lately I've been feelin' like I'm wasting my time
Like there's, nothing here to occupy the space in my mind
Except the empty void, nothing can feel, nothing fulfills
What's lackin' except rappin', see, nothing is real
I said some things about a rapper I spit in a harsh rhyme
Not to say I take it back, can't cover a crossed line
But when he lost his mother, I thought it was all fine
Couldn't understand his pain until after I lost mine
How, ironic a situation can become
And why is it I've never met a woman I can reach some
Sort of understandin', the more demandin' they get
The more I push 'em away, the more they think I'm a dick
Lord
Is it me? Will I ever see the lights?
Ski told me a pretty woman equals misery for life
Now I'm thinkin' he was right
Addicted to bad girls, until I give 'em up
I'm stuck in this, Mad World

[Hook]
So tell me whatchu waitin' on
Whatchu lookin' for, whatchu plan to take along
I can only deal with so much pain
I fucked around and got stuck in the rain
Will I make it home?

So tell me whatchu waitin' on
Whatchu lookin' for, whatchu plan to take along
I can only deal with so much pain
I fucked around and got stuck in the rain
