[Intro]:
Yeah, Kay slay, Locksmith, listen, look

[Verse 1]:
Uninspired, unrequired to make a statement
Unimpressive, someone invested and paid for placement
Either you're braggin’ or you're crooning me
The so-called progressive media, promotes the most buffoonery
And tries to pass it as an exposè
And expose what they say is a social threat go play
Sway a politician you fishin I laugh from
The same folks who voted for him, they elected the last one
If you sad once you get the results then so briefly
Disbelief runs deep in the very soil beneath me
Got approached by a dude as I entered the Mo-Show
He asked me if I still rap my reaction was "Nigga, no"
If you know then you know, if you dont then why reveal 'em
30 minutes later I’m on stage engaging the building
I'm building a repertoire, so massive I set the bar
For myself high enough to get high off the very thought see
Niggas with no talent try to reverse they debt
By doing a reverse to be first or research the best
It's less about the music more of a deep thirst for checks
Turn around they sell you overpriced t-shirts and sweats
Fuck your merch! I'm knockin' you niggas off of your perch
Persecuted for being me and I'm starting a new church
A new search for something greater than they doctrine
No substance so they speed up they verses like an auction
"Here we go, Here we go" Dead that shit, Illegible
What's the difference between that and so called Mumble-Rap
Hip-Hop is Hip-Hop stop the pinlashes
Southern rap can be traced back to west-african syntaxes
Bent-backwards tryin to segregate the artform 'diversity’
Some niggas steady street some trapped in the university
Mercy me, no reversin’ the line between both
What you call blasphemy I call necessary growth
Look, every week I get a call text or email
By somebody tryin' to sign me off my retail
History [?] fits the need of a labels void
Then they try to avoid any question dealin’ with detail
If he sells hisself short for a lesser share
Then he's less prepared when his ship's sinkin' and things fail
Bring hell up the heaven’s feet
Then watch the biased seek refuge in a huge hole where the sea dwells
The heap hails the comparison so embarrasin'
Either they want a thug or a safer artist to pair with him
But fuck your label, judge a person by his merit and
Watch the metric raise to a higher space where we share a win
You sharin' pens you scared to stare at the glare within
Every tear at him is a deep rooted generic hymn
That's where the problem lays
Social media rappers drop songs that coincide with every holiday
Like Christmas-Day, MLK, Halloween, the Inauguration
I'm sick of the saturation please show me imagination
An inkling of maturation
None of these rap niggas can even match what I'm facing
I'm facing a new facade with every face that I encounter
Counter-productive comments can never steer me down a
Rabbit-hole I hold myself to a standard
No other person can reach my only purpose is eat
It's like we've come so far to go right back
What happened to assimilation there is no white black
One day you cuffin' your jeans banana republic
The next day they laughin' at you throwin' bananas in public
Fuck it, I'm [?] the feelin' you get when you passed on
People pretend they wanna be friends but really just wanna be latched on
Like a cub to a mothers tit, nothing speaks louder than a person's actions you can't retract him
There's more than one way to spot a narcissist
What more can one say, to stay apart from this
They say it's just days before the darkness hits
But I guarantee none of our past leaders had marched for this
It's like hate is the only currency
Planted in the soil that sprouted out from the current seed
The current pleads with fear and intimidation
Sold back to the public in fear of a timid nation
Smear it in the face of the people you claim is ignorant
No place to judge when you came from the same sentiment
A regime-change is imminent
You're not of pure and native descent, then guess what you're an immigrant
Like we all are, nothin left but the bra fall, victim to a grudge when we all came from afar y'all
Since the divisiveness how they split us and fight with us
Pit us against each other and smother Indian sightfullness
It's rules to the game
It's rules to the game provided within
Never take nothing personal, and ride for your friends
Never sign to a rapper 'less you vibe with his pen
Nine outta ten, they never let you shine brighter than him
Then, develop your own spark try to empower your own art
They flooded me with offers, I started buildin' my own arc
You never find your ass set, 'till you become an asset
I read the script then I wrote in my own part
And I don't partake with these people and they opinions online
My focus is me and improving my grind
I'm using my time that I have on earth to unearth
Any potential falsehoods exposin you false hoods
You a farce a pathetic sum of all of your parts
That's partially due in part to you refusing your heart
You can start to analyze what they randomly speak
Or just look inside and find what you actually seek
Olive Branch

[Between Beat Switches]:
Gimme another beat
Gimme  Mobb Deep, Gimme that Mobb Deep
That quiet storm
That shit I, I see some niggas freestyling on that
Yeah, Locksmith, Olive Branch, Kay Slay
It's the real
Yeah
Listen, let me tell niggas like this

[Verse 2]:
I can say more just by sayin' less
I command a floor so they stay abreast
Niggas rap for 40 minutes straight and say nothin'
Then they turn to look at me 'cause I ain't impressed
See it's quality over quantity
I possess both so these other rappers should honor me
I don't just boast, my main focus is honesty
The game is on lock, ironically
How do you play the game when the game is unfair, some bear
I would rather separate than have to eat the crumbs there
I would rather be myself doing something that I love
Than get paid to get swept under the rug
I don't give a fuck about your analytics, you full of gimmicks
Real shit grows over time, and that's a given
Slowly cultivate what I know is a fan base
That is based on the truth and not a man made image
As a man think it so shall it be
I do not believe in your fallacy
I will not concede or impede
I just focus on me and take heed of your childish deeds
Don't breath is the concensus
I know they wanna stride to desynthesize my senses
I don't take offense to the fence you place in front
But do the same when I choose to be blunt
They say opinions are like assholes - I disagree a little
Half are one side the other half is like the bittle
The other half they only workin' to shine
The other half only apply when they see a co-sign
But me, I care less about either I'm not eager
Steadily count checks and continue to live meager
Mitigate the monetary sums I gross
And reinvest in my dreams not material things
You think it's all lights and cameras
Til' you decide to stand with us
Witness firsthand the circumstances they handed us
Band with us if you sick of the banter it's time to banish
Any and all negative draw within my canvas
So I'm canvassing both coastlines most boast rhymes
Claim they stackin' up O's but those folks lyin'
Those tryin' to deny my acts I can only strike back with facts
I run my own tours and own my own label
Open my own doors and sit at my own table
Half black and middle-eastern, full beastin' when I'm starvin'
So I prolly won't be a little media, darling
And I prolly won't eat the little crumbs that you bargain
And I prolly disagree with your meaningless jargon
You fake ass journalists, get your shit straight
Your whole twitter-feed is a centipede of click bait
Underestimated that state of me what they say to me's
Nothin' more than a glorification of plagiary
If I pay you a visit you better pivot
Niggas say they want my spot but couldn't walk a day with me
Who you know can do a show in the underground and mainstream
Rock both crowds without sacrificin' the main theme
My main stream of revenue is my honesty
So I could care less what you execs offer me
Off with his headphones, spittin' till the lead gone
I know your girl well, her nickname is headstrong
Heads or Tails either way, I prevail
Let em keep countin' sheep I continue to count mail
The best rapper in the bay for like ten years
The best rapper in Cali' for like five
There's really no comparing me to my peers
As an artist I am one of a kind
You can study my rhymes, you can study my grind
You can research my work, see I'm humbly at times
But when I do feel the need to stampede my position
That's when jealous people take opposition
They can make a claim, it's cool, no hate
I do the same and feel the flame, 'cause it holds more weight
But I could care less about a title
When I'm more focused on opening doors for the idle
It's vital that I express my feelings when I choose
You tell a nigga your dreams he tell you some bad news
I guess that's why I keep it to myself
And I never show the cards that I'm dealt
