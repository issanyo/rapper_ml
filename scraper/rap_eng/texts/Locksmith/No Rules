[Intro: Fred the Godson (Womans Voice)]
(Heatmakerz, trap music)
Locksmith what up!
It's GOD!

[Verse 1: Fred the Godson]
It's that clutch flow, they need to roll
I'm going for the gusto, something you ain't see before
They studying my verses, they saying I'm stunting on purpose
I'm dope to the underground, hoping that something will surface
It's lit doe, see I get those fam
I'm connected, be it I flip those grams
Respect my G, or I'll hit your man
My checks get cheese, WIC Program
I'm still lead with the block hit
I rounded, got soul keys, now I'm flowing with Locksmith
Pray to Bronx and I come from the X
I bring those arms and I come with the Tec
I spray the Thompson, I shoot to your chest
They Klay Thompson on they computer, nothing but net
I am the realest, I spit a disease, you just syphilis

[Pre-Hook: Mally Stakz]
What you know about the young homies on the back block?
Can't make a dollar cause the whole [?] hot
What you know about having to watch your back from
Those same niggas you came up with in the sandbox?

[Hook: Mally Stakz]
Ain't no rules in the jungle
Ain't no rules in the jungle
Said ain't no rules in the jungle
Ain't no rules in the jungle
Ain't no rules in the jungle
There ain't no rules in the jungle

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
Okay
Richmond, California, Crescent Park, ain't no bitch in me
Niggas stumble on success, but I do it consistently
I knock a bitch until her fella step, yelling threats
I come to work in a hoodie like I'm Belichick
I'm from a place where every other waste is handgun
You from a place where niggas wear man buns
I see it clearly where I stand from, I'm in the city where you can't come
This is for the slums that I strive within every squad try to to box with him
Young shooter like Steph, and these niggas is Oscar Robertson
Every record I set the record let's set the record
My second effort is effortless, I expected better
I weathered the storm then I stormed out on my own two
I won't do what niggas are prone to, the shit that I've grown through
Uh, I mean it might of scarred me mentally
Niggas can't stop what they was meant to be
Richmond nigga, AH

[Hook: Mally Stakz]
Ain't no rules in the jungle
Ain't no rules in the jungle
Said ain't no rules in the jungle
Ain't no rules in the jungle
Ain't no rules in the jungle
There ain't no rules in the jungle

[Outro: (Deep voice)]
Ain't no rules in the jungle
Said ain't no rules in the jungle
Ain't no rules in the jungle
Ain't no rules in the jungle
There ain't no rules in the jungle
