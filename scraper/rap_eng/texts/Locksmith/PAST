[Intro]
Shit's crazy man
How come, how come it's always the niggas that's unsuccessful, want to tell you what to do or give you advice or some shit
(L's on the beat)

[Verse 1]
Picture me rapping for pennies
Picture me locking myself in my room
As far as raps I had many, but something was holding me back I assumed
That you would understand me, but my voice got lost in the fumes
I had to reassert and reassure myself I'd eventually bloom
Never doubt another man's drive
Never second guess when you forced to survive
Never underestimate  or test the rate another person can ascend when they rise
What's your demise? Why would you blatantly comment with latency, doubting me time after time
Why would I listen to rhetoric, someone so hesitant, scared to take charge of their life
Fucking with my homies in the east, had to work hard, had to get up in the streets
Had to take initiative and nix the shit that I once thought was my only way to eat
Only way to speak is to speak with purpose
Heard your opinion, your shit is worthless
Why would I listen when niggas is losing?
I tell them thanks and just keep it moving

[Hook]
How would I listen? Them niggas is losing
I heard what you said, I just keep it moving
How would I listen? Them niggas is snoozing
Bitch! I just keep it moving

[Verse 2]
I never try to impress
I go to sleep every night, I feel blessed
I got a bitch every city I rest
I could be bragging, but still I digress
I know these niggas is watching my steps
I know they study and follow my game
You keep comparing your struggle to mine
I'm sorry my nigga we are not the same
Y'all want the fame
I want the money and wealth
I want to keep to myself
I want the freedom to be who I am
And not have to copy or be someone else
I want to speak to my niggas with honesty
Honestly I don't see how you can help
Fuck all the frivolous shit that they promise me
I'mma keep playing the cards that I'm dealt

[Hook]
How would I listen? Them niggas is losing
I heard what you said, I just keep it moving
How would I listen? Them niggas is snoozing
Bitch! I just keep it moving

[Outro]
*Laughing*
Man, these niggas man
This shit just, man, we just, man, this shit is nothing man
J-just wait 'till y'all get the album man
Olive Branch, man
We gonna have fun for now
