[Verse 1:]
I've been dealing with this my whole life
Other peoples opinions I used to hold tight
I had to ask myself Would you rather be broke and have friends or Get money with those you don't like
Quick decision when niggas think you ain't meant to rise
Cause jealousy is just insecurity in disguise
The stench of pride is what's holding you niggas back
So I don't feature on track unless you paying or I sense a vibe
They been sleeping on what I say hard
Now they finally acknowledged I'm passing their bar
These industry niggas is like bitch they see me with another broad now I'm suddenly on their radar
Waved off what I may loss when it breaks one way to be great
But I had to separate my fate to display who was fake
I can say it with faith
Never trust a person so stubborn they won't admit when they make a mistake
Fuck your validation I don't embrace your admiration
I don't reply to niggas cries I don't care or have the patience
I just say what's on my mind
You can take it how you take it
You can drape yourself in lies
I would rather stand here naked
I don't regret the path I'm taking
I demand what I'm endowed
I admit that my mistakes got out of hand cause I was proud
My family said it was blatant I was stranded in clouds
But it's hard to see the stage till you standing in the crowd
Never the type to feed excuses Never take light
What seems as useless
Try to rewrite the themes of music that is a plight
That seems elusive
I don't expect for you to catch what I've been doing that's the caption
I don't talk about success I just prove it in my actions
I just use it as my traction and it's more fuel for my passion
They keep asking what would happen once I see loss?
Of course I'm still hungry there's nothing for me to feed off

[Verse 2:]
My nigga Tone said some things that I'll never forget
Never let money stress you out and don't ever regret
Choices you've made when these doubters try to negate you
Just keep making music that real people relate to
And that was our conversation in front of Dream
But when does my occupation become a dream
Said everything you work for is worth more than you can gage
You gotta see these things through don't ever skip a stage
Ripped the stage at South By, then told the south bye
As I rushed to airport hope they remember me
On this flight  with bigger rappers felt embarrassed I was careless
With my talent and drowned in my insecurities
Pulled my hood down shut my eyes closed pretend I'm sleep
But I can still hear them laughing from over my seat
Probably random not intended as such but I used it as my motivation instead of being my crutch
I was so blind for so long in my mind did no wrong
I prolonged what should have been the first path I rode on
But hold on life can only give you what you take to long to live
Even my mother said I pray that you don't make it big (what?) Thought she said it as disrespect to me
But now I understand that she was just protecting me
Expect to see some speed-bumps when you fast forward
Just be careful what you ask for
