[Verse 1]
I was that skinny nigga curly hair
Apple of my father’s eye
Although I was small in size
Dreaming on to falling skies
Polluted pictured depicting victims that all applies
In deny they would often try
To compensate for all them lies
And I would stay inside playing hide with my nieces
Reese’s little brother discovered his own feces
Recently got a foot inside of what might’ve took
More than it normally would but I found myself in God off the hook
And this is not a fucking album
This is a byproduct of slided projects and 5 years of niggas doubt me
This is my opening opus to ofan the all
To the hopeless that someone vote
Couldn’t cope but it’s just a souless
And I’m something on this journey while I’m on it
Tryin to see things clear but that mirror was my oponent
Potent words piss a nigga hard, watch it as it flutters
Tryin to wash clean inside the gutter

[Hook x2]
Fuck y’all niggas thought this was
This ain’t what they thought this was
More than just that paper see that paper ain’t gon stop it cuz
Money gon mean everything
Me , I just want everything
This is for my riders if they feel it, let me know

[Verse 2]
And they say, Lock you gotta make some party shit
Rap about money and hoes and all that garbage and shit
You goin over niggas heads they’ll never get it
Well excuse me for giving my people too much credit
Credit me for my own mistakes no escape from the short comings
People pass judgements like a court summets
Something’s gotta give as it swails
And they say that money don’t mean everything
But it sure helps fuck up yourself and just be grateful love
Everything that you said you love
Everything that I went through I was meant to and I say it cuz
Life can be misleading it can even make you sway your budge
What do you think the reason why them niggas front and stay in clubs
And it’s no use from running from yourself player
All the jewerly and hoes that ain’t gonna help player
Say what you want as your heart flutters
But careful tryin to climb out of that gutter

[Hook x2]
Fuck y’all niggas thought this was
This ain’t what they thought this was
More than just that paper see that paper ain’t gon stop it cuz
Money gon mean everything
Me , I just want everything
This is for my riders if they feel it, let me know

[Outro]
Let me know
Let me know
