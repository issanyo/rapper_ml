[Hook]
And I might be here, but it’s really not me
It’s something going on and nobody don’t see
All these niggas going on, wishing all upon me
I’ve been dreaming all along, I just wanna be free, yeah!
I’ve been dreaming all along, I just wanna be free, yeah!
I’ve been dreaming all along, I just wanna be!

[Verse 1]
And they call her, little light skin, pretty figure nice bling
Raised by her mother, ridiculed by her white friends
Attached ploids to get a night in
Fucking for acceptance, shadow view through her life’s lens
Repelling for attention, cloudier the outer shell
Had to sour smell of religion
Shrouded tail of sedition auction enough for attributes
Cut her hair shorter, distorted glimpse, what that would do?
And her family had a back view
Neglected expected to follow soon, till she packed and moved
Passive aggressive attitude, singer slash actress
So attractive, you have to drool
And if that confuses see her in the setting
Top floor and the private party, spinning liquor on the bed
Letting her thought go, telling me a self story
Like what these people do if I flew from the twelfth store?

[Hook]
And I might be here, but it’s really not me
It’s something going on and nobody don’t see
All these niggas going on, wishing all upon me
I’ve been dreaming all along, I just wanna be free, yeah!
I’ve been dreaming all along, I just wanna be free, yeah!
I’ve been dreaming all along, I just wanna be!

[Verse 2]
And told her that life is what you’re making
Be careful for you taking
She said pretty looks became her security blanket
The game could be a trip, sometimes can stumble and trip
These other bitches you trip, you’re busting tables that this bank wits
And you’re on that big bank tower bank shit
People aiming to shoot when it’s probably easy to bank it
Pain sits in the face, it’s plain anguish
Try to talk about a job, but to hurt, that’s a foreign language
Penny for her thoughts, quarters if you’re out of range
Feeling out of touch, but you’re out of luck if you’re out of change
Kinda of strange the conversation we had
She said it all sparked from a conversation with dad
And I might be here, but it’s really not me
He said you be holding in all these feelings I see
And you’re struggling with your past, pretending you couldn’t grasp
Emotional conflicts, constrict what we had!
And I know I’m not perfect, I just wanna stay friends
And every man you had since then, you blame them
And can’t change men, she’s telling herself stories
Sucking this pack room, the view from the twelfth store
