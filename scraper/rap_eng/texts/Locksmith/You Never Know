(Intro)
That could be you
That could be me
That could be him
That could be her
That could be us
That could be us
That could be him
That could be me
That could be you
That could be them
That could be us
That could be us

(Verse)
If it can be me then it can be you
It could be false, or it could be true
It could be love , or it could be hate
It could be chance or it could be fate
It could be weak or It could be strong
It could be words or it could be songs
It could be joy or it could be grief
It could be right in your face or burried deep underneath
It could be so devilsh It could be spiritual
It could be metaphors, it could be literal
It could be.. too hard to even comprehend
It could be ready to finish or about to begin
It could put you in a trance and retrack your life
It could be male or female black and white
It can be gay or straight either now or late
It could be stiff as a board or a formless lake
It could be a bitch nigga or your closest friend
That could be one and the same, yeah niggas pretend
It could be life or death any erase the thought of us
How could I ever judge shit, it could be all of us

(Hook)
High life, low life it all could change tomorrow
Never black and white I wish I could see it all
But You never know.. you never know.. you never know, you never know
You never know.. you never know.. you never know, you never know

(Verse)
Dance with a demon , he don't change he change you
Now you naked in plain view
Reaching for a leaf to cover your transgression
Who are you to gage another man's depression
Who are you to gage another man's expression
Veer from fear, steer from the planned lesson
An outcast , casted out fam stressin
Polite man left you while you stand guessin
Then I found a gun by my mothers bed
She said it came from my brother in law
I got another cousin did time up in the feds
We need to find some brothers in law
I recovered it all, I kept my nose to the pavement
And he said I got 2 white girls that take the payments
He just got out it's good to be free
How can I judge him, shit it could be me

(Hook)
High life, low life it all could change tomorrow
Never black and white I wish I could see it all
But You never know.. you never know.. you never know, you never know
You never know.. you never know.. you never know, you never know
