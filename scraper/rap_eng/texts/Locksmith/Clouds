[Verse 1]
Head in the clouds
I don't need handshakes and I don't need smiles
I don't need nobody's hand in my pocket
To siphon my profits or eat off my vowels
I been on tour for like 52 dates
I knocked a new one in 20 new states
I been uneasy on how they receive me
The crescents conceived me you cannot escape
You ain't gotta listen but it's still fact
Most of these niggas be steady trickin' but I still stack
I know the difference between a sucker and a real Mac
I am from Richmond, when I was young they instilled that
I hear the shit that you niggas drop and I calmly (What?)
Disregard any credit so you could never con me (What?)
Now you got the nerve and the gall to ask me what I been feelin'
My opinion is "Nigga, that's beyond me!"
I gotta different kind of agenda than entertainin' pretenders
Came in the game with splinters it was costly (Cost)
I can remember when you had tried to dismember my credibility
Silly rapper don't ever try to cross me! (Yeah)
God bless you, I request you to keep a large gap
Between me and the raps that you peddlin' (What?)
Now you wanna come and play damage control
Manage your soul, I be right here after the dust settles in, settlin'
How do I take the negative, narrow it to a narrative
Narrowly reachin' my goals, you froze when the air was thin (Hey)
Would you rather follow a dream or a meme
I rather follow my heart a stark line of comparison (Woo)
Comparin' me to the next man is shiftless
If you don't see it now don't ask later forgiveness (Nah)
I don't do friendship, I do business
Either you bear arms or bear witness
Listen

[Chorus]
You fuckin' wit' a true one (True one)
I can see the snakes when they do come (Do come)
I can see the stakes when they do run (Do run)
But you don't see the place that I grew from (Grew from)
It's Richmond on mine
You felt a way but act different online
You take my kindness for weakness so fuckin' egregious you don't deserve none

[Verse 2]
I, I, I, I been in front of the fronters and front runners who front numbers
Who run from us incumbent to come at you come summer (Ah)
Some of you sonned under my under side are uninspired
I come alive, you come at I with a sunken vibe
I summarize your sum of lies
And every son of a bitch bitchin' my sudden rise, suckin' life (Suck!)
My undivided is unrequited
I become quiet as soon as you niggas sigh or you sub a lie
Don't expect me to write off with a light scoff
The nights off you took predictin' what I thought (Yeah)
So I bought into the bullshit that you sail with
Now I'm much wiser a umpire your sales pitch (Argh)
You frail bitch you're paperthin and unholy
I tell you what the universe had once told me
You can say what you like with no concern
But every action comes back in return
I'm turnin' my back now, I never will back down
I bat down whenever you lash out
I rather would hash out, 'stead of the fast route
I cast out any distraction
Niggas use social platforms for egotistical traction
I cashed in on my own terms then ran back
Self determination determines where I would land that
I ransacked the industry fuck your empathy (Fuck!)
Instantly niggas tried to retract from where they stand at
You can't rap but your vibe is pushin'
The immature recognized to provide a cushion
The more mature look aside at the times we shouldn't
America eats its' young we subscribe and push it
We supply the dinnerware we been aware
If we don't feel instantly entertained, we look away for bigger fare
Pick a pair of hot artists I kill 'em both
And watch 'em fall prey to my lyricism and growth (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
You fuckin' wit' a true one (True one)
I can see the snakes when they do come (Do come)
I can see the stakes when they do run (Do run)
But you don't see the place that I grew from (Grew from)
Yeah, it's Richmond on mine
You felt a way but act different online
You take my kindness for weakness so fuckin' egregious you don't deserve none
