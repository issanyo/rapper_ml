[Intro]
They say as long as you don’t ask for more than your share
The world will never give you more than you can bare
Bare with me

[Verse 1]
The butt of every joke whenever folks would play foul
Life is a bitter tool of ridicule that they plow
Enough to make the even great bow
How else can you explain the same how
When happen to Junior say how
Conversations with my pops
Crying as hes packing my mother’s clothes in a box
Is hard to watch, just seeing what type of state hes in
And then it dawned on me, like what if he wants to date again
And if it does can I accept it
If it he chooses to, would my mother be disrespected
Nobody knows what it’s like to become a widower
To lose the one you love and move on, does that belittle her
Try to reconsider what litters a person’s soul
For years I had a problem with reaching for certain goals
What did Satan say to Eve just God and the Serpent knows
From the day I hit the stage and till the final curtain close

[2 x Hook:]

[Verse 2]
I used to wanna be rich and wife a chick thats gorgeous
Now I just wanna help my father pay as mortgage
Now I just wanna see my brother finish school
And make sure my nieces and nephews are there to see him through
I’m seeing through, what you perceive is true
Plus you thought me growing up was more important than being cool
But you would tease him too, being cruel was a topic
They told me I wasn’t black and said I was adopted
Adopted a scholars swag, protected me from what they had
Instore but it hit my core, confided within my dad
I compensated to compensate for my melonin
I lack there of scared of, the inner hell in him
But what’s propelling him to making nigga eyes weld
I never thought I’d see the day my father needed my help
Guess we all gotta grow, until the day I touch the grave and that final curtain close

[2 x Hook:]
I’m feeling like getting high to forget about life
Nigga need something just to feel alright
Alright, alright
Let me float away, just another day
We’re looking to wipe the shame
Is something to numb the pain

[Outro]
SO please don’t get this shit misconstrude, or be subdude
Let the motherf*cking record show
The question ain’t why we get high
But whys a nigga low
