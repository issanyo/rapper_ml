[Verse 1]
Fresh out of the runway
Just flew into Houston
Me and my cousin here till Sunday
Why you leavin' Sunday?
He say 'Loc, lemme explain'
Everybody come here for the strippers
Don't nobody watch the game
So we stand outside for thirty minutes
Waiting on our ride
You know flaky ass promoters
Never do pick you up on time
I just wanna get up in the room, maybe loom
Maybe kick back, watch a couple cartoons
Maybe order food, maybe take a nap, maybe lap on the premises
I was in the middle of a Genesis
Rebirth when I see skirts
I don't wanna beat a nigga to another ass
I just wanna feeling that we know i can smash
But it's kinda difficult when woman let it pass
I know, i go to the venue
Then to the middle where they puttin' up the stage
A couple white nigga on the build I ain't faze
I don't give a fuck, but I betta get payed
So we hop in a rental when we ride on the block
Lookin' for another situation that could pop
Lookin' for another lil' somethin' we could knock
And a couple bad bitches, and my nigga wanna stop
So we stop
We walk with the tele, the lobby is packing, it's us niggas
It's filled with bitches and strippers and ballers and drug dealers
And she on my line like wassup
Whacha? Said I got a girl, 'I don't give a fuck' nigga
Damn, I wanna leave, damn, I wanna stay
Damn, I wanna be the nigga that went astray
I don't wanna seem rude, I don't wanna kill the mood
But you talkin' Ice-Cube, no Oshe
Oh, wait, oh, wait, how the fuck did I get in the scene?
The way that she starrin' is burnin' my jeans
My nigga like 'just take this one for the team! '
So I proceed with the proceeding while proceeding in with haste
She said 'follow me to the bathroom, I think we gon' need some space'
I said 'damn, you are assertive, you deserve to keep your chase'
She say 'nigga, why you blockin? '
Then I heard somebody knockin'

[Hook]
Fuckin' idols, we be fuckin' idols
She be fuckin' idols, man, all these fuckin' idols
Fuckin' idols, we be fuckin' idols
She be fuckin' idols, man, all these fuckin' idols

[Verse 2]
I though I was outta clutches till I found I was tryna wet this
Gonna mount that amount to a mountain
And how she steps out of her husband
How she checks out when she's fuckin'
How she's in doubt when she's sufferin'
How they just had to child, so the money in house is nothin'
But it's funny how spouse is someone that I though that I seen somewhere
But I can't put my finger on it
She say put yo finger here
I know it's misleading, dear
But I can't have that wrong on me
And I looked at that face again and finally dawned on me
'Ain't you the wife of that ball playa with tall paper? '
Who retired from playing but as a child was my wallpaper?
But he moved to the Midwest and got the house with the large acres
Cake from endorsements to makin' money in all fazes
And facing her I can see, when I speak she's bored, idle
She needs some attention, I hide like fuckin' a formal rival
Maybe a foreigner foreign to her  she's thinkin' idle
But I can't be the nigga to fuck the wife of his former idol

[Hook]
Fuckin' idols, we be fuckin' idols
She be fuckin' idols, man, all these fuckin' idols
Fuckin' idols, we be fuckin' idols
She be fuckin' idols, man, all these fuckin' idols
Fuckin' idols, she be fuckin' idols
All these fuckin' idols, fuckin' idols
