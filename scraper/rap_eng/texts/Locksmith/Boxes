[Hook: Locksmith]
I'd rather be with you, you already know
I want to see it through but I'm letting go
I know you feel it too, I'm ready
Said it was forever what you thought id forget it? Baby

[Verse 1: Locksmith]
And it's like you the only person I'm honest with, the only one I've ever kept a promise with
The only time I ever let some drama slip is when we first started you caught it, I acknowledged it
You said you wanted change I let you switch the plan. You said you hated games I left you in command
You said you needed space, I gave you space. A moth later I see you with this new nigga on instagram. Ohhh
And its funny how you held us to a standard then said it was random when I questioned you on if you planned it
And since were being candid, I'm not stressing over that. But you alive, you said him and I never overlapped
I'm not trying to close the gap and I'm not trying to hold you back. But I deserve to hear the truth, if you a friend award me that
Trying to take your story back, but it's promises that were spread, trying to find the words when there's nothing left to be said

[Hook: Rebeca Nobel and Locksmith]
Why? why? why hold? Why hold on? I know, I know, gotta let you go
I'd rather be with you, you already know
I want to see it through but I'm letting go
I know you feel it too, I'm ready
Said it was forever, what you thought I'd forget it? Baby
I know (I know), I know (I know), I Know (I know), I know (I know), I know (I know), I know (I know)
Said it was forever what, you thought I'd forget it? but

[Verse 2: Locksmith]
And I know you fell it too that's why you calling, yet every time we speak you said it was my fault for stalling
And even though we caught in this levy, that's unsteady. We agreed to take a leave cause neither of us were ever ready
And petty things inside, it hurt my pride. I admit it. I can't be with other girls and expect you to stay committed
But it didn't sink in cause right then i couldn't see this. When I heard you did it first it ripped my ego to pieces
And piece of me is peacefully moved on but I'm cautious, cause all you left me with is a living room full of boxes
And I can't even see how you can't consider this thoughtless, how you can leave me to these memories, I'm a hostage
And I use to blame myself for not stepping up when you needed me but now I see it clear you had other plans that exceeded me. Seems to me that this thing we had is broken, trying to find the words when there's none left to be spoken

Why? why? why hold? Why hold on? I know, I know, gotta let you go

I know (I know), I know (I know), I Know (I know), I know (I know), I know (I know), I know (I know)
