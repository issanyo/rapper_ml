[Intro]
I am not your robot, I am not a clone
You are not my puppeteer and I am not a drone
Got a new master and I follow him alone
I want a good life till I'm gone its on

[Verse 1]
Hey I was born less than human
I know it sound crazy
But I was really born a robot as a baby
No real life in me, I just played my role
No self control, I just did what I was told
I got my first order I was just a day old
But I didn't have a chance cause my heart was way cold
My heart took the order
I couldn't break the mold
Sold under bondage and
I couldn't take control
So I was just chilling in my Robot clothes
With my robot friends, and my robot flows
Living robot ways, cause that's all I know
Till I heard I could be freed from my Robot soul
I'm like

[Bridge]
Why you always trying to control me
You are not my boss that's the old me
Obviously you don't know my style
Cause I'm not a, I'm not a robot now

[Hook]
I'm not a, I'm not a, I'm not a robot
I'm not a, I'm not a robot now
[x2]

[Verse 2]
The crazy thing is I ain't know I was a robot
So I ain't haves whole lot of plans for me
To roll out
I thought I was unique, I thought I was so hot
But I was just like them other drones, I was so locked
Brainwashed, I was listening to lies
The freedom that I thought I had was really a mirage
I made my own choices, but it was a disguise
The only thing I really did was pick a different lie
So I was still a drone nothing but a clone
I only knew the lies causes that's all that I shown
But I been remade, my heart is no longer stone
Where my ex-Robots who can sing this song?
Now I've been remade, I'm no longer hollow
A real man came, changed everything that I know
He gave me truth, that's a hard pill to swallow
He gave me new commands, and he freed me up to follow

[Bridge]

[Intro]

[Verse 3]
Hey world, you know I see your game
And I don't need your lies, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
Hey devil, I know you want me chained
But you have been defeated and your power has been drained
Hey flesh, I know you bear my name
I know you love the lie, but I'm steady tryna change
You might been confused, but this a new day
I'm saved now, I ain't gotta do what you say!
To my friends, who are still on lock-down
Still controlled by their passions, stop now
He can free everybody from the top down
If you're freed up, say this with me right now
I'm not a, I'm not a robot now
I'm not a, I'm not a robot now
I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a robot
I'm not a, I'm not a robot now
