[Intro]
I can wait (I'll wait for, I'll wait, I'll wait for ya girl)
I can wait (Okay)
Hold up (I can wait)

[Verse 1]
I remember when when I laid eyes
On you baby in the middle of the day time
Had my feelings elevated and I can't lie
(I can wait)
I was thinking about your frame in my free time
With my boys but I'm throwing up the peace sign
When I see ya cause I wonder, can we be down?
You don't know my name
But your phone about to blow up, no propane
And my heart finna blow up, no cocaine
And I ain't even trying to roll up and run no game
But still, I'm like hold up
Can I take you out and get to know ya?
Take you on a soul roller coaster
But I know you're tryna take it slower

[Bridge]
Yeah my homies know me and they know
If anybody know me, they know
I don't get lonely, they know
You the one, you the one, I know
What you did ain't been done before
You said you wanna wait, I know
And I'm in the same place, you know
You know, baby girl
Hold up

[Hook]
Hold up, where we going now?
I know you ain't really tryna take it there
The city is closing down
And I ain't even really tryna take it there
Without even knowing how
My fire inside wanna take it there
But we gotta slow it down
You and me really tryna take it there

[Verse 2]
(I can wait)
Baby girl I'm all about that
You can ask me where I got that
Same place where you got that
(I can wait)
It's gonna be hard but we got that
You look so good but damage your heart
Man, I wish I would, I'mma guard that
Hold up
I can't lie
My heart don't feel like it's on my side
It's on enemy lines hollering 'go offsides'
This ain't friendly fire, my sin is just outside
Nobody said it would be easy
But we're not giving up this evening
'Cause you're tryna be faithful, ain't you
To yourself and the God who made you

[Bridge]
Yeah my homies know me and they know
If anybody know me, they know
I don't get lonely, they know
You the one, you the one, I know
What you did ain't been done before
You said you wanna wait, I know
And I'm in the same place, you know
You know, baby girl
Hold up

[Hook]
Hold up, where we going now?
I know you ain't really tryna take it there
The city is closing down
And I ain't even really tryna take it there
Without even knowing how
My fire inside wanna take it there
But we gotta slow it down
You and me really tryna take it there
Hold up, where we going now?
I know you ain't really tryna take it there
The city is closing down
And I ain't even really tryna take it there
Without even knowing how
My fire inside wanna take it there
But we gotta slow it down
You and me really tryna take it there

[Bridge]
I can wait
If anybody know me, they know
I don't get lonely, they know
I can wait
You said you wanna wait, I know
And I'm in the same place, you know
You know, baby girl
Hold up
