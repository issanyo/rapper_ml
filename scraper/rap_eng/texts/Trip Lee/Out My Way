[Intro]
Get em'

[Hook]
You want my hope destroyed
Hater I know your danger, I'ma show them boys
Don't owe you no favors, what you want me for?
Throw you overboard

Get out my way
Get out my way
Get out my way
My way, my way, my way
(Repeat 2x)

[Verse 1]
I got some big pockets
I could stock with big profits
I could get penthouses, back pain from big wallets
But can't get me out this big maze that’s all round us
Balling can't ground us
We all got the same problems
(I know, I know) I know I got enemies in my path
I got venom leaves growin in my trees
That villain scheming all fast
I know we can't get us free with no cash
That’s tryna hit a speed of one-hundred three
You ain't even leave with no gas
But them weights drag us
Way down to the grave casket
The case: can't crack It
Some things'll take you backwards
If what I got on me’s holding me down
I’m flying past it
Throwing weight off of me
Bro cause he calling me
I ain’t passive
Yes, you got problems
All of your joy may disguise them
Free up your mind and run by them
Trust in the One you abide in
Don't look to the side and break your stride
'Cause distraction in this race won't fly, let's ride

[Hook]
You want my hope destroyed
Hater I know your danger, I'ma show them boys
Don't owe you no favors, what you want me for?
Throw you overboard

Get out my way
Get out my way
Get out my way
My way, my way, my way
(Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2]
I'm a runaway train
On tracks
Get out my lane
One life gone
Another gained
And I can’t always pass blame
Might sound grimey
Shrinks might try to find me
Know this about me
All my problems ain't outside me
No games, I know sometimes I'm out my lane
I say adios to you lame problems all inside of my frame
(I go) I go insane
But turn around
Like Steph in the game
And if I maintain
A golden estate I'm get when I reign
But that's way later
Can't just wait like I can't labor
Think I'm crazy?
I can't blame you
If you ain't tasted that great flavor
He did me a great favor
New tastebuds and my plates greater
But when I play with fire
I burn my tongue and I can't savor
Can I be honest?
I'm not always at my finest
Grieving and gotta get guidance
He gets me back with his kindness
Don't look to the side and break your stride
Cause distraction in this race won't fly, let's ride

[Hook]
You want my hope destroyed
Hater I know your danger, I'ma show them boys
Don't owe you no favors, what you want me for?
Throw you overboard

Get out my way
Get out my way
Get out my way
My way, my way, my way
(Repeat 4x)
