[Hook: Alex Faith]
See me when I light up
Yeah I’m on a mission
Basic folk just living and accepting what they’re given
Tell ‘em look at us and you could see that it’s a difference
Haters in they ear, they talking but we never quittin’
See me when I light up, light up, light up
Won’t you put your light up, light up, light up
Tell ‘em turn the light up, light up, light up
See me when I light up, light up, light up

[Verse 1: Alex Faith]
So I swerve onto the scene and they ask me where I came from
Test me when I flex, they wanna see what I am made of
Coming from that Georgia clay, one thing I do claim bruh
But Jesus’ name is one thing that I’ll never be ashamed of
So we lift Him up, come in we be shinin’ dawg
And when I don’t pick up my phone, believe me I’m just grinding dawg
Come and see us in your city
My squad we be turned up to the maximum
Can’t find me dawg, better tell ‘em all they gone learn bruh
Light up. This music thang, we floss without a Rollie
Open book in all my songs, it’s kinda like you know me
And even if you never heard of me, you know my homies
We be making marks and raising bars, light up the game now don’t we
We push the standard higher, I know I may never break charts
So we make war and fight back in the industry we bravehearts
Make great art, now they telling me, that boy right there, he came hard
Movement for the people, you won’t tell me what I can’t start
No compromise, it’s all good. I know that they don’t like us
Hatin’, but I bet you they gone see me when I light up

[Hook]
See me when I light up

Basic folk just living and accepting what they’re given
Tell ‘em look at us and you could see that it’s a difference
Haters in they ear, they talking but we never quittin’
See me when I light up, light up, light up
Won’t you put your light up, light up, light up
Tell ‘em turn the light up, light up, light up
See me when I light up, light up, light up

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
That boy there strange ain’t he? He gone insane crazy
He claim he got what he need and he ain’t the same lately
But can you blame me bruh?
For saying this world just ain’t enough
It’s lame and it ain’t what He made me for
Can I say enough? (Let’s go)
Don’t miss that bright glow, my concert is a light show
How you know what you love?
It’s what you’re willing to fight for and I fight bro
I won’t stop. Won't quit it. I don’t just talk it, I live it
Yeah I fall down but He fix it. He’s in my sight so
I’mma light up. Tell ‘em turn my mic up
Don’t wanna be fake so tell ‘em I’mma turn my life up
Now I ain’t saying I’m perfect
Was dark and hard but not worthless
Was snatched outta that grave
And you know I’m outta that circus
Hey forget that ballin’
Real life living stalling
I roll with other soldiers ‘cause I don’t wanna be fallin’
Now when the last time that you heard
A brotha that spit and filled with the word
Rippin’ them nails, flippin’ the verbs
But he ain’t just tryna be heard
Yes sir! Now what y’all know about this Texas boy?
Missing joy ‘til He came and filled the void
Light ‘em up

[Hook]
See me when I light up

Tell ‘em look at us and you could see that it’s a difference
Haters in they ear, they talking but we never quittin’
See me when I light up, light up, light up
Won’t you put your light up, light up, light up
Tell ‘em turn the light up, light up, light up
See me when I light up, light up, light up
