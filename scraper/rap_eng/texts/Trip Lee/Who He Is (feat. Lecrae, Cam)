I know his Grace is amazing face it
Ain't another like our God
From the foundation's, placements
Nations, they've been place underneath
His rod oh my God, you're the one
Worth the praise so bump the peso
Cause u say so I keep your ways in
Front of me until my days go so they
Have the women they can keep the queso... hey ya'll
That's why we don't roll with the drama
Don't get drunk, don't roll marijuana not
Because hell's hot like the coals in
A sauna but we love god and we go where he wanna
Himself, the best gift he could
Ever give who can take a set of kids
Trippin off a sedatives give them the grace
That pays their eternal deficit now we enjoy
God and all of his preeminence

[Chorus:]
Because of who he is
If I'm worthy dying for
Yes this God's is worth
Living for because of who
He is he makes me want to
Give him more and more, so
I take my body and use it
For the glory of God
That's why I pray every day
Gotta pick up my cross search
For the lost, no matter the cost...
(X2)

He reigns over all, it's plain since
The fall, our brains don't recall
Who he is His name's over all, His
Aim is for all to remain in awe as they
See his beauty man is truly crazy, dude he's
Grand His truth is great we dudes should
Stand and truly praise the beautiful lamb
The bruised him greatly his life was the cost
He died on the cross He died for the lost, we
Know that So we ride for the boss, his high
We exalt, this Christ in our thoughts, can't
Hold back Exalt him up in our actions too we
Crack them johnny macs and cruise the facts
We grab his active truth, we happy when dad's in our view...

[Chorus]

Tell me, who you know can control the globe
Walk in his holy home, walk down a lowly road
Roll where the stones get thrown at ya dome
Cause you made it known you're the son of God
On the throne he deserves mo, this is why we flow
Not that we could ever pay him back what we owe but
If we don't flow then we might as well go and let the
Whole world know he is God all alone...

His gracious, great, He's way too good
Can't believe he made us kids no righteousness
In the place we stood, so he died and he gave
Us his... you might wonder why we live that bro
We ain't just tryna live by some principles, we
Love him can't get enough of him, so that's the God
We living for...

[Chorus]
