[Intro]
How long, O Lord?
How long will you forget me?
Forever? Forever?
How long will you look the other way?
How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul, with sorrow in my heart everyday?
How long will my enemy have the upper hand?
I don’t know

[Hook]
I threw my prayers to the ceiling
But I feel like you don't get them for so long
You ain’t been there when I’m slipping
You seem indifferent while I sit here alone
Why don't you care how I'm feeling?
I'm doubting, 'bout to be dipping 'cause you gone
Why should I wait for your healing?
You ain’t gon make me the villain in this song

[Verse 1]
Did you hear that?
Did I come through clear?
Did you hear that?
Are my prayers the kinda ones you hear?
My mama lied, when she said she you right by my side
Lord know I tried, no lie, I'm through here
I'm in a bind
You might hear people's cries, you ain't listening to mine
And really I'm fine
Cause when I was down, back in '05 and wanted a sign
You never replied, guess it just wasn't the time
But hey, I don't know your ways
But it seems lately that you been in a daze
Can't see through the haze
My homie lost his son that's crazy, and I know he prays
But I heard your son raised, after like three days
Hmm, strange
If I was the Lord, wouldn't be no pain
But you must be bored, or I must be insane
Ain't tryna say I'm wiser Lord
Just surprised that you ain't nicer Lord

[Hook]
I threw my prayers to the ceiling
But I feel like you don't get them for so long
You ain’t been there when I’m slipping
You seem indifferent while I sit here alone
Why don't you care how I'm feeling?
I'm doubting, 'bout to be dipping 'cause you gone
Why should I wait for your healing?
You ain’t gon make me the villain in this song

[Post-Hook]
And I’m just being real when I say
I don’t know if he’s just trying to dodge his promise, I don’t know
But I don’t know where else I could go
I don’t know if I can tolerate the silence, I don’t know
But I’m just being real when I say
I don’t know if he’s just trying to dodge his promise, I don’t know
But I don’t know where else I could go
I don’t know if I can tolerate the silence, I don’t know

[Verse 2]
What about all the times my people cried?
Almost lost our minds
You could've helped us God, for you that don't cost a dime
What about that time another black kid and his buddies
A grown man left him dead and bloody
But you didn't help, do you love me?
I thought when you love someone it shows
You the most high up, but don't care when I'm low, oh
Can't watch another man killed on video, oh no
It don’t feel like you with us, we so low
Why you so slow?
They say, "We are not to fear, God is love, the Messiah's near"
I say, "I got this designer gear, but I can't get my Designer's ear"
And if I'm a mere mortal guy
And the violence here makes me wanna vomit
Then how God is fine is not so clear
My eyes are dried, they spilled 'bout a thousand tears
The smell of abandonment is in my nostrils clear
I don't see it, maybe I don't get Him
He must be sleep, call me when He’s risen

[Hook]
I threw my prayers to the ceiling
But I feel like you don't get them for so long
You ain’t been there when I’m slipping
You seem indifferent while I sit here alone
Why don't you care how I'm feeling?
I'm doubting, 'bout to be dipping 'cause you gone
Why should I wait for your healing?
You ain’t gon make me the villain in this song

[Post-Hook]
And I’m just being real when I say
I don’t know if he’s just trying to dodge his promise, I don’t know
But I don’t know where else I could go
I don’t know if I can tolerate the silence, I don’t know
But I’m just being real when I say
I don’t know if he’s just trying to dodge his promise, I don’t know
But I don’t know where else I could go
I don’t know if I can tolerate the silence, I don’t know

[Outro]
Turn and answer me, O Lord, my God!
Return the sparkle to my eye, or I will die
Don’t let my enemies gloat, saying, “We have defeated him!”
Don’t let them rejoice in my downfall
But I trust in your unfailing love
I will rejoice because you have rescued me
I will sing to the Lord, because He is good to me
