Well let me tell you how it started in the Garden of Eden
With sweet Adam and Eve the first hearts beatin'
God made them in his image 'till they ate from the tree and...
Since then all men have been born as heathens
We have a sickness like people who can't beat diseases
It's called sin it deserves the eternal heat
He gave us life and we can keep it I'll tell you the reason
But first lets get back to the massacre at Eden
The very first time man was tricked by Satan
On that date and that day instantly changed our fate
It was undoubtedly man's darkest hour
But Eve didn't have a chance she didn't know his power
We probably would have failed too if the choice was ours
It's a dilemma that man alone can't get out of
'Cause our relationship with the holy God is sour
We all fall short of him like He's tall as towers
Instead staying with the one with the awesome power
We steady chasing girls like Austin Powers
We're all left out in the cold in a world thats crowded
With skeptics and doubters who want to do without Him
We got a problem, We need something to solve it now 'cause
We're separated from the father and we're lost without Him
We got a problem, We need something to solve it now 'cause
We're seperated from the father and we're lost without Him, thats...

The bad news, we were born in sin
The good news we can be born again
The bad news, we were born in sin
The good news, we can be born again
