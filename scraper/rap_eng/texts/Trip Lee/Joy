Oh, I'ma send that

Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Joy to the world, to the world, yeah
And tell all the earth of God's own Son
Joy to the world, to the world
Yessir, uh huh

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
I ain't tryna throw no shade
But its like joy's on slo-mo
Good news I can't tell where you at (Huh?)
Looking to the heavens tryna yell where you at (Where you at)
Why pain gotta chain us? (Huh?)
Will the unjust ever have to pay up?
Yeah, joy comes if we wait up (Wait)
Even came in the flesh long ago to obtain us (Yeah)
Don't send it my way (My way)
On ten, 'cause He been in my gates (My gates)
Can't live like I'm still in my grave (My grave)
Lights dim when I'm feeling blase (Okay)
Now me and my squad just gonna feast on the bliss He brought us (Yeah)
Why wait for tomorrow? (Huh?)
Joy came and He called us (Yeah)
I'ma send that

[Chorus: Abe Parker]
Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Joy to the world, to the world, yeah
And tell all the earth of God's own Son
Joy to the world, to the world
