[Intro: KB]
I really appreciate y'all coming out to pray with me, man
My heart's just been real heavy here lately, man
I got a stack of letters here and I thought we should read a couple of 'em
And pray at the end, so I got one right here from Atlanta, it says:

[Verse 1: KB]
Dear KB, what's goin' on it's Ashley from the show
That you was doin' with Trip Lee, the Crew and the Spirit was movin', man, it was really dope
Yeah, when y'all left the A, I was so encouraged in the faith
And I blessed the Lord for HGA
I wanna start this off by sayin' thanks
(There's a battle going on)
But lately I've had this struggle with
Secrets of my past in the past, five years of singleness
(I know it) I'm lustin', I'm sinnin', but my lust here is different
Since I've been so alone I kinda long for the touch of a woman
(There's a battle going on)
And I know it's wrong, but dudes never ever show me attention
I go unnoticed, it was a joke but girls show me interest
Dudes at my church say that I'm the type of chick that they want (they lie)
But when I see the girls they date I know they really don't
I get jealous quick, I hate the mirror, I don't feel pretty
I've even contemplated surgery to feel skinny
I know it's real silly, the world tells me "Just embrace it
You were born this way" (that's a lie, it's just lust)
I tried talking to the people at church
But they just look at me funny only addin' to the hurt
Now I'm torn cause the other day I stumbled over porn
I'm supposed to be a leader, man, how can I move on? (this is a lie)
That's why I'm comin' to you prayin'
I'm prayin' that you can pray for your sister to make it through
I'm cryin' as I write cause I wanna be right
Many girls have fallen and I don't wanna fall too

[Hook: KB & Jai]
There's a war inside my heart and mind, every day I fight it
So make me align to the truth and rely on your Spirit inside me
(It's time to make) war war war war war war cause life is a battlefield
War war war war war war cause life is a battlefield

[Verse 2: Swoope]
Dear KB, we're big fans of yours, me and my lady
When you came to the show we was in the front row
Screamin' One-One-Six, goin' crazy all for the HGA
Was a crazy night, what's even crazier
Is the girl I was datin' then is fiance now, I'm engaged to her
The words that you left man rocked us
So I went and got her left hand rocked up
But if I could be honest, I'm tryin' hard to abstain and not get her knocked up
Of course I want kids, but even more than that I wanna please the Father
But when I look into her eyes I can't concentrate
Man I can't even lie, I wanna consummate
She's the one I'm sure but I wanna stay pure
Scary the way that I'm yearnin' for her
Gettin' married but I'm burnin' for her
Hard for me to wait 'til she walk in that aisle down
In her white gown, I'm thinkin' night gown
Man I wanna do it right now
Why wait when I feel like she my wife now?
The way that I'm feeling is natural but KB is it godly?
Is it wrong lust or strong love, this feeling inside for wifey?
Honored the Lord in datin' her, wanna do the same in waitin' but
This temptation's a beast, please pray for us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
Dear God, we come in His name
The slain and risen who's runnin' this thing
Christ the Lord, the one who can bring
Healin' the hurts of the ones that He claims
We think we got nothin' to gain
By clingin' to Christ, the love of the King
But He was under the same
Temptin' and hurt, He's accustomed to pain
Know they feel it, feel it
Pain but they joy can kill it, kill it
Feelin' like life been pillaged
Can I please intercede for a minute
This is not out of Your grasp
Your grace can shake, Your power can smash
I pray this hour and ask
Allow them to see Your power surpass
That said, devour they past
Drown them with mercy, shower them fast
Give 'em the faith to follow the Father
He's Abba, Your Honor, please swallow the trash
Dear Lord, you were never gone
You promised You'd make 'em forever strong
Your arm isn't short, it is very long
Make 'em like Christ, You get 'em home

[Hook]
