[Intro]
I wanna introduce ya'll to a friend of mine
A lot of ya'll don't know him
But maybe you'll understand if he talks to you

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Good evening, it's me, yeah it sounds so strange
May not know me but I'm in my house all day
Since I came I ain't never been without no fame
Always grab attention, mayne' without no strain
Yeah you heard of me, maybe I slipped out your brain
Some they really love me, no doubt, no vain
Others think I'm whack like "he sounds so lame"
Some are somewhere in the middle like when alto sing
But yup, you might find me fresh of the presses
Dressed in the best, love I can't spare to reckon
Lives over lives, I'm direct with a message
Incapable of lies, come correct when I step in
Known to change lives, yeah my rep is impressive
Some don't really get me, cause I am hard to see
I've split up some families, I'm known to cause wreckage
Some don't really get me, they say I'm hard to read

[Hook (Sample)]
Know me
Know me, Know
Know me
Know me, Know

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Hey, I'm so old school but I'm relevant to new
In the league of my own, known for tellin' them the Truth
I know fakes that oppose, but I'm tellin' em' to move
Cause' they ain't on my level like my elevator moved
They try to hang, and compete with what I bring
But they just ain't the same, they miss, they playin' games
I got Truth that they missin' and power they can't obtain
They fakes, they not real, one day they will be ashamed
No challenges can harm me, I'm battlin' the storm
I know folks that got my quotes tatted on they arms
But they missin' the point, from Atlanta to the Bronx
If they lives don't change then they patterns ain't informed
I'll give you data, speak on matters that'll form
The way you see the world from your calories to porn
If you hear me but never change, better be alarmed
I need doers, not just hearers
That's the norm, Let's go!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
Hey throughout my lifetime, I done seen a lot of folks
Been around the world but ain't seen a lot of hope
And I came to help if they believed in what I spoke
Most ain't listen very well, they just read a lot of quotes
Been used and abused by most of families
Some dudes in them pews, please don't remind me
The views that they choose, really don't define me
Look, I just wanna be understood
Hey, I'm a great storyteller and a beast of a poet
A master historian, esteemed by the coldest
And all of this is centered around He's who they notice
But didn't recognize as the King who controls it
The most high up, and I'm so inspired
By you moved, created everything, done triumph
I take it, He's a lover plus a known fighter
But I can't take credit cause' I got a ghost writer

[Outro]
You ain't caught it yet?
I'm talkin' bout' The Word
Yeah, and if you don't know Him you need to
Study His ways and they will keep you from evil
Word!

[Sample]
Talk to me, I'll understand
When You talk to me
Because you know how to make
Me, make me feel so good
