Yes Sir
Yes Sir

Thriteen letters man ..
We gonna take a little look at the letter that Paul wrote to Titus
And I'm praying that it'll help us see how we can apply
Get a brief overview, and encourage further study
(Yea, lets get it)

Lets take a look at the letter Paul wrote to Titus
Yea, we 'bout to dive in, I hope you're exited (c',mon)
Fo sho it's inspired, lets go and apply it
Arrive at conclusions useful to giving
Christ His glories that he deserves
The story is in His word
Titus is all about giving Him glory as his church
From Paul, a bonservant, to Titus, they both fervent
Both serving Christ with their life with the most urgence
Titus was his disciple, he left him in Crete, (Why?)
To keep the church in order, his lesson's complete . . 
With rules about elders, fools who need help and
Jews who do fail, stay tuned, see what He tells us
It may seem far from us, just irrelevent text
"Look, what if we not pastors?" ("but just rest for a second") "ok"
I promise I'll bring it home, let's invest in the text (c *mon)
I'm about to hit you with the hook, I be addressing it next

[hook]
Let's be sound in faith
In doctrine, in speech plus deeds
Rep Jesus, the king, let Him lead us, please
Plus we see He told us how we must be
Let's read and trust Jesus who freed us, please
In our faith, in doctrine, in speech plus deeds
Rep Jesus, the King, let Him lead us, please
Plus we see He told us how we must be
Lets read and trust Jesus who freed us, please

Paul told him elders needed to be above reproach
With love and hope and livin' all the stuff He spoke
But then there are those who wear the clothes of elders
But bear the roles of false teachers not speaking truth
So don't select those, correct those men (correct 'em)
And defy'em they tryin', they say they know God
But by they deeds they deny' Him
1:5-9 are the type of cats we wanna pick
For leadership within the church, them other cats we 'pose to fix
But hold up, don't tune me out, I hope that you endure and see
That these things are really marks of a mature believer
We can see that and apply it to our own livin
Instead of sinnin, trippin and livin with no vision
Don't miss the catch too (really?), it addresses me and you
And everybody in the body with some lessons we can use
So read it all and pick the parts that seem to be to you
Live out the sound doctrine, let people see the fruit

Let's be blameless and show consideration for men (why?)
Cause we was just like them before he saved us within (ok)
It wasn't strange we had rage and hatred for men (men)
Disobedient, diseased and enslaved to our sin (slaves)
But He saved us, not on the basis of men
But thanks to His mercy regeneration begins
Poured out His holy spirit, man He placed it within
Justified by grace, thats so amazing for men
If we see this, believe this, we saved and free
We say "Jesus, lead us to engage in deeds"
Forget foolish controversy and stay in sync
With He who saved us, and raised us, His name is sweet (c'mon)
I pray that as the body of Christ we model His life
And reference the book of Titus to follow Him right
And we're an accurate reflection as his beautiful church
And let us rep Him with our words and our beautiful works (yes)
