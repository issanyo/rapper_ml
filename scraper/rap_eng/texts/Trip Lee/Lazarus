[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Boy I hopped up out the grave, good morning!
I'd been sleeping for too long, I'm yawning
Everybody talking tryna seeing me
Disbelief like "How he breathin? He was six feet deep!"

What ya sayin?
Hold up shut ya mouth
Dead man can't holla what you talkin 'bout?
Cause once you through that door it ain't no walkin out
Let me take you back in time to my coffin now
I know you smell it in the air
Cause I been in the grave for too long I swear
People crying, I'm missing
Obituary been written
My face pale, They can't tell
Your boy 'bout to be risen
Close the coffin, call the preacher, he's so gone
It's over can't nobody reach him, say so long
Hey but hold on, before you cry and run out
Cause somebody coming saying something yelling come out

[Hook]
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Hopped up out the grave, Good Morning!
I been sleeping for too long, I'm yawning
They bury me, black suit, black tie
I'm alive and I woke up looking fly
So from now on
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
Former deadman walkin Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
Former deadman walkin Lazarus

[Verse 2: This'l]
They got a missing person report and they can't find the body
Let 'em tell the story, I was shot up at a party
Or was I high-speeding on a bike?
Head on to a truck, high speeding through a light
You can tell it any way you like
End story homie I was raised up by the Christ
Still dead man walking, Green Mile
Go and check my grave it's been cleaned out
Now come and look into my eyes bro
You can see the fire go and tell 'em I'm alive bro
Full of power like a wire bro
God connected to me like some cables and I'm fired up
Dead men don't talk, Dead lies aren't truth, Dead men don't walk
So what that means for me is that they signed off
On my death warrant but I was raised before it dried off

[Hook]
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Hopped up out the grave, Good Morning!
I been sleeping for too long, I'm yawning
They bury me, black suit, black tie
I'm alive and I woke up looking fly
So from now on
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
Former deadman walkin Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
Former deadman walkin Lazarus


[Bridge: Trip Lee]
Hopped up out the grave, thriller style
They ain't think that He could do it but He did it now
I mean The Captain, The Almighty Lord
Setting captives free, all aboard (all aboard)
Can't stop Him when He got His mind made up
He don't like that grave, sayonara see you later
He make the blind see and got the lame up
So it's no surprise He can raise us

[Hook]
Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now!
Believers when your life is lookin' tough now
When you at your all time low
Don't forget that power that He already showed

[Hook]
Hopped up out the grave, Good Morning!
I been sleeping for too long, I'm yawning
They bury me, black suit, black tie
I'm alive and I woke up looking fly
So from now on
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
Former deadman walkin Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
From Now on you can call me Lazarus
