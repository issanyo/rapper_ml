[Intro]
Gentlemen, prepare to lead
Release The Kracken

[Intro 2]
I am the herald of He who sits high and looks low
God, In the presence of the Almighty
Ruler of the universe
Creator of all things
Holy, Righteous
Need I go on?

[Verse 1 (Derek Minor)]
There is no one greater, Elohim the only creator
You sent Your Son to earth, He is our only Savior
You are our only maker, all of the claimers are fakers
They try to take Your glory; can't get any lamer!
Break out in precious jewels, wearing it look something mean
But they cheap imitations, they gon' turn yo neck green!
Wear my faith on my sleeve even if they make me bleed
Let 'em take my life, I give You all of me
Omnipotent, omnipresent, You rule over earth and heaven
Time is on the plot as You, You see past, future and present
I don't deserve to know You, yet You give me Your blessings
You made me new and gave me life, I'm forever indebted

[Hook]
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
I-I-I see no one greater, that's why I live for the savior
Though it's not good enough, I give you all of me
They-they can take everything, but I give you all of me
Yes you deserve more, I give you all of me
I give you all of me, I give you all of me

[Verse 2 (JSon)]
Yeshua, tran-translation Jesus Christ and He's ruler
Who you got that compares to Him only stands as manure
Man, He slashed it, blast it, bashed it, mashed it, bagged it in death
Back in passion, passion has us in His fabulous grip
So death come on letâ€™s go
He let em go
He made the grave breathe
Literally coughed Him up
He looked back like "What?!"
Check on your dang scheme
Calls me for Him, through Him, by Him, just read Paul and you'll see
I denied Him, tried to fight Him
His light kept drawing me
So here, take all of me
And I won't hold back no part of me
See there was nothing but dark on me
Til the Son made Himself dawn on me
Now see He should blow your mind today
Li-listen to every line I say
His watch is broke, our skies are low
Cuz He stands outside of time and space
Who's greater?

[Hook]
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
I-I-I see no one greater, that's why I live for the savior
Though it's not good enough, I give you all of me
They-they can take everything, but I give you all of me
Yes you deserve more, I give you all of me
I give you all of me, I give you all of me

[Verse 3 (Trip Lee)]
Hey what they think this is, think they messing with a rookie?
Now He's the Holy Spirit, you should see from where He took me
Was running from the Lord, He chased me down and then He booked me
The Father sent him out to get me, He never forsook me
The holy hound dog, the holy bounty hunter
The Lord sent Him for ya? Then He's bound to hunt ya
You will be found dawg, then you'll be crown-called
That mean the king's calling, knees to the ground dawg
Then you'll be runnin' to Him, can't put Him on the back burner
Old me, He put him in a casket turned up wormy
Put 'em in a (?)
(?) Blam!
Raised from the dead I'm back
Seem like everything clearer like flat screens
Ever since I got dragged to the Great King

[Hook]
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
Who can be compared to You? No, I see no one greater
I-I-I see no one greater, that's why I live for the savior
Though it's not good enough, I give you all of me
They-they can take everything, but I give you all of me
Yes you deserve more, I give you all of me
I give you all of me, I give you all of me
