Listen
Now I'dn heard a lota he say she say in my life in time
And the days keep rollin, no replay I wanna be sure to live it right
Cause I want that (want that) need that (need that)
And if it's real homie, I can't believe that
So if you help me find which way should I go with my life

My homie said you gotta live for the moment
On this earth you never know how long you on it
Gotta get a goal you don't wanna say you blown it
(Don it?) Seem like you should get it if you want it
My other homie said life is a vapour
A breath, better not waste it tryna chase paper
Cancer, cash and your slacks in the grave ya
Done for can't no body save ya, thank ya
My homie said life's a game you gotta play right
No script, write your own story like a playwright
It's no fate right? You just gotta face life
Give or take never make the same mistake twice
I heard the sayin life's a gift you gotta use well
Choose well, cause we seen a lotta dudes fail
True but when you do turn get a new trail
The old juice fail drink from a new well

Now I'dn heard a lota he say she say in my life in time
And the days keep rollin, no replay I wanna be sure to live it right
Cause I want that (want that) need that (need that)
And if it's real homie, I can't believe that
So if you help me find which way should I go with my life

My homie said life sucks then it's over
It's so rough so you gotta roll with a toaster
Silver spoon, no sir, mob like soldiers
Tight but you can't make so what, hold up
My other homie said life can be stiff man
Its bland, till you gotta hope that can withstand
Its grand if you gotcha eyes on the big plan
Keep watch don't let it take you out like a hitman
My homie said you gotta look for that great stuff
Can't just live ordinary for the Saviour
God wants to bless me, I should step my faith up
He loves me enough that He'll keep me from that pain, bruh
My other homie said God wants to bless you
And yes you should call upon His name for your rescue
He'll give you all you need, here's the Son He accepts you
You might need tests through trials to correct you

Now I'dn heard a lota he say she say in my life in time

And if it's real homie, I can't believe that
So if you help me find which way should I go with my life

Now should I follow what you say, or should I come up with my own way
What you say they tell me, I'm lookin for advice man that will never fail me
I got questions, so confused now, hopin you don't let me down
If only there was somebody who had it all figured out
Yea that would give me strength no doubt

Yea
Look man my Lord said that He made life
Night to the day light, from the same Christ
Lose your life for His sake, and you save life
Birth don't mean nothing if it ain't twice (twice)
My Lord said He came this earth so He gave life
Can't quite aim high enough to match His great life
Man we ain't right, turn to His great might
Life is eternal through faith right? Right
