[Intro: Natalie Lauren]
We're living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land
We're living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land
We're living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land
We're living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
You're tryna live the dream, ain't ya?
The cream, esteem, supreme paper
You're thinkin' this the place to be, like green acres
Look, you're livin' a dream and I can't even wake
I know you want the life that they all desire
Wanna rise till you can't imagine climbin' higher
But that ladder can't stand when it catches fire
And when it stops, you'll be shocked, like electric wires
It's cool to like fairytales
Until you try to live inside of 'em, that's where we fail
The media pushin' death and they do it very well
Man, who woulda thought that obituaries sell?
Look, you're livin' in a dream
Open up your eyes, things ain't always what they seem
Reality ain't always what we found up on the screen
They got bait, in they hooks, they got rhymes full of schemes, it's fantasy

[Hook: Natalie Lauren and (Trip Lee)]
Fantasy, masquerades and mansions (all they want is that fantasy)
Smokin' lies, but there is never light within us
The smiles full of envy, a full house that's empty
Once the night is up, it's never enough

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Your imagination's runnin' wild
Your main goal is to stack a couple hundred thou
Then mo' money, plus you want it now
You be huntin' for them hundreds till you run 'em down
Plus you want chicks, wanna pick or choose
She gotta be a freak, not just any chick will do
That's the story that you stickin' to, listen dude
Just know the fable that they told you really isn't true
Hey mami, you think you want that life, don't you?
See you're that fine dame all the brothers droolin' over
But you should know your beauty will be movin' over
When He cracks the sky like a supernova, to expose us
I ain't runnin' game, I ain't got nothing to gain
'Bout lyin' to you 'bout this life, but something is strange
If the highest joy is found in created things
Instead of something greater but I gotta make a claim, it's fantasy

[Hook: Natalie Lauren and (Trip Lee)]
Fantasy, masquerades and mansions (all they want is that fantasy)
Smokin' lies, but there is never light within us (it's crazy)
The smiles full of envy, a full house that's empty (it's all empty)
Once the night is up, it's never enough

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
Never satisfied
You know, we been livin' in a dream world
A dream world where we been chasin' the wrong things
But my prayers is our eyes will open
So we can see it all for what it is
Welcome to the real world
With it's real treasure, real pearls
Those who try to gain the world only lose souls
And chasin' fools goals only gets ya fools gold
Well, welcome to the good life with it's real joy
Now that old life seems like a killjoy
It's ironic that the life giver was killed, boy
He rose and He chose me, you know he fills a real void
We were made to be connected to the life giver
To build our life around Him, with His life in us
But our pride likes to rise, them lies get us
They separate us from the good, we despise scripture
But we can turn back to the forever source
The One who can't be described by my metaphors
Even if I'm poor, I'm rich if I let Him set the course
At His right hand, the pleasure's forever more, yeah

[Hook: Natalie Lauren and (Trip Lee)]
Fantasy, masquerades and mansions (we don't have to live in that fantasy)
Smokin' lies, but there is never light within us (yeah yeah)
The smiles full of envy, a full house that's empty (we don't have to be empty, y'all)
Once the night is up, it's never enough (cause Jesus is enough)

[Outro: Natalie Lauren]
We're living in la, la, la, la, la, la, land
We're living in la, la, lie, la, la, la, land
And you gon' see it all for what it is
I pray you'll see it all for what it is
