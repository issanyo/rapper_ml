Air Jordans are iconic. I didn’t wear them much growing up though, because my parents refused to buy me ridiculously expensive shoes. I didn’t like it, but I knew I would never get my hands on a pair. So I was forced to cope – by pretending they didn’t exist. It was a long couple of years trying to convince myself that Reebok cross trainers were stylish. But as I got older, I realized Jordans were hard to ignore. All of my friends had a pair or two, and one of my friends was downright obsessed with them.

When a new style came out, he wouldn’t just stop by the local Foot Locker when he had some free time; he built his life around getting that new pair. He made sure he knew all the Jordan release dates, he would buy the same shoes in different colors, and he would often spend Saturday mornings camped out in front of shoe stores. It blew my mind. So finally I had to ask myself, “What is so special about these shoes?! Clearly I’m missing out on something.”

My friend’s obsession with Jordans made a statement. Whether true or not, he was saying loud and clear that these shoes were worth rearranging your life for. What kind of statement does your life make?
