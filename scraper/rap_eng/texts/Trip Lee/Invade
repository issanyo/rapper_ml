[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
You know the plight of us
All the pains and the strains that this life covers
Things never go right, it's the gripe of us
It's like life came and took all the life from us, from us
Was supposed to go this way
Hearts cold from coast to coast this days
Full of hope and nope it's gone, this grave
We need light and life to come invade
This cold world ain't nice to us
We so blind like the sights took our sight from us
I know you heard it more than once kinda like stutters
But this world needs help, all the likes of us, of us
What a lonely road is paved
With some broken souls that groan midways
On our domes we long to go get away
We can't go it alone come on invade

[Hook: J. Paul]
In this broken world we wanna find a way
Cause it all went wrong, tell me who can take it away
Invade our world (come and invade our world)
Invade our world (come and invade our world)

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
You know the place where we placed at
It's like loves been erased they replaced that
There's no food in the crib where they plates at
The kid got shot in the place where he plays at
Jay said this can't be life
I'm looking at the world like this can't be right
We looking for the light but we can't be night
We looking for our health but we can't see right (see right)
Come on y'all we gotta face facts
His years go tears roll down his face?
When he had a lot of hope it would fade black
Now he cold and he ain't really fazed at anything
Anything his face seems light
Cause his moneys out like they made three strikes
Needs something to come down invade these nights
A real life Hero need that'll make things right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
I know of some folks thinkin
This dude trippin what he drinkin
What kinda little dream he chasin
He gonna spend his whole life waitin (I'm waitin)
For someone to come down to change this song
But not just me man creation groans
We are waiting for someone to erase this wrong
The Kingdom is here the invasions on

[Hook]

Come and invade our world
Come and invade our world
Come and invade our world
Come and invade our world
