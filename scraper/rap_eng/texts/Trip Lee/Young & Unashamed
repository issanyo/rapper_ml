[Verse 1:]
Hey when they see ya boy, what's they first impression?
Probably not a teen redeemed from the worst transgressions
That's repented from the path of His first ancestors
Was cursed but since rebirth this person's dressed in
The glorious righteousness of Christ
They probably think I'm on the stage cause I like the mic
Or like to get hype, but really I'm laid back main
But sometimes could lose my mind if you say that name
(Who?) Jehohah Jireh, my soul's provider
Life without Him's a contradiction like bein' poor with Prada
I done wrote a lot of flows, in my soul's a fire
That shut up in my bones, ah my soul desire
Is for some slick guys to the know the Lord He died
But still the Son did rise like it was mornin' time
So if you think you fully satisfied with a vette with chrome
You better check yourself like playin' chess alone
I'm a stranger, is Earth really my residence? Nope
I'm a alien and I can't wait to rest at home
My dress ain't always fresh to def I ain't impressed with clothes
But Christ, He's the key to life dog and death's the door (and rebirth)
Since the moment I believed, my flesh was broke
Sin lost it's control and death it's hold
So maybe now you'll understand and get up in ya brain
Why ya boy so young and unashamed

[Verse 2:]
They don't associate ya boy with Christ Jesus kid
Cause I got my hat cocked and my jeans is big
No suit and tie, tall tees and kicks
But you ain't gotta be a geek to preach that Jesus lives
So it's almost strange when they see me hit tha street blocks
Cause with my life I copy Christ like a Xerox
No heat cocked, I roll with the Lord and
With a team full of Saints like I play for New Orleans
We hold each other accountable when seekin sound doctrine
Through Christ we been found not guilty without Cochran
We kingdom people selected to rep His name
Forget bout cheddar main, Christ is the better thing
I don't let no weapon hang, I don't roll with thugs
That's holdin drugs and spendin all they dough in clubs
I roll with a gang of believers that's crazy for Jesus
That's saved from the flames and unashamed of His teachings
Cats be like, "You just a baby, how you know about the Lord?"
To know Jehovah at His core we had to open up our swords
We read His word on a daily, His inspired text
And submit to the Spirit dog, we died to flesh
I confess, they tell us that our youth is bein wasted
Instead of jewels up in a bracelet, we speak truth each time we make hits
So maybe now it's stuck up in ya brain
Why the 116 is so young and unashamed

[Verse 3:]
Cats don't really understand, they think I lost my mind
They hood on they back, but I rock a cross on mine
Walk with Christ in light, blood bought plus I'm
Not dark as night, I'm light because I sought His shine
I was livin' for today, was always caught in crimes
Bout guilty as O.J., my talk and walk declined
The Boss of time and space, but I put that to rest man
I saw my old life, it wasn't right like my left hand
Now He orders my steps and with Him is how I walk bro
Got off the highway to Hell and I took the cross roads
Now I'm walkin with Christ, what beautiful thing
It's cooler than fame, more precious than jewelry and chains
Most think God is just old school like Kool and the Gang
They wanna be like Jeezy, Jay-Z and Ludacris main
But I'm here today to say that if you want a greater day
Don't fade away, cling to Christ and His amazing savin grace
If you a Christian who accepted the King and you clean
We gotta move, the Lord is pleased when we play on His team
I hope young believers understand, I pray it's in ya brain
If we love the Lord we must be young and unashamed
