[Intro: Trip & Q]
Say uh (uh)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say boss (boss)
There you go

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
Oh I love you (yeah)
Like no other (yeah)
When I see you smile you shine just like the summer (yeah, oh)

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
You know the feeling when them words fail
Hard to verbalize what I wanna tell
To my mini me, my little man
You talking baby talk - I don't know what you be saying
But it's music to my ears though
Boom bap to your daddy when i'm near though
Mommy put you in them polos and skinnies
Curly fro wild you be flier than a leer though
You got that mixed kid swag on
Lookin like your momma and your dad on 'em
Straight out the womb you was real fresh
I cried so hard 'till there ain't tears left
Since then you keep a smile on my face
Wrestlin' and dancin', wildin the place up
Look I know you got my name but I want you wearing his living for his fame

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
Oh I love you (yeah)
Like no other (yeah)
When I see you smile you shine just like the summer (yeah, oh)
My vision (yeah)
Can't be clearer no no no
Cause you're beautiful it's no wonder I love you

[Bridge: Dimiti McDowell]
I can't believe you're mine
I can't believe you're mine
You're always on my mind
I can't believe you're all mine (x2)

Can't believe
Can't believe you're all mine (x2)

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Second verse to my baby girl
You and your mama y’all my favorite girls
To my dear Selah Simone
It took forever, now we bringing you home, you’re all mine
You’re the cutest of all time
Even though you keep us up all night crying
And I think your brother’s in love
A little rough, but he’s giving you hugs
Plus you know I can’t wait to watch y’all grow
Can’t wait to watch that show (what show?)
God’s grace in your life and you know
No matter how it goes that your daddy’s staying close
And I’ll be sure to tell you every day
You’re made in his image, baby you ain’t gotta wait
To hear no affirmation from them dudes in the streets
You already know you’re beautiful to me

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]

[Bridge: Dimitri McDowell]

[Outro: Trip Lee]
What a great gift from a great God
What a great gift from a great God
You belong to Him but He gave you to me
You belong to Him but He gave you to me (2x)

Thanks man, it might make the album
