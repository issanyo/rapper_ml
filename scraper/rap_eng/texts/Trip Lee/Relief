Ah what a relief it is
To be in Christ He's the life that I need to live
I'm in love with the fact, that some sheep are His
What would for your own? He would bleed for His
I heard of other Gods, but none of them are like Him
They sit up in they paradise lamping
But He's perfect and it's odd, cause though they would deny Him
He came down and met His own standards
His own commandments, and laws
But man we are flawed, none of us could stand since the fall
But His plan was to call, He who answered was called
A son, when you come all your sins are dissolved
Yep I'm in awe cause I'm sick of my sin
But since we been bought we've forgiven through Him
A great family, we in it's crazy
The road that we travel is slimmer than Shady

Ah what a relief it is
To be in Christ, He's the life that we need to live
What a relief it is to be in Jesus
What a relief it is to rest in you

Ah what a relief it is
To be in Christ He's the life that I need to live
I'm blown away when I peek at the deeds He did
I'm quite speechless, He's more than Easter His
Great advent destroyed the works of the demons and evil prince
Let His deeds convince
Seen by some as a great man who teaches sense
And good morals, but please don't be content
With that reading of Jesus, He was sent
He made legions and seas repent, anyone's weak
People are feeble, with evil bents
Name stuff, all things they sit at the Son's feet
The wage we earned was lethal hence
The death He had to die, wrath satisfied
Now believers are righteous in the legal sense
Justified by His grace, let our deeds convince

Ah what a relief it is
To be in Christ, He's the life that we need to live
What a relief it is to be in Jesus
What a relief it is to rest in you

Ah what a relief it is
To be in Christ He's the life that I need to live
When my life ain't right, gotta peak at His
Take notes, see what true strength and meakness is
He lived the we couldn't, cause we rebel
We so sinful, and we let them deeds prevail
But even if we tried, to seek Him in our lives
We can't, we weak and we need Him to provide
Just look at our corruption there's a clear problem
The raping, the robbing to God it's disgusting
The lust and the pride can't just be covered up
With a bunch of other stuff we must trust Him
I praise Him that we did, some was bumping in the club
Others was toting a pump and running with them thugs
But look at us now we ain't running with them bloods
If you see some red on us it's cause we covered in His blood

Ah what a relief it is
To be in Christ, He's the life that we need to live
What a relief it is to be in Jesus
What a relief it is to rest in you
