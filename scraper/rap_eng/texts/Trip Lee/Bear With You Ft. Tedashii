Ladies and Gentlemen
Ye yeaaaaa, Ye yeaaaaa, Ye yeaaaaa, Ye yeaaaaa
Ok, Let's go

Look
Homie we all fallen, friendships ain't nothin' easy
I get done dirty often, my folks do something greezy
Feel my back on the wall and, I ask my Lord to free me
Cause yeah anger be callin, but I know my brothers need me
Gotta get low til I'm crawlin, try to get humble , see we...
Notice each others flaws, but sometimes it's hard to see me
I do folk dirty too, sins that thing we sure to do
Jesus died to reconcile, now you gotta murder you
Die to self so much that you get convicted of murder too, attacking me instead of them
Something I must learn to do
Revenge I heard of you, no I ain't scurred of you
Cause Jesus died to kill you in me, so I scrrr from you
Look I've been raised with Him, taken out them chains in Him
Tryin to put off anger, wrath, malice all them things in em
Put on meekness, kindness, patience every fight can't win em
Used to hold a grudge against them, lately I forgave em

It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind
But I gotta keep the gospel in mind
Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine
I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya

It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind
But I gotta keep the gospel in mind

I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya

You already know to bear wit'em bro (eh, eh, we gotta bear)
You already know to bear wit'em bro bro (we, we, we gotta bear)
You already know to bear wit'em bro (eh, eh)

I know of two homies, one dude had borrowed paper
He took two hundred forty, he'd repay all of it later
He was trippin on em, was callin something major
And errbody knows can't do that when it comes to paper
He hit him on the phone, but he ignored the calls
Text message, e-mail, but he ignored it all (whaa)
He saw him at the mall, It was a scary picture
He just dapped his homie up, (like whaa), like I'ma bear with ya

What about this married couple (whaa), been married 10 years
Before they tied tha knot, the husbands role had been clear (but whaa)
But then they life started, he seemed really sincere
But wrestled with laziness, been unemployed for six years
Was supposed to get a job, while she was out the house
But then she got home, he ain't got off the couch
Yea she was grieved a lot, got up in his face though
(Like whaa) like I'ma bear with ya baby cause tha King rose

It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind
But I gotta keep the gospel in mind
Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine
I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya

Ok
Life done been crumby, since I been walkin a young'n
Call me different or funny, wish I could change it like money
Grew up off in the country, where lookin different meant funny
Stupid head or just ugly, no matter what it kept comin
Askin' momma where daddy, he ain't here to protect me
Teach me, raise me, or carry my load when it get heavy
So I did it on my own, fightn carryin on
It don't matter what they told me dawg, I thought I was grown
People tell me that I'm trippin, n i tell them they wrong
Hollah while I'm actin out, blamin my daddy who gone
Fast forward by 10, when God saved me from sin
And He changed my heart from dark to light to show to all men
And I got the conviction, call him up and stop trippin
Thats when I found out he's a Christian, who got saved in omission
Thats when it goes past religion, and then it makes an incision
Into your heart n then you start forgivin, man and start buildin

It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind
But I gotta keep the gospel in mind
Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine
I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya

It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind
But I gotta keep the gospel in mind
Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine
I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya

You already know to bear wit'em bro
You already know to bear wit'em bro
You already know to bear wit'em bro
You already know to bear wit'em bro

Where are my folks who sayin "I'ma confront you of your sin, but I'ma forgive you as I've been forgiven, I ain't gonna hold it against you"
Let's walk together
