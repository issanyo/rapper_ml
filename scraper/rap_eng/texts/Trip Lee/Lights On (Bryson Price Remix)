[Intro]
You are now listening to the sounds of Bryson Price

[Hook 1: Leah Smith]
Oh oh, the light (repeated)

[Bridge: Trip Lee]
Only you can take us higher, you the pilot
Lights please!

[Hook 2: Trip Lee] (Hook 1 repeated in background)
We don’t know where we going
We so far from our home
We don’t know where we going
Blackout, no power’s on
We don’t know where we going
My homies gone, they need you to show them so turn them lights on
We don’t know where we going
We so far from our home
We don’t know where we going
Blackout, no power’s on
We don’t know where we going
Until we go where living water is flowing
So Turn them lights on

[Verse: Trip Lee]
Taking off sleep mask, full speed with the seats back
Now I can drive head lights on, that steep cliff I see that
Detour, gotta turn around, young lady gotta turn her down
180, ain’t perfect now, but I press on and I get stronger
Man, thank you for dragging me out that dark room
Your truth pierced through my heart like harpoons, no cartoon
It’s a blackout, no light just black out
Please give them grace, I know you got more light to pass out

[Hook 1 + 2]

[Outro: Leah Smith]
Can you turn the lights on
Can you turn the lights on, on
Can you turn the lights on
Can you turn the lights on, on
