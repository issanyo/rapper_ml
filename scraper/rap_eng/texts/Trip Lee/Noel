[Intro: Trip Lee]
Yeah

[Chorus: Dave James & Trip Lee]
Baby laying in the manger
On the first (On the first), first Noel
Being treated like a stranger (Feeling like)
On the first (On the first), first Noel
Ain't no crowd to disciple, (With no crowd)
On the first (On the first), first Noel
Flesh and bone just like you (Flesh and bone)

[Hook: Dave James & Trip Lee]
On the first, first Noel
Noel, Noel
The first Noel
Noel, Noel
The first Noel

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Creation been groanin'
Then the sun showed up, good mornin'
Even those who waited for Him
Could've looked Him in the eyes and would've known Him
I'd like to say that I would, but I can't, bro
Who would've known that a baby would reign all
The One who made the skies and cried
Still surprised you could swaddle up, God
Spotlight, give Him center stage
Find the north star, down the interstate
Silly sheep (Yeah), we went astray
But He arrived (Right), not a minute late (Yeah)
Heart conquered too, came to renovate (Renovate)
Came to serve me, gave me Word on the dinner plate (Word, uh-huh)
Who would've known that this babe was the King on the throne?

[Hook: Dave James & Trip Lee]
The first Noel
Noel, Noel
The first Noel
Noel, Noel (Yessir)
The first Noel

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
The people be yearning
For some hope, but the folks kept turning
Him away, He was born with the vermin
Living Word, He the last great sermon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
He descended to where sinners be
And rejected Him, Who brought 'em what they really need (Crazy)
Creation's groans are retired (Word)
Drowned out by the baby's first cry (Yeah)
Lift Him up, He the centerpiece
Came to His home, it was bittersweet (Bittersweet)
He was in the womb, plotting inner peace (Inner peace)
Made friends out of enemies (Yeah)
The winning streak (Huh), it ain't finna cease
Baby clothes couldn't cloak His divinity, yeah
Who would've known that this babe was the King on the throne?

[Chorus: Dave James & Trip Lee]
Baby laying in the manger
On the first (On the first), first Noel
Being treated like a stranger (Feeling like)
On the first (On the first), first Noel
Ain't no crowd to disciple, with no crowd
On the first (On the first), first Noel
Flesh and bone just like you (Flesh and bone)

[Bridge: Dave James]
It wasn't that easy to find You (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
But now that I'm here it's the safest place (Safest place)
I see all the light that's inside You (See, see, see)
A river that's flowing, unending grace

[Hook: Dave James & Trip Lee]
The first Noel
Noel, Noel
The first Noel
Noel, Noel
The first Noel

[Outro: Dave James]
The first Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King
Born is the King, yeah
Born is the King of Israel
