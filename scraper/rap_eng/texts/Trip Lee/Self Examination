[Intro:]
Yeah
Ay wat it do
It's ya boy Trip Lee man
Yeah you can ride to this
Ay man but while you ridin to it
Listen to the words homie
Yeah we can't just go through life chillin man
We gotta stop and examine ourselves
Let me tell you what I'm sayin

[Vesre 1:]
Yeah we was born sinners man, dead in the flesh
Unfamiliar with the Lord's livin man, He bled to the death
But we love our sin instead of Him, we fans of the flesh
If you think I'm lyin man, put a man to the test
We all full of lies, full of pride, full of dirty lust
And we put our lives ahead of God's Word we should trust
We all knew it was a dude above who made everything
But we run a way, love our ways, and never gave Him praise
But for some of us He made a way up out of this dilemma
He sent His Son, and he was strung out for wicked sinners
Now all we gotta do is trust upon the righteousness of Christ
And He got something new for us (What?), the righteousness of Christ
You may believe it man, but have you trusted in Him yet?
And realized your sinful life will thrust you into death?
And that you need Him cause in the flesh man is fadin
Time for self examination like you was the Dr and the patient

[Hook:]
We gotta look ourselves over
Have we standing with Jehovah
He's the man and He can hold us
You'll be standing as His soldier
It's time for self examination, we need a self examination
It's time for self examination, we need a self examination man
What are lives look like
Cause fo real we should fight
To enjoy lifting Christ
And to shine His good light
It's time for self examination, we need a self examination
It's time for self examination, we need a self examination man

[Verse 2:]
A lot of us claim to be believers but we slack in our walk
And we goin around everyday without our backs to the cross
And when it comes to servin Christ, we standin on the wall
But we say we Christian cause we went up for the altar call
That don't mean that we believers, that don't mean we saved from flames
If we ain't workin for Him our faith is dead like it say in James
If it ain't no better livin, we the same and steady sinnin
Just know that faith without fruit wasn't faith from the beginnin
It's a lot of kids that got it twisted thinking they saved
But homie they ain't bout tha Fathers biz they sleep in they graves
And they gon be real disappointed man when they face judgement
And all along they though that they was saved, but they really wasn't
Sin's disgusting to the Father man, he can barely stand it
And the mark of the believer is keeping to His commandments
So if we content up in our sin, ain't seekin Jesus
We really need to cause we may not even be believers

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Now for some of us we claim to be in love with our God
But if we look around we can find that something is odd
And if we really look our love for the Son isn't thick
Cause we ain't really in love with Christ, we in love with His gifts
Man after you die and you gon and you go to Heaven
Would you be satisfied if you arrived and God wasn't present?
That's a question we should ask, are we choosin Christ?
Is he just a supplement, or is He our true delight? Holla at me

See most of the times what happens is
We just goin through life thinkin that everything is great
Thinkin everything is all good
Not stoppin and lookin, How we doin, Where we stand with our God
See we gotta stop and look to see if we made a decision to accept Christ
If we really trusted in Christ and His righteousness
And if we really in love with this God
It's time to examine ourselves

[Hook]
