I gotta brag on my KING so that we can see him clearer
We only know in part 'cause we peekin' in a mirror
We see He flipped everything He's on another tier
That's why they didn't recognize the King when He appeared
Most kings got bling they don't welcome any peers
Then you kiss a ring and they tell you,"Disappear"
You better listen here, my King flipped that cause He made Himself poor and He came real near
Most kings rule hard tryin' to instill fear
My King drew close, healed folks, shed tears
Some kings act the fool similar to King Lear
My King did the Father's will yeah He let Him steer
Most kings roll fly you can catch em in a lear
My King rode in on a donkey yeah that's weird
Listen to Him no jeer
His words are our peace
My game plan is what I hear - I play it by ear
They ain't got a King like mine - on the front line on the scene like mine
Flawless - no he ain't clean like mine
Never has another been seen like mine
They thought He shoulda been ballin' and He flipped that
They thought He shoulda been flossin' and He flipped that
He ain't do it like we thought 'cause he flipped that
Hands in the air - wave em till He get back
He's the King of Glory - Holy moly
Came to earth put a twist in the story
The uncreated Creator - the Only
Left His place on the throne for the lowly
Humiliated while blessing all His haters
Other kings say lets load the gankers
Word
He fixed the syntax
The king's ransom paid all my sin tax
They ain't got a King like mine - on the front line on the scene like mine
Flawless - no he ain't clean like mine
Never has another been seen like mine
They thought he shoulda been ballin' and He flipped that
They thought He shoulda been flossin' and He flipped that
He ain't do it like we thought cause He flipped that
Hands in the air - wave em till He get back
He wore a crown of thorns, enrobed in flesh
Obedient to God, made his road to death
Most kings kill rebels, but behold we're blessed
My king died so the rebels' souls could rest
The King's death didn't mean I lost no chess
'Cause He rose, now glorious His robe is fresh
Ain't nobody next, no heirs to the throne and there'll never be a day when he's gone
His reign is forever, my King is a treasure, found in a field God you can't be measured
He's that pearl of great price there is none better
He paid a great price -His life- not cheddar
We don't want to leave His kingdom
He won't let us
His enemies try to pluck us, they can't get us
They lie to us but the great King wrote letters
Plus our King is goin' to come back to get us - Yeah!
They ain't got a King like mine - on the front line on the scene like mine
Flawless - no he ain't clean like mine
Never has another been seen like mine
They thought He shoulda been ballin' and He flipped that
They thought He shoulda been flossin' and He flipped that
He ain't do it like we thought cause He flipped that
Hands in the air - wave 'em till He get back
