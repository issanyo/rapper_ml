[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Dear Daddy, I’m missing you so
So much I wish I could get up and go
Back to the past, kick it at home
I wish I could call you, pick up the phone
Used to clown, that’s gone
You would slap me upside of my dome
Now you not around when I be at home
I wish you was around me now that I’m grown
To see my wife in all white, walking that aisle, making me smile
Instead I saw you fight for your life
And what you miss now? The birth of my child
It gets worse, cause the second one’s here and it hurts
And they’ll never get to meet you, death did first
And it’s coming for me too, I’m cursed
I hear you

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
I hear your footsteps coming from behind
And I know, know that any day it might be my time
I’ll be ready if you coming
Ready, ain’t no running
I’ll be ready when it’s time, I’ll be ready
I’ll be ready for that moment
Only human and I know it
I’ll be ready when it’s time
I’ll be ready

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
I hate death, it ain’t right
Sneaks right up after daylight
One day you’re feeling great, then it’s over
Yeah my dad went fast, but took it like a soldier
Hold the presses, I’m losing my breath as I try to address it
I can’t escape it, I’m not that impressive
If death is a prison, we all get arrested
Every now and then take a look at his pic, so the image don’t slip away
Don’t wanna remember him laying in that bed, but I really can’t forget the day
I can’t think of a thing in my past
Harder than watching him breathing his last
Death, I know I’m in your path
I know I’m not free from your grasp
I hear you

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
I hear your footsteps coming from behind
And I know, know that any day it might be my time
I’ll be ready if you coming
Ready, ain’t no running
I’ll be ready when it’s time, I’ll be ready
I’ll be ready for that moment
Only human and I know it
I’ll be ready when it’s time
I’ll be ready

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
Hey death, we know you so well
Every time we rise up, you fight with no fail
You snatch us down, we so frail
Got no time to pretend
You take on every soul, and only see wins
We got no way to defend
But hey death, please know
We won’t have much to grieve for
When all your wins are repoed
And the reaper reaps what he sowed
I ain't gon run from you
What I got to flee for?
Did it hurt your self esteem when you heard your sting was no more?

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
I hear your footsteps coming from behind
And I know, know that any day it might be my time
I’ll be ready if you coming
Ready, ain’t no running
I’ll be ready when it’s time, I’ll be ready
I’ll be ready for that moment
Only human and I know it
I’ll be ready when it’s time
I’ll be ready
