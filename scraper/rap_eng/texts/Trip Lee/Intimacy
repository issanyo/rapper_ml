Oh Lord, I'm so amazed when I dig up in Your Scripture
Focused and trying to get You, hoping to get a picture
Of who You are, true You are, Holy hoping I miss You
When I get away and I miss a day spending it with You
That's foolish, I hope to know You and be a student
And learn Your Holy ways all my days with no excuses
Ooh its such a privilege to know the God that moves and
Soothes this wretched soul, it was cold but he renewed it
And when I look at the Psalms I just pause
Got me dropping my jaw, its clear You got 'em in awe
And we can see that they yearning for Your person
Panting after You, and their passion for You is burning
I'm trying to pursue You 'cause You precious as a pearl
More than I did with them girls, I used to mess with in the world
Relentless in my pursuit, I surrender it all to You
And I pray You draw me closer in intimate time with You

There's a longing for Your love
Not just a moment, intimate touch
There's a longing for Your love
Not just a moment, intimate touch

It's way too many times, I'm staying off on the grind
In other areas and I bury You in my mind
Then my life starts getting terrible, scarier and I find
Myself trying to get near to You, but You was here all the time
But I was having my share of affairs with things You designed
Kind of like a bad marriage, it's scary it's like I'm blind
And I'm praying You'd help me, hold me, and make me focus
I know that when I'm lacking You I'm more than hopeless
Mold this wicked heart to delight in Your precious person
Fighting, confessing, searching for Christ and lessons for learning
It ain't even nothing good in me that I might show You
But I can see that eternal life's that I might know You
I want to know You, be close to the God who saved me
And raised me, I pray we can be much closer
And I- I can embrace the beautiful life that You gave me
I count it all loss, Lord, that I might know ya

There's a longing for Your love
Not just a moment, intimate touch
There's a longing for Your love
Not just a moment, intimate touch

I'm longing for Your endless love
The knowledge of who You are
The truth that lies within Your Word
Show my heart who You are

Truly I can't wait 'til this flesh is removed
And I'm forever with You, sin's mess is removed
Then there's nothing in the way, there's none better than You
To ignore that I'm more wack, this fella's a fool
You so mysterious, I read about You see I
I am so in awe of You, I'm all for You, You truly fly
The truth is I'm in love with You and hope that You see I
Would like to see You and I in U-N-I-T-Y

There's a longing for Your love
Not just a moment, intimate touch
There's a longing for Your love
Not just a moment, intimate touch

Lord bring me closely
Intimately
So to show me
Who You are
And to fill my cup, Lord
Lord bring me closely
Intimately
So to show me
Who You are
And to fill my cup, Lord
Just a lil bit more
I need a lil bit more
Na-na-na-na
Just a lil bit more
I need a lil bit more
Na-na-na-na
I need, I need more and more
More and more
