[Bridge + Hook]
You give me a shield of salvation for this battle
You give me Your strength to call Your name in this battle
Let praise to our God, praise to our God
Be like arrows straight to our enemies
Let praise to our God, Praise to our God
Be like arrows straight to our enemies
‘Cause this is war, this is war, and this is war

[Verse 1 - Canon]
(They call me Canon)
Now pardon me if my heart make it harder
I don' mean for me to be fallin off like a leaf
But I am gettin goin like the wind comin up on autumn
So much mud in my water
The life I took in was so tainted
Until I drunk a cup from the stream of the living Author
Though my days’ll get longer I keep my conscience on lock
And on guard like a barber with clippers on the edge when I start up
This Gospel got me caught up
In the middle of fighting a battle
For the sake of the Gospel it's awesome
How I get awestruck
Still fighting when I’m following Jesus, the King
Oh, you better believe it
Man I cannot break away when the whole world finna stumble when it crumble to pieces
Look around this a circle of people like a schoolyard till we down with the kingdom
Kings give us stripes like Adidas
So the enemies stay down but beneath us
Satan there won’t be no slaughter no beef
Bow down to the Father
And if God is known as the author
Then what should the pot say to the potter?
And because there won’t be no replacement
Can’t nobody word that can claim that statement
It's Jesus Son of God who came in to die, better rise for the occasion!

[Hook]
Let praise to our God, praise to our God
Be like arrows, straight to our enemies
Let praise to our God, praise to our God
Be like arrows, straight to our enemies
‘Cause this is war, this is war, and this is war

[Verse 2 - Deraj]
The load can be light or heavy depending on how you weigh it
Sing a new song but be careful of what you sayin'
‘Cause words can hold power, for instance
Folks could catch it from a bow or bow just depending on how I say it so
I say I’ll sing it ‘till it reach Heaven
I’ll never be home alone He’ll never leave Kevin no
Know (I know) I know just what he said
Just like the blood that flows a pretty rose
He wrote it all in red and if the stars are overhead
And the flowers all sleep in bed and the sparrow is always fed
I bet I can trust what He said
He loved me when I was ugly, He could’ve left me for dead
He always be thinking of me, He chose to love me instead
And in spite of all that they said I was never begging for bread
Now I’m dancing out of my clothes
And y’all think I’m gone in the head
I’m lookin up overhead and I told em go on ahead of me
I’m still workin on all these melodies

[Bridge]
You give me a shield of salvation for this battle
You give me Your strength to call Your name in this battle

[Verse 3 - Trip Lee]
(Yes sir)
I see an army marchin to its place
Guns in the air with a grimace on their face
Armor on their bodies’ military boots laced
I can’t make it out alive oh Lord
So lord give me grace (please)
This is war, believe me this thing crazy
Smoke all in the air till the atmosphere hazy
But I ain’t starin at the enemy that hates me
I’m got my eyes on You Lord, you amaze me
Hey, they try to tell me that I’m gone
On the wrong side of the battle I should go home
Hold up, but I should tell em let em on
The side of the Lion of Judah, I know He's strong
I can’t win it on my own, shouldn't try
My heart is full of fire homie take a look inside
I ain’t got no other weapons on my side
But the truth so I'm shooting up my praise to the sky

[Hook]
Let praise to our God, praise to our God
Be like arrows, straight to our enemies
Let praise to our God, praise to our God
Be like arrows, straight to our enemies
‘Cause this is war, this is war, and this is war
