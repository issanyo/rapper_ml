[Intro]
Yeah... This life is so hard man..
And It seems like I'm always leading my self in the wrong direction
So I'm so grateful that the Lord leads me. I'm so grateful for the word of God...

[Verse 1]
Yeah Ay when I think
Back on the bad times, back on the great fail, back on my backside
A pathway was straight
The fact is I fail when my dad is around when I laz. When I lack Him I happen to drown
Lagging behind me, I'm slackin' and down
A sluggard yeah that would be an accurate noun
Been saved from the grave in his wrath I am found
Pretend to get lost on this path through the town, son
Lord I need you, I Run towards it's just Lord nothing I Want more than to seek you
When I see you it's easy as 1,2,3
When I'm missed it it's all twisted like it was 1,3,2
Ay if you saved I'm praying the Son leads you
You trust him and his Holy instruction will seek you. This God he's views like heart like you were see through and he redeemed you he's more than pleased to lead you..

[Chorus]
Life is hard, it's been a fight since the start
Only way to make It is
If Christ is my Lord
Teach me and lead me my life is yours
(Yeah you're my Lord, yeah you're my Lord) [x2]

[Verse 2]
When I stray I'm troubled faced with much struggle when I understand don't stay tryin to hustle
I'm easily discouraged, nothing seems to flourish, all week I'm weak no need to nourish
All sweets, all me, knowin him is costly he ain't lost me but I'm off beat and nervous but his word guards me from all things that hurt us
And when God leads I'm godly in service
It all seems right--1st Psalm leads it's perfect--we'll stand firm like palm trees to flourish. We've been delighting in this plan we gon' stay by Dad
In contrast the wicked man is blown away like chaff
Cuz' he thinks that on his own he can stay on the right path. But us we gotta trust if it's day and the night: grab this text
Yes we blessed to meditate on that. Dagger's wanting dudes to rust and fate away like grass..

[Chorus]
Life is hard, it's been a fight since the start
Only way to make It is
If Christ is my Lord
Teach me and lead me my life is yours
(Yeah you're my Lord, yeah you're my Lord) [x2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah Ay what a relief It is to be lead to read the sweet text and heed what he said
My Lord if it was left to me I'd be dead treading the wrong path I'm blessed to be on track
It's blessed to be on that, I Do more than eat bread, I live of every word from God like He said
My Lord makes no sense to follow flesh cuz his invents are always known to product best
Yeah you made me, and saved me, I'm not gon' stress, cause I been long, cause I love You and follow steps. When my father would rule I'm just following rules to win Him with no heart like a hollow chest
But pursue Him hear joy in my fathers steps being lead by your Spirit hearing "I'm So Blessed"
Cuz I feel If It here following my own lead I'd rather see it driven by Him man and follow heed..

[Chorus]
Life is hard, it's been a fight since the start
Only way to make It is
If Christ is my Lord
Teach me and lead me my life is yours
(Yeah you're my Lord, yeah you're my Lord) [x2]
