[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
We on the grind and we ain't goin' stop
Truth said, "We on Duty" like them plain clothes cops
Reignited in us fire, much flame, so hot
We was lame, dumb, slaves, we was plain robots
Ever since we been cleaned, not a stain, no spot
No blame, much gain, He remains on top
We surrendered our plans, our games, our plots
When His Spirit came down like some rain on crops
So times we get drained and your man straight flops
Our mission is hard to swallow like ya man drank scotch
Its strange I'm feeling strained like my veins goin' pop
But my brother said "your work is not in vain don't stop"
So I fall to my knees and I start praying
I labor over the scriptures just to see what God is saying
I'm reminded of the mission that he is giving can't stray off
Gotta work for Him no time to take a day off

[Hook: Trip Lee] (x2)
Gotta work (All Day)
Gotta labor (All Day)
We gotta get out in the field for the Savior (All Day)
So get busy (okay)
Gotta grind (okay)
No slacking we ain't got no time (Yes Sir)

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
You look around you can see why we grieve
Everywhere that we look everyone is deceived
Every block, every corner, man I really see needs
And I'm looking at the church and I don't really see deeds
