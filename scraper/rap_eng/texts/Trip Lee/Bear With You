[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Homie we all fallen, friendships ain't nothin' easy
I get done dirty often, my folks do something greezy
Feel my back on the wall and, I ask my Lord to free me
Cause yeah anger be callin, but I know my brothers need me
Gotta get low til I'm crawlin, try to get humble, see we
Notice each others flaws, but sometimes it's hard to see me
I do folk dirty too, sins that thing we sure to do
Jesus died to reconcile, now you gotta murder you
Die to self so much that you get convicted of murder too
Attacking me instead of them, something I must learn to do
Revenge I heard of you, no I ain't scared of you
Cause Jesus died to kill you in me, so I scrrr from you
Look I've been raised with Him, taken out them chains in Him
Tryin to put off anger, wrath, malice all them things in 'em
Put on meekness, kindness, patience every fight can't win 'em
Used to hold a grudge against them, lately I forgave 'em

[Hook: Trip Lee]
It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind
But I gotta keep the gospel in mind
Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine
I'm a bear with ya, I'm a bear with ya
It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind
But I gotta keep the gospel in mind
Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine
I'm a bear with ya, I'm a bear with ya
You already know to bear with 'em bro
You already know to bear with 'em bro
You already know to bear with 'em bro
You already know to bear with 'em bro

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
I know of two homies, one dude had borrowed paper
He took two hundred forty, he'd repay all of it later
He was trippin on em, was callin something major
And errbody knows can't do that when it comes to paper
He hit him on the phone, but he ignored the calls
Text message, e-mail, but he ignored it all
He saw him at the mall, It was a scary picture
He just dapped his homie up, like I'm a bear with ya
What about this married couple, been married 10 years
Before they tied tha knot, the husbands role had been clear
But then they life started, he seemed really sincere
But wrestled with laziness, been unemployed for six years
Was supposed to get a job, while she was out the house
But then she got home, he ain't got off the couch
Yea she was grieved a lot, got up in his face though
Like I'm a bear with ya baby cause tha King rose

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Life done been crumby, since I been walking a young'n
Call me different or funny, wish I could change it like money
Grew up off in the country, we're looking different and funny
Stupid head or just ugly, no matter what it kept coming
Askin' my momma where daddy, he ain't here to protect me
Teach me, raise me, or carry my load when it get heavy
So I did it on my own, fighting carrying on
It don't matter what they told me dawg, I thought I was grown
People tell me that I'm tripping, and I tell them they wrong
All the while I'm actin out, blaming my daddy who gone
Fast forward by 10, when God saved me from sin
And He changed my heart from dark to light to show to all men
And I got the conviction, call him up and stop tripping
That's when I found out he's a Christian who got saved in omission
That's when it goes past religion, and then it makes an incision
Into your heart and then you start forgiving, man and start building

[Hook]
