[Verse 1: V. Rose]
It's crazy, it's crazy
You have always been the one
That never left me
Never left me alone
You always loved me
Even when I was wrong
So Ima keep lifting you up
Cause up is just where you belong
Down here we got the palm trees
Many many many palm tree
Why they always throwing shade
So cold they got me wanting putting long sleeves
But I'm putting on the long sleeves
Cause I ain't gonna leave your love
And they can try to freeze me out
But they ain't gonna bring no doubt
No doubt nah nah
I know who I am
I know who you are
You're up when I'm down
Can't pull us apart
No matter what bad thing is happening you're looking after me
LOVE

[Pre-Hook]
I just love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
Your the only one that I trust, yeah
Your name is high places
Greater than the ones they be putting on
My praises
Skyscrapers
Hallelujah so we go all night long
Your grace is so amazing
Don't deserve it
But you give it
You give it all
Like oh my Jesus
Ain't no other gods up in this song

[Hook]
I love you so much
I love you so much
Yes sir
Yes sir
I just love you so much

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
You never left me
Even when I was wrong
So Ima keep lifting you up
Cause up is just where you belong
My heart had bondage in it
Pride and violence that I invented
Love was silenced and I admit it never showed til I repent it
It was love when he left his throne
He showed up and showed us the best I've know
Shoulders where loaded from mess unknown
I noticed the boat had rolled over
Could have mind blown
MIND BLOWN
He says that I can't stall
No time when I can't call
Can't nobody write my name off
He can keep me til my pain off
When I say I love you so much
Then don't do what you say
Must not love you that much
My covers they get in the way
We good, feel feed
But my love look dead
No love in my hands
No feet on my legs
I can't call it love when it stays in my hands

[Pre-Hook]
I just love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
Yes Sir
You're the only one I can trust (yeah)
Up is just where you belong
Your name is high places
Greater than the ones they be putting on
My praises
Skyscrapers
Hallelujah so we go all night long
Your grace is so amazing
Don't deserve it
But you give it
You give it all
Like oh my Jesus
Ain't no other Gods up in this song

[Hook]
I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
