[Verse 1]
I thought you already knew, bruh
Christ switched the rules up
Dudes were tripping when they got a glimpse of truth the
Moves that made was insane, His crew of
Disciples, would later write it in the Bible the news of
Jesus, the Word, but it seemed too absurd
The majestic, in flesh with those He breathed from the Earth
Now we've seen the Father clearer than we'd seen Him at first
In His Son, He's the one, it was seen in His works
The disciples had seen those days
He said peace be still and the sea obeyed I'm so amazed
They was attached to the King, ok
But now He's telling them that soon He'll have to relocate
Oh no, but that's no reason to grumble, complain
In His name because He'll send another one of the same
Another paraclete, comforter, advocate, teacher
The helper, the one we have to get to get Jesus
He's coming, it ain't like He ain't capable of nothing
He'll convict the world of sin righteousness and judgment
Plus there was much more to say, that He left out of the discussion
But left it for the one who was coming
Cause would guide them into truth, He would glorify the Christ
He'd reveal to them dudes, about the Lord who died for life
So they need not sleep on the divinity
Of God the 3rd person of the trinity, the Spirit

[Hook]
Behold the Spirit, He is One with our Maker
Don't sleep (Don't sleep), He's the way the men meet the Savior (He's God)
Behold the Spirit, He's eternal and everlasting
Don't sleep (Don't sleep), He's the way the men meet the Master (He's God)

[Verse 2]
Please let me speak on, person number 3 homes
The one up in the trinity that most people sleep on
But how could that be, you can't deny that they're one
He has the same divine attributes as the Father and Son
Many mistake His work and try say He ain't a person
That's crazy, sounds to me like it's some false teaching lurking
I'm assured that He's a person, don't stay asleep I'm burning
Inside to tell you bout His personality and workings
He's eternal, proceeding from the Father
He has no beginning, that's prolly cause He's God bruh
Hovers over the water, He worked within creation
He always been without flaw He is perfect and amazing
In the Old Testament, He was work at in God's people
In Moses for example, that's the man that He would speak through
And these dudes, Joshua, Gideon, and Samson
Who granted Him the great strength? Yes the Holy Phantom
Plus the prophets, who told cats the lamb would be coming
Did it by the Spirit, now here of the planned King's coming
He was conceived by the Spirit, anointed and filled
He was led by the Spirit, and each time that He healed
It was by Him, as well as Him resisting temptation
He did it all by the Spirit, not to mention His raising
Don't be a fool and sleep on the divinity
Of God the third person of the trinity

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
How does the Spirit work now? I could go on for days
But I'll just give you a little bit and speak on some ways
He came as Christ told, with new work on the Earth
In Acts 2 at Pentecost peep the birth of the church
The holy text that we read, was revealed by Him
God breathed, and we can see that it's real by Him
He illuminates it to, enables us to see
He's how you can say it's true, we enabled to believe
By His work, He regenerates though we depraved and thieves
He rebirths us, let's praise Him the slaves are freed
He's the Spirit of promise, He's the Spirit of truth
You've been delivered from bondage, you will experience fruit
He makes us want to seek Him, He leads us to Jesus
He teaches, plus He intercedes for believers
It seems that, hey most folks they are tripping
Cause His name's been marred by much emotionalism
The mark of His work isn't yelling and confusion
It's fruit like we see in the text, and it's through Him
Be content with His revealing, the Bible is closed
His revelation is sufficient so abide in the scroll
Many act crazy and and say it's Him, but hear this
If don't match His Word, then it's not of the Spirit
So be amazed and in awe of His divinity
He's God, the third person of the trinity, the Spirit

[Hook]
