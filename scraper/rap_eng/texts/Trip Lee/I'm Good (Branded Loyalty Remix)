[Intro: Trip Lee]
Yessir
Ya know I'm good right
Let's go Biz

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
I hear the troubles coming for me death is at my doorway
Fear says I'mma perish bro but that ain't what my Lord say
He said I ain't guilty though I still ain't have my court date
Tasted and I've seen Him even though it's just a foretaste
I don't know what they feeling I don't know what they thinking
But my soul's invincible like Mario when he blinking
They see me full of joy like "I don't know what he drinking?"
Cup is full of living water bro I sip it and thank Him
Yessir, might not win a Grammy or get another Stellar
But I get rewards from my Lord there ain't nothing better
I may not chart again, I may not sell a milli
But I've been purchased by my King, He's forever with me
So what they talking bout no they can't knock me down
Yessir I do feel pain but Jesus got me now
That's why I'm making noise that's why I'm running hard
That's why I go gorilla spitting them monkey bars

[Bridge: Lecrae]
Partner now you know I'm good to go
Pressure creates diamonds and fire refines the gold
Ain't nothing on this planet that satisfies my soul
I'm living for tomorrow today is out of control for sho

[Hook: Lecrae & Trip Lee]
I'm good, take all my money
I'm good, here come the pain
I'm good, ya they can kill me
I'm good, to die is gain
I'm good, I ain't saying (I'm good) that we don't feel any pain (I'm good)
I'm just saying (I'm good) you can't take us out the game (I'm good)
Cause homie we good

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I done been through the fire I survived all the floods
And them riders is with me they all covered in blood
Drag my name through the mud they can hate they can gossip
But my passion for Jesus they ain't never gon stop it
I was dead I guess that made me better than I ever was
Look at me I'm good partner I'm on my forever buzz
If everything I have is taken I can take it
They say I never make it I know the person who made it
My life is hidden in Him so when I die I gain
And Jesus really be walking with me so how I'm lame?
My life is full of pain problems and such
But I'm focused on forever in eternity's touch
While the world try to fight me Pharisees try to stone me
I am Tebow in the fourth quarter they can't hold me
Ya the Lord is my coach got me off in the zone
Tell my mama that I'm good when he carry me home

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trip Lee & Lecrae]
(Hey man we been beat down we been persecuted beat down and mocked but that ain't go'n stop us. No sir. We good. We know where our eternal resting place is at! Hey Trip talk to em man)
I know that I'mma suffer that will only make me tougher
Death is just a doorway to take me to my faithful lover
The lover of my soul is with me you can shake a brother
But you can never knock me down and take me under bring the thunder
Let the storms come to hunt us and hurt us
They can't take our Lord from us bro we got us a verdict not guilty, not guilty
He's with us and He stays present He never leaves me
He even gives me stage presence

[Bridge]

[Hook: Lecrae & Trip Lee]
I'm good, take all my money
I'm good, here come the pain
I'm good, ya they can kill me
I'm good, to die is gain
I'm good, I ain't saying (I'm good) that we don't feel any pain (I'm good)
I'm just saying you can't take us out the game
Cause homie we good
