[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Look I was born like the rest, from Adam's curse ruined
Straight born into death, with my back turned to Him
The facts are confusing, I'm a wretched man
But He took me, held my hand and my death was banned
He could have let my sins stay and my transgressions stand
But I've been selected, elected, predestined man
The question stands, look what I do to deserve
To be blessed with His plan, made new and reserved
Nothing, was like the rest, born attracted to death
Nah we ain't said it but its just what all our actions expressed
Cause though I ain't wanna bother with the Lord He spared me
When I needed a Father, like orphan Annie
He took me in, He clothed me in His righteousness
Fed me the fruit of the Spirit, now my life is His
Its all grace, I don't deserve this relationship
Cause I ain't got nothing to give even my faith was a gift

[Hook]
I don't deserve it, I'm worthless, but treated as perfect
Why me? (Why me?) Why me? (Why me?)
I sin more than I wanna, but my sins are a goner
Why me? (Why me?) Why me? (Why me?)
I was lost, but redeemed, then adopted and cleaned
Why me? (Why me?) Why me? (Why me?)
I was a scrub, but this God let me run with His squad
Why me? (Why me?) Why me? (Why me?)

[Verse 2: The Ambassador]
You can ask the question, why a God would let men
Take His Son, make Him a naked one just to crush Him
We could all inquire, why a God this high up
Would stoop so low, to scoop a whole, crew from holding fire
We can pontificate, sippin' on lemonade
Chillin' cause our bill of sin was long but dawg it was paid
Or we can shrug it off, not even bug at all
Off the fact, we should have been attached, to that rugged cross
That's just what it cost, I'm moved by what it cost
Refuse, to be like dudes, unmoved, with thuggish walks
They like to disregard this, they like to diss the God that's
Coming back, never to fade to black, like Mr. Carter
And it's a shame, cause the Scripture is plain
With you and me, Yahweh got beef like 50 and Game
We're shifty as Cain, only Jesus emptied His veins
So now you only got one choice out of a list full of names

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
It's truly His grace that did it all, His righteous mercy
Prepared beforehand for glory, nah I ain't worthy
He's treating Christ like me and He gave Him death
He's treating me like Christ man, He gave me breath
I could've easily been, one that's fiendin' for sin
That's leading me in, to death, and catch heat in the end
But He chose me, He showed me, ordered my steps man
What a privilege to be, one of the Lord's elect

[The Ambassador]
If it wasn't for you Trip I wouldn't be trippin' on this
Cause we'll get about as far as a car, sittin' on bricks
Cause why He did it, was (uh) Ah forget it
I don't know why, I ain't shy, I'll admit it
So Trip, I don't even question this, I go on and rest in this
For sin I was in Union but now I'm free like a Russian is
Now I trust in this (Jesus) now the lesson is
Run hard for God to a beat like a percussionist
