[Intro: Leah Smith & Trip Lee]
Oh oh, the light
We don’t know where we going (repeat)

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Aye, look around, it’s all dark, all black everything
Like the million man march, but I’m talking bout everything
Dark hearts, dark souls
Dark minds writing dark flows
Can I get a little light though?
Is that something I can fight for?
Hey we so blind we don’t know
On that highway we go
Go full speed ahead, flying but we low
But we don’t know just what he got in store, no more falling for the okie doke
Nope, he can give us sight for things we never saw before
'Till that light get to glowing, we don’t know where we going
But it ain’t no google map for life, and it’s like our headlights are broken
Proof: we flashing, passing on some treasure that’s golden
For some nickel and copper, trying to get glory that’s stolen
And reaping what we sowing
Hey we all got dreams, this is mine
I’m praying that he’ll flip that switch and shine, kids are blind
We know you got it, Lord we know you got it
Only you can take us higher, you the pilot
Lights please!

[Hook: Trip Lee]
We don’t know where we going
We so far from our home
We don’t know where we going
Blackout, no power’s on
We don’t know where we going
My homies gone, they need you to show them so turn them lights on
We don’t know where we going
We so far from our home
We don’t know where we going
Blackout, no power’s on
We don’t know where we going
Until we go where living water is flowing
So Turn them lights on

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
I was walking alone down a dark alley wish I coulda known
I was locked in a box with blinders blocking my sight of the throne
Was plotting on others instead of relying on God I was gone
But my mind it was blown, when He shined that light in my home
Taking off sleep mask, full speed with the seats back
Now I can drive head lights on, that steep cliff I see that
Detour, gotta turn around, young lady gotta turn her down
180, ain’t perfect now, but I press on and I get stronger
Dear Lord, our people lost you see the shooting, killing
Who let lucifer loose? We all are duped and willing
And he ain’t through concealing, glory from humans
We doomed to be in that tomb and walking to our execution
Man, thank you for dragging me out that dark room
Your truth pierced through my heart like harpoons, no cartoon
It’s a blackout, no light just black out
Please give them grace, I know you got more light to pass out

[Hook]
We don’t know where we going
We so far from our home
We don’t know where we going
Blackout, no power’s on
We don’t know where we going
My homies gone, they need you to show them so turn them lights on
We don’t know where we going
We so far from our home
We don’t know where we going
Blackout, no power’s on
We don’t know where we going
Until we go where living water is flowing so turn them lights on

[Outro: Leah Smith]
Can you turn the lights on?
Can you turn the lights on for me?
