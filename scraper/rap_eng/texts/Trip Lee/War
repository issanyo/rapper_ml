[Hook]
This is war, like you ain't seen
This winters long, it's cold and mean
Life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what gone happen
When life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what'll happen
It's war tonight
It's death and life

[Verse 1]
This the kinda war you ain't never seen ever
Soldiers getting racked, homies heads getting severed
Death tolls crazy like nothing on record
Civilians ain't safe later troops might get ya
Can't run ahead cause them guys going to catch up
They never gt tired never let up
They fired up ride up to put you on a stretcher
But is the good side tough enough? You bet ya
Yeah you got bad guys, you know they a problem
Trying to overthrow the king, yeah that's what we call him
No light for the dark nights, no Gotham
This ain’t fake death, no possum, can anybody stop them?
Tombstones everywhere, dead bodies rotting
Big Glock popping, bodies still dropping
But I ain’t gon’ cry though, for just to get swallowed
The Father’s sent his son, and the troops gon’ follow

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
(This is war, like you ain't seen
This winters long, it's cold and mean)
Life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what gone happen
When life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what'll happen
It's war tonight
It's death and life

[Verse 2]
The son came down to the wasteland
We in a death-filled mess, he’ll win, no leaving
No rest til death kills, the fight ain’t even
And death won’t be left still breathing, Get em
The son’s on the front line crossing their borders
Invading enemy land but they can’t floor them
A good troop will graze him, and they ain’t even force em
But God used that sin to support him
They captured the King next thing them shots rang out
General is down, the troops are like, “We out!”
The life-giver dies and the other side celebrates
But they don’t know that Hell is fate, the death they’ll face
They never safe if he’s a beast who does featherweight
Just when they thought they took him down he would elevate
Death could never take pride in that blow
Cuz the King beat death when he died and he rose

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It really might seem like the war’s still going
People still dying, sin is still potent
The devil’s still tempting, and evil ain’t slowing
Just wait until the trumpet gets blowing
The General is coming with keys in his hands
The death and haters they’ll, freeze where they stand
Cause see they’ve been defeated, please understand
If they don’t wanna see him, bro, the King is the man
He’s a man of war, a beast on the battlefield
Obliterating all the evil forces that’ll kill
Where’s your sting death? Oh, you don’t got it bro
Where’s your victory? Oh, you’ve been swallowed whole
But when he’s back, ain’t no fighting Jehovah
He’ll toss you in a lake of burning fire and sulfur
He’s a titan, a soldier who will wipe away tears and our fears
And all the pain and death will be over

[Outro: Natalie Lauren]
(This is war on sin and death
The dark will take its final breath)
Life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what gone happen
When life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what'll happen
When life and death go to battle
Ain't no telling what'll happen
It's war tonight
It's death and life
