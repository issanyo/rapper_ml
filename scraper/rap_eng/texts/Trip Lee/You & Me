[Verse 1]
You’ve been silent so long
I’m trying to hear a whisper I’m trying to hear a pin drop
You know I’ve feel broken  holdin' on for dear life
Praying that the storm stops

[Chorus]
Tell me are you with me now
Even in my ups and downs
I've been calling out, its you and me, is it you and me?
Tell me are you listening
I hang on every word you say
Help me hear ya loud It’s you and me, yeah its you and me

[Verse 2]
With one word I make galaxies
My voice is always echoing, why do you question me
Every night you go to pray
I hear you in the secret, no i have never let you be alone

[Chorus 2]
Tell me are you with me now
Even in our ups and downs
I hear you calling out
It's you and me, yeh it's you and me

Tell me are you listening
I hang on every word you say
Help me hear ya loud
It's you and me, yeah it's you and me

It's you and me, yeah it's you and me, eh

[Verse 3]
Is that you Lord? I need you strummin'
These heart strings to your tune Lord?
I need you coming through clear to make me joy new Lord
But these mute buttons keep you from me so it's too hard
You feel too far

But I better not blame the blameless God who’s up in the skies
When his voice seems faint
Cause he never slides or shifts to the side
Oh lala, I confess
You ain’t go mute, I went deaf
Oh lala, gotta try my best
To turn up truth and drown out mess, I know

[Chorus 3]
I can feel you with me now
Even in my unseen doubts
I hear ya calling out
It's you and me, yeh it's you and me

Always know you're listening
I hang on every word you say
Help me hear ya loud
It's you and me, yeh it's you and me
