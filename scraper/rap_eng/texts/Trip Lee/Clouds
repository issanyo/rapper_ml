Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Hey this is for all the dreamers)
Yessir

[Pre-Hook]
Woke up in the morning feeling like a million dollars
Hollering, "Can't nobody stop us, no lie"
I'm up
I'm dreaming 'bout the way I'm 'bout to conquer all the monsters in my way
I'm feeling like I'm on fire
I love, that feeling when you walking in your calling
Ain't no turning back I'm all in, I ain't finished, just watch
I’m up
Probably ain't no ceiling, don't be silly
Ain't no stealing what I'm in cause, homie this is my spot, my spot

[Hook]
Way up in the clouds like I'm on one (Way up, way up)
Way up in the clouds like I’m on (I'm on)
Way up in the clouds like I'm on one (Yessir)
Way up in the clouds like I’m on

[Verse 1]
Woke up from my sleep and I'm tired
No way I wanna get up, I'm leaving my eyes, like a safe
Then I think of my dreams and I'm wide, awake
It's like a light and a beacon inside of me
To be honest, last year was a blur
I had a dream, but it was deferred
I caught a beating, I'm eating the dirt
Wondering, "Will the dreams I'm seeking emerge?"
But that's the way dreams go
They hurt before they heal, if you ain't know
They take before they give, casinos
They kill before they live, I seen those
Desires that stay far and away, I seen those
Fires that's never catching a blaze, I seen those
But it's something in my soul
That can't stop running at 100 to the goal

[Hook]
Way up in the clouds like I'm on one
Way up in the clouds like I’m on (I'm on)
Way up in the clouds like I'm on one
Way up in the clouds like I’m on (I'm on)
Way up in the clouds like I'm on one
Way up in the clouds like I’m on (I'm on)
Way up in the clouds like I'm on one
Way up in the clouds like I’m on

[Verse 2]
Guess I need another plan
My other one is covered under sand
Buried like second day Son of Man
I don't understand
Another dream is deferred, and it's a nightmare now
I thought it was destiny, I got fear now
Piecing what's left together, I ain't clear now
No peace in this mess, from Him I gotta hear now, hear now
Cause man, I don't know what's even coming from the sky no more
And what's coming from inside, oh no
Cause I don't feel like I can fly no more
But I can't forget the motto, motto
No more mediocre, just getting by though
I'm in His image, I been down for a minute
But I'm getting up today, and I'ma fight till I'm finished

Way up in the clouds like I’m on
