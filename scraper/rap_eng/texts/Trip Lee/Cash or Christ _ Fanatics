Forget about the cash, in God we trust

Verse 1:
Most are concerned with the cheddar flow, but dawg I gotta let them know
A lot of reasons we should be seeking Jesus instead of dough
Instead of mo material things, the jewelry and fame
I speak of the King, but most ain't feeling me main
They would rather let they money stack, trying to get a hundred stack
They pockets fat, but they not ready when Christ is coming back
If they only knew the real truth about the coming wrath
They would probably race to Him faster than a running back
I know the things the cheddar buys, will attract and catch the eyes
Instead of ice, it'd be nice, if we would invest in life
Instead of all that flashy stuff, trying to get our status up
His wrath is just, so if we don't seek Him dawg then we out of luck
What good is it to gain the world and in the end lose your soul?
Its foolish bro, there's a loving Savior you can truly know
I know you seeking satisfaction, you can't find it though
Trying to dash for the cash and designer clothes

Hook:
Forget about the cash, Forget about the clothes
Forget about the stash, Forget about the dough
Forget about the cars, Forget about the rims
Forget about the stars, Forget about the benz
Forget about the big crib, trying to get rich, the big 64 plenty dough and trying to sip chrys
Forget the cash and chains, that stuff will pass away
And you can't take it with you to your after days

Verse 2:
Got money, got whips, got ice
Still broke homeboy! No Christ
Got a debt to pay, some real heavy wages
And the payment for his sin is pretty outrageous
I seen him park the car, suicide doors
Without Christ he walking through a suicide door
The dollar bill say in God we trust
Its funny cause money is the only god we trust
She say that she a Christian, but I can't tell
She ain't depending on God, she depend on mail
1 stack, 2 stack, 3 stack, 4
They spent they whole life stacking up dough
And when they die not a dimes gon go
Now they physically rich, but they spiritually poor
And they probably never heard of 1 Corinthians chapter 4
Cause they said they can't imagine God's people being poor

I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, I rep Christ til I D-I-E
I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith
I serve a God who is extremely great, I'm fanatic

Verse 3:
You can't serve God and cash, can't love the world and Christ
Put the money out ya mind, focus on eternal life
I can't speak from experience, I ain't seen it but I'm betting
Treasures of this world ain't nothing next to the ones that's up in Heaven
Feel free to store them up, since we found the Lord is just
Amazing let us praise Him main and try to give Him more of us
Let us live our lives with Him, spend our days and nights with Him
Ignore the trash the world has to offer and delight in Him
