They amazed at how we living for Him bro, they tripping when we show
That He's so superior that's why we pick Him over dough
We don't need anything in addition to Him bro
He's sufficient for us Christians if you with Him then you know
That's why we hedonists, you need to listen to the flow
On top of the beat and rhythm, we forgiven so we go
In pursuit of He who's risen the beginning of it bro
He's the gem the streets are missing but we get Him that's fa sho
That's too great, we too glad to have Him
The true facts, dude that's true satisfaction
Dudes ask, why you chase Christ instead of status?
Because He's steady plus what I'm getting is everlasting
We used to chase after dimes, that was great they was fine
In the face, in the waist, the mistake we was trying
To find true pleasure minus faith in the divine
We was lying to ourselves, now we chasing the vine

Them cats they try to gain but they won't be
Satisfied with the gain that they gon see
Them cats should try to seek Him cause I know the Lord
Satisfies beyond anything we'd hope for

The motto of the culture is touch me and tease me, rush to the easy
Things that seem pleasing like lust and the breezies
Seek the plush, eat it up, I would feed me
But it wasn't much plus it would flee me
So I changed what I was chasing it switched from chicks
To the King He replaced em
Now I hit the script to embrace Him I'm changing
Sins seem less appealing when I get the real thing
I race to erase them
Forget about the cash, not simply because not a cent of it will last
But its missing what He has
It's trivial if its mission isn't living with my dad
Getting intimate with Him living for Him instead of trash
Now I'm driven by the fact as I strive to win
That He's glorified in me when I'm satisfied in Him
If I miss it then that's wack keep my eyes on Him
And I get it on the track I run hard to Him

Them cats they try to gain but they won't be
Satisfied with the gain that they gon see
Them cats should try to seek Him cause I know the Lord
Satisfies beyond anything we'd hope for

Now my life is the pursuit, of delighting in His truth
In His person, His works yeah I'm fighting for this fruit
Of His light in my life its me striving to be like Him
Remember Him like the Titans, I'm dying to be renewed
Don't get it twisted like I am the reason to
Run forward to the throne, no the lion is in my view
He's shown to be glorious, when shown to be more to us
Than anything in sight pray our idols will be removed
It doesn't show the Lord's beauty, when I treat Him as duty
A God who doesn't truly, inside please or move me
So I reach for the truth He's my God a precious ruby
More entertaining than movies, greater than chasing hoochies
And when I forget I gotta take in the view we
Dive in His Word just to gaze at His beauty
And I really hope guys get the picture
True satisfactions in the God of the scriptures

Them cats they try to gain but they won't be
Satisfied with the gain that they gon see
Them cats should try to seek Him cause I know the Lord
Satisfies beyond anything we'd hope for

Say I'm a hedonist I seek my pleasure
Not in sex nope He's much better
Not in wealth nah He's my treasure
Pursuing anything else will just upset you
Say I'm a hedonist I seek my pleasure
Not in sex nope He's much better
Not in wealth nah He's my treasure
My King offers me satisfaction beyond measure
