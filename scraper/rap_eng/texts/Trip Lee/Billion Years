[Hook: Taylor Hill & Trip Lee]
A billion years ahead
This old world will be nothing
There's a joy that is coming like the morning
And nothing that we left
Will compare to this new song
Hearts united in freedom
And it sounds like
(Repeat oh's)
Will compare to this new song
Hearts united in freedom


[Verse 1]
Yessuh
On my way home
My rear view mirror's ripped off
On my way home
Hey why look back? Let's lift off
On my way home
No reminiscing, I will not bother
On my way home
Don’t dwell on the past unless it's Golgotha
Let's go!
My life ain't field skipping, come field tripping if you don't believe me
My life is a war zone
No meal ticket, nothing coming easy
I got a lotta bad burns
I got a few stab wounds
Bullet holes in my Air 1's
I'll be done with all that soon
Yeah, I lost a few loved ones
I enjoyed a lotta good times
Feet tired from the journey
But my heart's new that's a good sign
Oh no
Won't be stopping my pilgrimage uptown
Oh no
I'm headed way way too high up to come down
Somebody told me
I ain't gotta pack no lights, it stay lit
Somebody told me
Ain't no joy that I want that I can't get
Life as we know it will change
I'm in there with my gang
To be with the lamb who was slain

[Half Hook: Taylor Hill]
A billion years ahead
This old world will be nothing
There's a joy that is coming like the morning
And nothing that we left
Will compare to this new song
Hearts united with freedom
And it sounds like

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Ah we out here mobbing we do things
Violent and vicious, grew fangs
Wildin and wicked, fools man
We at the top of the food chain
Cannabilizing our crews, daily it's dudes slain
Murderous thinking ain't new
If you don't think it's true ask my dude, Cain
Tell me how civilized is a world where the killer thrives
Darker victims villainized, and authority's ill advised
The snake and his venom is all in us, no immunize
We need a Jonah we Ninevized, then arrives
The Lion of Judah, He came
The Son set down in our world, and still He reigned
Our infatuation with killing extended to Him He was slain
All that He made will get this redemption, it's finally reclaimed, we'll sing
Somebody told me, I won't need a shoulder to weep on, no more tears
Somebody told me, I ain't gotta hold no heat ain't no mo fears
Life as we know it will change
Don't need no pills ain't no pain
Ain't no successor forever He reigns

[Hook: Taylor Hill]
A billion years ahead
This old world will be nothing
There's a joy that is coming like the morning
And nothing that we left
Will compare to this new song
Hearts united in freedom
And it sounds like oooooh
(Repeat oh's)
Will compare to this new song
Hearts united in freedom
