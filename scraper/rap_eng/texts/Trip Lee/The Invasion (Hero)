[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Creation's groaning
Lost their hope and feel they always closed in
Lots to cope with, on the ropes
Wish they was in the open
This broken world is so dim
Our souls are searching,groping
For one with hope,to hold us close
And set goodness in motion
I remember growing up in Dallas
I thought me and my close kin
Was more than straight,our folks was great
Not broke,that paper flowed
Not boasting man,just saying in my brain I didn't know then
That all went wrong
And it just can't go right like a broke pen
My mind was blind and cloaked in
Then that foolishness departed
I saw this thing's an ocean
And we just tryna swim real far
But can't nobody float
When we ain't got boats or no fins
We need a hero to go in cause our solutions don't win
Education can't fix it
More dough just leads to more sin
Medicine is temporary,government seems so thin
With all these weighty problems that ain't shrinking they just growing
Who's adequate to save us?
How about He knew no sin?

[Hook: Jai]
Like a G5 yeah you rushed to rescue me
Took a cross in exchange for a throne to save me
You began the work and I know you'll finish
And make all things right when you come back
Cause you're my hero,you already saved the day
Cause you're my hero,and I know you're coming back for me

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Follow the steps bro
Adam sinned now we all dead so
We gotta sentence on our head
Like death row everything is wrecked
All creation is a mess bro
In the fullness of time in steps the hero no red cloak
He's Jesus
No flashing lights glitz n glam
And no cameras
He came to serve needy folks
And point them to the answer
You see Him healing feeding folks
And telling them the standard
Our most basic need is to be ransomed by Jesus
It has first place,yeah we separated in the worst ways
Even physically peep how the earthquakes
Separated socially murder
And the worst rapes
Even separated from ourselves we in the worst state
It's so major,that's the reason that we need a Savior
Cause the root of needs is separation from Creator
Jesus came humbly to restore us to our maker
And later He'll restore all that He made bruh
He's Jesus

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
God is not pleased man
It's clear that His standards missed
The world is running rampant with sin,it's an abandonment
Man is feeling stranded,feeling hopeless since his banishment
God is angry at the distortion and the mismanagement
Evil is at work but don't be thinking
He can't handle it
He promised He would do away with all of it,dismantle it
He's put up with this damage in
His world but He's promised us
That He'll destroy all His enemies
And then He'll walk with us
New Heaven new Earth
That's where all His sheep dwell
Cause Jesus succeeded in every part of life that we failed
Died the death we couldn't die
Paid our price with 3 nails
Began the work He promised in the end we all will be well
Already beat our enemies
And when His Kingdom's realized
All those who oppose Him will see Jesus with some real eyes
Deliverance is offered us
The hero He is urging us
Salvation is exclusive to His people who have turned to trust

[Hook]
