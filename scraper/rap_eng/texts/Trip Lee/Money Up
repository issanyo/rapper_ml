[Pre-Hook]
Soon as I get paid
Yeah, we gon' have it made
I put that on everything
I swear, I swear
Soon as I get paid
I'ma flip it two ways
And everything gon' change
I swear, I swear

[Hook]
When I get my money up, when I get my money up
When I get my money up, when I get my money up
Everything will change

[Verse 1]
I dream of a day when all my guap stacks
My crew ride through with all our tops back
Slide through, buy shoes, no problem cop that
Pay my dues 'til I got that
Childhood wasn't pretty, they give me no love
On the block like I'm Timmy, just tryna post up
Tryna get plenty pennies when I grow up
"Don't nobody make it out of here," they told us
I seen rappers end up in the news
Trappers look fresh down to the tennis shoes
I'm like, "everything they got I want it too
Somebody just tell me what to do"
I started from the bottom, still here
I been tryna rise, something always interfere
But I'ma get this money, get it clear
Then I'ma watch my problems disappear

[Hook]
When I get my money up, when I get my money up
When I get my money up, when I get my money up
When I get my money up, when I get my money up
When I get my money up, when I get my money up
Everything will change

[Verse 2]
Look I finally got that deal that I dreamed of
Big advance in my hands, got my G's up
Got my cheese up, never will I be grey
Got a lake full of money, call it Green Bay
Some are fake acting funny caught I got rich
Need a break from these brokers giving stock tips
Some will take what you get if you don't watch it
But they won't kill my high, I'm in this cockpit
Got expensive taste for cheap thrills
I'm humble, but I'm rich, got a "meek mill"
Might give a girl a ride, call it â€œfree will"
But never take her home twice that's a "refill"
Yeah, it's sweet deal, but I gotta say
If I was rich at Jay, I'd buy a plane and fly away
And soar above lames coming for my cash
Can't wait to upgrade to the mogul class
Wait for me

[Pre-Hook]
(Wait for me, w-wait w-wait for me, w-wait w-wait for me)
Soon as I get paid
Yeah, we gon' have it made
I put that on everything
I swear, I swear
Soon as I get paid
I'ma flip it two ways
And everything gon' change
I swear, I swear

[Hook]
When I get my money up, when I get my money up
When I get my money up, when I get my money up
Everything will change

[Verse 3]
I got a house on a hill
A couple bad broads, and a spouse with me still
More money than I count, what a deal
And I really can't describe how I feel
They say I got it all
But I ain't really satisfied, pockets could be fatter, got desires I ain't gratify
I got it all
Yeah I climbed the ladder, I be tired of paparazzi
But at least they give me alibis
All the dollars in my wallet finna burst through
Mo money, mo problems to work through
Something's missing, that feeling's starting to lurk too
But I got it all so I don't know what to pursue
'Cause I finally got paid (finally got paid)
