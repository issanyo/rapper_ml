[Intro]
Ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus muzik

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah, back on the grind again
I know it’s been a little while, but it’s time again
Folks askin', "'Crae, when you gon' rhyme again?"
I’m like, "Hold up, give me time, my man"
See a lot of things change, some stay the same
Went from H-Town to D-Town to Memphis, man
One thing is for sure, everywhere I go
People caught up in their self, money, cars, and clothes, yeah
They talk about it all the time and put it in they songs
They drive around and play it loud like it ain’t nothin’ wrong
And all they talk about is sinful stuff
Got everybody actin' bad, thinkin' that they a thug
And they tryna drown me out
But, nah, they ain’t gon' count me out
I got a back pack full of tracts, plus I keep a Johnny Mac so we can pound it out
Plus I’m bumpin' these Jesus beats
Whenever they seein' me
People lookin' all confused 'cause every one of my tunes is screamin' Jesus peeps
I was bumpin' that Trip Lee
BJ rollin' with me
Both our heads noddin' like we dozin' or we tipsy
But we ain’t been drinkin', man
Nah, this song just bangin', man
Got us screamin' Jesus out the window
While we changin' lanes
While we just—

Ridin', ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus muzik
Ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus—
Ridin', ridin' with my top down, down
Top, top down
Ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus muzik
Ridin', ridin' with my top—
Ridin', ridin' with my top down
Ridin' with my top down, down
Jesus, Jesus muzik
Ridin' with my top—
Ridin', ridin' with my top down
Ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus muzik

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Yeah, if you hear that the bass bang, and you see us in your streets
That stuff your boy’s playin', man, it’s gon' be them Jesus beats
That stuff we bumpin' ain’t that lean with it, rock with it
It’s that change your life and please let the Rock hear
All the stuff that we bump, hear the sound of Christ
Romans 1:16; our prayer to Christ
Once lost, then found, but we down with Christ
In the start, hearts dark, but we found the light
Now it’s soundin' right
So it’s all to the good
We done found new life, 'cause the Gospel is good
In the past, I don’t think y'all understood
Now y'all done messed up, let us all in your hood
We got the windows down, and when we finna cruise
We tryna glorify the Lord with what we listen to
We bump that Cross Movement
We bump that Lamp Mode
We 'bout that Jesus music
Get up yo' hands, bro
It might be screwed and chopped
It might be East coast
Either way, this Jesus muzik's hot
Bump this in your speakers, bro
The Lord ain’t pleased with that money and weed
So if you hear them subs, and you see us up in your streets
I might be—

Ridin', ridin', ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus muzik
Ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus—
Ridin', ridin' with my top down, down
Top, top down
Ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus muzik
Ridin', ridin' with my top—
Ridin', ridin' with my top down
Ridin' with my top down, down
Jesus, Jesus muzik
Ridin', with my top—
Ridin', ridin' with my top down
Ridin' with my top down listenin' to this Jesus muzik

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
You like music from rap to gospel
But you prolly never heard nobody rap the Gospel
Different sound, but the Truth’s the same
With no choirs, no bands, but the Truth remains
We got fam and the clique, set the booth aflame
St. Louis up to Philly, like Duce and FLAME
If you lost in the flow, don’t lose the name
It’s Jesus Christ, the King of the Jews, my man
This ain’t entertainment, dog, it’s timeless Truth
Would you rather hear a song about shiny coupes?
Nope
Non-fat, non-gat, non-killa rap
A hundred percent Christ, the blood, spill-a-rap
Y'all feelin' that?
Rap wrapped up with the Gospel Truth, aye Trip, yo, reel it back
Y'all feelin' that?
Rap wrapped up with the Gospel Truth, aye Trip, dog, reel it back

[Verse 4: Trip Lee]
Yeah, if in our car you hear that boom-bap
And you hear some dudes rap
It ain’t them folks that boast, it’s folks that tell you where the Truth’s at
We don’t wanna hear about dimes and dope
We don’t wanna hear about knives and smoke
We don’t wanna hear about movin' packs and foolish cats who lie and boast
We do wanna hear about Christ, the King
Do wanna hear how lives have changed
We do wanna hear how God is pleased and theology out the Bible, man
This Jesus muzik turn heads, so turn it up and let 'em know
In all we do, He’s first, and this Jesus muzik’s better, bro, yeah
