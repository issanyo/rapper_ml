Sometimes I sit and reflect on the life I'm leadin
It's goin so fast it is like I'm speedin
Sometimes I wake up and it's like I'm dreamin
Already 22? 16 was last weekend
Been a crazy year, dad died I'm grievin
Man I really miss him, I wish he was still breathin
Two days later got a wife I'm cleavin
Couple weddin pics caught your boy straight cheezin
Now tell me how I'm 'pposed to fight, can your boy stay firm?
In this life when the joys and the pains take turns
You're at work in our world where some things they burn
You're not honoured when your boy can't learn
How I must respond to Your works and the cards that You deal me
Aware of my frailty I'm beggin You to help me
How can I be a steward actin' healthy
I know Your grace won't fail me

All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along
And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done
All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along
And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done

You placed me in the city that I'm in for a reason
Sent folks in my life that was friends for a season
Some exposed my flaws and my sin it wasn't pleasin
And others fell from the faith n was leavin
If I respond wrong I'm dishonorin' Your grace
And I'm kind of just a product of my mind and not the faith
But You are my Father the refiner full of grace
And You're the designer of my time and in my place
I could take the easy route and follow all the trends
Of my brothers and my sisters, pastors and my friends
It probably wouldn't lead to a disaster in the end
But I can't be followin the path You givin them
Yup, you made me me, with my own set of gifts
So I won't settle for less You bless You never miss miss
I'll be steward who You made me, steward where You place me
And I pray that You use me like crazy

All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along
And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done
All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along
And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done

You send the sun and the rain on Your servant Lord
Lord when You send them my way, I be respondin right way
You move and orchestrate the things in my life for good
I wanna use em in a way that shows em how Your grace acts
You been consistent every minute like I knew You would
I'm so in love with Your truths, I wanna trust You and move
I feel my confidence is high, Your providence for You I'm good good good
I've got no worries at all since I heard that You call

All of my life is Yours to own (It's Yours to own Lord), You orchestrate it all along (all along)
And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done (yea)
All of my life is Yours to own (it's all Yours), You orchestrate it all along (it's all Yours)
And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done
All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along
And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done
All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along
And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done

So the whole world, so the whole world, so the whole world can see what You've done
So the whole world, so the whole world, so the whole world can see what You've done
