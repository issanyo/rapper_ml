[Intro: Trip Lee]
Yeah, hey I wonder if there's anybody else
Who's 'bout ready to go home

[Hook: Jimmy Needham]
I just wanna go where
I'm only breathing Your air
Father, hear my prayer, take me there
Take me there
I just wanna see You
Brighter than I'm used to
Finally see You clear, take me there
Take me there, take me there

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Tell me, have you ever seen a
Brother so weighted you can tell by his demeanor
That he's really jaded, tryna get off this serena
He long for something greater but they say he just a dreamer
But he has a treasure that he holds like gold
Cause he knows something that the boys don't know
Nothing seems funny when his money's so low
But when he thinks about that place, man he really wants to go
That he ain't all obsessed with the cash he can stack
Cause he's lookin' to the Heavens where His master is at
But he does have treasure and he's storin' it up
Seems foreign to us, it can't be stolen or rust
So when the cares of this world start weighin' on him hard
And he's tired of them bills he's been payin' on his car
He can't wait to be embraced by the Lord, face to face
So he waits for his reward, and he sings

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Tell me, have you ever seen her
She's sick with a disease and it's really tryna beat her
It's takin' all her strength, she know that it can't defeat her
Cause she gon' be with Jesus, she's more than just a dreamer
Her peace and her joy, man they really ain't gone
It's all because she knows earth really ain't home
And even when she's by herself she's really not alone
Her Savior's there with her while she singin' this song
She know sickness might get her and death might grab her
But she ain't scared of death cause she's trusted in the Master
Was buried but He rose up a few days after
So death may attack her but death cannot have her
So she tells her family "Don't worry anymore"
When she's gone from the body she'll be present with the Lord
Her body will be raised, so much Glory is in store
He is her reward so she sings

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
Hey, I ain't know about you but I can't wait till the day
When I'll be with my Lord and everything is ok
And I'll be just like Him, so my sin ain't in the way
Baskin' in His glory, that's where I wanna stay
A place where shadows give way to the real
And circumstances can't change the way that I feel
Joy of my Savior, that Satan can't steal
Because he's been defeated, yeah you know the deal
The real good life, I can't wait, please save me soon
Untill then I'll be praisin' in the waitin' room
Fightin' by His grace, can't wait to embrace the groom
Until then I'm like

[Hook]
