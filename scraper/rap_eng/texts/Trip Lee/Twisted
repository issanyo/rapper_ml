[Intro: Trip Lee]
Do not be deceived my beloved brothers
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above
Coming down from the Father of Lights
Don't get it twisted man

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
It's Wayne Gretzky on his neck piece
Got 'em feeling real hefty on his best week
But let's see, he say he make it rain
But yet the sky's still bluer than a gas flame
I mean let's make it plain, somebody keep 'em breathin'
Keep his blood flowin', and keep his heart beatin'
God keep em eatin', and it ain't no secret
Don't get it twisted God gave him what he needed
My life ain't never been mine
Yeah I work hard and yeah I grind
But not to get rich man, not to shine (What)
Not to get rich man, not to shine (OK)
And I don't boast much I don't brag
Cause everything I got man, I got it from dad
And matter fact ain't one thing I have
That God ain't put here in my hand
So I say remember that your legs work cause of Him
Next time you running for your goals
Think who's really running it
Everything is under Him: planets, countries, cities, hoods
Don't get it twisted God did it, done it, got it? Good

[Hook: Derek Minor, Lecrae]
Say they fly, but that's a lie
Man they got it twisted
Rings are gold, crispy clothes
Man they got it twisted
I bet you think you a god but boy you got it twisted, tw-tw-twisted, tw-tw-twisted
Get a little bit a money stack a little bit a chedda then we get the game so twisted
20-sum inches on a little bit a leather then we get get things so twisted
I bet you think you so hard but boy you got it twisted, tw-tw-twisted, tw-tw-twisted

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Yes sir, back on that thang
Reflectin on life an it's happiness mayne
Since I was born I had what I needed
When I think back ain't been lackin a thang
Clothes I got, soda pop
The home I got, the cash in the bank
The bros I got, the shows I rock
None of us lacked it was passed from the King
So many things was on to us
We holdin up on some dough for lunch
And I'd say my grace and then get with the game
Never really thought of his mercy flows
Never really heard the words before
Every good thing is comin' down
From the Father of Lights like a passionate rain
Yeah tell them to get back
Yeah how they think they get that
My Father gave me gift wrap
Though He don't have to give jack
We ain't earned a single thing
Oh homie, don't miss that
He gives because he's merciful now spit that
Don't get it twisted
Hey yeah some of us are strugglin'
They off in hoods
But still get mo' than they deserve
Look all he He does is good
He gives freely and He's perfect in His distribution
Look, don't get it screwed up like you live in (Houston)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: This'l]
Some things that I think are good in life, they make me nervous
Anything my Father give me though, I know it's perfect
Anything I get besides my death I don't deserve it
Used to think that I was good to have cash splurging
I was a trap star, sixteen, phat car
Anything that made me feel good was good, that far
Kept them bangers with me like I'm good, gon' act hard
Even kept that Green Bay too, yeah Brett Favre
See my whole thought of good was out of context
Didn't know what good was cause I hadn't seen the Son yet
Ran around with different girls like it was a contest
Young and dumb, foolish too, I was on some nonsense
Thought I was good, that the whole hood heard of me
They thought it was good that other hoods want to murder me
Somebody call the cops cause it's an emergency
Now I know what good is - it's God's love and mercy

[Hook]
