There is a young girl
Up in her teenage years
Up in the world thriving with teenage peers
She's popular
But there is one thing to be made clear
Low self esteem was the reason for her teenage tears
She thought she wasn't pretty enough
Or cool as the next chick
Wasn't skinny enough
So dudes she would mess with
So they would be chillin with her
And she'd feel accepted
And in the end what up she still get rejected
She couldn't really see seeking the Lord
But thought she could find peace
In an eating disorder
Everytime she loose 10
And said just 10 more
But her friends all confused
Like what you doing this for huh
Started to cling to this foolish disorder
Figured it's all she had
If the students ignored her

Dag I'm praying for my sister
That she would cling to the God
That can save and deliver
I'm praying for my sister
That she would cling to the God
That can save and deliver
True security is found in Christ
He will never leave you
He's down and around for life
I'm praying for my sister
That she would cling to the God
That can save and deliver
True security is found in Christ
He will never leave you
He's down and around for life

There's a young dude up in his teenage years
Huggin a black grafitter
With his teenage peers
He still does it
One thing to be made clear
Not be the down with the rest
Is his Teenage fears
And where he come from
Selling work ain't that crazy
It's few kats his age that ain't had babies
All he wants to do lay around
And hang out crazy
Maybe smoke something drank
Got his vision hazy
Plus he just got the new Jeezy cd
Wanna be like the D boys he see on TV
Heard of church but ain't got a suit that's 3 piece
So he think that it just ain't for him
Some girls down the block
Want a date from him
A decade down the road his baby will be ten
He'll be locked up

I am praying for my brother
That he would cling to God
That can save when we suffer
I am praying for my brother
That he would cling to God
That can save when we suffer
True Security is found in Christ
He will never leave you
He is down and around for life
I am praying for my brother
That he would cling to God
That can save when we suffer
True Security is found in Christ
He will never leave you
He is down and around for life

Another young one up in they teenage years
Put on a pedestal
Above all they teenage peers
Father's a Pastor
One thing he made clear we serve Christ
But daddy couldn't see their tears
See they felt insufficient
Like they could not match up to dad
No matter how much good they stacked
Like they was failing
Every single test they faced
And felt like satan next to their expectations
Suicidal thoughts went through their brain
They dreams of killing myself
Didn't realize Christ is perfect in our weakness
So they tried to hide it
Like they life was sweetness
Frontin in front of fam even quotin scripture
Just couldn't understand
He who wrote the scripture

Dag I am praying for my Family
That we would realize he died
So guys would have a plan b
I am praying for my sisters
That they would cling to the God
Who can save and deliver
True Security is found in Christ
He will never leave you
He is down and around for life
I am praying for my brothers
That he would cling to God
That can save when we suffer
True Security is found in Christ
He will never leave you
He is down and around for life
I am praying for my Family
That we would realize he died
So guys would have a plan b
True Security is found in Christ
He will never leave you
He is down and around for life
Yeah I'm praying for my family
That we would realize
That he died so guys would have a plan b
True security is found in Christ
He will never leave you
He is down and around for life

(Spoken)
Yeah True Security is found in Christ
You don't have to search for it in ourselves
Or in that dude or in that female
Or acceptance from men
True security is found in Jesus Christ
The only place to find it
Praise the Lord that he died
And we can come to him
Find our security in him
Find our everything in him
Only in Christ
