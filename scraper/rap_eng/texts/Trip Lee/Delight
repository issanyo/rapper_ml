[Verse 1 - God's Servant]
Yo how much more will I get low?
Frozen and get cold
Heart doesn't start like the meter's on zero
Tricking myself I'm not all I appear so
Rescue my heart Lord, come be my hero
Make me to get shook, tremble with fear yo
Spirit disturb me, come let the tears flow
Yo, it's insanity, coveting vanity, chasing the breeze, can't capture the air though
To know You and love You
That's what I'm here for
Be my delight Lord as long as my years go
Craving for things how quickly, I veer
To wasting my time on what's only for here
How is it movies and leisurely deeds
Excite my affections so easy it seems
My soul needs Your touch to the deepest degree
So You'll be my Delight like I need You to be

[Hook - Melissa T] (x9)
Would you be my Delight? (yessir)

[Verse 2 - Trip Lee]
Lord, You know my heart better than I do
So when I say it's weak/ it don't surprise You
I don't yearn like I should to be beside You
Instead of soaking in Your Word I'd rather fly through
Why?
It's not because You're not amazing
It's not like you ain't staging out in Your invasion
Coming down to enemy ground when it was flagrant
Or creating earth when our universe was vacant
The truth is
My heart's too slow
To gravitate towards the true lover of my soul
Cause I'll accept trash while turning away gold
But I got a new heart
That I'm begging You to mold
Cause you died for my pride and my stiff neck
You gave the lies that's inside of me the kiss of death
Yes, one day you'll be in my sights
Until then so you'll be my Delight

[Hook - Melissa T] (x9)
Would you be my Delight?

[Verse 3 - God's Servant]
What can I call this?
But contradiction
Say that I love you
But lack in conviction
Nothing to give Him
Nothing to bleed with
Nothing to offer You
That You'd receive it
But there is hope cause I know who my Priest is
He intercedes and He pleads for my weakness
I picture that He replies of me often -- "I'll make him to love me because I have bought him!"
And make it to be, I fail when it's me
But there's grace and there's mercy to help with my need
The Spirit provides us a well and a spring
Send revival like fire to melt unbelief
Your Word and Your church
Your means to ignite
The spark of the heart for our chief appetite
I know of Your power
And plead by Your might
That you Lord Jesus would be my delight!

Would you be my Delight?
