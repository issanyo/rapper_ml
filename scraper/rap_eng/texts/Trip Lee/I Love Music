Hey I came up in a crib where music played non-stop
From the night till the day we're in them same loud spots
Before I heard o' Nas and Jay I would say my pops
He used to play all my saints and marvin gaye up top
Some have to wait Isley brothers heard the way they rock
Earth Wind and fire man you can't say that they not hot
So I take from my dad more than the name I got
But my love for music I would gladly take my lot
I remember rockin out some mj always
Had me moon walkin in my socks in the halways
Playin tapes in my walkman all day
The good days lil will is what they call me
And everything I loved I had to try to do it
I tried to play some sports but I fell in love with music
Plus that love stayed and that love grew deeper
It wasn't goin' nowhere either

I love to hear the kick hit, love to hear the snare pop, love to hear them hi-hats play
I love music much more than I can say, I love music I was just designed that way
I love to hear the violin, love to hear the keystroke, love to hear trumpet play
Thank God for music, ain't much more that I can say, thank God for music, thank God for music

Eh, I discovered hip hop and I was never the same
I got my first CD still remember the name
Started to bump Jay-Z he was ahead of the game
Me and my boys bumped it all the time it's regular thangs
I remember middle school we used to write them rhymes
Shout out to K, Rock and Nick we used to write them lines
Was talkin foolishness I used to swipe dem dimes
I used to look back at mine like "I was tight this time"
I got serious about it tryna make that heat
Recordin in my room and Leak he used to make me beats
When times is hard, my first love had made things sweet
I had dreams of goin platinum tryna take things deep
But then a light came on, I changed my mind to anon
The trick was tryna find a way to take the whole game on
I saw that it was bigger than just tryna put my name on (why?)
Jesus is supreme and that's what I wanna display homes

I love to hear the kick hit, love to hear the snare pop, love to hear them hi-hats play
I love music much more than I can say, I love music I was just designed that way
I love to hear the violin, love to hear the keystroke, love to hear trumpet play
Thank God for music, ain't much more that I can say, thank God for music, thank God for music

Back in the day when I was young I went from rich 'n to poor
Fell in love with music poppin n breakin on floors
Figured i would bust some flows instead of breakin my bones
Thinkin like i moved the crowd in my mirrors at home
Within the cipher zone i found that i could hold my own
Had dreams of blazin up the joint like cheech and chong
I'ma be a rap star when I grow up
Light a match to my gods head I'ma blow up
If they don't recognize my skills joker so what
They don't know talent when they see it they don't know us
But I met the One who did His name was Jehovah
Took me off of death row made a no limit soldier
Still love music just as much as the next man
I just use it now to save jokers from they death jam
Theirs glories in the whistle blow
Toe tap, hand clap, heart beat
You did your thing tip off my high hat

I love to hear the kick hit, love to hear the snare pop, love to hear them hi-hats play
I love music much more than I can say, I love music I was just designed that way
I love to hear the violin, love to hear the keystroke, love to hear trumpet play
Thank God for music, ain't much more that I can say, thank God for music, thank God for music
