[Chorus 1: Ty Brasel, Choir, Both]
Yeah, yeah
Hallelujah, Amen
Look ma I made it out the basement
Look T he balling like Wilt Chamberlain
Hot stove cook up the dope come and taste it
Hallelujah, Amen
Rosegold chain with the praying hands
Young T destined for greatness that’s my alias
Zoom off in the spaceship with my aliens
(Hallelujah, Amen) x4

[Verse 1: Ty Brasel]
Look at Lil' T from the cove
I was 13 with a proposition to cook up the stove
I could see the future It was international we flown
I saw lights blinding they knew all the words to my songs
I was stage diving then I sign my name on they clothes
Mama watching from behind me, backstage with my folks
I could see it vivid in my dreams
Then it turn to smoke
Nightmares haunting me constantly
Coming me for me most yeah yeah
Look at Lil' T from the cove
I was 16 when my first homie
Got murdered in the cold blood
Hold up, Lil' T it's a cold world keep your eyes open
Devils keep approaching provoking
Will I be next, my paranoia keep controlling
Jehovah spoken he said, Young T
Destined for greatness that's the chosen
Angels speak to me like Mary Joseph
They singing hallelujah
I say amen with praying hands, aw yeah

[Chorus 2: Trip Lee]
Hallelujah, Amen
Look ma I made it out the basement
Don't let the jersey fool you bruh, I ain't playing
Speed off in my spaceship with my aliens
Hallelujah, Amen
Look ma I made it out the basement
Don't wait for my downfall, I can't land
Bumping Jesus Musik in my grey Sedan

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Aye, look at Young Trip from the D
Still in high school when I signed a deal in my teens
Some tried to change my plan, but I ran full steam
I just couldn’t let it go, my nicotine kind of dream
Can I get a amen, yeah, yeah
Aye, pick this up on your antenna, hey man
Young T's a rookie, I guess I'm a veteran
Outchea reaching for my goals, like the Space Jam with my aliens
Hey, coach, I want to play
Put me in the game I feel like I'm a shot away
Oh, oh, oh, me no disobey
Trippin in the kitchen finna whip up a souffle, yeah
Aye, I might give me a trophy
Our, our Captains' gone but he's reigning remotely
I'm sweating like it's game seven, double OT
Ty sent this record, I sent back a praying hand emoji, hallelujah

[Chorus 3: Ty Brasel & Trip Lee]
Yeah, yeah
Hallelujah, Amen
Look ma I made it out the basement
Look T he balling like Wilt Chamberlain
Hot stove cook up the dope come and taste it
Hallelujah, Amen
Look ma I made it out the basement
Don't wait for my downfall, I can't land
Speed off in my spaceship with my aliens
