[Intro]
Right now
I just wanna tell ya'll a story
Take you on a  journey
From my condemnation
To our redemption

[Verse 1]
Well let me tell you how it started
In the Garden of Eden
With sweet Adam and Eve the first hearts beatin' (First)
God made them in his image 'till they ate from the tree and since then all men have been born as heathens
We have a sickness like people who can't beat diseases
It's called sin it deserves the eternal heat (Yea)
He gave us life
We can keep it
I'll tell you the reason
But first let's get back to the massacre at Eden (Let's get it)
The very first time man was tricked by Satan
On that date and that day instantly changed our fate
It was undoubtedly man's darkest hour
But Eve didn't have a chance she didn't know his power
We probably would have failed too if the choice was ours (Ye)
It's a dilemma that man alone can't get out of (We can't)
Cause our relationship with the holy God is sour
Yea we all fall short of him like He's tall as towers
Instead staying with the one with the awesome power (God)
We steady chasing girls like Austin Powers
We're all left out in the cold
In a world that's crowded
With skeptics and doubters who want to do without Him
We got a problem (Problem)
We need something to solve it now cause we're separated from the father
And we're lost without Him (We lost)
We got a problem, We need something to solve it now cause
We're seperated from the father and we're lost without Him (We lost)

[Hook]
Its the bad news, we were born in sin
The good news we can be born again
I said the bad news, we were born in sin
The good news, we can be born again
I said the bad news, we were born in sin
The good news we can be born again
The bad news, we were born in sin
The good news, we can be born again

[Verse 2]
So the world went on, sinnin' and all (Sinning')
God even flooded it once to get rid of it all (The Flood)
Time and time again all men would just fall
So God the Son decided to come in the midst of it all
Look, the Word became flesh to suppress our danger (Our danger)
He emerged from a virgin that would rest in a manger (Mary)
An angel had came to say that she was highly favored
She became the mother of the one that became the savior (Christ)
But a little bit before that amazing day
He called on John the Baptist to make the way
And when John saw Christ comin he told the men and the girls
Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
He knew this
Christ had come for our survival
Soon after He would go to call his disciples
He would, guide them, advise them to live by the bible
They were privileged enough to get to walk beside Him (The 12)
And they preached to others as He taught them the code (The code)
They always rolled together like Tommy and Cole
They were all nice guys
Spiritual cats
And they even got to witness His miracle acts
He fed thousands when they didn't have enough bread
He healed blind
Even raised Lazarus from the dead
But, one day, He called them all to meet in a room
And he, sadly told them He'd be leavin' them soon (Ye)
He said He'd be betrayed by one of these in the room (Judas)
But didn't say, He would die and raise in three from the tomb
Or that He'd be the one to clean us like a broom
Just so He could save you and me from the doom

[Hook]
The bad news, we were born in sin
The good news we can be born again
I said the bad news, we were born in sin
The good news, we can be born again
I said the bad news, we were born in sin
The good news we can be born again
The bad news, we were born in sin
The good news, we can be born again

[Verse 3]
None of them knew that
He would be betrayed by Judas
One of the chosen the few in His intimate group of
Close friends who professed love for Him to no end (Man)
They were sad they knew life without Him would be so grim
So Him and some of the disciples went to the garden of Gethsemane (Ye)
He told them to keep a lookout while he prayed with all his energy (Man)
But instead of watchin' the King
Each time He came back they had fallen asleep
But the hour has come, men proceeding armed with swords (With swords)
The disciples didn't want to let him hard the Lord
But, Christ was aware that his Father's will was in this
Betrayed by Judas Iscariot sealed with a kiss (Betrayed)
They took Him away, Judas couldn't look at His face
Think about what Jesus went through, look at His grace
Put on an unfair trial it goes further though
They could have set Him free, but they let a murderer go
I heard it was so, barbaric how they beat him and mocked Him (They beat him)
Man that's God in the flesh, He could have easily stopped Him
But, He thought about us and not Him, He was crucified (The cross)
That's the most painful death, He was bruised, then died (Yea)
Joseph wrapped Him in linen and placed
Jesus Christ to lay, put Him in a grave
They closed to tomb, even put a stone in the way
But when the women came back the stone had rolled away
He rose from the grave, it's great, He's rare with his grace
Redemption for Adam's sin and all who will inherit his ways
We just got to believe that, we'll be freed today
We should rejoice, make noise, cause we've been saved from

[Hook]
The bad news, we were born in sin
The good news we can be born again
I said the bad news, we were born in sin
The good news, we can be born again
I said the bad news, we were born in sin
The good news we can be born again
The bad news, we were born in sin
The good news, we can be born again

[Outro]
Ya the bad new is that
All of us has sinned against this God
Because of that, we're deserving of wrath
But the good news is that
God made way out
He sent his son Jesus Christ is die on the cross
For any of us who want to believe that
Accept Him and trust in Him
We can be born again
And saved
And justified
Ye
My faith alone in Christ
He's the only way
Ye
