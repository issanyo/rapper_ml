[Intro]
Put your hands in the air for Cardec
Woo, woo, woo

[Chorus]
I might do this forever (yessir!)
I might do this forever (uh-huh)
I might do this forever (yeah, yeah)
I might do this forever, man (woo, woo, let's go)
I might do this forever (might do this forever, 'ever)
I might do this forever (I might do this forever, 'ever)
I might do this forever (let's do this forever, 'ever)
I might do this forever, man, 'ever man (woo, uh-huh, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Who needs your loan?
Ain't in the market, I'm at home
Spent way more than three seconds in my zone
We just mobbin', marchin' to his metronome (aye, aye)
This lefty out to his aroma's my cologne
Woo, yessir!
Tell him to run it back
No slowin', I'm runnin' laps
Ain't showboatin', he want me back
Woo! (Woo!) Woo! (Woo!) Yessir!
Tell him the bottom line, feel like we'd be Father Time
Heard through the letters, no dollar sign (ah!)
Feel like there's no limit
Overflowin', I'm so vintage (ah!)
It's so finished, got the gold like Olympics (got 'em, bruh)
Feel like I'm in Neverland
Call this my forever brand
I'm brand new, no second hand (yessir)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I got more livin' to do, I don't know agin'
Salute, I got the fountain of youth, sippin' on amen
I ain't heard of no defeat
Winnin' on repeat
Think He looped it!
Ain't no stoppin' in my future

[Chorus]
'Cause I might do this forever (I might do this forever, 'ever)
I might do this forever (I might do this forever, 'ever)
I might do this forever (might do this forever, 'ever)
I might do this forever, man, 'ever, man (woo, woo, woo)

[Post-Chorus]
I ain't never here to stop, I won't never hit a wall
Tell 'em death'll never hold me in its jaw
So, I might do this forever (I might do this forever, 'ever)
I might do this forever, man, 'ever, man ('ever, man)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, I'm out in my trans, y'all can't kick my stands
I've been the laid back dude in the crew, but I still might hit my dance
I don't wanna hear no rants, girl, better get your mans
My new dream, Ultralight Beam when I get my chance
Oh no, aye, got us loopin' all day
Slow-mo way, see that peace on my face
What more could they want from me? What more could they do to me?
I just been actin' brand new, but that ain't nothin' new to me (ugh)
I feel like there's no limit, words of life make for no sentence
It's so finished, that makes it none of your business (uh-huh)
I'm a survivor, bruh, I don't know no retire, bruh (nah)
I can't lie 'cause this body, it may expire but

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I got more livin' to do, I don't know agin'
Salute, I got the fountain of youth, sippin' on amen
I ain't heard of no defeat
Winnin' on repeat
Think He looped it!
Ain't no stoppin' in my future

[Chorus]
'Cause I might do this forever (might do this forever)
I might do this forever (do this forever)
I might do this forever (that's right, do this forever)
I might do this forever, man, 'ever, man (woo, woo, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
I ain't never here to stop, I won't never hit a wall
Tell 'em death'll never hold me in its jaw
So, I might do this forever (that's right, do this forever)
I might do this forever, man, 'ever man (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I might do this forever
I might do this forever
I might do this forever
I might do this forever
