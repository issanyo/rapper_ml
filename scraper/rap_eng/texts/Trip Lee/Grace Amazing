Trip Lee: yeah, You give me grace amazing
You give me grace amazing

You found my heart in the tomb
Wrapped up all lifeless and bruised
I was the living dead
Couldn't even lift up my head
To see You enter the room
Oh, Oh, Oh

That's how it is with us all
We weren't just damaged we fell dead at the fall
Only the innocent can breathe the air again
Underground, over my head
I'm almost sure I'm dead

Unless You breath life into me
I won't ever feel my dead heart beating
But you open these blind eyes to see
That's what makes Your grace amazing

No one can come to the Son
Unless the Father compels him to come
Our hearts are bottomless
If we're autonomous
Why do we choose corruption
Underground, over my head
I'm almost sure I'm dead

Unless You breath life into me
I won't ever feel my dead heart beating
But you open these blind eyes to see
That's what makes Your grace amazing

Who's a cripple encased in his heart of stone
Christ's the name that I'm calling on, calling on
He's the hope for the hopeless, yall
We were saved when He chose and called
Where is life if its not in the King
You're the God, lift Him up to all things
To His One, His Son

Trip Lee:
Look, you might have heard I was dead in the grave
With some shackles on my wrist
I was very enslaved to the lusts and the passions
In various ways
In the band, on the horse, I was dead and depraved
Sight wasn't just blurry and vague
I was blind as a bat, couldn't thoroughly gaze
At the glory of Christ or the story of life
The Father said come to Him, but I hurried away

I was stuck, couldn't choose to be found
Tell me when the last time
You seen a dead man moving around
Couldn't buy my freedom I was truthfully bound
Couldn't get myself saved
I was shooting them down
Only by Gods will does grace heal with great might
Cuz only the words of God can create life
Give joy, remove shackles and replace shame
I was raised by grace and I praise Christ

Chorus:
You breath life into me
Now I finally feel my dead heart beating
You open my eyes to see
That's what makes Your grace amazing

You breath life into me
Now I finally feel my dead heart beating
You open my eyes to see
That's what makes Your grace amazing

You give me grace amazing
Praise God for that grace amazing
You give me grace amazing
Praise God for that grace amazing
