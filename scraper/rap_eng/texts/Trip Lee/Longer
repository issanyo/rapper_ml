[Verse 1]
Day has arrived, babies they cried
Wifey been up, 8:35
Smelling the coffee, I wake, then I nod
Wrestle with guilt, am I lazy or not?
Now it's 11, the AM has died
I slept through alarms, my anger is odd
I'm mad, but I'm not, I'm decaying inside
Too numb to be sad, I can't even lie
My heart is a drum, all its playing is, “why?"
The echo is loud, I'm vacant inside
I'm out of my body, I gaze in my eyes
I look like a zombie, say my goodbyes
It's killing my highs, I'm asking my God
To heal me I'm not asking for much
I just wanna say: how long will it be ‘till you take it away?

[Hook]
If you ever wonder
How long you'll be under
The weight is on your shoulders, but it won't be always
I know you losing patience
It's written on your face and
I can see you clearly, but all that I can say is
Just a little while longer, longer, longer
Just a little longer, longer for me

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of the pain, I'm finna complain
My doctor is lost, man illness is lame
'07 it came, and it's never the same
It's killin my job, it’s been killin my name
My label is mad, and I'm feeling shame
They not hearing back when they call me, and man
My new book overdue, and my brain is a mess
So what I'ma do? 'Cause my publisher's stressed
I'm shepherding too, I keep letting them down
'Cause my body can crash, then I'm never around
Nowhere to be found, but I'm in the bed
That’s for weeks at a time, and it's dead in my head
My wifey she hurt, the pain in her eyes
She tryna be strong, and just take it in stride
But it's wearing her down, and I'm asking today
How long will it be till you take it away?

[First Half of Hook]
If you ever wonder
How long you'll be under
The weight is on your shoulders, but it won't be always
I know you losing patience
It's written on your face and
I can see you clearly, but all that I can say

[Bridge]
It don't take a lifetime
Waiting on a lifeline
The pain is only temporary
Feeling like your hands tied
Almost to the other side
Pain is only temporary

[End of Hook]
Just a little while longer, longer, longer
Just a little longer, longer for me
