[Intro]
Yeah
Aye this song came from the heart
Came from my own personal experience
It's for all my strong believers who, who fallin' back
And they feel like they fire died out
Imma tell you all my story
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I still remember, when I first started living this thing
And you gave me the grace to make the right decision to change
My whole lifestyle was flipped most thought the kid was insane
Even those close to me my homies wasn't feeling it mayne
But still I wanted some more, I wanted to know this infinite King
You restored my heart and your glory started to stick in my brain
I couldn't get enough of your scripture, I was simply amazed
By Acts, Galatians, Revelation, 1 Corinthians, James
I couldn't fathom something would happen, to make me stray away
I couldn't imagine leaving my Dad, that took me from my playa ways
Who rescued me from the storm, all those gray and rainy days
The one with that, amazing grace, the same one who gave me faith
But recently it seems to me that passion is fading
It's almost like I forgot my Holy Dad was amazing
And without noticing your Word, I started reading it less
Yeah I'm alive, but it feels like I'm just breathing to death

[Hook: x2]
I'm cryin' out
I'm cryin' out cause I'm weak and unworthy
Lord Jesus it hurts me, I'm in need of your mercy
Would you please come and restore me to the servant I used to be
When I was just seeking your glory and was content with you and me

[Verse 2]
After you snatched you up I saw that life without you wasn't life
You couldn't pay me a million bucks to go back to shunning Christ
I'd tell my boys the joy, of living abundant life
Read ya sword, seek the Lord, I'd tell em' to run to Christ
But my desires much less, it's clear that I am such a mess
My life crumbles now I stumble, and I am deserving death (I am)
At first it was just not reading but now it's leading to sin
And it's been so long I wonder if I'll see you again
And the sin makes it even harder for your grace change my heart up
Each breath I take is hard the separations getting farther
I'm scared to pray unto my father cause I feel unworthy
To seek His face I didn't bother, yeah it makes me wanna holler
Cause everything I've known seems to be fading away
This thing is crazy I pray that you'd erase it today
And I know can't just sit idle and wait for you to do it
But I don't know what do I'm crying as I'm going through it

[Hook: x2]
I'm cryin' out
I'm cryin' out cause I'm weak and unworthy
Lord Jesus it hurts me, I'm in need of your mercy
Would you please come and restore me to the servant I used to be
When I was just seeking your glory and was content with you and me

[Verse 3]
Now it's getting even worse cause my sin doesn't even hurt me as much
Why would I leave my first love I used to thirst for your touch
For your direction of my life I loved your glorious throne
I'd put myself in the back seat and seek your glory alone
But now because I love it less I'm becoming morally wrong
I may look the same to all the others but Lord you notice I'm gone
You know I long to come back I miss that peace I used to feel
When I'd reap pray unceasingly and read what you've revealed
But I'm not plus I got a minor depression that I'm hating
To learn a lesson now I'm waiting I'm starting to question my salvation
I'm nothing, I'm dirt I need something to work
So I'll try the only thing that does I gotta jump in ya Word
And maybe if I read I'll be able to recapture
The things that made fall in love with Jesus, King and Master
I know it'll be a struggle but I gotta fight hard
To delight in the Christ who saved me like lifeguards

[Hook: x2]
I'm cryin' out
I'm cryin' out cause I'm weak and unworthy
Lord Jesus it hurts me, I'm in need of your mercy
Would you please come and restore me to the servant I used to be
When I was just seeking your glory and was content with you and me
