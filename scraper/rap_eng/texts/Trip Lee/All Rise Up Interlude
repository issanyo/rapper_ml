It's crazy to think about how much stuff has changed now from, you know - we've been rolling together, you know, and Lecrae and Tedashii if even longer than me. But, for 10 years, you know, I met them dudes in '04 and been rolling with them ever since - and that friendship is deep. And one of the things that make that friendship deep is how much we've been through this journey together. It's crazy how much stuff has changed - I think about the first tour we went on as a record label - the first Unashamed Tour and we were incredibly excited and we think the Lord used that tour. When I look back at it, dang, it was a bootleg tour - we didn't bring no sound. We just showed up and played some, whatever they had, and played some music and rapped on it - and to think about how far stuff has come to - now actually crafting our sets. Thinking about all of our video stuff and thinking about our lighting - and all the stuff that goes into putting on a good show. The Lord has brought us so far, and we love doing this stuff and it's crazy to be able to do it at a high level and I hope we keep getting better and it keeps - we keep growing in a way that were able to do it and folks appreciate it and are encouraged by it
