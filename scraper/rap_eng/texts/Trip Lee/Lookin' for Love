All you've been searchin' and lookin' in all the wrong places
Search no more. Love is here

Hey I had to write this song 'cause the masses are mistaken
They've confused the word love with infatuation
Its sad 'cause when we lackin love the wrong path is taken
They missing out 'cause getting true love is past amazing
It's more than a passing statement, a short lasting craving
It ain't refusing not to wait, it ain't mad impatience
Some been tryna find love in that guy or gal they dating
And before long they hormones are fastly raging
Yeah true love is a must, but that ain't love, it's lustin'
Love would never ask you to do ungodly stuff
Its honest plus, it ain't wrong and hard to trust
Its everlasting and can't happen when the heart's corrupt
Resting on false love you must realized you'll plummet
'Cause real love is much more than butterflies in ya stomach
Most of us are out of line 'cause really the bottom line
Is we looking for love but ain't sure what we tryna find

You tried the pleasures of this world but still there's something missing
'Cause when you close your eyes at night you can feel your heart still searching
I know you tired of being let down so you look for love in all the wrong places
So search no more 'cause it's the life of Christ your soul's been missing

We must learn that love is perfect, it never will fail
I'm ready to tell, its needed and forever prevails
It's so glorious, I'm sure we need some more its true
The world's confused and seems to have a distorted view
Most think love's a sweet kiss, a nice statement in time
But don't know that love is sacred, its patient and kind
It's not filled with sinful jealousy, doesn't brag and boast
It's priceless and can't be bought with a stack of dough
It's so true. It's not rude. It doesn't seek its own
It's selfless, I'm telling this because we need to know
It's not easily angered, keeps no record of wrongs
It forgives, it's a blessing and forever is strong
It don't delight in evil but it likes the truth
It's liberating never fading and it's righteous too
I'd like for you to put love first in here
It always protects, always trusts, hopes, and perseveres

You tried the pleasures of this world but still there's something missing
'Cause when you close your eyes at night you can feel your heart still searching
I know you tired of being let down so you look for love in all the wrong places
So search no more 'cause it's the life of Christ your soul's been missing

I can't stress enough the fact that love will never end
It's eternal better than this other stuff so let it in
Such an unusual experience beyond expression
We need it, we gotta seek it, yeah love is a blessin'
Utter perfection, but something most guys will lack
So the remaining real question's, "Where you find it at?"
I know you wondering if you don't wanna die and miss love
Seek Christ, 'cause the Bible says that GOD is Love
For GOD so loved the world, HE would redeem you and me
Yeah it was love that made HIM bleed and cling to a tree
That's the truth, so without the SON you losing
HE shows love and for that there's no substitution
We try to fill the void with things of all sorts
But let us stop settling for things that fall short
HE can be the lover of our souls turn now to Christ
Lookin' for love? Well true love is found in Christ

You tried the pleasures of this world but still there's something missing
'Cause when you close your eyes at night you can feel your heart still searching
I know you tired of being let down so you lookin' for love in all the wrong places
So search no more, 'cause it's the life of Christ your soul's been missing

You tried the pleasures of this world but still there's something missing
'Cause when you close your eyes at night you can feel your heart still searching
I know you tired of being let down so you lookin' for love in all the wrong places
So search no more, 'cause it's the life of Christ your soul's been missing
