[Verse 1]
It’s T. Lee and I’m back with a fresh flow
Even though I ain’t really left though
Listen in close, this is one ain’t a threat bro
I’m just tryna help you move like the metro (let’s go)
The worst snitch don’t cut it on the block
Ain’t talkin’ ‘bout them dudes that be runnin’ from cops
Ain’t talkin’ ‘bout them dudes that’s pitchin’ that D
Not you, not he, I’m snitchin’ on me
Familiar with the fact that I’m weak
Full in sin from the beginning I lived in defeat
Can’t sin and hide ‘em in the back just to creep
I’m frontin’ stuff pullin’ covers up like a sheet
I love Christ, I don’t wanna let my sins slide
But it’s hard not to keep it on the inside
Can’t stray and start livin’ for me
Livin’ foul man I gotta blow the whistle on me

[Hook]
No I don’t wanna see no trash
So I’ma put me on blast
Godliness I wanna see so bad
That I’m willin’ to put me on blast
I’m a snitch man, I’m a snitch (ok)
I’m a snitch man, I’m a snitch (you for real?)
I’m a snitch man, I’m a snitch (ok)
I’m a snitch man, I’m a snitch (you for real?)

[Verse 2]
Trip Lizard and I’m back on the verse 2
Sin ain’t a game look man it’ll merk you
Ever since the falling of the first two
But I can’t perform no more no need for rehearsal
Y’all know how we like to do though
Frontin’ like everything’s nice when you know
You’ve fallen real short of the life you shoot for
We like kudos, we don’t like rebuke though
Now you gotta stop and ask
Do you hate sin and the life it has?
Or do you wanna paint it like you got this sin
You stop it puttin’ all your stock in trash
I wish I could say that I’m always at my peak
But I would be lyin’, sometimes I’d rather sneak
Since this sin’ll be a pest of my soul till death
I’ma always be a snitch till I’m thrown to rest

[Hook]
[Vamp]
If you hate yo sin you can play this song
Hate yo sin you just say this homes
I’m a snitch, ain’t ashamed of that
I’m a snitch, ain’t ashamed of that
If you hate yo sin you can play this song
Hate yo sin you just say this homes
I’m a snitch, ain’t ashamed of that …

[Verse 3]
Young Triple and I’m back with a verse 3
Sin ain’t my friend in fact it’ll hurt me
Praise God for his Word that alerts me
If I confess my sin then I obtain mercy
Proverbs 28:13
James 5:16, he’ll turn me
I used to hide all the time till it burned me
Now I confess to the Lord it’s the first thing
Then I confess to my fam that I walk with
Every nook and cranny, have I lost it? Nope
I just wanna live in light of what the cross did
Ain’t just tryna look Christ like I’m tryna walk this
I ain’t gotta prove that my works are the best
If it was up to me and my works, I’d be stressed
But Christ already did the work with his death
I repent by faith in his works, I’m a mess
(Guess What?)
