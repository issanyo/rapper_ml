[Intro & Outro: Beckah Shae]
I'm so sick of my mind running
Here I am just running To you Lord
And all I want to do is grow
I'm so sick of my mind running
Here I am just running To you
Lord I know your always in control

[Verse 1: Beckah Shae]
Opps, It always happens when I'm thinking too much
I gotta stop give it to you and just trust
Cause with out you I see things all wrong
Gotta put put put my love glasses on
It's always better when I'm in your will
Your presence and your arms and when I'm still
More of you less of me
So take take take it off, surrender set me free

[Pre-Hook: BenJah]
Take my negativity
Take my doubting mind
And just give me true faith like child inside of me
Inside of me

[Hook]
Take me up down anywhere you want
I'm just along for the ride
I know that you've already got this planned, yea
And it's all in your hands
Take me left right anywhere you want
I'm just along for the ride
I know that you've already got this planned, yea
And my life's in your hands

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Now they can turn the lights down low
And they can sew my eyes closed
But I still got places to go
What I'm trying to say is
He's the one that's taking me bro
He took the wheel homie, I ain't navigating no more
Now I ain't saying I ain't got a saying at all
But I'm chasing Him no matter where He's taking me dog
That's why I run the race, yea I was breaking His laws
But He's erasing my flaws
Therefore I came when he calls
Even though my heart be telling me to turn away sometimes
To leave Him with my live is grey no sunshine
Everyday's a fight and my heart is the front line
Lord help me to trust cause when I do that I'm fine!
