This is the end of my show, this is the end I know

I can't perform no more (eh eh)
Can't fight this war no more (eh eh)
I can't endure no more, all ashamed and pain
I'm feelin strained and can't go on this tour no more
I'm so tired of this tight rope walk
Homie I might go psycho my life's strung off
Eh it's the rest for my soul can this mic go off
I ain't steppin on the stage tonight, shows off

This is the end of my show, this is the end I know
I know these chains had me trapped for a while
Don't know when I last relaxed with a smile
I need a Saviour ta crack through the clouds
Shows over gotta turn my back to the crowd
I know these chains had me trapped for a while
Don't know when I last relaxed with a smile
I need a Saviour ta crack through the clouds
Shows over gotta turn my back to the crowd

I can't perform no more (eh eh)
Can't run this course no more (eh eh)
I been tryna keep up this image to let em see that I'm different
I'm slippin and this is stuff that I can't ignore no more (they trippin)
Can't let these tears hit the floor no more (they trippin)
Because of fear I can't (afford?) no more
Is it a lie what I've been, tryna hide all my sin 'n
Imprisoned and can't no one open the door no more
Tired of tryna be righteous, got my world dark
Like somebody hit the light switch, I don't know where to start
Cause I really don't like this, its heavy on my heart (nah)
Somebody get me out this crisis, my pain is off the chart (please)

This is the end of my show, this is the end I know
I know these chains had me trapped for a while
Don't know when I last relaxed with a smile
I need a Saviour ta crack through the clouds
Shows over gotta turn my back to the crowd
I know these chains had me trapped for a while
Don't know when I last relaxed with a smile
I need a Saviour ta crack through the clouds
Shows over gotta turn my back to the crowd

I can't perform no more (eh eh)
Can't do these chores no more (eh eh)
I'm feelin like I'm sick, it's silly so I quit
That's it, I just can't try to please the Lord no more
Cause really I'm sick of tryna make Him like me more (you feel me)
Cause every day I got a fight in store
I'm guilty so when I play I never like to score
No good in me n I'm sick of my plight I'm poor
They told me homie (whaa) the Christian life is better (word)
But they said to be holy n perform for His pleasure
But now I'm feelin torn cause the Lord is my treasure
But I fall and feel scorned when I can't get it together
But then something clicked, its crazy I ignored this
But even when I slip, this ain't based on my performance
Christ was equipped, ran a race with endurance
When His flesh was hit, His righteousness was my assurance (yea!)

I know dem chains had me trapped for a while
That's in my past, I relaxed in Him now
Christ my Saviour He cracked through the clouds
Did it perfect, listen to the claps from the crowd
I know dem chains had me trapped for a while
That's in my past, I relaxed in Him now
Christ my Saviour He cracked through the clouds
Did it perfect, listen to the claps from the crowd

This is the end of my show, this is the end I know
