[Hook]
I know you might of seen it on the TV
You hear it on the radio and CD
But you can be deceived pretty easy
Believe me...you might wanna fall back
The enemy is crafty and misleading
That's why I use the word of God to lead me
And I ain't eating everything they feed me
Tryna deceive me...so I gotta fall back

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Lies in them songs lies on the television
No telling what lies on the television
Learned sacrasm, sexism, racism
Learned to worship money cars
Learned to hate Christians
All the Christians in the movies so typical
Alcoholic, child molesting, hypocritic and mystical
They say since everybody's doing it it's normal
But Jesus said be transformed and don't let them conform you
You ain't thin enough you need a new diet
You need a psychic everybody does it you should try it
Spring break hit the beach what you supposed to do
Be careful what the media impose on you
You learn how to find peace from a TV show
You learn how to ride clean from them videos
In 30 seconds a commercial have you mixed up
(call now we can have your whole life fixed up)

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
Ay these days if you watch the, box you should block your
Mind in these times and them lies that could lock you
They telling girls in our world to be hot stuff
And telling dudes link with crews on the block tough
Plus I'm feeling like they mock us
They say that God is old school like a box cut
But I'm sure that His flock's tough
And we can judge what is bug, and live pleasing in His sight when the clock's up
I hope we gazing through His lens with eyes
So we can defend what it is when we get they lies
Its on that cash that they fix they mind
They always sayin cheese like its picture time (be easy)
Tell em cool it with the mind games
I'm chasing Christ, I'm renewed in my mind frame
Removed from them tired games
Say my life it ain't mine man
We must remove the damaged parts like a tire change

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Be a rebel let the word of God lead you
Cause Satan uses media to tempt you and deceive you
And he'll lead ya and leach ya and leave ya
So be careful as you navigate through media
Take heed for gravity get the best of you
And you will find a concrete bench press on you
Use the word of God to help you filter all that
Before you fall into the trap you better fall back

[Verse 4: Trip Lee]
You know what I call that? I call that maturity
Learnin how to fall back so you can live in purity
Learnin how to walk that and saying you ain't luring me
The media is feeding us with lies but He's curing me (be easy)
I know guys trying to hype you
But cling to the Lord's Word, flee from them vipers
We spitting aiming at your heart like snipers
We'd like for you to desire God like Piper
