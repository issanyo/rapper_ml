[Intro]
Yessir, you know who this is
This is iLove
Yeah you know woman iLove

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my girlfriend's name starts with an "I"
Shines bright like stars in the sky
Stays by my side, when it's dark she the light
She befriends many and we get lost in her eyes
Starrin' at her, 'stead of watchin' our steps
Run toward her when we wake without catchin' our breath
She's addictin', the truth, we're fiends
And we ain't sniffin' glue, we're just glued to the screen
She rules us, she the proof with your rings
Probably take two of her over two human beings
Her sisters, some bigger, some smaller
Stickin' with 'em daily to keep her in order
Get her when she drops even if we can't afford her
Ask me if I really need her, I be like "sorta"
But when I seen her at the mall, head to court her
I keep her in accessories, your boy do spoil her
I want her in my life, I'd do anything for her
Forget about a dime, boy she more like a quarter
With her all the time and ain't nobody cooler
See her a lil' jealous man, and I don't wanna lose her
So instead of spendin' time with others
She only let's me talk when I talk through her

[Hook]
But iLove
But still I, still I, iLove, I love her
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
Try to put her down but can't help myself
ILove

[Verse 2]
She's really affectin' how my life goes
She controls me, I might go, psycho
I can't think now, mental light bowl
Wady thoughts are pushed out by her light shows
Communities gotta take a back seat
I tried to talk to others but I'm feelin' mad weak
Cause I was something I could laugh at, something I could look up
She keeps me entertained until I barely ever look up
And when I tried to get up in the text
She's tappin' on my shoulder, like "Read another text"
Look, I thought she really be the best
I told her she a heavy ball and chain 'round my neck
She got mad like, "You got a better date? "
I had to man up, time to regulate
Look, I told her if she ain't gon' let me meditate
Then for my sake, we gotta separate
Don't wanna hurt her, I don't wanna abuse her
But she's only there for me to use her

[Hook]
ILove
You know who this is, iLove, I love her
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
Try to put her down but can't help myself
ILove
You know who this is, iLove
I love her so much, I don't need nobody else
But I gotta put her down just to help myself
