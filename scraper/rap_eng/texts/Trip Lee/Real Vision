Look I don't know what they told you but if it don't match up
With His holy Word then homie they need to back up
Some they pretend like they get Him they twisting facts up
That's why we dig in the scriptures to know the Master
Homie, we have to if we want to get past the Only thing we know being what we learned from the Pastor
I really hope your listening, my listeners cause after
We want to see Him clear like a big screen plasma
Half of the cats I seen they don't really know the Lord
They think my views are extreme, think I'm going overboard
But they ain't read a page of the place where He's spoken for Himself in the matters, man that's what I be quoting for
Some say He don't exist, nah that don't even make sense
This Earth is masterpiece somebody had to paint this
Forget the big bang, or evolution and face this
He's the King of Kings and author of all creation
Some say He made it then lets it run like a clock
Nah, He controls every soul and every action on the block
If it happened then He watched and it happens on His watch
No surprise in His eyes, no my God's never shocked

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

Wonderful, Counselor, Masterful
This is Jesus Christ, LORD, all capitals
This is why Trip and I trip after the mass appeal
Of people, who pigeonhole Jesus as a pacifist, Whoa!
A prophet with no power in His plasma
Still we preach against the views that Arius profess to have of Him (look it up!)
Meaning the deifying of Jesus was nothing more than an accident
But the Bible's the proof that refutes and gives us facts on Him
That He was, what His Daddy was Homoousia, the God-Man
Sent to save us all that He loves
And set us free from sin and shut it down like it was Attica
Anyone disbelieving this truth may want to back it up or back It up
Because the Son of Man is coming that's what's up and at His judgment seat is where you will see
His holy wrath is just
But God is Love, that don't mean He's weak! Hey check His resume
Just cause He lets you breath don't mean He won't take His breath away

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

These days in the church, most cats got it twisted
Don't let them fool you on how we posed to live this
For instance, some say to come to Christ for riches
Or maybe your blessing, but my question is what is this?Cause that ain't the gospel, that if you put your faith in Him
To come to the Savior, and then you'll rake that paper in? Face it friends, they made Jesus they holy ATM
Paul would appalled, this gospel would be disgrace to Him
This false gospel strips Him of His flyness
He's more like your servant and less like His Highness
So please don't buy it, that idea is absurd
Jesus said the Christian life can be strife and it's filled with hurt
Look homie I would hate for, cats to get that fake stuff
And never know it's wrong cause they won't open a page up
I pray we erase the wrong views and embrace the Holy Word that testifies to us about the Savior
