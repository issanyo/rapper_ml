Here we go, yeah yeah
Here we go, yeah yeah

[Hook]
Today's the day when we all rise
My anchor’s gone so watch me come alive
Together we stand against the burning lies
And now that I found my wings I'm ready to go
Rise, we all rise
Oh oh oh
We all rise
Oh oh oh
Today's the day
Rise

[Verse]
Yessir
Hold up I'm back to boast on these tracks like
I'm mad at em, might back slap mics
Never mind mind the fact I never left I’m hype
Listen up right you ain't gotta ask me twice
I'm here, I'm here to brag on him like I'm known for
While folks snore I’ma go for it
My God ain’t no folklore, ‘cause he real, he real
Now to the topic at hand
I know the designer, he's higher than pilots who fly up in clouds he designed with his hands
I'm writing to tell you this life is a flash in a pan
How I’ma retire when we need a cryer to tell us to rise up and stand?
Check yo plans
My dude, that grave ain't your home
Cause you been underground way too long
Six deep with a date on your stone
All they say, “That boy gone”
C’mon, don’t you want to go home?
Don’t you wanna be more than a clone?
Do you know that you’re loved and known?
We all ride on the wrong side
But we beating our chest at the wrong guy
“We don't need God”
We may not say it with our mouths, but we do with our whole lives
That’s a bold lie, he’s the most high no close by
We all die, John 5:28-29
The judge is here!
All rise...

[Hook]
Today's the day when we all rise
My anchor’s gone so watch me come alive
Together we stand against the burning lies
And now that I found my wings I'm ready to go
Rise, we all rise
Oh oh oh
We all rise
Oh oh oh
Today's the day
Rise
