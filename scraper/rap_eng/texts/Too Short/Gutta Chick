[Wayne Blazed Hook]
Shorty keep it hood
Riding' shotgun while I'm thugging
And she say she ought to leave
No tripping cause she know we just fucking (ooooh)
That's my gutta chick
Down to do what whatever, whatever (ooooh)
She's my gutta chick
Down to do what whatever, whatever

[Rich Boy Verse 1]
I told the girl rewind it, she always like to ride it
I zip it up and hide it but she always come and find it
My pimping pop a playa, just politics and paper
And I position it for me
Come here ladies let me see
I'm a dog, and bitch I ball in the rain
And the big kush gon chevy on some motherfucking things
Show me that you love me, girl come and suck me
If I let you in my door to see the dick
Then you lucky' thats my main boose bottom bitch
I gave her dame and some dick
Damn, how she swallow it
Damn, how she polish it
Damn after I buss
She right back on the top of it (huh) (yeah) (aye)
Ain't no stopping it
Every night she ride it right pussy gripping super tight
When she can't get me on the phone she want to pussy fight
Could it be? What we doing wrong girl if its feeling strong?
Face sinking in the pillow gripping in pillow holding on harder!

[Trae Tha Truth Verse 2]
So I turned up with this hood bitch
Late night on these backstreets
Audition in the take pipe, ass out on my backseat
It ain't nothing like me I show her for real
Tell her to sit it off then I tell her to chill
Put under the spotlight when I show her the grill
Mike Vick on that ass, got me running' the field
Can't equip the pipe, tell her I need a fix
Four in the morning, got her ass doing tricks
DJ Trae about to put it in the mix
Crack her ass open then throw in a couple chicks
You never know might even star in a couple flicks
Let go, made over rapping a couple bricks
Real shit, what I'm on is so sick
How to shape swag ass to thick
C thru dress, everything else missing
She know about to hit it when I get in position
Telling me go down, that's what she wishing
But I ain't eating shit less it come out the kitchen
You can call me Truth Hefner yeah i go hard
You wear who ass out?, bitch I go hard
Put you in time out for a couple of days
Got the headboard beating like a couple of cars
Stroke game top rank like a couple of stars
Like something i spit for a couple of bars
Yea, truth or real, spaceship looking like it's fresh off mars
And you may not wanna miss it if it take off
One hell of a ride, all brakes off
It should've been a warning or something
The way she got a nigga tryna fuck her face off

[Twista Verse 3]
When I look at her I can see she from the hood
So thick and her eyes so red
I heard that she got that good
And if you got a bottle then them thighs goin spread
It ain't never that she a ho
But she'd be fucking' with a real nigga when he come through
Got it laid out for me with a buddy on her side
Just in case I wanna fuck with her too
After the Nicki Minaj, and sticky massage
You see it was a tricky mirage
And if you feel sad cause she a stone cold killa
You ain't never really gotta call her pretty, she hot
She hold them thangs and if it's drama and we really need the tool
She know how to control them thangs
And stay ever ready to bust
Bagging up work and smoking good
But she really want roll and bang
Her Appetite for destruction, it's prevalent
She good and hard but don't try to play her cause of her elegance
Never let feelings start developing
Though she got some good head she still like the dead president
Put your ass in the box, bad but a chick
Still a gutta chick what a chick they'll show you how to cut a brick
Run a lick so succulent
Stuck 'em for a fit then stick 'em for a shit
Who you fucking with?

[Hook]

[Too Short Verse 3]
I think I'm Hugh Hefner, I'm Charlie Sheen
I fuck these hoes then I hardly see 'em
She's 19, I'm older than her father was
He in the pin though so he don't bother us
I'm her daddy now and she be getting down
My little gangsta bitch, I found her in the town
She got a pretty face, kinda grimy mayne
If I tell her get it, she gon find them things
And bring 'em to me, make her daddy proud
You could fuck her if you cash her out
But don't fall asleep next to my bitch
Cause if you do, she gon take a lot of shit
I rise her well, I taught 'er how to rob a trick
Take a balling nigga and hit a lick
She's a gutta bitch, she's from the hood
But I don't like square bitches so it's all good
