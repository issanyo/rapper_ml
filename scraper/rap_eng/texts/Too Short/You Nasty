Beeyotch!!
You nasty, you nasty bitch
Thats what I said bitch (you nasty)
I said you nasty (you nasty)
Fuck that shit, fuck you hoes (you nasty)
Fuck all y'all, man

Verse 1:
I used to get straight A's, read my books in Catholic school
Now I find myself in the men's bathroom
With a top-notch, goin wild in the stall
She ain't even trippin cuz shes havin a ball
I used to play with my toys in the back yard
But now I just walk around and act hard
Alot of women like to be called a bitch
I'll break it down so you understand all of it
I always thought I was an educator
I might not love her, but I never hate her
Shes the kind of girl to make your toes pop
Keep ya wide open, never need nose drops
Now yall wanna get mad at me
For talkin about another young, nasty freak
Its life, its not a major catastrophe
You ain't a ho cuz you givin up the ass for free, you nasty

I know why yall mad at me, I ain't break your heart girl (you nasty)
Man, these bitches trippin (you nasty)

Verse 2:
Too many tight lil dresses with no panties on
Too many females tryin to take a man home
Where your mommy and your daddy at?
Just because a player got a cadillac
You wanna lay in the back, with your face in his lap
All you gotta do is taste that
You get to ride, get used all the time
I ain't made the situation I just made the rhyme
Adapt to my surroundings, look around
Nothin but pimps, tricks, and hookers found
In the Town, if you ain't one you the other
I ain't fooled, what you gonna do to a brother
Lookin at me, like you wanna eat me
Didn't even have to use words to meet me
Now we havin sex and I forgot your name
You just a hot thang, nothin can't stop your game, cuz you nasty

I already fucked you (you nasty)
I dont know why you trippin (you nasty)
I told yall I was gonna call you (you nasty)
After awhile

Verse 3:
I understand where your anger comes from
Cuz Ive been talkin bad on the mic since day one
Never took the time to explain myself
But keepin it real is somethin I can't help
I know some real women, I know some real hoes
And male-bashing songs, I dont feel those
But I'm glad you bi-sexual women came out
Dont tell em what we did and keep my name out your mouth
If it wasn't for the groupies or for the oral sex they gave me
I'd treat you all like ladies
Im just a victim of society
Look me in my eyes and dont lie to me
You ever had a one-night stand and go to church the next day?
A full night of play, wake up and pray
Wishin you could stay, but you caint'
Oh you a good girl today? You ain't no saint, you nasty

Oh yeah I know I fucked you too (you nasty)
You know what Im talkin bout?
You need to take this muthafuckin opportunity
And have some big fun (you nasty)
I got some drinkin in the kitchen baby (you nasty)
My niggas comin through (you nasty)
Oh, its cool girl (you nasty)
We gon' work this shit out, beeyotch!
I ain't mad at yall
I ain't mad at you
Shit, I ain't mad
Cuz you nasty
