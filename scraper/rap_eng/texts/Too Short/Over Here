[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho
Hey

[Chorus: Droop-E]
Got the bottles over here we having dollars over here
Its full throttle over here you don't want no problems over here
Got the bottles over here we having dollars over here
Its full throttle over here you don't want no problems over here

[Verse 1: E-40]
I finally found what i was looking for
A plug that connect that got em for the low
Endo! outro LA confidential cherry pie and some cookie dough
Now i'm having my money making yeipper getting cheddar
I love it when a plan come together
Its like true southerners true south speakers busted
Zap word equalizer eight eights causing concussion
Hammered up
If I go to jail I ain't going pass the book I ain't going to throw you under the bus
I'ma do my time and hush i'm on the top of my game
King of Cali is what I claim
Clientele and clack fuck with this hustler and get stormed out
What about bitches?
Bitches come a dime a dozen
Nothing nothing nothing I fucking on her cousin
You in the presence of a factor fuck them up and niggas they don't matter
Bitch!

[Chorus: Droop-E]
Got the bottles over here we having dollars over here
Its full throttle over here you don't want no problems over here
Got the bottles over here we having dollars over here
Its full throttle over here you don't want no problems over here

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
We always get the good seats, first class tickets, hotel suites
Skip the line and knock all the freaks you see the check when I eat
This shit ain't' cheap, somehow its just not fair
Big fun its in the budget player
I wonder why you wanna be such a hater i'm gonna take your bitch from you and fuck her later
Cuz you broke you ain't do no stacking you on video games
I'm on making, fuck play station fuck  john madden give me the mike
You know what's gonna happen I'm on stage you at home rapping
You coming from the dome rapping
I push ink pens and get paid a lot but you better keep your day job

[Chorus: Droop-E]
Got the bottles over here we having dollars over here
Its full throttle over here you don't want no problems over here
Got the bottles over here we having dollars over here
Its full throttle over here you don't want no problems over here

[Verse 3: E-40]
Hustlers up suckas down if you can't swim you bound to drown
And its shark infested waters out here in the filthy Bay area
Its much scarier than the area where  you stay
Its sick out here like malaria assault weapon AK
Its dirty out here the bayrea its a funeral every day
On a stretcher man they'll carry you casa permanente
It goes down every town in Californa-e
What is life is like ain't too long
So I'm going to finish a shot of patron walk around a function like yea
I'm trying to take a broad home and get me some dome
Smash through the like smoking and driving
Hard headed with it ripping the side and made a right and a left and hit the boulevard
Touched down at the Marriott courtyard
Bitch!

[Chorus: Droop-E]
Got the bottles over here we having dollars over here
Its full throttle over here you don't want no problems over here
Got the bottles over here we having dollars over here
Its full throttle over here you don't want no problems over here
