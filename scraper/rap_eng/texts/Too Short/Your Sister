You know what?
I'm 'bout to tell you some shit, that's gon' fuck you up
That's real, y' ain't gon' like it
Well, shit
Fuck, that's the way it is, check it out

Verse 1: TQ

I like to think back to when we spent the weekend
In Cabo baby, your sister's boyfriend started trippin'
And left her lonely
After you went to sleep - I spent the night out on the beach
Laid up on her body - how could I keep from hittin'?
And every time I came to your house
She always kissed me in the mouth
Always stickin' her tongue out when you wasn't lookin'
I wanna fuck you sister

Chorus: TQ

Now we been messin' round a long long time
But now I wanna fuck your sister
And I know it sounds foul but that's alright
Cause why should I have to bullshit ya'
(play wit' ya)
I can't help it if she's the one that's on my mind
Everytime I'm out wit cha
I know we messed around a long long time
But now I wanna fuck your sister

Verse 2: TQ

She comes to greet me when I ring your door bell
Lookin' like cavvy
She stands behind you in the kitchen - staring at me
I like to see her when she's getting out the shower
All the things she used to tell me when you wasn't listening
Now the bridge is gonna get cha

Bridge: TQ

Ain't no need for us to stop messin' around
I just wanna hit it for an hour when she get out the shower
On the sink guaranteed not to make a sound
And u know u shouldn't have to be getting' mad at me
I can't help if I want that ass badly
So in the middle of the day when nobody else is around
I'll be fucking your sister

Verse 3: Too $hort (starts rapping during verse 2)

It's time to wake up, control my own destiny
Can't let my addiction to her get the best of me
I ain't givin' up
And I'll never stop tryin' live it up
Cause there ain't no reason to be lyin'
So you might as well let you know
It's goin' down
You wasting time asking me when, where or how?
It's a mutual thing between me and your sister
How you gon' feel when you seeing me kiss her
Ever since she was young, I knew I would get her
Waiting this long to fuck can only make it better
It's like way back when I was tryin' to get wit' cha
I'm tryin' to keep it real girl, I ain't tryin' to bullshit ya
B-ITCH!!!

Too seezy up in this motherfucker
Representing all the way from East Oakland
California style

Chorus: TQ

I wait until you go to sleep
Then I get a little ass for me

Chorus: TQ
