You know what i think?
She's just a bitch
Motherfucking [?] can't tell me nothing in the world
She's just a bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch...
She's a bitch, bitch, bitch...
She's a bitch

Wherever i go, it's the same case
Same old thing all over the place
Freak freak bitches, i can't forget
And all i give 'em is no respect
Figure this out while i say
Too Short baby will play by play
Four homeboys on a corner
A bitch walks by and one jumps on her
Walking with the bitch for about three blocks
[?] turn to grind a [?]
No matter how the game goes with the rap
She's a bitch and [?]
Man, that bitch ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Homeboy, homeboy, is the bitch the tip?

Wherever i go, it's the same case
Same old thing all over the place
Niggas on the bus on the Oakland town
Trying to catch bitches 'cause they are down
Looking out the window, trying to peek
Fine young bitches walking down the street
See a woman about twenty-five
Thick as fuck with the [?]
Some motherfucker all by himself
Said "She's a bitch, but she's fine as hell"

Wherever i go, that's what i see
Any female is a bitch to me
She's a bitch, that's what i say
99 times, every day
She's a bitch, that's the name of this rap
Listen, homeboy, Too Short got caps
Homeboys roll, tos and fros
Going everywhere just pimping hoes
Hitting the strip with a fine girl
Don't know nobody, you're on the world
The next day, the caps come through
Your homie say "fool, is that girl with you?"
Homeboy, homeboy, you're so damn down
You say "That was my bitch from the Berkeley town"

She's a bitch, all females are
She's a bitch, man that's hard
The next dumb bitch who hears my rap
Gonna grab a pen and bite her cap
Talkin' about me like i'm a punk
But all that shit will sound like junk
Fake ass broad wanna rap about me
You're a bitch and the homies agree
Bitch, i'm talking to you
You's my bitch ad you know it's true
Bitch, you hear me speaking?
Now Too Short is really tweaking
You're a bitch in stereo
You're a bitch and the homeboys know

Cool down, girls, it ain't that bad
I only say bitch when i'm rapping or mad
If you know me, you are up
I won't call you a bitch till my dick gets sucked
'84 is now gone
See me singing a brand new song
Talking about bitches, that's my style
I'll keep doing that for a long while
I'm T-O-O- S-H-O-R-T
All females are bitches to me
"Fuck Too Short", that's what she said
Two days later she gave me head
She's a bitch, she's a bitch, bitch bitch bitch make me rich

Too Short, i fuck your mind
Too Short, baby, spit your rhyme
If i mack [?], i rap a party
And see a bitch with a lot of body
I tell my homie i'm moving fast
[?]
[?]
[?]
Let's go outside, without the noise
And talk real dirty like girls and boys
And if you don't suck Too Short
You ain't the bitch i'm looking for

So much game when the homies tough
I make a bitch blow who never sucks
It really ain't a lie, but I just met her
Now I'm saying, "Bitch, suck better!"
Slapping that bitch, roughing her up
I got her [?] and she can't get fucked
Soon as i'm through and bust my nut
One minute later, i kick her butt

Too Short, baby, i'm no sucker
Literally, i'm a motherfucker
And bitch, you're just a bitch
You work fast food and think you're rich
Too Short, baby, got playboy songs
Homeboys just sing along
Say she's a bitch, she's a bitch, bitch bitch bitch bitch make me rich
She's a bitch, bitch, i'm rich

Too Short, baby, i can handle her
Disrespectful with no manners
Bitches don't care, not no more
Bitches lay up with Sir Too Short
All of them say, back to back
"You're talking about me when you sing your rap"
Wherever i go, that's the case
Freak freak bitches all over the place
She's a bitch, you can't forget
And all you give 'er is no respect
She's a bitch, remember that
She's a bitch, that's a Too Short rap

Rollin' [?], you see a freak
Stopped your car in the middle of the street
You so damn down, you know you hard
You say "come on, bitch, get in the car
What's wrong with you? are you lazy?
'Cause you're just standing there looking crazy"
She don't move and you start to yell
You call her a bitch and [?]
Burnt up rubber all over Oakland
Two base rock cabbies, that's what you're smoking
You big old nigga, so damn rich
And all you're saying is she's a bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch bitch
All you're saying is she's a bitch

Gonna sing a rap about a freak
Fucking a different nigga every day of the week
She's so nasty, she's so fast
All you gotta do is grab that ass
You game ain't even gotta be tough
To take her home for a nice quick fuck
I'm telling you people, she's a freak
The bitch even fucks when she starts to bleed
Five days straight, what's the tip?
Some nigga limping with a burnt dick
One day baby came out of class
Some old nigga grabbed her ass
The nigga was happy, so damn cool
That old ass nigga couldn't be in school
Baby didn't care, she's still with it
She fucked that nigga, didn't know he was a pimp
Game goes on in the big Oakland
One down pimp, one bitch [?]
Look

So much death on the Oakland streets
Everyody fucking with OPD
Slanging cocaine, knocking it off
Killed some nigga and never got caught
Running from the police, every day
You can't make no money no other way
Just kinking back, getting high
Your homie got killed and you don't know why
A bitch [?], that ain't true
'Cause you lay down and she fucks you

So much game in a Too Short rap
Her money was short and the bitch got slapped
So much game on the microphone
Her money was long and i went to the [?]
Bitch, i'm that man
It ain't that hard to understand

I can front myself with this beat
I bet you hear it and you still love me
'Cause you're my bitch, my freaky broad
You sucked my dick 'cause game is hard
Talking on the phone, Too Short said
"Tell me, young girl, do you suck head?"
You said no, but wouldn't you know?
My big fat cabbies made you blow
Two days old, what do you know
Freaky little bitch, she's now my ho
Two days ago, i didn't know she exists
But now baby is my bitch
Too Short, baby, and his women
I heard my homie say "Man i'm [?]"
I fuck bitches every week
And i ain't never caught VD
But if i do, i swear to God
I'mma kill that bitch or my name ain't Todd

And you know that's right

She's a bitch, she's a bitch, bitch bitch bitch bitch make me rich
I'm Too Short, baby, what do i say? she's a bitch, every day

One, two, three, here i go
Fuck a bitch and fuck a ho
I'm that nigga on top of life
Smoking on cabbies, don't smoke no pipe
Eighteen years i have lived
And i still love a young bitch
Fourteen, fifteen, all the way up
If she can bleed, then she can fuck
Homeboys, do you agree?
Statutory rape ain't shit to me
I'm Sir Too Short on the microphone
Got [?] young freaks all alone

And if my rap makes me rich
I'll still say she's a bitch

Bitch bitch bitch bitch
Too Short said that

You think you're down, but you ain't hard
See a girl, say "Hi, sweetheart"
The young girl stops, you started to spit it
"How you doing, baby, do you have a minute?"
She said "No, i never would
I have a man and he treats me good"
You're a mark, you ain't tough
You called her a bitch when you couldn't get sucked
You coulda got sucked in your room
But you said "Bitch, way too soon"
I'mma tell you, mark, they way it works
You's a bitch, just like her

Wherever i go, that's the case
Same old thing all over the place
Freak freak bitches, i can't forget
And all i give 'em is no respect
Figure this out while i said
Too Short baby done the play by play
'Cause the wait it be, 'cause the way i see
All females are bitches to me
She's a bitch, that's what i said
99 times, everyday
Too Short, baby, gonna spit it to you
She's a bitch, man i'm through
