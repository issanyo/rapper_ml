[Chorus: Baby Bash]
See them boys at the bar, they all playing games
Fuck that square, shake that lane
Meet me at the tables, stand up on the couch
And grab the whole bottle and put it in your mouth
I'mma make you break it down
I'mma make you break it down
Now girl go on and break it down, down, down, down, down
Now girl go on and break it down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
She gonna break it down like a pound or a key
Executive suites little mama ven aquí
Lifestyle VIP and we living real mosca
Yeah that's my girl with that platinum chocha
Attitude is a mess 'cause she loves to get spoiled
Puffing on that cookie with a cup full of oil
Make it blood boil when she coil like a snake
Booty like man, hold up, wait
See the dude she came with, looking square as back pockets
And she leaving with your boy and he couldn't cock block it
And of course I would destroy when I get the bed rockin'
Million dollar pussy and to me its me all profit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Too Short]
You by the bar, broke dudes trying to holla
Can't buy you a drink, he only got 20 dollars
And y'all bitches too fine for that
All the fake ass lines he spit, its bullshit
He ain't no pimp (pimp)
Who you with girl, just you and your friend
We pop bottles last night, we gonna do it again
Baddest girls in the club we moving em in
Find a spot, I'm doing it locked
But if you ain't hot, you know I'm not
We drink shots of Patrón and Cîroc over here
You can go back over there and drink beer

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
I'm a gangsta but I'm so fly
Thirty thousand feet without a plane so high
This an Amsterdam bag not regular motah
Run upon me if you wanna I'm going in your eye
Call me Rother Vandross or the king of the ghetto
I'm a Christian but I got a laser beam on that metal
I don't even need a beat I go platinum accapella
Eiffel Tower leaning homie got purple and got yellow
Finger nails, limousine tinted, smoked too many doobies
200 on the dash no human can lose me
My lower body is for real, woman you can use me
Whenever I break it down, it is where it should be

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Clyde Carson]
I tell the baddest bitch in the party break it down
A real one in the building, smellin' like a pound
I'm comin' fresh up out the huddle, like I'm callin a play
VIP deep and we all from the bay (aaaaayyyy)
You know they know how we act, they know what we do
Reputation for sinnin' em, so come to our booth
Champagne passed around, yeah we aight
Playin with the chicks, since I was knee-high
Models goin up, its prolly goin down
Hard in the paint, mixin clear with my brown
Fuck what they think, as long as I wear the crown
Got lost from your man, you don't wanna be found

[Chorus]
