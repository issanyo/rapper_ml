Hey Banks
"Sup $hort?"
Man the motherfucking album is funky as hell
All the tracks is laid
"Your breath hella funky"
It's that jam man don't trip with us
Where's Short B at man?
"What's up? what's up?"
Hey Shorty roll one up man we're finnin' to shake this motherfucker out, ya know?
"Give me them papers Peewee"
P
"What up man?"
We ain't smoking no blunts man
We ain't got no cigars
"Hey, where that hendawg at?
You got any drink here today?"
"Yeah outside"
"Quiet nigga, where's your shit at?
That's that Oak- that's that Oakland shit P
Oh yeah, ay, oh yeah, P is from Oakland
P's from Richmond, California y'all
Them Richmond niggas'll shoot your ass in a minute




Yeah! That's how we do it in Oaktown, baby...
$hort Dog's on the microphone...
Straight from the East Side...

I'm a player, bitch, Oakland style
They call me playboy $hort, I know it's been a while
Since dangerous crew took the time to say hello
Mothafuckas makin' money in the ghetto
It's just another day and it's way too real
All my bitches cut, so what? That's how I feel
It's all good so just make me rich
And get in where you fit in, bitch
Well, I get high cause that's what I do
What about you? Tell me is it true?
I heard you was thru, your ass went broke
Jewerly got pawned and your cars got sold
But on the long run you got nothin' to prove
Life to me is like a funk in the groove
You gotta get right in where you belong
Find a right mission and ride the song

Ride it...Oakland style...Bitch!
