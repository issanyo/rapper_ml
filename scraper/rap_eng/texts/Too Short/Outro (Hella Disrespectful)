[Too $hort]
It is what it is—it’s Hella Disrespectful
The Mixtape…bitch
Shout out to Mistah F.A.B. for putting this together
Shout out to everybody that participated on the album
All the rappers, all the singers
Shoutout to the producers, you know who you are
Shit is dope
But the main thing I wanna say is:
Shoutout to the muthafuckin’ Bay
Young homies getting money—I love that shit
Get money, man, making hits, mayne
Stacking paper, mayne; breaking hoes, mayne
Do what you do, mayne
It’s The Bay
But all I gotta say is: we gotta stop that violence, man
It’s too violent out here
Too many shooters, too many robbers
Too many muhfuckas tryna knock each other down for no good reason
You hella disrespectful, muhfucka…
