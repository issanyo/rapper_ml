[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah she talkin' real good, she a certified pro
She a monkey on the pole, she will never let it go
Tossing money in the air, once she get it off the flo'
She an all night, super type porno show
She a freak, she a bopper, she a true head popper
She a freak, she a bopper, she a true head popper
She a freak, she a bopper, she a true head popper
She the type that I like, pussy fine, mouth proper

[Verse 1: J. Stalin]
You can tell the way that the bills fall, we in the buildin'
A lot of ones on the flo', bitch they came from drug dealin'
She already on it, she climb to the ceilin'
And she drop it back down just to show them other bitches
Asked me "What is ya digits?" and nigga it was on
She said she gon' give me what I don't get at home
She said she wish she could clone a nicer version of a nigga
I never be that nigga fall in love with gold diggers
I knock bad bitches, I pick up the litter
I give a dope dick, make her body quiver
Teach her the card game, take it off from a nigga
Enough scrilla, it'll make ya feel like you own a nigga
And you can rent it, you can lease it, but it's her pussy
Get in the middle when it's super wet and real cushy
Ten minutes to make her cum, that's all it took me
Yeah, ten minutes to make her cum, that's all it took me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J. Stalin]
Money motivated, college graduated
Still with all that talent, she shakin' it and she make it
She could have her clothes on, still make you think she naked
See the shit she can do, with a fucking banana
Pussy tighter than a bandanna
Got my soldier out the kitchen like a car antenna
We do it and she be louder than a police scanner
Big ol' Mississippi booty, ask K.R.I.T. and David Banner
I would let you fuck her, but I don't think you can handle her
Me on the other hand, I flip her like a spatula
Feeling like a movie when I enter in the back of her
She get though from the swag, she fucking with a factor
I can work yo back, like a chiropractor
Get up in her hair, like a security code cracker
But at the end of the night, I'm just another rapper
But at the end of the night, I'm just another rapper

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Too Short]
I wouldn't have it any other way
I had a lil' fine bitch the other day
She looked good but she couldn't fuck
Sucked a good dick but she wouldn't shut up
I know this other lil' freak, she ain't as pretty
But she got a nice ass with some big titties
I wouldn't even take her on a date
But we kick it all the time cause the sex is great
What's better? If she's pretty or she's sexy?
I probably don't want the bitch next week
If she ain't got skills
Cause all I want is big money and cheap grills
I give a fuck about her cute face, she loves me
That's so lovely, she keeps saying fuck me
She better not be frigid
Cause all I need is to fuck her real good, then I'm leaving
Bitch
