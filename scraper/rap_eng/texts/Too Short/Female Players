[Woman] Get 'em all alone, and a thug is hung
Screamin aiyy-yah, aiyy-yah

I like them wild girls, the way they throw that
When the music ghetto, and she don't hold back
I wanna see her wiggle, when I stick it in her
Call me the champ, cause my dick's the winner
Bitch! It's internationally known
I picture in my mind, you look nasty in thongs
You probably do it just like you dance (player)
You bout to bust out your pants
You got.. too much ass in your jeans
Throw it my way, I'm not passin a thing
Are you a pleaser, or a teaser?
R&B diva or a skeezer?
To me, it's the same difference
I do my thang in the game, pimpin'
Don't worry bout me, cause I'mma do mine (damn)
Damn this bitch is too fine

Yeah she got dough, she get her hustle on
You can't buy that girl out, fool what you want?
She get her own table, buy her own bottles
Look in her purse, she got long dollars
Now you wonder why she hangin with me
You curious how my game could be
Playin broads ain't a thang to me
It must be a sign up but you can't see (player)
It's right there in your face
Throw the peace sign up all the players in the place
Look around, it's time to go to work
I'm tryin to flirt with little momma in the shortest skirt
I think she with it, but I don't wanna just hit it
I wanna get explicit
And if she kiss it, it's bound to get good
Tomorrow mornin I'll be cruisin round the bitch hood

All my female players, gather around
It's a roller coaster baby you at Magic Mountain
Six Flags on a holiday
You wanna ride again girl you ain't gotta wait
You never have to stand in line for the ride
Just take a few hits cause I'm tryin to get you high
I can't tell you to loosen up
But I can say I love the way you move your butt
Let's make it happen, you wanna go home with me?
So I don't wake up in the mornin all lonely?
We can't compromise, I won't promise you lies
But I will make you feel it 'til the sun rise
And if you wanna know what it's like
Ask all the top notches in the club tonight
They'll tell ya, I ain't tryin to find a wife
But if you fuck with Short Dawg you'll have the time of your life
