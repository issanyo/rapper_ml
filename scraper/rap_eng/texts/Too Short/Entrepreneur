[Chorus]
I got a plug on the white, a bitch sellin pussy
My partner got DVDs and hood movies
I can get the J's before they come to the store
Bitch, I'm a entrepreneur

[VERSE 1: E-40]
He was born with spitt'ms
The gift of gab, izm
Mattress on the floor, borderline poor
Who woulda thought he'd be a entrepreneur?
He used to always say his blessings
Liked to ask a lotta questions
Look like a square but he got a lotta street knowledge
Hung around addicts, gangsters and alcoholics
When he first started off
A young intern, but a soon-to-be boss
Found himself, cause he used to be lost
Cooler than fan belt, cold like a cough
Dottin his i's and crossin his t's he be poppin his p's
Internationally known in the States and all overseas
He be [?] or pushin bags of blow
He got 'em wonderin what he do like Tommy from Martin show

[Chorus]

[VERSE 2: Too $hort]
They lock niggas up all over the land
Now we affiliated to county jails and pens
Get anything you want, just like that
I'm tryina get some money, I ain't tryina go back
Gotta stay on the street, keep the fam straight
It's hundreds to get, grands to make
Stackin for a whip, waitin to get
Paint and rims, then lift that bitch
28's, I'ma ride real big
Choppin up game with my real nig
I know it's hell bein broke
But you gotta stop sellin that coke
Sooner or later, can't do it forever
Need a new hustle, still gettin that cheddar
Mo' paper, less penitentiary chance
All you need is a business plan

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
Where they at?
Shout-out to the money makers
(To the money makers)
If you a hustler
(What about 'em?)
Then you a entrepreneur
(A entrepreneur)
[E-40]
That's written, mane
Scared money don't make no money
Invest in yourself, mane
Ya understand me?
It's a lotta opportunities out there, mane
Ya got your health and your life and your strength, mane
Go get it, breh
