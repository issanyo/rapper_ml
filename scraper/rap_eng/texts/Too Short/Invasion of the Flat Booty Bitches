[Verse 1]
A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with a lot of butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's OK if she's got cash

[Chorus]
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feeling shabby
Got juiced up with a big fat Cabby
Cuz every morning you know I have
A big fat Cabby and a nice hot bath
Just soakin, smokin, Sir Too Short
Thinkin about the day before
Thirty minutes after I woke out
I pulled a freak and took her to the house
She was Eleve Young, with alotta butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy, I wouldn't pass
A light-skinned freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin away
I wanna do the same thing again today
I want bitches, bitches, and more bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

[Verse 3]
The day my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself I must need glasses
Where's them bitches with the big round asses
Me and my group just wanna be tough
Freak two bitches then switch 'em up
It was 3:35, the strip was lit
Every two blocks I seen a bitch
But that ain't nuthin but a cat
None of them bitch didn't have no ass
Wait on the bus, some was walkin
Me and my homie just started talkin
I said, oh, she looks good
He said that ass is flat as wood
I said what about Vicky in the black
He said, Short, she's all that

[Chorus]

The Invasion was on...

[Verse 4]
Every single day of the week
For every nigga living there's a freak
If you've got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cuz bitches all over wanna get worked
I just need one with alotta turf
Me and my homie, rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie, I hate to say
All the bitches with booties stayed home today
And he said Short, what now?
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-Town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
We hit the B-Town like Oakland players
I knew it, bitches was everywhere
The first one had tits so fat
But that don't work, her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
I capped on her like a motherfuckin fool
I said be-atch, I know I'm cappin
Where's your ass, baby what happened
She turned around and capped on me
She said, fuck you nigga, where's your teeth
I damn near fell jumpin out the car
But I slapped that bitch, and slapped her hard
My homie said Short we gots to cut
But I was kickin that bitch and her big flat butt
I kicked her ass, got in the ride
Looked at the bitch and said bye bye

[Chorus]

The invasion was on..

[Verse 6]
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said baby, baby, baby come here
Yea you baby with your long long hair
Baby came over from across the street
She was standin on the corner just talking to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked too fast
Cuz I didn't even notice that big flat ass
Shit, and I was ready to go
We was rollin back to the O
I told that bitch I changed my mind
She looked at me and she said why?
I said I'm Sir Too Short, the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and yo flat booty
Flat ain't the date superstar
I could see if you was white, but your black as tar

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
In the Berkeley temp, what did we find?
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day, I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again

Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Damn, I must be dreamin
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Wake me up 'fore I start screaming
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
What's this world comin to?
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Where's your ass, what happened to you?
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The invasion is on...
