[Intro: Too $hort]
Yeah, we hella disrespectful
We do what the fuck we want, when the fuck we want
We don’t give a fuck what you say
That’s how it is in the Bay, baby
We hella muthafuckin’ disrespectful, bitch
Ay, Mistah F.A.B., tell these muthafuckas how we do it

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
I just wanna ride around town getting high with a bad bitch
I just wanna high-side, pull up on the side of my old bitch
I just wanna ask a nigga to his face ‘Why you actin’ like a bitch?’
I can’t wait to tell a hater nigga ‘Fuck you and that bitch’

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I just want a sexy bitch from another country
A Southern girl thick as fuck, and hella country
I just wanna buy a Bentley, black on black
Then buy my young bitch a fake Louis bag
200 thou foreign parked in front the house
If the bitch is boring, kick her ass out
If the bitch is choosing, make her cash out
I don’t want the pussy, bitch, I want some mouth
I want the blue strips, these bitches foolish
These bitches choosin’; pimpin’, let’s do this
Bitch, I am ruthless; I used to be toothless
I was still stuntin’ hard, clean ass cars, pullin’ up with a cute bitch

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
I just wanna ride around town getting high with a bad bitch
I just wanna high-side, pull up on the side of my old bitch
I just wanna ask a nigga to his face ‘Why you actin’ like a bitch?’
I can’t wait to tell a hater nigga ‘Fuck you and that bitch’
I just wanna ride around town getting high with a bad bitch
I just wanna high-side, pull up on the side of my old bitch
I just wanna ask a nigga to his face ‘Why you actin’ like a bitch?’
I can’t wait to tell a hater nigga ‘Fuck you and that bitch’

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
I just wanna wake up to some hundred thousands
Hell, all my niggas we are out of housing
I just want a Rolie, not too much to ask
A ghetto ass bitch with a lotta ass
I just want a chain and my diamonds dancing
A whole bunch of cars and a private mansion
Some supermodel bitches that I don’t remember
My closet looking like a nigga robbed a tender
Pull up in the Benz, pull up in a Jag, pull up in a Bentley
Ignoring hella texts and super bad bitches saying
“Can you come and get me?”
No, I don’t feel like dealing with these bitches
I don’t even wanna really be bothered
I ain’t gotta go on Maury just to tell a bitch “I am not the father”

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
I just wanna ride around town getting high with a bad bitch
I just wanna high-side, pull up on the side of my old bitch
I just wanna ask a nigga to his face ‘Why you actin’ like a bitch?’
I can’t wait to tell a hater nigga ‘Fuck you and that bitch’
