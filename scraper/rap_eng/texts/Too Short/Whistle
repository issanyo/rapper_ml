[Verse 1: Jonn Hart]
Yeah, slow down baby
Girl [?] that body goin' so damn crazy
When it go up it could go down baby
If you don't know well you know now baby, oh
I swing like a pro (pro)
Tiger Woods with the stroke, let me put it in the hole
So when I [?] fall (fall)
Get low, get low, buss it down like woah
From the side, to the side, swervin' it like woah

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
Damn that ass fat, had to whistle like
The way she give top had to whistle like
Beat the pussy up had to whistle like
Damn that ass fat, had to whistle like
The way she give top had to whistle like
Beat the pussy up had to whistle like

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
What's my favorite word? Bitch
Why you gotta say like [?]? Bitch
You know you my favorite hoe
It's not love but I love the way you blow
These other hoes think I'm pimping you
Don't ask me what I'm finna do
She said "$hort what you 'bout to get into?"
I said "you and probably your friend too"
They can hear you from a mile away
What the fuck? Why you so loud bae?
I'm watching them big titties bouncing and jiggle
You riding my dick and sound like whistle, bitch

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
The way she give top had to whistle like
Beat the pussy up had to whistle like
Damn that ass fat, had to whistle like
The way she give top had to whistle like
Beat the pussy up had to whistle like

[Bridge: Jonn Hart]
Go down with it, get loose with it
Back it up and show me what you do with it
Go down with it, get loose with it
Like $hort said "Let Bruce Bruce hit it"
Go down with it, get loose with it
Back it up and show me what you do with it
Go down with it, get loose with it

[Chorus: Jonn Hart]
'Cause damn that ass fat, had to whistle like
The way she give top had to whistle like, yeah
Beat the pussy up had to whistle like
Damn that ass fat, had to whistle like
The way she give top had to whistle like, oh
Yeah
