(Female voices)
I said hey, you, need to holla at these boys
These boys called Jim Crow
Fucking niggas known worldwide
With a car full of hefers inside

[Verse 1]
When I'm on Candler road, girls holla like, (AHHHHHHHH)
Oh yeah that's me
In a big boy truck on them' 23's
When my boys burn it down you gon' need +Febreez+
Girl, go get my money off the motherfucking streets say, (AHHHHHHHH)
Yes, I should jack your knees
Now, In high school I was an absentee
Cuz I was at the skip party spiking Daqaris
Big player, she on her knees begging me like prayer (AHHHHHHHH)
I get the money start living life well
Kinda country and my bank gon' stay fuzzy
And my pockets stay plushy, holla at me
Better yet, swallow at me
SO many hoes go (AHHHHHHHH) choppin' at me (chop chop) we sucking
Niggas can't copy-cat me
You can find me on Ralph David Abernathy
Bitches bumpin' like acne, come on

Holla at a playa when you see me on the street trick, (AHHHHHH)
Yeaaa, holla at playa, holla at a playa
