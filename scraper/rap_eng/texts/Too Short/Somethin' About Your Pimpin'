[Intro]
(Beyotch) Pimpin' ain't easy so I dog these hoes
Fuck all these hoes (Fuck these hoes)
I said life is too short so I dog these hoes
Fuck all these hoes (I ain't no hater)

Pimpin' ain't easy so I dog these hoes
Fuck all these ho's (But I don't love you)

I said life is too short so I dog these hoes (What)
(Beyotch) Fuck all these hoes

[Too $hort]
I try to get a bitch a chance
At the strip club tryin' to get a dance
But I don't want to see her strippin'
Unless she's lickin'... my dick then I'm gettin'...
Some pussy or somethin' cause if the bitch ain't fuckin'...
I'm rollin' out, you know what's up nigga
Holla at your California homie $hort
Rolexes and Benz's is what we sport
We come from nothing - but we made it
And all we really tryin' to do is just stay rich
I let the fans tell me what they wanna see
Hit the studio and make it funky, bitch
I got love for my hometown
But I got to get paid cause I'm grown now
I'm all about my hustle -

You can hate me, I don't give a fuck hoe
I've been programmed to break you
You don't wanna turn tricks, did I make you?

Get my motherfuckin' scratch bitch
I'll pimp your baby's mama and that fat bitch (that's right)

[Chorus]
There's somethin' about your pimpin'...
It really turns me on...
No, I never could fuck for nobody else
I'm hoin' for Lay and Too $hort...

[Layzie Bone]
Niggas just tryin' to live life long
Fuck, from Cleveland to home

Call in to do a million songs, a hundred million strong
Right from wrong, bout to decipher what you get out of life
Please Lord, don't let me die before my pockets get tight
I came to rule the world and pimp this game like a hooker
I took a chance and to the top is where this rap shit took us
Book a show, one fifth o' four, make twenty five G's or more
Drop the jewels, let's show these fools platinum right out the door
Even the score...Now all of my niggas is famous
I'm livin' life like it's painless and now the hood want to blame us
Get your money on nigga, get it just like $hort
Cause I'm a ballin' lil' nigga when I step on the court
Hustlers of all sorts play the sport that you choose
You study long, you study wrong, nigga, you snooze you lose
You ain't heard the news? Cash rules everything around me
Ain't lettin' these po-po clown me, tryin' to keep me in the County
Houndin' me, soundin' me like niggas enjoyin' all this trouble
Me? I puff on my weed, thuggin' with my G's drinkin' that bubbly

[Chorus]
There's somethin' about your pimpin'...
It really turns me on...
No, I never could fuck for nobody else
I'm hoin' for Lay and Too $hort...

[Outro]
Pimpin' ain't easy so I dog these ho's
Fuck all these hoes
I said life is too short so I dog these ho's
Fuck all these hoes
Pimpin' ain't easy so I dog these ho's
Fuck all these ho's
I said life is too short so I dog these ho's
Fuck all these hoes
