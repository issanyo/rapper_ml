I'm money motivated, I'm all about my bread
All the hoe ass niggas hate it
They wish that I was dead
I'm money motivated, I'm all about my bread
All the hoe ass niggas hate it
They wish that I was dead

Now I done did some good things and bad things with my life
But the good things outweight the bad things
Flipped the coin and I rolled the fucking dice
Forgive me god for serving dope fiends
I just set back in my life, I was low in my ends
But guess what, god reached out and touched me again
The dope game up, start doing what I do best
Beside hustling and sex, rapping was the next
I knew I was it, I knew I can spit
More family more fetty than selling them bricks, plus it's legit
I'm sharp like machete, my Chevy is heavy, watch me dip
If you stay ready, ain't gotta get ready, extended clip
Dig this, like a devil and anthrophology
Seeing other niggas get money, inspires me
I'm not a hater, I'm a money motivator
If you can't beat em, join em
We can all get paid

[Hook]
We grew up on too short, selling dope on the corner, smoking newports
Tryina stack cause you dreaming, og's know exaclty what I mean, we ain't seen em
It's a blessing if you still around, ain't gotta sell coke, we still getting down
A real hustler, always gets dope
And broke niggas don't always be broke
You better sit where you fit
You gettin away, you get hit with a clip
Fuck around and get sent to the pen
So much time we never see him again
I'm out here on one, been grinding for years, I got a long run
And all the fucks that gave up, fuck them
Cause this is what I am

[Hook]
I ain't got no time for no haters
I'm just out here on the grind getting paper
I ain't got no time for no haters
I'm just out here on the grind getting paper

In and out of the traffic, commute
If it ain't about no loot, then it's minute
You can catch me in a hoodie or in a suit
I might be in a Sedan or a coupe
I got a question to ask the government, why?
There's more youngsters in juvy than it is in junior high
I got a suggestion for my brethren, try
Work now, rest when you die
The truth is amazing, we all out here acting like we crazy
Brain wash tryina kill each other
Get together, we can make a million dollars
Would you kill a nigga cause you know you part of
Or get money like short dawg and 40
Boy you wanna get in the streets and make the grip
Just look in the mirror and say this

[Hook]
I ain't got no time for no haters
I'm just out here on the grind getting paper
I ain't got no time for no haters
I'm just out here on the grind getting paper
