[Verse 1: Too Short]
Don't lie, I know how you make a living
You a hoe, not a housewife in the kitchen
Tell them square ass niggas you selebit
But you and me know you be selling it
I don't pick up pussy, that's what rookies do
Get her loose, that's what the drink and the cookies do
You tell a nigga like me is gonna cost me
You be fuckin for the money, feelin bossy
Old school game, I was raised right
24 7, live the player's life
You sell it from Vegas to the Vadakin
Sell that pussy to Asians to Africans
You ain't a hoe, you must be sick, bitch
Fuckin with me, you won't get shit
All you goin get is this big dick
Better hurry up, and get you a rich trick
Bitch!

[Hook: Blake Kelly]
All these bitches fuckin for some money,all these bitches fuckin for some money

[Verse 2: Slim The Mobster]
My X hate me, even though she used to date me
In the club, but she never could replace me
I'm the best, and she say she never knew it
Never could admit it, but I fucked her like she knew it
All my bitches forin, call them basian
And all my niggas on, call them the A Team
We been ballin for a minute, that's a great thing
And now we finna shine, that's amazing
Pull up to the club in that T Street
All you niggas mad, cause you envy
Bitch bad, she be cheatin, why she with me
Three sons, you can catch m on my instate

[Hook: Blake Kelly]
All these bitches fuckin for some money,all these bitches fuckin for some money

[Verse 3: Blake Kelly]
You probably fucked my bitch, unless you payed for it
I'm a cold hearted nigga, you ain't made for it
I know she made you wait for it
But Imma ride her like a skateboard
8 brauds, 6 cars, 5 boats in the backyard
For this here money, Imma go hard
40 grams sawed off, 20 grams in my yard
Face like oh man, ass like good lord
Mix that Jamison with the Lemonade
Hit the club, shut it down like back pain
My bitch ain't ever ride a tocki
Shit, I only do it for the profit
Strapped up, my coope flawliss
Rollies and new watches, only get haters when you poppin
My bottom bitch on the shit, getting chips
You mad, cause you can't stop it

[Hook: Blake Kelly]
All these bitches fuckin for some money,all these bitches fuckin for some money
