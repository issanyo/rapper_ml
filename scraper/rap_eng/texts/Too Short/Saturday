[Intro]
Today, yea
The weather and the women and the weed
Oh yeah, it's Saturday and I am your favorite DJ
DJ Easy-Dick, I'mma give it to you the long way
It’s Warren G, E-40, Fonzerelli, Too $hort, and Nate Dogg
It's Saturday

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It's Saturday, time to go out and find me a party
I wanna play, got to have you all over my body
I feel nasty, when the music hits me I get real naughty
And I wanna play, yeah, if you feel me go raise your hand somebody

[Verse 1: E-40]
Who is that big African American in the Cayenne
Doing what he want, not doing what he can
Behind tinted windows, car worth a hundred grand
Speakers on tremendo, quaking, waking up the land
Popping my izzim, better holla at this broad
In the Geo Prizm, I deserve an applause
Bruh, I know how to pick them, boobies shake like Jell-O
Not from Pittsburgh but she black and yellow
I said, “where’s your fellow?” she said, “I fired that buster”
Bum ass nigga, couch potato hustler
He spend more time with his homies than he do his honey
Always in her face asking for gas money
I said, “today your lucky day, what’s your schedule looking like?
Can you come out and play? I got a show tonight”
You deserve it baby let your hair down, let’s celebrate
It’s the weekend doll

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It's Saturday, time to go out and find me a party
I wanna play, got to have you all over my body
I feel nasty, when the music hits me I get real naughty
And I wanna play, yeah, if you feel me go raise your hand somebody

[Verse 2: Warren G]
Sunny skies it’s a beautiful day
Money wise it’s a beautiful day
When the sun goes down all the fun goes down
Thongs go down and tongues go down
She looking for a man I’m like damn, look at this here
I’m looking for a freak, but not this freak here
It’s time to switch gears, full speed ahead
Some weed and some head
New sheets on the bed
All they want is sex, trees, and ecstasy
All I want is all bitches all next to me
Surrounding me, all around me
Hounding me like they all wanna pound me
And I’mma just let them, I’mma just hit them
Like it’s my birthday, everyday a workday
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday work
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday…

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It's Saturday, time to go out and find me a party
I wanna play, got to have you all over my body
I feel nasty, when the music hits me I get real naughty
And I wanna play, yeah, if you feel me go raise your hand somebody

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
That’s how I do it pimping, woke up with two beautiful women
I’m ‘bout to hit the carwash and the barbershop
Then I might dip to the mall and shop
Just ate at a nice little breakfast joint
On my favorite day, so what's the point?
The whole town’s in a good mood
Smoking good weed, eating good food
And I’m thinking, wish I could go the beach
The girls flirting, damn, they must know I’m a freak
You wanna be the best I ever had in my life?
Shoulda seen what I did last Saturday night
Told these girls in my stable
Call the VIP house and reserve a table
And make sure you wear a new fit
Rock and patron man we too lit

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It's Saturday, time to go out and find me a party
I wanna play, got to have you all over my body
I feel nasty, when the music hits me I get real naughty
And I wanna play, yeah, if you feel me go raise your hand somebody
