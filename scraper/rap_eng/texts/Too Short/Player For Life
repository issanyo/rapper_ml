Gotta be a player for life, gotta be a player for life

(That's right) Gotta be a player for life, I gotta be a player for life

[Too $hort]
Smob to the tip, I feel no guilt
She's young and she's fine and she about to get peeled
I know you heard why, no need to tell
You looking at a certified P.F.L
You wanna be like me?  I don't think you can
Your girlfriend loves you, need to be her man
She never told you how she was a Too $hort fan
She kept it to herself, you wouldn't understand
I met her at the mall when she was mad at you
She said, "Gimme a call", and I was glad to
That night, I gave your girl a ex tab..
.. the best sex she ever had

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I gotta be a player for life, I gotta be a player for life

[Too $hort]
It'd be nice to wake up to some little smiling faces
Saying, "Daddy" - instead of being in wild places
Smoking fatties, four hoes in my Caddy
Each one willing to have me
Sometimes you want my life, sometimes I want yours
I'm trying to find a wife and you trying to find whores
Which one of us is looking in the devil's eyes?
I'd settle down if I could have seven wives
But that's illegal, and everywhere we go
We roll through the town taking every ho
And of course, we show no remorse
I'm doing one-twenty with your ho in the Porsche

'Til death do us part, with all your heart
It was love - right from the start
But could you do it - could you change your life
And get married, stop running game every night?
Ex-player with his wife and kids
Looking happy; I wonder if he really is
I would hate to be committed even though I ain't wit it
Still out in the streets trying to get it
It's hard for a man with access to one vagina
To be faithful, when she's so much finer
Than his wife - she seen it comin'
He fell in love with another woman

[Hook]

[Too $hort]
I keep coming back to the same thought
Falling in love'll throw the game off
You let her get to you, you know you still care
But I was raised by them real players
I try to tell the homies fuck the party
This player lifestyle ain't for everybody
You gotta make your own choice - it's your life
How would it be without your kids, and no wife?
Waking up with a tramp - you don't like
Nigga, you better hear what I'm saying on the mic
You wanna be a pimp, you better go back home
Leave them tramps alone, you know you're wrong
You're wrong
