[Intro: Wallpaper. & Too $hort]
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass, bitch
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Too $hort in the house
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass

[Verse 1: Wallpaper.]
She got a Nicki Minaj, 2 car garage
And a Kim Kardash, it's a butt collage
Wanna hide inside like camouflage
Got its own zip code and entourage
Shake milk, drop, make fromage
Shake that out like oh my gosh
Hit and run, don't break the law
On, on to the next one, bon voyage

[Chorus 1: Wallpaper.]
I look at that bodang
I gotta say, "Oh dang"
You gotta zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
And put your butt up on it
I look at that wagon
I gotta quit laggin'
I gotta zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Oh, I'm 'bout to go outta control
Going butt to butt

[Post-Chorus: Wallpaper.]
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
What a, what a, what a, what's the what
Everybody going butt to butt
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
I met this girl, her name is Assley
She walked right past me and hooked me like an addict
Now I can't say no to crack, bitch
I don't wanna smoke it, though
I just wanna stroke it slow with my Pinocchio and let it grow
Take her to a short dog show
Put her in the front row, then call her a motherfuckin' ho
(Why?) Cause I'm loving her
Her name is Ass and I'm rubbing her
Later on, I'll be fucking her
My state of mind is I'm the governor
And I run this shit
I party like Charlie with a fun little bitch

[Chorus 2: Wallpaper.]
I don't think i'm ready
Okay, I'm ready
You gotta zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
And put your butt up on it
Ooh, look at that Buddhist
I gotta go do this
I gotta zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Oh yeah, I'm 'bout to go outta control
Going butt to butt

[Post-Chorus: Wallpaper.]
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
What a, what a, what a, what's the what
Everybody going butt to butt
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass

[Breakdown: Wallpaper.]
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
Grown, grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass

[Bridge: Wallpaper. & Too $hort]
Say it like this, molasses
Say it like this, molasses
Let me get season passes
Let me get season passes
Say it like this, maple syrup
Say it like this, maple syrup
I can make a kitty purr
That's a grown-ass woman with a grown ass
A grown ass, a grown ass, a grown ass, a grown ass
Bitch

[Outro: Wallpaper.]
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
Everybody going butt to butt
What a, what a, what a, what's the what
Everybody going butt to butt
