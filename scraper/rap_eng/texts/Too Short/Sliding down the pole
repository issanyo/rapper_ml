[Verse 1: E-40]
They say her brain is in her ass
But she really smart
All about her cash never been a mark raised in the
Trap seen a whole lot
Gluteus maximus shape like a heart
Legs spread apart trying to go to Clark
Looking for the light
But always find dark
Some of my folks like tricking
Some of my folks like pimping
Some of my folks spit rap
Some of my folks pitch crack
Give you a tycoon shower
Without the shower cap
I got the money and the power
Sprinkle you a stack there she go sliding down the pole
One dollar bills coming out her asshole

[Chorus]
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go slidin down the pole
There she is there she is
There she go there she go
There she is there she is
There she go there she go
Wow
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go slidin down the pole
There she is yea
There she go uh huh there she is yea
There she go wow

[Verse 2-Too Short]
There she go
Down the pole
Thats daddys little girl
But he don't know
If he finds out she’ll be in trouble
But if he dont her money doubles
Everyday she goes to work
Put her on stage they go berserk
I’m way in the back blowin purp
You throwing cash in the air
You suppose to flirt
She come out them draws ass everywhere
Dont keep her all night pass her player
Cause she’s my favorite yes she is
I wanna see her dance naked She’s the best in the biz
Bitch!

[Chorus]
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go slidin down the pole
There she is there she is
There she go there she go

[Verse 3: Kurupt, Too Short]
Bigger than all outdoors
She got booty galore
Ass like I've never even seen before she cakey
She picking up her money off the floor
Its crazy all the ballers in the club know
Called the crib told my broad I
Ain't coming back home
I den found me another chick I wanna bone
They call me short
I’m nothin nice
Been hanging out in clubs all my life
Seen a wild ass stripper hair was bushy
Upside down with a bear in her pussy
Lay up on the pole she can sit on a roof
Slid back down she was getting it loose

[Chorus]
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go slidin down the pole
There she is there she is
There she go there she go
There she is there she is
There she go there she go
Wow

There she go slidin down the pole
There she is yea
There she go uh huh there she is yea
