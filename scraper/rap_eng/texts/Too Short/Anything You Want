[Intro: Too Short]

(What do we get for 10 dollars?)

You mad cause I'm fucking your mistress
Ask me, nigga, that's some bitch shit
My sperm, looks like diamonds on her neck
And all these niggas want to kiss that bitch
You can have her

[Verse 1: Mouse]

You can have her, she still gon give me the shit I need
Mac Mouse, training bitches like a dog breed
OG's all up in my circle ho
I'll give you anything, but first you got to bust it open
Listen close, I bag a bitch and use her like a chauffeur
Drag her like a G's supposed to, even if I barely know her
Baby let me put it on you, hit it like I'm Sammy Sosa
Once that vodka's taken over, you gon think you work at Stroker's

[Verse 2: Too Short]

Yeah mane, I run that pimp game
Give a bitch some money, you get anything
For ten dollars, you can watch her dance
It costs a whole lot more for her to drop them panties
(Can you afford it?)

[Hook:]

(What do we get for 10 dollars?)

If you want that bitch, you got to pay that bitch
You know what you get

[Verse 3: Mouse]

Straight cash, you get what want
All you got to do is say so
And that bitch'll turn up
Keep it pimpin' when you see me
All my niggas say church
I'll still hit her when I'm mad
Cause I done already learned

[Verse 4: Too Short]

Came out of your cell, say what?
You want to play with the slut
Go way her guts
While you fuck, bustin' big baby-making nuts
And for the next 9 months you'll be laying in the cut
That's what you want?

[Verse 5: Mouse]

I cold dick her, fuck her like I'm her killer
Love her, make her remember
Bust it open for my niggas
Throw my cheddar at the strippers
Tell 'em "say cheese" for my pictures
Order up another trio, and a two-piece just for dinner
Yeah

[Verse 6: Too Short]

If I knocked down your main bitch, and somebody told you
You still wouldn't say shit, you know how these hoes do
They out for the money, and most of the niggas just want the hunnies
So put your order in

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Mouse]

M-O to the B
? come try this Squad life
Rooster off this ?
Call and get it Facetime
Niggas hate, but that's fine
Pretty money, pretty grind
Hope you niggas focused
Got'em bustin' call it suicide
I keep it coolin', they choosin'
I'm in my Mac mode
This for the groupies and ratchets
I don't even know
10 dollar hoes, where they do that?
Let me see you kill this pole
And I'll throw you a stack
It's trap
Bitch!
