[Intro - 50 Cent]
Just one night, tonight
It could be three of us
Yeh yeh yeh
Girl, we could get it on
(Where ya' girlfriend)
Girl, we can have a ball
(Bring ya' girlfriend)
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love until the next day
We'll have the rest of our time to celebrate

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
Four in the morning girl
Now I don't wanna talk
We've been talking for hours
Now you know I wanna fuck
Look I don't understand what it
Is you don't understand
My watch a hundred grand
My chain a hundred grand
Bitch, I'm a wanted man
I say I run New York
Cause I do what the fuck I wanna do
They know wussup
They say my screws are loose
I say who cares, you know I'm rich
Look I don't have time to blow with a bitch shooting the shit
Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work
So I can whisper in your ear while pulling down your skirt
When I get the stroking girl you don't know what to say
Quick come quick, girl, I'm gone right away
Yeh, you nasty, girl, you nasty
And I'm into that, so get at me!

[Hook - 50 Cent]
I don't want no good, good, good, good, girl
Me, I want a nasty girl
Come creep with me
Be a freak for me
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love until the next day
We'll have the rest of our time to celebrate

[Verse 2 - Too Short]
I said bitch
I wanna fuck you in the worst way
Hell yeah, I wanna fuck you on the first date
If I don't
I say, fuck you on Thursday
Cause then I won't want you
Watch how fast I dump you
But right now I'm infatuated
You get to hang with me
Girl, you graduated
I take you out for drinks and get you tipsy
Then I pull my dick out and I say kiss me
You're about to laugh ya little panties off
You only get one date
You better grab these balls
They wanna ride in fancy cars
That's what bitches do
They like to rub it then suck it and lick it too
She's a nasty little trap ho slut
But I like that shit, so let's fuck
Bitch!

[Hook - 50 Cent]

[Outro - 50 Cent (+ Too Short)]
Ohhh, ehhhh
It sounds crazy
But tomorrow's not promised
I mean, I mean I wanna do it today
I want it now
I don't wanna wait
Wait for what?
My time's running out
Your time's running out
Come here girl
(Wanna fuck you bitch
I wanna fuck you bitch
You only got
One date
Ain't no tomorrow)
