[Voice Talking: Verse 1]
Yeah, but you know people are scared to have conversations
Like this and that's[?]and that's what it boils down to
When you see a guy you already know whether not you want to fuck him
Don't you?
[Girl:] Yep
[Voice Talking:] Guaranteed
[Girl:] Yep

Alright we are gonna have a hot time in the old town tonight

See a fly skinny on the avenue
My shades down hat flipped on and on a cashew
Could not believe my eyes so I lifted up my shades
And this girl is starring at me as if she wanted to get laid
Next the girl started stepping and she crossed the street
She walked to me and at that my knees got weak
Then I snapped to realize that it was my duty
To get this freak and cold wax the booty

[Hook]
Wax that booty
Cold wax the booty
Freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty
Wax that booty
Cold wax the booty
I gotta freak freak so I am gonna wax her booty

[Verse 2]
Heading for the crib I was reciting some rhymes
When the freak cut in and started telling of the times
She wanted to rock me and these were no lies
And that is when I contracted the rise in my Levis
Step into my crib she said the rise impressed her
So without delay I began to undress her
Unstrapped her bra and whispered to her are you with me
She said yes so I grabbed them titties
Next was the test to see if she was high rank
I dropped her panties and was slipping, I asked do you stank
She said no and noted to me that her shower soap is Gucci
So I dropped my boxers and headed for her coochie
Headed fo her coochie
Grease it down real good
Headed for her coochie
Dang that's good

Now when I got to her coochie I looked close to see
If this girl had any types of signs of VD
She did not so I said to myself Oh goody
And I grabbed my dick and co-stuck in her puddy
Started rocking this freak with my hands on her butt
You should have seen in her booty I was tearing it up
Next I whispered in her ear baby please turn over
And rocked doggie style while I was calling her Rover
Still tearing it up on her face was a grin
Holding on to her waist pumping harder than sin
But she was loving it all with her back in a arch
I busted my nut and she started to bark
Arf[?]Arf[?]Arf
Uhhhhhhh
Arf[?]Arf[?]Arf
Uhhhhhhh
Arf[?]Arf[?]Arf
Na na bop but nop but

[Verse 3]
Now if you think the story is over just listen to this
I thought my mission was complete so I gave her a kiss
Then I was searching for a towel to clean off my dickie
Because it was kinda wet all bloody and sticky
And to talk about gross heres something sicker than sick
The bitch dropped to her knees and licked the tip of my dick
I started tripping cause this was something I've never seen
The girl was more than a freak she was a sexual fiend
And when I thought that was as gross as one girl could get
She stuck her finger in her booty and then she licked it
Oh now this girl was much more to me than a freak
In my opinion she was plain nasty
But never the less I completed my duty
I got this freak and co-waxed the booty

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Too short don't stop
Too short don't stop
Too short don't stop the beat
Hey yo short dog can I get a bitch
Biiiiiiiitch

Now if you like the booty come on fellas show it
This is your last verse to wax so why would you blow it
And if the ladies if you are tired of a man on your fanny
Then fuck you go home and watch the tube with granny
Cause this is booty night non stop
With the number one waxer, me Kid Rock
So lets get hyped cause if I see you calm
I am gonna think that you are waxing with Rosie Palm
I mean really how could you be so dumb
Just look at all the girls that are dying to get some
Man, just don't be a wussy
And I'll guarantee you could get a piece of pussy
But to get it you have to realize
Don't brag to the freak about your dick size
Man, that's not the way to win it
Cause it is not the length of your wand its the magic in it

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
[Voice Talking:] Yeah, but you[?]you know[?]you know what I'm saying
What kind of Popsicle you like?
[Girl:] What kind of Popsicle?
[Voice Talking:] Yeah
[Girl:] Don't matter
[Voice Talking:] Huh?
[Girl:] It don't matter
[Voice Talking:] It don't matter?
[Girl:] Nope
[Voice Talking:] So what, you gonna do that to mine, ain't you?
[Girl:] Nope
[Voice Talking:] Well you ought to
I mean you ought to go run to the store
And you know they would never know what you practicing for
They'll like, "Girl you trying to put some weighty not a Popsicle
And in the back of your mind no I'm practicing to suck Kid Rock's dick
You know? That would be kind of sweet, wouldn't it?
