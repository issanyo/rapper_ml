[Verse 2: Too $hort]
She came here with you and left with me
It's all about the game, this ain't destiny
I know you real, but I'm realer
Certified West Coast kitty-kat killer
Yeah, I kill that cat, that's why she feel like that
Ain't no trickin' mane, I still got stacks
Ask anybody, I'm a real-ass mac
And suckers like you, gotta peel off racks and give her that
But don't come too quick 'cause when I hit, I give the bitch long dick
Fuck with me that's all she gon' get, I keep grindin' and I don't quit, bitch

[Pre-Chrorus: Eric Bellinger]
You say have your way
However you want it, however you feel
So I'm cuttin' your cake, like it's my birthday
You drippin' vanilla, told you I'ma pussy killer

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
You tired of that nigga, oh yeah
You lookin' for a real one to treat you like a woman

He ain't long enough, after you fuck, you still horny, damn
Pull up in a Porsche, tell you giddy up
And know I'ma beat the kitty up
I'll freak you right, I will
We fuckin' all night 'til

[Pre-Chrorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You say have your way
However you want it, however you feel
So I'm cuttin' your cake, like it's my birthday
You drippin' vanilla, told you I'ma pussy killer

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Ty Dolla $ign]
Hope it got 9 lives, lives, oh yeah
She know I'ma beat the kitty up
