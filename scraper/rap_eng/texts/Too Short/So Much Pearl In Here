[Intro: Mistah F.A.B.]
Whoa
League of Starz
Damn
Stepped up in this thing
Dnyc3 has signed on
So much pussy in this thing

[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B.]
Hey bruh, it's so much pearl in here
Call little bruh and tell him that his girl's in here
I'm tryin' to pearl somethin', I'm tryin' to poke
My cuddie need a 'wood, who got one, he tryin' to smoke
I'm saucy as dressin', I'm drivin' and textin'
All on Instagram, Straight flexin'
Where your bitch at? I'm tryin' to stretch it
And after I fuck, I ain't stressin'
Tonight, I'm a dyke, I'm on everything movin'
Hut one, hut-hike, audible, let's do it
Cock hound, boy I'm on pussy
Got a bottle, got a pill, got Cookies
And Fabby is sober
But if I give it to this bitch, it's over
She gonna let me pearl
And I'm gonna fuck your girl

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
Bruh, where you at? It's lit
On momma nigga, this thing thick
Man, I heard them suckas up there
I'm serious nigga, it's so much pussy in here
On mommas, it's so much pussy in here
My god, it's so much pussy in here
Oh wow, it's so much pussy in here
Where you at, where you at?
I'm flyin' up there

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Everywhere I go, I see bad ones
Had about seven, you ain't had none
You said, "Give me one playa"
Might be stingy, but I ain't no hater (Biatch)
You act like you don't know
A real pimp'd get his own ho
You wanna have long dough?
Listen to a pro, I know
I'm never home, even though I live in a nice house
I spend a lot of nights out
I let the sexy ones hang
A long time ago I perfected my game
If I want the bitch you'll never get her
You thought she only fucked with square niggas
I told her my name was Todd
She fell in love with a pimp and said, "Oh my God"

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
Bruh, where you at? It's lit
On momma nigga, this thing thick
Man, I heard them suckas up there
I'm serious nigga, it's so much pussy in here
On mommas, it's so much pussy in here
My god, it's so much pussy in here
Oh wow, it's so much pussy in here
Where you at, where you at?
I'm flyin' up there

[Verse 3: Mistah F.A.B.]
Hey, hey what it look like up there?
Heard that thing movin', if it is, I'm there
Let me hop in the shower, hop out, throw on some baby powder
Throw on my True Religions I'll be there in 'bout an hour
Get a table in the middle, so I can see everything
And tell the owner, "We ain't goin' in without a thing"
Little momma, she peepin', I see she jockin'
She freakin' and poppin' she lookin' now she watchin'
Like damn, damn, she so thick
Got me in the club with a hard ass dick
Hell no, um, yeah
Feelin' on her pearl, got her pussy so wet
Like wow, she out here tryin' to function
Asked her "What she doin' later?", she was like "Nothin"
Take down my line, hit my phone
And I'm gonna take you home

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
Bruh, where you at? It's lit
On momma nigga, this thing thick
Man, I heard them suckas up there
I'm serious nigga, it's so much pussy in here
On mommas, it's so much pussy in here
My god, it's so much pussy in here
Oh wow, it's so much pussy in here
Where you at, where you at?
I'm flyin' up there
