[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy
I don't know what the fuck you niggas thought
Y'all niggas hollerin' that "pimpin'" 'cause it sound good
Nigga, back when I was 17, I fuck with my re-up, nigga, I get it out a bitch partna

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Man I can show you how to pimp (I really could)
Betcha you won't comprehend it (Uh uh)
Ain't no pimpin' in your heart, so your heart won't be in it
That's my bitch, she might spread her legs for ya
But I bet your bottom dollar she won't have no bread for ya
Serve 'em Cocktail, yeah, just like my nigga $hort Dog ($hort Dog)
So need a dollar from my bitch? I bet you short, dog
A jack-of-all-trades (Uh huh,) mack of all sort
You throw a one, and I throw that ho a fork
'Cause she done, and well at that
For you to have her sellin' that like crack
Back in my day, on highways and byways
Been up 'bout four, five days
Get a bank roll out the stank ho
Then the Chevy burn rubber sideways
Bitch, if I say (I say) "You on fleek, go pull a trick"
Go hook your lil ass up with your temper, don't be arguin' me
Nigga think they pimpin' 'cause they bitch'll let 'em borrow a hundred dollars
Shorty, shit, I need a quarter mil' tomorrow

[Chorus: Adrian Marcel]
I'll show you how to be a player, swimmin' in these women
Like a motherfucker (Like a motherfucker)
Sippin' on that Slurricane (Whoa)
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em, like a motherfucker (I don't chase 'em baby)
All these bitches know my name
I'm a player in the morning, player in the evening (Player)
Blowin' O.G. I know you see it
Ain't got time for all the games, I'm hustlin' every season
(Ain't got time, ain't got time, ain't got)

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
So you wanna be a player, like Playboy $hort
I done taught more players than a coach on the court
It started many years ago before I started to rap
This player lifestyle, I was born for that
See one thing about me, I love to spit that game
Control her brain, make my ho keep payin'
It was never about the fame, I want the fortune
We ain't splittin' shit, bitch, I want the whole portion
Hoes do what I say, I ain't gotta force 'em
Get a brand new Ferrari, 800 horses
Pimps taught me how to send 'em, before a nigga bend 'em
You'll never get a dime if you rush and stick it in her
So don't sneeze and don't cough, tell her "Break yours off"
Go hard on these hoes, pimp, you can't be soft
We in the V.I.P. blazin' tree
Any nigga that's a hater wasn't raised by me

[Chorus: Adrian Marcel]
I'll show you how to be a player, swimmin' in these women
Like a motherfucker (Like a motherfucker)
Sippin' on that Slurricane (Whoa)
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em, like a motherfucker (I don't chase 'em baby)
All these bitches know my name
I'm a player in the morning, player in the evening (Player)
Blowin' O.G. I know you see it
Ain't got time for all the games, I'm hustlin' every season
(Ain't got time, ain't got time, ain't got)

[Verse 3: E-40]
I'll hypnotize a bitch mind, like a Hindu do a cobra
In my pimp cup I got wine with my lobster from Nova Scotia
These suckas be killin' me, got my name in they teeth
Be all in their fillings, just like some teeth
One thing I don't like is a liar and people stealin' (Stealin')
All I think about is survival and makin' millions (Survival and makin' millions)
My paper bipolar, it's got its ups and its downs
I stay with a toaster, never know who around ('Round)
Baboon pimpin', I be shot callin' (Shot callin')
Give her the 30 second checkin', for reckless eye-ballin' (Ballin')
I come from nothin' now I'm somethin' (Now I'm somethin')
You might wanna wrap your hands around your woman (Around your woman)
Game 201, never trust a bitch (Never trust a bitch)
Pussy got you sprung, now you give her chips
Game 202, never lighten up (Never lighten up)
Go hard on the bitch and keep a pistol on the tuck

[Outro: Adrian Marcel & E-40]
Got that Rollie on my wrist, yeah
Cardier's on Biatch!
Baby hella thick, ass full grown (Full grown)
I'ma slide up in it, how you want girl (How you want, girl)
'Bout to slide up in it, what you want?
I'ma, I'ma when your girl ain't home
But she can get it too and lil' baby at the door, yeah
I'ma slide up in it, how you want it (How you want, girl)
How to be a real player
