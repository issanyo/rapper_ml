[Verse 1]
I met a bad bitch at the strip club
I took her to the house she could get f*cked
The bitch talking about she need big bucks
I pulled out my d*ck she couldn’t get enough
I told her shake that ass get some money hoe
Tell that other n*gga where you want to go
You broke bitch what you want to be a bum for
You got a d*ck in your mouth make it come hoe
Bad bitches get money with it
Broke bitches don’t want to get it
Bad bitches ride new whips
Broke bitch sucking two d*cks
And she really don’t do shit
The bitch drink too much she get too lit
Nothing from me that’s what you get
It won’t take too long to find a new trick

[Verse 2]
Been blowing too much
Been doing too much
I know it’s too much for you to handle
I be feeling like I’m floating get on my hype
If a n*gga talking [?] that’s my hype
She think she the shit she on my hype
You be talking like you with it you on my hype
If you want to do them digits give you my hype
I ain’t worried about no sucker but you my type
Every n*gga standing with my they on my hype

[Verse 3]
Welcome to drug club it’s a safe haven
You not on trial no judgement looks or statements
Patron and Too short running [?] a raven
We with some high boss bitches who don’t need saving
Backwoods is fat like that ass boo
Her crew run through white lines clay matthews
Try to keep up with her but the room a fidget spinner
You a snake f*ck them hating hungry man dinners
Off a gram of molly that bitch he a two
Bonnie and clyde we taking shots in the whip too
She passed out her best friend get on the d*ck too
She woke up and jumped in stupid lit too
