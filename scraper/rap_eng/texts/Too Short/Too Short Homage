[Intro: Too Short]
Say ho

[Verse 1]
I was told not long ago "Dirt Nasty can't rap"
Now every time I grab the mic, you say I'm smoking crack
Five years ago when I met the crew, I knew this shit was major
It was me, Legacy, Mickey, Kev kicking it like big players
Everybody loved our rap like free bags of coke
We rocked house parties in Orange County then fly to Tokyo
You might find me at the mic at the [?] or at the Viper room
All the L.A. girls with their hands in the air
Screaming "Dirt Nasty's a fool"

[Hook: Too Short]
I kick back and let 'em have this dick
I kick back and let 'em have this dick
I kick back and let 'em have this dick

[Verse 2]
I ain't tripping, keep on talking, you say I'm those popping pills
I got money homeboy, I even got a crib in the Hollywood Hills
Well Benz's roll, Beamers suck, and Caddies keep on dipping
Yo mom sucked my dick in the back of Kentucky Fried Chicken
Some say I have a dirty mind, sometimes that might be true
But these are just Dirt Nasty times, I ain't tripping on you
Hollywood, Californ-I-A, I've heard it all before
Chicks with dicks, dude with tits, I'll slap your whore

[Hook: Too Short]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm back on top again, I still don't
Every time I grab the mic, some pussy's getting tapped
"Droppin' Names" took care of that, you know I'm coming up
I got the finest bitch in Hollywood with my hand on her big ass butt
Then you came to my show and stood there like a dick
You said "Dirt Nasty, you smoking", so I had to fuck your bitch

[Hook: Too Short]

[Interlude x2: Too Short]
Can I ask you a question? (Yeah, you)
You like to fuck? (Yeah, you)

[Outro]

The father I never had but always wanted
Yeah, taught me game
