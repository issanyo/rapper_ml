Beyotch!!!
That's the trademark
Short Dog in the house
And it don't stop to the beat baby

Verse 1:
Now take my bitch, she won't complain about shit
Cause I taught her well, she got game for a trick
It ain't hard to tell she belongs to me
I pimped her 15 years in this industry
Now her pussy so big I don't want no mo'
But she still down wit me cuz I raised that ho
Found a bitch in East Oakland broke silly and young
Don't let her fool ya playa, she ain't really dumb
Don't be a sucka and give an old ho new life
She got so much game ya wanna make her your wife
]From California all the way to Miami
I pimped that bitch and now the hoes can't stand me
Cuz when I put my bitch on the streets
Niggas rush to the store cuz they love the beats
We gettin' all the money, we cashin' all the checks
I ain't no fake pimp nigga you can take my bitch

*DJ scratching "Now take my bitch" *

Verse 2:
Now do ya think I get mad when you sport my bitch around town
Never that, cause my bitch is so down
I could send her to Hawaii or out to Nevada
It really don't matta, my pockets get fatta
Used to go to Las Vegas in the early-eighties snortin' Coke
Tryin to turn the ladies on to $hort
It was my destiny to pimp these hoes
(Beyotch) Whole crowd screamin loud at my shows
I've been to every last city with the Dangerous Crew
And everywhere I went the bitch came through
Makin' money like a real good whore
Tell 'em whos your pimp bitch, "Too $hort"
On a ten week run back in eighty-nine
I flipped a brand new Benz, the bitch was so fine
If you want that ho, you can have that bitch
She won't complain about shit

*DJ scratching "Now take my bitch" *

Verse 3:
Now take my bitch, the kind of bitch all pimps want
But if you slip and ya pockets get small ya get done
You got to stay up, fuck tryin to come up
Get your mind off the pussy, always tryin to run up
Cause these bitches like mine, love to work
Get down in the dirt, get money on the turf
Slang that ass for daddy bitch
It's time to get the old caddy whip
One more time, new paint and interior
New rims, new top and a new be-yotch
Thats how you say it right
But $hort Dog say "Beyotch!!" you better make me rich
And thats how it goes, gotta cover every angle
So if ya takin my bitch ain't no need to tangle
Just don't keep braggin' on that used ho
Let em know, you got the bitch from Too $hort
