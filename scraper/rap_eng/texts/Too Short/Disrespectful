Your camel toe reminding me that it’s hump day
HI Ms. Parker you should let me fuck one day
One day or we could get ratchet on a Sunday

You care for some dick without the extra drama

We grown, fuck how them haters feel
I can look in your eyes and tell that you freaky too
Like just imagine things that we can do
Me and you getting down and dirty
You know my mind is muddy
Fucking all over the room
Leaving the blinders nutty
Shoving this thing in you

Treat that pussy like a tangerine
Beat that pussy like a tambourine
You look like you out a magazine
Show you everything you haven’t seen
I know they put you on a pedal stool girl
But when you sick a them niggas I be your medicine girl
I be your nyquil Et cetera and Et cetera girl
I know you wanna slide I'm several steps ahead a you girl
You ain’t got no man looking as good as you are
You ever got bent over on the hood of your car
I don’t mean to come at you foul but I fuck with your style
And I'm in love with your smile
So much so I was wondering if I could cum in yo mouth
I'm sorry come to your house

Shit you might get me evicted if you scream any louder
