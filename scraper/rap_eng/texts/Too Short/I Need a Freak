In these times, of hate and pain
We need a remedy, to take us from the reign
Jealousy, a little greed
I've been thinking, of what I need

I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak, everyday and every night
I need a freak, I really do
I want a freak, one with ass that looks like you
I need a freak, exclusivly
So that she only comes and satisfies me
I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak, everyday and everynight (Help me out!)

I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak everyday and every night
I need a freak, with long long hair
A super freak, in underwear

I need a freak, here what I say
I need a freak, to get me through the day
I need a freak, so I can swerve
I need a super freak, to calm my nerves

Now everyday is the same, I go get me a freak
Take her to my house to we hit the sheets
Got a saltwater fish tank built in the wall
Fat jucuzi tub, sitting in marble
Freaks can't resist, the way it's laid
I spit the game and i got paid
Say Short what you doing with all that stack
Bitch seen all four walls had plaques
She go on and drop them drawls
Don't take to long, she can't stop the law with street player
Short Dogg baby is a
Kyptonite smoked out crazy nigga
I slip some crip on the freak (bitch)
She started licking on my feet
Up to my ears, back down to here
I need a freak everyday and that's real

I need a freak everyday and every night
I need a freak everyday and every night

They say the freaks come out at night
You on my mind, you outta sight
If I don't see ya tonight it ain't on
I take my other little young bitch home
Niggers like me, know just what to do
Me and homie want to fuck with you and your girl
Teach you about the new world
Spit the game like old school perms and curls
Get naked, and do that girl
Keep it right there I got on in the chamber
I aim it at your face and then squeeze the trigger
Can you hang with a freaky ass nigga
She took it all, had a ball
She got nothing but a party y'all
So all you squares and player haters don't sleep
I need a freak

I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak, everyday and every night
I need a freak with long long hair
A super freak, in underwear

I need a freak, I really do
I want a freak, one with ass that looks like you
I need a freak, here what I say
I need a freak, to get me through the day

Short Dogg's in the house
Ya that's right
Players will be players baby
All dogs must chase the cat
Famous words
We going to get off into this X-rated shit
Ant Banks, can i flip the script?
If you break the beat down I'm going to come back, watch
So break it down, watch
We're going to break it down old school style
This is the old school type right?
Short Dogg's in the house representing East Oakland West Coast
This is a West Coast thang Bitch!
I need a motherfucking bitch, you know what I'm saying
So we're going to call this part two
It's called "I Need A Bitch"

I need a bitch, to hold me tight
I need a bitch to suck my dick every night (every night)
I need a bitch, I need to get paid
I need a bitch, tonight Short Dogg's getting laid (that's right)
I need a bitch, you all here me talking

I need a bitch, I really do
I want a nasty ass bitch that acts like you, Bitch!
