[Too $hort:]
I hope you wanna do the same thing I wanna do
Do you want me the same way I want you?
I like you so much baby but I won't touch
Until you say it's time to leave here and go fuck
You do it so right I could never say it's wrong
I like the way you act when they play your favorite song
You scream out loud, start dancin' hella wild
Girl right now I wanna pull your panties down
Fuck you real good down low on the flo'
Fuck you on the stage like we puttin' on a show
Fuck you in the stall in the men's bathroom
Outside in the car, we can do that too
I'll drive you to the house, dick sucked gettin' head
Play with your pussy then fuck you in the bed
After all that fuckin' I'ma fall asleep in it
Wake up in the mornin' and fuck you in the kitchen

[Chorus:]
Girl I like it when you do it like that
I like the way you shake and you bounce that back
I like the way it looks 'cause your booty so fat
I'd like to take you home girl and move in that crack
I like it when them cheeks jump up and down
I like it when you drop and make it touch the ground
You lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back
Just don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that

[Too $hort:]
I know you with your man, other niggas gon' stare
I don't really care, I'm a motherfuckin' player
I never tell you stop, I wanna see you keep goin'
Got a dance so cold, I swear it be snowin'
Even though it's hella hot in here, everybody sweatin' you
Half wanna dance, other half wanna get with you
Every time a nigga walk by and say hello
Starin' at your booty 'cause it moves like jello
Now I'm really feelin' like you need my service
Jealous boyfriend, I can see him gettin' nervous
You don't even notice 'cause you doin' your thang
Shouldn't have came here with him, you knew he couldn't hang
I love the view, but that just ain't enough
I can hear it beepin' like you backin' up a truck
You need a special permit to operate that ass
I'ma hit it right girl and make it last

[Chorus:]
Cause I like it when you do it like that
I like the way you shake and you bounce that back
I like the way it looks 'cause your booty so fat
I'd like to take you home girl and move in that crack
I like it when them cheeks jump up and down
I like it when you drop and make it touch the ground
You lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back
Just don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that

[Dolla Will:]
It's on once again, come and roll with a pimp
I ain't mad at ya girl, get your money, go and strip
Extra shots of Patr-n just in case you wanna sip
Smokin' grapes, pay security so they won't trip
The way you're dancin', how ya move your body so swift
Ass big enough to hold a glass with no coaster
Seen a little bit of cash now you're movin' closer
If you wanna we can leave from here and go somewhere
(That's right) It ain't nothin 'cause I'm into that
I'm tryin' to see if me, you and your girlfriend can interact
Treat 'em like drinks, if they ain't right then I send 'em back
Gotta be jazzy, can't have the shoes without the bag (Dolla)

[Too $hort:]
I wanna send a special shoutout
To all the females with the matchin' bags, purses, shoes
All the accessories... I like that shit

[Chorus:]
Girl I like it when you do it like that
I like the way you shake and you bounce that back
I like the way it looks 'cause your booty so fat
I'd like to take you home girl and move in that crack
I like it when them cheeks jump up and down
I like it when you drop and make it touch the ground
You lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back
Just don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that
