[Verse 1:]
Shut up b! tch, you talk too much
Getting on my nerves, you're so irritating
Using too many words and my ears can't take it
And your voice is kinda loud too
What else can that mouth do
You like cum? Tell her what it tastes like
You keep some on your tongue make you stay quiet
What? Better not hate me
Cause you still gotta [?] still gotta penny
What's my fee? I charge what you earn, you're so lucky
You get the cargo the sperm
Now it's all in your sperm, got you acting crazy like you smoking sherm
But all I smoke is the kush
You need to shut your mouth b! tch, hush!

[Hook: Kokane]
She talk to fucking much, she just don't wanna shut up, (Nancy)
You need to shut your mouth, cause you talk too fucking much, (Nancy)
You fucking all that stuff, b! tch don't pick it up (Nancy)
I just can't be with you
Cause you run your mouth too much, can you feel me?

[Verse 2:]
You know me, I'm always clowning
But now Nancy, that b! tch is always frowning
And now, she don't even like to smile
She just makes me face and talks too loud
Shut up Nancy, you getting on my nerves
Too many adjectives and not enough verbs
Every time you speak, all you do is babble
We ain't at the house playing scrabble, b! tch
Fuck you, and fuck your opinion
Cause I just fuck this big butt Dominican
And hit that shit from a lot of angles
She ain't speak English, just body language
So we ain't have to say nothing
Just stay up all night fucking
Nancy, you can never ever feel like us
You need to shut your mouth b! tch, hush!

[Hook:]
She talk to fucking much, she just don't wanna shut up, (Nancy)
You need to shut your mouth, cause you talk too fucking much, (Nancy)
You fucking all that stuff, b! tch don't pick it up (Nancy)
I just can't be with you
Cause you run your mouth too much, can you feel me?

[Verse 3:]
Shut up Nancy, you're such a disgrace
Talk shit to me, you get fucked in the face
I don't care b! tch, tell them that
My name is Too $hort, who the fuck you yelling at?
Fuck with me, you being the silence of the lambs
Your boyfriend left, you can't find another man
You're too upset to play with yourself
So you never have sex, remember how it felt?
When you used to get kissed on those lips
But now all you do is talk shit
You need to wipe your mouth with some toilet paper
Turn up the lights and drink [?]
Cause you already know what's up
I'm trying to get you drunk and when you're throwing up
Just spit out all them words and flush
Shut your mouth b! tch, hush!

Can you feel me?

[Hook:]
She talk to fucking much, she just don't wanna shut up, (Nancy)
You need to shut your mouth, cause you talk too fucking much, (Nancy)
You fucking all that stuff, b! tch don't pick it up (Nancy)
I just can't be with you
Cause you run your mouth too much
