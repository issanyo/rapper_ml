Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
With his gangsta waves and gangsta hoods
He made friends with dealers and crooks
And when the party was on you knew he had come
It is like Gladis Knight and its five oh ones
Walking right up to the dj man
And give another emcee's rap
Cuz they knew about him and his gangsta rap
The fact they just couldn't manage that
He was known around to be the best
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
In a land where whips will watch the car
Tell you everything and they still want more
Where life is only give and take
In a land where the strong control the fake
He was known around for all the time
Everybody went wild when he said his rhyme
Said things that would never been thought out
With his gangsta ride his turned that town so out
Like Jesse James in a land
Where game that controls the lane
Yes the wild wild west that's the place
Suckers take a bite and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
When the sun rolls out every chance it get
The wild wild west that's where you see
Emcee rappers make you look like weak
Cuz you would never hang in the wild wild west
Without your six-shooter and your bulletproof vest
You can get down but I don't know where
You come out here you better act square
Cuz we don't play don't come my way
When you sucker wanna front you'll hear me say
"Front me" 'cuz you'll front yourself
I'll leave you standing there mad as hell
You can rap your best that's what you do
But you just can't hang and you know its true
Like a homeboy said its one two three
West coast raps straight to the beat
You got have a lot of game to spit that rap
I wanna put a little game to you just like that
Too $hort I thought you knew
You can't count three and then skip two
It just won't work but you might try
To front a emcee from Seventy Five

Girls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh
Emcee rap through the wild wild west
Making you look weak cuz we don't play
All you sucker emcee's do you hear me say
Front me... front me...

Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
With his non-stop rapping and his west coast style
He had the whole damn party just going wild
Singing rhymes all time back to back
Turning every party out with the west coast rap
That's when the sucker emcees all came to be
Nothing but everyday sucker emcee's
They were all his friends all his fans
Walk right up and shake his hand
And you always knew everytime
Sucker emcee's wish they could rhyme
Just like pimp but what's the fact
The fact they just couldn't hang with that
They were all frustrated, all rapped out
Didn't even know what to rap about
Homeboys, do you agree
Ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucker emcee
Cuz much come fresh and all sound bad
Sucker emcee's couldn't make him mad
With a rap like his, a rap like that
There never was time for a sucker to rap
The sucker emcee would just wait his turn
Sucker emcee's don't wanted to get burned
What emcee knew the play
He had the sucker emcee's all running away
Didn't want none you couldn't bring them back
They never could deal with a real big mack
One emcee was the best
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
There was one emcee who knew the tip
And the sucker emcees don't even trip
So tell it to the world it's not too wise
To front an emcee from Seventy Five

Girls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh
Emcee rap through the wild wild west
Making you look weak cuz we don't play
Sucker emcee's do you hear me say
Front me... front me...

Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
Just a true emcee didn't pass the test
Singing raps like this all rated X
Hanging like a champ with a heavyweight rap
No emcee could rock like that
Then the boy got paid again and again
Saying he wouldn't stop till he got a Benz
I never thought about it till the other day
He had top drop rolling away
In a eighty five or eighty six
Said he got paid cuz he rapped like this
You could see it in his eyes he was seeing stars
Shoes, [?] and caviars
Just checking out the girls walking down the street
In the wild wild west that's where you see
The freshest emcees you will say is soft
From Seventy Five Girls so raw
Like Silky C and hollywood
They come so fresh cuz you know they could
Like sir Too $hort when I'm on the mic
West coast rappers rap all damn night
So watch how you talk in the wild wild west
East coast rappers make us look fresh
With the "say ho and everybody scream"
East coast rappers make all the green
With a New York rap and a New York slang
Not too many could spit that game
Now the time has come and I'll tell it right
About a rapper like me who will rock the mic
I'm trying to wake you up on the western coast
Were giving you more than just the most
Its everything you could never have
You can spend your money and buy my rap
The wild wild west that's what its called
About the west coast rappers that stand so tall
The freshest emcees you'll say you saw
From Seventy Five Girls, so raw
Wild wild west
