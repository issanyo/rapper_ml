[Chorus: Dre Stylez]
Dance like you fuckin’
Dance like you fuckin’
Bad bitches, dance like you fuckin’
Dance like you fuckin’
Pump it, shake it, wiggle it, drop it, back it up, arch that back
Shake it, twerk it, work it, fuck it, bend over, hoes, now smile for the camera
You freaky, one cheek, you freaky, two cheeks
You freaky, for real, you freaky, who freaky, you freaky, you freaky, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don’t stop making that booty bounce
Shake that ass, girl, move it around
I’ma stand back and give you some room
Wiggle them cheeks, I see what you’re doing
You gotta grab that ass and make it shake
Keep it right here, don’t take it away
‘Cause I’m on that, tryna get that
She too wild for you, you better get back
She’ll break your dick tryna hit that
Fuck around and get your shit cracked
What happened? The bitch sprained it, mayne
She rode it so hard now it ain’t the same
(Dance like you fuckin’) And she ain’t playin’
Put her on a dick and she’ll go insane
All I wanna do is get some lovin’
But she can’t stop dancing like she fuckin’
Get it, girl

[Chorus: Dre Stylez]
Dance like you fuckin’
Dance like you fuckin’
Bad bitches, dance like you fuckin’
Dance like you fuckin’
Pump it, shake it, wiggle it, drop it, back it up, arch that back
Shake it, twerk it, work it, fuck it, bend over, hoes, now smile for the camera
You freaky, one cheek, you freaky, two cheeks
You freaky, for real, you freaky, who freaky, you freaky, you freaky, yeah

[Verse 2]
Don’t stop making that booty bounce
Shake that ass, girl, move it around
When her song come on, she get down on the ground
It’s too much—what you gon’ do with it now?
She know what I’m on, I’m tryna get her in the bed
Lick a nigga balls, give a nigga head
Make a nigga cum then lick it up
Let’s do it all again—can a nigga fuck?
She said, “Nope”, I had to get some cowboy boots and some rope
She like to get her hair pulled back and get choked
Spank her on her ass then watch the bitch go
You ain’t seen nothin’ when she dance like she fuckin’
Hand in her pants acting like she cummin’
I put her up against the wall, let her grind on my balls
Pussy hella wet and she ain’t wearing no drawers
Get it, girl

[Chorus: Dre Stylez]
Dance like you fuckin’
Dance like you fuckin’
Bad bitches, dance like you fuckin’
Dance like you fuckin’
Pump it, shake it, wiggle it, drop it, back it up, arch that back
Shake it, twerk it, work it, fuck it, bend over, hoes, now smile for the camera
You freaky, one cheek, you freaky, two cheeks
You freaky, for real, you freaky (BITCH!)
Arch that back…
