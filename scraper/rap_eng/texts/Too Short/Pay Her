[Chorus]
Back in the day, we ain't give a ho shit
Nowadays all these niggas do is trick
Pay her (Pay her), pay her (Pay her)
Pay her, what happened to the players? (Where they at?)
When I was comin' up, real macks said, "Fuck it"
Nowadays, y'all put the pussy in the budget
Pay her (Pay her), pay her (Pay her)
Pay her, what happened to the players? Playa

[Verse 1]
I'm a player, baby, and don't you forget it
I ride Benzes and Porches, no Honda Civics
I will not pay for pussy, that's a "no can do"
Because where I was raised, that's what no man do (Oakland)
I got a gang of bitches and hoes galore
You might get a lot of pussy, but for sure I get more
I'll give you a bitch before I give you a blunt
'Cause I still get funky like "Female Funk"
What I look like, given her half my scratch?
Like she wrote my raps, I don't get down like that
I was born to mack, and I'ma die that way
I could give a motherfuck if she died today
They say I'm one cold invividual (Individual)
They say that "Too $hort'll stomp down a ho" (Stomp her down, down)
Bitches know, they best not ask
Spend my cash, I'll put a foot in your ass

[Chorus]
Back in the day, we ain't give a ho shit
Nowadays all these niggas do is trick
Pay her (Pay her), pay her (Pay her)
Pay her, what happened to the players? (Where they at?)
When I was comin' up, real macks said, "Fuck it"
Nowadays, y'all put the pussy in the budget
Pay her (Pay her), pay her (Pay her)
Pay her, what happened to the players? Playa

[Verse 2]
Am I supposed to feel guilty? (No)
Do these bitches make me filthy?
Yeah, rich that is
I had a good night, my bitch got tricks (Get it)
I ain't talkin' 'bout playin' games
Real pimp shit, I ain't sayin' names
We goin' straight to the top
I'm still pimpin', I tried to stop
I told my mama, "I won't pimp no more"
Then I took your bitch, and I sent your ho
I thought about the promise I made
Lyin' to my momma 'bout how I got paid (Pimpin')
I told her my bitches was singers
Signed to my label, I was crossin' my fingers
When I lied about my women
I didn't want to see her cry, but I can't stop pimpin' (Bitch)

[Chorus]
Back in the day, we ain't give a ho shit
Nowadays all these niggas do is trick
Pay her (Pay her), pay her (Pay her)
Pay her, what happened to the players? (What happened?)
When I was comin' up, real macks said, "Fuck it"
Nowadays, y'all put the pussy in the budget
Pay her (Pay her), pay her (Pay her)
Pay her, what happened to the players? Playa

[Verse 3]
I always got stacks of hunds
My bitch better make 20 racks a month (She better)
And when I got shows to do
I knock bitches, and my hoes recruit
I need cash, I gotta have it
I love gettin' money, I can't kick the habit (I can't kick it)
I'm not hooked on drugs
But I hang out with a lotta crooks and thugs (From The Town)
I never sold dope
But I'd sell my bitch to the pope
Ain't no hope (Can't save me), you can't save me momma
They won't stop, I get paid 'cause they wanna
Give daddy, all that dough
And if a trick mothafucka don't call my ho
She'll put two feet down on the pavement (On the pavement)
Or I'll drag her by the hair like a caveman (Like a caveman)

[Chorus]
Back in the day, we ain't give a ho shit
Nowadays all these niggas do is trick
Pay her (You better pay her), pay her (You better pay her)
Pay her, what happened to the players? (What happened to 'em?)
When I was comin' up, real macks said "Fuck it"
Nowadays, y'all put these hoes in the budget
Pay her (Pay that bitch), pay her (Pay the bitch)
Pay her, what happened to the players? Playa
