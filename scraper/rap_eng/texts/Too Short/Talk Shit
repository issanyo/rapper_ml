[Verse 1]
It was me young chief and too short OG
I’m on three tron shots f*cked up low key smoke tree
If you kickin it it’s all on me told her all she gotta do is just roll my weed
Since way back said I was the man they ain’t get a jet
Lames hating on the internet tell me get a check
I don’t do swishers and I don’t pull a matter west
Put it on [?] so I’m throwing up the west
You bitch get a check up you don’t get no love in your city get your respect up
I put it on never changed never switched
I’m the same one who brought 2 chains to the rich
Like in front of John’s house RIP to Wallace
My kicks collection can pay your way through college hit the bank and make deposits
Gang reppin heart breakers that’s the squad I’m a rep that shit on God

[Hook]
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit

[Verse 2]
Sticking to the plan what you n*ggas want
Dope [?] fifty grand that’s every month
Try to burn the shop down lil p*ssy c*nt
Three hundred thousand dollars worth of cars in the front
Same block I bought buse and mac dre
Same shop my gold and platinum plaque hang
Same corner I used to sell marijuana
Running marathons on your bitch boy you still want her
I’m not a biter I’m a writer for myself and others
If I say a dre line I’m bigging up my brother
Big enough to do it big in up my burrough
Plus I know my own rhyme and still foolish stupid hyphy movement
Who does it you does it still use it don’t confuse it
North Oakland mayor bring the town back
And tell your favorite rapper give my style back

[Hook]
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit
Get yo money up if you want to talk shit

[Outro]
