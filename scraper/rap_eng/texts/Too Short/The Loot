[Ant Banks]
Yeah, we got my nigga Short Dog in the motherfucking house
Telling y'all niggas about that loot
Cause you don't know nothing about that, you know?
Do it to 'em

[Too $hort]
I used to be a broke-ass nigga from the Oaktown
Remember Too $hort? Bitch I ain't broke now
I sold 6 million albums since I got my start
I be all up and down them Billboard charts
That shit is easy, fucking with the Dangerous Crew
And kick back while I tell you about making the loot
Get in where you fit if you making it fast
Cause a real motherfuck might check your ass
Take all your loot, kick down your door
The word got around you's a bitch-ass ho
Hanging with these same ass niggas that owe you cash
That won't pay your ass
Them niggas just owe you for life
Be all in your face every day and night
If you'd have broke their ass off years ago
For fucking off all them counts of dough
You wouldn't be a broke-ass nigga today
(I'm a get that shit back) Well I'd figure you'd say that
Cause you go way back, rewind and play it back
You just a fat fucking needle in the haystack
They should've just named you jack
Cause you ain't never gonna get that back
So reminice on the things you had
Cause you having money was just a fad

[Ant Banks]
That's right (Bitch)
Either roll thick, or suck a fat dick (Gotta get my loot)
And niggas can't fuck with that (Gotta get my loot)

[Too $hort]
You working every day and can't never gat ahead in life
Stop punking out running cause you're scared to fight
You hang with nine broke niggas, you know the rest
Kiss a fake nigga ass and give a ho respect
Lying all the time about your cash flow
And talking about shit that you think you know
Well motherfucker if you only knew
You made the next nigga rich while he stole your loot
You've been hoeing so long I bet you feel like a bitch
Why can't niggas like you get rich?
Cause you gotta be a hustler, can't be a buster
You ever get a ho, nigga, please don't trust her
Used to be rapping, now you slanging dope
Stressing so hard you want to hang your hope
Dreamed of owning a house, maybe two or three cars
Come up like a motherfucking movie star
But the shit ain't happened yet
And I'm an old-school rappin' vet
You trying to get your loot, I say you ain't some
Niggas get their cash, and some can't
Short Dog on the mic, watch me gank this bitch
All that shit you doing, boy you can't get rich
But don't give up, just stop faking the shit
Get off your ass and start making it, biiiitch!

[Ant Banks]
That's right (Bitch)
Either roll thick, or suck a fat dick (Gotta get my loot)
And niggas can't fuck with that, you know? (Gotta get my loot)
