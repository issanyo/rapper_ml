Man, I need to get me one of those
Long hair half braids, california girls..

[Hook]
California girls (I can't forget about the)
Middwest ladies, down south East coast
All around the world
Every city I'm gone get me a California girl (I can't forget about the)
Midwest ladies, down south East coast
All around the world, every city I'm gone get me..

[Too $hort]
A California girl
Take her to the airport, trips around the world
Love to twirle ya fingure tips around the curles
Call ya momma up, tell her you found a girl
Move her outa Cali, take her to ya city
Big ring, big weddin, she's lookin so pretty
I know ya'll wanna, girl from California
It's all in ya eyes you wanna try to put it on her
Go hit the beach, you'll see em' every where
If they ain't choosin on a playa, we neva care
We got so many of em', thick ones, skinny ones
You came to California didn't have any fun
How that sound, famous words of a lame that couldn't hang
These ladies from the west got game
Who got the best, VA, DC, Georgia, New York, Texas, Louisiana, or Florida
The Middwest got some super notches
You eva seen Cali's finest, man, who could top us
A Cali girl you neva seen nutten like her
Walk into her room smile and make you ride her

Where you from, the other side of town ain't far
I pick you up later ride around in my car
With the music loud smile while I check you out
Thinkin to myself how can I get you now
To me my number one you kno where I'm commin from
Keep you shinnin baby like a bunch of summer fun
I know that look, I seen it, a million times
Wake up first thing, and you still be fine
Are you a Cali girl, long hair, pretty eyes
And them thighs, dont you just love city life
What chu mixed with, whats yo nationality
Thats the kinda thing you gotta ask a Cali freak
Just gimmie time, I know what I'm suposed to say

You get that dyme peice treatment every where you go
The Cali flavor all the real playas know
