[Intro: Colonel Loud]
Stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California,  young California
Ayy California,  young California

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Yeah I'm high but I'm focused
Cali loud, Cali [?], Cali my shit
I created the Young California [?]
Way back when I was just [?] homie thought I was playin'
I run this shit little nigga
They talk but don't make no digits
We brought it back from the graves
[?]
Mind at a different place, really trynna be great
Started my own label I'm signin' artists today
We the new Cash Money, the new Roc-A-Fella
Wanna get it on your own? Really I can tell you
Keep your soul never sell it
Cause they gon trynna steel
A lot of y'all chasin' your tails to sign a deal
But I'm here in The Bay, this that independant cap
Where Short and 40 Water really put us on the map
Now I'm the new face I don't care what you say
I'm a California great I hold it down for the Bay
Aye!


[Hook: Colonel Loud]
Stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California,  young California
Ayy California,  young California


[Verse 2: AD]
Transcribing...
Bet these niggas don't like me now
Hype me now, Boosie swag wipe me down
Let em know from the hoods to the hyphy towns
Fuck em all, they don't like our sound
Bay to LA

[Hook: Colonel Loud]
Stay getting that work in California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California,  young California
Ayy California,  young California
