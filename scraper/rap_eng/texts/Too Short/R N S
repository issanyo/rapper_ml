[Verse 1]
Catch the finest niggas that was firing at you niggas
Instead of fine at them niggas snitch
You wored a wire on them niggas you is a bitch
Not from my side, I’m tired of this nigga shit
How you niggas just swell up on niggas
When them suckas slide through you be telling on niggas
No fom, red flag you be jaling with niggas
At the same time making statements and telling on niggas
Shit I’m sticking to the roof say hate or love me
Heard em rocking with some snitches cause he got him some money
Real gangstas was the snitches that be looking too funny
Mass splinter the only rat that post to have him some money
Real talk I screw boys like the fire to them joint
If a nigga catching bodies then I body them lawyers
If they don’t sell [?] then we fucking extort
When my nigga touchdown then like fuck em reward

[Hook]

And you can catch ten from a real nigga whip

[Verse 2]
