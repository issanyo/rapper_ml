[Intro]
Don't act like that
Whassup wit you? Whassup?
That's a bad lil' beotch

Lil' shorty got a nasty lil' dance
With a whole lot of ass in them pants
Do you think I'm a passionate man?
Ice cold player with a master plan
A lot of females just don't know
That lil' shorty got her own dough
When I met her it was on right away
If I was married, I'd leave my wife today
Light-skinned with the curly hair
Did my finger like this and said "Girl come here"
She's on South Beach, havin lunch with a dude
I whispered in her ear "Later on come through"

[Interlude]
Come on yo shorty we can kick it baby
You know that I'm with it
You can hit me on my phone
We can do it all night long

[Chorus]
(She said) ohh, yeah I really wanna rock your world
Get to know you boy I'll be your girl
Trust me baby you'll be satisfied
You'll be mine tonight
(She said) ohh, yeah I really wanna rock your world
Get to know you boy I'll be your girl
Trust me baby you'll be satisfied
You'll be mine tonight boy

That lil' shorty is well stacked
Her shoes, her purse and her belt match
Hella cute even in the morning
A super top notch, better get up on 'em
Ass fat, she's a class act
Menage-a-trois, she don't have that
She's all about them dimes and pennies
Tens and twenties, hundreds and fifties
Whatever you got she'll take it
Make a nigga stop, drop and get naked
I guess it's just a sign of the times
Cause shorty got a crib that's as fly as mines

[Chorus]
Lil' shorty is a freak mayne
Gamed up with the street game
Did a lot and left me wantin mo'
Lil' shorty ain't no punk hoe
I don't sip fine wine or drink champagne
Don't mix with fake hoes that think I'm payin
But I do like women, that know about pimpin
Keep gettin money so we don't stop spendin
Lil' shorty knows my background
I was raised out West in a mack's town
I wanna get some money and have fun wit'chu
Lil' shorty what'chu wanna do?

[Chorus]
[Outro]
Let's make it happen!
Smoke one wit'cha potnah mayne
Roll another one
We still blowin
Yeah, we got some real players up in this motherfucker right now
Too $hort representin the real players
Where you at?
