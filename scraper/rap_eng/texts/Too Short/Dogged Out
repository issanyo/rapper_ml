[Intro: Too $hort (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Bitch you knew I was a dog when you met me
How you gonna get mad at me now?
Cause I got bitches.. everywhere
Bitch I'm a player, y'know
(Y'know, killa, y'know'I'msayin'
I said shit, I said, that's dat monster dog shit, y'know'I'msayin'
This is all dedicated to all you hoes)
And bitches

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Shame on a nuh, who tried to step TUH
The Ol' Dirty Bas, put my foot up your UHH
Bitch, you walk around with your bra too tight (beitch)
It's alright, you still gon' get fucked tonight
Hoeeeeee! (bitch fucky) Stinkin ass ho!
You're the type of bitch don't appreciate shit
Never had shit, so you won't be shit
That pussy there, couldn't satisfy a hair
On my body, treat me like a lolli and slob me doooooown (beitch)
And Doo Doo Brown! (beitch) Hehahahaha
Tossed salad, oh you in some shit now
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out
Here comes Rover, sniffin' at your ass
Pardon me bitch, as I shit on your grass
That means ho, you been shit-ted on!
I'm not the first dog that's shitted on your lawn

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out

[Verse 2: Big Syke]
Right behind my pitbull, full grown
That wanna make the cat moan all night long
Puppy don't take me wrong, but it's on
Be monkeys up, so call me king kong
Get gone with the thong, crew comin' through
Big Syke daddy with the Brooklyn Zu
You know what to do, freaky sucky sucky
Won't you show the crew how you play wit' the monkey
Let him see you don't fake it, and you can take it
It's only the bigger bone, gotta make it
Baby shake it in the worst way, OK
Up in you in the parle
My forte is a freakyness, look at this
I don't kiss anythin' that I don't miss, runnin' sense
To get licked from the nuts to the crack of my butt
I'm a dog, so what, but you still give it up, Wu/woof

[Hook]
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dog out
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dogged alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Beitch, this is what I tell these hoes
Don't sweat it baby, you'll never be my lady
Take this bone, straight to the dome
And get on (get on), cause I don't wanna talk
Shut the fuck up if you done wanna walk
We on the same page? I thought so
You know them big dogs hit you wit' their paw ho
Big pimp (pimpin') jump the fence
Hoppin' all night it don't make no sense (na na)
From New York to Cali', whylin' (wild)
I got the bitch in the alley howlin' (beitch)
And she don't wanna go nowhere
She got love for a player she don't know no better
That's why I tell her (tell her)
I'd be wid you forever if I could find time to put you
In my schedule (beitch)
Beitch, $hort Dog in the house

[Hook]
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
She flew in like calm breeze
Tall brown skin, her weave like palm trees
I went coconuts
Dipped my dunkin' between your Donut
Don't want it if it ain't no slut, bitch!
Fathership touch ground, like fly on soup
Don't invite me I tear the fuck down
White boys cut my toupee!
Seventh day raster, or scream play
I slump MC slay, it ain't nuttin' to bust ass
Bullet him, get him fast
Bitch I don't break out, blast to the next rash
The dog piss on MC's like trees
Got meals but still grill that old good welfare cheese

[Hook]
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard, of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out
