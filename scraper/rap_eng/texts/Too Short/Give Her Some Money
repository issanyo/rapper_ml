[Intro]
(Helluva made this beat, baby)

[Chorus]
She ain't doing shit for a nigga that's broke
But if the money's right, she'll drop and do the splits
She can make a dick disappear like magic
All you gotta do is tell her that you wanna trick
They gon' talk down 'cause she dancing on the pole
Call her what you want but you can't call her broke
You could tell she 'bout money when she walk through the door
Call her what you want but you can't call her broke
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'
Give that bitch some money

[Verse 1]
Closed mouths don't get fed, you better ask for somethin'
God ain't give you all that ass for nothin'
She got way more curves than the average bitch
She could walk down the street and cause accidents
She got ass like a half a horse
Make a married man wanna file divorce
I heard she wore a tight dress to the church Sunday
And had the preacher trying to spend all that church money

[Chorus]
She ain't doing shit for a nigga that's broke
But if the money's right, she'll drop and do the splits
She can make a dick disappear like magic
All you gotta do is tell her that you wanna trick
They gon' talk down 'cause she dancing on the pole
Call her what you want but you can't call her broke
You could tell she 'bout money when she walk through the door
Call her what you want but you can't call her broke
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'
Give that bitch some money

[Verse 2]
E-mail in her bio, tryna get booked
She a bad bitch, keep it real and she cook
Probably paid for that ass, is it real as it look?
I just wanna see if it feel like it looks
Spend some money on her, appreciation
She gon' bring her friend with her, initiation
I'ma get some head from 'em, meditation
Then give 'em that dope dick, medication

[Chorus]
She ain't doing shit for a nigga that's broke
But if the money's right, she'll drop and do the splits
She can make a dick disappear like magic
All you gotta do is tell her that you wanna trick
They gon' talk down 'cause she dancing on the pole
Call her what you want but you can't call her broke
You could tell she 'bout money when she walk through the door
Call her what you want but you can't call her broke
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'
Give that bitch some money

[Verse 3]
You ain't spendin' no money, what you doin' in here?
She been working in the club every day for a year
You need to go back home if you can't get no cash
She give your dirty ass a lapdance and catch a rash
She a hustler, I can't say the same for you
Get a peek at the pussy is what you came to do
You full of shit, keep saying you don't her to dance
You can't be here if you don't come with no bands

[Outro]
Give that bitch some money, she deserve it
Give that bitch some money, she be workin'
Give that bitch some money
Shoutout to the real ones that know how to get it
Get your money, girl
Give that bitch some money
