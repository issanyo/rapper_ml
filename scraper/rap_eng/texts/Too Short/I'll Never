[Hook]
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man

[Verse 1]
We kick it and our vibe is cool
But that don’t mean you my boo
I can’t be no fool
Don’t ask why I look so cool
I rather be a wolf than a fool
I can’t be your boo
Her vibe wavy we fuck better
Push each other to do much better
Aye why tryna squash me out
The chemistry is popping I ain’t tryna test it out
You see your title won’t stop me from fucking another bitch
I done been in words with chick without the shit
Cut all my bitches off on New year’s Eve
No hard feelings baby  do your thing yeah
We friends now we both doing so there’s no need to pretend now
I been seeing you late night in a Benz clown
Tell me my new bitch you ain’t nothing but a friend now
I shake them hamma through my man’s now

[Hook]
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man

[Verse 2]
I been around the corner and that pussy ain’t worth the image
You just a ghetto bitch, fuck you
Aye I’m a discuss you
I fucked yo friend and never even discuss you
Love too stressful, never again
We on a roll baby let’s just get to the bread
Listen to your brain, not emotion
You gon start getting petty she gon start roll a coffin
You bitch ain’t silent she snoop quicker
She will ignore every word [?]
You can move in yours nigga just your turn
It might take a couple years but nigga you gon learn
Last week you had a boyfriend you not smooth
But you only fuck with me bitch deja vu
You’ve entitles me to headaches, fuck all that
Just let me slide through so I can fuck all that

[Hook]
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
I’ll neva be your man

[Bridge]
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it
Can’t, can’t, I can’t do it

[Outro]
