[Pastor & (Too Short)]
We're gathered here today
To witness the greatest historical marital ceremony of our time
The legendary, honorable Too $hort a.k.a. $hort Dog has proposed to the game
And before we go into the attributes of the game
I've got to give you a scripture
About the emotional mathematics that a fully qualified player has to go through on a daily basis
And there was a scripture in the Mac Bible, Page 211, Chapter 187, Verse 10, that clearly states:
He who trusts a ho shall surely be broke
$hort Dog, do you promise to honor, cherish, and retrospect this game through punishment, incarceration, and pain?
(You know I do)
Do you, $hort Dog, promise to honor, retrospect the fact that a bitch don't belong to you, she belongs to the game?
(Fa sho)
Do you, $hort Dog, retrospect, recognize that you can't make a tramp a champ
Even if the bitch was trained and conditioned by boxing's legendary Angelo Dundee
The bitch'll still be a bust
Oh, $hort Dog (What's up, mayne?)
Do you honor and retrospect this game? (Fa sho)
Put your right hand in the air and solemnly swear
That you'll never put a bitch before a soldier (Never)
So by the power of the game invested in me, I announce $hort Dog officially official
With a clear understanding that I'd never give a bitch sweat off my balls if she was choking in the desert on a peanut butter sandwich
I said he's official like a Shiite Muslim with a nuclear missile
$hort Dog has earned every aspect of this game to be married to the game
And I accept the honor and the respect that one gangsta to another, from one man to another
We are officially bonded, between the game (Biatch)
Married, married, married, married, married to the game
