[Verse 1]
You got an attitude for no reason, always mad at the world
Like a TV show on some stupid shit with all these bad ass girls
Your specialty is hanging out, making sure nobody fucks
When the job is done, you’re on the low
You ain’t nothin’but a nasty slut, you don’t give a fuck
I know you like to taste that nut
Put a dick on your face then bust
Keep talkin’ that shit, say what
I’m layin’ in the cut ‘bout to raise up
You can act mad but I’m not foul
I came on your face and got you a towel
Like a gentleman, kissed her hand and I’m gone
I gotta leave before her man gets home

[Chorus]
Sloppy second leftovers, turned her into a deep throater
The money shot, it’s the money shot
Sloppy second leftover, I’m already on to the next hoe
The money shot, it’s the money shot

[Verse 2]
I do it like my homeboy One Stop
I bust on these bitches, let ‘em cum swap
I call that the money shot
Give it to her, she ain’t ever gon’ wanna stop
Two hot chicks and me
When I fuck, the mega number is three
Fuck that one-on-one
I’m a porn star, that ain’t no fun
I like girl-on-girl
Do the 69 while you lick that pearl
Two hoes in the bed, I love it, I’m getting double head
Four lips, two tongues
All this freaky shit—is this too fun?
Better hurry up and get you some
‘Cause when I’m gone, ain’t none

[Chorus]
Sloppy second leftovers, turned her into a deep throater
The money shot, it’s the money shot
Sloppy second leftover, I’m already on to the next hoe
The money shot, it’s the money shot

[Bridge]
Gag, gag, choke and spit
Take it out your mouth, girl, stroke that dick
Come on, come on
Gag, gag, choke and spit
Take it out your mouth, girl, stroke that dick
Come on, come on
Sloppy second leftovers

[Verse 3]
Sperm in your face, I ain’t mad at you
Fuck broke bitches with an attitude
Camera zoomed in when I wanna pop
Girl, smile, it’s called the money shot
And can’t nobody call you a whore
Kiss your boyfriend when you walk in the door
Tell him what you did to make all that money
Square ass niggas, y’all funny
That’s my bitch
