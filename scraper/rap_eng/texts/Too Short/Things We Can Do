[Intro: Wash]
Aye, girl, lemme talk to ya
I know some things we can do
When I leave out this club with you
Oh, baby, I know some things we can do

[Verse 1: Wash]
Never seen a girl in my life
Then me fall in love with her on the first sight
Till I met you, baby, till I met you, baby
So whatcha doin’ up in here tonight?
Cause the way you lookin’ I swear you should be somebody’s wife
Every word I say is true, baby
Every word I say is true, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Wash]
So whatcha drinkin’ on, tell me?
And I’m maxed away, just cause you, please help me
Cause girl I’m tryna get ya to my hotelley
Got a lil work out that’ll switch yo high wave
And you gon’ say ‘go boy, keep going’
And I’mma hit it all night till the early morning
You know I want you to want me
Cause you ain’t gotta sleep on it

[Chorus: Wash]
I know some things we can do, things we can do
I know some things we can do, things we can do
(At my place, just me and you)
I know some things we can do
When I leave up out this club with ya
I know some things we can do

[Verse 2: Wash]
We’ll have the time of your life
Like Rae Sremmurd, girl, I ain't got no type
Till I met you, baby, till I met you, baby
See, you don’t know how long I’ve been searching
You perfect, you worth gettin’ everything you deserve
And I mean every word, aw yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Wash]
So whatcha drinkin’ on, tell me?
And I’m maxed away, just cause you, please help me
Cause girl I’m tryna get ya to my hotelley
Got a lil work out that’ll switch yo high wave
And you gon’ say ‘go boy, keep going’
And I’mma hit it all night till the early morning
You know I want you to want me
Cause you ain’t gotta sleep on it

[Chorus: Wash]
I know some things we can do, things we can do
I know some things we can do, things we can do
(At my place, just me and you)
I know some things we can do
When I leave up out this club with ya
I know some things we can do

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Bitch, you know my name
I’ll make ya throw that thang
No tricks, no tips, just dick fo’ yo lips
I don’t care bout ’em big old tits
I want some action, sum’ betta happen
I see what you postin’, but I ain’t read the caption
You look good as fuck
Got a nigga staring, but you ain’t doin’ nothin’
Take a few shots to the face
And lemme see that booty shake
You fuck with me, you can’t be hold me back
Cuz everything to me is bout hoes and max
Every time you wiggle you make anotha nickel
The bitch’ll be fitch if she wasn’t so fickle
But like I said, if she fuck with me
She gon’ make a whole lotta money
BITCH!

[Chorus: Wash]
I know some things we can do, things we can do
I know some things we can do, things we can do
(At my place, just me and you)
I know some things we can do
When I leave up out this club with ya
I know some things we can do
