Distress
You night as well enjoy yourself
There's too much going on

To be, in, Briskness and Dana
Had a long night, I was in Vegas
At the Bellagio, I had sweet thing from a foreign place
Holding my breath, giving me a fever
Put it in, pull it out, body so illegal
She was so phenomenal
Give me a beautiful euphoric sensation

I only need it once, living in the moment
Money real good, but money bringing me no problems
Going through some things, be my Mary Jane
Take my mind off the stress and the strain
Meet and touching you and take it away
Doing the big shows, celebrate the moment
Pull you up, grad you up, show you how I own it
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane

Look so s***, standing in the mirror
Come a little closer, girl I wanna tear ya
Clothes off your body baby
I wanna get high up in love tonight
Want to play the naughty
Can we play the last night?
Do it over naughty
Big and long life
Just let it roll damn

I only need it once, living in the moment
Money real good, but money bringing me no problems
Going through some things, be my Mary Jane
Take my mind off the stress and the strain
Meet and touching you and take it away
Doing the big shows, celebrate the moment
Pull you up, grad you up, show you how I own it
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane

I light it up and let it on slow
I need to mess you up
Nothing beats this feeling I know
Except the Greek's love
One for now and one for the room
When it's gonna end I don't know
For now I'm in loving must

I only need it once, living in the moment
Money real good, but money bringing me no problems
Going through some things, be my Mary Jane
Take my mind off the stress and the strain
Meet and touching you and take it away
Doing the big shows, celebrate the moment
Pull you up, grad you up, show you how I own it
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane

You only live once
Going through some things
Take my mind off the stress and the strain
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane
Doing the big shows, celebrate the moment
Pull you up, grad you up, show you how I own it
My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane

My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane
