“Yeah, we hella disrespectful”

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
If a nigga walk up on you, what you gon’ do?
Kick in him in the face with a boot
Beat his ass up with your crew
If his bitch don’t stop talking, she can get it too
Hit that bitch with a bottle
I don’t give a fuck if she look like a model
Pretty ass bitches get slapped too
And you better not say shit if they ask you, PUNK BITCH
You better get your ass out the VIP
‘Cause don’t nobody know you
We ‘bout to give them bitch ass niggas over there another funeral to go to
(FUCK YOU, BITCH!)

[Chorus: Too $hort + Mistah F.A.B.]
All my life I’ve been a player
Hoes mad ‘cause I don’t care
I take your bitch so quick, so fast
You mad like that ain’t fair
A lotta hatin’ over there, muh’fucka
A lotta hatin’ over there
Why you hatin’ over there, muh’fucka?
Why you hatin’ over there?

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
A lot of broke niggas in here mad at money, mad money
I said ‘Bye, Felicia; bye, Felicia’, you can’t have nothin’ from me
Where all the niggas at that’s gettin’ it?
Where all the niggas at that got bands?
Where all the bitches at that got it?
And they got it without no man
They give a fuck about everything but a bitch
Razor in her pocket, she’ll cut a bitch
Fake niggas can’t wear no jewels
My little niggas ‘bout to rob them fools

[Chorus: Too $hort + Mistah F.A.B.]
All my life I’ve been a player
Hoes mad ‘cause I don’t care
I take your bitch so quick, so fast
You mad like that ain’t fair
A lotta hatin’ over there, muh’fucka
A lotta hatin’ over there
Why you hatin’ over there, muh’fucka?
Why you hatin’ over there?

[Too $hort]
Somebody say ‘Muthafuck you damn shithead bitch
Muthafuckin’ goddamn asshole’
“Muthafuck you damn shithead bitch
Muthafuckin’ goddamn asshole”

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Bitch, yo’ nigga got his ass whooped
That’s what you get fuckin’ with fuck niggas
Bitch, yo’ nigga got his ass whooped
You need to choose up with a real nigga

[Too $hort]
Toot that shit up before we shoot this shit up
Toot that shit up before we shoot this shit up
You better toot that shit up before we shoot this shit up
Toot it up, bitch

[Mistah F.A.B.]
I don’t fuck with bitches that fuck with them niggas that don’t fuck with my hood
‘Cause my hood is the realest and the richest
And we got all of the money and the bitches
