[Verse 1]
When I walk in the door salute me
Act like a hoe, not a groupie (bitch)
Bitch, wanna make me cum
You better make some money and give me some (hey pimp)
This ain’t time to go shopping
Turn another trick, get it poppin
A bitch will lose me
If she can’t afford to choose a fee
Cause it’s nothing but pimpin
They know it when I’m fucking with her
I’m a live and die by the rules o the game
And when it’s your turn nigga better do the same (rap shit)
When I see a car wanna get
My bitch better buy  me a whip (buy me a)
And say $hort how you know all this shit
It’s the game, I got it from Oakland bitch (Oakland shit)

Philthy look, in the VIP section with a bunch o real niggas
Couple Rozay bottler and a few bad bitches
So give me a bitch so I threw one back
S favor for a favor nigga I was born to act
They know who we are
They see these foreign cars
In the VIP section with a lot o porn stars
Touch down in LA and bitch gotta pay
These bottles cost a thousand broke bitch you in the way
When a nigga pulled up had them hoes on stuck
Young nigga getting money every bitch wanna fuck
I’m all about a buck thinking bout my big head
Fuck tryna get a nut thinking with my lil head
Real [?] fake [?] I’m a pimp the blood out

[Verse 3]
Smelling like cookies never was a rookie
All about my money like a fucking bookie
I’m in the black black bottles in a black Mac
Threw streaks on that bitch to complement that
Got a few bad bitches they got some real ass
I don’t see you broke niggas like cataracts
And I don’t talk shit I just stay fast
Long hair but they all tracks
I’m off them molly water and them Xanax
She can see a real nigga through them contacts
Very important like my uncle racks
On top o these bitches like a doormat
Slap them and play hey and they adore that
Whatever I’m in he can’t afford that
These bitches ready to leave I can’t ignore that
If you feeling I’m feeling I enjoy that

[Bridge]
It’s good out here man
Young niggas getting money

You need to get your motherfucking hustle on cause we some very important pimps

[Verse 4]
Pull up to the club
Face em up
Bitches wanna fuck cause they know that I’m a thug
Pocket full o notes, whole not dubs
Spend it on a hoe, no not us
Hop up out the car, looking like a star
Head into the bar they know who we are
They know who we are
I don’t need ID
Somehow I always end up in the VIP
But it’s probably cause I’m a VIP, VIP, VIP
But it’s probably cause I’m a VIP, VIP, VIP
Just a very important person
Very important pimp
