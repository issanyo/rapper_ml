[Intro: Black Silver, Too $hort]
Light a match up
Bionik
Biatch

[Chorus: Black Ice & Too $hort, Too $hort]
She caught me out there
The bitch caught me out there man
Caught me out there
Tried to get a pimp slipping
She caught me out there
It ain't nothing but pimping, biatch
Caught me out there
Yeah that's right player

[Verse 1: Black Silver]
Cool and calm, the way a player do
Approach babydoll like, "Who is you?"
What your name is? Shorty I'm the navigator
I could use a little you to spend some time with later
And my productions always be popping
Some fine dining, maybe a little shopping
Let the night do what it do, just me and you
Hit the jacuzzi and pop a bottle or two
Girl, don't be shy, you got some model in you
I could have a good time just following you
She replied she was feeling me and my plan
She even let me know that she was one of my fans
That's when I noticed I seen girl before
At one of our shows standing in the front row
Right before the guards said she gotta go
Her and the groupie crew be getting through the backdo'

[Chorus: Black Ice & Too $hort, Too $hort]
She caught me out there
The bitch caught me out there man
Caught me out there
Tried to get a pimp slipping
She caught me out there
It ain't nothing but pimping, biatch
Caught me out there
Short Dawg in the motherfucking house

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Way back when I made "Freaky Tales"
In 1988 I was freaking girls
And I fucked a lot of groupies in '89
When I started getting famous if I think she's fine
I'ma hit it, I'm back on the road tomorrow
Another show, pussy is sure to follow
But don't bother 'cause I don't fuck groupies these days
See me with a bitch, best believe she's paid
And love is what it's not gon' be
Ain't talking 'bout money, don't talk to me (biatch)
And pay choosing fees, and usually
I blew the trees while she bruise the knees
Let me tell you what happened a few nights ago
Met a bad little bitch, tried to wife the ho
I always have to have two wives or mo'
But I ain't never seen nothing that fine befo'

[Chorus: Black Ice & Too $hort, Too $hort, Ice-T]
She caught me out there
The bitch caught me out there man
Caught me out there
Tried to get a pimp slipping
She caught me out there
It ain't nothing but pimping, biatch
Caught me out there
Yeah sometimes a pimp can catch a ho out there man

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
I caught this bitch out of pocket yesterday
Staring hard at my rims and my candy paint
I said, "Shut the fuck up bitch, respect the game
I'm Iceberg bitch (biatch), respect the name"
I said, "The only one position you got is your back
The only chance you got in your life is the trap
I'ma tell you something that's a goddamn fact
I'm a motherfucking pimp and your man's a simp"
The bitch looked at me like a slave set free
I said, "Hold up ho, I need my choosing fee
I need my trap, bitch, fact, bitch, that's no joke
I don't give a fuck you gotta fuck the po'"
The bitch left that day, came back that night
100 grand cash, ki of snowwhite
Looked at a nigga like it was big dough
I said, "Back to the trap, this is pimping, oh"

[Chorus: Ice-T, Too $hort]
Caught her out there
I'm hard on a ho, it ain't nothing but pimping, biatch
I caught her out there
Yeah they know what it is, it ain't nothing but pimping, biatch
I caught her out there
Better get with it bitch, it ain't nothing but pimping, biatch
I caught her out there
She already knows, it ain't nothing but pimping, biatch

[Outro: Too $hort]
Yeah that's right player
Ay, you know what, you know what I say?
Don't tell that bitch nothing, man
The bitch gon' find out through this pimping, man
Caught me out there, bitch
Better catch this pimping in yo' ass, bitch
Yeah, what's my favorite word?
That's your new name
