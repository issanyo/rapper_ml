[Chorus]
It must be a challenge
Tryna keep your balance
With an ass like that
Yeah it's fat, okay
Okay it's a challenge
Tryna keep my balance
I be walking with them racks
Yeah them stacks

[Verse 1]
Bouncing on my lap, I see you looking back
That's what I attract, I like it like that
Ass cheeks smack, money in the crack
Hit it from the back, I'ma hit it from the back
Girl you make me horny, it's lookin' kind of stormy, I'm throwing all this money
You the only one that's worth it, body looking perfect, work it when you twerk it
I'ma hit that, get that, kiss it 'til it get wet
I know what you want girl, you just want this dizz-nick
You better handle your business
Money on the floor, it's all yours, come and get this

[Chorus]
It must be a challenge
Tryna keep your balance
With an ass like that
Yeah it's fat, okay
Okay it's a challenge
Tryna keep my balance
I be walking with them racks
Yeah them stacks

[Verse 2]
You get up on stage, you go do your thing
I be so amazed, I gave you the game
I come every day, I can't walk away
Now I feel some kind of way, I don't know what to say
I might throw some ones, okay you the one, I got all the funds
Okay girl you on it, I might throw some hundreds, that's how bad I want it
Oh she bad, Michael Jack, got a half, look at that
Wanna grab, throw them racks, I can't pass, throw it back
Look at you, when you move, and you new and you cute
I don't know what to do, you so hot, coffee, soup

[Chorus]
It must be a challenge
Tryna keep your balance
With an ass like that
Yeah it's fat, okay
Okay it's a challenge
Tryna keep my balance
I be walking with them racks
Yeah them stacks
