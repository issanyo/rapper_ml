[Intro:  Too $hort and E-40]
Yeah we mobbin'
Making history
E-40, Too Short
What's up
Sam Bostick on the motha fuckin blap breh
Sheesh
Fuckin' them up like this n that (that)
Fuckin' them up like this n that (like that)
Spit somethin' right quick
Spit somthin' pimp

[Verse 1: E-40]
Look
And a lot has moved but i scoot a Range Rover now but I used to scoot a bucket
I don't wear a gun holster, my boxer briefs is were I tuck it
I don't ever be sober I'm always drunk as fuck
Got an bad one on my anklesm, she freaky bruh
Look like the bitch from the Game of Thrones, Khaleesi-uh
Her coochie on fire she got that dragon crevice
I got her fist of Ciroc and a bag of lettuce
I'm gonna be there in a second be patient
But I'm really still at the house playin' PlayStation
Hittin' the bong and shootin' the dice in the garage
Smokin' a long B-Leh blunt gettin' massaged
Sometimes I lie like a lawyer say things I shouldn't have
But that's what happens when your live that life pushin' bags
I'm in motion like the ocean, her legs open
Pussy creamy as fuck like Oil of Olay lotion
(Sheesh)

[Hook:  Stressmatic]
I'm rollin'
Jump out the car George Jefferson strollin'
Pockets lookin' like they about to give birth
All in a bitch purse, about to make the shit worse
Mobbin' through the turf, no lie
Nigga gettin' richer and richer
While these folks keep takin' my picture
Sheesh
Sheesh
Sheesh

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
I'm in Vegas
With a few freaks
In a big ass room that's really two suites
Connected, laid out like a penthouse
Bitch said daddy pull your friend out
Now I'm layin' in the bed gettin' some head
And the party ain't even started yet
But that's my life and I gotta live it
I wake up every day and try to get it
And if she ain't with it, i just call my other bitches
You makin' all them faces but y'all no what this is
It's vicious, it's certified pimp shit
If you see a bitch with me she ain't inocent
So if you wanna take her, she's a money maker
You gotta put her in the oven like a honey baker
'Cause shes hot, burnin' up
Like this beat, make you wanna turn it up

[Hook:  Stressmatic]
I'm rollin'
Jump out the car George Jefferson strollin'
Pockets lookin' like they about to give birth
All in a bitch purse, about to make the shit worse
Mobbin' through the turf, no lie
Nigga gettin' richer and richer
While these folks keep takin' my picture
Sheesh
Sheesh
Sheesh

[Verse 3: E-40]
Let me tell you some real shit though
Fuckin' is my favorite sport drinkin' is my second
Keep my mouth shut if the po po ask me questions
What happens on the soil stays on the soil (What else?)
Keep your mouth shut if you see some stuff unfoil
Talkin' to the police and TV reporters
It'll get you fucked off and make a long life shorter
I know a nigga that been shot in his toe, and died
I know a nigga that got shot in his fro, he still alive

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
It's that dope fiend music we in the mix
Hella dope in the trunk like Rick's (Freeway)
Old school west coast niggas mutha fuckas with owe you money better catch those niggas
Tell him run for his life, it's some killers on the street havin' fun every night
It's crazy, you never know whats gonna happen
Make them every day and keep rappin' (sheesh)

[Hook:  Stressmatic]
I'm rollin'
Jump out the car George Jefferson strollin'
Pockets lookin' like they about to give birth
All in a bitch purse, about to make the shit worse
Mobbin' through the turf, no lie
Nigga gettin' richer and richer
While these folks keep takin' my picture
Sheesh
Sheesh
