[Intro: Too Short]
Send a shout out to the homie Pac
Know you out there somewhere right now writing rhymes man, laying tracks
Straight love, you know what I'm saying, always man
We had never forgot about 2Pac, you know, that's our boy 'til the end

From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac
From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh, pimp game impecable
Work game incredible (how many songs did he do)
Nine songs a day, no less than four
A rap legend, an icon, a reptible
Last time I seen him was at my Rapper's Ball video
Pac you'll be proud of me pimpin', I'm doing my best
Not only the Bay, but I'm holding down the West
And I just wanna thank Afeni (why)
For birthing 2Pac Shakur, the greatest rapper in history

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]
I'm glad we had a chance, to say goodbye
I shed so many tears and you changed my life
California Love baby ride or die
I can hear you, right now, Pac yelling West Side
And West it is, we got the world going dumb
We gone make 'em understand Pac where we coming from
Don't you worry homie, rest in peace
We appreciate your love, let your soul run free

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Look into the hearts of men, every pumping valve
Man I wish we had 2Pacalypse now
Like you, I wanna make the whole world love me
You let me know, only God can judge me
I got tears in my eyes as I write this verse
The whole Bay know you were hyphy first
You've been gone, we gon' stand strong
Immortalized, the legend lives on

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes

[Verse 4: Mistah F.A.B.]
This is for the great Amaru
God knew, that you, would ride through the ghettos of the world and provide food
For hopeless youth, dope feinds with dope to use
The way that you spoke your views gave hope to dudes
2Pac, the legendary Shakur
Makaveli the Don, a prophet I'm sure
And '96 man it dont seem like it's been
I can picture you rolling up in your 500 Benz

[Verse 5: Mac Mall]
You gave me love on the ghetto scene
Put me on a million TV screens, with you
I remember drinking liqour at century clubs
Watching superstars sworn over Thug Life
You took a youngin from the Crest Side world wide
Real thizzness, I was family when you died
I'm a real outlaw and I'mma ride til the end of time
And when I see you on the other side
I crack the cap on the Henny
And Big Back, would I lie?

[Verse 6: Band-Aide of Dem Hoodstarz]
All eyes on me, dear mama, its me against the world
You know I get around like your brendas little girl
Blast me, no im not telling you the blasphemy
Pac was a poet, his death was a tragedy

[Verse 7: Scoot of Dem Hoodstarz]
Come with me, hail mary to the soldiers
Spit at the cameras, flipping off the rollers
I swear you made a nation full of thugs, put your W's up
And make the West Coast feel like one, rest in peace Pac

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes

[Verse 8: Turf Talk]
(Aye Pac wassup mayne)
Man I've been missing Makaveli since '96
Pac the games change, there are hella wimps
Picrture Me Rolling, one of my favorite songs
Satrin At The World Through My Rearview, Life Goes On
Had dreams of working with you, but it never happened
But I ain't trippin, we'll collaborate some day in heaven
All your albums classics, all of them slapping
Is there a heaven for a G, I know you got it cracking

[Verse 9: Lil Uno of The Pack]
Makaveli, 2Pac, he was a legend
But he in a better place, on earth we call it heaven
'96 is the year that we lost a gift
You gone, but not forgotten, and you always will be missed

[Verse 10: Lil B of The Pack]
Man, Pac, we love you, ain't nobody above you
You music touched us, and the people we buzzing
It's all about Pac, yeah the angel with the broken wings
Rose from concrete, he's still here is what it seems

[Verse 11: Young L of The Pack]
Stand troops, recognize the truth
Here lies the dude who lived rough and died for you
Took slugs and spilt his blood to lace the youth
And told young niggas to get up and face the blues
'Cause it's a thug's life, everyday is what we do
Love life, believe and you'll see it through
So to my brother Pac make a place for me with you
I'mma represent you till I reach the tool

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes

[Verse 12: Baby Bash]
He used to clown around, when he came around with the underground
Hit the V-Town with Kyrie on some thunder pounds
Even directed the video (Mac Mall)
He was on some major shit way back then but we didn't know
How a genius get to work, on the herb and the purp
Probably looking down, smiling now on some purp
He had love for us Mexicans
Loves to see young playas stacking Benjamins

[Verse 13: Nump Trump]
I wake up and blaze one for Pac every morning
It's Mr. I Got Grapes, picture me rolling
Everybody knows this, or knew what it was
When we found out Pac passed, it was so messed up
We was crushed, couldn't beleive it, Gorilla-Pinos and all
But we still slap your album so the music lives on
When tomorrow comes, we still ride for Makaveli
From the low-lows to scrapers, you smell me

[Verse 14: Shock G]
Pac, he didn't mean to die, he got in over his head
Died for you but wasn't trying to be dead
He went round and round, 'cause there wasn't nothing better to do
What could be better than dying for you
Split the blunt, put the Hennessey in the cup
Let me see ya, let me see ya toss it up
We all feel 2Pac, now that he's gone
But recognize those alive who sing the same song, c'mon

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes
