[Verse 1]
Latina girls shakin' hips, bouncin' curls
I just wanna kiss you baby, wish you could be my mystery lady
Hit the club, dance all night, fall in love and spend my life with you
My se√±orita, early in the mornin', that's when I need ya
Next to me, makin' love, it's too good, I can't say enough
About the way you wake me up, it's the first time every day we fuck
The best place on earth, anywhere I am when I'm next to her
So much fun the way you make me laugh
And you get on the dance floor and shake that ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That's what I love, she got that Spanish blood
I know y'all feelin' me though, Mexican or Filipino
Puerto Rican salsa dancin', in Miami they all speak Spanish
I talk that body language, come here girl, tell me what you sayin'
I heard that, you got a lot curves in the back
And you know how to shake that crack
Make it rain and take that stack
'Cause I know it's you, trickin' that 1942
Don Julio, take a shot, bend over and make it hot

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Baddest bitch in the club, we tryna get fucked up
If you see her, point at her, these other girls don't matter
She's badder, no complaints, think she hatin', no she ain't
There ain't no competition, her on top, that's my position
When I'm inside it, I'm excited
Put her on top and let her ride it
She twerkin' on my thing
Sexy girl from Spain
I'm just sayin', I love every race
Different flavors, different taste
Question me if you know the answer
I love my sexy dancer

[Hook]
