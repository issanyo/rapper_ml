[Too $hort]
I'm a legend in the game, you can't replace me
I'm drivin' this car, don't try to race me
You'll never win, I came straight from the coastline
I got the most albums and the most rhymes
I could die and you still won't catch up
How you gonna step up when you let them little heffers
Dig in your pocket while they suckin' on your left nut
You a soldier? Nigga I'm a vet, what
I'm old school with a new style
Girls hear me rap and act too wild
But that's how I like 'em, what you wanna do now?
Get you all alone girl and turn you out
You want a man that do all he can
Hold your hand, and take you to the promise land
But I refuse to help you get there
(Good luck) I hope you choose on the best player

[Chorus]
Shittin' on 'em
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em beotch!

[Too $hort]
She said I'm too old, get fucked it's too late
She said tell $hort it's a new day
Bitch I say fuck what you say
I'm from the Old Bay and the New Bay
When you make the wrong choice, who you gon' blame?
I'm all in your ear tellin' you the wrong thing
But you listen anyway, buyin' the dream
You know about us pimps, we be lyin' and things
I don't wanna fight for the bitch Joe
It's all about the game, and who can spit the most
I'm never too faded to hustle
Ball up my fists, and make a muscle
I stay strapped, I don't wanna tustle
Fake ass bodyguard nigga wanna wrestle
Cause you think she's likin' me?
She's goin' hella stupid on this hyphy beat?
And now you wanna fight with me?
Make me mad, and I'ma fuck your wife-to-be
I'm from the Eastside where the Raiders play
Where you get your game from? I say the Bay
You think I'll square up? You can't be hopin'
I'm hard on a bitch, I was trained in Oakland
I never turned in my player card
Ask anybody, they'll say I'm hard
I'm shittin' on 'em

[Chorus]
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em beotch!

[Too $hort]
You so horny, tryin' to find you a bitch mayne
I'm hustlin', I gotta stay rich mayne
You friendly, like to buy hoes gifts
But I'm mean, I hit 'em with the closed fist
You a sucka, take a bitch on a trip
I kick back, and send a bitch to go get my stack
And you'll never do that
You're weak for a bitch, you better move back
Why they always use you?
Cause you pay 'em, that's what they used to
Man bitches everywhere
Treat niggas like you like teddy bears
You'll get to feel on her and touch her
You always with her but you still ain't fucked her
You fell in love with the bitch last summer
I fucked a few times then dumped her
You tricks, always tryin' to find you a better hoe
I told you, never put the pussy on a pedestal
Them nasty little cum freaks, F 'em
If they wasn't bout the money I left 'em
Burn rubber, I'm drivin' fast
That's my new motto 'cause it's time to smash
I flew past still givin' it gas
Made a right turn, swingin' the ass
I'm shittin' on 'em

[Chorus]
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em...
I'm shittin' on 'em beotch!
