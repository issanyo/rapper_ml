[Verse 1: Rafael Casal]
I got my start in the weed game
Upgraded to pills
Sold them to the kids in the flats and the kids in the hills
And ooh, was they buying
I was out here gettin’ money for [?] shit
I was about to be driving
Couple stacks got me a two-door Saturn coupe
It was not cool but the sub made sure my shit knock, fool
And my high school girl, she was fine I guess
I mean no disrespect, I was not cute
(Yo, where the fuck you from, boy?)
B-Town, B-Town
My moms was a far-out hippie
My pops was a damn Hispanic
So census box checking got tricky
I grew up in another town
All my boys are from East Oakland
Talk loud, get your head broke in
Nah, we're chill, we just jokin’
Unless you don’t stop
I drive ‘cause we all hate ho' cops
Them fuckin’ with the brown boys won’t stop
Everybody slumped down at the red light
Windows up, inside smellin’ like a smoke shop
I didn’t mean to call all cops hoes
Some of y’all are just doin’ your best
But tryin’ keepin’ peace in the frat of the clan
Just seems like such a futile thing to suggest
I mean the coke and the pills that I’m sellin’ was brought by
The same FBI that would give me my arrest
Ain’t unclear how crack blew up here
Nicknamed the city so we can’t forget

[Verse 2: Too $hort]

Oakland is where I’m from
Whatever you want, we’ll sell you some
It’s always been that way
Wherever you from, anywhere in the Bay
You gotta come to The Town if you wanna get down
Spend a little money when you comin’ around
Get you what you want if you wanna get high
Most niggas sellin’ dope just wanna get by
‘Cause we don’t get a lot of choices
That’s why we talk with guns, not voices
They say, “It ain’t no fun when you force it,”
When you see us come, we want some more shit
And don’t tell me what I act like
Out here, everything is half price
Except love and drugs is never enough
You gotta pay top dollar if you want that stuff
As long as there ain’t no drought
Ain’t nobody tryin’ to find a way out
Fuck your inner-city programs
I gotta sell this dope, man

“Where you really from though?”
They love to pull that card
Like nigga, you ain’t that hard
Like, you never lived yo' bars
Like being all up in the media smiling must mean I ain’t got scars
Like seeing a way out and taking it somehow erases
The place I started
Before I had a name you might brand your kids with
Pushin’ cocaine was family business
On 77th below 8-1-4
But when they rushed the crib with guns, we had to go
And my folks said "you can have the dope game back"
‘Cause it wasn’t a game when cocaine became crack
So I grew up [?] made stacks
But surviving the city is dope, despite that
And I still got fam on C Street
[?]
Burners, blammers, that’s that [?]
Police sirens, tires, skeet skeet
Windows rolled down, yak yak, that sound
Love this soil, kiss it, this town
In my blood and blood on the ground
‘Cause it's war out where we be now

Some say we built this city on rock
Rollin' with the [?]
Why you think they call the brains blowing
Uncle Darren had to [?] up at the stoplight
That’s why we all gas, no brakes
Long as you move, you got hope
Plus we more scared of the cops than the gangstas out here
In the city of
