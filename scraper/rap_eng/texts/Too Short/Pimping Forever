Beotch!
Somebody say beotch! Say beotch!
A lemme hear you say beotch! Say beotch!
Say bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch..

Your daddy said come back baby, find your life
It was wrong before but this time it's right
It's been way too long, you've been gone from home
You wasn't ready when you left to be grown on your own
Now deep down inside you're his little girl
Gotta swallow his pride cause you're his little girl
Wouldn't be so bad, if you only stripped
But you don't do dancin just lonely tricks
Now you're hooked - ain't no love
You in this game, it's just like drugs
Your family wrote you off cause you fucked that up
You way out of town and you stuck
Now you're on your own, you've been disowned
Since you left your hometown all your friends are gone
It's girls like you that truly make us
You're lost in the world so I moved you to Vegas

Before you met me you wasn't nuttin
I fucked wit'cha and I turned you into somethin
Now fuck J-Lo, be your own woman
Now take your ass back to work the track jumpin
Say beotch! I'ma be pimpin forever
Bitch, I'ma be pimpin forever
Say say say say hoe! I'ma stay mackin forever
Hoe, I'ma stay mackin forever
Say, say beotch! I'ma be pimpin forever
Bitch, I'ma be pimpin forever
Say say say say hoe! I'ma stay mackin forever
Hoe, I'ma stay mackin forever

[Too $hort]
Say beotch! You better get that cash
Old-ass man wanna hit that ass
Older than your daddy, more like your granny
Let his old wrinkled ass get in them panties
I show you how to get it, I'm just a dog
You had a good thang and you fucked it off
I'm like the big bad wolf, you better scream
Run for your life cause I want that cream
Your father told you, to stay away from me
And now you gotta call me daddy?
Now let me ask you, you think you've got it together?
You're too fine to be broke, you gotta get whatever
Now I don't give a fuck in any weather
When I see you, you better have a G or better
Look into my eyes, and say you understand me
Cause now I'm your family (say beotch)

Before you met me you wasn't nuttin
I fucked wit'cha and I turned you into somethin
Now fuck J-Lo, be your own woman
Now take your ass back to work the track jumpin
Say beotch! I'ma be pimpin forever
Bitch, I'ma be pimpin forever
Say say say say hoe! I'ma stay mackin forever
Hoe, I'ma stay mackin forever
Say, say beotch! I'ma be pimpin forever
Bitch, I'ma be pimpin forever
Say say say say hoe! I'ma stay mackin forever
Hoe, I'ma stay mackin forever

Your father wants to know, when you comin
But you never liked home so you keep on runnin
Now I got you, you're mine for life
Bitch get your mind right, don't let the limelight
Steal your soul, and make you old
Make the happy lil' girl turn bitter and cold
Now your brain is frozen, your body is numb
You're stuck in the hoe-zone, you gotta get home
You can go to Oz and won't learn shit
Click your heels three times and go turn a trick
Beotch! You better get that cash
If you don't got it when I see you I'ma whip that ass
And all of you squares, that hear my flows
Most of y'all bitches wouldn't make good hoes
Never talk down on a pimp and his whore
Unless you know the whole story, broke bitch! (say beotch)

Before you met me you wasn't nuttin
I fucked wit'cha and I turned you into somethin
Now fuck J-Lo, be your own woman
Now take your ass back to work the track jumpin
Say beotch! I'ma be pimpin forever
Bitch, I'ma be pimpin forever
Say say say say hoe! I'ma stay mackin forever
Hoe, I'ma stay mackin forever
Say, say beotch! I'ma be pimpin forever
Bitch, I'ma be pimpin forever
Say say say say hoe! I'ma stay mackin forever
Hoe, I'ma stay mackin forever
