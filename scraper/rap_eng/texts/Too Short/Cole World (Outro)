[Too $hort + (Keyshia Cole)]
This is Too $hort, I need to let you know one thang
It’s a dope ass album, girl—I’m fuckin’ wit it
I fucks wit’ you, for real though
You know we love it, girl (Know that I love it)
Keep making that good music
I know you remember what 2Pac taught you (Oh yeah)
‘Cause you’ve been smashing ever since (Getting…)
Smashing on the game (…money)
Getting money
Been all over the world
I gotta say I respect 100 percent
How you give these little girls the game
How you give grown ass women that knowledge
How you ain’t no punk, yeah

[Keyshia Cole]
Special cloth alert
A cole, cole, cole, Cole World
And I put that on everything
A cole, cole, cole, Cole World
So cole, so Cole World

You know where we’re going, Keyshia
(Straight to the top) To the top…
