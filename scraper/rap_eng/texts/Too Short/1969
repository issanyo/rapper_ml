[Hook: Dr. Hollywood]
I ain't got no money, but my love is real
I'm gonna drop some acid, I wanna smoke some weed
I wanna fuck you like it's 1969
She's got them go-go boots, she's a flower child
We could go all the way, but first you wait a while
I wanna party like it's 1969

[Verse 1: Dirt Nasty]
'69 Summer of Love, 1980 summer of drugs
Man, I shoulda been a hippie, dropped the acid with Janis and Jimi
Do me while I hit the doobie
Flower in her ear, natural boobies
Coochie bushy as fuck, free love and the V Dub Bus
Woodstock here I come, with a bag of shrooms and my loaded gun
So huh, just relax, kick back and hit this hash
Thumbs up on the shoulder pads
You know the rules: ass, grass or cash
Stay high, stay nude, say goodbye to my bottle of Quaalude

[Hook: Dr. Hollywood]

[Verse 2: Too Short]
Everybody's poppin' bottles and dreamin' about goin' out with models
I spend a lot on a round of shots, I get drunk and I clown a lot
But I wish I could go back in time, back to 1969
Maybe hit a few orgies, y'all, and have unsafe sex with gorgeous broads
Yea, that's what's up, I could use my dick to express my love
Because I love you baby, that was 40 years ago I must be crazy
You wanna get your hype with me, then go far away from society
I just know want to fuck you now, let's drop out and make a love child
