[Intro]
(Pimp to this, just pimp to this)
All the time, gettin' mine, that's why I'm pimpin'
(Pimp to this, pimp to this, just pimp to this)
That's why I'm pimpin' all the time, gettin' mine
(Pimp to this, pimp to this, just pimp to this)
That's how we do it, straight pimpin'
(Pimp to this, pimp to this)
All the time, all the time

[Verse 1]
It's the original, D-O-G, Short Dawg
They said don't do it, but I gotta go off
You talked a lot of shit and can't back it up
Say you make a lot of money and can't stack enough
Spend it on the strippers and the prostitutes
Do what you gotta do
No SoundScans, got your record label hot at you
They droppin' you, two years ago we was poppin' you
You was talkin' shit about nobody stoppin' you
I told the lil homie a long time ago
If you put your mind to it, you can find some dough
It don't matter, even if yo' pockets kinda low
All you gotta do is knock a fine ass ho
Fuck that bitch like a porno star
Walk her to the corner, I bet she won't go far
I knew the day would come when you would notice it
Get wise and realize bein' broke ain't shit

[Chorus]
That's why I'm pimpin' all the time
(Pimp to this, pimp to this, just pimp to this)
Gettin' hoes to give me money, I'm gettin' mine
You know I ain't lyin
(Pimp to this, pimp to this)
'Cause what I spend and what I'm ridin' is the shit
That's why I do this, straight pimpin' all the time
(Pimp to this, pimp to this, just pimp to this)
If you see my bitch hoein', I'm gettin' mine
You know I ain't lyin', tricks love what I'm supplyin'
(Pimp to this, pimp to this)
It's the shit, that's why I do this

[Verse 2]
It's been around a long time
Pimpin', manipulatin' minds, prostitutin' women
Pussy is worth a lot of money
She says that everyday you gotta pay me when you want me
Tricks like to fuck and do that freaky shit
You know I kick my ho ass, she don't bring me gifts
I'm talkin' cold cash money, nothin' else'll do
Get my money bitch, you better fuck him 'til he's through
Make that trick come quick, and don't stop him
And if he's slippin', you better rob him
Go out and turn another date, don't hesitate
You know daddy loves you when you keep my money straight
You ride the best cars, eat good, and drink fat
You can't do this shit without me, don't you ever think that
Recognize my bald head and my gangsta limp
Damn, it feels good to be a pimp

[Chorus]
That's why I'm pimpin' all the time
(Pimp to this, pimp to this, just pimp to this)
Gettin' hoes to give me money, I'm gettin' mine
You know I ain't lyin
(Pimp to this, pimp to this)
'Cause what I spend and what I'm ridin' is the shit
That's why I do this, straight pimpin' all the time
(Pimp to this, pimp to this, just pimp to this)
If you see my bitch hoein', I'm gettin' mine
You know I ain't lyin', tricks love what I'm supplyin'
(Pimp to this, pimp to this)
It's the shit, that's why I do this

[Verse 3]
I hear you squares, you try to criticize us players
But when the pussy's on sale, I see you always there
A good customer, you know yo' game ain't tough
And even though we came up doin' all the same stuff
I'm a pimp, I turn a bitch out quick
Have her standin' on the corner tryin' to get some dick
Lay on yo' back bitch, and get my cash
'Cause if you don't, I gotta kick yo' ass
Fuck all that drama
This ain't HBO, I whoop you like yo' momma
If you don't pay me ho, I do this everyday
I check bitches and get paid
I want the money, I ain't tryin' to get laid
Ain't nothin' new about this shit, it's the oldest profession
Sellin' pussy while it's snowin' at the coldest intersection
I know how you feel about me, you love me
Turnin' tricks thinkin' of me

[Chorus]
That's why I'm pimpin' all the time
(Pimp to this, pimp to this, just pimp to this)
Gettin' hoes to give me money, I'm gettin' mine
You know I ain't lyin
(Pimp to this, pimp to this)
'Cause what I spend and what I'm ridin' is the shit
That's why I do this, straight pimpin' all the time
(Pimp to this, pimp to this, just pimp to this)
If you see my bitch hoein', I'm gettin' mine
You know I ain't lyin', tricks love what I'm supplyin'
(Pimp to this, pimp to this)
It's the shit, that's why I do this

[Outro]
(Pimp to this)
All the time
