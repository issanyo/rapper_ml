[Intro: Flocka]
Brake your back bitch

[Verse 1: Flocka]
Now what them real niggas like?
Molly's in my liquor
Prescription pills and weed
That's a real nigga drug
Show some pussy make a real nigga throw it up
Throw it up
Show some love
Just because you a bad bitch
Just because you on your grind girl
I respect everything you do
Work mama
Work mama
Work mama
Get them bands ho
Work mama, work mama
Slip them grands ho
We caught eye contact
I walked up on her like
"Girl you got one bright future"
I'm her boyfriends nightmare, Freddy Kruger
Pussy good so I bust up with a broken back [?], [?]
Beat the pussy, Lex Luger
Boom, boom, boom
Get low like some 808s
Got the squares out my circle now my paper straight
Bitch, I got work on layaway
Bitch, I got work on labor day

[Hook: Flocka]
Molly's in her liquor
Prescription pills and weed
That's a real drug
I got all the bad bitches
I got all the real niggas
Turn her house into a club
Turn her house into a club
She don't want a scrub she want that real nigga love
She gave me mouth in the tub
Then she walked out, kissed you like "Whaaaat?!"
Turn her house into the club
Turn her house into a club
Turn the house into the club
"Nigga whaaaat?!"
Turn her house into a club
"Nigga whaaaat?!"

[Verse 2: Flocka]
Eyes big like Kermit the Frog's
All them molly's and them bars
I was chillin' and hanging with stars
Crystal don't come in them bags, they come in jars
She came four times, that's a par
Ass so big you can see from far
No bar after party in the back seat of my car
And you got VIP tickets
Pussy knee deep in it
Cut my hands stomp my feet in it
Fall asleep in it
Might pass out in it
Going hard like the 9th inning
Spend the night in it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
I'mma throw a party at her momma house
Her momma fine I'mma put in her momma mouth
Short dog, I stay with the hoes
But never in my life will I stay with a ho
I'm on the go
Middle of the summer with some snow
Popping pills and these bitches want blow
Whatever I gotta do to get the party started
The bitch never stopped once the party started
Up all night doing hella shit
And when she came out them clothes she was hella thick
Bitch was drunker than me on TMZ
And if you seen that shit boy I was hella lit
She said: "Why the call you Short, you got hella dick"
If you ain't sucking on it bitch it's irrelevant
She started sucking me up for the hell of it
And I busted in the face of that pretty little yellow bitch

[Hook]
