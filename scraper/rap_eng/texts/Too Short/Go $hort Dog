[Verse 1]
15 million, SoundScan
Let me think back, how it began
It was Ice Cube, me and Eazy-E
Produced Kid Rock and took him on tour with me (Yeah, yeah)
I worked with B.I.G., worked with 2Pac
With me and Pimp C, pimpin' don't stop (It's pimpin')
Ask Jay-Z, ask T.I.P
Ask-ask Scarface, Bushwick or Willie D (Geto Boys)
I worked with all them niggas, I moved down south
Lil Jon and Jazze Pha know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Me and JD, that's Jermaine Dupri
In the studio with 8Ball and MJG
My nigga MC Breed, I fuck with you
Real niggas nationwide around the country, dude
A lot of underground shit that never came out
You mothafuckas know what my name's about

[Chorus]
Go $hort Dog
Yeah, you know
Go $hort Dog
Yeah, go $hort Dog
Yeah, that Too $hort shit go, man
Go $hort Dog, give 'em what they want

[Verse 2]
Six platinum, four gold
People say, "He hot, but he so old" (So old)
Who gives a fuck, bitch? 'Cause I'm so cold
I just bought a brand new Range Rove' (Oh)
Benzes, Maserati
I done had every kind of big body
On "Rapper's Ball," I was talkin' twenties
That was '97, you wasn't even in your twenties (Youngsta)
I've been ballin', been a real pimp
Same year I did "Call Me" with Lil Kim
Custom swimming pools, with my name in 'em
Why? I'm always swimmin' in your main women
I fucked actresses, models, superstars (Yeah, I fucked 'em)
Even ratchet bitches, in the back of cars
In my videos, hella pretty hoes
And bought a mansion way out near the Presidio (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Go $hort Dog
Fo'sho
Go $hort Dog
Fuck yeah, fo'sho
Yeah, go $hort Dog
That shit go
Go $hort Dog, give 'em what they want

[Verse 3]
I had a million dollar deal before you heard of one
75 Girls, bitch, I was havin' fun
I use to be on the back of the bus
Bad mouth mothafucka, like to rap when I cuss
Sellin' tapes (Cassette tapes), sayin', "Fuck you, bitch"
Goddamn, asshole, mothafucka, I'm rich (Uh)
They said I'd never make it like that
But 30 years later bitch, I'm still havin' scratch (Gettin' money)
Ex-wives, mommas too (Your momma)
Little sisters, aunties, they all got screwed (Yeah, I fucked 'em)
I fucked 'em all, and didn't give a fuck
They keep choosin', I can't get enough (Ugh)
(What they call me?) Girls call me Todd, everywhere I go
You say, "Too $hort," you know I rep The O (Oakland)
First homie with a platinum plaque, from The Town
Bitch, you know who did that (Too $hort, bitch)

[Chorus]
Go $hort Dog
Who got the most years in the game?
Go $hort Dog
Three decades, baby
Go $hort Dog
More money, more songs, more shows, more bitches
Go $hort Dog, give 'em what they want
Go $hort Dog
Go $hort Dog, yeah
Go $hort Dog
Go $hort Dog, give 'em what they want
