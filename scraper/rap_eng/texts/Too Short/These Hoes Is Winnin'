[MAKING OF THE BEAT by DJA]

[Intro: Too $hort]
What's up Shanell
It's ya OG homie Too $hort
You know it a war out here right
It's the hoes verses the ladies
And these hoes ain't playing fair

[Hook]
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes
Hoes verses ladies who gone get it girl
It's a competition you win if you get it girl
Shake that ass make it bounce get it girl
Losers never win you better get it girl

[Verse 1: Shanell]
I hate to admit it
Good girls are not in style today
Tired to be committed
Niggas ain't worth it anyway
Love ain't got shit to do with it
These boys been leading us astray
Bitches who get it be on they game until it play
Your a ho to them either way
So play the game that they play
If your jumping on and off it
It's only fair to profit

[Hook]
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes

[Verse 2: Shanell]
She never gets cheated on
Gets all the gifts that make her smile
Flights cross the pacific
While his girl home watching his child
Don't you let him tell ya
That they don't love these hoes come on
If these niggas could be with Keidra
The inspiration needa tear'em apart
Your a ho to them either way
So play the game that they play
If your jumping on and off it
It's only fair to profit

[Hook]
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes

[Verse 3: Too $horts
Hoes men spend a lot of money on them
You say itâ€™s not sex but you wanting from him
Love you wanna turn them into marry bitches
House wife with some kids have a merry Christmas
Take her home to meet your mama
Spend a week at atlantis in the bahamas
You know some nice girls but do you really love them
Or you just fucking with these hoes
I know a million of them
Your a ho to them either way
So play the game that they play
If your jumping on and off it
It's only fair to profit


[Hook]
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes is winnin'
These hoes
Hoes verses ladies who gone get it girl
It's a competition you win if you get it girl
Shake that ass make it bounce get it girl
Losers never win yiu better get it girl
Think like a man
