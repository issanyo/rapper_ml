[Too $hort]
It's the life I live, I chose it
Macked a lot of bitches and hoes, I know you know it
Spit a lot of flows at shows and still rock it
If I put her money in my pocket don't knock it
Disrespect the game, you'll throw yourself off balance
What's the true nature of the player hater's challenge?
Nigga won't listen to me? I doubt it
But if I tell the crowd say it loud they gon' shout it
If I put my tape on the shelf you gon' buy it
And if I tell a bitch turn a trick she gon' try it
Too $hort baby, I drive a Mercedes Benz
Spittin' this game since 1980 beotch
(Beotch) Ask my nigga Pimp C
It's '99 but we ride to new century
Always gettin' money in this industry
Pull out my old Caddy, bitches in the seats

[Hook: LeVitti]
I'm just a player, livin' the players life
And if you's a hater, you need to get some get-right
Cause in a players life I be
Posted like a boss, call me G
Put the mack down on a punk bitch
And she gon' meet me at the room with her two best friends

[Pimp C]
Comin' down on 'em in a candy toy
Dip it like a baller like that nigga Lil Troy
Breakin' these bitches ain't shit to us
And bitch we make a lot of money but it's never enough
The motherfuckin' ghetto can't leave us alone
Sir Too $hort and that nigga Sweet Jones
Breakin' these bitches with the microphone
And always keep a chip in the cellular phone
Spend eighty-five thousand on a 2000 S'
And we got indo in Texas nigga, we smokin' the best
In a fat ass Sweet, fuck Optimos
Get twenty thousand dollars when we come for the shows
When we get to your city, we fuckin' your hoes
Bend over, let me see it bitch, touch your toes
I'ma tell ya like $hort, I'll fuck your wife
In the game makin' change livin' the players life

Posted like a boss, call me G
Put the mack down on a punk bitch
And she gon' meet me at the room with her two best friends
I come up on a rich bitch
And peel her for a little cash
I'll pimp her 'til she ain't shit
I'll pop my collar and the ho know to get my cash
I like a little hunny
But I'd rather have the money
It's pimpin' in the Bay mayne
And the players out here ain't gon' never change
She gon' sell her pussy
And she gon' bring me back the cash
She gon' sell her pussy
Waitin' for the next ho to come so I could pimp her ass
