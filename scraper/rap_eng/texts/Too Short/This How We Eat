[Goldie Loc talking]
Definition - gangsta, hustla, you know
We make money, we eat, we feed
Pay attention  - (Beitch!!) *beat starts*
Uhh, yeah, come on..
Uhh uhh, make some music..
Dogg House, you know..
$hort Dog peep game, come on

I'm ridin down the street, beat, feets got on twenty-tweets
No beer-belly fool, we get it all for eats
Cocoa Puff the green leaf, cloud up
We some gangstas makin money, never been a scrub
Whattchu know about sellin dope...
But the only thing you good for now, is droppin the soap
Goldie Loc, Tray Deee, Too $hort, no doubt
Tell 'em how we eat and what we all about, nigga

[Too $hort]
These hoes know what's up, niggas been havin game
O.G.'s tell me real good, bitch I'm the same
Motherfucker make 'em feel good, ya know my name
Bitch, if ya still could, you'd do the same
Made thirteen albums in a row
Be like Too $hort baby and pimp a ho
It's so easy, if ya know how to get it
You'll never be another broke-ass nigga

[Hook: Kokane]
We got, top-notch hoes, y'all fools got crack-hoes
We eatin sirloin steak, y'all fools eat Cheerios
We got, top-notch hoes, y'all fools got crack-hoes
We eatin sirloin steak, y'all fools eat Cheerios

[Tray Deee]
Fuck a business suit, I'm out to where we juice
Push the Bentley coupe and spend endless loot
Runnin game from the brain or the stainless steel
Pushin Holt's high-heels when we bang the field
With the heat out, jack the whole hood with G-clout
Invisible perimeters for niggas to keep out
You ain't got to ask what the fuck what we bout
Whatever, get the cheddar than an nigga can ease out

[Goldie Loc]
I used to be able to jump from the free-throw line and bang
Now I bust and crush tracks, nothin really changed
Except, twelve-inch scars on my body
What I mean by that, I was hit by some hotties (nigga)
Call somebody, I'm layin in this motherfucker bloody
It wasn't because of my shoes, clothes, or money
I was at the wrong place at the wrong time
Paramedics don't know, I was a victim of the crime

[talking]
Just keep gettin that money mayne
Fuck them niggas, yeah... this how we eat

[Hook: Kokane]
We got, top-notch hoes, y'all fools got crack-hoes
We eatin sirloin steak, y'all fools eat Cheerios
(Check it out)

[$hort] Don't be trick, you know these hoes so slick
[$hort] Do yo' thang and get rich
[TrayD] Get wise, enterprise with the game ya got
[TrayD] You could slang some rocks, but better change ya spot
[$hort] Ask anybody; I stay paid
[$hort] Most niggas want pussy, tryna get laid
[TrayD] Stayin soft with a ho getchu crossed by a ho
[TrayD] I break a bitch down then I'm off with the dough
[$hort] I'm so hungry, I can't wait to eat
[$hort] I ride brand new shit down the street
[TrayD] Life is a game of chess, who plays the best
[TrayD] is the last one that's laid to rest
[$hort] I know you wanna eat good - it ain't hard
[$hort] to be a real ghetto superstar
[TrayD] Focus is the key - if ya want it, it could be
[TrayD] If ya know where ya goin from the moment you could see
[TrayD] that's game

[Hook: Kokane]

[Big Tigger]
Catch me headed out west, Impala drive
And when they see balkin and be talkin bout (?)
Too $hort, Eastsidaz, and ya boy Big Tig
It's on and poppin now, but we wattn't always this big
Wanted a Benz and a Lotus (what?)
Whatever feels, sprayin Raid on the roaches
I mean the whole damn scene was kinda hopless (whattchu mean?)
Came home to it, then we flipped the notice
Now we big crib livin, Rockland and non-stop
With hot women, cop drops with rims that don't stop spinnin (whoo!)
And it's just the beginnin (what?)
Cuz as long as the game strong we gon' keep winnin
Big Tigger, Too $hort, drops it so mean
That lets us go get us a team of flatscreens
Three cars, three cribs and three bikes
When I drop this hot shit, I'm gonna cop three plus three mics

[talking]
Y'all niggas better stop playin and get yo' game tight
Too $hort, Eastsidaz, Big Tig... oh boy
Album number 13 nigga, y'all better stop chasin the cat
Chase that money, well unless you know
The cat got money (please believe it) this how we eat nigga!
Let's go, oh boy...
