It goes one for the bitches, two for the town
Three for the busters, so get up everybody cause be bout to clown

[Ant Banks]
Yeah, here it is, playa, slump for your trunk
Turn it up and let it bump, straight gangsta funk
For your ass, coming, straight outta Oakland
The city where you get your wig split wide open
Known to most, from coast to coast
As the city of macks and Short Dog's the host
So everybody make way for the dangerous crew
And what we came to do is spit game at you

[Rappin' Ron]
The Rappin' Ron from the motherfucking Dangerous Crew
Nigga duck when I buck cause I'm aiming at you
Cause you know I point my gat at, whoever that I'm mad at
I'm coming from the town so you know I ain't gonna have that
Nigga talking crazy motherfucker
I think you'd better duck and watch a young brother buck a
Nigga in his ass bone cause you can't last long
When I got my mask on I gotta get my blast on
I'm just a gangsta, nigga, you know that I be coming tight
I fucks it up every time that I grabs a mic
My name is Rappin' Ron, I'm one that you can trap and con
Cause now I'm finna hit the four and get me a fat sack of bomb

[Pee Wee]
Like that, crack another sack and let me back up off this yak
And show these playa-hating niggas how to act
Tricks sit back cause I ain't with you bitches tugging on my testicles
You ain't no bitch, you must be fucking homosexual
Hanging on some blueballs, you're on my dick when you call
I told y'all nigga screwballs, you're going like a Ru Pauls
And I ain't got time to listen to rhymes
I'm trying to find, a top of the line bitches
Behind me and you can't grind
So when you're trying to find the number to the motel
Go tell your bitch the crew's due for some mo' tail
And bring your sisters and cousins there, too
I got a stump for your hunt when she fucked with the Crew, nigga

[Ant Diddley Dog]
Ant Diddley motherfucking Dog straight coming like a sick man
Got all these punk bitches sprung on my dick span
Got 'em moving they head cause it's on hit
Now they want long dick, but too late, I'm gone bitch
Hanging with the famous Dangerous Crew, smoking dank
Drinking a gang of brew, look how I came a new
A motherfucking mack, the real McCoy
You still a boy, listen up nigga, kill the noise
Don't act like you don't know I'm from the O
I've been wrecking so when you're steppingbe expecting a chin-checking
A badass influence, ain't never been a punk
Put this in, let it bump, get a fifth and get drunk

[Father Dom]
I mack all kind of bitches, to hell with the snitches
If a nigga trip, I'm a give his ass stitches
Punk pussies pitching fits, cause Dom will never quit
You need to go on with that ho shit, because you no-bitch
Nigga from the North side of Oakland ain't no joke
I used to slang coke, now I'm paid from what I wrote
Doing thangs with the Dangerous Crew
And I thought you knew when I rip I'll have your bitch saying "Ooh
Damn, Father Dom's the man!"
She let me hit that shit from the back, slam bam thank you ma'am
So Ant Diddley pass the dank so your partner can drank and smoke
I'm saying peace out to all of my Dangerous folks

[Too $hort]
Tore that ass bitch when I came to town
'79 dropped Caddy slamming James Brown
Hoes sprung cause I bought a new car again
Take the James Brown out and ride Parliament
I got the L to the double O T bitch
And if you ain't seen me, you ain't seen shit
I gotta send a shout out, to all you niggas wearing pink
Cause you look like a motherfucking bitching thing
(Aw that was fly, dude) I need to check your ass
Cause you a broke-ass nigga, ain't got no cash
And if you're not, I'll tell you what I came to do
Spit the game at you, and make some changes, fool
I run the Dangerous Crew, where every nigga can flow
We make the funky-ass beats and every nigga pimp hoes
Cause we from Oakland, ask us what we smoking
Nothing but the dank and I guarantee that it's potent shit, bitch
