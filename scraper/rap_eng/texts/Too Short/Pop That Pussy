[Intro]
League of Starz

[Verse 1]
She had a rough childhood
All bad, man, it wasn't that good
Her stepdaddy used to play with her
That’s why she walks around with all that hate in her
A born sinner, tryna be a straight winner
If Sister Souljah made a movie, she'd play Winter
Her momma never loved her
And on the day her daddy left, her mama said, "Fuck her"
Went and stayed with her grandmama
But granny's house was hella packed
Six aunties and they all smoked crack
What made it worse, granny lived on the ho track
Where they was robbin’ and shootin'
She grew up in the West like Huey P. Newton
Every day, she witnessed prostitution
Pimps running game, tryna give her solutions

[Chorus]
They said, "Pop that pussy, pop that pussy"
They told her, "Pop that pussy, go on, girl, pop that pussy
Pop that pussy, pop that pussy"
They told her, "Pop that pussy, pop that pussy"

[Verse 2]
He said, "Choose up with a boss, baby, we gon' floss"
Took advantage of a black girl lost
She was 15, but she looked 25
Redbone with some hazel eyes
Got stuck with a pimp when her granny died
Turning tricks in the cold, every night she cried
He beat her so bad, she had to leave
Nowhere to go, no strategy
Just a rent-a-day ho, she's a loose one
I heard she was stripping out in Houston
Finally started winning, tired of losin'
Paying herself, no more choosin'
First time in her life she got her own dough
Stack that money, you ain't hoing no more
Enrolled in school, that's ambition
Tricks pay tuition, the bitch reversed the pimpin’

[Chorus]
Pop that pussy, she had to pop that pussy
Pop that pussy, she learned how to pop that pussy
Go on, girl, pop that pussy, pop that pussy
Hey, pop that pussy, she learned how to pop that

[Verse 3]
She came back to the Bay in a red Benz
Went to the track, seen her old friends
She said, "Bitch, I don’t fuck with no pimp"
Ran into this nigga named Gold Lips
Her old pimp still trippin' on old shit
He said, "I don’t get left by no bitch"
First thing he did was took her keys
Then yelled out, "Bitch, you can't leave"
She flashed back all the shit he used to do
Went inside her purse and grabbed the .22
He said, "Bitch, you ain't gon' shoot"
You could see the rest on the Channel 2 News
On the Channel 2 News, you could see the rest on Channel 2
They told her, "Pop that pussy"
Couldn’t take no more, so she popped that pussy
