[Intro: G-Eazy]
Yeah, Uh
G, Uh

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Every big film needs a supporting cast
She knows she ain't the one but she supportin' that
Room service, bottles, I'mma order that
She got a bomb ass pearl, but it's more than that
She knows what it is and she plays a role
Every girl's not built for it, it takes a toll
She hops on top and she take control
This between us, she won't tell a soul
Our secret, how we keep it
Not everybody business, who I sleep with
Poppin' Dom P, I ain't drinking cheap shit
Me and Too $hort, every bar, gotta bleep it
Album 25 is the pimp tape
That's the OG, how long did this take?
He said "It's an Oakland thang"
Then he sparked another one,  "smoke it mane"

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
It's an Oakland thang
All the side bitches
Let me see you, put them hands up
And all the main bitches
If you know you a main bitch, where you at?
All the main bitches, make some noise
Ayy yo G, why she think I'm too nice?
When every other day I meet a new wife
I ain't got no main, they all side pieces
You can bring all the sand you want to my beaches
It's all god, this a party over here
She suck my dick and I let it in her hair
Cuz I really want to fuck, with her friend over there
Put my dick away and holla like player
I never have on bitch I need two, I don't cum quick
When I bust, I still might not stop
I don't take pills, I just fuck a lot
I'm in her head tryna fuck it up
Bitch gimme all your money then suck it up
And don't worry bout her, she'll turn next
Everything we do is rated XXX

[Verse 3: Ezale]
Well I found out her favorite drug is cocaine
And I get it by the q, have the whole thing
She want to bump, I get it up, get it up
Little bit of coke turn this bitch into a slut
And that's my bitch- I mean side bitch
And I can't fuck her raw because I might slip
It's a trick how she keep it going
And her man don't know that I left the spot
Seem like everybody fucking on the same bitch
But my hoe knows her role, and she knows that I'm famous
No, she don't say shit
And every time we go out I have her pay for it
If she spend time she better spend some money
I just give white snow to a [?]
And her boyfriend a dummy, got him mad as hell
Cuz I got his bitch leaving another voicemail

[Outro: Too $hort]
Yeah, we hella disrespectful
[?] in this bitch, Ezale
OG Short dawg , G-Eazy
You know how we do it in Oakland mane
Yeah, smoke one
We in this bitch
