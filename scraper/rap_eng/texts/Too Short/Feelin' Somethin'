[Chorus: Too $hort]
You wanna shoot that dope? Snort that coke?
Pop them pills? You love the way it makes you feel?
Smoke them ‘woods, them Percs feel good
That lean is real, you love the way it makes you feel

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
What’s up with Afghanistan, that Taliban, that heroin, that Oxycontin
That morphine, that codeine, that Percocet and them Vicodins
You want that poppy seed? You so high, you can’t talk to me
Afghanistan, Colombians, cooking grams like coffee beans
We just want that hookup, man
Selling ki’s, fuck cooking grams
It’s the opioid epidemic , it’s going down and it’s not a gimmick
Fuck that, I’m ‘bout to call Obama
Ever since they killed Osama
Them poppy plants, they got a million of ‘em
And the whole world just fell in love with ‘em

[Chorus: Too $hort]
You wanna shoot that dope? Snort that coke?
Pop them pills? You love the way it makes you feel?
Smoke them ‘woods, them Percs feel good
That lean is real, you love the way it makes you feel

[Interlude: Sucheata Ivey]
I know your ass giving me something
So high, so good, I’m with you, we floatin’ away
We floatin’ away, ah
So high, so good, I feel so good when I’m with you
I know you know, I’m so far away
So far away

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Can I get a line, Obama? Can you put your boy in the game?
I need that Afghan plug, I’m just tryna make some change
Mexicans sell that ‘caine, everybody bang with gangs
Get that bag, boy, nothin’ ain’t ever gon’ stay the same
If it’s poppy seed or coca leaf, we don’t use it, we just smoke the weed
Getting money is how it’s supposed to be
You get rich, you stay close to me
‘Cause heroin makes more than crack
We go to war, we bring it back
It’s what we did in Vietnam, and nobody cared if we lost or won
Just bring home our son, even if he’s hooked on heroin
Give me that dope, I’ll sell you some
It got you hooked, can’t tell you nothin’
These opioids, they everywhere
Pain killers, they hella scary
Fuck around and OD, sippin’ on that codeine

[Interlude: Sucheata Ivey]
I know your ass giving me something
So high, so good, I’m with you, we floatin’ away
We floatin’ away, ah
So high, so good, I feel so good when I’m with you
I know you know, I’m so far away
So far away

[Chorus: Too $hort]
You wanna shoot that dope? Snort that coke?
Pop them pills? You love the way it makes you feel?
Smoke them ‘woods, them Percs feel good
That lean is real, you love the way it makes you feel

[Interlude: Sucheata Ivey]
You know you wanna turn off the lights
Grab my hand and let’s get high
We only got one night
Take a couple shots, nigga, get high
So high, tonight…

[Outro: Too $hort]
The moral of the story is: don’t do drugs
Don’t do drugs…without me
