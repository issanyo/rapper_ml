[Chorus: YMTK]
Pull up in something foreign, strip club money stormin’
Where the ones? Keep ‘em comin’
If you ain’t tippin’ then you boring
Just give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues
Just give ‘em the blues
If you a pimp, keep ‘em hoeing
This pimp shit, keep it going
All these trick niggas ain’t knowing
These bitches, we be on ‘em
And get ‘em to choose, get ‘em to choose, get ‘em choose
Just get ‘em to choose, or give ‘em the blues

[Verse 1: Band-Aide]
Sittin’ on a nigga, flockin’ on a nigga
Rocking chair, yeah, rockin’ on a nigga
Pullin’ up, skrt skrt’n on a nigga
See your bitch and I’m flirtin’ with her, nigga, yeah
Google my name, ha, see what they say
Been giving ‘em blues, Burger King, you get it your way
These fuck niggas always ask about me
Same ones that be talkin’ ‘bout me
Can’t tell if he ass kissin’, if he dick suckin’ or just money countin’
Money flowin’ like a water fountain
Sticky icky got the money pilin’
Coulda hit, my nigga wrist drownin’
But sittin’ on a nigga thousand island
Fuck nigga sayin’ my name, ones with no game
Mad, you lit the whore, huh
‘Cause I’m with two extra whores, Porsche with the two extra doors
Extra bullets and shells—who you gon’ tell we got in the door?
Be giving ‘em blues, they want an encore

[Chorus: YMTK]
Pull up in something foreign, strip club money stormin’
Where the ones? Keep ‘em comin’
If you ain’t tippin’ then you boring
Just give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues
Just give ‘em the blues
If you a pimp, keep ‘em hoeing
This pimp shit, keep it going
All these trick niggas ain’t knowing
These bitches, we be on ‘em
And get ‘em to choose, get ‘em to choose, get ‘em choose
Just get ‘em to choose, or give ‘em the blues

[Verse 2: Oke Junior]
Yeah, I need all huneds with the blue strips, got ‘em feeling some type of way
His main bitch steady choosing up when she see some real niggas come her way
I’m in the strip club steady tippin’ her; ass fat, I can’t get enough
Kick her out once I get a nut; savage mode, I don’t give a fuck
East Oakland, yeah, that’s what I’m reppin’ nigga—these dudes ain’t bout it bout it
Pullin’ up in that old school; gonna run up on me, man, I highly doubt it
Shorty always tryna spend the night; phone off, give me space, hoe
I’m in the air like a real player, make her do whatever I say so
I need the whip and chains like Django; Fabby scooped me in that Range Rover
Free the bitch, I’m never cuffin’ it; I can show you niggas how the game goes
Town Business if you ain’t know, no time for a lame hoe
Only focus on the bankroll, going places that they can’t go

[Chorus: YMTK]
Pull up in something foreign, strip club money stormin’
Where the ones? Keep ‘em comin’
If you ain’t tippin’ then you boring
Just give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues, give ‘em the blues
Just get ‘em to choose, or give ‘em the blues

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
I’m pimpin’, she’s hoeing
Great girls, yeah, it’s snowing
Good weed I’m blowing
Smoke too much, now I’m zoning
Fuck too much when I’m boning
Bust a nut, now she own it
Bitch, you want this long dick?
Well, that’s what you gon’ get
All that money, I’m taking it
Can’t fuck with me, you ain’t make this shit
‘Cause meaningful relationships are like aliens and spaceships
Is it real? I’m so sincere
Ain’t no women, just hoes in here
We don’t want the good girls out there
Ask a player, we don’t care
It’s like last week, ask Ashley
I don’t let nothin’ get past me
Twerkin’ all day in them ass cheeks
You a stripper? Don’t flash me
‘Cause my pimpin’, it never ends
New girls, we break ‘em in
Little homies, we make ‘em pimps
Then they pull up in a brand new Benz
BITCH!

[Chorus: YMTK]
If you a pimp, keep ‘em hoeing
This pimp shit, keep it going
All these trick niggas ain’t knowing
These bitches, we be on ‘em
And get ‘em to choose, get ‘em to choose, get ‘em choose
Just get ‘em to choose, or give ‘em the blues
