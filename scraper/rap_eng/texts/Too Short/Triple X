[woman] Short Dawg!

[Too $hort]
What's on yo' mind ho?  That nigga Too $hort
Got you playin witcho' pussy fo' twenty-fo'
In the mo'nin, why I won't call you back
Got another little freak all on my lap
She's been tellin me things that I wanna hear
So I hit you on another day, another year maybe
I still wanna see you baby
I know I told a few lies, you wanna be my lady
I let you ride with a player in my new truck
Take you straight to my house, you can do me up
And back down again, get around your friends
Let 'em know, e'ry nigga from the town's a pimp
My daddy was a player, my grandpa too
Now what the fuck else am I supposed to do?
Put my finger on the pussy, rub the nipple next
Short Dawg's in the house with the triple X
I'm a hooker's dream, a hoe's delight
They prove it, with bankrolls every night
You like to kiss her, she like to drink sperm
Get you high, smokin that pink sherm
I don't have sex with her, she just give me head
Like the ex-President, I don't need a bed
Let it drip down your cheek, get all on your dress
Rinse the evidence or rub it all on your tits
I don't care - cause I'm cold as ice
I don't feel nothin for you, think you know I'm nice
That's what you heard about Todd when I'm gettin hoes
Leave a trail of broken hearts when I let 'em go
It's not my fault, cause they be all in the club
Believin what I say, bitches fallin in love
When all I really wanted was a little sex
Turn your ass out with my triple X

[Chorus: female singer]
It's Short Dawg, he came to play the game
So whatch'all wanna do?  He'll make you say his name (Short Dawg)
It's Short Dawg, he came to play the game
So whatch'all wanna do?  He'll make you say his name (Short Dawg!)

[Too $hort]
Now what you bouts to do, little prostitute
I see that sucka in ya ear but I gots to shoot
Some real game your way, what I came to say
Is what I did yesterday it ain't gon' change today
And if I cain't knock you I bet I get her
Cause I'm a hard workin pimp, I'm not a quitter
These hatin lames, don't even realize
Short Dawg's dirty rhymes make them fantasize
I don't dream about pussy cause I get too much
Can't believe that nasty slut didn't let you fuck
But maybe you ain't ready for the skills she got
Non-stop, hit the cot, the bitch still be hot
She's workin tonight, she'll stick to the script
My life is so tight, when hoes flip you tricks
Put a sponge on her pussy and she'll still be wet
Another bitch turned out by my triple X
It's nothin new - I've ran up in a few
Hit the party had the hardest G's cuffin them too
Cause I'm a mack, the whole world knows that
I'm in the house, you better hold your hoes back
Fuck $hort - that's what the bitches thinkin
Put my hand up her dress and her clit was stinkin
I gotta pass!  Pussy smell like ass
So I jumped in my Benz and gave it hella gas
I can't believe you nasty girls tryin to get some
Sit on my shit and give my dick the runs
Like the East coast homies they don't slip son
Too many women in the world, you bound to get one
That slick bitch, dressed her up and played the road
But all my niggas out in Texas say the bitch is throwed
She snort coke, rollin on them triple stacks
Rated X in the back while we dip the 'llac, beotch!

[Chorus]
