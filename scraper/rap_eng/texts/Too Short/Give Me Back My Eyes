[Verse 1: YMTK]
I'm following, you are the sign
Intoxicated, you can tell it's in my eyes
All in your space, you wit' it though
I'm past my limit but I'm finna order more
You took it right away, babe, took my vision from me
Shooting my shot now
Pulling up like I'm Curry, far away, a hand in my face
Baby, let your guard down
I thought about cuffin' when we locked eyes
Far as my attention, girl, you got it
I swear you stole 'em, straight up robbery, my vision is gone

[Chorus: YMTK]
Baby, give me back my eyes, they're on you
Yeah, you got my eyes on you
Girl, you know what I'm trying to do
Baby, give me back my, just give me back my
Baby, give me back my eyes, they're on you
Girl, you got my mind on you
Girl, you know what I'm trying to do
Give me back my, baby, give me back my

[Verse 2: Too Short]
She's the baddest little bitch I ever seen in my life
I couldn't stop staring, I thought about her all night
She gon' make somebody happy, she gon' break somebody's heart
She gon' give you pretty babies if you love her from the start
I lost some good ones, mayne
Keep her if you got her
You want that new pussy but that one you got is hotter
Niggas layin' in the cut, hoping you fuck up
Slide up in your main thang and treat her like a slut
I saw her yesterday, she looked too good
You need to do something wrong, I wish you would
Make her hella mad, so I can tell her that
She fuck with me, I'll buy her better shoes and better bags
And even though I'm not, I'ma hit that spot
I can see her with my eyes closed, she tellin' me "don't stop"
She's the finest muthafucka I seen in a while
I'm Ray Charles in that pussy, I don't need to see her now

[Chorus: YMTK]
Baby, give me back my eyes, they're on you
Yeah, you got my eyes on you
Girl, you know what I'm trying to do
Give me back my, baby, give me back my
Tryin' to get on you

[Verse 3: YMTK]
You got me feeling faith in
All up on your body when I'm doing my thing
I love to fool with that shit
Vision hella blurry and I'm cool with that
Poppin' her bubble gum, blow it, babe
Now you see what I see, and I don't see no stop sign
Only you and I are fine, combination's complete
A reason to stop, girl, I just can't see
I thought about cuffin' when we locked eyes
Far as my attention, girl, you got it
I swear you stole 'em, straight up robbery
My vision is gone

[Chorus: YMTK]
Baby, give me back my eyes, they're on you
Yeah, you got my eyes on you
Girl, you know what I'm trying to do
Give me back my, baby, give me back my
Tryin' to get on you
On you, tryin' to get on you, on you, girl, yeah yeah
On you, tryin' to get on you, on you, girl, yeah yeah
