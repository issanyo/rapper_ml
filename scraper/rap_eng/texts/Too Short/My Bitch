If she want it with me tell her bitch don’t try me
Hide and seek should’ve let her clear up like I’m visine

[Verse 2]
Get pretty paint the city
Everytime I step out had a ride with me
Should’ve known better let the brother get trippy
Waiting and praying I wouldn’t get caught slipping
Okay hey that’s how it be when you have a bun b
Believe me these hefers get greasy
Like all of this time I was trying help the blonde she too mad she can’t see me
Wait a minute bird I know I want to throw you some bread
When no one left you for dead
Same n*gga who went upside your head
When we walk in your crib he all up in your bed diggin in your last friend man
If I had twenty dollars then you had ten
Why you think we hella mad cause you see me win
But it’s good sis in the end now I’m getting ready and a broke bum dog on hen

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You suppose to be my bitch
I know you ain’t shit
Money start missing so I gave you the benefit
Lips so loose should’ve known you was sucking d*ck
Running out the mouth I know you good with the tit
Too friendly with my n*gga’s so I know you with the shit
Soon as thing started going bad know your ass would flip
Tried to blackmail me like I ain’t that bitch
Mad I’m ignoring your little request
Two different records I don’t f*ck with peasants
Little frustrated this called a lesson
Counted you out like God giving me blessings
Guess it’s you [?] before you be testing
A lot of things wrong just trying to correct it
I’m almost there just trying to perfect it
Lot of them gone but I know you catch it
[?] on they feeling neglected

[Verse 3]
Everytime I see you I should drag you
Cave man that hoe hope your next n*gga right hook jab you I ain’t mad boo
Always f*cking somebody n*gga but never have a n*gga of your own
Side bitch is your only crown never been a queen always dance alone
You supposed to be my bitch
You supposed to be my bitch
You supposed to be my bitch
You supposed to be my bitch
Stealing shit I would’ve gave you
Stealing d*ck I would’ve gave you
Told my secrets and stayed too
One silly bitch I made you
