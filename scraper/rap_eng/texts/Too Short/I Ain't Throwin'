[Intro: Mowii]
I ain’t throwin’ no money
I ain’t throwin’ no money
I ain’t throwin’ no money
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You know what? I give a fuck about a bitch

[Verse 1: Mowii]
Nigga, who is that?
She ain’t nothin’ but a ringtone (Why?)
‘Cause she everybody theme song
I let it rain, bitch, leave me ‘lone
I ain’t broke, I’m in the green zone
I just touched down on a hoe, look
If she fuckin’ up, I throw the flag on the floor
If she bad, get her number, call a blitz on that hoe
And then I add up everything that I get from that hoe, let it go
Let it go, stop swingin’ on the pole
Line it up, free throw, two shots, let it go
Ten-hut, ten-hut, baby, either right or left
They don’t give you no money mean you don’t wanna fuck?
Pop that pussy like a cork
Made it motor for the sport
Got her comin’ out her shirt when she twerk
And cat daddy go to work

[Chorus: Mowii + Too $hort]
I ain’t throwin’ no money
She wanna smoke, you wanna eat and drank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You wanna fuck then count my bank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
Little bitch, I don’t care if you strip
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You know what? I give a fuck about a bitch

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
They ain’t gon’ play this at the strip club
But I don’t give a fuck if the bitch fuck
I ain’t got nothin’ on the pussy
Stop asking for shit, you too pushy
No, I don’t need no ones
I’m wondering why this bitch ain’t giving me no funds
You want me to throw all my money at her?
I ain’t giving her shit, I ain’t giving her…
I’d get some money with a bitch
It’s some hoes out here getting chips
This other bitch got her hands out
I said, “Bitch, stop pulling your pants down
Standing there looking like you wanna cry
You wanna sell me something I don’t wanna buy
I don’t want a discount, and I don’t want it for free
You selling pussy? You better sell it for me”

[Chorus: Mowii + Too $hort]
I ain’t throwin’ no money
She wanna smoke, you wanna eat and drank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
I ain’t throwin’ shit, I don’t care what y’all think
I ain’t throwin’ no money
Little bitch, I don’t care if you strip
I ain’t throwin’ no money
I give a fuck about a bitch

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
The game, that’s what I represent
So if you see me, just say, “What’s up, pimp?”
You ain’t gotta tell me what you spent
‘Cause these bitches, they nicknamed “Your rent”
And that’s cool, if that’s how you feel
You like to help a bitch out with her bills?
It’s all in the name of fun, she gon’ give you some
If you throw a few thousand ones

[Chorus: Mowii + Too $hort]
I ain’t throwin’ no money
She wanna smoke, you wanna eat and drank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You wanna fuck then count my bank?
I ain’t throwin’ no money
Little bitch, I don’t care if you strip
I ain’t throwin’ no money
You know what? I give a fuck about a bitch
