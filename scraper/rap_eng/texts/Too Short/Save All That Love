[Intro]
P-P-P-Lo, time to bring the bass back

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
I don't wanna be your main nigga
Ho, you stayin' with that lame nigga
I don't even wanna hang with ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
Save that love for your boyfriend
Save all that love for your boyfriend (Huh)

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
She in love with the fella, I don't blame her though
The cubicle's hittin', I got like 80 on (Like 80 on)
Tell your nigga I'm your brother, we can play the role (Play the role)
I fuck with her 'cause baby was down to play along (Huh)
I fuck with her 'cause baby gave me that mainey throat
Getting suction in the load, didn't take me long
Uber on the way, I couldn't take her home
She ain't wanna leave, you don't make her moan
Free the beast, unc taught me how to break a ho
I was twelve, riding shotgun taking notes
So we gon' get it going like we 'posed to do ('Posed to do)
Need to execute in every car rollin' through (Uh)
If you a queen on this team, gotta show and prove
30K a month, bitch, you know the rules
30K a month, bitch, you know the rules
Call Lyft or go and blow it on a set of jewels

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
I don't wanna be your main nigga
Ho, you stayin' with that lame nigga
I don't even wanna hang with ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
Save that love for your boyfriend
Save all that love for your boyfriend (Huh)

[Verse 2: Nef the Pharaoh]
Save the L-U-V
And don't squirt, that shit smell like pee, I'm worth more than a key
Your baby momma paid the ordering fee
And all my warriors just scoring with me, shoutout to Murph, no Lee
You sucka boys shoulda played on grief
Bless the bitch, the ho preyed on me, I spent a safe on my fleece
Her man gone, she wanna call me and creep
Narcolepsy, she gon' suck me to sleep, bust all in her teeth
Neffy a Chief but I don't smoke on Keef
Offense, so I threw her on D and then she threw it on me
I'm on fire like Pepsi did Michael
Can I hit your rear bumper without you calling up Geico?
Pussy so good I might fuck her on her cycle
Psych, bitch, I'm playing, I would never have a wife, ho
I gave her dick then took it back, she deprived
I'm the type of boss nigga that change lives

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
I don't wanna be your main nigga
Ho, you stayin' with that lame nigga
I don't even wanna hang with ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
Save that love for your boyfriend
Save all that love for your boyfriend (Huh)

[Verse 3: Too Short]
Where you learn how to that, Secret Sunday?
Shake that monkey, Magic City on a Monday (On a Monday)
Let me show you how I handle mine
You hang around me, you'll have a damn good time (Uh)
Colombiana, I love your people
I fuck her real good, she be yellin' "mijo"
Everybody know I love the se√±oritas
I can't get enough, my chica bonita
'Cause she's always wet and she stay horny
I fell asleep, woke up, she was laying on me
Had my dick in her mouth, she was playing on me
Looked me in my eye and said, "Say you want me"
I don't wanna be your man, I don't care if you're pretty
I'ma fly you to the Bay and have sex in the city
At The W, or maybe The Clift
Can't say you my wife, but you can say you my bitch

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
I don't wanna be your main nigga
Ho, you stayin' with that lame nigga
I don't even wanna hang with ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
I'm just tryna put that thang in ya
Save that love for your boyfriend
Save all that love for your boyfriend (Huh)
