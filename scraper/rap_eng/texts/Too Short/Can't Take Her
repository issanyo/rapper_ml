[Intro: Too $hort]
Short Dog…

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I’m just tryna find me a winner
Take her somewhere and put nine up in her
I gots no time for beginners
I put her on top and then I spin her
She got that good head on her shoulders
Arch that back when I tell her roll over
And if I fuck her real good, she let me cream in her mouth
My dick ain’t in her pussy, why she screamin’ so loud?
She just a cum freak, she can’t wait ‘til I bust
The bitch loves real niggas like us (What she like?)
She likes girls and boys, she like playing with toys
She like licking and sucking, and when she first started fuckin’
She ain’t have to learn nothin’, she’s a sexpert
Give a dick or a pussy and she gon’ make it squirt
And if you make her scream loud, she’ll say “Daddy, fuck me harder”
You better not stop her once you get started
Getting sloppy head, dick soakin’ wet
She uses both hands when she wanna stroke the dick
That’s a whole lotta muthafuckin’ spit, bitch
If you did this for a living, you would get rich
She ain’t tryna hear that shit, nigga, she ain’t playin’
She ain’t tryna fuck a trick like you if you ain’t payin’
She just tryna light that weed, and pour me a drink
You wanna fuck, you better tell her what you think
BITCH!

[Chorus: YMTK]
Fly nigga with a ride or die bitch
Close-knit, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down
And break ‘em, break ‘em, weak nigga, you can’t take her, take her
Dope pussy, dope dick, dope mix
Gotta stir it up, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down
And break ‘em, break ‘em, weak nigga, you can’t take her, take her

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
They call me Short Dog, I’m famous, mayne
For three decades, I’ve been spittin’ game
Where your bitch at—you tryna find her?
I been having broads in the A before Desiigner
I keep a new whip, my shit is too clean
Still pimpin’ on a bitch, same routine
Same ol’ Todd, same blue jeans
Getting money out a bitch ‘cause I move mean
I got a hundred bands from a bitch
I ain’t gotta sell records to be rich
I got a whole lotta ice on my wrists
That bitch could leave, nigga, I don’t give a shit
‘Cause I got another bitch in Miami Beach
A real freak, she flies back and forth every week
She works at KOD, and AOD
It’s all on a bitch, you know it’s AOB
I met this bitch, her name was Bitch
She was Dubai and her daddy was rich
She said whatever I want, she would buy
I told the bitch I want a red Lamborghini that flies
All these hoes in my life
And I ain’t ever once tried to make one my wife
I just break ‘em out and stick to the paper route
It’s pimpin’ on a bitch—what’s all this hate about?

[Chorus: YMTK]
I’m just a fly nigga with a ride or die bitch
Close-knit, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down
And break ‘em, break ‘em, weak nigga, you can’t take her, take her
Dope pussy, dope dick, dope mix
Gotta stir it up, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down
And break ‘em, break ‘em, weak nigga, you can’t take her, take her

[Outro: YMTK]
Dope pussy, dope dick, dope mix
Stir it up, bad bitch won’t quit
Keep it lit, hella solid, hold my shit down…
