[E-40]
It be her friends nigga that's who
It be your bitch friends nigga they be..
Nigga they be all up in your mix nigga
I don't even, ay nigga she don't love you nigga
She just used to you nigga, oh boy!

[Intro] + (E-40)
I can't tell but I need to know just how you feel
I can't hold it inside I've got my pride so tell me what's the deal
(What's the deal?)
Is it love, or just could it be, that you're used to me?
(She used to you nigga!)
It's been some time but you're still on my mind
So baby talk to me

[E-40]
You took her she went from the
Ghetto streets, to executive streets electronic beeps
Two-way pagers, Palm 7's, M-11's
Illegal weapons, mesmerized by the dope game
Smith & Wesson's, never went back for seconds
Sprung.. SPRUNG?
Not on yo' dick dick (but what) but on yo' tongue tongue
Jealous (jealous) overprotective (protective)
E'ry chance you get, you slack bruh

[Too $hort]
Domestic violence, she got you whylin
Do yo' thang, I don't understand how you get mad
Cause you fuck around to beat her ass
And she don't wanna be around you
Now you miss her lil' funky ass breath in the mornin
Call her up, tell her how you want it
To be in love you gotta pay yo' dues
The bitch got you singin the blues, nigga

[Chorus]
I can't tell but I need to know just how you feel
I can't hold it inside I've got my pride so tell me what's the deal
Is it love, or just could it be, that you're used to me?
It's been some time but you're still on my mind, so baby talk to me

[Too $hort]
Domestic violence, that's what they call it
You don't smoke weed and you ain't a alcoholic
Ain't nothin wrong, with bein in love
But you act like a fool when you see her in the club
It's like me and my money, "Can't Stay Away"
Together, twenty-fo' hours a day
Real love - but can you tell if it's real?
Bitch you better tell me how you feel!

[E-40]
L-U-V, luv (LUV!) Backwards that spells EVIL (evil)
Connivin, triflin ass people (people)
Uhh - kinda soda(?)
Wifebeater tanktop, restrainin order
All up in her kitchen (in her kitchen)
But have you noticed how she fuck different (different)
It ain't the crevice that you wanna shank
It's me - 'Fat Bank Take Little Bank', BEO-EO-ITCH! .. SHEEEAT!

[Chorus]

[E-40]
I was in the jun-gle, Marin City
Get some butt she set me up and never let me fuck!
It's about approximately 20 minutes past the hour
I'm in the Eddie Bauer

[Too $hort]
It's so comfortable, we can't fuck around no mo'
You makin deals, you need to clown that ho
But you forgive her, can't live with her
Can't live without her - but you doubt her

[E-40]
Love (LOVE!) Sometimes spells catastrophe
Elizabeth, Marcia, Daphne
He wanted mo' sex (mo' sex!)
The bitch stole his Rolex (Rolex)

[Too $hort]
You know why?  The bitch shouldn'ta been trusted
Do you wanna love her, do you wanna fuck the bitch
Makes no difference, handle yo' business
If it ain't love, then what the fuck is this?

[Chorus]
