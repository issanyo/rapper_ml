Rap Verse (Too $hort):

Is that Too $hort? Yeah it's really me
You act shy but you a lil freak
I see how you dance to the right song
You act so different when the lights on
I seen you with the lights off
You want'em nice and hard you don't like soft
Daddies lil angel round your family
But you so nasty (bxtch!)

Verse 1 (DecadeZ):

Don't ask why I called you over
Move your body like a cobra
Baby imma be yo' soldier
Put it down on you then hold ya'
You knew what was up when you rolled up
Haters hating on us get no love
Me and you alone and it goes up
Imma do you right sho' nuff

Chorus
You gone be my baby or nah?
You gone hit my crib up and chill later on
You gone be my baby or nah?
You gone kiss me on my neck and tell me im the bomb
Look I know you like to play innocent ( i know you like to play innocent)
In a sense I'm innocent too (in a sense I'm innocent too)
Yeah yeah yeah You like to play innocent (you like to play innocent)
In a sense I'm innocent too
You like to play innocent

Verse 2 (DecadeZ):

I fell in love at first sight
I knew that I'd do you right
Exactly how you like it
If it feel right then don't fight it
You'd be a fool not to come with the cool
Teach you a lesson I'll take you to school
I feel like it's a blessing when I'm with you

Chorus
