Little girls of the world, you're all so sprung
15, 16 and all so young
I thought about you just last night
Grabbed my pen then I started to write
A rap that'll cap like a true blue rap
Not a washed-up almost MC sap
Little girls so fresh and I know you are
Wanna take a little ride in my new car
I see you more than baby, it's more like hell
You screw a little girl and end up in jail
Even though she seems she's 19
You're looking at her body an it's breaking your jeans
Well you know she's not, so don't play dumb
Little girls walking round trying to give me some
But I tell them like this, I'm the player $hort
Playing freaks like you is just a sport
I'm coming way too real and I can never be funny
Niggas like me just want your money
Give it up, cause I'm no lost cause
Little girl recognize Too $hort's the boss
When they turn 16, we all find out
What little girls like that are all about
So you girls out there, that fit my rhyme
You'd better think twice before you jump on mine
Little girl's so thick, you might think she's grown
But if you knew when she was born, you might leave her alone
She's trouble homeboy, with a big fat "T"
Little girls like that make old men peek
Then a brother like me might break my neck
Looking back saying "Ooooh!" Bout to get in a wreck
Cause she's always flirting, might give me a look
Like I put her in the oven and she started to cook
But when I put her on the spot, she could not hang
With my so rough, so tough Playboy game
I only said two words, something like "Get busy"
Her head started hurting and she got real dizzy
Growing up too fast, all you little girls
Letting brothers like me cold crush your world
Should've listen to your momma when she told you so
But you went and got G'd now you want some more
They ain't paying me money, talking 'bout love
And the other girl's who I'm thinking of
Can you understand, I'm just a man
I want to come in this world and cold take command
So just step on back, while I walk on by
I might look you down, and I might say "Hi"
And if you come up choosing, I just might laugh
Say "Little girl check me out in about two and a half...years"

I took a little girl to a drive in show
Jumped in the back and heard "No no no"
She was only 16 but the girl was ripe
36-24 and a 35
I was wasting time spitting lines
Thinking 'bout going home cold getting mine
Baby said, "Stop it." I said, "Drop it."
I tried everything but I could not cop it
I was going to the store about a month ago
Met another girl that just loved my show
We talked for a while and it was all about
Having big fun later on at her house
She said her pops was gone but her mother was there
And everything was cool cause she don't care
So I gave her a ride, kissed her goodbye
I said I'd be back and we all know why
Went to find my thrill up on that hill
I was coming right back with the power drill
I had fun for a while but it wasn't enough
When it all got good, her pops showed up
He must have walked in the room and said "Young punk"
Cause when he walked in the room, he smelled the funk
Then he tried to mash, but I don't play
Cause I was out of that window and on my way
Little girl

Every night you call and say "Come by"
You tell me things changed and I know you lie
I came by last week, you said drive on up
And your pops came out talking all that stuff
Next night we made a date for 9 o'clock
And I always wondered why you walked the block
I saw you waiting on the corner when I made the turn
I didn't really think about it cause I wasn't concerned
I said, "You look so good, but you always do"
I was rushing to the house for the old 1 2's
But the ones ain't cool, and the twos don't work
Every time I tried, you kept saying it hurts
And then it all came out under all your tears
It seems you only been alive for 15 years
You could have fooled me baby with your lying scheme
Said you worked in the mall and just turned 18
When it came down to it, I couldn't go through it
It's all so sad cause you wanted to do it
Little girl, you want to have some fun
You'd better wait a few years cause you're much too young
Stop playing games, you might find a guy
Who will like you for yourself, not for all your lies
So I put it like this, and I don't play
If I see your young ass, I'm not going your way
Little girl
