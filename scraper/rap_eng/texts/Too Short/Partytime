Party time
It's party time

Without a doubt I'm coming back and I would do it again
You can take away my beat and don't touch my pen
My name is Short that's so fake because I rap so long
Other rappers hear pop I put funk in this song
Young tender on the floor wiggle it all
Homeboy keeps telling her to give him a call
He's been on her since ten and it's almost two
Walking through the party with his dick on the roof
Tryin' to catch a little freak in the mini skirt
She was dancing real nasty all the boys like her
You can handle like a dog but you won't get game
You'll only get dog fake number and name
She's a mother to be and you better believe
You'll be looking at her mean next time you meet
Young tender won't care, she's still fine
Here you come again with your playboy lines

You don't stop

The party start jumping five hours ago
The mix don't stop till it's way past four
At three A.M I hit the scene
Buck-toothed freaks drop at three-fifteen
Pull out with one ditch the other
I jumped in my ride and I burnt rubber

Party time
Get busy
Too Short

She's the one, love those legs
Danced two records but it seems like days
Baby so fine I keep telling myself
I want the young tender under my love spell
She could be all mine, nothing more or less
Life with a smile never, ever depressed
I give her ever lasting love around the clock
Baby doll it's you and me so just rock

Breakdown

All you superficial rappers will cease to exist
If I come into a party hitting raps like this
Though I make you feel weak when you want to be strong
Your soft so buddy as I state in my song
According to the scriptures in the book of rhymes
Biting on a line is considered a crime
Unintelligent? Yes!
Never fresh!
RUN DMC tattooed in your chest
I'll tell you one time and one time only
You might be fresh if you weren't so phony
The ability to rap is a gift from God
And your biting what your writing and it won't be bought
At the spur of a moment I will bust a rap
Simultaneously jamming with the beat in the back

Party time!
Get busy
Party time
Party time so get busy

Shake it, bake it, make it, break it
Work that body girl just don't fake it
I'm the kinda brother for a girl like you
I can see in your eyes that you know it's true
I'm the mack and the ? from the big Oak Town
Laying track by track that vicious sound
All you sucker MC's hating my face
Even though there's not a rapper who could take my place
You better hook
Look
Or just get took
I know what you're about, see I read you like a book
Desperate dreams are on your mind
With a 10 foot mic you couldn't touch my rhyme
I'm impeccable rapping
Don't stop capping
Front one time and you'll see what happens

Party time
Get busy

So fresh to the sound
I get down
I'm so fresh from the Oakland town
