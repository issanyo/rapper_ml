[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, it's about that time, yeah
Time ta take off partna, alright?
Hustle Gang, uh huh, G-D-O-G
Get your doe or die, partna
Yup, leggo

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah, you know what it is
Pockets full of numbers, rubber bands and bills
Came up from 'round, that standard wheel
Was finna do a de, 'bout 60 mill
You ain't lived that life, you perpetrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of prey
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any da
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your jersey, man
If your partner want some, we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E G-A-N-G, yeah, wait
Yeah, pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go ahead, Gaga

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
And you've surveyed the way weâ€™ve acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Everybody want that money, what you want
High as hell, trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet event, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks
Bitch!

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, baby, hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, baby, hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

[iTunes Festival: Beat Break]
DJ White Shadow!

[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I am influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving her money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'mma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business, but I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels and drugs

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, baby, hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, baby, hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money
