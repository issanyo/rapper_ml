The lights are on, the club is closed
You don't wanna leave cause you love the hoes
Somethin' ain't right, you doin' bad tonight
You'll be all alone if you don't have a wife
Cause these ladies ain't feelin' you
They don't wanna know what you can really do
They just wanna make you disappear
Get the fuck up out a bitches ear
Take that shit back over there
Go away, she don't wanna know you player
What you gotta say, just like this
Loud as you can, say "Fuck that bitch"
Five minutes ago, you was thinkin' would she
Roll out with you, and give you some pussy
I don't think that's goin' down
But you don't wanna go home now

(It's time to go)
Get up out my face
You better get up out my face
Get up out my face
You need to get up out my face
(It's time to go)
Get up out my face
You better get up out my face
Get up out my face
Get the fuck up out my face

You came to my house with a maxi pad
Bitch you goin' home in a taxi cab
No more limos, run the meter
We might need stitches, this one's a bleeder
Grab yo' shit girl, it's time to go
You look good, but you ain't my kind of ho
Another time on another day
We could hook up, make love and play
It really can't happen no other way
Girl do you hear what a brotha say?
Don't leave anything in my room
I got another freak, she'll be here soon
She might not be, as wild you
It's 4 AM and right now she'll do
She's not a super freak, and she's not a ho
But when she gets here, you gotta go

[Hook]
(It's time to go)
Get up out my face
You better get up out my face
Get up out my face
You need to get up out my face
(It's time to go)
Get up out my face
You better get up out my face
Get up out my face
Get the fuck up out my face

[Too $hort]
We did what we did so let's do what we do
We had fun, but now I'm through with you
I gotta run, I'll call you in a few days
I'll be back, to get some more cooch-ay
Cause you do it, better than most
At this rate, we'll probably never be close
But that's okay, cause that's not the mission
You could cheat on your man if you got permission
I'll give it to ya, I'll beat it so well
When we finished, we gotta leave the hotel
That's all... I'm the #1 Player
You can call, or I'll see you somewhere
As long as we make this happen again
Yo' fine ass sittin' back in the Benz
Cause yours is the best, I must confess
But right now, it's time to get dressed

[Hook]
(It's time to go)
Get up out my face
You better get up out my face
Get up out my face
You need to get up out my face
(It's time to go)
Get up out my face
You better get up out my face
Get up out my face
Get the fuck up out my face
(It's time to go)

You need to get on up out my face... {You gotta go}
(It's time to go)
You need to get on up out my face... {It's time to go}
(It's time to go)
