I got to get a bitch and get my dick sucked [x4]
From the weed house
Straight to the strip club
Got to get a bitch and get my dick sucked
I pull heat from the hip braw???
All I fuck with is gangsters and strippers
She's a killer and a sweet thang
Set a nigga up
Put the money in the g-strang
Now throw them g's up
And tell that bitch to get up off her knees slut
Cuz we get rowdy at night
Them scary mother fuckers no how we like to fight
That's why they leave
When we Show up
And all your little bitches see me and hoe up
Square people don't want me around
We get crunk in the A
Were gonna dumben the town???
They say we like the clown
But we get to stupid all that hyphy sound
(What, what, what)
How you like me now, all the gangsters and strippers
How you like my style, I fuck with gangsters and strippers
I know im kinda wild like the gangsters and strippers
It about time you find out, All I fuck with is gangsters and strippers
I don't blown on this???
I'm a California nigga all the hoes know this
Ya were smoking purple
Pedal to the metal
We will be going tin circles
All you smell is weed and rubber
If I hit your baby's mama, Im a mother fucker
Cuz she's loving me
Staring in my face she wants to fuck with me
I want to fuck her too
And I always know just what to do
Your baby mamas a stripper
A town business
It won't take long to get her
She's a cute lil thick thing
I got it going dome on the dick main???
I miss saying when I spit game
Then I dump em
And flush em like s*** stains
How you like me now, all the gangsters and strippers
How you like my style, I f*** with gangsters and strippers
I know im kinda wild like the gangsters and strippers
It about time you find out, All I f*** with is gangsters and strippers
You see me at the strip club
Outside bout to pick a b**** up
Around 4 am
Im up all night you know I am
And if you f*** with me
I'll make one phone call
Call up some g's
Relax! Don't tell me what to do
I kick back and watch all hell break lose
I feel sorry for ya'll cuz once they start you gotta fight em off
You see the front door
You better run
You ain't ever got jumped before, Its fun
When you're doing the jumping
Turn his mutha f***in head into a pumpkin
Sock him in his mouth
Knock the n**** out
And take his girl to the house and dig it out
(b****, b****, b****)
Gotta get a b**** and get my d*** sucked [x4]
