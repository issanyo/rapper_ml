[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (ten)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
You can count ‘em, mayne
One giving head, two in the bathroom, three in the bed
It’s a twerk contest in the middle of the room
You already know I’ma fuck something soon
Now look up, bitch, suck that dick
If she ain’t paying, nigga, fuck that bitch
I ain’t tryna hate, I know it’s your career
But girl, you the finest muthafucka in here
You so fine you gotta figure
Stay with me or you could choose that nigga
What you want—coke, weed, drank?
I don’t give a fuck what a punk bitch think
Shut up, bitch, fuck up, bitch
Talk that shit, get fucked up, bitch
You the one sucking dick at the hotel
Cheating on your man but I won’t tell

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (ten)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
If my old bitch is your new bitch
And I’m there, she gotta suck two dicks
‘Cause the bitch gon’ do what I tell her to
And pay these hoes is what I never do
Who you lying on, bitch?
You not the main one, you a side hoe, bitch
Why you all on my dick?
Now you understand why I’m calling you a bitch
You got no job, you can’t afford that shit
All up in the club and you’re way too lit
What you gon’ do, keep swiping them cards?
Buy me new shit, make my dick get hard?
You know you look good from your head to your shoes
Staring in my face like, “Player, what it do?”
It’s the way you move, baby, I’m lovin’ you
The afterparty’s in my suite at The W

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (ten)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches (bad bitches)
Nigga, I’m with ten bad bitches in my hotel room
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down
She goin’ up up up up up up up
It’s goin’ down down down down down down down
