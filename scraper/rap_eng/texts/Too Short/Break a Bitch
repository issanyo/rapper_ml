[Chorus]
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Which one are you?

[Verse 1]
Break a bitch, pimp a ho
Shooting dice, 10 or 4
Hit my point, I'm winning mo'
You can't control her, what you pimpin' for?
Paying bills, buying cars
You want some pussy, you gotta buy the broad
Don't lie to me, you slippin', homie
You can't afford it, why you trickin' on it?
Break a bitch, pimp a ho
I'm on that pimp shit, she finna know
If she ain't with the business, I'ma let her go
She listen to me, she'll be a better ho
Break a bitch, pimp  a ho
I'm on the corner at the liquor store
I told her I want her, now she gettin' mo'
She smiled when I said "You my bitch, ho!"
You my bitch, ho!
She smiled when I said "You my bitch, ho!"

[Chorus]
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Which one are you?

[Verse 2]
Since when it's been cool giving bitches money?
You think it's cool giving hoes money?
You hella weak for these women though
My nigga Pimp C told me "Keep pimpin', $hort"
I'm in her purse, that's a metaphor
She's never broke, she's a better whore
Asking questions, you tell her more
Buying all that shit that you can't afford
Don't buy that shit, just be like $hort
And tell that bitch she can hit the door
Get the fuck up outta here
When you see her later on, tell her 'bout a player
Break a bitch, pimp a ho
Rubber bands, not envelopes
You had the bitch, you was in the door
She said you too friendly though
You lost your work to  a slick talker
Used to be a mack, you a trick stalker
Bitch just wanna get pimped on
How the fuck you end up in the friend zone?
When I see the bitch, I get cashed out
When I come through, get your ass out
I put my dick in her mouth like a 6-4
She smiled when I said "You my bitch, ho!"
You my bitch, ho!
She smiled when I said "You my bitch, ho!"

[Chorus]
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Are you a pimp or a trick, nigga?
Which one are you?
