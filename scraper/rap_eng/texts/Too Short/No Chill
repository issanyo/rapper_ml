[Hook: Pleasure P]
No chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill

[Verse 1: Pleasure P]
I got a pocket full of paper
And girl, I wanna see you later
Maybe take you on a date night
I wanna show you to the good life
You just wanna pop that pussy
So I'ma let you pop that pussy
You talk a whole lot of shit
But how you like to suck it with a whole lot of spit?
You be turned up all night
And goddamn it, I love your ratchet way
You a freak in the night
But when the sun come up, you get classy, babe

[Hook: Pleasure P]
No chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill

[Verse 2: Spectacular]
She sexy, but a certified hoodrat
Take her to the hills where I count the mills at
Put the pressure on her, make her feel that
Hit it from the back, put it where her ribs at
No chill, left the kids with her mama
Baby daddy ain't around 'cause he couldn't take the drama
She like her ass up with her face down
Since I left the city, you've been acting strange now
I'm on a plane, eating bread overseas
What you make in one year, I can get it in a week
She a freak, even try to take money out my sleep
Had to get the homegirl to snatch her ass by the weave
Come on

[Hook: Pleasure P]
No chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Chill out, bitch
Stop touching shit, stop running your lips
Unless my dick is between it, shut your mouth
She said, "Hell naw, nigga", and jumped on my couch
And started dancing real freaky, fuck it
Go 'head, suck it, when I cum, no ducking
Bitch, I'm on one now
Act wild when you come to my house 'cause I don't give a fuck
I'll treat you like a lady or a slut
Either way, you gon' be tasting my nut
It's Too $hort from the Bay, you know what's up
Give it all to me, but it ain't enough
Bitch

[Hook: Pleasure P]
No chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill, no chill, no chill
These bitches, these bitches ain't got no chill
No chill
