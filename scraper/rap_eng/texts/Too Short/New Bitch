[Intro: Too $hort + Female]
Wake yo’ muthafuckin’ ass up, let’s have a discussion right the fuck now
Why you tryna question me, bitch?
Don’t ask me why I’m questioning you, nigga
I’m still sleep, shut the fuck up
Nah nah, nigga, I’ve been waiting for 5 hours, 15 minutes, 23 seconds and

Counting
What, bitch?
Get yo’ ass up

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning on some new shit
I rolled over like, “I need a new bitch”
I sent a mass text out like “I’m cool”
I done with you hoes, I swear I’m through
So don’t text me, and don’t call me
Don’t hit me with a pocket dial saying “My fault”
Erase my number, and my e-mail
And that’s all you need to know, no details
And don’t be on Instagram in my DM’s
Talkin’ ‘bout how you pregnant, you my BM
I used a Magnum every time, bitch, stop that
Lying like that’ll get you popped at
And when you see me in the club, don’t act like we still fuckin’
Just hit me with that “What’s up?” or don’t say nothin’
Why I’m leaving? You really wanna know what the truth is?
I’m tired of you, girl, I need a new bitch

[Interlude]
I need a new bitch
Lose my number
I need a new bitch

[Verse 2]
Why you blowin’ me up like a mad bitch?
See my number in her phone under “Daddy Dick”
Don’t be mad at me ‘cause I had to, bitch
OG player, I used to drive a Cadillac
But I spent $160,000 on this sports car
Got her in the front seat, she called me Short Dog
I said, “Call me by my real name, Big Dick Dad”
Now there’s bitch ass niggas in her phone getting mad
Don’t ask me, ask her
Can’t afford therapy, go see your pastor
Don’t call or text me, now or next week
She’s always with me, and it’s always sexy
Three decades of game, still pimpin’ hoes
You need to let that shit go—what you trippin’ fo’?
Ain’t no pearl like new pearl
I said bring yo’ ass here—what it do, girl?
She’s so exotic, and exclusive
I just might make her my new bitch

[Outro]
I need a new bitch
Lose my number
I need a new bitch
You better lose my number
I need a new bitch
I need a new one, a new bitch—BITCH!
