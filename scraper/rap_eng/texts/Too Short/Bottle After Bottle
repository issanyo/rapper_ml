[Chorus: Trevell & Winn-Wade]
Bottle after bottle
Bottle after bottle, yeah
My body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
But ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Neck full of lipstick, shirt full of makeup
Ay, my body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
(Ay, your body lookin’ thicker)
My body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
(Ay, your body lookin’ thicker)
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Neck full of lipstick, shirt full of makeup

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Damn, I had to stop and think
Last night, I must’ve had a lot to drink
I was wild as hell, loud and yellin'
When I woke up, you know how I was feelin'
But fuck that, what’s all thinking for
Let’s get some new hoes, let’s drink some more
Reservations, upscale shit
Two more shots, I’m ‘bout to fuck this bitch
If you ain’t wit’ it, say that then
‘Cause last night I was fuckin’ two Canadians
From Vancouver—girl, what’s up with you?
I’m tryna fuck one if I can’t fuck two
That’s what I do, I turn ‘em inside out
I said, “How you want me?”, she said, “In my mouth”
I get ‘em fucked up, all night
Taste this, it’s alright, bitch

[Chorus: Trevell & Winn-Wade]
Bottle after bottle
Bottle after bottle, yeah
My body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
But ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Neck full of lipstick, shirt full of makeup
Ay, my body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
(Ay, your body lookin’ thicker)
My body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
(Ay, your body lookin’ thicker)
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Neck full of lipstick, shirt full of makeup

[Verse 2: E-40]
Uh, many macks (Many macks)
All my potnas in this with straps (Straps)
Hood rich niggas got scratch (Got scratch)
Everybody with me don’t rap (They don’t rap, mayne)
What a night (What a night)
My homie almost got into a fight (To a fight)
Thundercat like to take flight (Take flight)
One-hitter-quitters like Mike
I was on (I was on)
Drunk a fifth of Heem to the dome (To the liq)
Blowin’ on some green in my zone (My set)
Niggas better leave me alone
(Them niggas better leave me alone, man)
She a star (She a star)
Body lookin’ hella up to par (Up to par)
Pulled a couple bottles from the bar (From the bar)
Now she wanna ride in my car (BIATCH…skee-skrt)

[Chorus: Trevell & Winn-Wade]
Bottle after bottle
Bottle after bottle, yeah
My body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
But ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Neck full of lipstick, shirt full of makeup
Ay, my body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
(Ay, your body lookin’ thicker)
My body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
(Ay, your body lookin’ thicker)
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Neck full of lipstick, shirt full of makeup

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
Look, I’m Jay-Hova in a Range Rover (Hova!)
I told Bey bring her bae over (Bring your girl over)
Mollywhop and ran a train on her
(Neck full of lipstick, filming like BangBus)
I’m a fuckin’ player, no Gators, but I’m a vet
Bottle after bottle, my table, we keep it lit
Standing on the couch as my niggas throw up the set
Got ice on our fingers and neck, reppin’ the West, yeah
We get wet on that Earl Stevens, mother pearl gleamin’
Pour four up in the Sprite, got your girl leanin’
She don’t wanna be saved but you payin’ hoes
Every day I wake up gotta break a ho
Gotta break a ho, every day, I break a ho
Gotta her making dough in Las Vegas like a Raider though
‘Zilla, then wake up at the Palms Suites
With a dimepiece, sippin’ Dom P
More bottles, please

[Chorus: Trevell & Winn-Wade]
Bottle after bottle
Bottle after bottle, yeah
My body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
But ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Neck full of lipstick, shirt full of makeup
Ay, my body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
(Ay, your body lookin’ thicker)
My body full of liquor, and your body lookin’ thicker
(Ay, your body lookin’ thicker)
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Ain’t no tellin’ when I’ll wake up
Neck full of lipstick, shirt full of makeup
