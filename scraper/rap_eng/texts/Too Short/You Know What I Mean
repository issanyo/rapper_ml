MACK ATTACK It's a mack attack coming from wayback My name is Too $hort
Baby I don't play that jack I'm from the Dangerous Crew and I tell ya it's true
Everything they said about the playboy Too I'm $hort Dog, ain't nothing nice I
Drink G-Juice, wouldn't cut it with ice From the eastside, baby, Oakland town
Can't understand why I'm so down I'm not a white wall, I'm a Vogue Like seen
On white wheel I roll Got a fresh new beat, made ya get freaky It was
Everything ya wanted cause I can't be weak Yeah, baby, that's it, do the split
Freak nasty all on my tip I took it to my DJ, fresh on wax Put it on the
Turntable, I got taxed It started burning up, why it's smoking? Had to be the
Sound coming straight from Oakland $hort Dog, it's a mack attack My name is Too
$Hort baby I don't play that jack One young tender lost all hope I slapped her
In the face with my dunkie rolls Another young sucka tried to front my style
Sawed off his face when they broke him in half It was the Dangerous Crew and I
Tell ya it's true

Everything they said about the playboy Too When I sing my rhymes I'm never
Fake When ya start my beat that's when I break On you and it don't stop
And it don't stop and it won't stop Cause I'm Too $hort baby on the microphone

Nothing plain Dangerous Music on the microphone Makes ya wanna break ya hip
Bone Might break ya leg or amybe ya back Grooving too hard on my mack attack
It's really not easy, ya know it's hard Sorta just like my gangsta car Ya know
What I mean, Vern? It's like funny I mack legit and make all the money See my
Capital T on my diamond ring He hooked up the beat and loves to swing So while
Ya out there grooving back and forth I wants ya to scream out Sir Too $hort

Don't stop that rap! (Don't stop that rap!) And it's just like that, get busy
Girls, while I rap I make big money, that ain't no crap When I grab that mic
And spit my rhyme I gotta have an 8 or 909 (beat!) So I can rock ya all night
Long (She's!) on my tip, she loves my song (He!) tried to do it but did it
Wrong (Freaks!) wanna get me all alone but I'm macking Hit it! I finally got
The chance to grab my pen And make another rhyme so I can make more ends It's a
Rushed production, not the beat I rushed out the studio and hit the streets Now
I'm rocking one more time Young girls love my Too $hort rhyme But that big fat
Girl better let that go Before I point right at her and say hoe! I'm driving a
Drop top Caddy, I don't dig fake I step on the gas, then I hit the break Do it
Again as I catch the beat Ya feeling that bass all down the street Jumped off
