If you're feeling sad and lonely
There’s a service I can render
Tell the one who loves you only
I can be so warm and tender
Call me don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I’ll be around
When it seems your friends desert you
There's somebody thinking of you
I'm the one who'll never hurt you
Maybe that's because I love you
Call me don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around
Now, don’t forget me’ cause if you let me
I will always stay by you
You gotta trust me that's how it must be
There’s so much that I can do
If you call, I'll be right with you
You and I should be together
Take this love I long to give you
I'll be at your side forever
Call me don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it’s late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around
Call me don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around
Now, don't forget me 'cause if you let me
I will always stay by you
You gotta trust me that's how it must be
There's so much that I can do
If you call, I'll be right with you
