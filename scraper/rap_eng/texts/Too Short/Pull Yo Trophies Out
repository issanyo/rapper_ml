[Chorus: Too $hort & Philthy Rich]
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
2018 drop-top Porsche, brand new with the sticker on it
Old school Cadillac, mayne, 'cause you know I gotta keep it pimpin', homie
6-5 Mustang, hell yeah, I went and got that Shelby
And when I'm in that muthafucka, ain't shit you can tell me
Big wheels on an SUV, blow the whistle, I'm the referee
A lot of women you'll never see, it's pimpin' pimpin' 'til the death of me
30's all on my dunk, woofers all in my trunk
Speakers all on the outside, let the whole world hear this bump
Looking down at you chumps, that little shit don't run
I got a LS3 in this '73, I'm the cleanest nigga where I'm from
Watch a nigga (Stunt), watch a nigga (Stunt)

[Chorus: Too $hort & Philthy Rich]
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Hit the corner, everybody watchin' this muthafucka, it's wet
You see this paint? Don't touch it, nigga, I'll finger fuck your bitch
She looked inside when the door opened, seen everything she wants
Start it up then I burn rubber with your favorite girl in the front
I'm up in the Hills of Beverly, a sucka nigga I'll never be
She jumped in here, went to my house, and now this bitch won't ever leave
Blowin' all that blow, kneelin' down on the floor
Put some on the tip of my dick then stuck it down her throat
She don't give a fuck if I'm rich, she don't care if I'm a star
She don't really wanna fuck with me, she wanna fuck my car
Stuntin'

[Chorus: Too $hort & Philthy Rich]
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
(It's Philthy nigga)
I say now i8 with the doors up and the shoes blue (Uh)
In the kitchen with the wrist moves, tryna turn a 36 to 72 (Skrt)
Told the bitch she better go hard for this Goyard
Them broke niggas, I don't know y'all (Broke nigga)
Got masts and no Coast Guard (What's that?)
Only wore it once, that's the cold part (It's Philthy!)
Elevation cause separation
Mismatched diamonds, no segregation (Nah-uh)
Seminary niggas paper chasin'
Interrogation room, he made several statements (Pussy)
Big face on the new Rollie (Big face)
41, I don't do the 40
Hundred thou' what they wanted for it
That broke nigga know he can't afford it (Broke nigga)
Submariner with the blue face, this 18-karat white gold (Yeah)
I remember when I was 18, checked $20,000 out a white ho (Oh, I remember)
Yeah, I come from the hood but I live in the 'burbs with the white folks (Seminary)
All four foreigns all white though
Probably pull up with four white hoes (Foreign, foreign, foreign)
It's Philthy

[Chorus: Too $hort & Philthy Rich]
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
Pull yo' trophies out, pull yo', pull yo' trophies out
