[Hook 2X: Jazze Pha]
We, roll dubs
Ball, in clubs
Dimes, no scrubs
If you're lookin for a baller, baller

[Break: Jazze Phe]
From the yay, from the yay
Poppin my collar
If you're lookin for a baller, baller
From the yay, from the yay
Poppin my collar
If you're lookin for a baller, baller

[Too $hort]
Whassup baby?  Still dreaming?
For a rich man, you still fiending?
Well I hope you got skills if you know what I mean
Everything from oral sex, to cooking and cleaning
Rich niggas want it all, just like you
And when I ball don't ask me what I do
You want to be kept, keep your mouth shut
But you'se a gold digger and you go out too much
If I choose you, it'll be the wrong choice
I'm saying, "fuck you", loud, with a strong voice
One rainy day and you're ass is out
No money to spend, you start passing out
So dramatic, even though it ain't your cash
Bitches like you I wanna thank your ass
For being shallow, I know you a bad ho
I wouldn't let your punk-ass stand next to my shadow

[Hook]

[Too $hort]
I like a Cinderella story, but most of the time
These nothing-ass gold digging hoes are fine
A nigga fronting, you wanna have sex with a star?
He drive a Benz, but it's the next nigga car
The only thing he own is that outfit
But he still stuck his dick in your mouth, bitch
And after all that getting fucked on the floor
He called a taxi to take you home in the morning
Dumb bitch, you just got fucked by a flunkie
See you at the club and you acting like you want ME
Don't make me laugh
We get married, and you take half
I don't think so, see you at the bank, ho
You want to walk down the aisle but I can't go
I got her number, but I never call her
You better look around and find another baller, beotch!

[Hook]

[Too $hort]
I don't want your key, you ain't getting mine
Ask to use my car, you committing a crime
Leave your panties or your bra, I throw them away
Can't find the door?  I show you the way
Hope you come back, but you just can't stay
We can get together on another day
I come get you, when I miss you
Cause if I see you every day I'd probably dis you
What you gonna do when you get you a baller?
Rich man, what she gotta do to get you to call her?
Better talk about, might like what you hear
Say it right in her ear, every night of the year
You can be together, beotch!
You better get a job if you wanna be rich
Go to school or something, get a degree
I know you wanna baller but it can't be me

[Break]
