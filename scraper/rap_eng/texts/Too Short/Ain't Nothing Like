[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Ain't nothing like, ain't nothing like
Ain't nothing like that new pussy
Ain't nothing like, ain't nothing like
Ain't nothing like hot new pussy
Ain't nothing like that new pussy
Every other night I'm in a new city
Ain't nothing like that new pussy
Many hoes don't know what to do with me

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
That's my old thot, I ran into her
Wearing loafers with the no socks, back around the grow spot
I asked her is her number the same
Cause your friend Kim heard me say she wanted to hang
Ain't shit that you can stay that's gonna stop my reign
Took a trip to Madagascar to cop my chain
All the bitches call me papi but that's not my name
Say the pussy pretty good but it's not that flame
I'm eating grilled swordfish with my Florida bitch
Caught it with my own hands so she know I'm the shit
I throw some dollars in her purse when she low on the rent
But I've gotta leave her home when I go on a trip because

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Too $hort, last night I had two of em
Fake players don't know what to do with em
You probably fall in love
Players like me, we just do what it does
Every day I'm like "damn, that's it"
I love her, then I can't stand that bitch
Is it the life of a rap star?
Way back when I was broke and didn't have a car
I still burnt rubber on that pretty ass
I caught her acting fast and I smashed
Next thing you know, we making fuck faces
I hit it real good, then I upgraded, bitch

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]

[Verse 3: Chuck Inglish]
On the low that's the truth like a motherfu-
And her, and her girlfriend bad as a motherfu-
On the phone, running zones with my lil cousin
Pull up in a 'Stang like Kane, who you looking for?
Had a couple of em with her, had to scoop a buck
Blunt's too hot, I'm like "take it off"
2x2x4, I could do it all
Sixteen of em and they're bad, gotta make a call
Cop cars, I am not the law
And I'm 'bout to touch down and get the extra point
Now I'm 'bout to take off and make another hunnid
Hit the strip club with the team for a couple of em
