I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours

Get it calculated, do the math
I made 1,000 songs that made you move your a***
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump

Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say b*** like me
2 singers and 10 comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in

What's my favorite word? B***
Why they gotta say it like $hort? B***
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs, stay on the porch

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Where you get that from?
Grab the mic, spit one, let me hit that b***
Pimp-C, 8-Ball and MJG
Keep spittin' that P to the I M P

Bun-B, that's Texas, baby
Ball and G, that's Memphis, baby
$hort Dog, that's Oakland, baby
Ain't nothin' but pimpin' these days, G

My n*** C got locked up
But these real h*** still know they gots to f***
Give a f***, what you say
$hort Dog f*** with UGK

Do you really wanna be like me?
Spit game like Snoop and TIP
Pretty girls in the V.I.P
They came with Dre, they don't need I.D

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Your mind is gone, your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last 3 days
Poppin' p***, it goes down for real
Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill

Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs

Like me, my s*** gets around
Leave the country come back and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York and ATL
Houston and L.A., ask Dave Chappelle

About my rich b***, he got her from me
And made 50 million dollars, I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy, you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy
Blow it

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
B***

Too $hort
Up all night, baby
Album number 16
Y'all can't f*** wit that
