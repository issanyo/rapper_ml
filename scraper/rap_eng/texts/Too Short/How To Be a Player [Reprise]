Look, ayy, look, ayy
Pussy is pussy, nigga, but pimpin' is pimpin'

Niggas try so hard to fuck 'em, but not me, I befriend 'em
You buy 'em shit, I make 'em laugh and I quickly be in 'em
She shoot me a text every day, I might hit back in a week
Told you she never sucked a dick, well why she do it for me? (Haha)
I charge a bitch for the game, the mind fuckin' is free (Is free)
Little mama crazy in love and this bitch is badder than B
Two at a time if I want, tonight it's me plus three
No time for layin' and stayin', they know I'm playin' for jeeks (Yeah)
See, I'm a playa by nature, a hustler by trade
Got bitches hatin' this game, but love the way that I play it
