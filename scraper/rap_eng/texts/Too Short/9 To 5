[Too $hort:]

Been hustlin' my whole life
But I always wondered...
If you ain't gotta car...
Can you still car pool or do you gotta catch the bus?

I talk shit like a real pro
Man on the casino
Tell me that I'm fresh ho
I drive by like a drive by
Freak hit me with a text got mad I didn't reply
I dip fast down the skyline
And you can say I swim fast if you knew a zodiac sign
I wear suits and boots and gold cufflinks
You ain't feelin' me? Then tell me what your girl think
I put a vision that will spit on H.D
Then I give a receipt man for the pay fee
Now it's way past two
I say "Whatcha gonna do? Are you goin' with her?"
She said "I'm comin' wit you"
And yeah you can check my purse
But at seven I gotta go to work

Ya think it's funny Imma warn ya

When the cops drive by they get every fly guy with a female all up in the ride

Give me all your big loot

Fifty five, fifty five

And now click your heels like Dorothy
And duck down freak from the authority
You make more money than the majority
I'm lookin' at my calendar you're goin' on tour with me
I think you could straight absorb me
And she didn't hesitate to open up the door for me

Bitch you got a 9 to 5 and you don't even drive
Talkin' down a playboy that be kickin' it live

Wake up early get your ass in that bus line
Bitch you got a 9 to 5
And these are playboy times

I'm on a legendary crime spree
And I stick to all the rules of the game that designed me
You can hit the clubs and be a broke bitch
Man all that work bitch eatin on tuna fish
I flash cash when I ride like a bike gang
I throw a turnout all on a flight mane
This freak is straight outta sight mane
Make money to the early light mane
I go shopping like a budget don't apply to me
And when I spend I'm like a Menace II Society
I like that style, what's the variety?
Check in the back, baby please don't lie to me
Gimme all the colors you can brang out
Cuz Imma be where all the girls hang out
Diamond chains on the playboys bang out
You might like to be where we make it rain out

Bitch you got a 9 to 5 and you don't even drive
Talkin' down a playboy that be kickin' it live
Bitch you got a 9 to 5
Ya you fine but your ass always need a ride
Bitch you got a 9 to 5
Wake up early get your ass in that bus line
Bitch you got a 9 to 5
And these are playboy times
