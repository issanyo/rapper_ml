George Clinton:
(chorus)
And it's a cold cold cold cold day
For a player
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
I want to hold yah
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
I want to hold yah
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
I want to hold yah
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit

Too $hort:
I got too many girlfriends what am I gonna do?
Play em tell the world ends and always keep a few
When it comes to women I did everything I thought of
Players like me, we never get caught
Who's the next on the list? It's a daily routine dog
She give me short, then she'd take my jeans off at
First she wasn't messing with me told me to lick it
But now she's always sweating me. When we gonna kick it?
Spend some time wit her, I need to come through and hit it
Any time I feel like I want it, I can get it
I'll be here for you, you never wonder were I'm at
So when I come through put the spare key under the mat
When I come in, there ain't no holding back
Just feel what I am doing and roll with that
And even though I admit I can't commit this time
It's cause I got my heart broke at the age of nine
I've been hard core every since I sucked up the game from pimps
You never hear me rap about the same bitch
I never turned a ho into a housewife
Short dog East Oakland in the house right

Chorus 2:
I'm ready to ride, ready to ride, ready to ride
I'm the mothership wish it comes
I'm ready to ride, ready to ride, ready to ride
I'm the mothership wish it comes

Chorus 1:
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
I want to hold yah
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
Ay yeeeay  I want to hold yah
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
I want to hold yah
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
I want to hold yah
Dit dit dit dit do do dit dit dit
Ayyy yeeay

Too $hort:
I thought we was cool like that, why you go behind my back?
Trying to cross me in the game when you know I'm a mack
Can't do that, you all up in my mix
Get the phone book callin all my bitches
You know I don't really care if you interfere
Cause I don't think you know about these real players
If you need a lesson, you better listen up
Cause I don't think you ready for this pimpin stuff
I'm Too Short baby on the microphone
Since you  got no game, I gotta write these songs
To wake you up and get you motivated
I'm about to flip the script and I know your gonna hate it
You can't infatuate my game no more, it's fool proof
So when you try to cross me up, I pull through
Like a solider, cause we fighting a war
Haters against Players, who you fighting for?
You all in my business trying to make it theirs
I need to hit you in your face tell you 'mind your own affairs'
I'm Sir Too Short, and I'm knowing just how to be a player bitch

Chorus 2:

Chorus 1:

Too $hort:
BIOTCH [echoes]
Now if your trying to be a player, do your thing
But if you wanna be in love, it's cool mang
Don't try to be a player when you see that you can't
Let your peers pressuring you into being what you ain't
It's hard to be real in this fake world
Would you  result to violence if I take your girl?
Or would you realize she likes me more then you
Our relationship is starting and yours is through
Are you riding on the bench. Who you starting for?
Do you have another girl or is your heart broke?
Do you know how to be a player?
Is what they say about me
I'm straight down with the after party, late night freaks

Belita Woods:
She's just a pretty face, and she doesn't even use her own name
She stole it from a magazine
She's just a pretty face
And the words she say ain't coming from her mouth
She stole the can and loves the pot
She's just another pretty face

George Clinton:
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohhhh
Five o'clock I make a run
