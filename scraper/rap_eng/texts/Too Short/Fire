[Erick Sermon]
Where my money at ho..
Where my money at yo..
Get my money 'fore I whip..
Forget your big fat ass
We going off baby
We don't mess around cuz I'm nautious baby
You know I loaded it with the gun, pop pop..
Aiyyo, LET'S GO!!!

Here we go y'all
New shit new shit, out the door y'all
Shorty Pimp, E-Dub once again
So buy you some of this ghetto slum
Underground music from A-T-L
X rearranged it, Shorty B played it
Me and Short laid it, my niggas OK'd it
Carnefious Crawfish, next to slay it
Damn right! We do it all day bitch
Ride around in Benz's, twenty inch rimzes
What Short told y'all, New York to California
We put them high beams on ya - parking lot pimping
With the boom-boom twelve inches kicking, we stay hitting
Huh? The most consecutive
Fifteen albums, we're the executives
Who talking money?

[Hook - E. Sermon]
Let's do it baby
Me and Short Dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shooting all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, E and Short be on fire!
Everything we do is fire!
This song is on fire! YO!

[Too $hort]
Bitch! That's my favorite word
I cashed a million dollar check on Thursday the third
Now it's flowing like water out the kitchen sink
I make more money every time you blink
Got you scratching ya head, made you stop and think
He couldn't made all that he must have robbed a Brinks
We been around so long, making funky songs
Now you getting mad, say this can't be going on
How come E and Short get to stay in the game?
Don't ever talk down on a player's name
So when you see us on top of every chart
You know we been number one since the very start
We feed families when we rhyme, celebrate like champions
You see mine - I never worry
I don't want the stress, you know my story
I learned how to ball from the best

[Hook - E. Sermon]
Let's do it baby
Me and Short Dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shooting all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, East coast be on fire!
West coast be on fire!
Down south be on fire! YO!
(Detroit, Chi-town!)

[Erick Sermon]
Don't stop the song now It's not over
I must leave the scene wrecked, before closure
Highest doja, L.A. weed
Monopolize the south like L.A. Reed (BITCH!)
Sick individual, this here be the Southwest coast
East coast material
Erick Sermon, that's what I said man
Fuck with Short and I and be a dead man

[Too $hort]
This is fire, pass it to me
It's so hot, E lemme hit that weed
Uptown, hydro is in my genes
It's like green, I just might be a fiend
'Cause I been trying to O.D. lately
And you're never gonna rehabilitate me
On a mission since the eighth grade
Keep getting high and stay paid

[Hook - E. Sermon]
Let's do it baby
Me and Short Dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shooting all haters on sight baby
THAT'S RIGHT!!
Make room, tonight is on fire!
The roof is on fire!
These hoes be on fire!
Yo, Crawfish!

[Carnefious Crawfish]
It's the lawless, flawless
Carnefious Crawfish
Number one draft pick
Master this rap shit
Getting to this cabbage
Like rabbits
And stack these Carats
You don't want no static
From the wood to the glen
From a hood to a 'Benz
You don't want me vexed at you
Better keep me your friend
I'm ?
New comer with four stars
E-Double and Short Dog
Running for Short Dog
Never ? more, dog
Nigga staring at me, vexed and shit
Like you want some more, dog
Give me the smack nigga watch me eat the ?
Nah, fuck that shit, I'm going to defeat the ?
Pistol gripping
Keep on stripping
Never simping
'Stead of sipping
Never tipping
Slamming these hoes like Scott Pippen
My game is unreal
Hoes be popping pills
Game over mother fucker, It's a done deal
