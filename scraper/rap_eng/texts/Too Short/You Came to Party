[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Let's get wild tonight
Turn the fuck up, we goin' out tonight
I been waiting all my life
Everytime I go out I think I found my wife
I can't help but turn down the lights
I'm gon' take some down tonight
This shit is so hot, that's what it sounded like
Make you wanna fuck around at night
Bitch

[Pre-Chorus: ??? of Meter Mobb]
I want you in every way
The passion burns and it goes both ways
When we're not together, I'm in pain
The mightiest ocean couldn't put out this flame

[Chorus: ??? of Meter Mobb]
I think she comin' with me
You wanna say bye but she leaves
Tears drop like autumn leaves
You better make time to breathe

[Post-Chorus: ??? of Meter Mobb]
I know that you came to party baby, baby, baby, baby
Look like we gon' leave this party with somebody else's lady
I know that you came to party baby, baby, baby, baby
Look like we gon' leave this party with somebody else's lady

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Let me buy you a drink
Baby, can I get a dance?
I don't even know what to think
Will I ever get a chance?
I see you standing by yourself
It's still early, it's only 'bout twelve
You have any fun lately?
Fuck, wake up, and say "good morning," baby
You want that real love
You daydreaming, is it real enough?
Imagine this dick in you
A lot of fucking, is what we get to do
If you give me that sloppy dome
Wherever I'm at, you know I'm coming home
I can't leave it alone
Bust another nut, then I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus: ??? of Meter Mobb]
He wants you in every way
The passion burns but it goes one way
When we're together, it drives him insane
It might've worked out if he wasn't so lame

[Chorus: ??? of Meter Mobb]
I think she comin' with me
You wanna say bye but she leaves
Tears drop like autumn leaves
You better make time to breathe

[Post-Chorus: ??? of Meter Mobb]
I know that you came to party baby, baby, baby, baby
Look like we gon' leave this party with somebody else's lady
I know that you came to party baby, baby, baby, baby
Look like we gon' leave this party with somebody else's lady

[Bridge: ??? of Meter Mobb]
And I'm trying, said I try
To ignore the truth inside
Hide that you're mine
Yeah, you're mine
We gon' [?] till the sun comes up baby

[Post-Chorus: ??? of Meter Mobb]
I know that you came to party baby, baby, baby, baby
Look like we gon' leave this party with somebody else's lady
I know that you came to party baby, baby, baby, baby
Look like we gon' leave this party with somebody else's lady
I know that you came to party baby, baby, baby, baby
Look like we gon' leave this party with somebody else's lady
I know that you came to party baby, baby, baby, baby
Look like we gon' leave this party with somebody else's lady
