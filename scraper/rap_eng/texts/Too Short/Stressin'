[Intro: E-40 + (Too $hort)]
It’s a reason why we blow reefer
Smoke big cheeba
(It’s grass from the earth)
It’s a stress reliever (Stress)
Sometimes, breh… (What’s up?)
I gotta smoke to get stress up off my mind
(Me too, nigga)
Talk to ‘em, $hort (Fa sho)
Tell ‘em how you feel, breh
For real

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
It feels like a wasted day, if I don’t learn nuthin’
That’s why every day, I gotta burn somethin’
I keep my mind right, all night long
I’m smoking early in the morning while I’m writing songs
(Smoking to get that stress off mind mind)
Stressin’…what’s up, Earl? (UH!)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Coming out the door from the gate
Why these punk niggas wanna hate?
‘Cause a nigga too real, not fake
No handcuffs, no capes
Bitchmade female traits, in the wind
Picking my folks up from the pen
Up under share, he did ten
Refused to tell, made man
Alligator skin, crocodile
Hard as nails, not fragile
Possession to sale, push pow-wow
Rep Vallejo OG style
(I be drinking, smoking all the time)
Tell it like it is, SIG Sauer SIG, tuck it
Living in the Bay with the crabs in the bucket
(I don’t know why you smoke just like we do)
Roll the kush, Blue Dream
Sippin’ on this Heem
Me and my whole team
Eating like we kings
Posted with the thump, dumpin’ (dumpin’)
BLAOW-BLAOW-BLAOW, drummin’ (drummin’)
BLOOM-BLOOM-BLOOM, gunnin’ (gunnin’)
BOOM-BOOM-BOOM, runnin’ (runnin’)
Haul ass when I blast
(Smoking to get that stress off my mind)
On my way to the sto’, sold a bag of the blow
Triple-doubled my dough, took a hit of the dro
And I was good to go (BIATCH!)

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
What’s up with Earl and Todd? You seen them niggas yet?
We smoke a lot but we don’t ever smoke cigarettes
We just smoke the best, if you ain’t noticed it
We up north, down south, West Coast, BITCH!

[Verse 4: E-40]
I’m from the V, Black, white, Asians
Speaking of Asians, my eyes tight like Asians
Blazin’, smoking on Cajun, kush
Chop some weed in a bush
(Smoking to get that stress of my mind)
Lit, ready to empty that clip
Right to head what I hit (BLAOW)
(I don’t know why they try to play me false)
I’m a fuckin’ boss (boss), I’ll cut your head off
All I gotta do is cough
Fly your head like golf (BIATCH!)

[Verse 5: Too $hort]
Ask me what we smokin’, it smells so potent
That West Coast weed, California by the ocean
(Smoking to get that stress off my mind)
It’s always open
I got it from the weed store in Downtown Oakland
At the Purple Heart Patient Center
Niggas stand in line and can’t wait to enter
I’m trying to get high, can’t be late for dinner
So I’m stressin’, when I smoke, you call me Satan sinner
I’m just asking
What’s wrong with plants? (Nothin’)
You need to stop
‘Cause if it grows from earth, it was made by God (That’s real)
(Smoking to get that stress off my mind)
Smoking

[Verse 6: E-40]
Posted on Cloud 20 (20), all grass, no grimmy
Purple Haze like Jimi (Jimi)
Hella blazed, 420
Finger on my mini (mini)
Fat blunts, not skinny (skinny)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, like Lenny
Williams, blowin’ on a Tower of Power
Diesel sour, not powder
Up, up, and I’m outter
Got connect like a router
Been high for like eight hours
(Smoking to get that stress of my mind)
On my way to the sto’, sold a bag of the blow
Triple-doubled my dough, took a hit of the dro
And I was good to go (BIATCH!)
(I don’t know why you smoke just like we do)

[Outro: Too $hort]
What is this shit you smoking?
Whatever you smoking, I need some of that, mayne
