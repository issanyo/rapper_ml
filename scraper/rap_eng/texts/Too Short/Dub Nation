[Chorus]
Game over (Game over)
Raise ‘em up (Get up outta here)
Who’s the champ? (We are)
They say it’s us (DubNation)
Who got the trophy? (DubNation)
And all the women? (BITCH!)
Next season we’ll still be winnin’
We’ll still be pimpin’, we still gon’ kill ‘em

[Verse 1]
Whooped yo’ ass, it was so much fun
Made it back to The Finals, and we won
You love LeBron? You wanna get you some?
I say ‘Fuck the Cavs’ ‘cause we number one
DubNation, we don’t stop
Check the stats, bitch, we on top
If you don’t win, what’s the worst case?
Fuck yo’ team, we in first place
You wanna play the Dubs? You can’t win
Gotta work hard if you wanna beat the champ
Yeah, we got K.D., we don’t play fair
Don’t cry little bitch, we real players
If we don’t win, we never hate
And if we do, we gon’ celebrate
With another parade, ain’t no sad face
Fuck yo’ team if you in last place
We the winners

[Chorus]
Game over (Game over)
Raise ‘em up (Get up outta here)
Who’s the champ? (We are)
They say it’s us (DubNation)
Who got the trophy? (DubNation)
And all the women? (BITCH!)
Next season we’ll still be winnin’
We’ll still be pimpin’, we still gon’ kill ‘em

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we got Steph and Klay
Come to Oakland, every team we play
The whole NBA, we can beat it
We damn near undefeated
2017 champs
Draymond Green, Kevin Durant
And that bench—they don’t know how to quit
If we at home or we on a road trip
Just don’t beat yourself
The wrong attitude is you don’t need no help
But don’t lie, ‘cause you know you do
It’s fourth quarter, muthafucka, you through
Now what the fuck you gon’ do?
Dubs up 22
Three-pointers and alley-oops
And gon’ show these muthafuckas how Cali do it
BITCH!

[Chorus]
Game over (Game over)
Raise ‘em up (Get up outta here)
Who’s the champ? (We are)
They say it’s us (DubNation)
Who got the trophy? (DubNation)
And all the women? (BITCH!)
Next season we’ll still be winnin’
We’ll still be pimpin’, we still gon’ kill ‘em

Game over (Game over)
DubNation
DubNation…
