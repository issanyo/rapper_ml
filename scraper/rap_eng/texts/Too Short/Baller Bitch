[Pretty Boy]
Yo Fox and $hort, yo
Don't let that pretty shit fool you, yo
I ain't pay that bitch phone bill

[Foxy]
This is for all my ballin' ass bitches
All over, worldwide
Shake them thighs for them hots
For all my niggas on every street corner
That's right, love y'all niggas

1 - 	[T$]	This is for the baller bitch, you all a bitch
My nigga's never call her bitch, we all be rich
[Fox]	So $hort, what you mean?
[T$]	I bet I be a poor girl's dream
More money than she ever seen

[Fox]	This is for the baller cats, all the cats
That want a bitch to lay on her back
The hell with that
[T$]	So Fox what you mean?
[Fox]	Bet I be a poor nigga's dream
More money than he ever seen

[Too-Short]
Yo, yo, kiss the projects goodbye
I'mma change you bitch
I'mma have niggas thinkin you a famous bitch
Here's the keys to the Benz, but don't start the car
If you good I'mma let you park the car
From a straight broke-ass to a baller-bitch
They got no other choice but to call you rich
I got hella fly ladies, never cry ladies
Those cheat-on-they-man type tell a lie ladies
Diamond rings, platinum chains
Tell 'em "Baller Bitch" when they ask your name
I say strut that strut, walk that walk
Pop that shit, talk that talk
Hold your head high, be proud of this life
Pray to God that you never fall out of this life
Cause it's much more better than all world scenes
Bitch, open up your eyes, it's a poor girl's dream

Repeat 1

[Foxy]
Kiss that jail shit goodbye, I'mma lace you, nigga
I'mma have bitches thinkin' you a famous nigga
Blaze the keys to the crib, have you lovin' this life
And bitches, ain't nothing fuckin' with a thug in your life
And them frontin' ass niggas who be caught in the hype
Like they OT and ain't sold a drug in they life
I got husslin' ass niggas, thuggin' ass niggas
Always on some shit, never trust them ass niggas
Bust your guns niggas cop your ones
And tell them "Big Baller" when you flash it once
Nigga lock the bar down
Show these cats how it's done
Then slide through the hood and go fuck with your duns

Repeat 1

[Foxy]
Call me what you want, I been heard the worst
And if it's Cris' in this bitch
Bet I'm poppin' it first
And if the 700's come, I'll be coppin' it first
So whenever you see some hot shit I'm rockin' it first

[Too-Short]
Shit, droppin' a verse
The pot in 'em choppin' it first
Basically when I ride-by, I'm hurtin' them worse
So now boo, what you gonna do?
You see how quick I got you
That's how quick I will drop you

Repeat 1
