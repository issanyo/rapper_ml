Trap in my neighborhood shot a lot o guns
Heavy magic one day is to a lot o ones
Never rapped about a weapon that I never had
Made th best of line even when I’m doing bad
I’m from a cool hood where my big homies never picked one me
They put me on plays, threw me on K’s
Threw me out bricks, put me on hits
We double back on em the line was left sick
One phone call and niggas will die shortly
I fuck with the mob you see a square for surely
We in private shit, my resume say a lot o shit
And I ain’t even got no plaque but made a lot o hits
We rip bitch niggas off for being counterfeit
Look in my eyes they be seeing all kinda shit
We move mean for the hood no subliminal
