[Chorus: Dumbfoundead]
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
I'm eating that panocha with tapatio
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
I'm eating that panocha with tapatio
Cochino, cochino

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
I met all her tios
They all have a PO
I said I'm Korean
Still call me a Chino
Wassup mami me llamo Dummy
Call your homegirl Maria for me
Let's have us a trio
Call us the Migos
The pussy got me speaking in tongues
Her tongues rolling R's like drums
The language make me learn
Your lengua make me cum
I stay out for pico
I'm from where you're from
You know I've been a freak though
Friends with beneficios

[Chorus: Dumfoundead]
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
I'm eating that panocha with tapatio
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
I'm eating that panocha with tapatio
Cochino, cochino

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
I got a Mexican bitch out in East Los
A Puerto Rican bitch on the East Coast
It's the Pimpin' Olympics
Nigga I'm a legend in Rio
Korean bitches and Europeans
The United Nations all in my DM
You're a cochina (You're a cochina)
You're nasty for real (Nasty)
You can call me Pachino (call me Pachino)
If that's how you feel (If that's how you feel)
Fuck with short dog
You know you want to ask about me to your cholo uncles
Bitch I'm an OG (OG)
I get money for fun (I get money)
I call up some Asian bitches and go dumber than Dumb
Bitch

[Chorus: Dumfoundead]
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
I'm eating that panocha with tapatio
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
I'm eating that panocha with tapatio
Cochino, cochino

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
Ain't trying to stunt, hit it once
Now she saying come over here, meet the familia
Now I'm at her little sisters quinceanera
Looking hella unfamiliar
"Who is that chino?"
"Heard he pack out arenas"
"Nah, he ain't shit
He ain't Selena"
I don't want drama, no novella
Let's go make babies, that's brown and yellow
I'll make you so wet you'll need umbrellas
You need an agent? 'cause you got talent
Giving you besos
All over your breasts
If you call me cochino
I take no offense

[Chorus: Dumfoundead]
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
I'm eating that panocha with tapatio
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
Cochino, cochino
I'm eating that panocha with tapatio
Cochino, cochino
