Why.. why she hoein man?
Why's she hoein, you ain't knowin?  Oh you know why
Why is she prostitutin her body.. BEITCH!

[Chorus: Too $hort]
Analyze the game and tell me why; cause pimpin won't die
All these tricks want pussy to buy; the pimpin won't die
You can analyze the game and tell me why; cause pimpin cain't die
All these tricks want pussy to buy - pimpin won't die bitch

[Too $hort]
Why she hoein, you ain't knowin..
.. about all them dicks she be blowin, bitch where you goin?
Bring yo' ass back, here right now
Cook my food, and clean my house
Put my dick, in yo' mouth
Hell naw bitch you ain't goin out
You better realize she's a ho by nature
Takes one to know one fo'sho' I'm a player
She ain't really happy 'less she lickin a dick
With a sucker-ass nigga that be trickin an' shit
You can't train the pussy, by lockin it up
Raw dickin the pussy, and knockin it up (nope)
She still gon' be a ho and a baby by you don't mean shit
What kind of player are you?  Let's get rich
Run the game with no glitch
Look her in the eye and say BEITCH!

[Chorus]
Analyze the game and tell me why; cause pimpin won't die
As long as these tricks want pussy to buy; the pimpin won't die
You can analyze the game and tell me why
Y'know the pimpin can't die BEITCH
As long as you believe I'll never lie - can't die..

[Too $hort]
Ain't no need, for you to front (nope)
Keep it real with these hoes, they give you what you want
Tell the bitch, you wanna fuck (yup)
If she say no.. so what?
Cause all you really wanna do is get this cash
Pull hundred dollar bills out a bitch's ass
Too many niggas with the wrong agenda
Can't love the bitch, turned around to pimp her
Make your wife your ho, and your ho your wife
You can't do this dumb shit your whole life
That ain't pimpin - you need to let that go
Run home to your wife and forget that ho

[Chorus]
Analyze the game and tell me why (tell me why).. it won't die
As long as these tricks want pussy to buy; this pimpin won't die
You can analyze the game and tell me why; the pimpin won't die
As long as you believe I'll never tell a lie - it cain't die..

[Too $hort]
Nigga you all straight lines and fo' corners
Squarer than a motherfucker, Oakland California
That's where I got my name, I never could change
Runnin through the streets of the O is to blame mayne
You always frontin - whassup wit you?
You either do what you told or tell people what to do
Are you a boss or a worker - you big pimpin
All by yourself and ain't got no women

[Chorus]
Analyze the game, please tell me why.. the pimpin won't die
As long as these tricks want pussy to buy.. pimpin cain't die
You can analyze the game and tell me why.. y'know the pimpin won't die
As long as you believe I'll never lie - pimps up hoes down beatch

Analyze the game and tell me why (tell me why) - it won't die
All these tricks want pussy to buy; the pimpin won't die
Analyze the game and tell me why (tell me why) - cain't die
All my bitches know I don't lie - this pimpin will never die

Beitch!
