Oakland (Oh-oh-oh-Oakland) Oaktown (Oh-oh-oh-Oaktown)
Oakland (Oakland, Oakland) Get on down (Oh-oh-Oaktown)

Straight from the West, Oakland is the best
Baby it's so fresh (Oakland)
It's called the Big Bad O, city of players on the go
You gotta have Trues and Vogues (Oakland)
Baby, that's my town, when all the tops come down
You'll hear my funky sound (Oh-oh-oh-Oaktown)
O-A-K-L-A-N-D, that city was made for me
Just rocking to the beat (Oakland)
Drop tops rolling down the strip, baby it's the tip
Don't stop dipping til I quit (Oaktown)
Trues and Vogues on my car, baby I'm a star
I'm playing at Player's Park (Oakland)
Everybody on the floor, do you really want some more?
We'll get funky like Playboy $hort (Oh-oh-oh-Oaktown)

Oakland (Oakland) Oaktown (Oh-Oaktown)
Oakland (Oakland) Just get on down

Oh-oh-oh-oak, oak-oak-oak-Oaktown

Westside coming through, Northside coming to it, too
East Oakland it's for you (Oakland)
Californ-I-A, can you hear me say
Oakland is here to stay (Oakland)

Oakland (Oh-oh-oh-Oakland) Oaktown (Oh-oh-oh-Oaktown)
Oakland (Oh-oh-oh-Oakland) Just get on down (Oaktown)

Straight from the West, Oakland is the best
Baby it's so fresh (Oakland)

Oakland (Oh-oh-oh-Oakland) Oakland (Get on down)

Straight from the West, Oakland is the best
