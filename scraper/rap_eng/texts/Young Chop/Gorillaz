[Hook]
Animals on my block and they be going gorillaz
Extendo holds 32 shots you know we going gorillaz
Banana clip in the AK and that bitch going gorillaz
He say he going ape shit well we be going gorillaz
Don't act like you're suprised you know we're borned them killers
And if you holdin' we ain't got it we'll take your fonds lil' nigga
And if we catch an opp slide you better run lil' nigga
Animals on my block and they be going gorillaz

[Verse 1]
Blasthisass on my block and shorty going gorillaz
And yelling out 'Fuck LA' then shit is gonna get realer
32 shots in the Glock call it a fucking brain pealer
Shoot his face off the frame you better get the picture
All my niggas in the cut and they shoot like Django
40 make a nigga change colors i ain't talkin' bout a rainbow
Too busy getting this money I ain't worried about a damn ho
Riding down on a opp block get to blowin' like Rambo
And I keep my gun on me I ain't worried about an opp
And I'm out here in these streets I ain't duckin' shit but the cops
Got some over East got some out West but they're all some drillers
And if I make one phone call then they're going gorillaz

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And if you see em' with me just know they're demons
And if we see a fucking stain then you know we skeemin'
Take him down all we need is a reason
Shoot his ass in the chest make a nigga stop breatin'
Animals on my block and you know they're heartless
And if you come trough trynna flex you gon' be a target
I keep that 30 on me I ain't really with the arguing
So if you holding we'll take you down cause' we starving
Act around Tay600 he still on the gang shit
And unlike these niggas switched up they ain't on the same shit
Yeah all these niggas want clout I don't care about the fame shit
And I don't fuck around new niggas I'm still with the same clique
