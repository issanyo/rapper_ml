[Intro]
She wanna (5x)

[Hook]
She wanna see my visa
She wanna ride my Beamer
She just wanna glo
She's one of those type of hoes
I was smokin' on some reefer
She called me and said she can't wait until no weekend
So we can freak some more
She know my dick dope

[Verse 1]
She hop on me, she ride me like a Harley
I get high like I'm Bob Marley
I be crashing parties, taking all the thotties
Pull up, you better cuff yo ho
Cause she gone go for Almighty Glo
You better duck yo ho, tuck yo ho
Unless you don't want yo ho
My chain be having seizures
My diamonds, they be bleeding
Shining on yo ho, I know she love the glo

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm like why do you come out here
And we can't fuck and you be dryer
She like I am not a thot, I just wanna get higher
I'm high baby girl, can you put out the fire
I just rolled some tooka and I need a lighter
A nigga gone get lined up, steady facetimin'
He just keep on whinin', she keep on declinin'
Ask her am I lying
If I'm lying then I'm dying
I just met me a lil thottie with a body at the party
She got school you thought she was going with you
But that wasn't true
Now we ridin' ridin' ridin' on our way to a different party
She was sucking, she was wilding, I think she was off a molly

[Hook]
