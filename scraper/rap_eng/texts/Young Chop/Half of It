[Hook]
I remember sleepin' crib to crib broke with no clothes
They don't know the half, they don't know the half
Tryna grab my quarter ounce, tryna turn it to a O
They don't know the half, they don't know the half
Say they don't know the half, they don't know the half
They don't know the half of it, they don't know the half of it
They don't know the half, they don't know the half
They don't know the half of it, they don't know the half of it

[Verse 1]
I remember being fucked up, down and bad with no luck (no luck)
Only thing on my mind was a fuckin' come up (come up)
They don't know the half, they don't know the half
They don't know the half of it, they don't know the half of it
Money and  these bitches ain't shit to me (ain't shit to me)
Lord knows I got my niggas and loyalty (and loyalty)
I miss all my niggas, that's R.I.P
But I'mma hold ya'll down up in these streets
Turnt up, got my pipe on me
Glo' up, put that light on me
Keep my gun on me, ain't fin' be no robbery
Fuck homicide and DEA, got bricks in every state
Hundred bricks came in, damn we should celebrate

[Hook]
I remember sleepin' crib to crib broke with no clothes
They don't know the half, they don't know the half
Tryna grab my quarter ounce, tryna turn it to a O
They don't know the half, they don't know the half
Say they don't know the half, they don't know the half
They don't know the half of it, they don't know the half of it
They don't know the half, they don't know the half
They don't know the half of it, they don't know the half of it

[Verse 2]
Fake niggas tryna befriend me (befriend me)
If you with me then we got the same enemies (enemies)
Loyalty before royalty
And it's like that till the end of me
Niggas say my name and it's R.I.P
Fuck the Law, fuck CPD
Only got a brick left, I just sold 6 keys
Tryna get this cake and ain't tryna make mistakes (nah)
She wanna be my bae, but I only want her face (thot!)
Only got one life so live it up (live it up)
All this money comin' in, can't get enough (can't get enough)
If I go broke, I'm stickin' up
Tell you lame ass niggas to give it up
I need that

They don't know the half, they don't know the half
Say they don't know the half, they don't know the half
They don't know the half of it, they don't know the half of it
They don't know the half, they don't know the half
They don't know the half of it, they don't know the half of it
