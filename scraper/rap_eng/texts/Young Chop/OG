Yeah, Alumni Batgang Egh!

I tell you what’s good bitch, my whole team is
If I got a whole lot I break it into pieces
Let’s all roll up OG just makes me feel more G
Somewhere over the ocean
And you still over there on that old shit
I been had yo chick, bagged yo bitch with no foreplay
Hit her with a little bit of vocab' that player shit is my forte
Westside connected like O'Shea
Throwing up that a-ok, batgang
All the way out the hood but I can’t change
Number one on my list
Eating a number 2 in McDonald’s
With 3 chains on my neck
Fo' realest nigga inside here
Better respect me like Aretha
Nigga this watch ain't no Geneva
It's Moet, Patron by the liter at magic city like Eureka
I bet yo man can't do it like this
So many women here to go on my list
Back when you didn't think a nigga exist
Still had yo girlfriend on my dick
I’m popping shit on point with 2 blunts double jointed
Bend back come show me something
Go on, you owe me nothing
You can tell I’m feeling myself
And all this mothefucking money don’t help
Mad at me cause your salary is lightweight like celery
Tellin me why the fuck you at me
No nigga I ain't tryna had a v to that bullshit that you CC
R-I-P killed yo dreams
Aw auto-bang sliding in and outa lanes
Kush got me out of mind top flow like Brothers Bang
Bitch it’s Tha Alumni
Bat tat ain't no other gang
OG in the fucking blunt
OG right before my name

I know you see it Egh!
I’m in this bitch with my hood on
Smoking on that good strong
Yo OG favorite rapper

I tell you what’s good bitch my whole team is
I tell you what’s good bitch my whole team is
Bitch it’s Tha Alumni
Bat tat ain't no other gang
OG in the fucking blunt
OG right before my fucking name
