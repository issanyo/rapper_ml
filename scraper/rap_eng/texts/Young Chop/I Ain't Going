Yeah
Ho ass nigga

[Hook x2]
Nigga bullshit ain't  about nothing
Nigga bullshit ain't  about nothing
Got the blammer homie, nigga I ain't going
Better ask about me, nigga I ain't going

[Verse 1: Count]
Stuntin' like you a hood nigga, boy I come from a war zone
Corny niggas must need attention, fake beef at that award show
That's why I don't like these rap niggas, when I see them I don't shake hands
Nigga I ain't finna phony kick it,  shit, I ain't come here to make friends
And I say it twice, you A&R's couldn't pick a hit to save your life
You ain't from the streets so why the fuck you think you could tell me what they gon' like
Cappin' like you a boss,better feed your entourage nigga
Fuck around and get robbed nigga, found out it's an inside job nigga
Bullshit ain't about nothin', rapper pop a shot at me
Guarantee you one thing, I'll bring a new meaning to rap beef
These shots fired, man down, bodies layin' all in the streets
Record labels like "why the fuck we let Chicago niggas in the industry"

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Mooney]
Ain't no way, I ain't goin' in, no way
Full of fashion, 'bout the action, I live the life that you portray
Your name ain't hold no weight, you the type to help bid a whole case
Type of nigga on Worldstar, gettin' his ass beat on tape
Type of nigga that pay taxes, every time you hit the town
Gettin' [?] for everything, down't say shit, nigga hit the ground
Yeah, don't that sound familiar? You know the story oh so well
Sittin' there all paranoid cause everybody on your coattail
Bullshittin' ain't about nothin', you pump fake nut ain't shot nothing
Give a fuck about the [?], when the feds come, they ain't stop nothing
Go hard, take no L's, make ten G's on a bad day
L.E.P. ain't get out the city, niggas better go get they facts straight

[Hook x2]
