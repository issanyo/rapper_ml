[Intro]
Turned Chiraq to Chicaglo
And he got a hunnid on
Niggas die for what they want
Then I lost hope

[Chorus]
I lost HEC, then I lost hope
Life get tough as a rope, tug of war
Gotta protect the gold from the wars
Protect your energy for you and yours
Can't throw my life away for diamond chokers
And they gon' hear my voice from coast to coast
My mama know my boys, I'm like a [?]
I tell my bitch I love her had to mold her

[Verse]
I lost blood in the street, no diagnosis
So put the heat in his mouth, halitosis
We don't read but we 'bout audios
And only God can judge us for our wrongs
I come from the same blocks as Chief Keef Soo
And fuck on us, say thot, scream "Durkio"
Had to first person I sent pesos
Five hundred thousand, his top went gold
City full of calicos, Givenchy, ain't no Kenneth Cole
Chicago full of menace souls

[Pre-Chorus]
Turned Chiraq to Chicaglo
[?] pull up in a ghost
And he got a hunned on
There niggas trust the stove
Niggas die for what they want

[Chorus]
I lost HEC, then I lost hope
Life get tough as a rope, tug of war
Gotta protect the gold from the wars
Protect your energy for you and yours
Can't throw my life away for diamond chokers
And they gon' help my boys from coast to coast
My mama know my boys, I'm like a [?]
I tell my bitch I love her had to mold her
