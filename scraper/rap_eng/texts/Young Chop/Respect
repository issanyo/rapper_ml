[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Money, power, respect, that’s all a nigga know
I got junkies at my door, I sell a lot of coke
So much dope, so much coke
Trapping can’t get old
It’s that real trap music, man don’t get exposed
Money, power, respect, that’s all a nigga know
I got junkies at my door, I sell a lot of coke
So much dope, so much coke
Trapping can’t get old
It’s that real trap music, man don’t get exposed

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
All these fufu ass niggas, man just move around
If staining up was a sport, I would be up, God damn!
We ain’t wifing these hoes, cause we don’t give a damn
Getting money was a sport, I would be up some fam
Better stay up in your lane cause we don’t give a damn
My youngins with the shits, bitch we don’t give a damn
I say this 30 that I'm blowing it'll lay em down
I keep my circle close cause I don’t fuck around

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana &Lil Reese]
I’m a real trap nigga, you can see it in my eyes
I got weight, lot of grams, and I'm still selling bags
I need a new connect, cause his prices getting high
Threw some bands out at the factory, I’m just trying to get it back
Get it back, get it back, hit the trap, I get it back
I got workers in the back, and they’re pushing all these packs
God damn, God damn, I’m the man, girlfriend
Suck my dick, suck my dick, bitch you gotta do my mans
Any stains any licks, you know I need ends
Kick the door, lay you down, split the profit with my mans
Aye Reese what up man
Aye Fredo you know, we getting it in
Aye Reese
Split the profit with my mans
300
