[Hook]
Niggas be talkin' that gangsta shit

[Verse 1 - Young Chop]
Nigga ask about me, nigga what's up?
[?] up in the back with the 30 tucked
Make one false move, we'll fuck you up
Big draco on the side nigga, buck buck
Nigga you can lose your life if you want to
My niggas they don't play by no fuckin' rules
Kill you and your mothafuckin' momma too
Bitch
Fuck the bitch, I don't need her
Send her back, I don't need her
Fuck the bitch, I mistreat her
Kick her out and don't feed her
Niggas know how I'm bumpin'
Niggas know how I'm rockin'
Pistol on me while I'm trappin'
Niggas snoozin', why yo lackin'?
Chick-fil-a, Polynesian
I'm a savage, I'm a demon
All these fuck niggas tweakin'
Can you tell me what's the reason?
You niggas ain't gettin' no money though
Niggas ain't gettin' no money though
Niggas ain't gettin' no money though

[Hook]
Niggas be talkin' that gangsta shit

All that pillow talkin', nigga
My niggas be shootin' that 30
Catch your bitch ass at the red light

We got Stephen Curry Curry
Bitch, we shootin' that 30
