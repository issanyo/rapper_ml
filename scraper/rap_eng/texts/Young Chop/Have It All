[Chorus: Swagg Dinero & Lil JoJo]
If you grabbing, then we taxing, you can have it all
Yeah, bitch, we got them racks and you can have it all
If it's commas that's involved, you can have it all
It ain't shit to a boss, you can have it all
Big cannon in my draws, you can have it all
Bust some shots at a opp, watch his body fall
Whole thirty, let 'em off, you can have it all
If you holding, hit your pockets, bitch, I need it all

[Verse 1: Swagg Dinero]
Okay, off the top, how I do this shit, I get a lot of niggas hatin'
To me, that shit all good 'cause that's how we gon' get paid
I'm a beast up in these True's, who the fuck is you?
My niggas totin' tools, Bob the Builder on these dudes
Too many Swishers, I can't roll 'em up
Pass 'em to my bitch, yeah, she know what's up
She bad as fuck and she drillin' quick
Pass her to my man's and I bet he hit
All my niggas reckless, tatted like some eses
Liquor in my cup, speedin', no expressway
The highway, yeah, that's my way
(The highway, yeah, that's my way)
Leave 'em dead in the driveway
(Leave 'em dead in the driveway)
Edai, you can have it all, all the drillers feel the same
Told her, "I ain't no psychiatrist, but I want that brain"

[Chorus: Swagg Dinero & Lil JoJo]
If you grabbing, then we taxing, you can have it all
Yeah, bitch, we got them racks and you can have it all
If it's commas that's involved, you can have it all
It ain't shit to a boss, you can have it all
Big cannon in my draws, you can have it all
Bust some shots at a opp, watch his body fall
Whole thirty, let 'em off, you can have it all
If you holding, hit your pockets, bitch, I need it all

[Verse 2: Lil JoJo]
My niggas official, boy, they bound to kill (Bound to kill)
Catch a opp, he gettin' popped just like a pill (Just like a pill)
My niggas 'bout that life, so we keep the steel (They with it)
It ain't no game in the field, boy, this shit is real
Niggas snakes, so you better watch who you trust
Same niggas you kick it with, same niggas that get you fucked up
But I ain't with that tricky shit (I'm not)
Smokin' dope, real dope, yeah, that sticky shit (Loud)
I got a bad bitch, pretty face, she thick as shit
Took her to the crib and gave her ass the dope dick
She say, "JoJo, eat me!" I say, "No, bitch! (What's wrong with you?)
What the fuck is wrong with you? You a thot, bitch"

[Chorus: Swagg Dinero & Lil Mister]
If you grabbing, then we taxing, you can have it all
It's Montana, boy, I got the .40 by my draws
If it's commas that's involved, you can have it all
I'm in the field, this shit for real, boy, we don't play at all
Big cannon in my draws, you can have it all
Say hello, say hello to my little friend (Bang)
Whole thirty, let 'em off, you can have it all
We sendin' shots, sendin' shots, boy, we don't play at all

[Verse 3: Lil Mister]
Bitch, it's Montana, I'm finna leave 'em all
I got bands all in my pockets, finna spend it all
I'm with some thots, they finna bop, we finna smash 'em all
Cashin' out on you therms, finna hit the mall
Young Chop on the beat, now, these fuck boys look really lost
I'm in my zone, off the smoke, finna spaz on y'all
I'm dreaded up, I got some ink, finna shift on y'all
Never lacking, bitch, we packin' gats on y'all (Bang)
I'm goin' crazy in the booth, dawg (Insane)
My niggas hard body, we don't play at all
We drillin' hard, but we don't fuck around
I fuck your bitch and then she knock me down

[Chorus: Swagg Dinero & P. Rico]
If you grabbing, then we taxing, you can have it all
Shawty droppin' draws like she use the stall (Eater)
If it's commas that's involved, you can have it all
Yeah, we got that bag, so we love to ball (Racks)
Big cannon in my draws, you can have it all
Chopper make noise, then these niggas fall (Blatt, blatt!)
Whole thirty, let 'em off, you can have it all
(No lacking) Team No Lackin', thirty hit 'em all

[Verse 4: P. Rico]
Every fuckin' day, boy, we hit the mall
Yeah, I'm with my niggas and my niggas dogs
We fall out, we pass out the way we ball
Shorty doing dicks, she ain't got no walls
Coolin' on the block and my niggas buck
Steady smokin' loud, smellin' like a skunk
Steady rollin' loud in them Swisher blunts
Your bitch, man, she a chewer, she gon' chew me up
If we see a opp, then he better duck
And if I ain't got it, then he gettin' stomped
And then we hit the gas while he in the trunk
Team No Lackin', you get fired up

[Outro: P. Rico]
Let's get it!
