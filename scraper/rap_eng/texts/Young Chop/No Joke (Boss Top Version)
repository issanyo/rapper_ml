[Hook: Young Thug]
My whole life I like gang bang
Chief Keef a nigga, we bang, bang, whoa
I love them, they love me, we tango
They help me steady chill like Pringles
This weed I smoke's no joke
This drink I drink's no joke
Yo foreign ain't no joke
My old lady ain't no joke
YSL ain't no joke, no joke, no joke, no joke
I swear it's not a joke
No joke, no joke, no joke, I swear

[Verse 1: Boss Top]
Pop a flat let's float
Catch an opp, let's go!
All I had to gang bang, coming up weren't no joke
I love my fucking shorties 'cuz when I point, they blow
I like my bitches slutty 'cuz nut up in their throat
I-I-I love getting money 'cuz I-I hate to be broke
Don't flex up on the internet, in person don't want no smoke
We'll step up in your town, summer time, we'll make it snow
She begging me for dick, I love to tell her no
These rap niggas they ain't street, these rap niggas get exposed
These rap niggas don't clap heat, these rap niggas don't tote pole
Me I got three chains on and all these bitches froze
I'm all about the Benjis, [?] that's my bro

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Fuck all y'all niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck my bitch, cause I'm down with these bitches
I'm gettin' 'round with these bitches
I'm down for my nigga, aye
My eyes like a cooler, I got a fresh Muller
Act tough and I'll suit ya, point at Chris no Luda
Trunk of my car look like a Buda
Catch ya bitch and recruit her
Brush ya hair for oodles and noodles
Lil shawty look foolish
Got her turnt down like she work at Hooters
Got her red like Freddie Krueger
Open the door for my shawty
Gang tight, ain't no E-40
AP look kinda sport, sheesh
