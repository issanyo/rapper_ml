[Chorus]
Fuck it up, I fuck it up I do
Run it up, I run it up I do
Fuck it up, I fuck it up I do
Run it up, I run it up I do
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two
Rockstar shit, bitch I need my room
Bitch I need my space
Hoe I need some face
Got her so high thought she was laced
Tory in her mouth she love the taste
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two

[Verse 1 : Young Chop]
Hey, party like a rockstar
Live my life like a popstar
Bitch I trap like a trapstar
Twenty K in my [?]
All hundreds we don't do twenties
Fuck Xans we just do perkies
Niggas see we keep them semi's with us
I'm eating good Benihana on my plate nigga
Yeah a nigga [?]
[?] trapping out granny's basement
No food on the table had to take shit
Recording this in some shit look like a spaceship

[Chorus]
Fuck it up, I fuck it up I do
Run it up, I run it up I do
Fuck it up, I fuck it up I do
Run it up, I run it up I do
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two
Rockstar shit, bitch I need my room
Bitch I need my space
Hoe I need some face
Got her so high thought she was laced
Tory in her mouth she love the taste
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two

[Verse 2 : Yung Tory]
I feel like Ice T
Why?
Coz I got a white hoe
A white bitch
She suck me dry like it's lipo
We get drawn like the white folks
Percocet I got weed, I got what you need
That's your man, he a fiend, he be smoking seeds
I don't get in between, she get on her knees
Give me top and I leave it's back to the cheese

[Chorus]
Fuck it up, I fuck it up I do
Run it up, I run it up I do
Fuck it up, I fuck it up I do
Run it up, I run it up I do
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two
Rockstar shit, bitch I need my room
Bitch I need my space
Hoe I need some face
Got her so high thought she was laced
Tory in her mouth she love the taste
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two
Rockstar shit, don't need one, I need two
