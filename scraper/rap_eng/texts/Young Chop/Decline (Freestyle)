(Intro)
GO KYS

(Verse)
Im eating She keep on stealing my food
And then i slap her
And then she stop
Yay
Yea she be hogging
I keep declining
She keep on whining
My diamonds shining
My money piling
Wanna fuck for my big chain
Wanna roll with me 'cuz i'm da king
Her main nigga he so lame
Wanna fuck me 'cuz i'm huncho gang
She call my phone like a hotline
She don't understand she not mine
Doing this shit since '09
Run up wrong i'll hit you with a 4-5
King Breezy still work kitchens
I don't spend money on no bitches
One Huncho with my niggas
I know real niggas gone fuck with us
Wanna fuck me 'stead of a no name
My niggas be on the same thang
Stay riding thru all the opp shit
She calling me she block list
Hit her ass once with the get right
Now she call my phone almost everynight
Fuck one time don't wanna wife
Don't wanna wife
Don't wanna wife

(Bridge)
Hit her ass once with the get right
Now she call my phone almost every night
Fuck one time don't wanna wife
Don't wanna wife
Nahh nahh nahh

(Outro)

She keep on whining
Gang

Keep calling
I keep declining
But she keep whining
