Hook
I know that I’m the one, I only trust a few
Even though I be the shit, I ain't never number two
Why the fuck I need a calendar, I do this everyday
When I’m smoking on this green, got me seeing shades of grey

Verse 1 Lil Marley

Running through this green, man I need a heisman
We all gotta sack, where your offensive linemen?
Hoes all up on a nigga cuz they know I be rhyming
She gon do what I say, name ain't even simon
Got my nigga in the back, got a bitch in the front
Niggas ain't got no balls, if they did, they would punt
Stuntin like BMX, stuntin more than BMX
All bark, no bite, call yo ass DMX
Got her so turned on, she charge me with batteries
She go to church on Sunday, so I fucked her on a Saturday
Mind over matter, whats on your mind don’t matter dog
All this paper got my wallet like a catalog

Hook
I know that I’m the one, I only trust a few
Even though I be the shit, I ain't never number two

Verse 2 lil marley
Blunt fat, young chop, niggas soft, gun drop
Weed loud, gun shots, two chicks, one cock
They take shots, no block, getting stoned, no rocks
Quit lookin down on me, like I got no shoes, no socks
Marley Magic Tree, on face book, your bitch adding me
I told her boyfriend that I hit, and now that nigga mad at me
And I be so high, I ain't walking bitch I flew in
And that pussy like a fetus, what yall niggas doin?
But her pussy is a party, cuz she let the crew in
My double cup up, I say cheers, hatin niggas booin
I brought two in, two grams, two dimes, two tens
I don’t like her, she too thin, but im looking at her two friends
They smiling at me, two grins, I play - to win
I’m straight nigga you two men, I came fuckin to sin
Stop buggin me like critters, told her ‘drop that ass’ - she littered
Sour diesel got my lungs bitter, drugs- I stay on em like glitter

Hook
I know that I’m the one, I only trust a few
Even though I be the shit, I ain't never number two
Why the fuck I need a calendar, I do this everyday
When smoking on this green, got me seeing shades of grey
