[Intro]
Young Chop on the Beat
Car I'm ridin' like a nightlight
So much cash that my pockets look pregnant
They all know I'm knocked up
Ridin' like a nightlight, stop at the stoplight
Drove off, ran the red light, there the cops is
Tryna put me into lock up
Remember having rocks in my timbos
Ran off with the coke money
Pull up, bounce out the all-white thing
Sosa, baby, GBE, baby
That there is a snow bunny

[Hook]
The car I'm riding, like a nightlight
Ain't gone stop at the stoplight
I sip Barney, you sip stop sign, yeah that sounds about right
I wear astronaut clothes
Pull up foreign, beat Kongo
Take 300 out Wells Fargo
I don't wait in line, no bar-codes
You see your reflection in my ice
I left you, boy you not right
My bitch so bad that's it's not nice
Say hi, get top, then it's bye-bye
You smokin' on low, boy you're not high
I keep spinach, like Popeye
Brown bag full of cash, no white rice
All the cash out the bank, that's a light heist

[Verse 1]
Pull up, peeking out the car, no sound proof
Let the MAC out the top, no sun roof
Throwing cash out the top, I'ma bank-teller
Ride the car like I rode the Mongoose
Fill yo block up til it's no more
Hear the SoundClick, no Johnny Juliano
I'm on the high-speed, OJ in the bronco
Got the Yao Ming and Mutombo
I be with Smokey and the bandits
You a cat but you be with the rat pack
Runnin' for the ball, intercept that
If I don't, that's where you get sacked at
Party too hot like Crisco, pop pop
I got enough cream for the whole cafe, no Hard Rock
Remember having rocks in my timbos
Ran off with the coke money
Pull up, bounce out the all-white thing
That there is a snow bunny
Pull up to the show get the 40 G's, do that in one hour
What the fuck do I hop in when I leave
That there is a snow plower

[Hook]
The car I'm ridin' like a nightlight
And I ain't gone stop at the stoplight
I sip Barney, you sip stop sign, yeah that sounds about right
I wear astronaut clothes
Pull up foreign, beat Kongo
Take 300 out Wells Fargo
I don't wait in line, no bar-codes
You see your reflection in my ice
I left you, boy you not right
My bitch so bad that's it's not nice
Say hi, get top, then it's bye-bye
You smokin' on low, boy you're not high
I keep spinach, like Popeye
Brown bag full of cash, no white rice
All the cash out the bank, that's a light heist
