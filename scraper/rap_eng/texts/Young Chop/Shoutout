[Hook: French Montana]
Let me give a shoutout to my real bitches (x4)
Go and bust it open for a real nigga (x4)

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Le me give a shoutout my perfection bitches
Sin city suz in all the bitches
Let me give a shoutout to Miami bitches
Poppin' on bottles instagram the bitches
Let me give a shoutout my Atlanta bitches
Magic city strokers in my high expenses
Let me give a shoutout to my Cali all
Ride down sunset phantom road
Let me give a shoutout to my Dallas bitches
Alabama baby there the bitches
Let me give a shoutout my Chicago bitches
All the squirrels in the model bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Fuck a money machine we weigh a duffle bag
Bought a condo just to keep my duffle stashed
She ain't fucking we stick her in the yellow cab
Call my ugly yellow bitch tats of her yellow ass
Got a bitch I'm hella bad pistol it go rad a tat
New Orleans nigga I can't help with my savage ass
Bad bitches only I ain't fucking with your average ass
Unless you gonna bust it open then you bring back daddy cash
Shout out to my real bitches I ain't fucking with fake hoes
Fake purses, fake hair, fake nails, fake clothes
YMCMB we get cheese watch me take a pose
I see some bad bitches in your section and I'm taking hoes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Big money talking never ends never fall
Bet 20 something I'm stunting on these dog hoes
Real bitches army work in the garbage can
Hundred grand on me nigga motherfucker band
Got a bunch of money nigga in the money bag
The money bag nigga feel with the money bag
Got a rich bitch just bought a lotus
GT vodka on the cigarette, rum and smoking
Big shit talker big deal offer
Bad bitches on my line nigga like a stalker
Fuck counting sheep versaci on the sheets
The birdman nigga 20 million on a beach

[Hook]
