[Verse 2: Snap Dogg]
Up at night
Hell wrong
I can't fuckin' sleep
Grip on my Glock
With the beam
Thinkin' bout the beast
Mama go hard for them bills
So I gotta hustle
You don't know where rap come from
You don't know my struggle
And now a nigga switched up
Since they got above us
Some of my bitches
Some of my niggas
Man who can I trust
I'm tired of all the bullshit
With these baby mommas
Tweets after tweets
All that fuckin' drama
25 I was facin' in a fuckin' cell
Cold nights just thinking
I can't make bail
I lost my twin to these streets
Ya that shit hurt
Success is on the way
I'm fuckin' down' shows wit Durk
