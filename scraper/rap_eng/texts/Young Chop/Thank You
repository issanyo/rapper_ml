[Hook x2]
Who I do it for?
Who I do it for?
I do it for my daughter and my family
I do it for my peoples ain't no bounties
I do it for my niggas who don’t doubt me

[Verse 1]
No worries, no worries
Shit ain’t been the same but I can’t worry
Money got me movin’ I got royalties
It’s different situation, it’s just more than me
I got loyalties they just prepare for me
I’m a boss with my own so just ready when he
You won’t send shots ‘til you’re game over
I got money hangovers, don’t wanna feel sober
My eyes closed, my eyes closed
No I don’t see nobody to depend on
I got my eyes closed, my eyes closed
No ain’t nobody else gon’ have my back long
But…

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Momma, Momma
Anybody else don’t want no problems
I [?] you out, kill just like Osama
To much in my ways so I’m a sober
I got habits, problems so I focus on the money harder
Sometimes I sit, think I might just ruin them carters
Cause I risk it all for it I promise
I got my squad with me
No hard feelin’s
But if a nigga try me, they are all there
I got my squad with me, they all with me
I do this on my fam they all can ball with me
Cause…
