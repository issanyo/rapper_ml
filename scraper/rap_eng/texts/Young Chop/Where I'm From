[Intro]
I swear these niggas to lame for me
Finna make the hoes leave
Girl where you going?

[Verse 1: Johnny May Cash]
Cooling with my young niggas
We rolling up we toting them Glocks
And if you sneak dissin' on the squad
Runnin' your mouth, fuck around and get shot
Hunnid' racks in the shoe box
All these hoes yeah they thots
Nigga say they walk around with knots
Nah niggas ain't seeing no gwaup
We spend the cash can't stop
Riding round in this drop
I gotta pass everybody just get fucked
These niggas ain't really who you think they are
Ainâ€™t never satisfied with one broad
Gotta have more then one
Keep the squad with me everywhere that I go and
You know my niggas fear none

[Hook]
I got Ferragamo, I got Gucci
Got a little bit of Louis spend money be fun
If you can't get down with the squad
If you ain't fucking with us
Then you ain't where I'm from
I got Ferrogamo, I got Gucci, got a little bit of Louis
Spend money be fun
A lot of niggas talk that shit but I ain't
Bout that shit unless you get
Hit with that tommy gun

[Verse 2: SD]
One phone call to my niggas man
You know they coming out blowing
No army and my squad above me
Got missiles don't let them launch
You can catch me in the back chilling
Counting money can not go wrong
I'm a hot head, got cold ways so you
Better come at me blowing
It's just something can't change like
Money that never get boring
It ain't no big thing if my gun jam
Cause my nigga on the side of me blowing
I ain't tipsy she drinking I see that she tryna have fun
It's just small things like always
Got me feeling like I'm the one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: SD]
Can't blame me its just me I ain't
Tryna do nothin' but have fun
I'm the same me in that white tee
Now I'm stunting on all you bums
She me my best friend give good head
But I gotta have more then one
You can miss me with that bullshit
Cause I'm feeling like everything one
I smoke good tree with an empty
But you better watch where you going
It's a damn shame these clips hang
Be careful you ain't from where I'm from

[Hook]
