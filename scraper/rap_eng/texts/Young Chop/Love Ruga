[Intro]
Nothing moving but the money, nigga
I said nothing moving but my money, nigga
Ruga's back, let me talk to these niggas
What's up, real niggas?
Chief Keef, what's up my young nigga?
This shit hot
Lil Reese I was in the middle of the shot with you, nigga
With them 35's
Oh, y'all know that's them 30 round clips, nigga

[Verse]
These niggas love Ruga, streets love Ruga
Hop out with my shooter acting like they knew us
These niggas don't know us, their bitches can blow us
Pay extra for them keys, yeah, the plug owe us
Hardo on my left hand, beams on my right hand
Yeah, I'm on that nigga shit, put money like a white man
Bentleys and [?] we don't fly coaches
Dely get the Raid can, these niggas is roaches
'Fore I caught with Deepsy I was selling bricks
I ain't had no baby mamma drumming on no kids
Ask around the town nigga, yeah, I'm a fair shoe
Baby I'm a team player, you go fuck the clique, too
Ok, ok, enough, enough the Chief Keef flow
You a rabbit, get street dough
Why you watching them broke niggas?
Pay attention to me, hoe
Yeah, I'm talking that fly shit, penthouse to high... shit
If you talking 'bout one of me and my niggas
You die, shit
Off topic, you talk with, let me chill on 'em
Let the champagne chill on 'em
Make a motherfucker another mil on 'em
Call me Mr. Miyagi, wax on, wax off, nigga
Now you see me, now you don't, 9-11 Porsche nigga
