[Hook]
I walk around with that sack on me
Cause I know I’m Gucci
I walk around with that gat on me
And I’m around my little homies
You’re my little homies

[Verse 1]
I can turn a four to a nine
I ain't talkings nicks and dimes
It's get rich or die trying
Now its time to ride or die
I wonder why this rap shit is more than life
They got my ice its shinning like a light
You’re damn right young nigga got money for life
You’re damn right anybody can't live this life

[Bridge]
But I can buy life with my coat
And once I step my foot in that door
I’mma glo they gonna know that I’mma stay getting money
I love these new hundreds
I pray to God that money keep coming
And why you stunting
Knowing damn well you ain't getting money
Slide on your block get to stunting
Hop out like it was nothing
Don’t push my buttons
I swear this shit is nothing

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I stay getting bands though
I trap at out the bando
Cause I hate when my cash low
I pull up in jags though
I love how the cash flow
You know how the game goes
Can't flex with the same hoe
We ain't on the same boat
And I’m gonna be the same nigga that till I go
And you gonna be the same nigga that is broke
Why are you trippin’ off for that hoe?
Nigga I been getting money since 04

[Bridge]
