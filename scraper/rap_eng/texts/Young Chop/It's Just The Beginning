[Intro]
It's just the beginning (x8)

[Verse 1]
Lets think before you speak
Be more critique lately been losing it
Best words, get guwap that's why my mind influence me
Pistol perfect imagine you in Disney, no secret service
No I ain't chancing with you bumblebees
It's just a start, it's just beginning
Holy moly donut shop, don't know lieutenant
Money to be made I chase the soul and getting it
I prefer consistence it ain't no decision
Self start, nigga watch me take flight
It's just a start, nigga watch me buzz light

[Hook]
Coming from the bottom to the top took so much energy
Been feeling kinda lonely at the top that ain't my memory
It's just a start, it's just beginning
Situation is so hope he comprehending
Coming from the bottom to the top took so much energy
Been feeling kinda lonely at the top that ain't my memory
It's just a start, it's just beginning
Situation is so hope he comprehending

[Bridge]
It feel like no ending
It's the start, the beginning
Don't think too much just start living
I'm just here minding my business

[Verse 2]
Impressed and desperate
I feel too blow to sing, the stress the pressure
You niggas know that I refresh the blessings
I think I'm chosen, I'm just check it check it
No witnesses but I'm just learning lessons
Politics, niggas they forget the message
Don't feel ashamed boy I accomplish missions
Exceed the standards we was living reckless and living lavish
Deal cards, it took some time but got right
It's just the start, but nigga watch me live life

[Hook]
Coming from the bottom to the top took so much energy
Been feeling kinda lonely at the top that ain't my memory
It's just a start, it's just beginning
Situation is so hope he comprehending
Coming from the bottom to the top took so much energy
Been feeling kinda lonely at the top that ain't my memory
It's just a start, it's just beginning
Situation is so hope he comprehending

It's just the beginning (x8)
