[Verse 1]
Ok I need bands
Kick a nigga door and take everything that's worth it
Then split it with my mans
No snitches on my end, don't be no stupid ass
Treat our guns like a car, make them hit yo stupid ass
Then roll up some loud, climb up these trees
And for these bands, bitch get on your knees
And it's bands over bitches cause these bitches out here skeetin'
You can't trust no bitch probably somewhere on her knees

[Bridge] (2x)
That's why I'm all about my bands
Blow kush with my mans
Got one fuckin' daughter so all I need is bands

[Hook]
On money I'm the man, bitch I need bands
Listen again I need bands, I need bands, I need bands
Smoke her out her pants, she got a stupid ass
And we keep 30 bullets that'll shoot yo stupid ass
Bitch I'm the man, bitch I need bands
Listen again I need bands, I need bands, I need bands
You are a stupid ass, he had a stupid cast
Bitch I'm the man, bitch I need bands

[Verse 2]
Shorty been smoking dope
Black, look like I'm Japan
We don't do this shit for free, we be all about them ends
300 them my mans, yo bitch all on my mans
We fuck her, run a train but that bitch won't see no bands
I got alot of fans, and to them I'm the man
When they see me in reality they like' "Damn, he is the man and he be with them mans and they be about they bands."
We ain't graduate from school so we take a nigga's ends
I hear alot of bitches saying, "Chief Keef they digging."
But they like my alter ego, they say, "Sosa" every minute
And I fuck them out they panties but them hoes won't get a penny
And I'd rather sip lean Reese money like that remy

[Hook] (2x)
