[Intro]
Yea,Yup

[Hook]
And i tell em ,If i don't grind then i don't eat
If i don't shine then i don't sleep
Coffee keep me up I gotta chase the cream
Fuck fame, I gotta feed the team
Imma get it till the death of me
Imma get it till the death of me
Imma get it till the death of me
Fuck fame, I gotta feed the team

[Verse 1]
I come straight from the gutta
Shout out to my my mother
My sisters my brothers
Love em like no other
Told em if I don't grind then i don't eat
If I don't shine then i don't sleep
Them days when I struggled
Had no money, had nothing to eat
I'm like kanye talking through the wire
Weak rappers should retire
Gotta grip on the game like some pliers
I keep applying
And this shit ain't just rhyming
Gotta put the time in
Get in the booth and spit some facts
If I'm lying I'm dying
I speak real shit when i spit
I'm tryna go legit
I ain't worried bout shit
Nigga no time for no bitch
Cause I chase money don't chase hoes
I fuck once then change clothes
I only fuck with a few niggas
I guess that's how the game goes

[Hook]

[Verse2]
At the top it's just me
That's all I really need
Die hard chasing the paper
Just to put on for the team[Holdup]
Young nigga tryna live the dream
Tryna get the doe
Tryna get the money in between
Gotta put us on the map
Imma grind hard nigga fuck you mean
If you ain't rockin with the kid,then fuck you
If you ain't no day one nigga
I can trust you
May all my haters rest in peace
I still love you
Shout out to all them girls that fuck me over
Now its fuck you,yea fuck you[uh]
I'm shitting on the game
Like two girls and one cup
You never worked that hard
My nigga you just lucked up
I'm putting in this work
Family on my back
Pointing me in the direction,Tryna keep me on track[Yup]

[Hook]
