[Hook]

I ride with all my niggas, boy we hot as fuck
Too many niggas think that they could fuck with us
These niggas think they hot, these bullets heat em up
A hunnid shot tec, would clear the crowd up

[Verse 1]

A hunnid shot tek clear the crowd up
Man down I could get him gunned up
A fuck nigga hate it when he see me
I flex on a nigga try to be me
It's 300 of the gas and you can't tell me shit
Two faced niggas fake I ain't with that
And I smoke a lot of Kush, lungs fucked up
She a bad bitch, she just wanna fuck niggas
Don't show no sympathy for all you fuck niggas
I keep my circle tight, too many fuck niggas
This Fufu ass niggas need to calm down
A hunnid in this round, leave his ass down
Too many new niggas no time to learn names
My lil niggas on point baby on all things
A lot of niggas think that they be hot as us
I'm riding all foreign bout to giddy up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I been hot, been turnt up
Stuntin on these niggas, they done fucked up
Couple racks I spend, lil niggas sacked up
You try to rob me, you got me fucked up
These niggas too fugazy, move the fuck around
Don't trust my own type, too many hold me down
I'm busy taking down, every nigga bitch
She trynna do the team, let the squad hit
Couple Kush blunts'll put me on the clouds
I'm sucking motion pictures, clips got extra rounds
We talking money, then you know we state to state
We got choppers and berettas, leave you in the lake
Half ass niggas, pick your feet up,Â 
Fredo in the cut, boy don't get wet up
I'm flexing nigga, test me you get sketched up
Picture painted perfect when we stepped up

[Hook]
