[Verse 1]
Hey where you started, nigga? Came in the game at the age of 6
I was a young'n, y'all new rappers ain't doin' shit
Everything I did, I been did it, once more
Blogs talkin' that broke shit, make 20 million off them Scream Tours
Lot of niggas still cuffin' hoes that I've been fucked, stalkin' their Instagram, lovin' these bitches
Can't even go out in public and chill with my daughter without the paps takin' their pictures
Who actually crip walkin' and rockin' braids (me!), this rap shit is all in my DNA
Founded by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, don't give a fuck what you got to say
BET money too good, contract lookin' like Kobe (I'm ballin')
Me and JD still good (my nigga), forever y'all be my homie
Chris keep your head up and when you get out of rehab we gon' hit the road and get our bread up
Who you think started this shit? Y'all no nobody else do it better

They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
I been poppin' bottles, been fuckin' these models
Y'all niggas just start makin' money, y'all new to this, huh?
I been rockin' Cubans, been ridin' in foreigns
Been cockin' since day 1, y'all niggas should know that, though, huh?

[Verse 2]
Shit, I was talkin' to Hov, nigga
I don't mean to brag or boast, nigga
Nah fuck that, 2 Cubans on him, that's a kilo, nigga
Y'all rappers barely goin' gold, I'm 10 million sold, nigga
Been hot since the Death Row days, from movies to TV, I got it on lock
I see these pussy ass niggas, all in my mentions, hatin', but I won't stop
When they gon' learn they can't count me out? Child support, they tried to wipe me out
But I got bread so I beat the case, so important that your paper's straight
Learned that from my old heads, OGs taught me the game
Look at your career and then look at mine and then wonder why shit not the same
Been ridin' Bentley's, been ridin' 'Rari's since '96, where the fuck you was?
Prolly watchin' me on TV, wanna be me, tryna catch a buzz
