[Intro]
Sosa baby, you know how I'm rockin' baby
Free my niggas man
O'Block
Chop what up man?
Who's these niggas, I don't know them?
Who's these niggas, I don't know them?

[Chorus]
This nigga looking at me like he want some
Pistol to his face if he owe some
My niggas they keep them tools make 'em blow some
OTF they ride for Sosa
Riding with my hitters bitch we on some
Ride on an oppa' and then smoke 'em
Yeah we keep them horns we will blow them
Who is these niggas, I don't know them?

[Verse 1]
GBE bitch we hot bitch we smokin'
I'm chokin', what I'm smoking potent
I'm leaning, rolling and I'm totin'
You know where it's O end or no end
3Hunna bitch don't make me bring them killers out
Real shit, free all my hitters out
Don't make me bring them killers out
Yous a dead man now they need forensics out
Tech chop like lawn mowers
Feds listening, shit, short convo
Hit a nigga with a combo
What I'ma fight for, my choppers drum roll

[Chorus]
This nigga looking at me like he want some
Pistol to his face if he owe some
My niggas they keep them tools make 'em blow some
OTF they ride for Sosa
Riding with my hitters bitch we on some
Ride on an oppa' and then smoke 'em
Yeah we keep them horns we will blow them
Who is these niggas, I don't know them?

[Verse]
Throwing L's up, with the Glocks up
Don't start us, can't stop us
Everywhere they spot us
Choppers like helicopters
Word around this nigga Stevie
I don't give a fuck with contacts, come see me
I love getting tree-tree
Smoke kush get head by Kiki
I need that, I'm up now
A problem, we up now
My gun screaming "what?" now
You on that tough shit? Our guns act tough now

[Chorus]
This nigga looking at me like he want some
Pistol to his face if he owe some
My niggas they keep them tools make 'em blow some
OTF they ride for Sosa
Riding with my hitters bitch we on some
Ride on an oppa' and then smoke 'em
Yeah we keep them horns we will blow them
Who is these niggas, I don't know them?
