[Intro]
I stay hearing stories, stories
I have these niggas' money never stop
These bitches they bore me, bore me
Girl that pussy weak just give me top

[Hook]
I stay hearing stories, stories
I have these niggas clean and getting guwap
You should feel sorry, sorry
Cause you fell off and you broker than you thought
I don't want no Maury, no Maury
Girl I don't want the baby anyway
These hoes they annoying, annoying
Girl I'm too busy tryna get some cake

[Verse 1: SD]
I stay hearing stories, stories
I have these niggas' money never stop
These bitches they bore me, bore me
Girl that pussy weak just give me top
This about the glory, the glory
That's why I had to fall in love with guwap
I don't want no Maury, no Maury
Girl why you tryna knock me from the top?
You should feel sorry, sorry
Cause you was up just tryna get some cake
Money coming always, no off days
Girl I'm too busy loading up the stock

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SD]
This bitch steady calling, nagging and stalking
Girl I'm just tryna get the fuck away
I'm tryna be cautious, not nauseous
Girl why you so annoying anyway?
You should be out balling, not fallen
I think you better hustle out the state
You too busy talking, and stalling
I think this money got me feeling great
We could be out palm trees and OG
Girl I'll make you feel some kind of way
You used to the barking, and howling
Girl I ain't tryna steer you the wrong way

[Hook]
