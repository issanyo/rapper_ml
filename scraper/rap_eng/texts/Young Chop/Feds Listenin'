[Intro]
I'mma tell you how my people went to jail, ya feel me
Doin' life, 50 plus (Free 'em)
Feds people took my people down
Then they got caught with them M's
Let them niggas out, man

[Hook]
I Heard The Feds Listenin x10

[Verse 1]
My momma, told me, Chrisy Louie, had the feds wit 'em
My momma, know I'm hard, body, and I ain't scared nigga
Born in 92, I grew up wit no dad nigga
And when I catch 'em he a dead nigga (bang!)
This is for my niggas wit the feds nigga
It's so fucked up, we talk through glass nigga
Your nigga move that dope, that glass nigga (that work, work)
I wish my nigga used that mask nigga
They gave you 40 from that last case
2 chains on but I'mma add base
Tryna' throw Rico, gave me headaches
Then they tried to snake me then its that red tape

I Heard The Feds Listenin x10

[Verse 2]
Nigga you a wangsta and you ain't pop none
My hits like my studio shit I drop some
What you know bout wakin' up to them blocked numbers?
Can't call back, but you know they wanna couple hunnids
My barber for my kids, like hey I'm out a job
Free my niggas doing calenders, Green Dot them all
3oo, for that Rico, there's not a lot of us
You can't join us, nor beat us need a lot of trust
He in the Law library, like where he go wrong at?
I told that nigga, that his phone is tapped
He supposed to be right here flexin cuz he donâ€™t belong now
He got the message, don't think that nigga got the wrong LL

[Skit]
*Phone ring* "Hello"
"What up bro what's wrong"
*Laughs* "Wrapping up these bricks"
Keepin' it flowin' where you at, you ready?"
"Ok bitch, where you at?"
"Yeah, I'm downtown on my way down there now"
"I'm gonna grab my son, take him back to the crib"
"I'm gon' shoot down to the burbs right now"
"How many bricks you need?"
"Hey, you know what all the shit you have"
"Alright let's do it, say no more"
"I got 10 bricks for you, let's get it"
