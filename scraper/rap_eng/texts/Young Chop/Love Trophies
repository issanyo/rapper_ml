These bitches love trophies
You don't even know boy
Fuckin' with the GB niggas
You gon' get fucked over
Fuck yo Scuf controller
Pop you off that head glitch
Now you rage quit
And you cry like a little bitch
Three digits in one case
Wantin' to grind all day
You can drop a donut
'Cause we'll carry yo ass anyway
I dare you to flood me
Kick me if you want to
I'll fry yo fuckin router
That is somethin' you want me to do (yeah)

Ya dropped host when we was 6-0

That M8A, one class, best believe yo ass is gettin' tagged (yeah)
But when I pull out that MSMC nigga
Yo ass is gettin' dropped when I rush straight down the fuckin' mid nigga

Jumpshot yo ass from a mile away
Pussy niggas still are scared to push up
When I rush yo ass, better step yo gunskill up

Fuck around and you gon' get yo cherry popped
Dropshot me and get yo dome clocked
