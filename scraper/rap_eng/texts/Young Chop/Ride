[Hook]
I'ma die for my niggas
Pull up on the fire with my niggas
I'ma die for my niggas
I'ma mothafuckin' ride for my niggas
If they doin' what I'm doin' bad
I'ma ride for my niggas
I'm a rider, I'm a rider, I'm a rider

[Verse]
These niggas killin' for no fuckin' reason
Run up on 'em, get to fuckin' squeezin'
I got some homies that's no longer breathin'
And I wish they was here
Pull some liquor out for my dogs
And free my niggas that's behind them walls
Niggas facin' life behind them walls
And my 10 year niggas behind them walls

[Hook]
