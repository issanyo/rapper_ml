[Intro:]
She put a choppa to my ear and then she said boy you did
Unless you tell me the truth - where you been last night?
I was with Young Chop cutting tracks in the studio
Aye
You don't believe me though
Aye
She aimin at my temple

[Hook: x2]
Hope n pray, hope n pray
Hold me baby, hope n pray
Hope n pray, hope n pray
When the jet go off, you know let's get away

[Bridge:]
I guess that's why I said someone call 911
'Cause you never miss a good thing til it's gone
The old timers used to tell me
A house is not home unless she's in it but she's tryna kill you

[Verse 1:]
She about to go off
Sound like the kind that's let off
This feels like a bad trip
Demons in my mattress
Now she done let off, tryna take my head off
Should I confess? Or should I let it air out?

[Hook: x2]
Hope n pray, hope n pray
Hold me baby, hope n pray
Hope n pray, hope n pray
When the jet go off, you know let's get away

[Bridge:]
I guess that's why I said someone call 911
'Cause you never miss a good thing til it's gone
The old timers used to tell me
A house is not home unless she's in it but she's tryna kill you

[Verse 2:]
Now she's comin down the block
Go back up, I'm hearin shots
No chips lined, I'm not up for talking
I already know she cold-hearted
I'm tryin to make er take this rose
I rather bury you with guns and roses
She wanna know if I heard er loud and clear
On er mama she swear

[Hook: x2]
Hope n pray, hope n pray
Hold me baby, hope n pray
Hope n pray, hope n pray
When the jet go off, you know let's get away

[Verse 3:]
And when I'm long gone
I'm no longer here
Remember I tried to apologize
But death ears can't hear, no
So the choppa ring oh oh oh oh oh
And my head gave up
And my body got tossed
All in the name of love

[Hook: x2]
Hope n pray, hope n pray
Hold me baby, hope n pray
Hope n pray, hope n pray
When the jet go off, you know let's get away

[Bridge:]
I guess that's why I said someone call 911
'Cause you never miss a good thing til it's gone
The old timers used to tell me
A house is not home unless she's in it but she's tryna kill you
