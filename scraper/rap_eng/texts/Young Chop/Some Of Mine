[Hook][x2]
Some of my niggas be robbing, some of my niggas be shooting
Some of my niggas be juuging, some of my niggas be boosting
Pulling up on a nigga with 30, letting that motherfucker loose
The old folk act like who dat is, I'm a young nigga shooting

[Verse 1]
Pull up on a nigga with them K’s though
A nigga acting tough, we blow his brains out
No need to call for help, [?] that’s a DOA
And if my family starving we gon be okay
I’m quick to rob a nigga for them fucking birdies
Some of my niggas they robbing, some of my niggas they hurting
That’s why, some of my niggas they serving
They posted up right in the trap, they get that shit off and they working
But some of my niggas they really killing
Some of my niggas they really drilling, and drug dealers
But a fuck nigga don’t know nothing
I’m getting them bricks out of customs
I’m treating this shit like back in the day, I’m getting money with my cousins
Motherfucker ain’t even got a memo, motherfucker ain’t even got a clue
Imma pull up on the motherfucking block with my young niggas
Imma tell them niggas shoot
Motherfucker better duck, or get low, or do something
When I pull up with the motherfucking hammers up
Gonna blow, and shoot someone

[Hook]
