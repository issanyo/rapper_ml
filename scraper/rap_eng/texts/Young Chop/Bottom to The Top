(Verse 1:Young Souljah)

(Hook:Young Souljah)
Bottom to the top
Because we can´t be stopped
Started from the bottom now we here

Started from the bottom Now we here
No love for them haters cause they wasn't there
I want it all that´s why everyday I´m ballin
Don´t expect me to fall cause they say i´m all in
Who said that I will never be nothin?
Made something out of nothin why they hatin?
These niggas ain´t supposed to be eatin´
They not real, they Don´t see how I´m living
At the top is where you see us, bossin up with no tie
Now they want us crucified like jesus, no lie
Ain´t got enough time, I´m living to the fullest
Touch mine and I make sure you catch a bullet
I´m on the grind for the Money Power Fame
Rookie of the year, welcome to the game
Started from the trap, now we rockin so much shows
Where I´m at, right now ?these niggas already know

(Hook:Young Souljah)
Bottom to the top
Because we can´t be stopped
Started from the bottom now we here

Bad bitch by my side, cuz she realize I´m winnin
Watch the jaleousy they hide inside, these niggas be trippin
Fake friends, that´s that shit I Don´t like
Make ends, that´s that shit I´m gonna writte
Trust none, cuz what they want is my charachter
Life´s a Bitch but I´m the mac, and I smacked her
I go so hard, I deserve me a grammy
I pray to god,that they nominate the one and only
Fealing like pac right now cuz you know they can´t c me
I be on some other shit and they ain´t ready
Never broke again that´s my Motto
Every time I´m in the store I scream Y.O.L.O

Bottom to the top
Because we can´t be stopped
