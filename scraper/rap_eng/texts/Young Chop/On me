All these hoes...
Keep them racks on me
A pint of act.. quarter pound of ..
On me

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
All these hoes know i keep them racks on me
A pint of act and a quarter pound pack on me
Thots does and the paparazzi all over me
Top drops in the Rari is just me and Bally
Pour up a four, now its time to get leany
These niggas mad at us cuz we doin our thingy - thingy
But i ain't mad at ya, but if you ever need me
Just call my manager, get him to check and he gon be me

[Verse 1: Ballout]
Ive been too busy on the road, its so hard to see me
All these bitches call in Texas, its so hard to reach me
And im getting fat, bitch you know im fuckin greedy
So GDK, bitch you know im so fuckin BD
Glo Gang run the world, bitch we run every city
Listen all, everybody everybody with me
Ridin off on Raris and them Bentleys
And im off Xanax im off lean and i got plenty

Walk up in the club them hoes they run up on me
Racks up in my pocket homie
You know i keep them motherfuckin racks on me

[Chorus: Chief Keef]

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
Out in traffic, i got all these racks on me
A nigga try to take it, know this guy a body
When i hit the club, all these hoes on me
You wanna come to gang - you got to fuck the whole team
Party poppin xans, bitch you know its on me
I can give you 3, put you in the zone b

Glo gang posting in them be the whole team
Posting up with all the Glocks with them big crowns
Got them racks shall we do our thing
Nigga i got 50 shots i got good aim
