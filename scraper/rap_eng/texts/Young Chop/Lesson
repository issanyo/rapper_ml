[Intro]
And we blew his ass down, no lie
Now this go for any nigga that come around

[Verse 1: Y.B.]
And we blew his ass down, no lie
If a nigga tweakin' then we put 'em in the clouds (go)
Tell them bring them macs out
Gotta pack the work soon as it touch down
Now pull em knots out (count up)
All them cats out, got the block goin' wild
I been spending guwala like this for a while (flex)
Never been a problem when a nigga run they mouth
[?] Now I'm bout to blow now
Ride around town with the chopper on my lap
The bitch up in the back she ain’t scared, she relaxed
She know it's finna crack, got the bro up in the back
He told him to mac
Them shots will leave you wet

[Hook: Johnny May Cash]
And we blew his ass down, no lie
Now this go for any nigga that come around
Shot a hundred rounds where your block?
Hope you learned your lesson now
And these niggas like hoes so I let lil bro go shoot 'em down
And we blew his ass down, no lie
Now this go for any nigga that come around
Shot a hundred rounds where your block?
Hope you learned your lesson now
And these niggas like hoes so I let lil bro go shoot 'em down

[Verse 2: Johnny May Cash]
Niggas say they blowing shit but I don't see 'em around (true that)
And we turnt to the max that’s why we can’t turn down
We told 'em fifty shots and we renting macs now
We got Uzis, Choppers, AKs and Tacs now (true that)
We strapped up and I got that roll on me
We catch a body quick nigga and I put that on me
And we standing hard got these diamonds all on me
Just me and my squad getting this guwap
A nigga try me, it’s R.I.P
When you see me with Y.B
Trust that [?], lowkey, with the toaster on the seat
If you come closer you gone see
Them niggas in a jam right now
When you come around we gon blow you down
Got fifty shots, that hundred round gon mow you down yeah

[Hook: Johnny May Cash]
