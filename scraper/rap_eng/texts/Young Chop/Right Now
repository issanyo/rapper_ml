[Intro]
Uhhhhh uhhhhhhhh
Sosa baby, GBE baby, Glo Gang baby
You know how I'm rocking baby
You know they can't stop it baby
Kush in my pocket baby

[Hook]
The feds keep saying I ain't right
They heard I got them chickens and them pies
The judge trying to lock me up right now
Nigga wishing he could give me life
I'm on my way to Paris on a flight now
I'm too gone, I'm in the sky
I got all this fucking guap on me right now
And I don't know why

[Verse 1]
Smoking on this Tooka got me high
I feel I can fall from the sky now
I swear that I'm high and I can't pipe down
I'm rolling with the guys
Try one of us and you get piped down
And then I saw your thot
I took her home then she got piped down
Nigga put down your Glock
You're not a plumber or a shooter, put your pipe down
I'm counting on this guap
While I'm recording on this verse right now

[Hook]
The feds keep saying I ain't right
They heard I got them chickens and them pies
The judge trying to lock me up right now
Nigga wishing he could give me life
I'm on my way to Paris on a flight now
I'm too gone, I'm in the sky
I got all this fucking guap on me right now
And I don't know why

[Verse 2]
The judge trying to lock me up for driving
I should buy a helicopter, lock me up for flying
Lucky I ain't in Chiraq, pull up doing violent drills
But I'm in Cali and bitch I live in the hills
Don't send me back to rehab, your honor
Cause I'mma get out and keep smoking ganja
You trying to send me back to jail, your honor
But I ain't sold dope for three summers
You just don't wanna see me get money
But what I'mma do and keep getting money
The cops shooting us like it's nothing
But if I shoot one of them bitches I'm going under

[Hook]
The feds keep saying I ain't right
They heard I got them chickens and them pies
The judge trying to lock me up right now
Nigga wishing he could give me life
I'm on my way to Paris on a flight now
I'm too gone, I'm in the sky
I got all this fucking guap on me right now
And I don't know why
