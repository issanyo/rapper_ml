[Hook:Fat trel] lets go my scope runway
All my killers about the gun play
I told them we'll be touring one day
From robing bitches killing niggas ;Ok
I just had a long conversation
My bitch say she hate the seperation
I was busy whippin foreign lanes
Them bitches know me by my whole thang

[verse 1: ManeMane 4CGG]
Whole thang
Ima get this money anyday
I dont care what a hater got to say
Counting money,dont care what a bitch say
My old bitch say she hate the seperation
Tour life rocking shows, fucking hoes
I just made like 30 on the road
Johnny dang on my wrist its all gold
Johnny dang on my neck and earlobes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ManeMane 4CGG]
I remember i ain't have no place to stay
Halfway just a 40 in the bank
When i land bitches call me mane mane
If you got money i think you should do the same
Getting head while im switching foreign lanes
Hit the club bitches screamin out my name
Bitches know me i go by mane mane
Im a glo man bitch ain't shit changed

[Hook]
