[Steffy]

Let's get it..

Chorus

Who you kiddin? Stop the actin
You ain't with the shits
Hit the bitch, then I quit
She still on my dick
And I do this shit forreal tryna get a deal
Cause some niggas with a deal dont know how to spill
I be on my shit bitch tryna get it all
Tryna get it all, bitch, tryna get it all
Shorty know I make it rain watch this money fall
Tryna get it all, bitch, tryna get it all

Verse 1 [Steffy]

18, and Im young, still in it
These niggas kinda rusty they ain't did this in a minute
All I know is get money, I get money
I spend it
And if that bitch wet, im like "fuck it"
I'mma swimmer, uh
It's never too much money for a nigga
Bitch you can fuck my nigga I ain't really fuckin witcha
Cause round here we dont love thots
They goin quick, they driller
Round here it's fuck ops, make sure you fuck with hittas
Chiraq, west side, bitch this where I come from
Bitch got that good brain but give a nigga that dumb dumb
Told her keep her body
No sex bitch just all top
Dope Gang, Kill City
We won't stop til we on top
Bitch

Chorus

Who you kiddin? Stop the actin

Tryna get it all, bitch, tryna get it all
Shorty know I make it rain watch this money fall
Tryna get it all, bitch, tryna get it all

Verse 1 [Steffy]

Rest in Peace to Fred
Everybody miss you
And yeah bitch Im too sick
Like a snotty tissue
And I be eatin to the bone
To the fuckin grissle
Me and my team gone take off
Like a fuckin missile
And yeah Im runnin bitch Im headed
For the finish line
Im goin in, goin in like it's dinner time
Been waitin for too long its time to gimme mine
The wait just been too long it's time to gimme show
Third mixtape, this just beginner's luck
Like the way she scream my name
When Im drilling her
Nah, I know exactly what they in it for
But Im heartless I can't really even give a fuck

Chorus

Who you kiddin? Stop the actin
You ain't with the shits
Hit the bitch, then I quit
She still on my dick
And I do this shit forreal tryna get a deal
Cause some niggas with a deal dont know how to spill
I be on my shit bitch tryna get it all
Tryna get it all, bitch, tryna get it all
Shorty know I make it rain watch this money fall
Tryna get it all, bitch, tryna get it all
