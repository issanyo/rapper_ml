[Intro]
Niggas who don't pay me back, that's the shit I don't like
Niggas who don't think they're black AKA they act white
They Oreos, they wear obey you know
They think they get girls, but you know they don't
Money ain't an issue because everybody pays me back
Money doesn't grow on trees, just ask a stinking bank
When I lend you dough, you know I want it back
But you ain't gave it to me, that's how I know you black

[Verse 1]
You say that you got some dough to go to AFC
That's just fake version of KFC
And my niggas know that I say wack jokes
You need to pay me back, because this niggas broke
When I say that I got cheese I mean the dairy product
When I say that I got greens I mean I eat salad
How can you love something which you don't have
I don't love money, so this ain't a stanking ballad
A prince nigga, that's the shit I don't like
A king nigga, that's the shit I don't like
A rich nigga coming up to grab the mic
Then they spit wack bars, that's the shit I don't like
They look like Carlton Cole-like, act like Ashley Cole-like
They bitch look like a bitch but my bitch is Cheryl Cole-like
Dancing on the pole-like, my bitches ain't old-like
From Russia with love, that's a stripper in the cold, right?
Diggers want the gold but the niggers want the fame
And these niggas they don't know what's real so they always fake
So they always take, always make the same mistakes
So I'm handing the note that says, "Watch me overtake"
And this ain't a fucking race but I'm in first, right?
All your fucking pessimism, that's that shit I don't like

[Hook]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
A blik nigga, Akon mixed with Djemba Ba!
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 2]
Fake Vans that's the shit they don't like
But there's nothing wrong with them, they just ain't the real shite
So I grab real mic, show em all what's real, like
They don't have a flow so the flow they have steal, like
Status on FB, like. Twittering RT's, like
She sent me a DM that said, "Come and meet me
"By that tree on the green and I'll show you what I mean by
"Excuse my French kissing, kiss the tongue that underneath"
Kiss my arse it isn't sweet, kiss the dirt it isn't clean
They say my flow is dirty, well I spit it how I see it
And you'll see me crip walkin', but I ain't a paraplegic
I see you talking bullshit, you're such a f...ing idiot!

[Hook]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 3]
I'm dropping the beats like the rain, I'm fly like a plane
Nigga I'm fucking insane
I'm saying The Pussycat Dolls are insane but man
Scherzinger want's so bad, damn!
I don't want beef with her man but man
Ducking out's never a plan
You would understand if you're my biggest fan
That the mountain plan is falling in place, ace
Star predictions in grades
I'm seeing what I'm never seeing again
I'm beginning to wonder whether it's waste of my time
But fuck it I'll kill it again
I'm a beast
You niggas are just lion cubs
I'm rolling with my wolfgang
Predatory gaeno love

[Hook]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
