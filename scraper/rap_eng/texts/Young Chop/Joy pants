She died, she left
Finally I can be as I really am
I'll be like "Wow" wow
In my voice the emotion is perceived


I move my hair and smile
I write that I am happy

Everyone allows me to be
I listen to "JAPAN"

I'll be like "Wow" wow
I move my hair and smile
I write that I am happy

I move my head with joy
I move my body like yesterday

I move my hair and smile
I write that I am happy

Everyone allows me to be
I listen to "JAPAN"

I'll be like "Wow" wow
I move my hair and smile
I write that I am happy

I move my head with joy
I move my body like yesterday

I'm going to shout "WOW" do it now

Come girl that you had a good time
Well you will spend it with me
