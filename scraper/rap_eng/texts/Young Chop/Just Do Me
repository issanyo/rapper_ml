I just do me, pull up in that oohwee
I just do me, pull up in that oohwee
I just do me, pull up in that oohwee
Roll the window down, shots firing
Steady stalking me, these bitches steady stalking me
Steady listening, these bitches steady listening
I got money on my mind, all my trap be boomin'
I got money on my mind, all my trap be boomin'

[Verse 1]
Walk up in the bank and ask for 10 thousand in cash
I need that shit in all 100s, put that shit in brown bags
Kept that, all I spend was 10 pairs of shoes man
1500 for these fucking red's man
13 bitches in my bed, ain't counting
Bitches sucking pussy, bitches give me head then
In the jug, yeah I'm on my red fire shit
Watching TV, I'm on my TV shit yeah
Watching good times, yes I'm from the projects bitch
I be in the trap out the gun shit
Hop up on a nigga, fire shit
You a goofy ass nigga and we noticed it

[Hook]
I just do me, pull up in that oohwee
I just do me, pull up in that oohwee

Roll the window down, fire shots like [?]
Steady stalking me, these bitches steady stalking me
Steady listening, these bitches steady listening

I got money on my mind, I'm not tryna be [?]

[Verse 2]
223, get the clear out the block and shit
You with the ops so I know you with that set up shit
All my guns from overseas, they come from Russia bitch
Killed another fucking witness and the judge bitch
All these niggas talking 'bout their D and this and this
I dunno what they talking 'bout but I don't do shit
When them niggas see me, they gon' be shitting bricks
Only niggas talking money, boy you counterfeit
I heard about them fake hundreds, you tryna give my clique
And when shots get to find, your ass gon' get hit
Dread head monster, on some savage shit
I'm gorilla in the jungle, on some wild shit

[Hook]
I just do me, pull up in that oohwee
I just do me, pull up in that oohwee
I just do me, pull up in that oohwee
Roll the window down, fire shots like [?]
Steady stalking me, these bitches steady stalking me
Steady listening, these bitches steady listening
I got money on my mind, I'm not tryna be [?]
I got money on my mind, I'm not tryna be [?]
