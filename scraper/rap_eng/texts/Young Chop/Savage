[Hook]
Young living savage
For that bread I gotta have it
The top I gotta have it
Young living savage
300, we so savage
GBE, we so savage
OTF, we so savage
Young living savage

[Verse 1]
I smoke kush, I'm an addict
Young living savage
My niggas know we got it
My bitches be attractive
Riding with that ratchet
Hunting for that cabbage
My young niggas clapping
Number 5, bitch they clapping
Don't try me, it'll happen
I'm totin' you don't know I got it
Young living savage
I'm totin' you don't know I got it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I be toting 30's
Me and my niggas thirsty
We out here, bitch we lurking
Cash out , bitch we splurging
I'm balling, Julius Erving
Fast lane, I'm swerving
Fucked up and I know it
Your bitch knows she going
Reckless and you know it
If I got it, I'm gonna blow it
Bands on Bands, I blow it
I'm flexing, got her going

[Hook]
