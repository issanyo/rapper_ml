[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
I'm T'd up (damn, ayy)
I didn't see no speedbump (stop playin', yo, ayy)
I T'd off (hit it, yeah)
Dropped the top and screeched off (skrrt, hey)
They-they ticked off (they mad, ticked off)
They ticked off (my bad, woo)
We T'd up (T'd up, no)
I T'd up (woo, woo)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
I'm so fresh I need a fuckin' lint brush
I don't want the truck if it ain't lifted up
Drink so fast, I just done got the hiccups (hic, hic, hic)
Took her shoppin', she think I'm the shoe plug
Come back from the dead, I feel like Frankenstein
Five chains on my neck and they got hangtime (yeah, yeah)
Niggas rap, but they don't even stay around
Rollin' weed and baby, yes, I hang glide
Bring in them hundreds, end of discussion (crush it)
Bad chick blushin', turbo bustin' (giddy up, giddy up)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
I'm T'd up (damn)
I didn't see no speedbump (stop playin', yo, ayy)
I T'd off (hit it, yeah)
Dropped the top and screeched off (skrrt, hey)
They-they ticked off (they mad, ticked off)
They ticked off (my bad, woo)
We T'd up (T'd up, no, ayy)
I T'd up (woo, woo, ayy, woo)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Snakes on me, I'm G'd (G'd), in every way, I'm T'd
These girls comin' in teams, we drinkin' CÃŽROC, not lean (not lean)
Young niggas so hot like steam, can't go out sad, not me (not me)
Colorblind, I'm seein' blue-green, blue-green? Blue-green (green)
Blue flame and I tip like kings (like kings)
Car got wings, car got speed (got speed)
Roll up by the P, I'm T'd (I'm T'd)
EarDrummers, one time, what it do?
Dripset, O.D (O.D), gimme room like a nigga obese (obese)
I'm iced up, 1017 (yeah), M.O.B. need M.O.E
Big boss, Bruce Lee, aye, Jxmmi (Jxmmi)
T'd up like a nigga ten feet
T'd up, I ain't never on E (the hits)
Young nigga out the S-S-I-P (SIP)
Yeah countin' money, not sheep (no sleep)
Took off and the paint KD (yeah), now clap for the M.V.P
(Sremm, Sremm)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
I'm T'd up (damn)
I didn't see no speedbump (stop playin', yo, ayy)
I T'd off (hit it, yeah)
Dropped the top and screeched off (skrrt, hey)
They-they ticked off (they mad, ticked off)
They ticked off (my bad, woo)
We T'd up (T'd up, no)
I T'd up (woo, woo)

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Overachiever, had to let my seat up
Had to tell that girl that it was a one on one
In the spot, she on the bus, at the bank, I'm in a rush
And she followin' me, I'm like no wonder
We should hop off choppers since we got sleeved up
Both my arms, they freeze cuts (freeze cuts)
Late night and it's gettin' so uncut
These girls, they don't tease us
I let the cash go, I leave a wet floor
I'm in the Enzo, still a no flex zone (flex zone)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
I'm T'd up (damn, yeah)
I didn't see no speedbump (stop playin', yo, ayy)
I T'd off (hit it, yeah)
Dropped the top and screeched off (skrrt, hey)
They-they ticked off (they mad, yeah, ticked off)
They ticked off (my bad, yeah, woo)
We T'd up (T'd up, no)
I T'd up (yeah, woo, woo)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Yeah
Yeah
