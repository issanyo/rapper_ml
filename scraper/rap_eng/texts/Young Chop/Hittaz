[Hook: S.Dot]
All my niggas hittaz we'll line you up
Don't be lacking out in traffic we'll fire you up
Choppa shoot a hundred that bitch loud as fuck
30 in that 40 man I try em up
Roll up the dope, bitch I'm high as fuck
My shorties with the shits, they gon ride with us
Don't be lacking out in traffic we'll fire you up
All my niggas hittaz we'll line you up

[Verse 1: S.Dot]
All my niggas hittaz better stand down
Catch you lacking and I guarantee its a man down
Rollin off a yappa and a ?
Lil bro got the 30, shorties with the shits
We gon send some shots, hollow bullets hot
She know I'm 600 so she give me top
And If opposition, I'mma hit em up
And bitch it's OTF, they gon drill with us
Do a drill in that black car
Hour a later back counting money
Riding 'round in that black Audi, know I got that hammer on me
Extendo's in the Glocks, two macs, 50 shots
Talk crazy, fire em up
My hitters with me, line em up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Duke Da Beast]
If you owe me and don't pay, I'mma tie you up
Treat you like the dope, fire you up
In yo block up, leave it dry as fuck
When them Glocks buss, better hide and duck
All my shorties with it, yeah they wild as fuck
Fuck the other side, fuck who don't ride with us
Make ? these rap niggas got it crowded up
Smoking on this packie out, this shit is loud as fuck
Think it's a game and fuck nigga I'mma paint you up
Turn your white tee red, I'll stain you up
Think it's a game fuck nigga and I aim and buss
Them bullets bang, get you changed
They know gangs with us
