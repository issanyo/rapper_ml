[Hook]
Mix them old hunnit's with them new hunnit's shit
Riding down your block, nigga that's what you wanted
And we swoop around nigga, drop you and your mans
Smoke a blunt and forget you
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man

[Verse 1]
Twenty thou' on my Rollie I got my time up
Niggas hating nigga you better step your grind up
Forty on me nigga I got that fucking choppa'
Ay, what you niggas really wanna' do?
Cause my niggas wilding in the fucking zoo
Got them oranges, got bananas, what you wanna' do?
And you niggas pussy anyway, who the fuck is you?
I don't really have a clue nigga, who the fuck is you?
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop nigga police coming through
Had the work, stuffed the work in the motherfucking shoe
All these niggas goofy, capping niggas snitching on the crew
Do a hunnid' years for some shit you ain't even do

[Hook]
Mix them old hunnit's with them new hunnit's shit
Riding down your block, nigga that's what you wanted
And we swoop around nigga, drop you and your mans
Smoke a blunt and forget you
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man

[Verse 2]
Fuck these niggas and their feelings I don't give a fuck about them
I will run up on their ass with the motherfucking choppa'
You a pussy ass nigga and I knew it anyway
I'll shoot your fucking pussy ass any day
And that money you owe me, nigga I need it anyway
What the fuck you telling me? You ain't got my money?
Pussy nigga run it back, run it back, run it back, run it back, run it back, run it, run it, run it back

[Hook]
Mix them old hunnit's with them new hunnit's shit
Riding down your block, nigga that's what you wanted
And we swoop around nigga, drop you and your mans
Smoke a blunt and forget you
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
I just smoked a whole pound of the gas man
