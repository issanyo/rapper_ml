[Chorus, Young Chop]
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans
.40 stuffed in my jeans
.40 stuffed in my jeans
Niggas tryna ride the wave
Niggas tryna ride the wave

[Verse 1, Young Chop]
Spent like 20k
On this Johnny Dang
Niggas be steady flexin
But they ain't getting money my mane
Niggas ain't getting no change
Pull on you flexing with that thang
Pull up on side of your bitch
Flexing a new fucking Range

I got the dope I got the coke I got whatever you want
Pull up on you, let me blow, I got [?] smoke
Surfboard, Surfboard, Surfboard, Surfboard, Surfboard
And my life so god damn gnarly I just ride up on a surfboard

[Chorus, Young Chop]
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans
.40 stuffed in my jeans

Niggas tryna ride the wave
Niggas tryna ride the wave

[Verse 2]
Ay, this bitch all on my dick she want to get high today
I ain't got a lot bitch keep it 100 I know you want to ride the wave
I ain't got a lot nigga keep it 100 or you want to die today
Nigga taking my money, I swear to god your momma gonna cry today
It's a homicide today
And my niggas they gon ride the wave
It's a homicide today
And my niggas they gon ride the wave

[Chorus, Young Chop]
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans
Niggas tryna ride the wave

[Verse 2]
I'm running right through the bands
So it ain't much as they can say
You only do what you can
I do what I want everyday
.40 stuffed in my jeans
Niggas be riding the wave
Nigga get put in a grave
Really they be in the way

We was just broke
I'm gonna remember them days, remember them days
No, I never rode the wave
I stayed down with my niggas, ay
That's why these niggas don't get guap today

[Chorus, Young Chop]
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans

Niggas tryna ride the wave
Niggas tryna ride the wave

[Verse 3]
Yeah I just popped this bean
Niggas trying to get it like me
Niggas tryna ride the wave
He gon fuck around and see
Young nigga, I stay with the 'nin
Bank roll in my true religion jeans
Me and Chop gonna ball like Kareem
Sipping on that straight codeine
Niggas tryna ride the wave
Fuck 'round and die today
Don't play with my money nigga

Bitch I'm not scared to die
Just like I'm johnny mane [?]
These niggas gonna act like your homies
But watch how they change with the fame

[Chorus, Young Chop]
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans
Niggas tryna ride the wave
.40 stuffed in my jeans
.40 stuffed in my jeans
.40 stuffed in my jeans
Niggas tryna ride the wave
Niggas tryna ride the wave
