[Intro: RĀLÏ]
Fuck your girl
Fuck your girl
Fuck your girl
Fuck your girl

[Hook: RĀLÏ]
Fuck your girl and take her out (take her out)
She blow me right on the couch (on the couch)
Give her D till she tap out (she loves me)
Then fall asleep like Pacquiao (send her home)

Rolling blunts and smoking bud (this my song)
(Smoke bud)
Rolling blunts and smoking bud (get my bong)
(Smoke bud)
Smoking bud and rolling blunts
(Smoke bud)
I can never do enough

[Verse I: RĀLÏ]
Wake me up when I blow up
That was fast
About my cash
I'm in first place, you in last
Test drove your bitch, now you crashed

“Oh my goodness, Lï's so stupid”
“I knew that I wouldn't like his music”
“All he talks about is being the coolest”
You would too, bitch, if you knew how to do this

I got classics
You don't have shit
Hits on DatPiff
Don't forget that

She said whip that
So I whipped that
Hit from the back
She got Whiplash

Flow is Iraq
But I'm from Chiraq
So I don't mind when niggas violent
You talk that tough shit, but back up nothing
You come to my hood, you leave out running

On the totem pole
You are far below
Ice'll make it snow
34° below

I break all the rules
Stay above the law
So when I get the call
You know all I'm doing is

[Hook: RĀLÏ]
Smoking bud and rolling blunts (smoke bud)
Rolling blunts and smoking bud (smoke bud)
Smoking bud and rolling blunts (smoke bud)
I can never do enough

You equals straight estrogen
Lï equals ESPN
We ball hard, like Medicine
You ball soft, like retinas

[Verse II: RĀLÏ]
Wake me up when I blow up
“No Habla Hoe”, back the fuck up!
I'm on a roll, dice and oars
Rewind this if you didn't get that part

Okay
Put a little bit of soul in the mixture
Get a taste and a bowl of dro, it'll fix her
The way I cleaned your ex
You might wanna grab a tissue
Kill the game, put a toe tag on a rap beat
Got a couple bad freaks in the backseat
“Lï how you get so raw?”, what they ask me
Cause I'm on my grind like bad teeth

Cash rules everything around me
Walk right into the club, don't even need my I.D
Seen a bitch in leopard tights
Looking kinda feisty
And I'm a Leo
And Lï's on
Like a lion
She can lie on my dick!

[Bridge, Part I: RĀLÏ]
Smoking bud and rolling blunts (smoke bud)
Rolling blunts and smoking buds (roll up)
Smoking bud and rolling blunts (oh yeah)
I can never do enough

[Unison: RĀLÏ]
(Smoke) (Smoke) (Smoke) (Smoke)
(Smoke) (Smoke) (Smoke) (Smoke)
(Smoke bud)
(Oooooo)

[Bridge, Part II: RĀLÏ]
And this is brought to you by a motherfucking star in the making
A motherfucking star in the making
A motherfucking star in the making
Bitch!

[Hook: RĀLÏ]
Rolling blunts and smoking bud
(Smoke bud)
Rolling blunts and smoking bud
(Smoke bud)
Smoking bud and rolling blunts
(Smoke bud)
I can never do enough

Fuck your girl and take her out
She blow me right on the couch
Give her D till she tap out
Then fall asleep like Pacquiao

[Breakdown: RĀLÏ]
Then I ball on yo bitch ass
So I, so I, so I
So watch me ball on yo bitch ass
Watch me, so I, so I
Watch me, so I, so I, watch me
So I, so I, watch me
So I, so I, so I, watch me
So I, so I, watch me
So I, so I, so I, watch me
So I, so I, so I ball on yo bitch ass

[Outro: RĀLÏ]
Watch me
Watch me (watch me, watch me)
Watch me (watch me, watch me, watch me)
Watch me (watch me, watch me, watch me)
Watch me (watch me, watch me, watch me)
Watch me (watch me, watch me, watch me)
Watch me (watch me, watch me, watch me)
Watch me ball on yo bitch ass
