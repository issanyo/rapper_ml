[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I just seen the baddest bitch
She wanted cash, but me wasn’t havin' it
She know I’m ballin like the Mavericks
Smash then tune is to whom I pass it
Vegetable face, she in love with cabbage
It's in her blood, she ain't gotta practice
Everything designer, no styling
My girl look like she grew up in a island
My niggas here they be wilding and wilding
My mulah keep pilin'
With me baby, you can go far
She say Spenzo you're goin' too far

[Chorus]
I can never wife her
Only one night her
Women full of lies
I just fuck em then pass 'em to my guys
I can never wife her
Only one night her
Women full of lies
I just fuck em then pass 'em to my guys

[Verse 2]
I live for today, motherfuck tomorrow
We at the top nigga ,where the fuck is y'all?
I’m so high I ain’t coming back tomorrow
Rich Crew shit, we finna go national
Baby girl I done heard it all
Fuck that shit, let me see you take it off
'Cause tonight from work I'm takin' all
Word around town, kid Spenz takin' off
With bitches me got trust issues
Especially when they say I miss you
When I know they ass lyin'
Fuck that shit bitch, I know your ass lyin'

[Chorus]
I can never wife her
Only one night her
Women full of lies
I just fuck em then pass 'em to my guys
I can never wife her
Only one night her
Women full of lies
I just fuck em then pass 'em to my guys
