[Intro]
She say you be stunting bitch that's every day
She wanna chill with Sosa but not every day
Every day, every day, every day
She wanna chill with Sosa but not every day

[Verse 1]
I be smoking dope shit, that's every day
3hunna swole, bitch we be up in the place
Don't care what you say, shit that's every day
Sosa always with this nigga shit, that's every day
Can't compare to I, cause I'm hot as fuck
I'm buying foreign cars and some tonka trucks
No snitching boy we light you up
Shoot them bullets, ain't nobody hot as us
I'm a Leo but my fucking birthday every day
Hope I be at the awards fucking Mary Kate
I'm a Leo but my fucking birthday every day
Hope I be at the awards fucking Mary Kate

[Hook]
She say you be stunting, bitch that's every day
All my money go on dope, shit that's every day
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day
Fuck on any nigga bitch, shit that's every day
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day

[Verse 2]
OTF, bitch I rep that shit like every day
GBE, bitch I rep that shit like every day
If you think it's chicken then its bombs away
Ringing down your block, make you run away
Man I get so high I can't pronounciate
Run up in your house where your money safe
We be making moves, shit that's every day
I don't stack money, I spend it in every way
Damn, all this money on my landline
Up all day, bitch we don't sleep we vampires
40 on my hip, click clack then fire
We don't do this everyday, you's a damn liar

[Hook]
She say you be stunting, bitch that's every day
All my money go on dope, shit that's every day
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day
Fuck on any nigga bitch, shit that's every day
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day
