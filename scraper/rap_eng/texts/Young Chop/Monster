[Hook]
Can't trust every face bitch you gotta watch em
Never trust a bitch shit you gotta watch em
We just do our thing and the feds watchin'
All we do is turn up, we some damn monsters
Can't trust every face bitch you gotta watch em
Never trust a bitch shit you gotta watch em
We just do our thing and the feds watchin'
All we do is turn up, we some damn monsters

[Verse 1]
Can't trust every face shit I gotta watch em
Chief Keef, Sosa I'm a known topic
Smokin' big blunts in a long body
My niggas hard body, don't fear nobody
We be in the club bitches so excited
But we don't give them nothin' but some long pipe
Because we don't trust her with her mouth die tonight
We don't trust niggas, get out my sight
Folk ‘nem poppin’ pills and they startin' fights
Trust none muhfucka alright
Folk ‘nem poppin’ pills and they startin' fights
Trust none muhfucka alright

All we do is turn up, we some damn monsters
Can't trust every face bitch you gotta watch em
Never trust a bitch shit you gotta watch em
We just do our thing and the feds watchin'

[Verse 2]
Sosa bitch a lot of niggas don't like
But I don't give a fuck, that's alright
Because I'mma do me and take all light
Put your glasses on I'm comin' strong ight
Gotta get this bread for my newborn (KayKay)
I'm a fuckin' monster with some trues on
In this shit, I done waited too long
Two face niggas, call em two tones
We just do our thang and the feds watchin
Snitch niggas makin us the feds topic
We just do our thang and the feds watchin
Snitch niggas makin us the feds topic

Never trust a bitch shit you gotta watch em
We just do our thing and the feds watchin'
All we do is turn up, we some damn monsters
Can't trust every face bitch you gotta watch em
