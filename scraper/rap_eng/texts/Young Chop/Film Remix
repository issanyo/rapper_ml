I'm bout' to make a movie; Wolf of wall Street
Coke on the pussy while she sucking off me
Got a couple jump offs in the lobby
Pints of the Act with the blue Frosties

All I remember was shots of that clear
Her hand in my lap, Mind on my millions
She jockin' my whip so we fuck in my Benz
Whole pound of that loud

You niggas be pushin' the start
I tell my driver to take the month off
Google bitch
I got whips that can drive themselves
Pull out right beside ya
Hangin' out the window like Macgyver
There won't be no survivors
Then I fly back to the island
To finish my drank
I got models everywhere
Tryna swallow everywhere and get fucked in the face
I turn the cameras on what you niggas would think
You fall in love with that hoe on the ground
I throw orgies with bitches with Oscars
Maybe a Grammy
You niggas watch how I live
You niggas is nanny, film

Bout to shoot a film like Spike Lee
But I can never do the right thing

And I got Coco like Ice T
Last night shot a film with your wifey
But I'm all about a check like Nike
Nigga hot got my wrists all icey

I am the one in the mask
Sliding on you and your mans
Your other bitch you don't have a chance
You can't get out of the gym
My bodies be over bands
You do this shit for the fans
You do this shit for the fame
I'm in the kitchen with grams
I'm tryna whip me a Range
Im tryna hit me a stain
Uh, slide through the hood with no tint
Uh, hoes on the block can get banned
My cup cost me more than my rent
My blunt got me more than your bitch
That bitch could help me get rich
I know this desire more [?]
I'm tryna shoot me a film
