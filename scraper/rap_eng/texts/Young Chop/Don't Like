[Hook 1]
A fuck boy, that's the shit I don't like
Almond Joys, that's the shit I don't like
Candy Corn, that's the shit I don't like
Being bored, that's the shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like
Being white, that's the shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like
Doing laundry, that's the shit I don't like

[Verse 1]
Big nipples, that's the shit I don't like
I can't rap, that's just a stereotype
Let me put this penis in your windpipe
I'm not hungry, no I don't have an appetite
When I wanna travel, I just hitchhike
I didn't write this shit, no I didn't write
When I go to bars, I get a Bud Light
She just looked at my dick, she's cockeyed
When I'm snowed in, I might get frostbite
Just like Snowden, I might extradite
Do not make fun of me cause I'm white
No Michael Vick, but dawg we might fight

[Hook 2]
Wearing condoms, that's the shit I don't like
Miley Cyrus' ass, that's the shit I don't like
Bein' out of cash, that's the shit I don't like
Eatin' ass, that's the shit you do like
Do like, do like
Gettin' high, that's the shit I don't like
I ain't about that life, I ain't about that life
Doin' homework, that's the shit I don't like

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna jizz everywhere, like Danny McBride
You're a dick AND a pussy, you're a hermaphrodite
I'm ashamed of what I've done for a Klondike
She's a racist lesbian; a Klan dyke
Dude, you're a bitch; transvestite
I get lots of women, you get lots of guys
I can't afford a car, I can't afford a bike
She said I look gay, that's the shit I don't like
You ain't hard, you're actin... Dick Van Dyke
Cunt, car, straight... dick, van, dyke
Those were antonyms, that was genius right?
I'm a dope rapper, I got dope rhymes

[Hook 3]
Freestylin', that's the shit I do like
Profilin', that's the shit the cops like
Pedophilin', that's the shit the creeps like
I'm smilin', cause I fuckin love my life
Love my life, love my life
Songs about my ex, that's the shit I won't write
Won't write, won't write
Staying on the same flow, that's the shit I don't do

[Verse 3]
Bitch!
Yeah, I'm just spittin yo, call me a llama
She be sucking my banana, yes I'm talkin 'bout yo momma
And I don't be actin, I ain't with that drama
I ain't with that math, but she with my ruler, no Obama
Yeah, I just be with ya chick
For my dick she's desperate, wants me to beat it like Rihanna
Yeah, I be spitting to some Sosa
Got yo dame like Notre, talk to her like Oprah
Yaaaah, got 2 Chainz on the fuckin' record
For the mothafuckin' record, yo girl want me to undress her
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Points to her cunt and says have it, yo girl be actin rachet
But you know I'm gonna tap it
AHHHHHHH!

[Hook 3]
This song, that's the shit I don't like
My dong, that's the dick yo bitch like
Her thong, that's the fabrics that I like
Hong Kong, that's the continent I like
Do like, do like
Hong Kong's a city? Sorry, I'm not that bright
That bright, that bright
Yo girlfriends titties, that's the tits I do like

[Outro]
I know that this mixtape you didn't like
Some songs I didn't freestyle
Some songs I didn't write
Some songs were fucking great
Some songs were just iight
Bet you wish it would've ended with something better than Don't Like
I just really wanted to spit some Chief Keef shit
So I guess I gotta hit you bitches with that remix...
