[Hook]:
This strangers looking at me like they know some (like they know some)
Pull one to they face call it shotgun (call it shotgun)
BOM Net. killin' every track son (every track son)
All around the globe sing the anthem (sing the anthem)
Reppin this throne with my martians (with my martians)
Don't cross the line marked caution (marked caution)
Youngin see me workin like a monsta' (like a monsta')
Who these strangers I don't know dem (I don't know dem)

[Verse 1]:
Confused, im Mr. Complex
Whole world stuck in a duplex
Don't challenge me your not next
I stay strong with my team, what that mean, flex?
Your in the sideline im playing defense
Don't play like Eli, football got me tense
Charaged up with lots of energy
Enyzmes that mean I use protein
Im healthy, ready for the final match
Yo, watch me win this like a quarterback
You'll never get your money back
My money lonegr than a month
You be a cornerback, uhh!
