Super Smash Bros Ultimate
It's great

[Verse 1: Jon247]
Fighting up villains in a tournament
I had to be other characters like I'm Pichu
Since I was a fan since 2014 and now he did it
And they put everyone in it now
And a couple rumors didn't get in it
There been more Amiibos then ever!
{Hey!}

[Verse 2: Lil Zac]
I got cross over lot
And we got newcomers beating police
Now we are the best rappers in this thing like I'm a savior
I want myself to let every other rumor character in that game could win
But now Jesus save me from being hit from Baldi's ruler
Baldi strong enough to get us then to go away
{We be having fireworks in Memorial}
247 like I'm saying (woo!)
