[Chorus: Young Chop & YB]
Trappin', forty K for fashion
A hundred K for jewels, VVS diamonds
Look what you made me do, I'm dripping Fiji fool
Say she don't wanna move, ayy, we gon' make you move
Pop a bean then I take off, ayy
Pop a bean then I take off, ayy
Got a lot of cash so it can't fold
Got a lot of cash so it can't fold
I smoke so much dope, bitch I can't move
I'm rocking Yeezy baby, this ain't Jimmy Choos
You say you love me baby, I don't love you
I'm riding on Ocean so I had to drop the roof

[Verse 1: YB]
Ayy, I'ma drop the roof, I'ma act a fool
Label wonder what I want to do
Baby me and you, we can get a room
Money man so I understand all these niggas
Gon' keep hating ass, then they turn to fans, shit be crazy

[Chorus: Young Chop & YB]
Trappin', forty K for fashion
A hundred K for jewels, VVS diamonds
Look what you made me do, I'm dripping Fiji fool
Say she don't wanna move, ayy, we gon' make you move
Pop a bean then I take off, ayy
Pop a bean then I take off, ayy
Got a lot of cash so it can't fold
Got a lot of cash so it can't fold
I smoke so much dope, bitch I can't move
I'm rocking Yeezy baby, this ain't Jimmy Choos
You say you love me baby, I don't love you
I'm riding on Ocean so I had to drop the roof

[Verse 2: YB & Young Chop]
Ayy, cuff her, we pass her, forty K for fashion
Windows down we blasting, these niggas they be acting
These niggas they need practice, these niggas don't be cashing
Do it all for these bitches, when they really be laughing
These niggas be really acting, use a bitch for distraction
Shoot a nigga dead in his face, that's a closed casket
What you in, that's Gucci, that's a Gucci knockoff
All my diamonds cost boy, they come straight from Icebox
You don't wanna move, we gon' make a move
He gon' fuck around, end up on the news
In traffic with the tool, no lacking, better not snooze
Shoot bro then you gon' lose, they gon' blow you out the roof

[Chorus: Young Chop & YB]
I smoke so much dope, bitch I can't move
I'm rocking Yeezy baby, this ain't Jimmy Choos
You say you love me baby, I don't love you
I'm riding on Ocean so I had to drop the roof
Pop a bean then I take off, ayy
Pop a bean then I take off, ayy
Got a lot of cash so it can't fold
Got a lot of cash so it can't fold
