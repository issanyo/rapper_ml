[Hook: D.Flores]
I'll let it blow (x2)
You talkin' about my money, I'mma let it blow
I'll let it blow (x2)
Nigga disrespect me, I'mma let it blow
I'ma let it blow (x2)
Nigga play with me, I'mma let it blow
I'll let it blow (x2)
All of my niggas aim, I'll let them go

[Verse 1: D.Flores]
A nigga play with me, I'mma let it go
Smilin' in my face, until my cash be close
Niggas say they love you, man they hate the most
Them niggas say they love you, man they hate the most
Cut a lot of niggas off, ain't no room for snakes
Everyday my birthday, I won't slice the cake
Stacks On Deck tatted on my face
The fans know who's real, and the ones who's fake
You talk about me, watch what you say
Shoot him in the head, put him in the lake
The fans know I'm real, watch what you say
You talk about me, nigga dig your grave

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Chief Keef]
We smoke 'em out, you ain't smoke what I smoke (it's the killswitch)
A opp in my lane, and I know when to kill a bitch
This bitch on twitter subtweetin', but you in my hills bitch
Just got a house in Beverly, call it my hills bitch
I'm high off this earth, I'm off Shondale shit
These niggas claim insane, just don't get killed bitch
Get your ass smoked, screamin' out "die L'z" bitch
And I ain't got no shit, nigga I melt shit
60,000 in my home, and that was a lil bit
You niggas ain't even got more money than my lil bitch
Spook when you see me yall some lil bitches
My nigga, I can sign you if you worth that meal ticket (with the Glo)
