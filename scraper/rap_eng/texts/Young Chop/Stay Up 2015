[Verse]
I got the smoke if you rolling I'm rolling, we bout to be lit in this bitch
Niggas is talking, they act like they know but they ain't on my shit
Hold up this shit it ain't got me on my level
I'm raging I barely make sense when I'm speaking
But never pass out I don't slip up my nigga
You tweaking on money I'm plotting I'm eating
I don't know why it's so easy man I don't know
See what it felt like to win and I wanted more
Popped up, I'm all on the scene, you already know
I heard that the world is mine, nigga I'm on my own
2 years ago I said I'll be that nigga
2 years of grinding, decided to get it
Started this EP, I finally finished
And Reebok they send me them boxes, I filled this
Started out as a youngin' then a nigga went and got his weight up
Made my own way while you niggas was sleeping I'm now finna wait up
Ask for a beat this time around and my price fuck around and go way up
Dad like that boy he headed straight for the top
I'm like this nigga here, he gon' stay up
[?] reach man the sky ain't the limit boy I'm really in it
Act like they know me but nobody see me, boy my shit is tinted
4am lost in my thought man the boy gotta eat, man I gotta go get it
Already dead if you don't put up a fight, tell me what's the difference
Already dead when that weed hit my soul, I got ash on my denim
Damn, conversations bout the coldest in my city, you wasn't in it
Sunlight hit me and I'm glowing these niggas, I got good intentions
Addicted to shining and rhyming cause that's just the way I be living
Fly as fuck when you see me here in the cut, I decided to [?]
To smoke on the shit I be smoking on the daily boy that is way out your budget
Numbers went up they act like they don't see me
I tried to be friendly but fuck it
20 and living my life how I want it's been fuckin' ironic
The whole world I want it

[Outro] (x2)
I feel like I'm royal, all this gold upon me, take it to the dirt
Asking for a freebie, nigga you can't see me, that shit is the worst
Is you tryna eat, cause I'm tryna get it, tell me what it's worth
Started from nothing, I stretched it for miles, I made that shit worth
