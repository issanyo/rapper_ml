[Hook: Vic Mensa]
Ice water, call it young nigga like Wu Tang for that C.R.E.A.M
Pissin' on the PJ, I put jolly ranchers all in that lean, my nigga
Goddamn, I don't know where y'all from, I'm right here
On them Southside Chicago streets
Turned a dream to a nightmare like Jay
Chasin' this paper I'm down for the caper
Chasin' this paper I'm down for the caper
You a stain put a clip to his head, get the taper
Chasin' this paper I'm down for the caper

[Verse 1: Young Chop (Vic Mensa)]
My niggas pull up, them drivebys, hit a nigga four times with the pistol (Around my way)
And we tapin' shit up nigga,  and I ain't talkin' 'bout clips (Around my way)
When this shit get hectic, I'mma slap him with the pistol (Around my way)
With the mask on my face, hit a nigga with the K (Around my way)
I ran off with the work, niggas mad, had to finesse 'em
Lil nigga talkin' all that shit so I had to blast 'em
And my lil niggas holdin' it down so you gotta respect it
Gotta, gotta respect it, gotta, gotta respect it

[Pre-Hook: Vic Mensa]
All my nigga with the shits around my way
Get hit with the 40. around my way
Pour lean by the pints around my way
Around my way, around my way
Around my way

[Verse 2: King 100 James]
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, wait
Niggas get killed everyday, so I sip lean everyday
Pull up at your funeral with a choppa and bouquet
Postin' instagram pics, na bitch, I know how you stay
My killas, they down to ride, bullets hit him in his face
Sippin' on lean that's that muddy, muddy, muddy, nigga we love it
Tryna take my money, can't get none of it, shoot up in public
Cookin' that dope real good, got that bitch fresh out the oven
Nah bitch iâ€™ve been in the hood, finessin' and juggin' is nothin'

[Pre-Hook: Vic Mensa]
All my nigga with the shits around my way
Get hit with the 40. around my way
Pour lean by the pints around my way
Around my way, around my way
