INTRO:J Swizz & iRich
These Bitches Love Swizzle (Yep)
And That southern nigga
And that nigga paper

Paperchazer verse 1:
Paper chazer nigga swizz what happenin'
I don't love these bitches and I don't
Trust these niggas cause a nigga from
A hood where everybody toting pistols
My niggas was some killers my pops
Was a dealer and up my fucking hood
Best believe you get your issue
Shoutout to jimmy jone cuz my
Nigga finally home my niggas
On probation but they still be
Packing crome got a blunt full
Of loud so the nigga smoking
Strong got a couple bad bitches
And the pictures to my phone
I'm strapped with a fo'fo'
So free my nigga dolo.....

Chorus: J Swizz
These bitches love swizzle cuz
I keep it real doe
And I blow them swishers

And I'm with my niggas and
We pull them triggers

Feet under I'm not no shooter
