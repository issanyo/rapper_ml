[Chorus: Johnny May Cash]
And once I touch some M's, I ain’t never gone change
I’ma still splurge with my squad, we gon' stay fucking all these broads
Niggas wasn’t loyal from the start, niggas mad 'cause we made it this far
A lot of niggas say they real but niggas ain’t who they are
And once I touch some M's, I ain’t never gone change
I’ma still splurge with my squad, we gon' stay fucking all these broads
Niggas wasn’t loyal from the start, niggas mad 'cause we made it this far
A lot of niggas say they real but niggas ain’t who they are

[Verse 1: YB]
Why I got to stay sucker free
Niggas probably plotting right across the street
Same day one niggas staying with me
Please don’t get them niggas started cause them bodies is free
Walking in the party, got your broad with me
Everywhere I go, got the squad with me
And you already know we 100 deep
And I stay with the pole, but I’m so lowkey
[?], tryna duck the feds, cause a lot of my niggas ain’t make it
So for them, got to get this paper
And if a [?] nigga it’s a caper, adios, I’mma see you later
Niggas wasn’t real from the start
Don’t touch em, put money above em
Can never love a bitch, end of discussion
Now there’s so much money coming, they love how I’m stunting
I came up from nothing had to turn up into something

[Chorus: Johnny May Cash]
And once I touch some M's, I ain’t never gone change
I’ma still splurge with my squad, we gon' stay fucking all these broads
Niggas wasn’t loyal from the start, niggas mad 'cause we made it this far
A lot of niggas say they real but niggas ain’t who they are
And once I touch some M's, I ain’t never gone change
I’ma still splurge with my squad, we gon' stay fucking all these broads
Niggas wasn’t loyal from the start, niggas mad 'cause we made it this far
A lot of niggas say they real but niggas ain’t who they are

[Verse 2: J-Rock]
When I touch them M's I’ma stunt
Got bands already little chump
I’mma eat y’all niggas for lunch
Take your little bitches out for brunch
Get money is on my million
Fuck niggas I can’t stand near you
Pull up in that new thing
Take off with your boo thing
Squad too cray, got no brains
Shoot you, things go bang bang
All you niggas gone chit chat
Make my shooters go click clack
Bad little bitch got a fat cat
Break your bat, no kit kat
Take off fast, no Corvette
Fuck niggas wish they could catch that
Me and my squad gone get dough
Hustle every day nigga, wind or snow
Swag King Kong like [?]
Feeling like Future on Pluto
AK, ay I’m too cold
Everything I touch turn to gold
And never in my life trust these hoes
Cause real nigga, here, that’s the street code

[Chorus: Johnny May Cash]
And once I touch some M's, I ain’t never gone change
I’ma still splurge with my squad, we gon' stay fucking all these broads
Niggas wasn’t loyal from the start, niggas mad 'cause we made it this far
A lot of niggas say they real but niggas ain’t who they are
And once I touch some M's, I ain’t never gone change
I’ma still splurge with my squad, we gon' stay fucking all these broads
Niggas wasn’t loyal from the start, niggas mad 'cause we made it this far
A lot of niggas say they real but niggas ain’t who they are

[Verse 3: B-Moe]
Them boys was never loyal
Keep your money for the lawyers
Nice young bad bitch is spoiled
If you just have to run off
Cause you know these niggas be telling like
Some of these niggas came here to complain
They wasting my time, so what could I say but
Lot of niggas young like me
Tryna get out of the streets
Half of these niggas can’t eat
That’s why they probably been following me
I don’t be catching no tweets, I just made a page
Get on my business for sure, they know that’s my name
They watching my ways, listen to every little thing that I say
Tryna get in every little pic that I take, following every bad bitch that I play
So what can I say, know that we paid
I do this like every day
You and these niggas be lame
Better stay out of my way

[Chorus: Johnny May Cash]
And once I touch some M's, I ain’t never gone change
I’ma still splurge with my squad, we gon' stay fucking all these broads
Niggas wasn’t loyal from the start, niggas mad 'cause we made it this far
A lot of niggas say they real but niggas ain’t who they are
And once I touch some M's, I ain’t never gone change
I’ma still splurge with my squad, we gon' stay fucking all these broads
Niggas wasn’t loyal from the start, niggas mad 'cause we made it this far
A lot of niggas say they real but niggas ain’t who they are
