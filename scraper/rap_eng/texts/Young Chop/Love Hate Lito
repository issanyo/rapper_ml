These bitches don't love nobody and the hoes is for everybody
Bought a pistol for 40 dollars, it probably came with a dead body
We don't do no leg shots, aimin' at dread locks
Been that way since back when I was hanging on the L block
Take you back a decade, bricks were like half price
Looking for a plug with a mother fuckin' flashlight
Act like a nigga that ain't ever had his sack right
You ain't even gotta ask, right, it's all there, just tie the bag tight
I just bought a gun that I can't shoot at the range
If it'll rip through a vest, what you think it'll do to your brain
They be like, Lito what you doing, I'm just doing my thing
And moving on from my mistakes when I was new to the game
You gotta lose to learn, as far as I'm concerned, it was worth it
Don't have a clue, but all the cash I blew with my dog like a smurf fest
Sometimes I squeeze in too much shit in these syllables but the words fit
And I don't rehearse it, ain't trying to be perfect
Hid like 380 grams in a box of detergent
And they never found it when them peoples were searching
I learned a valuable lesson and never sleep where the work at
And never talk on them phones, you gotta meet me in person
Them shooters, like Chuck and Wesley
Yeah, I manage, she gotta fuck you and impress me
I been rocking ice since '99, Jermaine Gretzky
Go and tell another lie, say I ain't have it
If that upset you, that means you're petty
That little shit you call a check, throw dice like ice at a wedding
