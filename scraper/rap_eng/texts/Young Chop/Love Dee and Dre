[Intro: Young Dee, TK, and Dre]

[Verse 1: Young Dee]
Fuck that bitch "shit nigga pay me"
I'm chillin' with yo' ole lady
She said she wanna swallow my kids
So guess what, I let her swallow my kids
And she be on that freaky shit
Yeah she love to eat the dick
And no, I'm not no "Captain Save-a-hoe" but
I will beat the ho and toss her to my bro
And we don't cuff no hoes
We not no police but we will shoot you in yo nose
Make yo shit leak, like a faucet be
If a nigga got a problem i'll chop em' up like beef
If a nigga want the beef, he can meet the taco meat
Taco Bell running bails
And a nigga got big bullet shells
And lil' niggas don't wanna see me
Cuz they out here just a mess really
When I'm out here just dreamin'
I'm stickin' to the money
I'm gettin' to the paper
Got more bills then a nigga uh, matter fact a waiter
Shout-out to all my haters, I gotta catch you later
Most of these niggas sweet just like a now-and-later

[Hook: Young Dee]
These bitches love me, Dre and Young Dee
Bitches love me Dre and Young Dee
These bitches love me, Dre and Young Dee
Bitches love me Dre and Young Dee

[Verse 2: Dre]
I can't curse cuz I'm a youngin'
13, still get money
Yo money sound funny
Yo pockets lean and crumby
You looking like a dummy
Ball but no sphere though
Wanna find a nigga right here I'm all over the globe
Ha-ha you a zero, Christmas day you already know
Cash, she asked me do I have some of this Pinocchio
I say hold on weigh that
Just fix me a plate, back
Yo food, left, "you ate that"...Yes bruh
What i want for Christmas is family that's great bruh
You already know bruh no fake life this real life
Get in trouble all the time "only did it just twice"
This a MSFT, you didn't know?
We come creepin' in just like ghosts
I said ghosts but I mean skeleton
Hit a nigga up turn him into a pelican
I'm the main factor and you irrelevant
No top on, George Jefferson
I'm a Benjamin just like the Shelton
Purple and gold, a Laker
Yo girl is a shaker
Let's go get this paper
Paper-chaser, nobody here to save ya
That Tom-Tom a sprayer
Hi there, see you later
I roll just like a skater
You say you the bomb boy
I don't want the drama
Death before dishonor
That's the GRR nation-al
Hop out wit' that dumper
Oh yeah, that boys a jumper
These niggas see lil' Dre the...Kidd G
Shout-out Itty

[Outro: Dre]
Polokidd
MSFTS/TRKFT YRK TNL
Me and my niggas get commas all day everyday
Throw up the three's
