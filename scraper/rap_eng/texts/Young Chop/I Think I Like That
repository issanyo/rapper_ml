[hook: Sasha Go Hard]

I like my niggas body full of tats
How he talk, how he walk, how he act
Swag mean counting stacks in the back

I like it how I swag with my flow
Get my own bread, then I cop some more
How the ass drop when I hit the floor

[verse 1: Sasha Go Hard]

Bread first, drama last
I'm a real chick, I don't kiss ass
Real bitches get real money
Fake hoes don't make money
If you got them mad, shoot them down
Every girl in the game want to take the crown
Friendships don't need that
Real love, don't believe in that
My whole side don't chitchat
Them the ones that get quick snatched
Got a phone call
Im on my way
He got a beat ready for SGH
My team's small, no baseball
Her hubby through my call log
Throw it back, fall back
Hating on me fuck all y'all
A lot of niggas they say I'm weak
When they see me, they quick to speak
When they talking they ain't loud enough
Same boys that playing tough
Game her, stay in your lane
I'll leave your heart down full of pain
Got them stuck like a picture frame
Beat the face up red paint
You know my name, you know what I do
I'm * money, bitch how about you
I do what I want, I don't have to stunt
I'm solo and dolo
He rocking that polo
I'm ready you know, I'm down for sure
You can drop down to the floor
Rachet it though, you silly hoe
There's the door, you got to go

[verse 2]

I like a nigga on the grind
Getting money all the time
When he with me show me love
Pay attention and he fine
Counting money when he out
Talking about it, what about
If a bumb try to doubt
Punch him dead in his mouth
He got a cross on his chest
With some words on the left
Bad motherfucker swagged out gucci belt
Got these niggas on my bumper
Run up I will thump her
Bitches stand tall, don't fall or I stomp her
I walk up in the party and a bunch of bitches mugging
I'm guessing because they are mad
Pockets small, like a button
Schooling bitches I'm the captain, line up don't butting
Spending my money, spend your niggas money like it nothing
This exactly what I do
Buy me AE and Jimmy Choo
Make me smile like I'm a child
Definition of the truth
Talking to me, who are you?
F-U-C-K Y-O-U
Pussy sweeter than that sweet
Like its berry
