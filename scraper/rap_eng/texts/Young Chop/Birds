[Hook: Johnny May Cash]
Them birds wake me up in the morning (they chirping)
I can turn a 4 into a 9
Them birds wake me up in the morning
Can't you hear them birds chirping

[Verse 1: Johnny May Cash]
Wake up early in the morning with bricks all on my mind
Got these fiends calling my line
We getting bricks ten at a time
If money call me right better leave no wasting time
If a bitch really wanna fuck than that bitch gotta be fine
Bitch you must be out your mind thinking I'm a give you a dime
Sippin' on a pint of lean I swear it got me right
I'm up bout to jizz all night
Two wrong gonna make a right
Baking soda bottle wanna cook it right
Put the mask on before you get high
Keep the tool on the set all night
Get left if you can't get right
Okay officer it's my right
Thinking bout the pounds I got in the bag
You no I don't even know how to act
[?]
If you say something else from the club, I'm a hit you back in the A.M

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J Rock]
Check in the bag no Nike
Take off time George Jetson
Niggas be thinking they flexin'
But my squad really be flexin'
I'm up it's 5 in the morning
I'm fucking my bitch she moaning
I judge it like I do the work, boy
Water whippin' no surf board
Bullets flyin' like nerf, boy
Take a 4 piece and I stretch that
9 piece wanna back that
Large loads you need a fish net
Hot bars in my rap track
This God's work you gettin' baptized
Momma cryin' cause you front line
Sending shots and I keep firing
[?] I got steak sauce
Bat a nigga like baseball
Nick Cage knocked his face off
Trap shit i'm gon' make dawg
Work good so they keep buyin'
Block hot so I'm keep writin'
Real stars we high fiving
Chop Squad we move in silence

[Hook x2]
