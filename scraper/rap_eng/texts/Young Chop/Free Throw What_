[Hook]
Guns banging like the trunk
I was with it from the jump
We got guns, we don't jump
We don't run, we don't jump
We got clips, we be rolled up
Them bullets flying, he rolled up
I just got a check, it zeroed up
Straight three pointers, free throw what?

[Verse 1]
Smokin' Tooka with the guys
I got a big gun, large fries
Countin' money, don't ask where I get it, why?
I just got a chopper I sprayed it at flies
Pussy boy you just jumped off the bump
You'se a Lil Mouse, a lil chump
I swear I was wit it from the jump
I'm not from the back, I'm from the front
I wasn't playin' in the back, I played outside
Doin' drills, shooting up rides
I was scared when it was dark outside
That opp shit, that did not fly

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tadoe ass a little bug
He retarded, he a nut
Hey, get him a gun, he gone bust
No talkin', he gone bust
He got 50 thou for me to perform, it ain't enough
I might take it, I don't give no fuck
Rich young nigga but my car savaged up
Vroom-vroom-vroom, skudda skudda sku
I heard these niggas after me but this ain't what they want
50 in the clip, and a 100 zips of skunk
I just caught that ass bitch Fuck Takeoff, I'm finna launch
Load up these clips, and we fill em up

[Hook]
