[Hook]
They call me cocky fuck it
All the hoes they love it
They call me cocky fuck it
All the hoes they love it
Yeah I'm cocky, yeah I'm cocky
I don't give no fuck
Yeah I'm cocky, yeah I'm cocky
I don't give no fuck

[Verse 1]
They call me cocky fuck it all the hoes they love it
Loving on my style get real wild while I'm wildin
Fuck a frown I stay smiling flawless like a diamond
Ain't bored I'm grindin
Record soon to be on every shelf
All this polo on call me Ralph
Fuck everyone else I'm all about my self
All about that peso
Im the best I say so
I'm the best she say so
Yo bitch stay on this dick
Ass so thick we gon make a flick
Off them cloths she strip
Biting on my lip my D Rose
MVP in your bitch I'm her top dog
Show boutin ass bitch you just a hotdog
Ketchup up to flow ketchup to my grind
But you never gon never gon catch up to my shine
Tony Montana with these lines
The world is mine, the world is mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back back with a fat sack and a fat rap
Bouta get smacked wit that lyrical crack
No coke no strap this hype not trap
These chrismas ass spittas should unwrap
Talkin wack that yap yap
They bitches sending me snapchats
You want the dick you can't have that
Throw em up if you got tities in your phone
Throw em up if you got tities in your phone
Don't hate me cuz my ego swollen
See flexin on em's all I known
Brewski flowin perfect game I be throwin
Fuck you leave your mind blown
Your coochi I'm gucci I'm louie not lewis
Make your girl wanna chew this

Such an influence I'm fluent
In getting my way fuck what a op gotta say
I do this shit every fucking day
