[Intro]

[Verse: CxRis]

I don't really give a fuck
You could like me, you could hate me but
There's only one truth
And it's what I spit out in the booth
It's what i recite on the stage
I'm bringing the life to this age
I've broken right out of the cage
And i'm gunning for everyone standing in front of it
Think of a tiger inside of a zoo
That see all these people that he can't get to
They look and they laugh, but what can he do
He pray for a chance that he can get loose
Visualizing the damage he'd do
Picture the power, get to the food
Setting a goal, make it come true
Never no stopping cuz' you never know when
That gate could just open. Until then you hopin
And keep on provoking attention of people that
Want to hate on you but they make you stronger
They act like they like you, behind you they taunt you
[pause]
Thinking that you're the stupid one, Wheeeen
You watch they're every move, and you know they ain't friends
Dap with you at parties, talk shit to they're friends
I've kept it real since day one
It's time to have it my way once
Attracting all of these bad women that i'm only trying to lay with once
I don't have a main bitch cuz' I know what they want
And i'm on my grind, try to change it you won't
Get a clue that I don't have time for the bull shit
I don't want to have a convo, not about music, or making money
I see it coming (Yeah)
Living off these verses like life support, keep it running
They say never to believe it until the day that you see it
Thought about it, had a vision, your life is how you perceive it
See it in your mind, Attract it with your soul
Chase it with ambition and it will happen how you want it
I got it I got it and so does the tiger
Then he saw his chance to make it and took it
And now he is free when they said he couldn't be
He beat the odds and got what he desired
Fear is fake, that's a promise, it's created by you
There's a little known fact, that I can prove to be true
Now danger, that's something that's as real as me
But that should motivate you to beat
Whatever the case of danger may be
Im gone!
