{Verse: MillaG}

Goin' Up, Comin' Back / Shit is Wack, But It's a Flat
Comin' Down, Shit in Tact / Skinny Nygga, Get'n Fat
Jack Mac, go get dat pouch dem stamps & cigarettes / go get dat bag
Chargin' nyggaz out da ass / gotta make it last forever
Call my nygga Keif and tell him it's no sweat, I'm get'n Lo
No livin wit' regrets and tell em' it's a BET!/ (Dat) I'll be BACK!
It's da Terminator,fuck deez nyggaz wher'at? / Dats a fact..
Call me Exterminator / Takin out da Rats..
Dats yo bitch / Oh she call me Daddy
See me Ca$hin Check$ , whipped dat Max
Bringin home da Bacon / takin out da trash
Funkdafied, since I been Da Brat / now I'm like a Vet
Get respect / 31 and shit, I feel like I been dead then came BACK!
Michael Jackson Thrilla, it's da Walkin' Dead / when I come BACK!
They can't tell me shit / I'm itchin' 4 dis' Ca$h
Dead Presidents ju heard ? / Return of the Walkin' Dead, mo'fuckas!
Tell em' we don't play / this ain't GTA, or PS4
This ain't Call o' Duty / we can go to war
Loaded Gun, off dat Coke & Rum / I smoked 100 Blunts, fuck a pill
I ain't wit' da Molly, but she fit da bill / like a dress
Boy ya bitch a mess, How u even stand her?
Clean her up, like er' Janitor / a clean sweep & mop
I'm at da top, bottom bitch a model / know I'm from da bottom, gimme TOP!
But forgive me NOT! / U can't get this dick, DATS a BLOCK!
Dats da Hostage and da Baby? / Call in SWAT! Oh dats SCOTT!
Man I told you he was crazy..He a PUNK! / Then WASSUP!
U can get this lump or u can get this pump/ What you WANT?
Anyway you want, you leavin' in da trunk / BODYBAG!
Kill em' when I wanna / Clips o' marijuana...
DATS A $TACK! / dat nobody puts..Millie in Da Corner
Million Dollars, but I'm Worth 100 / Millie ain't just rhymin', Millie Talkin'
But I'm bout to show em' / guess I'll just go Diamond, PLATNUM PLAQUES!
Cuz these ain't just raps, these is more than that / these is MAPS!
Call me GPS, Grindin' Packs Strapped / Boy I'm BACK
Letta nygga front , hit him wit' dis Cannon
Leave him missin', Where dat nygga at... / ..ain't seen him, Ed O'Bannon
Cold Case / Crack a Cold Corona, deez nyggaz is Lemons...
