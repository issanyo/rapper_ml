(chorus)
Got yo bitch at da crib
Got a Glock on my hip
My squad strapped in da back
Wit ks ready to kill
Fuck niggas got tags on they head
Ima say bout a mill

(verse 1)
Niggas talk a bunch of shit till i lose a couple clips
And so what i can't dance but you can get pistol whiped
Rolling in a coupe wit some boys on da roof
Got a number 47 and a number eleven
Nigga we stay strapped so dont clapped
We set up waiting on you in the front and in the back

(chorus)
Got yo bitch at da crib
Got a Glock on my hip
My squad already strapped loaded ready to kill
Fuck niggas got tags on they head
Ima say bout a mill
