[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
3 hoes in my bed like I’m Austin Powers
I got girls kissing girls while they in the shower
We gon get groovy, Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
3 hoes in my bed, like I’m Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Shizer, you gon' need a visor
My neck, my ring, my finger, it is yellow, no highlighter
Buyer, boy I am on fire
In that Aston Martin and I’m crawling like a spider
I’m in Amsterdam, smoking on that Amsterdam
I am so high it got me looking like a Chinaman
Everything gold, I’m a gold member
Six rings on, I got gold fingers
My name is Austin Powers, 3 bitches in the shower
And they ready to get groovy, make a movie baby
Versace when I’m sleeping, in Paris for the weekend
And I got these bitches leaking when I’m speaking baby

Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
3 hoes in my bed like I’m Austin Powers

We gon get groovy, Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
3 hoes in my bed, like I’m Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Bitch make shawty crack, like they in the 80’s
Thugga wear Versace, she rock Old Navy
Everybody swagging, got these bitches debating
Nigga living life just like Walter Payton
How many times have I told you that Thugga got rich off a sentence?
How many times have I told you I like my Henny and Remy?
How many times have I told you that I would send you a lil remedy?
How many times have I told you that I would eat you like Denny's?
No JC, I buy her pennies
I took her out of the cheap shit
I bought her the mink now she fizzy
Oops I meant fuzzy, I pray that bitch is my bousin (Suwoop!)
You pray that bitch is my cousin, and now she say that we dirty

Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower

Austin Powers, Austin Powers
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Breaking down bales of tree early in the morning
Garbage bag full of grass like I just mowed the lawn
Got a super plug, so I got super power
I feel like Austin Powers, real gangsters move in silence
Doing 150 in the coupe, I just love the rush
It’s a cold world we live in, and so in my chopper I trust
100 shots I bust, 100 motherfucking P's of Reggie on that motherfucking Greyhound bus
I feel like MC Hammer, I can’t be touched
He tried to charge me but he broke, so it can’t be much
Hating get you nothing, money bring you Austin Powers
I swear these niggas just like this blunt, man these niggas sour

Austin Powers, Austin Powers
3 hoes in my bed, like I’m Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
