Ayy

[Verse]
Yea, I pay lil' quarters to Baldi
Jon247 is my rap name
I got into this game and my fame right there
I got lots of friends at my school cuz it's amazing (woo)
We be cooling and chilling all day with my dawgs
And now, my series starts tomorrow when it's funny
It's animated, thanks to Henry Lamb
My guy X died hope he feels better and long live him
Tops off with the Young Chopper sound

[Outro]
Woo!
