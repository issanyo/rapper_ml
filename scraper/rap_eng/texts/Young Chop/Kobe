[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I been ballin' so damn hard I swear I think that I'm Kobe
Young bull of this rap shit but I think that I'm Kobe
I swear I'm dunkin on these hoes on these niggas I'm free throwin
These boys they don't like me cause I think that I'm Kobe
Watch me hit the strip club make it rain like I’m Kobe
Industry full of lames I play the game like I'm Kobe
And since I think I'm Kobe my bitch don't like to know me
This is for them niggas that be thinking they Kobe

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I say baby I got the racks she like you need to show me
She gon wanna blow me cuz I ball like I'm Kobe
On my right wrist Versace on my left wrist a Rolly
I hold my Rolly up and now them bad bitches on me
I pull them hundreds out my right pocket fifties out my left
I'm ballin' like I'm Kobe I got plug with the ref
Watch me shoot this three, infirmary step
I got twenty seven more and them be courtesy shells
Since I signed with Jimmy Iovine I swear I think that I'm Kobe
You boys won't be like me and I think that you owe me
Since I signed with Jimmy Iovine I swear I think that I'm Kobe
You boys won't be like me and I think that you owe me

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I been ballin' so damn hard I swear I think that I'm Kobe
Young bull of this rap shit but I think that I'm Kobe
I swear I'm dunkin on these hoes on these niggas I'm free throwin
These boys they don't like me cause I think that I'm Kobe
Watch me hit the strip club make it rain like I’m Kobe
Industry full of lames I play the game like I'm Kobe
And since I think I'm Kobe my bitch don't like to know me
This is for them niggas that be thinking they Kobe

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Man I smoke so much dope I swear I think that I'm Smokey
Tadoe off that Molly and me I love smokin'
Hundred thousand in one pocket I get paid like I'm Kobe
When these fuck boys play games man I just play like I'm Kobe
My lil bitch just asked why I be stuntin so hard
Cuz them guns shoot one two one two ain't no stompin the yard
I want top in the car she say boy you goin too far
I said I'm Kobe bitch don't act like you never done this before
I been ballin so damn hard I got them ugly faces
I'm so Nowitzki bitch I'm Kobe I got plug with the yay
I been ballin so damn hard I got them ugly faces
I sold Nowitzki bitch I'm Kobe I got plug with the yay

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I been ballin' so damn hard I swear I think that I'm Kobe
Young bull of this rap shit but I think that I'm Kobe
I swear I'm dunkin on these hoes on these niggas I'm free throwin
These boys they don't like me cause I think that I'm Kobe
Watch me hit the strip club make it rain like I’m Kobe
Industry full of lames I play the game like I'm Kobe
And since I think I'm Kobe my bitch don't like to know me
This is for them niggas that be thinking they Kobe
