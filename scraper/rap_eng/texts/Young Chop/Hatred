He consumes me
And She just looks

Everyone talks about their inner demons
But nobody talks about how to beat them

She consumes me
And he just looks

My demons are not yours
Not like anyone else's (nobody else)


I feel one, one very strong and painful

Painful and strong very one, one feel me (you)
Hi, I'm the one greeting you
I greet you, he is, hello, friend?

4 U


I'm tired of bringing so much hatred
I'll have to take it out, but
Without spoiling me or hurting someone else
