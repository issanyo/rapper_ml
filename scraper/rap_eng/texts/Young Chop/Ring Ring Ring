[Verse 1: Young Chop]
Fuckin' your bitch on vacation
VV diamonds in my bracelet
My shooter just got off probation
My lawyer just beat all the cases
Fuck up the check everywhere that we go
Fishscales comin' straight off the boat
3500 just for my coat, damn
Red Bottoms on my feet when I walk
100K for a nigga to talk
Got the money stashed all in the vault
Your bitch on me, nigga, that ain't my fault
Kick the bitch out the coupe, make the bitch walk
Niggas hatin' on me, get the fuck on
Niggas hatin' on me, get the fuck on
Dressin' up, dressin' up, then go to work
Sippin', sippin' this pint cause I'm thirsty
I fucked your, I fucked your, I fucked your bitch on the first day
Now let's get back to the money, cause...

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
I slide through like Lenny Dykstra
Way back in 7th grade I candy painted my bicycle
Came through with Gucci pattern, money taller than Bin Ladin
Might move to Alabama, got a Versace log cabin
I could've been a cold singer
Might swing through East England, codeine in my sprinkler
Damn, I got ice from North Alaska
I reside inside a castle, slide and swervin' through traffic
Barbershop inside my attic
Jacuzzi in my kitchen
Palm still itchin', wood wheel flippin'
Raspberry Expedition

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Ayy, cash in pocket, nigga, fuck a wallet
My debit card, my credit card both got deposits
Flexin' be my hobby, flexin' in the lobby
Ride around in 'Raris, pulled up to the party
Pullin' up in Bimmers the color Bacardi
I ride around an Audi, fuck a Maserati
40 in the party, please don't tell nobody
Tadoe got the shotty, all the shots we callin'
Woah, Kemosabe, pocket full of money
Head full of dreads, callin' me accomplice
Love the smell of laundry, I love the smell of money
Pretty like a Sunny and I'm also Sunny
