First ima go get some guap from da bank
Iont won't no 1's just hunnids in my hands
Hoes just thots and they won't all my bands
Killin dezz tracks niggas dont stand a chance
Chillin in da coupe wit da tec aimed at you
When you look dont run cause it might start to shoot
I dont won't your weed cause got dat too
Keep a tree growin when one ready
Im blowin stanky so do bring reggie
Cause we ain't shareing
And where im from da cops ain't caring
So dont try me or we"ll  be buryin
