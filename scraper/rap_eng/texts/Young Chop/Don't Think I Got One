[Hook]
I don't think I got one (x4)
A ring, I don't think I got one
A main, I don't think I got one
I don't think I got one (x4)
A rose, I don't think I got one
Yo ho, mane I think I got her

[Verse 1]
Pull up catch a opp I got one
And since I got one here the cops come
Pull up get yo ho I got her
I'm finna bust down yo ho and send her back up
I was in a party fulla trappers
Party fulla trappers wit my Gat up
Niggas scared, they don't want no problems
Cause they know these problems they can't solve'em
These niggas know that we about the violence
Niggas say we hidin' but we ridin'
Just bought a gun and bought it wit silence
Come through, shhh, bang it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm finessin', countin' checks in, gettin' checks in
And if you disrespect this Smith & Wesson
Gimme my Smith & Wesson, at yo neck
Rush out, stripped yo bitch ass naked
It's a habit, all I make is classic
Mama raised me, that makes me a bastard
Now the fucking bastard at getting cabbage
And now this young savage car savage
Don't give no fuck I pay the bar balance
Just to meet me bitch, it cost a large balance
Bitch these Air Force One, not no New Balance
I ain't 2 Chainz, I'm too hammers
