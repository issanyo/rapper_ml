Hook:(Young Souljah)
Middle Finger to them niggas who don´t wanna see me rise
Middle Finger to them Bitches who was telling me lies
Middle finger to them niggas who say that we ain´t Fly
Because we gonna do this until we Die

Verse 1:(Young Souljah)

Since these day are getting sunny, it´s me they wanna see
Guess it´s the impact of my money that make ´em realize who I be
But I´m all about myself because I do my own thang
Ain´t following nobody´s footsteps because I´m a grown man
Writting rhymes getting mine like I´m supposed to
Come here bitch we them niggas you wanna be closed to
I don´t know why it´s happening but I gotta thank jesus
I´ve been so damn High that these broke niggas couldn´t see us
Don´t talk about it, be about it one day you will be proud about it
Through hip hop I made it,middle finger to them niggas who doubted
Late night working while everybody still dreaming
Check these diamonds on my neck,now niggas be scheming
If it wasn´t for your advice I would end up sinning

Middle Finger to them niggas who don´t wanna see me rise

Verse 2:(Young Souljah)
Middle finger to them niggas who don´t wanna see me rise
To the top is where you gonna see us, I ain´t gonna tell you no lies
Since haters hate I can Only say fuck ´em we ball
Pray for my downfall, but until then watch me at the mall
I ain´t got time for them I be on some other shit
Mo money mo problem, and I still don´t trust a Bitch
I´d rather die rich and famous then alone and poor
Give me the mic and I´ll give you what I´m here for
Real recognise real, but only fake niggas I see
I don´t trust them still, because it´s me they wanna be
There´s only one way, and it´s called hustle hard every day
Time to get paid, so  better hear what we got to say
