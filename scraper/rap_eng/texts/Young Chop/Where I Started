[Hook: Johnny Maycash]
The money came fast, now these niggas hate
I'm gon' get that cake, bitch I'm gon' get straight
I might fuck your ho so get her out my face
I catch her out there standin' every day
Now I check the bag, it filled with spaz of course
I'm only 19 bout to cop a Porsche
He say he flexin' but his money short
You fast as fire, need to go back where you started

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Ridin' in that mojo lowey
Pockets filled with hundred money
I am not no dummy dummy
Pistol hit your tummy tummy
And I got a tommy tommy
Glock 10 marked doin' bunnies bunnies
He want beef its funny funny
We come through, army army
All we see is running running
Guess what, I am blunted blunted
This shit smells like onions onions
Trae Cas Stacy be smokin' that funny funny, funny
Swear that shit ain't funny funny
3.5 in my blunted blunted
Let me get some top honey
Then I might just bone it bone it
Walk in the label, then I'm runnin' runnin'
I need my cash at this fuckin' moment
This is business, we is not no homies
Don't make me catch a fuckin' homie

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Johnny Maycash]
I drink mud nigga, hella mud nigga
I keep lotta pills just to keep me up nigga
That's the drug nigga, you ain't no drug nigga
You wish you was Swisher, I'm the plug nigga
Sosa nigga, with the 36 grams of the good nigga
I feel good nigga, I wish you would nigga
Bust a .30 pistol, ain't shit like Tiger woods nigga
They say they get money, he don't get money
Boy show me your pockets, can you stop this logic
These niggas broke, they ain't gettin' nothin'
Steady watchin' the money come and go
But my niggas be on it
Cash rule everything my nigga
You know that we want it

[Hook]
