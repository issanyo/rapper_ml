[Intro]
I gotta listen to people because of your fucking shit?
Your ordering me out?
You better get your own fucking army pal

[Hook]
Stop the bank
Money we make it
Nigga we take it
Bitches be naked
My body numb full of drugs (x4)
Full of drugs

When I'm counting money, only time I'm smiling (x4)

[Verse 1]
I be high, bitches eye blinking
Rap it hunnid times, still have to pause thinking
When I'm counting money, only time I'm smiling
Girl your money took me 3 days to count it
[?]
Boy mansion you can fit 80 pounds
I be super high, super-super-super high
Got a fifth of bottle to a [?]
Count it 9 mill
Have to climb hills
40 hunnid watches, look at that time heal
Hurricane Chris
Money was my main business
Stack the paper, never let the money and fame mix

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What you gon' do
Do it for drugs
Rondo, bitches combo
I might turn you, call me [?]
Bread and butter, sticks and stones
Hot 9, switching phones
Catch the channel, my body numb
Skinny dipping, [?]
Silverback gorillas in this country jungle
All my niggas scoring every time them niggas fumble
Harry Fraud, Chinx, Durk, that's the family
We took it over, hope you understand it
Play with rings, money talks
Speak 10 different languages
Montana

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ey what the fuck you doing on tv anyhow
You know I get calls from back home every fucking day
They think your on bad shape
I'm only on TV is because I get to be able to hang around in the casino
You know you understand that
Yeah fucking is
You could have had the food and beverage job without going on television
You wanted to go on TV
