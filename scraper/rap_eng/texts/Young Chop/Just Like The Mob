This 300 o block shit, just like the mob
So we start juggin at bar, all type of cars
Damn I never thought we would make it this far
On the block, selling raw, wit a bundle in my draws
(Bandcamp) (trapaholics) REAL TRAP SHIT

[Hook]
It just be me! Who? Ballout!
And the squad
Any nigga act like he got it, he getting guaped
Smoking dope, watching white hoes sniff raw
And with all that nigga back shit, that shit fraud
I be in the trap juggin, big draws
We gotta watch these junkies, they crooked, just like the law
So I went to the store and bought, burglary bars
This 300 o block shit, just like the mob

[Verse]
This 300 o block shit, just like the mob
So we start juggin at bar, all type of cars
Damn I never thought we would make it, this far
On the block, selling raw, where the bundle, where my draw
Steady watching for the law, twin bags in my jaws
My trap stay boomin like a fucking shoppin mall
But it don’t close, you can shop till you fall
I work night shifts man, I just want it all
My name ballout so you know I love to ball
Ball the globe boys with me so we can flex on y’all
Riding round town we 300 superstars
Sellin dope through the burglar bars

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
Today I went to the dealer and bought a car
Paid cash, no car payments to flex on y’all
Riding karma cars through 300 boulevard
Remember last time I was out here sellin raw
But I ain’t been around cause they be treat me like a star
And I don’t want all that attention, on y’all
Cause when my niggas shoot niggas droppin they fall
I don’t trust nigga, they be talkin to them laws
That’s why you can’t see me put it through the burglar bars
Cause we so smart, street smart like the mob
That’s why it’s 300 o block shit just like the mob
That’s why it’s 300 o block shit just like the mob

[Hook]
