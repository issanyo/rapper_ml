[intro]
Catch a case
Catch a case


[verse 1]

Just got home
From atlanta
Came to a house full of private dancers
One had on a thong
One didint
The others were freaks
They wanted me to listen
I said no hoe got
Some in da kitchen
She said what
I said flickin
My wrist and washin dishes

[hook]
X15 catch a case

I got off the plane
Ready to go to sleep
Till my girl wanted to go
Out to eat
[Chorus]
