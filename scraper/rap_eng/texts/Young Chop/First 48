[Hook: Young Chop & King James]
You ain't killed nobody bout' a week ago
I know your whole story you's a fuckin' ho
Run up on a nigga with that 30 ho
Blow his fucking face with that pump doe'

I heard this nigga sneak dissin' my squad though
Quit tweakin' with my niggas you ain't hard ho
Don't make me have to pull your fuckin' gun ho
Put this pump up in your face it go GRAAAAA ho

[Verse 1: Young Chop]
Fuck all that talkin' we want war ho
Fuck all that talkin' where yo guns doe
Ay my nigga shooting shit just for fun ho
And you think about robbin' me that's a nah, nah

[Verse 2: King James]
Comin' up out the cut better run ho
Chop a nigga down with my gun doe
That nigga ain't got no name he's a John Doe
Body bag, toe tag, fuck that ho

[Verse 3: Young Chop]
Run upon his ass shoot his ass some mo'
Forensic's out pickin' bullets off the flo'
They askin' me these questions I don't fuckin' kno'
Where you been, what time you get in, I don't kno'

[Verse 4: King James
Now they looking for me like 224
First 48 knockin' at my door
Kickin' down my shit and throw me on the floor
I ain't say shit, they know I did it though

[Hook]
