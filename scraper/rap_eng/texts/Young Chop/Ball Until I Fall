(Intro)

Real niggas do real shit
And that´s that real shit for my real niggas

Verse 1: (Young Souljah)
They got me strugglin thinkin about my own fate
Get your money straight cause that´s what niggas hate
Can you picture a young souljah ballin?
This life got me wonderin too many question are bein askin
Will they love to see me rise or see me fallin ?
And since I´m all in, why these bad bitches keep callin?
They wasn´t there when I was complainin, on all the fight I´ve lost
But no matter what it cost I promise myself to be the Boss
Chasing that paper is all I see, call this Hustler Ambition
I feel like this was meant to be, so who gives a fuck about our competition
Because I´m built to be strong built for success
Even if something goes wrong I still never bow down for less
Sorry if I tell you that I´m the one, It´s because they can´t walk in my shoes
They Don´t know what I´ve done, and the shit I´ve been through
Life is a Highway so we gonna ride until we drop
And best believe we can´t be stopped like it or not

Hook (Young Souljah)
Ball Ball until I Fall
Ball Ball We go Hard
Ball Ball until I fall
We go hard
We Ball

Verse 2: (Young Souljah)
I got the Master plan with only a paper and a pen in hand
Now who´s the man?I Don´t give a fuck if you Don´t unterstand
I gave myself an Ultimatum, hitting rock bottom or go platinum
Serve anyone with my Verses now tell me who want some !
Niggas hüstle hard hard on these streets,how else they supposed to eat?
Since it ain´t no justice, it ain´t no peace unless we have a piece
I came a long way so you better hear what the song say
It´s a struggle for survival ever day but y´all Don´t hear me though anyway
The reason why I´m still alive it´s because I do this for my people
For those who ain´t supposed to be equal,Those who by the money turned evil
Talk is cheap so we show em, we gonna make it to the top like we told ´em
Now they wanna hang with me but I Don´t know them
We went from niggas in the backseat to niggas in the front
Call it what you want but be sure that failin we won´t
Ball until I fall, and watch these bitches act like
We want to have it all, but you ain´t about that life


Hook (Young Souljah)
Ball Ball until I Fall
Ball Ball We go Hard
Ball Ball until I fall
We go hard
We Ball
