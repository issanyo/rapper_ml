[Hook: Dahaq]
If you want to roll you know who you need to call
Finna ball, hit the mall, you can have it all
Take you where you wanna go, hop in the car
Give it my all just so I can have it all
Where these haters tryna go down with all that talk
Protocol: fuck the law finna have it all
Y’all taking notes, how we move, how we walk
Give it my all just so I can have it all

[Verse 1: P-Squiddy]
The game's at a standstill? We're stepping it up a notch
The youngest voices on the scene, here for the money and scotch
Can't speak for the other contenders in the back row shaking
Shit they're still bakin' bread with the kind of dough they're making
System's been trying to mold me, transform me, make me cold
Well fuck that, I make my own path, ain't no fork in the road
When I'm in the zone, I'm restless and devoted
They full of their own conceited thoughts, bloated and sugar coated
This is real rap, we ain't tryna clown
So take that weak shit and flush it back down
I admit it, I'm a reckless mess
But I'm the motherfuckin' best!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: MoDime]
I wanna have it all
So I’m rapping up my first verse
Need that steady income
I’ll give these hoes a taste then swerve
But for now I ball
Making buckets in some decent clothes
Dahaq gave me a call
And I spit these bars with no rehearse
Getting As and making gains
More flexing and containing dames
Wait, your girl look so thirsty
Hold up give her some D
I’m gonna get it all
Cause ambition is the only word
I’m never gonna fall
Get back up and just Ali these foes
See you through the dope flames
I’m here getting educate
Yo bitch notice I get pay
Yo bitch give me hella brain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dahaq]
Copying my mottos and copying my swag
So I’m poppin' their bottles and poppin' my tags!
Want a double entendre, here’s a souvenir
Run back to yo mama, make y’all disappear
The clapper scatter 'em like dispatchers
That's blood splattered, state of mind shattered
Wait, pockets getting fatter, not talking weight chatter
On my way to becoming your girl’s favorite rapper
People want beef I can prepare that platter
Life is a story so I started a new chapter
Now I’m sitting, shitting, spitting on beginners
Life was so dark 'til I saw that shimmer
From the ground to the crown can’t count my blessings
A sinner or a singer, no difference in diction
Got an addiction to somethin' that is hidden in the kitchen
My vision seein' women, addition or apparitions?
I ain’t even kiddin', now I’m running this bitch, that’s treadmill shit
Looks like you 'bout to be run over bitch, that’s roadkill shit
And you know all I do is represent, you can call me the president
Take a vote, 100 percent assent, Alhamdulillah I’m on my ascent
