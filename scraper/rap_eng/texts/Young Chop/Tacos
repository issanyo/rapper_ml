[Intro]
We serving tacos!
Tacos!

[Hook: Johnny May Cash]
We serving Tacos
Like we from Mexico
You know we got them tacos
Taco, taco, taco
I don't want the lettuce
I eat tomatoes
Can't forget the cheese
Can't forget the sour cream

[Verse 1: Johnny May Cash]
Aye, I hopped out the new Phantom Ghost
It's the same color as a taco (true that)
See me and you got the valingos (believe that)
See me and you got the valingos, aye
Let me hit 'em all amigo
Rapping them bricks like burritos (aye)
We banging them all tortillos (believe that)
Then I'm shipping 'em straight off the rego
Tacos fat so the shit 'gon sale (shit 'gon sale)
Yo shit ain't even gonna touch the shelf
How you 'gon sell something and yo shit stale (bogus)
Trap about fifteen bricks right off my steps
Talking 'bout Johnny May Cash name name ring bells
Shorty ass too fat swear she 'gon break them shelves
You better not bring no fat bitch at my steps
Tryna eat all my food thinking that shit well
I want my tacos!

[Hook: Johnny May Cash]

[Verse 2: Ca$h Out]
Haha, fuck it
I just left the kitchen
And Chop wanted me to whip up a taco
I'm getting my cheese nigga, throw it on some nachos
I wanna leave the game
The plug won't let me
What you make in a year, spent that on Jesappi
Just searching through the bricks
Tryna find some good ones
You talking trap shit, tell me can you cook one?
Sticks at the door, get ya mind out that fuck shit
My mind on that money, I'm something bitches wanna fuck with
Favorite place to be is the kitchen
I gotta straight drop it, when I whip it
Only thing in that bowl, is fish scales
Jays in the line, I'm serving 'em
Taco Bell!
