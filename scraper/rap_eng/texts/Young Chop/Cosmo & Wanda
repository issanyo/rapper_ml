Verse 1:
Them fake hoes, in fake clothes;
That's the ish I'm not fond of
I get green like Cosmo
Her p*ssy pink just like Wanda
I ball hard with the girls I'm with
I'm Rondo, She Ronda
Got a big d*ck, like 10 inch
I can fit ya b*tch in my condom!
I penned it down & you turned it up
Don't make a sound when I turn it up
You niggas frown, but your b*tches smile
& I blaze the track like I burned it up!
Uhn, that's real n*gga..
Uhn, get bills nigga
Moved all the way to the brinks of Chicago
All the way from Meek Mill's city that's my hometown...
You niggas what I don't like
She ride my handle bars like it's so bike
I'm with them fucking girls that get so dike
I'm freestyling off my mind but it's so write
Adidas on my feet, man that got me so hype
Used to kick push until the day was over but I'm now I'm with them ho dikes..
Man I'm sh*ttin on ya whole life! ...
[Outro]
Man that's it... Just cut the beat off
