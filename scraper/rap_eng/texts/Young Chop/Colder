Intro:
All that other bullshit, is here today and going tomorrow ( I make the paint )
W-W-W-Where'd you find this, in the motherfucking lab, in the motherfucking lab

{Verse 1: Young Chop]
Growing up in my house, there was verbal abuse
A lot of yelling all the time, so I thought it was cool
We just sat down listen, wasn't nothing much we could do
Pops, look at me now, I'm just like you
I miss my uncle and my grandpa, I'm just speaking the truth
Sometimes, I feel that I'm lost, Ion know what to do
Moms, so strong, look at all the shit she been through
It was worse back then, we don't even got a clue
Time fly by, big bruh said he hadda move
Lil third onna way, I remember them news
Me and sis don't talk I feel it's time that we lose
I stay real to my religion, everyday I'm true
If you talkin bout, keep me inna loop
My life is a movie, I'm about to grab the cannon and shoot
If you talkin bout me, nigga keep me inna loop
My life is a movie, I'm about to grab the canon and shoot

[Chorus: Young Chop]
Time flyin' by, a nigga a gettin older
As time go by, a nigga heart get colder
A nigga heart get colder
A nigga heart get colder
Time flyin' by, a nigga a gettin older
As time go by, a nigga heart get colder
A nigga heart get colder
A nigga heart get colder

[Verse 2: Young Chop]
I'm all grown up now, I ain't takin no shit
Pops still wildin' out, trippin' on some bullshit
Hadda jump in, round the neck he had a full crip
Got in between told a nigga he better cool it
As time flying by, a nigga tryna forget thangs
In my zone, blown smashing down my own lane
Hopin things will change, everyday is the same
When pops start yellin, I feel moms pain
Tired of being in the house, so I'm out thuggin'
She still holdin' on, cause deep down she love him
I love him too, but I hate him when he start buggin
At the end of the day, a nigga mad over nothing
When a nigga mad, it's time that he lose
Stay real to my religion, everyday I'm true
If you talkin bout, keep me inna loop
My life is a movie, I'm about to grab the cannon and shoot
[?]
Time flyin by, a nigga a gettin older
As time go by, a nigga heart get colder
A nigga heart get colder
A nigga heart get colder
Time flyin by, a nigga a gettin older
As time go by, a nigga heart get colder
A nigga heart get colder
A nigga heart get colder
