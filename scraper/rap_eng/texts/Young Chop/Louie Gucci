[Intro: Chief Keef & Johnny Maycash]
Got Louie, Gucci my Prada, man I'm swagged out
Got Gucci, Louie no Prada, I be swagged out
Big bands in my pocket, bitch I'm cashing out
Trappers in here, we gone blast out
Riding 'round in them cars cost 100 thou'
Go broke on clothes, bitch I cash out
Go, we be swagged out

[Hook: Johnny Maycash] (x2)
Got Louie, Gucci my Prada, man I'm swagged out
Big bands in my pocket, bitch I'm cashing out
Riding 'round in cars cost 100 thou'
Yo bitch gone do the team, girl open your mouth

(Verse 1)
Got Gucci, Louie no Prada, I be swagged out
Go broke on clothes, bitch I cash out
I don't give no fuck I will spazz out
Trappers in here we gone blast out
She see that I'm sacked up, now she on me
Say she ain't sucking no dick, ho we gone see
Bitch I'm sacked up and it's on me
You ain't my bitch, bitch we homies
Extensions on the clip, yeah we gone blast
Gone ahead without a future, leave you in the past
My brightlight shine like a star, right
Pull up in them cars and they foreign

(Hook x2)
