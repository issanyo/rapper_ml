[Hook:]

She take it slow then she wine it up
I'm showing love but that's not enough
Girl, you look fine like wine
Loan me some of your time
Tell me, can you be my friend?
I would like to tell you who I am
Baby, will you take me for who I am?
I'm a hold the deal up on my end
Bang, bang

Verse:

Youngest out the city
Realest young nigga, shorties with me
You know a nigga 100 fuck a fifty
You know a nigga 100 fuck a fifty
Young nigga out here stupid making stupid figures
Shoutout cold heart clique they my realest niggas
Started off on SoundCloud now I'm thinking bigger
30 shots at a nigga lookin like a clipper
30 xannys on a baddie, and she getting naughty
I got her number and we kicked it like karate
Hit the spoty now the shortie singing like kelahni
Shortie hyped up sorta feeling like desani
I'm the top dog feeling like im king of diamonds
I could slime her in a second nigga I ain't lying
And whatever shit you sellin nigga I ain't buyin
Killed the remix in a minute i ain't even tryin

[Hook:]

She take it slow then she wine it up

[Verse:]

I'm a savage and I know it don't test me
I got a 10 bitch, you cannot impress me
I got god by my side, yo he blessed me
Mess with me and catch these snipes, like I'm wesley
Woah
Nigga touching down on road
With a bad gyal and she really wanna go
Ask about her friend and then send her to my bro
Wrist so cold shit be looking like snow
Shit so cold shit looking like ice
20k views so I'm feeling all nice
She really down to go I can see it in her eyes
Realest young nigga I can never tell a lie
Livin' fast life cuz I ain't afraid to die
Pour out my heart and I put it online
One in a mil you ain't one of my kind
And you know how we party bih we do it by the pint
Yeah

[Hook:]

She take it slow then she wine it up
