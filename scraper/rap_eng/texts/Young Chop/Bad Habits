I know that
You know what I'm saying?
I got habits I can't shake
You know what I'm saying?
I got high-end expensive linen
You know what I mean?
You know what I'm saying?
Driving fast cars
Counting a lot of cash
Fucking bad bitches
You know what I'm saying?
Smoking good OG weed
Pouring up good Actavis

[Hook: MPA Wicced]
I got bad habits

Counting cash
Driving fast shit

Got 40 pointers on my bezel
VVS's on a whole nother level
Pouring mud not measured
A thousand bruises counting presidents
Yeah I got bad habits
OG gas bags in the attic
In the basement
In the cabinet
Got a bad habit thumbing through Jacksons
Got a bad habit shitting no laxative
Foreign hoes sucking dick no relaxing
I know the nat nat hoes

Got bad habits I can't handle it
Bad habits take a nigga

[Verse 2: MPA Wicced]
That bullshit you got on crappy
Plus it's lightweight
My diamonds crushed out
And my shit on ice tray
Depending on how I feel
I might buy DB9 today
Diamonds shine like the sun
VV 1's no ricochet
All these bad habits I got
Bitch I'm still paid
Laughing at you suckers
Behind the dark Marc Jacob shades
Your girl she dig flavor
Something I can't help it
Yeah bitch, I already look wealthy
Take a look get a picture, selfie
Yeah bitch I'm one hell of a nigga can't you tell it?
Yeah, I ain't selfish
My whole team is
Everybody ball bitch
Ain't no such thing on the bleachers

[Hook]

Yeah I'm running through these hoes
Marcy Fawcett
Lean done took over the molly
I feel like everybody watching
I'm a geeked up folk
And mind still on the dollars
I don't turn shit down nigga
But my collar
If the player about that money
We'll handle that problem
Make them hits on the phone
While your wifey blow job me
And I damn show hope
The hell yall ain't kissing that
Because I be skeeting
Right where her dentures at

[Hook]
