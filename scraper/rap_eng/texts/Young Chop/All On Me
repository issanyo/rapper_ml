[Hook: Lil Breeze]
I get mad money, it's throwing a temper tantrum
Your bitch all on me, she said that I'm very handsome
But ain't no time for romancin', ice all on my Rolex dancin'
Long way from public housing, now I got to get a mansion

[Hook: Lil Breeze]
I get mad money, it's throwing a temper tantrum
Your bitch all on me, she said that I'm very handsome
But ain't no time for romancin', ice all on my Rolex dancin'
Long way from public housing, now I got to get a mansion

[Verse 1: Lil Breeze]
Ain't no way out, I'm too deep in this shit
Can't hear I'm talking, money machine it be beeping and shit
Pop out the cut, yeah you know I be creeping and shit
Breeze out here making bands, why you sleeping and shit?
I be trapping so damn hard, fell asleep in the whip
Hustle hard around the clock and make them Benjamins flip
The studio my second home, yeah I be making them hits
But when that kitchen water whippin', watch the flick of the wrist
You know lil bitch is casting out
I'm the nigga this bitch is talking 'bout
My time, ain't no time for timing out
Lil Breeze don't fuck with you haters now
If you play about my money
Consequences, repercussions
Straight action, ain't no discussion
On the news, shown to the public

[Hook: Lil Breeze]
I get mad money, it's throwing a temper tantrum

[Verse 2: Lud Foe]
She just called me sucker
I fuck her but I don't love her
A nigga always be cuffing
That nigga's an undercover
Can't wife her, no I can't trust her
Won't fuck her under the covers
Might pass her off to my brothers
I smash your ho then I duck her
She told me take off the rubber
You stupid lil motherfucker
I got more rhymes than Busta
These bullets burn you like Usher
In the foreign, call it ketchup
Bucket seats, call it mustard
Paramedics pick the mess up
P got hit with the rest
Pussy niggas always running they mouth, fuck a discussion
Call my shooters they gon' run in your house and get to bustin'
We got TEC-9's, MAC-10's, designer guns, FN
I got redbones, yellowbones, fuck her and her best friend
