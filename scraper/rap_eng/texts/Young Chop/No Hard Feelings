[Hook]
You takin' chances when you ridin' without a slammer
Another day another dollar another hour (our world)
We got guns that'll leave you truly blessed (pray for em)
Yo momma told you not to leave the nest (aye)
No hard feelings, No hard feelings
No hard feelings, No hard feelings
No hard feelings, No hard feelings
No hard feelings, No hard feelings

[Verse]
We got 50's that'll leave ya crib wrecked (aye)
But I suggest it's 30 leave ya life blessed
It's a habit that I smoke like stress (pray for em')
But you gambling with ya self if ya life not chanced
Takin' chances boy this shit can be a challenge (turn up)
Playin with these guns boys lets see you miss ya family
I'm attracted to the money fuck a Mitch
We can fuck around and love but I ain't tryna have a wedding
But no hard feelings, No hard feelings
This Glock I bet we gotta leave ya heart filled in
No hard feelings, No hard feelings
Try to send some shots I hope you dodge wit em

[Hook]
