[Intro]
Batesville, Arkansas, population 400
It's ya boy Yung Liar
Shoutout to all my "fake it to ya make it"-niggas
All my niggas tell a bitch anything to get the pussy
I'm with you homie

[Hook x2]
I got a Lamborghini and a helicopter
Fifty thousand in my duffle looking hella proper

[Bridge x4]
I'm talking about
Cash, cash, cash

[Verse 1]
Got a mansion on that hill
Nigga ask Dr. Phil
These diamonds around my neck
Flawless costing half a mill
Five swizzle calls
I ain't even swizz
I ball a Kobe, homie
Shit I don't ever miss
Four passports
A hundrer and twenty stamps
I own a foot locker
And a couple champs
Check my red bottoms
Nigga that's real blood
Got them jet skis
Just in case it floods
My bank count so swollen
My pockets got the most
My front did it, my natives nigga
I ain't got no time for you chumps
The king of diamonds, we ball
Meeting Wayne, baby that's all
Tell the bitch what she wanna hear
Fuck, quick nut and now comb
Hueeerrhh
I'm just living like a boss
Blowing money fast, call me Ricky Ross
When you're rich, bitch
Trust that time fly
I never tell the truth
I just be telling lies

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I've got front seats in the game
Players know my name
Even [?] and Spike Lee
Say Liar he got game
In the studio with Wayne
Even did a verse with Game
Beats By Dre in every color
Just to match my frame (Red, white and blue!)
Ten thousand in my newest Louis bag
Gator everything I know that make them haters mad
Got my name in that bitch
That make it mine
[?]
Just to tell the time
Hueeerrhh
I know them haters want to take my spot
I'm so rich I land my helicopter on a yacht
And when I land man I'm hopping out with twenty hoes
All bad bitches
That's how I roll
Put your hands in the air if you know you're fly
Put em down if that's a straight motherfucking lie
Yu-Yu-Yung Liar from the basement to the roof
I got rich in this bitch cause I never told the truth

[Hook + Bridge]

Hueeerrhh
