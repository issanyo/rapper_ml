[Intro]
Yea
The vibes so crazy right now

[Verse 1]
I'm off the lean I got super powers
Dive in that pussy like scuba divers
Hop out all black like a uber driver
Wlid the whole trap like wood supplies
Yo' IG Jim Carrey, you liar liar
I'm in the hoe like the other side
I got it right now and I can't retire, yea

[Hook 1]
This is the shit they ride to
This is what you drink and get high to
This is the shit you niggas don't get
They ride and I'ma ride to
When I get dressed I got super powers
What's in my cup give me super powers
Niggas tell tales, and they super silent
I'm in my zone, I got super powers
Super powers, super powers
I swear I can take over the world
Super powers, I got super powers, I got super powers
I swear I can take over the world (Let's get it!)

[Verse 2]
Bankroll like Bruce Banner, pour a 8 I need two fantas
Coke body on a pretty woman, new car police scanner
Nail a opp with only 1 hammer, bullets burn â€˜em like a sun tan
Watch me whip it like the nae nae dance,                                          car feeling like it's superman
15 thousand on the back end, all black on me like I'm batman
Ain't no robbin', that's a joke man
Green light then it's go whip
That's a drill in case it's bussin'
Bad bitches wanna touch herself
She just wanna make love or somethin'
Convos 'bout where're ya from
Super powers got me high too
Made it out cause I had to
Threw the Chi like a DM
Hood love me when I slide threw
Couple hundreds on my denims
And these shoes ain't coming out
Swagger got a nigga 'bout to fly
Taking off with these super powers

[Hook 2]
This is the shit they ride to
This is what you drink and get high to
This is the shit you niggas don't get
They ride and I'ma ride to
When I get dressed I got super powers
What's in my cup give me super powers
Niggas tell tales, and they super silent
I'm in my zone, I got super powers
Super powers, super powers
I swear I can take over the world
Super powers, I got super powers, I got super powers
I swear I can take over the world

[Verse 3]
Xans in my water, can't feel myself
I wish I had powers just to heal myself
Remember them nights I'd kill myself
And now I got thoughts just to be the best
The labels ain't believe me, had to prove myself
Dthang you know, nigga you was there
People left who said they wouldn't
For the niggas I lost I'd take a bullet
Run up on me now I wish you pull it
OTF my empire nigga without a cookie
30 fo' a show, tell them niggas book it
I'm tired of niggas lookin' at me like a rookie
Shark in the water on the deep end
House in the hills like the Weeknd
Only like to party on the weekend
Only like real, fuck pretend
Thank God for my mama
Thank the Lord for my brothers
We gonna take on the world
So she can be my super woman
I'ma get this super money
I'ma turn up with these super powers yea yea

[Hook 2]
This is the shit they ride to
This is what you drink and get high to
This is the shit you niggas don't get
They ride and I'ma ride to
When I get dressed I got super powers
What's in my cup give me super powers
Niggas tell tales, and they super silent
I'm in my zone, I got super powers
Super powers, super powers
I swear I can take over the world
Super powers, I got super powers, I got super powers
I swear I can take over the world
