[Intro: G Herbo]
Young Chop on the beat
G Herbo
You know I'm a street nigga--real street nigga and that's common sense
Everybody know you 'posed to get money, stay out the way

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Lookin' down the barrel of that hammer for my last time
Made me slow down, look at life
Why I'm just gon' give you mine?
'09 I was doin' fine
Broke as fuck, school shirts, on the bus
Since I been gettin' paper, shit ain't holdin' up
I never break nigga, fold for what?
Every day I wake, still gotta load it up
Roll it up
If you throwin' Bs, nigga, hold it up
Niggas know what up
If you book me for a show, know I sold it up
Soon as he pull up through the back of the door, got them poles wit' us
And I'm froze as fuck
Only pick up 10K bankrolls and up
10K, that's a backend
Pull a hunnid racks out the bank, put it back in
Be safe if you lackin'
How 'bout blow the whole 30 shots and get back in?
Keep your head up in the rack then
Yeah, okay, get whacked then
Better have eyes in your back then
Better keep the strap on your lap then
Better keep your homies on Essex then
I'm just gon' put one up in yo' chest then
Better go invest in a vest then
Okay, we givin' face shots, nothin' less than
On the block 24, no restin'
Stand over niggas, drop 10 out FNs
I don't give a fuck, I done lost my best friend
All this money must be why I'm stressed then
Too many times I was close to death in the streets
I'ma keep gridin', keep gettin' checks in
Gotta kill by any means
Enemy next to me
I can't accept defeat
Pickin' up three backends every weekend, that's a least 60 racks a week, nigga

[Chorus: G Herbo]
Alleys, corners, hallways
Placin' orders all day
Posted wit' them pistols out there all day
I been wit' my niggas out there all day
Alleys, corners, hallways
Placin' orders all day
Posted wit' them pistols out there all day
I been wit' my niggas out there all day

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
Everything I gotta grind for
You know I work hard for mines, bro
They showed me love when I was broke, then they changed when I signed, bro
Everybody turn their back on me
Swear to God, that's a fact homie
At first them niggas they was black wit' me, then they went a little black on me
They got a little more dogs
I got a little more smart
I backed away from that bullshit, then I got a little more far
I'm the most gangster nigga from my city
I don't wanna know 'cause it ain't my business
I don't give a fuck about her feelings
Fuck that bitch I don't want that bitch, I don't want dealings
I was in a drug bust wit' my dope on the backseat
Gun on the front seat wit' my ankle bracelet on my feet
I been on the block all day
Shot a nigga in the hallway
Have you ever ran in the corner store, pulled a stickup broad day?
Shout out grandma 'cause she put me out
Shout out every nigga ever [?] me out
Same nigga threw a cross at me, same nigga that ain't wit' me now
Same niggas when I went to jail, they ain't make my bond
Same bitch broke bad when I did time
Same nigga fucked my bitch when I was on the run

[Chorus: G Herbo]
Alleys, corners, hallways
Placin' orders all day
Posted wit' them pistols out there all day
I been wit' my niggas out there all day
Alleys, corners, hallways
Placin' orders all day
Posted wit' them pistols out there all day
I been wit' my niggas out there all day
