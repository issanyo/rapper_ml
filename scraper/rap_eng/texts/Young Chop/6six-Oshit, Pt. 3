This that 6ix Oshit (uhh)
Just to let you know bitch
Okay, I say

Verse 1:
I just fucked your bitch
And blew her back out
Then I pulled her tracks out
But that shit so-so and I be knowing
So I act out
Get paper I'm a cash cow
Sit your stupid ass down
Love the sounds of mac rounds
Doofie niggas class clowns (Doofie ass nigga)
Ima tip her
She a stripper
Play with water
Just like flipper
That's your bitch
I'm trying to dick her
Remy, Henny off the liquor
Bullets hit you let it simmer
Play with with pistols in the winter
Niggas telling Master Splinter (Aye)
Niggas rest they Master Splinter
Out in traffic with them blickers
Always been one of them niggas (uuh)
Always been one of them niggas
Diamonds on me cost six figures
Bitch get back off find your nigga
Ima Chicago gorilla

Where the fuck was your antennas

Earrings pissy like a tinkle
We bring pistols to your venue

Baby this shit is so simple

Diamonds do the percolator
Pistol jerkin make a hater
Brizzle bitch I smell like paper
Baby candy now and later
