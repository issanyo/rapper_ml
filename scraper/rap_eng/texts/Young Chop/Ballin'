[Hook: Johnny May Cash]
You losing. Damn right you losing
Keep the pole on me won't catch me snoozin
And these bitches they be choosing
Stacking money to the ceiling, bitch we balling

[Verse 1: King Rell]
You losing, damn right you losing
And These niggas tryna copy my swag buy they might lose it
Cause I'm balling. And this money steady calling
So you know what I gotta do: I'ma flex on you
Pull a brand new coup if you only knew
The things that I would do and my niggas they'll shoot
And we balling. Damn right we balling
And I got your bitch, she steady stalking
And if you only knew the things that she do
Taking off the clothes off that what she do
Cause our money grew. And we balling
And these other niggas ain't on nothing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YB]

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Got me balling we call em out we all in

On parole, I can't sip lean, that purple syrup it gotta tempt me

And I'm riding off in that foreign
And these old hoes they boring
