Listen

[Verse 1]
I be reppin' 24, kick in the door tell them give me the cash
It's easy for me to get racks, nigga just give me some gloves and a mask
Y'all niggas need coke, y'all niggas need weed? Call me, we got it on deck
Your hoe don't show you respect, she be kissing you after giving me neck (Mwuah!)
She knows I'm the best, we ride through the west while i got my hand up her dress
I'm so legendary, fuck her missionary and then I'ma bust on her chest (Ho)
Nigga I'm ATM, addicted to money bitch I gotta have it
I'm on top like an attic and you know my gun is fully automatic
Stop being dramatic, if you're looking for me then nigga come get me
Chugging a Henny, MOB, hoes ain't getting a penny (Na)
Ya bitches is bummy, I'm chasing the money, leave you in the dust (Skrrt)
I've been that nigga since middle school, rolling up weed in the back of the bus
Man most of y'all niggas is fake, y'all boys ain't ready to squeeze (Pussy)
What you know about jumping a gate when crackers is telling you "freeze"?
What you know bout' hitting a lick and buying a whip cash?
Y'all niggas ain't getting no guap, the work on your block, straight trash (Haan)
This shit is so simple, pop you like a pimple, I'll leave your family crying
And man none of my Polos be wrinkled, but i stay with the iron
Nigga i was 18 counting 30 racks
Running up in niggas houses while you selling packs
So the money you make in a year, i make that shit in 20 minutes (Quick!)
And your hoe know i get it, I'm in a backseat getting head like a fitted (Brain)
24 Gs all we do is blow trees
Fuck these thots, make that cheese
Niggas tryna kill me but i don't care, y'all ain't no killas y'all bust in the air
Me fight you? You know it ain't fair, smash yo bitch while i pull on her hair
Flex on my ex when i get these checks, fuck one bitch and i scream "who's next?!"
Yea, the strap I'm carrying, y'all niggas shoot ugly like Marion
J-Starz these hoes know me, 24 on my back, call me Kobe
Nigga run up, I'll let the heat squirt, have pictures of you on your homeboys shirt (RIP)
Always look clean cause i stay doing dirt
Yo bitch wilding out, lifting up her skirt
Rhymes hotter than the summer, [?] be forgetting
Don't ask me where I'm, you know what the fuck I'm reppin'
