[Hook]
Blowin' smoke like locomotive in a slower motion
Spectacular with my wordplay, need that lubricated lotion
I'm a one handed man, I'm in and out but bitch I goes in
I'm all in my feet, my toes and like Jet Lee bitch I'm the chosen
If she ain't choose up on me, she owe me one, she owe me one
All I want in my life is peace like Jesus man, the holy one
I'm waiting on time, bitch I'm in Time Square
I'll be on time I swear to God only if God swears

[Verse]
I'm one of the best doing this shit, but that's given though
I don't shoot many videos cause my life is too visual
I'm a gangster, bring it back like a residual
I'm kissin' on the microphone, I like to keep it simple ho
I told Vic to turn up the metronome, I got the rhythm yo
That's my nigga there by the way, hey, hand that endless though
I ain't worried bout friends as far as friendships go
I be staring at my ends, run to me pigeon toed
I hope you got your cleats baby, hope you got your cleats
Been doin' to it too much, you niggas too weak
In that old school that '73, rest in peace to Bruce Lee
Ain't nobody cool as me, I treat the beat like through streets
Run through it, I do it so fluent like fluid
I see you niggas doing a lot, they can't do it like I do it
If you can't do it like I do it, then prove it in your music
I'm looking at the scoreboard and it's provin' I ain't losin'
Before you hate on somebody and what they doing, look into it
Like a crystal ball you change colors like rings that's moody
Twisting up the Scooby-dooby, chilling with a cutie cutie
She know the way to my heart, shorty with the hugest booty
I like a lot of sex, I keep going back to my ex
Shooting flix like it's Net, I drive her crazy like Corvettes
It's like we're playing freeze tag, I'm frozen and she wet
Got two fingers on her, playing with her like a Tech Deck

[Hook]
Blowin' smoke like locomotive in a slower motion
Spectacular with my wordplay, need that lubricated lotion
I'm a one handed man, I'm in and out but bitch I goes in
I'm all in my feet, my toes and like Jet Lee bitch I'm the chosen
If she ain't choose up on me, she owe me one, she owe me one
All I want in my life is peace like Jesus man, the holy one
I'm waiting on time, bitch I'm in Time Square
I'll be on time I swear to God only if God swears
