I'm 'bout to kill that mothafucka
I'm smoking killer mothafucka
I be with some killers mothafucka
They won't hesitate to kill you mothafucka
Pull up then I kill you mothafucka
Smokin' paraphernalia mothafucka
My watch and necklace it be killin' mothafucka
Tryna take it, I'll kill you mothafucka

[Verse 1]
Cock back, kill him, kill him, kill him
Pulled up, take his bitch, I made him mad, I killed him
Pulled up on his block, slide the van doors back then kill him
2-4 bitch, no stacking, we killed him
Like Terio, Ooh kill him
Like Cheerios put holes in him
Ainâ€™t no squares in this Hula Hoop nigga
They like Sosa you the truth nigga
Please don't disrespect my niggas
They shootin' up playgrounds and venues
Killing every race and every witness
That was talking shit but we can't hear it
I don't say much but put me on the track, I'll kill it
Smokin' on very strong thing that'll kill me
Nigga told me his opinion and I killed him
Before you take this jewelry you'll have to kill me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Kill him, kill him, kill him
Come through killing shit, bitch just like kill bill nem
We got Glocks and they will gon' steal him
Niggas flexin' all on Instagram, call it Killgram
Cause we gon' come thru killin'
Me and a bunch of villains
Can't no superheroes save him
Cause they can't stop these bullets
This dope so good like I cooked it
My money so long cause I built it
Bitch I'm at the top, over looking
And I'm killing all of these pussies
That bitch let me hit and I killed it
And didn't leave a witness
And she didn't forget me
Cause right now, she hittin' me
I swear this bitch gon' kill me
And my fucking battery
Came in and the game killed it
I guess that's why niggas mad at me
They gon' have to kill me
And whoever wit' me
Cause they rollin' with me
And we totin' 50's
