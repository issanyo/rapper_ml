Chorus
Late night catch me leaving with my AK
Keep it wit me at all times case you wanna play
Keep a chappa in da trunk fa emergencies home boy
AK and chappas dats da shit dat made me
Dats dat shit dat made me
Dats dat shit dat made me
AK"s and chappas dats dat shit dat made me

[verse 1]
I went to da bando and whiped dat baby
Had to bag it up and sell it
And make dat gravy
[Chorus]
