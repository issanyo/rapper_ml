(Intro)
Fuck niggas tryna kick it?
We don't play that
You wanna shoot a pistol?
We don't play that
Get the fuck from round me I don't play that shit my nigga
Lil Mouse what's popping? hahaha
How a lil nigga only 13 and he more cutthroat than most of you grown niggas man
That's a fucking shame
Bitch ass niggas

[Hook]
Fuck niggas in my gang, we don't play that (we don't play that)
Fuck nigga tryna hang, we don't play that (we don't play that)
We won't let a chopper bang, we don't play that (we don't play that)
You can't claim what I claim, we don't play that (we don't play that)
We don't play that (we don't play that) x5
Fuck niggas in my gang, we don't play that (we don't play that)
Fuck nigga tryna hang, we don't play that (we don't play that)

[Doe Boy]
We won't let a chopper bang (We don't play that)
Only shooters in my gang (we don't play that)
We don't fuck with law and lames (we don't play that)
You ain't on the same thang (we don't play that)
You ain't with the savage life
This ain't what you bout
You can't hang with the gang when that gun sound
Fuck niggas not allowed so don't come round
Shoot the crowd
Thirty round
Lay thirty niggas down
I can tell that you a snitch, we don't play that (we don't play that)
I can tell that you a bitch, we don't play that (we don't play that)
You ain't down to hit a lick, we don't play that (we don't play that)
You ain't down to squeeze a clip, we don't play that (we don't play that)
(You think I'm playing?)

(Hook)

[Lil Mouse]
11-9 thug niggas, we don't play that
Bring the K and the Mac where you lay at
Tryna diss me on the track, I don't play that
My niggas in the cut, where you stay at
Call broski up and tell him where you stay at
Front door, kick in, where the cake at?
Choppa bake his ass up we don't play that
I always be strapped like latex
TayTay call me up like where you stay at?
Finna run up in his house and knock his face back
Kidnap yo mamma, with the K man
Call his ass up, like payback
