Less for you and more for me
Less for you and more for me yeah
(cuz I)

I talk so much cash I swear this kid 'bout to be rich
Designa on my body while these lames rockin that fitted
Can't worry 'bout no ho, you know there's more fish in the sea
All these hoes who took my lines, I guess there's plenty fish for me
Ever since I was a young'un all I wanted was a cash bag
My uncle always told me if you ain't in first then you in last class
[?] I can't let no hater pass me
Now I'm in the building kicking more shit then a sensei
Turnt up I got [?]
Zach be on that [?]
Hoes [?] They ain't know it's me
Cuz my bass knock when I ride slow
Flow sharper than a pinecone
Bound to blow I'm a timebomb
Your girl just gave me brain, now she can't think straight. Guess her mind blown

[Hook]
If you ain't hungry, you don't want it. Less for you and more for me
Polo drawers showing, Supra Tennies on my feet
Kept me moving slow motion but my lifestyle up to speed
Throwing parties by the ocean, taking models out to eat (now)

Less for you and more for me
Less for you and more for me bae
Less for you and more for me
Less for you and more for me now

Bitches popping molly in my 'rarri, they some freaks
I'm geeked up off that oxy plus a hint of Hennessy
One just called me Papi while she count my money, keep it coming
Dropped a hundred on that kitty, and now them cats are under me
And once you feed a pussy {meow} that can't won't ever leave
It's all about that money, can't stand next to me for free
I was taught if there's a problem, it's ok to let it speak
I ain't with the violence, I'm just trying to keep the peace
But I promise if you try my little friend I'm hard to reach
And if Hugo's to my side, you know you fucking with a beast
You still sleep on pallets, now my house look like a golden palace
Living lavish [?]
My phone be getting rowdy, yeah we higher than a bitch
For us it's getting cloudy, yeah we flyer than a bitch
And I know you see me swaggin', yeah I'm styling in this bitch
And I know you see that IG, always smiling with your bitch
There's no lie, it's kind of hard to keep these hoes tied to a leash
I told Chris to take his pick, there's one for you and four for me {yeah}

[Hook]

Rapper's be [?]
Murder a track and then [?]
[?]
Diamonds on deck, you a gusher to me
Tell the whole world you can front page this
Lying on Zach, could of [?] this
Take you a lifetime just to make one hit
All I needed was change, it'd make more sense

And now I'm almost rich yeah

[Hook]
