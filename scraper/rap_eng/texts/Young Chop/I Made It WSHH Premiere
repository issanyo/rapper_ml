[Intro]

Young Chop on the Beat

Told them amma make it
Broke niggas ain't gonna

[Hook 1]

There Hate already made me feel
Am in already
I came from nothing, climbing
To the top I've made it already
They wanna, I already feel it
Already

Made it already, (alreadyyy)
I've made it, I've made it
I've made it, I've made it
Am Popping Bottles
Am Faded

[Verse 1]

Niggas saying I've made it
Got these Niggas hating
Money team I swear Form life
My Bank erased me
Juelada a Top
Top spot that am making
Rondo got that 30,and that
Bruner go crazy
But they ain't really worried
About us
How they got beef, and ain't heard
About us
Shennal bell match the red bottoms
The way judie get the bread out em
Strip Club Throwing Couple thousands
You can see their face when the bread piling
Shooting 50 with the swirl hiring
Broke ass nigga would be cab driving
Everyday Foreign car from different
Countries, all these Bad Bitches, getting
Different moneys
If you Niggas Hating go and get some money
If you Niggas Hating go and get some money

[Hook]

They heard that I made it
I hate em' for hating
I changed the Mac crazy
Why the fuck you got a stainless
And I started from the bottom
Why the fuck are they hating on me
Long time ago, head home to snack
Home, No diaper to strap on
Because its hard out here rich nigga
Let you starve out here
You got to play your part out here
Can't let them play your cards out here
Because I've made it
Its a celebration
Why the fuck they hating on me
All the fancy cars, fancy cloths
Fancy hoes, I've got it
Everything I got right now as a Kid
I could not imagine
And I got to have it, My shooters
Tote tagging
And you niggas might win
But my niggas so priceless
And yall on the like shit
Red bottoms, fuck all that
Mic shit
I made us on all the right shit
Yeah am arrogant,because I've made it

[Hook]
