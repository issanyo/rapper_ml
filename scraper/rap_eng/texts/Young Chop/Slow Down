[Verse 1]
Don't waste my time, all these petty ass bitches steady lying
I check my rollie what's the time, it's six o'clock, that bitch got mad at me at five
I got all this bread in my pocket bitch
No credit cards, I pay cash for it
Took a long time to get where I'm at
Hundred k under my mattress yeah

I need to slow down, I got too much money on me right now

[Chorus]
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time bitch, take your time bitch, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time bitch, take your time bitch, take your time
Slow down

[Verse 2]
This shit cost a lot
I just bought your [?] that new Mercedes drop
Now bitch I want the neck, we finna go to Cuba on a jet
It's just me and you, what you wanna do

Coz baby I need to slow down, I got too much money on me right now

[Chorus]
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time
Slow down
Take your time, take your time, take your time

Take your time bitch, take your time bitch, take your time
Slow down

Slow down
Take your time bitch, take your time bitch, take your time
