[Hook: Chief Keef]
I can't lose bitch, I'm so used to winnin'
Fuck with my family and you are finished
And bitch we at the top,wWe so used to winnin'
Bodies gettin' dropped, we so used to winnin'
Ridin' wit my niggas we be cruising tinted
Catch up bitch, We so used to winnin'
Every day double digits, We so used to winnin'
Pull on yo block let off some shots, we so used to winnin'

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Sosa bout that gun smoke
Smoke kush smoke you don't know
Ridin' round wit my young niggas
Young niggas that's gone blow
Flow sick shit gold coast
Smoke grade A honor roll
Bad bitches by the bungalow
Real niggas honor those
Playing Louie, I'm gang banging
Bad bitch twerk dancin'
Motherfuckas tryna play us

Fuck with us and them guns blow
Gun ranges and gun shows
Rob you for your coco

Going crazy and see me

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Kush to strong with a thick bitch
She Like Chief Keef and play his shit
When we ridin' smokin'
Type of shit like I'm Logan and a [?]
My young g's stay iron holdin'
Pink champagne and some golden
New Ray Bans let me unfold em
Just cashed out so I'm holdin'
Gotta lot of Nenes I be rollin'
Bitches pop pills like Ibuprofen
Niggas say they ballin' but I be coachin'
Don't get bitched now nobody know'em
I be with young wild niggas idhome
I love pussy but I prefer dome
Money come fast like my 4S phone
I pack loud smoking strechers long
Hit it call me shorty bird strechers on
I'm winnin' bitch I'm a champion
Pack louder than a ambulance
Money dance bitch hella bands
Just might cuff some F ends
Soon as they drop in advance
These niggas losing
No D, second chance
