[Intro: Lil Durk]
Yeah
Feel like a celebration
I made it. (They mad!)
Told them I'ma make it!

[Hook: Lil Durk]
They hatin' already
Make me feel like I made it already
I came from nothin'
Climb to the top cuz I made it already
They ain't wanna believe me
I'm their favorite already
Cars and hoes and jewels and clothes
I made it already
I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
I'm poppin' bottles, I'm faded
I made it, I made it

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Niggas say I made it
Got these niggas hatin'
Money team
I swear it feels like a bank arrangement
Who'd a thought, the top spot
That I would make it
Rondo got that 30
And broke niggas go crazy
But I ain't really worried bout em
Already got beef and we ain't hear about em
Chanel belt match the red bottoms
She wants you to get the bread out here
Tell the club to throw a couple thousand
You could see that face on the brick or thousand
See these 50's with the swearholic
Broke ass nigga, turn to cab drivers
Everything foreign
Come from different countries
All these bad bitches
Gettin' different money
If you niggas hatin'
Go and get some money
If you niggas hatin'
Go and get some money (Squad!)

[Hook: Lil Durk]
They hatin' already
Make me feel like I made it already
I came from nothin'
Climb to the top cuz I made it already
They ain't wanna believe me
I'm they favorite already
Cars and hoes and jewels and clothes
I made it already
I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
I'm poppin' bottles, I'm faded
I made it, I made it

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They hatin', I made it
I hate em for hatin'
"I changed my mind"
Crazy, why the fuck you got statements
And I started from the bottom
Why the fuck they hatin' on me?
Long time ago
Had nothin' to snack on
Had nobody to lean my back on
No dyke, put ya strap on
Cuz its hard out here
Rich nigga left to starve out here
Gotta play ya part out here
Can't let em put ya cards out here
Cuz I made it
Its a celebration
Why the fuck they hatin' on me?
(Let's get it!)
All the fancy cars
Fancy clothes
Fancy hoes
I got it
Everything I got right now
As a kid I couldn't imagine
And I gotta have it
My shootas toe taggin'
And you niggas might win
But my nigga's soul priceless
And y'all on the light shit
Red bottoms, fuck all that mike shit
I made this song, iont write shit
Yeah I'm arrogant
Cuz I made it

[Hook: Lil Durk]
They hatin' already
Make me feel like I made it already
I came from nothin'
Climb to the top cuz I made it already
They ain't wanna believe me
I'm they favorite already
Cars and hoes and jewels and clothes
I made it already
I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
I'm poppin' bottles, I'm faded
I made it, I made it
