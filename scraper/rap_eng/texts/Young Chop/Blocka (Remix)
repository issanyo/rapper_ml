[Intro]

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I got dollars on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka

[Verse: Dre The Weirdo]
Smoking ganja like a rasta
With my niggas on that blocka
Yeah, they posted like some fucking shottas
Fuck your feelings, I'm a reach my weapons
Grinding for them diamonds that be shining, like my girl's skin complexion
Ha! Man this shit right here amazing
Rolling doobies, yeah we blazing
Fuck that hoe man she be playing
Money clocks so I don't waste time
Mysterious mind
Bars hard, you wanna press rewind
You better preach what you practice
Getting benjamins is a habit
She gave me top like an attic
While I was rolling up in traffic
Four door, enough to fit three more
Two knocking at your door
They got you on the floor

[Hook: Travis Scott]
