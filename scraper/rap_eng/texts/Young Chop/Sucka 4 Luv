No, I can't even deny it
I wanna hop on you private
Your mouth is a whole 'nother climate
You gotta try it, a whole 'nother diet
They calling me King David Junior

The way I be carrying the moolah
Watching your bitch while she give me madulla
She don't fuck all my friends, no no
'Bout to go do it again, no no
Wanted to marry the bitch, but I can't take all this shit
I was in love and convinced, Scrap to get back to crossing this shit
