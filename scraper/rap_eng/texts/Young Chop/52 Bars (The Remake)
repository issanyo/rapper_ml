Fuck on
30 30’s with 3, 3 niggas we dirty
I got my shooters they shooting
We show them niggas no mercy
From the pot to the block, from the block to
The lot
I gotta duck from the ops, they be too cool
With the cops
See my life like a movie, I call it case for the
Tully
The judge giving out 10, I ain’t scared I do it
So if a nigga run upon me, I react with a uzi
If a nigga run upon me, I react with a uzi Niggas needed his Friend, I still need'em right
Now
He doing life in the fed, need that appeal right
Now
I catch a body I’m gone, I’m dipping right out
Of town
I see the scout who told is getting peeled right
Now
K’s up till i die, blood, sweat and some tears
Death jam they send me, complete by kid as a
Dream
Got locked up to my niggas, They thinking life was
A gift
Told my ma I’m on tv, MTV I’m the shit
I hit the stain on some bricks, I can’t look
Back on my hit
I can’t look back on these bricks, I guess
Disease’s direct
One did it and spread, wb 64, all that riding is
Dead
I’m putting 9 to his head
Lil rocks that’s for attempt, lawyer money I
Got em
If he can’t hold that weight, he best believe
I’ma spot em
I can’t sit in the street, and let my lil niggas
Rott All black like I’m bruce, so who you think
That was robbing
And they drive my advance, I’am cop me up 6
I’ma carry a fans
And I’ma cop me a benz
I got polo and Gucci, 40 cal Glock 10’s
Mama told me you will make it, but you can’t
Make it in
I’ma trap it to rock it, real niggas from the blocks
Same people was fans, they use to say in the
Factor
I’m on top of the city, so them rumors ain’t
Matter
8 balls the size of baseballs in the field, I’m a
Batter
A nigga try to kill me dead, I cops bring me in
Like the covers set me nah, the niggas won’t
Win again
The judge told me eye of eye, po riding on her
End He caught with another slammer, they say
They first offered 10
I can’t change up like a penny, I want head just
Like a penny
You won’t catch me in the tellie, catch me in
Back of the Bentley
Niggas know I’m …shit, niggas know we killing
Shit
