[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Out of town bitch got a fat booty
My light skinned bitch always actin' bougie
My ex bitch mad I ain't fuckin' with her
I ain't fuckin' with her

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got a bitch in every city, that's on God
Pushaz Inc, we run the city, that's on God
We pull up to the club in helicopters
I don't fuck with rap niggas, I fuck models
All my bitches drive Ranges and Ferraris
Got a Spanish bitch and she call me Papi
I just fucked this nigga's bitch and I ain't sorry
I let her ride my thing like a Harley
She came to kiss a rich dick in the W suite
I blow on that weed, she suckin' on me
Bust a nut, then I get up, then I gotta go
Gotta get dough, gotta get more

[Verse 2: Cap 1]
Got a bad bitch in LA, man that's on God
And my chick from 305, man she's so raw
And my redbone, she do whatever I want
And my ex mad, she just mad cause I don't want her
I got these bitches callin' back to back
And pullin' at the trap tryna figure where the fuck I'm at
But I'm outchea chasin' stacks and tryna bring it back
And run up a check just to stay on the map
(And my out of town chick got a fat booty
Told her bring her girlfriend, let's make a movie)
And she gotta know, she told me she need me
She wanna see me, told her that I believe it
She landed later on this evenin' to see me, come beat it
She said that I'm on her mind, she think of me all the time
Told her, "Don't get me with lies", she said "No that's on my life"
