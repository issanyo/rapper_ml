[Chorus: Young Chop]
Ay keep it movin' nigga
'Cuz all my niggas ya they fuckin' shooters nigga
All my niggas brains, ya they coo-coo nigga
And bitch we ride down your block just to shoot a nigga
And all you niggas tellin' when the folks come
And when they snatch my niggas we don't know nothin'
Y'all niggas better play it cool
I got some killas in the D too

[Verse 1: Snap Dogg]
Hit a nigga block, just to catch him up
Heard a nigga snitchin' so I had to wet him up
Choppa do a nigga [?], I don't give a fuck
You ain't playin' with no rookies boy, we the first to bust
You playin' tough, hoe nigga, like we ain't on your head
I'm gonna beat this nigga ass so he gonna end up dead
Oh shit, can't say too much, 'cuz the nigga Fed
And I ain't gonna shoot the little bastard 'cuz I know he scared
You done fucked up and let me bring the hittas out
They don't do no tweet-for-tweet, they pull up to your house
Drag your ass off that bitch so we can scrap it ou
And make you beg for your life before I pop you out
Why these niggas wanna play like I ain't kill shit?
This ain't them shells that hit your ass, you gonna feel this
Word around the city you need niggas to have your back
Well I'mma take this nigga chain, run and tell that

[Chorus: Young Chop]
Ay keep it movin' nigga
'Cuz all my niggas ya they fuckin' shooters nigga
All my niggas brains, ya they coo-coo nigga
And bitch we ride down your block just to shoot a nigga
And all you niggas tellin' when the folks come
And when they snatch my niggas we don't know nothin'
Y'all niggas better play it cool
I got some killas in the D too

[Verse 2: Snap Dogg]
Fuckin' with them killas from the Chi to the D
Chop going crazy, actin' up on the beat
Durk can hit my line if it's ever any beef
Put a pillow over his head (bow, bow!) while he sleep
Niggas talkin' rats, where I'm from show some
Pussy got a pole and he ain't gonna blow no
They say Snap, you got the facts, ya that boy know something
Where I'm from we tote them pistols we don't do it for no frontin'
Unk said 'stop, don't reply to what they said'
Hell ya Unk, I forgot he special ed
Next time beat this nigga ass, like he read
Keep on squeezin' on that nigga 'til the blood out his head

[Chorus: Young Chop]
Ay keep it movin' nigga
'Cuz all my niggas ya they fuckin' shooters nigga
All my niggas brains, ya they coo-coo nigga
And bitch we ride down your block just to shoot a nigga
And all you niggas tellin' when the folks come
And when they snatch my niggas we don't know nothin'
Y'all niggas better play it cool
I got some killas in the D too
