I only trust certain jewelers, niggas be sellin' you fake diamonds
You lil niggas pay homage, I left my arm then I changed climates

I'm puttin' numbers on the board (Board)
All the hustlers, they applaud (They applaud)
They caught me sneakin' in paraphernalia every time I come to the awards
If I want him hit, the killers get sent, and then they come for the rewards
Pocket rocket cause the pocket watchers wanna see what's comin' out of yours
Poured a four before I board a plane, took a PJ, I got bored of planes
