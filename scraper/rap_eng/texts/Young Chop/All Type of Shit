[Hook]
Baby I got pounds, baby I got bricks
I got 50s 100s, all type of shit
I got 50s 100s, all type of clips
However you want it, all type of shit
I got all the hoes, all type of whips
I had all type of cribs, all type of shit
I did this at a young age
Now I'm ridin' down the 1 way

[Verse 1]
I'm swervin' in that road rage
Drivin' fast cars causing road rage
All leather's in my car
I'm smokin' with the stars
I'm rollin' in that dumb thang
Then I took yo dumb thang
I let this bitch bark
Try to run
You won't make it that far
Rollin' with my homies
My homies from a young age
I did this at a young age
I be spendin' Benji's all day

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Want war but you call the cops
I'm ridin' down ya block
Finna cause a wreckin'
Homies with me and they reckless
My jewelry cost a lot
Check out my chain and my watch
I did this at a young age
You can too, don't be dumb babe
I do this shit a lot
What I'm talkin' bout gettin' guap
I'm ridin' with ya thot
She finna give me top

[Hook]
