[Hook: Trouble]
I got it straight out the street
Whatever you find you keep
Hundreds of pounds a week
How could you down a G?
How could you foul on me?
How could you hound a freak?
How could your rounds be weak?
How is you down my G?
How is you down my G?
You ain’t got a pound at least?
You must ain't did right by your folks
You must ain’t real as you believe
I turn this shit up for the streets
I keep shit a buck when I speak
I ain’t tryna find me no good girl
I’d rather bust down with a freak

[Verse 1: Veli Sosa]
Hundred grand in one week
Switch it up, we got freaks
Hit Sosa, you want to eat
Hit Sosa, you want to eat
I’ma tell you where we gon’ meet
Hope you ain’t the police
Keep a bad bitch, all times nigga
All my hoes on fleek

[Hook: Trouble]
I got it straight out the street
Whatever you find you keep
Hundreds of pounds a week
How could you down a G?
How could you foul on me?
How could you hound a freak?
How could your rounds be weak?
How is you down my G?
How is you down my G?
You ain’t got a pound at least?
You must ain't did right by your folks
You must ain’t real as you believe
I turn this shit up for the streets
I keep shit a buck when I speak
I ain’t tryna find me no good girl
I’d rather bust down with a freak

[Verse 2: Trouble]
How could your rounds be weak?
You raised them boys to be some hoes
You raised them boys to be some pussys
Bet you look surprised when niggas fold
I can’t even be there for an hour
I swear to you I hate to lose shit
I don’t give a fuck who came before me
To me, my nigga, that’s a new bitch
I came through the bricks, that’s on my new shit
Niggas hate but don’t know what to do with me
Niggas tried, they all get to shooting with me
I say women ‘cause I get to shooting first
[?] nigga come out of that red dirt
Ain’t a baller street, young nigga go headfirst
I was sipping in the trap spot
Now I’m in the sky with dumb knots, nigga

[Hook: Trouble]
I got it straight out the street
Whatever you find you keep
Hundreds of pounds a week
How could you down a G?
How could you foul on me?
How could you hound a freak?
How could your rounds be weak?
How is you down my G?
How is you down my G?
You ain’t got a pound at least?
You must ain't did right by your folks
You must ain’t real as you believe
I turn this shit up for the streets
I keep shit a buck when I speak
I ain’t tryna find me no good girl
I’d rather bust down with a freak
