[Hook]

If We Was Fresh To The Death
Then Im The Walking Dead
I Dont Rest Inna Coffin
I Rest In My Bed
My Last Wish Is That My Lyrics Are Read
I Would Rather Die Than Running From The Feds
And Yessir This Is Personnal
My Gennys Steady Stackin But They Dont Work For You
I Break Rules Man
Color Outside The Lines
My Death Has Already Happened
Ita Feathery Suicide

Verse 1 [Clutchbaby]
I Died 13 Years Ago
Hold Up
I Was Born
I Prolly Died Cuz I Got Everythin Forn
My Kickgame Is Sweeter Than Sweet Baby Corn
And For My Death Can Yall Please Feel Mourn
Its Easy For Me To Synthesize That Girl
To Pull Her You Need To Hypnotize That Girl
Yeah I Really Need To Try To Change The World
On My Body I Got Diamonds And Pearls
My Swagger Is Fresh
Your Is Starting To Rot
And You See Them Maybachs, In The Parking Lot
I Dont Write Lyrics
I Prefer To Jot
My music Make Your Day
Yeah It Hit The Spot
Yea I Spend Money
Yea I Over Shop
Started From The Bottom Now Im Heading To The Top
Im About To Kill This Beat Produced By Young Chop

[Hook]

Verse 2 [Clutchbaby]

My Featheriness Is Killer , I Won't Even Save Ya
Im Talkin Bout Suicide , Not Euthanasia
Im In Studio
Ball Like Ricky Rubio
Burberry And Gucci Clothes
What You Pack The Semi For?
Yeah
Im A Feathery Homie
You Look Kinda Lonely
But You Better Know Me
OGs And Rare Air
Restin On Feet
Yall Thought They Was Fake
Hater Rest In Peace

Verse 2 [Savage Dammo]

Woah
I Suicide, I Suicide On This Beat Yo
Ain't Got Time For You lames Moe
I'm Steady Flexing Never Stressing
Flow On A Beat Like It's A Blessing
I'm Fresh Like The Mentos
MGE My Gang And What I'm Reppin Till The End Yo
Im In Here With My Mans Clutch
We Tell Yall Goons To Catch Up
We Some Young Goons Straight Finessing
I Ain't Playing Just Saying
Everything I Rap Is Real Moe
RIP To My Dad Yo
He died when I was 2 years old
Can't Fade You Haters
Don't Say Bye Just See You Later
