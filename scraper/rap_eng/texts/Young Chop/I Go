[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Summertime pop out them killas
Hop out if we see them niggas
Tryna tell em I got my city
Wherever I go they go
Wherever I point they blow
That bitch wanna play that role
See the gang on the camera roll
She going
Free bro, free bands we got it
They took J-Money, he was savage
You could fuck a opp, hoes be wildin'
Nighttime by the lake with them cannons
I told them when I got on
They'll go every step I make
I swear every breathe I take
We going, we going
Remember I ain't have no gucci
Remember I ain't have no Louis
Remember I ain't have no groupies
All my niggas shooters
All my niggas ruthless
All my niggas wilding
All my niggas violent
And they kill for me
Lets get it

[Pre-Chorus: Johnny Maycash]
Riding around with that tool
So I'm cool
And I keep them Normal killers
They come and kill you
Yeah them My niggas
Get poked for your figures
And then forget you
Yeah them My niggas

[Chorus: Johnny Maycash]
Wherever I go they go (they go)
Wherever I go they go (they go)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
We smoking, we rolling
We on it, we toting

No money, whatever I'm on they on
They ride through right and wrong
For a price they get 'em gone
Never fall out for these bitches

Still got niggas cuz I ain't get a sentence
They industry, I'm in the streets
Niggas acting street be killin me
And a lot of my niggas is killas
Fuck yo niggas, I love my niggas
And they ride through whatever
Fuck yo niggas, I love my niggas
