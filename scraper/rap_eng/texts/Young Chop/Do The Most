[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Shit, took a mic and told 'em I'm a rapper (let's get it)
Shit, I took my re-up and I bought designer (dope)
Shit, off a perky, I done went to NASA (yer)
Told her wanna suck me through my boxers, I ain't got no manners (blat)
Shit, I took my Ruger, traded it for a coat (let's get it)
Shit, two of my plugs for a brick of dope (gimme that)
Shit, I'm hearin' voices so I grab the Ghost (skrt)
Aye, my name Durk so I'ma do the most (grah)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Hundred thou' I spent it on the [?] (skrt, yeah)
I copped the Rollie and put down the Mueller
Your bitch like me, she say you a goof (goofy)
I finessed the city playin' that old school (skrt)
Why they playin' with Durk and he a whole shooter? (Rah)
I just fucked your mama, she a whole cougar (get it)
Hot boy, I be turned up off that old Juvie
Trap house, remember days eatin' cold noodles
Calvin Klein, I hold that forty up (let's get it, bah)
To his stomach, give him a tummy tuck (let's get it, aye)
I'll rob his ass and don't get nothin' up (gimme that)
If you don't, he gon' fuck 'round, be in a truck or somethin' (skrt)
Bitches want the fashion, she lookin' 'round like where it's at? (Dope)
Don't touch me at the door, security know I got the strap (let's get it)
Three hundred killers with me, tell 'em open up the back (gang)
Got a room in the telly but I'd rather be in the trap (dope)

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Shit, took a mic and told 'em I'm a rapper (let's get it)
Shit, I took my re-up and I bought designer (dope)
Shit, off a perky, I done went to NASA (yer)
Told her wanna suck me through my boxers, I ain't got no manners (blat)
Shit, I took my Ruger, traded it for a coat (let's get it)
Shit, two of my plugs for a brick of dope (gimme that)
Shit, I'm hearin' voices so I grab the Ghost (skrt)
Aye, my name Durk so I'ma do the most (gang)

[Verse 2: Valee]
I damn near need a cough drop when I'm off the OG
Twenty-six inch Forgiatos, I done caught it slowly (slowly)
Only made eight thousand, I guess it's a slow week (I guess it's a slow week)
I just popped two xans, they call that a slow geek (they call that a slow geek)
Upgraded my motor 'case I see the police (I see the police)
I been up two days, I'm off lean and coffee (I been up two days)
I spent fourteen hundred dollars on a Yorkie doggy (on a Yorkie doggy)
I had Gigi in that coupe without a car seat (damn)
Two racks on Balmain, they came with rips on 'em (they came with rips on 'em)
Me and my bitch feet both got Gucci flips on 'em (Gucci flips)
I got that small nine, it's one more clip on 'em (I got that small nine)
He got clean codeine, he got that sip on 'em (he got clean codeine)

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Shit, took a mic and told 'em I'm a rapper (let's get it)
Shit, I took my re-up and I bought designer (dope)
Shit, off a perky, I done went to NASA (yer)
Told her wanna suck me through my boxers, I ain't got no manners (blat)
Shit, I took my Ruger, traded it for a coat (let's get it)
Shit, two of my plugs for a brick of dope (gimme that)
Shit, I'm hearin' voices so I grab the Ghost (skrt)
Aye, my name Durk so I'ma do the most (grah)
