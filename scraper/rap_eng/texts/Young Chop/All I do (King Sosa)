[Verse 1]
All a young nigga know is finesse
Before you come to me, you better get a check
Ride down low, roll down windows, flex
Hop out on em looking like a check
Six thousand dollar backpack and some Louis boots
All you do is talk all we do is shoot
All I do is pull out racks all I do is fucking ball

[Chorus]
All I do is pop tags
All I do is fuck em all
All I do is hit, niggas
All I do is hit bongs
All I do is hit Gucci
All I do is get money
All I do is hit, niggas
All I do is hit bongs
All I do is hit Gucci
All I do is get money
All I do is hit, niggas
All I do is hit bongs
All I do is hit Gucci
All I do is get money

[Verse 2]
All a young nigga know is finesse
Before you come to me, you better get a check
Ride down low, roll down windows, flex
Hop out on em looking like a check
Six thousand dollar backpack and some Louis boots
All you do is talk all we do is shoot
All I do is pull out racks all I do is fucking ball

[Chorus]
All I do is pop tags
All I do is fuck em all
All I do is hit, niggas
All I do is hit bongs
All I do is hit Gucci
All I do is get money
All I do is hit, niggas
All I do is hit bongs
All I do is hit Gucci
All I do is get money

[Verse 3]
All a young nigga know is finesse
Before you come to me, you better get a check
Ride down low, roll down windows, flex
Hop out on em looking like a check
Six thousand dollar backpack and some Louis boots
All you do is talk all we do is shoot
All I do is pull out racks all I do is fucking ball
All I do is pop tags
All I do is fuck em all
