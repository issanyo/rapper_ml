[Chorus]
Just because I'm famous don't mean I ain't with that street shit
Keep that forty on me nigga I will end your life bitch
[?] keep them thirties tucked, nigga run it up
You gon get fucked up

Bitch I run around my city with my tool on my lap
If you think about snatching my chain, one move you'll get whacked
You get whacked
[?] keep them thirties tucked,nigga run it up, you gon get fucked up

[Verse 1]
If we see you we gon shoot you on site boy
That internet hype will get you killed overnight bruh
Niggas steady tweaking like I won't sign
Pull up on a nigga do a homicide
All my niggas yeah they down to ride
Then we [?] hop up in a foreign car
Then I take the roof off
Do the dash in that bitch, so fast almost crashed in this bitch
If my money blue it's probably coz my diamonds [?]
[?] coz [?] it's probably [?]
[?] it's probably coz this bag yeah
[?] money I spent, it's probably coz my [?]

That's that money machine
[?] yeah it's right infront of me
[?] the we seal it, then we ship it out
Fedex, UPS what we talking bout

[Chorus]
Just because I'm famous don't mean I ain't with that street shit
Keep that forty on me nigga I will end your life bitch
[?] keep them thirties tucked, nigga run it up
You gon get fucked up

Bitch I run around my city with my tool on my lap
If you think about snatching my chain, one move you'll get whacked
You get whacked
[?] keep them thirties tucked,nigga run it up, you gon get fucked up
