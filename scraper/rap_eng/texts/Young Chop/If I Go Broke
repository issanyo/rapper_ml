[Hook: Fredo Santana]
All these niggas bitches, just take a look and see it
Take a look at my wrist, that bitch is on freeze
It's money over bitches, a bitch I don't need
Cause I be trapping hard, hitting licks, smoking weed
Don't get my nigga started, they say we so retarded
See these bricks I be coping, hit the block then I chop it
Can't leave my niggas starving, stuff the pounds in the garbage
They throw it in my closet, I go broke then I'm robbin'

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
If I go broke, just know a nigga robbin'
50k up in my robin's bent I don't need no wallet
Robbin' me stop it, I pull out and pop it
Ben leave a nigga slum and walk off like it's nothing
Bitch I'm a fucking monster, bitch I move like a monster
Just call me Fredo got it, got a chopper and a party
Better leave a nigga sloppy so act tough if you want it
Just to put you in the coma, it's all my next persona
I been going hard all god damn week
I be rollin' off of molly I ain't had no sleep
And my money where my mouth isn't what you talk you see
Put this 30 where your mouth is, my pistol touch your teeth

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
All these niggas bitches, just take a look and see it

See these bricks I be coping, hit the block then I chop it
Can't leave my niggas starving, stuff the pounds in the garbage
They throw it in my closet, I go broke then I'm robbin'

[Verse 2: Trouble]
Trouble going broke, a rich pussy's nightmare
Trill nigga shit, I'm checking on no night air
Words to school none of the rounds I'ma violate
And motherfuck one time I'm a cope hate it
UBN, we hussle all over the globe
The drop season, my reason US smoke pole
They say DTE beat 'em up for a reason
Need no shit, send hits but you know shit
Trouble, trouble they know how I get down
From these pussy ass rappers to these street clowns
Oh you got fitapese in that bag right there
It is red dough

[Hook: Fredo Santana]

[Verse 3: Alley Boy]
They trust me in blood money, fuck bitches we ball out
Pop pills with Tadoe, my young niggas gon' clear that
Don't take out we be shy, 50 hundred your life
These niggas jacking for phone, pausing they murking for ice
Man all these industry niggas, they for the inner street niggas
Just GBE, DTE shout outs to them being niggas
And my vice lords niggas, and my GD niggas
And my moles and fouls, shouts out to dimtoe nigga
Always to my zone to the stone chy rack like my second home
All them young niggas strapped with them 30's popper
Quick shot to your dome
And I'm bout the don of 100, and with Trouble 200
My nigga Fredo Santana when you mix all that it's 300
