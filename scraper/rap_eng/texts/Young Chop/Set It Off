[Chorus]
I'm off the perc and adderall
I'ma have to walk it and drink it off
Sold him some cut then I played it off
Keep the [?] I don't play at all
I'll play some killer vibe, get you off
Nut in her face and I sent her off
Givenchy shoes with a Gucci scarf, Gucci bag just to set it off
I'm off the perc and adderall
I'ma have to walk it and drink it off
Sniffin' some coke then I played it off
Keep the [?] I don't play at all
I'll play some killer vibe, get you off
Nut in her face and I sent her off
Givenchy shoes with a Gucci scarf, Gucci bag just to set it off

I do not front for no bitches, million cash made in them trenches
Niggas be acting like bitches, niggas be telling they business
Fly overseas for some business, mind made up, I want the millions
Nigga's be stealing my swag call that copyright infringement
Diamonds they Fiji they water, diamonds they Fiji they water
Niggas be talking like they reporters, talking like they some reporters
Real niggas fuck with me, all yall niggas be foofie
Talking bout what you gon do to me, when you fucking see me

[Bridge]
We don't play like that, give to that bitch go click click clack
One shot to your head, we will push shit back
Chop Squad reppin' here yeah we been on the map

[Chorus]
I'm off the perc and adderall
I'ma have to walk it and drink it off
Sold him some cut then I played it off
Keep the [?] I don't play at all
I'll play some killer vibe, get you off
Nut in her face and I sent her off
Givenchy shoes with a Gucci scarf, Gucci bag just to set it off
I'm off the perc and adderall
I'ma have to walk it and drink it off
Sniffin' some coke then I played it off
Keep the [?] I don't play at all
I'll play some killer vibe, get you off
Nut in her face and I sent her off
Givenchy shoes with a Gucci scarf, Gucci bag just to set it off

[Verse 2]
Talking bout money, I got it, hundred K for that Patek
Nigga [?] static, aunty let you have it
Disappear just like magic, you niggas it
Clown ass niggas get off my dick
I'm worth about Five millie, I'm bout to go cop the dealy
Who go the drink, pour it up, who got the smoke, roll it up
Can't see shit behind these Gucci shades
Got two cups, instant lemonade

[Bridge]
We don't play like that, give to that bitch go click click clack
One shot to your head, we will push shit back
Chop Squad reppin' here yeah we been on the map

[Chorus]
I'm off the perc and adderall
I'ma have to walk it and drink it off
Sold him some cut then I played it off
Keep the [?] I don't play at all
I'll play some killer vibe, get you off
Nut in her face and I sent her off
Givenchy shoes with a Gucci scarf, Gucci bag just to set it off
I'm off the perc and adderall
I'ma have to walk it and drink it off
Sniffin' some coke then I played it off
Keep the [?] I don't play at all
I'll play some killer vibe, get you off
Nut in her face and I sent her off
Givenchy shoes with a Gucci scarf, Gucci bag just to set it off
