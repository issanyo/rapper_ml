[Chorus: Young Chop]
(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap
(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap

[Verse 1: Young Chop]
My pockets too small for all this cash on me
Had to walk into Gucci store and get a bag for it
I live a rockstar life on got some Xanax on me
Your bitch let me fuck 'cause I got a bag on me
I'm seeing all these comments on my Instagram
These pussy niggas hate 'cause they ain't got no swag
The bank teller got all that fuckin ass on her
She staring at my bag I got this cash on me (bep)

[Chorus: Young Chop]
(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap
(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Gucci shade, Gucci tiger on my handbag
Everything in my bag, I got Xanax
I got a booster so the price you pay, ain't payin' that
Chanel, Chanel, Chanel swag
Where your friends at? Gucci handbag
Why you playin' bitch, that's yo' friend bag
Got my rings in my handbag, second zipper
5 thousand worth in 1s, case I fuck a stripper
In my hand bag

[Chorus: Young Chop]
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap
(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap

[Verse 3: Young Chop]
Catch me in the airport with my bag on me
TSA ask me why I got that cash on me
Paid 25 for my fuckin necklace
Paid another 25 for my Timepiece
Bitch I don't drink Dasani, I drink Fiji
Tell your bitch to wipe me down like I'm Boosie
She looking at my chain 'cause it's 3D
She looking at my bag, she wanna fuck me

[Chorus: Young Chop]
(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap
(What you got) In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Got a bag for my bag, got a whole lotta cash
In my Messenger bag (Gucci)
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap
What you got
What you got
In my Messenger bag
In my Messenger bag
Don't think a nigga lackin', keep that muthafuckin' strap
