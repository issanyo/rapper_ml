[Verse 1: Johnny May Cash]
Ever since I checked a bag, niggas mad, go get some cash
You looking sad, go find you swag, can't have my swag
They piss and make you swag
Can't ball like me, can't ball like me, I’m a young OG
Bitch im your poppa, boy I’m your father
They need a doctor, these niggas sick
Fuck niggas get me pissed, bitch niggas ain’t shit
Now tell me something, how you getting money
These fuck niggas frontin, they getting nothing
And they wonder why‘cause he try so hard
Fuck niggas start to starve, nigga fuck these broads
Never had no job, always had to grind hard
Nigga pay your part, yeah you boys got scarred
You dont want that ride, couple thous dont cost
Cause ever since that a nigga got rich, fuck niggas been pissed

[Hook: Johnny May Cash]
You shouldn't let a young nigga touch a couple bands
Just saying, Just saying, Just saying
Fuck niggas talkin they just playin
We get to spraying, we get to spraying
Cause ever since, i been getting mula
Ever since, 30 clips just like a ruler
Ever since, all these bitches wanna do us
Ever since, these fuck niggas wanna hate us

[Verse 2: Rampage]
Oh thats your bitch, she with me now
Pipe her down i made a mess
Go wipe her down you fucking clown
I’m getting bands, I spend a bag
Niggas hate us ever since, ever since I checked the bank
Ever since I made a mil’, pull off in that foreign fast
Designer shit from head to toe
I’m getting paid, you niggas broke
Shout out to the squad, real niggas all I ever know
Lotta choppers in the crib shooting all my niggas do
Hustle from the night till the morning, all we ever know
All I know is mula
I could turn a half to a whole like voila
Whip a whole pack, get it done like ta-da
All my niggas on point, shooting like da-da

[Hook: Johnny May Cash]
