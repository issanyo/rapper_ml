[Intro]
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I

[Chorus]
I done did so much wrong so I gotta lay low
Drugs gettin' to my body, now I'm movin' slow-mo
Outside day and night when it's war time
These niggas ain't outside when it's war time
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I

[Verse 1]
Pop a perky up, just to ease my mind yeah
Niggas be talkin' down on me but they ain't on nothin'
Niggas be ridin' around the city like they own somethin'
Pop a perk, damn that bitch got me booted up
I need my money right now, nothin' more or less
We come out the trap smilin', made an M, nigga we wildin'
Niggas be merchin' on they life but know they ain't get no cash
We ain't givin' no niggas no pass, up a chopper on his ass
Heh, she takin' pictures on my phone
Perkies got me movin' slow-mo
And this Rollie do not tick homie
Big baguettes in my watch got 'em sick homie

[Chorus]
I done did so much wrong so I gotta lay low
Drugs gettin' to my body, now I'm movin' slow-mo
Outside day and night when it's war time
These niggas ain't outside when it's war time
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I

[Verse 2]
Let's take a moment of silence for all my people that's dead and gone (RIP Ma)
They will live through me through this fuckin' song
Gotta admit my rights and wrongs, I remember nights alone
Ridin' with them sticks out, make a nigga get down
I'ma let my soul out
Dreams of bein' a millionaire, now I'm rich now
Niggas ain't on shit, up that forty in his face
I remember
I remember, I remember, I remember
Late nights in them traps, yeah I remember
I remember, I remember, I remember
Late nights in them traps, I remember

[Chorus]
I done did so much wrong so I gotta lay low
Drugs gettin' to my body, now I'm movin' slow-mo
Outside day and night when it's war time
These niggas ain't outside when it's war time
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I

[Outro]
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
I gotta lay low, I
