[Intro]
This is an emergency, this is an emergency

[Verse 1]
Police sirens, everyday
People dyin', everyday
Mamas cryin', everyday
Fathers tryin', everyday
Tryin' to get my head straight
This the city of Chi-Raq, get your bed made
See death around the corner, boy I dodge him like I owe 'em
I don't talk if I don't know 'em
Niggas plottin' niggas on me
Boy, I lost homies
Some died, some crossed on me
I love the niggas that's down for me
Fuck the ones that sent shots on me, yeah
If the bill's late, they rob you just to get the bills paid
Niggas workin' for a payout
Everyday lookin' for a way out
Get released from jail and try to stay out
Pray to God, see how it play out
But maybe God tryin' to test me
This life that I'm livin' so stressful
In one second I'mma let loose
And everybody in here gonna catch it
Cause right now I can't take it
Lord, when I'm gonna make it?
Cause this Chi-Raq and my city lost
I can't fall victim to Satan
Please pray for my city, hurry up

[Hook]
Please pray for my city
Too much hate in my city
Too many heartaches in my city
But I got faith in my city
This Chi-Raq and I love that
You can't take it away from my city
Some can't relate to my city
They die everyday in my city

[Verse 2]
Real talk, I lost plenty
But I'm still out here gettin' it
On the block with my brothers
Tryin' to eat cause we all hungry
Walkin' up the wrong block and get ya hit up
That's why I gotta keep somethin' on me
Can't trust none, can't feed him, he ain't done nothin'
I hustle hard for my loved ones
Some wasn't and some was, but I don't judge
Go hard for my city, cause my city got it
They ain't wanna see my city have it
I ain't have it so I went and got it
They talk down on my city but my city matter

[Hook] (x2)
Please pray for my city
Too much hate in my city
Too many heartaches in my city
But I got faith in my city
This Chi-Raq and I love that
You can't take it away from my city
Some can't relate to my city
They die everyday in my city, yeah

[Outro]
I'm from that city where forties get clapped
This story of fact
Niggas can't shoot so babies get whacked
That's how it is in Chi-Raq
And y'all mad cause I don't call it Chicago
But I don't live in no fuckin' Chicago, boy I live in Chi-Raq
Chi-Raq, Chi-Raq, Chi-Raq
Boy I live in Chi-Raq
