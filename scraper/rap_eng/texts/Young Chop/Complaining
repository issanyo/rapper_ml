[Intro: SD]
I know you tired

Nah that ain't my avenue
Complaining complaining
Girl I might get tired of you
Complaining complaining
Relax and take your mind away
Girl I'm here to take time away

[Verse 1: SD]
See girl

Forever I might cherish you
Somethings may not change
Just patience, we gon wait with chu
Sometimes people change, and me girl I admit
That you no one to stay the same
Don't think girl, it ain't news to you

That'll show you that I'm here wit you
These games you be playin'
But I can't stay upset wit you

You focused, try to aim
You worried bout what imma do
