[Verse 1]
Bitch I kick in the door waiving the 44
"I love her rich Chop, don't shoot me no more!"
Where the cash at, we need that, lead me to the safe
Stop that motherfucking crying bitch, open up that safe
Or this 44. bullet nigga gon' rearrange your face
We don't give a fuck nigga, we gon' shoot you anyway
Broad day, hold that pistol (hold that pistol) sideways
Heard you want that beef then bring it my way

[Bridge]
Yeah it's all about the Benjamins baby, yeah it's all about the Benjamins baby
Yeah it's all about the Benjamins baby, yeah it's all about the Benjamins baby

[Verse 2]
Running up a check, thumbing through that check
Fucking on your bitch, where the fucking snakes at?
Pulled up in that Porsche, pulled off in that Wraith
Look at their faces, look at my hater's faces
[?]
Niggas running up I put that forty in their faces (Boom boom boom!)
Hustle so goddamn big I got a fucking bank in it
In the [?]
Strippers dancing but naked shit, I let em' taste the dick

[Bridge]
Yeah it's all about the Benjamins baby, yeah it's all about the Benjamins baby
Yeah it's all about the Benjamins baby, yeah it's all about the Benjamins baby
