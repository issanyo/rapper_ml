[Intro]
Young Chop on the beat

[Hook: A Boogie]
Run it up
Niggas be swearin' they one of us
I got the gang in the cut
I don't see no one in front of us
Nigga if you mad or somethin'
Get in your bag or somethin'
Pull out them racks or somethin'
Get you a bag or somethin'
Look at my shoes, beastie
Look at my jewels, beastie
Look at my groove, beastie
Niggas like ooh, beastie
Yeah
Run it up
I don't see no one in front of us
Yeah
Run it up
Look at my gang, I fuck it up

[Verse: Lil Bibby]
You could check my bag I'm decent
Smellin' like stank, I'm reekin'
Way I'm winnin' you would think I'm cheatin'
Rockin' Y3 this ain't regular Adidas
And I'm still in the streets if a nigga want beef tell a nigga I'll eat it
I wake up in the morning I run up a check
Go to sleep and repeat it
I stay with the torch, stayed on the porch
Just a lil youngin' I stayed in the courts
I had to lie just to play in the [?]
