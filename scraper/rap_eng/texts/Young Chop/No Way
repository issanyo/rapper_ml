Oh my, I've been waitin' for this for all my life
All night, I've been dreamin' about you on my side
All right, never thought about gettin' all that back
No way, no way you'll get me back

I've been grindin' and trippin' all my life
She's been cryin' and flippin' all the time
Think about all the screams in the car and I'm tryin' to forget, but there seem to be scars from the love, that I gave. Now it's only me in the cave.. hey

I've been really walkin' through the locked up doors
Overseen them junkies in the clubs..
Walkin' by the lake and lookin' at the stars, think about the space with the Moon and the Mars, and we're holdin' hands, then we gonna fly away... hey

Oh my, I've been waitin' for this for all my life
All night, I've been dreamin' about you on my side
All right, never thought about gettin' all that back
No way, no way you'll get me back
