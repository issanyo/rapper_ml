[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I be ridin' through the park like I'm A-Rod
Walkin' through the park like I'm A-Rod
Smokin' on that strong, that's that steroid
They tryna kick me out like A-Rod
I used to run the base like A-Rod
When I get me a check, I'mma buy me some extra
When I get me a check, I'mma buy me a necklace
When I get me a check, I'mma eat her for breakfast
When I get me a check, niggas gotta respect it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I earned all my stripes like A-Rod, worth 25 mill
That's a whole lot of money, man somebody get killed
Que pasa, que pasa, you know that I'm proper, I run with my partners
We need us a doctor, for drinkin' the vodka
That pi√±a colada, I might shit a lobster
I just said that shit with my eyes closed
I can count a hundred thousand while I'm blindfolded
See you out, nigga, watch I get to it
CUI, nigga, mean the chopper under influence
Now watch how I limp to the bank, dreads hangin' under my A hat
If I got sucked by a teller, I would never tell you but that would be Bankhead
A1 nigga from the south side, I need a spot light
I need a chinchilla, before I get frostbite
Put the white girl in the middle, call it Klondike
Take her the to the room after dinner, and fuck her like it's prom night

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Move around my town like A-Rod
Playin' with that girl like Baywatch, Tony Hawk skate off
Steroid, on your ass like Hemorrhoids
Cash out with that pen boy, your pass out see the invoice
When I get that check, I'mma call Madonna
Call up Cameron Diaz, call up Daisy Fuentes
Dikembe on them hoes like no-no, not in my house, you can't stay
You can smoke and you can drink and bend it over, let me play
God dammit, I done came up, nigga
35K take the plane up, nigga - 35 cars, 35 chains, nigga
Gettin' this change, never changed up, nigga
When I get that check, I'ma buy you a fake ass
With your fake ass, we don't count money, weigh cash
Breakin' up the rock, Dame Dash
When you're talkin' 'bout work, was my day job
Playin' with the base like A-Rod
Playin' with them M's since yay high
Mix it up, drink it, stay high
