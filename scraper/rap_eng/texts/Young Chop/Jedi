[Verse 1]
Heard a fuck boy in the road
Run him over
Heard that it's some snakes up in the grass
I'm mowing
Heard they put a plot on my mans
We ain't going
Heard you ridin' foreigns, Audis, Maseratis, no Range Rovers
Heard you wanna talk shit, wanna pop out with them vultures
Heard that when it get dark they'll flex on ya, Hulk Hogan
I Heard that they just want ya for yo money
And they want ya for them stacks, yeah them racks
Them 50s and them Tecs and them Macs, cannot lack

[Pre Hook]
This Chop' on my hip look like a guitar
I'm passing blunts like Brett Favre, I'm getting it at large
Wanna get a feat from me 20 bands what I charge
Gotta spend like a whole car
I'm flexing like I got arms

[Hook]
I'm smoking on them moonrocks
Feeling like I'm a Jedi
Feeling like Han Solo
But I'm not gonna die
And now I'm riding round Chiraq
That sound like Jakku
And you just tranna get yo stacks so I ain't even gone knock you
What you look like, you ain't even know what you heard
Been getting that Suge Knight run 'em right into the dirt
Gang getting that cook right, in the kitchen always first
If you don't look right then everyone upping them 30s, 30s, 30s

[Verse 2]
What I look like fool, I'll pull up with the shooter, I'll pull up with my bro and we all just cooling
Big Bs in this bitch yeah I'm always booling
Get ya team wet just like y'all was too
Spray yo bitch just like my Uzi
Free Wop, bitch I'm Gucci
Try to take my gwap, then bro will loose it
That Glock right there Imma pick it up, shoot it
Bro on the stove he whipping somethin up, yeah that shit ready to go
This rap shit brought me to Cali I found me a plug send him coast-to-coast
I'm Cappin right now I'm Cappin everywhere cause they just took my bro
They could lock me up for life for this shit when I see the fuck boy he get smoked

[Pre Hook]
This Chop' on my hip look like a guitar
I'm passing blunts like Bret Favre, I'm getting it at large
Wanna get a feat from me 20 bands what I charge
Gotta spend like a whole car
I'm flexing like I got arms

[Hook]
I'm smoking on them moonrocks
Feeling like I'm a Jedi
Feeling like Han Solo
But I'm not gonna die
And now I'm riding round Chiraq
That sound like Jakku
And you just tranna get yo stacks so I ain't even gone knock you
What you look like, you ain't even know what you heard
Been getting that Suge Knight run 'em right into the dirt
Gang getting that cook right, in the kitchen always first
If you don't look right then everyone upping them 30s, 30s, 30s
