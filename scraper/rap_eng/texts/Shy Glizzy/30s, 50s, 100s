[Intro]
(I get my work from The Narco)
(Yah)

[Chorus]
Oh you heard I'm gettin’ rich? (Yah)
Well that's a fact, remember I ain't had shit
And a nigga had to jack
Use to run up with the MAC
Like “What you got?” (What you got?)
Take ’em way, way back when we was beatin' on the pots (Way back)
Little mama is a roller (Yah)
Yeah, she a thot
You musta been the one that told her, that she a snack
Yeah, they call me young Jefe from the bottom of the map (Young Jefe)
We got 30s, 50s, 100s, on the bottom of these straps

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I stepped up in that bitch, almost got attacked
That .45, I tuck it when I'm sneakin' in the back (Gat)
Soon as I throw them bands, them bitches bust it on my lap (Bang)
Somebody gotta flash it when they bustin' in the trap
She ask me what's my name (Yah)
I said 'Racks!" (Racks)
That bitch ain't playin’ no games, when she hopped in this Maybach
And she let me film it, I can hit the playback (Yah)
Bitch I carry three guns, I shoot just like A.I. (Swish)
Yeah I stay fly, that shit will hurt a hater ass
A nigga play with Jefe, then a nigga gon’ die (A nigga gon')
Yeah, I know these rappers like to lie
But I’m a real fuckin' trapper and I carry that shit with pride

[Chorus]
Oh you heard I'm gettin' rich? (Yah)
Well that’s a fact, remember I ain't had shit
And a nigga had to jack
Use to run up with the MAC
Like “What you got?” (What you got?)
Take 'em way, way back when we was beatin' on the pots (Way back)
Little mama is a roller (Yah)
Yeah, she a thot
You musta been the one that told her, that she a snack
Yeah, they call me young Jefe from the bottom of the map (Young Jefe)
We got 30s, 50s, 100s, on the bottom of these straps

[Verse 2]
Boy, you playin' around with pennies
I got them Benjis
She don't know shit ‘bout no hemmies (No)
She like them Bentleys
Ask about a real nigga, she ain't had any
Then she asked about these fuck niggas
She done has plenty (Goddamn, goddamn)
Homie, he can keep her
She did what I need
I got her on that St. Regis
Yah, that's where we meet
Hey señorita, she gon' let me beat it (Hey, hey)
Yeah, you know I keep that heater
Got played and you leave her
Bitch you blowin' up (Yah) you the damn broad
Go 30 floors, top, then take your pants off (Yah)
Never too much (Never too much), quick to fire and draw
Niggas play with us (Play with us), then we gon' blast off

[Chorus]
Oh you heard I'm gettin' rich? (Yah)
Well that's a fact, remember I ain't had shit
And a nigga had to jack
Use to run up with the MAC
Like “What you got?” (What you got?)
Take 'em way, way back when we was beatin' on the pots (Way back)
Little mama is a roller (Yah)
Yeah, she a thot
You musta been the one that told her, that she a snack
Yeah, they call me young Jefe from the bottom of the map (Young Jefe)
We got 30s, 50s, 100s, on the bottom of these straps
