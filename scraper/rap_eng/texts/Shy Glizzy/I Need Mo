[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
The plug, he be droppin' off the load (Oh)
Informant in your clique, he gotta go (Go, rat)
My hitters, they’ll come and snatch your soul (Woah)
All I wanted was some dough, now, and I need more (Oh, I need more)
I got me some paper, I need more (Oh, I need more)
Now and I got me some haters, I need more (Oh, I need more)
I got all these bad bitches, I need more (Oh, I need more)
And my son, he is a rich kid, he need more, oh (He need more)

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Throwin' up them sevens, nigga, you know what I'm reppin' (Tre-7)
And we keep them weapons, every nigga want me steppin' (Oh)
Country bitch so sexy, uh, she come down from Texas (Oh)
Bitch cappin’' estrogen, they kicked her out of the Lexus (Skrrt)
It get cold, I put on minks to cover up my gun (Brr)
And my son had Cuban links ever since that he was one (On God)
Earned my stripes, I asked the streets, they said you ain't got none (Hahaha)
Bitch, it's GG for life, you finish off where you begun (GG, for life)
Lil' bitch, you know we 'bout that shit, don't act like you retarded
And if I had a problem with you, nigga I would solve it (Uh huh)
My brother, that's my partner, I ain't have no fuckin' father (He murdered)
No, I'm not from Harlem, but I'm a fuckin' Globetrotter (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
The plug, he be droppin' off the load (Oh)
Informant in your clique, he gotta go (Go, rat)
My hitters, they’ll come and snatch your soul (Woah)

I got me some paper, I need more (Oh, I need more)
Now and I got me some haters, I need more (Oh, I need more)
I got all these bad bitches, I need more (Oh, I need more)

[Verse 2: 3 Glizzy]
I used to trap right in front of the store
I ran that up and I need me some more
Come to my trap, you get searched at the door
Your bitch a freak, I fucked her on the floor
I fucked that bitch 'til her pussy got sore
We movin' militant on one accord
My young niggas solid, make sure that they straight
I got the ARP, I got a Drac'
I got them hundreds balled up in the safe
I'm from the projects, now I'm by the lake
I beat the case, and they got it on tape
She let me fuck, we ain’t go on no date
Feds on my ass, I can't make no mistakes
My cousin got life, now they tryna escape
Been savin' up because I want a Wraith
Look back in my past, I done came a long way
I gotta go hard, I ain't takin no breaks
My nephew is four, he eat lobster and steak
They act like they love me, I know it's fake
Don’t talk on the phone, meet the plug face to face
I send them shooters right there where you stay
They said you ain't home so I told 'em to wait
They campin' all night if that’s what it take
You don't make your funeral, shoot up the wake (Murder, murder)

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
The plug, he be droppin' off the load (Oh)
Informant in your clique, he gotta go (Go, rat)
My hitters, they’ll come and snatch your soul (Woah)
All I wanted was some dough, now, and I need more (Oh, I need more)
I got me some paper, I need more (Oh, I need more)
Now and I got me some haters, I need more (Oh, I need more)
I got all these bad bitches, I need more (Oh, I need more)
And my son, he is a rich kid, he need more, oh (He need more)

[Outro: Shy Glizzy]
I need more
I need more
I need more
I need more
