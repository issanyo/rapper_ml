[Hook]
We like foreign bitches , we like foreign Coupes
These niggas boring, they need to move
Man go head and let them bitches choose
You know they heard that we them fuckin' dudes
We them dudes, we them dudes
You know they heard that we them fuckin' dudes
We them dudes, we them dudes
Man go head and let them bitches choose

[Verse 1:Shy Glizzy]
Bitch It's Big Glizzy, I came wit the troops
You can't be round me if you ain't goin shoot
Anywhere you go, you know they goin choose
Broke ass niggas, get they ass some glue
I just left Sax, spent bout 10 racks
Moving so much weight, I got a six pack
Your bitch on my line, don't wanna hit that
Glizzy Gang nigga, fuck your sick [?]
