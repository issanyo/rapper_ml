[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
We been getting all this money
They think we joined Illuminati
Stunting outside in a Bugatti
Bitch, you hit the lottery
I'm tired of all this damn arguing
It's a blessing to be around me
How you not happy?
What you mean you're not happy?
Ungrateful bitches never happy
How you not happy?
What you mean you're not happy?
Ungrateful bitches never happy

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I can have a whole team, baby
Can't chase you, I'm chasin' dreams baby
She say, "What you mean, baby?"
Glizzy, Glizzy, bitch, I'm a star
This stupid ho keep on complaining, who the fuck is her
Had this one bitch named Toya
Beat that pussy up like De La Hoya
Told me she not sleeping at no courtyard
I just bought her a Goyard
Telling all her friends how I do her
That pussy so good that I go raw
I found my first bitch at the playground
She shot me in my heart like a fucking tray pound
I swear that bitch was so goddamn ungrateful
I start flying her around and put her on a Greyhound

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
We been getting all this money
They think we joined Illuminati
Stunting outside in a Bugatti
Bitch, you hit the lottery
I'm tired of all this damn arguing
It's a blessing to be around me
How you not happy?
What you mean you're not happy?
Ungrateful bitches never happy
How you not happy?
What you mean you're not happy?
Ungrateful bitches never happy

[Verse 2: Percy Keith]
That gangsta shit they talking I did ten times
I got feelings too, I'm just not in mine
They say nothing lasts forever, I hope this lasts forever
As long as you forever, keep your hips and ass together
If I use the wrong expression you gon' get the wrong impression
Lortabs and codeine, no headache or congestion'
Come on, let's be honest
You can't hide your disdain
Instagram pictures on Biscayne
I know my bitch missing my dick game
Waving your gun at me, you're just a wanna be
I'm what you wanna be, I'm who you wanna be
Stunting in front of me, nigga don't stunt on me
You just up under me, did what you done to be
Bitch wanna run with me, come to me once a week
Running her tongue on me, seems like the one to me
Fuck brothers calling me country
Lil bitch better not play with my money

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
We been getting all this money
They think we joined Illuminati
Stunting outside in a Bugatti
Bitch, you hit the lottery
I'm tired of all this damn arguing
It's a blessing to be around me
How you not happy?
What you mean you're not happy?
Ungrateful bitches never happy
How you not happy?
What you mean you're not happy?
Ungrateful bitches never happy
