[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
Yeah
Young Jefe, holmes
Elijah
Che che
Shinners
Oh

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
It's 2018, but we trappin’ like the '80s
And I'ma drive you crazy, I’m a dope boy, baby
I promise if I want you, then you gonna be my lady
And baby if I fuck you, you might want to have a baby
When it come to money, yeah, I used to have a problem
I had a single mom, she said I acted like my father
Streets what I was watchin', so I turned into a robber
Bitch, skills no dollar, Shy be jumpin' like the Carter, uh

[Verse: Shy Glizzy]
On my way to B-More and I'm ridin' with a K
Longest 30 30, that's forever and a day
Slidin' through the west, they say that's Jefe and they wave
Shout out Scooter, up next
Bitch, we live from the A
Bitch you got your nerve, oh, you must ain’t heard
My hittas like The Purge, they just waitin’ on the word
Ain't mean to say I love you, you just had me on the verge
Now I’m scurtin' off like Tino when I hit you with that curve

[Pre-Chorus]
Gone salute me, or gone shoot me
She said that this a new me, but she really never knew me
I know niggas had millions but they ended up like Pookie
Might be too little for Hollywood, but my life is a movie

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
It's 2018, but we trappin' like the ’80s
And I'ma drive you crazy, I'm a dope boy, baby
I promise if I want you, then you gonna be my lady
And baby if I fuck you, you might want to have a baby
When it come to money, yeah, I used to have a problem
I had a single mom, she said I acted like my father
Streets what I was watchin', so I turned into a robber
Bitch, skills no dollar, Shy be jumpin' like the Carter, uh

[Bridge: YBS Skola]
In DC coolin' with GG
This Colt 3 pass me the Gushers
It's the way that we be shinin'
Got them bad ones wanting to fuck us
Walk in just me and Vicky, no security, who gone touch us
Keep runnin' up them bands, so allergic to you busters

[Verse 2: YBS Skola]
Holler at 30 30 and Scooter and Truce
I know they smilin' down
A lot of niggas turned they back on me
And just don't turn back around
I see .45 lemon squeeze, don't reach for that Rollie Crown
All this lean probably gone fuck up my kids, I need to slow it down
I just stand tall
Tryna get these Ms like John Wall
Get ate up on a jail call
Gotta make sure my mans ball
Five deep and we can't fall
All my niggas dope boys
Came up off of straight raw
Middle of the summer
Have you ever seen this snow fall

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
It's 2018, but we trappin' like the '80s
And I'ma drive you crazy, I'm a dope boy, baby
I promise if I want you, then you gonna be my lady
And baby if I fuck you, you might want to have a baby
When it come to money, yeah, I used to have a problem
I had a single mom, she said I acted like my father
Streets what I was watchin', so I turned into a robber
Bitch, skills no dollar, Shy be jumpin' like the Carter, uh
