You know us
We're wanted where ever we at nigga
We don't care who the fuck
Go ahead, boot 'em up
Got a shooter in the cut all the fuck he know is shoot 'em up
They ain't cool as us
They tryna bite the swag, hell nah they ain't foolin' us
One time for the one time
And we chunkin' out the deuce two times for the you know what
You know what
You're word to a lame, so I'm sorry you can't sit with us

Once she know my name, see my chain, she gon' give it up
You know what
This nigga want a problem, we gon' solve it when I finish up
You know what
I came from the bottom, still mobbin', ain't givin' up

[Verse 1]
They say that I'm a menace to society
Come and get it, tre-seven where you'll find me
Rap niggas still mad they couldn't sign me
Mad that they old ass nigga need to be retiring
See first all I wanted was a new car
Then I spent that new car on a new watch
You can ask my whole hood do I run the block
And they still ain't hear me that my nigga Mari got shot
You like to shoot ball like we shoot Glocks
Got some young niggas that like to smoke pot
They mom don't pay the bill she like to smoke crack
I just hope they don't grow up to be a ho now

[Verse 2]
She just wanna do it for a real nigga
I know her style she gon' fuck whoever bills bigger
Called me papi, thought I was a little nigga
Until she seen Tommy come up out these Hilfigures
I told the bitch I like to get high
I like to get money and I like to get fly
These niggas tryna play me like my nigga don't ride
Now somebody pay me or these niggas gon' die
Ain't tryna be friendly, I just came to get a Bentley
Mil in my city, lotta haters in your city
I'm smashin' on your hoe if I think she look pretty
First class to my city, she be runnin' with the Glizzys
