Bitch it's Glizzy two times I got a bankroll
Call my migo he got thangs in the durango
Thug life I never said I was an angel

Connected in and respected
Disrespect you need detectives
Nigga ain't no question I'm toting my Smith and Wesson

Niggas know we been thuggin from the get go
Rob it tight (?)
Got mob tasks and get you knocked off if I want to
By time I was three I knew how to work a pistol
Hunned rounds drum it'll let the shit go
Who the fuck is that roll down the window
Our papers now so I can turn up how I want to

Beefin with my bruva yeah we got beef too
Show love ainâ€™t get the same love fuck people
Last of a dying breed these niggas see thru
Tote my glizzys like they mofuckin legal
