[Verse 1]
Niggas wasn't from my block, I went to war for them
And you can fuckin' ask the opps, I never forfeit them
Guess what? Today I fucked some new hoes, I was scorchin' them
The same hoes that used to play, now let the door hit 'em
Forever Tre-7 that's what made me
I thank God for this music that's what's savin' me
I bet I'll make that bitch regret it that she played with me
It ain't nothin' but a G thing, baby
Nothin' but a G thang pull up in my G wag'
Nigga where yo hood at? I don't need no G-pass
Bitch you see the way I'm drippin', tell me do you need swag?
You say you that nigga, but nobody don't believe that

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a war, started outside
Don't wanna talk about it, but somebody might die
Ain't wanna tell you 'bout it 'cause I know you might cry
Girl don't you ever doubt me no just look me in my eyes
Heard love is in the air, so I might fucking sky dive
They took my dog away, he didn't fuckin' survive
Now I'm livin' for today, that chopper ride when I ride
If these streets take me away, a real nigga I die

[Chorus]
A real nigga, I die
If these streets take me away, a real nigga, I die
Yeah, real nigga, I die
If these streets take me away, a real nigga, I die

[Verse 2]
That money alright, I don't need me a friend
We took a loss, now we eatin' again
She came back in my life, now she leavin' again
This is real life, I don't need me a pen
Pull up in a Benz and them bitches get in
Don't fuck with fake niggas, I'm realer than them
Triller than them, iller than them
I make the gang pull the trigger on them
I don't trust these bitches, these bitches is scandalous
Really been fuckin' these hoes since an amateur
She suck my dick while I count it up, count it up
I load the clip while she roll up the cannabis
You want a feature, go talk to my manager
Come to my trap house, don't pull out no cameras
You gave me your heart and I'm sorry I damaged ya
Baby I'm right here, look at me, I ran it up

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a war, started outside
Don't wanna talk about it, but somebody might die
Ain't wanna tell you 'bout it 'cause I know you might cry
Girl don't you ever doubt me no just look me in my eyes
Heard love is in the air, so I might fucking sky dive
They took my dog away, he didn't fuckin' survive
Now I'm livin' for today, that chopper ride when I ride
If these streets take me away, a real nigga I die

[Chorus]
A real nigga, I die
If these streets take me away, a real nigga, I die
Yeah, real nigga, I die
If these streets take me away, a real nigga, I die
