[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Okay bitch you undecided, I’m not really with surprises
And I bought that bitch some outfits, glad I got the wrong sizes
If you know anything bout Jefe, no I don’t do no hiding
And my lil bitch from London like when I rock that Sone Island
How you gonna act, baby? I got your back baby
She said “ Ain’t you a rapper? Why you still movin’ packs baby?”
Ain’t got no time to mingle, I came to break your back baby
My bitch is a singer, but she like them trap babies
Always been a thug, I rep where I’m from
Bitch I’m in the M club, so I do what I want
Fuckin’ up them bands, she gon’ let me fuck
I’m the ice cream man, yeah, this my ice cream truck, woo!

[Verse 2: 3 Glizzy]
I grew up in the trap
My uncle sold crack
Got the .30 and a Glock
Put a cooter on the map
Bitch I ain’t answer the phone cause I was beatin’ up the pack
Sometime I dream about my cousin
Pops ain’t never comin’ back
Police tries to pull me over
I didn’t stop, because I’m black
I got no license, I’m out on bond
I got too much shit in the back
Had to relocate the trap, I think they’re on to the spot
My niggas gon’ write about me
Right or wrong, I got their back
Put my lil bitch on your lap
She come get everything that you got
Put my young niggas on your line
When they come through, everybody gettin’ shot
I got pounds, when they come through
Promise you, everybody’s gettin’ taxed
Asked where the money counter
I told her, It’s right here on my lap

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I’m a trap baby
I’m a trap baby
I be  inside that vacant with them fuckin’ crack babies, hey!
I’m a trap baby
I’m a trap baby
All my niggas walkin’ ‘round with fuckin’ straps, baby, woo!
I’m a trap baby
I’m a trap baby
Bitch wanna get the dick
Ho, let me move the stash, baby, hey
I’m a trap baby
I’m a trap baby
Young nigga been hittin’ them licks
Swear you can go and ask, baby, woo!

[Verse 3: Pressa]
I’m a trap baby
My heart is black Hades
Your homicide early
My mask is Burberry
Got it out the black baby
Put niggas in the cemetery
I got it straight off the work
I used to eat them blueberries
I got it straight out the trap
I couldn’t really call it luck
I’m sauced up and saw an escape
Who said a real nigga couldn’t dance?
I shoot a nigga just because
I seen the plug and went down to my cousin
I used to trap a nigga uh
I used to trap, its only us, yeah
Trap it's only us
Open the sides for Nolia
Let me out I’m rollin up
Watch for target tolling up
I’m on the block with bro and them
Come right here, we showin them
I got a Glock I’ll rip a car
Yeah, this glizzy’ll tear you apart

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I’m a trap baby
I’m a trap baby
I still be in the bando with them fuckin’ crack babies, hey!
I’m a trap baby
I’m a trap baby
All my niggas walkin’ ‘round with fuckin’ straps, baby, woo!
I’m a trap baby
I’m a trap baby
Bitch wanna get this dick
Ho, let me move the stash, baby, hey
I’m a trap baby
I’m a trap baby
A nigga been hittin’ them licks
Swear you can go and ask, baby, woo!
