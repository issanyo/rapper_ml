[Chorus:]
Choppin for a long time
I've been out here choppin for a long time
Choppin for a long time
I've been out here choppin for a long time
Choppin for a long time
I've been out here choppin for a long time
Choppin for a long time
I've been out here choppin for a long time

[Verse 1:]
Ok i've been sippin on a dirty shit
That hoe been sniffin she ain't innocent she a dirty bitch
These rappers keep talkin this birdy shit
When will one a you niggas come get a thirty six
Jefe i just left for Medellin
Blow that big fat Brooks the call him butter B
Am one of the realest niggas you'll ever seen
I've been rockin vvs since i was seventeen
And if it ain't no kush you bet not send it
My young niggas take off again but that ain't none a my biness
Clowns in the trash cans glissy do the dishes
Dont nobody nobody fuck with my kitchen

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I've been out here trappin for a long time
All these bitches on mah dick cause i'm on now
Just coming in breaking down pounds soon as it touch down
Them court dates turn to tour dates now
These ain't no gimmick bitches going down
We got thirties we got fifties we got hundred rounds
Whole lotta rounds well run you down
Well run in your town ask nobody make a sound
Nobody can replace mah bitch the way she hold me down
She gonna buss these Glocks and she gone hold these pounds
Hold these pounds hey baby hold the pounds
If they send me down the road she gone hold me down

[Chorus]
