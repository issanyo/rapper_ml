[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
Yo yo, Glizzy, Guapo
Fly Money
And don't forget we smoke strong

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & Jose Guapo]
I can't wait to feel that rich feeling
See what it feel like to have a million
Money piled up to the ceiling
I can't wait to feel that rich feeling
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Oh, and don't forget we smoke strong

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I wonder how Bill Gates feel (Bill)
His name Bill and he got bills (Bill)
I can't wait to see my first mil (mil)
I'm just waitin' on the right deal (yeah)
I'm a street nigga for real (for real)
I'ma put the hood in my will (law)
For the right price I'll kill (bang bang)
I can hear the money, it sound like Lauryn Hill (yeah)
Drums in my guns (drums), bands in my pants (bands)
Buh-duh-duh-duh, I can hear it do the money dance (oh)
Sellin' Lindsay Lohan, smoking Reagan (yeah)
I got all these flocks, somebody put me on Instagram (flocks)

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & Jose Guapo]
I can't wait to feel that rich feeling
See what it feel like to have a million
Money piled up to the ceiling
I can't wait to feel that rich feeling
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Oh, and don't forget we smoke strong

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
Yeah, swisher sweets when I roll it, I'm just doing me
I can't wait to count a mil I'm talkin' two or three
If we talkin' 'bout Ferraris I need two at least
And every uncle hate to hear I'm fuckin' with his niece
Rich nigga daughters, them my biggest fans
Homecoming when we land, we playin' with them bands
Fast life, high life, fly life bitch
Pull up in the hood just to shoot dice bitch
I can't wait, I can't wait to cop a yacht
I can't wait to cop a jet, cop a helicopter next, uh
Real shit, I'm just waiting on that feeling
To have money in the wall and to have money in the ceiling, huh

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & Jose Guapo]
I can't wait to feel that rich feeling
See what it feel like to have a million
Money piled up to the ceiling
I can't wait to feel that rich feeling
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Oh, and don't forget we smoke strong
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Money (money), cars (cars), clothes (clothes) and hoes (hoes)
Oh, and don't forget we smoke strong
