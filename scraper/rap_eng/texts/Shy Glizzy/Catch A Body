[Chorus]
Walking with my .40, I might catch a body
Rollin', rollin', ridin', I might catch a body
Rollin' off the molly, I might catch a body
Rollie cost 'bout 40, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body

[Verse 1]
Know you wanna rob me, all this damn Versace
These niggas Steve Harvey, they ain't never shot nobody
All this damn gold like a nigga came from Saudi
Back up, oh no, I might have to catch a body
Cuban link my chain, Cuban link my cocaine
Smoking on that gas, yeah, nigga, propane
Balling like LeBron James, nigga, what the fuck you mean?
Bitch walking with us on lean, she live life, she eat lo mein
Call my nigga Zay, bring them beats to me
He said I gotta wait, I say no, need them today
Niggas after me, tell them niggas pray
Glizzy gettin' paid, how much did I make today?

[Chorus]
Walking with my .40, I might catch a body
Rollin', rollin', ridin', I might catch a body
Rollin' off the molly, I might catch a body
Rollie cost 'bout 40, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I'm in my zone, YSL cologne
Smoking on that strong, how the fuck I make this song
Your bitch won't leave me alone, she gone off that Patron
Yeah, I got it, homes, don't talk dirty in my phone
Pull up to Santa Fe, that BM with a J
My bitch got a big ass, make her a lot of K's
Hold up, goddamn, shout out to my trap
Ride through my set, shoot your ass with no mess
Young rich nigga, sell a lot of coca
Got a rich bitch, I think she the next Oprah
Niggas be on Twitter, sitting on the sofa
Nigga, I'mma hit her, put your ass in the coffin

[Chorus]
Walking with my .40, I might catch a body
Rollin', rollin', ridin', I might catch a body
Rollin' off the molly, I might catch a body
Rollie cost 'bout 40, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
I might catch a body, I might catch a body
