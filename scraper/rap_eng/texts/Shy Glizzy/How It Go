[Intro]
Jefe!

[Hook]
This one for my bros
Standing over the stove
I remember running out the store
But that was back when I ain’t know
Now a nigga gettin’ dough
I’m fuckin' all these hoes that I don’t know
These niggas workin with the po-po’s
That's why I don’t fuck with niggas I don’t know
But you know how it go

[Verse 1]
Jefe
Pull up with my esés
With SKs, all black Chevrolets
Watch what you say, might turn into your birthday
Let it spray, bitch we make it earthquake
She wanna join the team cause she see dollar signs
She wanna fuck the king? I told her fall in line
Drop top Bentley with the frog eyes
Bitch hopped inside, she said ‘it’s ball time’
Geeked up off the lean, I’m an animal
Pull up to the scene, I got the antidote
My jewelry lookin’ clean, and I’m so fuckin’ dope
Glizzys with the beam at your cantaloupe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I can’t fuck with these niggas cause they mad 50
This one for my niggas who gon’ blast 50
I had to grab a bitch so she can swag wit me
I had to find a bitch to get some cash with me
Balmain on my body, I’m so fuckin’ fly
They think I’m doing shows, I’m selling fucking pies
I just whipped the dope, now let it fuckin’ dry
I never seen a man cry, ‘til I seen a man die
She like me cause I’m handsome with them Benjamins
Say she never fucked a nigga who was real as this
Where I’m from them youngins robbin’, killin’, stealin’ shit
And if you play with Jefe boy I promise they gon’ peel your shit

[Hook]
