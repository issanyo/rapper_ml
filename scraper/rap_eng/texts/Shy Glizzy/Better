[Hook]
I 'ont know no better
But, I'm trynna do better
I 'ont know no better
But, I'm trynna do better
I grew up on Glocks, rugers, and barretas
I 'ont know no better
I'm just trynna do better
Lord knows that I'm trynna do better
Put the bullshit aside, and get the cheddar
I'm just trynna do better

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I been in the streets my whole life
Sometimes I'm scared to go too sleep at night
I can't go back to my old life
This rap shit made me see the light
I run my whole city now
I'm all you hear when you ride around (Skrrt)
Fuck everyone who tried to take me down
Mr. King finally got his crown
Scarface identity
I'm a mother fucking intity
You niggas gonna remember me
I'm prepared for my frienemies
I'm a rapper, I'm a rapper, I'm a rapper, aw
I can not believe I'm a rapper
