[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Hundred thousand up in my wall (racks)
Fuck I look like signin'? Let me sign y'all
Bitch I know you better answer when the don call
Or I'ma hit my second bitch like John Wall
John Wall, John Wall
I'm ballin' on these niggas like I'm John Wall
John Wall, John Wall
I keep me 2 pistols, call me John Wall

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
All these niggas stallers, I'm a damn starter
Big Glizzy, baby, I'm a shot caller
All my niggas look like they just left from ball hoggin'
And your niggas look like they just left the beauty parlor
It don't cost a fuckin' cent to keep it real
Shit don't make no sense, these niggas ain't street for real
Young boy you so ill, shoot your ass like Beal
Glizzy Gang no chill, better keep your steel
I'm not committed, I got 2 bitches
I got a couple send me nude pictures
They say don't no nigga kick it the way you kick it
I think I might hop in the shoe business

John Wall, John Wall
I'm ballin' on these niggas like I'm John Wall
John Wall, John Wall
I keep me 2 pistols, call me John Wall

[Verse 2: Lil Mouse]
Fuck I look like signin'? Let me sign y'all
All these diamonds in my chain, I just might blind y'all
I keep 2 shooters with me, call me John Wall
You wanna act, he grab that MAC and he gon' blam y'all
Magic Johnson in that clip but he let 9 off
All these shooters on my roster shoot like John Wall
Me and Glizzy in that 'Rari with the top off
Stephen Curry and that Glock 4 shoot your top off
I got a hundred Franklins in my Balmain
In my hood, them shorties shootin' like a gun range
Niggas runnin', hoppin' gates when them guns aim
Ridin' 'round, blowin' gas, call it propane
