[Intro]
Who the realest?
Rest in peace that nigga Soulja Slim man
Free C-Murder

[Verse 1]
Ain’t the one that sit up on the sofa
I’m the one that tote the gun without the holster
Somebody told my mama that I owe her
Because she gave birth to two soldiers
I remember she had the Corolla
Look how shit changed, now she got a Rover
Me and baby three done got older
Must be fun to see some rich niggas grow up
I been a real nigga from the get go
They ain’t wanna fuck with me for shit though
Same old niggas on my dick though
Lil Quis bossed up and got rich though
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
They got my niggas in the court screaming, “Your honor, please!”
And all these bitches wanna fuck me for my honesty
Mama done cried for this shit and niggas had to leave
I’m still thuggin’ for forever I’ll be double G
Yeah, let it rain bitch, let it rain
Go ‘head and let it rain bitch
I promise you that you gon’ feel my pain bitch

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I’m screaming Glizzy Gang forever
Whole mob up in Moncler for the cold weather
Lately I been going through a lot of pressure
Promethazine and codeine get my mind together
All these fuck niggas on the same shit
Every day instagraming on the same bitch
I seen a couple niggas in my same kicks
Tell them lame niggas we ain’t got the same limp
Niggas wasn’t really down to ride
I’ma shit on them, they fuckin’ with the other side
Wooh, and don’t worry I ain’t got no pride
I’m gon’ make your bitch go rent a whip from Enterprise
Then I make my nigga do a drive-by
How the fuck they goin’ through a walkthrough
When them choppers come out you should see them niggas’ eyes
Come here nigga, Jefe wanna talk to you
Got some niggas on me never see again
Got some bitches that ain’t tryna let me meet their friends
After this I might go cop a BM
And pick a nigga bitch up for the weekend
Yeah, straight gangster shit
Young Jefe homes

[Hook]
They got my niggas in the court screaming, “Your honor, please!”
And all these bitches wanna fuck me for my honesty
Mama done cried for this shit and niggas had to leave
I’m still thuggin’ for forever I’ll be double G
Yeah, let it rain bitch, let it rain
Go ‘head and let it rain bitch
I promise you that you gon’ feel my pain bitch
