Im goin hard, goin hard
All I used to do is rob
Now im in the studio
Making this music shit my job
And dese niggas so soft
They then let me in the door
I ain't gotta rap no more
Labels knocking at my door
Im goin hard, goin hard
All I used to do is rob
Now im in the studio
Makin this music shit my job
And dese niggas so soft
They then let me in the door
I ain't gotta rap no more
Labels knocking at my door

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Im tired of playing wit dese niggas
Dese niggas act like bitches
Im tired of fucking dese bitches
I need me a mistress
Wear a scarf around my head like a Taliban
Loud got me so high, Looking Like Im from Japan
See, me and my niggas rob the Venetian stores
And I got a couple guns you ain't seen Before
They like "Oh my God, you den let him in the door"
And every nigga bitch dont want to fuck with him no more
I can't blame em doe, nigga I dont want your ho
I can't, I can't blame her doe nigga I dont want your ho
Bitches Double G we going to be the same for life
I swear I been supposed to die, They ain't aim it right

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Im in the studio Writing, writing all night
Me And you ain't Vibin nigga do you want to fight
Check my street credit I got tiger stripes
My bullets leave wounds that look like tiger bites
I got .30 in my denim and I ain't scared to bust them
Niggas think Im gonna friend em, but me I'm like fuck 'em
Couple Niggas said Im A Bitch
Couple niggas did a diss
On my father grave them couple niggas ain't gone do shit
I be all out in these clubs, all out in theses streets
People walk to me and say I run DC
I say Im the future, the Future of the Nation
Every single thing I do is history in the making

[Hook]

I got my mask on and im tipping
Wassup with you pimping
No Im not your Homie, do I look like the Simpsons
My Glock loaded Im riding
Based on me he Jiving
We out here surviving, you touch my drugs You buy it
Im a young street nigga, Lord OG
Streets Hottest Youngin, everybody know me
Bitch im from the Yo, I say it on every song
I fuck a nigga ho she scream my name out on every moan
Your head in the car, my seat leaned back
Her ass on the dash and her head in my lap
A nigga stabbed me where it say Glizzy at
God Ain't want me, he said I ain't have A Milli Yet
