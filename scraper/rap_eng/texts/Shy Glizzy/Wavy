[Intro]
Yeah
Young Jefe, holmes
I'm so wavy, wavy, yeah

[Chorus]
I rep that Glock shit like it pay me
Tre-7, that's the block that made me
They say the rap shit 'posed to save me
Free Max B, I think I'm wavy
I got a girl, she educated
All these babies havin' babies
This shit crack just like the '80s
Young Jefe back and bitch, I'm wavy

[Verse 1]
Money come fast and it ain't slowin' down
Ain't know me then, I bet she know me now
I'm turnt up, bitch, I ain't turnin' down
Walk in this bitch, I got a hundred rounds
She got some followers, then went Hollywood
I fucked her anyway, it's all good
She fuckin' ball, place on the hardwood
I tricked that bitch just like a dog should
She say, "You daddy," I say, "I better be"
She say these other niggas just charity
I got that sauce, they want the recipe
Yeah, I'm the realest nigga you'll ever meet

[Chorus]
I rep that Glock shit like it pay me
Tre-7, that's the block that made me
They say the rap shit 'posed to save me
Free Max B, I think I'm wavy
I got a girl, she educated
All these babies havin' babies
This shit crack just like the '80s
Young Jefe back and bitch, I'm wavy

[Verse 2]
If we ain't got it, we gon' take some
The police snatch us, we ain't gon' say nothin'
Why all these niggas pullin' fake stunts?
Bitch tryna kick it, that's a fake punt
And I got a bad soul, word to my last ho
Nigga you an asshole, I got that bag though
Jefe, he the real pope, he give the hood hope
Told her I'm a dope boy, she think I'm real dope
Ooh, she think I'm wavy, I think she's amazing
Have a baby by me, baby, buy you a Mercedes
Have you in the latest, I can't do no bacon
Know you heard about me, they call me Glizzy Glizzy, baby

[Chorus]
I rep that Glock shit like it pay me
Tre-7, that's the block that made me
They say the rap shit 'posed to save me
Free Max B, I think I'm wavy
I got a girl, she educated
All these babies havin' babies
This shit crack just like the '80s
Young Jefe back and bitch, I'm wavy

[Outro]
I rep that Glock shit like it pay me
Tre-7, that's the block that made me
They say the rap shit 'posed to save me
Free Max B, I think I'm wavy
I got a girl, she educated
All these babies havin' babies
This shit crack just like the '80s
Young Jefe back and bitch, I'm wavy
