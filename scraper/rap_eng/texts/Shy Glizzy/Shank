[Intro]
Yeah
Young Jefe holmes, woo
Ayy, GG, 30 30, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm a street nigga, baby I'm a street nigga
You fuck with weak niggas, girl you fuck with cheap niggas
I don't peep niggas, I don't ever peep niggas
I like to feed niggas, I don't ever need niggas
If you play with the mob then you gon' be deceased nigga
Don't make me hit that backspace and go 'head delete niggas
I'm rocking [?], I'm by the palm trees nigga
Got my chopper by my arm, somebody alarm these niggas
Yeah I'm sliding in that down, got a hundred on me nigga
In a minute I'm going to buy big B that Rari nigga
They took my bro, I'm still in pain, I want kill all these niggas
I do anything for the gang, we'll shit on all these niggas yeah

[Chorus]
I'm the realest young nigga, don't you think
I got hitters come get you, don't you blink
Good weed and good drank, that bitch gon' blank
Look at that boy, he lookin' sharper than a shank
I'm the realest young nigga, don't you think
I got hitters come get you, don't you blink
Good weed and good drank, that bitch gon' blank
Look at that boy, he lookin' sharper than a shank

[Verse 2]
These niggas hot, I had to cut some of my woes
My bitch so hot I had to cut off all my hoes
Yeah I'm so solid, I swear to god I'll never fold
I know some bams like to play all in they nose

Baby I'm a hot boy like Lil Turk (hot boy)

I know it hurt, they seen me come up from the dirt

You can't get in my way lil nigga, on your best day
Bitch I keep a thirty on me, that's like every day (30 30)
I'm from thirty-seven homie, that's a scary place, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm the realest young nigga, don't you think
I got hitters come get you, don't you blink
Good weed and good drank, that bitch gon' blank
Look at that boy, he lookin' sharper than a shank
I'm the realest young nigga, don't you think
I got hitters come get you, don't you blink
Good weed and good drank, that bitch gon' blank
Look at that boy, he lookin' sharper than a shank
