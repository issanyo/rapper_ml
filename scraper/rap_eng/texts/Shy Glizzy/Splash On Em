[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
Oh
Young Jefe, holmes
Wooh!

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Foreign shoes, I kick you in the ass with ‘em
I got some foreign whips, I do the dash in ‘em
I’m baggin ‘every bitch who got an ass on her
I just got a bag, can’t wait to splash on ‘em
Splash on ‘em, splash on ‘em
I’m baggin ‘every bitch who got an ass on her
Splash on ‘em, splash on ‘em
I just got a bag, can’t wait to splash on ‘em

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
Pour up the syrup and splash
Rolling my weed on my cast
I got rose gold on my bag
I sip my syrup too fast
I took your bitch and you mad
I took your bitch and we walking by
None of my niggas gon’ testify
I’m pouring up drink in the sky
Yeah, pints on the plane
All my bitches got aim
Rose gold on my body
Bust out right now, plain jane
I’m dripping the sauce, yeah I’m kicking water
I’m flying with bitches to pimp ‘em harder
I never wanted to be Vince Carter
Morris Chestnut or Michael Jordan
I just wanted to be a pimp
I just wanted to stack the shrimp
Fine bitches where I live
Finally ball in Brazil
Smoking weed in the hills
Yellow teeth, wagon dapper deal
Ballin’ just to let my bitches splash for real
Kicking flavor I got master skill

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Foreign shoes, I kick you in the ass with ‘em
I got some foreign whips, I do the dash in ‘em
I’m baggin ‘every bitch who got an ass on her
I just got a bag, can’t wait to splash on ‘em
Splash on ‘em, splash on ‘em
I’m baggin ‘every bitch who got an ass on her
Splash on ‘em, splash on ‘em
I just got a bag, can’t wait to splash on ‘em

[Verse 2: Sancho Saucy]
I can’t wait to splash on these niggas
Camo flow [?] and I’m like a lizard
Run up on me, I’ma pop my pistol
Run up on me I’ma down a nigga
Heard that nigga got a bag on me
Bitch sexy in the J homie
And every day I’m out here in these streets
Niggas can’t be out here tryna look for me
Hickory dickory dock
My bitches bought me a watch
I’ma fuck her on the yacht, ooh
Show my ass like a baboon
Big booty, she a full moon
I’ma bump until the morning
These bitches wanna have an orgy
But I told these bitches that they can’t afford it
I cop more than Forgiatos do
Excuse me baby if I’m bored at you
How these diamonds looking on my tooth?
Clean huh? [?] as my pinky ring huh
Ain’t this shit you never seen, huh
Everybody talking ‘bout they flossing, bling bling bling
But they shit don’t sing huh

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Foreign shoes, I kick you in the ass with ‘em
I got some foreign whips, I do the dash in ‘em
I’m baggin ‘every bitch who got an ass on her
I just got a bag, can’t wait to splash on ‘em
Splash on ‘em, splash on ‘em
I’m baggin ‘every bitch who got an ass on her
Splash on ‘em, splash on ‘em
I just got a bag, can’t wait to splash on ‘em
