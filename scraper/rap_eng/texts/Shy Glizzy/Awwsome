[Hook]
Swish, I'm balling
I'm so awwsome
Old bitch keep calling
She think I'm awwsome
Jackboys wanna rob me
I'm so awwsome
Out here like a possum
I'm so, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome

[Verse 1]
Oh my fucking God, pull up in that, oh my gosh
These niggas so soft, get that arrow out your heart
You can be a boss or you can get a job
You do not go hard, you's a motherfucking fraud
Young Jefe,  I got blow you can sell away
Broke boy, you are not my friend, you need to get away
Call up my driver tell him scoop me in his Escalade
Night Sunday, bet 1000 bucks on Tampa Bay
Got a lot of spots like a motherfucking cheetah
All we do is trap, my OGs still got beepers
Bad little kiddy, momma took my ass to jeepers
Tryna get a ticket like no money in the meter

[Hook]
Swish, I'm balling
I'm so awwsome
Old bitch keep calling
She think I'm awwsome
Jackboys wanna rob me
I'm so awwsome
Out here like a possum
I'm so, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome

[Verse 2]
Make these niggas sick, chicken noodle soup
Chickens in my coupe, it's a fucking chicken coop
Young nigga a fool, I just saw your boo
My bitch, she so cute, that's my little boo
She from down in Austin, her family balling
Baby, I'm a stunner, just like Stone Cold Steve Austin
One bitch gave me blue balls, I think she from Slauson
Walking around with two dogs, boom, John Wallin
Higher then a blimp, leaning like I'm pimp
40 by my Fendi, got me walking with a limp
I'm not signing no bitch unless she nasty like Lil Kim
I got a lot of weight, I do not go to the gym

[Hook]
Swish, I'm balling
I'm so awwsome
Old bitch keep calling
She think I'm awwsome
Jackboys wanna rob me
I'm so awwsome
Out here like a possum
I'm so, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
I'm so fucking awwsome, I'm so awwsome
