[Hook]
I've gone too far
To turn back now
(?) be
But I go higher
I've gone too far
To turn back now
(?) be
But I go higher

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
They said I couldn't make music
How they gon' understand and ain't been through it
I hate doin' new drugs, I amuse it
No love but that Molly turn you into Cupid
When I get that new gun I wanna shoot it
Or rob a nigga, hopin' he refuse it
I don't wanna make cocaine music
Cause I really sold white to cocaine users
Mike found me in ATL
Got a bitch that work at Onyx, stay in the 12
My Pa made a bastard on 12/12
I went and got a face tat when I was 12

[Hook]
I've gone too far
To turn back now

But I go higher
I've gone too far
To turn back now
(?) be
But I go higher

[Verse 2: Wale]
I got a song when niggas ain't wanna listen to tell
Gave me a crown, I declined, I hate attention
Trap rappers and backpackers and (?)
This shit is monumental, all you niggas sight seeing
Bitin' me but they're so cold it's like fever
Two dyke beavers in my beamer for pipe, clean up
Can't stop me, 37 Beamer
Southside, it's Gucci, play the double T up
Glizzy gang bust quick like Minute-made
I tell the youngin's to chill but who I'm gettin' man
They so far gone movin' hard, smokin' strong
Leave a (?) no (?)
But can't save 'em with a song, Lord

[Hook]
I've gone too far
To turn back now
(?) be
But I go higher
I've gone too far
To turn back now

But I go higher

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy]
And I'm still in the trap game
You thought that was gonna change cause the rap game?
A lot of dreams, ain't no motherfuckin' sack came
I carried a whole gang, I got back pain
Tryna buy mommy a new car
And grandma a new house in Utah
Cause she Jazzy, who cares if it's too far
We tryna go and no, I know who you are
Groupie bitches be like don't you be with Wale?
No I be with Ralph bitch, that's my brozay
Only champagne she know about is Rozay
Oh Lord, I can't wait to get far away
I can't wait to get far away
Oh Lord, I can't wait to get far away
I can't wait to get far away
Oh Lord, I can't wait to get far away

[Hook]
I've gone too far
To turn back now

But I go higher
I've gone too far
To turn back now

But I go higher
