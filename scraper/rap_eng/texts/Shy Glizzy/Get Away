[Intro]
Young Jefe holmes
Get away
Pussy, money, weed
GG lifestyle
Forever ever

[Chorus]
I wanted too much shit, my mama told me get away
I had to hit a lick, you know I had to get away
My gun got two clips but yeah this bitch a throwaway
I just got a new bitch, my old one still be in the way
Get away, get away
Sorry I ain't tryna argue, no bitch I'ma get away
Get away, get away
I just got a new chopper, that bitch make you get away

[Verse 1]
Yeah it's 'bout one in the morning and a nigga catching plays
Don't turn in my condo and this shit look like a maze
Summer time coming, niggas gotta get a Wraith
And if you owe me money they might find you in the lake
Them Glizzys pull up with them, ask you open up your safe
I swear behind this shit, I'm down with GG 'til I'm gray
Meet me at the big house, baby put that shit in waste
We gon' work this shit out, I'm gon' watch that ass for days
I wake up, fuck my bitch, then I go out and get paid
Hundred round drum, I bet this bitch knock off your fade
Every million that I get then all my niggas get a raise
Why you salty lil bitch, that could've been us but you played

[Chorus]
I wanted too much shit, my mama told me get away
I had to hit a lick, you know I had to get away
My gun got two clips but yeah this bitch a throwaway
I just got a new bitch, my old one still be in the way
Get away, get away
Sorry I ain't tryna argue, no bitch I'ma get away
Get away, get away
I just got a new chopper, that bitch make you get away

[Verse 2]
Half a million worth of shining, bitch I look like the boat
I remember hard times, I had to cut up some soap
You couldn't be there for you bro 'cause you was playin' with your ho
Let's say a prayer for my son, that's who I do this shit for
All she need is a real nigga to put her in her place
Baby I'm a robber, can you be my get away?
First time I ever met her swear you should've seen her face
She was swaggin' in her lab and I was trappin' out my yay
Quarter brick, half a brick, I was choppin' out my way
Know some niggas filthy rich and they be trappin' in the Bay
Got this one bitch bad as shit, that thing be clappin' when I slay
Man these niggas fake as shit so I don't dap 'em to say hey

[Chorus]
I wanted too much shit, my mama told me get away
I had to hit a lick, you know I had to get away
My gun got two clips but yeah this bitch a throwaway
I just got a new bitch, my old one still be in the way
Get away, get away
Sorry I ain't tryna argue, no bitch I'ma get away
Get away, get away
I just got a new chopper, that bitch make you get away
