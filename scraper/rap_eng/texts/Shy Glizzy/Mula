[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Oh, ah, oh, ah
I keep me some shootas
I know niggas got some mula
On my medulla
Your bitch, she a chooser
I don't wanna do her
All I wanna do, ah
Chase, chase this mula
Chase, chase, chase this mula
All I wanna do, ah
Chase, chase this mula
Chase, chase, chase this mula
All I wanna do, ah

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Lil nigga know he cannot swim with sharks
I can't wait for 106 & Park
Baby, 3 yeah, that's my fucking heart
Nigga, I got that sack, I run it up
I'm a money making maniac
I don't write no raps
Write a fucking check
Nigga, I be in the trap
I be where the killers and the robbers at
Trey Seven
On my block, we got a lot of crime
Junkies come and get a blast
We got a lot of straps, do not get your ass blast

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Oh, ah
I keep me some shootas
I know niggas got some mula
On my medulla
Your bitch, she a chooser
I don't wanna do her
All I wanna do, ah
Chase, chase this mula
Chase, chase, chase this mula
All I wanna do, ah
Chase, chase this mula
Chase, chase, chase this mula
All I wanna do, ah

[Verse 2: 3 Glizzy]
In troubled waters, I learned how to float
You niggas bluffin' just like Curtis Snow
Damn, pigs done got all of my niggas
Double G, bitch, we the fucking realest
Just cause you breathing, that don't mean you living
Omert√†, fuck a hot nigga
Respect keep you in play, nigga
F&N on my waist, shoot at your face, nigga
I was fucked up, but I'm good now
Chopper quad your whole hood down
I was fucked up, but I'm good now
Chopper quad your whole damn hood down

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Oh, ah
I keep me some shootas
I know niggas got some mula
On my medulla
Your bitch, she a chooser
I don't wanna do her
All I wanna do, ah
Chase, chase this mula
Chase, chase, chase this mula
All I wanna do, ah
Chase, chase this mula
Chase, chase, chase this mula
All I wanna do, ah
