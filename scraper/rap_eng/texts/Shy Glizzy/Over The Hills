[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I can't fuck up this money, no I gotta keep stackin' it
Nobody's perfect but girl I think you're immaculate
I just want them Ms
Tell them lil niggas they can keep them racks and shit
Cause I really blow racks and shit
I ain't with no coppin' shit
I ain't with no rapper shit
I be with them choppers bitch
Niggas really really got that work
Make that shit do backwards flips
Lil bitch ain't got no hips she so immaculate
And they say I like bad bitches only that's so accurate
Yeah my bitch so fine, young nigga I'm on my grind
If it ain't bout no dime, nigga ain't got no time
I don' ran my bands up high
You see that shit yeah that's mine, Glizzy Gang CEO

[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
Now nigga be real with me

If shit got too real will you steal for me
If I'm hungry would you share your last meal for me
Come and sign on this million dollar deal with me
Cause you good with me if I'm good with you
Show these niggas how the real fuckin' bosses do
I'm a winner but I still take a loss with you
Cause you ain't just about word play nigga Langston Hughes
Everyday feel like a birthday when we coming up
If I say I want that he gon' run it up
And the pipe so right make you fall in love
All mine yeah he hard to get a hold of
Keep me in that designer bag
I ain't never gotta ask where them diamonds at
I ain't never gotta ask if the bills is paid
So I never let another nigga infiltrate
Cause I'm rocked up niggas know I'm solid too
Hold every secret until my face is blue
Ride shotgun in the wraith with you
And I dare a groupie bitch try and make a move
Cause I, I'ma ride for mine
I'ma stand in the field with him every time
If that nigga need a boost I'ma help him climb
If he say he that one I'm his 99, get it?

She gon' go over the hills for me
Now baby be real with me
Will you step in the field with me

Yeah come get a mil with me
And yeah she gon' kill with me
Designer her bag and her heels with me
My dick game amazin' she good with me
She gon' go over the hills for me
