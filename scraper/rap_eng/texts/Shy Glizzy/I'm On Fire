[Intro]
One time for Benny
Nigga been down since day one
Real nigga in this bitch
Rest in peace, Stew, a.k.a. Twin Glocks
There's a lot of young niggas runnin' around here
Calling their selves bosses
But

[Hook]
I could have been a lawyer or a doctor
I said fuck that, I need mula, I'm a robber
You ain't gon' be sure what you grow up, you a liar
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
[x2]

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is this the street shit
Fuck my teacher, she a ho, she ain't teach me shit
She told me, boy you know you ain't gon' be shit
I linked up with the plug, and he threw me bricks
I'm a dope boy, you a broke boy
You be rapping bout this life shit ain't no joke, boy
If you disrespect my team then you get smoked, boy
See, it ain't 'bout who you is, it's who you know, boy
If the feds come and get you what you gon' do?
You gon' let em take you down, or take your whole crew
Wit you, is you gon' stay true?
Cause that's what real niggas do
Ooh!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I could have went to Howard but I am a trapper
I didn't go to Howard till I became a rapper
They tell me that my papa who I take after
A nigga killed my papa, so I was a bastard
My mama couldn't understand what gotten into me
Dropped out of school just to sell cocaine and weed
I got my GED in the Penitentiary
I keep some legs a me like a fucking centipede
I rob you for your phone or your foams
I'm wrong
Smoking on that strong, but my mind gone
I'm so dope, sipping dope outta Styrofoam
I want that gas that see a ghost
Bitch be gone

[Hook]
