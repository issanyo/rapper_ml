[Intro]

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
My hood full of crackheads and hustlers
And we was taught too be tougher then others
Yeah, bitch I come from nothing
Yeah, bitch I come from nothing
My hood full of crackheads and hustlers
And we was taught too be tougher then others
Yeah, bitch I come from nothing
Yeah, bitch I come from nothing

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I'm from where niggas don't know their mothers
They like fuck religion
Brothers killing brothers
My cousin twelve years old
And he'll bust ya
Fuck a confession
Nigga we ain't usher
I been struggling for nineteen years and running
I don't think they understand where I'm coming from
Uh, I live by the gun
I might die by the gun
Hold on, I wanna have a son
I might name him Lloyd
Or I might name him Matt
His mother said Devonte
That bitch a hood rat
I ain't never free
Bitch, I beez in the trap
I ain't know what to be
So I went straight for the rap

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Thirty-Seventh street
Southeast baby
I've been on these streets ever since I was a baby
It's loud now
But that regular what raised me
I used to steal dutches out off candy lady
Grandma was on welfare
Every week we get the cheese
Uncle had brick fare
But he lived with us
What good was he
I was riding in stolen Jeeps
This is just like last week
Now I'm writing to a beat
Lord have mercy on me
Uhh, I wasn't blessed to be LeBron
I wasn't blessed to have a Micheal Vick arm
Yeah I got good neighbors like State Farm
But I had to alarm them that I stayed armed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy]
Glizzy, why ya'll call that shit the Yo
Cause we will take your money
Take your drugs
And take your Ho
Oh, nigga don't act like you didn't know
I been selling drugs since I was 12 years old
Niggas forty, drinking forties
Nine, shooting nines
Niggas ain't even live
And they already dying
Fuck the police
They ain't stopping my grind
They gave my niggas fed time
Before they could tell time
I remember my first gun
A fucking 380
Hadta to rob a hundred niggas
Man, that shit was too crazy
Used to see my old heads pulling up in new Mercedes
Like Mitch told Ace
Just give me ten days B

[Hook]
