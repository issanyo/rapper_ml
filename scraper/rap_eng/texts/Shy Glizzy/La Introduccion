From now on, nothing goes down unless I'm involved. No blackjack no dope deals, no nothing. A nickel bag gets sold in the park, I want in. You guys got fat while everybody starved on the street. Now it's my turn

[Bigga Rankin]
It's a lot of young niggas running around calling themselves bosses
I gotta shout my niggs Glizzy out nigga
Niggas getting money
Making motherfucking major moves
By his motherfucking self
Self made in this Bitch!

[Shy Glizzy]
Today I seen bricks
A lot, A lot of bricks
These Giuseppes are 40, got a .40 on my hip
Plug told me "Shy, boy, you gonna be rich!"
Now he wanna be best boys, I get 'em off too quick
I took a trip too Cuba, met Ricky he the ruler
My necklace is Cuban, shout out too my jeweler
I'm a winner, you're a loser, I'm a giver, you're a user
You're bitch, she a chooser, on my dick, she droolin'
I pop champagne for a night, I'm in pain, I'm suffering
Make it rain, all hundreds, better make that pussy keep jumping
My young niggas on drugs, they don't really get no love
For an 8-ball and some dubs
They'll send your ass flying with the dubs
I sell , narcotics, to put money in my pocket
You want it, I got it, you touch it, then you buy it
These shoes, designer, you want 'em, can't find 'em
Flew to Rome, not China, Big Dog, you a minor
Need a job, got work, broke bitch, betta twerk
I'm high, off Earth, I'll take a nigga ass off Earth
Coolin' with my Eses, they toatin them SK's
I got water, I got yay
Young Jefe
