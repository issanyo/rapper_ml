[Intro :]
Jefe ! Free 3 ! Shit don't stop , People do

[Hook : Shy Glizzy]
Just because you breathing that don't mean you living
My Little bro said because you breathing that don't mean you living
And there hasn't been a lot of killing or no drug dealing
Niggas been kicking it with snitches what the fuck is this ?
Got all these all these strangers up in my business fuck the fame, can't let it change the way that i’m living
Shout out to my fans they stay down and i did it
Hell nah that ain't my message i killed him

[Verse 1 :]
Little bruh got caught in the jam but he still living
He ain't have to hit the gas but he still did it
Fuck the popos boy [this K got me a meal ticket]
Boy I just got me a mill ticket
All this pain im going insane I gotta deal with it
(hey) Fuck all my enemies and no that nigga not my nigga he’s a [frenemie]
I keep my gun on me, that 100 round you im goin spray
So Icey boy my diamonds cost a hundred k
I just left the store [and all i bought was baking soda]

And Boy my house so cold that bih so cold like Minnesota
Fuck all these niggas know they tryna fuck me over

[Hook]

[Verse 2 :]
Fuck a dart case I just gave the lawyer 5K
Told him do whatever it take  just make it fly away
