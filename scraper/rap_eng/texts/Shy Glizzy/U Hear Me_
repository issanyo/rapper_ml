[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
(Uh)
I hustle!
I hustle!
And they goin' respect this cuz niggas ain't hustlin'
You hear me?
(Uh)
Real nigga though
You hear me?
I hustle!
I hustle!
And they goin' respect this cuz niggas ain't hustlin'
You hear me?

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
While they havin' fun
I be in the field
Fuck throwin' ones
Bitch I gotta pay for milk
I had to cop a foreign
Had to see how it feel
Still ain't got a license
Strapped, no seatbelts
Runnin' with some niggas
And they swear that they down
Mama been warned me
She said "Son they some clowns!"
Niggas get paranoid
When they hear some sounds
Hope we don't get jammed
Or my ass going' down
And you don't gotta snake me
Cuz I am a man
I hate to break it down
But everybody ain't the man
Niggas love me down
Cuz we came from the sand
Now we can't even get down
Cuz that shit might hurt my brand

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
You hear me?
These niggas don't hustle
I hustle
You hear me?
They don't hear me though
(Aw)

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Moms trying to move
Baby bro need a car
So I gotta go hard
Baby boy be a star
Im niggas way out
But they want me in a box
From what I recall
It was just me and the Glock
Glizzy gang
You ain't a glizzy
If you ain't got a glizzy
How you a glizzy
And you ain't shot a glizzy?
You hear me?
They tripping'
They silly
How you broke nigga?
You be with Glizzy
You hear me
(Come on man)
2011 I was getting on the bus
Beefin' with the world
Could've got my ass bust
Tried to give my niggas something different
Called trust
They actin' all stuck up
Like a niggas ain't just touch
What the fuck?

[Outro: Shy Glizzy]
I'm outta here
You hear me?
I don't know about these niggas
But I'm outta here
You hear me?
