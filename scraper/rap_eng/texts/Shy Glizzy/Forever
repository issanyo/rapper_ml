[Intro: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
Yung Lan on the track
Yeah, woah
Yeah, woah
Yeah, woah
Yeah, o-o-o
I know

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
You don't gotta say how you feelin'
I've been losin' all my rights and I come straight out the trenches
Fuck all these niggas, that's the business
Just don't leave out the picture
And I can't seem to get it right
I put that shit in my wishes
Forever tryna tell 'em gang, that's forever
This feel like that I'm tryna learn forever
And I never wanna get burned, no not ever
Niggas don't wanna wait they turn but it's whatever, whatever

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
Shawty looked me in my face
And say we gon' be together
I told that bitch "stay in her place  'cause forever is never"
I put some diamonds 'round your neck, just to make you feel special
I'm trying to run me up a check and plus I run with some steppers
Gotta keep my head on a swivel
Gotta play chess and not checkers
Ever since I were little
People change like the weather
But I'm in this for the better
I got your back through whatever
And I just hit up Elliante
'Bout to flood my new bezel
Steady spendin', charges pendin', fighting all of these felonies
Gotta stay down to get the millions what my niggas keep tellin' me
I swear shit ain't been the same lately
If I fuck up and go to prison will I come up to the same lady?

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
You don't gotta say how you feelin'
I've been loosin' all my rights and I come straight out the trenches
Fuck all these niggas, that's the business
Just don't leave out the picture
And I can't seem to get it right
I put that shit in my wishes
Forever tryna tell 'em gang, that's forever
This feel like that I'm tryna learn forever
And I never wanna get burned, no not ever
Niggas don't wanna wait they turn but it's whatever, whatever

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Not half way to pictures
Just cause I'm a rapper that don't mean I ain't a menace
Suppose to be a trapper, never seen you in the trenches
And yeah I'm goin' flawless like Johnny Dang the dentist
The middle of the [?] when you went and got your tennis
I'm from 37 where nobody don't fight
And bitch I got striped, we come and whack yo ass tonight
Got some niggas in the feds
That'll send your ass to kite
You get hit with that knife
Promise it'll change your life
And I'm screamin' Trey Seven that's forever
Glizzy gang or no gang, you know better
NBA, Quando Rondo that's forever
My little brothers play with then there will be some pressure

[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]
You don't gotta say how you feelin'
I've been losin' all my rights and I come straight out the trenches
Fuck all these niggas, that's the business
Just don't leave out the picture
And I can't seem to get it right
I put that shit in my wishes
Forever tryna tell 'em gang, that's forever
This feel like that I'm tryna learn forever
And I never wanna get burned, no not ever
Niggas don't wanna wait they turn but it's whatever, whatever
