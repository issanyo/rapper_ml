I feel fucking awful
I feel fucking awful, awww

[Hook]
I got money problems
I got money problems
I got money problems
I got money problems
One of these niggas gonna make me rob 'em
I can't do what I want
And I feel fucking awful
I got money problems
I got money problems
I got money problems
I got money problems
I got money problems
I got money problems
One of these niggas gonna make me rob 'em

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Damn, I'm going through it
Me and my right hand man just got into
Cause he up, and I ain't got no cash
And that boy done spent his last on a piece of ass
Rap game ain't doing shit
And everybody broke, So I can't hit a lick
OG fronting me a half a brick
I fucked my whole sack up at Saks 5th
I got a bad bitch, I swear bitch cost
I break her little heart
Every time I fall off
But, she don't never go no where
Cause she know daddy ball
And when daddy get right back
Then, she gonna have it all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Moms just called, She said "Son the rents due"
Before she lose her house
I'll lose my fucking mental
Nigga, I don't care who you subgent too
Give me all the money man
I'm trynna be gentle
Lil bruh in high school
He like to get high too
Glad his feet grew
Now he can't start wearing my shoes
Mad as shit, I can't get around how I want too
Caught the train before I became this big rap dude
And for my birthday I wanna Rolex
I hope and pray I catch you slippin' with a Rolex
You can't tell I'm fucked up from my videos
That's because I always luck up for my videos

[Hook]
