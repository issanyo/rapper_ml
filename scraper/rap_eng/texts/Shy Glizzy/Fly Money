[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I like to get fly
I love to get money
I don't know you guys
But I'm sure I know your hundreds
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
I like to get fly
I love to get money
I don't know you guys
But I'm sure I know your hundreds
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Yo yo
I be in go-go, outfit come from Soho
Choppin' up white O's, they goin' out to who knows
Me and Jose Guapo, call this shit fly arrow
Killin' like a villain but stay fly like a hero
Different label every day, you gotta ask what my shit say
Kingpins motivate, I'm talkin' Alpo and Ray
But they hot though, I'm a real nigga, they not though
Any my niggas go hide more, I'ma have to let the MAC go
I'm sorry, but that's law
All my real niggas say aww
I promise to stay raw
I ain't talkin' G-Star
I be rockin' deezy denim
And you know I got cheese in 'em
I keep screamin' free my dogs
Let 'em out the fuckin' kennel
It's simple, I'm at these niggas' face like a pimple
I'm eating, nigga do you need a menu?
I really like her buttocks, so I bought her some Ciroq
Then she swallowed my JR, don't forget to kiss the G-Shock

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I like to get fly
I love to get money
I don't know you guys
But I'm sure I know your hundreds
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
I like to get fly
I love to get money
I don't know you guys
But I'm sure I know your hundreds
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
I get fly, I'm gettin' money
Put that together, that's fly money
These shoes cost twelve hundred
Fuck that, I keep racks on me
You don't know me, I don't know you
I'm kicking pimping like I'm 'posed to
These niggas they old news
We taking trips, coppin' new jewels
Bali sneaks, I'm so unique
Bad bitch, she so petite
It's my job make sure we eat
We at the table, finna have a feast
Real niggas done got together
We undefeated like Mayweather
And we fly in any weather
I take your bitch and play with her, uh
Versace sweatsuit just because it's winter
All these bitches open, can't wait 'til I enter
Shout out to my big homies
Real niggas with that long bread
She sucked me up for two hours
I call that that long head
Shout out to them young niggas
Can't forget them street niggas
Two hundred strong
Bitch they know we deep nigga
I'm high as fuck, fly as fuck
On autopilot, turnt up
And if it ain't 'bout money, don't concern us

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I like to get fly
I love to get money
I don't know you guys
But I'm sure I know your hundreds
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
I like to get fly
I love to get money
I don't know you guys
But I'm sure I know your hundreds
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
Fly fly fly fly money
This that fly fly fly fly money
