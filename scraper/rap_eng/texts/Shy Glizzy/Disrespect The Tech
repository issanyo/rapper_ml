[Intro]
Dirty Sprite
Fire!
I'm going in

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Niggas say got money
I get hundreds by the hour
Everybody name say Glizzy
Don't you see my power
Bitch, I move them chickens
My bitch roast for the flower
I'm the streets hottest youngin'
You a mother fucking coward
Ricky Rozay (uh), I'm like no way
Bitch I think I'm Jeezy
My mix tape on the way
Glizzy so sick
Somebody give me Dr. Dre
This a Lex Luther beat
But Ima rock it anyway
I'm all about my business
But this right here is personal
Everybody mind their business
Or I might end up hurting you
Money on money
I'm balling, Turkoglu
All my niggas geeking
I hope they don't Urkel you
Cause they might Boosie me
Them faggot ass police
All my bitches bossy and I ain't talking about Kelis
Roofplis expensive, that's barely all I eat
Knock you out the door
And end up your mother fucking lease
You ugly
You fat and you can't dress
You do this cause you have to
I do this cause I'm blessed
See, bitches actually taste me
They just taste your rap, Check
I just copped a new AK
And ain't even bust my Mac yet
NorthFace vest, where they do that at
You got whole things, what
Where they move that at
I be with big dogs
We all cool cats
Fat Trel gotta tech
Where the fuck he shoot that at
Never seen you in a gogo
Never seen you in the streets
And I don't ever think you went to school in DC
No change on your brain
My killers shoot for free
But don't worry
Cause they all in 19th O and D street
You keep talking about fool
Me and my niggas say moe
E Pills kinda played out
Me and my niggas smoke Dro
You say you from E street
I'm the mayor of tha Yo
Super man of my hood
Neighborhood hero
Codeine in the sprite
Mix it up nice
Couple hundred on my feet
Couple grand on my ice
Glizzy be the name
I come from where we don't fight
Bob Barker in the street
They say my price is always right
Bad Ass just like billy
I got a Beard like I'm from Philly
They say I look like Meek Milli
I say guns like just like dilly
My Weezy color purple
And my Glizzy black and silly
The game ain't even gotta feel me
But you still gonna hear me
Streets hottest youngin'
This Halloween
I'm taking over this shit man
