Handcuffsx2

[Hook]
These Niggas can't stand us so they want us in handcuffs
When you get that power you feel like Tony Montana
Any Beamer star like a tennis
They want me in handcuffs they want me in handcuffs take me out these handcuffs

I Like to eat salmon take me out these handcuffs
Handcuffs
Just dropped off in the Phantom
Got 30 of my handgun
Cousin a Santana
Call work from Alabama
My niggas smoking tanka [?]
Let my Niggas out them handcuffs
Streets get dry like Canada
Just got me on Cameron
I Can't be in handcuffs I'm just saying though
Handcuffs
I'm with my man bro
You trying to get me jammed up
You want to see me in handcuffs
Boy that's fucked up

[Hook]
These Negas can't stand us so they want us in handcuffs
When you get that power you feel like Tony Montana
Any Beamer star like a tennis
They want me in handcuffs they want me in handcuffs take me out these handcuffs

I don't want to be famous
