[Chorus:]
I've been going through some shit
Don't ask me why I be with the niggas that I be with
Or why I ain't posting pictures
That's cause I'm still in the trenches
Don't ask me why a nigga didn't blow up or why I didn't show up
Fuck all that bullshit I'ma po' up
Going through some shit, I've been going thru some shit
Lately I've been going through some shit
I'm going through some shit

[Verse 1:]
I think I need to get away my bitch she need a tan
And I just missed another plate, that mean I lost some M's
I know people have said , I'm sorry if I lost some fans
But y'all plan that shit with Ben, so go and take that up with him
But then I told myself man I really need some help
Gotta get that wealth, I can't end up on a shelf
Street hottest youngin', make them bad bitches melt
Style knock em out, swag champ with my belt
I've been going thru it, I've been going stupid
The pack ain't too good, fuck it am gonna still move it
Say they don't like my music but they still gonna groove it
Got a gun and don't use it, nigga fuck is you stupid

[Chorus:]
Don't ask me why I be with the niggas that I be with
Or why I ain't posting pictures
That's cause I'm still in the trenches
Don't ask me why a nigga didn't blow up or why I didn't show up
Fuck all that bullshit I'ma po' up
Going through some shit, I've been going thru some shit
Lately I've been going through some shit
I'm going through some shit

[Verse 2:]
I've been going through some shit, still pissin' in a cup
Several people on my place, sometimes I want to get the fuck
These expressions on mah face from trying to beat this  hard time
On parole still be with mah nigga charge with hard crime
Feel like they cursing me niggas promise they gonna murder me
So i keep black ricky his extension is dirty piece
Baby mamma drama don't wanna argue i want peace
Gee mah daughter a teenager hope she don't fall for niggas like me
Look don't even talk to me am in mah zone
You gonna talk behind mah back when i leave so leave me alone
Mind yo bidness make yo move get out mah way keep it pushin
Real niggas go thru it cuz niggas pussies

[Chorus]
