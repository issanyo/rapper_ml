[Verse 1]
Eleven years old, I was stealing clothes
Momma selling weed, uncle selling coke
275, thats grandma's house
I done fucked so many bitches right on grandma's couch
I remember bumpin' dollars from my OG's
Now my OG's looking up to me, Oh
I used to hit the dipper
One day I started tripping
I lied to my mother
Boy I'm glad she ain't listen
She put me in the shower
Ran it up for an hour
Gave me some milk, thank god it wasn't sour
She said you gonna be just like your father
A motherfucking dog and a robber
Well I got his face and I got his ways
No memories but his picture and his AK
37 made me who I am today
You niggas wanna be street, this shit sad to say

[Hook]
Sad to say, sad to say
This shit so sad to say
Sad to say, sad to say
This shit so sad to say x2

[Verse 2]
I shot myself rapping in the studio
I got stabbed up at one of my shows
See the first part, don't nobody know
And the second part I was about to go
No I haven't been there and ain't do shit
Layin' in the hospital, thinking about a new clique
Thinking about killing them niggas
I'm so ruthless
I'm talking 'bout my niggas, almost died nigga
Do you know why nigga, you wanna get drunk and high nigga
Thought you was gonna ride nigga
Click-clack and bye nigga
Sorry I don't give a fuck
And you can love but don't trust
I'm from where niggas will wet you up
Then go and hug your mom dressed in a Tux
37 made me who I am today
You niggas wanna be street, this shit sad to say

[Hook]
