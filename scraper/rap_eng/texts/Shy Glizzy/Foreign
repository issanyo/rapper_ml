[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I drive foreign cars, I like foreign broads
I got a foreign plug, buy a lot of foreign stuff
I got foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign dreams
I like foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign things
I drive foreign cars, I like foreign broads
I got a foreign plug, buy a lot of foreign stuff
I got foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign dreams
I like foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign things

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I'm in the airport looking like an Afghan
I'm trappin' in some kicks I got from Japan
Got a bad bitch, she come straight from Thailand
She say ooh daddy, you so good at rapping
Plug from Mexico, met him at the Texaco
Scooter got the dope, shout out to Lil Mexico
I got anything you want, just let me know
And if you flexin' nigga, shoot yourself like Plaxico
Where's my honey, worried 'bout my money
Fuck that stupid bitch, I need a Dubai honey
Plus that fly money, you got get fly money
And I can't speak Italian but I got it on me

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I drive foreign cars, I like foreign broads
I got a foreign plug, buy a lot of foreign stuff
I got foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign dreams
I like foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign things
I drive foreign cars, I like foreign broads
I got a foreign plug, buy a lot of foreign stuff
I got foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign dreams
I like foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign things

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
I get my weed from Jamaica, state come from Houston
Broad from overseas but she just flew to Houston
And I got foreign broads bought green cards
We go hard, my whole squad
My Jesus piece say oh lord, good on my face card, uh
You ain't met a nigga like me
I know real OGs, they plugged up out here in these streets
And these niggas ducks, they'll get embarrassed
Fuckin' round with Guap, I'm tryna find my way to Paris
Balenciaga's, I'm talking Margiella's
Foreign kicks, I got several
And I woke up to a flight confirmation number
I hit my booking agent, told him send that paper over

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I drive foreign cars, I like foreign broads
I got a foreign plug, buy a lot of foreign stuff
I got foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign dreams
I like foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign things
I drive foreign cars, I like foreign broads
I got a foreign plug, buy a lot of foreign stuff
I got foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign dreams
I like foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign things
