[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Dope boy magic, ooh
You can smell it through the plastic
Dope boy magic, ooh shit tragic
Somebody died out the habit
Dope boy magic
Flip it like it’s gymnastics
Trampoline money, never backflip
Somersault, somersault, yeah
I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
Grade-A money never backflip

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Young Jefe holmes
Girl what your name is
Tell me who you came with
Ain’t nothin’ like none of these industry cats, street nigga, I’m dangerous
She like ain’t you famous? (nope)
Bitch, I’m still on that same shit (yup)
I bet you won’t never go fuckin’ no lame
Put you on this game shit
This life gets scary honey
I’m gettin’ that dirty money
Heard they took 30 from me
Then I gotta go murder someone
We got the block back jumpin’
You hear the birds, they hummin’
No I can’t serve no under
Yeah bitch I know they on me
Stuck in that trap, this is a dream
I still move them packs, fuck do you mean?
Married the streets and I got me a ring
Shout out them choppers and shout out them fiends
Teach you the game, bitch you play with them beams
Come to my city, we baking your beans
Pounds in Virginia, get bricks in [?]
I get ‘em off like I’m a machine

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Dope boy magic, ooh
You can smell it through the plastic
Dope boy magic, ooh shit tragic
Somebody died out the habit
Dope boy magic
Flip it like it’s gymnastics
Trampoline money, never backflip
Somersault, somersault, yeah
I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
Grade-A money never backflip

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
This is dope boy status
Nigga Rolls Royce lavish
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, nigga no look passing
I’m a hit-making addict
I don’t want to go savage
I’m a star, I’m a star, let the bros go blast him
Got they draws on the floor when the boy walk past ‘em
They throw bras at a nigga ah, they want my shows for the passion
I’m a Bronx reppin’ nigga ah, they already know what I’m jackin’
Give a fuck what a nigga thought, you can smell the dope through the jacket
If I told you I was in love I was probably overreacting
If love wasn’t like a drug it would be so unattractive
If I fucked you but only once you would think I’m missing in action
Have you reaching and grabbing
For that dope boy magic

[Chorus: Trey Songz & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Dope boy magic, ooh
You can smell it through the plastic
Dope boy magic, ooh shit tragic
Somebody died out the habit
Dope boy magic
Flip it like it’s gymnastics
Trampoline money, never backflip
Somersault, somersault, yeah
I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
I’ma ball, I’ma ball, I’ma ball
Grade-A money never backflip
