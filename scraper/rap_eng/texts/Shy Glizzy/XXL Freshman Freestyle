[Verse]
Okay, it’s my go
Glizzy Glizzy, hi ho
This shit bout to go viral
Screaming, "Fuck my rivals"
I’m a fucking idol
Shoot y’all ass like Malvo
Streets' hottest, this youngin, bitch
I’m hotter than Alpo
Moving so much weight, oh my God, I’m doing typo
My bitch look like Kourtney K, she don’t got no lipo
Two hundred in a stingray, I just switched to Geico
Hello? It’s a nigga right now tryna give me two bricks for a show
My bitch so bad, she walk on rose petals
And I’m like Michael Jackson to the ghetto, B. Glizzy, bitch!
