[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Shy Glizzy]
I got access to your bitch
I got access to that check
I got tats all on my neck
I got stripes, I got respect
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access to the plug
I got access to the trap
And I might remix your drugs
Might finesse you out your strap
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
Uh, bitch say that she don't know how to deal with Guap
I just tell her keep it real with Guap
Condo at the top, she wanna live with Guap
She know I'm cool, she say she wanna chill with Guap
I got access to them pounds
They in town, just know they 'round
I got access to them shooters
They'll let go a hundred rounds
It's Young Guap, I call shots
I got access in the hood
I got access in Pittsburgh and I got access on [?]
I got access in DC, 37 for me
I'm with Glizzy in the streets, all day we smokin' weed
I got access to your bitch, she gon' hit me with a text
I got access to the bank, I got access to that check

[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Shy Glizzy]
I got access to your bitch
I got access to that check
I got tats all on my neck
I got stripes, I got respect
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access to the plug
I got access to the trap
And I might remix your drugs
Might finesse you out your strap
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Let me call my amigo, got the other kilos
Money makin' Mitch so I stay away from Ricos
Give me that punk, bitch I'm Debo
Fifteen jets in my pistol, Tebow
Glizzy go macho, A1 Rocko
Fuck the plug daughter and she taste like nachos
H on my waist let you know I got hollows
Know Pittsburgh stealers, one of 'em named Guapo
Streets' hottest youngin, hotter than an Under Armour
Big guns like I got access to Osama
A lot of chickens, I got access to the farmer
Panamera, You got access to a Honda

[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Shy Glizzy]
I got access to your bitch
I got access to that check
I got tats all on my neck
I got stripes, I got respect
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access to the plug
I got access to the trap
And I might remix your drugs
Might finesse you out your strap
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
I got access, I got pull
