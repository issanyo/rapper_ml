[Hook]
If you a fuck nigga, keep my name out yo mouth
If you a tough nigga, I’ll come aim at ya house
I got a lotta bands and I got a lotta clout
If it ain’t bout them bands, nigga, what ya talkin’ bout?
Young nigga, whachya talkin’ bout? I don’t care whachya talkin’ bout
Mama said why all this cash up in ‘er house?
Sorry, momma, I don’t know whachya talkin’ bout

[Verse 1]
Glizzy got the pounds, smoke out the ounce
Bitch I’m talkin’ bout almost a ticket fo’ the house
Bet ya neva had 200 000 in yo couch
Ouch, shit make a pussy nigga pout
Police kick the door, don’t know what they talkin’ bout
I won’t run my mouth, snitches get put in the ground
You can ask around, I’m the hottest guy in town
I neva seen them out, don’t know what they talkin’ bout
They ain’t keep it 100 when they see me comin’ up
Streets hottest youngin, no, bitch, I’m just warming up
GG is my chain, bet you will neva see it tucked
You run up, you get bust, show you I don't give no fucks

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My young niggas be geeking
They be wylin’ fo’ no reason
Got goodmen, gotta keep em
Niggas switch up like the season
I’m not havin no meeting
Put that nigga in the cement
Bitch nigga we not beefing
Or your family won’t be eating
If you come to my house
You see that chopper on the couch
Smoking on that OG, shit turned me to Mr. Chow
He can’t afford an ounce
So he smoke on Black and Milds
This shit I got too loud
Can’t hear shit he talkin’ bout
Realest young nigga comin’ straight up out the slums
Glizzy Glizzy bitch da king of district of Columb
Ask any of my strippers, bet they never seen no ones
Lil nigga, you my son, fucked yo sister and yo moms
