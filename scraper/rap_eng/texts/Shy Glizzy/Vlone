[Intro]
Young Jefe, holmes
GG, Trauma Tone
For life, ayy
30 30, you know it
Gang shit, no lame shit

[Chorus]
I'm in my zone, in my zone, in my zone, in my zone
Rock Vlone, rock Vlone, I rock Vlone, I rock Vlone
Since I was a youngin' always had a bankroll
And I change hoes like a nigga change clothes

[Verse 1]
She said I'm acting funny, bitch it ain't the fame, don't it?
If it ain't one hundred I can't put my name on it
You better use his brain before I put some change on it
Girl once I touch that pussy you can't let a lame on it
She heard them bands callin', she said I'll be right there
And when she left her man, he found out life is not fair
You know DF keep that chopper so you better not dare
We gon' come and blast your box, so better get your ass prepared
Lil suburban bitch, I turned her spot into a stashhouse
Pussy waterfall, she got that shit that make you spazz out
Plottin' on the lil bitch, you ain't hear a nigga cashed out
Bitch it's big Glizzy, no you don't want me to bring them gats out

[Chorus]
I'm in my zone, in my zone, in my zone, in my zone
Rock Vlone, rock Vlone, I rock Vlone, I rock Vlone
Since I was a youngin' always had a bankroll
And I change hoes like a nigga change clothes

[Verse 2]
Bet you couldn't guess how far my fuckin' pain goes
Bet you couldn't guess how far my fuckin' pain go
Lil bitch from Miami but she very used to snow
Nominated for a Grammy but my nigga movin' dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga get you a ho
Young nigga got that glizzy on him and that bitch got that scope
Patek on my time man, fuck is you blind man?
Your watch don't bling like mine, man
Better go see shine, man
These rappers they be lying man, welcome to my land
My son he like amen, I keep that iron man
Not my homie, I don't know you
Cameras rollin', I can't show you
Got my own shit, I don't owe you
That's your bitch then that's my ho too
Young nigga, young, young dripper
He come through drippin', come through, come through drippin'
Extendo clip, extendo, 'stendo clip
He gon' go get it, young nigga 'bout his business

[Chorus]
I'm in my zone, in my zone, in my zone, in my zone
Rock Vlone, rock Vlone, I rock Vlone, I rock Vlone
Since I was a youngin' always had a bankroll
And I change hoes like a nigga change clothes

[Outro]
And I change hoes like a nigga change clothes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Rock Vlone, rock Vlone, I rock Vlone, I rock Vlone
