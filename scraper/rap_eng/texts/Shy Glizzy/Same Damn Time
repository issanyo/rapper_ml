(Shy Glizzy:)

I pop mollies, I drink lean at the same damn time
Ain't no telling what I'mma bring, I ain't got no damn mind
Free my nigga NOLO, they try ta give em that time
Bought my bitch some red bottoms, but she couldn’t fit a 9
10 bitch niggas diss me at the same damn time
I want a front row at my show so kiss my fucking be-hind
Im the streets hottest youngin, Oh My Fucking God im frying
I talk this life because I live, niggas say shit cause it rhyme
My flow is so ugly, these fake rappers can’t fuck wit me
Im playin the piano, these fake trappers ain't touching me
Turk be home next month, I can't wait ta stunt
My nigga got 3 kids, and all 3 of em 1
S/o my nigga Quette, s/o my nigga Plies
Coulda said some other names but they might be in disguise
Up in Café Asia, standing onna couches
Blowing ah couples ounces, taking broke niggas spouses
Popping Rose, wit them niggas up in Rose
I be wit baby everyday, yea that’s my fucking brozayy
Im riding wit Wale, I gotta max payne nine
We walked in stadium they said its make it rain time
Met a bitch named Katrina, she do cocaine lines
She told me she from New Orleans, its going hurricane now
Look at my twitter I just hit the 10,000 club
Im 19 wit 20stacks, that’s a thousand dubs
Im super duper clean, like I just got out the tub
I still smell like weed, like I had kush in my dove
Bitch im in the game, just like EA
Them niggas smoking bush, call em Macy Gray
I get so much cake, I don’t know when my birthday
I do know im the shit and nigga law is on the way, yeah law is on the way
