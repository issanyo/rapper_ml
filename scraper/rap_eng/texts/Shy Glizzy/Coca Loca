[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
The aroma, smells good

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Coca, coca, coca loca
I got coca cola, not the soda
Coca, coca, coca loca
Standing in the kitchen not the sofa
Coca, coca, coca loca
I got coca cola, not the soda
Coca, coca, coca loca
Standing in the kitchen not the sofa

[ Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I got dirty birds, hay, shoot like Larry Bird, hay
I got dirty birds, hay, shoot like Larry Bird, hay
Bitch get on my nerves, ho you need to swerve!
Twelve years old when I start selling herb
Momma used to tell me, get your ass back on the curb!
Grams at the door, put it up your nose
Take you to a place, I don't think you wanna go, no, no
Niggas, I look up to in a hole or in the hole
OG you're fucked up now, you're just like TO
I got coca loca, bricks inside a Rover
Police get behind me, I swear I'm not pulling over
I'm that Batman, you're Joker, I bet my heart colder
Young Richie pour it up, don't let 'em Alpo ya

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Coca, coca, coca loca
I got coca cola, not the soda
Coca, coca, coca loca
Standing in the kitchen not the sofa
Coca, coca, coca loca
I got coca cola, not the soda
Coca, coca, coca loca
Standing in the kitchen not the sofa

[Verse 2: Zed Zilla]
In the kitchen whipping
Hopper than the Fisker like *skrrt*
Ain't let a nigga pass
See you when you see me
Catch me when you catch me
Hater, you can bet me, that I'm blowing on gas
Cut my nigga young Berg, tell him that I got a quarter bird
Make his ass come back cook glad
Coca, coca loca, loca
In a plastic bag
The niggas ain't getting like my cocaine clique
These pussy ass niggas on the downfall
Heard you got robbed for half a brick
And I heard your motherfucking pistol didn't sound off
Got one young nigga getting no pounds on
One young nigga cooking the white girl
I heard you want the white vert
Me, I just one night her
My nigga he bad, he cooking, he couldn't
My head is turned up so firm
My nigga for life got jammed with the white
And man, his face is on the news
Now I guess both of our faces is on a poster
Mine for rapping, yours for fucking with coca loca

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Coca, coca, coca loca
I got coca cola, not the soda
Coca, coca, coca loca
Standing in the kitchen not the sofa
Coca, coca, coca loca
I got coca cola, not the soda
Coca, coca, coca loca
Standing in the kitchen not the sofa
