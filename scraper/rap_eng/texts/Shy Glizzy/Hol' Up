[Intro]
Did you put that shit on it?
Can you turn the beat up too?
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
This the soundtrack to my life
Yea this the soundtrack to my life take a trip
You ain’t got to hold me down I hold my own in this bitch
Shit kept my word stayed true you know how this can get when it’s real
One thing just don’t count me out yo just don’t count me out

[Hook]
Yea said this the soundtrack to my soul take a trip
You ain’t got to hold me down
I hold my own in this bitch
Kept my word stayed true
You know how this can get when it’s real
One thing just don’t count me out
Yea just don’t count me out
Hol’ up say hol’ up, Hol’ up say hol’ up, Hol’ up say hol’ up

[Verse 1]
Look I did this shit for the hoes, I did this shit for the youth
I did this shit for the gang gang, I did this shit for the wave
All of you new niggas sound the same you cannot say this don’t sound the same
When they hear this they gon feel a way unless I add a xan or lean and 100K
Money, money, money piling 20’s, 50’s, 100’s got em heard it all
I just might buy me an island
Horsing around in Ferraris let set it off
You and your bros flying privates
All of your hoes on my private they finna ball
Ima finesse it through college long as she keep them toes polished
Problem solved like ohhhh
Out with the old and in with the new
Yea it’s a goal messie with the goals
Man this shit ain’t you
It ain’t the same nothing was the same I’m Drake with the views
It’s outta control you can’t control while keepin it true

[Hook]
Yea said this the soundtrack to my soul take a trip
You ain’t got to hold me down
I hold my own in this bitch
Kept my word stayed true
You know how this can get when it’s real
One thing just don’t count me out
Yea just don’t count me out
Hol’ up say hol’ up, Hol’ up say hol’ up, Hol’ up say hol’ up

[Shy Glizzy Verse]
I’m rappin and trappin, I’m trappin I’m robbin
While you niggas acting I’m about that action
Boy you ain’t about nothing, my nigga what’s happening
Know that they napping, let’s flip up the mattress
We gon wake em and slap em
All of this gold, can’t wait to go platinum and see they reaction
New Gucci on me these niggas look bummy
Boy go spend some hundreds go buy your bitch something
Go buy that bitch something before she run up under me
She gon come andalay she gon come andalay she know I’m the money man
We come from nothing we don’t ask for anything
We got more juice than Minute Made
We laid up in the shade we counting this cash my bitch she so bad
Trips to Barbados we sit in the sand and we listen to Jazz
Getting this bag I kick it with Chaz, bitch look at my swag
I’m in my G-Wag, my moms got a beamer and my bitch got a Jag

[Hook]
Yea said this the soundtrack to my soul take a trip
You ain’t got to hold me down
I hold my own in this bitch
Kept my word stayed true
You know how this can get when it’s real
One thing just don’t count me out
Yea just don’t count me out
Hol’ up say hol’ up, Hol’ up say hol’ up, Hol’ up say hol’ up
