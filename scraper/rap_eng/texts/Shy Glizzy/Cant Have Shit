[Verse 1: Bizzy Crook]
Ok Im with the niggas I started with
Remember stealing my mommas whip
These my dogs and thats for life
And if we fall out it ain't bout a b**ch
I got 99 i ain't even worried
My momma begging me to leave the jewelry
Said you was humble when you ain't have shit
Now you think you slick
Got damn niggas can't have shit

(Hook)
Niggas can't have shit
Niggas ain't ever had shit
Ima blow it all just to stunt on ya'll bitch ass niggas
To remember when we ain't have shit!
Niggas can't have shit
Niggas can't ever have shit
Fuck dat fuck dat
You ain't help me get that fuck dat you pussy niggas can't have shit

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy)
Foreign whip pulling up in that shit
Got a foreign bitch all she wanted was the bricks
Can't ever have shit
Can't ever have shit
I ain't ever had shit
30k on my wrist
I be toting my rounds
It been going down
Fuck a lot of bitches
Smoke a lot of pounds
I don't touch her I'm like Nino Brown
I run my town they keep trying to put me down
I be fucking balling on your fucking head
Bitches suck my dick now you are fucking fake
Tell you i ain't ever shit ain't nobody give me no biz
Running up my check ain't going back to rice and fritz

(Hook)
Niggas can't have shit
Niggas ain't ever had shit
Ima blow it all just to stunt on ya'll bitch ass niggas
To remember when we ain't have shit!
Niggas can't have shit
Niggas can't ever have shit
Fuck dat fuck dat
You ain't help me get that fuck dat you pussy niggas can't have shit

[Verse 3: Bizzy Crook]
Still driving through on my old block
Moving like I got 10 keys nigga I ain't making no stops
Cause I got all my dogs in the car with
Being real always been up top with me
305 and thats where Im from
Someone please get Reverend Run
Cause boy Im 'bout to bless this bitch
First she gotta bless this dick
And a nigga way too young to be worried bout ones
When I get too many of them to be stressed and shit
Man fuck what I said about being humble
When them hoes ain't never love you
She ain't let me get piece till I pulled up with the roof piece missing
Had that ho looking puzzled
Im a spend my whole check on a car just to stunt on your ass one time
Remember like you did me one time?
Now I wouldn't hit it one time
Use to kick raps at the punchline
Now we at Phillpes talking rap yo Lani what up fun times
My ex girl said I was humble when I ain't have shit
Now you think you slick, Got damn niggas can't have shit

(Hook)
