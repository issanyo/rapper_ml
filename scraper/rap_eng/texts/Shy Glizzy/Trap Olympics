Don't make me count these rolls on them

[Hook]
I just took some xans and some lean
Brought some weed, that's not for me I do not smoke
That's for Adi, that's for Adi, that's for Adi YG Adi
That's for adi YG Adi
I just took some xans and some lean I took some lean
Brought some weed, that's not for me
That's for Adi, that's for Adi, that's for Adi YG Adi
That's for adi YG Adi

[Verse 1]
I just took a xan with a brand new whore
Christian hat, christian hat that's not Dior
White hair bitch, all on my dick
Whip it whip, whip my wrist
I ain't going to lock, I'm higher than a bitch, skrt
I've been counting money since '96
When I was born in '94 that mean I was two
I made my first tape that was DJ Clue
Now I'm in the kitchen whippin' up that white no glue
I got bitches on me oh I thought you knew
Lil Uzi, Lil Uzi, I'm the fucking man
Diamonds all up in my chain you see count its like Toucan Sam
Damn, Xan, xan, xan, xan, xan, xan, xan, xan
Lean, lean, lean, xan, xan
I heard they bring that Actavis back too
Lean, lean, xan, xan

[Hook]
I just took some xans and some lean
Brought some weed, that's not for me I do not smoke
That's for Adi, that's for Adi, that's for Adi YG Adi
That's for adi YG Adi
I just took some xans and some lean I took some lean
Brought some weed, that's ain't for me
That's for Adi, that's for Adi, that's for Adi YG Adi
That's for adi YG Adi
