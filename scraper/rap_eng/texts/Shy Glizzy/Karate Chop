[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull in a new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dopefiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]

Back on that lean, I'mma liquid dopefiend
Ball so hard in soho, you can call me styleming
Biggest thing in DC since Mambo Sauce and wings
When I sign I want a ferrari and Sofi Green
Im on pluto, right pocket on Sumo
Boyfriend #2 but she fuck me like im uno
What young nigga you know, with Timbo in the studio
What young nigga you know, no deal but got a hublot
See me and my niggas ain't playful, you play we going erase you
My house got stolen flat screens but we ain't got no cable
I kiss all on her naval, ooh your ho so tasteful
And DC still got dopeboys, this shit ain't end with Rayful ...Karate
