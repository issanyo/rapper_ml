[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
For one of these glizzies I'll block the blocka
No limit to this shit like silkk the shocker
Run up on a nigga hit his ass with the chopper
If you still living better thank yo doctor
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Glizzy glizzy baby I'm so fucking wavy
Pistol of safety, a nigga beta' not play wit' me
I got lots of cash, got a bitch like Stacey Dash
You better not make me mad or imma spin yo block like Taz
You see my watch is glistening
Ice colder than Michigan
These is VVS's them diamonds make a difference
I'm killing this music shit but I still work the razor
Them boys still ain't kill me yet cause they can't work they laser
Got a fresh XD, that bitch so sexy
Come through hitting power plays call me Glizzy Gretzky
Selling white of the late night like Chelsea
If a nigga looking for me he know where to catch me

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
For one of these glizzies I'll block the blocka
No limit to this shit like silkk the shocker
Run up on a nigga hit his ass with the chopper
If you still living better thank yo doctor
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon

[Verse 2: Ant Glizzy]
Got a pocket full of money
Niggas might come get me
They better come correct cause the Mac got fifty
Just a boy in the hood
Ain't tryna die like Ricky
Got the devil on my back till them niggas come get me
I never fold
I never snitch
Can't trust too many niggas
Cause Rico killed Mitch
A lot of niggas died
Unloyal ass bitch
All my niggas shooters
My niggas don't miss
We ball like swish
Keep the big 4 fifth
Tell em get well soon
She said her son had a gift
He was in his last days
Shoulda gave that boy a kiss

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
For one of these glizzies I'll block the blocka
No limit to this shit like silkk the shocker
Run up on a nigga hit his ass with the chopper
If you still living better thank yo doctor
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon
Get well soon, Get well soon, get well get well soon
