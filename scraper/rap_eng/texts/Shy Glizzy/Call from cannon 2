I talked to big bro today (What he say?)
He said let's go to Medellin (He say let's go to Medellin)
I got a bad hoe that snort yay (Damn Babe)
She like to go to Medellin (She like to go to Medellin)
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Lost a piece to Pablo
I want bricks like Pablo
Glizzy Im so macho
All about this guapo
We got cocaine, straight from Medellin
Why you gotta trap phone
If it don't ring
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring
Need a whole thing
Tryna kill Glizzy
You gonna need a whole team
Young drug lord
Trapping, don't get bored
Fuck a trap house, got a whole trap store
Plug throwed me bricks off the backboard
Oops, thank you, Lord, now I need some more
I talked to big bro today (What he say?)
He said let's go to Medellin (He say let's go to Medellin)
I got a bad hoe that snort yay (Damn Babe)
She like to go to Medellin (She like to go to Medellin)
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
You talking to the man in-between
But really I'm the nigga you need to see
Private plane back to DC
Three hours cost me 5 ki's
I'm a distributor like the Medellin
All these white bricks around me
Jugged over 5000 ki
I told you, you ain't seen the shit I seen
Every time the streets ugly, I take flight
Drop the prices on the bricks, I wish I might
Bad bitch with me just to test the white
Two shooters, cooking bricks will cost your life
I talked to big bro today (What he say?)
He said let's go to Medellin (He say let's go to Medellin)
I got a bad hoe that snort yay (Damn Babe)
She like to go to Medellin (She like to go to Medellin)
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
Medellin, Medellin
