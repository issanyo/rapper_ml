[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & Jose Guapo]
I got super stupid cash, a super stupid trap
She super stupid fat, she movin' super stupid fast
Got super stupid racks, got super stupid tats
I'm super stupid fly, I stay super stupid high
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
If I don't do shit, I'ma get fly
Bitch look at my lips, you can tell I smoke that fire
Stoned out my eye, make a wish when I cry
I'm fresh to death like I went in a fitting room and died
Another day another dollar, I love a ho that holler
I got a model that only eat rice from Benihanas
And she a wild girl, she like my anaconda
Where she get that ass from, she got it from her mama
Posted in the trap with an all black nickel
All this green in my pocket turn my dick into a pickle
Icy ass grill, call that bitch a popsicle
I just want the head, I'ma let Guap hit you

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & Jose Guapo]
I got super stupid cash, a super stupid trap
She super stupid fat, she movin' super stupid fast
Got super stupid racks, got super stupid tats
I'm super stupid fly, I stay super stupid high
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
I got a young nigga from the turf, he gon' go berserk
My bitch stupid bad, and she put in work
See I be talkin' cash, so I'ma get that there first
Bitch I'm in my bag, better yet I'm in a hearse
I got Jimmy on my shoes, Jimmy on my Trues
Bitch my name is Guap, but who the fuck is you, uh
All I wear is alphabet, my nigga mind your business
I'm a Zone 3 player, damn right I'm kickin' pimping, uh
I'm smoking on a blunt the size of my arm
I swear to god my buzz the size of your charm
Go ring the alarm, my nigga we on
Make your bitch do whatever to hang with the don

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & Jose Guapo]
I got super stupid cash, a super stupid trap
She super stupid fat, she movin' super stupid fast
Got super stupid racks, got super stupid tats
I'm super stupid fly, I stay super stupid high
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid
Super, stupid, super, stupid
