[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
I’m in the R8, that’s the Audi
I got the AR, right beside me
I hopped out, on the stallion
She look like she belong on the islands
I think she like me, I think she like me
I think she like me, I think she like me
I think she like me, I think she like me
I think she like me, I think she like me

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Bitch I pull up in that Audi
So much gold like I’m from Saudi
Trapping them O’s got me drowsy
Hating ass niggas they lousy
Call me Big Glizzy or Mister G
Cuban links on, look like Mister T
Uh, Cazals on these niggas can’t see me
I think I’m Stevie!
I tell the truth and these niggas welling
This shit is bigger than Rayful Edmond
Screaming omertà can't do no telling
I cut your ass like a watermelon
Three hour ride just to see my children
Bands in my [?] to make it look cooler
Picassi Rolex, no not a Muller
Diamonds in this bitch say hugamuga
She can’t keep her eyes off the don
I’m wearing this crown, it’s a don
Bad bitch right here in my arms
Shawty she know she the bomb
I blow shit up like Saddam
I got more bait than LeBron
These are Christian Louboutin
I don't know if you're too fond

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
I’m in the R8, that’s the Audi

I hopped out, on the stallion
She look like she belong on the islands
I think she like me, I think she like me
I think she like me, I think she like me
I think she like me, I think she like me
I think she like me, I think she like me

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Oh I, oh I think they like me
But I don’t got on a white tee
Walk in the mall and they go pandemonium
Bitches, yeah they running after me
Why they got so much excitement
Cause Migos, Shy Glizzy in present tense
I thank the plug, he showed me guidance
We wrap it, pack it, it’s already sealed
I take the pot, I got the finger fuckin'
It’s a million dollars in the dope bucket
I got the trap game, I got the rap game
I am the cashier, hand out the gold tokens
I know they like it cause my diamonds fighting
Got my pinky ring looking like ice hockey
Rebuild the trap like I’m Bob the Builder
Smoke so much gas you might need a filter
Can’t double seal, I don’ trust refillers
Come try my dope, it’s so finger licking
Pull up to the trap with Justin Bieber
Just to pick up the gas pack in the beamer
They calling my wrist the new Stanley Steemer
Young niggas on the block, they cutting off femurs
Bitches want me in a two seater
They was sucking and fucking, you should have seen em

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]

I think she like me, I think she like me
I think she like me, I think she like me

[Verse 2: Offset]
My bitch is a stallion come from the islands
Got birds in the trunk and they sing like the Isleys
You niggas don’t like me, I know they despise me
When I see em pull out the pistol it’s a riot
I didn’t go to high school I went to the trap university
Aventador, chop the top like a surgery
Made a 30 off a coca key
Hollows sting like a bumble bee
I heard that she like it when the diamonds dripping
33 birds in the trunk, Scottie Pippen
Louboutin low top a king cobra
My arm got the hammer, no baking soda
Your bitch got that wet, the Pacific Ocean
Stretch her, bend her over like aerobics
Your bitch on her knees, eat the latex
She a dirty bitch so we have safe sex
I like she ducking, these prices my diamonds
Mike Tyson burn a nigga like it is Niacin
I play with keys and you play with violins
Black on black violence cause you wasn't solid
Got the fire in my pocket, no lighter
Your bitch is coming straight off the dope, she no rider
Pass the lil bitch to my partners like flyers
Like my attire, I didn’t have to buy her
Whipping the brick, put it under the dryer
I got babies, they don’t need pacifiers
You cuffing that bitch that my niggas done hit
She sucking the dick you need to go retire

I think she like me, I think she like me
