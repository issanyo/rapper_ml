[hook edai x2]
Come take a look at me lil bitch now dont I look like a star
I got a hundred from my show I spent that shit on my car
And how we shining like we are why you take it so harsh
You wanna have your niggas like us we done made it so far
Come take a look at me lil bitch now dont I look like a star
I got a hundred from my show I spent that shit on my car
And how we shining like we are why you take it so hard
You wanna have your niggas like us we done made it so far


[Verse 1 Edai]
If you ain't tryna  fuck the squad bitch  please dont look at this car
Got all this money im a star you gotta look at me far
They say I came from the bottom but I took it this far
Thats cause I always did me and never took what they say
Now all Im talking is money but why you take it so hard
See you could just be yourself, so why you faking so hard
They say this shit is the race, Cdai I gotta go hard
They tell me koopa go get em I say I got em no prob
Why these niggas talking like they wanna run up and spray
Niggas say im a wannabe why would I wanna be fake
Heard you been from your block, and you can't go to that place
And If a nigga looking for me Im cooling where it ain't safe

[Verse 2 Shy Glizzy]
Glizzy gang we the mob, we will come get your mom
Chickens come from sawan I dont go to no farm
Bitch you know I stay armed, trey seven on my arm
Choppers make them say huh , make the gat hard as ton
Ima shit on these niggas, cause these niggas some lames
I might copme a bentley I might cop me a range
I dont need no publicity, I dont need no more fame
Thirty bounce on the rocks, 25 on my chain
This kid columbian, I ain't got no tumblr
But I got some fucking gullies that will hit you on your bumper
Pull up in a forgein, remember when I used to ride a hummer
Young niggas we stunting and my swagger made in atlanta
