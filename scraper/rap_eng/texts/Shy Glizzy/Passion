Load up the truck I be trafficking
Diamonds on me and they African
Gold on me like an African
Bitch I'm the king of the jungle
I pop a seal pour a 4 and stumble
She hop on top and ride me with passion
I'm in the kitchen I break down the brick with some passion
Break down the bale with some passion
Just hit a bitch on the kitchen counter
Just put a 50 in a money counter
We made that dirty money take a shower
We made that dirty money take a shower
I fucked around and swiped a lil plastic
I fucked around and served a couple addicts
I hit the moon rocks I'm on another planet

(Money Man)
Load up them keyloads and P's
We used to traffic with ease
We used to buy em and leave
We used to serve em and leave
Now we be growing them trees
A couple losses had to hit my knees
Carbon 15 for enemies
I went and started an enterprise
I never cried a Lil Sosa died
I shot at robber he thought it was sweet
You see Margiela's on a nigga feet
Activism all in my bloodstream
Vvs' in a nigga piece
I had to turn that dirty money clean
She just gone hop on top and ride me with some passion
I had to trap out a house that's abandoned
Just put like 50 in a nigga car
Then I went home and I popped a bar
Hit the moon rocks and I go to Mars
We had to hustle for wishing on a star
Feeling so greatful my check up to par
Came from the streets and it left me with scars
I put that dirty money in the shower
I want that dirty money and the power (Hey)

Break down the bale with some passion
Just hit a bitch on the kitchen counter
Just put a 50 in a money counter
We made that dirty money take a shower
We made that dirty money take a shower
I fucked around and swiped a lil plastic
I fucked around and served a couple addicts

(Shy Glizzy)
I woke up in my loft
Bitch play with my balls
I took a moment thank god
I took my son out to the mall
I'm out of work I supply jobs
Playing get hit with these hot bars
I'm on some islands with foreign brauds
All in they buns like a hot dog

He got funny money Micheal Blackson
Diamonds on me like an African
Tell them niggas come try again
Yeah I'm that nigga who shot at him
Yeah I'm that nigga who gotta win
Fuck niggas say bye to him
