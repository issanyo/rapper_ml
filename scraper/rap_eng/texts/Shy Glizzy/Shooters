Catch a pussy nigga close range, leave his ass laying on the front porch

I'm a boss in these Carolina streets, I seen a lot a rap niggas out faking
You ain't bout that life my nigga, you ain't never dozed off in the trap
Waking up to a fiend in your face, fist balled up, still palming on that crack
My young boy got a Glock that holds 17

Don't let my little nigga pull up on that Chevy thing
He don't give a fuck, when he done, be spraying everything
And thats a motherfucking truth
