[Intro : Go hoppin that porshe] (Young Jefe Holmes)
[Hook: ShyGlizzy]
Hey little boy, Jefe said ,"Go do your chores!"
These niggas some whores
Wipe them out, show no remorse
I might go hop in that Porsche
Go buy my new bitch a horse
Soon as I hopped off the porche
I started flaming that torch
He shoots! He scores!
A soon as I walk in the door
Swoosh
I score
I send my goons to your block
(Bup bup bup bup) and they score
They gonna pass Jefe the rock
Cause they know for sure Im gonna score
He shoot! He Scores!

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
The fuck is you doing?
Jefe be rocking that foreign
These niggas be super boring
They just be rapping, no touring
Straight at they ass like a storm
It could be four in the morning
We give no fucks what you doing
See, GG bitch we just a army
We bust in your shit with the tommy's
Your moms could be making an omelet
Shoot her ass straight out her bonnet
These niggas be talking like bitches
Im just being honest
I can not kick it with snitches
Fuck no, Im not being modest
Shorty be kicking this flavor
Shorty be getting his paper
These niggas can't get them no paper
So they wanna turn into haters
I put the food in your neighbor
I even tipped all the waiters
You mad you can sit at the table
Bye lil' boy I'll see you later

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
The one and the only big glizzy
Nigga the fuck is you silly?
Im two stops away from a mili
They asking me, "Where is the glizzies?"
I don't mix red peppers with chili
You got your shit took by the Glizzies?
Boy this shit don't look like no Glizzy
Forever Tre-7 to heaven
My dogs they tote big Mac 11's
I don't plan on doing no telling
Bet whatever my brother ain't telling
All of my niggas, they reckless
You see all of my niggas got necklaces
Fuck niggas think they gonna test us
Let your stupid ass wait for the stretcher
I can't wait to see some of you rappers
Make me take off my belt while you act up
My niggas come through, beat your back up
Your niggas be calling for back up
Watch out, watch out for that 'Lac truck
GG QB, get your sack up
I only make music for trappers
Now go sing your last song with the pastor

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
