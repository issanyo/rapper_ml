[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track
Trauma Tone
Young Jefe holmes

[Verse 1]
I used to sleep in them trenches
Now I'm in a house on the water
My bitch she a pretty New Yorker
No none of you cannot afford her
'Cause she need a nigga that spoil her
I want her to give me a daughter
Bitch I got some goons in New Orleans
And they shoot them choppers and forties
I used to be in the alley, where all of my niggas caught bodies
And they lost they foot in the sorry street
I needed my niggas beside me
Young Jefe, I'm a boss
No none of these niggas can fire me
And she let me get in her draws
Now she doing too much entirely
Girl how could you ever get tired of me?
Girl look at my face, don't you lie to me
I knew that they wasn't gon' ride for me
They lied when they told me they proud of me
Bitch I really came up from poverty
Know you just in love with my salary
Now I don't smoke shit but that Cali weed
We mobbin' deep, I'm a prodigy

[Chorus]
This shit that I got on, you can't afford this
I just left from Paris, bonjour bitch
I promise you don't want to go to war bitch
I just got a chopper, came with four clips
Gave that girl a home, she was an orphan
Please leave me alone, I'm on some more shit
I was dead broke, I'm tryna make the Forbes list
Every time we get a check then we buy more clips

[Verse 2]
GG, king of DC
Pull in my new whip on a fuck nigga like beep beep
Chopper hold a hundred, guaranteed to get a three piece
Tell me do you want it, make us put that shit on repeat
She can make me shoot my gun, yeah she the only one
Don't want to be a player girl, I feel like Big Pun
She shake her pom poms, tell a nigga uh-uh
She fuckin' with a don, she don't need a son son, yeah
I come from the Yo girl, we say kill moe (moe)
Sold a lot of dope, yeah I fucked a lot of hoes
I rock a lot of gold and I rock a lot of shows
I rap 'bout how I'm trappin' but it feel like rock and roll

[Chorus]
This shit that I got on, you can't afford this
I just left from Paris, bonjour bitch
I promise you don't want to go to war bitch
I just got a chopper, came with four clips
Gave that girl a home, she was an orphan
Please leave me alone, I'm on some more shit
I was dead broke, I'm tryna make the Forbes list
Every time we get a check then we buy more clips
