[Hook]
They gon' think you changed for the money
You just gotta keep your distance from 'em
Niggas ain't the same now they funny
Fuck them niggas we gunnin'
I gotta get me some money
I will never change for the money
I will never change for the money
I will never change for the money
Dont you change, dont you change

[Verse 1 - Shy Glizzy]
I tried to put some fuck niggas in the gang
But niggas get a name and they start to change
Anxious for some fame that's so fuckin' lame
Shoutout to every nigga with a glizzy chain...
Big Glizzy got the block sold out
Tie yo ass up boss, boy you owe up
We don't owe no niggas, niggas owe us
Double G dem guns what we throwin' up
I got some change nigga still ain't changed nigga
I still be in the trenches with the same niggas
The bottom of my shoes got the flames nigga
I got these bitches choosin on they main nigga

[Hook]
They gon' think you changed for the money
You just gotta keep your distance from 'em
Niggas ain't the same now they funny
Fuck them niggas we gunnin'
I gotta get me some money
I will never change for the money
I will never change for the money
I will never change for the money
Dont you change, dont you change

[Skooly - Verse 2]
Niggas change every goddamn day
Imma stay the same every goddamn day
Even if I hang with Chainz every goddamn day
I'm still the same youngin', get yo ass robbed for your chain
Okay, Came form the soil and the grain
Westside nigga and our neighbourhood thing
Woo, Plus I keep a glizzy on my side
Now Im in DC, I got Glizzy on my side
Which one of you gon' try
All you niggas pie
Got to make it home, I can't see my mama cry
Makavelli ready, they can't see me hypnotized
Shootin' out the curtains you can't see me in my ride
Nigga try, think Im lyin'

[Hook]
They gon' think you changed for the money
You just gotta keep your distance from 'em
Niggas ain't the same now they funny
Fuck them niggas we gunnin'
I gotta get me some money
I will never change for the money
I will never change for the money
I will never change for the money
Dont you change, dont you change
