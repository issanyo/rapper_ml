[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Who is this? This Geraldo
What you smokin'? Oh, gelato
I got bitches and they model
Your bitch swallow, she need goggles
Goddamn, look at my pockets
Look like I just hit the lotto
Pull up valet, let 'em park it
Baby I can pay your car note
Yeah, Yeezys, buy her heels
I solve her problems, pay her bills
I'm being real, girl I'm too trill
Now baby tell me how you feel
I got hitters and they kill
Know I still be in the field
Know I be with them gorillas
Tote banana clips for real
Got back up, I took a fall
Lil' nigga, my money tall
I'm that nigga in DC and bitch I ball like John Wall
Look at me, I'm livin' large
Remember them nights, was trappin' hard
Remember them nights I had to rob
Yeah remember them nights I used to starve
Remember that night I serve that tail
Then the feds came into my house
Remember ain't nobody believe in me
'til I showed 'em what I'm 'bout
Remember I used to pour that lean up 'til I fuckin' black out
This for lil' homie in the traphouse with them fuckin' racks out

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
I'm ballin' harder than water, I'm feelin' like Coach Carter
They say the life that I'm livin', I might not see tomorrow
I had to go out and get it 'cause I ain't had no father
I know I gotta stay committed, that's gon' take me farther
Y'all know this lean what I'm sippin', my PO think this vodka
Upgraded from a revolver, hollows fillin' my chopper
I'm tryna face all my problems, I need to see a doctor
I'm tryna face all my problems, I need to see a doctor

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Chicago streets late night, tryna catch
Every time I boot up, I need a good batch
Don't wanna hit, then slide in that cat
There can't be peace 'cause you know it's that
You ain't in the streets and I notice that
You left my side when I was under arrest
You left my side when I was under stress
You turned your back so I know you ain't shit
How you gon' lie and go along with the bitch?
Quando sip red, but I know he a crip
Come to my crib, you can't come with a bitch
Draco shells, it come with a kick
We know you told and that lil' shit stick
You the one know I had a gun in the whip
You the one know I had a gun on my hip
I slept on floors (I slept on floors)
Shootouts where I'm from, when I grew up, and I couldn't ignore it
Some nights I was gettin' too mad at myself 'cause I couldn't record (I couldn't record)
And I couldn't make it to your funeral, why I sent my regards
Hangin' out the roof with my two fingers, fuck the law (Fuck 'em)

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
I'm ballin' harder than water, I'm feelin' like Coach Carter
They say the life that I'm livin', I might not see tomorrow
I had to go out and get it 'cause I ain't had no father
I know I gotta stay committed, that's gon' take me farther
Y'all know this lean what I'm sippin', my PO think this vodka
Upgraded from a revolver, hollows fillin' my chopper
I'm tryna face all my problems, I need to see a doctor
I'm tryna face all my problems, I need to see a doctor
