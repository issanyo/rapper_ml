[Verse 1: Ralo]
I stood on that corner just selling dope in the cold weather
I promise nobody ain’t gotta tell them, they know better
Raised a lot of daughters and lost a lot of my partners
Been playing with them choppers since toddlers, we was in boxers
Please go’n tell ‘em I’m never failing, they jealous
Don’t worry ‘bout my weapon, it’s right up under my belly
I’m the biggest R since that nigga R Kelly
Soon as Ralo hit the stage all them bitches go to yelling
Tell Charlemagne put some respeck on my name
Look who I became, them niggas thought I would change
I’ll blow a nigga’s brains if he think about the chain
I got way too much to gain, niggas ain’t taking a thing
They talkin’ ‘bout taking, I hope that they can take some bullets
I’m the lil nigga that always stood up to the bullies
We come to your block with nothing but choppers and them hoodies
We gon’ shoot everything that them niggas said we couldn’t (FamGoon)

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
I just hope this motherfucker don’t jam
I need you right now, I can’t let these niggas kill me
Wish my granny was alive, I know that she’d feel me
Abusing all these drugs, that’s the only thing that heal me
Abusing all these drugs, that’s the only thing that heal me

[Verse 2: Jefe]
Jefe Malcolm X, I keep the chopper in my hand
All Ahks to my left, he let a nigga think we playin’
My Famgoon niggas think I’m shootin’ out the Lam
No you are not a goon, you ain’t motherfuckin’ fam
I heard that you be scamming and you stunting on the gram
I heard that you a punk and you be telling on your mans
Your bitch she hit me up, she said she wanna fuck a man
Shooters runnin' with dracos on you pussies like blam
When you being humble then they always want to mumble
You can’t come to DC nigga, try it if you want to
Big Glizzy’s coming where you at to come confront you
When you pull up in my city ain’t nowhere to run to
Trapper turned rapper, yeah I really used to cook hard
We can have a cook off, nigga you just look hard
Always been a lil nigga, couldn’t play football
She tell her friends look y’all, I’m fucking with a big dog

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
I just hope this motherfucker don’t jam
I need you right now, I can’t let these niggas kill me
Wish my granny was alive, I know that she’d feel me
Abusing all these drugs, that’s the only thing that heal me
Abusing all these drugs, that’s the only thing that heal me

[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
I come from the bottom, nigga I come from the bottom
I feel like Mad Max ‘cause I hang around them shottas
You gotta watch these niggas, man these niggas ain’t your partners
Nigga stole from me so I hit him with that chopper
I made my own way, I ain’t sign a nigga’s deal
I went and bought a mic off some motherfuckin’ pills
Remember middle school, man they told me crack kills
Nigga fuck that, nigga crack pay bills
Want to make it to the top you got to shed tears
All that shit I did, I could’ve got a million years
My brother got killed, my partner got a hundred years
I turned 21, nigga shit got real
You was playing games, nigga I was in the field
You had an Xbox, nigga I had a piece of steel
My mama shed tears when I took her out that Kia
Nigga fuck the fame, you either fake or either real

[Hook: 21 Savage]
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
Man I pray this motherfucker don’t jam
I just hope this motherfucker don’t jam
I need you right now, I can’t let these niggas kill me
Wish my granny was alive, I know that she’d feel me
Abusing all these drugs, that’s the only thing that heal me
Abusing all these drugs, that’s the only thing that heal me
