[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Money in my pocket, yeah, that's automatic (Automatic)
Bitches goin' all in, yeah, that's automatic (Automatic)
With the smoke bullshit, with the static
New bitch, new crib like a palace
Bad bitch on the carpet, Aladdin (Automatic)
Baby ride it like a horse, she a stallion (Automatic)
Two-fifty on the chain and medallion (Automatic)
All my niggas came from that public housin' (Automatic)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
She get high, she could sniff a fuckin' mountain (Shorty wild)
Shawty squirt, body turn into a fountain (Automatic)
I'm a boss, she was lost and I found her
Ass round, super cake so I pound her
Got my nigga wit' me from the city, mane, yeah
Know I'm fuckin' wit' that Glizzy gang, yeah
Spend a bag, get them titties huge
While you at it, get that ass too-ass too

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Money in my pocket, yeah, that's automatic (Automatic)
Bitches goin' all in, yeah, that's automatic (Automatic)
With the smoke bullshit, with the static
New bitch, new crib like a palace
Bad bitch on the carpet, Aladdin (Automatic)
Baby ride it like a horse, she a stallion (Automatic)
Two-fifty on the chain and medallion (Automatic)
All my niggas came from that public housin' (Automatic)

[Verse 2: O.T. Genasis]
Move the trash, move the cash
Monster truck, move the dash
Foreign little bitch, shoes and bag
Skeet on her ass, who the dad?
Racks on me, packs on me
Pill rollin', crafts on me
Took her to the crib bet she tapped on me
Pulled her hair now I got tracks on me
No replacin', I don't want no relation
I don't want none, the basic
I'm 'bout to cum, she'll taste it
I got the 'Rari racin'
I'm at the border chasin'
I know they all are naked
Holes in my face, I'm Jason

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Money in my pocket, yeah, that's automatic (Automatic)
Bitches goin' all in, yeah, that's automatic (Automatic)
With the smoke bullshit, with the static
New bitch, new crib like a palace
Bad bitch on the carpet, Aladdin (Automatic)
Baby ride it like a horse, she a stallion (Automatic)
Two-fifty on the chain and medallion (Automatic)
All my niggas came from that public housin' (Automatic)

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy]
They can't fuckin' check me
Baby, tell me, is you ready?
They call me Young Jefe, bitch, if you win't never met me
Trey, he with them Glizzes, bitch, you know we Trigga happy
In LA with them bossy bitches, bitch, stop bein' petty
You never fucked a dope boy, bitch, I sell that shit so well
She in love with the coco, so I buy that bitch Chanel
And I just sent them rocks out to my niggas in them cells
Bitch, pull up to my traphouse, tell me you will never tell
Lil' momma full of joy, she say she like them bad boys
Said, "Bitch I like your booty," said she like my fast toy
You see these V-V-S's, baby, make me buy more
Bitch, please don't miss your blessin', it's the fuckin' trap lord

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Money in my pocket, yeah, that's automatic (Automatic)
Bitches goin' all in, yeah, that's automatic (Automatic)
With the smoke bullshit, with the static
New bitch, new crib like a palace
Bad bitch on the carpet, Aladdin (Automatic)
Baby ride it like a horse, she a stallion (Automatic)
Two-fifty on the chain and medallion (Automatic)
All my niggas came from that public housin' (Automatic)
