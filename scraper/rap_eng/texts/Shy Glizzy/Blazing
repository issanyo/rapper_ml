[Hook: YBS Skola]
My lifestyle is amazing
I’m a young nigga that’s blazing
Every day gettin’ to the money
Chasing it Sunday from Sunday
I need a trip out the country
Roll up a J under palm trees
I’m tryna hop out a foreign
This fuckin’ city is boring
My lifestyle is amazing
I’m a young nigga that’s blazing
Every day gettin’ to the money
Chasing it Sunday from Sunday
I need a trip out the country
Roll up a J under palm trees
This fuckin’ city is boring
I’m tryna hop out a foreign

[Verse 1: YBS Skola]
Bitch I was just in the A
Chilling with Meek and Rozay
Lit in the section with Nicki
Sippin’ on Actavis, rollin up sticky
Back to B-More, totin’ them blickies
I know they hatin’ so I keep it with me
Plus I be rockin’ the jewelry (bling)
They like boy you need security (no)
None of these fuck niggas scare me
I got a lot of new money coming
I’m doing all of these shows now
Im putting on for the team nigga
They know that Skola is up now
Long live up next, long live all my niggas gone
I’ma keep sayin’ y’all names
Puttin’ y’all names in every song
Long live all my soldiers, I’m putting on for the team
We chasing all of the green
Rocking them Cartiers like Ray Bans
Wearing Balmains like Levis
Where is the motherfuckin’ franchise?

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Jefe the lion
Young nigga I’m blazin’, can’t put out this fire
Lil bitch you’re a liar
We know you don’t work here, you need to get fired
Don’t play with my kindness
Or we come and whack ya, don’t make me remind ya
My niggas got diamonds
My niggas got timings, my niggas they shinners
Rest in peace Scoota
Rest in piece True, real nigga salute
Still countin’ blues
We’re still countin’ blues, yeah how could we lose?
Stop watching my moves
Bitch I got the juice, I’m stunting on you
Put this chopper to use
Keep it right on the seat like it came with the coupe
And I got all this from the mud nigga
So fuck whatever that you heard nigga
You ain’t never seen no bands nigga
Weird nigga, probably used to be a nerd nigga
You just got served nigga
