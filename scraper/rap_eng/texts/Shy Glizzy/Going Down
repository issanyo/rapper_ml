[Hook : Shy Glizzy]
We busting yo shit and lay that ass down (boom!)
Errbody on the dead ground
Then the party make a dance now
You play with Glizzy gang, it's going down
Going down, going down
I took one tooth my rissie, I was going down
Going down, going down
Bitch I'm mighty Glizzy, never going down

[Verse 1 : Shy Glizzy]
If my last night wasn't Glizzy, it'll be bang bang
Turn a pussy nigga into Lieutenant Down
I've been pouring codeine and popping champagne
I luv the game, bitch, my hood treat me like Bruce Wayne
Going down, going down, I'm with an immigrant, she from a foreign town
You suckas tryna play me but I'm on now
If you betray me, do not call my horn now
Just tuned up Bahamas, let's fuck up some commas
Bad bitch, she old enough to be my momma
Young nigga be stunting, he got real hunnids
IT's bout to go down and I'm just being honest

[Hook : Shy Glizzy]

[Verse 2: 30 Glizzy]
It's all real niggas when I look around
That 30 round, knock you out like Pacquiao
All this my money in my ear
Fuck what you're talking bout
I just left from Ocean Drive
Wet willie in her mouth
I road kill and my brothers winter south
What I'm talking bout?
We really running town
Check my background
I never made a sound
I heard a lotta nigas telling
Bitches going down
Wooh, it's really goin' down
Come to my neck of the woods see how it's goin' down
I got good folk, bitch just go and drown
Hit saint Glizzy phone if you want the pound
