[Intro]
Cardo on the beat
Young Jefe, hey
She know I'm a dope boy

[Chorus]
In love with a white girl
She's soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said give me dough, boy
In love with a white girl
She's soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said give me dough, boy

[Verse 1]
I seen 15 bricks today
You make 15 bucks an hour
Robbin' ass niggas in the kitchen, playin' with flour
I got all this power, you a fucking coward
My bitch come from France, oh, she like my Eiffel Tower
Oops, my plug got them blocks , just like LuLu
I supply your block, I give you work and tell you do you
You no fool, you know that the Glizzy Gang will shoot you
We're not backing down, we not run from shit but woo, woo
Cocaine, that's my bitch, we not run from shit but woo, woo
Cocaine, that's my bitch, oh, she made me rich
I wanna be like rich these niggas wanna be like Mitch
In the kitchen, whip my cook, white go, white go, whip
Free my dawg they book 'em just like Michael, Michael Vick

[Chorus]
In love with a white girl
She's soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said give me dough, boy
In love with a white girl
She's soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said give me dough, boy

[Verse 2]
Trips to Puerto Rico
Fucking with my Migos
Bitch, they sing like Ne-Yo
This shit do not come with cheat codes
Little overseas ho, wish I had a trio
Feisty like a lion, I forgot she was a Leo
She come from the slums
Grew up on first of the month
Know how to shoot a gun
Her father fought in Vietnam
She so fucking fine, yeah, she so fucking fine
She had a lot of niggas
She say I'm the dopest one
I got a lot of guns
I got a lot of paper
Won't nobody find ya body
Boy, I got a lot of acres
I give these niggas tips
Ooh, yall should've been some waiters
My wrists like dirty tricks
Ooh, I should've been a baker

[Chorus]
In love with a white girl
She's soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said give me dough, boy
In love with a white girl
She's soft as powder
I get hard around her
I whip her right here
She French, I'm a coke boy
Don't fuck with broke boys
She know I'm a dope boy
She said give me dough, boy
