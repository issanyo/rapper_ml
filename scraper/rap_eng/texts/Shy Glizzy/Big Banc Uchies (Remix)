[Verse 1: Drakeo the Ruler]
Sheesh, get some act right
F&N's knocking down black lives, that part
I should be baptized
I poured a five in a twenty ounce and passed out
Big Banc Uchies on the dashboard, Nascar
Rob who? they on bath salt, max park
It was all in a Jansport, transport
Twelve at night, I'm a vampire, transform

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Rob who? they on bath salt, max park
I'm flu flamming, I ain't never had to crack cards
It was all for the cash flow
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Rob who? they on bath salt, max park
I'm flu flamming, I ain't never had to crack cards
It was all for the cash flow
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
My flu flamming phenomenal
Rob that nigga Drakeo, that's a mission near impossible
The kamikaze doors with the Rotweiller gotta be
Get Drakeo some mud and you gon' meet a different side of me
I'm standing on hundreds in the booth while I ride the beat
Pippie Long Stocking head, flippin' through the pots and pans
Just knocked down Macho Man
Don't act bobble then, I really be rocking shit
It's all about the uchie, said sheesh and got my man

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Rob who? they on bath salt, max park
I'm flu flamming, I ain't never had to crack cards
It was all for the cash flow
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Rob who? they on bath salt, max park
I'm flu flamming, I ain't never had to crack cards
It was all for the cash flow
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy]
Big banc uchies on the dashboard (yeah)

Know you heard of GG nigga, we ain't no joke (GG)
We like to pop seals and we like to chop coats (yeah yeah)
Bitch I'm on the west coast ridin' with the toaster (west coast)
And I'm with them hitters, they'll kill you for a bonus (oh)
Flu flammer nigga, I don't do cameras nigga (nope)
Two hammers nigga, shoot at you and them niggas (bap bap bap)
I heard you niggas bitter, come and show me you're a killer (come on)
This for them fuckin' go getters (goddamn, goddamn)

[Chorus: Drakeo the Ruler]
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Rob who? they on bath salt, max park
I'm flu flamming, I ain't never had to crack cards
It was all for the cash flow
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Rob who? they on bath salt, max park
I'm flu flamming, I ain't never had to crack cards
It was all for the cash flow
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, that part
