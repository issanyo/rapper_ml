[Chorus]
All this money out here why fuck is these niggas playin
These niggas in mah way I need a mansion in Atlanta
And if I fuck with you Ima throw you extra grams
Please tell your favorite rapper to stay off my Instagram
I don't have a plan i just know i want a benz
Why is niggas playin' I don't think I understand
Nobody can’t owe me shit I need mah money in mah hand
It's time to sit the team down and ask them what they plan

[Verse 1:]
Ok hald up stop planning  need to put on yo minds
Niggas wants to diss me put on they librans
You don’t wanna shoot me you just wanna take that stand
Trick me out mah future tryin' to put me in that can
Bitch a not no stake block shout out benny C
One that gives mah tatoos am not scared a needles
Pull up on a bare hoe scoot i got mah bidness
Run and make his ass blow boom does it equal
Now they call me big glizzy i come from the trenches
Mah niggas got big glizzy promise they gonna play fare
Aren't even safe here you might catch a case here
Keep it on yo waist you might get erase here

[Chorus]
All this money out here why fuck is these niggas playin
These niggas in mah way I need a mansion in Atlanta
And if I fuck with you Ima throw you extra grams
Please tell your favorite rapper to stay off my Instagram
I don't have a plan i just know i want a benz
Why is niggas playin' I don't think I understand
Nobody can’t owe me shit I need mah money in mah hand
It's time to sit the team down and ask them what they plan

[Verse 2:]
See I can hear my track also i can hit the bank
You can keep the hood give me the big house with the lake
Flyin in there touch that down almost put the pain
Don't ask me if mah diamonds is VVS its fucking fake
My gucci bad as fuck we look like J LO and puff
I told her that if she love me then loyalty is a must
I get that money back and let them suckers chase the buck
Black killers play the front so get your niggas out the cut
And nigga what i just hit a lick we up
All these crispy hundreds damn i got a paper cut
Hundred on my truck i just put a hundred up
Fuck a hundred out there act like i don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
All this money out here why fuck is these niggas playin
These niggas in mah way I need a mansion in Atlanta
And if I fuck with you Ima throw you extra grams
Please tell your favorite rapper to stay off my Instagram
I don't have a plan i just know i want a benz
Why is niggas playin' I don't think I understand
Nobody can’t owe me shit I need mah money in mah hand
It's time to sit the team down and ask them what they plan
