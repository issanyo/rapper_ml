Jefe got that dough, they like gimme that
Fell out off the lean, woke up in the trap
Got me some new money, just got some new 'test
I got them blue hundreds, bro what you do for that?
This that new crack, this that new crack
This that new crack, this that new crack
This that new crack
This that, this that new crack
This that new crack

[Verse 1]
Fuck all them bitches who be actin' shady
You can ask your lady, bet I drove her crazy
I don't need your lady, boy I fuck with blaidy
I been rockin' Ralph Lauren since I was a baby
That bando got pianos, come and let the bands go
My famo got that ammo, better let your mans know
We got extended handles, don't know what they ran to
Told baby hit that gas, we don't need the hassle
If you wanna party we can have a party
My niggas catching bodies, I put that on Mozzy
See first I copped the mansion then I copped the Rari
I be all in your city, got your bitches on me

[Hook]
Jefe got that dough, they like gimme that
Fell out off the lean, woke up in the trap
Got me some new money, just got some new 'test
I got them blue hundreds, bro what you do for that?
This that new crack, this that new crack
This that new crack, this that new crack
This that new crack
This that, this that new crack
This that new crack

[Verse 2]
Flier than a pilot, 'bout to start a riot
They fuckin' with my patience, tryna get inside me
Don't ask me tip you off, sorry I ain't got it
Made myself a boss, I don't need nobody
I'm the type of quarterback don't listen to the coach
Still hit a lick for a hundred bricks of coke
I just bought 100 straps for everyone to tote
Glizzy Gang the mob, baby I'm the CEO
Why you so hardcore? that's because they like it raw
Jotting down my thoughts, can't explain that to the law
I was just a little boy who was living really hard
Now I'm my own boss, I don't worry 'bout shit at all

[Hook]
Jefe got that dough, they like gimme that

This that new crack, this that new crack
This that new crack, this that new crack
This that new crack
This that, this that new crack
