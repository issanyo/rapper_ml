[Intro]
Glizzy Gang, bang bang
Young Jefe Holmes
Is they gon' slide? ya

[Hook]
You keep them niggas right beside of you
How many gon' ride for you?
How many gon' ride?
Will they gon' slide for you

Tell me is they gon' slide girl?
I ain't going to lie to you
I ain't really got time for you
But I'm really gon' ride, yea
Girl I'm gon' ride for you
I'm really gon' ride for you
I told my bitch I'm gon' ride, yea

[Verse 1]
Come on let's make them hate
Make them pout they face
All I had was faith
I made them ride the wave
I got a bad bitch who say she down to the grave
She such a down bitch I have her with me catching plays
Tell me how is that your shooter and you never seen him shoot?
You posing with your little guns you think that shit look cute
No I don't be in the loop but of course I get the loot
Every time they think turnt tho we gon' put that shit on mute hey
Put that shit on mute, hey put that shit on mute
I just made 200 I might go and cop a coupe
If you know you can't score then throw your dog the alley-oop
37 be my same, Glizzy Gang be my troops

[Hook]
You keep them niggas right beside of you
How many gon' ride for you?
How many gon' ride?
Boy they gon' slide for you
Is somebody gon' die for you?
Tell me is they gon' slide girl?
I ain't going to lie to you
I ain't really got time for you
But I'm really gon' ride, yea
Girl I'm gon' ride for you
I'm really gon' ride for you
I told my bitch I'm gon' ride, yea

[Verse 2]
Remember when I went to school, ain't do shit but my math dawg
I was running mad hard trying to get my bags off
Tuesdays and Thursdays we used to run from mad dog
Guess how many times me and my niggas had to blast off
They play with me I blow they ass off
Bad bitch and her ass soft
She treat me like damn god
Yea they better know that cash talk
Watch me do my cash walk
I ain't doing no damn talking
No you can't come over here lil' hoe
Can't come over here lil' hoe
Chilling with my bitch lil' hoe
And they can't keep it real no more
They can't keep it real no more
They can't come over here no more

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
You keep them niggas right beside of you
How many gon' ride for you?
How many gon' ride?
Boy they gon' slide for you
Is somebody gon' die for you?
Tell me is they gon' slide girl?
I ain't going to lie to you
I ain't really got time for you
But I'm really gon' ride, yea
Girl I'm gon' ride for you
I'm really gon' ride for you
I told my bitch I'm gon' ride, yea
