[Intro: Interviewer, Big Mota & Shy Glizzy]
Give us a rundown of people that you working with the new project and the people you plan on working with
Man I'm tryna man get into man you know the boy Shy Glizzy
We need 50 for this motherfucker
Nigga 50
Nigga you should've did a song nigga! 50! 50!
'Cause we asked you nicely to do a song
You said get the fuck out your face!
Young Jefe Holmes! These prices way to high
You need to cut it!

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it

[Verse: Shy Glizzy]
They tried to bust a move when we was two deep
Bitch I still got my groove
That shit was too weak
Had to move to Memphis for a whole week
Choppers in that Sprinter
We ain't making no tweets
Boy how you want a feature?
Ain't go no cheese
I wasn't bout to let your fat ass come Debo me
I'm just running through South Memphis with my OG
These rappers need to cut it
They ain't bout no beef
Do you know how it feel to get respect nigga?
Then niggas wanna do shit 'cause the next nigga
Oh you seen me on them blogs
You thought I got checked didn't you?
That ain't yo dog if he can't go hit the set with ya
Sorry I'm not with the fucking gimmicks
How you playing with a hitter for a fucking image?
I know every DJ but this pussy Akademiks
Chain hit the floor and broke boys had a fucking scrimmage
You say you a robber I'm saying
So why you ain't go at my bands
Glizzy Gang
We Taliban
A.k.a them boys who don't eat no ham
And plus he hop out the van
Spray you and two of your mans
I'm going to DR in the morning
My bitch got to go see her fam
These rappers, they not gonna ride
Security not on your side
They gotta know that ain't goin' slide
They gotta know that ain't goin' slide
You better keep one by your side
You better keep one by your side
I just gave the word to them guys
They shoot his ass right in his eye
We don't give a fuck bout your set
We don't give a fuck who you with
We don't give a fuck what you bang
You real nigga
You fuck with the gang
Oh yeah and I got the chain
But I'm not wearing that shit
I can't wear that shit after lames
I told my jeweler more carats and shit
All the real niggas they know
All the bitches still go
Ain't no one stopping the show
But you better stop doing shows
They say they wanted a 50
They must be talking to Mickey
A lot of this shit smelling fishy
Them niggas can't come to my city
These niggas can't come to my city
Or niggas going to run into Glizzy
And all of them niggas who 50
They gonna run from the glizzies
See niggas get attacked in my city
We don't gotta act like we friendly
I make them racks in your city
And I'm coming back to your city
Somebody tell they ass they need to cut it
Why they acting like its something that it wasn't?
These niggas they just stunting out in public
Book me for another show and we goin' thug it
You want a verse my guy?
You need to cut it
You know these prices way too high
You need to cut it
Wait 'til you see my new piece
That bitch flooded
Rock that bitch everywhere
And I dare a nigga to touch it

[Outro: DJ Akademiks]
You know, man, I've been fucking with Shy Glizzy for the longest
To me, that's my fucking favorite rapper out of DC
Now I get it
