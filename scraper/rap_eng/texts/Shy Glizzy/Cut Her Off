[Hook: K camp]
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
So what you saying ho?
You Know I'm the man ho?
Nothing but a bird I'mma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man ho
Hope he understand though
You ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying, though
Saying, though
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Bitch its Young Jef√© so you bet not call me Jefe
Screaming "Free Guwop"let my bitch out on the expressway
Stu just called my phone told him meet me at the erray
Took that bitch to LIV she ain't never seen confetti
We got decent drugs, We got decent drugs
Who is Glizzy signed to? Im signed to the plug
Yo bitch is a chooser, bet not bring her to the club
Cause if she see Young Jefe she gon' jump up out her uggs
New 550 bitch cut off when I start
Bitch from Mississippi get cut off cause she dont talk
Bitch its Glizzy Glizzy can I fuck you with my Glock
She from Italy, She with the mob, she eat with chopsticks
Young trap god, I might catch a body
Got that stingray I coulda copped a maserati
I heard he signed with meek, they heard he signed with gotti
You think im still running with these fucking nobodies?
