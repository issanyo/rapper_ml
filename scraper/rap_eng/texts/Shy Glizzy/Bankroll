[Intro]
Bankrolls, Glizzy gang shit

[Hook]
You ain't gotta like me, bet you know my name, dawg
Ain't need a nigga to put me in the game, dawg
Just copped some new ice, every diamond in my chain glow
I got street money on me like I'm Bankroll
These bitches they gon' fuck me for a bankroll
Yo' nigga love you when you got a bankroll
Them shooters, they gon' murk you for a bankroll
Trynna be cool for these bitches, hurt yo' bankroll

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, RIP to Bankroll
Cop a nickle for the summer, been the main goal
Kinda like her cause she don't fuck with them lame hoes
She say she thuggin', so I let her kiss the ring, bro
And if you see a nigga with me he got ammo
No, you won't see a nigga with me if he ain't told
And all these bamas always flexin' like they ain't broke
How you a trapper? You can't get a beat from Zayto'
I got my own shit, got my own clique
They don't be on this, these niggas be on dicks
I get a lot of money, I buy a lot of shit
You just follow trends, homie, you ain't fly as this

[Hook]
You ain't gotta like me, bet you know my name, dawg
Ain't need a nigga to put me in the game, dawg
Just copped some new ice, every diamond in my chain glow
I got street money on me like I'm Bankroll
These bitches they gon' fuck me for a bankroll
Yo' nigga love you when you got a bankroll
Them shooters, they gon' murk you for a bankroll
Trynna be cool for these bitches, hurt yo' bankroll

[Verse 2]
Oh it's 3 am, I'm off the weed and Henn'
They tryin' to be his friends, at first they ain't believe in him
Yea, he know how to stack that dope
That's just the street in him
I'm trynna bang that lil' hoe and her conceded friend
I'm so bravehearted, I'm a fuckin' lion
I spent 50 thousand on a fuckin' time
A nigga owe me money, won't send no daily reminder
He rockin' fake designer, his shit was made in China
Self made on 'em, I get paid on 'em
Jefe on 'em, let it spray on 'em
I get cake on 'em, bitches wait on 'em
Know they hate on 'em, I just wave on 'em

[Hook]
You ain't gotta like me, bet you know my name, dawg
Ain't need a nigga to put me in the game, dawg
Just copped some new ice, every diamond in my chain glow
I got street money on me like I'm Bankroll
These bitches they gon' fuck me for a bankroll
Yo' nigga love you when you got a bankroll
Them shooters, they gon' murk you for a bankroll
Trynna be cool for these bitches, hurt yo' bankroll

[Outro]
Had to let these niggas know I'm goin' hard as ever, man
New shit on the way
New whips on the way, nigga
New jewelry, nigga, new cribs, new spots, nigga
New everything, nigga, new truck, nigga
