[Intro]
Young Jefe, ayy

[Chorus]
These niggas talk that bullshit but they don't want no pressure
Laser on the Glock, boy I spot you then I wet you
Heard some niggas in the city after the finesser
I'm probably with your shawty, you won't ever see her ever
She had a lot of niggas, she ain't had a nigga better
Ain't fuckin' with you niggas, she say Jefe get her wetter
Can't take you to my house but baby I can give you pleasure
Put it in your mouth and you'll be loving me forever

[Verse 1]
He buggin' her, he miss her, but she beggin' me to hit her
He can't get his bitch back 'cause she with a nigga triller
Just the other day I heard they found my nigga's killer
10K on the tray, I want that nigga in a zipper
Sippin' on this dirty and I'm with my nigga 30
Bitch we keep them thirties 'cause these niggas playin' dirty
The more you acting scary then the faster you get buried
And a nigga ain't got no worries 'cause I shoot that bitch like Curry
I'm her number one contender, she like bitches on the low
I'm the one she gon' remember, have her walking pigeon-toed
Yeah I come up off them stones, tell 'em some to get note
Got a bad redbone, told her get it on the floor

[Chorus]
These niggas talk that bullshit but they don't want no pressure
Laser on the Glock, boy I spot you then I wet you
Heard some niggas in the city after the finesser
I'm probably with your shawty, you won't ever see her ever
She had a lot of niggas, she ain't had a nigga better
Ain't fuckin' with you niggas, she say Jefe get her wetter
Can't take you to my house but baby I can give you pleasure
Put it in your mouth and you'll be loving me forever

[Verse 2]
Love me for eternity or please don't love me never
Oops I think she on to me so girl let's get this cheddar
Never been a webster baby, c'mon let me test you
Glizzy I'm a weapon shawty I do protecting
Went some places last winter, one vacation I remember
Back to the first night when I took lil ma to dinner
Was lookin' like a Kim but she was acting like a Jenner
She say she gon' hold me down, ooh I think I got a winner
Young nigga from the streets, young nigga gotta eat
Young nigga I feel your pain, young nigga that once was me
I was standing out in that rain, tellin' my lord don't sell my tree
Now I got diamonds all in my chain, niggas they sat all in my seat

[Chorus]
These niggas talk that bullshit but they don't want no pressure
Laser on the Glock, boy I spot you then I wet you
Heard some niggas in the city after the finesser
I'm probably with your shawty, you won't ever see her ever
She had a lot of niggas, she ain't had a nigga better
Ain't fuckin' with you niggas, she say Jefe get her wetter
Can't take you to my house but baby I can give you pleasure
Put it in your mouth and you'll be loving me forever
