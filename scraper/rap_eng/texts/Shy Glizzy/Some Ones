[Hook:Shy Glizzy]
She just lost her job
She ain't got no where to live
They took her house and car, She just worried bout' her kids
Her baby daddy shit
She use him for the dick
They left her with no choice
She said fuck it imma strip

[Verse 1:]
She ain't have no work today
So she went out to play
Came home next day, they said she had 30 days
She don't know what to do she can't afford another place
Just found out she was pregnant
Nigga caught another case
Lost her father and her brother
She barely see her mother
Patron for the pain, she ain't got no one to love her
Her nigga don't want her so she got his name covered
No longer give a fuck, she just want some one to fuck her

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Hired her at stadium
Must have made the audition
Walk around, titties jiggling, and her ass just sittin'
Been dancin' all year hope she have a good Christmas
Say she got her faith in God
She ain't Muslim or Christian
Employee of the Month
She expect an extension
Work place ain't making funds
They put her on suspension
Went and got some butt shots, just to get some attention
She don't fuck with fake niggas, she grew up in the trenches

[Hook]
