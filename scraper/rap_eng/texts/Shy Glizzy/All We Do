[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
These niggas Lawrence Fishburn, all they do is act
Shoutout my nigga Baby, all he sip is Act
Shoutout my nigga Three because he keep that strap
Born in the trap, my mother and my father trap
See now we worldwide, we started off hustlin'
I fuck with bloods, I fuck with crips, I fuck with Muslims
Get you popped for a pair of new Foamposites
Fuck whoever, I stay high ho, I'm my own pilot
Pitsburgh, Jack City, I put my hood on
Subway blocks, we smoke them bitches foot long
And all my niggas stylin', all my niggas wylin'
My bitch hood but my kicks they are Italian

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
All we do is blow these racks, you know we get 'em back
All we do is pour it up, you know we smoke that pack
All we do is fuck up Barney's then we fuck up Saks
All we do is fuck your ho and then we give her back
That's all we do, that's all we do
Blow these racks, you know we get 'em back
That's all we do, that's all we do
Fuck your ho and then we give her back

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
As-Salaam-Alaikum, shoutout to my brothers
If you eat bacon I don't trust ya, word to my mother
Them niggas might be street, we just a lil tougher
I'm ballin' in the league, they playin' at Ruckers
Lil nigga, but you can call me Big Glizzy
Nigga fuck your thirty clip, these drums hold fifty
And I got a big crush on Iggy
If I ever get my chance then she stuck with me
Just landed in the A, I'm headed straight to Boulevard
Young crew got the toolie he'll shoot your pops
And I be kicking pimpin' in the 3 with Guap
Might follow you from Lenox just to get your watch

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
All we do is blow these racks, you know we get 'em back
All we do is pour it up, you know we smoke that pack
All we do is fuck up Barney's then we fuck up Saks
All we do is fuck your ho and then we give her back
That's all we do, that's all we do
Blow these racks, you know we get 'em back
That's all we do, that's all we do
Fuck your ho and then we give her back
