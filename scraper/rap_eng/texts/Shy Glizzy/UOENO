[Shy Glizzy]
If it ain't that OG dont even roll it
Sent the weak bitch emojis, i ain't even show it
Police tryna come get me i already know it
I pay the lawyer fees, they dont even know it
I know niggas mothers on crack, they dont even know it
If my youngin's broke or not they gettin them jordans
Niggas watch my instagram i already know it
Wanna dress like me, wish you had these bands, i already know it
Yo gotti came to my city, said he fuckin' wit Glizzy
Cocaine Music i need a feature from winnie
I bought my bitch a 50, she know how to pop a wheelie
Free the gang you better not snitch not even if you guilty
Had a piece from 'round the corners, beat the cat like dalahoya
I never seen her daughter, just car seats in her toyota
I run shit in my city, like that nigga Alfred Morris
I get high off'a fiji water, you don't even know it
