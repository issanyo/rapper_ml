[Hook: Don Trip]
You gon’ pull up in what? Bet some money
You gon’ do what to who? Then bet some money
I just don’t believe you, just bet some money
Nah I just don’t believe you, then bet some money
I bet any kind of money you just full of shit
I bet any kind of money you just full of shit
Nah I just don’t believe you, bet some money
Nah I just don’t believe you, then bet some money

[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Your car don’t come out till when? Right
From what I hear in your mixtape you been rich your whole life
So come take a walk with me
Let me introduce you to all my guys
Please take your hands up out my pockets and keep them visible at all times
You see cause they don’t know much about you
And your tape ain’t quite a voucher
Kill that noise, nigga don’t be mad at us
The shit you rapping bout just ain’t adding up
You got tons of it or so I hear
Well ain’t no way these streets is dry
Ain’t no way there could be a drought
Look at all the work you supply
You just rapping, I’m no Pablo
Never have I ever gave that impression
I came from one ounce, it’s nothing special
Now I’m flyer than all the Jettisons
And I’m not rich as I want to be, wish I could mentor the younger me
I used to be saying I went through hell so I kinda transformed like Bumblebee
And ain’t no money gon’ come to me
And I won’t sell my soul to get it
I just say what I’m going through
I cross my fingers and hope you get it
I know you lying, but at least it sound good
I mean I get it, it’s entertainment
Cause the only thing worse than being broke
Must be being broke while you’re famous

You gon’ pull up in what? Bet some money
You gon’ do what to who? Then bet some money
I just don’t believe you, just bet some money
Nah I just don’t believe you, then bet some money
I bet any kind of money you just full of shit
I bet any kind of money you just full of shit
Nah I just don’t believe you, bet some money
Nah I just don’t believe you, then bet some money

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
I’m not so fake and you not so real
I cut the deals and you got a deal
30 K on my Glizzy piece
Naw bitch, I ain’t got to chill
Might run up on you, enjoy the heat
Mama this month I got the bills
My young nigga heated, he tryna beef
Running round asking who got the pills
He off the Perc and he off the Molly
Play with Glizzy, he catch a body
Big chopper send you to the doctor
Sorry Scotty, you can keep the shotty
Ching ching before everybody
All my niggas pull up in Audis
Real nigga walk in the room
Shh, everybody be quiet
I spent 100 this month
Bet 100 you a punk
Always talking bout you got 100 in the trunk
Short [?] ass always in the front
Bitch give me head while I’m lighting up a blunt
She say Jefe let me see you stunt
Sorry not a hater, no you got the wrong one
Fuck what you heard, go anywhere I want
