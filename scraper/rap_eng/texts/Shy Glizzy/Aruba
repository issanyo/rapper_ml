[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
Young Jefe holmes

[Chorus: Lil Freaky]
I been rocking water from Aruba
Lil mama got water from Aruba
I won't hesitate, I'ma shoot ya
Drippin' in this sauce, they like ooh, ahh
I been rocking water from Aruba
I been rocking water from Aruba
Lil mama got water from Aruba
Pull up, hop out, drippin' like a schoolyard

[Verse 1: Lil Freaky]
Pull up, hop out, drippin' like a schoolyard, ayy
I can pull up hop out, I can school a lil nigga for real
I been drippin' every day and I ain't sign no deal
And I'm with the same gang, all my niggas right here
Disrespect that 0-2-7, that PRG, get killed
Riding with the steel in trenches, don't play 'cause you get flipped
We don't go on dates 'cause we gon' fuck them hoes off the rip
Every time I load down, they hollow tips, ayy
Ask me why I'm slowed down, 'cause I'm on sip, ayy
Don't you bring your ho around, 'cause you'll get pimped, ayy
You know 0-2-7 around, and you gettin' shrimped, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Freaky]
I been rocking water from Aruba
Lil mama got water from Aruba
I won't hesitate, I'ma shoot ya
Drippin' in this sauce, they like ooh, ahh
I been rocking water from Aruba
I been rocking water from Aruba
Lil mama got water from Aruba
Pull up, hop out, drippin' like a schoolyard

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Glizzy Glizzy hop out with that Ruger
That thirty clip, it hang out like a ruler
Just took a nigga's bitch out to Aruba
She told me that you couldn't, you's a loser
Please don't try to diss to get your views up
My niggas got them sticks, you make the news, yeah
Better not play with Jefe, he's a shooter
For that mula he gon' pop at your medula
So please don't let this lil designer fool ya
Fly trappers only, I'll do ya
That water 'round my neck just like a scuba
Hop out your bushes with that draco, nigga booyah

[Chorus: Lil Freaky]
I been rocking water from Aruba
Lil mama got water from Aruba
I won't hesitate, I'ma shoot ya
Drippin' in this sauce, they like ooh, ahh
I been rocking water from Aruba
I been rocking water from Aruba
Lil mama got water from Aruba
Pull up, hop out, drippin' like a schoolyard
Pull up, hop out, drippin' like a schoolyard
