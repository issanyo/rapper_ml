[Intro]
I'm just waitin' on my time, I'm just waitin' on my time
Jefe, they know me

[Hook]
They say why you never smile? cause a lot be on my mind
When they ass ain't have a dime they was with me all the time
These niggas get some shine now they actin' like they blind
Oh they must've seen my Rolex, I'm just waitin' on my time
I'm waitin' on my time, I'm just waitin' on my time
I'm waitin' on my time, I'm waitin' on my time
My VVS's shine, bitch I'm waitin' on my time
Homie have some lines while I'm waitin' on my time

[Verse 1]
Oh now y'all wanna worry 'bout Glizzy? bitch I'm good
A couple niggas told me they could get me out the hood
You think I listen to them niggas? hah I wish I would
I'm still thuggin' with the same niggas from my hood
I stunt out on a hater, yeah I pull out in my new toy
They ain't makin' no noise, they ain't makin' no noise
They like look at old boy, remember he was broke boy
Now he got that dope boy, he might take your ho boy
I been on some shit, my mama said I'm actin' different
She know a baby will is some shit that I ain't mentioning
Real nigga walk up in this bitch, you better listen
Bought my bitch an Audi, she ain't gettin' shit for Christmas

[Hook]
They say why you never smile? cause a lot be on my mind
When they ass ain't have a dime they was with me all the time
These niggas get some shine now they actin' like they blind
Oh they must've seen my Rolex, I'm just waitin' on my time
I'm waitin' on my time, I'm just waitin' on my time
I'm waitin' on my time, I'm waitin' on my time
My VVS's shine, bitch I'm waitin' on my time
Homie have some lines while I'm waitin' on my time

[Verse 2]
I'm toolin', you know that
Get rich and get your racks
[?] up and get your ho back
I fucked her to that Kodak
I'm tryna make some M's, I ain't tryna be your friend
I been seein' trill niggas act like they don't see him
Soon as I switch it up they just gon' do that shit again
Made a hundred in a month, next month I do that shit again
Glizzy keep the heat, Yeezys on my feet
Bitch I'm looking sweet, you ain't fuckin' then it's peace
I got goons to go, eenie miny moe
Used to get it in Ohio, never been to Idaho
I got my jewels from Joe, I hit every bitch you know
If the rap shit don't blow then it's back to what I know

[Hook]
They say why you never smile? cause a lot be on my mind
When they ass ain't have a dime they was with me all the time
These niggas get some shine now they actin' like they blind
Oh they must've seen my Rolex, I'm just waitin' on my time
I'm waitin' on my time, I'm just waitin' on my time
I'm waitin' on my time, I'm waitin' on my time
My VVS's shine, bitch I'm waitin' on my time
Homie have some lines while I'm waitin' on my time
