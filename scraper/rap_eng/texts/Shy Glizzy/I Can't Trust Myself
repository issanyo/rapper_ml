They say them broke boys do anything for some wealth
Nigga shoot by yourself you don't need no help
I can't trust myself, I can't trust myself
So fuck I look like trusting anybody else
I can't trust myself (x6)
So fuck I look like trusting anybody else

[Verse 1]
See its this nigga name Shy, he so fuckin' fly
Glizzy don't fuck with shy
Cause shy he think he "That Guy"
But Glizzy Be wit some dudes and all they do is lie
They were on a bad movie, trying to move to the Chi
Dope boy named Detroit, but he ain't from Detroit
