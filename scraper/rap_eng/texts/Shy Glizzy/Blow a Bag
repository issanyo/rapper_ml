[Intro]
Young Jefe holmes, oh
GG for life
Goose with another one

[Chorus]
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
They call me Young Jefe, girl I know you like my swag
If you want this shit forever then you better make it last
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
We ridin' in them foreigns, gettin' ass inside the Jag
Yes I make these niggas mad, got some killers who gon' blast
Make me blow a bag

[Verse 1]
Remember when I met you, girl I told you you was special
I told you would love me girl, you thought that I was flexin'
Them other niggas missed they lick, they thought they would finesse you
All this balling got 'em salty, turned these niggas into pretzels
Alright, alright, we can do this all night
Bitch my outfit all white, we can have 'em all fight
Sent a runner to the store and told him get me all the Sprites
Bitch my stash house is a hike, got them big old racks inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Gucci, Louis, Pucci, baby your life is a movie
She regret givin' up the booty, bitch go and sue me
One day, "Papi that's your coochy," next day like she never knew me
All my friends are dead, that's why I be ridin' 'round with that Uzi

[Chorus]
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
They call me Young Jefe, girl I know you like my swag
If you want this shit forever then you better make it last
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
We ridin' in them foreigns, gettin' ass inside the Jag
Yes I make these niggas mad, got some killers who gon' blast
Make me blow a bag

[Verse 2]
Yeah I was thinkin' 'bout wifing it but I ended up one-nighting it
The way she suck the dick I swear this lil bitch is so trifling
Girl I had all type of bitches, you one of the baddest
She say that I'm too savage, I know you don't like 'em average
Know you can't replace me, are you fucking crazy
A lot of niggas ain't me, baby baby baby
A lot of niggas hate me, lot of niggas ain't player
Lot of niggas change ways, bitch we still the same gang

[Pre-Chorus]
Gucci, Louis, Pucci, baby your life is a movie
She regret givin' up the booty, bitch go and sue me
One day, "Papi that's your coochy," next day like she never knew me
All my friends are dead, that's why I be ridin' 'round with that Uzi

[Chorus]
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
They call me Young Jefe, girl I know you like my swag
If you want this shit forever then you better make it last
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
Make me blow a bag baby, make me blow a bag
We ridin' in them foreigns, gettin' ass inside the Jag
Yes I make these niggas mad, got some killers who gon' blast
Make me blow a bag
