[Intro]

[Hook]
Earnin’, stealin’, takin’ over

You know what they say though Mo, the more
Money more problems
He think he the shit now ‘cause he got a bitch from Harlem
We got, we got big rounds, and my young niggas robbing
Robbin’ season, robbin’ season
Bitch it's a stick up, it’s robbin’ season, robbin’ season
Did somebody say it robbin’ season? robbin’ season
Give that shit up, yeah it’s robbin’ season, robbin’ season

[Verse 1]
When them Glizzys pull out, we gon’ torture y’all
We gon’ show you that we ain’t got no remorse for y’all
God damnit, I can’t go out, I got court tomorrow
If they talking bullshit then it’s straight to Portugal
Young niggas don’t play, mask all on they face
Shooter got that K, shoot ya like MJ
Fuck a bitch named Nae, daddy snort that yay
Five hundred K, still around the way

Whatever for the mula, it’s whatever for the mula, ya

[Verse 2]
Let’s make it hard for these niggas like it’s 2009
Run up on ‘em with them chickens, put it right in they spine
Make ‘em call they OGs and have ‘em loan ‘em an iron
And if you ain’t got an iron you better not come outside
All I think about is money all day
And my little spanish bitch from broadway
Know some real trappers who be in them hallways
I’m talking 5 days straight, then do ‘em all day
Hello, what’s up?
Tell ‘em pull up
I’m right in a circle with them fuckin’ hitters
Diamonds water
Shit give you the hiccups (ice, ice)
Try to run up on me, you gon’ give your shit up

[Hook]
Earnin’, stealin’, takin’ over

We got, we got big rounds, and my young niggas robbing
Robbin’ season, robbin’ season
Bitch, its a stick up, it’s robbin’ season, robbin’ season
Did somebody say it robbin’ season? robbin’ season
Give that shit up, yeah it’s robbin’ season, robbin’ season
