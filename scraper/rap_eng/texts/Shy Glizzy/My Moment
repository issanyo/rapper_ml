[Intro]
Just waitin' on my moment, waitin' on my moment, yeah
Only thing I wish is that my niggas could see this moment
But they dead or America's most wanted

[Verse]
Niggas thinkin' shit sweet 'cause I rap now
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm still holdin' the trap down
Still lookin' for a lick when I ride around
Niggas'll kill you just for lookin' on my side of town
I'm fly like Pluto, you down to earth
I got a cute ho, your bitch the worst
All my life I been cursed, put it in a verse
Moms got a Benz, pops got the hearse
Niggas better have a scale when I'm coppin'
Short me a gram and this Glock get to rockin'
I be fuckin' with that white, John Stockton
My plug want me to rob Ricky Martin
This right here for all my niggas in the slammer
This for all the kids that love me more than Santa
I don't love nothin' but my mother and my first hammer
They lucky I can't put my real life in the camera
I know I say a lot of shit but I'm for real though
Your favorite rapper is Robert Deniro
I been on the same street since I was zero
Fuck Superman, this Glock nine my hero
Who else gon' save me, pistol on me daily
I am my shooter, is you fuckin' crazy?
I swear I should've went to the Navy
Young nigga had precision since a three-eighty
Nigga fuck the old days, what's up now?
I always been bad, I just don't give a fuck now
Hey rappers, I'll bust you for your bust down
Hey trappers, cut the shit, we had enough now
And tell the hip-hop police that I ain't beefin'
They keep fuckin' with a nigga for no reason
Mama cried a lot of tears but she ain't greiving
Ain't got a deal but I had a lot of meetings

[Outro]
Just waitin' on that moment
I'll know when it come
But when it come
Make sure I'm around some real motherfuckers
I don't wanna have to kill one of these industry niggas
You know I keep it on me
It ain't Glizzy Gang for nothin'
It ain't Shy Glizzy for nothin'
Fire
