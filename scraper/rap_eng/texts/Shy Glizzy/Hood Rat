[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I ain't had a girl in a long, long time
I don't even know what love feel like
Girl how you gon' hang in the hood all the time
And you don't even know what thugs feel like
I'm screamin' fuck these bitches, it's money over bitches
I smoke one to the head then I take that to the grave
I'm screamin' fuck these bitches, it's money over bitches
I smoke one to the head then I take that to the grave, uh

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
She said she ain't never ever date a thug
That's because all she ever date is strubs
Roll it up, all we ever smoke is drugs
I'm connected, bitch I bet I know the plug
I'm with a driver, shit I think I'm George Bush
I hope out smokin', smellin' like a pound of kush
She wanna fuck my tattoos like the song say
I'm high, so this bitch look like Beyonce (she bad)
The baddest bitch actin' like she not a groupie
Yeah right ho, she know she can't even fool me
And she know I'm a hood star
I can't fuck one, she know I need two or more

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I ain't had a girl in a long, long time
I don't even know what love feel like
Girl how you gon' hang in the hood all the time
And you don't even know what thugs feel like
I'm screamin' fuck these bitches, it's money over bitches
I smoke one to the head then I take that to the grave
I'm screamin' fuck these bitches, it's money over bitches
I smoke one to the head then I take that to the grave, uh

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Let me kick my pimpin', hold up, wait, listen
Met a bitch named Diamond, I told her mines glistenin'
Aww, that nigga main ho missin'
I seen that girl strippin', should've seen how I was tippin'
Like clothes designer, my bitches from the hood
Had a bitch that went to Howard, she thought she was too good
Got a bitch that steal clothes, got a bitch that make juggs
Pick 'em up before they fall like a real nigga should
In love, I need a Girl that sell the blanco
A bitch that help a nigga whip up all this damn coke
Got your Instagram crush with me 'round the yo
Your bitch be on the pole, my bitches be in fashion shows

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I ain't had a girl in a long, long time
I don't even know what love feel like
Girl how you gon' hang in the hood all the time
And you don't even know what thugs feel like
I'm screamin' fuck these bitches, it's money over bitches
I smoke one to the head then I take that to the grave
I'm screamin' fuck these bitches, it's money over bitches
I smoke one to the head then I take that to the grave, uh
