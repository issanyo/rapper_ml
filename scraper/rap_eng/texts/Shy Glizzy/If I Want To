[Hook:Shy Glizzy]
I Can Fuck Your Bitch If I Want To
She Can Get The Dick When She Want To
I Can Rob The Plug If I Want To
I Come To Your Home If I Want To
If I Want To Baby If I Want To
I'm Getting Money Baby Don't Want You
If I Want To Baby If I Want To
I'm Getting Money Baby Don't Want You

[Verse 1:Shy Glizzy]
I'm Waiting For This New Plug To Come Through
I Almost Touchdown But I Fumble
You Can't Come To My Hood It's A Jungle
Do You Know How Many Woods I Had To Run Through
I Kidnapped You Daughter If I Want To
We Fly To Bora Bora When We Want To
I Got Gallons Of Water If You Want To
I Know Niggas Smoking Water Because They Want To
I Just Pull The Trigger I Don't Rumble
I Been Getting Money Since The Tunnel
You Can Play With Glizzy If You Want To
Now Let Me See What This Gun Do

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
I Can Fly To Paris If I Want To
I Can Fuck Yaris If I Want To
You Only Buy A Pair I Get A Bundle
It's Glizzy Glizzy Baby Yea I Stun To
I Can Get A Deal If I Want To
You Can't Keep It Real If You Want To
I Be Smoking Loud Your Shit Mumble
Risk My Life For Money That I'mma Run Through
I Can't Wait To Make It Out The Struggle
And A Nigga Might Hate On Me Like Lil Snupe
I Can Get You Pop If You Want To
I Love My Glock We Such A Good Couple
