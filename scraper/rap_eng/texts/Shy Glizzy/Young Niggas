[Verse 1 – Boosie Badazz]
I’m a young nigga with a Wayne P flow
I’m a young nigga who can slang that dope
I come from bandos and bricks where niggas talk murder
OGs with clips who really bout murder
Glock 4 on my hip, my nigga you’on’t want it
Make me hop on that i6, and call donkey
IZIZ we talk Chinese, you can’t get the picture
Guess why my mama love my friends, they all my killers
If you ain’t know, ask about me, I’m getting money nigga
6 shows, 6 hundred I’m getting money nigga
Riding round in that Rolls Royce, alligator on the back seat
Heckler up in my lap bitch, Nina walk in my trap bitch

[Hook – Boose & Glizzy][x2]
I’m a young nigga, getting paid
All we do is get paid
I’m a young, with AK, AK
All we do is bust K

[Verse 2 – Shy Glizzy]
Who that young nigga that been running round with Boosie?
Glizzy Badazz with that motherfucking uzi
All my young niggas, they be running round with toolies
Wild 90s baby, rock Versace shades and Coogi
GG head hancho, I’m the motherfucking sergeant
A nigga played with Glizzy, turned his ass into a target
I’m just living lucky, niggas mad cause they can’t stop it
They almost took my life, I still got blood stains on my boxers
Straight from train 7, young nigga with attitude
And real niggas respect me from DC to Baton Rouge
Bitch look at my bankroll, bet you see a lot of blues
Not scared to bang that tool, might catch me on breaking news, bitch

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 3 – Boosie Badazz]
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but choppers’ll hurt me
If you believe in karma then tomorrow they might murk me
Where the fuck was you when I was hungry nigga? Thirsty
Looking for a helping hand, miss my nigga Ivy, man, lord
Let me out so I can press record, lord
I'll puns these little boys
Mind of a maniac, we busting guns
Rah, rah rah rah rah, get that stretcher for him
We them [?] niggas, we B I G
I’m the nigga in the club all the little niggas tryna be
Fuck with my clique, you got a problem
One thing we got in common, we all got a body, bang

[Hook][x2]
