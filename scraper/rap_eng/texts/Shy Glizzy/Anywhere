[Intro]

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Stop all that talking
Cuz I don't hear y'all
A nigga play, then Im'ma knock his head off
Awww yeah
Awww yeah
Me and my niggas, we go anywhere
Over there
Or over there
Me and my niggas, we go anywhere
Awww yeah
Awww yeah
Me and my niggas, we go anywhere

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Niggas say they after me
Shooters in the back of me
Bitch I keep that sack on me
Big Glizzy got that mac on me
My bitch, ooh she blackanese
Fuck her on my balcony
Told her I'm a trapper baby
She said,"boy, you gotta be."
Calm down
Calm down
Jefe, Im a boss now
Bring my dogs to your town
And we goin' knock 'em all down
In your hood with jewels on
Hold up
Who is you homes?
Glock 40 is two-toned
That bitch welcome you home

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 30 Glizzy]
Smoking on that loud
How could I hear y'all?
We pop that Ace of Spades
You drinking Smirnoff
Red dot on his nose
He look like Rudolph
Take a trip to South Beach
Bitch take your shoes off
You niggas act like RuPaul
All my niggas make them hot niggas cool off
They say I took a loss
Well, Im a damn boss
100 bad bitches in that Aloft
A nigga play with me
I'll knock his braids off

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 3 Glizzy]
Me and my niggas, we go anywhere
Over there
And over there
Glock hold 30
And I keep on in the head
Shoot through a crowd
Before I shoot in the air
Shoot at your head
I ain't aiming at no legs
Shoot at your head
I ain't aiming at no legs
Broad day
I do'nt fucking care
So you better keep that fuck shit over there

[Hook]
