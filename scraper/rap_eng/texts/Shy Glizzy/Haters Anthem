[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
Yeah
Goddamnit man
Ayy, Young Jefe holmes
GG shit

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Twenty-four hours, bitch, I'm rolling off a molly
In twenty-four years, I never told on nobody
Oh no, rap is not my job bitch, I just do it for a hobby
Them is not no rappers, it's some gangsters in the party
And I never ever, ever let these lames get close to me
'Cause eighty percent of the time, they're never who they're supposed to be
I rock Gosha on my body, this Rick Owens on my feet
Got a ho from down in Dallas, she rock gold all on her teeth
Oh, why you worried? take a seat
Know you nervous, we can see it
We got birds, we got P's
Bitch, you know 30, you know 3
They believe anything they hear so keep your word like a G
Don't get buried in these streets, better keep your motherfuckin' heat

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I was trappin', I was trappin', remember when I didn't have it
I ain't plan it, I ain't plan it, now a nigga living lavish
Girl you the baddest, you the baddest, all them niggas wish they had it
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, make my niggas get to whackin'
I ain't have none, ain't have none, they looked at me like a dummy
It ain't funny, it ain't funny, I'm that nigga with the money
I got paper, I got power, I get pussy, get respect
You just acting like a hater 'cause you can't get none of that

[Verse 2: 30 Glizzy]
I'm a trapper, he a lease, Balenciaga to the feet
Got that draco on the seat, let's meet wherever you want to meet
Bitch, I shoot, you opps so weak, give you fifty rounds a piece
All I ask don't tell on me, this for Mar, this for YC
We don't do no scared business, you know how I'm livin'
If we start it we gon' finish, pull up with them semis
Niggas started hating when I turned my name to Glizzy
And bitches really loved me when I pulled up in the Bentley

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I was trappin', I was trappin', remember when I didn't have it
I ain't plan it, I ain't plan it, now a nigga living lavish
Girl you the baddest, you the baddest, all them niggas wish they had it
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, make my niggas get to whackin'
I ain't have none, ain't have none, they looked at me like a dummy
It ain't funny, it ain't funny, I'm that nigga with the money
I got paper, I got power, I get pussy, get respect
You just acting like a hater 'cause you can't get none of that

[Verse 3: 3 Glizzy]
I'm a real G, you be lyin' through your teeth
Got a hundred shots on me, stay on point, fuck rollin' deep
Need three thousand for a beat, these two thousand on my feet
Put this chopper to your face and wake you up right out your sleep
Couple thousand on a fur, baby, it's cold up in the streets
Diamonds dancing like a freak, I dare a nigga play with me
Used to be broke, now look at me, I know these niggas envy me
Bad bitch from Germany, girl let's go shoppin' overseas

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
I was trappin', I was trappin', remember when I didn't have it
I ain't plan it, I ain't plan it, now a nigga living lavish
Girl you the baddest, you the baddest, all them niggas wish they had it
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, make my niggas get to whackin'
I ain't have none, ain't have none, they looked at me like a dummy
It ain't funny, it ain't funny, I'm that nigga with the money
I got paper, I got power, I get pussy, get respect
You just acting like a hater 'cause you can't get none of that

[Outro]
You just acting like a hater 'cause you can't get none of that
You just acting like a hater 'cause you can't get none of that
You just acting like a hater 'cause you can't get none of that
You just acting like a hater 'cause you can't get none of that
You just acting like a hater 'cause you can't get none of that
