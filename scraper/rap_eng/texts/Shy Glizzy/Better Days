I heard somebody say life is like a battery, gotta have ya positives gotta have ya negatives (aye)

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
Better days aye
I was thugging at a young agee (uht uht uht uht uh)
Pull up on ya block and make a earth quake
I know niggas tryna murk me, i don't go no where with out my 30. bitches acting thirsty
Im just tryna see my nigga birthday

[Verse 1 : Goo Glizzy]
Niggas hate me in the worse way, and bitch and a murder case ain't the worst case
Who the fuck mad up hard times anyway? and lord knows i pray for better days And fuck you cowards tried to take my life away
Cause bitch I been thuggin since the 1st grade!
Lil nigga rep my turf just like my first name
Make me pull up on yo block and make it hurricane
No mistake , I'ma shooter you a fake

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]

[Verse 2 Shy Glizzy:]
Little bitch they call me Jefe
