Streets hottest youngin' take my jacket off, I'm burnin' up (whooh!)
Put me on anything and watch me burn it up (FIRE!)
Purple stuff, purple stuff they askin' "what's that purple stuff?" (codeine!)

Smokin' on that loud, them niggas smokin' mild (turn up!)
Glizzy Gang baby, the world is all ours (it's all ours!)
Damn I hate rappers, most of them niggas liars (liars!)
Stop, drop, and roll swagger, Glizzy got fire (FIRE!)
All in your city screamin' "I'm from DC" (get at me!)
