Verse 1:
Ima big dawg, these niggas Scooby Doo
I bought my bitch a yorki and she named him Jimmy Choo
Bad red bitch, she look like she Suwoop
I bought my bitch a bag it came with a duece-duece
Oooh she riding with me
I go on a run she hiding with me
Police snatch us up
She lying with me
She spend all the time with me
I love a bitch that grind with me
Bonnie in her, I got Clyde in me
I don't trust none of these bitches
But this one kinda different
I tell her what to do
And I love the way she listen
She love when I trap, that equal a mall mission
What good is a diamond if that bitch don't glisten
Hair down to her ass, pistol down in her bag
She down with her nigga when he down to his last
She got that type of pussy make a nigga hater mag
She got that type of pussy that'll fuck up your cash

Verse 2:
We be taking trips and shit
I show her all types of shit
We be steppin' out she looking all nice and shit (Ahhhh)
That's my new bitch, we do it all night and shit
She stay in the house while I go out and hit licks
She got her a sergeant, she don't fuck with soldiers
Tell em how we rockin' the new B and Hova
And she so fuckin' phat, look like she from Ethiopia
And she so wet, like a fuckin' super soaker
Her walk mean, her style even meaner
She fuck good, and she know how to suck a penis
I like her personality
I'm Martin, She Gina
I bet you dreamin' bout her
And you ain't even seen her
She be chillin', she don't wanna be known
She on my side, even when I'm wrong
I know she the one but I wonder how long
I feel some type of way
So I wrote this song
