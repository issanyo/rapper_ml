[Intro]
Splash, Splash, Splash

Glizzy, Glizzy Glizzy
Sos, Sos, Sosa
Damn, Drip Splash

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
(Damn), Ring Around The Rosie
All my younguns selling ossie (Trap)
And you know it's fuck the Police
Bitch pay me what you owe me (Pay a Pimp)

Ring Around the Rosie
I'm a young fucking OG
Motherfuck the police
Yea bitch pay the fee

[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]
Ring Around the Rosie
I got game like Kobe
Boy you know that ain't a Rollie
You a goddamn jabroni
What's your name?
It doesn't matter
My bitch a model, space, I call her Saturn
My youngns in the kitchen wippin' batter
I just sent a bitch to Louisiana
She gone break a trick on Bourbon
Sipping codine I'm swerving
She gone pay me for this learning
Yea I'm a teacher
Naw, really nigga I'm a preacher
You heard No Features, all my niggas creatures
All I got to do is make a phone call nigga
BLLLRRRR, They great you
Get your bitch ass disconnected
Keep your hands away from my necklace
Drippin' sauce deep down in the heart of Texas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Sauce Glizzy, Checkin' In
Bitch I just landed in Splashtown
Happy as fuck I was in them trenches]
I came up, I'm making them mad now
20 snowbunnies sippin, 'ac
I'm Used to Pulling my mask down
This right here, they ain't never seen it
Like "Money May" verses Pacquiao
Glizzy, Glizzy, I'm too official
All the real niggas fuck with me
Tommy Gun, and a Mac chicken
Give a bitch nigga buck 50
Hand me the scissors cut off some niggas
Mainly ones who grew up with me
Cause niggas told me they were stuck with me
And Bitch niggas they didn't bust with me
I put on my hood, just like I should
You niggas can't come to my neck of the woods
I got the flavor, I don't win no gators
My hoe she looking oh so macon good
Texas state hoe like to smoke on my bud
But she don't know how to roll a backwood
I'll bring your bitch over after the club
And she'll suck my dick while I count all these dubs

[Verse 3: Sosamann]
Yea bitch you gotta pay the fee
And all these fake ass niggas they so make believe
My bitch look like Maybelline and she rock Cellene
And all these fuck niggas lying, they ain't from the streets
Double Sos, Going H.A.M
In the kitchen, cooking yams
I just sold 1,000 grams
And I'm kicking shit Jackie Chan
Sosamann cooler than a fan
Stones in my Rolex do the dance
Ohh, the Margarita
Young nigga cool but I'm hot like I gotta fever
Double Sauce used to cop it by the needle
Hit the dot, tatted up like a tree
Where he at, there he go, boy I see him
Boom, Boom, man I wouldn't wanna be him
And fuck the police, yea they know me
It's the same nigga that serve dope fiends in a foreign 3
And I still sip a lot of codeine
I'M SAUCE!
