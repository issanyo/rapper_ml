I want all shooters at my funeral
Only real niggas at my funeral
It’s gonna be 10000 bitches at my funeral
Niggas gonna have them pistols at my funeral
Its gone be some superstars at my funeral
Driving in exotic cars to my funeral
Niggas that whip that brick of hard at my funeral
You might get your ass robbed at my funeral

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
They tell me stay up out the streets niggas trying to end me
This all I know I was born with this shit in me
But I don’t leave the house if I ain't got a semi
My niggas ain't pouring no remy, they don’t even drink Remy
I'm all around the globe, just me and Benny
We couting benji's bitch we bout to cop some Bentley's
Bentleys, just to be specific
Shoulda seen this bitch I had last night, she so terrific
And she know I’m a fucking menace
She look like Taraji P Henson
Bury me in all white linen
I Bet you they won’t say a pussy did it

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
I'm thinking about my granny, her name is Ann
Just lost her daughter and her son did not become a man
God damn, everybody love miss Ann
But she done been through so much pain, that she don’t give a damn
Gotta stay strong for my fam, I made myself a man
But If i don’t, who the fuck gonna take care of my fam
My uncle in a wheelchair, I’m trying to get him a lam
Momma keep talking about her bills, that's why I'm out here hustling?
I ain't stunt on these niggas like I really wanna
I ain't fuck all these bitches that I really wanna
I don’t see these bitch niggas just like Stevie Wonder
When I die all I want is…

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Might see Farrakhan at my funeral
I swear to God, you might see god at my funeral
20 mill in my will, yeah that's for my son
20 years straight, yeah bitch I had a run
Zero reserved for all my old bitches
They know I had that Rollie on in my old pictures
Straight from her auntie, you that she gon' cry a river
Drink so much that she gon' probably need a liver
Might see Fab, Young Buck, Boosie, my nigga Meek
My jeweler in this bitch he lookin' like the Sheikh
Thank God I paid all my mama’s house
Cause in my grave I don’t wanna hear my mama mouth
Try to assassinate me just like JFK
Red bones at my funeral might see Lisa Ray
Weigh it when it wet, because it weigh better
Drive the Lamb to the jects just like Mayweather
Remember me like Malcolm X or Martin Luther
Big clear in the cut [?]
Might just see some niggas I served a couple splits
Might just see some niggas I served a couple bricks
I love my momma she came walk without a cane
Lookin' to the high I see her joy and her pain
Put some M's in the trust fund for my daughter
Quarter mill with the Pyrex and the water
TIP gon' be up here, he gon' say a speech
Tell you how I loved the money, never chased the freaks
Kept sayin' the Aventador, Hoodrich to Ross
Came to pay respect you might just see Hov and B
