[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Shy Glizzy]
My name Guap, but you can call me Gwi-nop
Yeah they call him Glizzy but I call him Gwi-nop
We just livin' life, we just livin' life
Stayin' fly, gettin' high, we just livin' life
My name Glizzy, you can call me Gwi-nop
Yeah they call him Guap but I call him Gwi-nop
We just livin' life, we just livin' life
Fuckin' bitches, gettin' money, we just livin' life

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
I love to shoot some dice, I love shrimp rice
If you ain't got a million, fuck your advice
See I got young bad bitches that love to smoke with Guap
They got high, they lose they bottom, and then they lose they top
Get a suite at the lows just to smash your ho
We big stankin' so we smokin' up the whole floor
I'm just livin' life so let me call the car service
And we order bottles, we don't do the bar service
Call me Michael Phelps, I'm swimming in a nigga's bitch
I love big booties, I love big tits
Fly niggas, we belong in the sky
Fuckin' right we gettin' money
Fuckin' right we stayin' high, ah

[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Shy Glizzy]
My name Guap, but you can call me Gwi-nop
Yeah they call him Glizzy but I call him Gli-nop
We just livin' life, we just livin' life
Stayin' fly, gettin' high, we just livin' life
My name Glizzy, you can call me Gli-nop
Yeah they call him Guap but I call him Gwi-nop
We just livin' life, we just livin' life
Fuckin' bitches, gettin' money, we just livin' life

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
I'm livin' life, I might die tonight
Tried to buy my bitch a flight she said she scared of heights
Aww, it's strange what that money do
A couple hundreds make a bitch choose
These Jimmy Choos don't fit you
I'm a big dog, no shitzu
Extraordinary, flamboyant
I'm always at least a week early on these Jordans
These rap niggas so unimportant
I catch you lacking and it's extortion
Blow money at Saks, blow money at Niemans
I'm out here any given Sunday, Glizzy beamin'

[Chorus: Jose Guapo & Shy Glizzy]
My name Guap, but you can call me Gwi-nop
Yeah they call him Glizzy but I call him Gli-nop
We just livin' life, we just livin' life
Stayin' fly, gettin' high, we just livin' life
My name Glizzy, you can call me Gli-nop
Yeah they call him Guap but I call him Gwi-nop
We just livin' life, we just livin' life
Fuckin' bitches, gettin' money, we just livin' life
