[Intro]
Man y'all know I been doin' this shit for a minute, right?
Man I feel like, I feel like they sleepin' on me
La musica de Harry Fraud
Let's wake 'em up then
Yeah, Young Jefe holmes

[Verse 1]
First off, shout out to Mrs. Peaches 'cause that's where this shit begun
And I'm my brother's keeper, no I'm not the only one
Damn look at me, I blowed up, I done had a fuckin' son
He's a trust fund baby, he don't gotta hold a gun
And I don't pay no hitters, they just do that shit for fun
I heard your nigga lyin' and all my niggas on the run
Fresh young nigga rockin' that designer, yeah, uh-huh
Name a youngin had some real diamonds, wasn't none'
I love all my ahks, I know they gon' shoot they Glocks
Bitch we shootin' opps while these niggas goin' pop
You ever love someone and watch that shit just fall apart?
My granny done got sick and that shit hurt me to my heart, oh

[Chorus]
I came from shit, I was hittin' them licks
I used to be broke, but now that I'm rich
Give me a hit, yeah, yeah, give me a hit
Give me a hit, yeah, yeah, give me a hit
Respect the gangster, respect the clip
I got a lil' bitch, she strip, I tip
Give her a hit, yeah, yeah, give her a hit
Give me a hit, yeah, yeah, give me a hit

[Verse 2]
Forever I'm a savage, in these streets you can't get comfy
If she think that you average, she gon' treat you like you bummy
I'll still'll blow your brains out so lil' boy, don't be no dummy
Never said I was no angel, I'm just focused on that money
Yeah I'm from Trey-7 where them choppers get to dumpin'
Them junkies keep comin', my lil' niggas rob for nothin'
A-Town come home soon and nigga we ain't bein' humble
Stick a dick in all these snitches givin' niggas jersey numbers
How could you forget? Been a real nigga off the rip
I shop around some rappers, ask 'em Jefe keep a stick
Soon as you step outside your comfort zone, I get you hit
Yeah, I know Bloods, lil' nigga, I know Crips (Woah)

[Chorus]
I came from shit, I was hittin' them licks
I used to be broke, but now that I'm rich
Give me a hit, yeah, yeah, give me a hit
Give me a hit, yeah, yeah, give me a hit
Respect the gangster, respect the clip
I got a lil' bitch, she strip, I tip
Give her a hit, yeah, yeah, give her a hit
Give me a hit, yeah, yeah, give me a hit
