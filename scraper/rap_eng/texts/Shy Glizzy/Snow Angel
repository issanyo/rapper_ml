[Intro]
Nito

[Verse 1]
I'm stressed the fuck out, man I really need a vacay
First time on a PJ, aw shit nigga, mayday
He a hundred 20 pounds, how the fuck he shoot that AK?
Ill shoot a nigga down, man I put that shit on day day
Tatted Omert√† on my neck, I dont fuck with rats
Scar on my chest, fuck bitches you can blame my ex
I wanna marry Nicki too, I might just sign with We The Best
You 'ont got them bricks do you? Nah I'm just tryna finesse
When I was 13 I had a best friend named Pedro
Pedro he the plug now, he get it by the case load
He gone keep 'em coming long as there ain't no delay, yo
All these niggas round me shooters they go when I say wo

[Chorus]
Snow Angel
I'm so high that I can make a snow angel
Snow Angel
Its a cold world, I feel like a snow angel

[Verse 2]
I think I seen my enemy the other day
He seen me, turnt around and went the other way
I think I seen my old ho the other day
She said she want me back it ain't no other way
My cousin got smoked yesterday, put bullets in his Chevrolet
Everywhere even in his face, bang, bang, Glizzy Baby
And I been getting money, don't know what they doin
I made a snow angel from all that salt they throwin
Im gonna go buy a brick in the morning
And if you ain't hittin you needa join it
Its Glizzy Baby, Glizzy Gang, baby
Niggas caught me lackin, they ain't have no aim baby
Im the man now and im bout to cop a Range, baby
I know the man now and he got cocaine, baby
So much damn Coke that I can build a snow angel
Rest In Peace Grisilda Blanco, she a snow angel

[Chorus]
Snow Angel
I'm so high that I can make a snow angel
Snow Angel
Its a cold world, I feel like a snow angel
