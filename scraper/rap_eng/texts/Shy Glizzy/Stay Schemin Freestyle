[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
I got injured in December, Fucked up my whole winter
I lost too many niggas, Thank god I was a winner(fire)
Alot of niggas hungry waiting on me for their dinner
Glizzy got the nuggets and I ain't talking about Denver(ahh)
I'm in a whole lotta pain(ahh), Doctor told me I ain't gonna never be the same(fuck it)
I Know I Needed a change, But I ain't think it was gonna happen this strange
A Nigga put that knife up in mane(ahh)
Learn this, fuck everything except for glizzy gang(fucker)
Diagnosed with Pancreatitis damn(ahh), I can't never ever drink champagne(ahh)
You can't even imagine how I feel, I wish a nigga would tell me to chill(I wish he would)
I'm going hard I put that on my last my meal(yeah)
I wanna be a millionaire and I will
Why every rapper in the game think he real(huh)
Like who you shoot, Who you rob, Who you kill(nobody)
If I gotta bitch when I get a deal,We getting prenups I ain't Kobe or Shaquille(swoosh)
I wonder did allah hear me when I pray(did you)
He had to that's the reason I'm here today(thank you)
I could've called up my drummers for the parade(badararara)
Forreal all I got is my nigga Bapes
The sun shining these niggas looking for shade(ahh)
Streets Hottest Youngin got more heat than D-wade(fire)
M.I.G.G. for life ain't no escape(for life)
If you don't tattoo the logo nigga you fake(ahh)
My niggas in for the their guns no T.I.'s
We True to our religion nigga no Levi's(ahh)
Forever 37 even after I die, Them the only niggas that I know gonna ride
Everybody ain't going with me so why lie
But if you hugging the alley we going worldwide(ahh)
I'll Ride For My Niggas Dog, I'll Ride For My Niggas
