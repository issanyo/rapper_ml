[Intro]
I'm the topic, I know that they watching
I bring the strip club to me, all these bands in my pocket
(Fam, that's like me asking you, "should I pull up on your bitch in a drop top six?" She gon' get in!)


[Hook: Lil Mouse]
I'm the topic, I know that they watching
I bring the strip club to me, all these bands in my pocket
I know they jocking, I ball like The Rockets
Ain't with nobody, riding around in a 'Rari
I bring the strip club to me, I bring the strip club to me
We throwing money out the Mase', bring the strip club to me
I bring the strip club to me, I bring the strip club to me
I put a pole in the condo, look like a strip club to me

[Verse 1: Lil Mouse]
I put a pole in the condo, look like a strip club to me
I'm throwing money at that foreign, all my belt Louie V
I don't wear Prada shoes, Balenciaga on my feet
I'm the topic, I'm number one, I know they see me
I'm always hopping out that foreign, black and white, I get paper
I pull up on a black [?] flexing, I know that he hating
I know he ain't getting money, all his clothes is fugazi
I be running through this money, ain't no time to be wasting
I'm at first place in this game, but I know we ain't racing
Me and [?] in that foreign, she say that we amazing
I pull off in that drop top six like I'm racing
I know she think I'm awesome, I'm stacking these Franklins

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Bitch I, bitch I pull up in that Bentley GT
With two super freaks and it just be me and three
Then I hit 'em up like bring the strip club to me
I got hella bands, blow your advance in a week
Jefe, I'm the boss, you could ask all my dawgs
If you step to me wrong then they gon' break you off
She see me in that Maybach, ask me do I know Ross
Took her to my loft, she took everything off
These are not no Chucks, these are 2000 bucks
Scuba-thought my D, learn to walk in 'em, blow
You see me with them cops, know I'm sipping on mud
Motherfuck your club, bitch, I'm running it up

[Hook]
