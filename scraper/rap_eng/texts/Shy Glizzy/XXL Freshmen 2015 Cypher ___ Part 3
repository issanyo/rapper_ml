[Verse 1: DeJ Loaf]
Don't give a fuck if they put ten million on you
I'mma still come out like a villain on you
I ain't have no co-signs or no big homies
I had to make my own plays, call blitz on 'em
I don't know, it's just my voice and my style
I don't know, I just appeal to the crowd
Cold heart, making cold decisions
When they told me that I couldn't, man, I went out and did it
I didn't,  stop, not once 'til I finished
I did it all by myself, man, God is my witness
Said I can't be broke, I rather be in prison
This shit ain't no joke, why these niggas pretending
Know niggas locked up, who ain't seen they children
I say, life just ain't fair, man this shit is a gimmick
That's why, I don't follow polls, I just follow my spirit
Bitch I do what I wanna, living life, no religion
I say my style so crazy, I don't know where I get it
And stop asking me the prices like you gon' go and get it
I just speak on real shit and real niggas fuck with me
Aye, that's all it is
I say, I'm freshman feeling like a junior
Cause all these bitches they my sons, yeah, they my jr's nigga
I swear, I can't be fucked with
I can't be fucked with
I can't be fucked with
I can't be fucked with

Pops deceased in '93 so shout out to Ma Dukes
Hit the lean with corn syrup, if they buy it they fools
Niggas buy they bitch a bag before they buy 'em a tool
Look it, I'm that dude, I'm not lying to you
I'm doing fine and you
Can't say the same about them other dudes
I pull moves and bust the pot down with some dirty dudes
Until I found out they was ratting down on other dudes
And see that's just against the hustler rules
That's what we don't do, that's what I won't do
Don't ever let a bitch nigga feel comfortable
He get a name he act like he was never was under you
GG, jefe
