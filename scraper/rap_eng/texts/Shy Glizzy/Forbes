I just copped a foreign used to ride Accords
I just shopped at stores you cannot afford

That's that rich nigga shit I'm try'na make the Forbes
Rich nigga shit I'm try'na make the Forbes
Fuck that rich nigga shit I'm try'na make the Forbes

[Verse 1: Bricc Baby]
Heard you copped that Honda, I be riding Bentley
And I heard you niggas try to ride me, trigger finger itching
Make that probably busting down a brick, whip it in the kitchen
Pour a four of lean, in the trunk, now a nigga sip hold up
Try'na make the Forbes, try'na make the Forbes
Check my brand new crib, got too many floors got too many floors
I'ma take that bitch, just like Diddy, fuck her, I be sure
Bet that, 41 minute, Presidential cost me 40
Got that bitch, eating sushimi, I've been caught, with that crispy thing
Try to ride me, I be busting, yeah my nigga busting
Yeah we ride around with that German, or that fucking Russian
M4, short mother fucker, leave a nigga bloody

[Verse 2: Vee Tha Rula]
Suit case full of big dollars, I'ma die like I'm Big Poppa
Big dog make a bitch holler, black power get a man down here
Fuck a dream I just had to do it, fish tank with a barracuda
I was grinding eating ramen noodles, now I'm cooler than a fucking cooler
Big crib with the vines nigga, I'ma put this shit on vine nigga
Used to be a pine flipper, now I'm a sparkling wine sipper
Gotta have the gas in a big old bag and my bitch for a big old ass
I smash in the pockets with the pool stick, back shots better duck with the full clip

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
You can take a couple shots to your 4/5
Up late night think it's about 4:10
It's a mother fucking party hear the cork pop
I'm with three of my niggas bring four friends
Young nigga had a dream of the Forbes list now a nigga's pockets so heavy need a fork lift
It was over when I signed to the corporates now I smoke break in the Porsche while you still sitting on porches
