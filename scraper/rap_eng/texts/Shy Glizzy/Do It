[Verse 2 : Danny Seth]
I could switch it tell you how I’m about to kill it
Man I’m so over the gold I’m on my sterling silver
Me and Glizzy, sipping fizzy, I isn’t feeling sober
Tell that bitch to bend it, Jay Z, man I’m talking Hova
Man I’m talking Hova, got some rocky in my nose-a
And I only fuck my side bitch if my house like where I wear my loafers
Nerd boy the way I'm posing
Jewish with the money, brother call me Moses
She could part the seas, so oh so good at blowing
But she isn’t sucking, I ain’t fucking man she gotta know this
I rep my city, no if and buts about it
Like a bezel man I keep my round me

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
This Is how you do it (X10)
