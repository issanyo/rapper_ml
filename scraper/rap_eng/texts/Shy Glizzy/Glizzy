[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
I'm Shy, I'm Glizzy
I'm Shy, I'm Glizzy
I'm Shy, my jewelry's glistenin'
My jewelry's gli-gli-
It's Glizzy, it's Glizzy
My jewelry's fucking glistenin'
Look at it bitch, we got jewelry it's glistenin'
Nigga's play with Thug, they ass gon' come up missin'
Niggas play with Shy, Shy, they ass goin' come up missin'
Niggas play with MPA, they come up missin'
They come up missing, they come up missin'

Diamonds are forever

[Verse 1: Peewee Longway]
Play bout mine, my niggas goin' take your style
My niggas goin take your life
Who give a fuck who end up dyin'?
I'm Shy, I'm Shy
Don't ask me why my diamonds go bIing, bling, blow
Heard Longway talking in the crowd
Dont speak no Englo, bitch I'm on molly!
Boot up, boot up, boot up, boot up, boot up
Oh, oh, kept a back, bust, bust
I'm gon' bust, she gon' bust, we gon' bust
Bust, bust, bust, bust, bust

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
My troot is on boots!
They hawk yo' bitch down and she boost through the roof
Im flying to D.C and they shoot me the boot
Passed out so many I leave scene with a coupe
My diamonds are glistening, ain't none of them missing
I catch yo bitches and they pussy, no kitten
They kinda like me so I know that they dissin'
I catch them in the club, and water their melon

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
I'm Shy, I'm Glizzy
I'm Shy, I'm Glizzy
I'm Shy, my jewelry's glistenin'
My jewelry's gli-gli-
It's Glizzy, it's Glizzy
My jewelry's fucking glistenin'
Look at it bitch, we got jewelry it's glistenin'
Nigga's play with Thug, they ass gon' come up missin'
Niggas play with Shy, Shy, they ass goin' come up missin'
Niggas play with MPA, they come up missin'
They come up missing, they come up missin'

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy]
Ok I'm leanin' like a kick-stand
I shoot my pistol like a Piston
Young Jefe, I do not talk to assistants
My jewelry's Glizzy, my fuckin' jewelry's glistening
Ran shotgun with Thugger
Leave your ass front cover
New bitch straight from Russia
Dirty bitch, I ain't using no rubber
Fuckin' with Peewee Longway, Hefner
Fuckin' with Peewee Longway, Hefner
*Brrt,* leave a message
A-choo, God bless you

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Ooh, she want crispy, and I beat like "ooh"
I ain't Steve Wonder, but she sing the blues!
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Young Thugger, Peewee Longway, Shy Glizzy them dudes!

[Chorus: Peewee Longway]
I'm Shy, I'm Glizzy
I'm Shy, I'm Glizzy
I'm Shy, my jewelry's glistenin'
My jewelry's gli-gli-
It's Glizzy, it's Glizzy
My jewelry's fucking glistenin'
Look at it bitch, we got jewelry it's glistenin'
Nigga's play with Thug, they ass gon' come up missin'
Niggas play with Shy, Shy, they ass goin' come up missin'
Niggas play with MPA, they come up missin'
They come up missing, they come up missin'
