Yeah what up yo
This is the rza aka buddah zig zag in tha law
I wanna run the ultima tical
The prequel
Starring wu tang brotha numbah 1
The m-e-t-h-o-you-n
Aka johnny blaze
Aka hot nicks the iron lung
Big john studd johnny storm
Check it out yo
Our brother meth is about to take you on some wuddah
And the unswarn chambers of the wu tang universe
So I want all my nizza wit all my wizards
Big big bag of rizza ticuriny and blizzards
And sit back as johnny blaze takes you on a ride to the upper side
Piece of the wu tang family
Ten years strong forty for your albums sold
Platinumb gold and the sagas continue

(johnny blaze)
