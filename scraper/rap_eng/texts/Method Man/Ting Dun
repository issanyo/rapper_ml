[Verse 1: Ocean Wisdom]
Dun dun dun dun
Diggity dun dun
The bigger the breda the harder the hitter
The harder the punch you thump
The fact of the matter I'm bigger and badder
I couldn't be unsung(?)
I beg all these rappers infesting their addicts
And stealing your money sprung
Dun dun dun dippin' out of that
Dun little man ting
I can't be Wiz could know that that shit
If I'm on a mission tryna be the king
That's kinda dumb
Dun diggin in a rut
Tryna see if something shinier than what I'm diggin' with
Disciplinin' and I vision it
Bigger fish they wanna mirror it
I'm not a copycat
But the classmates wan' copy man
I act and camouflage a little bit
I feel a little violated if I'm honest
And a nigga lookin' at me in the wrong way
Is going one way
I'm on a runway
I'm on a plane now
I'm going somewhere
They wanna level with me
That's someday
I'm on big big big business
Come with the pen and pad
They couldn't know that this lit man and little man
Dem mans a little fish
I'm kinda oceanic
Did you get my drift?
Dem on a dep dep dep goose
Struttin' down the high street in a noose
Somethin' that's my wave I recoup
What I spend I ain't really tryna lose
Nothin' I'm dun

[Hook: Ocean Wisdom]
Ay you know what? The whole ting dun
Ain't lying fam the whole ting dun
Said the whole ting dun
(Meth: dun dun dun dun diggity dun dun)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
It's like, dun, dun dun
Diggity dun dun
Look at the thumb
Look at the gun
Look at the run
Back of the tracks, uh
Back in the basement
Back in the raps
Back in the trap
Packin' a mac in the back of the Ac'
What happened to rap?
Can happen to you I just happen to rap
And this where it's happening at
Where rapping is back
I'm asking what happened to that?
Too many flashin the vac(?)
Two and they're flasher than racks
Two in your back
I'm doing ya two and a half cause ya'll wasn't doing the math
This algorithm
Just a fraction I'm so efficient
While in addition
I'm subtracting they whole division
With precision
Written by yours truly
Who he?
Old schooly
Freshmen do not move me (Oo-wee)
Nothing to prove
When you ain't got nothin', nothin' to lose
You fools, you will be nothin' but food
Cause I ain't got nothin' to do
Methods the dude
The room is lit, I'm setting the mood
Setting the rude
Turn a vegan to a vegetable

[Hook: Ocean Wisdom]
Ay you know what? The whole ting dun
Ain't lying fam the whole ting dun
Said the whole ting dun
(Meth: dun dun dun dun diggity dun dun)

[Verse 3, Ocean Wisdom]
Ay, trappin' and rackin' up
Stashin' a atticore(?)
Shackles in Attica
As if I as if I
Back in the traf and dem fatty(?)
I rap-at-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Don’t interrupt man
You nowhere near bad enough
Tryna catch up with that
Swagger they sighing now(?)
Man how should (?)
With a quality camera
Puffin' a a-na-na
It’s mano-e-mano
Ain’t nobody better
Mi llamo the Swagga Don
I got the energy
Enemy better be
Readily ready for all of the badder man
I, me and myself and I
Look how I multiply
Look at the rising tide
Look at them try to find
Talking behind the eye
And I rap attack I’m rap attackin' em
Pick a pattern I will batter them
Ineffective with your chatterin'
Inefficient with your stamina
In denial, they should pack it in
Inappropriately natterin'
Independently embarrassin'
Introverted yet so arrogant
It’s apparent you ain’t managin'
It’s apparent you are stammerin'
It’s apparent you are panickin'
It’s apparent you are parrotin'
It’s apparent you in pain
I never saw such a mug in my life and I don’t wanna see you again
The M and the E and the T and the H
And the O and the D are the same
So bring it to Wizzy or Meth on the track and we chalkin' the frame in the pane
The ting dun

[Hook: Ocean Wisdom]
Ay you know what? The whole ting dun
Ain't lying fam the whole ting dun
Said the whole ting dun
(Meth: dun dun dun dun diggity dun dun)
