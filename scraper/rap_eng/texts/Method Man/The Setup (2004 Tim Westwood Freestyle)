[Verse 1: Method Man]
Yes I'm in the place for sure!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Til crime pays up
John Blaze up
I'm hella hot
Get that weight up
This nigga straight up
Like twelve o' clock
[?] up
I mixed it with [?]
To blow the cake up
Bet on Jacob
Might wake up
Gagged and taped up
It's us
Older than dirt
We fart dust
Plus we can't get enough of this
In God we trust
That's big bucks
I drive a big-ass truck
That's just big enough for a big-ass butt
Errday, (everyday) follow my lead
And errday, (everyday) I keep weed
Like all that I need is Mary J
Want mo' pay
Gimme mo' chips than Frito-Lay
So any thoughts of sinking my ship is D.O.A
That's right family, understand me?
I boombayeh where you lay, family
Like Miami, be M.I.A
Now how high?
So high that I can kiss the sky
Who wanna (kiss) be the next ass that's kissed goodbye?
Speaking my piece, before ya fix ya lips to try
I'm hotter than greese
And I got bigger fish to fry
In this cold world, no tellin' who's supplying the heat
Who put niggas on Elm Street and hope they die in they sleep?
I got my sword on, not a average sendin' me in
What oxymorons, this is where your ending begin
That's just a method
If it ain't, I ain't saying it is
Some call me father like a priest, but I ain't playin' with kids
Pass the dutch, my blood pressure that's what's up
And that shit that y'all was writing all day...
That's my nuts
Stay focused, stay in ya lane
I swing a hook like Candyman
If ya sayin' my name
Ain't nuthin' change

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Ya know why?
Cause that tough talk 'ill get ya nowhere fast
Champagne bottled if ya go there smash
Hits after midnight and still cash rule
I'm lovin' Cinderella and her one glass shoe
I'm is what I'm is and that's all that I'm is
I've been spoiled, my kids called it like it is
Watch out now, who buyed his milk as a cow?
And his fat farm come with a hoe and a plow
That leave you sleepy
Defeat me, how?
You greasy, yo' bitch got a eye on her knee
They call her "Kneesee"
Ten years and counting
It's been me and these two balls now
And we ain't thinking bout bouncing
The show ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
'Til then, I'll see more ass than a fat lady('s) jeans
Folks wanna picture me broke, watch the birdie
Then let's get dirty like Westwood and Jersey
Come on
