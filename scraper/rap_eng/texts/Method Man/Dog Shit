[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
She blew in like calm breeze
Tall brown skin her, weave like palm trees
I went coconuts, dip my Dunkin' between your Donut
Don't want it if it ain't no slut, bitch
Fathership touch ground like fly on soup
Don't invite me I tear the fuck down
White boys cut my toupee
Seventh day rester, or screenplay
I slump MC slay, it ain't nothin' to bust ass
Bullet him, get him fast
Bitch I don't break out, blast to the next rash
The dog piss on MCs like trees
Got meals but still grill that old good welfare cheese

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]

[Verse 2 - Ol Dirty Bastard]
Shame on a nuh, who tried to step tuh
The Ol' Dirty Bas, put my foot up your uhh
Bitch, you walk around with your bra too tight
It's alright, you still gon' get fucked tonight
Hoooooo (Method Man: stankin' ass hoes)
You're the type of bitch don't appreciate shit
Never had shit, so you won't be shit
That pussy there, couldn't satisfy a hair
On my body, treat me like a lolli and slob me down
Doo Doo Brown!
Tossed salad, oh you in some shit now
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out
Here comes Rover, sniffin' at your ass
But pardon me bitch, as I shit on your grass
That means ho, you been shitted on
I'm not the first dog that's shitted on your lawn

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
