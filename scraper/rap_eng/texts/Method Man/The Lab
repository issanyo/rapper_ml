[Intro: Spank]
Yeah, oh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Spank]
We comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Bitch, we comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
We comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Bitch, we comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Part two

[Verse 1: Spank]
We got the city on smash, the game is really on smash
I set up shop with the shot, and got to gettin' this cash
I put the work in the pot and let it go
Anybody and they momma who coppin' already know
Ike love, I'm in the city, I'm dolo
From New Yitty, it's YOLO
Keep it under the Polo, them people takin' them photos
Me and Methical hit the work, extra got the Lexus out
Really runnin' wild, hit the exits with them weapons out
Rain on them bitches
I take the train with some bitches who keep it tucked in they pussy
A fair exchange when we hit'cha
Put the frame in the picture
No picture frames in my circle
Niggas goin' in early like they done gave 'em a curfew
Said, run for the money, run for it
You either gonna slump for the money, slump for it
I got a little pretty bitch about to come for it
And if you try to come for her, she gon' dump for it, nigga

[Chorus: Spank]
We comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Bitch, we comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
We comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Bitch, we comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Part two

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I got blunts in a pocket, a half a zip in my sock
Got rappers eatin' my garbage like I ain't spit in the pot
We put the lid to your top and let it blow
Anybody from the Island that's poppin' already know
Meth Lab and we back with them cookers
I'm out the door with the cook-up
The quiet life and I keep it private, don't like it, then pull-up
It's like whatever now
Tighter then them fits that they be wearin' now
Methidcal, they tryna touch the kid? You some pedophiles
Who is you kiddin'? See, I ain't losin', I'm winnin'
I'm the coop with a pigeon, don't care 'bout who we offendin'
A lot of you is pretendin', I mean the proof in the puddin'
I'm at the stove in your kitchen, see, that's the proof that I'm cookin'
Me and Spank keep it pushin' and while the pushin' is good
I'm tryna get me some cookies, the kind you put in a wood
See, I ain't stressin' you rookies like I should
I'm just sayin', ain't no place for no rookies in my hood
And-

[Chorus: Spank]
We comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Bitch, we comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
We comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Bitch, we comin' from The Meth Lab, The Meth Lab
Part two
Uh
