[Hook: Amy Schumer] x3
Milk, milk, lemonade
Milk, milk, lemonade
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the corner, fudge is made

[Verse 1: Amy Schumer]
I used to think that my tits was where it's at
Used to be concerned that my booty was too fat
But now I know the truth and that worry has been shot
Big booty's what they want and big booty's what I got

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Amber Rose]
Tits are old news if you know what I mean
All the guys love my fudge machine
Look me in the eye
Get your face in, don't be shy
You say you don't like asses
Cause I fart and break your glasses

[Bridge: Amy Schumer]
Turd cutter
Loaf pitcher
Dookie maker
Fudge machine
Cheektastic
Booty mastiff
Giant tuchus
Fudge machine

[Verse 3: Amy Schumer]
On my booty empire, the sun never set
Take a shot, yeah, nothin' but net
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the corner, fudge is made
I'm gonna make you scream and shout
For the part of my body where poo comes out

[Refrain: Amy Schumer]
This is where my poo comes out (x4)
Talkin' 'bout my fudge machine (x4)

[Verse 4: Method Man]
That's right, ladies
Ain't nothing better than a big, beautiful sexy booty
But bottom line, no matter how find a behind
You better call that onion what it really is
That's just a fudge machine
Turn up

[Hook]

[Refrain 2: Amy Schumer]
This is where her poo comes out
This is where your poo comes out
This is where their poo comes out
This is where our poo comes out

[Refrain 3: Amy Schumer] x2
This is what you think is hot
This is what you think is hot
This is what you think is hot
Talkin bout my fudge machine

[Outro: Method Man]
It's where your poo comes out
