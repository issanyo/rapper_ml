[Hook: Hanz On] * 2
Ayo I'm done committing crimes homey (I'm a star)
All I wanna do is shine homey (from afar)
Get this money till we tired homey (picture that)
I'll retire when we tired homey (bring it back)

[Verse: Method Man]
Uh
What I write, fatality type
I keep it real but ya'll still reality bites
Go ahead and call it what ya'll like
Just get my salary right
I could tell em their paper thin but that would be lie
Tell a Judas to never cross me coz that would be Christ
We bout gettin millions with ice, yep that would be nice
I ain't picturing peas with rice, what you see is the price
Word to S.P. with rights and a gangsta's lean
That's promethazine and Sprite
Go and live a day in the life
Lose your life for you ends
You could spend a day if you like
That's a privilege, you see it like everyday if you white
Smoke trees like all I need is mary j. in a life
Boy please, pardon me it's like a fart in the breeze
That's a benchmark, some players will never start in the league
Look at me, real MC gotta start and appease
Plus my maroon fives make it harder to breathe
