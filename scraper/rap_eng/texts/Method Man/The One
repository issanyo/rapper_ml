[Intro: Method Man]
Yeah yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah, fuck yeah

[Verse 1: Method Man]
First hit it like a virgin
First give you my last name
First sniff got you open
First taste, you going insane
First hit it like a virgin
First give you my last name
First sniff got you open
First taste, you going insane

[Chorus: Method Man]
If you never felt nothing like this
Could you relate?
I can tell by the look on your face
It's your first taste

[Verse 2: Method Man]
First of all the squad is money come first mob
Fell face first in the game and got me my first scar
First to ride like a friend on his first nod
First to get fired, the first day on his first job
But first things first, you're messing with the worst baby
Give me the presidental suite and the first lady
I make the first verse crazy, purposely great
Sixteen bars, three verses, my first forty-eight

[Chorus: Triggerfinger]
This is the one
The race is on
Before the taste is gone
This is the one
The one and only, first
And then you let it run
This is the one
The race is on
Before the taste is gone
This is the one
The one and only, first
And then you let it run

[Chorus: Method Man]
If you never felt nothing like this
Could you relate?
I can tell by the look on your face
It's your first taste

[Verse 3]
Be the first to front, you be the first to get jumped like a bone thug
Check me like every first of the month
I box'em in like just to be the first to punch
Second thought lock'em in like somebody in the trunk
First amendment is the freedom of speech
Too many rappers sell the freedom for cheap
The first taste, homey, on cloud nine
I ain't feeling my feet, I play to win
I ain't feeling defeat, I'm first place homey

[Chorus: Triggerfinger]
This is the one
The race is on
Before the taste is gone
This is the one
The one and only, first
And then you let it run
This is the one
The race is on
Before the taste is gone
This is the one
The one and only, first
And then you let it run

[Chorus: Method Man]
If you never felt nothing like this
Could you relate?
I can tell by the look on your face
It's your first taste

[Bridge: Method Man & Triggerfinger]
Hit it like a virgin
Give you my last name
The first you taste
First to come
You let it stick or you let it run
The first you taste
First to come
You let it stick or you let it run
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, fuck yeah

[Chorus: Method Man]
If you never felt nothing like this
Could you relate?
I can tell by the look on your face
It's your first taste

[Chorus: Triggerfinger]
This is the one
The race is on
Before the taste is gone
The one and only, first
And then you let it run
This is the one
The race is on
Before the taste is gone
The one and only, first
And then you let it run

[Chorus: Mathod Man]
If you never felt nothing like this
Could you relate?
I can tell by the look on your face
It's your first taste

[Outro: Triggerfinger]
I take the first taste
I take the first taste
