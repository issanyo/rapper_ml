[Intro: Method Man]
You know it, just like before, muthafucka
It ain't never went no where, we still drink forties
Still got niggas that'll whip that ass for me, come on
The real way... yeah... another Rockwilder joint
Up in your muthafuckin' mouth, nigga...
Come on... put my fucking dicks in they mouth
I ain't playing with ya'll niggas, come on, come on
Come on, God damn, hit with the... with my what?
God damn, with the what? Huh, muthafucka, mutha -- yo, yo

[Method Man]
I'm anti-everything, ya'll niggas is for
Eat up everything on my plate, then eat yours
Ain't got no table manners, I disrespect the law
Off that 99 bananas, disconnect a jaw
Throw your muthafucking hands up, never comb my hair
Never pull my pants up, I keep it cracking
For the whole borough of Staten
Got to keep it ugly, bloody sanitary napkins
Catch me on the 14th of February, actin'
Like I got no love for this whole world, smashing
Anybody asking, no questions, and answer
Pop another X for the extravaganza
Bong bong, can't nobody fuck around with John John
Take you rappers on and your man with them pom-pom
From Vietnam, from the phenom, forever mo', back like before
You see my Clan, see my M.O, act like you know

[Hook: Method Man]
Who I'm is, at your crib, with his bad ass kids
Who I'm is, fuck ya'll nigs, we get down like this
Who I'm is, the phenom, them niggas can't live
Who I'm is, we ain't got shit, something got to give
Watch ya step, kid (huh), watch ya step, kid (muthafucka)
Watch ya step, kid, watch ya step, kid (come on)
Watch ya step, kid (yeah yeah), watch ya step, kid (yo yo)
Watch ya step, kid, watch ya step, kid (cook a bag of 'dro)

[Method Man]
My middle name Mud, dirty water flow
Leave a ring around the tub, grimy mothafuck
Kid, I don't give a what, if you feel like I feel
Throw that third finger up to the sky like such
Follow this, funky like some staircase piss
Take a wish, breeze you when your track run sniff
Off the snow, that's the only way I can grow
We them kids in the back, yelling "wack", at the show
Looky here, I'm steppin' to the game, like it's my rookie year
Home court advantage, two blunts, one beer
Beware, I'm from a place, where
They pop for that CREAM and that bling bling, yeah
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't mothafucking care
So react like I'm strapped, keep your hands in the air
Pain is the game, and it's full contact
I ain't got to say my name, let the whole world ask

[Hook]

[Method Man]
Ayo, Rockwilder, this beat is off the dog collar
Hit Ja Rule at D36 tell him to holla
At your nigga, murderous flow that I deliver
Consider this M.C.'s last chance to reconsider
Their future, cuz ain't no future in fronting
My crew need something cuz we ain't used to nothing
The hardest M.C.'s rock the hardest production
Dick stay hard all day like when we fucking
Meth with the F.C., my disk's in the decks
Like the clip in the tech, and we risking your neck
If you fixing to flex, come in, pour out some liquor
For your dead homey, ya'll still acting like ya'll know me

[Hook]
