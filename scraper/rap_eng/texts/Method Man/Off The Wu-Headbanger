[Intro: Method Man]
I would kill some fucking body
The mad stola, the mad stola
(Who? Russel who?)
Ha ha, nah let me stop
Word up this is a Def Jam production (Sandman)
Featuring, Johnny Blaze word up
Another Sandman joint, dirtman on the track
Flip the script, script the flip
Check the steez (believe that)
Check it out now, check it check it out

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I get drunk off of cheap wine and hold frontline
Niggas wanna front, fine, fuck with me and mine
Rain on your sunshine
Swine niggas come as hard as a pork rind
Can you dig it, only five percent live it
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it
Peep the Stallion, half of y'all need to quit it
Frontin' hard and be soft as a cotton knitted
No balls at all, if you do son then get with it
Razor sharp in my jaw bone I might spit
I'm dealin with it on a everyday basis
Roam where it get cold at and stack glaciers
In the zone it's Tical once again stoned
Throw your hands in the air and puff a Meth bone
Did you ever get the feeling for that phat shit?
Something different from that R&B and rap shit?
Well here it come, from the gums of the one, I amaze 'em
Fire in the sky, peep me now, Johnny Blaze 'em, check it
My mind's on the rhyme, ain't a damn thing funny
Gettin' money, Blaze represent, kills the fraudulent
Fucker giving me the grill
Nowadays everybody trying to keep it real
4th Disciple, hit me with that 30/30 rifle
Beats from the streets mega-trifle
Rap gymnastics, flipping from the cradle to the casket
Take another pull, fantastic
It's the Method not the Plastic, Man
Coming down like hourglass sand, check the tactic
Flow P.L.O., P.L.O. now you know
The ultimate and rhyme legitting
Peep the counterfeitten or get snake bitten
Filled up with deadly venom, Johnny Blaze get up in 'em
Play 'em out like Lee denim, can you dig it
Can a brother eat, can I live it
Gets no deeper, whoever slipping get the sleeper
Hold, faces of death, bodies cold
On some Evil Dead part 2, swallow your soul
Yeah, and it don't stop
The body body body body rock, yeah
Hip hop, we sat out in the dark (in the dark)
We used to do it out in the park (Where that?)
Hill Avenue, ain't a damn thing new
Stay true to my Clan, I'm a family man
Loyalty brought me royalties
To the Gods I give my heart and soul totally
It's a bond can't be broken, that's my life
I'mma die if I think twice, I'm not jokin
To the essence if I'm half stepping
Politician use the system, as lethal weapons
When we slip up, lethal injection
Hah, everyday life's a lesson
I take my spot in the lower class section

[Outro: Method Man]
Johnny Blaze, 9-5 to the 9-6
Word up, keep it moving
