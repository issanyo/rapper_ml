[Verse 1: LL Cool J, Redman & Method Man]
Get the fuck out of here, I'm LL Cool
Soakin' wet with bad bitches in the indoor pool
Yo what am I, an animal?
'Cause I bagged your's too
One bad mooley, nigga you can't school me
I'm the G.O.A.T., what I wrote cause fire and smoke
To think I started on the choir singin' solo for the pope
Tell your mama please, get up off her knees
You can't wear yellow spandex with a ass like cottage cheese
Open toed shoes, feet smell like collard greens
Toes Kriss Krossed like she on J. Dupri's team
Bunyon you're sittin' up like beach balls in the sand plus
A mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand
Who the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired
Now I'm lookin' for some washed up rapper that I can hire
You know some old school nigga with a bit of attitude
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food
So what I scratch my nuts, HOW THE FUCK IS THAT RUDE?
For soul glowin, afro pickin'
S-curl hatin', Jamaican rum sippin'
Kid I'll burp on your girl buttcheeks
'Cause honey had my nuts like two red beets
I'm bananas, out of my fuckin mind they won't let me back in
'Cause I was down before the hype like Dusty Rhodes and Bob Backlund
Bruno Samartino, Stan Staziak
Now The Rock and Stone Cold are my favorite maniacs
The top rooster pluckin', chickens when Iâ€™m cluckin'
WWF stands for When and Where we Fuckin

[Chorus: LL Cool J]
Fuhgidabowdit
Yo kid
Fuhgidabowdit
Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, ey, Fuhgidabowdit
Ey, ey, Fuhgidabowdit
Eh, Fuhgidabowdit

[Verse 2: Redman, LL Cool J & Method Man]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I'm like Menace II Society
I roll through the drive-thru like Kane
Jack you for the cheeseburgers and chicken wings, and Daytons too
See my boys down the ride crack patience too
Bricks, walk around, snorkel down
Macaroni and cheese Timbs broke out the orphan house
Transportin out, the poison in 'em
Box 'em up in the aisle with the frozen dinners
And them niggas that ran...
My goal's to get 'em
With the heat seekin' flow with, fo' antennas
Doc's Da Name, that's why y'all fuck with me
I'm pocket change, the bums don't fuck with D
Objective in 'em, Carlo inspection sticka
Check the pen, I write like a X was in 'em
Teeth grittin', I brawl with a major league mitten
Where the stash at, punk?
Yo, yo, and he takin me with him

[Chorus: Redman]
Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, Fuhgidabowdit
Ayo nigga, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, yo, yo, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo dog, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo you heard, Fuhgidabowdit
Ayo you hear me, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo nigga, Fuhgidabowdit

[Verse 3: Method Man & Redman]
Yo, this be a Cool J function, music get my blood pumpin'
Down for whatever, which usually means I'm up to somethin'
Who owe me somethin', them niggas in the back frontin'
They rockin' cuffs and, put the eight up, repercussion
You know my name, so there's no need for introduction
I'm Mr. Done it all, so none of y'all can do me nothing
Bitch I'm grown, puffin on that one and bone
Bet me and Queen Bee be swingin' 'til the honey come
Backs get blown, trash get thrown
In headlocks, from this view, I'm fuckin Star Jones
I'm red hot just like candy, in '95 won the Grammy
Yo, he use it as an ashtray now
Niggas can't stand or understand me, yeah
Either or, funky headhunter wild comanchees with shitty draws
What's that shit, what shit, that shit on your lip
I can't smoke with ya kid, but I'll save ya the clip...

[Chorus: Redman Method Man]
Fuhgidabowdit
Ayo nigga, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, what the fuck, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, Fuhgidabowdit
Uh, Fuhgidabowdit [DMX growl]
Ayo dog, Fuhgidabowdit [DMX growl]
Bitches can't stand me, Fuhgidabowdit [DMX growl]
Still pullin' down her panties, Fuhgidabowdit

[Verse 4: DMX]
The shit I see every day brings tears to my eyes
How I holla at my niggas brings ears to my cries
Stick niggas for not knowin', then teach 'em somethin'
Bitch niggas talki' 'bout you from the streets you frontin'
I never liked you, and you, I don't know
So what the fuck you think is 'sposed to happen, we gon go
Mano a mano, whatever nigga, I'm gon dust you
If you can't take that ass whoopin', I'm gon' bust you
Talkin to you like a lil nigga 'cause you is
But don't forget that daddy's gonna always love his kids
Faggot niggas got the nerve to wan' know why I rob
You guys are livin' phat while everybody else'll starve!
That pretty shit is lame, fuck what your name hold
Break a nigga off somethin', watch a nigga gain fo'
Now you layin somewhere cold, stiff as shit
And all that riffin' shit, mens will get you hit, bitch

[Outro: DMX]
