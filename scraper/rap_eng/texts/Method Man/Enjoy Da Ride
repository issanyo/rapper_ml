[Adam F]
Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, to the Roller Coaster Malpractice
Please stay seated, yeh, and hold on even FUCKIN tighter now
Cause this next section's, as big as the
FUCKIN BLEEDIN Ti-FUCKIN-tanic!!
And it's called the Heart Attack Mountain;
Which we feel is self-explanatory ("Stop stop stop stop!!")

[Streetlife]
Yo, I know the streets is watchin'
Dirty date niggas cock-blockin' and plottin'
Waitin' for my downfall, Street got options
Fuck y'all, y'all can ball, I'mma stay rockin
All emcee's paused when they heard the album's droppin
Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce, joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if you feelin' it
Wild the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it
This is as good as it get, who you rollin' with? (You)
Who the ultimate? (Wu)
Stay committed, sold my soul to this rap shit (nigga)
Slow your roll, strike a bowl, you get clapped quick
I roll with, ghetto bastard with biscuits
And grab my dick and flick it, get the picture

[Interlude]
Hold on..
{DT}: This is Dr. Trevis, comin to y'all motherfunkers live
Hold on, hold on..

[Redman]
Yo, yo, yo
I cop a new Benz, crash the front
So hard the airbags use nasal pumps
Jump out, cock the shottie (raise 'em up!)
I stomp holes like the ground ain't paved enough
Inform the former the first step was a warm-up
The next step'll bomb on where your car alarm was
Chikens that'll run in, burn the barn up
Shots'll tear ya Sean John and Phat Farm up (nev-ah!)
I never got a Soul Train award (nev-ah!)
Never lost to emcee's as lame as y'all (nev-ah!)
Trick a bitch car payment off
I'm a orangutang when the chain is off nigga
I set-trip, and I slowly blas
With a axe, and a pump, and a goalie mask
Leavin, stains of blood on your Roley glass
When I'm, in your hood nigga throw me bags

[Interlude]
Hold on..
{DT}: You've just been hit, with the ultimate hardcore shit
Hold on, hold on.. {motherfucker}

[Method Man]
Let's trip the night fantastic
I'm flexible, they used to call me plastic
These big butt bitches get they ass kicked
It is what it is, shittin' on y'all kids
Couldn't live where we live
I can't be defeated like "Nobody Beats the Wiz"
Like, when daddy's home can't nobody beat the kids
Right? You know the Clan and you know the fuckin man
Meth rock a mic without a kickstand
Two blunts, and razors in his wristband
Slap you and your bitch man
Lookin in your lobby, call me stick-man
When it's goin down, call me quicksand
Zero to sixty in a second, pack a Smith & Wesson
And if the price is right, you can be the next contestant
For this aggression, no question, M-E to the F
And be flexin as hard as my erection
Kid learn your lesson cuz what if I decide to start testin
Your joint - end the motherfuckin session

[Interlude]
Hold on..
{DT}: This is the final moment, where you motherfuckers bout to die
Hold on, hold on.. {yo}
{Adam F}: The Roller Coaster Malpractice! ("Stop stop stop stop!!")

[Saukrates]
Yo, yo - let a nigga get into it
Lubricate y'all veins with this "Do-It" fluid
I Einstein the rymes, spit them thangs to prove it
Cross with the Mack, in fact, my game's the truest
Now I'm on the highway, doin it my way
With Street, Illegal, Meth, Roc, and Doc Friday
Performin like the weather was warm
And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, ain't no friction
I got them rap heads fillin out a prescription, with diciton
Gettin thick when I put fire to the steaks
And burn the odds, like a iron to your face
These long hard years spent Oxy-Cleanin
Make it clear - look out, Big 'Sauks is here, nigga what?

[Outro]
Hold on..
{DT}: This is Dr. Trevis, warnin y'all motherfuckers
Hold on, hold on..
{Adam F}: The Roller Coaster Malpractice! ("Stop stop stop stop!!")
Hold on, hold on..
{DT}: PPP Def Squad, we lock shit down
Hold on, hold on..
