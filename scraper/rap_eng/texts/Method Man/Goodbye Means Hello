[Hook]
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
You got me going
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
It's all because of
You, you, you, you, you
You got me going
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo

[Verse 1]
Let's take a moment and own it
And not be scared to show it
And love like we've never before
I know you know it, don't hold it
Back and start to glow it
And I don't wanna see it no more

[Pre-Chorus]
In and in and in and out we go
Out of love and I don't know
How to keep my cool around you
In and in and in and out we go
Why'd you make it difficult?
Boy, I'm getting fed up with you

[Chorus]
As soon as I say goodbye
I'm feeling alone
Ain't no way I can live without you
So by midnight
I'm back on the phone
Ain't no way I can live without you
See the love high
Killing all the lows
Tell me why we don't keep a steady flow
So my goodbyes
Really mean hello
Really mean hello
Really, really mean hello

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I never chose you, I chose to
Get on the roller coaster of love
But that's what life had in store
As much as I want to jump off
My heart is saying hell no
Some how you got it beating for more

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I know that we argue, fuss, and fight
Who said love was easy, don't know life
That's true
I'm crazy 'bout you
I know that we made love till daylight
Who said love was easy might be right
That's true
I'm crazy 'bout you

[Bridge]
Sun in the sky, feeling no rain
At the same time we don't want it to change
It's you and I, pleasure and pain
At the same time we don't want it to change

[Chorus]

[Hook - Variation]
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
You got me going
(Really mean hello)
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
(Really, really mean hello)
It's all because of
You, you, you, you, you
(Really mean hello)
You got me going
(Really, really mean hello)
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
