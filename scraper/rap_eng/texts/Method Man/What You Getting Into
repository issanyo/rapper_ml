(Chorus – Method Man & Donny Cacsh)
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
This is what I’m into

(Verse 1 – Streetlife)
Strollin to the building, collect the money, than tell shorty get the rental
We going cross the bridge, we heading up town
Cop a couple hundred grams, bring it back make it triple
Stop at the smoke shop, cop them double zero bags
Yeah we got big rocks, those up the block, niggas mad, call up bullet man
I need some more shells, I heard you got the ap9, out the box for sale

(Chorus – Method Man & Donny Cacsh)
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
This is what I’m into

(Verse 2 - Donny Cacsh)
I wake and I’m high, I be sleeping on the clouds, like I wake up in the sky
I roll up another one and then I’m getting fly
Then I load up a couple guns, because it’s time to ride
See the money’s what I’m into, ima keep it simple
It I ain't getting guap, that shit is poppin like a pimple
Holy as a temple, hair pin trigger so gentle, can't print you
Only way to ID you is through your dental


(Chorus – Method Man & Donny Cacsh)
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
This is what I’m into

(Verse 3 - Method Man)
I’m all about this caper, in the group with 9 members
I ain’t trying to split this paper, but that’s another issue
I ain’t rappin with you haters, send you back to meet your maker
And I bet nobody missed you
The island be official, without the striped jersey and the whistle
Put the pistol to you dog, Michael Vick you
Method I’m the Shih Tzu, It only take a word for me to sic you
I mean get you and them goons are going with you

(Chorus – Method Man & Donny Cacsh)
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
This is what I’m into
