[Intro]
*"I'd like to take you on an astrological trip*
*Through the sounds of the zodi-ac"*
*"This is the zodiac"*
*"This guy is a killer!"*
*"Cold"*
*"Get him!"*
*"Zodiac: a symbol that now stands for terror in San Francisco"*
Whoo!
This shit hard, boy
*"Still at large"*
*"No one knows where he’ll strike next"*

[Verse]
Yo, call me a zodiac killah
Hard shot of liquor to a Cognac sipper
Rap spitter flow, I'm the illest, slash, iller ex-crack dealer, cold
I'm a polar cap peeler
Capricorn just for lyin’ to gorillas
Get Cancer from the smoke, 69's how I get her
This just a small version but the posse's bigger
My finger-ram trigger 'bout to Aries in ya
Yeah, it's like the dawning of Aquarian
The sign says, get your point across Sagittarian
But I just see food, pescetarian
Feel this cut, all up in your guts - that's Cesarean
You can weigh me on a scale, legendary or barbarian
Tell ‘em Libra ‘fore I bury ‘em
I'm a bully, a friend of yours ain't a friend of mine
The only shooter that’s in the gym, is Gemini

[Outro]
*"Holla, Virgo, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Libra, Sagittarius*
*Cancer, Leo, Capricorn—"*
*"Z-z-z-zodiac, z-z-z-zodiac"*
Yeah, Mr. Meth, Uncle Nu
Zodiac killers
And who the f is you?
Wu-Tang Clan rocks the world baby
Now can I get a soo?
