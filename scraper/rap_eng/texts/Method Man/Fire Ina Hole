[Verse 1: Method Man]

[Verse 1: (method man)]
With all do respect to tha game
Im tha ph- enom , not ready for primetime , be on
Extinction , change tha way u thinkin ,or be gone
Pass tha fuck out , somethin stinkin 
Could it be tha skunk? or could it be that body
In tha trunk? of my lincoln , continental style
Pop tha pussy like a pimple
Im fed up
I put it in your ear and fuck ya head up
Turnin up tha tempauture 
Told them kids to enta tha 36
Masta meth shiiit
Biohazaduas is pretentious
Do it for tha chemically imbalanced 
State ya business
Pay me at tha door'
Ironman hear me raw , 12 inches
Sure shot soldiers in the trenches
Fire in a hole
The game commences
Third string rappers play the benches
Reload
There'll be no repentance for soul
Just life sentence with no change for parole
And thats real

[Chorus:]
Fire in a hole! (pray [echoes])
Fire in a hole! [10X]
Fire in a hole! (yeah)
Fire in a hole! (yeah, yeah)
Fire in a hole! (yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Redman]
Gundowned at sun down
Run now from the bucks sound, touchdown
Your crew wanna punt now, pump-bloww
Swimming trunks torn up from the huntdown
Brakes lock 'em up now
A rich bitch smack 'em up now
A plucked out eyebrow down
Naa dog, a broad got to be a hussy
A hood rat that ride like the bride of Chuckey
Walk through my hood, your ?drools? is screamed: "Thug me"
My revolver to reload like the Scussy, doc
The bigfoot out for the squosh
Shell shocked like I'm 6 months in the bush
Fire in a hole!
Hiking in the snow with 40 motherfuckers expiring the blow
Footprints up timbs are wallabe souls
We cased to placed like Barnaby Jones, hoes
Lay it down like plats in ya hair
Ride off with your money then clap in the air

[Chorus:]
Fire in a hole!
Fire in a hole! (yo)
Fire in a hole! [3X]
Fire in a hole! (yo)
Fire in a hole!
Fire in a hole! (yo)
Fire in a hole! (yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
This is for them niggas on the bricks
Holdin' down a block for my nigga carlton fisk
The kid that stay up in a blocks
Ain't no christmas ever since Santa scratched my name off the giftlist
Shit ain't been the same since the pain or forgiveness
Dead man talkin' about elected
Un live it cancer around throat of a critic
Yo doctor, describe me a drug that can knocka'
New on his ass, take a blast up a nucker
For real though arsenic production that kills slow your eardrums
Like a happy hooker with a dildo
I spas on anyone who shows his ass
I got the mob with me plus a full tank of gas

[Verse 4: Redman]
Yo, yo
With me and meth swarm you need a net to cover you
Turn a rap game into W C W
Off the rope I hang glide to the grove
Straight people doubt french fries and a coke
Doc's the name the burglar, serve ya
That lead through five from frigs and murtar
They skirt out my with Rick ran down tires
What a chicken I met who hand out flyers
Look I'ma areas, I don't have it
My crew large enough to walk and cause traffic
Bounce like box springs on your craft-matic
Before you be sueing doc for malpractice
You couldn't bang from start
Your girl see you beat up and shit
Get a change of heart
Flaming dark spit it, name a mark
My impact towards you JFK playin' in a park

[Chorus:]
Fire in a hole! [14X]
Yeah [3X]
Fire in a hole
Yeah [5X]
Mister meth, ha-ha
Funk doctor, ha-ha
Mathematics on the track, ha-ha
All my niggas in the bricks
All my niggas on Shaolin
Worldwide
To my whole crew, BBC
Hahhahahahaa....
