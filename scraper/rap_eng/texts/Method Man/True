[Meth]
Jeeeez!

Now right
You know you dead wrong
Yo know...
Turn me up, turn me up

Jab me with a fuckin' spoon

You know you dead wrong
For this one right here baby, for real

Yo, yo, yo
Another day, another dollar
Sharks wanna bite don't bother
Cause this rhymes the truth, and
The truths hard to swallow
Don Dada, hard act to follow
See Rockwilder with the iced out dog collar
My crew want it all
This bout is scheduled for one four
We can build or we can brawl
Yes y'all, last call for alchahol, damn!
Monkey wrench fuckin' up the whole program

[Chorus:]
[Meth]
Ooh
Them don't no have to respect me
Ooh
Them don't no have to come correctly
Ooh
Can't hear nothin' but the music I'm slippin'
Big head nigga's don't listen

Hot and ah yes
My complex got a complex
Livin' in apartment complex
I'm cashin' chin checks every first and fifteenth
Failed my urinalasist, they threw me in the clink
5-0's can't stop the pot roll, Jonny
Still Blaze, send young mc's to the potty
Its side ways nine fifteen
Be aware of the fatal flyin' guilintines
Are you prepared?

[Chorus:]
Ooh
Them don't no have to respect me
Ooh
Them don't no have to come correctly
Ooh
Time flow constantly the way time flow
I live by the code, style is mad P.L.O

My crew swarm in, tell a bitch please
Didn't mama tell you about the birds and the bees?
Especially them killa's
Girls night out with gorrillas (Meth acting like monkey)
Too slow ya' blow catterpilla
Son got game
And he pack a Rosco, ?fleat coal? train
Player we ain't playin'
Crush assossiated labels, don't let me in, I push my way in...
[Meth interupts with coughing]
As I was sayin', I push my way in, fuck it
How many suffered
For this Hip-Hop, if I can't see it, can't trust it
Tic-toc when will that fake shit stop?
Flip flop battery go dead in the clock

[Chorus:]
Ooh
Them don't no have to respect me
Ooh
Them don't no have to come correctly
Ooh
Can't hear nothin' but the music I'm slippin'
Big head nigga's don't listen

Stapleton, the wild west Park Hill
Port Richmond, now born jungle nill
We dumbin', stunnin', bustin' to keep 'em comin'
Nigga's with alchahol problems, a hundred miles and runnin', yeah
Meth, I came here for crooks but I'm still here
Called me every name in the book but I'm still here
What up doc?
This Looney Toon got 'em shell shocked
Anvils droppin' out the sky once my hand cock
Back, I check you in to the smack down hotel, while everythings black
I'm like the cast in Belly I don't know how to act on wax
Rockwilder bring it on back

[Chorus:]
Ooh
Them don't no have to respect me
Ooh
Them don't no have to come correctly
Ooh
Time flow constantly the way time flow
I live by the code, style is mad P.L.O
