[Intro: Method Man]
You and I, 'til the day we die (Trackmasters)
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Method Man & D'Angelo]
Ex-girlfriend, how you been?
I see you still, tryin' to fuck with other women men
Remember when I first met you in my cousin's house?
A week later, we was fuckin' on your mama couch (ah, no)
Now it's been said that big girls they don't cry (uh)
But they damn sure lie, look you in the eye, sayin' you they only
You and I, 'til the day we die
Said you'd never leave me lonely (uh-huh)
Fly tenderoni, but you phony (something)
Shoulda listened when my mama told me (uh)
Soon as I turn my back, you tryna fuck my homies
That was then, this is now, I got a new friend
Ever since I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me (ah)
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
About leavin' the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me
Now you on your third baby daddy
And you hate to see a nigga happy (you don't know)
So you tryin' mad ways to trap me (uh, babe)
Looking at my girl nasty, tryna throw the pussy at me (uh)

[Interlude: D'Angelo & Girls]
Ah ("Now look at this bitch over here tryin' to act like me")
Ah ("Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she must like leftovers")

[Chorus: D'Angelo & Method Man]
I'm still lovin' you, babe—every break ups
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
I'm still lovin' you, babe—just the make ups
I'm still lovin' you, babe—uh, babe
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
I'm still lovin' you, babe—something will...
I'm still lovin' you, babe—break ups
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
Little, little lovin' you, babe—ah, baby
I'm still lovin' you, babe—I'm still lovin' you
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
Little, little lovin' you, babe—doo (yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Method Man & D'Angelo]
It's always you and your crusty-ass crew, be actin' new
Let me find out that you fuckin' with Boo, and y'all gon' feel it
Waitin' for the day that you front, and catch a lump (ah, no)
From my black butterfly, that arm pack a lullaby
Sleep on her, she said you bitches tried to creep on her
Up in the mall and didn't know she had the reach on her
Pearl-handled .22, my Boo, she go ahead and walk her dogs
And represent Wu (ah-ah, babe, uh)
To the fullest, you and hon can shoot the fair one (something)
I'll bring the bullets (bullets)
You know what I'm sayin'? (hah, hah, always)
Stop playin' (ah, no, hah, hah)
You and them dyke lookin' bitches
Actin' like y'all jumpin' somethin'
Go 'head with that bullshit (ah, baby, motherfucker)

[Chorus: D'Angelo & Method Man]
I'm still lovin' you, babe—still don't know
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
I'm still lovin' you, babe—ah, baby
I'm still lovin' you, babe—never wanna love in you for that
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
I'm still lovin' you, babe, doo—oh, for that
I'm still lovin' you, babe—catch her, whoa
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
Little, little lovin' you, babe—never wanna love in you, too
I'm still lovin' you, babe, doo—something
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
Little, little lovin' you, babe—doo (ah)

[Verse 3: Method Man & D'Angelo]
Got tired of the games, the lies, the feeble alibis
Now you fuckin' with the next guy, a thug nigga
Derelict be actin' bugged nigga, show this nigga
Mad love but get no love nigga? Stupid-ass (ah, no, baby)
Plus I heard that he be beatin' on you
I seen him at the club cheatin' on you (uh)
Witcha best friend, got you stressin'
And used up, pull your shoes up
All you need's affection (yeah)
But you're headed in the wrong direction (yeah)
Tryin' to make this nigga jealous, with other fellas
All up in my face actin' overzealous (uh-huh)
Like you want somethin' from Meth, I hope it ain't love, girl (uh)
'Cause I ain't got none left for you (hey, no)
Plus you miserable (no, babe)
Misery love company, shit, I'm livin' comfortably
Don't need no nigga huntin' me down for fuckin' 'round (no, babe)
With his kitty, talk to him
Before my brother put a spark through him
Won't be pretty (no, babe)
The situation got my whole attitude shitty (uh)
And got you actin' high saditty with your slut committee (babe)
You know I know (doo)
So go find another sucker, yo
I been there and been done that befo', and don't need it no mo'
That's my word (ah)
So go to your room with that there, word up (ah)
And tell that big head nigga, "You run with to do the same" (baby)

[Chorus: D'Angelo & Method Man]
I'm still lovin' you, babe—ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm still lovin' you, babe—ah, babe, baby
I'm still lovin' you, babe—baby, catch you, close to me, yeah
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
I'm still lovin' you, babe—every break ups

(you and I, 'til the day we die)
Little, little lovin' you, babe—uh, babe
I'm still lovin' you, babe—something will...
(you and I, 'til the day we die)
Little, little lovin' you, babe, doo—baby
