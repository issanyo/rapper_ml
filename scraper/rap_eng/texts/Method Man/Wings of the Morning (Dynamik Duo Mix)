[Intro: Capleton]
And I say, grace is the man greatly to be praised
Selassie I liveth everytime
I say, Jah shall execute judgment and justice and none shall escape Lord of mercy
What me say?!
Selassie I liveth every time
What me say?!

[Chorus: Capleton]
Boy, you coulda put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Lay inna the uttermost part of the sea
There is no escape from His Majesty

[Verse 1: Capleton]
A long time he a tell you 'bout the dirty slavery
A long time he a tell you 'bout the brutality
A long time he a tell you 'bout the hypocrisy
Me warn you, 'bout recent monarchy
Me warn you, all 'bout we black liberty
Me warn you, all 'bout we equality
Me warn you, all 'bout Marcus Garvey
We beg you, all fi love His Majesty
Selassie I, so let it be
Selassie I, power of The Trinity
A x-amount of nations bow down 'pon them knees
No stop from beg, and dem no stop from plea
And nowhere to run and there is -

[Chorus: Capleton]
Oh boy!
Put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Lay inna the uttermost part of the sea
There is no escape from His Majesty

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Here come that rudebwoy shit, criminology legit
Legalize dope to get me mega-rich Selassie I
We can all get by if we unify
Gettin chinky eye off the stimuli, blazin the cut
And all that good stuff, six-three walk with a strut
On these New York streets like baby what
Anything can happen, it usually does
I'm from Staten, the Island, peep me on G-Street, Ticallion
Everything is real ain't nuttin fronted
Counterfeit rapper haffa bungee
He's in it for the munties, M-O-N-E-Y
But you can't take it witcha when you die, Selassie high

[Verse 3: Capleton]
Ethiopia a the wings, tell dem fi exit
'Cause no anti-Christ we nah go worship
Heights of life for the righteous, but the wicked haffi perish
With dem religion and dem ol' poli-tricks
Have the people dem a turn, and have the people dem a twist
Nuh show dem no love, a hatred dem cherish
Give dem some 16, and some rusty Matics
Have dem a hold up dem fingers and a push up dem fists
Lead the sheep dem astray, you must get punished
Cyan escape your judgment, stand up -

[Chorus]
Oh boy!
Put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Lay inna the uttermost part of the sea
There is no escape from His Majesty

So wha'?!
And one of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come."
Where you gonna run to?
Oh ohhh
I say, they're gonna run to the rocks and mountain, but there will be no rock
No rock!
They're gonna run to the rocks and mountain but there will be no rock
So wha' we say?!

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Wu-Tang Clan's in the area, Capleton's in the area
We got Shaolin in the area
Big up yourself black man, my brothers
Hell is the plan for the other, discover, discover, discover, c'mon, c'mon
New lands for you man and your family
Reminisce on back in the days, can it be
It was all so simple then, we all kin
And black-skinned, original Don set the trend
Let's be men, if not for us, then for the babies
The little ones the revolution has now begun

[Chorus: Capleton]
[Put on, put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I!!]

[Outro: Method Man]
Now, owwww, everybody
Get in where you fit in
For nine-five, the nine-nickel
Cold as an icicle, Method Man
Capleton, representing
Dynamic Duo on the track
