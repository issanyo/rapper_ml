[Sample: Morgan Freeman]
Let me tell you something my friend
Hope is a dangerous thing
Hope can drive a man insane
Its got no use on the other side
You better get used to that idea

[Intro: Sol Virani & (Method Man)]
I got cotton mouth
You know how it go
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: Sol Virani]
Look
I wonder if I fail just how many will go to hell
I'm trying to send good messages, fuck how many I sell
Hoping my assumptions of theory is just a fail
Hoping that my lessons of goodness riches prevail
Not saying I'm perfect, say I'm harder than that
But I got standard from when niggas rocked a starter cap
And I got morals for myself, I'm living by a code
And I arrive for you even if you hardly drove
Figure that, my intuition be gone on expeditions
I suffer from crazy visions but I don't need a psych camp
See Einstein and Newton and all the greatest minds
We ever had in time were crazy too
I turn on my lamp
Enlighten you even if you're frightened to
I'll sensei that ass you can get to riping dude
And help you find the right path like a big Nissan
Pull you in the right direction, you ain't got a leash on
Searching for the wealth homie, I'm trying to get my feast on
Trying to get some ladies on my Johnson like Keshawn
Boy just put the beat on and I'll float away
But I ain't flowing with the current yah I flow astray
I'm swimming in a new direction this you won't predict
Its like I'm dropping out, can't fuck with this school of fish
Cause if I take the current then I'm just like everybody else
And niggas is so similar they can't think for themselves
Oh no

[Hook: Sol Virani]
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
I been waiting on this all day
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal baby
I just want to parlay
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
Niggas doing it the wrong way
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Let's take them back
Check the old school flow
Like water see I sorta got a Rick James aura
Let the whole school know the order
Yeah
Can't tell you what an old fool know
But anything organic, that's a whole food store
Taking nothing for granted
If you hoes too slow too bad
When one door open they close two more
I ball and dragon y'all
That Goku glow
Stash grams in ceiling fans
I don't do blow or pills
My 40 below's giving them chills
I can drive a hard bargain
And never give them the wheel
That's ill, Park Hill
Never ran, never will
Listen king
I jack queen if you don't tell her the deal
Black or white
Its so Cruella de Vil
This is dog 101, now give Cruella the steel, blaw
Meth
There ain't nothing Beverly Hills
About me or my team
We living legends for real

[Hook: Sol Virani]
Look
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
I been waiting on this all day
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal baby
I just want to parlay
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
Niggas doing it the wrong way
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal

[Verse 3: Sol Virani]
I grew impatient and no longer could be vacant
See I hoard thoughts, in a gold box
Lay it down like I'm her patient
Got a pill like I'm the one
Guess that puts me in The Matrix
See I'm the boss so I just call you up for cancellation
I'm aching
For sweet love and back breaking
That's what I tell the universe when we communicating
So when we have a baby that's the time for celebration
And roll the trees up, take me on a vacation
Picture me just standing on the corner of Magnolia
Strolling though the projects with my niggas man I told ya
And you ain't standing next to me either
Cause they'll hold ya up
Hit you with the rope-a-dope
And have you feeling like a duck
Straight plucked
Fucking with me you straight fucked
Just lube up if you want to play it tough boy
Them armor piercing rounds will wet your ass up boy
But like a transvestite I keep my shit tucked boy

[Outro: Sol Virani]
Got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal

Got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
