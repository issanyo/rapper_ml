[Intro]
Hey, you, get off my cloud
You don't know me, and you don't know my style
Gettin' lifted, never comin' down
Gettin' lifted

[Verse 1]
Gettin' dumb on the drum rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
Better run, when I come, what a bomb bomb
Sippin' on coke and rum, gettin' so drunk
Everyone wonderin' where she come from?
Got gold on my necklace, gold on my wrists
Girls gettin' mad cause their boys want a kiss
Fast with the cash, I just throw it in the bag
Everything I wanna have (well I think you get the gist)

[Pre-hook]
Upside downside, inside outside
Hittin' you from every angle, there's no doubt
Poetry in motion, coast to coast and
Rub it in your skin like lotion

[Chorus]
I got myself a 40
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a 40
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted

[Verse 2]
H-U-F-F, huff and I puff
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowin'
Zoom, I hit the mic like boom
Wrote a song about it, like to hear it? Here it goes
Style will hit you, wham, then goddamn
You'll be like, "Oh shit, that's the jam!"
Turn it up, now hear me get buck wi-wi-wild (while)
I'm about to blow, light me up

[Pre-hook]
Upside downside, inside outside
Hittin' you from every angle there's no doubt
Poetry in motion, coast to coast and
Rub in it your skin like lotion

[Chorus]
I got myself a 40
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a 40
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted

[Bridge]
Hey, you, get off my cloud
You don't know me, and you don't know my style
Gettin' lifted, never comin' down
Gettin' lifted, never comin' down
Hey, you, get off my cloud
You don't know me, and you don't know my style
Gettin' lifted, never comin' down
Gettin' lifted

[Chorus]
I got myself a 40
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a 40
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes I'm about to go get lifted
