(Chorus 2x - Chedda Bang)
Show some respect when we come through
Worldwide, let me see your w’s

(Chorus 2x - Hanz On)
Throw ‘em up, turn em over, what it do, what it do
Meth Man Murda gonna perish you

(Verse 1 - Method Man)
These rappers rap backwards, I don’t rap with them rap dudes
2Pac backwards, pull that ratchet & cap too
Back to 93 when I still was holding those capsules
I also had a 38, ya’ll don’t give me no hassle
Keith Kool, G Rap moves, it's only natural
When on the road to riches, I hit the horn when I pass you beep beep
Pardon my sneeze. Haters get ‘atchew’
Ballers trying to move with the white, now would Shaq do
Go harder in the paint. Slap you like ya barber
Or the 6th man, thinking he a starter when he ain’t
I’m a sick man, but smarter than you think
And it’s a thin line between the driver & the robber in the bank
See I’m cut like a barber with a shank, cool
Women going swimming with their drinks, pools
Now who hasn’t heard her that Meth Man & Uncle Murda
It’s like your cousin trying to kill you with your uncles burner

(Chorus 2x - Chedda Bang)
Show some respect when we come through
Worldwide, let me see your w’s

(Chorus 2x - Hanz On)
Throw ‘em up, turn em over, what it do, what it do
Meth Man Murda gonna perish you

(Verse 2 - Uncle Murda)
Yeah I’m Uncle Murda from the jects
Yeah I’m disrespectful, but get a lot respect
When I’m waving the tech, you better protect your neck
Got em looking like Inspectah, the way their hitting the deck
I with the METHOD man, its feelin like the 90’s back when my tech use to jam
18 putting pressure on these chumps, sending niggas that’s in their 30’s to go & get my dutch
Cash rules everything around me. I’m cookin a brick
Feelin like the chef, wearing my Cuban linx. I was ODB, creepin with dirty ho’s
Bumpin 36 chambers with 36 ho’s
Fuck the world, don’t ask me for shit
This that Brooklyn, Shaolin Big & Meth shit
This that shit you bump, before you catch a body
NY back on their shit. I hope these niggas copy

(Chorus 2x - Chedda Bang)
Show some respect when we come through
Worldwide, let me see your w’s

(Chorus 2x - Hanz On)
Throw ‘em up, turn em over, what it do, what it do
Meth Man Murda gonna perish you
