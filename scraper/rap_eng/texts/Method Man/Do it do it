[Intro: Method Man, (Sticky Fingaz)]
Just gon' fly me in huh?
What up Sticky?! (What up nigga!)
Aha, that's my nigga
It's your boy John-John phenomenon from Vietnam (Braaat)
Don't make me catch a flashback in this bitch

[Sticky Fingaz]
Everyday I wake up, different bitch next to me
Black, White, Asian, more colors then the Fugees
They come, snobby or gangsta, ghetto or bougie
I'm havin', sexual encounters straight out of a movie
You see me pull up, jump out, it's a beautiful ride
Little do they know it's ugly little guns inside
Dumb Ten Crack Commandments, I knew them shits
But I don't sell drugs nigga, I just use them shits (Huh!)
You ain't a gangsta, you ain't a mobster
Puttin' on a good act, you should get an Oscar
Everything you say on record over a beat
Can and will be held against you in the streets
I'm deaf, blind, and a mute when that four-four hit
I ain't see nothin', I ain't hear nothin', and I don't know shit
Sticky Fingaz, I'm from the worst kind of species
If Suge made you drink piss, I'll make you eat feces

[Chorus x2: Method Man]
Come on everybody let's do it, do it
We got a party, watch my niggas run through it, through it (right)
Don't fuck around and be stupid, stupid
There's a party goin' on tonight!

[Method Man]
Yo, yo
Who your man? A hundred grand wrapped in dirty rubber bands
Like he off the get his re-up
Y'all niggas wanna see us?
Y'all quitters try to keep up
The game anorexic, y'all don't eat much
Gettin' more milk than any double d cup
Relax, kick my feets up
Holler at your frog, watch me leap up
Don't try to tap my jaw, tap my reefer
I put that on Tamika
I need extra cheese, y'all can put that on my pizza
Make like a tree and leaf
I'm out the big East Coast, don't need no introduction
Just a box of blunts and a lot of weed smoke
In my spare time, write rhymes, and bag ma'
Me and Sticky Fingaz go back like Clue's hairline
Just like you hit the spliff too hard and burnt your lip
It's time that y'all insert your clips for Kirk and Cliff
Give me a home with a get high zone
I turn a Pocket Full of Stones into chariot with chrome

[Chorus x2: Method Man]
Come on everybody let's do it, do it
We got a party, watch my niggas run through it, through it (right)
Don't fuck around and be stupid, stupid
There's a party goin' on tonight!
