Here we go
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they all too good
There lived a lil' boy who was misled
By anotha lil' boy and this is what he said, check it:
"Me and you kid, we gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash"
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.C. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic, he said
I got you all in check
Yah Yah Yah, Yah Yah
Yah Yah Yah, Yah Yah
Yah Yah Yah, Yah Yah
Yah Yah Yah, Yah Yah
When I step up in the place
Ay yo I step correct
Woo-Hah ,got you all in check
I got that head nod sh*t
Make you break your neck
Woo-Hah, I got you all in check
And you know we come through
To wreck the disco tech
Woo-Hah, I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air
Don't ever disrespect
Woo-Hah
I got you all in check
YO Grimm!
What's up?
Which muthaphucka stole my flow
Eenie....meenie miney mo
Throw that type of nigga right out my window
Blast your ass hit you with my direct blow
Bo!! Coming through like G.I. Joe
Star Wars movie deal like Han Solo
Make you bounce around like this was calypso
Always shine cause I got the high pro glow
You think that you can hide you think you can lay low
Roll up on your ass like Hawaii 5-0
Mad out with my dreads in my kango
Forget the Moet nigga just pass the Cisco
Yo!! Take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that sh*t that might make you psycho
Maximum frequencies through that stereo
Sorry this is it but homeboy I got to go
Yo, where you go where you at bring it back!
Props to all my people on the hip hop scene who going fast than me
Without much sheen my inspiration from youth killa bee got loose
The M.E.T.H.O.D. Man won't kick with a jew
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man

Hey you get off my cloud
Let me get raw with my southpaw style
Mover, puffin' on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun foes
I keeps you open like a slug from the shotgun punk
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in me casa
Straight up, you movin' too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up
Get on down wit' your bad self
Get on down, listen to the sound, come on
Few can ever get this whole commit legit
See you all up in my dick
But you don't know sh*t, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real MC
From what you dedicated, yeah must be me
Meth-Tical, a lewd descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way
Alive, what you got to say
Come on!, move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down
Come on yeah, Meth-Tical
Oh I often pray that I will
But today I am still
Just a...

M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
