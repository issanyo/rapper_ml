[Hook: Eazy Get Rite]
(Bang Zoom) Them hammers go boom, shoot ‘em up leave ‘em there and clear the room
Nigga all I hear is (chick pow). So give it up now, that’s the type of shit that happens in my town
Nigga all you do is (click clack), listen fuck that. All that bullshit hesitating get you clapped
All I know is (zoom bang), letting my nuts hang. Out to get it, best believe I do my thing
(yo its Staten Nigga)

[Verse 1: Hanz]
Hanz roll. Buzz swoll. Don’t be understanding how these corny niggas bold
Life told, screenplay graphic when it unfold. Running with them killas made his heart cold
Lights strobe. Cameras on him walking through the threshold
Spanish bitches yelling dame besos. Watch glowed, earlobes frozen but we seek gold
Mr. Barka. Yup, yup, beast mode. Meth labs, bishop in the city
Get them grips grabbed, run up do him greasy. You’ll be shot, stabbed, got it looking easy
Have ‘em zipped, bagged, to the morgue motherfucker
Cash rules, so we berry everything. General smash fumes, dark Henny everything
Peep the math, jewels yo we built for the struggle
Hanz on, nuff said, bout his bread. Boy trouble

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Meth man, yes Hanz, twenty years of love, they been throwing up them dubs
That’s respect, damn, money, sex, drugs, you’ll get stretched, blam, tec nine up in the club
That’s a tec jam, can’t wait to see him go, make ‘em hate to see me blow
I’m a label CEO minus the yes man, Rick Rubin with the spliff
That could spit it Ludacris, minus the Def Jam
Mean while, stick ya for ya cream, red beam (chi-ca-bloow), Another John Coffey on that Green Mile
Get it how I’m living, got an ounce of Steve Rifkind, that’s that green loud
Yes sir, no child left behind, pump your brakes (scrrrrrrrr)
Snitching in the kitchen you’ll get baked served, my life is like a movie
All groovy I mean its all Gucci (burrrr)

[Verse 3: Streetlife]
Streetlife, goon, platoon, locked reloaded, bang zoom. Gee coated, from the womb to the tomb
I’m married to the game, this my honeymoon. Yes, I do, forever Wu
Loyalty is royalty, cream blue. Code red, dangerous ground
Street I’m heaven sent but I’m hell bound
Top fie, hands down, Staten popular son, peace lounge
Crown fitted for the king, I am, I suggest, you play the wing man
Shine like a diamond, like bling blam. God body watch a nigga go ham
Lifestyle episodes of Gangland. Thirty six shots from the chamber blam...
