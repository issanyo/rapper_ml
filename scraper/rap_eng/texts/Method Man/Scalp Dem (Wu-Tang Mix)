*Super Cat intro*

[Super Cat]
Well I consumed with disappointment
Bounty Hunter Killa Cowbwoy on a claim that I a ridin' west
Di guy a run off him mout' an' big up him chest
'Bout Apache dem come fi distress
About to make me tell all of this
Gonna make sure I got on the bulletproof vest
Cause when mi pop off and splurge anyting we come fi test
Mi say they gone underground fi go rest

[Hook: Super Cat]
Make me tell you bout scalp dem, scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem, scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem, scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Me gon' scalp dem, and hang dem up high

[Super Cat]
Indian from all direction
Surround the whole of dem inna di Grand Canyon
Nesbert, Cherokee and Cheyenne
Catch the outlaw raiders and Bounty Killer, yeah
The woman a fi di wild Indian
Me take the money and the gold, and burn the wagon
Rush up John Wayne an' the one Levon
The cavalry friend, we burst em one by one
And they rest of them, me have a detention
Tell them that Apache run the Western land

[Hook]

[Method Man]
Yo, the ghetto red hot, rude boy licking shots
In your area, mad man terror on your block
Ruckus, for the trouble, making gat busting, head touchers
Crooked train robbing gold rushers, nigga
It be the villain from the Wu Building
That be, ready and willing for a wardance killing
Murda, there ain't nothing in the world that I ain't heard of
Or did, to keep the hunger pain from coming back, kid
Super Cat's sick, everything be cool irie
Pass the peace pipe like Chief Cocheese, yeah

[Hook]

[Super Cat]
A bwoy a talk 'bout, a petty bwoy can try
But him shoot Apache Chief and him 'fraid that he a fly
Must have shot a bald eagle from out of di sky
Cast him and hang him up high
Bring fire dance, and now the bwoy die
Him woman, she bow down and a cry
And when she start cry she hear shots multiply
We kill two outlaw and we scalp in July
We let go Eli, cause Eli no fi die
We let go Josey Waler and the worl' know why
We sign a treaty, after the war sign nuh die
But if a boy slip, we kill and sound fly
