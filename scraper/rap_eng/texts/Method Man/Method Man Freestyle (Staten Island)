[Verse 1: Method Man]
My repertoire is militant
The last days, what the blood is we dealing﻿ with?
The Johnny Blaze, grab yo' pistol
Teflon, mega-bombs, and heat-seeking missiles
Time to go to war, shit's official
The mic stalker, only if you can understand it
The sky walker, that be leaping over planets
Pain! Got that ghetto blood in my vein
Spread it through my kin, confess my sins, and blame
Society for unawareness, fuck the president
He don’t represent the ghetto resident
Recognize﻿ fool within the black coal there’s a jewel
The revolution been in effect, pull up your shoe
Utilize your third eye it be in my eye
Now I choose who gotta die - him, every time
Ticallion stallion now hold on
Like black diamonds, stud medallions, and so on
