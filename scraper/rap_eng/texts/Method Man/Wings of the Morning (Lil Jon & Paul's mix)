And so great is a man goin to be praised
Selassie I every time
I say Jah shall execute judgment and justice
And none shall escape, what me say
Selassie I leave em terrified, what me say

Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty

A long time he a tell you bout the duttie square breed
A long time he a tell you bout the brutality
A long time he a tell you bout the him fantasy
But why yo, boat men shan manakhe
But why yo, a-bout the black he body
But why yo, I vote with equality
But why yo, a-bout Marcus Garvey
We there yo, I feel love his Majesty
Selassie I, soul that kept me
Selassie I, for I the trinity
A ex amount of action been dumped onto me
No stop from wicked them no stop from flee
Ah nowhere to run and there is no void

Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty

Here come that rude boy shit, criminology lefit
Legalize dude to get me mega-rich Selassie I
We can all get by if we unify
Gettin chinky eye off the stimuli, blazin the gun
And all that good stuff, six-three walk with a strut
On these New York streets like baby what
Anything can happen, it usually does
I'm from Staten, the Island, peep me on G-Street, Ticallion
Everything is real ain't nuttin fronted
Down a fake rapper haveta bungee
He's in it for the munties, money
But you can't take it witcha when you die, Selassie high

If you put-ta on de wings and tempt to exit
Then no conjure Christ and none gone bullshit
Ay Selai for the righteous but the wicked are to perish
With them burn the gun and them whole poli-tricks
Half the people dem a turn and half the people dem a twist
Now shoot dem, another ear-trick done perish
Get M some 16 and some rusty-matic
After the whole of them from gone then push up them fists
Leave the ship them a strip, you must get punish
Go ahead, speed up your judgment, stand up boy boy

Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty

So ahh, and one of these day
When you hear a boy faint then uhh
Where you gonna run too, ohhhh woyyyy
I said they gonna run to the rock
And mountain but they will be no rock, no rock
They're gonna run to the rocks
And mountain but they will be no rock, so what we say

Wu-Tang Clan's in the area, Capleton's in the area
We got Shaolin in the area
Big up yourself black man, my brothers
Hell is the plan for the other, discover, discover, discover, c'mon, c'mon
New lands for you man and your family
Reminisce on back in the days, can it be
It was all so simple then, we all kin
And black-skinned, original Don set the trend
Let's be men, if not for us, then for the babies
The little ones the revolution has now begun
(Put on put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I)

Now, owwww, everybody
Get in where you fit in
For nine-five, the nine-nickel
Cold as an icicle, Method Man
Capleton, representing
Dynamic Duo on the track
