[Verse 1: Method Man]
Apocalypse Now, mind over matter
Next batter be Tical, put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with?
Murder track what? Slang killing it, touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now, follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture, 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone, with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice, finger itchy like lice, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck y'all act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chilling like
(long inhale)

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changing
The courses of time, devils no longer exist
As God Cipher Divine, all minds one, no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing, you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel? Was he using Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist, you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?

[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
Mind arson, my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent, Range whipping, Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in Osh Kosh, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Getting caught up in my world, HÃ¤agen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in
