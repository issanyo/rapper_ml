[Intro: Hanz On]
Yo
Yo, yo
Yo

[Verse 1: Hanz On]
Yo, it's gettin' hotter, Barker in the flesh
Yo, he get malicious with it, more or less
Yo, he get suspicious, man, y'all know the rest
Yo, hearts absent in these rapper's chest
Yes, he is resilient if you go reflect
Blessed, them goons holdin' but they on they best
Yo, so when you see 'em better show respect
It's Hanzarelli, had them grizzlies come and get you pressed
Yo, you mother fuckers, y'all ain't actin' right
Y'all niggas spendin' all the paper, y'all ain't trappin' right
Ain't no other way to say it, shit is black and white
I have you on the train to Georgia like you're Gladys Knight
Whoa, he the conductor, fuckers, pay the price
He like a drunk trucker blowin' through the traffic lights
Y'all like some blood suckas, busters in your blood type
The shadow figure push the button, make y'all outta sight

[Chorus]
Yo, y'all know what type of time we on
Yo, shinin' with no diamonds on
Yo, them Staten boys hittin' hard and we always with the shits whenever drummers on
Yo, y'all know what type of time we on
Yo, shinin' with no diamonds on
Yo, them Staten boys hittin' hard and we always with the shits whenever drummers on

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Yo, respect the jook, y'all ready know
Yo, I'm burnin' kush, keep that Reggie though
Yo, I'm talkin' bush, y'all so petty though
You in the town, you can get around, no merry-go
Whoa, boy, I shred 'em up, confetti throw
I'm runnin' circles around your circle, who said he owe?
Staten, welcome to the island, we ready, yo
We Getty, yo, and we part Italians, SpaghettiOs
Yo, I'm 'bout my fetti, that heavy dough
Just let me blow, every forecast is heavy snow
Burr, if Method freezin', I bet he froze
Burr, one with every season, I bet he cold
Forty below let the forty blow
When I'm stealin' forty belows after forty years old, yow
Not Metta World, but meta-flow
And these are tests, try and catch the metaphor

[Chorus]
Yo, y'all know what type of time we on
Yo, shinin' with no diamonds on
Yo, them Staten boys hittin' hard and we always with the shits whenever drummers on
Yo, y'all know what type of time we on
Yo, shinin' with no diamonds on
Yo, them Staten boys hittin' hard and we always with the shits whenever drummers on

[Verse 3: Apocalipps]
Hey, yo, the street is the only life I know
Yo, I get it poppin' everywhere I go
Since I was an embryo, I been that nigga, yo
Shoutout to Wu like the episode from the Martin show
Yo, walk with a Staten strut, burn a dutch
I'm first on the frontline to hit 'em up
Mr. Clutch when it's crunch time, I got the touch
And I don't need a pat on the back, but thank you much
Student of my culture, gun in my holster
Blow some coca, live it, la vida loca
I'm a alpha dog, y'all niggas is analog
We digital, it's impossible to beat the gods
It's logical, why would you go against the odds?
It's possible, you could die for that shit you blog
Check my résumé, real nigga DNA
Get it the ski-mask way 'til my dyin' day

[Chorus]
Yo, y'all know what type of time we on
Yo, shinin' with no diamonds on
Yo, them Staten boys hittin' hard and we always with the shits whenever drummers on
Yo, y'all know what type of time we on
Yo, shinin' with no diamonds on
Yo, them Staten boys hittin' hard and we always with the shits whenever drummers on
