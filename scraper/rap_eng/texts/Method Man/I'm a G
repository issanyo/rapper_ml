[Intro: Method Man]
Ay-Yo, What up y'all?
It's ya boy big Meth
Y'all know how I do Motherfuckers
I eat ya food up fast!

I'm here representing for my nigga Kazh
He comin' Through you know how i'm doin
Word up ...... Van' city where you at?
Get at ya' Boy early!

[Chorus: Method Man]
My chucks are scuffed up, Khakis hang low
Mass amount of hoes, my rims and chain glow
I'm all about my dough
What bitch? You ain't know?

'I'm a G, the one these lil' niggas wanna be'

Look, I'm on my A-Game niggas stay in ya lane
Pump ya breaks fo'
I pump two slugs straight in ya brain
Look, I blow like K bitch you know the name

'I'm a G, the one these lil niggas wanna be'

[Verse 1: Young Kazh]
I'm out in Van' City on my Grizzly do
Left them 2's alone but my goons pack chrome
Listen the way I spit it, fly, photogenic
Had your girl all up in the rental
We sentimental
Gentlemen'll clapped wassup?
KC in the house lil ma' wassup?
Although my people is lethal
We came to party wit'cha
Lil' weed, lil' hen, lil' bacardi wit'cha
Dont make me ball out
The four fitfth cal. and wile out
Young Kazh, Mr Meth-Tical in the house
Get ya Hands up!
Shake yo titties, bounce yo ass to the rhythm
Hot rhymes I spit, imagine the way i'm livin'
Flights to the caribbean, party with fly women
Cruises over seas, pockets full of G's
Progress in the streets, gully I chase money
Stackin, I'm still hungry
Timbs are state [?]

[Chorus: Method Man]
My chucks are scuffed up, Khakis hang low
Mass amount of hoes, my rims and chain glow
I'm all about my dough
What bitch? You ain't know?

'I'm a G, the one these lil niggas wanna be'

Look, Im on my A-Game niggas stay in ya lane
Pump ya breaks fo'
I pump two slugs straight in ya brain
Look, I blow like K bitch you know the name

''Im a G, the one these lil niggas wanna be'

[Method Man - Spoken]
What'up Shitty drawls ass niggas
Its ya boy Big Meth right here
Coming through with the SU
You know how the W-U do it
We ain't playing with y'all motherfuckers

[Verse 2: Tre Nyce]
Now if you got a fat spliff go and light it up
I'm tryna hit a bad chick till I get a nut
Then I get a nuf'
Kush in the central, smoke till the jar empty
On my A-Game [?] cases like Marc Emery
Short term Memory
Long term Money
Each ear stay with a carrot like Bugz Bunny
I know you haters mad that we gettin it man
Van city got locked by Kuruption Camp
And we, stay fly blowin kush to the sky
Method Man, Redman, How high?
Im a G nigga thats... No lie
So when we in the club
Know them bottles gon' pile
Eyes like a hawk for them haters and vultures
See us front page of your cannibis culture
Touch it, take a pull girl
I know that ya want to
3 way, U-tray this Marijuana

[Chorus: Method Man]
My chucks are scuffed up, Khakis hang low
Mass amount of hoes, my rims and chain glow
I'm all about my dough
What bitch? You ain't know?

'I'm a G, the one these lil niggas wanna be'

Look, Im on my A-Game niggas stay in ya lane
Pump ya breaks fo'
I pump two slugs straight in ya brain
Look, I blow like K bitch you know the name

'I'm a G, the one these lil niggas wanna be'
