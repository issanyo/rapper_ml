[Intro: E-40 and Method Man]
Uhh! Hey Meth Merchant!
Method Man Meth, what's up boy? What's upper? Trying to get my ones up
Crack Alley Studios mang
It's Freezy mang, Paul Revere mang, we doin this shit
You know it's good, 40 Water, you'se a pimp nigga, look out

[Verse: E-40]
They call me Paul Revere, 40 Water cause I like to ball
Things be going in one ear and out the other one y'all
Never had a chance to be an infant I had to walk before I crawled
Had to dang near raise my siblings mama worked 3 jobs
Seen a lot of pan handlin' and gritt'in
Chicken flippin and dealin, dudes coming up missing
Empty banana clipping, it's been happening quite often
They pull up on the side and turn your car into a coffin
And ain't nobody talking because that's the rules of the soil, we beef over rap
The government beef over oil, we beef in the track
They beat on sacred, royal, ancient holding grounds
Thinking that it's righteous, way out of bounds

[Chorus: Method Man]
From New York to the Bay yo
Sao Paulo to L.A. yo
Nobody move until we say so
They wanna know who got that N.A.S.A. music
From New York to the Bay yo
Sao Paulo to L.A. yo
Nobody move until we say so
They wanna know who got that N.A.S.A. music

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Another day, another dollar
Meth squeeze a dollar til it holler
Miss holler you either spit or swallow
Meet me at the same place, same time tomorrow
Take the R out of brotha, but I ain't trying to botha

[E-40]
MP5's, bush masters, Chinese AKs, alley ways
Shallow, grim, dark murky days
Slappin dominos on the porch with it
Real mannish with it, I rip it
Spit for the less fortunate
Me and Meth Merchant
I call him Meth Merchant because he's dope
We in this booch perkin and we stoked
They say there ain't no future in our hope
No life in our breath, scared to die, but quick to take a death

[Method Man]
Little Johnny on the block, about to blood like clot
With his body in the drop, damn a little mommy hot
Off top, I want everything that little mommy got
And if I look sober that means I'm probably not

[Chorus: Method Man]
From New York to the Bay yo
Sao Paulo to L.A. yo
Nobody move until we say so
They wanna know who got that N.A.S.A. music
From New York to the Bay yo
Sao Paulo to L.A. yo
Nobody move until we say so
They wanna know who got that N.A.S.A. music

[Bridge: E-40]
N.A.S.A. Music
N.A.S.A. Music
N.A.S.A. Music
N.A.S.A. Music

[Verse 3: Method Man]
I'm with the kid from The Yay, 40 Water man I'm missing them days
When we took swallows of the good life and pissed it away
Real drama daddy listen to Sway
He got the kid from the Big Apple with the biggest fish in the bay
We off the books money, now look money see I ain't laughing when it look funny
Or at them funny niggas that took from me
That's why the crook of the crooks honey, I'm hungry
Trying to find this snow bunny to cook for me
This nigga got his own repertoire, a beast and I rep, blase blah
The greatest Allahu Akbar!
What's famous when you're dangerous and what's a star
When the cops hate us cause of who the fuck we are?
If I was Paris Hilton you wouldn't stop my car
You'd be in the passenger seat trying to pop a bra ngga
I play for keeps while y'all just play
With Crack Alley Music got em hooked N.A.S.A

[Chorus: Method Man]
From New York to the Bay yo
Sao Paulo to L.A. yo
Nobody move until we say so
They wanna know who got that N.A.S.A. music
From New York to the Bay yo
Sao Paulo to L.A. yo
Nobody move until we say so
They wanna know who got that N.A.S.A. music

[Bridge: E-40]
N.A.S.A. Music
N.A.S.A. Music
N.A.S.A. Music
N.A.S.A. Music

[Outro: Method Man]
Y'all thought it was safe muhfuckers
Aww shit we bridging the gap
West coast, West coast, let's go
