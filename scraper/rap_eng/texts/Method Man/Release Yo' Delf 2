Blue Raspberry:
When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab, like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you like Tical, and it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry, your careers won't be lasting long

When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified

Method Man:
Check it, I'm the fucking man who they mention
Notice, that other niggas rap styles is bogus
Doo-doo, prepare for this verse Tical voodoo
Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, 'cause I be that house over water
Forgot in the realm that be deep as the Poseidon
Adventure, niggas need to touch they freaking picture
For the sickness, that be spreading with the quickness
Remedies, cousin I be doing on my enemies
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, rushing through your down street vicinity
Blunt smoke, in the air reveals my identity

(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it movin, we keep it movin uh
Keep it movin and keep it movin uh
Keep it movin, baby, we be movin uh
Keep it movin, we keep it huh RHARHHH

What's that rhythm what's that sound
Party people getting down
When it hit the baddest man
Just release, yo delf!!

My God, somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he fronting, on any man down with the Clan
I be coming, for the headpiece you can't cope for my brother
I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial, killer, style from Big Isle No Stat
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas looking all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigger
Because they got the finger on the trigger of a pistol
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Then I add a snapple, nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
Then we try to overthrow the castle
Better yet the tent when I'm coming to your town
Black man, the rental, God, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from GLOCK then beware
I buck shots, we move up, the buck stops here
No more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by hoes

What's that rhythm what's that sound
Party people getting down
When it hit the baddest man
Just breathe in, till then

And keep it moving, baby keep it moving
I plan to keep it moving, you know we keep it movin uh
And keep it moving, baby we be moving uh
And keep it moving, you know we keep it moving uh
And keep it moving, you know we keep it moving
Baby we be moving, you know we keep it moo..RARHRAH

Throw your hands in the sky
And wave em from side to side
And if you're ready to spark up the Meth-Tical
Let me hear you say stimuli
