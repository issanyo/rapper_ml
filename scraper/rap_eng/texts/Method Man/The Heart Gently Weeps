Shh, shh, shh, shh, Wu, Wu, Tang, Tang

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
The joy the flowers bring me
The pain still has me sinking
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinking
The tears in your eyes are twinkling
Because the heart gently weeps

[Raekwon the Chef]
Snowy night, fiends basin', A Raisin in the Sun was amazing
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell, and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight whylin
Robbin everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabbed her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all "A-trainers"
Who got reluct', think fast and blast from Beamers

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushin the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusin from hittin that bark
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle bustin them paper towels and wipin my Wally's down
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holdin a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
{*singing*} That bitch is crazyyyyy
And uh, she brought her babyyyyy
She knew I had the murderous smack
It killed her man though
Now I got his fuckin' nephew grippin' his gat
You's a bitch - {*singing*} you better kill meeeee
You know you're bootyyyyyy
You pulled your toolie, out on meeeee... motherfucker
First thought was to snatch the ratchet
Said fuck it and fuckin grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fuckin laughin
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint, so I fuckin bit him
Shots was whizzin, hittin Clorox bottles
Customers screamin, then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper, "A man who came to kill gets knocked out"

[Interlude: Erykah Badu]
I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and it's so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life

[Method Man]
Yo, ayo, yo, yo
You on your way to the store nigga grab me a Dutch
I'm mad as fuck, my dude
My count was short when I was baggin it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown?
The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hasslin us
This motherfucker got balls
Even the gall to try and pattin me up
Time to re-up, let these niggas know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack, crack in the spot

[Interlude: Erykah Badu]
I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and it's so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
The joy the flowers bring me
The pain still has me sinking
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinking
The tears in your eyes are twinkling
Because the heart gently weeps
