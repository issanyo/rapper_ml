[METHOD MAN] - All Verses

Doctor P you ready
Mr. F you on deck
Meth, check that

Mr. F, what, Meth, huh, P (get 'em)
Mr. F, uh, Meth, what, P (get 'em)
Mr. F, what, Meth, huh, P (get 'em)

Mr. F, what, Meth, huh, P (get 'em)
Mr. F, what, Meth, huh, P (yea)
Mr. F, what, Meth, huh, P (get 'em)
I dont think they ready for this one

Drinks down, man up
Circle round, stand up
Pimps up, hands down
Beat 'em up, man down
No hands in the air, no need for pumping your fists
Method Man tear the roof off
Jump in the pit

Everbody in the moshpit (moshpit)
Lets make this club move like we got something to prove (mosh)
Everbody in the moshpit (moshpit)
Is there something wrong with me, or is there something wrong with you (mosh)
Everbody in the moshpit (moshpit)
It's all true, you already know what to do
No hands in the air, no need for pumping your fists
Method Man tear the roof off
Jump in the pit

First of all, how many first to brawl
If you try and break something, I'm the first you call
My shovel ready if any dirt's involved
And I euthenize rappers that try and hurt my dog (woof)
I off the lame that think I'm off my game, killer thoughts (chika-bow)
And get it off your brain
Them dudes cost money, but love don't cost a thing
But it might cost your life, you don't come up off the chain

Drinks down, man up
Circle round, stand up
Pimps up, hands down
Beat 'em up, man down
No hands in the air, no need for pumping your fists
Method Man tear the roof off
Jump in the pit

Everbody in the moshpit (moshpit)
Lets make this club move like we got something to prove (mosh)
Everbody in the moshpit (moshpit)
Is there something wrong with me, or is there something wrong with you (mosh)
Everbody in the moshpit (moshpit)
It's all true, you already know what to do
No hands in the air, no need for pumping your fists
Method Man tear the roof off
Jump in the pit

I'm like Jesus, you come across my name
Fast and Furious than any that cut across my lane
House of Pain that have an ounce of Jane
No raincoat for haters that try and doubt my reign
Adam F, Mr. Meth and Doc P
The people need a reason to mosh, they got three
We live by the code, my killers locked and load
If the bitch catch fire, stop drop and roll

Drinks down, man up
Circle round, stand up
Pimps up, hands down
Beat 'em up, man down
Drinks down, man up
Circle round, stand up
Pimps up, hands down
Beat 'em up, man down
No hands in the air, no need for pumping your fists
No no no hands in the air, no need for pumping your fists
No no no hands in the air, no need for pumping your fists
Method Man tear the roof off
Jump in the pit
