[Intro]
Ice cream!
Ice cream!
Mom!
Throw down some money!
The ice cream man is coming!

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Brothers don't know how to flow, like "oh
Shit, I can dip
I'm a hip hop pro"
Who wanna get fucked, the hunt that bucks the buck
Viva like a squirrel, and get a nut, niggy nut
Over huffing, puffing
Blow me like down and
Inside, outside, bring me back around
And bam!, out the fucking sky like shazam!
You don't know, I tell you who I am
The drifty, shifty
Killer rhyme swiftly
So much funk, the method true
Let's get lifty
Not dusted
Cause that'll wreck your mental
Thus get me flustered, looking Oriental
That's when I'm Fu Manchu from the Wu-
Tang!, put me in the chamber, now bang
Zoom!, to the fucking moon I boom
Don't crowd my mic, alright, give me room
And I'll show you holmes, how a Meth should be born
Cuz when I flip God, I'm as hard as a stone
Rolling, rolling, rolling
Bitch I'll have them pussy lips swollen!
On the trigger
Your bigger
Now how you figure that
My click got more figures
Than you got nigga naps
And curiosity, what, killed the cat
Satisfaction, brought that cat back
And I'll come back, as the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes
They nothin' in the morning like H.O
Yo
Got to go, Got to go!
Ima stop it
And drop it like so!

[Hook]
Ma! Ma!
Throw down some money!
The ice cream man is coming!

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Do ya
Do ya
Do ya
Do ya
Do ya
Do ya danger!
Here comes another Wu-Tang head banger!
Straight from the panty, ante, man
And brother can you dig it, like my man Digger Dan
When I shoot that clip, I be trigger happy, man
Never comb my hair, keep it nigga nappy, man
Give me a light to spark the bone, true
I can be the microphone, one, two, check
The Method, make me wanna wreck shit for
Wu-Tang squad, keep it hard to the core
Midnight hour, fresh out the shower
I be man, He-Man, I got the power
To get ill, pardon me as I show my skill
And still, I got too
Real
On a lyric, on it, raw deal
Then it gets fat
I guess it wasn't on the pill
Like Cypress Hill said
Well "I Could Just Kill A Man"
Fill it full of lead, nobody can get iller than
The jack mover, word up, it's a stick up
Try any fancy moves, you get licked up
By the majestic smoker of the method
Bone, and I'm known to like
Wreck shit well!

[Hook/Outro]
