[James]
You sure you're ready for this, Meth?

[Method Man]
Born ready, brother. Let's get it

[James]
Alright, Josh, give me a beat

[Round 1: James]
I can't believe I'm battling you, no lie
I was like "oh my god, Method Man, is he still alive?"
Another washed up rapper, just a Wu-Tang disaster
Your phone only rings when the RZA won't answer
GZA, Ghost, and Rae are all better than you
Top five of all time, you're not top five in your crew
Are you anywhere as you were 20 years ago?
Yippie yippie yay, yippie yi, yippie no

[James]
No

[Method Man]
Oh wow, that was--that was good. That was--that was really good. I'm gonna kill this guy. Josh, if you will

[Round 1: Method Man]
First of all, you don't wanna get stretched in here
I'd break your neck, but you ain't had a neck in years
Sir [Picks?]-a-Lot, you're goin' 'gainst the best, it's clear
Baby Got Back? No, baby got breasts, it's weird
You don't like that, don't be trying to talk and provoke me
I heard you're trying to lose weight, trying Walking Karaoke
You don't know me, leave the rap to the professionals
And James, keep some rap with extra chicken and some vegetables, oh

[James]
Alright, Josh

[Round 2: James]
Yeah, you got me, Meth, I am a bit chubby
But I can lose weight, you can't lose ugly
I would guess you were a victim of a bear attack
If a bear saw you, it'd be like "ugh, I'm not touchin' that"
Yeah, you walk like a tough guy, you're softer than me
He called me crying, "James, please put me on TV"
So I hired this boy, 'cause I'm a nice guy
Now when I say jump, he says "How High?"

[James & the crowd]
Yeah
'Cause when I say jump, he says How High!
Yeah, when I say jump, he says How High!
Yeah, when I say jump, he says How High!
Yeah, when I say jump, he--what!

[Method Man]
Oh wow, that was... That was pretty original right there. And you incorporated the crowd into it, that was good. Now all of y'all gotta die with him. Alright, J, let's get it

[Round 2: Method Man]
Ayo, James is a loser with no friends, I'm sayin'
Reggie even said you're only friends because you pay him
But I don't slay 'em, and I spit it verbatim
If these words got you sick to your stomach, it's 'cause you ate 'em
Probably eat 'till nothing's left, let me guess
Your favorite Wu member's probably Raekwon the Chef, okay
Holy fatty foods, Batman, you're fat, man
Tell whoever hired your ghostwriter to pack, man

[Method Man]
Waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka booo booo

[James]
Alright. Alright. Josh, hit it

[Round 3: James]
You thought you'd win easy, you're in for a shock tonight
'Cause I'm cookin' Meth better than Walter White
His real name's Cliff, I swear that's true
Like what I want to jump off every time I see you
Your sitcom, Red & Meth, didn't really last
Featured two great rappers and zero great laughs
I just murdered you, it's time to say goodbye
Now all, I need, is for you, to die

[James with the crowd]
And everybody say
All, I need, is for you, to die

[Method Man]
Mm, mm, mm. That was really, really, really good. That was good. That's my mom's favorite song, but that was good. That was good. Josh, if you will

[Round 3: Method Man]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, talk is cheap in English
You lost to Anne Hathaway, Kevin Hart was dangerous
Schwimmer was a winner, Delevingne outrageous
Usain Bolt killed you, he 'on't e'en speak the language
Goofy, you done gon' and stepped in a pile of dookie
Wiped off the dookie, then stepped in a bigger pile of dookie
After this loss, bye, go walk it off
Ayo, Reggie, that's the way you talk to your boss
