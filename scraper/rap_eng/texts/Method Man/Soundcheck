Players get ejected out, the game that’s a tec tec
Mayweather fight night homie, I’m still you best bet
I’m like the homie 2 chains on’me
Protect your neck, neck
Opposites attract, I got you standing opposite, the mack
Cops pursuing, now I am swallowing the crack
This ain’t your role model on the track, simple fact
This is call of duty, watch my gun nozzle through the map map
It’s all about survival where we at
That’s the reason why my father kept the rifle plus a bible on his lap
Hallelujah, I am playing my position, karma sutra
And anybody play me out position ima shoot ya

Take it back to Gucci mocks, polo rugby Glocks
With 21 shots, I am very dirty money

Where they made a lucky man out of Charlie Luciano

Aim for the face, but his neck next
Promises promises, well baby boy, this is not a death threat
