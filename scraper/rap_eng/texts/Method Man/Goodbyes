[Chorus]
It's been a long time
Since I've been on your mind
I hope you're feeling alright
'Cause I won't say no goodbyes
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you should probably bump this
Bass up speakers in the trunk shit
Bangin' in the spot, hands up on the fun tip
Jumpin', I've been on my day one shit
As a young kid, all up in the city doin' dumb shit
Uh, I been tight, never stretch 'em out
Beast in the streets man, should've never let him out
Swag, lemme show you what the fresh about
High end only, you can't cut the treble out
I stay wavy on the late tip
Techno, two-steppin' in the basement
In the bathroom, prolly gettin' faded
Until the day hits, hope you got some shades, kid

[Chorus]
It's been a long time
Since I been on your mind
I hope you're feeling alright
Cause I won't say no goodbyes
Yeah

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Adios, sayonara, dosvedanya
Hasta luego, au revoir, t√∫ sabe' fuego
See ya' later, alligators, can get my huevos
My girl a winna, just a killa, I'm Jose Cuervo
I say tomato, you say tomato
Might be gone today, but you back tomorrow
You know the motto, the truth is harder to swallow
My story harder to follow when you ain't part of the novel, no
I'm pleadin' the fifth, y'all can sleep with the fish
Leave a rapper bleedin' for this, I'm called the flow killa
Like cheetah, I'm swift, I'ma eat if you slip
Betta yet, I'm like an ape in the mist, y'all, I go rilla
Me and The Knocks, we put a key in the locks
What's good, bruv, totin' c on the blocks
S'all ove, sip the tea in the pot
I can't stop for no reason, 'cause ain't got no reason to stop, Meth'

[Chorus]
It's been a long time
Since I've been on your mind
I hope you're feeling alright
'Cause I won't say no goodbyes
(Goodbyes, goodbyes)

[Bridge]
I don't say no goodbyes
I don't say no good-good
I don't say no goodbyes
Oh, no, no, no
I don't say no goodbyes
I don't-I don't good-good
I don't say no goodbyes
Oh, no, no, no

[Chorus]
It's been a long time
Since I've been on your mind
I hope you're feeling alright
'Cause I won't say no goodbyes
