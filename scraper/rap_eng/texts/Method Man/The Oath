[Intro: The Night's Watch Oath]
Night gathers, and now my watch begins
It shall not end until my death
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory
I shall live and die at my post
I am the sword in the darkness
I am the watcher on the walls
I am the shield that guards the realms of men
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch
For this night and all the nights to come

[Verse 1]
Night gathers, my watch begins
To manifest 'til death, and it shall not end
I take no wife, no land, father no children
I wear no crown, win no glory and I shall not bend
I am the shield  that's here to guard the realms of men
I been in hell, while they're asking where the hell I've been
I am the sword in the darkness, the watcher of all
That means I'm heartless, bigger they come harder they fall
I pledge my life and my honor to the Night's watch
For this night and nights to come I give my life, watch
See the black crow, watch it revolve
Some call us black brothers
Ice watch, colder than yours, we wear them black colors

[Hook]
Are you even man enough to take the oath
Man enough to take a dagger to a throat
Or are you only man enough when it matters the most?
Whats the matter?
You was thinking your life mattered? It don't

[Interlude]
Do you know what leadership means?
It means that the person in charge gets second guessed by every little twat with a mouth
But if he starts second guessing himself, that's the end

[Bridge][x2]
I am the sword in the darkness, the watcher of all
That means I'm heartless, bigger they come harder they fall
(Night Watch)(x2)

[Hook]

[Outro]
This is not the end, not for us
Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back
