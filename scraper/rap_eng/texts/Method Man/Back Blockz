[Intro: Youngin]
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Ha!

[Chorus: Youngin]
Young nigga jookin' on the back block (Back block)
In the kitchen whippin' 'til my hands hurt (Hands hurt)
Foreign door, push got the trap spot (Trap spot)
Couple nights shovin' hard by my damn self (Damn self)
By my damn self, out there by my damn self
I remember I was goin' hard by my damn self
My damn self, I did by my damn self
I remember niggas had me out there by my damn self (Ha!)

[Verse 1: Cardi Express]
Break a moment of silence
I ain't dead, my life is frozen 'cause I'm goin' through it
Niggas sendin' threats, it's only right that I'ma hold 'em to it
I ain't scared, I fear for whoever say they owned up to it
We don't hold grudges, they just shootin' 'cause I told 'em, "Do it"
Say the wrong name and now he goin' on a killin' spree
Get it playin' cutthroat, they don't wanna deal with me
I got 'em creepin' wit' these murderer intentions
Your hood is full of pussy, I be on it when the shift end
I'm close to the edge, so why you guys pushin'? (Woo)
Ten thousand strong, Leonidas got his life tookin' (Uh huh)
They say it's good to grieve on a full stomach
Droppin' the audacity of hope is what the hood wanted
Tryna figure out what's acceptable
The man behind the Cardigan, that album is impeccable
My niggas got the loud homie, if it's stressin' you
We lampin' in the isles, bring the papers and the Method through

[Segue: Method Man]
It's family, nigga, break 'em
Just when you thought you had all the answers
We changed the fuckin' question

[Chorus: Youngin]
Young nigga jookin' on the back block (Back block)
In the kitchen whippin' 'til my hands hurt (Hands hurt)
Foreign door, push got the trap spot (Trap spot)
Couple nights shovin' hard by my damn self (Damn self)
By my damn self, out there by my damn self
I remember I was goin' hard by my damn self
My damn self, I did by my damn self
I remember niggas had me out there by my damn self (Ha!)

[Verse 2: F.R.E.A.K.]
I'm writin' scriptures, but they'll never quote it
I'll always tuckin' for any nigga who say he want it
A moment, 'cause my father never claimed a fool
A full breed in a pit of bulls
We ain't got shit to prove (Facts)
I know some niggas who can't read but they can stitch a bone
I'm laughin' at you niggas flippin' rules
My uncle Carl told me stick and move
It's young F.R.E.A.K. though
Got these niggas tuckin' they chains like I was Deebo
Ran through the Carter like Nino, just me and Geek though
On the set I'm sendin' 'em slugs to free my 'migos  (Shee)
This back block deserted like Baghdad
I'll be damned if they flash cash
Reps comin' equipped wit' a gas mask
See a killer but don't push me (Nah) and cash rules
I'm outta my mind, play with my grind, I'm on my bully (Shee)
See when y'all was tellin' stories 'round the campfire
We was havin' shootouts, my whole camp fired

[Chorus: Youngin]
Young nigga jookin' on the back block (Back block)
In the kitchen whippin' 'til my hands hurt (Hands hurt)
Foreign door, push got the trap spot (Trap spot)
Couple nights shovin' hard by my damn self (Damn self)
By my damn self, out there by my damn self
I remember I was goin' hard by my damn self
My damn self, I did by my damn self
I remember niggas had me out there by my damn self (Ha!)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Another day in the life
Uncle Meth but this time I brought the family in
Murder was the case, you can't relate? Then you ain't family then (Nuh-uh)
Not even a cousin, Auntie Em or even family friend
Plan we in come with the ratchets, we some handymen
Got my nephew in the Uber with them shooters
Got my dawg on Eukanuba, put a shot through your medulla
I don't hate you moolies, just an addict for the moolah
To my cash rulers, never give a package to a user (Nah)
That's my position, opposition can't maneuver
That's a clue to why I'm sittin' in position to manure (Pfft)
No Kamasutra, get your karma, you basura
I mean garbage and there's clearly nothin' promised in your future
Look at this old head drippin' on a back block (Back block)
Rich, workin', like he whippin' up a crack rock (Crack rock)
Fresh out the pot, pack flippin', make the trap hot
And the family hustle kinda tiny but the stack not

[Chorus: Youngin]
Young nigga jookin' on the back block (Back block)
In the kitchen whippin' 'til my hands hurt (Hands hurt)
Foreign door, push got the trap spot (Trap spot)
Couple nights shovin' hard by my damn self (Damn self)
By my damn self, out there by my damn self
I remember I was goin' hard by my damn self
My damn self, I did by my damn self
I remember niggas had me out there by my damn self (Ha!)
