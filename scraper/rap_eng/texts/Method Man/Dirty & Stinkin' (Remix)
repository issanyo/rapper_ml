[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
This recordin is dirty and it's stinkin
Funkier than Peppi Le Pew so I was thinkin, about
Droppin this single on the charts, lettin ya know
Hey, the kid has heart, I never deny myself as being
Dope, but in my last jam, niggas slept on my notes
You thought that I was weak? Huh? Let me speak
My rhymes come funkier than ya grandfathers feet
So listen mister, don't you ever forget
The rhyme is dirty, you couldn't even clean it
With Comet, for even Wolrex, some tried Ajax
Only mix with the best, forty-eight tracks
Yo, I get down with the Ason sounds
Lyrics that be flowin from miles around
So let the music shut ya ass up, then feel the uppercut
Now I make ya fall to ya butt

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, let me continue, verse number two
Style is wild, dirty and stinkin like doo-doo
If ya hangin around, ya changed ya mind
It is a bad influence, but yo it's my rhyme
I sit down and I say to myself, "Self
Yo, are you rated top the shelf?"
I drop the single for you to get a dose of
As I lay back like a pillow on a sofa
Gettin paid? Yeah right, Willy
Why askin me, G? What? What? What? What? You know me
My mouth is sugar, sweet as a honey bee
Taste like a forty, stinkin like Old-E
But I drink Ol' English so I speak Ol' English
You gotta be dirty and stinkish
And if it's not, well I guess I'm not
The A-S-O-N my friends, it's dirty and it's stinkin'

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
I'm not a statuatory raper
I'm _naughty_, but girl that ain't my _nature_
Johnny Cash all about this paper
You playin' wit the big boys now, we rated r
This no place for a child, 17, not allowed
Without a parent and it's apparent that you belong
Wit a full grown man wit a mind just as strong
Huh, so here's ya chance to advance
Get in ya stance and we gon' set up it off like true romance
And that's my word
