[Verse 1: Biggie Smalls]
Your reign on the top was short, like Leprechauns
As I crush so called Willies, Thugs & Rapper Dons
Get in that ass quick, fast, like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon
(It's that rap phenomenon)

[Hook: Muppets + Biggie Smalls]
Doo doo, doo doo do
(Phenomenon)
Doo doo do doo
(Phenomenon!)
Doo doo dooo doo do, doo doo doo doo do doo doo doo doo doo!
*grunt*

[Verse 2: Biggie Smalls + Method Man]
(I got more Glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot (Nigga won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me
In the head
Or motherfucker's dead
Irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon

[Hook: Muppets + Biggie Smalls]

[Outro: Statler & (Waldorf)]
(That was wonderful!) Bravo! (I loved it!) Ah, it was great!
(Well, it was pretty good.) Well, it wasn't bad
(Uh, there were parts of it that weren't very good, though) It could have been a lot better. (I didn't really like it.) It was pretty terrible
(It was bad.) It was awful! (It was terrible!) Take 'em away!
(Hey, boo!) Boo!
