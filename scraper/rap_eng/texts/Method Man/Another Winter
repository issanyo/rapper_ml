(Intro)
Quick to pop off let a couple shots off
Leave ‘em bleeding out with his shoes & his socks off

(Verse 1 – Streetlife)
War dancing. I ain’t trying to make it rain though
You slow gassing. I’ll leave you brain on your Durango
First classmen, old school with the Kangol
Thug passion, that pussy juice like a mango
Hulk smashing, make it jump like everlasting
God body Ramadan, 30 day fasting
Six two brown skin fellow with the Caesar fade
360 waves, side burns with a little graze
I remain relevant; I’m a raw element
High street intelligent. Product of my tenement
Son of Anarchy, smoking that Bob Marley
La la la be killing these niggas slowly
Wake up, smell the coffee, sleep on the street is costly
Pay attention to the warning signs, don’t cross me
Give ‘em hypertention. That niggas is getting salty
I’m quick to pop off back the fuck up off me

(Chorus - Carlton Fisk)
Carlton Fisk banana clip silver back gorilla
Mr. Streetlife show you what that heat like

(Chorus - Hanz On)
Hanz on yo we handle them Berettas PLO
Yo its forever, bout to show em what it be’s like

(Chorus - Method Man)
Method man, turn a dollar to a million
Killa bees we in the building
Making sure the children eat right eat right
In the building make sure the babies eat right

(Chorus - Hanz On)
In the building make sure the babies eat right

(Verse 2 - Carlton Fisk)
Black scenery white chalk yellow tape
Carlo got a bullet proof wallet, bitch in every state
Light that smoke that animals ferocious
Dealing with the boss mentality really focus
Tailor made linen & loafers, louie emblems
Problems on the street my lieutenant quickly attending them
Carlito ways, brown bag money
In the book of life you can’t get stuck to one page
All in together now, chinchilla bullet proof
Hoodies for any sign of winter war weather
And daddy gonna get that cash so clever
And Meth push the button my hands all on the trigger
And they thought I rot in jail, like go figure
If I laid down dead in the street you going too nigga
And this is raw kicking out your door start to scream out loud
Carlton Fisk back for more

(Chorus - Carlton Fisk)
Carlton Fisk banana clip silver back gorilla
Mr. Streetlife show you what that heat like

(Chorus - Hanz On)
Hanz on yo we handle them Berettas PLO
Yo its forever, bout to show em what it be’s like

(Chorus - Method Man)
Method man, turn a dollar to a million
Killa bees we in the building
Making sure the children eat right eat right

(Chorus - Hanz On)
In the building make sure the babies eat right

(Verse 3 - Method Man)
Now whoever read me wrong, can start by reading my palm
Make me catch a flashback of my father beating my mom
Kiss the ring, (hashtag) ain’t easy being a don
So I gotta carry the heat, ain't easy being LeBron
This is past rap, but I ain’t pass the baton
Tell them rappers bypass it or get to passing it on
I won’t take it passed that, even if I pass it I’m gone
Better yet, scratch that, ya’ll don’t get a pass then it’s on
We Hanz On, everybody watchin the Don
Got their eyes on the kid when they should be watchin their own
Telling lies on the kid, they said he’s not in a zone
Said he never reach the top, but that ain’t stop him from going
They already on, so hungry his ribs are showin
The money is getting low, the bum niggas is on
55 Bowen
These hungry adolescents is grown
When they get the Smith & Wesson they adolescence is gone

(Chorus - Carlton Fisk)
Carlton Fisk banana clip silver back gorilla
Mr. Streetlife show you what that heat like

(Chorus - Hanz On)
Hanz on yo we handle them Berettas PLO
Yo its forever, bout to show em what it be’s like

(Chorus - Method Man)
Method man, turn a dollar to a million
Killa bees we in the building
Making sure the children eat right eat right
In the building make sure the babies eat right

(Chorus - Hanz On)
In the building make sure the babies eat right
