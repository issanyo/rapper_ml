[Janet Jackson]
Hello? Are you there?
Hello, hello, hello?
See, Meth, see, that's exactly what I’m talking about
You ask me to call you and you can't even answer the phone
You may be Mr. Mef, okay, but I'm Miss Jackson
And you ain’t done shit for me lately *laughs*
But you know I love you anyway, so give me a call
It's me, Janet
Bye
