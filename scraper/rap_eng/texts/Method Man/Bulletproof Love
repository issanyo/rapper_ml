[Intro: Method Man]
Yo, Sway, man. I can't even describe it, man
The situation was crazy, bruh
If I was a gorilla, I would say it was bananas, B
For real, the man just- he just took over the whole situation, god Listen

[Verse: Method Man]
Man, it is what it is
Can't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived
Roaches in the crib, ain't got no food up in the fridge
Plus the crime running rampant and it's screwing up the kids
Sway, admit, what kind of paradise is this?
I just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist
But these snakes is trying to gather in the pit
When you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip
Off the rip, now a challenger exists
And he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this?
Got thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips
Saying, "empty out the drawer" before he pound you with the grip
Lord, who to call when no one obeys the law
And there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all?
Power to the people and Luke Cage the cause
And the cops got it wrong, we don't think Cage involved
Look, dog, a hero, never had one
Already took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one
I beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one
Now we got a hero for hire and he a black one
And bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion
We in Harlem's Paradise, tell the Captain
That I'm about to trade the mic for a Magnum
Give up my life for Trayvon to have one

[Hook: Method Man]
Yeah, 'cause this is bulletproof love
And you already know what a bulletproof does
So you can take it from a bulletproof thug
The hood got his back, dog, bulletproof love
The blood thicker than mud
And who am I to judge if you get a gun in the club?
'Cause you already know what a bulletproof does
When the hood got your back, dog, bulletproof love

[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, shoutout to Pop
RIP, my brother
The streets is crazy nowadays
People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one Whether you like it or not
Luke Cage, please believe it, sir
The streets got your back
You already bulletproof love, baby
