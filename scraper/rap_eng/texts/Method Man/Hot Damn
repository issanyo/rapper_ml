[Verse 1: Blimes Brixton]
I never wore a ruby slipper
Fuck is a silver spoon
Silverstone ain't my sister
Take your ‘tude and get a tomb
I should get a room with myself, help
Is that over the top, shelf, well
Naw I’m sexy as this beat is
Strong as these feet is
They call me baby, yeah, like I’m a fetus
Jesus Christ with it, she too nice with it
I like my Brandy with no ice in it
Yeah, so you could take it back to the bar if you did that
Ima take it back to these bars
Give em casualty scars
I’m going casually hard
‘Cause I’m not about to flex ‘till I master it all

[Hook x 2 - Blimes & Method Man]
Hot damn, you got goals to Japan
I wanna be part of the plan
Naw you should make your own moves
And Imma do what I do aight dude coo
Hot damn, you got goals to Japan
I wanna be part of the plan
Naw you should make your own moves
And Imma do what I do aight dude coo


[Verse 2 - Method Man]
I never had a good Christmas
What is a Santa Claus?
Never on nobody gift list
Can’t understand it all
First chick I shared a kiss with
I took her panties off
Caught her with her skirt lifted
And pissed her granny off
All my life been a misfit
Misguided into mischief
The truth is I only lie to my mistress
When I'm puffin' a lot
You can lie with the fishes
Blimes got them biscuits
You can die in this Bisquick
Now let that bass hit your face
Got you monkeys insecure, it’s a ape
Gorillas in the mist it’s a trait
Them ain't air force ones it’s a bape
I ain’t write this with a pen it’s a vape
You getting free smoke picture Drake
You dudes is lookin’ broke fix your face
This is merely food for thought
Fix a plate
I need order in the court and the case
From the Verrazano to the Golden Gate
Hot damn

[Hook x 7 - Blimes & Method Man]
Hot damn, you got goals to Japan
I wanna be part of the plan
Naw you should make your own moves
And Imma do what I do aight dude coo
Hot damn, you got goals to Japan
I wanna be part of the plan
Naw you should make your own moves
And Imma do what I do aight dude coo
