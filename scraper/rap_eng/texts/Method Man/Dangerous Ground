Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo
All them real live motherfuckin' niggas
Step up front right now, it's goin' down
One love to Long Island, Hempstead in my heart, baby
Shaolin what? Come on, come on

Dangerous ground, tre pound, seven spin around
For my bredren the clouds come down
War and peace, I take it to the street
Land shark on my lawn, chop the thumbs off a thief
And curse his first born, is this thing on?
Send 'em to the children of the corn we the people

See, niggas through the eye of the Demon
My lethal injection, destroyin' evil
Hot Nikkel, private eye, one pistol
Aimin' at your brain tissue, do or die

Said the spider to the fly, "Could this one be tasty?"
Like momma apple pie goodness, Johnny Blaze me
On the job like Dick Tracy
Hit the cure for that ill shit like Ben Casey, M.D

Symbolic thrill like God he shocked it
Like a finger in a light socket
Too good to be forgotten, in the rotten apple
I kick dirt on your sand castle, check the flavor all natural

(Beat your feet)
Hot Niks, son
(Heat-mizer)
Before you get the main course
(Taste a appetizer)

Submerged in the word
Heavy headed verbal that smack you
Mentally disturb you, attack you
Thirty-six chamb' once again comin' at you
Young gun got the body snatch you observe

Wise words you can only see through the third
I fall way beyond the norm on the verb
Shine on mental nourishment, you can dine on
Track yellin' at me, "Get yo [Incomprehensible], God"

[Incomprehensible] is hard, regardless to whom or what
They all movin' targets, Allah
Runnin' through your house and your block party, with rap shotty
And hot rock the body body, St. Bernards

Couldn't save your entourage, rap lobotomy
Leave ya mentally scarred, numb and possibly
Dumb deaf and blind, is it?
I kick the spine out the battery backs
Fuckin' with mine, keep it movin'

Now, everybody just throw your hands in the
What the fuck? Peace, who this?

Mind detect mind, I P.L.O. your startin' line, deep Space Nine
Designed for knuckleheads who bust guns and throw signs
Let's converse, snatch the tap from your purse
Body-surf on the verse head first

Peep defeat, bitch Street beat you down with the heat
And you spazzed out spittin' out teeth ain't nuttin' peace
Big boys don't destroy blunted zone pop steroid
50 men convoy, expensive where's the big toy

Rumble through the wasteland right hand's on the silencer
40 caliber city slicker Staten Islander
Synchronized minds combine thoughts that motivate
Don't perpetrate, pass the blunt let it circulate

Street politicians on a suicide mission
Crime vision finger itchin' from a scope-view position
Dangerous ground, tre pound, seven spin around
For my bredren the cloud comes down

Keep your eyes open, love potion
Number nine poetry in motion
Knowledge me the seventh sign
Scopin', connivin', infiltrate is most of mine
Play 'em nonchalantly, calmly expose the nine

Push and get shoved what the fuck God's thinkin' of?
Comin' in the club wit that screw face, actin' up
Is we men or mice? Bad moon risin', we wild for the night
Kill a skitzofrenic, nigga twice 'cuz O
That's what happened when frontin' on the Shaol' borough

Island of Staten we in here no fear, assault wit intent
To kill your whole regiment [Incomprehensible]
Startin' wit yo president, duckin' my dart gun
Tear apart, son, you don't want it then don't start none

Blaze one with Jonathon, part man, part fly
Handle my B-I camouflage like G.I
Fat like Joe, a day in the life
Your money or your life that's the life
Everybody can't afford ice in the struggle
Tryin' to eat right another day another hustle, hustle, hustle

Dangerous ground, tre pound, seven spin around
For my bredren the clouds come down
War and peace, I take it to the street
Land shark on my lawn, chop the thumbs off a thief, motherfucker
