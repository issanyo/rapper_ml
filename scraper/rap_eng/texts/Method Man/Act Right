[Intro]
Yeah, that's right everybody get some act right"

[Verse 1]
Awww shit! Ya know the name
Who flip flows like chessboards, there go the games
I'm drugs to the brain
Even on the 14th of February I ain't got no love for a lame
Back doin' my thang, right
Livin' the fast life
Bitch grab a seat at the bar, get you some act right
If that don't do it then rock, lets bring it back like
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
Ever since I came up, rappers done changed up
Put your walking shoes back on and step your game up
I'm getting through off the books, rock we banked up
Y'all don't think my shit off the hook, then y'all can hang on
I'm like a king that's so fresh so clean
I leave niggas like black coffee, no cream
Come inside the party fuck up the whole scene
(That's right everybody get some act right)

[Hook]
Get up get up, ya know what we came here for
What up what up, get your asses out on the floor
Come on come on, I've been away for far too long
Guess who's back and far too strong for ya niggas (now)
We feelin' good tonight, we hittin' 'dro like
We gettin money and gettin' honeys that flow like
My mic, my clothes, my life, my dough
(That's right everybody get some act right)

[Verse 2]
Ya damned if you do, ya damned if you don't
Step inside my Range and get blammed if you won't
My Clan in the joint, man we got it locked
Like whatever niggas got in the bank, I got it stopped
Y'all already know of my strength already growin'
In this game many may come but few are chosen
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going like
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
I get tips from B.I.G. and Pac when they blastin' the heat
If you's a rapper, don't ever ride the passenger seat
One to grow on
When up shit's creek, you get your roll on
Boy I never stop, I go on, so on and so on
Rappers can't fuck with me
My career's like somebody put glue in your chair and now you're stuck with me
I don't use pick up lines, I guess I'm just picky
(That's right everybody get some act right)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Extra, extra read all about it
Who shits they grounded, flies all around it
My trees don't doubt it, they green as a salad
All American Express I never leave home without it
I'll never go pop, Meth Man I'm bout it
Whenever I rock, the jam's over crowded
I'm never gonna stop, the fans won't allow it
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
Yo, get it you got it, if you got it then good
(There's a lot of rappers rappin' but not a lot of 'em could)
I'm that boy in the hood that told Red Riding Hood
There ain't nothin' but wars in my neck of the woods
So! Who's ready for MC Whoa
What's beef? Beef is what I got teeth for
I eat up everything on my plate then eat yours like
(That's right everybody get some act right)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Stand up! Staten Island, Lond Island get some act right
Every borough, New Jersey get some act right
Each state, west coast, east coast, dirty south, midwest get some act right
If it ain't well, it ain't right
If it ain't Meth, it ain't tight
So on that note like this, everybody get some act right
