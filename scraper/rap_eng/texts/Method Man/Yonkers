[Intro]
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

[Verse 1]
Crime scene, coppers and sirens
Helicopters and high beams, the tensions is rising
Fiends keeping the pipe clean
This is what life means, a dollar and a dream
Everybody wants nice things
The kid was only nineteen, hole in his chest now
He's fighting, for his last breath
He's seeing death, it's frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening
You try to do the right thing? They do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream, sirens and light beams
Popping off bad shots, hitting people that they ain't mean to pop
The neighborhood’s in shock, block extremely hot
Another Black teen shot, that’s dull routine to cops
Make sure they got good grades, work the minimum wage
Now he’s laying on that stretcher, with nothing in him to save
Keep the ghetto, in whatever ghetto you at
Just don’t love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don’t love you back
You don’t live until you’ve made your first million
And top models wanna have your children
I thought I told you Wu Tang is for the children
Way before rap moved crack in your building
Yeah, now what’s the price of rice in China?
These women trying to raise the price on their vagina
Me? I’m trying to live the life and get the grind up
Like Diddy, but I ain’t trying to give the shine (Shyne) up
Poppa, pop-off no question, ya’ll dirty, like it raw, (no protection)
When the kid hold court, no objection
Meth needed money at the door, no exception
I go hard in the paint on a rapper
I go harder on a pussy no Viagra
You think I’m tripping, ain’t into tricking
But I keep a snow bunny in the kitchen
I’m the master like Killa
