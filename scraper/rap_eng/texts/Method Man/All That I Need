Chorus:
You're all I need to get by--
(x2)

Verse One:
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl
It's me in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man feel betta than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatevera
There's a few things dat's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
Dat's why I'm witchu til dis day Boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say "Baby it'll be okay."
Now dat's real to a brotha like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib wit thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Jus be there for me I'm a make sure we
Be livin in the fucking lap of luxury
I'm realizing dat cha didn't have to fuck wit me
But cha did now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

Mary J Blidge:
Like sweet morning dew
I took 1 look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice to you
Dedicate my life to you

Verse Two:
I got a love jonez for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on da bone
Plus I love da fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got dat good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in da world
Rockin three fourths of cloth never showin' your stuff off, Boo
It be true me for you dat's how it is
I can be your knower you can be my Wiz
Then I can be your sun, you can be my Earth
Resurrect the God through birth, best believe
Chorus
