Twenty seconds on the back time

I feel you're on the run
Never lived too long to make right
I see you're doing fine
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide I can no longer run (oh no no no)
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide for it's no longer fun (oh no no no)

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

What I am is what you want to be
Now that I'm not there
Took the tables away from you
It's turned and I don't care
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide I can no longer run (oh no no no)
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide for it's no longer fun (oh no no no)

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

I've said goodnight try to sleep tight
Oh, just dream of me
Go close your eyes cause I'll close mine
The sun will shine from time to time
Will you dream of me again

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you
