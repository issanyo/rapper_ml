[Method Man]
I'm the bastard, the total package like Lex Luger
Pull a sting like a yellow jacket, making maneuver
Through the slum nigga Iron Lung
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my torture chamber
Pit and the pendulum, foul play
T:2000 be "Judgment Day", face millennium, hell to pay
My knuckles soft from these Star Wars of Han Solo
Southpaw, ring your bell like it's Quasimodo
What is the law? Stay hardcore my Clan logo
Move to quick to catch a photo
Jetting on land like Jet Moto
Now we roll up on the conduit
These niggas actin like they been through it;
As if they heart beat the truest
I +Can't Lose+ like +Parker Lewis+, set in my ways
Got you corny niggas askin who is .. Johnny Blaze?
Get a late pass stankin-ass (ha) sucker ass
Now you sufferin like succotash (wha-what-what)
While Johnny Cash makin moves on your moneybag
I'm strip clubbin stickin hundreds in yo' honey ass
My brothers buggin in the background, holdin me down
Watchin these clowns as they eyeball I pay it no mind
Gettin high y'all - look at the scaffold
The night tall rap infected get the Lysol
To disinfect it you don't know me or my effin Method
That's the shit that made me ticked
When I throw the pitch, how many catch it?
Stapleton, the Wild West Park Hill
Port Richmond, Now Born, Jungle Nils
One mo' gaen - hit me with that SHIT they be smokin
Got Cali niggas loc'n, New York niggas open
John Jay phenomenon, the mega-bomb
Transformed into firearm (pow) like Megatron
You get stepped on and shit upon, I'm still calm
Knowin brothers wanna do me harm - Shaolin what?

(Shaolin what, huh?) {​*breaking glass*}​
Y'all niggas make room for daddy, for real
(Holla if you hear me)
We got love for those that got love for us
(Show your lust; your best bet is to roll with us)
Now go to your room (hang it up)
