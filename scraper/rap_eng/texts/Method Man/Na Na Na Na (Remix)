[Chorus: 112]
Girl, na na na
Little girl what you're doin' to me
Girl, you're lookin' so sexy
When you're doin' that dance for me

Ooh, now that I've got you baby
You know we gotta keep it sexy
Touchin' all over me

Lady, won't you take my hand
Let's go to V.I.P
I don't think you understand
What you are doin' to me

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
Yo, I got my mind made up, come on, you can get it
Five five kitted and a set of keys with it
I talk like I live it, til you walk like I hit it
Even handcuff your wizes for a conjugle visit
No, better yet, say I make you queen for a day
Yes, first draft pick on my team, wanna play?
Because I play to win, but when the games begin
Some women pretend, even say they on they friend
Uh-uh, no she didn't (God, yes, she did!)
Can you learn how I live, and don't address me kid
Your numbers on my hit list, mother, I'm the shit
Ma, scream if you with this, I cut you like a fish

[Chorus]
