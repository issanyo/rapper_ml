[Intro]
Hands up (Hands up)
Hands up (Hands up)
Hands up (Hands up)
Hands up (Hands up)
Hands up (Hands up)
Hands up (Hands up)
Hands up (Hands up)
(Go, go)
Oh, no-no-no
I can't feel my face
I need some more energy
Give me a shot then I’m goin' out in space
(Go, go)
Don't need no more, my head’s spinnin'
(Go, go)

[Chorus]
I lost my friends, where are we? (Where are they?)
I lost my phone, what happened? (What's goin' on?)
I'm drunk, I need assistance (No-no-no)
Don't touch me, I'm good (Get off me, I'm good)
I lost my car, what happened?
These drunk tunes got me trippin’
Take me home, damn, I’m buggin'
These drunk tunes got me so high

[Pre-Verse: N.O.R.E.]
Hey, yo, I’m drunk walkin' outta the club
Stopped to show love
The people want to flick it for Instagram pictures
I'm drunk so my eyes all red in the pictures
I'm outta place, bozo face in the pictures

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
Spread love, crew love, shit, it’s all the same to me
I show love, I get love, yup, and that remains to be
I'm walkin' to the whip and I'm stumblin'
I'm Marshawn Lynch with my limp, I ain't fumblin'
I smoked a Marlboro Red, see, I was outta line
And late to see my lady, I was outta time
I had to be meet her at the Fifi's fish spot
A Rafael gave me L and got my wrist hot
I used to drink Smirnoff with dope fiends
I would babysit my cup, coasting
New wave, Soundcloud, always around loud
Split a 'rillo, armadillo
Shot up the armored hero

[Chorus]
I lost my friends, where are we? (Where are they?)
I lost my phone, what happened? (What's goin' on?)
I'm drunk, I need assistance (No-no-no)
Don't touch me, I'm good (Get off me, I'm good)
I lost my car, what happened?
These drunk tunes got me trippin'
Take me home, damn, I'm buggin'
These drunk tunes got me so high

[Pre-Verse: Method Man]
Hey, yo, I'm drunk, throwin' up in the club
In addition, I ain't know what they was slippin' in them drinks I was sippin'
I didn't think, prob'ly somethin' pink, I was slippin'
Last time I woke up in the clink, I was trippin'

[Verse 2: Method Man]
One drink, two drink, three, it ain't a thing to me
I shows up then leave tore up, ain't nothin' changery
One too many Kamikazes, I'm a zombie
Stumblin' out the party, I was duckin' paparazzi
I shoulda skipped last call and hit the herb spot
Or hit the studio, maybe, because this verse hot
My first shot, my bird hot, by the third shot
Curved the THOT, the thirst real but her purse not
My attitude is out the world, I'm a star
Plus a rhymin' alcoholic, ask the girl behind the bar
The opps can't call it, they ain't havin' a prob'
Honey workin' on the tan, they nabbin' the jar

[Chorus]
I lost my friends, where are we? (Where are they?)
I lost my phone, what happened? (What's goin' on?)
I'm drunk, I need assistance (No-no-no)
Don't touch me, I'm good (Get off me, I'm good)
I lost my car, what happened?
These drunk tunes got me trippin'
Take me home, damn, I'm buggin'
These drunk tunes got me so high

[Verse 3: Joe Young]
Yo, don't talk to me when I'm drunk is what I'm sayin'
You okayin'?
Mad disrespectful, is we fuckin' or you stayin'?
Nights like this, I never know what I might pull
The bud got me high, I'ma Vodka and Red Bull
I'm on a level that could be dangerous to most
Champagne to the face, need no glass, fuck a toast
Keep them shots comin', keep the liquor runnin'
After hours spot jumpin', we might be into somethin'
We havin' a good time, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
The Lab in this bitch, eight guns, we ain't bluffin'
Don't be mad, she belong to the world stock, cuffin'
She in the middle of the dance floor like her muffin needs stuffin'
I got the oven, I'ma serve the plate
Tried the number with no debate
Poppin' mad bands for a nigga, shake that cake
Make that shit quake and watch it drop for a mother fucker
She ride the wave like it's some props in this mother fucker

[Chorus]
I lost my friends, where are we? (Where are they?)
I lost my phone, what happened? (What's goin' on?)
I'm drunk, I need assistance (No-no-no)
Don't touch me, I'm good (Get off me, I'm good)
I lost my car, what happened?
These drunk tunes got me trippin'
Take me home, damn, I'm buggin'
These drunk tunes got me so high

[Outro: N.O.R.E.]
