[Intro]
Right, oh y'all know what I'm sayin'
Trackmasters, what up?

[Method Man]
Yo, you remind me of this chick I knew, used to pursue
She wouldn't let the Meth' Man screw, but let the crew
So I did what any man in that situation would do
Go find him something new that's gon' keep it gangsta, too
Don't take it personal, I just call it the way I see
And what I see is not a potential wife to be
So basically, there it is and there it go
I'll pass this time, but next lifetime who knows?
Anything I suppose

[Usher]
See, the thing about you, that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl I'm-a try
You need to sit down, this may take a while....
See, this girl she sorta looks like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Hook 1 - Usher] (Blu Cantrell)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (Once upon a time)
See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
(You remind me, yeah) This is why I just can't get with you

[Blu Cantrell]
I can recall a certain magic in your eyes
Although we are just meeting, I feel as though I already know you
It's such a shame that you remind me of a past love, my worst love
So sorry, but I can't get with you cause remind me, yeah

[Hook 2 - Blu Cantrell]
You remind me of a guy that I once knew (you remind me, yeah)
See his face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of things she put me through (yeah)
This is why I just can't get with you

[Bridge - Usher] {Method Man}
I know it's so unfair to you (ha)
It's so unfair
That I relay her ignorance to you (whoa, I)
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me.... (you remind....)
{Yes, yes y'all, don't stop y'all
To the beat y'all, Trackmasters and ya don't stop}

[Method Man]
It's just somethin' about ya
That got me not knowin' if I wanna kiss ya or slap the shit out ya
My bad, I'm losin' myself, don't get me wrong
It's just that oil and water don't get along
Take it from somebody that know, been there befo'
I used to where my heart on my sleeve, not anymo'
Ask Usher and Blu, nothin' hurt me more than your love do
I put that on my life and The 'W'
You remind me

[Hook 1 - Usher] {Blu Cantrell}
{I can't get with you}
You remind me of a girl that I once knew {Once upon a time}
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Said I...)
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
{Sweet thing this is why} This is why I just can't get with you

[Hook 2 - Blu Cantrell] {Usher}
{Gotta let you go}
You remind of a guy that I once knew
See his face whenever I, I look at you (You remind me, yeah)
Wouldn't believe all of the things he put me through (Everything that you do, yeah)
{This is why I just can't get with you}
