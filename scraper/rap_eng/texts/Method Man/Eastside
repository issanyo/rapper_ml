[Intro: iNTeLL]
Yeah, uh
The I-N-T-E double L
Here we go, uh
Yeah, The Meth Lab, uh
Here we go

[Chorus: iNTeLL]
I said shout out to the West Side, but I'm from the East Side (Okay)
And you know that we ride (Okay), bumpin' hard beats off the G ride (Yeah)
Throwin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline
Crushin' Power-U, that's how I do
I said shout out to the west side, but I'm from the east side
And you know that we ride (Yeah), bumpin' hard beats off the G ride (Uh huh)
Throwin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline (Where you at?)
Crushin' Power-U, that's how I do it in the mean time

[Verse 1: iNTeLL]
I said welcome to the rec room, not a lot of headroom (Nope)
I'm sacrificin' virgins, catch the beats in my bedroom (Come here)
Go against the W, then you might be dead soon (Yeah)
I could make the sky bleed, but ya call it red moon (Moon)
I never been ordinary, carry weapons more than heavy (Come on)
Mind was designed to be primed 'cause I'm more than ready (Right)
If you sharpen your machete, better get that coffin ready
Run up in your crib, I fuck your wife and eat up your spaghetti (Fuck 'em)
All I do is write rhymes, smoke trees and pipe dimes (Uh huh)
Hustle all day then continue through the nighttime (Yeah)
Nasty like a pipeline, vigilantly fight crime
Rappers are my sons, I be worried like a white mom (Ha)
Wu gang is next up (Yeah), better have them checks cut (Yeah)
Taxes too high, "Bye Felicia" man, we fed up
Other rappers sped up they be outta pocket (Come on)
See, I can't wait 'til I ball out like Fetty Socket (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: iNTeLL]
I said shout out to the west side, but I'm from the east Side
And you know that we ride, bumpin' hard beats off the G ride
Throwin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline
Crushin' Power-U, that's how I do
I said shout out to the west side, but I'm from the east side
And you know that we ride, bumpin' hard beats off the G ride
Throwin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline
Crushin' Power-U, that's how I do it in the mean time

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I'm 'bout to hit 'em with that yes y'all (Uh)
You rockin' wit' the best, y'all (Uh)
Verbally, I'm skilled, plus, sometime I take the S off
That'll leave you killed, bucket list that you've been checked off (Uh)
Meth with the F, basically it's me and F y'all
How can I forget Protect Ya Neck, dog?
Not X, dog, love some DMX
I am practically DM an X, dog
Matter fact my next bar colder
Better yet, it's hot yoga
You get stretched forward, dog
Do respect, I don't respect y'all
That said, I'ma keep the track fed (Woo)
Look, if he ain't dead, he better act dead
P-L-O forever, peace to Achmed (Hey)
Type to say what's crackin' to a crackhead
Blacker than your face, that's a blackhead (Ah)
Need to be Proactive
These rap kids need to know the meanin' of what rap is
Before they say they rappers
I can say I mastered everything they talkin' 'bout
And after it's all said and done, you'll see my jersey in the rafters

[Chorus: iNTeLL]
I said shout out to the west side, but I'm from the east side
And you know that we ride, bumpin' hard beats off the G ride
Throwin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline
Crushin' Power-U, that's how I do it in the mean time
I said shout out to the west side, but I'm from the east side
And you know that we ride, bumpin' hard beats off the G ride
Throwin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline
Crushin' power you, that's how I do it in the mean time

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm sorry to keep you waitin' 'cause I've been cultivatin'
Thuggish through my duration
Doin' public relations
Countin' money, doin' TV shows
I can't believe he goes underground then mainstream
Super supreme and the cream rules everything (Yup)
You fools do a lot of talkin' but you never swing
And that's on everything
See, I'm a king so I look upon my scruples
And then pinpoint which one will be my next pupil
Concentrated, it's levels and layers
Devils and players, Joker's Wild
While I'm strokin' her down, we'll be smokin' a pound
And we came to par-tay, three the hard way
Johnny Blaze, Snoop Dogg and my nephew
You can't smoke with us, nigga, we left you
In the dust (What?), on the bus (What?) homie, we don't give a fuck (What?)
Long Beach, nigga, east side

[Chorus: iNTeLL]
I said shout out to the west side, but I'm from the east side
And you know that we ride, bumpin' hard beats off the G ride
Throwin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline
Crushin' Power-U, that's how I do
I said shout out to the west side, but I'm from the east side
And you know that we ride, bumpin' hard beats off the G ride
Throwin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline
Crushin' Power-U, that's how I do it in the mean time
