Intro:

And in our line of work, we need all the help we can get
Tony Wind is the name, he works for a drug ring in Central America
Who wants to kill him?
No information, say yes or no
One point five million
All right, you get what you want -- money's no object
They're all clean, no serial numbers, untraceable
And there are explosive head bullets, in the clip

[Raekwon, Ghostface, (Method)]

Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo-yo, here come the cop man
Yo Starks come here, come here Sun
Come here for a minute!
Aiyyo aiyyo hold up hold up
Shit we gotta go to the store for more baking soda

Chorus: Method Man
Who come to get you? None. They want guns!
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun 'cause he shine like one

Verse One: Method Man, a.k.a. Johnny Blaze
Check it
Scriptures hit the body like sawed off shotties
Like my hair notty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that whole pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
36 Chambers of fear, huh, you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmmmmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the ground
There's a new sheriff in town holdin it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath, we still paying dues
And the last one is death, back to the essence
With that shit you stressing, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin
Isle plus my style, Criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fuckin Blaze

Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef, a.k.a. Lou Diamonds
This goes for niggas who know
Wu will grow like llello, ley no, plus coolin in Barbados
Ricaans be givin me much shit, the dutch shit
Stay cool papi, seize it with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggas act up, what blow up the workers if they hafta
Senoritas, fuckin up a storm buyin guards margaritas
Suckin his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme prime nigga jail time jiggas

Jakes beware black rap millionaires
Rock hairs leather goose bears blowin this year
One eight hundred gambino niggas yeah

Meth:
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun 'cause he shine like one

Verse Three: RZA, a.k.a. Bobby Steels
Solid gold crown is shinin
Solid gold, check it Sun yo
Solid gold crown be shinin and blindin like some diamonds
I be pioneering the style in the cloud with silver linings
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart the rib cage the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch yo' ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with dim pones
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard oh is it
The Ryzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Lickin shots to Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happen millenium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for boutin
It's a mileage resemblin niggas who like followin
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle

Verse Four: Master Killer
God steppin forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact
That I'm the Master, for what lurks, is an expert
That hurts the individual who tries to visualize under
'Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killa tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hoss and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his muthafuckin dome
Piece, deceased, laid to rest

Chorus

Verse Five: Ghostface Killer, a.k.a. Tony Starks
Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room
Holdin up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf outta breath
Sold only new vocal cords I heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells well like a pharmacy
Fuck horado pablos plan growas bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellas become novels
The man rockin head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's british rock, playboys, mocks, and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with 8 million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavillions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught wit all that loot kid
That's jet money, undaground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies

Cosa cosa, come on...
