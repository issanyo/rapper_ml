Chorus:
You're all that I need, I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real witchu
Loving your whole schemes, it be in there boo
On top of that you got the good power-U

Verse One:
Check it out
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nuttin make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nuttin
You made a brother feel like he was something
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say "Baby it'll be okay"
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me I'm a make sure we
Be livin in the fucking lap of luxury
I'm realizing that cha didn't have to fuck with me
But cha did now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

Chorus 2X

Verse Two:
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Rockin three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I can be your Noah you can be my Wiz
Then I can be your Sun, you can be my Earth
Resurrect the God through birth
Best believe

Chorus 2X
