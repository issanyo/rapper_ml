Build For This Remix

[Verse 1: Method Man]

Sort of like Malcolm at the Audubon
They coming for me, time is money no Audemar
See bar-for-bar, I keep it pushing no R&R
No foreign broads and no promotion for foreign cars
The game is ours, let’s keep it funky who said he was
Like Staten Island, Italians bleed spaghetti sauce
If y'all ain't shaking or stacking than y'all already lost
Already cross the light, Christ I'm ready for em
Plus anybody that saying no, I’m taking numbers
I’m taking names, I’ll take your chain take this hunger
Pain, pain, pain
Then you feel the thunder and rain I don’t talk it like the rainbow
I get it done and the game y’all
Do me a favor, don’t ever play with my ball
Never been a player-hater I just ain't playing with y'all
You watching lame but look I’m taking the charge
Going hard will get you two shots now I’m facing the charge

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]
Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still ballin', ridin' on these niggas ‘cause they lame
In a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me? Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb, bust
On these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up
Westside! Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at
Ridin', passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead; a nigga still ballin'

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]

Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
The world is mine nigga get back
Don't mess with my stack the gauge is racked
About to drop the bomb I'm the Westcoast don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything westside of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga rewind my part fool

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]

Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to they graves
Watch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
‘Cause Trick don't give a fuck
Where you coward niggas now?
Blast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'
Busters thought we was frontin'
So reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'

[Verse 5: Eazy-E]

Seven-thousand, four hundred, twenty three grains
Of sand drop from the hourglass
It's how much time I got left on this planet
Some motherfucker's gotta die!
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma...she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's '92, now the year of code blue
15 hours..11 minutes..30 seconds
I'm a motherfuckin' wreck
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long
I'm comin' strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggs..kill up 10 pigs
Innocent and fuckers are also dyin, too
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin' kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]
