[Intro: iNTeLL]
Eh-yo; It's Intell
The I-N-T-E-Double-L
I'm tired of being humble

[Verse 1: iNTeLL]
I'm a fucking titan, enlightening like lightning
Rappers get destroyed like toys in liquid nitrogen
Even on a handful of Vicodin, I'm Leviathan
Bury me in the same box they put Goliath in
Do not pass goal, you asshole, your cash low
The mac-flow, your ears ring like trap-phones
I'm that dope. I smell blood like bad coke
All you wack clones, I kill quick, blast zones
Man I'm ridiculous spitting sicker than syphilis
Step into my frame only way you could picture this
Man I've been really lyrically killing shit
Black power militant, urban legacy infinite
I came to bring the pain, dope lyrics to your brain
Without hip-hop I go insane
Behold the flames, I can't contain, there's no remains
I load the bang with focused aim, nigga

[Hook x2: iNTeLL (Method Man)]
You don't want no part of this (I Reminisce)
Now I know who my targets is (I never miss)
Scratch who your favorite artist is (they don't exist)
They don't even go as hard as this (just let me vent, homie)
