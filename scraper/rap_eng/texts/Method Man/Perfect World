[Intro: Method Man]
First, they dropped the bomb
Then came the disease, then death
This our world, your world, my world
I like this world!

[Verse 1: Method Man]
On foreign land keep your toast up, hot rocks
Catch a close up, your snot box broke up
Land shark tryna post up, reptiles
Tryna throw cub with crooked smiles
Take your kindness for weakness, they foul
New York niggas be loving how the gun talk, "Pow!"
Another underboss pull a doublecross
Niggas ain't ready for the holocaust here and now
Want them games people play, catch these bullets over Broadway
25 to life up in Rahway get caught
Look deep into the black thought
A holy war is being fought on Allah's court
My perfect world (if you will!)

[Chorus: Method Man]
Mr. Sandman bring 'em a dream
Infrared light beams, homicide scene, perfect world
By any means get cream
Just don't let it come between you and I, seen
Everything is everything in this three ringed circus
Peoples is swift, tryna work us Lord
With Devil worship and satanic verses
It takes place in the world perfect, mine and yours

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Heard when it rains, it pour
I came to bring the pain once more
Pedal to the floor peep the Jim Crow Law
The Big Apple rotten to the core, these niggas want war?
(Give 'em war)
They scheming and eye-beaming
Hitmen like Crying Freeman, they need cleaning
Keep it coming 'til they all running, screaming
Bloody murder at war with them inner demons, it's going down
Invasion USA, spitting rounds
If these shells hit the battleground
Pave the way for birth of a Generation X
Spoken with a project dialect
Bomb threat to the airwaves, hit the deck
Pressed for time in a world lacking sunshine
Got love for my family cause they mine
See niggas dying in the streets over petty crime
We gon' eat or die trying, got my mind made up
Young buck, just don't give a fuck
Pressing they luck when they best best to give it up
Perfect world, baby, what? Nigga head or gut, them or us
Welcome to the dark ages
Dirty pages of filth, fine filth flavors
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes
Life flashes right before his eyes, then he passes

[Interlude: Cho-Flo]
While the 666 got more tricks than the PD's got bricks
From Bloods and Crips to pimps with mints
We still licking the scars from whips on slave ships

[Chorus]

[Outro: Method Man]
The children are the future
And Wu-Tang is for the babies!
