[Intro: Apocalipps]
Lyrical terrorism
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Apocalipps]
Me and my niggas, we comtemplate and puff sour
How we gon' crash an airplane into the Trump Towers
Freedom of speech, go grab your heat, then pump showers
Don’t want the money this time because I want the power
Fuck tracks, bust nuts through wack condoms
Carried the staff for so long, think I got back problems
Flow greasy, stack paper so easy
This little nigga stay here, open, like Cole Beasley
I'm at an all time high, you can't stop the feelin’
If my success make you sick, here's some amoxicillin
Six doses, beats is hypnosis
Meth Lab is open, bitch, so get focused
It's big business, we sellin' them plants
And nowadays I got more P's than Kerry Durant
And all the smokers called it dope, so we gave it a stamp
Dispensaries got stripper poles in case you girls wanna dance
One thing you gon' know about Apocalipps (What's that?)
Feel I take this whole shit 'cause I’m an optimist
You poppin’ shit, then pop a clip, get knocked then lock your lips
And if you snitch I'ma hit you in your esophagus
So I don’t deal wit'chu Dave and Busters
I got an angry little mob that'll smoke all of your dutches
Now, keep hatin' thot, eat a sausage
Minnesota or Cleveland, I’ma get love regardless
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool

[Chorus: Iron Mic]
Yo, we the kings of New York where cash rules (Cash rules)
In this game called life, you can't lose (Can't lose)
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool (What up, what up?)
Your better run the receipts, we pay dues (Pay dues)
We'll check SI live, we bad news (Bad news)
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Yeah, yeah
My game patient, it's complicated but so am I
Patiently waitin', I Playstation, I'm so NY
My foul flavor, one word is blick and I'm fortified
Big bully, Michael Jordan wearin' a forty five
One in his head, if he ain't dead, he borderline
Dope, every rhyme that I say, go 'head and snort a line
Sublime, if you didn't know I'm a water sign
Whatever floatin' your boat, just know the water mine
Stick your toe in, the water's fine, I'm positive
And I'm thinkin' positive but I'm thinkin' the problem is (What?)
That when I'm thinkin' 'bout opps, I'm thinkin' opposite
Plus I still think I'm in my Prime 'cause I'm an Optimus
My clan on top of it
Gettin' poppin', we poppin' it
'Cause in the spur of the moment wouldn't care, just pop a bitch
Meth proposterous
S-I, no stoppin' it
And once we get the key to the City, boy, we lockin' it

[Chorus: Iron Mic]
We the kings of New York where cash rules (Cash rules)
In this game called life, you can't lose (Can't lose)
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool (What up, what up?)
Your better run the receipts, we pay dues (Pay dues)
We'll check SI live, we bad news (Bad news)
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool

[Verse 3: Iron Mic]
Yo
Don't ever lil' bro me, nigga, I'm big homie
On Deck like Inspectah, yup, the weapon on me
Do not get confused, we just switched up the hustle
Probably took you a minute to get it, all muscle
Hit that emoji, these rappers is phoney
They'll kill for some of this DNA, but you can't clone me
This is God given, hard livin', Mars' vision
You new niggas can't really rock to our rhythm
Nope, this is massacre music
This is Meth Lab, a death jab, let's back into it
You tired of the producers dancin' all in the videos (Then what?)
Then come to Staten Island you little silly hoes
They see me go back, you see Sparks like Omillio
Young legend gettin' this young money, a milli, though
And I don't throw shots, nigga, I shoot 'em
I still white tee, Yankee hat and Timberland boot 'em (Let's go)
This is easy work
Probably see me in the street promotin' peace, still do you greasy, jerk
I been bangin' since Meth was on that stoop with Mary
I was loungin' on the low when the hours were scary
Everybody was choppin' back and forth 'cross the ferry
These bars are one on one, try not to compare me

[Interlude]
Meth Lab
Staten Island vs. Everybody
There is no competition

[Chorus: Iron Mic]
We the kings of New York where cash rules (Cash rules)
In this game called life, you can't lose (Can't lose)
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool (What up, what up?)
Your better run the receipts, we pay dues (Pay dues)
We'll check S-I live, we bad news (Bad news)
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool
