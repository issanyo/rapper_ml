[Intro: Rebecca Raines]
Should I, could I try to say
That I want you every way?
Should I, could I try to say?

[Verse 1: Yah-Sin]
Another pack to sell, another crack that got knocked in jailed
While others layin' with the daffodils
Fuck around and seen the cops was the ones busting
At your head, damn, little nigga, you ain't done nothing
Store trips turnin' into corpses
More sips of that Henny spilled, debts are costin'
Of course it's Yah-Sin again, makin' fans tremblin'
And skin 'em and, known to meditate and count Benjamins
Word to mommy or whoever maker
You've been climbin' up the stairs, I'm an elevator, tell your neighbor
That hater attitude is keepin' us down
They wanna know my secrets now
Everybody searchin' for a deeper sound

[Hook]
I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
It's gotta be a better way out

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Staten Island is iller, off the island they feel us
Some people might not get us but they don't doubt that we're killers
The system tryna kill us cause they don't doubt we're guerrillas
He home after that body then we don't doubt he a squealer
The dealers, everybody wants nice things
The realest get murdered over money and dice games, I get it
If your trap life's a gimmick then everybody a critic
That's a nice place to visit but they ain't tryin' to live it
Raw is how I give it like UG
Cops be askin' questions like, "Who's he?"
But I ain't sellin' no loosies
Brother when you walk in that room past, you lose me
That's why we never kick it like Bruce Lee

[Hook]
I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
It's gotta be a better way out

[Verse 3: Spank]
Sufferin' reality, perseverin' my salary
Trapped inside the drama like lookin' at Grey's Anatomy
Thinkin' of ways to capture the plan the creator have for me
It's principles when you the one takin' care of your faculty
Test tube, baby, the meth lab, the left jab
Right hook feel like I million dollars in X tabs
Gotta be a better way, llamas with me every day
It's goin' down everywhere, I'm laughin' while they let it spray
Real niggas' mamas cry, real niggas gotta ride
Some call it revenge, but still it's a homicide
Wonder how their father feel, will real niggas shed a tear?
Or do they only shed blood? They feel like they're forever feared

[Hook]
I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
It's gotta be a better way out
