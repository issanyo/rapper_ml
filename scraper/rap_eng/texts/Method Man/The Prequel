(Method Man)
I'm out...

Once again, it's the super, pied piper
Light your lighters for the future
And I ain't talking about Mekhi Phifer
Roll it if you got it people
At last the Prequel
And the eye ball
Floral is back
You'll find no equals
Bang it in your loudest system
Now who gunna diss him
Usually it be the brokest niggas
But this gunna fix em
Let me get my tool belt
For rappers that can use help
Now that Meth is back, you can tell me how my shoes felt
Just like Shaq in them size 22's
Except my games not a game
And I don't play by any rules man
Its time to build without a hardhat and goggles
Even with a map I'm still a hard act to follow
I thought you knew we do this everyday ok and I
Think marijuana is just nature's way of saying "hi"
Only hydro buds, I get it crunk
It's alright, if that bitch don't smoke then get her drunk
Now I pop a lot of shit, cause I can back it up (what)
I got that fire, bitch, its hard to pass it up (what)
While you'll was partying I been in the lab
You want that dope, give me an hour
Plus a pen and a pad

(Streetlife)
Aiiyo Meth what they look like (look like)
3rd LP nigga better be tight (be tight)
Don't forget where you come from, the hood life (hood life)
Let them know from the door we ain't the shook type (shook type)

(Method Man)
I got that shit that keep your head bobbin
Cause your neck know
Meth yo, I'm trying to get that more dollars then crep flow for certain
Before I put the pain, I put the work in
And each person I catch slipping gunna need nursing
Got these wanna-be gangstas, sleeping with they lights on
Shook up by the python, everybody got they eyes on
Not only is the streets watching, the streets is talking
And word has it that these rappers don't come around that often
Take it from the most slept on, you're wearing open-toe sandals
And I'm looking for some new toes to step on
And one to build a rep on, you all got me fucked up
My crew stick bitches like you, for acting stuck up
Methods like that yall, when I return you know the good herb is back y'all
Ladies and germs
Without further adieu
Let's keep it wu, and fuck keeping it real y'all
Just keep it juiced
