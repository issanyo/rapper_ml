[Intro: Method Man]
Smoking, choking up in this bitch
Mr Meth, DJ Lethal collaboration
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it goes like this, check it out, check it out
Yo, yo, yo

[Method Man]
Guess who's coming to dinner, put up or shut up
Sit on your ego, when I'm fed up, should of never ended
The missintentions of a Meth Man
I'm sorta like a CEO from Def Jam, minus the 'yes men'
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
I spit things, pop out my neck like shark gill
Live evil, DJ Lethal if you will
My kin's in the kitchen, I got for the kill
I'm like that, beyond "thunderdome", Mad Max
Like I'm pissed off, busting on a urinery track
Infection, it burns, anyone that step in my direction
Time to count your money, and your blessings

[Chorus: Method Man]
They like it, when he talk dirty like that
They like it, when he talk dirty like that
Opposites attract, time to face facts
When you bite me, I bite back
Now everybody wanna talk about, hip hop, hop music
Talk about, hip hop, hop music
Talk about, hip hop, hop music
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop music

[Method Man]
It's that state of the art, shit, business man
Formerly known as the artist
If ya'll ain't with me, then forget me
Cuz if I go broke, nothing gon' fix me
Except crispy, hundred dollar bills and fifties
Here's the main course, indeed, bringing it often
The starving for attention M.C.'s, stomachs is talking
About these New York'ns, witty
Who that got appettite for hot scorching plates
Make Little Annie Orphan
Sorta like Kurt Cobain, blowin' his brains
With these lyrics, and funk that 'smells like teen spirit'
Lookin' high, but hold up, look in they eye
And you see crook, coming from that Crooked Letter I

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
Now gag yourself wit the spoon
Tical 0: Dj Lethal, this coming soon
Jo Lethal, I'd rather play the odds, fuck equals
Besides, that's the sugar soften tooth to the people
All my people, up til now, you heard it all
And ya'll trying to shit on my lawn, curb your dog
Know just where to find him, at four twenty, son
But the Meth ain't gon' hit ya til 4:21
Now that's game, can't call it, can't complain
Just do the damn thing, like Nike shoe campaign
Yeah, boo, I hit you with a backstage pass
As long as you know, you giving up some backstage(ass)


(Chorus)
