[Chorus: Redman]
This is how it sounds when the hoods go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG! (Yeah)
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
Yeah, here we go (Here we go)
I said this is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG! (BANG!)
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
*click click* BANG!

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Yo, this is how it sound when the hood go bang
You can cop a couple of bricks of good cocaine
I’m a block scholar, call me Dollars, I don’t change
I’m a Rottweiler, diamond collar with gold fangs
Yep, a top shotter, Don Dada, rhyme proper
Might even take the ‘R’ out of brother—why bother?
Mic on Halloween, I mean, I’m clearly a monster
We gathered here today so that I could dearly depart ya
Math, bars better than Willy Wonka’s
It’s how to get away with a murder—you feel me, Shonda?
Rhymes like karma, I’m hood, stash the contra
You ever hear a rhymer this good, smack ya mamas
But it’s still death over dishonor
‘Cause you can get it next and get death over this drama
Math verse Meth, this Civil War is a starter
Men turn to martyrs, Wu-Tang bang regardless

[Chorus: Redman]
Yeah, this is how it sounds when the hoods go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
Yeah, here we go (Here we go)
I said this is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
*click click* BANG!

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
We stay shattered and clutch the gold links
Everything on is mint, I came through in a Reno, all tinted
I'm known to make a million in jet
King Joffrey and its cadets
Shooters from the boonies that's looney
Hold the Tec with all respect, expose his neck
Trees burn 'em out, niggas is learning now
The Archbishop murder through March, Clarks is slippers
I spark blippers, bloggers catch way shot zippers
The movie's all state of the art, we throw grenades and blades
And darts and changed the grain, this sharp
Remain remarkable, we ain't playing this part
We can't explain this art, he ain't the same as us, he pus
Glass of gin for my jewelers, too many rugers nigga
[?] [?] hundred Benz in Bermuda
Known to fuck a party up and bounce
We hog-tie little rappers, give 'em black eyes like Little Rascals

[Chorus: Redman]
Yeah, this is how it sounds when the hoods go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
Yeah, here we go (Here we go)
I said this is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
*click click* BANG!

[Verse 3: U-God]
What it sound like? Here's another sound right
The sounds of a hundred rounds, blacked down at night
And in hindsight, I'm still on this plane
The hood slang go bang, the big change to swank
Take an A, met these lanes, Mr. Officer Skane
It's just the dialect that I select when I slang
Who's saying? Your false talk, you get erased like chalk
Who's for? Or who shot hawk? And who popped off?
This is men and mouse shit, public service announcements
Careful we’re burnings a ounce of small town houses
Youthful offenders meet the public defender
Who offers you a fight attempt, plea deal with a mayday to surrender
What a fucked-up summer
Had a brand new come up
This Fourth of July [?] is fly and the doves cry
To [?] face in the R.I.P. white tee
From a ricochet of the red bricks to the headpiece

[Chorus: Redman]
Yeah, this is how it sounds when the hoods go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
Yeah, here we go (Here we go)
I said this is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
This is how it sound when the hood go BANG!
*click click* BANG!
