[Intro: Masta Killa]
My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang forever, baby

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
It's good to see the Wu-Tang family under one roof
We celebrate, toastin' shots, Ciroc 40 proof
Burgers on the grill and fried fish
The wiz made potato salad, greens for a side dish
Cold water, mill and reminisce with cousins and sisters
Children on the grass playin' ball and Twister
Fresh lemonade is made, we playin' spades
My nephews turn the livin' room into an arcade
Aunt's cherry baked pie, surprise, Johnny showed up
You can tell from the smell in the air, somethin' rolled up
It's love, peace and happiness, with the joy and laughter
Camera phones flashes, the moment is captured

[Bridge: The O'Jays]
It's so nice to see all the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout all the things that's been goin' down

[Verse 2: Method Man]
It's goin' down
We rock all in together now, Wu-Tang forever now
Twenty years later we still bang whatever now
Turn change to cheddar
If I could take a quote from Obama, change is better
I vow to never let you down
Remember Meth Tical?
In my circle haters was never 'round
I'm a boss, owe that to Kevin Lile
Reunited, the whole world excited
Wu-Tang is for the kids and people and girls invited

[Hook 2: The O'Jays]
Family reunion
Got to have a family reunion
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together
I wish grandma could see
The whole family
I sure miss her face
And her warm and tender embrace

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
I miss my grandmother, my auntie and Unique Ason
I knew Dirt was high when he had that face on
Fangs hangin' out his mouth, his fronts was golden
Wildin', record execs can't control him
He said ish like me and Mariah
Hit me, woah-woah-woah, that's fire
Still no matter what we gon' rep the name
Look at your family, we got twenty years in the game

[Hook 2: The O'Jays]
A family reunion
Gonna have a family reunion ooh, ooh
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together

[Outro: RZA]
Aye yo
I'd like to make a toast to my Wu-Tang family
All over the globe
East coast, west coast
All my brothas in the hood keepin' it good
Peace to the Gods and Earths
All my Latino brothers
My Asian brothers, my Caucasian brothers
Wu-Tang Forever
