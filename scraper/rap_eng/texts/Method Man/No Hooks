RZA:
Spectacular cardiovascular attacker!
Shaq's on the track with the blackular
Puzzler! Rugged slugger, 40 oz guzzla
Gold nugget fangs punch holes inside your jugular
Veins... do it quick nicca bi**h, before your brain get drained...
With the horror you now have become stained...
Ice cold, like the winter, Eskimo! Enter
The skill like a splinter! A decimal
Let's have a festival, Wu-Tang Killer Bees, we...
(Suuuuuuu!) Ah, intellectual
Styles break your mind!
Shine, nigga, shine!

All: We don't need no hooks!

Shaq:
The Shaq Attaq has risen
Au concrete PM this is twizm
Always & forever, forever always attack
I bring flava to ya ear like Craig Mack!
Life's a B and then ya D, refer to Nasty Nas Illmatic
CD, #3 Static!
You don't want none, ya best to keep lookin'
AEIOU's a ass-whoopin'! You're tooken
Into Clear & Present Danger, I'm a perfect stranger
Quick to rearrange a... outlook, so look out
So here me comes! Quick to beat you down
Like the RZA on the drums!
Change my name like Prince, punks be tremblin'
My name ain't Shaq no more, call me Superman
Emblem! Marks, get set, go left
The Shaq, the RZA, get ready for the Meth!

All: We don't need no hooks!

Method Man:
Dangersome, comin' mad phat, Terrordome
Like whadva ak, we can get it on. Break 'em down
I'm a set it, yeah, ooh dat dirty rat, bring 'em here
To the mindbender, the deathsender to your ear: Method
Whatup, hookers? Hoodrats are no goodaz
It be Tical breakin' rims with the Seven footer:
Shaq. Bring it to the front, now bring it back
To the head, black, 'cuz when my Soul Train hit the track
Target: the Billboard Charts, don't make me start it
The whole industry is gassed up and now they farted
My object is destruction, for percussion, rhymes are bustin'
Got your wholes block duckin'
Down! The end is here, apocalypse now!
Gettin' shot, peace'll work it out
