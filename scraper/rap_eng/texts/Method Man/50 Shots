[Chorus: Method Man & Mack Wilds]
Meth Man Cory Gunz go bang
Streetlife gotta knife, homie run your chain
Mack, riding around the city and we do our thing
From a city that is known to do crazy things
You already I’m heavy y’all stay in your lane
We ready Stat fete still playing the game
Mack, ladies in the show singing every hook
But they’re gonna get their panties took, so lets go

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Aye aye, y’all don’t get the picture before we focus
Facts, look who back, crooked like scoliosis, the take over
Take this line straight up your noses
This for my smokers but this time I up the dosage
This my closest, to perfection my magnum opus
The magnum smoking. I’m safe
Like when the magnum open
What y’all promoting, sex, lies, and true religion
Now how ironic them jeans ain’t got no true up in em
No Wu up in em, no DNA won’t see the day
You crash my set Lil Mama no VMA
Meth is a threat zero drama, I’m such a vet
No need for checking my cuts (Nooo) just cut the check
Who want one, You’ll need Hanz and Cory’s Gunz
Graffiti some, we spray cans where Cory from
I dreamed I lost in a food fight and Nore won
Kidding so it shall be written the story done

[Chorus: Method Man & Mack Wilds]

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Fuck you losers while they fake jacks I make maneuvers
Like Method, Sticking up crews, bumping some Wu shit
I’m all seasons goose down hoodie and snorkel
Whatever, whatever you want I’ll off you
I’m awful, unlawful, I ain’t the one to talk too
Thats word to uncle Ghost, I’ll cook your waffle
Riddle me down, I’m mentally that
Freddy the villain is here you remember me back
Felony killers or kitties. I chill and trapped in the belly
No telling me how high and they feel I be strapped
Waiting for murderers some type of burglar and chomping
And murder burglar upon us some karmas when the curb with
Turbulent, been a veteran what you still a virgin
Dangerous grounds, we stain the clowns I’m burgeon goon platoon
Some loon buffoons refurnishing, womb for tombs
Kaboom, you doomed, no surgeon you know

[Chorus: Method Man & Mack Wilds]

[Verse 3: Streetlife]
You could never break me down, I’m built for this
Crown fitted for a king I’m victorious
It's survival of the fit as we are warriors
For the red, black and green vanglorious
Godbody-Cypher-Divine, dangerous minds
Spontaneously combine, it’s the sign of the times
All things must come to an end, I’mma ball until then
No fade away shots I’m going hard at the rim
Might rupture my Achilles heel, chasing this hundred mill
Brake pads gone just lost my third wheel
On my last leg stay kicking like old cabbage and boiled eggs
Known to hold a grudge won’t stop till they all dead
Eyes bloodshot red bottle to the head damn forgot what I just said
Eyes blood, fuck it just on to the next one
I been around the world never forgot where I came from

[Chorus: Method Man & Mack Wilds]
