[Verse 1: Big Tigger]
Aight
Rap City Tha Bassment, Big Tig', EQ, Method Man hey
Method Man hey
It's going down, check it out one time
Off the top I guarantee there's no equal
His new album in stores - Tical 0, man, The Prequel
You know how we do when me and my crew bang
Been rapping this kid, since he was down with Wu-Tang
Back in the days, into the chamber 36
Big Tig' putting it down in dirty mix, provided by EQ
Test me and my crew, guarantee you lose
Man your whole crew snoozed
Meth, Tical, standing behind me right now
You know how we do, we keep it moving with freestyle
I'ma step to the right, you blow the spotlight
Dynamite, hey man come on and make it right

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Yeah, Mr. Meth AKA John John phenomenon
AKA Alicia Keys boyfriend in the video, here we go
Yo, yo, yo, oh shit lo and behold
Rza and Meth got another ninja scroll
Man I injure foes, send chills down their spines
Like I'm December cold, never bend or fold
Like a wallet. Can't call it, can't pretend to know
Whack shit, turn my back on it like a friend that stole
Been in the game ten years, I got ten to go
It's the prince and the dark knight let's begin day-O
Call me mister low maintenance
Tell them ho's I'm like a doctor that lost his license
I got no patients, I got time for wasting
If you ain't fam you ain't relating
These hating hot dog rappers is baking
Without love, like a stoner without bud
Your ass is as flat as a soda without suds
Who got the nerve to think that Meth can't rhyme
Put a nine to your skull and get that out your mind, mind
Yes! Uh oh! Like Lumi Dee
If Meth ain't that shit by now I'm soon to be
When I choke hold mics I don't give'em room to breathe
I'm just doing me, but girl if you're fine I'll do you free
By now if you don't know who it be, don't make me tell
Just know I killer Mike like that kid from ATL
If you fail to plan, baby plan to fail
See my game ugly ... like Sam Cassel
I'm so funky I can't even stand the smell
Come on, life's a drag, roll it up and inhale
Don't get comfy, I cramp your style like a monthly
Even Demi Moore need more than Ashton Kutcher to punk me
My 4-5 bars, just one shot'll clear the block
Like it's time for 106 & Park
Staten Island dropping your ass, we mean business
My gun'll put a shot in your ass
Like free clinics
