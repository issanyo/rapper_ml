[Intro: Method Man]
Everbody in the mosh pit
Everbody in the mosh pit
I don't think they ready for this one

[Bridge: Method Man]
Free style, man up, circle round, stand up
Pimps up, hands down, beat 'em up, man down
Free style, man up, circle round, stand up
Pimps up, hands down, beat 'em up, man down

No hands in the air, no need for bumping your fists
No, no, no hands in the air, no need for bumping your fists
No, no, no hands in the air, no need for bumping your fists
Method Man, tear the roof off, jump in the pit

[Drop Interval 1: Method Man]
Doc, Doc, Doctor P
No hands in the air, no need for bumping your fists
Method Man, tear the roof off, jump in the pit

Doc, Doc, Doctor P
No hands in the air, no need for bumping your fists
Method Man, tear the roof off, jump in the pit

[Verse 1: Method Man]
First of all, how many verse to brawl
If you trying to break something, then I'm the first to call
My shovel ready if any dirt's involved
And I euthanise methods that try to hurt my dawgs
I'm off the lane, they think I'm off my game
Got a thought, CHK-POW, and get it off your brain
The jewels cost money but love don't cost a thing
But it might cost you life, you don't come up off the chain

[Bridge: Method Man]

[Drop Interval 2: Method Man]
Mosh, mosh pit
No hands in the air, no need for bumping your fists
Method Man, tear the roof off, jump in the pit

Doc, Doc, Doctor P
No hands in the air, no need for bumping your fists
Method Man, tear the roof off, jump in the pit

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I'm like Jesus, you come across my name
Fast and furious to any that cut across my lane
House of pain, they have an ounce of chain
And a ring, couple haters that try and doubt my range
Had enough, Mr. Method and Doc P
The people need a reason to mosh, they got me
I live by the code, my killer's locked and load
If the pit catch fire, stop, drop, and roll

[Outro: Method Man]
Everybody in the mosh pit
Everybody in the mosh pit
Everybody in the mosh pit
Everybody in the mosh pit
