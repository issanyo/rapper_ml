You ain't live til you caught a lick and book it
Made a chick eat another chick pussy

[Method Man]
You ain't live to make you made your first million
And top models wanna swallow your children
I thought I told you wu tang for the children
Way before rap moving crack in the building
Now whats the price of rice in china
This shit is tryin to raise the price on their vagina
Me I'm tryin to live the life and get the grinda
But I ain't tryin get the shina
Pop off no question show dirty like no question no protection
When the kid hold court no objections
Knock me this money at the door no exception
I go hard in the pain of the rapper
I go hard on the skin no viagra
You think I'm trippin'
Ain't in the trickin
But keep a stone (?) in the kitchen who the master

[Hook]
