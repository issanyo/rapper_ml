[Intro]
Ch'yeah
Uh huh

Yes, sir!
PLO

[Chorus: Lounge Lo & Hue Hef]
Where you think he got it from? PLO (PLO)
Lights be so melodic at the PLO (PLO)
PLO (PLO), PLO (PLO)
They'll be a buncha killers at the PLO (PLO)
Where you think he got it from? PLO (PLO)
Yeah
Come and dig your pockets at the PLO (PLO)
A new generation, we still out there gettin' money
PLO (PLO), PLO (PLO)
Look, look
Raised me from the slums now I'm CEO (CEO)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Hue Hef]
You heard PLO style, nigga, I'm back again (Okay)
They told you G Bully be well in love with them Africans (Facts)
Heffner back on that shit, I guess they mad again (Aw shit)
Get crazy on the records, I tear 'em down when I'm battlin' (Yeah)
Come and off your re-up
Hit the strip, I drop a bomb in thirty minutes like I'm North Korea (Sheesh)
It take a lot to beat us (Yeah), you better join us (Uh)
You still keep lookouts on the corner, they be on us
I still rep the PLO like I'm everythang (Uh huh)
Crazy like a terrorist, hella, pitch it, then I'ma clap (Blap)
Pull the trigga on any jigga, you fade to black
This a liberation, they tried to take it, we took it back

[Verse 2: Hanz On]
That's where the trappers go and post the clocks
Bacon, egg, and cheese, then it's off to get this gaup (Let's go)
Mr. Barker gray and he ain't never gon' stop (Uh huh)
Seen it from the bottom, everything look like the top
I swear to God, Park Hill made 'em, broke the mold (Yup)
Solidify 'em, niggas frontin' on him, he reload (Reload)
It's all about the work, money, never 'bout them hoes (Nope)
Frontin' on a Staten, get your fuckery exposed (Fuckery)
Frontin' on a Staten, we dismantle niggas, facts
Fuck them niggas rattin', we should kill a couple stacks
My people, are you with me? Where the fuck my hittas at?
Park Hill lives on, still I lay 'em flat (Park Hill)

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
Where you think he got it from? PLO (PLO)
Lights be so melodic at the PLO (PLO)
PLO (PLO), PLO (PLO)
They'll be a buncha killers at the PLO (PLO)
Where you think he got it from? PLO (PLO)
Come and dig your pockets at the PLO (PLO)
PLO (PLO), PLO (PLO)
Raised me from the slums now I'm CEO (CEO)

[Verse 3: Streetlife]
PLO style through the lumps with the dutch master, blunts
Hashtag Fuck Donald Trump (Ha)
Momma didn't raise no punk, tough love (Tough love)
If push come to shove, nigga, I don't budge (Don't budge)
This is what I does, I'm a born G (Born G)
Check my DNA, all in the family
Park Hillian, thoughts covered like an Arabian
Titanum nod pointed at your cranium
Criminal minds and verse, no compromisin'
It's kill or be killed, no silver linin'
Thin line, life or death, Bruce co-signin'
Bottom line, dollar signs, gimmie mine

[Verse 4: Method Man]
PLO style, Mr. Meth, Staten Isle
Still got shotguns to slam up in your chest piece, blow (Ha)
We hot son, you could catch a hot one now
And I'ma keep kickin' doors 'til we knock one down
These rappers throwin' flags, they should be throwin' in the towel (Towel)
Honey showin' me her pat I'm tryna throw it in her mouth (Ha)
In fact, I'm throwin' bows like they throw 'em in the south
Arm and Hammer, nothin' like the bakin' soda in your house
Y'all don't really know what PLO about (About)
Y'all just shoot box money to a CEO account (Ha)
Put millions in the bank, roll a C-Lo and I'm out
I be steppin' on these rappers like a kilo in the drought

[Verse 5: Lounge Lo]
I run through, the killer, high tops with the sweats on
PLO boomers they lie and get they wreck on (Uh huh)
Park Hill, my squad ill, you know the set strong
It's the god damn, god damn up on this Meth song (Right)
I'm from the oob building, yeah, where they bet wrong
Sell crack, diss cats, yeah, boy, TEC long (Ha)
I know you happy that that real nigga Tech gone
Schoolboy load my flow y'all niggas slept on (Psh)
Right, I'm in the elevator, lights out
Get to the fourth floor, take a nigga life out (Ha)
Hanz On, my man's on, no whiteout
Meth Lab 2, the water team, we ride out

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
Where you think he got it from? PLO (PLO)
Lights be so melodic at the PLO (PLO)
PLO (PLO), PLO (PLO)
They'll be a buncha killers at the PLO (PLO)
Where you think he got it from? PLO (PLO)
Come and dig your pockets at the PLO (PLO)
PLO (PLO), PLO (PLO)
Raised me from the slums now I'm CEO (CEO)
