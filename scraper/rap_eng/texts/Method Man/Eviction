[Intro: Max B]
So wavy, so elegant, gyeah

[Bridge: Dave East]
Uh, I just wanna be free
D-d-d-d-Dame Grease on this mother fucker

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Movin' like they just evicted me
Pulled up in that foreign, got them niggas sick of me
Feds in the projects, I heard that they was takin' pics of me
Nas co-signed it, no Versace, rockin' HSTRY
This shit here, it should go down in history
We had them bundles, ask you uncle, he was tryna sniff for free
Niggas tried rob me turned into a fuckin' mystery
Trappin' 'til I got like fifty thousand on the wrist of me
Mixin' Cris with weed, I'm flippin', dippin' from D's
Scriptures tatted on us, no Bibles we had to read
You movin' not half my speed, you got a little buzz
But I got a little cuz that'll kill you if you laugh at me
Ain't nothin' funny, we 'bout this money come check the bank statement
Every month we on vacation, we cake chasin'
No patience, nigga, I hate waitin'
AK's quick and I heard you rat and seen the statement (rat! Dave East)
I just want to be free, I just want to be free
I just want to be free, I just want to be free

[Chorus: Dave East]
Movin' like they just evicted me
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted me

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Movin' like they just evicted me
Crossin' state lines and got this canine sniffin' me
I think they heard it through the grapevine, snitchery
Straight shottas, (blow!) Wu-Tang is for the pickney
Sentence me, either the pen or the penitentiary
Appealin' to the court 'cause you done caught a quarter century
Potentially, it's manslaughter if you mention me
I tell you how it is and then I tell you how it's meant to be
Twistin' up a tree, y'all buzzing because of me
Misery loves company, y'all ain't buggin', it's buggin' me
Finna be no sympathy, they playin' in the post
I'm just sayin' ain't no playin' with a GOAT, you must be kiddin' me
And I ain't gigglin', I'm 'bout my chicken, I mean I'm Louis Rich
Hammer Time, when I start spittin' I'm too legit
If I'm in the kitchen, Wu in the mix
Whip cream, tires clean, I'm so cool in the whip

[Interlude:]
[?]
I'm just tryna handle my business, business
I'ma soldier, [?]
You [?] to show struggles, [?] I told ya
We did it once and we gon' do it again

[Verse 3: Hanz On]
Movin' like they just evicted me
Streets had me seein' karma like epiphanies
Life clearer like them diamonds up in Tiffany's
Mayor got the ghettos hotter then rotisseries
I just'll linger with the piffery
Fifth of Henny, couple semis, try dissin' me
Yo, I swear to god I been through it
Chef told me focus on your dreams and pursue it
Yup, I'm spittin' nothin' but that fluid
Polluted water to your borders, yo, it's nothin' to it
I'm Hanzarelli, Meth Lab, no, there's nothin' to it
Mr. Barker gotten sharper under Method's tutelage
Y'all got disturbed when the homie backed 'em
Type that smile and celebrate it when them niggas clapped 'em
You cowards phony, we don't even dap 'em
Stayin' sucker free is sucker shit, that is the anteh

[Bridge: Dave East]
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free

[Verse 4: Joe Young]
Movin' like they just evicted me
Tryna get off like a nigga just restricted me
This shit here, is just what I predicted, B
Now we innovatin', celebratin' our victory
Niggas used to doubt us, went from mystery to history
Wu co-signin', I'm the sign, the epiphany
Homie must be shittin' me
Why the fuck you kiddin' me?
Frontin' for the lens but, on the low, your bitch keep hittin' me
While I lay up in the Benz, workin' what I spent, tryna get it back
Mama need the rent, show me the money
I don't need no new friends, just a few ends
And a couple real niggas, all I see is M's
Rich homies and young thugs minus the skinny pants
Losin' not an option so it's not in the plans
Homie tryna do it like my nigga Grease
Cop a few acres of land to put my niggas on Frontline

[Bridge: Dave East]
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free

[Chorus: Dave East]
Movin' like they just evicted me
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted me
