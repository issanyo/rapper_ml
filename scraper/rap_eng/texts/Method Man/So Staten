(Verse 1 - Method Man)
Yo, I’ve been Staten Island since ’85
My thing was rapping, ain’t get a package ’til ’89
That trick jacket, that bomber cracking that baby 9
That drug traffic, sell to your mama and maybe mine
I’m so Staten, no need to smack em, no need to shine
You and them divas is margaritas
You need the lime
Follow the leaders, Optimus Prime, follow the heater
This just in, I’m a little twisted, you non-believers
Richmond county, we get it lit
The tooly just a part of the movie, you get a clip
It ain’t all Gucci, Louis Vuitton, I’m Louis the fifth
That’s a V, if this was Sesame street, V is for Vic
I mean victim, stick him, ha ha ha stick him
Resisting, I’ll get ya the 16 I’m spittin’
My borough different cause we thorough, efficient
Donald Sterling on clipping, I’ll rock your world in addition

(Chorus – Hue Hef)
I’m so Staten Island
You already know how we bang
I’m so Staten Island
Niggas don’t wanna fuck with my gang
Cause my niggas riding and your niggas hiding
Everybody talking, I’m stepping with the iron
That nigga faded, when I start firing
Everybody running, welcome to the island
I’m from SI

(Verse 2 - Hanz On)
Walk light dead wrong when you cross that bridge
I got the park hill shooters, barracudas, you dig?
Bout 100 on ya fitted, Staten Island, we back
I said we back for this music and the mission is rap
Coalitions, yo they technicians, hammers is locked
Yo they loaded when they fire, you can hear it for blocks
Hands on nothing pretty, yo my city be New Yiddy
We are from crack sales, dumb travel with them semi’s
Got the coke cooking stashes in the ceiling
In fact, see if it’s wires on em so that all these killers relax
Don’t move, hypothetically you better not blink
Meth Lab, Staten Island, fuck with all of y’all day

(Chorus – Hue Hef)
I’m so Staten Island
You already know how we bang
I’m so Staten Island
Niggas don’t wanna fuck with my gang
Cause my niggas riding and your niggas hiding
Everybody talking, I’m stepping with the iron
That nigga faded, when I start firing
Everybody running, welcome to the island
I’m from SI

(Verse 3 - Hue Hef)
I wish you niggas tried to play the god
You gon’ fuck around and be my latest charge
Roll up and I smoke you just like an entourage
And you already know how I do it, I’m going twice as hard
I’m cooking up in that meth lab
Ready for distribution, it’s in the bag
My niggas different, we got hella swag
Trend setters made vendettas, ya hatin’ ass
I’m feeling like Meth in nine 2
His single bout to drop and I’m the livest in the crew
Hollywood from that 1-6-Ooh
And I’m going to the top with my dudes
Give a fuck if them niggas hatin', i’ll handle that situation
I’ll pick it up on my waist and i’ll blam at them niggas faces
Feeling like Tigger, end your career in that basement
Niggas moving fouler than a flagrant

(Chorus – Hue Hef)
I’m so Staten Island
You already know how we bang
I’m so Staten Island
Niggas don’t wanna fuck with my gang
Cause my niggas riding and your niggas hiding
Everybody talking, I’m stepping with the iron
That nigga faded, when I start firing
Everybody running, welcome to the island
I’m from SI
