Lay ya hammer (lay ya hammer)
Lay ya hammer kid (lay ya hammer kid)
They want the drama bring it to 'em Fuck 'em

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
All rise meet the preacher this pro dueler been diagnosed
Diabetic keptic I'm your host
Lock the vanilla suede British
Staten Island mall menace
Otherwise posing as a dentist in my lenses
Pinball machine gun rap spoke to Arafat
Laundry maid honey can't blow in this hat
What

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Is it raw now, change it around
It's war now, the final countdown commences
The battleground is twelve inches of wax paper
Breaking down your defenseless senseless nature
Pain stings with 'Ma Baker
Twin towering I skyscrape ya
Freedom come meet your maker

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Yo; Another sound boy's dying
Crowd noise multiplying
Don't let the fuzz slide in bust out the sirens
Sure win lure 'em in like exotic women
I smile with the sinister grin and finish him
You're fucking with hoods, get ya goods pushed back
Ya fraud, pull the wool off your Hollywood hat

[Verse 4: U-God]
The track melts in half liquors have this brave meaning
Supreme being being all that I can being
Picture wavy beavers meat cleaving your receiver
Fly sunny cheeba leather buckets dirty reefer
Fast floatinÂ’ grill residential honey hill
Stainless steel rashes sheisty catch a money bill

[Verse 5: Raekwon]
It's all gravy
We floating through like the British navy
Fresh design lady  love the fade keep it wavy
The mix drink - throw the dick in the drink
Play it baby girl caught ya
Exotic album Cuban Link
Custom AV's beige panties who could front on these please
Y'all niggas broke so much your uncle sells trees

[Verse 6: GZA]
Yo; High ranked officials and armed tanks and missiles
Blood drizzle simple fact you slept on the issue
That before he started jerkin' off joysticks and Sega
I made tapes a hundred watt amps Cerwin Vegas
RZA fine tune it shipping meal units
MC's ask, who be those rhyme killers in masks?
No doubt difficult task to last in the square
Beware infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious no opponents and blast through components
And microphones watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti that came approaching this
Incapable lust speech remains motionless

Lay ya hammer (Lay ya hammer)
Lay ya hammer kid (Lay ya hammer kid)
Lay ya hammer (Lay ya hammer)
