[Chorus]
We're called Whistle and this is true
We love to do the things that we're not supposed to do
We don't mean robbin', stealin', or muggin'
In fact, don't take it seriously—we're only buggin'

[Interlude]
That was fresh
That was fresh
That was fresh
That, that, that, that was fresh

[Verse 1]
Party peoples in the place, we want you all to see
That we can be taken seriously
But if you don't believe that then forget you all
’Cause we're gonna party-arty and have a ball
’Cause we're here to prove through bugged out means
That things aren't always what they seem
We want you all to scream and start to shout
As we go on a mission and bug on out

[Chorus]
We're called Whistle and this is true
We love to do the things that we're not supposed to do
We don't mean robbin', stealin', or muggin'
In fact, don't take it seriously—we're only buggin'

[Verse 2]
Well, it's all about us, Jazz and K.D
But sometimes it's all about just me
You know what I notice all of a sudden
When I speak people just hear muttin'
There's not another person who sounds like me
Indubitably, there will never be
I say a tongue twister like a blink of the eye
Say it so well, you will think it's a lie
Like Peter Parker picked up his gold pen
Put it on a pedestal and pursued his friend
His plot deployed, the polluted punk
Persisted to prohibit so the plotted plan flunked
My problem with fletchin' fletch people who flee
Is playin' the proper pot without a pitcharee
And my present plate who procrastinates my plea
So I'm the perfect pacemaker, perpetrator trades me
Tell me, girl, now is it true
That you'd love for me just to talk to you?
For you to be my girl and I'll be your man
You'll be mine, not just another fan
You'd be with me everywhere I go
You'd hold my hand at every show
Inseparable is what we'd be
Jazzin', Jazzette eternally
But after all of this, you know your dream will end
I wouldn't talk to you, I'd talk to your friend
And you would call me conceited and you'd call me wrong
But you'd call me that night and try to turn me on
You dial my digits in the day and in the night
Promise you, swear that you'll do me right
But I doubt that anything that you'd do
Would ever gimme the stomach to talk to you
Now I'm buggin'

[Bridge]
Some DJ's go [scratch] in order to impress
But DJ Silver Spinner is (really fresh)
We got tricks up our sleeve, and if that isn't enough
Grab a front row seat, and check out this (fuff)
When the place gets hot and the air gets thinner
The mutilator on the tables is the Silver Spinner
Your scratches fascinates us, so why don't you reveal it?
It make it hard enough so everybody can (Feel it?)

[DJ Interlude]
Just, just, just, just feel it
Just, just, just feel it
Just, just, just, just
Just, just, just, just feel it

Just, just, just, just
Just, just, just, just
Just, just, just, just
Just, just, just, just

[Chorus]
We're called Whistle and this is true
We love to do the things that we're not supposed to do
We don't mean robbin', stealin', or muggin'
In fact, don't take it seriously—we're only buggin'
