[Verse 1]
When friends ask me where I've been all day
I say don't think I can say
But then they ask me again
I'm trying to hold back this smile
'Cause kissing and telling ain't my style
But I'll do it anyway

[Chorus]
I was in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom
You shoulda seen me in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom

[Verse 2]
We started at nine
And we stopped at two
I was doing things I didn't know I could do
Boy, was it a sight a see

When I said, "Stop."
She said, "What for?"
So we went on just a little more
Y'all woulda been so proud of me

[Chorus]
I was in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom
You shoulda seen me in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Don't tell Barbara what I'm doing
(Don't tell Barbara, noooo)
If you do
She won't let me in her door
(Don't tell Barbara)
If Barbara finds out
My life is ruined
(Don't tell Barbara)
And Barbara won't give me anymore

Whoa...

[Chorus]
I was in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom
You shoulda seen me in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I was in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom
You shoulda seen me in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I was in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom
You shoulda seen me in Barbara's bedroom
Whoa, I was in Barbara's bedroom
