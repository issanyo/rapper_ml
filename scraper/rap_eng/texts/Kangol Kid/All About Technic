[ EMD ]
Shut up and sit up as I wet up the set-up
If you don't like it, punk, get out or get up
Do whatever you wanna do, suck on a lollypop
I'm like the breakball, this is the last stop
I made, the dribbles and dodgin the puppets
Whoever standin in my way is a culprit
On tape, I rape the women with rap
And in the near future their babies will clap
To a sequel that's equally soothin like Nitequil
I know that you thought that I lost it but I will
Keep on producin rhythms even better
If you really love them, then write me a letter
I'm better than best, I'm above all the rest
I can be reached at the fan club address
That's the driving force that encourage me
No rapper worries me, they can't discourage me
I remained since my arrival
Believe in myself and believe in survival
My rappin is edible, sweet like bonbons
I'm ridin the bassdrum to stay in the top-top
Just when you think I'm runnin out of breath
I bounce back with a rap - doubly def
The Educated Rapper's verses will stifle you
Scavengers, novice rappers, you're trifle, you
Haven't the slightest idea how much I ruffle
Your conscience, your insides, I watch you hustle
I don't just talk to be talkin
I don't bop it anyway to be walkin
I just try to be me, E
The only E, - E.M.D

[ Kangol Kid ]
Yeah boy, that's my boy E.M.D., Educated Most Definitely
But right about now Kangol is in effect
And I'ma talk to my man Mixmaster Ice

It's kinda hard to get this young lady, right?
But let me tell you:
All you gotta do to this young lady is whistle
[ *Mixmaster Ice scratches a whistling sound* ]
And check this out, she's so much on a mission
She'll walk by you and wait for you to whistle
On a serious tip
She'll even hear you if you whistled under water
[ *Mixmaster Ice makes the whistling sound as if under water* ]
