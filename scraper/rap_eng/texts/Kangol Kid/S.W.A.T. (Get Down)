Get down, get down
Pull your panties down

(Come on girls and let's)
Get down, get down
Pull your panties down
Cause all I wanna do
Is get down

[ Doctor Ice ]
You the girls love to make us guys sweat and beggin, there's no doubt
You make life a bitch and I swear I wish you girls would cut it out
Some women are timid and some are hot
Some give it all up and some do not
Some give it at will and some we force
Employees, meet your new boss
Punch it and

Get down, get down
(Tonight!)
Pull your panties down
(Right!)
All I wanna do
(Is put my) uh-uh-uh in you
(Come on girl and let's)
Get down, get down

Don't let no one tell me, tell me

Get down, get down
Pull your panties down

Visa/Mastercard accepted, I will charge you but so much
I take IOU's, and that includes a head charge if you touch
You girls rub yourself all over me make me, rise in nature too
You say yes and no and then I go home with my balls all blue

Get down, get down
And pull your panties down
