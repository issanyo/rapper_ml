Intro:
What's up baby
It's me and
My plane leaves Kenya in the morning
I wanted to see you before I left
But you are not home so (ohhh)
Well I, this is pretty much my big break
Wish me luck
And umm
I want u to know
That no matter where I am
Or what I am doing
I'll always love you
Bye bye

Verse 1:
Goodbye
It's time for me to go
I'll call you in the morning
So I can pack and go
The way you really feel boy
Put your mind at ease
I don't
Think I will
If I may leave
I still want u still want you here with me

Chorus:
I'll be there one day
And you will be right next to me
Right next, ohh, right next to me
I'll be there one day
And you will be right next to me
Right here next to me

Verse 2:
I wonder
Will you be a where I am, baby
Will you be by my side boy
Or with another girl
Just wait a little longer
Boy I don't know how long
Just try to understand
This is not what I planned
I am sorry this had to be (had to be)

Chorus:
I'll be there one day
And u will be right next to me
Right next, ohh, right next to me
I'll be there one day
And you will be right next to me
Right next here

Ohhh (ohh boy)
Ohhh boy (ohh boy)
Every man needs a woman
(every man needs a woman)
(every man needs a woman)
It's your loving that I choose
And I can't afford to lose
You baby
That's why I swear
I swear to the world (baby)
I will always be your girl
Just say you'll be
Right next to me

Chorus
