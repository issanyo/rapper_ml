[ E.M.D. & Kangol ]
No need for an introduction, I ain't on a mission
I bet you'd recognize me if you had a television
For those that aren't fortune, my name is E.M.D
Kangol is in effect and don't forget the I-c-e
I know you like it when we're (doin it) really, that's the purpose
Here in the flesh, UTFO is at your service
(Oh yeah) what you'll be sayin when it's over
Protestant, Jew, Muslim, Catholic, Jehova
Any type of culture can adjust to our rhythm
Those who can't adjust, we prefer not to be with em
There's a certain chemistry that we have as a team
It's not a mineral, liquid gas or a cream
'Keep it simple, stupid' is the motto that we go by
If you don't agree, don't consider yourself an ally
We're here for a reason, as you see we are pursuin it
And we're doin it, doin it, do-doin it

(Doin it)

[ E.M.D. & Kangol ]
My name is Jeff, call me Jeffrey
But to you it's the Educated Rapper M.D
My raps are incredible, sweet like bonbons
I won't cheerlead, shake any pompons
To any or many opponents who think they are best
I won't suck up, kiss up to you, I'll just test
You and you in many more ways than one
I'll take time, diss you and still have big fun
(Doin it) really that's the purpose
Here in the flesh, UTFO is at your service
(Oh yeah) what you'll be sayin when it's over
Protestant, Jew, Muslim, Catholic, Jehova
(Doin it) really that's the purpose
Here in the flesh, UTFO is at your service
(Oh yeah) what you'll be sayin when it's over
Protestant, Jew, Muslim, Catholic, Jehova

[ E.M.D. & Kangol ]
Our teeth are pearly white, we don't need a dentist
We know that we're correct because the people compliment us
Nationwide they love us, no matter where we go
They always say, "I love the part where you say so and so"
We accept the praises, respond with gratitude
This is an album, not an interlude
We keep new tracks stored on our computer
We learned from our experiences, we don't need a tutor
(Doin' It) is the name of this song
Kangol, E and Ice won't do you wrong
(Oh yeah) is what the crowd will say
When the radio stations play
(Doin it) really that's the purpose
Here in the flesh, UTFO is at your service
(Oh yeah) what you'll be sayin when it's over
Protestant, Jew, Muslim, Catholic, Jehova

[ Kangol ]
Well I'm the K-n-g-l for brothers that can't spell
When you see your posse again, you tell
Em Kangol is back, his crew and his hat
The Educated Rapper, Leader of the Pack is back
We crack necks and re-arrange your bone structure
I'm sharper than any object, boy, that ever cut ya
When you realize you can't hang
Respect will be given to Kang
I know you like it when I'm..

[ Doctor Ice ]
I'm the D-o-c-t-o-r
I'm the star, up to par
Goin real far cause I can go the distance
Other rappers show me resistance
And I shove em in a corner where they belong
As they listen to a rapper that's cock-strong
I don't jibber, jabber, stall the time
Fill the record with a sloppy rhyme
I did and I'm done and I'm doin what I do
And I'm doin it just for you
So kick it off now

(Doin it)
(Doin it)
(Oh yeah)
