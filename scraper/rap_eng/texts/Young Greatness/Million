[Intro]
Sometimes you just got to win you know what I’m saying
You know how far you go to get it
Get your grind on lil n*gga feel me
F*ck what a n*gga say, stay sucka free
Keep ya heat on ya too
You might try something you know what I’m saying

[Verse 1]
Hey little ni*ga on the block with my chain did you get it shine
Get my best friend hurt my heart just to see his momma cry
Little light in that rose plus her heart say close
What you know about the street life when you eighteen on the crack rock
Got me out of my feelings I just trying to make a million
I know some nigga want to steal me
You will never get a chance
I been rolling hard with my shooter riding around the city in a van
I know God got a plan I’m trying hard to understand
I’m just trying to be the man I’m just trying to be the man
I just want to run my city I just want to run my city
They screaming [?] when I walk in the building and a young boy make a killing
Nightmares pushing spaceships whole hood motivated
I been driving in the rain I been driving in my sleep
I been driving all night and all morning my kid got to eat
Ever seen a bus [?] or a [?] hall when you sleep
You don’t grind you don’t eat you don’t grind you don’t shine

[Hook]
I went decker hard on a corner with my burner really trying to get it
Keep my best friend got my mic on got a nigga straight tripping
A living legend trying to get it A living legend trying to get it
Hang my jersey in the rafters I live hard like a [?]
Look my enemy right in his eye
Yeah I done pushed all my feelings aside
A living legend til the day that I die

[Verse 2]
I went looking for a mil every night and I’m still trying to make it
On the streets motivation if I did it you can make it
Grab my chain like a racist foreign coupe on some ray shit
Bitch I’m rapping for New Orleans rock my tims like I’m Harlem
None of these n*gga can see me cause I ain’t nothing but a one in a million
Sat a the door like a villain the hot shot might kill ya
See the pain in my eyes you ain’t trying to take her out
I take you to the other side man it ain’t where no other n*gga goes
All I want is a million I take that make a killing
The wall on my chain the saint bernard in the building
I’m repping hard for my set though cook them nigga’s lives on a let go
I done sold all the shit I done shot up all the beef
I’m playing hard for the keeps
I want my grandma [?]
I want my momma [?]
I want my sister [?]
I’m praying hard for the better days

[Hook]
I went decker hard on a corner with my burner really trying to get it
Keep my best friend got my mic on got a nigga straight tripping
A living legend trying to get it A living legend trying to get it
Hang my jersey in the rafters I live hard like a [?]
Look my enemy right in his eye
Yeah I done pushed all my feelings aside
A living legend til the day that I die
