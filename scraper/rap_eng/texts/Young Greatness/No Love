[Intro: Magnolia Chop]
So much pain, so much pain
So much pain-ain-ain-ain-ain
(So much pain, so much pain, so much pain)

[Chorus: Magnolia Chop]
For the love of the money, things'll never change
Every day, niggas dyin’ in the streets in the dope game
He tried to get his change up but the streets hit him up
Got the city fucked up
Baby mama on drugs
Streets ain't got no fuckin' love
Streets ain’t got no fuckin' love
Streets ain't got no fuckin' love
Ain't got no fuckin' love
The streets ain't got no fuckin' love

[Verse 1: Young Greatness]
Whole lot of pain on me
Kids be from the ghetto where they die for the bread
When they killed my cousin I put five on they head
Young boys in my city, they’ll die for a Wraith
I done seen so many shootouts
I was tryna chase that moolah
They done turned my friends to foe
When you turn on Channel 4
What if I don’t live no more?
If I die by the corner store
Can you just tell my mama
I love her, I did it for the money
For two mil, two racks, I want the whole thing
That Glock-40 hold me down 'cause I’ma lose it
Don't switch no side, don't change no lane, don't do no choosin’
I'm in that jungle and it's feelin' like a movie

[Chorus: Magnolia Chop]
For the love of the money, things'll never change
Every day, niggas dyin' in the streets in the dope game
He tried to get his change up but the streets hit him up
Got the city fucked up
Baby mama on drugs
Streets ain't got no fuckin' love
Streets ain't got no fuckin' love
Streets ain't got no fuckin' love
Ain't got no fuckin' love
The streets ain't got no fuckin' love

[Verse 2: Magnolia Chop]
Never changed, never changed
Yeah, that shit amazed me
I, I said the streets crazy
Niggas ran and put a hole in the game
I said I would never change for the fortune or fame, yeah
I hope I make it to the morning time
I told that nigga he snorted his last line
My dog died before the sunshine
And he was only tryna get out
In the Crescent City, nigga kill you for a penny
A lot of niggas dead, some of 'em ain't livin'
It's a shame, it's a shame, uh
It's a shame, it's a shame, yeah

[Chorus: Magnolia Chop]
For the love of the money, things'll never change
Every day, niggas dyin' in the streets in the dope game
He tried to get his change up but the streets hit him up
Got the city fucked up
Baby mama on drugs
Streets ain't got no fuckin' love
Streets ain't got no fuckin' love
Streets ain't got no fuckin' love
Ain't got no fuckin' love
The streets ain't got no fuckin' love
