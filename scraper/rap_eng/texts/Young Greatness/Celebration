[Intro: Young Greatness]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Young Greatness + (Akon)]
I remember all the times when we was broke, yeah

[Verse 1: Akon]
Tryna get to that loot, had to move a little dope, oh yeah
Strugglin' to stay true but ain't wanna stay broke, oh yeah
My baby girl's so cute but needed a make over, oh yeah
While I'm standin' under that moon just tryna take over, oh yeah
The hustle, hustle was real, yeah
Pack my muscle and shuffle a deal, yeah-yeah
Tryna make a mil, just might get killed, yeah-yeah
Cause we do it for the love of the bills
And those crack babies are kingpins now
And those kingpins are the ones fiendin' now
And my karma came around
Man I came up by staying down

[Verse 2: Young Greatness]
I remember all the times I was trappin' by the stoop
I remember takin' trips to Texas, me and (?) gonna get the blue
I remember layin' down in prison man, prayin' man just to blue
I would never change on none of my niggas
I would never front on none of my niggas
I bought twenty Lambos just to shine on these niggas
I'm walkin' in the jewelry store, drop a 500 on my nigga
And I'm gon' kill all my shows and people be screamin' my name
I remember my grandma used to tell me "Teddy you be takin' a chance"
I (?) snatch everything just to make me some change
I flex on the hatin' ass niggas, fuck 'em man, they was sayin' my name
And bet every second now, we gon' hard on Sundays
And bet every second now, we gon' hard on Sundays
Young moolah

I remember all the times when we was broke, yeah

I remember all the times when we was broke, yeah
(Just tryna get it, tryna get it)
I remember all the times when we was broke, yeah
