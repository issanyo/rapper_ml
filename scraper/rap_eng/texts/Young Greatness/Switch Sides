[Intro]
You know
These niggas be ready for the switch up, you heard?
Shit fake man
Yeah

[Chorus]
Why they be switchin' the sides from me?
My partner like you should be proud of me
I feel like I won at the lottery
I count up a bowl like a pile of green
My day one is switch up the side from me
Switch up the side from me, yeah (Yeah)
Switch up the side from me, should be proud of me
Switch up the side from me, should be proud of me
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
My day one s'posed to say he proud of me
We shot the gutter like it's poverty
He a cheese eater like commodity
I can tell these niggas really doubted me
I'm a felon, yeah my mama proud of me
On the long night my daddy died for me
Yeah you niggas ought to see the jealousy
On the low they tryna kill my melody
You been hatin', why you tryna sit with me?
When your paper low, tryna fuck with me
See my blood brothers, yeah they stuck with me
See my blood brothers, yeah they love with me
See my blood brothers, yeah they duck with me
When the shots come, in the cut with me
I can't lose my life over jealousy
My lil' shooter shot, fuck a referee
Play it twenty times, you can't fuck with me
On some fake shit, you come up with me
You be hatin' dawg, and it's lame to me
You been hatin' dawg, and that's lame to me

[Chorus]
Why they be switchin' the sides from me?
My partner like you should be proud of me
I feel like I won up the lottery
I count up a bowl like a pile of green
My day one is switch up the side from me
Switch up the side from me, yeah (Yeah)
Switch up the side from me, should be proud of me
Switch up the side from me, should be proud of me
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
My nigga tried to take my soul from me
Did that money shot, and it's over for him
Yeah I prayed for it, it was choose for me
Where the money at, that you owe for me?
You a sucker nigga, you ain't from the streets
Move the shade back, let it rain on me
I don't trust you nigga, lot of pain on me
I been gettin' money, never change from it
Spent a couple dollars on my jewelry
See my real partners, they done cried with me
My hive, they gon' die with me
My fuckin' city full of jealousy
Extended clip, I'm a felony
A fine time just to check on mine
I heard the lies you done told the streets
Deep inside, you mean more to me
We was raised on the same street
That lil' money never changed me
You switched sides and it's shaming, yeah
You switched sides and it's shaming, ooh

[Chorus]
Why they be switchin' the sides from me?
My partner like you should be proud of me
I feel like I won up the lottery
I count up a bowl like a pile of green
My day one is switch up the side from me
Switch up the side from me, yeah (Yeah)
Switch up the side from me, should be proud of me
Switch up the side from me, should be proud of me
Yeah yeah yeah
