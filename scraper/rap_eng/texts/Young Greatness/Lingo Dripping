[Intro]
(?) cologne $1200, you know
Should taste that shit all on my nose nigga
Fresh as a motherfucker
You feel me?

[Hook]
All this lingo drippin' on me
All this lingo drippin' on me
All this lingo drippin' on me
All this lingo drippin' on me
Whip that foreign like it's stolen
All this gold like a trophy
I remember nights momma told me
I was gon' ball just as long as I hustle so hard

[Verse 1]
I just paint all the bitches like Mona Lisa
Chain drippin', lookin' like I'm fucking with the freezer
I wanna bird for the feature
I'm at your head like a reaper
Headshot like a blood clot
You better call that off, we at the dope spot, whew
Bitch I never had shit, I'm from the hard block
Give a nigga brick or somethin', I cook the whole block
In the new foreign coupe, that was the whole life
Ain't no talkin' bread bitch, then what you talkin' bout?
I came to ball, didn't wanna hurt nobody
I dropped the bread now Q gon' catch the body
I wanna drop my shit and roll the window down, oh
I'm feelin' like a stunna for the summer
I have some days trap house jumpin'
This shit be 'round my neck look like it water
Lil nigga only stuntin' for his daughter
I want the game, I might just kill you
I put the flame all on the streets
All this pain all on me
All this lingo drippin' on me
And it's 60 (?)
And a nigga walkin' (?) with me too

[Interlude]

Nigga all this motherfuckin' lingo drippin' nigga
It's fuckin' juice and shit round here

[Hook]
Hop out that coupe like (?)
All this lingo drippin' on me
Call them bitches, call them baby
They lovin' on me
Whip that foreign like it's stolen
All this gold like a trophy
I remember nights momma told me
I was gon' ball just as long as I hustle so hard
All this lingo drippin' on me
All this lingo drippin' on me
All this lingo drippin' on me
All this lingo drippin' on me
Whip that foreign like it's stolen
All this gold like a trophy
I remember nights momma told me

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with livin' the fast life
I told Cliff we gon' take the cash route
I'm, where the bag? Rent (?)
I want the (?) Nikes with the straps out
All the Mason Margiela, I'm a good fella
I'm bangin' at you nigga first though
You want a whole thing at your front door like the first though
I could count it all night till the mornin'
Let me call up some bitches, I'll have a fun time
She gon' eat it good like it's lunchtime
I mean I hustle hard bitch, you know it's gang time
I put the chain on me, you see that bitch shine, oh
I've been on a rollercoaster
I've been on a rollercoaster
We can count it up baby
I can tell and run it
Nigga run it crazy

[Hook]
Hop out that coupe like (?)
All this lingo drippin' on me
Call them bitches, call them baby

Whip that foreign like it's stolen
All this gold like a trophy
I remember nights momma told me
