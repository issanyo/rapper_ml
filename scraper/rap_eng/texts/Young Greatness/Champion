[Chorus]
Baby I'm feeling your vibe (Whoa, ooh)
Feel like a champion, yeah (Champion)
Live like the [?] to the streets
Fuck the police, they'll never [?] me
Got that big bank, we gon' run it up
Tell them bloodclaats we the murderers, ayy
I'll die for some loyalty
You comin' so come on with me
I'm takin' my brothers with me
We live like a champion
I might just shoot like a savage
Tell them bloodclaats we the murderers, oh

[Interlude]
Designer fabrics
We just want the money
Dig what I'm sayin'?
I ain't gon' never leave my brothers (I ain't gon' never leave, you heard me?)
I ain't gon' never leave my brothers (Real nigga shit)

[Verse 1]
Shootout in traffic, dipped in the fabrics, whoa
Shawty she throw up the gang for me, we like a classic, movie
Giuseppe Zanotti, caught a body, whoa
I'm hot like some fish grease, I been burnin' up, whoa
This for my brothers, die with my brothers, whoa
Dirty mattress, shots in traffic, hood tactics, corner savage, whoa
Never change on my brothers
Shawty ride like my brothers
We be the murderers

[Chorus]
Baby I'm feeling your vibe (Whoa, ooh)
Feel like a champion, yeah (Champion)
Live like the [?] to the streets
Fuck the police, they'll never [?] me
Got that big bank, we gon' run it up
Tell them bloodclaats we the murderers, ayy
I'll die for some loyalty
You comin' so come on with me
I'm takin' my brothers with me
We live like a champion
I might just shoot like a savage
Tell them bloodclaats we the murderers, oh

[Interlude]
Ayy we gon' kill that shit
I mean shawty if you gon' ride, you gotta understand one thing
We ain't takin' no prisoners
And we want the money baby
We want the money baby

[Verse 2]
Fuckin' up your summer, doin' crazy numbers
I'm in the zone right now, word to my nigga, my time shine
Ballin' on niggas like prime time
Baby it's planned, don't be so nervous
Stand on my car like a hood nigga
Tommy my gun like I'm Hilfiger
I got the flav' like a meal ticket
Hold that money out the roof
A champion, I'm the truth
Shoot that chopper out the roof
Let you know that they gon' come for me
Burnin' they shit like the whole summer
Burnin' they shit like the whole summer
We be the murderers, oh

[Chorus]
Baby I'm feeling your vibe (Whoa, ooh)
Feel like a champion, yeah (Champion)
Live like the [?] to the streets
Fuck the police, they'll never [?] me
Got that big bank, we gon' run it up
Tell them bloodclaats we the murderers, ayy
I'll die for some loyalty
You comin' so come on with me
I'm takin' my brothers with me
We live like a champion
I might just shoot like a savage
Tell them bloodclaats we the murderers, oh
