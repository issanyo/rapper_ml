[Intro]
Doubt, motherfuckers doubt me, some gon' say you won't
Doubt, motherfuckers doubt me, ayy

[Chorus]
Now these niggas wanna talk, motherfuckers doubt me
I done made all the money, I done bought all the cars, I done bought all the diamonds
Now these niggas wanna tell me some', ayy, yeah
I done made all the money, I done bought all the cars, I done bought all the diamonds
Now these niggas wanna tell me

[Verse 1]
Pussy to cocaine really paid me
Pussy to projects really made me
I like a LeBron chain like it's slavery
Talk to 'em, I was real broke, they can find me
Ridin' 'round with the top down in designer
I been vibin', chillin', focused on an island
Now every day that bitch see me, now she be smilin'
We the ones kept makin' money when the drought came
Yeah I fell off, came back with a milly made
They used to loud talk 'bout me now I make a killing man
I just been ridin' 'round, what a feeling
I just been ridin' 'round, what a feeling

[Chorus]
Now these niggas wanna talk, motherfuckers doubt me
I done made all the money, I done bought all the cars, I done bought all the diamonds
Now these niggas wanna tell me some', ayy, yeah
I done made all the money, I done bought all the cars, I done bought all the diamonds
Now these niggas wanna tell me

[Verse 2]
I done got it out the mud, nigga don't owe you shit
Every time we in the club, lookin' like a movie shoot
I just want all the money, tryna live cool and shit
Two sevens on my neck, lookin' real fool and shit
A shawty keep it so real, she'll live a cool lil bitch
What a hater say, he ain't really talkin' money
I done spent a quarter million just this summer
Ain't nobody gave me shit baby
I'ma do it on the strength, not 'cause I'm crazy
Ridin' 'round, all drop, money on me
Ridin' 'round, all drop, money on me, moolah

[Chorus]
Now these niggas wanna talk, motherfuckers doubt me
I done made all the money, I done bought all the cars, I done bought all the diamonds
Now these niggas wanna tell me some', ayy, yeah
I done made all the money, I done bought all the cars, I done bought all the diamonds
Now these niggas wanna tell me

[Outro]
Everybody wanna talk
Everybody got money
All these niggas funny man

Might just fuck your bitch nigga, just 'cause, you understand me?
Seventh Ward, seven nine shit nigga
