[Hook]
I be flexin so so hard on these lame niggas
I be skrt skrt
I be switching lanes on these niggas
Sittin back in that Wraith
Chillin with a foreign thing
Copp a rolly it ain't no thang
Drop a lane for a nigga with some change
I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball on them baby
I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball on them baby
I just wanna ball I wanna ball on them baby
I just wanna ball I wanna ball on them baby

[Verse 1]
I been flexing hard I park all my whips on the boulevard
Rolly wrist look like I stuck my hand up in that freezer
I'm counting that mula shorty suck me like i'm the cooler
All the shine in the summertime we cool
Hundred bands in my pants looking like who are you
Flexing in the whip that you've never seen on the news
Peanut butter seat ground beef like it's tacos
Lil homie trippin imma [?] call my vato
I been riding around my city shining like the cleaners
All my niggas searching dollars [?] have you seen her
Standing up sober in the club like we the crew
Red light special if you tripping boy what it do

[Hook]
I be flexin so so hard on these lame niggas
I be skrt skrt

Sittin back in that Wraith
Chillin with a foreign thing
Copp a rolly it ain't no thang
Drop a lane for a nigga with some change
I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball on them baby
I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball on them baby
I just wanna ball I wanna ball on them baby

[Verse 2]
Yellow diamond like Miyagi I be eating green
How about you
Benjamins all up in my face i'm talking in the money
I fell in love with that couppe imma go buy her some shoes
Phone ringing in talking baller man I don't move
A quarter ticket for the chain see the name when I move
I been copping diamonds
I been copping diamonds
Diamonds
We been shining baby
We been shining baby
Shining
All my niggas here with me baby what it do

[Hook]
I be flexin so so hard on these lame niggas

I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball on them baby
I just wanna ball
