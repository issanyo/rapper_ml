[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz & Young Greatness]
New Aston Martin like James Bond
Hop out the whip like I'm James Bond
I’ll take your bitch like I'm James Bond
Bitch, I got guns like I'm James Bond
All of this cash on me
I might go fuck up the fashion week, whoa
Shorty fuckin’ with me
Yeah, she ready for the party, hey, hey

Rollie shinin' like a trophy
New Aston Martin like James Bond
Hop out the whip like I'm James Bond
I'll take your bitch like I'm James Bond
Bitch, I got guns like I'm James Bond
We been tryna get the bread, yeah
Might just bust down the face
