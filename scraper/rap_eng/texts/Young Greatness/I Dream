(Verse 1, Scotty ATL)
Inspired by a old guy that i met live at a coat drive, warm heart for a cold world gave em four 5’s and some cold fries, waking up to a text message saying wallo died had me teary eyed, tryna focus on my can do’s, erbody wanna please self fukk me, calls to my cellphone get ignored tryna get me straight, i ain't doing u wen u on you, niggas call me fake, wen i got buds falling from the tree, nigga i dont need shake, rolling up for my damn self, drowning out all the heart ache and loud noise, ima go fly, I’ma go fly, ima go fly, scotty turned down a co sign, labels calling on both lines, p diddy where my cassie, ball hard ima athlete, hoping all of my big dogs get to make it home like lassie

(Hook, Young Greatness)
I dont wanna sell dime sacks no more, i dream i found a million dollars on the road, and one of my niccas down to ride for me, i dream i dream i dream, i supposed to be crying, i supposed to be feeling like I'm down, i took a cold shower last night, i caught a couple bodies on site... i dream i dream i dream 

(Verse 2, Scotty ATL)
Pain all in my mental, did it big for the eastside, southern funk wit the trill wave boy dis season good dis that deep fried, memba mama used to tell get home for the street light, wen i go bury me clean fat blunt and a peace sign, wen the phone dont answer, calling God for the good stuff, gotta watch dese niggas all in my city hit u wit the good bluff, so a playa had to write this, real spill from my ink pen, know they wanna see u down but u a Giant now nigga think BIG, gangsters got a heaven, miss mines i ain't lying, still putting that work in my family relying, head up to the ceiling now got me feeling raw like pac, been through so many trials with my real ones man this shit here gotta pop
