[Intro]
Koly P, Open that door right there

[Bridge][Young Greatness]
How you finesse a finesser
I'm  been trapping hard getting dirty money
She been sipping purple outta styrofoam
Drive a foreign car with the lights on
If I don't fuck with niggas I be gang gang
We be flexing hard in the streets
Put the dope money in my jeans
Your bitch be watching want to fuck a nigga
Told her, baby I be using rubbers with you
How you finesse a finesser, how you finesse a finesser
The trapping bible on my dresser

[Koly P]
Chitty chitty bang-bang
Koly P I'm  gang gang
Got money way before the fame
Did four years in the chain-gang
Every hood want my name rang
Lost grams down that drain
They killed Perp n they killed Wayne
All night nights on that John Wayne
Group of hoe’s giving me brain
Niggas saying I changed now
How the fuck a nigga made it
My address still the same now
I took my sentence, said take it
Why the fuck they playing blame now
Its Koly P da BOSS
I swear I got like 30 chains now… Meeeee

[Bridge]

[Zoey Dollars]
How you finesse a finesser
I finesse to get my check up
Got a bible on the dresser {Amen}
Got a draco on the dresser
Fly nigga when I dress up
We ain't worried about a vest bruh
Have my nigga hit you from the neck up
First 48 have you stretched out
I did a lot on the streets, I did a lot with that heat
I do a lot when I rap, nigga [facts]
I do a lot on the beats [yes]
Koly P dawg, I got you (I got you)
Date County up to Broward [954]
They know the name [yeah]…
