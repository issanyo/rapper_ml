[Verse 1]
Every nigga from that seven
Grind like they gotta win
They say my name even when that gang grind
Bitch I'm from the gutter I deserve to shine
At long nights thinking shooting with a K
This shit fucked up my city crying everyday
Young black boy he wanna run like Ricky Waters
But he dead broke on the block and he selling quarters
Man what would you do if your grandma didn't have money to pay the cable
Ever see your best friend die right in front you
Ever seen his baby momma cry right in front you
Heard of yall december walk
Full scholarships
Man that's kinda fucked up
Hood politics
It's cold in my city streets
It's cold in my city streets
Man

[Hook]
If you open your eyes then you could see that he grinds so hard
He hung out in the block every night but he still had dreams
For the love of the money
For the love of the money
He lost everything

[Verse 1]
He had a vision
Running all them dime plays
But he got fucked up trapping in them hallways
Everyday he prayed to make it out
But he had to choose a hustle route
Dirty sox dirty drawers he wants some new shit
So he stayed on that block having long nights
Caught his first body
Couple shoot outs
Counted bout twenty bands in his shoebox
And the homie was so cold but we'll never know
All they got is his blood on the city streets
A couple tatted bass where he laid at
A lonely cold blanket where they prayed at
It's fucked up cause everybody we love they gotta take from us
And everybody we trust they take our breath from us
Black ballers from the seven with a heart of passion
Then they stole all his dreams for the love of trappin
Jail due nigga
If your chasing your dream
Nigga your grandma lights cut off nigga
You ain't never seventeen

[Hook]
If you open your eyes then you could see that he grinds so hard
He hung up on the block every night but he still had dreams
For the love of the money
For the love of the money
He lost everything
