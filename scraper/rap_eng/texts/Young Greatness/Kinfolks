Twisted genius baby
We need that work

[Hook]
I made a hundred thousand this morning before I went to lunch
I got the money piling so I can fuck any bitch I want
Every time they see me they say I be with a different one
Don’t talk about my lay on bitch unless you can go get you one
Anytime money get low pay the gang like the tindo
On the grind, ten toe
Tryna take all my kinfolks
Still grinding like I’m broke as hell
Told my binny get a ponytail
Anytime I buy a new Chanel
Think about times I was in a cell

[Verse 1]
Remember ain’t no rhymes
Now a young nigga famous
Drop the torch and it feel good
Don’t this shit feel real good
They gon tell you I’m the only one
Only one out here doing some
Being broke used to feel dumb
I used to walk around wanna kill some
Turn my man’s to Islam
Fuck with them and then did none
And the job we gon get it done
It the squad versus anyone
Never switched don’t never bitch
Never told on another man
Don’t not’n wrong with that contraband
In the streets I’m the dopeman
If you dodge then think hard
Never stress never think hard
I’m the nigga niggas can’t rob
Niggas rather do a bank job
Stand down, ten toe
Tryna put my money in the benzo
Anytime money getting low
We gon grab the scraps and [?]

[Verse 2]
Money with tour for me
Fucking the [?] for real
Stacking my [?]
Been in the corner and looking for niggas that stole from me
Ain’t nobody really was there for me
I kick in the flavory
That nigga was talking was scared a me
I put a lil bread on her
The don’t be running the family
I take care my family
I whipping uphill like it’s slavery
I put a lil nine on it
That bullet be shining the flashy shit
I put a lil shine on me
I ganged up money to pay some shit
I put a lil grind on it
I member the days I was broke in the project just startled me
I’m dripping with money I look at  my momma she proud a me
A dopeboy for the projects
A dopeboy for the projects
