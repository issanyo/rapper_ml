[Hook]
The game game game game game game game
Niggas be setting you up
All that I want is the money
All that I want is the money
All that I want is the hundreds
All that I want is the hundreds
All that I want as a child
All that I want is the streets
All that I want is the heat
All that I want is the beef
All of these niggas be fakers and fools
None of these niggas can fuck with me
Tell em fuck with me
Tell em fuck with me

[Verse 1]
I want the streets
I want your hustle
I want the money
I want the broads
I want the thugs
I want the fame
I want the game
I want the pain
I want the dope
I want the coke
I want the weed
I want the time on the block
I want my daughter to see me
I want my son on TV
I want him to soar off with me
I want him to cut off with me
I want New Orleans in my hand
I want the world in my hand
I want a hundred million man
I wanna flex everyday
I want a check everyday
I want a Bentley
I want a Lam
I want a Roll
I want a Porsche
I wanna kill every nigga in the game
I wanna tell everybody my pain
I wanna tell everybody my struggle
I wanna tell my daddy I love him
I wanna take that block make it double
I wanna say love like Biggie
I wanna say love like Jay-Z
I wanna say love like 2Pac
I wanna take over yo block
I came to take over your spot

Deep on the block on the doorman
Deep on the block with my scope man

Dip out the block in the Phantom
Dip out the block in the Phantom
