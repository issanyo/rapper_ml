[Intro]
Yeah you can turn the street lights off on this one
Just get straight out these niggas

[Verse 1]
Saint Bernard San Pasto
Head honcho
Just sold a half a bird at the conoco
Pronto
For the lack of bronco
Ain't no nigga cosign me
I hug the block for it
If any nigga came with that beef
I sent some shots for it
I don't do that hit and the beef
Lamar for tough
Have my goons run in your spot
Hop in the ford truck
One for the feds I hit
The streets with a cold rush
Flood the whole block with that dope
Just like some cold cuts
Q.C chain on my neck
That's like a gold rush
Probably be the president of that bitch
In a cold month
Let the feens O.D from my hotshot
And they told bro
I told ya bro
I be spittin that shit just like I'm soldier bro
Soldier rag on my face
Convicted felon and I can't beat the case
D.A white bitch
She gone nail me til the preacher say
So say your grace
Imma spell your ass cause this a nursery
And I came for this money like it's church today
Where the pastor at

[Hook]
See on the low
I don't really see these niggas
But for my daughter
Might just kill these niggas
See this be that hustle route
Who gone really finish though

[Verse 2]
Who
Your old boys
Fore niggas drove porches
Had a benz
Fore niggas knew what benz is
Cold cut game
I done met a whole bird o dope
Master of the blow
Play my shit just like a vertico
In the ghost
Thinking bout them days when I rolled with Twon
In the kitchen
Whippin up that shit like a magic wand
Momma told me
Boy you a beast yeah your flow design
Ramen noodles on my knees serving them ounce is fine
And I ain't seen none of you niggas up on that block of mine
And if I did
On them cold nights you'll be tuna tuna
Kitchen with the mayonnaise jars whippin that YOLO bro
And I don't see that beef shit
Either drink it like cola bro
I fold em up
Got a hundred goons with that scope bro
See this will be my passion scene I'm like [?]
I done spend a couple dollars on a couple classics
I've been waiting to excel like Angela Bassett

[Hook]
See on the low
I don't really see these niggas
But for my daughter
Might just kill these niggas
See this be that hustle route
Who gone really finish though

See I'm a mastermind
I just sit back and think about this motherfucking money
Ya dig me
Imma ball on these motherfuckers
Yeah
