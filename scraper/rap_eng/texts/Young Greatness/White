Cinco!

[Chorus]
White dove, white coke, white Porsche on Forgi's (skuuuuurrr)
Best believe me, white got my momma flawless
Play with the white all night
Right on sight
Counting the wins all night
White gave me love for the game
White gave me money and fame
White
White, white (x3)

[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]
Yeah
I come live from the Bay
White got a nigga everything
Hundred chains, out the Range
I got chains on my neck
[?] make it stretch
I'm just tryna get the lick
I'm just tryna get to the VIP
Hundred grand worth of baking soda, put the price down
Break it down [?]
Fuck the plug, we want all the cream
Trapped out, trapped out tryna get a million
All white Lamborghini, hard top ceiling
Fuck those niggas and their feelings
I'm just tryna get a million
I'm just tryna get a billion
I could fuck her friend and I ain't even feeling her
Same pot, same stove
With a little water you could make a killing
[?]
Me and Greatness in the building

[Chorus]
White dove, white coke, white Porsche on Forgi's (skuuuuurrr)
Best believe me, white got my momma flawless
Play with the white all night
Right on sight
Counting the wins all night
White gave me love for the game
White gave me money and fame
White
White, white (x3)
White gave me everything

[Verse 2: Young Greatness]
White kept the lights on, white kept the team strong
White opened up doors for me, white had dope fiends calling me (prrr)
White got my first apartment
White had me ballin, gliding through New Orleans
White had me pausing, white had me starving
Cause you niggas don't hear me though
[?], white man
White gold, white chain
QC Cobain, for the love of the game
I sling that, man
Fuck wrong with you?
Team coming through, all of us cool
We bump that white like it's cool

White cars, white broads
White floors, white walls
White condo, [?]
White summer, [?]
For the right price he'll send them for you
Oh yeah, for the right price he'll send them for you
Bang bang bang bang


[Chorus]
White dove, white coke, white Porsche on Forgi's (skuuuuurrr)
Best believe me, white got my momma flawless
Play with the white all night
Right on sight
Counting the wins all night
White gave me love for the game
White gave me money and fame
White
White, white (x3)
