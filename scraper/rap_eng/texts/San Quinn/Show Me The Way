[Intro: Mac Dre]
Old Bitch Good Riddance
(I don't want a cat-
I want a kitten
Here Kitty kitty kitty kitty)

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why (old b-z back the fuck away)
Oh don't ask why

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]

Big titties
Big booty
Betsy
She was only 17 but she was sexy

And then there's Becky
18 and a half-er
She run like donner, rudolph, and prancer
No, I didn't have to romance her
But once I caught her
I couldn't shake her like cancer

And oh yeah nigga'
What about Ilene
She a fiend but she only nineteen

20 year old Claire and her best friend Blair
They square but they came as a pair

Show me the way to the next little girl
No 89 earthquake bitches for Furl
I don't want nothing old but the money
A Tina Turner bitch can't do nothing for me
Punk rock?
I'm mac dreazy
Show me the way to the next young b-z

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

[Verse 2: Smoov-E]

I knew it was wrong boy
I had to risk it
To bang the biscuit
Little old Triscuit

7, 5, and 3 zeros
That's my bail
I need Shapero

I was just having some fun in the telly
No bandaid like Nelly but bang like R kelly
Really, you heard what I said
Now you punk ass wishin' I wouldn't of done what I did

Lacy, Stacy and the little ol' Haitian
'Smoov-E a sex offender and he on probation'

Don't run your mouth dog
Keep it cool
Got to drop this girl off
In front of the high school

These hot ass bitches
Is barely legal
I'll be serving life sentences
For three damn people

Perky ass titties
Thick old thighs
I slipped a girl a Mickey
Your hand full of black flies

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

[Verse 3: San Quinn]

Young bitches at the high school
Flossing my riches
I'm so cool

12th graders at least
18 years of age
20 minutes or less
In the Escalade

Looking at the tv
Porno flickin' it
She grabbin' it
Telling me to stick it in

10 inching it
Infinite hitting it
She want to fuck another girl
Ask could I fix it up

Away away
To the junior college
All the bitches love the Escalade
To my knowledge

Sure enough, pulling up
Bumping a little beat
Pull a clydesdale slut from the middle east

She's looking too worthy (too worthy)
Off two ecstasy pills and it's daytime
Only 2:30

Hop in, hop in
She's singing 'ayo for yayo'
But she's saying I'm not quinn (what!)

[Hook: The Doors/Jim Morrison]

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way
To the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why

Show me the way to the next little girl

Show me the way to the next little girl
