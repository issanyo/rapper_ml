[Intro: Hollywood]
Yeah
Burn One
What is it?

[Verse 1: Hollywood]
Aye
I think it's time to put it in they face
Heart like Hitler, swag like Mace
For this cheese I'll put your rat in this maze
Y'all wasn't outside, y'all was playin' games
You cross the wrong wave and it's the price you pay
I'll fuck yo bitch and put it out, Ray J
And drop bombs on that bitch, Kay Slay
Coupe outside, old man gray
Stompin' hard in my red bottoms
Lift my feet up, letchu' know I got 'em
I'm not highsidin', just a hood product
That was put in a column for a nigga to hit rock bottom
Up in the way, you can't catch whatchu watchin', nigga
I guess y'all was listenin', we was talkin', nigga
Aye, yo, B, I'll break that bitch faster than you can cough, nigga
Michael Jackson spin, sip the juice and moon walk, nigga

[Verse 2: Berner]
Garlic noodles, butterfly shrimp
House in Marin, Twenty-grand rim
Just seen my face on the Vegas strip (I did)
On the billboard for weed, damn, life's a trip
Non-stop workin' got my chest hurtin'
Out in Hollywood just networkin' (Hello)
Rose gold watch, whole shit flooded (Bust out)
And you can get it here, I won't ship nothin' (Fuck nah)
Seen it all, crooked cops too
New J's dropped, yeah, I had to cop two
Grab the Benz-o, yeah, I want the drop too (I need a drop)
Now, my girl's talkin' shit, she wanna shop too (She would)
City boys, we be real rich men
The weed in the jar will make you feel different (Got me high)
People talkin' shit, yeah, they still trippin' (Why though?)
I feel like Sauce Walka, yeah, I'm still drippin'

[Hook: Berner & Cozmo]
[Berner]
Yeah, we unstoppable
Yeah
Anything is possible (Anything)
I'm still here, I got a lot of dough (A lot of dough)
You don't burn, I'll show you how to move
(You already know what it is, big Bay Area)
[Cozmo]
We unstoppable (Unstoppable)
I know that anything's possible (Anything's possible)
And losin' ain't optional
We came from the bottom, so winnin' is only logical
Yeah


[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Shoulda killed me at that bad drug deal, but I made it out
Now, I watch who I serve and what I pray about
Mac juice oozin' off me, young bitch choosin' on me
It's nothin' in the world I wouldn't do for the homie
It's the double O.G., outside, double O.T
Fans and the fiends know the dope ain't free
Transportin' overstate borders, that's a fed case
Broke bitch in the [?], that's a candidate
Learn that Cookie catchin' on the other coast
Prayin' for the fam, watch me slice a loaf
Six-hundred double M with a dozen horses
Time for me to play my game and never force it
Apply pressure, get a chance, move forward
Since life is a bitch, I want mine gorgeous
Big butt, good pussy, and the pier for me
Please stay in your lane, done veer into me

[Verse 4: Cozmo]
Uh
Growin' up it was all about makin' power moves
Mind on a Bentley and a crib out in Malibu
Now, the same one's that doubted you are proud of you
Never burn bridges, relationships are valuable
I moved dope, but I never touched the kilo
Still got the plug on the P's in Mendocino
My name buzzin', I never aimed to be famous
'Cause they say the fame is just the same as the pain is
Up early, gotta grind for the revenue
A dream's only a thought if you don't execute
Ask around, my reputation's exceptional
Anything less than success is unacceptable
We never put the pussy on the pedestal
Livin' for the moment, the memories, unforgettable
Thinkin' back before I ever had a vision
I could never imagine makin' a average livin'
Yeah, it's Cozmo

[Hook: Berner & Cozmo]
[Berner]
Yeah, we unstoppable
Yeah
Anything is possible (Anything)
I'm still here, I got a lot of dough (A lot of dough)
You don't burn, I'll show you how to move
(You already know what it is, big Bay Area)
[Cozmo]
We unstoppable (Unstoppable)
I know that anything's possible (Anything's possible)
And losin' ain't optional
We came from the bottom, so winnin' is only logical
Yeah
