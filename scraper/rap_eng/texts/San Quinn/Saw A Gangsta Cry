The way some cats they get they cash
Fuck around have a gun in your face
Tied up and they whoopin ur ass
Man, most cats they dont play
Cuz their mom get high
I can still recall the day I saw a gangsta cry

Man under the hot sun young cats they buk wit hot guns fat ones
Man if u sellin dis u better the know the consequence shit
Walk just like army ants ya man let me barrow that
Please home boy dont b no snitch
Put this business b4 that fine bitch
Here go a classy tale a mutha fuka just got out of jail
Slipped up on some major mail then went back to jail on major bail yo

Man most cats they dont play cuz their mom get high
I can still recall the day I saw a gangsta cry

Dont b no perpatrator
Fuk around b on a respirator
Goin up to heaven on a escalator
Cuz they sent u to hell on a ellavator yo
Rite in front of corner stores with the 4 5 slugs
Some might say its u or me
But their ain't no luv
Crack a smile like a beer bottle
Dont worry bout the bullet cuz it feels hollow
Keep ur foot on the gas throttle
Thez motha fukas ain't no role models
Blow ur mind with an evil disguise
Wiggin this nigga rite in front of ur eyes
Were he got shot thats were he lies
Layin there dead with open eyes
Blow u over on a street corner
Its all about that b soda
Braken arms and shoulders
Cuz this drama is thick as quotas
They busted u and u bust back
And just like a whipe u gonna snap back
How they gonna fuck with u fuck that
Kill them all so they dont come back
Mind state
Crime rate
Hell waits but jail baits
Man if u make a mistake dont even wait
But mutha fuker get up outa my face
Its a dirty loss for a dirty game
So mutha fuka its a dirty shame

I saw a gangsta cry

I saw a gangsta cry

I saw a gangsta cry

I saw a gangsta cry

It was a trip wen I first saw a gangsta cry
Didn't know didn't ask didn't wonder y
It was a trip wen I first saw a gangsta cry
Didn't know didn't ask didn't wonder y

Indistructable fuk wit a nigga
Busted slow ten years seven digits
