We go hard, we go hard
We go hard, we go hard
We go hard, we go hard(Mistah F.A.B: Yeah)
We go hard, we go hard(Mistah F.A.B: uhuh)
We go hard, we go hard(Mistah F.A.B: uh)


[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B]
You wanna see somebody go hard
Hit the grind king, 25/8
I'm hustlin'
My grind big

State to state, flying planes
Boats, Cars, Trucks, Trains
No sleep, no rest
Yeah, I'm on my grind mane

My motivation, inspiration, to the nation
Never lose focus when adversity you facing, uhh
Go hard, like algebraic equations
Scientific philosophy, psychology and ages

Obstacle and controversy's are minor setbacks
Live life to the fullest and never regret that
Take no days off, continue to build
Even if you gotta mill, it's no time to chill

Complacency is mental slavery, uhh
Go hard, stay hungry and humble, that's what you made be, uhh
Cos that's the only way to take the lead
This is reality homeboy, no make belief

[Hook]

[Verse 2: San Quinn]
Concrete, reinforced steel run against it
3 days, no sleep, hustle relentless
Drop benz, 2 seater on PCA
But my swisher is grape
You girl wanna date

One night stand but I refuse to lust her
Unless she pay me, I refuse to fuck her
Spending on money, I want hundreds of mills(I want hundreds of mills)
Being inda street, like automobiles

Le grande, compadre, my momma is real
I get chu outta yours boy, the choppa is real
My lugs a slugs, on fire from the jump off
On my way to KC, god peace the dump off

Never come soft, I dagger, viagra
Never fell off, nor ost my swagger
It's the mighty Quinn, take note of this
I knew it go hard, when I wrote this shit, yea

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr2theP]
I put that on my first born, second to third
Home run still second to third, whole shot, keep up if you can
This rap race,is fast pace, I lap cats doing their rain dance
Me, I just do what I can

With the gifts I was blessed with
With every verse dropped, that just thicken the plot
And I ain't nothing to mess with, ain't no second guessing
Down to the last cent, I'll die in the fucking bujes, to never be past tense

Like google, I add sense, not foogle with knowledge
Give a fuck about cash spent, I stay on my grind
I got the heart of a king
And they say to be a man, means provide for your seed and provide for your family

And that's by any means, by any means I go hard for the sake of my team
You call that struggle shit, I'm living the dream
And what's life without struggle?
Huh, that ain't living to me
