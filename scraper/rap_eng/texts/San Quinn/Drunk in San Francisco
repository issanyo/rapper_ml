I'm always drunk in San Francisco [X6]

[Verse 1: San Quinn]
It's a staring artist, in need of racks
You heard him too? I'll drink to that
Sittin' at the beach, drinking like a fish
Fit the privilege, arguing with my bitch
She said I need to quit, or find another groupie
Then she took the car, made me ride the munie
Bottle gone, at the bus had to hobble on
Like a real wine-o, gettin' my wobble on
End of the market, busy drunk talking to the homies
Listen tellin' Lauren diggin' in the garbage
Fuck, like I'm not a star
Lookin' for another card, free ride on the cable car
From brown to white, China Town on the hype
Patron shot after shot, no water and Sprite
Lookin' for a fight, runnin' up on tourists
Not too aware, but I'm for sure, ripped
See me on one, let me be me
You better calling SFPD

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tuf Luv]
What time is it? what day it is?
How the hell I end up it the baby crib?
I don't drink much, but when a nigga do
I get drunker than a pirate in a sailor suit
I'm on a bar with a bottle in my back pocket
Me and Paul Masson, just left crackin'
We about to go kick it with Brandy
Her and her little sister Landy
At 11:45, at my pier at 39
Had the bar at a dime, with a beer and a lime
Somebody try to draw the line I try to stop the cakes
Soon as the bottle hit my lips I'm like Frank Buttes
Drunk at the curb, askin' for my money back
Slurring words, yelling "what the look you fuckin' at"
Now everybody lookin', like ain't that a bitch
I'm at the 'Niner game, in that Raider fit
At the Giant's game, in that A's hat
When people flip me off, I just wave back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Yeah, I know the club owner, I like to rub on her
I'm in the crib with 3 shots and a cold Corona
I run laps like the 500 Daytona
Tell I find fine women, wanna know my persona
Then I'm on her like a light switch
The right bitch, that'll try to fuck a dyke bitch
I take her out to Candlestick
Get another 50cs she can handle with
That nigga B-Le, he be on that black
Cognac, Hennessy, yeah he fuck with that
I seen him at the Glass Cat
Gettin' splat at the back, it was hella racks
And, boy if you only knew
What I do, when I ride through them avenues
I'm talkin' 21, 22
My heels on, she about 6 in the few
I let them know what the thing do
We brought our shoes on so it cool, baby, act a fool
