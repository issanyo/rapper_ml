Hustlin, thuggin, on one, nothin
Everywhere I move my gun is with me
Like what, you better move
Everywhere I move my gun is with me

[Hook]
I don't think you really wanna go there with me (go there with me)
I don't think you really wanna go there with me (go there with me)
I don't think you really wanna go there with me (go there with me)
I don't think you really wanna go there with me (go there with me)
[San Quinn]
You ain't seen a beast yet, now the monsters upset
Said you all know the cause, now you find out the effect
Of a reject with de-tect, I chose to tote
Eyes tight, weed and reek, shit I love to smoke
Fillmore Uptown, Downtown is the business
Round town lot of talk, couple clowns don't feel us
Bounce like ATLien, but the Californian
Me and Mess is VVS's, you Cubans are conian
Causin pandemonium, it's the Quinndomania
Sayin when I sayin, mister bomb bout to raise it up
Stage I'm bout to tear it up, bitches don't believe in us
Chasin dreams to me it seems, nigga get you scared of what

[Hook] + [Hook]

[Messy Marv]
I floss, I'm a boss
I put them yellow canaries in my cross
I got a gun, with a drum
I go Stewie nigga fuck goin dumb
Like what, nigga what
I'm retarded, I go the short bus
I'm a fool, a Tycoon
I snorted hop nigga out of a balloon
Shit I'm sick, you a bitch
I pull up and give you clowns a whole clip
You a ho, nigga you a punk
Say somethin watch yo ass get stomped, we can go there

[Hook] + [Hook]

[San Quinn] + (Messy Marv)
Everytime I move my gun is on me
I don't think ya'll really want it with me
Like blaow (like blaow), what now (what now)
You could move or get that ass bucked down (bucked down)

[Repeat - 2x]
Wanna talk that shit, you can be in the ditch
If you like that ho, you can leave with the bitch

(*Talking*)
Huh, what, what it do, what
What it do, what, what it do
What, what it do, what, what it do
What, what it do, what, what it do
What, what it do
