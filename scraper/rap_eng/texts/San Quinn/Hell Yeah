[Verse 1:]
Live in the flesh
Live from the west
Free of all suckas and I ride with the rest

Haters gone hate when the breezies request
3 to ya chest will relieve ya the stress
For the right hook make em' lean to the left
Hot damn hoe her we go again
E-a-ski and the might San Quinn
Showin up tonight everybody roll in
We don't follow niggas all we do is set trends
I'm a live motivator
Purple weed inhaler
Snub nose in the club

Got cha feet wet boy I'm a alligator
Yup you'll see who the hell in front of it
P.s square that's excepted none of it

Everybody get inside

[Verse 2:]
Hell yeah
It's fillmoe and the o
It our time
The rolex is swiveling slow
Every time they play our records the freak hittin the floor
If you ain't playin our records what you hittin us for
I'm bout the business when I'm spittiin the flow
Gettin the dough
Whit some numbers and some comments and a grip of zeros
I.m.g is p.I
We ain't a grip of heros
Captain save em' of somthing we don't need these pros
Poppin tags at the mall
But we don't need these clothes
I'm a v-12 deck I don't need no bose
I ain't got to do the fool in the o
I do the cool in the o
Makin hit records movin' the o
I know you heard it all before but I'm provin it though
Droppin the glass and the window and the roof in the o
E-a-ski make hits
Make you dance to this
Am I the man
Allen tell them what the answer is

[Chorus:]
Hell yeah
Everybody wanna see
San quinn and e-a-ski
Pimp this game just like a g
They sucka free
Hell yeah
If you want it take a ride
From fillmoe to the eastside
Everybody get inside

Flash dance watch em' get buck naked
Criminal chance is there I'm a take it
Yo I gots to keep it real

Shake it don't break it
Flash dance watch em' get buck naked
Criminal chance is there I'm a take it
Yo I gots to keep it real

[Verse 3:]
This is a slapper
This is a slumper
I'm just a rapper
But I keeps the thumper
Keep my name in his mouth and he ain't no fan
To me he's sucka, but that's ya man

Collars still pop man

Hell yeah
If you want it take a ride
From fillmoe to the eastside
Everybody get inside
