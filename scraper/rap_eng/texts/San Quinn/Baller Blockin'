[Intro: San Quinn &  E-40 ]
Baller blockin', uh
Competition is none
(I'ma [?] that we get [?], can't be like me)
Baller blockin', uh
Competition is none
(Play your heart out, either go hard or go home)
Check it out

[Verse 1: San Quinn]
Golden State Warrior on the floor wit' ya
Gonna score on ya, whole team top performance
L.A. Lakers, fans break us, land second
Shot makers, championship takers
Phoenix Suns, hot as the sun
Up close and personal, professional ones
Who doesn't like the Nuggets from the city of Denver?
This is the NBA, you must remember
Dallas Mavericks work magic, run up the score
Everybody on defense and going for boards
San Antonio Spurs, haven't [?] a loss for words
Shock and amaze, defenders deferred
Supersonics in Seattle, tough place to visit
We better play hard, 'cause they love to win it
Trailblazin' in Portland, stealin', dunkin', and scorin'
So wet from three, like the rain is pouring
San Quinn, the 'Frisco D, Bay Area player, can't be like me
Get hyphy on the track, show more stamina
Shine bright for the lights, smile for the camera
I'm a guard, I'm a center, I'm a forward when I enter
The game on the sticks and I win with splendor

[Chorus: San Quinn &  E-40 ]
Baller blockin', uh
I'm the sole survivor, your score is high but my score is higher
Competition is none
I'm the sole survivor, your score is high but my score is higher
Baller blockin', uh
I'm the sole survivor, your score is high but my score is higher
Competition is none
(Quinn, this here 40 man, let me get at 'em player)
Uh

[Verse 2: E-40]
When it comes to this player, hey ain't nobody pumpin' fear
Gotta have heart and have labour, let your presence be known here
Earth is my turf, I been battlin' at basketball courts
Sometimes I give ... 'cause of the way I wear my shorts
Never brickin', just hittin', me and my clique
We got handles, we show offs man, you get shook like a pick
Ball 'till we fall and stand tough like [?], y'all
Pop my collar, dust myself off, I'm flyin, I'm raw
Let the games begin player, yes sir, let's let it be known
Better play your heart out, either go hard or go home (uh)
Aggressive, selective, in the paint I'm kinda [?]
Far from a marshmellow, well I ain't gon' take me light
I'm the [?], I'm solid, I'm the truth, I play for keeps
Tryna duck and get swatted, if you feel frogs, it's leap, (uh, uh)
I'm nowhere near soft as baby cotton
No goaltendin' or baller blockin'
(Uh, uh)

[Chorus: San Quinn &  E- 40 ]
Baller blockin', uh
I'm the sole survivor, your score is high but my score is higher
Competition is none
I'm the sole survivor, your score is high but my score is higher
Baller blockin', uh
I'm the sole survivor, your score is high but my score is higher
Competition is none
I'm the sole survivor, your score is high but my score is higher
Baller blockin', uh

[Outro: San Quinn]
