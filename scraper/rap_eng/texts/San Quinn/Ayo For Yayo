[Intro: Sample]
OK... got some for me?

[Verse 1: San Quinn]
Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once innocent and sweet
14 introduced to the street
Started from weed, big smoke outs
Before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
Now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
Introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
Plate on the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
You see the big girls do it so of
Course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blow in ya time
Let's go

[Chorus: Andre Nickatina]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo

[Verse 2: San Quinn]
Choppin' and coppin' the kicks
Supplying people with they fix
Where you fit?
On Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
Not too much cuz you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat and a pack in the sock
Take a couple of toots, then its back to the block
Back to the service out the sack
Experimenting with that soft, wonder 'bout that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
Papered out, always at the powder house
Day time, night time, nigga powdered out
Could've been a papered-up powerhouse

[Chorus: Andre Nickatina]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Like you and I, super high, like Super Fly
One more line, one more rhyme like Peruvian fine
I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? Like Boston George?
You want some more, for you and your whores?
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
And corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man high, eight balls and quarters
They call me, placing they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the cake
Before I'm sold, they take the taste
Snortin habit, not worth affordin
Some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doing my job, connected wit the mob
Got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night

[Chorus: Andre Nickatina]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yay-e-o
Walk around with yay-e-o
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yay-e-o
Walk around with yay-e-o
All in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
