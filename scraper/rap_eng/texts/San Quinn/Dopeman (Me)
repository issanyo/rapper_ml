[Intro: Husalah]
I been shootin' baby (shootin' baby)
I'm goin' down, 'cause nigga I'm feelin' crazy
I'm movin' out, this is what it sounds like, gotta get paper baby
I'm goin' down, 'cause lately I been feelin' crazy

[Verse 1: Husalah]
Yo, yo, yo
Husalah I'm from the era of terror
Where the young niggas sniff white
Dip through late night and take a life
Fist fights'll get ya hype, then the clip'll light
It's kryptonite 'cause even Superman can lay stiff tonight
And I'm Lex nigga, out my mind crazy
Skitzo, I think every nigga out to play me
So I'm dippin' zany, wit' the achy casey's
Geese and Maney, the first of them 80's babies
And I just wanna move that good ol' crack
I'm headed 'round in the sweat, shoot, shoot at that
The 4-5 lama eat ya duke shoot up black
So stay back 'cause my J-cats spray MAC's
Cook up crack and push packs late night
Movin' up nigga, blood on that base pipe
I live life on a razor, maintainin' wit' my same niggas
Stayin' away from lames, I lost some of my main niggas
So I cock back and clap, clap at the same niggas
Fuck shootin' in the sky, nigga we aim
And when my thang gets hangin' out the window
Niggas won't make it, charge the shit to the game
So every time I look up man, the fiends lookin' for the cook up man
On the backstreets cooked up grams
And the hooked up man, is 'posed to hook up fans
But niggas ain't tryna hook the young crook up man
So I hooked up wit' man's water lick on a cook up man
Came through and we cooked that man
Now they sayin' who the fuck hook Hus up, damn
A nigga havin' more money than the cook up man
Yeah the crook up man, and my plan is to hook up fam
But it ain't that many daps and shook up hands
Just shook up fags walkin' around plottin' on the cook up man, me

[Chorus: Husalah]
I'm goin' down, 'cause nigga I'm feelin' crazy
I'm movin' out, this is what it sounds like, gotta get paper baby
I'm goin' down, 'cause lately I been feelin' crazy
I'm goin' down, 'cause lately I been feelin' crazy
I'm goin' down

[Verse 2: San Quinn]
Mournin' a couple of bars
Own a couple of scars
I'm holdin' on to bullets, break a couple of jaws
We don't fuck wit' the law, they get no info
Niggas on some real shit, you know what you in for?
Stack a hundred racks to hide for rainy days
Remy abuser, nose dirty in the crannies
Really the shooter, I need to be
First rule to guerrilla warfare is secrecy
Get penny, you can't control the drug trade
Do you, I learned that at a young age
They caught cases, I caught 'em on they way
From the pondo, served 'em cream, all yay'
Niggas needed bricks, I had the ese's locked
AK's cocked, respect the man that owned the spot
Understand it, recognize it, abide by it
Fool wit' Quin', advise you, donâ€™t' try it

[Chorus: Husalah]
I'm goin' down, 'cause nigga I'm feelin' crazy
I'm movin' out, this is what it sounds like, gotta get paper baby
I'm goin' down, 'cause lately I been feelin' crazy
I'm goin' down, 'cause lately I been feelin' crazy
I'm goin' down
