[Intro]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
In a world full of haters stands a single group who clearly separate themselves from the rest. These 3 men scale the ends of the earth searching for truth and triumph
Meechy Darko, Zombie Juice, and Erick the Architect. These are the Flatbush Zombies, and this is 3001: A Laced Odyssey

[Hook: Samples]
"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
"Every day; me and Mary Jane"

"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
"Every day; me and Mary Jane"

[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
Every day, live it like it's it for me
Black on black in time with my roots this is my ghetto symphony
Shout out to my fam and my homies, we making history
Never had a degree, but the streets made me a sicker breed
Every day another drug, experimental in my mental
Had to tone it down, I c-couldn't see without my liquid liquid
Had to learn how to balance life man, I can't fucking stand it
Court fees, bought pleas, nigga where's your fucking manners
How you hatin' on us, but claim the king of NY?
These niggas ain't fit to be the king, go ask Jadakiss why
I'm in the lobby right now, 16:55
I got a bitch like Cardi B, bet that ass sittin' nice
Don't gotta go to South Bronx to get your Furious Five
40 ounce of malt liquor, joint stuffed with the pie
Boss nigga, best nigga, let y'all do deciding
Hot spitter, dead niggas, man we been through the wire
Somebody call 'em up and let 'em know I been doin' it
You're not that inventive with that coloured hair you're losing it
Imma everyday struggle 'til I get to the top
I study Em, Big, Tech N9ne, 2Pac
Come to my crib unannounced I got a big t-tech to pop
I dumped 9 missing bodies in the f-fucking car lot
And when I'm mad, I get green like the Hulk
Til my brain goes pop and then them thangs go po-po-po-pow

[Verse 2: Erick the Architect]
Introducing the Jamie Hewlett of rapper music
Influenced by Stanley Kubrick, exclusive for all my hooligans
Oh, we just recruit again, I can take your prestige
Peculiar with my beats like Juice would be with his weed
Apostle like Meechy Darko, watch Ellington DJ (these)
If triple A could record again, Zion may be at ease
I promised y'all Josh would hold it down, discipline when I (beef)
Disgruntled with all this Fronto, tell Trav to chill with the leaf
My parents should know I love 'em, my momma locked in the grief
I finished this album up, but she barely able to speak
I uncle to everyone I put that on my future (niece)
The sooner you see the picture, you defecate on belief
Living peaceful with keys, messiah with ganja trees
My confidence out the roof, and that done help me believe
Inglorious with them keys, no snortin I can't agree
Living life like a king and there's somethin' I'd rather be

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Silence as the semi's shooting sideways at your siblings
Excuse me for the sibilance beginners study and listen
My only mission is to burn in hell and not in prison
That's why I'm spitting shit that make Jesus question religion
This fan told me her parents said I sound like the devil
To me I sound like a poor black kid from the ghetto
Hello, my health declining I'm losing my mind my life's The Shining
Don't know why I love violence, the sight of blood is so exciting
Grip the pistol, coke off a nipple
My brain fried, my memory sizzled, my hood is vicious, don't get it twisted
They hog tied my grandmama and whipped my grandpa with pistols
That's a fact, OG reefer hash wax
Motherfuck your platinum plaque, snakes eat rats
My cellie keep ringing ringing, think they got my phone tapped
Acid trips like activists on Actavis, never pacifist
Pass the spliff, immaculate this is the return of Count Racula
Nothing scare me, I think my real mother is Bloody Mary
I met Virgin Mary and popped her cherry
My vision exquisite I see you clearly
I'm a mix, Manson greatest hits with a hint of 2Pacalypse
And I feed my dog gun powder, carve crucifx on hollow tips
I do not exist, all this weed why I need a therapist
Bitch, I'm a mix, Manson greatest hits with a hint of 2Pacalypse
And I feed my dog gun powder, carve crucifx on hollow tips
I do not exist, all this weed why I need a therapist

"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
"Why I feel like the past is catching up to my ass"
