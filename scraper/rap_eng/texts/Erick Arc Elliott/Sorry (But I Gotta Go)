Hope to see you front row stage with a smile on
A thousand of my fans singing my songs
I told you I'd be with you if this world ends
And you can say "wo yeah that's my boyfriend"
On tour, promised you my heart
Guaranteed you're the first? when I depart
Understand I gotta make it doin' what I love
It's comin', but I'd rather be beside you when it does
Now I'm workin' hard on bein' sensible and sweet
When it comes to music you've been nothing but discreet
And I spend so much, but you loungin' on the beach
On our way home I write about it when you sleep
But I disappear at nights
You were really fed up
Reachin' for my bedside when you wouldn't get up
Not there, I return with a reason too
Just recordin', I never thought of leaving you

Sorry, but I gotta go
And this rapping is the only living thought I know
We could go wishing that I wasn't wrong for you
I know you won't listen
So I wrote a song for you

Separated from the days we exist
You love me but you wanna turn away when we kiss
I don't have the time
My flight leaves at 9: 30
I board the plane late if you would grind for me
I'm in a? with my thoughts so I can't write
Cuz everything I'm jotting down never sounds right

It used be so peaches and cream, girl
I know it ain't right but that's what I dream, girl
I never tried till we saying goodbye
Touchdown in June and return late in July
Yo I'm coming back and I hate making you cry
Praying for this rap shit I aim for the sky
I wish there was a way for me to give you part of me
So if I'm not around you can have my artistry
Struggle when I write it, that's not what bothers me
Keep it to my music and I know it's hard to see
And I know it

Sorry, but I gotta go
And this rapping is the only living thought I know
We could go wishing that I wasn't wrong for you
I know you won't listen
So I wrote a song for you
