[Verse 1: Reefä]
Yo, Flinders Lane
The place where the rich and poor
Are living on the same plane
The place where any other niggas don’t know your name
Except for mine, but I’m to blame
Because I’m the nigga who fucked up this game
It’s not a shame, flowing insane
Putting THC up in my brain
Turning it, converting it to lyrically acclaimed
Chemically, too much kinetic energy with my words
Cos they are flowing super fast
Rehearse with no verbs
And my mama always told me eat your herbs
But then I interpreted what she said as toke your ‘urb
Smoke your green
Fulfil your dreams
Know what I mean
Cos ever since the age of fifteen
I been rapping on the scene
Doing it so clean
Don’t feel like a fucking human being
Cos I’m that nigga from the streets of the South East
Rapping like a beast to the beats
Something you can’t teach
Inspiration from my fuckin’ nigga Z
Shout out to my other brother named Keezh
But don’t forget my nigga Marnz
Sorry, hey my nigga Ramz
What up, what you niggas reckon of the song
Something fresh to keep my real homies calm
And you know you wanna rap along
So get it on
Cos I been waiting patiently, not hastily
To be the greatest MC
You will ever fucking meet
I know it’s my time
Yo it’s not that absurd
Cos I rhyme tight
Niggas don’t be too scurred
I’m bout to shine bright
You this is something to learn
I do it all night
Cos this is mother fucking Melbourne

[Hook]
The only mother fucking place where you see every race
It’s Melbourne
Niggas are never concerned cos this is fuckin’ Melbourne

[Verse 2: Reefä]
It’s Melbourne city
Pretty fucking trippy
Full of hippies
Ripping billies
Getting silly
But not to many niggas
With the skill for the business
The one that makes them fitty's
The one that gets them biddies
The one that requires a crazy flow, for a video
So here we go
Yo I never lay low and you know
Faggots won’t even try to burn down
The place that I call my hometown
Cos y’all can look around and see
Black and white and brown
And even yellow cos they are my gangsta Asian fellows
Yo, this ain’t LA or NYC
Cos it’s the mother fucking one and only CBD
And this is R to the double E
To the F, to the A
Homies love my track while they toking Mary Jane
No one has the courage to complain
Cos they know my flow just hits them right in the fucking brain
You can try to deny that my lyrics are insane
But I won’t stop till I’m at the top of this game
And till every mother fucking producer knows my name
I’ll have that fame
Cos damn it’s fucking Melbourne
With it’s own underground rappers
But it’s harder than Cali cos ain’t no chitter chatters
Just people working hard, thinking that they matter
But its almost inevitable for their dreams to shatter
And thinking that learning physics is living
But I memorised that speed equals distance over time
And add direction, now you gotcha self a vector line
Yeah, I know my fucking physics over rhymes
Cos my flow is so divine
I combine more lines in my mind
I’m ten steps ahead never rewind
I know this is a sign that I will shine
Cos when I’m rapping a cold chill will travel down your spine
Making you shiver, but I’m not a killer
Just a nigga drinking liquor by the Yarra River
With the quicker lyrics, you feel it
It’s so exquisite, yeah I’m talking bout the place we’re living
Not many killings and plenty of sexy women
Just listen, cos this is fucking Melbourne

[Hook]
The only mother fucking place where you see every race
It’s Melbourne
Niggas are never concerned cos this is fuckin’ Melbourne
