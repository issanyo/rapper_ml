[Verse 1]
If you don't know the story, turn guts into the glory
If you could tell it better why don't you just write it for me?
All I record when the opportunity is here
My friends stopped calling cause we ain't seen them in years
Besides, you'll never change that
I lost touch with all my homies out from way back
Now I'm afraid that you'll ask me who I'm fighting for, and maybe then I might recall
Went to school, rocked the same outfit as the night before
I wrote this rhyme until I fell asleep
And some will say "they problems never dissipate, they only run away"
I'm guarded by my lonely status
The thing that only matters
Rappers wrapping circles but they recognize me as the baddest
This struck the square form, this here is rare form
I sent your soul love, so here's the prayer form
Every time I'm waking up you're right behind me, not beside me
I just really need your light to guide me

[Hook]
Meeting on my steps, gotta make sure it's crystal-clear
And while it's here, any moment I could disappear
D-d-disappear d-d-disapear
And while it's here, and moment I could disappear (and I be gone)
And while it's here, any moment I could disappear

[Verse 2]
So every thing I ever did and ever loved dearly
Only fell apart at first until I brought it near me
You only fear in one that's why I think you're so funny
Had my tongue in cheek cause' I always knew you stole from me
I'm feeling nervous, but always knew my purpose
Spill the coffee out and pour the liquor in my thermos
Rose pedals at my feet until I close the curtains
Sorry pastor Gauns, I won't make it to your service
I'm wasted with an alcoholic tendency
So I paste it, got me jotting everything I see
And I placed it right into this paper [?]
Say they rap style nappy, they picking on me
It's not profane, it's not a war
It's just a feeling that I get when I popped a cork
A celebration to the stars
Not the Hollywood ones, the Hollyhood ones
That hardly hear guns where I'm from

[Hook]
Getting on my steps, gotta make sure it's crystal-clear
And while it's here, any moment I could disappear
D-d-disappear d-d-disappear
And while it's here, any moment I could disappear (and I be gone)
And while it's here, any moment I could disappear

(And while it's here, any moment I could disappear)
