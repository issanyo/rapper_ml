[Verse 1: Juice]
Gotta get this cheddar mane, but fuck the fame
Go deep in the game but sharks don't sink gotta focus on my cream (cream)
And life is what you make it
Don't count my money homie, riding round up with the lonely
One for my niggas, two for the hoes
Ain't no pussy like new pussy I'm trynna get them drawers
Funky bitches, they trynna burn you up like napalm
Exploding, open my eyes then I'm ghosting
Don't think, baby just don't think
Take it all in, for Christ's sake
Sour on the hour every hour after hour
Power power to my sistahs and my niggas doing digits
Soon we'll overpower, come togetherc devour
We shower the media, drug paraphernalia
Craft is mathematical, shrooms stomach compatible
Rational radical blastin' the masses, the powerful
So don't blame we if you tryin' to do drugs
So don't blame we if your shit's a fuckin' dud
Muddy waters, black timbs I breach borders
Servin' quarters, crooked cops federal orders
Extortion, niggas get lost, paid the fortune
I'm wicked as awesome, I'm really the source, them niggas is frauds I see it often
How you a boss with a pink tie on?
I know niggas that would eat you for your dub and your sneakers
Bang bang, chopper hit, sing it like Aretha
New school nigga with an old school flow
Getting show money, flip that shit like a ho
Getting drug money, probably get ya for your o's
And life is hard, when you think about the old
Past situations got your heart feeling cold
Better off dead, death before dishonor
Death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
Steez is gone, now let's pray
That's forty-seven hundred niggas waitin' for the day
