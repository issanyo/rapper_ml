[Pastor Willcall (Meechy Darko)]
Although, this is the day
It is also a tribute
To all of you freaks here now
I see you smilin', nigga
Heh, for knowing you and interacting with you-ah
Has helped to make Bobby and Stacey
Who they need to be to find each other now, know what I'm sayin'
They would like to thank you all for that
I would also like to thank you for paying me in advance
All of you are the threads, which have woven the first coogi sweater of theirs
Each one of you is an important piece, in the story it tells
It is, is, it is, it is the fabric they wrap around themselves
And take comfort in when the world seems cold
As cold as the mountain top, as cold as uh, the iceberg
Way colder than any of their releases with Snoopie
And Snoop be doing all that shit
Is there anybody who wants to, uh, speak out against, why
These two, beautiful pieces of black Nubian cashmere
Shouldn't join hands in marriage
