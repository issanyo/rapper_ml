[Chorus]
Homie just roll the dice, there’s trouble in paradise
I know we depend on everything disappearing tonight
We rebels in every since of the word, send the alert
We sensitive about beginning, we finish winning with words

Homie just roll the dice there’s trouble in paradise
And know we depend on everything disappear in the night
We rebels every since of the word send the alert
We sensing y'all beginners we finishing winning with words

[Verse]
I’m hooked on this kind of vision
Consistent but still conflicted
Meticulous supervision, a system built on the prison
Pollution we clash with Putin
Improving a massive movement
Amusing, imagine Uber maneuver through life as losers
They weaken us all, so we can’t even evolve
One day you’re making a call
Next thing they bleaching the coral
We done turned summer to fall
Hot as the cold in the war
Hot as the newest couture
Girl they gon change the decor
This is a PSA for the USA
We gon make mistakes I don’t feel the same way, crack the case
Feeling black now, 9-5 NY
Crack down bullets in your bulletin
Ignore what’s in the background
Feel it in your skin melanin dripping gold
Questioning your knowledge if you don’t know where to go
Streets tell a story, and there’s stories to be told
Little maricon, quick to cook it on the stove

[Chorus]
Homie just roll the dice, there’s trouble in paradise
I know we depend on everything disappearing tonight
We rebels in every since of the word, send the alert
We sensitive about beginning, we finish winning with words

Homie just roll the dice there’s trouble in paradise
And know we depend on everything disappear in the night
We rebels every since of the word send the alert
We sensing y'all beginners we finishing winning with words

Homie just roll the dice, there’s trouble in paradise
I know we depend on everything disappearing tonight
We rebels in every since of the word, send the alert
We sensitive about beginning, we finish winning with words

Homie just roll the dice there’s trouble in paradise
And know we depend on everything disappear in the night
We rebels every since of the word send the alert
We sensing y'all beginners we finishing winning with words
