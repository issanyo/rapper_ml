[Lionel (Zombie Juice), Erick and Pastor Willcall (Meechy Darko) conversating]
- Oh my! Is-Is that Pastor Willcall coming over here?
- I think it is
- Oh my goodness. Not him again, he's always asking me about my voice
- Brother Erick! Brother Lionel!
- Praise him
- What's the word?
- Pastor Willcall, I presume, are you still banging that girl that lives over by that lakehouse?
- Brother! Brother! That was a long time ago. I no longer desire the flesh of a woman who can't say she was sorry for talking out of turn
- Damn!
- And brother Lionel, WHAT is going on with you? You ever figured out why your voice is like that?
- Like what? (like what, like what)
- Very well then, carry on gentlemen

Now at this point the liquor is flowing
And everybody's starting to feel it
It's lit, but Bobby wants to have his basketball moment in front of the wedding party and decides, to want to tell the story of how he met Stacey

[Bobby and Stacey on the stage, Bugga in the crowd]
- Attention everybody
Okay, the first time I met Stacey a couple years ago, I gotta admit, from the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one for me
*Bugga mumbling*
- She was going for a jog in a football jersey, in the center of the town, number 37, I think. She was the cutest little thing
The first thing I asked her was, was what song she was listening to on her Walkman. I didn't what to say to a woman this beautiful
She told me she was listening to a 90's R'n'B playlist she made, and the song that she was playing was
- Candy Rain
- Thats right. From that moment I met her, all I could think of was that song. When I played that song I immediatly thought of Stacey
I would always see her in the same area on the weekends
So I tried to find any reason to be around her
I went and bought some jogging gear, and would jog up and down that same block, sometimes, for hours
Hoping I'd bump into her
Atleast I got a good workout from chasing her
I was never into that kind of stuff, I played ball though
- You was a'ight, but that was sweet
- Thanks. Yo! You need some water?
- Nah, I'm good my n-, I'm good

You know niggas like toast
Even if it's burnt
You get a butter knife to scrape the black off
