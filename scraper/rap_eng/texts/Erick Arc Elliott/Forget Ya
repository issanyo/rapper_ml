[Hook] x2
Gualla on the counter cooking in the kitchen
Money on my mind 20/20 vision
Purple in my cup and the room is spinnin'
Girl if I smoke this blunt then I'm gonna forget ya

[Verse 1: Bobby Trill]
Now I been doing things that you ain't never seen
Off this molly water chase it with promenthazine
Come to Bobby's world girl I can give you what you need
Cocaine on the dresser mixed with ketamine
These amphetamines, got me speedin' while I lean
90 in a 65, the reaper's right in front of me
Floating off a flat, my nigga cool before we hit the door
In the cut ho, pretty bitch monopoly
I got these niggas mad so cuff your chick or she'll be topping me
Aphrodisiac my dick she craving like some ginseng
If you ain't talkin' money dawg then I ain't really listenin'
Diamonds dancin' on my fist she love the way they glisten
Put the pussy out commission while the trill spitta bring that fire
Molded from the Earth, Gucci'd out young messiah
Creature of the night so bitch don't kill my buzz
You fuckin' with some pretty thugs
Based flow nigga yeah we rollin' drugs

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Bobby Trill]
Cancerous growth, don't play the same position
Toking all this Buddha's got me thinkin' sour diesel is the main commission
When I switch the flow, my conscience overloads
Simply semi-comatosed
A penny for my thoughts will leave you fucking broke
What you mean bitch that you ain't down to pipe?
I got the hash and the light, we gettin' lifted off these earthly visions
Bring me down from the clouds...
Poetic justice on my tongue tip wrap your mind around this subject
Toil in the fields, sun beating off my black skin
Wipe the sweat from my brow, mix it with this juice and gin
Within the soul you split, resides another being
Lurking in the shadows opened up cerebral thoughts are fleeing
(yeah)...but, back to  the pimpin' and the hoes
Trappin' out the bando, blood on my Louis sandles
Hang your head above the mantle
Spark the spliff bitch nah I don't know your name but we can kick it 'til the sun rises
