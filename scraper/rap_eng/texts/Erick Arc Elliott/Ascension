[Hook: Meechy Darko]
I have ascended, I'm trying to be better than God
What the fuck am I saying?
I have ascended, I'm trying to be better than God
What the fuck am I saying? I ain't even enter my prime
Taking over the world, we'll do it one day at a time
Time is an illusion, I think that I'm losing my mind
I have ascended, I'm trying to be better than God
What the fuck am I saying? I ain't even enter my prime
Taking over the world, we'll do it one day at a time
Time is an illusion, I think that I'm losing my mind

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
You might've, heard that I got touch like Midas
I might just use pliers to pull teeth don't bite us
That bites us, red dot, head shot
Kick rocks or bite dust don't like us then try us
Your family get tied up your wifey she tied up cause she fucked the both us so much swear that probably use that gun on yo' holster and bang yourself now you know cancel you're over
Chip off the ol' block, chip on my shoulders
See pain in my eyes, burden on shoulders
Why God move the sun without burning his shoulders?
I'm cold brah, venomous cobra
Clutch on my weapon raise from waist to shoulder
Level you looking disheveled I'm on a new level
The Devil conducts all his tests in the ghetto
Go 'head and contest with a rebel roll heavy with metal
I'm reading your mental cause

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
I have ascended, I'm trying to be better than God
What the fuck am I saying? I ain't even enter my prime
Taking over the world, we'll do it one day at a time
Time is an illusion, I think that I'm losing my mind
I have ascended, I'm trying to be better than God
What the fuck am I saying? I ain't even enter my prime
Taking over the world, we'll do it one day at a time
Time is an illusion, I think that I'm losing my mind
