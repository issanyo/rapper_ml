[Verse 1:]
I remember you didn’t give a damn
And i’m stressing cause it was affecting who I am
Race you through the streets without a cars
Apologizing to the memories of all my flaws
Still awaited for the love, but I gotta set them free
The problem is they don’t really want to let me be
But I see, and I found flows similar to Banksy
Times ticking fast escaping every moment frankly
But in due time ima win a presidential candidate
Recognize how the game is covered in my manuscript
Docking pay, surgery, moms still [?] but she can't
So I paint the world for what it goes to be
Imagine if my spirit had an image for my fame
And every rapper dedicated all their lyrics to the game
I would love it, and only one man stands above it
This is public, i’m achieving correlated to the budget
All my idols aren’t living they’re in heaven up above
If I was on my death bed I would tell em pull the plug
I am loved I am hated by the catered crowd
Ghetto documentary symbolizing for the greatest style
I made you smile when I spoke like a cloud over sand
Your eyes tan noticing I no longer am here for you
I fell apart again, I’m at a park with friends
I ran a marathon hoping I could spark a trend
Occupation MC not just what I plan to be
Fueled by the cost of disagreement with my family
Time’s getting lonesome, thought I’d plead insanity
It’s almost like these record deals are often chosen randomly
But I won’t impose, every single ? nose
Time is of the essence even if his watch is over froze
I compose pros all across the globe, so this gold
To the projects tenements and motor homes
