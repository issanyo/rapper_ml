[Hook: Meechy Darko]
I'm lit
My weed is good, my wallet's thick
OG and designer shit, police stop and try and frisk
I'm lit
Shows in every continent, hoes give me vagina quick
I boast 'bout my accomplishments
I'm lit
Young, black, and brag-a-docious
I'm fucking focused, I'm talking shit cause you need to know this
I'm lit
Oh, now you fucking noticed?
You fucking bogus, I should hire my man to smoke you

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique
I'm lit, she on my dick
Probably cause my flow timeless
I'm Flee, must I remind you
Darko, zombie gang, walking carcass
My Jordans so old, they need walkers
Pardon as I lay back and spark this
Chick with me, caked up, nice titties
Dog, I take a bite out of Hello Kitty
Lick licky, it must be the liquor in me
She suck so hard, she gave my dick hickies
Always pull out, even with a rubber
Some women are extra fertile
And all my niggas get a slice like the ninja turtles
That's it, one hit from the spliff and I'm, I'm, I'm

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
It's that smooth, trippy hippy
Women, guard your kitty
OG only, reefer good, that's all me
Ass fat, passed that
Head so good, that's an asset
Old boy don't treat you right
Play you like a toy, can't sleep tonight
Juicy wet, dripping wet
Juicee beat it up like a long set, long breaths
I stroke it, soaking good like the ocean
I blow it down
Weed so loud, never tone it down

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
I don't smoke cigars, but aw, fuck it, why not
Used to be a nigga, now I'm still a nigga, rolling
When I move the rollers
If you haven't noticed, I don't listen what they told us
Cause a nigga too focused
When I'm overseas, expensive entertainment
Eloquence runs through me like the rain did
Pride ain't do much for me, but the pain did
Pussy so good, I want to frame it
Sumptuous, ain't it
Material hearts, well this one is gold-plated
Also, I hate when niggas invite me to car shows
Rather invest my own money in the bar codes
Distributing music
Quick to take a piss in your jacuzzi
Champagne got me feeling woozy
Roll one before I catch my flight
That OG had me feeling light
