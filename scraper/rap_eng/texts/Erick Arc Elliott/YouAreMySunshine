[Intro Verse: Meechy Darko + sample]
No lie, I stopped getting high once we lost Yams
I was there the night he died, he was blue cold in my hands
Ain't been the same since that day, god damn
You was a prophet, huh, you was a king, you was a visionary
You formed more than the Mob who made you more military
You, always supported
Missed your funeral, I wasn't man enough to see you in a coffin
But I give you this offering and hope that you forgive me
Cause truthfully in my eyes, you was king of this city
I know you're smiling down, sharing Backwoods with Biggie
Fuck, hold on, I'm bout to cry ("You are my sunshine")

[Full Verse: Meechy Darko]
No lie, I stopped getting high once we lost Yams
I was there the night he died, he was blue cold in my hands
Ain't been the same since that day, god damn
You was a prophet, you was a king, you was a visionary
You formed, more than the Mob, you made you a military
You, always supported
Missed your funeral, I wasn't man enough to see you in a coffin
But to you I give this offering and hope that you forgive me
Cause truthfully in my eyes, you was king of this city
I know you're smiling down, sharing a Backwood with Biggie
Rocking Aaliyah' boat and taking a tab with Jimi
Pimping with Sweet Jones, gold grilling with ODB
In the studio, tryna fight tears and shit
I just wish my nigga Yams was here to hear this shit
He in the clouds, angels braiding his hair and shit
Just looking down like "God, you hear this shit?"
I hope we make you proud cause we next up at the mound
And I'ma Always $trive And Prosper until the world is ours
I hope we make you proud cause I'm next up at the, uh...

[Outro]
You are my sunshine, you are my sunshine
You are my sunshine, you are my sunshine
You are my sunshine, you are my sunshine (do-do-do do-do-do do do)
You are my sunshine, you are my sunshine
You are my sunshine, you are my sunshine (do-do-do do-do-do do do)
You are my sunshine, you are my sunshine
Own the day, own the day, own the day
