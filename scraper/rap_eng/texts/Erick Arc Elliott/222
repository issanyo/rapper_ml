[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliot]
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A nigga never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A nigga never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Reality is wisdom, perspective
Eye like Horus, I don't like whores
Hindsight, oh my, I adore, for the time being, yes, I am yours
Trump, my card, it's the ace of spades
And I hate to go away without getting this money made
But niggas be telling to believe in a reason to act up
Nigga lose his job, blame it all on some bad luck
Roller coaster, my eyes not open
The cold comes every season, trick
In the summer we smoke hunnids, my fall comes often evil shit
Just spews from my mind, I get confused all the time
My wall of space is confined, so you better elevate or lose time
Just lose time

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliot]
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A nigga never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
Say dat, I don't play that
I be acting as if I'm a better man
And my mother to my brother from another
Boy, oh yes you can
From my sisters that keep the shit right
And my mothers that'll kiss you good night
Forty slugs in my liquor cup
Take a shot and I pick you up
Bang bang from the same gang
Kick rocks if you can't hang
Lil nigga, what you saying, mane?
Roll up but these lame hangs
Rolling up was a plane, mane
In the hood, it's all good, made our own Hollywood
Took a picture the system my mental track me like a alien
I combine thoughts with divine course
And exhale exhaust from my skeleton
Tell her I won't appear again
Fuck that, if I'm going, who will even care again?
Hate to be American, get away from experiments
Cause the truths in the pyramids
Cause we all fucking immigrants
And you're lying through your filaments
Lay back if you drink a bit
And indulge in the nigga shit
This is real nigga rhetoric
Dissolve all the simple shit, play a different game
It's too easy to be ignorant
Lay back, think a bit

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliot]
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A nigga never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good
Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too

[Bridge: Bridget Perez & (Erick Arc Elliott)]
Boy, I must be dreaming (fuck all that other shit)
The way you got me speaking (fuck all that other shit)
Hope that I'm not tripping because (fuck uh, oh god)
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do (nah)
(One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo)
(Two times, two times for my ladies that are not a ho)
(One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo)
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
Angel, want me for my peso
Telling other niggas you ain't never gonna wait
So I smash in the Range Rove
Beat beat then I add her to the payroll
Smoke another dub with a cousin and a bro
But I won't say it slow
Missing, representing the people that won't grow
So I carry lethal weapons that beat you through postal
Where the foes go, where we ever gon' go?
To the highest of the Horus eye
Fuck thoughts I am going 'til there's no reply
Flatline, I get lost 'n bossed
Metal cup passed it first
Never parked the cars
We ain't Boston, nigga
Ransom, nigga
We're on some now so explain it to me, nigga
I don't really know but gold ...

[Bridge: Bridget Perez & (Erick Arc Elliott)]
Boy, I must be dreaming (fuck all that other shit)
The way you got me speaking (fuck all that other shit)
Hope that I'm not tripping because (fuck uh, oh god)
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do (nah)
(One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo)
(Two times, two times for my ladies that are not a ho)
(One time, one time for my niggas of the Indigo)
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do

[Outro: Erick Arc Elliott]
Angel, want me for my peso
Telling other niggas you ain't never gonna wait
So I smash in the Range Rove
Beat beat then I add her to the payroll
