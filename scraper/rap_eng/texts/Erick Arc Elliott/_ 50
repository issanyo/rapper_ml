(Yea) (Uh) (Sour)
[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
Disorderly when the quarter hit me
Sorta trippy, nigga say I'm or-?
'Cus i order Henny, but I order slaughter Benny
Dentist so they feel it, gotta feel it, gotta feel it!
Golden Arc, so on like that purple -
Fast food, like lyrics
Got tunes like Hendrix
A nigga so broke now (oh), can't fix it
A nigga you can stick, assume the opposition
Don't leave it unattended, just remember that I am pimpin
So don't brake the code, not the molden, swag is not the clothing
We're all born, naked blind and we fuck naked right?
Beatiful, that's why im screwing you
Never been delutionel, my outcome just the usual
Nigga's saying nicotine, is it me?
If hell is a vivid dream, then we both smoke it
So why is he provoking me, hopefully I'm touring overseas
Overdose some O-ease, tell a ho please

(Who?!)

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliot]
64 Mary-O, money 'til my time is up
64 Vary-O, smoking 'til I'm mindfucked
Meech got the son, Juice got the son, Prince!
Zombie-Game this the militant shit
One tab of don't-trip
I went from closed lips, never those lips (x2)
So I'm ghost in, Arcitecht feel the potion (x2)
