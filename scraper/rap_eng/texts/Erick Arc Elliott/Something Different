[Verse 1]
Now I know that rapping don’t make me immortal, bitch
But I know that rapping can make me important, bitch
Now I’m the type of guy that gets mood swings, smack a bitch
I’m the type of guy that takes two swings at a bitch
And this from someone who meditate like a Buddhist
Having haters left and right asking how he do this
The truth is, I don’t even know though
My mood goes up and down, like bouncing on a pogo
Stick, photo this
My eyes play tricks when I trip
I think I’m seeing spirits, thinking that you hear this
But you ain’t hear shit
All you hear is 2 Chainz bragging about his whip
He likes his cars how he likes his dogs, no roof
Bet he likes bitches in their youth with no tooth
I have to admit I disapprove
I like bitches young, but he likes them under 2
On da Tuesday I be sitting with my crew
Guess I’m on my own again, who would of knew
Organised a threesome no-shows account to 2
Still had a good time, just me and my boo
If you’re smart you’d know I mean my right hand
This ain’t how I normally spit; it’s just how I can
I ain’t from the hood, ain’t from the gangland
But rappers get shook when they see a pen in my hand
Pending on their actions might have an interaction
Won’t go well, wise for them to be absent
I’m from the UK you can tell by my accent
People say I can’t rap but who fucking asked them
I find a superhero and then I’ll unmask them
I don’t give two shits if they fly I’ll fly past them
Past all the planes and past all the choppers
People say I’m so sick should go to the doctors
People listen to Tyler but I’m even odder
People fear the fire but bitch I’m even hotter
I got no worries Hakuna matata
I just referenced Lion King, guess I’m Mufasa
And I can move faster than everyone of you
You’re all too slow like you’re seventy-two
You’re all still sleeping, get a third eye view
Time for you to wake up, cock-a-doodle-doo
I can choose to chew on any fucking rapper
I spit hot and I’m white that’s a firecracker
Shots be fired at ya, if you try to battle me
I’m so unstable you unable to handle me
I’m only un-signed cos they can’t label me
Your rhymes are fables, my rhymes fatalities
Sitting at the roundtable thinking who to roundhouse
Your rhymes so suspect, bitch you just got found out
Y-Y-Y-Y-You let this hound out
I’m the fucking king so pass me my crown now
I spit from the sundown until the sunrise
I’m nocturnal like an owl, and I am wise
You think you rap sick bitch stop these fucking lies
I’m the fucking shit can’t you see these fucking flies
