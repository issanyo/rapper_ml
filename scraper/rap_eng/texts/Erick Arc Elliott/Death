[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
Zombie Juice
Spitting shit, disfigured like ligaments
Picture the making of this, my hands tied
Watch the smoke flow by, by, bye-bye
On the porch, Newports, packs of the loud, new bitch packing the crowds
The macking spectacular, is you fucking or nothing?
Mmm, a little sumchin
Bitch, you know I'm buzzing, bumpity bumping
Packs in the back of Mack's trunk and drunk and
We up yet we slumping, Zombie fully function
Fu-fu-fuck corruption, lies vivid as Jenna's titties
Terrorist experiments, America's full of shit, uh
Blinded by skin color, blinded by his lover
Blinded by shining lights, and you the gift of life
Relax my mind 'til it's do or die
Each moment's a mineral, poetry's protein
The verse is a vitamin, effects like codeine

[Chorus]
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
Meechy Darko
DTA, I don't trust none of my homies
Juice laced my spliff with PCP and never told me
Passed me a cup of bleach and said Meech sip on this codeine
Wash it down with OE, now I'm throwed up like O.G.'s
My voice hold the beat down, it's the anchor
And my nigga stay with the metal like Kurt Angle
Zombies blowing up like the Boston marathon, boom
What, too soon? Opposite of late bloom
Dunk from the free throw since I was spewed from the womb
Survival of the fittest, I ate my twin in the womb
And due to Robin Givens, I may never jump the broom
And while you pay for pussy I was out in paid dues
Stage diving turned a couple thousand people to my pool
You a fool if you think I ain't on the move
I am it, I am new, I exude
But cannot be reproduced, execute for my grimy and my destitute

[Chorus]
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
The Architect
Spit in your face at the pearly gates
At twenty-four a nigga special like he thirty-eight
The limerick I kick is four finger ring shit
I twist a motherfucker limbs up like a green spliff
Defying odds
No fa√ßade, man my city like Oz
So with this tree of weed I'm never tryna be the prize
Rap, produce, half a Muse when I scribe thought
A quiet man, so if I can't stand then I'ma fall
I'd rather be a failure than never mentioned at all
The dimensions of the mind measure crime like yellow tape
Music the bass, swap my heart for an 808
You outta shape, smoking great good god, like J.R
Nostrils filled with the potency of smoking kief
All the windows down so you know it's me
Bow down, my radiator hiss like my Amy Wine vinyl, for now

[Chorus]
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
