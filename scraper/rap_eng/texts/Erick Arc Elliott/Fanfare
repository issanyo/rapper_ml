[Verse 1]
I’m too quiet they said I didn’t speak enough
I let the tape deck rock till my speakers bust
Until it came to pass, I hope to make some cash
So I can buy my mother something just to make her laugh
My recorder, my lyrics that i’m dead off
Money got shorter and my sneaker game fell off
You garbage and you still recycle while I replay
Couple years back I got my Triton off of ebay
Produced my own shit and the feeling man that shit was crazy
Before that I was rocking with the 50-80
My drum kit bang hardest in my MV, but I heard it bang harder in that MP
Yo I didn’t have the beats, but I had a hobby that’ll keep me off the streets
Writing cause I wanted to and not because i’m ill
Just wanted to assure you understood how I feel


[Hook]
How could you tell me to get through it (get through it) X4


[Verse 2]
I can’t address what it takes to be the best
Cause I was still in school I wrote my rhymes up on the desk
The teacher couldn’t point me out because I had the smarts
But mom’s felt sick and I almost fell apart
How could you tell me to get through it
I had the standing drum kits with the stock sounds
And tracked out, 200 beats and you knocked down
That I been working on, docked hours clocking 3 to 10
But my samples didn’t match up with the BPM
Couldn’t take the criticism, caught me throwing fits
Wanted your opinion but i’m really getting pissed
The drugs were too stiff, reduction wasn’t crisp
And I learned a large part of production is the mix
Caught myself rapping too, and then I act a fool
Beat boxing with my boys, chillin' spittin' after school
Rap was in a different age, same book different page
Getting paid, writing songs in hopes that they were getting played
Dreams grew wilder, i’m rapping in the mirror
If you getting sick of rappers then i’m acting as the serum
To the song I signed off saying I would hold it down
You want the crown well than here let me show you how

[Hook]
