[Hook 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
It's that work hard, play hard
Make you quit that day job
I smoked so much this year we couldn't even take a day off
I plan to take a trip
Want the money how it's spent
I just re-up
Plus I just payed my phone and the rent

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
Hey, it's lit
Call my partners up, we going up, you slowing up
I never judge, we do indulge
In truth I never touch this stuff
One puff of that fluffy stuff, shit hit me like a sucker punch
Side effects include mass paranoia plus the cotton mouth
Down another bottle with my niggas
Before this was a movie we pictured us living bitter
And I forgive 'em, whatever, whatever
Telling me different
Nothing is given without sacrifices
Something is close to niggas to chill with
Pray for the children
The government spiking penicillin
And lord willin'
We all live to be 20 million
Outcome infinite dawg, where is the ceiling?
Cause five years ago we came to be without disappearing

[Hook 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
It's that work hard, play hard
Make you quit that day job
I smoked so much this year we couldn't even take a day off
I plan to take a trip
Want the money how it's spent
I just re-up
Plus I just payed my phone and the rent

[Hook 2: Zombie Juice]
It's that work hard, play hard
I just got a blow job
Smoke so much this year we couldn't even take a day off
Twenty something years, I never had a fucking day job
Never ask for truth, it's what expected, it's a trade-off

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Real nigga shit, getting money bound to flip
Now turned on like I'm the shit
Bitch I told you how it gets
Itâ€™s that mixtape rap blunt wrapped up in a album
In a audi black tote straps lookin' for yack
So I can go top speed with the blinkers on
Screaming "Fuck the world", Martin King is gone
Who am I? Who am I?
Handsome guy, might stunt on you niggas with a patch on my eye
Please, turn up the headphones I speak the value
I pray for freaks, we gon bring the outcome
Toke, toke and choke
We just need your vocals
So this is the future, ain't what your used to
Four years ago I was poorer than you are
Trapping in the lobby and the back of a U-haul

[Hook 2: Zombie Juice]
It's that work hard, play hard
I just got a blow job
Smoke so much this year we couldn't even take a day off
Twenty something years, I never had a fucking day job
Never ask for truth, it's what expected, it's a trade-off

[Hook 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
It's that work hard, play hard
Make you quit that day job
I smoked so much this year we couldn't even take a day off

I just re-up

[Hook 3: Meechy Darko]
This that work hard, play hard
Rest in peace to Trayvon
Did so much different drugs this year I'm feeling so amazing
LSD them potent doses smoking 'til I take off
Two freaks, one Meech, that's an even trade-off

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Rosemary's baby the hand I rock my cradle to the grave
I had six exorcisms this year alone and I feel the same
I'm high and  sleep deprived, having nightmares while I'm still awake
40 ounce, sipper, until my liver give away
I think I lost my mind and, I'm willing to trade my soul if you can find it
An even exchange I'm young and deranged
All these drugs in my body
Rawer than the kilo under my granddaddy pillow
Kill a cop, la-la-laugh, reload, ha-ha-ha
Drop classics, we now laugh at you niggas
I average 50, I don't feel the need to pass to you niggas
Roll up the sticky, young irrational nigga
Don't throw stones, unless your crib is shatter proof nigga
A headshot, now let's see if you splatter-proof nigga

[Hook 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Work hard, play hard
