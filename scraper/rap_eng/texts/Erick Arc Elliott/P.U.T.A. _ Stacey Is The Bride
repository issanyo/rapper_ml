Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Hook 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Goddamn
Roll one, roll two up for your man
When you ain't gotta weigh it out it's all lit
'Cause I smoke, I drink, I don't care
Tell 'em niggas something we ain't heard yet
Goddamn
Roll one, roll two up for your man
When you ain't gotta weigh it out it's all lit
'Cause I smoke, I drink, I don't care
Tell 'em niggas something we ain't heard yet

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Rolling Backwoods
Smoking Backwoods
Hit it, that good
Word to Mac, keep a gat for the jackers
And she want it, she can get it on the mattress
On the floor, ceiling fan (goddamn)
Thank the maker for this feelin' that I'm (goddamn)
Rest in peace to my nigga, nigga (goddamn)
Never stoppin' 'til they find me dead (rotten)
Fo' shizz, man roll them big [?]

[Hook 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
Mama told me to stop fucking with the maric贸ns
Hope she show up to the party with no panties on
Damn if it don't feel good (damn if it don't feel good)
I said damn if it don't feel good (damn if it don't feel good)
Mama told me to stop fucking with the maric贸ns
Hope she show up to the party with no panties on
Damn if it don't feel good (damn if it don't feel good)
I said damn if it don't feel good (damn if it don't feel good)

[Verse 3: Zombie Juice]
Hol' up
What it is, baby, tryna feel your big butt
Slim waist, shit, yo momma got a good girl
Lights off, no problem, what they good for?
Smoke out about an hour and I'm back for
And it seems like you ready
Bumpin' R.Kelly, I hope he got some condoms in the celly
And if that pussy right
You know I'm going to hit it like once, once (twice)
