[Verse 1:]
Had me like god damn almost had a chance doe
Your roommate Vicky called me when my pants low
She was into life and what it really stands for
And if not then you better let your mans know
I messed up and I almost let the chance go
And I’m hearing that she likes to be romanced so
I moved her up out the city that the plants grow
Where them hustlers payin 50 for the land pole
I remember when i begged her for a sample
She was stingy with it wouldn’t let my hands flow
I worked hard, god, I made plans fold
Made her boogie introduced her to the dance floor
I hold your heart what we need to hold hands for
Don’t mistake me for no lame with a banjo
Had a whole lotta cake but its blando
Chef’d a souffle something vicious so my fans know

[Hook:]
This the truth if its getting on your nerves fine
Im in the booth still thinking bout my first time
Kinda funny jealous women are the worst kind
In my mind still thinking bout my first time
And I strive but I still left you hurt crying
And inside still thinking bout my first time
Yea still thinking bout my first time
In my mind still thinking bout my first time

[Verse 2:]
She was a long way from my home town
But she already understood how it goes down
And all my boys know that she so foul
Wore her heart on her sleeve but she won’t smile
Late bloomer name was Mariah
Everybody trynna find a way to be inside her
Live-er, heard she did tricks with her saliva
So I hit eject and I watched some McGuyver
I was really on it, thought she was a catch
She rocked some good denim with a shirt and hat to match
But it always seemed that I never dreamed that
She was wack but I act as if I need that
While I roam my words are above poems
Through my father and my soul and my love jones
I give her that, more than just silly rap
Bring it back its a fact that I back in that kitty cat

[Hook:]
