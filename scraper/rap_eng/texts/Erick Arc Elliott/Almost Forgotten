[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Bowl is iller when you pass heavy
Flows that crack levees
So it sad shorty spread like it's mad berry
And though i act a fool, i crossed a lot of steps
I smoke this whole clip, until my eyes vignette
I go to heaven Meech told me put your bread in
So when I'm on the court i pass dish like a reverend
Tap into the conscious while you're making nonsense
Good dick will make a hipster chick
Come out of Tom slips
And so we dream on, a bunch of peons
A shoulder here to lean on
The engineer was Leon
Then i made my way into your heart before you hit the dial
And sold the second cities feeling like my second child
In the world of dead and genius and the immature?
It's ignorant to bitch on what you haven't done before
I told a story of how peter escaped the blues
Work is only temporary please don't make me choose
I know you're feeling mad as hell
Remember we all animals on this carousel
Park it 'til it's parallel
Swearing that you hot boss man, i got a better swing
Word is like my hot sauce, put that on everything

[Hook: Kaya]
You had too much pride at breakfast
And ignorance for lunch
Lost your mind at dinner
You're going to feel it more than once

[Verse 2]
I'm addressing her
Tongue wrestler
Cooch treasurer
I'm a pirate
And despite it
I just light it
While her thighs twitch
And the captain of the ship is my ____
Priceless, her eyes flip
And when you wake up
I'm rushing off the phone
She's hidden in your make up
Your blushing on your own
Admiring my fragrance
The smell of my cologne
A little immature
But damn girl you grown, huh
The way you do that, true that
And when you reaching down, where your shoe at?
Uh, i feel i knew that
But work because it's working out
And these other clowns [?] working out
Rapping ain't enough today prolly cuz' you need a buzz
Want my car super charged sorta like my Wheaties does
I am not a hippie stoner act a role in need of love
I just love hearing you talk about how good you thought it was
Learning lessons through the storybook
Only 22 just imagine how e40 looks
So tell me when to go
Whenever you're feeling low
Make sure you understand
I only want this thing to grow

[Hook: Kaya]
Grow our dreams at breakfast
Give my heart to you at lunch
Try to build together
We only keep the love in us
