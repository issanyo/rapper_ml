[Verse 1]
This time last year, I had a couple cuts
Eager to release and each song it wasn't rushed
And painted so vivid, a feeling you could touch
You wanna tell somebody but you keep it bottled up
I thought I knew the game, but never checked the score
Wrote it in my room, finding places to record
And titled it in French, black is what is was
Noir is what it became, attracted me to buzz
But uh, let me start by saying hello world
Been a long time since rocking with O girl
Dreams are bigger now, some of us sit around
My shorties getting up, my fellas getting down
They want an iller sound, so that's on me
Bringing you the happy days, minus Fonzie
I set my goals to do it, man up and go pursue it
And give your all, that's the only way you're s'posed to do it

[Hook]
Pour a good drink, rolled a couple blunts
So I took a break, only for a couple months
Never saw it comin', I only seen it once
Don't even play the games, I ain't like them other chumps
And they got me saying
Hello new chick, goodbye past jawn
And all the women in-between that I passed on
Hello new chick, goodbye pass jawn
And all the women in-between that I passed on
