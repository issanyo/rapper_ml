[Verse 1:]
Yeah uh uh yeah
I woke up to a cigarette, next to some food I ain’t finished yet
And I don’t really care about my appetite
Still im drunk so I reach and then I grab a bite
I seen the light something told me woke up to the sky crying
Had an epiphany it hit me like a nine iron
And my cologne still present on my button up
Lipstick marks on the collar from me cuttin up
Formulating nonsense, breed of the league
Had to wait it out till I found what I need
Simon says go, I tried to move but Simon said no
I’m far from it all i’m instructing while I grow
I listen to my friends when they said it was irrelevant
Had attended school for the pronouns and predicates
Even played a fool when I did it for the presidents
Had to stay ahead of it, this is my development

[Verse 2:]
Splash water on my face, wipe the cold out from my eyes
I look into the mirror my reflection is surprised I
Noticed that you cry even though I don’t approve
I look into the mirror cause I can’t believe it’s true
It’s you I tried to see myself as celebrity
Either one shot or aim for longevity
Just want to be the same person when you bury me
Most won’t even listen so I wrote it through a melody
So as I get dressed in my garment
I’m thinking how my outfit will determine who my target is
Skater boy, punk rock, mad thugs, mad drugs, mad type, mad white
This is what it sounds like, artists of appearances
No matter what the clearance is
Erick is a staple when you stating something serious
So paper chase, hold your weight when the levy breaks
I levitate, and shit I been doing this since ‘88
