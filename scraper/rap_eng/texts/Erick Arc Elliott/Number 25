[Verse: 1]
Hold up homie is this bad to begin your business with
Making music for intelligent minds and the intricate
Tried to tweak the beat they gave released indeed I sent the kit
Through a bus compressed strictly for all my production purposes
Trust me I will ride for my syndicates, only 20 minutes left on my clock
Before I got to crawl out of bed again
So please father we harbor hatred in our heart
Never had another perspective I've always repped God
This is my orbit since all this is paid before me
Just in my story, little nigga's with dreams of being Shawn Corey
But maybe not your idol, but I don't mind my eye's are fine
See through projection's of life, in pursuit of the idle mind
I pushed it to the threshold
Despite my fail attempts to make popular manifesto
What's the problem, I was only average? 2 years later now I'm zombie status
Passport is on the passage, your pussy flooded my palace (WOW)
Pussy all on my pallet, nigga's still talking challenge
I'm Erik Morales, knock your pineal off balance
Well the music or the bank (chiing), your gonna lose some interest
But from now to be frank, I only think you'll listen
If a feelings for familiar faces when you see it
All you sippin' codeine, all your cloth European
Either way I'm just losin' interest, rip your doors off the hinges
Don't need opinions, if they fake emotions like stewardess'

[Hook: x2]
Only God know's why I question my ability
Some day's I feel like I was born in 1970
If I only knew better if I wasn't programmed already
Show up late to party too late to see them fall like confetti

[Verse: 2]
Hold up homie is this stupid to be this honest?
I've rapped before the production now nigga's paying me homage
Drink 40's until I vomit, my nigga's rich read the comic
Pulled it right from the sky, that's what you do when your God
If you talk shit I reply, nigga's don't know what the fuck they got
But the boy gon' bust it, never gon' trust it
I'm never gonna touch it, if it's gon' die
Why try making a difference when individuals ain't original?
Seen you nigga's copying pasting pieces for years or 2
This ain't a miracle I sacrificed my whole life for this shit
The whole world know I'm dogging, I feel like Michael Vick
ESPN for the men of men
Women pretend to grin when they watching
The truth is I give them no option
Pardon my pockets, pardon my cocky
Partly a papi
Italian women they love a nigga driving Ferrari
Stolen julapi, golden punjavi
Don't want no molly mami
The weed inspires the eye inside of me, I be (gone)
