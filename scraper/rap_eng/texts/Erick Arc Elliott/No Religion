[Verse 1 : AK]
It's the return of the rotten apple
Through time travel, armies of indigo
Swarming, shepherd the leperd, fuck cattle
We be the beast coast pharaohs, you smell the weed smoke
That we toke, put them in sleep mode
Like a PC, og, yeah New York diesel
From the bottom to the top, right
But shit I'm on the block
Still, plotting with parting, your bitch on my cock
Not still twerking for a g
Cause I bring life to all the drinks
I think twice, there's no second life
So I take pride in what I do
A living god it’s why they kneel
For my weakness is not in heel
Go to hell, heaven, whatever
The longer you gone, the better
47 rest in never, we building this shit together
Cause one man's insanity's another man's treasure, nigga

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
Stop tryina be Jesus, try to be better
Your chakra is closed, just raise your energy level
Your weapons is flawed, from the barrel to the lever
I say oh lord, and of course a nigga get em
Stop tryna be 2Pac, try to be better
Your chakra is closed, just raise your energy level
Your weapons is flawed, from the barrel to the lever
Meech say, done em all
And of course a nigga get em

[Verse 2 : Meechy Darko]
Ain't it ironic, that the zombies runnin' the rotten apple
Haven't ran out of competition
So I battle my fucking shadow
Gave her the hard drive, she sync
My data, DNA matter, spit it on my dick
And download it after
I reached the highest levels
Eyes red like the devil
Your chakra’s is closed up
Bitch raise your energy level
They are more than a appalling oh my godly presence
Shall I mention I'm reinventing the ideology
Of what they consider social acceptance
In every fucking sentence
My tongue's a weapon, so bitch if we kiss your head it's severed
I fucked the cougar, named Dandy Lion the Def Leopard
Scratches and paw prints, all over my garments, oh shit!

[Hook: Meechy Darko]
Stop tryina be Jesus, try to be better
Your chakra is low, just raise your hand and delevel
Your weapons is flawed, from the barrel to the lever
I say oh lord, and of course a nigga get em
Stop tryina be 2Pac, try to be better
Your chakra is low, just raise your hand and delevel
Your weapons is flawed, from the barrel to the lever
Meech say, done em all
And of course a nigga get em
