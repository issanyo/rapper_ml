[Verse 1:]
I never was a fan of all the women coatin makeup
And these arguments eventually will lead up to a breakup
I smell you in the morning when you roll onto your side
Got a fly sense of energy, your motives get me high
If only I supply, to keep you satisfied
I know the truth hurts but then again id rather lie
Pushing your thoughts and not because i drive a fast car
Its cause im here forever trynna heal your last scar
Get the ointment tell me where you needin to be healed first
You know that im the best for you and you still search
So before i go all out, i wanna be the only name that you call out

[Hook:]
You could be beside the bar, but i just moved closer to be close to where you are
(Girls are from mars) (x4)
You on a space shuttle cause you wanna see the stars
So i take it from the sky and bring it right to where you are
(Girls are from mars) (x4)

[Verse 2:]
Please get a girl that can motivate your mind and your pocket
You talk and she won't change the topic
Playing all the oldschool games you wanna see
I tried to let you in knowing we could disagree, shit
Independent, elegant, dignified, intelligent
The person in this world that could knock me out my element
Is you, it ain’t about the time looking past me
Its all about the future how long can it last me
Felt like i haven’t felt, rings up on Saturn’s belt
Trynna play my hand but there’s cards that I haven’t dealt
Move along cause we all play the same song
You either play it right or shawty’s gonna play along

[Hook:]
