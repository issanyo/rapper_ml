[Hook: Sean Rose]

We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up
We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up

[Verse 1: Sean Rose]

Night of our lives, put this in the archives
Cliquot upside, pockets up sizes
Overdrive [?] the city been revived
These moments so cold I hang em on the wall
Jar hangin' from my balls
Hoopin' like Durantula
Tryna' get that mansion, huh
Doin' some expansion, huh
World famous crew
Get ya stamps up
Drink it straight
Mix it? No. Sip it slow
Champagne showers on the couches
For the years we was doubted, gimmick proof
Salute me, Rose the general
From the vital
Where they shoot you out [?]
Come to your casa for the whole enchilada
Neighbors say nada
Celebratin' 20 fold
Tonight I'm Black Mamba
Let 'em mumble
Stop the stomach grumbles
Got my mama out the jungle
Kept the sucka shit far out the huddle
Smokin' to the ones that thought I'd fumble
Toastin' to the ones that thought I'd crumble

[Hook: Sean Rose]

We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up
We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up
We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up
We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]

Yeah
We don't envy simpletons or [?]
I meant to mention that
I've never been fond of rap, I rap for free
You rap for me
I record your life then record it back
I record the track
On a MP3
And it's still my dream
I just use you
As I'm used to produce these tunes
Premature thoughts in the womb
Knowledge that you can't consume
Truth from myth, hieroglyphs
Arc is just a euphemism for a scientist
So I exist 'til i get missed
Drawn a picture, torn a scripture
Funny niggas, yeah
Came prepared
Rose up out of satan's lair
Arc has come to say a prayer
Save our souls, music woes, change of clothes
Same old flows
Everybody can't be a CEO
Some are soldiers, play your role
Never thought I'd be on a record that
Recognizes my goals
But I'm lifted my nigga, so here it goes
So high all the time, no difference even when I smoke
Teachings that a genius wrote
And I quote
"I'm not for plan"
Shorty in my ear, whisperin'
"and I got a [?]"

[Hook: Sean Rose]

We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up
We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up
We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up
We could do this all night (all night, all night)
We gon' be here 'til the sun comes up
