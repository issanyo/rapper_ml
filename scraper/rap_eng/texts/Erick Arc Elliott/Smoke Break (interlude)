[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott & Zombie Juice]
Emotional when rolling dope I ask myself why am I sober?
I slow down my eyes are closing, motor functions moving slower
Emotional when rolling dope I ask myself why am I sober?
I slow down my eyes are closing, motor functions moving slower

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
I just wanna roll my joint, I really can't take much more
I brought this whole sack with me dog
So please don't blow my high
Smoke again smoke again little weed never hurt nobody
That's a fact!
If you got discipline, listen friend
Grow your own green trees and cut the middle man
Benefits from weed may I say a symphony
Then you will receive something special in a gift
Something that you need, help you to relive sentiment
Now we rolling up again, now we rolling up again

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott & Zombie Juice]
Emotional when rolling dope I ask myself why am I sober?
I slow down my eyes are closing, motor functions moving slower
Emotional when rolling dope I ask myself why am I sober?
I slow down my eyes are closing, motor functions moving slower

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Oh oh, oh oh, I just gotta smoke one before I gotta go
She hit me on the DM I said hit me on the weekend
Hella weed, plus Hennessy man that will get us eating
Said I got the remedy, drug life dependency
Love thyself and I always did believe in me
The religious three, you could be everything
That you perceive to be
Believe it, seek it to achieve it
And blow dope if you need to see it
Sometimes I still get stressed but
I just smoke one and count my blessings
