[Hook: Jadakiss sample]
Depening on the mood I'm in, I might holla
I love seeing niggas get shot and I like dollars
Light a dutch, pour the yack, take a light swallow
It's funny because my criminology is white collar
Depening on the mood I'm in, I might holla
I love seeing niggas get shot and I like dollars
Light a dutch, pour the yack, take a light swallow
It's funny because my criminology is white collar

[Outro: Bridget Perez]
It's all a matter of perspective
