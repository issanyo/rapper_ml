(hook)
I dont wanna waste your time
I just want to know
Is we fuckin (yea,yea) is we fucking (yea,yea)
If the pussy like the wallet, can I bust it
Baby girl is we fucking (yea,yea) pop a cherry huh

[Erick Arc Elliot]
Like everybody else would
You know you gave me head because it felt good
Thats my pussy mascot
She play for the team I own
Fingers in the mouth, open blouse, pussy leaking huh
I squeeze it to make it fit
Leave it seasoned like a crip
Damn, I love my bitch
Grip ya ass like I'm palming a Spalding
If shorty ain't fucking we ain't doing the mall thing
My homies send me love
These hoes send me letters
Fornicate your daughters, moms send me sweaters
I promise to do better
Fuck you with my fingers crossed
I've been evolved, bitches lost, but im still a boss
Only god forgives
Purely positive dawg and i got manners
Eat the pussy with a bib on
Italian women my dick is drooling and jewelin'
Once you put your back into it
There's no sense in maneuvering

[ZOMBIE juice]
True blues size 5
Leopard panties, chest out, my god
I didn't know it was this real
Roll the weed up while she give my dick feels
See, I'm as nasty as I wanna be
Lick the pussy, kiss it after, you feel me
Put the piston on the mouth, watch it choke
Put the blunt in the pussy, watch it smoke
Grab her hair, smack her ass, no ropes
Tear it up, back it on me, no joke
Its no facade, I'Mm feeling the pussy ho
Fuck her to the grave, i'M graving the booty yo
? d cup tits and videos
Juicy go hard ain't nothing you ain't know
And if your mind's out of sync
Then I got her on the strip, ass out in the mink
No lips ? , pimp harder
What goes around comes around, named a Karma
Not all vampires want blood, I want your soul
Fuck love

[hook]

[Meech]
I love to fuck her
Never fucking loved her
She clever like a fox
So Meech don't really trust her
Crazy bitch, would probably cut a nigga's rubber
She don't eat the swine, but she hog the covers
See we both in it for lust
We don't love each other
But yet we both in it to fuck
So we fuck each other
Gave her a pearl necklace, ain't that bling
Long strokes, then I pull out
Make that pussy break wind
Speaking of the pearls, ?
Got her her hair in curls, her body blood murder
You brought with you the ocean, so I guess that we at sea yo
Good stroking leave the pussy steaming like a steamboat
