[Verse 1: Jawz]
It's the black rapping class act who came to class
With mad snaps, claps, and beat-making Macs to rack faster
And mack chics well above average
It's magic how he spit sicker than cancer-having cat kids
And still remain sharper than a cactus
No question if he's blessed, the psychic said I'll be mad rich
So if I'm caught stealing just put it on my tab miss
Or tag me--I don't care I'm busy killing this rap biz
Killing with no promo
Beyonce shit, B
I stay inside my zone though
Zone comma Cudi
Make sure you did your googles before you try to stump me
Cause I've been crumping and Donald Trumping since I could fucking breathe
So uh, pip pip cheerio
Make sure you got some money 'fore you blast this through your stereo
Cause melting is an option though I'm chilling flawless
Know if X is still evolving you don't want a fucking problem
"So Jawz, if you ain't rich what you spitting in the booth?"
The same thing missing from Maury niggas: The truth
I took one too many shots from the fountain of youth
And I'm immortal so for eva eva is real Im proof
And you can call me a maniac I'm okay with that
But don't be surprised when Jason's chainsaw is in your back
And Satans' babies chasing you trynna get their property back
And your oprhan kids will have to live through the aftermath
I got a little bit crazy
I was listening to Goblin and it made me 'napp Jay-Z
He was on a movie set conversing with P. Swayze
But after I took some Henney my memory's all hazy
I'm lazy, but never think you'll ever catch me slippin'
The last battler had his mind fucked, raped him and dipped then
Back to the studio for swag boy funerals
Harsh, but if you're planning to visit you should know
I'll have em all getting worried when I start getting bigger
I got so much shit on my mind but nobody will listen
I've been lied to too many times, I don't believe you haters
Bow down to your saviours: Jawz Almighty and Xavier
This is dopeness you're consuming the substance
And do another line if these lines had you were wondering
The way I got hyped makes you think I smoke crack or sumn'
But I just snort hella potassium
Jawz

[Hook: Flatbush Zombies]
My team, supreme, stay clean
Lyrical dreams, zombie regime, we be that
We at where the weed and LSD at
On since I was born, no such thing as relapse (x2)
