[Intro: Zombie Juice]
(Signature Laugh)

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]
Hit me up and we can chill
Kiss your mouth and smack your rear
Know I do it how you like
I don't miss when I'm in bad
Know I'm trippy, so it's insignificant to play a nigga like he wise
You know she wanna blow a guy
You know I'm when off the ride
Hit me up and we can chill
Kiss your mouth and smack your rear
Know I do it how you like
I don't miss when I'm in bad
Know I'm trippy, so it's insignificant to play a nigga like he wise
You know she wanna blow a guy
You know I'm when off the ride

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Hey
She my girl, I know I treat it bad
I don't know what she can see me as
To the world, I been a genius
At the sun-up, run-up, need the cash
Hit the pussy, like a Sweetener bag
If I get her, I don't need to brag
How I'm living, I don't need forgivin', shit is different sense, I think I need your ass
She know I'm out here, tryna win, splittin' everything, let's get these dividends
Know I holler when the business end, but your main girl, she a chicken-head
She can argue with the best of 'em
Coochie dirty from the festival
Come on over, lemme hit it, but I gotta fit you inside a long schedule (Word!)

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]
Hit me up and we can chill
Kiss your mouth and smack your rear
Know I do it how you like
I don't miss when I'm in bad
Know I'm trippy, so it's insignificant to play a nigga like he wise
You know she wanna blow a guy
You know I'm good when off the ride
Hit me up and we can chill
Kiss your mouth and smack your rear
Know I do it how you like
I don't miss when I'm in bad
Know I'm trippy, so it's insignificant to play a nigga like he wise
You know she wanna blow a guy
You know I'm good when off the ride

[Bridge: Meechy Darko]
She just want the nightlife (whoa)
She just ride my - (whoa)
Take a look at my ice (whoa)
So ahead of my time (whoa)

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
She just want the latest (you know)
She just want the latest (you know)
She said that I drive her crazy
So she mimic that voodoo
She said that they can control her, they could do shit she don't usu-
I told her "c'mon, stop it baby, this a real nigga, this ain't what you used to" (ahhh)

[Verse 3: Zombie Juice]
Grow is cut, that's the freight grow
Been a boss, counting pesos
Ima get it if I say so
Niggas snitchin' on your payroll
Fuck her when? I never say no
Most these bitches ain't faithful
Most these niggas, they hateful
Gotta watch your back for them snakes, though
Been a menace, yeah I'm black and proud
Terp talk, got the loud in town
She wanna fuck me, wanna blow it down
One night only, girl I'm just around
What they talkin' bout, I ain't impressed with
Niggas talking like I ain't the president
Now she winnin', fuckin' with a boss
Man, I closed the game like Kobe in the fourth, man

You know she wanna blow a guy
You know I'm good when off the ride
