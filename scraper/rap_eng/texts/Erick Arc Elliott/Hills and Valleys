[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
Picasso to the pen it take time to craft a masterpiece
Overheard my shows, my soul die beside my last release
Nigga, I juggle foot while on this mattress
And never was your fabric only bust it for the practice
When you hear me aggravated that was just my minds doing
This my real life and I just wrote my rhymes to it
Theres no brovado, shorty ride it like a slalom
The white'll hit your nose as long as hoes are right beside him
So I'll just kill the bottle, and every girls a model
We all indulge in sin and still we referencing the bible
They wanna see me swag, and I stay up on my grizz
And it only felt like yesterday that we were only kids
And I read the alchemist when I took my journey to a fantasy
When I'm looking to the future, and the rumours want to slander me
I mack it like I'm goldie, Flashin' like a rollie
I know there's sweet potential but I'm doubted by my homies
We just pray for god, reassure we could until we rest our eyelids
But we stay in silence when you speak on revolution
Got a shorty up on the ave that hike her skirt up if you word it right
Murder to the virgin, Methods cooked up like its merlin
Use my magic wana blunt -- several servants
Represent to full soldier soviet
Rappers watered down like the liquor when the soda mix
Searching through my music they don't know who Flying Lotus is
Feeling like a doctor when they ask what kind of growth is this?
Manifested good, my intention was to be the best
Even if it took forever and I took a million steps
Cause I'm talking to whomever will take no offence
I take a shot of something good to keep my soul cleansed, I never flinch
I hope my paper spend, we could all just play pretend
While I'm looking through these aviator lense

[Verse 2:Erick Arc Elliot]
The glass shovel tried to hit me like some brass knuckles
And fast levels tried to drink away my past trebles
Sometimes I feel it all, sometimes I feel in awe, sometimes I feel I have nobody to feel at all
And not a guilty soul, don't bother pity me
But this a long shot, just like the kennedies
The sniper scope the hype is so not him
They told me to be Eric B. , but I'm no Rakim
Find Divine in your own time, I seen the world from the eyes of a gold mine
I often question why'd you make my mother go blind, I Hail Salassie tried to reconnect his soul with mine
And I'll be lying if I never said I can't
My ego still regal tell that nigga grow a pair (pussy)
I swear I been american but where is it embarrassing / the marriages and heritage / avoiding all the various questions they got me burying like
Who is our leader? Who will not deceive us? You all scum thats why I drink this fucking 40 litre, and I steam the reefer, 4 gs to keep up
Women by my side just for when the liquor creep up
Original never, I just steal from the best, to try to make me better
My conscious is a killa so I wear it like a sweater
My aim is like Beretta (BOM) Shooting for the stars, trekking hard, looping odd Oh my God / Swore I'm not a rarity
Heard they heard my beats now these niggas really scared of me
Shorty cakes sera lease, spoon feed asperalie
Money made her wet, knowledge made her more aware of me, my therapy
