[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Uh, so smooth with it
Twist it up, and then let you hit it
Don't give it back, unless you don't know what to do with it
But I Reggin' shawty hella fine
No problem hitting from the bowl
Shawty I can do this all the time
It's the chron' that illustrates your mind
Rearrange your thoughts and pull the spirits from the blind
You're nearly choked up, and im like so what
Your legs are feeling funny, cuz you're really smoked up
I feel I needa', smoke it to a'seize'ya
So I told Girly, calm down take a breather
This is really high grade
Sort of reminiscing of this movie I played
Last night, that's right. Ask white girls how I make them lights blur?
The only herb that'll turn your bitch into a spice girl
Don't come back, cuz I done seen you at your worst
Now I'm starring at her like I should have hit it first
It's the weed fronter

[Hook]
Weed fronter, Uh nobody else budding me under
(Weed Fronter!)
(Smoking all my weed, now you tryna throw me a dollar?)
(It's not cool, ooooh)
(C'mon have some fucking courtesy)

I said my girlfriend Maggie is the same
Never bring the Bob by, never wanna hang man
I don't know
She's a weed fronter

And she said it was a lie
Fronted off the top
Knowing now she doesn't smoke this good high Dro
She's a weeed frontaah

A weed fronter
A a weed fronter
Thats what she is
(A weed fronter!)

Yo a weed fronter
Yo a weed fronter
Thats what you are
(A weed Fronter!)

[Outro - Speaking]

Yo, I hate you dirty weed fronters
You know, you never smoked before
(You never smoked before)
Your eyes are all dilated like a sewer rat
Pink and shit..
"Oh I thought you smoked tho?"
Frontin, really frontin and shit
