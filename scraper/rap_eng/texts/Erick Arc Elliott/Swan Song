[Verse 1: Espa]
I dream of a sun up above (up above, up above)
Ripening rays really love (really love, really love)
Soothing the mess in my heart
(La la la la la la)
Oh, I
I still get cold in the night
Desperate, alone, hear me cry
Singing this strange lullaby

[Chorus: Espa]
The days get short
And the nights grow long
You stop to count the ways
You've got it all wrong
What will make you smile?
At the finish line
Is all that will remain

[Verse 2: Giggs]
We couldn't meet, she couldn't sleep
Never made a promise that I couldn't keep
Told her I'll address it and we wouldn't speak
And when she's undressing, said I wouldn't peep
Money on the dresser, gonna hit the streets
Told her grab a dress and then she got the deets
Told her when she copped 'em "hope you got receipts"
Nigga, call me doctor cause I got the beats
Phone ringing, I watch it beep
Watch my Instagram and wanna watch me tweet
I'm watching Vince McMahon, she said she wants the key
I told her "please, sit down", she said she wants to see
Always on some bossy, baby, what's your beef?
You're always with your posse, baby, what's achieved?
Then I sip Courvoisi, then I got the sheets
That zoobie got me coughing and she wants to beat
I can't lie, we've got different hopes
Can't lie, we've got different strokes
From outside of my BMX
You're outside on your skipping ropes
I won't laugh, we've got different jokes
She (cough, cough) till she sick of smoke
She always with that sick approach
That's alright 'cause I'm with it though

[Chorus: Espa]
The days get short
And the nights grow long
You stop to count the ways
You've got it all wrong
What will make you smile?
At the finish line
Is all that will remain
