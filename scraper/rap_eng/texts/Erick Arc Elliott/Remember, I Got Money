[Intro]
Set it off set it off, homie

Bitches they be on my dick
Bitches they be on my dick
They be on my dick hella hard, cuhz
Yeah

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
Catch me cloud hoppin', surfin' in the sky
Rollin' through your hood, while kush is in my eyes
Why you act surprised, you ain't ever seen a nigga?
I'm culture roller coaster, smokin' doja reefer, nigga
Don't you worry 'bout it, you just bring it in
Let me get inside, bring it in
So while I'm in it, I just beat it up too
My friends will tell you different, honey, but I'm no good
Heavy bangin' on these hoes so much ice that time froze
X and O, tic-tac-toe, get you right up out them clothes
Urkel glasses, purple passion twistin' up haze amazing
Leavin' flavors of raisins oh my god your amazing, damn
This is what I gotta do, 44 up and it's aimed at you
Stop your cryin' bitch I just had some things to do
Long point shot like I'm Reggie Miller
But I am a killa, her name priscilla, cobain gorilla
No game is realer
If you wanna act right, nigga get familiar

Say I'm real, I be doing things
And I'm rolling through the hood, chunking deuces when I swang
Ladies say I hurt they heart, ho they fucking lying B
I do my thang on 'em, don't fucking lie to me, remember
Lie to me, remember, 'member
I got money, 'member
I got money, money
Don't you remember? Yeah
Said I got money
