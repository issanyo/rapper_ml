[Stacey monologuing]
I feel amazing, my dress is here, it fits perfect
Uh, I don't know
My mom is here, my dad is here, my whole family is here
A lot of people traveling, there you go, there are my friends
I'm just excited, I can't wait, I can't wait, this is my day
It's all about me, I look perfect, my makeup looks amazing
I know, I know

[Bobby and Erick conversating]
- Damn man, you were supposed to be here hours ago
Stacey's mom has got it going on, you should write that down
But she's been tearing my ass up all afternoon, I know that's not what's crazy, but come on
- I don't know what happened, maybe you shouldn't have given me all them drinks. It's kinda-It's kinda your fault
One moment I'm in the club, the next thing you know
I'm home in my drawers
And on top of that your homie Bugga was, nevermind
- Hey look, don't worry about it. Just keep playing as good as you just did, and everything should be fine
- Okay. I know I just got here and everything and I'm not in any position to make comments really, but you've had this little white buildup on the side of your mouth this whole time and, I hope you didn't take no pictures like that
- Aw, aw hell no
- Yeah handle that, b

[Bugga (A$AP Twelvyy) and Erick conversating]
- Hey yo Derrick!
- Who?
- Yo Derrick! Yo, pull up, yo. What's your name again?
- Erick, man, what's up?
- Oh yeah, Erick Erick Erick, look, how you feelin' man?
- I'm alright
- You go hard last, I see you with that little stripper, man, she got you, she got you, for with that little check now
- Damn, why you bring that up?
- It was crazy! We should talk about Stacey
- Shhhhh! Be quiet, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?

[Narration (Erick Arc Elliott)]
Clearly Erick doesn't recall anything about the conversation with the best man Bugga. It seems that he's under the impression that they are best friends now
"Damn, what he say? What happen last night?"
