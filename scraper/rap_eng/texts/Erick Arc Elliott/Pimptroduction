All I wanna do is live free, have fun
All I wanna do is be me and get by

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
I welcome all of y'all to a newer me
And a lot has changed homie, I hope that you'd agree
And I don't have the cars, the money, or the jewelry
It's hard to telephone, this liquor's been consuming me
It's only cigarettes, Feelings of regret
Knowing all the things I love are only momentary steps
It's hard to feel I'm blessed, I just said I'm doing me
Niggas think I'm going nuts, Ladies think they're screwing me
I'm probably the only one ever bringing you new shit, useless
It won't do shit, You still confuse it
With artistry and clowns, I just lay it down
Disregard the bar's closing, just ordered another round
And she's down, They say I'm so smart, up on the honor roll
They're saying Erick won't snap, he's got a lot of soul
But fuck the soul shit, I'm so sick
Got me soul searching for my soul chick
Shorty's home, her light's on, Where them summer nights gone?
Runs a blog of photos that uploaded off a Nikon
Sorry there's array everyday I'm just getting by
Pain and bizarre speech, and occasionally getting high
Most'll just say you know, Erick please explain why
So instead of saying you'll do it, just say that you gonna try
So if I rock a show and approaching the stage high
Touch the bodies that don't puff it, but feeling the same vibe
I twist something awful, the ? is sitting there
Wrestling these tycoons, Four fingers, Ricky Flair
So debonair, Scribble in my notepad
Hit 'em with the vocab then nibble on these Gonads

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliot]
A name brand never was my reason or my calling
Able to be fly, Why? Wasn't afraid of falling
Five of your Milans picking dirt up from my nails
When I almost quit piano cause I couldn't learn the scales
Often on some other shit, distribution, publishing
Flourishing until this game granted me a Mulligan
They're claiming that they're showing favor to a better god
I struggle hard to pay the balance of my credit card
Imagine if I didn't win your hearts the first time
I would inquire, but I ask them at the worst time
And through it all, I gave it all, 'til my last penny
Staying home ain't cost much but I didn't have any
I'm staring at the ceiling flipping through this magazine
And rappers fade like the fabric of my ?
And bank tellers won't listen to my sob story
That's why I keep my friends close that'll ride for me
