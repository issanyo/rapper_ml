[Hook: Nuri Hazzard]
Baby, why that thang so fat?
I'm just tryna lay on that
Make me wanna spank on that
Baby, what you think 'bout that?
Baby why that thang so fat?
Imma spend a bank on that
I'm say my grace on that
Baby what you think bout that?

[Verse 1: CGB]
Most of these bad bitches basic
Normally they could have patience
But now i could fuck that girl even if she a angel
Make her switch it up on the cam with the angles
She call me daddy, she begs me to strangle
I like to tease her, leaving her to just dangle
Walkin' out her spot with a grin like I'm evil
Come back tomorrow, fuck her, damn I'm a hero
Fuck all you zeros, y'all don't know shit
Y'all dunno how to give a real woman dick
Y'all like em skinny well, I like em thick
Light skin, Puerto Rican, or a white bitch
Also like em Asian, Persian or rich
That way I ain't gotta spend shit
That's more to spend on tree
So me and my homie Nuri get lit, and we lit

[Verse 2: Nuri Hazzard]
Baby bring it here, I’m really ‘bout to take it there
Really rare, you lookin’ at the player of the year
You a breath of fresh air to the atmosphere
Booty serious, how you drop it make me drop a tear
Your intellect illuminating like a chandelier
I’m dead fresh like a garden, need a boutonniere
Adam, Eve, out Eden that's like me and you
We can vibe, multiply, keep it fruitful
You're irrefutably beautiful to the cuticle
Gimme time baby, I don't need an interval
Kill it with no questions
So there ain't no need to interview
Do not ask the question, girl
You know that I am in the mood
No need for flexing, you know that I am into you
Throw it my way, girl you know what I’m finna do
Middle of the party, take to her to the back
Break her back, come right back
Man I call that shit an interlude, damn

[Bridge: Justo]
Tell me that you’re with the move
I need some time, just me and you
I need to see exclusive views
Make a masterpiece, cause you my muse

[Refrain: CGB]
She love how a young dude do it
She love how a young dude do it
She love how a young dude do it
I’m a little too smooth for my own good

[Outro]
