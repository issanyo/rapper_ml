[Verse 1]
They say you can't live for the moment
And you can't trust the niggas that you roll with
So my days consist of a strip club
Make it rain a sick flood, I just love
Managers saying that Arc is a risk
He's a rebel, he's known to tear it apart if it exists
[?] my thoughts is all black
Bothered by fake gimmicks and niggas that can't rap, man
Feeling good now, so I toast to it
You can't tell me that you're mad, cause I goes through it
And I wrote to it, then I'mma smoke to it
Nothing comes close to it
(Chill E, don't do it)
I mean imagine that, this is all me
And there's never been enough of you for me to ever see, man
And I bleed through my soul when I let it go
When I steam through the shape of a letter O
So you bet it's so, shorty waiting at the door
All my friends say I'm hard work and no metaphor
Work better with no sleep, to understand
How I plan, here I am, with pen in hand
Loose change, pulling pockets of lint
Reminiscing what I jot when I vent
Have you not been convinced?
I'm on top, you underneath, you under that
It is a rap, well listen Jack, just run it back

[Hook]
Things can't be the same since I left you
Cause I do it for my moms and my nephew
I gotta get to, I gotta get to
You gotta get an open life if it lets you
I got away from the shade, this is how I bathe
This is how I'm living my life every day
Can't do no better, can't do no better

[Verse 2]
Malia's on, tricks, women that you never see
An entourage, a m√©nage, and a melody
Can't cut it, Arc is like a diamond to 'em
So I treat 'em like my sons when I'm rhyming to 'em
Lay low, payroll when I can
Press the mixtape, still courtesy of Ant
Two years, and my mom cries two tears
One for her son, and one for my kid (not yet)
Drops when the day rocks, JanSport backpack
Match that through the Dow Jones and the NASDAQ
I'm an investment, make sure you know me
Shouts all, they know Erick is my co-de
Some call me something else, I feel their vibe too
They say I'm unique, and I fly
Too many, and it's so petty
You say I'm so broke but I know you got plenty
Run the same game, all these chess boards
Being broke is a struggle, but it just made me invest more
Hit 'em with a ditty-bop or the pimp lean
Make sure they're still salvaging the NC
This food for thought, but kill swims
No use in playing the game you can't win
Friends, the odd ones, plus family and enemies
Essentially you just clowns who pretend to be
