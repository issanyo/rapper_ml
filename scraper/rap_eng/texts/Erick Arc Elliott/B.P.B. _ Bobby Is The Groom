[Intro: A$AP Twelvyy]
She do it for the cash
She do it for the cash
She wanna shake her back
She better shake that ass
Brown paper bag
She do it for the cash
She wanna make it last
You better shake that ass
Brown paper bag
She do it for the cash
She wanna make it last
She better shake that ass
Now grab a paper bag

[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
I know some down bitches
That go down on bitches
I mean, her head delicious
I mean, her pussy vicious
Might have to make some wishes
Really walk the walk 'til I'm out of chalk
Burn bitches' ball
I ain't tryna start
Kings County, baby
Don't want to save me
'Til I'm dead and gone
Just lessons learned
Don't pull the trigger
If you can't take the burn
Puff, puff, pass
Get your own grass
Make a [?] bitch and put ya own ass
Might take a dab
Then I break a back
Countin' pesos
I'm a A$AP
[?] low, where's the weed though
Put the ball to my own and my free throws
She took 'em out
Now she back it in
'Til I'm finished, dog
Got the money shot
Need a pussy hot
'Bout to make a drop
Twelvyy says every 30 on the dot, dot, dot...

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
What you gon' be?
Many walk this Earth, I chose to be a Zombie
Always learn from the greats and the ones before me
Then shit turned to shreds when I lost my homie
Nothing comes free, they say ya motherfucker militant
They break out bounties so a nigga gon' kill again
Make your move
Pick and choose
What you got to prove?
Independent, I concile my own commas too
You so small in this scale, I do not acknowledge you
Blowing dope in your face, chronic leaves my fire too
But, I am all in
Cross a couple [?] you probably can't match my wisdom
[?] for dinner

[Verse 3: A$AP Twelvyy]
This ain't for beginners
Or it's in November
Stackin' up my statline
Looking like a center
Pussy and placenta
Mix it with some ginger
Taste it with some jack
I ain't never gon' remember
Ballin' like I'm Kemba
Flying like I'm [?]
Hotter than an ember
I'd probably fuck Amber
Probably fuck Amber
Probably be a happy fucking camper
I'd probably be Debbie and fuck day to day

[Outro: A$AP Twelvyy]
She do it for the cash
She do it for the cash
She wanna shake her back
She better shake that ass
Brown paper bag
She do it for the cash
She wanna make it last
You better shake that ass
Brown paper bag
She do it for the cash
She wanna make it last
She better shake that ass
Now grab a paper bag
