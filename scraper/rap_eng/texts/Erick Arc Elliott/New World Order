[Intro]
New world order
New world order
New world order
New world order

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
All the homies say I'm brain dead
Amen, smoke weed, talk shit
All these rappers be on pain meds
So why should I give a fuck how they feel?
Heard you don't even gang bang
But you're twistin' up the fingers in the flicks
Know you gotta have the good aim
When you're shootin' from the whip
New world order, baby baby
Please work smarter instead of harder
That new world order, the world is mine
So why the fuck would I give you a portion?
New world order, no calm shit
Revolvin', bust guns that start riots
Booty so round and soft, I left a palm print
I'm Schwarzenegger, black leather, shotty under armpit

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott and Meechy Darko]
New world order (New world order)
Everything kosher 'til a nigga call the squad up
New world order (New world order)
Let me see you snitchin' best pretend that you saw nothin'
New world order (New world order)
Everything kosher 'til a nigga call the squad up
New world order (New world order)
Rebel with no cause, homie welcome to the slaughter

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Ain't no rivalry, ain't no hide and seek
Bang bang, rather you than me
Another rapper, just a bunch of chatter
Come ride my wave 'til the boat sink
My lifestyle gets unusual
We Terp talk, you know the usual
It's in my blood, it's in my heart
You niggas out here dressin' like some thots
I'm really out here eatin' with some Rastas
Your baby girl slurp me like some pasta
Hotel looking like a trap house
The tour bus looking like a frat house
I like the way she walkin' with her ass out
She couldn't get me on the phone so she mad now
Call up AK, nigga, bring the bands out
It's a new world order, we the gang now

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott and Meechy Darko]
New world order (New world order)
Everything kosher 'til a nigga call the squad up
New world order (New world order)
Let me see you snitchin' best pretend that you saw nothin'
New world order (New world order)
Everything kosher 'til a nigga call the squad up
New world order (New world order)
Rebel with no cause, homie welcome to the slaughter

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
You know we make history
Burn you like hickory, niggas ain't shit to me
I bench you offend you, it's mental, I bend you
Shit is so raw, you can't read it on your Kindle
Strictly on the mental, slice face, ginsu
On some Heath Ledger shit, smash face, pencil
Copying my stencil, soaking up the swag that I exude
So excuse, this my next move
All the best do their own stunts
I'm going harder on these cold fronts
Roll blunts, kickin' back where the crows hunt
Most stunts see the vapor when I smoke one
Head up in the clouds, never seen my nose run
Don't front, not a nigga you could post on
Something for that ass, and a glass you can toast on
Boy, he got the scope on and he raisin' both arms
Can't keep it concealed, know he gotta show gun

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott and Meechy Darko]
New world order (New world order)
Everything kosher 'til a nigga call the squad up
New world order (New world order)
Let me see you snitchin' best pretend that you saw nothin'
New world order (New world order)
Everything kosher 'til a nigga call the squad up
New world order (New world order)
Rebel with no cause, homie welcome to the slaughter

[Outro]
New world order
New world order
New world order
New world order
