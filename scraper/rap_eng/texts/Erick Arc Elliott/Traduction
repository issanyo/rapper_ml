[Verse 1]
Ridin' through the ghetto, kept loot up in the shoebox
Heavy bass metal blew the speaker of my boombox
In this new era, everybody's getting shell
But it's probably cause nobody want's to try to be themself
So i be it up to the fullest, death is in the bullet
And this poetry and skill works, stress and im still hurt
Damn, bill's coming fast but i pay 'em all
I let this check write itself, but it lay noir
With no job and a girl, i gotta fend four
Im like a cop, and my partner is 10-4
That's way high, but i never say goodbye, to her
I may lie, but i never told a lie to her
It seem's often, i think about she
But i never really had the time to think about, me

[Verse 2]
Reasure to come harder than before
And all this fast money, make's it harder to ignore
Got a fantasy ahead of me instead of being broke
Uses rap as a platform, bungy and a rope
Skydiving the smoke, marijuana green
Kush turns my eye red, i'll walk you through a dream
Jaw flat, but girl's still talking that nonsense
Doedorant is caked up under my armpit's
Supposed to be a dream, nothing seem to changed
The liquor in my system make's it harder to explain

[Verse 3]
Got alot up in my brain, no prank
Before I'm overseas, but they use the same slang
Driving the same cars, rocked the same clothes
Smoked the same weed, bust the same hoes
For the record i suppose i could get up at the grind
Record a hundred song's, leak 'em at the same time
I could a funny feeling this could start something greath
I know you're really anxious, but i pardon for the wait
Excuse me for that
