[Intro]

Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]

We're starting to get closer
I don't think that's a problem
No, no
Me and my man were dining
Then it led to undressing
I got real into it
Guess who's name came to me?
Noâ€¦

[Chorus]

I almost said your name

[Verse 2]

I'll deny it to this day
I won't admit what he can't prove
No, no
I got a little tongue tied
Well I guess then you did too
I'll give you your credentials
You just know what to do
No...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Eliott]

Cause I'm feeling kinda stuck
That nigga don't get as high as us
Times get tough
Make your mind up
Listen here
I could disappear
And so long to the missing years
I miss the real not the fake
And only good men and good women could relate
I never switch places
I don't have patience for all the bullshit
Fuck all ya cool shit girl
I don't give a damn who you choosing girl
Make a nigga wanna go and lose this girl
What the fuck am I to do
This has changed how I view you
When I see you naked
I can't take my eyes off you so
I gotta do something to throttle you
Like pile driving you
It'd be my honor to if
I could respond with a kiss
I take my time with my shit
But you be with
This wack ass nigga
If he's in the vicinity I won't dap that nigga
So next time you wanna cut you better ask that nigga

[Bridge]

We both know
We both know where you'll be tonight
All that shit you talkin'
All that shit you talkin'
All that shit you talkin'

Oh

We both know
We both know where you'll be tonight
Tonight

Oh

All that shit you talkin'
All that shit you talkin'
All that shit you talkin'
Where you'll be
All that shit you talkin'
All that shit you talkin'
All that shit you talkin'
