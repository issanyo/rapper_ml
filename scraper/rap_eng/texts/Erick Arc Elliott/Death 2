[Intro - Charles Manson]
"Maybe I should have killed four-five hundred people, then I would've felt better. Then I would've felt like I really offered society something. You know, if I wanted to kill somebody, I'd take this book and beat you to death with it, and I wouldn't feel a thing. It'd be just like walking to the drug store."

[Meechy Darko]
I crack your fucking skull and use it as a bowl for cereal
I'm so serial, Ted Bundy give me money
Son of Sam, gun in hand, Jeffrey Dahmer with two llamas
In a tinted Astro van looking for a whatch'macallit
Too much pride, to beg your pardon, so it's slaughter when I'm on ya
Ginsu soldier, let me see your guts and glory
We shall possess your soul and make you off your mother like Menendez Brothers
I am wicked like no other, fuck you want
Zodiac killer, Libras in the trunk
Smelling like a dozen skunks
Cement their toes before I dunk them in the Hudson
Shatter jaws and break their teeth so forensics can't see nothin'
Laugh as I flee the scene, and make it 500 feet
Police pull over to me
Asked if that blood on my shirt
Said nah, it's a pizza stain
He laughed, gave me a ticket
Said nigga, don't speed again
But he wasn't black so you know I had to aim and bang, bang, bang
