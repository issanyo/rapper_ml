*Voicemail being played to Erick from Bobby*
Yo I'm on the phone!
Uhh, Hey Erick
My name is Bobby, I'm getting married to my girl Stacey in
A few days, and she wants to hire some wack-ass DJ
Trying to tell her she needs to hire someone with experience
I mean, I'm really nervous, and if I know if you play some
Smooth shit, I'll be able to marry her with no problem
It'll be an honor to have you here with my family and friends
Please call me back, peace

*Voicemail ends*
*Erick dials Bobby's number on a rotary dial phone*

Ok, so should he "A: Stay home, get rejuvenated for the wedding" or "B: Sign up with some bullshit with these fools"?
