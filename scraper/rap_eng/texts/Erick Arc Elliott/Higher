[Intro]
This is what I envision when I'm high (4x)

[Verse 1]
I come through jiggy as ever in a hooded sweater
Blue de Chanel-scented
Chiefing buddha that smell like cheddar, psychosis cheese
Spending pounds on British homegrown, we living better
Smooth as the Toth's turban, out here swerving Benzes
Beamers, Testarossas, whatever my preference is at the moment
Extensive vacays out to private get-aways
I'm Johnny Quest with melanin
Some Bapes and a letterman
World traveler, these niggas can't see me
20/20, I'm probably lounging in another country
Race Affan on the autobahn for 12 rubies and a oz
Just cause I can smell the victory
That's how I'm envisioning mine
Intertwined in the sheets with a dime
Sexy as Ertha Kitt in her prime
Rolling up while I'm yawning
My life like Bordeaux, getting better with time
You feel me

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliot]
We blowing trees overseas
Enjoying this cool breeze
Top down on the V
(This is what I envision when I'm high)
Roll another one for me
Just finished this QP
Keep smoking with me
(This is what I envision when I'm high)
I'm on the call
Make deposit, withdraw
All for the love of the all
(This is what I envision when I'm high)
In disguise, you only see my demise
Trying to find some peace of mind shorty
(This is what I envision when I'm high)

[Verse 2]
My gears right, my bucket is low, dertbag feelin' incredible
Ut here spittin gems just to gather up the revenue
Til I'm laughin' to the bank like Lupin the Third, that's my word
Spend a weekend out in Monaco, on a jet ski, racing muhfuckers like jet moto
Or speeding in my '99, 325i, wrapped in black on black Bape camo, flyin by in disguise
Call Lorraine up for a chain, full of sapphires bluer than the waters, in the French Riviera
My paper longer, cause my visions clearer
Lets make a toast to the most successful player of the year, that be me
Come back home just to build a mansion out in Manhasset
In a forest guarded by a Gundum
Word to Trowa Barton
I'm not one of the illest?, I beg your pardon
Give me a few... my name gon be on that marquee out front the Garden

[Hook]
