[Intro]
A little hash in my weed
A little more more for me
I'm rolling up another tree
(I'm still smoking weed)
And do I, and do I, and do I
(But...)
Everything everything you need
Singles on repeat
I didn't know I would grow to be everything you need
(One time...)
So absurd (So absurd)
Nigga I swerve on that
I get the word (What's the word)
So put the curb on that
I been here alone, I planned on my feet
I damage your speech, when I be above and you be beneath
I rather complete, Im smoking a tree
Go to desease, so helluva steez
Praying on your knees, die on your feet
I can't believe, this is relief
I can't rely on your leaf
[?] won't comply with police
Only a coward will die you make peace

[Hook]
One is for the money
Two is for the shows
Three is for the bitches
And four be for my foes
One is for the money
Two is for the shows
If three is for my bitches
The four be for my foes

[Verse 1]
Always been a victim cause I'm quicker with the (unaware)
Slap the snooze -button like a sticker on a (derriere)
[?] shut my eyes like [?]
Torn pictures of she scattered on my apartment
So that shit looks like my carpet
Despite they always say you always finish what you start with
Now I'm not the type to change your life
I gave you advice I gave you the dice to roll
You play the game, you take the train
You prefer my bicycle
[?]
The true slug,the true thugs only rise in heaven
So if the best moments only last a second
A 1-1 since the time my nigga turned eleven
Perhaps my ladies know, what ever made me so
Callus aside And I'm not talking about baby toe
I'd rather fill the rhythm on the world, instrumental
Instead I got these problems when my girl going mental
It go

[Hook]
One for the money
Two is for the shows
If three is for the bitches
The four be for my foes
One is for the money
Two is for the shows
If three is for the bitches
The four be for my foes

[Verse 2]
Oh, man I told my mans I never can
She's from Mali, her friends from Sudan
She don't pop molly but she could drink the gin
Sunset boardwalk, I'm interested in
What's between the knees
I taste the weed resin from the bottom lip
When I got the kiss, now I gotta dip
Not another phone call
Got another [?]
My ex women stress me like a test
From the clinic when you're in it
I'm protected
Better wrap it up for the long seductry
(Blaster)
Never going there but I have to
Just another chapter in a mind of a bachelor
I hug her so she knows I love her
Strangers but we fucking like we know each other
So let's perceive what the next shit
My additude is f it
[?]
It goes

[Hook]
One for the money
Two is for the shows
If three is for the bitches
The four be for my foes
One is for the money
Two is for the shows
If three is for the bitches
The four be for my foes

[Outro]
So absurd (So absurd)
Nigga I swerve on that
I get the word (What's the word)
So put the curb on that
I been here alone, I planned on my feet
I damage your speech, when I be above and you be beneath
I rather complete, Im smoking a tree
Go to disease, so helluva steez
Praying on your knees, die on your feet
I can't believe, this is relief
I can't rely on your leaf
[?] won't comply with police
Only a coward will die you make peace
