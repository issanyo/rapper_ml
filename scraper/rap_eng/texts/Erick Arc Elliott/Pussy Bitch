Verse 1: (Xavier)
Eatin’ your ass like a fat kid eatin’ cake
If you don’t let me clap, then bitch that’s your mistake
When I fuck your bitch i’m automatic like a robot
You know i’m on rock hard, like cobalt
Gettin all this money like i’m movin’ n’ shakin’
If your ass was a country then that shit would be Hatian
When i’m gettin’ it in, no I ain’t afraid of poop
I’ll still hit a nigga, from the back like John Wilkes Booth nigga

Bridge: (John Conti)
YO WE AT MCDONALDS AND THIS NIGGA BOUT TO MOON THE DRIVE THRU

Verse 2: (Ryan)
Chillin’ all day, no such thing as a vacation
Bringin’ bitches over, eating ass, relaxation
My anus cleaning skills, yeah they all stay on fleek
Favorite restaurant is asshole, lemme get up in them cheeks (Hoe!)
To love the taste of butthole, yeah you don’t know what i’ve been through
Only eat chocolate icecream, it reminds me of some poo-poo
See that invite on your lockscreen you know you had to swipe
Now we at the cribbo, pray to god you didn’t wipe

Outro: (Ryan & Xavier)
Ryan: You tryna go eat some ass bro?
Xavier: You already know i’m tryna go eat some ass bruh what the fuck
