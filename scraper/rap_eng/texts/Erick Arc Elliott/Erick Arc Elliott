[Verse 1 : SHAMROCK]

They say hip hops dead, hurry call the E.M.T.s
White on the surface, little black underneath
And I spit it so sweet so they call me cookies cream
Keep your head up or i'll rock you, like a muufuckin screen
Beats, rhymes and money, homie that's my holy trinity
Endlessly, eating beats up, I'm the remedy
For the ill, I'm the vaccine
My flows cold boy, im the new Nat King
See me cruising in the GT,lady in white
Don't keep many bitches, but great Dane is my vice
Sitting up on the clouds, but never touched that sticky
Call me RUN R.M.C cause decifering is tricky
The first ones free, having you coming back for more
Got you fiending for this shit, got you guessing whats in store
Walter White up in this bitch, bow down to the king
Bout to blow up so y'all can call me Gus Fring
