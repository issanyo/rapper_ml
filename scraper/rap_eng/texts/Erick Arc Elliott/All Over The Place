So I sort of broke away, Let my angels float away
But lives a vicious cycle so I brighten up your day
You’re filled with such dismay, wipe your tears cause I’m here to
Promise that I’ll always be around if not
I’m not near you
Whispering a dream about us dancing with the sun
Collided with the moon to prove that im your number one
We’ve battled like before though the galaxies are mad at me I’d rather be a part of you alone in my reality
Not to see it comin’, I’m truly in my zone
But who’s to say I feel the same if I was all alone
You’re righteous and you’ve grown, and I been on a toggle
You switched around, which is why I speak with such bravado
My passion is what built me, determination kills me, but you remain this way, and your ways are so milky, bizarre
I’ve wonder why I’m always in your arms, searching you up in the sky, shining star is what you are
