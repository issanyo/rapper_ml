[Verse 1: GHOSTEMANE]
I'm about to put a hurtin' on a bitch soul
We take a eighth of psilocybe let it all go
Stuck in the middle of the earth
It ethereal
I'm bout to take a little trip and never come home
She dug a knife up in my chest until the blood flow
I'd rather lick it off and swallow every drop, oh
Everybody thinking I'm the devil but I'm really woke
By woke I mean I’m not susceptible to brain control but I know that
She tied a knot up in the gum with the tongue
Make me wanna take another cigarette in my gun
I’m sick of putting it in my mouth just saying fuck it I'm done
I know I never be the one to say the devil won
'Cept for one mage if I'm gonna be a Teller
I’m really feelin' like i’m tryna dip and reincarnate
I look up in the sky, and I think
When I'm done I really wanna take a dive in the lake and
Say goodbye to everything

[Verse 2: Shakewell]
Fuck a halo, keep a heater with you
Pocket rocket, pop and hope your people with you
Leave 'em bloody red
Really ain't an issue
Think his auntie sad
Get that bitch a tissue
Heard his army mad
I could give a fuck
All my cumpas pulling up in armored trucks
You be talking Migos, but ain't one of us
Hit a fifty cell, really I'm the plug
Just another day in the 6-1-4
Now they in Columbus talking Mexico
Chopping up the kilo then we slitting throats
Trap be in the kitchen cooking up a GOAT
No that ain't no slang for a fucking pack
Even if it was boy you couldn't cap
Even if you did it'd hit you with the tax
Shout out all my homie, made a mill off wax

[Verse 3: Pouya]
Yuh, yuh, aye
Death By Dishonor
You cross the wrong one
Your wig get pushed back
Underground Underdog
Need ten flat to be in the same room
Pop by the cut with a stick and the stained booth
Fuck whatcha heard
Baby I been around
Po-po 'round
We need a moment of silence
Running from the piece to get away from the sirens
Ain't a damn thing changed
'Cause we love the violence
Baby Bone, I'm an animal
Made a hundred thousand racks off the seminal
Eat a rapper up sick like I'm Hannibal
Got a bitch right off of the banana boat
Shakewell, make bail, set sail
Send a rapper to hell
Broke ass rappers
Man, they want me to fail
I made all the right moves
I'm never taking an L

[Verse 4: Erick The Architect]
Yeah, yeah
Usually I would just make the decision to kill 'em
Rest is for the willin' when you on the ceiling
Will he ever give a dividend again?
I'm moving diligent
This independent, mane
A minimum of dank
I'm on a bigger rank
I thank the lord for every saint
I can't describe a cannibal
I eat a rapper chapter one
I get up on you, read you like a palm
Shit is sticky since I got a system
I'm a killer, make a million off of this
That's how deep the pending coffin is
So all my villains break a law to this
Pray your lord forgives
I kill with confidence
I count the karma for my sons in orphanage
I'm bringing all them in 'til we all begin
There's no bargaining so quit arguing
