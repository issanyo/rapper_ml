[Verse 1: Salvador Dingus]
Watch how we do this
If you're new to this
Better sit the fuck down and listen bitch
Got the music in my soul kinda ignorant
But still better then your mother fucking penmanship
Mix psilocybin pills with hinduite
You act mother fucks ain't into it
Rolling up spliffs writing hieroglyphs in the womb of the tomb with bap and the boom and shit
On the real got Ganesh on my mind intertwined with the planets and the stars all aligned
I underachieve with the leafs of the green that stem from the pineal gem in my mind
Peep this blind eyes didn't read the signs
I am the universe verse just personified
Wanna know the crime that's wasting time
Need better rhymes to step to mines
Need a line just drop the hook
Worm ass kid basterd standing shook
Pine tree state of mind I swim in brooks
Wicked dope smoke medical check the books
Got flow drop stop go
Oh no white dude just stole the show
White like snow white girl is the code
Breathe slow when I medi so i need my nose
Fuck with the fam I get involved
Stick figure for life thats a noble cause
Applause to my bras snapping jaws and bras
R. Kelly lebanon whizzing all over ours
Testing me is testing god I'll test the odds of your testie squad translate the term testies are balls you fuck with trannie's that's a bitch with balls

[Verse 2: Jemineye]
This medi got me medicated
Say I'm high? I'm hella faded
Non-fiction like pulp but I'm super concentrated
Never acting wasted too you racists
See the hatred in your faces
Say you're happy like you made it
But your brain needs some infiltration
For inflation so you're smarter than usual
On my third eye shit make the situation usable
Ain't going too fast cause I'm on cruise control
I can rap fast if you really want me though
People never understand what's under my mind
Only time feels right when I'm spitting these rhymes
Some people hate it though like it was a crime
Open up your third eye, cause I've opened mine
See look at me, beat heat with the trees
A couple of these, these blunts Siamese
Girl on her knees, skeet skeet for free
A little inappropriate but these eyes Chinese
I do it for music, if you abuse it then lose it
You think that I'm a square but I'm more like a cubic
Zirconia, my style's old school like Babylonia
This Mary Jane is so good bloody red like my cornea's
