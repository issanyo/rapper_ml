[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Story teller without a record for the record
Make emcees feel threatened like the weapon was a smith&wesson
Pointed into their mid section
So I'm never wasting time stressin'
Without a question, rip the dutch then put the sess in
A tale of the skunk that made em sceptic
Cause "Either he's the shit or its his pits or its the piff that made us smell him"
Wasn't clear to em
Im oblivious yet they still take me in for questions
I'll ask for his ID then you'll be the one to check it
"You know who CJ is?
He seem so devious
Said he's a rapper and said we might have seen him spit
He looked so serious he wasn't serious."
Then I told em silly pigs go ahead and siri us
Donuts and coffee yeah the purchase cups
"PRO ERA?"
Yeah they searched us up
Then they said they had a warrant for arrest cause we were murderous
Worlds most wanted girlfriend burglar-es
Fuck all the Gerber stuff
Won't have to pay the price, so I'm guessing things are fine
No proof as far as we're concerned, I didn't do the crime
I asked for evidence then he recited all my lines
I swear I had a feeling they would get me for the lines
Though I never owned a crusher I still knew the grind
Been had the finest dimes
Way too ahead of the rest, gotta get the necklace
Shipment came in, the wavy flows too blaze for the records
Write autographs, legibly, best believe
I'm tryna be a legend
Lifestyle of tight ropin' on the edge n' only thing that get me nervous is not knowing if the legend
Ain't come first yet nor last being the best better then second..

Ain't come first yet, nor last, being the best better then second..

Mic, check it!

[Hook x2]
Keep your mouth closed, got doubt, know I got flows
So my route chose
Canoeing in the mainstream, you'll get out-rowed
Got em looking nervous and this is only the outro

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliot]
I ashed my last spliff on the dash
It was mixed with some hash
I get harassed cause my system on blast
Stick my head out, before I get out, cause it was wet out
My vanity is praised, so I don't fuck up my suede clothes (oooow)
Probably to concerned with gaining more
Probably to concerned with the day before
I'm probably to concerned with the waging war
Thoughts I ponder while in corner store, Whether
Physical building or my minds corner
Pigs tell me I got warrants
I see the strobe of indigo, resembling x men, mystique
I slide my thumb over my phone to read, A text when, She
Investigated the scene bread like sesame seeds
Now I'm at the  ?
"Show me your badge"
I chuckle cause I'll never have the power you have
? when you mad
Or decide when you sad
She only rolled me a ticket, I just took it and laughed (What the fuck?)
