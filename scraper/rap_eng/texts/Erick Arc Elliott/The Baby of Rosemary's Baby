[Intro]
It's Darky baby
Blotter Babyy, two Y's
Fleezus Christ
Dead Dibiase
Deady Guerrero
Aka I am not the father
Cause she a swallower...

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
You can't stand us, music make you wanna vomit
But I'm laughing at you, cause my future is promised
Bout to up the tax bracket, no more poor people problems
No more roaches and rats, no more work for my momma
No fake hugs and daps, only real niggas around us
No more living in hades, my thoughts are no longer cloudy
No four fifth in that gauge, no weapon shall ever prosper
The pain leaks from my pen, I over jot things around me
Too bad that shit I just named, are still things in my surroundings
Came to be friends, fuck a friend
Nigga even your friends will doubt you
That is until you prosper, leap over every obstacle
By then you'll be so far ahead they can't even reach out to ya'
I still got the same number, I just rather ignore ya'
Coldblooded, R.I.P. Rick James my nigga true story
And it's God bless the dead moment of silence for em'

[Hook]
These nightmares fucking up my sleeping habits
All this pussy fucking up my brand new mattress
Zombie Gang flipped the game on its axis
This here practice, my flow classic like premo scratches
These nightmares fucking up my sleeping habits
All this pussy fucking up my brand new mattress
Zombie Gang flipped the game on its axis
This here practice, my flow classic like premo scratches

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
Look at life, look at death almost share the same face
Look at failure, look at success, you fall and fly with the same grace
Grab that mirror look at yourself, embrace the flaws that may stay
Lick a shot for those who paved the way
Big-Big Poppa got shot for me
If that's the game then psychedelics showed them
They could levitate, if they just used they thoughts
Develop methods so my presence can flow through many dimensions, Precious Gems
I'm drooling on the track, like a bullmastiff
I'm extracting peyote from a cactus
While eating a mushroom sandwich
Ashes on my fabric from the last spliff, damn it
No gimmick, no alterimage, I said it, did it
Niggas wanna be it, cause I am it
Fuck a rap uniform and I don't need to pen it
To boost my image, who is you kidding
My ego, probably already the biggest
Megalomania, I have ascended
Iâ€™m like if Pac and Kanye got spliced and blended
Imagine shooting up a cops, and fender benders
A word bender, spit game im elemental
What's on your mental?
It don't matter, you brain matter splatter
Backseat of the Benzo
My pen drip murder ink, no Irving Lorenzo
Nigga, roll the extendos
Meech got that best flow
You see the temple, OG of tempo
Treat it like pistol finger and let blow

[Hook] (x2)
These nightmares fucking up my sleeping habits
All this pussy fucking up my brand new mattress
Zombie Gang flipped the game on its axis
This here practice, my flow classic like premo scratches
These nightmares fucking up my sleeping habits
All this pussy fucking up my brand new mattress
Zombie Gang flipped the game on its axis
This here practice, my flow classic like premo scratches

[Outbreak]
All black fashion me and my gat matching (nigga)
Christ ain't have this much passion (nigga)
Puff puff, no i ain't passin
