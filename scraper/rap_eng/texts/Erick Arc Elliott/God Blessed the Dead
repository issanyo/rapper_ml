[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
It's that Brooklyn phenom
Psychedelic Tzion, suspended in animation
While lookin down at you peons
Defying the laws of physics, while hitting gravity bongs
After she hit the spliff, her voice get raspier than T-Boz
If you don't like the way i live my life, why dont you take it
In all my past lives i've laughed in my killers faces
I'm into blood, beef, human mutilation
Extended clips squeeze, let it desinigrate em
I'm from a place where hell is considered a safe haven
Since its the root of all evil, we thank satan for this paper
I don't give a fuck about who pregnant or who rich
I dont give about her ice or his whips
Money blemishes, you can't spit the way you used to spit
Sometimes a artist become bigger then the art that he presents
Fuck the spectacle they put these fuck boys on the pedestal
I'm feeling skeptical, 'cause ignorance is bliss
I'm with my ignorantest chick
And ignorantest ain't a word, but I'm so ignorant it is
This the flow that send 'em shivâ€”ers
From every verse, from every curse
I am cursed with this curse to outdo my last verse
To outshine my last word, never decline
No backwards

[Hook]
I ain't here to tell stories
I ain't here to tell lies
The game ain't been the same since BIG fucked around and died
The game ain't been the same since Pac fucked around and died
The game ain't been the same since Pun fucked around and died
I ain't here to tell stories
I ain't here to tell lies
The game ain't been the same since L fucked around and died
The game ain't been the same since Pimp fucked around and died
The game ain't been the same since Steez fucked around and died
