[Intro]
Me and my nigga's
Refuse to be nigga's
Fuck a 9 to 5 to get paid
You gotta feel us

[Verse]
The river leaks, bleeding all in the sheets
Mission complete, hit her once in a week, I'm so geek
Creep on it nigga, sleep on it, I unleash
Carnage 'till the weed fornish my lungs at 21
Still a buster, Carmelo custard, crème brûlée
Complexion, you're the best that I've ever seen
You are everything, my jealousy was embarrassing
That was 23
24 was another war I am tore from
Awesome, storefronts, Pax Opus Nostrum
Pardon all my boredom, come and lace my Jordans
Sure hun, we can take you place were you enjoy sun
Never seen it coming, now she blowing on my Johnson
Narks come, pack the weed inside the mason jar, uh
This my repertoire, Sour Diesel out Gibral
Leave me with the text, for the sex when I leave her lone
I reply back, all good just a week ago
