The summer equals promising endevours
The trials of being discovered ain't always remembered
Motived by the only man that always had my back
Always quick to shut me down if my shit was whack
A couple years ago I wrote life as I saw it through my eyes
But my eyes were closed, frozen right beside my soul was doubtNever figure me out who was calling me weirdo
But look I came prepared though
Hard to ignore I'm only getting half
And those who put in half the work are always getting past
That shit is whack
My heart forever pumping something bitter
And so I had to let her go instead of fucking with her (yeah)
I aimed straight instead of walking like a blind fool
Better myself, and then enrolled into design school
So I could paint the picture twice;
One is cause I wanted to, the others cause I'm nice- it's the fruit of life
I'm on a mission like the man above
So if it's real then im sure you understand it's love
I can't accept, can't adjust, to the feeling of a touch
Man, the more that she's around the more I felt I've had enough
Feeling bitter on a daily day, I think about her so I'm drinking all my pain away
Light another dube, and if there's plenty in the pot then grab another spoon
Blue dreaming every day I feel like I'm a ?
Jotting till the pen dries
Invite a freak up to the crib and show her insides, man the good is gone
Erick's hitting ?
Bumpin to her favourite song
Board shorts is underneath and nothing but my hoodie on
And no make-up, sexy with the necklace out
Know she rocks the hoodie, she asks me what the text about
The love in us is like forever
It goes way beyond the me just filling up this sweater
Prepare me to the rarities of life
Closest to the heart and yet I've only seen him twice
Producing all the records that I always seem to write, and it's only right
Became the only rapper trying to give you good advice
And if you rolling girl, then be my Betty White
I told my man you should keep her if her head is right
Instead of getting on your nerves and trying to be polite
And all that you can say is "Man that's really nice"
Fishes? may wonder, ?
Shorty say she got you, then say it - god damn
You wanna trick your money, you say you got plans
Shorty got friends, I say I got fans
Gotta see some more today, probably make it all the way
Underwear is only brief, gotta think of more to say
All the things you've brought about we can take the order out
We can have a coffee over things that we ain't thought about
With no relation to the facts
So when I go record they always wonder where I'm at
I got a date with destiny, paid the bill and grazed? the best of me
But I'm still waiting on all these people trying to pressure me
Pressure me, yo these people trying to pressure me
We wanna cook it up but Erick knows the recipe (recipe)
But I gave you best of me
And take a look at who you are before you question me, bitch
