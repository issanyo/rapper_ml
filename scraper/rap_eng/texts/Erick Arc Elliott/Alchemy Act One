[Narration (Erick Arc Elliott)]
This is the story of a man who seeks to live out his dreams
Just as any other artist would
A dreamer, traveler, wanderer
A writer, an enthusiast, a producer
A thinker, a creative person
A lover, a brother, a son and a friend
He takes on many facets of responsibility
Because of his genuine addiction to create
What truly makes this man different from others
Is that his dream was not only to inspire others to push themselves
But also encourage a change of perspective through a unique experience and undying passion
He'd rather see you scrape a bruise to endure momentary pain
In order to be able to get back up again
Stronger
A person who has never failed will never know
How to deal with the billows of the bottom
And will never truly appreciate
What it's like to be comfortable with themselves
Pushing the boundaries to societal norms
This man took on the task to be an indifferent
While others stood by with a simplistic outlook
This man chose to specialize in playing music to couples
Who still desire the union of marriage
Although the world is twisted
He still believes there is hope
For finding love for everyone
Or atleast he'd hope so
