Fuck it, yea

Rolling through your hood without a G-Pass
Ain't no boys gon' bust like they need ass
It's all green dawg Imma breeze past
But the fiends Tim Duncan 'cus they need glass
And all these bitches know they need cash
'Cus i eat first, nigga's better eat last
'Cus we ain't fucking scared to let the heat blast
I'm masked up, gased up

The ritual to light a spliff or two
It's all we ever do, ahead of you, I got a better view
Collecting revenue, I met a fellow human who ingested chemicals
And made it so we never move
Except when he grab his genitals, I'm elevating
To the revelation on your Pedestal
'Rari on the topic, I am nothing like you ever knew
I could pay the better dues, be on my level too
You stuck on the first stage, Im stuck on my level two

The loiterer, the black warrior, the real euphoria
Taste that, don't waste that, the Nas formula
I freestyle for this bitch, she's a foreigner
I drag her back to my den, then I'm clawing her
Then I clubbing her, then Im thuggin her
Bitch know I'm wilding, bitch know I'm styling
Bitch know I'm styling like stally in a stalin
Styling 'cus I'm wilding, young and I'm violent

Awesome, plaing wheel of fortune in a foursome
I hold a jawsome and let her swim in the endorphins
And I divorce them, get's exhausting I toss 'em
Double cross 'em, true religious, not an auction
And i just got knowledge, middle finger fuck it
Whoever is not pollished, you just got dollars and I escaped college
Dreams not a -, zombie prestige so we gotta keep the trees lit

You hittin racks til your brain dead, shawty gased up; call that bitch wayne head
Meech told me I ain't gotta talk to em'. nigga lift em UP and spark to em
Nigga talk to em, make it so you ride them out
