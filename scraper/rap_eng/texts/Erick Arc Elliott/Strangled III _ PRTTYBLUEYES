[intro:]

Yeah, she ain't never coming back no more

[verse:]

And I just lay under the evening sky
Same colour as your pretty eyes
Sipping on some liquor as I wonder why
I write these verse they sounding like poems
I hope you know this, maybe I'll show you
Maybe we'll focus, maybe we'll blow it
But that's life it's bout them chances
Take a chance, girl let me know or let me go
You are a seed you need to grow, I'll give you sunlight

And yeah you need some "me time"
But we ain't got a lot of time so take my hand upon the ride
You'll stay afloat promise you'll ride
Promise you'll live forever as long as a nigga write
And you been right but now you need the boy cos it's my time
I done crime, yeah I do grind, had to make a flip with the bro's
Had to make sure the fam alright
Cos it's our time, we the need school
She the good girl in the bad crew but she the bad girl for the bad yutes, still the same girl with the tattoo
That's a bad tune

Still figuring out my angle
Still dealing with my anger
I could blame it on the goose babe, but true say I ain't like that

Still figuring out my angle
Still dealing with my anger
I could blame it on the goose babe, but true say I ain't like that no


[hook: x3]

I ain't never did this before no
Now I know exactly what to do now
'bout to runaway girl don't come and save me
Don't need no saving, word to my nigga Saeva

[verse:]

Take a hit on the spliff, I take a hit too
I shouldn't do drugs mummy but you know bout my shit moods
I'm in my zone, man they know, man they know
I'm in my zone, young nigga, heart cold
May 18th I was grinding, plus josiah taught me loads about timing

Now I ain't got time for the let downs, I just had to get it girl, I'm sorry that I let you down
Working on like 3 EP's I come with new sounds
Never sounding like i'm bragging man I'm sounding like i'm proud
All my niggas gotta get it, gotta pattern right now
We them new role models, we been them boys when niggas try role on you

And girl I can't lie I love this life but I want you

It'll probably make sense way down the line though
When they realise it heals over time though
Hope there's space in your heart for this guy though

It'll probably make sense way down the line though
When you realise it heals over time though
Hope there's space in your heart for this guy though

[pre-hook:]

And I feel like I'm the one to blame
But you tell me you don't feel no pain
But we both know that's a lie
We both know that you ain't alright
Babygirl just stop with the lies
I can see it in your eyes, them pretty blue eyes don't lie no

[hook:]

Them pretty blue eyes don't lie
Maybe we should take our time

Them pretty blue eyes don't lie
Maybe we should take our time

Them pretty blue eyes don't lie
Maybe we should take our time

Them pretty blue eyes don't lie
Maybe we should take our time

[Outro:]

And I feel like I'm the one to blame
But you tell me you don't feel no pain
But we both know that's a lie
We both know that you ain't alright
Babygirl just stop with the lies
Just stop with the lies, girl them pretty blue eyes don't lie no
