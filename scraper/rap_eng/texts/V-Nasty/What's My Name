You Already Know Me, My Name Keep Ringing
Left The Street Light Behind Now My Max Screaming
Bring It Competition Got These Rap Bitches Thinking
On The Top Now Make Sure I Wasn't Dreaming

It's Been A Long Time Coming But I Bet I Made It
Used To Be A Trap Star Now Bitch I'm Famous
Still Go To The Hood Can't Leave Who I Came With
If You Disrespect The Beat, You Is Where I'm Aiming
