[Chorus: V-Nasty]
I make these hoes run, that's what I do for fun
Got the AR, no kick, with the hundred round drum
Smokin this purple, and it's burnin up my lungs
Sittin with my stacks, cause I gotta have my funds
You wanna fuck with me, I ain't even trippin
Split him open, cause I caught his ass snitchin

[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
I keep a smarter hoe, she always pay attention
Bands in my pocket, so you know I ain't stressin
Still in the hood, ain't shit change
Only thing different, is a bitch name
I still keep them thangs, still take your chain
Movin too quick, so stay up in your lane
Don't get into nothin you can't handle
Cause fuck with me, you goin end up as a sample

[Chorus: V-Nasty]
I make these hoes run, that's what I do for fun
Got the AR, no kick, with the hundred round drum
Smokin this purple, and it's burnin up my lungs
Sittin with my stacks, cause I gotta have my funds
You wanna fuck with me, I ain't even trippin
Split him open, cause I caught his ass snitchin

[Verse 2: Lil Heenchi]
Bustin down Ps, yeah, I'm sellin 32
Big stick on the seat, you could catch this 32
2 bad bitches, that a motherfuckin 2-piece
Both hands, said it 2 times, like Gucci
Project nigga, so these bitches call me Lil Heenchi
Turn a mixtape to a motherfuckin Bentley
Round here for 10 years, they sure can't hear me
Lil ass nigga, use 4 5, I use 50
2 bitches down on a plane, I'm pimpin
A bitch on the net, and a bitch that be strippin
Skelly on the tech, all my niggas got didgets
Bands in my pants, while my hands straight whippin
Snapback on the block, my gang run shit
AK 47, that's my motherfuckin best friend
You want some money on his head, I put a band down
A nigga ran up on the way, now that's a man down

[Chorus: V-Nasty]
I make these hoes run, that's what I do for fun
Got the AR, no kick, with the hundred round drum
Smokin this purple, and it's burnin up my lungs
Sittin with my stacks, cause I gotta have my funds
You wanna fuck with me, I ain't even trippin
Split him open, cause I caught his ass snitchin
