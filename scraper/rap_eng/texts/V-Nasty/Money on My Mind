[Hook: Dirt Nasty & V-Nasty]
I've got time on my hands, but it's not too much
I've got money on my mind, but it ain't enough
I've got time on my hands, but it's not too much
I've got money on my mind, but it ain't enough

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
It's after midnight; I'm drunk than a motherfucker
My brother on stage crunk than a motherfucker
We cold cutting through the traffic in the mango Benz
One thing I learned: it's hard to find a good friend
Waiting on me to fall, ain't gonna be nothing
Haters plotting on; I know they want to steal something
Can't show no mercy, and these bitches thirsty
When I say "bitch," I ain't talking about the ones with purses
In this game, and they should have called me Pete Sampras
No kids in my camper, no need for Pampers
Rings and watches, bring the rocks in
I don't got enough time; you can bring the clocks in

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andy Milonakis]
I've got money on my mind, but fuck money and time
Got black maple hail, fuck Bacardi and lime
We only here for a half a second
So I've got no choice, yo, I have to wreck it
Have to kill it till we murder them all
Got no time for no damn phone calls
So text me, and if I don't text you back
If you text me again, you're gonna get smacked
I'm a bury my phone and move up to the mountain
Fuck Hollywood, fuck Vine and fountain
I'm spreading technology with my fucking Tech N9ne
Spitting that philosophy, you're gonna have to get in line

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dirt Nasty]
Time is money, and I'm broke as fuck
Got a fake Rolex and a broke down truck
Getting head in the hills from my Oakland duck
Yeah, quack quack, bitch, open up, uh
My life's the shit; it should be a movie
Nah, my life is shit; it's a B movie
Got my face buried in some D boobies
In the Pontiac, Queen Hooptie(?)
I used to have a doll shopping at the mall
Now I don't feel like myself, Avatar
One day I'm a be a big rapping star
Now I'm just a skinny white boy, after all
