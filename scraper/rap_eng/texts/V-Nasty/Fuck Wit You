CHORUS

When you ain got no change
They lookin' at ya strange
When everyday the same they don't fuck with you

When you on the front page
Centerfold, or centerstage
When you close to fame they gone fuck with you.

VERSE

They say I won't make it
I made up my mind
I ain quit skatin'
Bitch I stay on my grind

No limitations if it's on my mind
Paint a perfect picture like it's printed online

When you ain got no change
I'm feeling you the same
You always in my lane (Uh Yeah-Yeah, aay)

Get up out my face
I do this every day
Go ahead an hate (Uh Yeah-Yeah, aay)

They speaking my name
Because I'm gettin' paid
They see me on the stage (Uh Yeah-Yeah, aay)

Twistin' mary-jane
We tokin' different strains
Smoke one to the face (Uh Yeah-Yeah, aay)

I can't feel no pain
Cuz I been on them things
And I been up for days (Uh Yeah-Yeah, aay)

Back in the day
They say we gone pay
Dues to the grave (Uh Yeah-Yeah, aay)

BRIDGE
Care how much I love her and she good enough to leave
I was never chasin' hoes I was chasin' my dreams.
