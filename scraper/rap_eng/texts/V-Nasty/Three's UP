[Chorus: D.B. Tha General]
3s up, we sliding Veezas
We got our cheese up, mobbin with my feet up
Broke bitch, an old bitch, get your cheese up

[Verse 1: D.B. Tha General]
Money long, you know how that bitch go
Any nigga not bout doe, send that bitch right up the snow
He want 4, hell no
Man, you know that ain't goin go
See, 3 5, where we're at, bitch niggas die
Run and hide, I'm a motherfuckin goon
I'm a beast, in the dark full moon
In that whole cartoon, bitch talkin bout gettin chips, but ain't have no money
You ain't suckin dick, I'm on her quick
Show her that I'm with the shit
With the clique, so I gotta get sick
You trippin, gotta calm your ass down
Got the mac, and a couple racks, see, I'm from the town

[Chorus: D.B. Tha General]
3s up, we sliding Veezas
We got our cheese up, mobbin with my feet up
Broke bitch, an old bitch, get your cheese up

[Verse 2: V-Nasty]
Keep a zip, smokin on that good shit
You suckers hating on me, Imma show your ass hood shit
Playin with my money, I wish you would, bitch
I been gettin racks, out in Holliwood, bitch
I get sick quick, fuckin with the squad
Only on this day, you fuckin with the mob
Keep my 3 up, boy, that's who raised me
Eastside of California, that's who made me
I fuck with my hood, 35th, stand up
Ask about the last, hood rat now
It's a robbery, bitch, put your hands up
You hoes down there, while I got my bands up

[Chorus: D.B. Tha General]
3s up, we sliding Veezas
We got our cheese up, mobbin with my feet up
Broke bitch, an old bitch, get your cheese up

[Verse 3: Quise Tha Criminal]
Bitch, we T'd up, throwin them 3s up
Me and Evie blowin purple, he be havin a seizure
Run up on us if you want to, I bet we won't freez up
I'm the shoulder heater, rappin on, ain't no playin with them actors
I'm all about that action, choppers and them gloccs
Fuck dien in the hood, I kill you in the block
Hood niggas pistol whippin, start pimpin
Thes hoes like Cur DeRico
From uptown to shutdown, movin pounds
Doin shows, different citys
Real niggas, fuck m, on my dick, your bitch suck for me
Like a nigga that been to jail, I gettin a rest
We poppin bottles, me, and my brother Jeff

[Chorus: D.B. Tha General]
3s up, we sliding Veezas
We got our cheese up, mobbin with my feet up
Broke bitch, an old bitch, get your cheese up
