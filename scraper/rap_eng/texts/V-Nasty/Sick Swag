[Intro - Gucci Mane]
My neck and wrist coolin' and the champagne coolin'
I know you wanna fuck me baby girl who you foolin
I know you wanna fuck me baby girl who you foolin'
My neck and wrist coolin', and champagne coolin'
My swag so sick major labels try to clone it
My swag so sick major labels try to clone it

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I get money regardless
Say I'm one of the sharpest
Pull up just to park my jewelry game
And my cars are retarded
I walk around with a sharpie
I throw my top in the garbage
Say i’m Gucci Mane, when they hear my name
They pull out the red carpet
That’s your girlfriend charge it
I got her rolling with the heartless
Is she only like me ‘cause I talk good game
And my watch cost a fortune

[Hook - Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2 - V-Nasty]
Said it’s V-Nasty, I’m with Gucci girl
I put you in a scene and let you pop that coochie girl
Let’s make a movie, it gets juicy girl
Ain't gone touch it but you know that juice will sell
I’m in ATL, with ounces on the scale
I’m a bitch but I rock like a male
Last place you gonna see me is in a cell
Got a room full of bitches in a five-star hotel
I’m with my rollers so you know we on
Ain't down with the bitch til the money gone
If you ain't’ got racks don’t hit my phone
A bitch that's broke gone be left alone

[Hook - Gucci Mane][x2]
