[Verse:]
Broke niggas can't stand near me, bitch niggas be hella scary
Broke niggas can't stand near me, countin on the drum, you can't fucking hear me
Do you fucking hear me, I don't think you listening
Posted on my block, hoe, all my chains is glissening
All my hoes, I'm pimpin m
All these bricks, we sellin m
AK on the boat, we goin catch m snitches, man
Let the heat off, yeah, we make it drip on m
Got the 40 on my hip, take the 40 off my hip for m
I will take your chain, talk to my team, I toat the thing
You see the eyes, you see the plane
Will take his doe, won't say his name
All these hoes, off the pills
30 shots, don't mess around
Leavin that fuckboy on the ground
DOA, yeah, hear the sound
Money took control of me, that guap all over me
Fuck with all of my niggas free, that gold house, to the ENT
Double cheese, we don't fuck with Rooggers
Smoke OPD, they done took my shooters
Sware to god, I'm goin insane
Got half a quarter, now they hatin on my whip game
Didn't have a dollar, now they hatin on my bitch, man
Trappin out of Benzos, now they hatin that I'm rich, man
I fuck with Mo, and I fuck with Kreay
Fuck with Benzes, and fuck with Lambs
Fuck with Rob, fuck with Slim, fuck with Ty, we all shooters
Blood gang, we all shooters
