But its all good cause now I'ma Fuck all your friends!
I hope it hurts when you see me on the Grammys with my new chick
And you gon wish it was youuuuu

[ Verse 1 Magneto Dayo ]

I picked you up from work
You had an attitude!!!!/
I'm like save that shit for
Who it matters to!!!!/
Can't be mad at me cuz
I'm mad at you!!!!!/
Always using excuses when it's something I had to do/
Act like you don't wanna see me succeed/
Brain full of jealously, deceit and greed/
I'm like let me breathe, you act like I'm your son/
I already got a mother I don't need another one/
Because you harass, nag and ask aggravating questions/
[ V Nasty ]
Where you at? What you doing?
[ Magneto Dayo ]
What you had for breakfast?
And that's sickening/
I wanna know what it feels like to take a piss again/
Without you listening

Hook - Magneto Dayo] X2

[ verse 2 - V Nasty ]

I hate you! Hate you! Wish I didn't date you
Thought you was real you turned out to be fake dude
Can't fuck with you, you on some other shit
Stop calling me boy go find another bitch
Pack your shit, Get out skedaddle
Go far away, go to Seattle
It don't matter just know its a wrap/
You erking my nerves I  can't handle that/ wasting my time I can't get it back/ stupid ass punk didn't know how to act/ changed my number he got it right back/ lemo pulled up they like who is that/
Syrup goin down ounce after ounce/
Bouncing out things that you can't pronounce/
No looking back to busy in the industry/
If I get killed everybody gon remember me

[ Magneto Dayo ]
