[Intro]

Cause I'm high right now
And I ain't comin' down
Haha, Nasty
Okay

[Verse 1]

50k in ones (dance)
Cocaine on my gums
Kush up in my lungs
All my bitches going dumb (Aye)
Damn that ass is fake
But, damn them tits is real

She crushin' up them pilla cause she loves the way it feels
I know I give you chills'
My game is extra cold
Gotta pocket full of money and my bitches on the stroll
Cause they all do what they told
Bitch it's Nasty, Vanessa
I pimp her, you stress her

You trickin' off them [?] tryin' to impress her
Pour the champagne on her chest
Smoke a blunt and then undress her
She got down on her knees
I told her that I bless her
Put the .40 on the dresser
20k up in my safe
These bitches hella fuckin high, they can't feel they face

[Hook]
I'm high up off them drugs
I sip, I smoke
Bad bitches only cause that's all a bitch know
I pop, I sip, I lean I smoke
Throw my money up and watch it...

Spin down the pole, spin down the pole
I throw my money up and watch her spin down the pole
I pop, I sip, I lean, I smoke
Throw my money up and watch it...

[Verse 2]
Nasty!
Aka stay poppin' them rubber bands
Too loyal for the other side, I don't fuck with them other [?]
She spinnin' round the pole, something like a ceiling fan
The baddest bitch I ever seen
Swear to god this ho be killin' it

I throw my hunnids up
Watch her spin down on that pole
Face like Halle Berry and that ass out of control
I pop, I sip, I smoke, lets blow
[?] lets go
I'm the dopest of the dope
Anywhere I'm standin' you a basic ass bitch
My life is outstandin
In the club I'm throwin' thousands
Watch them bitches fall
My whole team here bitch watch us while we ball

[Hook x2]
