[Chorus]
I remember when I was just a little girl
I was, I was in my own fucking world
I remember when I was just a little girl
I was, I was in my own fucking world

[Verse 1]
Now I'm lil' older, heart a lil' colder
Come in her window, wake her up like Folgers
I don't give a fuck if my day is getting closer
I'm going out a legend, bitch, I thought I told ya
R.I.P. to all my fallen soldiers
I swear to God, this shit heavy on my shoulders
For Mounter Feist, send my A-Bitch a solder
And I'm pimping in these streets, game over
If you pull out, you better bust that bitch
If you fucking her, you can't trust that bitch
I cut through in the backstreets, with a fully loaded clip

[Pre-Chorus]
Forty Thang, you already know that I make it rain
Insane, no brain, knock you down with no name
Sucking, boy, I take the train, 35th set is what I bang
85th, Mama house
Come on down, I'll knock you down

[Chorus]
I remember when I was just a little girl
I was, I was in my own fucking world
I remember when I was just a little girl
I was, I was in my own fucking world

[Verse 2]
First day of school, kindergarten
Nikes on, just started
I was too young, didn't know nothing
That was my ear, steal something
Dad hella crazy, didn't even know
'Til 5-O come in the back door
Friend got killed with the cash and the coke

[Pre-Chorus]
Forty Thang, you already know that I make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain, knock you down with no name
Doing her shit, bring the choppas out
Fans right there, helicopters out
Getting hella money, can't stop me now
Bitch tryna plead, I rock the crowd

[Chorus]
I remember when I was just a little girl
I was, I was in my own fucking world
I remember when I was just a little girl
I was, I was in my own fucking world
