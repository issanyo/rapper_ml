[Intro]
Bitch, you keep calling me! This shit is hella irritating, god damn
These hoes just be crazy nowadays Sheesh!

Bitch, stop hittin' my phone, hoe leave me alone
I'm high up in my zone, can you please not call my phone?
What the fuck bitch, I don't even like you
You keep hittin' my phone gone make me wanna fight you
I just woke up and you callin' with that bullshit
You remind me the reason I walk round with a full clip

Irritating bitch gone make me want a new bitch
I'm hopin' she a cool bitch cause girl you are just through wit
I'mma hit you next week, cause bitch you are just crazy
You are not my lady, tomorrow is a maybe
But bitch you gotta pay me, so I hope you pay
Cause if you not, then its not your day
