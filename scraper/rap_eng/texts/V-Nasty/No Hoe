[Verse 1: Icewear Vezzo]
I ain't sayin shit till the case closed
Niggas gettin hit, with this shit I bought, cost me more than a bankroll
Peddy ass niggas, I hate those
Pipe on me, if it's anything less than a bank closed
I don't drink X, that's an eight poured
50 a line, 2 4s
Do the math, I stay blowed
All these bad bitches love me, I stayed toated
Stay iced up, I stay froze
These real niggas know I don't got fake stones
I play more mud than a lotta niggas
I don't really like a whole lotta niggas
I ain't even goin lie to niggas
Coope's full of Cali and Pradas in it
And niigga, fuck you, got problems with us
Shooters and robbers with us
Watch so sick, see the doctor with it
Black man wearin Gucci, shoulda came with a chopper with ya
I was goin chill, but I'm tired of niggas
24 in the trentches, we mobbin it
Who else is the hottest, nigga

[Chorus: Icewear Vezzo]
Get out my bidness, nigga, you don't know nothin bout me
Imma tell you one thang, that's for sure, niggas know, ain't no hoe up out me
Ain't no hoe up out me

[Verse 2: V-Nasty]
Ain't no hoe up out me, I keep a hoe around me
I keep that doe around me, you goin broke around me
Said I'm sippin on that drank, and I might OD
Said I might OD, I'm a young OG
If i pop it with the bitch, then the bitch o me
Fuck her fast, then send her to the D
Jaseffies on my feet, to match my Jesus piece
Warriors and P
I done killed a nigga, I done drilled a nigga
I don't build a nigga, keep it real, my nigga

[Chorus: Icewear Vezzo]
Get out my bidness, nigga, you don't know nothin bout me
Imma tell you one thang, that's for sure, niggas know, ain't no hoe up out me
Ain't no hoe up out me
