[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
I need me that guap, or that sucker gettin shot
You know I got the glocc, and you know that thing hot
Niggas talkin tough, when I knowin that they not
I only get the call when his bitch get knocked
Bitch, I need the guap, posted with the squad
2 in the blunt, never need a job
I really need this change, but the nigga need the rock
I be steppin when them bitches get outa line
I be going, and them niggas be in front of me
Bitch, I want the kill, and it's not that hard to find me
Bitch been in the streets since 1990

[Chorus: Celles]
I need me a guap, I need me a guap
See, I need me a lot, this shit don't stop

[Verse 2: Trill Prada]
Grew up, in the hard nocks
Ladies love me, I'm a heartthrob
Yeah, that hottie gave me throat job
And she answer all my phone calls
I'm a young nigga in the street, in this game, I'm big bro
Bullshit come through, hell no, nigga
Me and my crew, we do it all
Do it all, and I ain't even 23
Mack and V, goin kill for me
Young cowboy, he kill you in his sleep
I was only 19, in the profile jeep
Throwin racks in the club, all day, with Giggy Peet
15 years, send me back, 33
Make sure you rap m, don't let the shit leak
I'm a day old city nigga, give me what you got
Cause I'm phomin at the mouth, and I need me a guap

[Chorus: Celles]
I need me a guap, I need me a guap
See, I need me a lot, this shit don't stop

[Verse 3: V-Nasty]
Nasty!
Remember when I never had a dollar in my pocket
Nigga hatin on me, but he know he need to stop it
Some BG, some white, man, you know we get it poppin
Niggas talkin tough, when I show up, drop it
Coppers got me on the red page
Fuck every teacher whoever gave me bad grades
I was daydreamin, smokin backstage
And my sidekick check the work on the backpage
This shit don't stop, I need my guap
If a nigga scared, then a nigga need a glocc
Real ass bitch, never work with the cops
Got a hundred on the K, just to air out them Ops

[Chorus: Celles]
I need me a guap, I need me a guap
See, I need me a lot, this shit don't stop
