[Hook]
Just to make it through
Ooh, but nobody wanna lose
Nobody wanna fail, nobody wanna die
We just tryna live our lives

[Verse 1: Kurt Diggler]
They don't understand me, so fuck it
I'm on my new shit
Baby mama stressin' and trippin', won't let me see the kids
Now the feds at the house
You tell them where I'm fuckin' at
Cuz I remember in '02, bitch you didn't have my back

[?] had a nigga back
[?] nigga had a strap[?] stay behind them suckas [?]
But nigga comin' back, that good pussy, I love that
Them big old racks, I love that
Still I want that whole stack
Came in with that red 'Vette
With my ice on but my lil dog kept hatin' on me
So I made his bitch get [?]

Y'all follow me cuz yall been lost
I'm a made nigga
I've been boss
So I'm made like Rick Ross
I'm [?] like 2Pac
I ride around with my new Glock
Pop yo ass like guwop
89 is my block, my lil niggas get headshots

Funk around and get yo heart stopped, you slide through on my block
My clip tight like [?] knots
My clip tight like [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: V-Nasty]
40 under my Gucci belt, 40 under my Gucci belt
Knocked that nigga bitc, it was the worst feeling he ever felt
Took a bitch bands and I stacked'em up for my fuckin' self
Niggas mad at me, I ain't askin for no fuckin' help
Better ask about me round these streets
Hot shots from big chops hold 2-2-3's
I'm choppin shit down, knock him off his feet
She said she got 5 on it, ho I need 10 g's

I could see a bitch wit potential through a blind fold
They know my name from West Oakland to 9-0
And I don't know what you been told
But I send any bitch that got 10 toes
My neck is gold and my wrist is [?]
I was on the block, had to chase the cheese like a rat
7 AM, I was up early in the in the trap
I was gettin my bands
My [?] was more than that

[Hook]
