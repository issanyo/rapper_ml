[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
I'm runnin round the town, in my new whip
Co-Co white, call that cool whip
I took your hoe, she my new bitch
Where I'm from, the streets, we do trips
Keep my asian bitch, she goin hella places
Flyin back home, Luie full of big faces
Gotta 7 60, for you PM Rods
Beemer, Benz or Bentley, European cars
Just touched down, I'm in London
Keep a bad bitch, she keep it comin
I need a bottle, so catch me at the bar
Four in the air, cause, bitch, I'm a star

[Chorus: V-Nasty]
12 more flights, bitch, I'm goin far
Need a bad one, keys to the car
She a forin bitch, she need a green card
Syrup in my cup, cause bitch, I lean hard

[Verse 2: Erk Tha Jerk]
Ridin round the hood, by my motherfuckin self
50 dollar jeans, with a hundred dollar belt
My girl with me, make the whole club melt
I'm drippin bread, nothin but the top shelf
I keep rappers all in my phone, them coppers all in my radar
You want the hit, that probably goin cost you, if you want it, probably ain't goin pay you
She say she love a nigga, I'm hella slick
Got 2 forin bitches, straight from overseas
Higher than a private jet, told that bitch don't call my phone, if she ain't tryna get low
If she ain't tryna get low, if she ain't tryna buy J
While I'm doin what I'm doin, bitch, I'm bout to get payed

[Chorus: V-Nasty]
12 more flights, bitch, I'm goin far
Need a bad one, keys to the car
She a forin bitch, she need a green card
Syrup in my cup, cause bitch, I lean hard
