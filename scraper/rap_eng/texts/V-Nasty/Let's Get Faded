Baby, let's get faded
Hell yeah, get wasted
We can have a little fun
But you ain't my lady
She got a pretty little girl
But it ain't my baby
When I see her in the club
The girl drive me crazy

(Gucci Mane)
Man this shit get drastic
She bounced back like Magic
Pass by like Magic
She see my flying through traffic
It's Gucci Mane, you bastard
And I'm a known shoe-addict
Got em fallin out the attic
I'm a real hood classic
Zaytoven is nasty
Teamed up with V-Nasty
Came in a V-12
You ain't even gotta ask me
Hundreds falling out my safe
Hundreds falling out the case
Spent a Million on the case
Half a million on the bracelet
Quarter-mil for the anklet
Got her flexin on her famous
Money flying out the anus
My swag in Uranus
Baby you ain't my baby
But your swag something crazy
Yeah she got a little son
But it ain't my baby

Baby, let's get faded
Hell yeah, get wasted
We can have a little fun
But you ain't my lady
