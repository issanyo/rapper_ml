[Verse 1: V-Nasty]
Look at me I'm on the block with my niggas now
Disrespect us and we gonna pull the pistols out
I heard you niggas ain't bout what you be talkin bout
But I come into your house and leave you leaking on the couch
Now a nigga can't speak

Bet he should've watched his mouth
Harder than your dad
They let a real bitch out
I ain't do shit that you niggas see on the news
They can't catch a bitch like me

I ain't leave no clues
Tell the bitch to cut
Throw up the duece
Couldn't fuck with the bitch cuz her pussy too loose
I kill niggas
And I touched his baby mma

Come back to a nigga like my name is Karma
Harder than Karma
Yeah I'm the bitch
Well known in the hood cuz I hit licks
I don't give a fuck

And I'm mobbin' on the industry
Bitch you ain't a friend of me
Ho you is my enemy
Bitch you ain't a friend of me
Ho you is my enemy
