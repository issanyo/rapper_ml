X2: Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Throw it up, throw it up
That's how we ball out

Throw it up, pour it up
Bitch, ain't no problem to me
No, we rock the rozay
Don't bother, VIP
Standing on that couch
Straight flexing on that G

When I pull into that club
Everybody DIE
They asking MORE PCP
Bouncing with two fire hoes
Right outside of me

Rest in peace
Rest in peace
Bring that to the cemetry
Cash these millions that I got
I'll have your broke ass buried

Ya bitch! Ya bitch! Ya bitch!

Oh woah oh
All I see is signs, all I see is dollar signs
Oh woah oh
Money on my mind, money money
On my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky

X2: Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Throw it up, throw it up
That's how we ball out
(Ya bitch! Ya bitch! Ya bitch!)

X3: That's how we ball out

Aye, want it, bitch?
Quit talking shit
Cause you ain't stuntin' hard
Golf course, parking lot?
Shit, that's in my front yard!

Show money is no money
That's a tip to the bodyguard
Been doing what you  dreaming about
I'm a human shootin' star!

50k, 50k, 50k in my ear
I'm smoking on that loud
If you talking, I can't hear! (Shut up)
50k, 50k for V-Nasty to appear
If I wanna see the realest bitch
I look up in the mirror (That's me)

Oh woah oh
All I see is signs, all I see is dollar signs
Oh woah oh
Money on my mind, money money
On my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky

[Hook]
X2: Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Throw it up, throw it up
That's how we ball out
(Ya bitch! Ya bitch! Ya bitch!)

Throw it up, throw it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
