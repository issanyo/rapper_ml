[Chorus:]
I kill a nigga quick in the hood, nigga
All about my chips, on the hood
I gotta get rich, nigga, on the hood
I fuck your bitch, nigga, on the hood
I never switch up, nigga on the hood
Never change up, nigga, on the hood
Can't go no Holliwood
I put that on the hood

[Verse:]
I can't switch up, I'm too real for that
The respect that I done got, they'd kill for that
The team is all I got, so I drill for that
He snitchin on his blood, I don't feel for that
And my name is V-Nasty
Always in the hood, but I ain't too flashy
Speakin on my name, and them guns get to blasting
AR pink, and in that thing, it's plastic
Can't leave for too long, so I can't change
On the block with the glocc and the gold chains
Double Gs, glocc gang
I die for my hood, on everything

[Chorus:]
I kill a nigga quick in the hood, nigga
All about my chips, on the hood
I gotta get rich, nigga, on the hood
I fuck your bitch, nigga, on the hood
I never switch up, nigga on the hood
Never change up, nigga, on the hood
Can't go no Holliwood
I put that on the hood
