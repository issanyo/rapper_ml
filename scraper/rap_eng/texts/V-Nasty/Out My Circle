(V-Nasty)
Yeah, my favorite color purple
Sippin' on that purple, smokin' on that purple
You ain't got that get the fuck up out my circle
Bitch get the fuck up out my circle

(Gucci Mane)
Yeah, my favorite color purple
Sippin' on that purple, smokin' on that purple
You ain't got that get the fuck up out my circle
Bitch get the fuck up out my circle

(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)
Gucci mane and I'm talkin' bout rounds and shit
V-Nasty alley oop the brick and I slam the shit
I'm kinda country when I talk, you understand this shit?
I'm not romantic but I cook my dope candle lit
I ain't helpful for these hoes like a cancer stick
And if a chick act up, she a cancer bitch
Its Gucci Nickelodeon and you just the custodian
I never say never so I might be cookin' dope again
The ball is in my court
I love ma partnas _______
Worship in Detroit and they love me in New York
Half a million on the floor, another million on the table
Purple Drank, Purple Lean, Purple Pills, Purple Label

(Verse 2: V-Nasty)
Bitch its Nasty
Said I'm high off the liquid
Lean queen aka the Brick Kid
At ya front door
Bitch I hear shit
Got whole bricks, cos I'm sippin'
You know me girl, I'm rollin' up the purple stuff
High of the lean
Bitch I can't get enough
I'm on the block, never walkin' lonely
At night in the hood, rockin' with my 40
Knocking at ya window, 3 in the morning
30 city trip, ho I be touring
Take a bitch money while she on vacation
Why you saying I ain't mobbin', cos im Caucasian?
