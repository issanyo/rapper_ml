Believe me sweetie it's plenty to feed the greedy
Musician's hip of greatly ? on any recorded date
Jammin' up at Mittens, smoking the savoy
Still ain't got no union card, still unemployed
How much my reads?
Well I only got one left for my gig with Teddy Hill
And if Ben ain't got an extra one, Prez will
The tequila stung my tongue into bee hive
My head spinnin' into G drive
I'm Charles Dutton cause I rock live
Leave the stage enough hand jive
God bless John Birks Gillespie
Who could the best be?
Did the show, what's my fee?
"Dolla Bill"
Move ya mind, ya can't see me
I'm big my now, tree picking 'n' we half now
Wann work for me now?
Me not pay you a red stone ? copper
"Dolla dolla bill y'all"
And sucksive, for the world this that song!
