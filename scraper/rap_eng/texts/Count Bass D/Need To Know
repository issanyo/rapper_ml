[Intro]
You need to know that this is nothing for the radio your labels won't jock me (jock me, jock me, jock me)
You need to know that this is nothing for the radio your labels won't jock me
This is nothing for the radio your labels won't jock me
This is nothing for the radio (radio, radio, radio)

[Verse 1]
Remove hip hop and increase gang culture
Hip hop from identity, human the structure
Never been underground, just made that old real shit
I hate hate we proclaim from our poor pit
Moves sabbatical, Wi-Fi high
Beethoven street dedicated and fly
All I want to do is feed my seeds and build my legacy
Make music for the future only future is in front of me
No such thing as time  or space
One race, the human race
Differences in language and features of the face
'89 I was a magical, classical, a tuxedo
Now it's me myself and I, Twit one and Vido
After me there will be another and another
Never be another me although we are all brothers
Hip is the father, hop is the mother

[Hook]
You need to know that this is nothing for the radio your labels won't jock me
This is nothing for the radio your labels won't jock me
This is nothing for the radio (radio, radio, radio)
You need to know that I'm much better than you

[Verse 2]
Drugs and hip hop, recipe for regret
On her knees, dressed for success
Triple six, triple X
Next morning sober praying she ain't vexed
She don't bring no drama, but vibes are no more
Reminds me of my mama, although she's not as pure
Reality mainland, fantasy island
Playboy stage hands, backstage whiling
Calamity Jane, average Joe
Good-hearted trick copped a thieving ass hoe
Just goes to show actual factitial
Every good deed is what he get punished for
Life in the ?, orgasms come a lot
A drum machine player who wood sheds a lot
Jigga wrote rhymes, beat by Retrogott
We fellowship, shoot this shit then record a lot
Thousands of records, but only two needles
Built with said G McCartney founder of the Black Beatles
They say I think so, I confirm it is so

[Hook]
You need to know that this is nothing for the radio your labels won't jock me
This is nothing for the radio your labels won't jock me
This is nothing for the radio (radio, radio, radio)
You need to know that I'm much better than you
