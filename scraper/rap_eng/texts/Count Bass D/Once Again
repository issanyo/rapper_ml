[Verse 1:]
My flow pattern, that of a classic, symphony
A magical timepiece, with unseen symmetry
Accurate still, after a quarter of a century
Indelible spells cast by warlocks and wizardry
Print at it, know that toe taggin instantly
I illustrate, so you can see it all visually
The beat save, next we expand the memory
Travel the land spreading ma musical ministry
Guard-like on plex I’m whippin ma short mic
The rhyme is a reminder why I stay up all night
Hitplay, next day, know that you top flight
Not a bad way to spend half ma adult life
Invested in myself when nobody else believed
Now d whole world proud of what I achieved
Things changed, now I’m lookin like d safest bet
Just gettin started ain’t saying nothing yet

[Chorus:]
(You rap about violence too much)
(Once again)
(You want a fresh style, let me show you)

[Verse 2:]
Fat vegans body shamin you, niggas gotta improve yourself don’t blame me
Extended victims tryna play me
You can do anything in this world except when you’re angry
Weaker than they that mourn an look sympathy
Fall with grace not on your face
Obsess less reinvent yo joylessness, death, of the heart an soul-unhappiness
What are you a martyr? Meaning riots starter?
Complacency of the companies, Facebook always listens
Privacy is fantasy, we’re warlocks on d block, practising bitchcraft
A little spit and polish an it’s as good as you
Buy yo mean degree it’s royalty free
The same people who claim to have no religious beliefs
Are the same ones who fill my timelines wid comments about sports team

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Yow I sing a song, infinity gauntlet ringers on
My conscience response to it by watching d consciousness, bring em on
I gas em an blow up smoke in dem ass enough to build a bomb
Even when it’s warm in d storm my tenders wants m&m been d creme de la creme
Go tell a friend
Remember me I’m hard to forget, respect d elephants
I, God to Tom-Tom mack, to wise guys ipod crack
No eyes on Lebron mon stat, I’m a maud Rashad John cat
I’m come equipped wit d poisonous ink
To prepare ma dallas pen for combat jack
When cognac's crack that couldn’t understand the flow so fat
An made a waterfall fall back
Lacking definitions cats asking “What you call dat?”
Tell em all dat, valor hat the sultan map of mauve raps
With print math, money is made with print math
Dis fast, kid be just laugh, it’s witchcraft

[Chorus]
