And this beat right here was crafted by
J. Rawls, Columbus Ohio
Yeah, This is a Ohio Playas, collaboration

[Verse 1]
I want a job to go to, not to be at
What's good for the goose
Is good for the propaganda, meander
Through the hall, Neanderthal, it's like this y'all
They always tryna ask me questions y'all
Count bigga nigga got more talent only y'all could figure
Please don't invite me to the booth my nigga Tigger
I ain't Jigga, just a poor black nigga
In 6th grade got my first C
Think I got more talent? Mos def
In college I got my first F
Dribble with my right hand, never with my left
I never play Basketball, I only tap out the beats
When J. Rawls don't
I, I, I love Paula Poundstone
It's another milestone
Intimidate MCs with the tone of my vonal drone
When I'm dishin' on the microphone
I'm automatic like the Sandbox, or The Pointer Sisters
Or maybe even Prince for instance
It don't make sense to me
For me to even see you even thinkin' bout you better than me
50 feet is all I need for me to breathe
Fourth child conceived
Kush Cana Hezekiah
He brought me out of the muck and mire
Oriana, hell, brimstone and fire
The dog still hot like Oscar Myer
Count Bass Iyah
Much ration
Antigen
West Indian facts I'm speakin'
Heads I'm tweakin'
Is it weed you smokin'?
Hehehe, jokin'
Bobby Brown said, every little step I take you'll be there
Any weather, even in this Tennessee tornado weather
Hey fellas gather round, lemme tell ya bout this beat
That's blowin' my mind
Understand me?
J. Rawls, Count Bass
