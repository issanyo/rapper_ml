[Intro/Chorus]
Dwight Spitz
(You need to know that I'm much better than you)
(Make the illest beats-- scared of none of y'all)
(Scared of none of y'all)
(You need to know that I'm much better than you)
(Y'all brothers is getting vicked with your publishing--)
Dwight Spitz
(You need to know that I'm much better than you)
(Make the illest beats--I'll just wait 'till your finished)
(You need to know that I'm much better than you)
(Make the illest beats--scared of none of y'all)

[Verse 1]
Dwight Spitz a capitalist, capitalizing on this rap
Y'all niggas know me, though I got dropped in '96
Breaking even
Keep it hostile, et cetera
But please believe it, I'm the baddest in my sector
Stash beats in the vault to make you wanna halt your rap dreams
And schemes to surface beat themes
Countbassd.com with all power in my palm
I remain calm, and gently spit this napalm
Five deep at all times, gun count is zero-nines
But if the beef is well done, I can find mine
Turn up the sound, that I spread around
I'm much better than this, right now I'm dumbing down
And when your mind can begin to rock my full potential
I'll be long out the door like my man Paul Mitchell
I've been eating off of rap for nine years
Don't speak about the five years of dues I payed before that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
