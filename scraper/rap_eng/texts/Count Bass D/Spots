I hit spots from state to state
Not only Phonoluxe or Great Escape
You may have a lotta beats but you don't know what to do with em
So why you fool with em? (Repeat 6x)

You're "Foolin Yourself" with your Little Feat
And "It's A New Day" but you can still get your Skull Snapped
That's why y'all smoking Rocks by the Creek in the Park
"You Can Make it if You Try" and that's word to Sly
Oh "Yes You Can Can" Dance to the Drummer
And maybe y'all can stop all this Madness in the Summer
It's the C-O-U-N-T, like Kool & the Gang
But Koolout was the man when the Mardi Gras bells rang
So "Come Dancing" when the dogs bark
And then the lights get dark, you "Slow Dance" with Stanley Clarke
Think he wants some? He's not Paul C, just the drummer
You think you young and find see your whole style is butter
Do you think they "Give the People" what they want just because
They got the rap section all up in the front?
"In the Land of Milk and Honey" it's a shame and it's wack
They think you "Sneakin' in the Back"

I hit spots from state to state
Not only Phonoluxe or Great Escape
You may have a lotta beats but you don't know what to do with em
So why you fool with em? (Repeat 4x)

I know this girl that just don't care
She got "Long Red" hair, and gets higher than a Mountain
In the 90's, I guess that means she's blacker than me
Cause what's a S.O.U.L if you can't feel the bass pounding?
A "Message for the Inner City" is what I'm about
My leg is broken and I'll still do a show, no doubt
And after be by myself or maybe hang with some kiddies
You catch the Roachclip from Ashley and skip the next three cities
If you God who Made Me Funky, it sure wasn't you
Cause I'm better than you, I rock those silly hairdos
Six years ahead of you, before you even thought of Singing Simple Songs
With George smoking Cheeba Cheeba outta bong
The Mexicans ask me to Groove Holmes at shows
Cause y'all Schoolboy gets Crushed when you don't study the prose
It's all your fault, you're broke with no solution
Cause Impeaching the President is just a Simple Substitution

I hit spots from state to state
Not only Phonoluxe or Great Escape
You may have a lotta beats but you don't know what to do with em
So why you fool with em? (Repeat til fade)
