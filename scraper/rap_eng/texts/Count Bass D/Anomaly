Cut through your cerebral cortex, lobotomy
I have a hypothesis, you niggas just anomalies
There ain't no stoppin' me so tell em step the fuck back
Slap yo' bitch in the face with the dick and she could suck that
Outgun cats who run gats across the border, potential's untapped
You lookin' like you stunned, Jack
Am I amazin' you? Definitely outplayin' you
The odds against me million to one and I'm bout maimin' you
And that ain' a reference to emulatin' you
Yeah nigga I'm talkin' bout stab and slash, straight bloodstainin' you
Straight up degrading you, drag you through the mud and then good day to you
On yo' knees but who you prayin' to? God can't save the game 'cuz I'm athe-oops
Did I let my finger slip? Bullet to the brain and crimson red on your fingertips
Melt the body hydrochloric, dump container in a ditch, no DNA or evidence
Serial murderer with melanin in the pencil tip, Ninja mental trip
You know I leave 'em breathless 'cuz I'm remembered as a fuckin' skeleton
It's obviously evident that the competition irrelevant and Ninja aimin' at the throne
Throwin' grenades and smack 'em in the dome and see if that put some sense in 'em
Tryna fill my pocket with pounds not dollars in the rental whip
Full speed, crash test dummy feelin', puffin' blunts with the best of 'em
No comprende son, 'cuz I no speaky Ingles
Came up on an island no not Rikers as I spit phlegm
This a written exam, drippin' acid on my tongue as I blast off
U, double-S, R, rocket ship, fire at my finger rips through papyrus ligaments
Yeah I know you bitches sick of me and my rhetoric
Godlike flow, effervescent sip then strategize the disk
The Def Ninja runnin' in with fulminated mercury trailin from my pantleg
Hell below, we all finna go, word to Curtis and the track's end
'cuz there's a hell below...
