Leo-street literature
Front passive to the masses
For whom he nominates to dominate and keep castin'
Promotion serves ego, advertising yields confidence
Fight her A-trains for glory, fighter B eyes the purse
After the love is gone, the fun is a verse
Yet they constantly debate whether greed is worse
Muscular beats for feat, free market the new scheme
Old rebel regime no female left behind
She exercises her right not to listen to anything anybody has to say
Her name is May
And that's exactly where her chips fall
To where with all to grasp
Assets the world's tether ball
Arbitrator, sounds like a setup
Pius uncommon numerator, House Boy Conroy

Fetish for effort

Nobody's in Roswell

Nobody in the body bag

The comrade on the drum pad

Online sea of clever rhymes and punchlines
Viewed as his output slid on a decline
Pickup artist, throwin' salt to the salt mine
Single minute spent is an utter waste of time
He knows better, an expert smart Alec
A swift quick of wit, nearly got his ass kicked
Unofficial House Boy, gigalo with a halo
In the same vain as a villain in terms of how they lay low
Grew up together, but became an apart
Follow Baseball together for a friendship kick start
Old time with blessing, more window dressing
More superlatives, more law arresting
