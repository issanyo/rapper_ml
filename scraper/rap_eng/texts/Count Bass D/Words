[Intro: MF Grimm]
OK, I’m ready.  Alright

[Hook: MF Grimm]
L-O-
-Y-S.  Lord, why do You
Love me?  I don’t even
Love me, doing things for-
-bidden, giving in to
Temptation, murdering Your
Creations, breaking bread with
Satan.  My soul feels so
Cold—I mean hot—it’s both at one
Time.  I’m dancing with the
Devil, music feels so
Evil, records stole from
Heaven, they say, “Don’t touch”
But I want them so much
All are instru-
-mental.  Therefore, all I
Had to do was sit and write the
Words

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Always loved me when I cursed You
Believed in me when I didn’t believe in You
Refused, You held me tight with arms when I died
Genuine frozen tears You cried
Holy water brought me back to life
Breath for life, the will to strive
That’s lies—only the strong survive
Ones stronger than me rest in their grave
Laid bricks down, the way they paved
Take it from here, but me You save
I’m a bad seed, Lord.  I didn’t behave
Not caring about life, didn’t even try
Sick of it all, just want to die
Request denied, You still get really
I expected more from the bullets that filled me
Ignorant, mad You didn’t kill me

[Hook: MF Grimm]
Lord, L-O-
-Y-S.  Lord, why do You
Love me?  I don’t even
Love me, doing things for-

Temptation, murdering Your
Creations, breaking bread with
Satan.  My soul feels so
Cold—I mean hot—it’s both at one
Time.  I’m dancing with the

Heaven, they say, “Don’t touch”
But I want them so much
All are instru-
-mental.  Therefore, all I
Had to do was sit and write the
Words

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Ears covered with sins.  Now stressed, I kill
Eyes open with my blood to spill
Pure hell watching my brother get slain
It pained.  On my face was his brains
Bloodstains.  You took him away, awareness stays.  I start
To bug out and pull them plugs out
Time goes on.  You blessed me, my friend
Resurrection.  I’ll walk the earth again
