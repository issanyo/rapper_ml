[Verse 1]

SP ain't did this shit
Count did this shit
Don't deserve me, Banana split my shit
I'm happy to see you
That's why it's in my pocket
Put a sock in it
I know you wanna slice my Adam's Apple
I peeped that he knew she was a three time felon
They can't elope but he can water her melons
In a conjugal visit, it's sweet, it's exquisite
2500 square feet got here with her with triple A feet
MPC didn't do this shit, Count made this beat
11:50, cypher complete, or off ten, huh
I rock pens, floppy frogs leap with Saki
Dwight good, and my brother Mark Builler
Last name Farrell
Much ration, Antigen, voxel have me dullage in Brixton
Robina soothes the Casio diction
He's friction with those who speak friction like myself, huh
He told the worlds, bodies girl got duntz
He only got slapped cause she was reachin' for her laced blunt
Pimpin' done sniffed the bag, she steal a pinch
And get a Ziploc of whoop ass
So don't get bodied by Jake
Blowin' up they Carter fast

Get by Jake I don't wanna go to no more wakes
Don't get bodied by Jake
Keep your motherfuckin' nose clean
