[Verse 1]

Man with the same intensity
Tapper 60, that's why my drum
Bang so dang hard, it ain't been broke
And new equipment won't fix it
I ain't knockin' what y'all doin' though
Can't host the show
Most the dough
Spoken 'fo, it easy though
Twisted not
Ain't no musician, that can't get got
DCF not DEFCON force either
Better than clean sneakers
Fill the chords in a six by nines, knowledge the bass
The twelves and ya fifteens, Count Bass D
And I count by three

[Hook]
Want it you got it

[Verse 2]

Now we gon' fight my way
Cause you ain't havin' no chest pains
Just that belly, beef with Dwight
Just that petty, after the show
Just that jetty
From back in the day, where the stunna' pushed the jetta (Huh)
Giorgio Brutinis and a Jess K sweater
Haters should of known better
Cool Ranch Dorito breath control

[Hook]
Want it you got it
