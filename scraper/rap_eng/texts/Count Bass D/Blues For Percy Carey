[Spoken]
I'm watching you, DOOM

[Hook]
And let 'em cough up blood like phlegm, it's grim

[Verse]
Peace to my synonyms, saying you never heard of him
All of the Ummah them, big up, big up
Kill up, re up, fast rhyme upstate
Beat your fate, equalize the death rate
He frustrates when you underestimate, three primates
Dough is the language, speak it or back from whence you came
Test tube baby, what have you sold for me lately
Jack be Janet, preferably Jenny, from the beginning
Three loves, three hearts, let's smoke together and wine all night
Rhyme not fight, love him not Dwight
Put a 57 on the snare
Catch up, retouch the "S" curl hair
Conk and Jerry, hot comb and rollers
Diaper bag, do rag, car seats and strollers
