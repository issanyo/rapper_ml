[Chorus x2]
Lil D spit game to you
Explain to you, what a young playa do
Here to talk about these Blackman Dreams
And how I'm tryna to live 'em out throughout my seed

[Verse]
And my seeds' seeds
You got none like hydro
The game is dog eat dog, like a cannibal
Hannibal Lecter, perfect the style
From the ville, where we shoot to kill, yeah
But I reflect the game, of a pimp
Bass D with the beat, make me walk my limp
Brush my goal on the bottom row
One tooth crooked and I still won't mo'
I want it all for show, wood grain dough
50 inch detentes put my spare on the roof
Drinkin' Wray & Nephew, that's over proof
You requestin' slow songs, at the DJ booth

[Chorus x2]
