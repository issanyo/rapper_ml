[Count Bass-D]
Praise god from whom all blessings flow
If mama dreamed the number
That we ain't poor no more
One if by land, two if by sea
Fell off the music business
Back to diggin' ditches
Big for my britches
Cured pig for these bitches
Write songs on my lunch break
I'm one of you
Hoochie ma
Don't support these yahoos

[Count Bass-D]
Welcome to this little EP right here
We gonna kick it off a little something like this
Straight out the bedroom
Straight out the homelessness
Know what I'm saying
Count Bass in the house
