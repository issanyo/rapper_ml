[Verse 1]
Lester Young was on the tip of his tongue
When he said, Dizzy Gillespie, played the trumpet
When I see a bass, I thump it, then I'm done wit it
I see a Grey Goose in the sky
You see Smirnoff Ice
I'm thrice as nice!
Black box through my beat box, I'm set for life
Rap music is beneath me
But any rapper who meets me never sees me
Cocky or stocky
No Rocky, just Balboa cause you slowa
And there's no hummers among us
No one can thug us says the 51st psalm
I'm not worried about that little light of yours
I'm just studyin' this little light of mines
You got ya mind where the sun don't shine
