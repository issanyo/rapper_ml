[Edan]
Out the dungeon of brain-pain I came
With the sell-a-lot plot from the megawatt mainframe
With a suit made of electricity
I ran through the Great Wall of China convincingly
That was after the world tour
When I traveled through gravel and battled matter at the Earth's core
I did the show on a fireball, a pioneer
Ran into the jungle and jetted wearing a lion's ear
I fought fear with the hammer Thor lent me
And tangled with the angel of death for four centuries
Put a name plate on the astroid belt
And I ran through the future with a android's help
Thats when civilians were made of metal
I received a coronation cause I had the last flower petal
My powers settled a clash between races
And put good people on the magazine faces
Substituted television scandals for elephants and pandas
Tell 'em it's the elegant commando
With a hand so big I punched a Sphynx in the nose
And the nose decomposed and so the story goes
I slaped a 40-o out of a young man's hand
And fed him lessons of life to formulate a plan
I wore the prime meridian as a wristband
And gave away my riches but I still remained a rich man
The quicksand I withstood for good
As I hopped a dragonfly to outer space and met Count Bass...
