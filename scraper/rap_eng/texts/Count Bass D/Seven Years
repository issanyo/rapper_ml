[Intro]
When the song hit ya know
Ya know what it mean for you and me
This is my big chance
This is what I’ve been waiting for ever since I come to town
Nothing can stop me now ya know
I don’t have to worry anymore
After this song hit for you and me

[Verse 1: Count Bass D]
One two, one two
My name is Count Bass D and we get down like this you understand me
This is how we do it
You gotta understand
You must

Yeah
Uhh
Yeah

First of all, thank you baby, for having our third seed
But it is scary for me, because I’m running low on money
I slave and strive to provide for the five of us
Even if that means you take the car and I ride the bus
You know the deal on this industry
These rappers out here swear up and down that they could beat me
But my crew is my flesh and blood
Not no corny street team running from a fair one
People tell me that deep music is on the comeback
Right now who can compete with all this ice talk and gun crap
I wrestle night and day about decisions I have made
I should have made better choices and avoided shame
But hindsight is a magnifying glass
I can analyze all day but it won’t change the past
Even still you support me like a superstar
I sport my wedding band in honor of how real you are
I need to stop advertising you to people though
Because I see them foul niggas dreaming about ya yo
But when I get my just due
We can make it
Committed for seven years baby and that’s my statement

[Verse 2: Count Bass D]
Pharoahe and Common got the light but we in the dark
On how to keep this thing together like we feel we ought
I told DOOM about the baby and he praised the blessing
While others scoff and say you have to don’t you learn your lesson
I don’t reply and try to say something fly
People wonder why even though it’s not their bi (business?)
It’s between me and u in front of everyone
The ones who offer help and the one who offers none
The ones who give us clothes the ones who turn their nose
The ones who are in favor the ones who are opposed

Dione Farris: Ix7, I gotta do it. Ix7, ooh ah

We built this family who cares who tries to change it
Committed for seven years baby and that’s my statement
