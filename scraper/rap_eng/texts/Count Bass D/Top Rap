Ya'll should be ashamed, pac and big must be turnin in their graves
Talk about something relevant, no ones focused on the art of a record only sellin it
Wack rappers on radio no mc's credited, i get money i fuck bitches muthafucka then why you actin so feminine? quit lying your celebate
I'll make you sweat without a molly, scream at your ass without bein on maury,and there's no way you can stop me
Top rap knockin on your eardrum like a jehova's witness so listen
The lyrical content must be put in context
The onslaught was brought on spot to catch you off guard, on guard who has the mightier pen
Who can flip word slip slurs in herds that you heard
The sentences coming in stampedes but the rap games only knee deep
Its ok he sees cuz his lyrics are the feces, he's mackin the rest are pc's
W.i.t kickin raps like bruce lee
It's ok you'll see, firsthand respect you gotta earn man
These so called rappers can not fit in my caliber
98 to infinity i wish the best of luck to my enemies
It'll be a cold day in hell if i stop doing what i do so well
Forever i remain the games apprentice the greats remain respected the new ones on their toes tested

Hook x2
You can't take chances when it comes to rappin or your the games bastard, one way or the other your gonna be fully blasted, so quit actin
