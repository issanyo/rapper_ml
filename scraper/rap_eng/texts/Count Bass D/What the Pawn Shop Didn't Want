Love me tender
Love me chill
Complete surrender of her own sweet will
In an artist rendering
A self taught skill
Return to sender
The bullet shot to kill
Shit ain't goin' nowhere
His life is a treadmill
Vinyl seems dead although niggas be askin' still
She wanted Chocolate for Valentines Day, close
He gave her a drill
Good thing Jill on the pill Jack
Hold this till' I come back
Only be a minute
Check the time
I'm a poet, and I show it and always kill it
Organic intellectual
Beyond rederick, religion and ritual
In it for the royalties and the residuals
The boil of the parable
Your dreams are insurmountable
Reality bites, wake up, you're not better than Dwight
I don't even see why you sittin' over there tryna front
All you got left, is what the pawn shop didn't want
