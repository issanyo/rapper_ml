[Verse 1]

It's all trash talk
He glad that the force in the flex
His rhymes in one hand, gross beats in the next
Then he spit
I heard somebody say everything things been said
It ain't just been said by everybody
Take the Mickey out of rap, it sound a hot mess..
Juxtapose, the empress new nose
Martin Luther King ain't had to drive through no number 2
Don't discriminate cause she works at Mickey Ds
Free from the scene if the bread back was on a grilled cheese
Trippin' off the Brasilian Landin' Strip

[Verse 2]

Tell Vicky, not to snitch on a hickey
Keep a secret for once
The check come for lunch, we all get duntz
Now that's what I call lyrics
Volume six dip flipped to a knockout after peepin' in Pirate Tips
This time like the whiners, to a bitch
She took my weakness for kindness
My vices for niceness
It's like zoroastrianism
Shut up bit my bones, if he don't speakin' then he won't feel ya
Now step outside you ain't tryna get filled
Resurrect the god of chivalry yet
He the type the beef when rejected on a night cap

[Verse 3]

Pound of prevention, bushel of cure
He puzzled while she sensitive in mad demure
She got the right to choose, 'cept to choose
To walk the streets full of hot air
Auto blustery her ears have lust for me
She read like a willow
Activate it one day, or smell like my pillow
Catch boo get with night crawl in a minnow
Typical political path to president...
Huh
Should of called them, they beats is three stacks less
Who knows?
Maybe they do shows for checks with 2 zeros
The honorable MF DOOM teaches us this is a no-no
Another bad bad creation
With Dallas saucer, then vro-vro
A musician with more work than mojo
I'm risin' like Andre 3000
The flames of this mansion location Saskatchewan
Huh, Count Bass bitch
