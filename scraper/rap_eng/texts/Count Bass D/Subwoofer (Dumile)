[Intro]
All anyone seems to know about when it comes to Africa is Tarzan
Well why should I know anything about Africa?
Well now why do you give money at church for the missionary work?
Oh that's to help save folks
They need saving from heathenism
That's right
I'm afraid they need more salvation from the foreigners on their land

[Verse 1]
Tap the MP with Kush in the Snugli
I'm trying to make my mark y'all drink bubbly
Your idol, the highest title, no-one above me
You love me, I'm never scared
Like Dunlevy
The glue of the peace treaty
I'm not a (cock-a-roach)
So I'm deaded after World War III
For God so loved rap he gave his only posse
Desmond Tutu, another ghetto homily
Pardon me, honour me, call him Lord
Beware of the noose I design out this mic cord
Behold the Man of Steel, not a cyborg
Step side to side like Bj√∂rn Borg
Forty acres and a mule give me my rhyme back land
Took more speedy pinkies than Pac-Man
You lack the minerals and vitamins
Dexedrine, Ativan, Ritalin, you must be kidding
It ain't no value in Valium

[Hook]
I'm not Doom's brother but I rock your subwoofer
That's why they call me Count Bass
(Repeat X3)
I'm not Doom's brother

[Verse 2]
Black rock & roll, I mean Rock & Ron
Super Jay, Jock Box, and Shockin' Shawn
Fat Boys, Crazy Noise, Connecticut
Dooley O's the subject, Chris C's the predicate
Monie Love I used to love your Cockney accent
I'm still wondering where the Funkytown Pros went
Spindarella's not a fella, she's delicate
Timothy McVeigh got iced on Grimm's birthday
Grim Reaper for real, cook up your canned tuna
You think they'll ever get Cee Lo down in Tunica?
Unabomber, Jeffrey Dahmer, Joey Farmer, Dalai Lama
We the victorious O. N. E. S
God bless Ellisdale and Letchdale Projects

[Hook]
