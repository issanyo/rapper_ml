[Verse: 1]

My spot is full blown
Count Bass musical placement woofers is not included
Musicians only
Rappers bore me
Producers owe me
Beat makers annoy me
Jury still out bout the best spitter behind the boards
Please believe that I'm the rapper with the most chords
Casio CZ-101 head honcho
Started rainin' chords so I took off my poncho
Don't sleep on the beats though
Feel the kicks homie, Shock G told me
Be careful what you wish for
Inhibitions is piss poor

Oh no, ryan head to Stockholm
Alchemy on the balcony
Mutiny on the Bounty
Beats fresh and daily made
Tims light grey and suede
Equinox, forward, tailor made
We just say, oh no like yo knowin'
Stones Throw is in a show flow low dough
My peeps don't allow me, to perform for free
They say "yes sir" but they still ain't seein' me
P-h-a-r-c-y-d-e, J-S-w-i-f-t
Hold ya head baby paw and get ya money
"Til they face these fears in these fear Zones"
