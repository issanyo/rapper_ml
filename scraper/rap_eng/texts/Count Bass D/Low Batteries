[Verse 1]

Yeah
Bobby Brown, playa of the century
Teddy Riley is the king of R&B
Count Bass D
I run this shit too
Ten speed brown shoe
Old school duck food
I'm better than you, your crew
Ya whole fuckin' city
VS-1680, S3000
MPC-60, 2000
Your ears get aroused, when
Count Bass cuttin'
Count Bass rhymin'
Count is leanin'
Count is drinkin'
I will not take bath, still stinkin'
I bet show be still ill
Brola Bob, get stones stort still will
Giovanna spinners are not on my grah-am
Still push this thing with ant-am
Count Bass nigga
Fuck every last one of y'all niggas
You motherfuckers cannot fuck with me
Know that
30 years old
