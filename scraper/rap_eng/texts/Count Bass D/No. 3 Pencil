[Verse 1]

No. 3 Pencil
Show got canceled
Lime green red wine, De-stress the damsel
Scrape trees with the hand bill
Oh you stay in Bridgeport, how far is that from Danville?
It's very far from Nashville. Hatfieldâ€“McCoy
Call me Conroy, convoy alloy
Wheels and deals and steels
Is all for sale, gat connect
Wet wall contest, no vest, come on in it's open

[Verse 2]

Again
No. 3 Pencil
Protein for the mental
Dear prudence from credentials
Count mouth need nuff' dental
The bear Babs yental
Oscar get it, thought so
Rent it, get it, thought slow
Thanks dro, hey ho
I know dolo, we all know hoes need dough
I ain't got it, you got what it takes though
Use your loaf, protect me from these snakes yo
Steady pace Adagio with Dante not overcooked pasta
Drink lots of Koo-laid various lean specials
Soak my body in dental, I'm a ill tea kettle
When I get steamed up, somethin' might pop
