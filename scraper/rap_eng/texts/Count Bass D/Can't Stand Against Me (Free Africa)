[Hook: Nkruma Ochieng]
I can stand by myself and still overstand
Most these dues can't get their thoughts right
Most of the boys still cannot MC
Most of the dudes that I see
Can't stand against me
(x2)

[Verse 1: Nkruma Ochieng]
Truth indeed I'm not passive
Got the point, learned a lesson
I'm crying to them through my love of music
See just why I do it
Clear voice without the no-dos
Never slept on, you get the picture?
Record labels trying to kill me
I'm still living
Where was your support
I don't need help
No relief like that girl Katrina
Just a victim of the crescent city
I'm always at work, so unusual
I'm always at work, even out in Brooklyn
Walking down Fulton
Most boys still can't MC
Only a few will learn
Others have yet to see
Life is too busy so Marcellus had to leave
Infinito 2017 in a professional setting
Hey yo you get a keyboard, some sounds and a beat
Classic sounds from the other side of a digital iTunes
Pay faster, used for record labels
Now we all independent
But we not all brilliant

[Hook: Nkruma Ochieng]
I can stand by myself and still overstand
Most these dues can't get their thoughts right
Most of the boys still cannot MC
Most of the dudes that I see
Can't stand against me
(x2)

[Verse 2: Nkruma Ocheing]
So make moves, stay connected
I perfected what I said
Dead City stalker
Lovelace misled, Mr. Ed Said
"Where's the feed?"
I need money not dope
(?) yeast she's infected
Chemical inbalance
Kinda fishy, need cleaning
Or a shot for the twat
UTI, passing germs
Nasty brothers or scorpio (?)
(?)
Peace to UPS
High Definition '84
In my world
1975 write what I say
Still stay alive, live lyrics living
Chilling, messing with time
I stayed away from drama
Comma and a dash, never kissed no grass
'Cause I don't smoke weed
Can't pass it or throw it
Chop it or slow it

[Verse 3: Count Bass D]
Most don't know it
(C'mon)
2017 Imma be 43
Going on 44 still giving it more and more
By two tickets when I'm out on tour
Don't have an office in Sin City
But the first names Dwight
With an SP and an MP60 on sight

[Hook: Nkruma Ochieng]
I can stand by myself and still overstand
Most these dues can't get their thoughts right
Most of the boys still cannot MC
Most of the dudes that I see
Can't stand against me

And Count Bass D on the beat
Yup
And Infinito from the street
Yeah

[Outro]
...64, Chicago also 64
Um, cool spot recently
Right now checking in at 59 it looks like
So here's another look at future casts
This one shows you again tomorrow night
By eleven o'clock
