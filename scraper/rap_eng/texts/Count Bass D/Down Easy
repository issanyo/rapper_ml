[Verse 1:Count Bass D]
Yo, why can't I move on?
Why can't I leave you alone?
Why can't you stop calling me on the phone?
Stop contacting me
Stop being concerned with me cause I love you
And I need you
But I know that we cannot be together
And I know that we should be apart
And I know it's not feasible with my situation right now
Yeah

Leave me alone, let me down easy
Leave me alone, let me down gently
Leave me alone, let me down easy
Tonight, and right now(right now)
Leave me alone, let me down easy
Leave me alone, let me down gently
Leave me alone, let me down easy
Tonight, Right now


[Verse 2: Count Bass D]
Why must you still like me and be friendly
When I can't reciprocate?
You're my Kate and I'm your Alley
You're my Cagney and I'm your Lacey
(huh) Baby baby
Right here, right now
I'm gon' show you how
How to walk out through the door
If you don't do it
You might get through it with a size 11
(Huh just forget the rest of that baby)

Let me down easy lay me down gently
Lay me down easy, Tonight
Lay me down easy, lay me down gently
Lay me down easy, thats right
Lay me down easy, lay me down gently
Lay me down easy, Tonight
Lay me down easy, lay me down gently
Lay me down easy

That was the intro, this is the outro

Hope you enjoyed that, ok? Thank you very much, goodnight
