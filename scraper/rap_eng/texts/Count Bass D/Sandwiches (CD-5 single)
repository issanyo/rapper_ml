On the contrar(y), she walks around lookin for the meat
Or, lett-uce pray, tomato cheese pickle
Mustard, ketchup, two black olives man
Mayonnaise your hands off of it
Punk, you understand?
I don't think so cause these freaks keep on bothering me
You don't know so cause these freaks keep on pestering me
Something's gotta boil up my bone they won't let me b-ah-be
Huh, yeah

But I don't want that, so I should go where LL stay, huh
To find that cutie with that nice fat booty
So I can do my duty, and she will smile like Tudy
From the Facts of Life that used to be on NBC
However recently you've got to catch the repeats G, uh
Back to the issue at hand understand I am a man
Who can burn you like a fryin pan, more dangerous than quicksand
Proud to be black, I'm a meal, not a snack
You want to put me on wax?  But that's why
