[Hook]

"Remember, that the niggas, like dope
Niggas, like dope
Remember, that the niggas, like dope
Niggas, like dope, niggas, like dope
Remember"

[Verse 1]

Dog eat dog
Cat blow cat
Rat race rat
Embrace fact
Real not act
Satanic contracts
Self determinational satellite train tracks

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Make love, and not war
To wife, and not whore
Lies of folklore
Negro spiritual heritage of black-face
Miller-Lite and gaum clean beach at the Jersey Shore

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Have sex, but don't fuck
Don't smoke, but eat pork
Eat beef and exercise, stay up late
Drink dope at five
Do you think he really drinks five alive
Some malities have melodies

[Hook]

[Verse 4]

59th psalm, petty beefs and qualms
Monsoon palms
Ban the lip balm
I need dough
I don't mind dough
I don't love dough
But I like it 'dough

[Hook]
