[Verse 1: Langston Thoreau]
Life was a cartoon, I studied that art too
Venomous penmenship, I mastered that thought too
I ought to unslot you, extra man, I caught you
Fake friends and break-ups, all the things I thought through
Pain and anguish over 'cane defeat
Act my waistline, not the size of my feet
Aim for the sun rather than broken streets
Smoking piece you might at times receive broken teeth

I am... Langston Thoreau

[Verse 2: Langston Thoreau]
Life was a video game, I tried to be Mario
She wouldn't be my princess, told her I was sorry though
Had to go away, Ken Cooper wanna harm me though
Now I'm silent snake, there's a war in the army yo
Didn't understand with this pen in my hand
Refresh the program, replace what? my stance
I am the future, for now I'm the present
At my waist side, can't count where I'm headed
