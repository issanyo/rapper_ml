Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me;
See, on the portals he's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home, come home;
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, O sinner, come home!

Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming
Coming for you and for me

Come home, come home;
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, O sinner, come home!
