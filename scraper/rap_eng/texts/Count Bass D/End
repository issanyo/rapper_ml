They ask me why I do it?
I do it for these people and these children
The Class of '08 Bulldogs in the building
And man I guess it's crazy for Mrs.Parker to see
A former student in her class just on MTV
Canton emcees shoutout to Count Bass D
Athens, Ohio man I was like the Hocking's Jay-Z
I done shared the stage with Ace Hood and Big KRIT
Met Currensy to that lil' high dude can spit
Just a little project kid from (Canton, Ohio)
Who was raised to keep God first and tap on survival
And never let these haters get the best of me
My uncle see his nephew passing Lyfe Click's Legacy
I'd die for this and man I'd cry for this
It hurts my heart when I see these rappers lie for this
I love the music but I sort of hate the business aspect
But I know the opportunities are endless
I pray that God takes me to places that I'd never envision
Cuz tapping every continent is simply the vision
In the meantime I know a couple dudes that rob
But criticize me for having two jobs
The grind is real I don't gotta rob or steal
I got a gift of words giving people something that they can feel
And this ain't the conclusion but it's far from the end
The Hometown Hero...until we meet again, JÃ©an P
