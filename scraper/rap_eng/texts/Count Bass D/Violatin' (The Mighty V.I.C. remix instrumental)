Chorus: DJ Premier sample
"You know how that go, stop doing that
You're violatin', straight up and down"

Uh, Count Bass, uh, yeah, check it
Spongebath 9-9-9, Egon

We just did like Jimmy Castor
Here's the brother who causes mad disastors
I make you see things where they supposed to go
For instance, I think it should be Fat Pun and Big Joe
Where were you when G Rap rocked "Stilleto?"
If you're over 19 you should know
But I bet you never ever heard of MC Marshon
Cause you're too busy banging all that garbage in your car
What? I declare I'm the best with vigor
But you still figure you can test the drums, bass, and keys (nigga)
You think you Guru cause your rep is growing bigger
But you can say I'm sort of the boss cause I'm a skinny black
Beat machine, rock they rhythm, giving quadruple bypasses
To my sampler in a 4/4 meter
And while you rhyming about your homes in the Hamptons
We down here, keep it live like Peter Frampton
Yeah Matt's mansion like Knott's Landing
I've been off four labels but I'm still standing
And there was never a doubt that when I landed
In 1991 I would turn the whole region out

Chorus x4

I got the rhythm like Jarobi, all y'all know me
It's the brother taking notes from Paul C's legacy
Here in Tenessee, I'm 25 years old, I'm a let the truth be told
And who am I? A Beenie Man, and you? A Beanie Baby
Why? Cause you got a child and a lady, but you can't feed 'em
But when they act up, you the first one to beat 'em, what?
I hate no one but I love only a few
Bobby McFerrin, Mervin Warren, and Mr. Say Who
Scientific to be specific
Cause him and Vic taught me how to make beats in 360 minutes
Y'all finished, we taking spinach
Cause I'm an A-sharp-seventh and youse an F-flat-diminished
I own a Grand Am, and you lease a Lex
But if you so damn rich then why you staying at your mom's rest?
