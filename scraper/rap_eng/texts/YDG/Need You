Don't know how you got so far away
Feelin' all the empty heart and pain
Cold mind and aching thoughts
They lead me to believe
I'll call you every night
But you won't hear me

'Cause you never cared
Feeling low on my own
Need you

I needed you to fall in love again
Say don't mind but I do
All alone but I'm bent not broken

I'm blanking out on everything we did
I miss you but not all the things you said
Distance isn't what we long for
So why do I keep falling under?
If you came back I think that l would die
'Cause you never cared
Feeling low on my own
(Are you ready?)
