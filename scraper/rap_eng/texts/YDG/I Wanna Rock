[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I’m really havin’ too much paper
I’m really havin’ too much flavor
Nigga Eating up my swag
I got enough Now and Later
I wanna Rock, I wanna Rock right now
I wanna Rock, I wanna Rock right now
I wanna Rock right now breaking’ a brick down on a table
I don’t wanna fuck yo bitch at home watching’ basic TV cable
She wanna rock, she wanna rock right now
She wanna rock, she wanna rock right now

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Droppin my top, ice my medallion my watch
Auntie and Uncle want a rock right now
But I’m busy breaking’ down my blocks
Know I got gambine jumpin’ out the pot
Rubber band dope boy knots
SS perri? could have bought a Yacht
I can’t get your bitch to stop, she wanna rock right now
I got good gas in the pot, FN come get your shot
Really do the most in the pot, wanna see a rock right now
Hundred percent dope I’m stretching that bitch out
Matte black Jaguar stretch that bitch out
Eatin up' swag got enough to hand out
Trappin’ in Margiela’s Alligator
Yo bitch can’t resist a Eighties baby
Longway
