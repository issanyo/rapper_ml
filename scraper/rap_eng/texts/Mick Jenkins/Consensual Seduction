[Intro]
Uh, uh
Say it out loud, uh
Say it out loud
Yeah
I need you to tell me what you want (What you want)

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
I can cut the tension in the room with a butter knife
I handle the heat like a oven mitt
I ain't got intentions beyond what you mention
What you want from me?
I can see little inclinations, look like invitations
More low-key with my natural nature
I will be all on that in like three seconds
Flat out patient, no, don't patronize me if I need clarity
I mean unspoken understandings are indeed rarities
I need you to (Say it out loud)
Then it's Marco Polo 'til I'm on your wave
Fingers stray, try to handle love, she say oh behave
I oblige, I don't do the Obi-Wan
Never have to force facts, the vibe in the room as thick as a short stack
Still I don't make a move until shorty endorse that
Only portions 'til she releasin' endorphins
I need you speakin' case I'm tweakin' and just seein' distortions
My breath start to shorten, I caution my courtin'
Your instruction important, just (Say it out loud)
We can do the wait if you can't more than whisper
I mean I'll be the yin to your yang (Uhh)
Think you can let me know that, shorty how you figure?
(Say it out loud)

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins]
(I need you to tell me what you want, what you want
Woman, uh)
I can cut the tension in the room with a butter knife
(Ooh, ah)
(Say it out loud!)
(Ooh, ah)

[Verse 2: Corinne Bailey Rae]
Listen as I issue as we come into this space
My voice is a sweet song and it leads you to the right place
If we flip the script we could make our own magic
Listen to me when you hear me say it now
(Say it out loud)
Sometimes I go on to say, "Stop"
And sometimes I go on to say, "No" (Yeah)
Sometimes I ain't gonna want to say it, "Don't stop"
Don't stop, don't stop
The love we make is in the moment
Changeable like the ocean
So if you can get the right notion
I got to say it out loud
(Loud, loud, loud, loud, loud)

[Outro]
Yeah, and it's hard, it's hard as fuck, my nigga 'cause we're built like that. We're built to judge niggas like off the rip, but I've definitely gotten more into a space of, of trying to be understanding first, you know what I'm saying? I know that if a lot of, if some of my shit, nigga, hit the web or TMZ with only half the story, the shit'll look crazy, you feel me? So, you know, it's just realizing that like, you're only ever getting pieces of, of the information, know what I'm saying? Pieces of the story, you're only ever getting pieces of the person and you judge a whole life off a moment, you feel me? And that shit just really kinda humbles you...
