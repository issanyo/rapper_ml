[Intro: Spoken]
The letter I would like to go into with you very briefly is the letter "C". It is one of my favorites. Oh, it's very underrated, in terms of letters, you know, very few people sit around and comment on the virtues of the letter "C". But it is the first letter in "Cash Money", it is the first letter in "constitution" and it is the last letter in "music"

[Chorus]
Oh, y'all niggas see me now?
Yeah, know you can smell what I'm cooking
I caught you looking, oh you see me now?
Y'all niggas fronting before, you stunted on flows
But you say you see me now?
You was stuck on division, you couldn't fuck with the vision
But you see me now
Aaah, you see me now

[Verse 1]
I caught 'em slipping, he capping on this water
No captain, the waves is crashing around him
He's Peter, screaming, "Come catch me"
The faith is lacking, he can't keep running the numbers
But all he's catching is cramps
He be with shooters, all my niggas got clamps
We clearly cultured, been collecting the stamps
Of different nations, my caution
In the wind with the smoke from all of my coughing
In Amsterdam, I drink coffee and dodge all the cancer clouds
On my campfire like teachings
Name a campaign more cohesive than truth
A culmination of lies, a compilation of proof
A combination of both is what creates all this confusion
Your captions don't save nobody
They castrating my body on camera
Credit Montreal, I been considering Canada
I can play chameleon, slip through customs in a pinch
I play Charmeleon on this flame I pitch
Don't act like ya'll niggas don't hate my shit

[Chorus]
Oh, y'all niggas see me now?
(Oh it's very underrated)
Yeah, know you can smell what I'm cooking
I caught you looking, oh you see me now?
Y'all niggas fronting before, you stunted on flows
But you say you see me now?
You was stuck on division, you couldn't fuck with the vision
But you see me now
Aaah, you see me now

[Verse 2]
I came to claim and
Contrary to an unpopular consensus
I have not conceded my position
Merely concentrated my condition
And no competition but myself
Convinced that constant prayer, faith, and conviction could
Cultivate any depiction of reality he sees fit
That's why I try to speak it cryptic
Copious amounts of knowledge
You know they do recon missions
Try to keep it low-key, I peep energies
Though something 'bout your chemistry concerns me
Counter-culture enemies lurking and I know they see me
I know they think I'm Stevie, I'm really Bartimaeus
All my jabs is Cassius Clay esque
I could hook a shark in this water
Where to start, where you at?

[Chorus]
Oh, y'all niggas see me now?
Yeah, know you can smell what I'm cooking
I caught you looking, oh you see me now?
Y'all niggas fronting before, you stunted on flows
But you say you see me now?
You was stuck on division, you couldn't fuck with the vision
But you see me now
Aaah, you see me now
