[Intro: Kanye West & (John Mayer)]
And on the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy, now
(Go) go, go, go, go, go, go

[Hook 1: Mick Jenkins x2]
What chu want to do right now, right now
Seen niggas get left tryna do the right thing
Seen niggas get left tryna do the sightseeing
Seen niggas get smoked for a fucking pipe dream
What chu want to do right now, right now

[Verse 1: Lexx Nova]
Fuck 12, no foreplay
I ain't seen my brother since the fourth grade
Pretty bitches want to fornicate
Cops killing us, Judge look away
Bullet fly, they don't need a [?]
My nigga die, I ain't been the same
We getting high just to numb the pain
You testify, you was never gang
Live a rude boy on the north side
12 lurking for a homicide
I ain't seen nothing, won't testify
Ain't switched up on my bank account
Went Hollywood, now they hatin now
Like Uzi Vert, money gettin longer
Got melanin working twice as hard, [?]
Fuck Donald Trump and Stacey Dash
We posted up on Moerlein ave
Where the crack heads meet the undergrads
[?]
And them young niggas jukin every store
And them drug dealers going world tours
Fuck a telescope, we the holy stone

[Hook 2: Geo]
All we hear is sirens
And all we see is violence

What chu want to do right now, right now

[Verse 2: Lexx Nova]
The system was never designed for us to make it so we had to take it
Now the pistol sit adjacent to the liquor and the chaser
Its quite amazing where we make it in a city full of hating, where the Angels cop from Satan and the halos getting taken by the cops preying on their innocence
Lack of diligence, we been working vigilant
Just another young black nigga living it, all I see is ignorance
But I just caught a jug
Imma ride for my niggas, get high with my niggas
Imma die for my niggas, Imma ride for my niggas
I'm black and I'm proud of that, you cannot handle that

[Hook 2: Geo & (Lexx Nova)]
All we hear is sirens (Black and I'm proud of that)
And all we see is violence (You cannot handle that)

[Interlude: Lexx Nova]
It's not a white black thing, it's an awareness thing
It's crazy how you have like outlets like CNN or USA today that create these narratives and hide the truth
And you've got the youth, Complex and ID that talk about what's really going on, It's all about love and awareness
We just gotta come together and just can't let this happen
