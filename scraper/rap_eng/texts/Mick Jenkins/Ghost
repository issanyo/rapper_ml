[Intro]
You never really see me out
Imma just go

[Hook]
You never really see me out (unless you see me out)
I be on the road
Or I be in the crib
When I'm not on the road I'm workin on my penmanship
N my relationship
I put in hard work
You cannot fake the shit, you never really see me out
Ghost...
Ghost...
Ghost...
You never see me

[Verse 1]
I dig my personal space
Put the flower in the paper, put the earth to my face
With my lady n we laid out for the girth of the day
It's worth it to say, I do this for a whole different purpose
It's kinda high-key I'm low-key
But to clarify I really just be more focused on me
You can verify these claims with anybody that know me
Singin' myy words nigga, i don't do karaoke
N define worth to me 'cause I want win the trophy
I been watchin' it closely
All that glitter just garnish n I'm more partial to parsley
N all the medals will tarnish
You played your hardest and they ate your heart out
I beg your pardon, I'm more Harden
I can't ride a bench about it even if they claim I'm pissed about it
Knew I had the eagle eye, couldn't remain pigeon 'bout it
Speakin' 'bout it even when - especially when my pigment doubted
They couldn't fuck with the vision, n now you see me in vintage frames
Percentage rose when the interest came
All the hate just fanned a bigger flame
I'm simply sayin', when I'm sane I go Super Saiyan
I supersede all them niggas that go with the grain
That's why you never see me in that lane

[Hook]
Yeah
You never really see me out (unless you see me out)
I be on the road
Or I be in the crib
When I'm not on the road I'm workin on my penmanship
N my relationship
I put in hard work
You cannot fake the shit, you never really see me out
Ghost...
Ghost...
Ghost...
You never see me

[Verse 2]
Back on my bullshit, you know I'm preachin', don't need a pulpit
Who be a culprit if we really talkin' stealin' flows?
I hate the fake, n my heart would break on a serial
Basis, but the real do my shit just like Cheerios
Hearin' more voices that try to influence choices I make
I'm out my shell but all I see is oysters
Phony kickin' it, they just imposters
Fish out of water, no I need that moisture
"He don't react to the heat like pasta
Too much backbone, check his posture
He dance with wolves, young Kevin Costner
And canoes through this water world"
With the logic of a Spock, if I retreat, I'm simply trynna prosper
What do diamonds do under pressure?
I feel the weight of landin' helicopters
Just to get up here n find out they read teleprompters
Fuck is conscious if you woke but you still in the bed?
A lot of y'all realities is only in your head
Then you bring that shit to me n you expect agreeance
I'm disagreeing with your take on all this shit instead

Now don't be trynna do the most
So I digress, I take it down, I fade to black, I get ghost...

[Hook]
You never really see me out (unless you see me out)
I be on the road

I put in hard work
You cannot fake the shit, you never really see me out
Ghost...
Ghost...
Ghost...
You never see me
