[Hook]
South side stepping
Bitch I'm repping where I lay my head, break my bread
Breeding love where hatred fled
Fuck with me famo

[Verse 1 Mick Jenkins]
63rd and Rose
We blew a joint like moo and oink them pigs
We all on your plate;
Tryna get a piece of your lettuce
You know they got a dread-head fetish
Watch me dip like axle slips on potholes
Peanut butters, I pop those
Step up the convo
Rolling up basil leaves and cilantro
Checking out condos
Lofty thoughts get awfully awkward
Reaching them living with low ends
Started with no ends
Keeping your conscience open
Keeping your content potent
Potpourri if your nostrils open
Come get a whiff of this coffee
Catch the salt if you wanna get saucy
You see the swank in the swing for the cream
You see the south side in all of its glory
You see the faith and the love for the dream
Free be the team
Full steam head with a full head of steam

[Hook]
South side stepping
Bitch I'm repping where I lay my head, break my bread
Breeding love where hatred fled
Fuck with me famo

[Verse 2 SolarFive]
Don't get it twisted
I twist it like digits throwing sets
So I paint a picture so vivid to get you wet up
Now wet up the scene with berettas and beams/
If I sketch up a sceme to get your neck cut and bleed
I will tech up the beams
Send your set up indeed
But my set up was clean so shut the fuck up and read
Feelings ain't feeling. We villians
They drilling. I'm hitting with venom
And spliffing the piff and I'm getting so lifted
And living with vengence these symptoms of sickness still live in existence
And all my niggas in prison
From the sixth tre to the low end
Where I hit haze, where they nine nigga
Where they Dig graves
The plot thickens
No caskets so the plot thickens
It's mind different. Devine nigga
Divide and try niggas
Arises my niggas it's . niggas
We ride and die with them

[Hook]
South side stepping
Bitch I'm repping where I lay my head, break my bread
Breeding love where hatred fled
Fuck with me famo
