[Intro: DeJuan Whaley]
We ain't make it but, I'm feeling like we made it
We ain't make it but, I'm feeling like we made it
We ain't make it but, I'm feeling like we made it
Underrated, I'm destined to be the greatest

[Hook: DeJuan Whaley (x4)]
Whatever goes up
Is gonna go down
What's being a king
Without having the crown

[Verse 1: DeJuan Whaley]
Labeled a rebel
Their prediction is me in a prison
Either that or rectangular prism
Opportunity was never given
Had to look and discover
Nobody believed in my dream
I tell you not even my mother
Digging for pennies I barely had any
Never envisioned I would have to suffer
Headed for bread and the butter
Spinach and lettuce, developing into a legend
Currency fetish, striking the beat with aggression
While using my tongue as a weapon
Curse and a blessing
Take it or leave it
Searching for reason
Why am I breathing
Am I living to die
Calling for God but hear no reply
Why everyday do the innocent die
Pray that I live in the sky
If I believe I fly
Sheep trapped in a system
Refuse to be a statistic
Unacceptable to play the victim
I'm a king & I'm searching for my kingdom
And a queen black beauty with an education
Top of the charts make reservations
All I wanna do is spread inspiration and motivation
For the people that need it most
Have a crowd full of fans screaming out my quotes
Remember when I used to put rhymes in my notes
Now the pope tell me that I'm bringing back the hope to the world!

[Hook : DeJuan Whaley 4x]
Whatever goes up
Is gonna go down
What's being a king
Without having the crown

[Bridge: DeJuan Whaley]
Determined to earn
What we deserve
Feeling like I'm K.D
Game winning shot
One second on the clock
Victory MCE
Determined to earn
What we deserve
Lyrically CP3
Unfinished business
Last shot assistance
No look pass from the free

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Don't give a fuck about the wave
I been in my own lane
Niggas be scared to act like a grown man
Code name kids next door but I been past that
See the trees and the truths
If the keef in the leaf you should've been past that
They put the ball in my court and didn't past back, nah
Kobe act like you know me
Everything's always so well though out
In the spur of the moment I act like Ginobli
Dunking I'm J Dilla donut hoping you smelling the coffee
Soft in the best part of waking up so
You strangers get to know the new danger
Most def I can shake it up I been drinking this water
Bet you can tell that the man still thirsty
Baton in hand running laps round the plan like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Mercy a nigga see a hearse everyday
Somebody got they eye on your purse everyday
No lacking
Gotta be proactive
If you really want your shit to bump, Listen
I ain't never did it for the vine but I tell you all the time that I do it for the free
Been with this shit since 09 tryna get you so high you can keep it low key
Quit sleeping on me, I keep it O.G
Never gave a damn about a motherfucking wave
Just a ripple in your little ass pond nigga I been in this water every motherfucking day

[Hook : DeJuan Whaley 4x]
Whatever goes up
Is gonna go down
What's being a king
Without having the crown

[Outro: DeJuan Whaley]
Water sipping on my jet feel
Double edged sword when you bleed real
Quarterback but your line isn't on the field
Solider alone on the battlefield
Never made a u-turn or chose to yield
All the doubt and fear wiped off of the windshield
Everybody wanna claim trill
But you faker than a $3 bill tell me how that feel
