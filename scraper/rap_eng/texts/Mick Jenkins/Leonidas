[Verse 1]

APA citations on this paper worthless
Roger Bonair told me I was a gifted writer
All you want is money whats the fucking purpose
She only feel the love when he deep inside her
Rolling basil leaves in the EZ Widers
Spit a couple bars to spark the joint I never need a lighter
Serving food for thought
Shit spicy I picked the peppers with Peter Piper
Peep the passion the puddings proof Im the people's writer
Black Panther
Know the man gone erase me
Whole country bankrupt Peter Francis Geraci all up in yo mentions nigga
They cutting your pensions nigga
Government pinching niggas
All this weight that you move how much is you benching nigga
Your second step wasn't confident what is you limping nigga?
Aw naw ya'll niggas getting way to excited
Not another Lin Bias
Whole time we just kick it nigga pen been on Leonidas

[Hook]

Nigga we like 300 swole
Cop some water and the trees brig like 300 hoes
Let the truth set you free nigga we comfortable
OnGaud nigga we comfortable

Nigga we like 300 swole
Grab a drink and the trees brig like 300 hoes
Let the truth set you free nigga we comfortable
Ask sab nigga we comfortable

[Bridge]

When you ride for yo niggas can't nobody tell you nothing right?

And when yo niggas ride for you can't nobody tell you nothing right?

And the be like
"You know you my mans one hundred grand if you ever see a mil I need a hundred grand."
Fam, you know you my mans one hundred grand if you get a half a mil you got a hundred grand
Damn

These the ones with stiff chins that'll stick wit me through the blows
And I pray for all my foes
Shout to FM Supreme
Tryna have ya'll free up in this nation that's my dream



[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Tell me who'd you think you was fucking with
Caught you niggas lacking now I'm in here
Coming at yo necks like chin hair
I do not mean to impose
But your vision is impaired if you can't see the impostors
Spit it heavenly over heads like thin pasta
Wit thin chakra they dread the thought like ten Rastas
Highly noted and I ain't never even been in opera
Just pen operas
Like Im fucking the fat lady
It's been over she been singing the track crazy
It's crack music. It's binge drinking
The water. Don't act stupid. I been the thinking like authors I write books
16 jabs might follow up with right hook
Fuck what you might look like
Dawn of the dead and you like Suge Knight wit the records
I be mike with the effort
Move the sheep cause hes
Liken to Shepard
As they try to entice us
Flows the tightest
Whole time we just kick it nigga pen been on Leonidas

[Hook]

Nigga we like 300 swole
Cop some water and the trees brig like 300 hoes
Let the truth set you free nigga we comfortable
OnGaud nigga we comfortable
Got my ginger ale
Nigga we like 300 swole
Grab a drink and the trees brig like 300 hoes
Let the truth set you free nigga we comfortable
Ask Sab[a] nigga we comfortable
Got my ginger ale
