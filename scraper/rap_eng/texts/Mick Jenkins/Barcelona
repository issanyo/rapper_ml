[Verse]
Look, straight up and down, I never did the crooked
They offered twenty, I'm worth more, I told my nigga, "Book it"
Praise God my position isn't make or break it
I just wanted to spend the weekend in Spain
I meant it nice, don't give a fuck about how niggas took it
Awkward stares, like what the fuck you lookin' at?
And that's all over the world
I'm no nigga with dreams of bustin' all over your girl
That's belittling, bigger schemes, we been scribblin', notice it's plural
Dividends tricklin' three ways due to the penmanship
I do shows in my leisure and all these sinks is residual
Pop out occasional for the sake of relationships
Sanitize after handshakes and treat the weed like it's Ritalin
Tryna give you a visual
Fuck all this censorship man, niggas too sensitive
If yo comfort ain't pivoting you ain't listenin' right
Granny praying for it, she say we ain't Christian-ing right
Even water can't save mixin' dark with the light
Corner the art with the business, no beauty mark, but my point is These niggas runnin' with scissors and headed straight for the plug
Mogul talkin' business movin' at the pace of a slug
Left a trail, had to bail, knew his heart wasn't in it
How you up, banger, then catch Parkinson's with it? I mean...
*sigh*
Lot of y'all hear that line and gon' know it well
I be on my show and prove, not my show-and-tell
Then the whole defense about it be so Colin Powell
*sigh*

[Outro]
I was speedin', had to slow it down
Off the fertilizer, nigga growin' now
I mean, enterprisin', been compartmentalizin' all my shit
A tornado flew around my room before you came, I straightened it
Right before yo eyes you see my stains, see me basically
Pickin' up the pieces
