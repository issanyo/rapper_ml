[Bridge]
Had a dollar and dream
Inside my pocket
Took a step to the left and start walkin
Talkin' like
"How am I gon' get home tonight?
I left my bus card, on the night stand
By the kitchen."

[Hook]
Samaritan, samaritan help me please
Samaritan, Samaritan be good to me
Samaritan, Samaritan be good to me

[Verse 1: Noname Gypsy]
I met a wise man on the corner of an island, in Thailand
A good man, he helped me with my finance
He told me my life span would span a lifetime of phone calls
And staplers and people to piss off
But I reminded him I barely could read
I graduated high school, happy I even got C's
Cause the D's and F's was lookin' hella grimey
Baby sister smilin' at me, just happy to come behind me
Don't ask me what I look like in the darkness
Sit still for too long, your own bones become cathartic
Got me feelin' like I'm tall, dumb, and ugly
Make a home on the stage where all of the people love me
"She's so lovely, rappin' about her broken
Wearin her false lashes and hopin she gettin chosen
You a female rapper. Don't rap about that shit
You 'sposed to be a bad bitch or at least a little confident."

Samaritan, Samaritan be good to me

[Verse 2: Noname]
Welcome to verse two
This where it gets sticky
The dollar I once had, had dream of a buck fifty
Even the money'll leave you for the money
Had the nerve to look at me and tell me, I was hella bummy

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
Hella funny comin' from a nigga with a homeless soul
See commercials how they out here sellin' broken dreams
Mild situations of escape, check the Oprah show
Couldn't fly out the hood with a boneless wing
Back porch planning my campaign
Twistin' some shit and sippin' some shit
That bubble like champagne
Noses in the air for that dank shit
Pinkies in the air for that Hilary Swank shit
Million dollars a deal, make em' tell em escape
That fact that he so chill about it, compel em' to hate
The women that I court like appelates compel him to think that
I only do it, bad, like Blanket's dad
That's Michael Jackson, you sleepin, but how you sleep on that?
When I'm takin' niggas higher, like it's tree on deck
And it's tree on deck. Canada Dry on the rocks, watch
The poetry started in coffee shops, I'm used to the grind
I could wait for the cream, it's no sugar in that
Not even strings attached, Gepetto could pull him an act
Competitors ruling out, I compel them to pull the facts
My resum√© been faxed, ain't thinkin gold until I'm Goldman Sachs
Until a nigga records gettin' mad spins in your Cul-de-sac
Don't distract, though the key to this is preservation
I pray your prayers reaches elevation
Just see them snares as a symbol for the simple and it's sinful
Have a glass of ginger ale, It's a celebration
Word
