[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Now put your motherfucking hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
I'm just crushing niggas never been no player
Coz this ain't no game
Drive fast homie this ain't your lane
I'll take the less travelled
Put it over wax that's a blessed candle
Won't cross over for no blessed handles
Or distressed damsels
You get no credit when your checks cancelled
You disrespect and then I dismantle
I disagree but never this mental
It's smooth as butter when it's this gentle
You ask your mother to use this pencil
I'm on point, fam
Poised to snap like I'm trying to hit the joint, fam
We treat ops like pigs when they oink, fam
Y'all niggas bringing home the bacon? No stressing
Treating every day like a blessing
I hope you niggas awake, I hope you niggas awake

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
My heart says grind on the brakes
My mind say grind for the cake
I ain't talking ?? but that grass looks greener
??? but that ass looks meaner
I'm just a sinner
Youngin going through the woes
And I do it for the free, give a fuck about the gold
Fuck with me famo

Fuck with me
Give a fuck about the gold
Fuck with me famo
Fuck with me

[Verse 2: Lord of The Fly]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
Now put your motherfucking hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
I'm just crushing niggas never been no player
Coz this ain't no game
They call it dope, but this ain't cocaine
I call it fire, I can taste propane
Silver tongues was always meant for this
Add an OnGaud and it's bumpin like I pickled it
Tell em OnGaud like a pornstar
Got too many fucks to give a fuck if you can't get with it
Water gonna flow, nigga worry bout the mist of it
Sit you in a cell, and they cyclic, got niggas hooked
They never read, now these niggas booked
They know the creed, but these niggas crooks
Now the people shook
