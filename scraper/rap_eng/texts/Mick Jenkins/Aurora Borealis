[Intro]
Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there
...Uh
...Wooo

[Verse 1]
Talk proper, settled at the baritone
Got the Gilroy, tried to hit her with the pheromones (pheromones)
Like a phoenix, young dust out the ashes in a three quarter jacket
It was fleece, it was herringbone
Creep, plus she don't roll with the sheep, beep beep
I'm like "Ma, I got keys to the Jeep"
Got water for your chocolate, I got trees for the leaf
Got posies for your pockets when it all falls down, it's back to basics
I rolled a joint, she was stressing
White tee and some denim, she been distressing for weeks
It look better after she wash 'em suppose
I would give her this old, wrapped in all these instrumentals is intentions and goals
Purified through the water, glorified through the gold
Look through the glory hole and you can see that we fucked so suck it up
We spreading love, I could never give enough, give it up
Spreading love, I could never give enough, uh

[Hook]
Girl I had to let you know (had to let know)
Before you go, I see the glow (girl you got the glow)
You be the light (girl you got the glow)
You be the light
I just had to take the time (had to take the time)
Before you slide and leave my space
Stay on my mind, no! (You stay on my mind, running through my mind)
Girl I had to let you know
Before you go, I see the glow (had to let you know before I had to let you go)
You be the light
You be the light (girl you know you shining, girl you know, you know you glow)
I just had to take the time before you slide and leave my space
Stay on my mind, no! (No, no, no, no,no)

[Verse 2]
All the time like, 24/7 like, 365 like
Might go 9/11 when we fly low, all under the radar
Fully in command like the space next to the space-bar on a Macbook, I don't play y'all
Down like your baby mom supposed to
Then they come around, they'll never come close to postal
I done been around the world, same Tofu everywhere
Girl you more than rare
Appreciation for that fact, know there's no shortage here I...
I was looking at you, you...wondering when
We can make it a we, we...tell me if that ain't cool
I was just tryna see, see...I noticed your glow
And for me it was blinding I mean, I ain't icing out the Audemar or nothing but for me it was timing and that's...
And that's, all the time like, 24/7 like, 365 like
Might go 9/11 when we fly low (fly low, fly low, fly low)

[Bridge]
That's why I had, to let you know, oh, oh
That's why I had, to let you know

[Hook]
Girl I had to let you know (had to let know)

You be the light
I just had to take the time (had to take the time)
Before you slide and leave my space
Stay on my mind, no! (You stay on my mind, running through my mind)
Girl I had to let you know
Before you go, I see the glow (had to let you know before I had to let you go)
You be the light
You be the light (girl you know you shining, girl you know, you know you glow)
I just had to take the time before you slide and leave my space
Stay on my mind, no!
