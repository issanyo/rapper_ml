[Chorus]
Gold all in our skin
Water in our eyes
They say melanin is sin
I just can’t see why
‘Cause you love our style ‘cause you love our skin
‘Cause you love our food but there ain’t no love within
I got gold all in my skin
Water in my eyes

[Verse 1]
Don’t get complacent with me
Got my shorty on my side
She go places with me
Got my back
Even when she face to faces with me
Got this water she throw back a couple cases with me
Couple cases, won’t you take it back to basics with me
White rabbits everywhere yeah you know we in the matrix
Might need lasik if you can’t see
Feel like I met Banksy
The truth is in the pictures we be painting
And sometimes I’m distracted by your dainty love

[Chorus]
Gold all in our skin
Water in our eyes
They say melanin is in
I just can’t see why
‘Cause you love our style ‘cause you love our skin
‘Cause you love our food but there ain’t no love within
I got gold all in my skin
Water in my eyes

[Chorus]
