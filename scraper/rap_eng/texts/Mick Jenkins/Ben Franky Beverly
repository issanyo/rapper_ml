[Intro:]
Hot Crunchy Cheese Curls
Them shits used to be 4 for a dollar
Now it's 59 cents for a quarter bag, da fuck

[Hook:]
We in this bitch thuggin red cups nigga smoking heavenly
Grinding for these dimes and these Ben Franky Beverly's
Yellow cake bake now we fucking with the recipe
Grinding for these dimes and these Ben Franky Beverly's
Thuggin thuggin thuggin thuggin ho [x3]
My niggas [?] thuggin why you wanna be a gangster

[Verse 1:]
Sitting in the Cede heading to the party
Pif is getting all these roll it in the [?]
We like the Hardy Boys
Cone Stone flossing, looking for the cream
Cause we just wanna ball like Stone Cold Austin
You can hear the bread and bass boom the boys like it's [?]
We ain't even have an address, we just walked in
The livest, liquor was provided, add a little green and the legs get divided
Spit it like I'm chewing on some trident
They loved this, I felt like a thug in my own
I was just in just bust it
The same with, the game with
Water side rhymers
Cops tryna play me locking niggas up for grinders
But all that shit behind us, party hard as fuck
I'm tardy when I step up into the party
Probably parch as fuck
And cotton mouth, we tired as fuck, because we blowing garbage trucks

[Hook:]

[Verse 1:]
Gridning with the free, now we finally getting recognition
Niggas always wanna hate, but now these hoes down to listen
I remember days, we ain't have a pot to piss in
Now nobody in our lane, I'm guessing there is no competition
Took a broken jaw, and a couple of arrests to listen
NOw I'm paying P.O.s and everybody just pay attention
Never slowing up ho, FTMG in the building
Hop off out your feelings, cause don't know body give a fuck
Everybody got they problems you just need to shoulder up
That ho you brought was bold as fuck, and now she trying to roll with us
Never trip off stupid stuff, thats how these groups get broken up
Niggas see how much I smoke and now they wanna roll with us
Chilling with the realest, [?] probably soaked it up
And took it to they niggas
But they just can't do it as dope as us
Mad because they knocked on the same doors
But they ain't open up
Because what I said I'm in it
They can tell that its authentic
Free

[Outro:]
Thuggin!

Grinding for these dimes and these Ben Franky Beverly's
Yellow cake bake now we fucking with the recipe
Grinding for these dimes and these Ben Franky Beverly's
Thuggin thuggin thuggin thuggin ho [x3]
My nigga [?] thuggin why you wanna be a gangster
