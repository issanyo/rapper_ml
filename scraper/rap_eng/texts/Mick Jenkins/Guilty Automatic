[Verse: Mick Jenkins]
I ain't arguing 'bout who started this water shit
You way too young if you still think we authored this
Yeah you play too much, we only play the auspicious
Caution, it's people everywhere tryna steal the shine from dark pigment
It's pigs in blankets catching Parkinson's
When they see a Muhammed like me
When they see a young Malcolm like me
Talcum powder for the handshakes, even after hours
OG for the bouquet
Outside the club, palming trees and catching flowers
Sip the D'usse, up and up and down on a Tuesday
Side to side with the two step
James ballin' with the truce ayy
Go to war for my niggas, yeah
Young Toussaint L'Overture
Then I dip, smoke on that burr
Yeah I'm out there in comforture
French gettin' too clean, that make pigs mad
I'm just smoking my backwood while you screaming at me with the pig latin
And your gun drawn like

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
What you want from me fam?
I feel like I'm running from the police
What's with all the static, what's with all the static
Yeah, I feel like I'm running from the police
Guilty automatic, guilty
When they pull on beside me, I ain't even riding
Dirty but I'm worried like I got that thirty on me
Yeah, I feel like I'm running from the police
Guilty automatic, guilty automatic
Yeah, I feel like I'm running from the police
Guilty automatic, guilty
When they pull on beside me, I ain't even riding
Dirty but I'm worried like I got that thirty on me, yeah
