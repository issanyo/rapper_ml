[Chorus]
Rollin' up the tree
Ridin' with the Free
Prayin' for peace of mind, it's wild out in these streets
Don't wild out in these streets
They got you by the collar
I hope and pray you never fall in love with no dolla
Holla
If you niggas hear me
If you take the path we take, the feat it's gone be weary
If you prayin' ask for grace, I hope you hear him clearly
If you take a half a day
Repent for sins that past away
Yo' heart won't be no castaway
When judgement day is near-ey
Holla if you hear me
Holla, holla
Holla if you hear me
Holla Holla
Holla if you hear me, fool

[Verse 1]
5 deep when we roll out
Stale face is for the shook niggas
We Mobb Deep when we roll out
Bail cases on books, niggas
North Face cheap cause it's cold out
Tailgatin' we cook niggas
You'll never say that we sold out
Never say that we sold out
Got way too much on my mind
If you ain't 'bout shit and we talkin' you already wasting too much of my time
Bet you could taste the love in my rhyme
If it was me and you niggas could see all the bitches I bet you'd make a [?]
I double take a fucking rewind
The bubble tape will fuckin' stretch out
Look at my face, i'm fuckin' stressed out
Fuckin' impatient the medical patient, this blunt to my face, I poke my chest out
Won't get complacent, i'm focused in facing the music i'm paced to the best out
It's gone be niggas gettin' left out
It's gone be niggas leasin' less [?]
Just for a futile piece of that pie

[Chorus]
