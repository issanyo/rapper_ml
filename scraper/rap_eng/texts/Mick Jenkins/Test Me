[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Back porch parl√© with the squad n'em
We got all the smoke now
You don't want that problem
Truth that make you choke now
Miss me with the nonsense
They keep calling me conscious
I just use my conscience, constant
Reminder when I see her eye
I can't let the freedom stop
That darkness lit I bring the light
Like every lines a kilowatt
Kilogram, Cee Lo Green, see no star
Piling up, I'm wilin out
Surrounded by the wave
I'm on the island now
Isn't it ironic?
I got em hooked on phonics
And my momma used to think
It was just chronic, it was all bad
Now she see a G standing tall
Like the all caps is on
With the truth and tree
Fuck what y'all cats is on
I mean y'all cats is on bullshit

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
Yea, I'm the calm in confession to the preacher in the pulpit
Test me, I pray everyday that the lord bless me
Come test me, please test my patience, yeah
Test my patience
Test my patience

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins & CGB]
Either on your accord or it's coming from the lord..
Test my patience
Either on your accord or it's coming from the lord..
Test my patience
Either on your accord or it's coming from the lord..
Test my patience

[Verse 2: CGB]
Young mothafuckas on the scene
Whatchu thought it was?
Spittin' out this knowledge
But I never went to college, cuz
Never giving up until I move this product
And I get a lot of buzz, yeah I got a lot of boys
A lot of blunts.. A lot to stunt
I ain't doing that til I'm runnin front
Your girl, she runnin train
And I ain't out there totin' guns
I'm just tokin' tons, so me n Mick, we roll it up
All the finest shit, THC got me feelin fucked
3 Dutches and a Wood in this bitch
And it's lit, and I'm asking you what do you THINK?
Got the trees and the truth
Down it with the waters
Waves be surrounding us too
Stay grounded my dude, but I'm lifted
They probably notice that we rip shit, misfits
They probably notice that we run tings, it's business
I'm just lookin out for my family
You think I give a fuck 'bout the state of my sanity?
Test me

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
Yea, I'm the calm in confession to the preacher in the pulpit
Test me, I pray everyday that the lord bless me
Come test me, please test my patience, yeah
Test my patience

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins & CGB]
Either on your accord or it's coming from the lord..
Test my patience
Either on your accord or it's coming from the lord..
Test my patience
