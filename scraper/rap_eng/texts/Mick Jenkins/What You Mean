What do you mean?
Fuck is you saying?
Grindin and getting this [?] is the plan
Trynna do more for my niggas, my homies
The Free, Black Sheep and all of my mans
What do you mean?
Fuck is you saying?

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]

What do you mean I ain't on my grind?
Bet that she smile every time I walk by
Got no car outside, but I'm parked outside
I don't even smile back, I don't dot my I's
Cause I'm way too focused
And my prayers got so much hope in em
And this green is way too potent
Know some G's in 100
So I know a couple [?] in the low end
Trynna get a [?]
So I just keep it real
And my mind and my heart stay open
Got a blunt on the way
And just for the day
And some Henn in the cup and my potent
I know you been waitin, and hopin
For a young Chi guy like me
In the Tommy LT with a Arizona Tea
Throwback shorts and some pretty fly Nikes
And I'm free

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J Dot Rainey]

Fuck is you saying?
I mean for real
Nah nigga, I don't comprehend
I spend my days lost in the haze
And my cup stay laced just like my Js
Silly nigga, young jiggy nigga
Your girl all in my jeans like really nigga?
Me and Jenkins on the stinkin, every day
Yea we live it like the weekend
So I chief the re
Now niggas wanna speak to me
Since I flooded the streets with the sheepery
Too cold, I increase the heat
Future bright like Easter be
Hit the booth and I let loose
Even blind folk can see that I'm that dude
Rock star mind [?] tattoos
I [?] the bullshit at you

[Hook]

[Outro]

Grindin every day, every night
That's just how it be
Grindin every day, every night
That's just how it be
Let me get a second if you rep it for the Black Sheep
Let me get a second if you rep it for the Free
[?] (x2)
