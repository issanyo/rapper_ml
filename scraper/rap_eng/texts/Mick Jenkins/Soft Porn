[Intro]
Give it to me with the clothes off
You could even take the gold off
We don't need no trinkets, honest as Abe Lincoln
Why do it feel like I take it?
What's so hard about the naked truth?
I scream about it 'til I change it, oh
And still I wonder am I breaking through at all

[Chorus]
But hey, but hey we look good
(You look good, girl. Do you know you look good? I know I look good, nigga)
We a real nice black
(The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice)
Dark chocolate
Ain't no more sitting in the back
Ain't gotta front, I know what you want
I can meet you where you at
With the naked truth

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy
Talk dirty to me with it too
Give me how it takes
Give me proof
Give a chance to prove that a man improved
I'ma say I grew
They gon' say I pulled a switcharoo
But they is who?
All that jogging in place is cool
But that shit stayed in school for me partly because somebody was brutally honest
Pointed out social constructs I foolishly honored
I booted these false concepts that diluted these waters
Was trying to be true to the nigga I was claiming to be
Now I'm really real
Trying to get old like a philly shell
Don't nobody want no smoke with me, from spoken words to poetry
To polarizing social content posted I got more of the type
And it all took a sprite from advice
That one wouldn't considered nice
That's alright, it helped me take flight
I used to fall but the floor is so velvety
That we still had the Velveeta stacking nice
Rarely flexing or advertising
I ain't stressing too hard

[Chorus]
But hey, but hey we look good
(You look good, girl. Do you know you look good? I know I look good, nigga)
We a real nice black
(The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice)
Dark chocolate
Ain't no more sitting in the back
Ain't gotta front, I know what you want
I can meet you where you at
With the naked truth

[Verse 2]
I dare you to strip it down
It's plenty dollars out here to pay you to keep it on
You'll pop your collar as long as you go and play the role
I'm popping bottles of starch niggas know I can't fold
I hope your water is as smart as you claim to be online
They call you by your username offline
I usually pay no mind
I just cannot get used to niggas using that shit to define themselves
You'll lose me every time trying to align myself with real niggas
You confuse me every time you say you're feeling free
Can't see where my ceiling be
Think that's why those trapped in boxes can't see where I'm coming from
We just ain't there mentally
Expose myself to myself
What the fuck you running from fam?
We can feel your energy
The hate gon' always cost you sort of love, it's complementary
Wallet full of centuries, I still can't get that time back
Protect the pocket like a lineback
Where these niggas draw the line at?
Don't let me find out that they don't draw one at all
I spit the naked truth, I'm drawing it raw
I speak on it all, not peaking at all
No rallies in sight, I rally to fight

[Outro]
With the naked truth
