[Intro]

Find me, kiss me
Come here, search me
Learn me, kiss me
Come here, touch me

[Verse 1]

(The good Lord)
I just want to see her undress
He distraught at times it gets dark at times
But she shine in that sundress right now
Got a lot of marijuana around me
Can you see the path when the fog thick
Can't you see the cash is the cost
And you crash and there's no fear of bars
Till I'm forcing the truth
As a topic
Truth is I ain't ever been this clueless before
Got a lot of questions
And I ain't gonna pretend like I knew this before
Like what about when the money come
Cause I ain't ever felt like Judas before
Just a shooter with two pistols drawn
Got sin in my sights but I'm losing my form
Like surely his intentions are purely good
But he purely hood
He ain't ever had shit but he had that nine
Came through flicking and he had that shine in his eyes
And he dying to decide, riding with a dime at his side
And a dollar and a dream on his mind, and his pride to the side
Grinding, hoping one day he'll find what he lookin' past
When them champagne flutes just a looking glass
Shows start to book and you know that you cooking
You shook cause you feel like it's moving fast
Let it all slow down with a glass of the truth
Put it in the ground around the base of the tree
And you do it word of mouth nigga that's grass roots
It's pure

[Hook]

Backwash
I just keep texting the same old
Backspace
Never let the lyrics tango
Backboard
Niggas envy all the time
But you never see me back down
Through this water I'm a find

[Verse 2]

And find it I will
Fail I can not Iâ€™ve been finding my will
Is embracing the grace of God
Just a tortoise in the race but
It isn't that my pace is off
It's a slow grind
On tour you could watch the people's faces drop
When it's showtime
Wake up nigga tell them when I touch down
We ain't come from goal lines
These ain't just dope lines
We don't need no shine if you thought
Otherwise underlying shit's the cause
Love is the solution we should switch the costs
Free shit fuck around shift the charts
Produce section niggas better know
That we in that bitch with the biggest cart
Whole team a blessing but don't think
Kevin I got a much bigger heart

[Hook]
