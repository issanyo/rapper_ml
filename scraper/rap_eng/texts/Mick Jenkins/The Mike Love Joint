[Intro]
Be happy

[Chorus]
Turn the
Volume up on yo' factory ass system
These niggas claimin' they killas i've actually had victims, i've slaughtered
Call them trill but, they fathers think they had daughters
My mama think i'm an author
I'll prolly be a martyr

[Verse 1]
If I don't
Talk about cash
How all these hoes got all of that ass
Sippin' on that gin n' that juice and then party [?], you see [?] and them rollin' up grass
Livin' so fast
This under 200 up on my dash
Foot on the gas
Movin' so quick
All of my people gone think i'm the shit
What if I switch
What if I switched it on these niggas
Got a little different on these niggas
What if my drive was a little faster like a stick-shift on these niggas
They so twisted, oh these niggas
They just lie, so sadistic
Never simplistic
Out here dancin' for these crackers toss 'em a Triscuit
Then I switch it
Yo' people come up missin'
Coroner check ballistics
Ask me about a ad-lib, I told them I was gettin' lifted
AKA reading scripture
Know this world ain't no picnic
You trynna dipshit you wit' it, my nigga
Switch it, get with it my nigga
Raw papers twisted
The piff is spliffful, simplistic my nigga
That's how my life has been livin'
I mean get with it my nigga
Get with it my nigga
I hope you with it my nigga
If you can't hear it
Then

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'll prolly end up a martyr (x2)
It's the Pursuit of HappyNess
Fool
