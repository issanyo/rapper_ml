[Intro/Hook]
I don't know why we so restless
(Cause we ready for it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know that)
I don't know why we so restless

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Restless as shit
Cause, niggas, it's about time the Free is noticed
We as boulders, shit, niggas bringing locusts to bug you, we is Moses
Three-inch focus, act like you ever see a motherfucker just like me before
Dress just like me before, throw ball so dope, they be telling me I'm slingin' raw
Bring along, all your niggas
They ain't enough, call more niggas
If you can't handle the heat, then leave the heat, don't call us royal niggas
Damn, I've been coy with niggas
On the real though, I'm about to spoil niggas
I rap that food for thought, better grab you a plate then wrap it in foil, nigga
Why we so restless?
All these wack niggas at the top about to fall
They call it asbestos
And all these niggas who ain't never want to talk wanna hang
Just call it a necklace, of fake niggas
And you don't really want me to break niggas
Spit a sixteen, every bar hit like a fist
What's that, like eight niggas?

[Hook 2]
I don't know why we so restless
(Cause we ready for it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know that)
I don't know why we so restless
(Cause we ready for it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
I don't know why

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Restless as shit
Cause everybody wanna start listening
I'm cocky, watch me, spit it fresh, Listerine
Been trying to fill your shoes, my dawg, my foot is about to start blistering
Listen up, I gotta spot this flow, Mr. Clean
Turn it up, burn it up
We really just wanna see the roof go down
Weak niggas can't even speak my words, it'll leave jaws sore like a root canal
Motherfuckers such bad actors, they don't even know to act when the truth come out
Let the truth come out, and I'm gonna spit it, I'm gonna spit 'til the tooth come out
Why we so restless?
Like adrenaline has been injected
I'm reckless, you can hear it in my voice, inflection, don't test it
Bitch, life's a game of chess
And got my hands all her chest
It's amazing how these motherfuckers think I had denim
And I ain't even started on [?]

[Outro/ Hook 3]
I don't why we so restless
(Cause we ready for it)
I don't why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't why we so restless
(And you already know it)
I don't know why we so restless
(And you already know that)
I don't know why we so restless (x2)
(Free)
I don't why we so restless (x2)
(Ow)
I don't know why we so restless (x2)
(*Sighs*)
