[Hook: Queenn, King Caexar & CapGod]

Boy you changing I can tell you different
Me and you we use to be like best friends
I can't help how I been feeling lately, you betrayed me
You been acting shady

(Why you gotta be such a...?)

[Verse 1: King Caexar]
Desperate culprit, pundit on the pulpit
In public she tug it, then bust big like Anthony Bennet
Got muskets & blunderbuss pellets
Cantankerous fellas, deadly like roulette with Niko Bellic
Flow hard and long as what Mandingo's inherit
Koga directive, steam roll some niggas like ISIS in Paris
Hell yeah I said it, that wack shit condemn it
Ain't it pathetic, complain about taxes and credit
But still rock Designer, fairly odd, cognitive miser
Spreading pandemics, piss diuretics
Scrolling thru Reddit, for pics that's explicit
Empty his scrotum, after forum hits nigga
Captain Morgans the liquid, uh!
Only tense deep inside a crevice, uh!
Probe about like cavity dentist, uh!
Run her mouth thru unfortunate events like Lemony Snicket vomit, bulimics think I'm pushing the limits
Depleted after some minutes, beat it, the pussy afflicted
With spirits, speaking in tongues, impeded speeches dicklexic wave is buzzing like crickets, cicadas, Season is wicked
Verses stretch like pilates, niggas pay Hades a visit
Elp how I been feeling lately, you betrayed me
You been acting shady

[Hook: Queenn, King Caexar & CapGod]
Boy you changing I can tell you different
Me and you we use to be like best friends
I can't help how I been feeling lately, you betrayed me
You been acting shady
(Why you gotta be so...?)

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins & GP]
Back & forth and push & pulling
Dont break your portion...

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
I mean we always end up right here don't we?
How we got each other, still feel so lonely
It's not that this don't feel like homies
It's just that it's only on your terms or my terms
Or some compromise like it's my turn to be right
She claim with these frames I can't see right
See about as clear as the black
When it be light in the crack of the door
Back of her neck lowkey actually the shore
For this wave of emotion, crash on her shoulder
Like a slave to the potion, I maze through emotions
Tried with several brazen approaches
I think it's really just timing
Please don't ever think this just rhyming
Frankie Lymon was teenagers when this shit popped off
Then we tried to, crossover with, artificial intelligence
Didn't have the hot sauce, handles
I've been professing this fire on wax, lady I brought candles
Priceless our cess, then we progress to tangible thoughts
The dispense is dismantled, dont you see we dancing like

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins & GP]
Back & forth and push & pulling
Dont break your portion...
Back & forth and push & pulling
Dont break your portion...

[Verse 3: GP]
Come pick your poison
I mean I run it like I'm late for something
I mean you hate to love it, like my skin is hanging
Cause I been biting on a nail till the hide is peeling
I mean you always grilling me saying
"Nigga you stoned like an honour killing"
I never ask her how you feeling cause
You black and white like mulatto children
Shit that Rachel Dolezal wouldn't find appealing
And we don't even fuck unless I flash a Clinton
I mean it's simply astonishing
If you got a fuckin pussy you pop it
I mean you looking for problem
If you ain't fucking with a nigga with promise
Open your mouth and let me give you deposit
I know you holler for profit
I heard yo man wanna call up the triple k on his hooded
The new age African poacher, restricted arms on impalas
And she wanna bone and baller
And she got her own apartment
Now we fuckin on and off and she frequently beefing
Always alleging about some adultery
(Cause that pussy stay anonymous nigga!)
Now that's V for vendetta, She want Koga Klan sweater
She wanna be my catheter, She's a lap sitter
Eat her rice cabbage, Season to feed yo fix
The ring leader of the bonkey clique
To make a splash, so hold your nose or hold ur dick
The haunted child, the poltergeist, you poking fun
I'm posted like a hundred feet
To polka-dot on your forehead bitch

[Hook: Queenn, King Caexar & CapGod]

Boy you changing I can tell you different
Me and you we use to be like best friends
I can't help how I been feeling lately, you betrayed me
You been acting shady

(Why you gotta be such a...?)

[Verse 4: CapGod]
Beat me off til the sweat smells pungent
Bust now this bitch is redundant
Just another bitch that I'm done with
You don't wanna know what I've done with
This yellow bone I had fun with, I had to blow her jaw in
Tip toeing in my jawdins, she tip blowin cuz I'm hardened
Tipped her over, get started, I go raw, always no tautin
A gamble , cuz I go all-in , tummy full of CapGod soldiers
My bitches are never starving , alcohol is not a problem
I want healin just like Marvin, dilute it with some Dilaudid
Spike it with a vic, cuz I always treat her right
When we dancin in the garden
And this where ya vision go red, crowbar to a nigga head
Drive away on a moped, to the turnpike, switch to the dirt bike
Don't pay the toll like a Mohawk but I got dreads
Needle through the lanes, No thread
Dis how a nigga chase bread, dis how a nigga lose feds
Half the OGs here are dead, and dis what the prophecy said
Don't let the beast out the shed, don't take cap off his meds
Put the burner to a nigga head
And the blood in his veins turned to lead
If you really wanna live you gotta beg
When I'm dead, lay me down on a fucking flower bed
That said, you'd drown in the water where I tread
So just know, all you fuck niggas gonna get caught
You won't even hear the shot when ya lid pop

(Gunshot)

(Bang! Young nigga sipping on drank)
