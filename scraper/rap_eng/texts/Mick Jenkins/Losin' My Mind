[Intro: Kiesza]
You got me losin' my mind
You got me losin' my mind, yeah yeah
I'm just a fool for your kind, yeah
You got me losin' my mind, yeah yeah

[Interlude: Mick Jenkins]
Uh huh, uh huh
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind (It's for the children)
Mmm Losin' my mind, oh

[Verse 1: Kiesza]
All this talk of eternity
Why not start at one single night?
Yeah baby, I know love's a reality
But I'll test drive your body tonight, yeah yeah
All this heartache and fantasy
Only you have control of your heart, yeah yeah
But I admit when I'm next to you
I can feel myself fallin' apart

[Chorus: Kiesza & Mick Jenkins]
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
I'm just a fool for your kind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)

[Verse 2: Kiesza]
It's a beautiful misery
When you feel something too good to fight, yeah yeah
I know some things are meant to be
I guess we'll know when we turn off the lights, yeah yeah
All this fiction and fairytale
When we might as well cut to the chase, yeah yeah
I won't quit till you're touchin' me
And your sending my body to grace, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Kiesza & Mick Jenkins]
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
I'm just a fool for your kind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)

[Interlude: Mick Jenkins]
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind, oh
Mmm Losin' my mind, (yeah, yeah)
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind, oh

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
Drink more water
I never thought I would be here
Guess it's Dallas Texas to Lamar Odom
You play your cards and you never fold 'em, it's Texas Hold 'Em
I pray to God that he never say that I never know'd him
I took them hearts from extended hands but I never stole 'em
That's gotta be worth somethin'
Shake them fears lil' mama go and twerk somethin'
Nah, good music, incense and a candle
Join me for the joint and niggas intimately channel
She says she wasn't gon' do it, her intentions dismantled
I'm in that, be damned if I swim bad, I'm Sinbad
Check the flow, seven seas, worth the effort please
Don't get distracted (Yeah, yeah) by the usual selected keys

[Chorus: Kiesza & Mick Jenkins]
You got me losin' my mind (You got me losin' my mind), (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (yeah, that's right), (uh huh, uh huh)
I'm just a fool for your kind (yeah, yeah), (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (You got me losin' my mind), (uh huh, uh huh)

[Interlude: Kiesza & Mick Jenkins]
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind, oh
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind, (I'm losin' my mind)
Mmm Losin' my mind, oh
