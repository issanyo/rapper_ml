[Pre-Chorus]
I had a quarter in my pocket
Three day bus pass and some patience
Two-three bussdowns hit the house phone
While my momma sleep

[Chorus]
I promise, we was on this fly shit early
We was on the thrift shit early
We respected women early
Had to learn a few things

[Verse 1]
We was dodging bullets early
And I knew the law from early
And the strap was on me early
I was the first one with Girbauds
I was in class with all my foes
So I cut class like twice a week
But I knew Jesus since a youngin'
I was never on my own
I had the knowledge on me early
I knew violence from an early age
I knew dollars couldn't save me
Way more focused on the pearly gates
I pearl a blunt, we perforate
Y'all perpetrate, more purposeful
More personal
This ain’t for your purchasing
Momma popped the Prednisone
Stress was on our pressure points
Pandering to pantomimes
Fuck all the semantics
Me and my bottomline won't stand in line
I’ve been hip
Y’all been stiffs
And I’ve been peeped
And I’ve been dipped

[Pre-Chorus]
Unzip and smoke the quarter in my pocket
Three day bus pass and some patience
Two-three bussdowns hit the house phone
While my momma sleep

[Chorus]
I promise, we was on this fly shit early
We was on the thrift shit early
We respected women early
Had to learn a few things
The early bird gets the worm
These niggas still sleeping
The early bird gets the worm
These niggas still sleep

I promise, we was on that fly shit early
We was on the thrift shit early
We respected women early
Had to learn a few things
The early bird gets the worm

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2]
Been stuck in the basement like the fusebox
Getting it off my chest, so tube top
Like, I’m more tube sock
Coming after your achilles
You’ll eventually feel me
No more Heelies for you
Just back to the floor and ceilings for views
Got em feeling abused
Don't feature me on your record or I’m stealing a few
I write a feature presentation on your shit
With a matchstick you’ll get the award for best supporting actress
Withstanding heat i’ll hold that water like a cactus
Y’all niggas average
Tending burns in the mirror rubbing aloe vera online
You suberbad in real life
You Michael Cera, all that McLovin
All that dick hugging these niggas do
No kung, these niggas fu
Its pitiful, not Mr. T, we don’t pity fools
Just get at you
Bless your crew, turn many to few
Now what the fuck you really wanna do?
