[Verse 1: student 1]
My moniker is a mask
Tummy is queasy, stupid is easy, smart is a task
A task is work to be done, sir Afework is the one
The one is king of the matrix my legacy is begun
Be gone is what I tell you, only question is when
If all the drama is for women, beef is drama for men
Man is dummy and woman is crazy and both play kind
A cigarette's a fashion statement that'll battle your mind
The key to know is intel
State of my life is been well
The key to being heard is losing nerves to boot up and yell
My reply to getting props is "I see you can tell"
My reply to a label deal is "I'll see you in hell"
I swear a label is a scam and to rob me is not nice
And work is nonexistent when your hobby is a vice
Everyone is caught up
Freedom is unexercised
Money is a freedom unit
Life is generalized
And this fucking list is endless
Endless is my overthinking
Thinking is walking around, so don't get robbed or confused
Acid is lucy is a cigarette is cancer tar
Slang is fun, fun is lit, ugly's weird, xan's a bar
Is is is double triple sorry I dunno
That line is no gibberish
Gibberish is no to sense
Common sense is relative
Hating is relating
This is probably so confusing
Is deterrent no debating

On and on and on and on
The list goes on and on and on and on
Cause referencing is an excuse
An excuse is a scapegoat
A scapegoat's a shield your mistake is excused
On and on and on and on
The list goes on and on and on and on
I couldn't help but get to thinking that everything is like everything
Everything is everything your model is abused

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Black is white
Truth is lies
Old is young
We age to euthanize
Burn the sage
We aim to neutralize
Turn the page
And im claiming bruce lee
Im tryna be like the water they came to brutalize
Who supervise those that do the supervising?
Especially in television can't be utilized
They gon publicize lullabies
And then that ill-advising otherwise
Occupies any of the other guys that was gonna ride with you
Drop lines like flyfishing
Know im fishing
No we cannot build cause you fuck with MY vision
If i dont fuck with yours all i see is time missing
12 hours ahead and its not the time difference
Im different
And its so much more than my pigment
The real is probably closer to what they tell you it isn't
Shout to GLC, i took a look at the ism
Niggas been in light like a prism
Trying not to live life in a prison of routine
Stretching every dollar no stretched limousines
Deeper than the surface had to do the submarine
Quarantine
Couldn't deal with all the fake, had to separate
Watch the hate intake tryna elevate
Drop weight till im featherweight
