[Chorus]
Wake up thanking God (Ay)
Wake up thanking God
Wake up, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercys (Ay)

[Verse]
This a Game of Thrones all I see is Cerseis
I stay with the squad, still be smoking percys though
Have your weapon formed but that shit can't hurt me (Nah)
I stay in the sun, need my skin like Hershey's (Yeah)
Do everything well, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
I'm 'bout to run it up, monetize the controversy
Bitch you want cut with us?
Playing all the roles where the fuck is Eddie Murphy?
Niggas thirsty, you wasn't poppin' shit in person
Niggas Hercules on the internet
Ain't no bitch in me, come and search me
Slut it out, high fashion fam, I'm fly with my silhouette
Thousand thread count, soft-ass niggas prone to pillow talk
Neighbors think it's dope, dodging comments with these kilowatts
Six-figure quote off a motherfucking keynote presentation
That's a Ted talk, say less, let the bread talk

[Chorus]
Every day I wake up thanking God
Yeah, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercys (Ay)
Wake up thanking God
Ay, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercys
Every day I wake up thanking God
Yeah, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercys (Ay)
Wake up thanking God (Caught a blessing on these niggas)
Ay, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercys

[Outro]
On my knees, said a prayer caught a blessing on these niggas
Ay, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercy's
On my knees, said a prayer caught a blessing on these niggas
Count my blessings on these niggas, count my blessings
