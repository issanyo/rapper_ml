[Intro]
Spacedtime

[Hook: Mick Jenkins & Ebony]
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Will these niggas let me sip my ginger ale? You can tell that I’m parched
On point like a dart or a pen with the ball, don’t start, I can tell that you aren't
What you want, the gold and the hoes and the lights?
The cars and the clothes what a life
Do your stars get chose and your bars get low when you're dull as a fucking butter knife
Can’t cut shit, can’t touch this, it’s a masterpiece
When the pen attack the leaf
But it’s all in a stroke on some paintbrush shit, they've been shooting in the streets and I ain’t ducked yet
We still here, 79th and Phillips, hope you brought a Philips cause niggas like to drill here
Won’t cut it with a flathead, put it in your back if you lack with yo' sack or yo' flat red
Irritate the white skin, like a black-head, I just pray to God you don’t flatline
I just play the background, Spacetime on the board, you can check a nigga stat line
Smoke tree now, spit it with a black lip, had to take a little break like halftime
Felines want the green like catnip, I just want my shit bumping in your alpine

[Hook: Mick Jenkins & Ebony]
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins & Ebony]
Drink more water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
I couldn’t afford to get my girl into this open mic that I performed for
But somewhere in the world there’s a Riff Raff concert that people gon' swarm for
I never understand that shit
Put all the whack rappers in the band and disband that shit
Have everyone panicking
Like when Danica Patrick got good with the handling
Dismantling the plans of the industry management (ooh)
Think I might’ve said too much
Ain't we s'posed to still be slaves?
Nigga might’ve read too much
Saw the rape taking place in my face in the hood
On some Drake shit, a nigga might’ve cared too much, so I guess I’m in my feelings
Been so fucking focused on the flow that I didn’t even notice that I ain’t got no ceiling
Peeling back the truth of the matter like damn, why these niggas lie so much?
Healing rap, the truth to the matter is, I’m so ahead that I ain’t never had to try to front
Don’t try your luck, don’t taint the green, nice with the paper never had to buy a blunt
Exceed expectations like a pop fly when you tried to bunt
Field goal when you tried to punt
We kick it that hard, nigga
No limits to my masterpiece, I’m Master P with a motherfucking black card, nigga
And I ain’t never had to act hard, nigga
And I ain’t never had to act like

[Hook: Mick Jenkins & Ebony]
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins & Ebony]
Drink more water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold
