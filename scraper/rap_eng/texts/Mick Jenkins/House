[Hook]
I pray someday you'll, find what you need in this lifetime
I know the way, so hard to see through the pipeline
I pray someday you'll, find what you need in this lifetime
I know the way, so hard to see through the pipeline

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be (just)
Let it be, let it be (oh just let it be)
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
Ex the excess, keep the essence
Keep on stepping
Down the street from them greek picnics, we was nestling
Chocolate babies, incubating, box of blessings
Lethal weapon, tucked under mamaâ€™s arm since a prepubescent
If I was in it for the money, hell I done packed up for the evening
I'd have lasted bout a summer
Lord, I done held out for my season
I'd have missed what I had coming
I'd have pissed what I could stomach
I done palmed out my daddy's Bible
And sold grand daddy's people
But, I don't got no dollars today
But, I'm sure I can blessed you though
Leap of faith, from Z to A, pray for me
My efforts meet my hope
I just need change for the better
I just got drugs for the low
I just squeezed out of some trouble
Can't get drug into some more
You can tinker, check the starter
Carborator, switch to premium
Chopper pray up, chop your weave
But it don't work if you don't believe
Crack the water, drop your seed
Blessed when son called your daddy home
Can't no love cause you won't receive
Can't have nothing 'til you let it go

[Hook]
I pray someday, you'll find what you need in this lifetime
I know the way, so hard to see through the pipeline
I pray someday, I'm what you need in this lifetime
I know the way, so hard to see through the pipeline

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
They lied to me
Yeah, they told me I could fly
Yeah, straight up past the sky
Wasn't talking my pigment
Wasn't talking my partners
Wasn't talking my niggas
That truth as loud as nine choppas
Now its rich or die tryin'
Now we live in pine boxes
Aye, fuck that though, I'm still shining
Out the barrel, hoe, I'm still climbing, still slipping
Waitress hit me with the Mike Jones, I'm still tipping
She working seven days a week, lil mama still stripping
Still strapped, she still get me, how she live, no wheels spinning
No they won't call that legendary
That's why I could never do it so casually
Any moment I could be another casualty
In the Gucci store, they ask "Just browsing?"
I told the bitch purchasing actually
I take three laps 'round the store and get back to me
I might've calmed down by then
But maybe not, ya'll made me hot
Twelve hundred for the sweater, I'm in the mother fucking Marriot
Eating carry out, gang bang, maintain, corporate do the same thing
With the same they just carry that, so I just carry that
Three K for the 14K, low-key, never carry knots
Better know I got the rope though
Spread love by the beaucoup , recouped by the boat load
And the quotient is quotes that will give you close ups on the action

[Bridge]
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need

[Verse 3: Doctur Dot]
Sometimes, sometimes when the weather real shitty
And the wind shield wipers and the music on the same beat as I ride through the city
Peep the ghost of my nigga posted up on the same street that he died in the city
Made my mind go a mile a minute
Everyone in a million is a dime a dozen
Cryin' and puffin'
Kinda busting, now it's all or nothing
Tough decisions, nip it in the bud
Grew up in the city with all my cousins
Hard to find a nigga that's not my blood
We was thinking out the box so whatever
Now them hoes that was tryna dog us, tryna faux with us
Where was you when smoking at the parking lot, freestyling on the Marta bus
I got a brand new hand full of angels this year
Ain't no big deal, the game don't sit still
Even though Atlanta tough, make it happen
Even though I'm going at it with a passion
No sleep, but I fill up the mattress
Pull up on your bitch when she sick of your crab shit
She get dug out like batting practice
Fuck satisfaction, I really hope you get what you need

[Hook]
I pray someday you'll, find what you need in this lifetime
I know the way, so hard to see through the pipeline
I pray someday you'll, find what you need in this lifetime
I know the way, so hard to see through the pipeline

[Outro]
Get what you need
Get what you need
Get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
Get what you need
Get what you need
Get what you need
Get what you, get what you, get what you need
