[Intro: Michael Anthony]
Who could wish
Who could wish, wish wish and go away, oh
Dreaming is living
It's your world now
I am not flawless
I am not perfect
I sin in my soul
I cut through the surface
Repair, heal, and spread love
From deep within, work the path and the vision
Then you can see the fruits of living
And use your roots

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
You'd never expect it from him right?
Please don't confuse shade with the shadows from dim lights
I been bright
I been in spaces dark as midnight
My pen write on both
My insight on both is skin tight
In spite of the fact that I'm inside the hoax
All my niggas got a horcrux or two or four
We don't die, we multiply but you knew that already
Shift the culture, we do that already
If you don't give me credit for nothing but making kids in Chicago drink more water
I proved that already
I'm someone with influence who'll use that to better the youth
And that don't make me better than you
But as far as this rap shit goes
If Drake ain't holding down Quentin Miller why the fuck would I ever give any credit to you
We learning the business
We keep us some sage
We shit on these niggas then burn up some incense
Drop off the album and turn up the interest
Make 'em pay interest
Since they was so disinterested before
Like it wasn't this intricate
Or we didn't use instruments before
Check that insolence at the door
Or, it can get a lot more intimate than you expected
The underrated and often neglected
Are often expected to deal with it

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up (fucked up, fucked up, fucked up)
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
(God did not make me that way, God did not make me that way)

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
And as I was saying
The underrated and often neglected
Are often expected to deal with it
Like we in here off a meal ticket or something
The lack of respect is astounding
And I refuse to accept it
Niggas talking crazy
(I think y'all niggas got me fucked up)
And you not finna tell me that I'm crazy
Cause I choose to correct it
Rather than play unaffected
Check my demeanor
Still waters run deep as the love and the serve from Serena
Balls in my court and we serving subpoenas
Don't miss this jet ho
Don't miss this view
Straight truth, no tricks, no presto
It's drink more water, don't trip off petrol
Just sip the kool-aid
The same wrist that makes this whip the Pesto
Break bread with me
Better yet, bake bread with me
We be so worried bout how much we need the dough
We tend to forget the little things we need to know
Like how to knead the dough
If done properly it won't spread so thin when your people show
It happened to me, I peeped it though
Before I hit my peak, young Pistol Pete
I could thread the needle through three peep holes
I'm four iPhones and two pencils deep at this point
The cliffs don't seem so steep at this point
And all I see is wolves and sheep at this point
No Lil' Bo Peep

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up (fucked up, fucked up, fucked up)
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
(God did not make me that way, God did not make me that way)

[Bridge: Michael Anthony]
Who could wish
Who could wish, wish and go away, oh
Dreaming is living
It's your world now

[Outro]
Water[s] was just the introduction to the idea that there's this truth...niggas been missin', right? But I feel like people, don't know what that truth was. I wasn't very specific about what that was. So...in looking for how to be specific about what that is because there's so much that needs to be told to people, you understand what I'm saying. Uh, love came to me as a, as, what should be a focus because that's the focus of Jesus' message on Earth. You know what I'm saying and if that's what leads my life, which is my faith then it only makes sense to start there
