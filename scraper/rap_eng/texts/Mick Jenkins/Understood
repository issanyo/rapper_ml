[Chorus]
Ayy, pull up puffing on the indo
Chevy sitting up on the 'renzos
Ol' head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
Ol' head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like

[Verse 1]
Deep conversations 'bout language, which one you speak?
Lotta niggas claim bilingual, lie through they teeth
Try to talk money, it's on the tip of they tongue
You know the feeling when the words just outside your reach, yeah
Take a few steps in, you outside your territory
Make 'em lean back like Terror Squad when telling stories
Or even like you got the Ac' in ya
So many different vernacular
Perspective and points, went from selecting electives to collecting the coins
To rejecting investments to connecting with legends and stressing acceptance
To fuck it, I'll write with my left, I'm finessing this joint
With my right to bring the light, like a key on a kite
The rolling thunder make 'em pee on they self
I see the fire, I've been drinking Freon, I'm on the corner, feel like Deion
With these Cowboys, don't speak snake with these Malfoys
Though, no sweat on my towel boy flow
Brought the funk like an outhouse, the bumps like a bounce house
And spit like the beatbox that heat rock
The Pete Rock head nod

[Chorus]
Ayy, pull up puffing on the indo
Chevy sitting up on the 'renzos
Ol' head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
Ol' head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we say a lot to say a little
'Cause sometimes we say the most when we ain't really saying shit at all
Cottonmouth, I swear I spit it all
I spit it all on the paper, I'm twisting all of this paper
I'm spending all of this paper for retail therapy
Brim low, they still can tell it's me
They say they want the kid in Tel Aviv
Now what that tell the world? I know you smelling me
My fingers recently wrestled the evergreen
Been a hunnid proof, the message is ever clear
Speaking for the crew, I'm playing Miss Everdeen, peculiar
Yeah, I study Miss Peregrine, my pedigree
Duke Nukem, yo' you can Uber or just let it be
Falling outta harmony, be singing different melodies
Really ain't spoke the same language in a long time
Both like to claim it's only 'cause the different latitude
Long lines at shows got me distant with my attitude
A matador, I know you mad at me
I ain't even mad at you, not good with math...

[Chorus]
Ayy, pull up puffing on the indo
Chevy sitting up on the 'renzos
Ol' head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like 10-4, ay
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
10-4, 10-4, 10-4
Ol' head hit me with the head nod
Understood a nigga like
