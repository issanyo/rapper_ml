Champagne in my left hand
Water on the right while I'm in a Uber
I be thinking ’bout drunk dialing you
Right now while I'm in a Uber
I put a hundred in his hand
The I roll the windows down
Lit it in a Uber
Thinking I don't need a bitch
I am in a German whip
Pimping in a Uber

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Catch me in a Uber
On my way nigga twisting broccoli
With my shorty I’m no dog
But she pretty foxy
And she rock my high
Never dig the rough sea
Niggas taking shots
That's just paparazzi
Let 'em spray, let us pray
Man it's time to eat
I'm a Jew about my dollar
I'm a Nazi about the beef
Ain't no jewelry round my collar
For your soul these kinda greens don't come with pork
I found my spot
I’m Rosa Parks, I’m on this bus
I need a fork, this shit a buffet
I don't mean to be rude
But you know the after party really just a prelude
Making all of my intentions see through
Sensei sifu, shit that I can teach you
Water I can drink you like
I ain’t never had the stunter on me
Only talk about the things that I think you like
My nigga Dale Rock pimping hoes
I'm just thankful we don't think alike
I drink to that
I'm drinking...

[Verse 2: Reason]
Mara fuck it this shit is expensive
German engineering and Dutch watch on my left wrist
Taking every second I get a new hater’s message
They on the timeline, the wall, then they DMd it
But all of my fucks are still pending
You on the Twitter streets
I'm on the streets trending
Got two on the way, I'm within blessings
My angel looking fly
I think she needs fresh wings
Ghetto poet my shit is complex
But simple for the listeners
Live in the world of context
See what I mean, they call it conscience
I call it God how my mind plays with your heart strings
And let's be honest, this here is God sent
Just need the cheddar with chips and extra sauce in it
I'm bringing pieces of the man to the motherland
Find us at The Grand while I'm sipping Champagne
