[Intro: Mick Jenkins]
Do doo, do do do do do, doo...hmm

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
You was on my mind
You had crossed my mind (hol'up)
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, yeah
We could take our time, or, you can take your time
I mean, I know what I want

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Hella respect your disposition, you open my mind
It really makes me no difference if you don't open your legs
More interested in introspective conversation instead
Been ahead, of most niggas my age for quite some time now
Don't let me find out, that you crushin' on a nigga at all
I'm steppin' to you muthafucka, catcall
If ever in distress I'll peep yo' S.O.S like batcalls
No smoke in mirrors you ain't even gotta hit the backwood

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
You was on my mind
You had crossed my mind (hol'up)
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, at all, at all
Lady I ain't pressed for time
At all, at all, at all

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Cause I don't ever wanna be the one that rush you into something
Girl I got your back and I ain't into fronting so I'm pennin' something so you know that I ain't thinkin' with assumptions at all
Ain't known you long enough to go through withdrawals, but often I have to pause, I'm recollectin' your smile
I must confess I'm beguiled, enthralled, entranced
You fragrance is enchanting, I swoon and I dance
Such a sophisticate, damn
Yeah, you articulate style and we gon' be so meticulous, this shit might take a while
I mean this might take some time, I mean you might need some time
I mean- I mean I know what I want

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
You was on my mind
You had crossed my mind (hol'up)
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, yeah
We could take our time, or, you can take your time
I mean, I know what I want
You was on my mind
You had crossed my mind
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, at all, at all
Lady I ain't pressed for time
At all, at all, at all
(doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo)
(doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo, doo doo)

[Verse 3: GoldLink]
Who can stop me baby? You know that I'm the best
Ain't no no competition, so Linky collect the cheques
Remember when we were younger, we were so drunk in love
Still chasin' better bitches, and then I ain't get no fuck
But now dance with me naked, I make you feel less inferior
I'm just tryna rearrange and change your interior
So baby you know, you know that daddy he be feelin' ya
Your ribs in your heart, that's a good place to start and you know that I harness
Now take off your garments and don't be shy, I'll fuck you regardless
See all my partners know you got me buggin'
Fuck it, exalting me, you my shining star while singing Manhattan
Let's make it happen, you be the co, I'm the captain

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins]
Yeah, I say
Co-captains
We can fly the ship as slow as molasses, break through the breeze
We can head in any which direction you want

[Outro]
H- h- y- y- y- y- you can take your ti- time
Yo- time
I mean I know what I w- want, want
You- you had crossed my mi-
You- you had crossed my mind
Holla at me Jill
Lady
You- you- you- you- you-
I ain't pressed-
You- you had crossed my mind
Holla at me Jill
Lady
You- you- you- you- you-
I ain't pressed for time
