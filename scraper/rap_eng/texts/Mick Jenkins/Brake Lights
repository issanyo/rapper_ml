[Intro]
Had to gone and get on my south shit one time, cuz
Free
Fuck with it

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna live so fast, tell 'em slow it down
Heavy footed ass, on the gas, tell 'em slow it down
We gone blow it down, drop a ash
Better pick it up
Switch it up
Fuck with Free and listen, up
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Wake up
Talk to God, then bake up
Chest was kind of heavy, but he blessed me now this shit feel like some A-Cups
Calm down cause a nigga on his way up
On the grind, tell my mama don't wake up
I'm trynna focus on, my closest folks, cause it's niggas here wearin' make-up
And how i'm 'posed to know, if i'm focused on these bold hoes and they make-up
That rose mold when I wake up
Little rose gold in my Jacob
All the hoes know
I get so throwed, when i'm draped up and dripped out
That'll have my old girl tripped out
That'll have my whole shit fucked up
And we know this
But we always buy the dranks
And we always tell the hoes
And we always got one rolled
Fuck it, roll a couple mo'
Fo' my homies and they honeys
Living fast and smoking good let's get this money

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ginger-Ale in my Styrofoam cup, tuck and rollin' these Raws
I want happiness and that's happenin' but it's tough ignorin' these flaws
Fresh hands comfort these balls
And them dames come for these drawls
And I gotta main and I keep it plain, but it's tough ignorin' these cause
I be chillin' tho
With that [?] on my wrist
Nigga get popular and them squares jock like it's Damier on my dick
Ordered up Dominoes, they got 30 minutes, no automer on my wrist
Niggas playing dominoes, we just cold chillin', that's the ambiance of my clique
Niggas gone dominate with these old flows
And I prominate in these old clothes
I'm just waitin', dog, it take's patience, dog for this Provolone
And we know this
But we always buy the dranks
And we always tell the hoes
And we always got one rolled
Fuck it, roll a couple mo'

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Listen up, playin' ahead, dog
Or you dead, dog
Got no helmet and they comin' at yo' head, dog
