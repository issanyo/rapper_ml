[Verse 1: Jesse Boykins III]
It would be easier if you went back
Without the knowledge of, just time you wish you had
Or rather the hardest way to see just what you're made of
I'd rather you look me deep down in my eyes, sink into my life

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
This time around don't turn around
This time just know I'm free for you, you
This time we try to more than survive
It's better we fall until we (?)
Keep making love for life-life-life
Keep making love for life-life-life
Keep making love for life-life-life

[Verse 2: Jesse Boykins III]
I'm gonna regret this now the last thing on my mind
I'm tired of wasting everybody's precious time
I never knew love could feel so deeply how it feels now
I never quite understood the point and I'd die for you
When it's the only way out, when it's the only way out
When it's the only way out, when it's the only way out
When it's the only way out, when it's the only way out
When it's the only way out, when it's the only way out

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
This time around don't turn around
This time just know I'm free for you, you
This time we try to more than survive
It's better we fall until we (?)
Keep making love for life-life-life
Keep making love for life-life-life
Keep making love for life-life-life

[Bridge: Jesse Boykins III]
Oh-oh-oh
You ain't gotta go nowhere, where, where
Oh-oh-oh
You ain't gotta go nowhere, where, where
Oh-oh-oh
You ain't gotta go nowhere, where, where

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
Have one last dance with me
If I'm trippin', that's it, make no further plans with me
I ain't crippin', I didn't mean to make you bleed neither
Would suggest you wear your heart on your sleeve though
They rockin' fellas, these days you don't even need Ether
These days you can see how much we really need Jesus
Need the water, need the resin, I don't need reasons
Why I didn't call you as the topic of discussion when I call you
Divin' in the switch for you
I don't want to bore you with all this talk of H2O
But see it's three times boiled
Things ain't always what they seem
And if you seen Susan Boyle
Then you gotta hit it real when it's deep in the soil
[Outro: Jesse Boykins III]
This time around don't turn around
This time just know I'm free for you, you
