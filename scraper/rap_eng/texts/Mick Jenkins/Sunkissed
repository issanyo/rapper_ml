[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
(It's 18 hundred ways you can take the...)
It's 18 hundred ways
You can take the truth straight to the face
Better keep the pace
If you drinking this fam
Couple shots and that be it fam
Keep it thorough as a New York borough
Frankincense and myrrh, heaven sent these gifts
We legit fam, take a look at who you took from
Look at love

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins + theMIND]
You love my style
You love my skin
That melanin, that melanin
That melanin, that melanin

You love my style
You love my skin
That melanin, that melanin
That melanin, that melanin

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Y'all can't just front on us niggas no mo'
Police can't keep pulling these triggers
Won't go for that shit much longer
Good smoke, lungs stronger
Damn near breathing underwater
Damn near feeling just like Peter
Damn near walking on this shit until I falter
Joint rolling need a filter
But I don't spit it with a filter
Brita filtered or the truth is off kilter
I mean whose history's author?
You was never right if you read it right
Am I throwing shade, am I shedding light?
I've been catching vibes
Young Jerry Rice going deep...with it
See it clear through Fetty Wap left, I don't even gotta creep...with it
Monkey see, monkey do
Crabs in a barrel everybody sheep...with it
Thousand count sheet fitted everybody sleep with it
It's the system nigga we get it
They'll take the world
They'll break the world
Then look at us like (we...did it)

[Pre-Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
Y'all just can't front on us niggas no mo'
Police can't keep pulling these triggers
Won't go for that shit much longer
Good smoke, lungs stronger
Damn near breathing underwater
Damn near breathing underwater
Damn near breathing under...

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins + theMIND]
You love my style
You love my skin
That melanin, that melanin
That melanin, that melanin

You love my style
You love my skin
That melanin, that melanin
That melanin, that melanin

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins]
Smoking
This ain't Country Time
This ain't Minute Maid
This ain't lemonade
It ain't never that sweet
Heard you niggas out here smoking reggie
You can never match me
At the forefront of culture
How you tyrna drive it from the backseat?
More and more vultures coming at we
Racists motherfuckers ain't happy
Me and all my niggas in here banded up
Don't get it twisted fam, this ain't backstreet
Progressing everyday this ain't last week
You can't catch we
If we eliminated every black invention
Motherfuckers wouldn't last a week
Still move haphazardly
On behalf of we

[Pre-Chorus: Mick Jenkins & theMIND]
Y'all just can't front on us niggas no mo'
Police can't keep pulling these triggers
Won't go for that shit much longer
Good smoke, lungs stronger
Damn near breathing underwater
Damn near breathing underwater
Damn near breathing under...

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins + theMIND]
You love my style
You love my skin
That melanin, that melanin
That melanin, that melanin

You love my style
You love my skin
That melanin, that melanin
That melanin, that melanin

[Outro: Mick Jenkins]
This ain't Country Time
This ain't Minute Maid
This ain't lemonade
It ain't ever that sweet
