[Intro]
Its the pursuit of happiness
Free, peanut butter leather loafers fool
What you know about it

[Verse 1]
Peanut butter leather loafers
Ginger ale on coasters, never play your hand
Life is Texas hold 'em poker, life is sex and hoes and posing to these other niggas
We be lighting, vegetables on fire blowing smoke on to these other niggas campaigns
Got to keep it real to maintain
Food for your soul talking rice and peas and plantains
Food for the hoes, they gone buy weed and champagne
That ain't worth a damn thing

[Chorus]
Had to reassess who I impress to be the best
How am I supposed to be up next if we just all gone say the same thing
Walking in the same lane
Locked up in the same box, that sound like a chain gang
We can't all pick the same locks, that sound like a gang bang
This ain't  no fuckin' gang bang (x4)
This ain't no fuckin' gang...
Peanut butter leather loafers
Ginger-Ale on coasters, never play your hand
Life is Texas hold em' poker
Life is sex and hoes and posing to these other niggas

[Verse 2]
We be like them Eskimos on fire, so much fuckin' colder than them other niggas campaigns
You know I'm riding for the fam-lay
You know I'm riding if a nigga left with her
You know I'm pulling on the hand brake
You know I'm higher either rolling up and then you know I'm in the cut like Band-Aid
New world band days, got the whole world thinking pancakes but its not that sweet
Don't you ever let 'em drive back seat, when these boys band like the Backstreet
Nigga its gone be a fuckin' track meet, how we run ya'll round this damn thing
All these niggas want some damn fame

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We be lighting, vegetables on fire blowing smoke on to these other niggas campaigns
Got to keep it real to maintain
This ain't no fuckin' gang bang
This ain't no fuckin' game, fool
