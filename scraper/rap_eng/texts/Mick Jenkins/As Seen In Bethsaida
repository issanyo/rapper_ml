[Intro]
You think I can love you like God love us?

[Hook: TheMIND]
My eyes have never seen the sun
Guided by the light look how far we've come
Lost inside my mind I often wander (I often wander)
Don't quit your day job nigga

[Verse: Mick Jenkins]
And please don't lose the love
Niggas got heart, never use enough
I put mines on my sleeve, went sleeveless
Niggas say I'm nuts cause I'm bruising up
I'm just like didn't you see Jesus?
I mean I, never really seen him either
But I kinda try to follow in his footsteps
All this weight on my chest, get it off with some good reps
Some good prayer, good stress
Good kush, good sex
I mean all that good shit nigga
All that good shit y'all be talking bullshit
Even on the pulpit
I see so much hating
The love ain't even appreciated these days
Niggas depreciated the value
Heard God's whisper then lowered the volume
Then popped him a Valium
So why wouldn't they be sleeping on my flow
I'm from south side Chicago
I know the mental
The self hate is really just incidental
Exposure is instrumental
In shedding that skin
Almost like it come with black skin
In fact every nigga that's in my faction
Had to unlearn
His spit in our eyes
So we can see the light
Never had to worry about sunburn though

[Hook: TheMIND]
My eyes have never seen love sun (don't....don't go there!)
Guided by the light look how far we've come
Lost inside my mind I often wander (I often wander)
Don't quit your day job nigga

[Outro: Mick Jenkins]
Do it for the love
Please don't lose the love
Do it for the love, do it for the love
Please don't lose the love, please don't lose the love
Do it for the love, do it for the love
