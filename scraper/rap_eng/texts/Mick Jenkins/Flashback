[Verse 1: Via Rosa]
Slip-slip-slipping away
Memories, they escape from me
Faster then the eye can blink
And I'm lost with new beginnings
This is the ending of the present
While [?] for the past
Is this, is this your idea?
Is this your idea, of the past?

[Hook: Via Rosa]
Time, time is cold
Time it knows, no, no, no mercy
Time, time is brave and it takes life
And its gonna be a long way back from here
It's gonna be a long way back for me
It's gonna be a long way back from here

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Homies was cracking cars and I just wanted my summer to crack
This was back when Lil B was running the pack
Matter fact, it was me, DJ, Devin, and Slim
Cataracts couldn't see [?] backtrack
Matter fact we was we were [??]
Nigga been had that, nigga been off that
Nigga cop water them, get cash back
Then I get sauced on 'em
So you gotta excuse me madam
If there's something in my teeth it's probably cause I never flossed on 'em
I-I-I ain't never wanna get lost on 'em
Cause niggas take they mind and they hand it to 'em
Truth sounds so outlandish to 'em
I take a bow to the face then chase with a prayer
Lord, let me say the words that's in a panic [?]
Cause if you moving a hundred twenty miles
Twenty four hours, that shit gonna start to seem slow
Your eyes get adjusted to the blindness
And that shit get distorted even more
Start fucking with THC
Water won't cut it with no contact high
Drink up my nigga, drink up
Keep up my nigga, keep up
Cause it's gonna be a long way back for me
It's gonna be a long way back
It's gonna be a long way back from here

[Hook: Via Rosa]

[Verse 3: TheMIND]
Time won't let it [?] it away
[?] I don't wanna get [?] away
What do you say memory?
What the moon, [???], symphony
Where you in my dream?
[??]
[??], if only
Only memories last today
What do you say memory?
What does [?], [??], symphony
I-I-I, I play you in my dreams
But I see you in my life
That's the, that's the, only memory
