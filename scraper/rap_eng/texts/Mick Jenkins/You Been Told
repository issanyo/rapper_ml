[Intro: Mick Jenkins]
Free...

[Chorus: CiaraKai]
I don't know what you've been told
But I ain't like nobody else you ever met before
Who you think you dealin' with?

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
The different right from the start
Peg Cuff in my denim
Tuckin' in all my t-shirts, the loafers got pennies in 'em
Been reckless with plenty women
That know this hawk is McGill
Sir and Madam the collar, a pocket square just for thrills
Docker's a dollar bill
Ale of Ginger I sip it and Styrofoam just for trill
Gotta know he's to real
Gotta know just like dominoes all you niggas gone fall
For lookin' just like each other it's a comin' of mass appeal
Floral the Ralph Lauren
Straight from the year i'm born in
I strap up the saddle different cause all them horses be borin'
And all them sneakers be Jordan
But quality is what's missin', the moccasins stir-craft, the Abbington boots I've thrifted
If you talkin' bout clothes? I'll muthafuckin' embarrass you
Walkin' with a parachute
Sucka' for a pair of shoes
Mixin' different fabrics that yo' daddy wouldn't dare to do
And all this for the low-low tell me nigga, it ain't fair to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: CiaraKai]
Why you think you know me?
Listenin' to yo' homies
But I ain't like nobody else you ever met before
I'm on another level
Whether it's high or low (doesn't really matter)
Who you think you dealin' with?
I've been out here for a while
You mogs can't catch my style
I ain't nothin' like nobody else you ever met before
