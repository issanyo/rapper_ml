[Intro]
Ayy, pull up on me I've been down to ride
Since pull ups
My chin to the sky like pull ups, I've been workin', good luck
Eating punches from these biceps, they come with concepts
They come in bunches from the core, I've been doing crunches
They've been sleepin', I'ma make 'em sit up
We crunch the numbers, we was fed up, had to get that bread up
I gotta focus I've been givin' out so much of myself

[Chorus]
Fuck it
Tell the homies pull up on me, I've been down to ride
Since pull ups
My chin to the sky like pull ups, we ain't lookin' down
We ain't throwin' shade
Just pull up on me, I've been down to ride
We can smoke somethin'
We can drink, let you hold somethin'
Just pull up on me

[Verse 1]
I've learned to work in environments that really aren't conducive for work
Just because of the way that this shit work, I throw myself into it
And niggas is hit-stick hurt
And I'm supposed to be okay with that
'Round the world and made it back
And all I had was shit to fix when I got home
Lose real friends when I be in my zone
Me and SLLIMEs split a Xan when the flight too long
Burn the page if I write too long
We burn the sage if we fight too long
We ain't talked in weeks
You ain't answer my texts, I was overseas
Young nigga tryna stay live, you want the smoke a tre 5
And you already know we stay high
We just tryna find them De La Soul chops
Soul food, not
Cold cuts gonna hit you different when you hungry, get it?
And I need enough to split it

[Chorus]
Fuck it
Pull up on me I been down to ride, we can smoke somethin'
We can drink, let you hold somethin'
Just pull up on me
Just pull up on me, I been down to ride, since pull ups
My chin to the sky like pull ups
We ain't lookin' down, we ain't throwin' shade
Just pull up on me

[Verse 2]
I'll be up before the sun can rise
Some people wonder why
Biggest nigga here still hustle like he undersized
Head above the water, I will not be undermined
Underlyin' principles still the same, but I've changed
Don't get caught runnin' in place, you look deranged
Pins struggled to stay in frame, I switched the angle
Fell down on my knees for the cross, no twisted ankle
Twisted papers, passed the joint and heard a "Thank you"
Watched the vapors elevate with my prayers
Finger snaps celebrate the Roy Ayers
In the background, my homies back 'round
Branch back in the day, we smoke the whole pack now
Most them old dreams is bold facts now
We link and step over our old tracks now
And honestly, shit's kind of nice to remember
But I got them blocks for buildin', I'm not tryna play Jenga
Ain't no time to point fingers, 'less in direction of truth
You'll find this shit is connected to lies like suits and ties
Shit changed when everybody know that you that guy
Seen too many relationships get euthanized

[Chorus]
So fuck it
Just pull up on me, I've been down to ride
We could smoke somethin'
We could drink, let you hold somethin'
Just pull up on me
Just pull up on me, I've been down to ride, since pull ups
My chin to the sky like pull ups
We ain't lookin' down, we ain't throwin' shade

[Outro]
Just pull up on me, I'll be
Just pull up on me, I'll be
Just pull up on me, I'll be
Down to ride, bet you'll only hear this on the lowest key
Had the same niggas for the longest time, and the strongest kind
That's how you know it's me

[Outro]
Yo, yo man, yo man, damn man you said pull up, you said pull up! Yo man, you said pull up on you, man. Shit, I just wanna, man I just wanna hear that album, man, what's goin'... what's goin' on, man? Oh you was gonna pull up? Alright, alright, alright
