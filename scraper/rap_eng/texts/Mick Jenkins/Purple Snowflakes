Snowflakes
Pretty purple snowflakes
Purple snowflakes

[Verse 1]
My cousin used to cop a gram every couple hours
Watch him smoke
Watch him break it down
Watch him roll it up
Watch him light it then
Watch him toke
Inhale in the middle of his chest then ash then hold it there
He'd be high, penguin fly
I was just another polar bear
In there, trying to be the better man
In there, tripping off his second hand
Always thought he was the stupidest
But he made the shit look so lucrative
Like how you support your habit nigga
Money gone before it come your way
Middle of the Chi-town
Some of bitches outside
But he inside off them snowflakes
Crazy right? Bedroom getting kind of hazy
Like he had hazel eyes
But whenever it was red he played his shit smooth like baby wipes
And he made me like the process of it
Even tried to show me how to pearl a blunt
Was never really gonna smoke it though, oh no
I just want to learn how to roll it up
Yeah, roll up them...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Novice nigga, first time
My first pull, it was big as fuck
Tried to act like the shit didn't phase me
After a while I didn't give a fuck
Now I'm sparking a couple blunts a day
Quickly moved up the hierarchy
Rolling raws with that undertaking
You can't see my eyes hardly
Like how how you support your habit nigga
Money gone before it come your way
Middle of a Huntsville summer
And the only way to stay cool is to roll in snowflakes
Trainwreck, God's gift
Shouts to Stock for that
Why we ain't no brake lights
We got four O's
You gonna fly high in that Audi
Niggas getting rowdy turn that music up
Call a couple of your closest friends
Got a gram of that purple stuff
About half a fifth of that Amsterdam
Let them fall, let them fall
Snowflakes keep falling
And my music loud and we playing around
So my neighbours they keep calling
But we like fuck it though

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fuck it though, let them fall
Snowflakes never hit the ground
Neighbours call, music up
Loud as fuck and we playing around
Fuck it though, let them fall
Snowflakes never hit the ground
Never
