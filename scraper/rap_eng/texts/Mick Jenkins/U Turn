[Chorus]
Ayy, pistol whip
I'm not sendin' shots, I'm just bustin' heads
We in the whip
This my parkin' spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic whip
Pistol whip
I'm not sendin' shots, I'm just bustin' heads
Smoke out the whip
This my parkin' spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic shit

[Verse 1]
Pistol Pete when I got the rock and I'm passin' it
I'm passionate
Go Star Trek like Spock 'cause I'm logical
It's fallacies all up in your watch, all up in your shoes
The tragedy, a cacophony causin' casualties
I'm glad to be black as coffee bean, on my Master P
My Cardi B, see, I'm takin' off like the brace is off
Niggas grillin' like they all just got their fuckin' braces off
Talkin' love and they want test my patience? Oh
Fuck passive aggressive shit, this shit soundin' basic, oh
Talk that pain and pleasure shit, they want more abrasive, oh
My first name is Jason, oh
You don't want me Voorhees 'cause you sleepin' or ignoring Anybody in here snorin' better know you could get

[Chorus]
Pistol whip
I'm not sendin' shots, I'm just bustin' heads
We in the whip
This my parkin' spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic whip
Pistol whip
I'm not sendin' shots, I'm just bustin' heads
Smoke out the whip
This my parkin' spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic shit

[Verse 2]
I'm way too high for the hotbox
She wanna see the moon through the sunroof
Diamond on my right from the West side
South side niggas so uncouth, oh
I don't ever tell no untruths though
Niggas'll say that they feel you
They never fuck with the real you
I pull up on 'em in this Pony
Then they get to actin' phony
Please do not force my hand
My nigga, you know they we ain't really homies
I never knew you like that
Don't make me do you like that
Just bust a U-turn
'Fore we have to get down like a new perm
We'll straighten it out, just know that you could get

[Chorus]
Pistol whip
I'm not sendin' shots, I'm just bustin' heads
We in the whip
This my parkin' spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic whip
Pistol whip
I'm not sendin' shots, I'm just bustin' heads
Smoke out the whip
This my parkin' spot, I just bust a U
I just bust a U
In this classic shit
