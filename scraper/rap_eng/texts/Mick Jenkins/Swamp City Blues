{INCOMPLETE}
[Verse 1: MadeGROCERIES]
I'm from where instant flames get caught at, they say home is where the heart it
Young masters with the kush, the backwood hit you make it feel like a car crash
In the whip with the seat laid far back, hopped up, gotta feel the breeze through the sunroof
I'ma let my little light shine like the sun do, looking in the mirror like "Gahdamn, I love you!"
Create and save, don't be a slave, make sure your groceries made (fuck your wife)
Don't try to be something you ain't, that's like trying to unfry an egg
Out here with the land of the Lord, Kikkoman got the sauce, sincerely saving the day
Uh, peace in my mind where the vegetable be
Piffin', mixin' like he ???, kick it like Chun Li
Once the conceding see his conscious, it's accomplished as a moral compass

[Hook: MadeGROCERIES]
Spirits in the waters drowning

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Met a racist man the other day, I just pray God bless your soul
I just pray God bless your soul, I just pray God bless us all!
Mike had to get a couple sneezes off like, flashing lights that seize us off
I, stress you hold your tongue fam and keep your head up like a nose bleed
We ain't come for the nose bleeds, I need the same seats as Rosa P
They brought the mattresses out, no Coby G
I play the game like ODB, lowkey
I need the welfare cheque and a cheque for the show before I hit the stage
See, I'm getting sharp but I ain't switch the blades
Walking with the light, I still beat the shade though
Hot tea and lemonade though
Fuck Trump, vote Pedro
The Artful Dodger, reverse picking pockets
Penny for your thoughts, I'm dropping off a couple pesos
