[Intro: Michael Jordan]
He said I conned the players, I befriended them
And then I attacked them on the basketball court
Where did that come from
I just so happen to be a friendly guy
I get along with everybody, but at the same time
When the light comes on I'm just as competitive as anybody you know

[Verse: Mick Jenkins]
Pigeon holed
Not me, walk different like I'm pigeon-toed
Smooth footed, bow-legged long as niggas know
We not the same, give a fuck bout what you did before
You get the real me, twist your fingers if you figured you'd deal me
Don't show no ceilings, I don't need them either
I got the plumbing, you won't see Luigi
Keep a squeegee I can see me clearer
When I'm looking through a window than I can in a mirror
Putting the fear of god in a pen
Cabrini-Green thumbs deep in the garden
I'm watching for snakes, I'm watching for Jakes
Head in the clouds, my eyes were watching God
And all these niggas say I'm walking odd
Time travel when I slow creep out the parking lot
Murdered out
Trust me I ain't nobody you heard about
You niggas best believe I like to keep it that way
I know the fear spread quick and niggas sheep-ish that way
I'm peeping that daily, its crazy, its driving me crazy
I'm saying
