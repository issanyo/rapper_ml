[Intro: Jean Deaux]
They say there's gon' be a downpour
They say the water's gon' wash away my people
(You tell them, you tell them I'm coming, tell them then...)

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
We probably gon' need a boat
I'm thinking kindred to Titanic, like why panic
It all depend on who whipping that bitch
John Legend to slave master, punish a slave faster
It all depend on who whipping that bitch
She stripping, it all depend on who tipping that bitch
I bet it's no king of diamonds
She showed those niggas love, diamond in rough
That's a ten of clubs, they told her it was gon' rain
They told her "do those drugs" then she'll feel no pain
Nigga check the correlation, ideas realized by corporations
In communities where people are too poor for patience
Ooh, I know you hear that truth that I spit like a relaxed tooth
Cold turkied all the politics, I'm relapsed proof
Cold shouldered all the ops they probably cashews
If you can't see the tree, in truth, you probably think cash rules
I got no time for your living, writing pennies for the thought
Drop a dime for your living, look around nigga, we can see the signs are the limit
Section 8 'bout as low as the pigeons, we did it, too fly
My nigga too fly, our people dying I ain't kidding like our tubes tied

[Hook: Jean Deaux ]
They say there's gon' be a downpour
(They say there's gon' be a downpour)
They say the water's gon' wash away my people
(They say the water gon' wash us away, no)
Everybody gon' need a boat
(Everybody gon' need a boat)
They say there's gon' be a downpour
(They say there's gon' be a downpour)

[Verse 2: Jean Deaux]
I thought that it was simple, we treading water from my house
My body is a temple, he bows and prays that he makes it back to the shore
I feel my head flooding with thoughts, temples sore as shit
Tryna figure out how you got me open, preposterous oceans
Catch you floating on your merry boat there
My thighs is hurting, my soul is yearning, my feelings current
The tides can be a current, we were burning
Tell me 'God is gon' save us" now where was this nigga when rain didn't let up
The whole thing is set up soon as we get away my brothers always gettin' wet up
You tell me that you love me, but I can remember times he was chill when shit was ugly
It's you that's gone that fuckin' hurting me, who the hell you think you is, the black Hercules?
And you supposed to the save the world, ain't it the perfect dreams?
We walked the perfect seas, desert the Earth and save the dragon
He gave you super powers, ain't that how it fuckin' happens?
I lose a love, you lose a life, now ain't that fuckin' tragic?
And I'm just supposed to praise the Lord and live in all the madness?
(Live in all the madness)

[Hook: Jean Deaux ]
They say there's gon' be a downpour
(They say there's gon' be a downpour)
They say the water's gon' wash away my people
(They say the water gon' wash us away, no)
Everybody gon' need a boat
(Everybody gon' need a boat)
They say there's gon' be a downpour
(They say there's gon' be a downpour)

[Outro: Mick Jenkins]
Noah, Noah, Noah won’t you open your boat
Noah, Noah, Noah won’t you open your boat
You left us out here drowning in this truth
You left us out here drowning in this truth
Noah, Noah, Noah won’t you open your boat
Noah, Noah, Noah won’t you open your boat
You left us out here drowning in this truth
You left us out here drowning in this truth
You probably gon' need a boat!
