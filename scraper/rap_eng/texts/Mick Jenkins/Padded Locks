[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Somebody put me on a leash
I'm buckin’ wild like the AK 'cause it came from KAYTRA
I point it down so you can't escape her
Even if you duck, duck goose neck, your Canada Goose wet
Barred up from your boots to your crewneck
This that blue flame, put the green to this shit, this that blue dream
Put your schemes to the test in real life, bet you need a vest, bet you need a vet
Niggas bitin’ crazy, already seen a death by rabies
Niggas gettin' lazy diggin' holes and pushin' daisies
Boonk actin' like it's gravy lookin' crazy on the internet
Niggas dirty dancin', no Patrick Swayze
Lover don’t get caught on your Savion Glover for these white boys
They out here cancellin’ plans at the last minute
You'll deny it then admit it
That type mad different, but I ain’t mad, I'm high as a kite
Trippin' supplyin' the light, niggas can’t buy this advice, listen
Caution with questionin' shit niggas that claim you bitchin'
Get straight to the money whenever your hand start itchin'
Know that if you Rodman you'll never be Mike or Pippen
And you gotta know that ain't me dissin', dodgin' smoke screens
That ain't the Piff in the air or nigga smokin' different
Could read the same bible but niggas quote it different
They finna do clean water just like Prohibition
Already know the mission, why they keep on missin', we grow more efficient

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
Gotta have it, please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin', make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics, we get through them locks when they padded
I never had it, gotta get the free gotta have it (gotta have it)
Gotta have it, please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin', make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics, we get through them locks when they padded
I never had it, gotta get the free gotta have it (gotta have it)

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Ay yo these niggas mad thirsty for the fame and glory
You's as basic as a baby daddy on Maury
Fuck your fake chain blingin', autotune singin'
I'm a killer bee straight out the hive and I'm stingin'
Dirty sling Doctor, botox your girls lips up
We soul trainin' 'em like Don Cornel, get your dick sucked
We fist fuckin' the money, we runnin' down jewelers
We flooded backstage out like ice in the coolers
Fuck the rulers, Donald Trump is a piece of shit
I got 36 chambers, hollow tip in the clip
Smoke a dick, no time for the games and dramatics
We blessed every morning with today's mathematics
Put a hole in your cabbage, quick to fuck up your party
Off your whole set nigga, you can ask Cardi
We used to lose our cracks and we was runnin' from the narcies
Now we watchin' Shark Tank, rolls up in the marquees

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
Gotta have it, please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin', make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics, we get through them locks when they padded
I never had it, gotta get the free gotta have it (gotta have it)
Gotta have it, please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin', make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics, we get through them locks when they padded
I never had it, gotta get the free gotta have it (gotta have it)
