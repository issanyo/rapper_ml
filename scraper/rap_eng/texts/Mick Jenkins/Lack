Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
Youngin tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack cause I'm coming from the back like the heimlich
Maneuver
Rap MacGruber, fresh
Be super duper, cause I use a luffa
Don't do no molly but niggas shroomin like Koopa Troopa. And hittin' holly like I was hanging with Mr. Cooper
Just ginger ale for yo hoes I don't want they souls
Mobbin' in this bitch
Like Dennis Rodman in this bitch it's so much going on in my head
He kinda like Robin in this bitch I flip you just might catch the bat That's acrobatic you gasp that's asthmatic what you can't breathe?
My nigga, what, you can't see?, You talkin' tough Toucan Sam, don't get to fuckin' wit me
I clip yo wings
Now you fly as penguin
Banging
Dope slanging
A fuckin' slave, I can still see the rope hanging.
Blame your environment or blame your companions, and I'mma sneak up this bitch like we in this bitch

[Hook]
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Burner in the back pack
Don't sleep on them knapsacks, bet you don't see black jack if you do my g
Blow fat sacks wit the crew we be on backporch talking truth probably
The reason most of mine done seen they 84th season
Only blues when niggas bleeding
Free Nation Rebel Soldier never tolerate the treason
Free masons bumping shoulders never contemplate allegiance
Free basing baking soda with the coke it couldn't get this dope it's all 'bout how you whip it
How he sip it wit his pinky in the air this ain't no champagne
How you be swank when free the campaign
They shoot for stardom
I be the Anne Frank
So miss me with the static
He be high and writin' in verses just like writing books in attics.

[Hook]
Youngin' tryna be timeless

Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, dont lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
