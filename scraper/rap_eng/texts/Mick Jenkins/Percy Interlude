[Skit: Friend + Mick Jenkins]
Nigga; somebody had—they got enough courage to be like, "Aye—you gon'—uh—pass that?" I wasn't 'bout to ask that day, 'cause I already knew what type it was I bought. Ray looked at that nigga, was like, "Nah, boy—you see? It's a percy, you see?" hah, and niggas was like, "What?" I already knew what he said, but niggas was lookin' at him like, "What?" And then I was like, "Bruh, that's a personal," hahaha, like, the closest gon' got to hittin' that joint, is sniffing it
Damn!
