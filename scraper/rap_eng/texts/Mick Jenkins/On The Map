[Chorus]
She lives in North Dakota
She lives in my lap
She hit me from her Motorolla
I told her face-time me on your iMac
I want to be her nigga
Cause she's always in Tommy Hilfiger
She know my passport got the stamps
Stamps like I'm an envelope nigga
She lives in Arizona
I told her drink more water (sip)
She lives outside the matrix
I told her I'm a martyr

[Bridge]
On the map
We be everywhere and no where
All over the map
I'm a find her, I'm a go there
I'm a bring her back
I'm a go down there
I'm a finna have a show there
I'm a bring her back
I'm a bring her back

If she on the map
We be everywhere and no where
All over the map
I'm a find her, I'm a go there
I'm a bring her back
I'm a go down there
I'm a finna have a show there
I'm a bring her back
I'm a bring her back

[Verse]
She like me cause my third eye open
Aperture be set, a nigga is focused
She lives in New Orleans
It ain't nothin' but a flight and you know it
It was in the park
Had the sage burnin'
When I seen her
It was art
Talk in person
Leanin' and learnin' in between the laughter
Brought our own water
She a martyr
Can't put nothin' past her
Said she want the world
Didn't know how to get it
So I asked her
Where she want to go
How much dough we gon' need to float
Show me on the map
Where you at
And where you tryin' go
We can spin the globe
We can do Madrid
Do Milan
India, Monaco
All I wanna know
Know you're mine
Show me on the map
Show me on the map
Show me on the map
Show me on the map

[Chorus]
She lives in North Dakota
She lives in my lap
She hit me from her Motorolla
I told her face-time me on your iMac
I want to be her nigga
Cause she's always in Tommy Hilfiger
She know my passport got the stamps
Stamps like I'm an envelope licker

[Bridge]

[Outro]
She lives in Montreal
She lives in California
She lives Westside Chicago
She lives in Alabama
She lives in Tallahassee
She lives in Miami
She lives in Oklahoma
She lives in my lap
