[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
I remember when we first moved out here to chi-town
Knew that this was my town
Quickly found out that we couldn't ride 'round with hats cocked that crack rock had bad hoods on padlock
5-0 like Matlock and Cole park was the hideaway
First day that you took me shit was lookin' like a holiday
Nobody in school everybody kickin' it
One nigga talkin' everybody listenin'
Never paid attention to the shot callas
Was more excited by the fightin' that the ball brought us
9 foot rims had us thinkin' we was all ballas
Tryna impress the shorties that a visit to the mall brought us
I watched you spit and you was gamin' hoes
Knew I, wanted that shit but wasn't capable
But whenever you needed it you would let me play the role
Wingman to the stingman, but without you here it ain't the same thing man

79th street, at 6am its the cleanest street they bother to sweep
On the southside
And at 8am it's dirtier than the crackheads that infest its surface
Here, flamin' hots and honey buns are a heart healthy breakfast
Children speak as if their past lives weren't nautical
And newspaper is nothing more than a fan or insulation
On 79th street, niggas ain't got shit
There are more black (black) boarded buildings
(and bored black teens at blackboards) than black teachers and black children at blackboards
And black families are chained to corners stores by the link of government assistance
It's a cold, cold world for a broke ass nigga
It's a windy city when ain't no warmth in yo' pockets
Stay up my nigga
Stay up
