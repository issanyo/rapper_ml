(Hook: Reggie Bonds) (Repeat x2)
But really i don't know shit!
Im just a Ol'Dirty Bastard from the Devils Pit!
A rock on!
A rock on!
But really i don't know shit!
Im just a Ol'Dirty Bastard from the Devils Pit!
(Verse 1: Reggie Bonds)
All my niggas they gangbang thinking like I should do the same thang!
Instead i give the truth in these quotes and try to maintain!
Wack rappers bang bang!
On some Chief Keef shit!
Chief keep the key to the gates but niggas peaking!
Preaching!
And they act like we don't see the signs!
Leader minds!
But living in a world where they telling us that we the prob!
Lem!
I think Im going on a limb!
A piece of shit black head irritating the skin!
Of these white folks!
They hope the shit I kicks a type O!
They brainwashing the youth!
To think the real niggas is psychos!
Write slow!
Cause my daddy use to drink fast!
Wimp lash!
Seen em get mad!
And stick his foot in my moms ass!
The thought is harsh!
Hydrate they soul cause they body parched!
I kick it funky cause they need a fart!
The fumes!
A wake a nigga ass up in a quick fast!
Dead bodies on steet!
Police kill us and just laugh!
I'm kicking TRUTH!

(Hook: Reggie Bonds) (Repeat x2)
But really i don't know shit!

A rock on! Talk yo shit lil nigga!
A rock on! Talk yo shit lil nigga!
But really i don't know shit!

(Verse 2: Reggie Bonds)
It's so amusing!
The thoughts is so confusing!
But the lies getting big as a bitch no respucha!
Respirators!
Denominators!
Numbers to a healthy life!
I hope this truth that I kick can elevate the flight!
We taking off!
Haaa!!
Fake niggas I lunch on em!
The Gacy features!
Feasting!
Cause they know the hungry turn to leaches!
Turned the pen into a sword I'm chopping down trees!
And for that green they a sell they soul that's the devils leaves!
I know the devils watching!
Entertain the entertainment!
They wish me luck! (Break a leg)
Paul George in the making!
Not on no funny shit!
Just thought that line was kinda odd!
They wish me luck with they mouth!
But pray on my demise!
Dictating directions through the tube so we stay confused!
Everyday that I awake it's lesser righteous on the news!
Ferguson just keep yo fight strong!
Rest In Peace to
Mike!
Brown!
Innocent child gunned down!
Let's protect the youth!

(Hook: Reggie Bonds) (Repeat x2)
But really i don't know shit!

A rock on! Talk yo shit lil nigga!
A rock on! Talk yo shit lil nigga!
But really i don't know shit!

(Verse 3: Mick Jenkins)
Kill EM with the kindness, hit em with the visine try to cure the blindness!
