[Bridge]
Isnâ€™t it ironic, got 'em Hooked On Phonics?
Mama used to think it was just chronic, it was all bad
It was all bad, it was all bad
Isn't it ironic, got 'em Hooked On Phonics?
Mama used to think it was just chronic, it was all bad
It was all bad, it was all bad
Isn't it ironic, got 'em Hooked On Phonics?
Mama used to think it was just chronic, it was all bad
It was all bad, it was all bad
And all we wanted was to give you was a good time, some good vibes

[Hook]
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get down, get down, get down, get down
(and all we wanted to give you was a good time)


[Verse]
Came in this bitch with intentions to black out
The audience all white, I thought we been blacks out
See thirty five show tour and I almost backed out a year ago
Back in my bag, back in the days, a young nigga trapped out the pad
Couple of ounces, no, It wasn't too bad, cup full of water, I be missin' my dad
Told my love that I would do him one better
That's on my kidneys, my piss soo much clearer
Down to the letter, you can't offend me, it's February
Man, everybody's shoulder's cold, everybody know it's gold
Driftin' in this pole position, everybody holdin' O's
Bars in yours in no time, bars in your court, know it's go time
We didn't come for Gold Line, from that southside Chicago, I got that
I can't go mind, I'm still underground, pay attention, that's a gold mine
Old time, why you talkin' paper?, I'm still for mine, nigga

[Outro]
And I wake up feelin' good, lemme pray, lemme blow
Send a text, "What y'all niggas on today? Lemme know"
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, nigga
And I wake up feelin' good, lemme pray, lemme blow
Send a text, "What y'all niggas on today? Lemme know"
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up...
