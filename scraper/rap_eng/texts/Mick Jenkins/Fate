[Verse 1]
Dabs of the shatter
Demons in my shadows
Water in my bladder
Watch the people scatter when the rain falls
Same old shit like the same drawers
Who knew that shoulders could be this cold
I, told her holler when the pain thaws
Low key it wasn't indoor
I was rolling chemdawg
She was off the menthols
Please, we were not on the same plateau
She be much more than an alto
Shawty had few pheromones for this baritone harboured lies
So we couldn't harmonise at all

[Hook]
Face it lady we weren't meant to be
Basically I'm tryna set you free
I know, I know
I told you I won't let you go
I know, I know
Didn't wanna feel like that no more
I know, I know
I just might miss you when you gone

[Verse 2]
Dabs of the shatter
Demons in my shadows
Water in my bladder
Watch the people scatter when the rain falls
Same old shit like the same drawers
Didn't give a fuck, them panties came off regardless
We already naked baby, why so cautious?
Throw it to the wind so often
We be playing it safe from changing the pace
It's the only canvas we could paint and erase
Drop lines with my fingers I could trace to your soul
Then like a trachea broke we on our last breath
How do we breathe under water?

[Hook]
