[Chorus: Alex Wiley & Azizi Gibson]
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired
I get in and out the jam like MacGyver
Yeah that chopper turn a fitted to a visor
Don't ask me bitch, I'm not your supervisor
We don't give a fuck, yeah you suck, that shit ain't enough
You will waste your nut and we clutch finna pull up
We cannot be touched, what's the fuss we so merciless
Yeah you think you hot, nigga (fuck you)

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
Man you different (duh)
A nigga needs his distance (get away)
Yeah he was cool before now you lookin' like some bitches
Yeah it's just me and my dog and we lookin' like Tintin
I get in a world of science boutta open a dimension
God damn
'Cause y'all idolize hoes, with your eyes closed
Elevation set the low
How the fuck we get here?
Bust a nut in your left ear so you know why we came here
Yup, know I gotta make my name here
Boutta change the name of all the damn reindeer
Have a holiday boutta celebrate every year
No fighting games but you know your boy top tier
Ooh, for the rush
Sorry fool I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
Who are you if you don't know us?
It's [?] no one trusts

[Chorus: Alex Wiley & Azizi Gibson]
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired
I get in and out the jam like MacGyver
Yeah that chopper turn a fitted to a visor
Don't ask me bitch, I'm not your supervisor
We don't give a fuck, yeah you suck, that shit ain't enough
You will waste your nut and we clutch finna pull up
We cannot be touched, what's the fuss we so merciless
You think you hot, nigga (what?)

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Rollin' a blunt on the highway
Oh did I mention it's my strain
I ain't got time for the mind games
Givin' me brain like a migraine
You can look but you can't find me
You niggas never define me
I knew that I had it since 90'
It was your time and your times change
I lace up my boots and then I excel, might as well
Servin' that shit to my clientele, might as well
We all a product of try and fail
I got the dope it's a fire sale
I hit the booth and leave fire trails
I got that shit that make iron melt
Tryna get Richie is Lionel
Rollin' my dope and fuck how you feel
I'm from Chicago it's been a drill
I got some niggas still in the field, like the NFL
Yo new shit sound like a Benadryl
Yo girl hit me like, when we finna chill?
She kinda annoying, I hit it still
They said I would fail but I didn't still
And now I'm caught up in a whirlwind
Go to sleep and wonder where the world went
If they on the path then I encourage them
We just out here young and fuckin' flourishing
Never been too proud to be American
But I guess it suits me 'cause I'm arrogant
Take your knee out like you Nancy Kerrigan
Gave a fuck before, I never care again, never care again

[Chorus: Alex Wiley & Azizi Gibson]
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired
I get in and out the jam like MacGyver
Yeah that chopper turn a fitted to a visor
Don't ask me bitch, I'm not your supervisor
We don't give a fuck, yeah you suck, that shit ain't enough
You will waste your nut and we clutch finna pull up
We cannot be touched, what's the fuss we so merciless
You think you hot, nigga (what?)

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
Aye, y'all so fucking woke, still coppin' dimes
Boy, I know that you don’t want no smoke
No nine for real
Crack a seal we can take it slow, take a smoke
Ain’t no deuces nigga, this an invitational
They killin' niggas and they appetite is insatiable
We build up like Mason’s do
Penny brick and mortar, plenty Rick and Morty references
I know my dick is shorter in a parallel universe where little dicks are More attractive than skin is important
I'm more proactive when things start to get bumpy anyway
They lump me in with conscious rappers
But I'm so much more than a preacher
Writer, teacher, learn to see the real
Don't fall into the feature film trappin'
Know that niggas will act regardless, I'm hardly heartless
The passion is hardy and Euro steppin' like Harden
Flippin' through chapters of passport papers
Boarding charter boats and altered suits or author quotes like
"Drink more water," you should try it
Nothing in this world like it, word to Keke Wyatt

[Chorus: Alex Wiley & Azizi Gibson]
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired
I get in and out the jam like MacGyver
Yeah that chopper turn a fitted to a visor
Don't ask me bitch, I'm not your supervisor
We don't give a fuck, yeah you suck, that shit ain't enough
You will waste your nut and we clutch finna pull up
We cannot be touched, what's the fuss we so merciless
You think you hot, nigga (what?)
