[Verse 1]
You know I came just to smoke
Don't blow no reggie my way
Matter fact, stay out my way
I'ma just sit in this corner here
Roll up the dope on my dolo
Fresh, I got dressed at the coroner
Remember when we was in Polo
Really if ever again
It's contemporary, got me ready to spend
Fuckin' up commas
My verses look crazy on paper, I write 'em in pen
Ain't no erasin' mistakes , we just learn from 'em 'til we earn from 'em
That's how I started talkin' this water
That's when we started makin' this money
Six figures and not one was a father
And wonder how a nigga fuck up your daughter
Same way I fuck up my lungs

[Chorus]
You know I came just to smoke
Don't blow no reggie my way
Matter fact stay out my way
You know I came just to smoke
Don't blow no reggie my way
Don't blow no reggie my way
Don't blow no reggie my way

[Verse 2]
You know I came just to smoke
Backwoods a thing of the past now
Papers, I sprinkle the hash now
Would crumble if I couldn't concentrate
Shattered perceptions, I got the juice
And that shit ain't never from concentrate
Got through security with contraband
I'm on my Dora like "√Åndale"
Step in the spot and they eyein' me
Cornea snatchin' a part of me
Cottonmouth'll get you soon enough
Wake up and realize the moon is us
We've been controllin' the wave
Fuck Google Maps 'cause it ain't no directions
My nigga, this road ain't been paved
This joint ain't been rolled
I mean this phrase ain't been coined
No coins in my way, what more can I say?

[Chorus]
You know I came just to smoke
Don't blow no reggie my way
Matter fact, stay out my way
You know I came just to smoke
Don't blow no reggie my way
Don't blow no reggie my way
You know I came just to smoke
