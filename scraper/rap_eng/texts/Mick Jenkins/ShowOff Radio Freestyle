[Verse 1]
If you knew better you niggas would do better
They want it less complicated I'm never gon lose letters
Not even for new cheddar
Don't feel the need to beef it up when I abuse letters
Thrifty, dub print shorts shooting the breeze like a drive by
Young fly guy that's never gon lose feathers
Copped the purple or the green when the B.B. King blues get us
Couple that with my height and the paces at which I write
And it's safe to say that I make enough music for two niggas
Make it for you niggas, hope that you catch the message
Hope that between the flash and the flair you pause and reflect it
I'm hoping checks get collected like a Nike shoe fetish
I'm shooting for New York Times right now we news letters
Not enough paper, way too many issues
Sweat from the grind require way too many tissues
Get a towel in here, F R can a nigga get a vowel in here?
Matter fact, two E's matter fact that's free
Bumping facts through these tracks and these tracks get assembled like a factory
Ain't no stopping or attacking me, it's Mick Jenk
Word
