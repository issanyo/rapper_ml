SERPENT: I’m sssorry if I ssstartled you

Um, where’s Adam?
EVE: He’s tending to the olive trees

SERPENT: Oh, but all your pretty fruit is bruised now

Come. I will show you the sweetest delight in the garden

As a surprise for Adam

EVE: Really?

SERPENT: Commmeee

EVE: Alright

SERPENT: Here

EVE: But this is the one tree in the garden we cannot touch

This is the forbidden fruit

SERPENT: Did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?
Ssssurely not

EVE: We may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden
Except for the tree in the middle of the garden

God has forbidden us to either touch or eat the fruit of that tree
For if we do, we shall die

SERPENT: Ssss ssss sssss You believe that nonsense sss sss?
Of course you will not die ssssss

God knows that as soon as you eat it
Your eyes will be opened, and you and Adam
Will be like gods yourselves

You will know Good and Evil

EVE: [Gasps] The fruit here is truly beautiful

SERPENT: Oh yessssss, it is
