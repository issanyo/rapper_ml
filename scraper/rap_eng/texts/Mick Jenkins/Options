[Verse 1: Trademark]
You know
Pardon my french but you talkin' to a boss
I keep pounds of that pressure, I'm smoked out in my loft
My name carry weight now'days, don't get it crossed
These goonies I got behind me would love to get you lost
When it come to that weight I know ways to get that off
Homie I'm bout my paper, no stalling, I never pause
Some war on these streets, keep a nina in my drawls
And two clips in my backpocket in case I gotta pop it
AR15 in the closet that shoot baby rockets, but it's all peace and love, I'm just tryna make a profit
Been saving up my dollars now my bank account solid
When you plan with a few stacks, that give you more options
No more pennies in my pocket, blue Benji's in my wallet
Business contacts in my call logs, Trader never fall off
Back like I left something, keep it real no frontin'
Stayed away from that fake shit and made mo' money (mo' money)

[Hook: LeeLee Haxi]
Now I got options, get money
Choose who I rock with, take with me
Now I got options, no fake shit
Choose who I rock with, keep the family in, ay

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
I'm still saving every dime, ain't a damn thing change
Crash test dummy tryna merge in my lane
Fuckboys rather see me locked in a cage, wanna block a nigga shine, hate to see me bling bling
I'm the one like Neo, spit dope like a kilo
Wild like Rigo, trap hard like Nino
Since way back when, been on my grind since the Geo
An educated brother like Carlton and Theo
Them other niggas cool, but them niggas ain't me though
Bro Mike Jackson, them other niggas Tito
Fly like Jordan when he glide from the freethrow
2 hoes in my 2 door, what a trio
Live in New Orleans with a bad bitch's tree yo
Ain't life a bitch, but that pussy ain't sweet though
Fuck the P-I-Gs and the P.Os, I made a bunch of cheesecake, Bistro with the Migos
Smellin like endo sippin' Clicquot, a nigga tryna ball like chemo
Fresh like Easter, fly like eagles
I catch that dirty money like receivers
I speak my peace like aunty Peaches
I heard good weed could cause amnesia
My Lord I went from hoodrat to divas
I pray to God our leaders dont mislead us

[Hook: LeeLee Haxi]
Now I got options, get money
Choose who I rock with, take with me
Now I got options, no fake shit
Choose who I rock with, keep the family in, ay

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
I been in...4 countries in 5 days, that 8 flights
I ate rice like 9 ways cross 3 cultures
I see vultures, I see people dying 'round me
My mind state is...fucked...
I spent way too much money on cheap shit like prom dates
And yet it still elongate
My pockets is lined with long faces and white tears
I'm lightyears ahead of the buzz y'all toyin' with
Cowboyin' with
Makin' points I can't be much more poignant with...shit
A nigga learned a lotta lessons at the end of the burner of Nebuchadnezzar, you can toss me into the furnace
Flip them the finger, only ever did the Sojourner
The sirens is blingin', pull over yo' pigment concern us
My pigment is blingin' , deep as the water
All you niggas ever seen was the surface but wait till I surface
You might catch a scene of me surfin' these waves but I move with a purpose
Keep my faith and my patience because I'm moving with serpents
These niggas is thirsty, these bitches is thirsty
The industry lurkin'...
The vibes in here perfect, yeah
