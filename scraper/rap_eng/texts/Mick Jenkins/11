[Verse]
Started this shit with no intention of finish, man
I've been pushing this water, just trust this man to replenish
But is it enough?
Because as I write this I'm forced to think of my worth
Forced to defend my color, intelligence
And my purse from our own
And the system is the attack of the clones
Know they know how I'm living
It's geo-tagging in photos on phones
All under the watchful eyes of drones
I can find your house on Google Earth, nigga
What the fuck you think a trap is worth, nigga?
Look around, can't you see we hurt?
Pot-holes fill faster than our needs
Can't you see we dirt to these niggas?
It's crazy, we the culture
Pride of fucking lions, yeah, we trudge around the jungle
Picking crumbs up after vultures
They know that we the commerce
From Com-Ed to Converse to Kanye to Complex
It converts to C.R.E.A.M
We used to have to read in between the lines
But these days, we can see it clear through Venetian blinds
The color blind only see the black and white
I'm telling y'all they got a bigger appetite
I'm telling y'all they got a bigger appetite

[Bridge]
And everybody wanna be a nigga
But don't nobody wanna be a nigga
And everybody wanna be a nigga
But don't nobody wanna be a nigga

[Outro]
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
