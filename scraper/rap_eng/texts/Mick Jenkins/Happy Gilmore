[Intro]
"The fact that... so many people outside the culture of Chicago, they hyped up the music not knowing that real lives would be affected. All the type of madness happened within the music, and the music was a real life depiction of that. How'd you feel about that?"
"I wanted to slap you in your face, honestly..."
"The hell are you doi--agh!"

[Verse]
Tryna spit my shitâ€”you'd likely slit your throat
You bitch niggas ain't Piccolo
Ain't no comeback kid, eight fingers on thumbtack, kid
I'm just open-handed slapping niggas
Happy Gilmore tactics, catch you slipping if we carve up the ice
Princess cuts in my flows, this nigga in here lighting squares like he know Vanna White
It's funny, I'm just in here copping some O's
Serve me a QP for a G
Back on the street, I'm in a steamer with a hoodie on
(Bro, y'all niggas hot as hell)
It turn to a sauna with them boys behind us
Niggas in Pilsen, not Paris, they still gon' have to find us
My security blanket didn't manifest like Linus
Sharp as Steve Harvey lining in the 9-9, it's
A young black man more honest than he's non-violent
'Cause sometimes niggas need they ass beat, foreal, yeah
I don't fuck with collagen, don't do no apologin'
I don't fix my lips for these niggas
I'ma say what's on my mind, a hundred all of the time
You can suck a nigga dick, you feel different
I would tell it to my bros, I done told it to my foes
If you think I'm on some shit, you should listen
I'ma look you in your face if I hit you
Give a fuck about your clique or who with you, nigga

[Outro]
It could be one or two or three or four... or more
Or more (one) or more (one, two)
Or more (one) or more
