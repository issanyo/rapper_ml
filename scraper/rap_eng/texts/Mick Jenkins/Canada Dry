[Verse 1]
Ridin' around off this ginger ale
Peep the herbal essence in the papers, vapors
On fire if you couldn't tell
But trust me, I ain't checkin' for no Jezebels or Delilahs
Lot of niggas screaming that they real
Perception is a mothafuckin' pill, you a liar
I been rocking boats since Aaliyah
Trying to take it higher with these notes like Mariah
Fuck with me, your connect ain't got it for the free
Start the elevation, I can't keep it lowkey
OG, finna wake these niggas up
Ain't been getting no sleep, tryna bring him more sheep
I'm like little Bo Peep, what you in it for?
Cause they out here copping souls, what they hittin' fo'?
Are you the hitter or the lick? What's the difference, though?
Yeah I heard you got a plan; what's the mission, though?
Cause this game is so foul (too foul), got a young man
Tryna move through the city like a black Tom Thibodeau
Like Stallone, you can fight it all you want
But we still gonna be expendable, these niggas don't listen, no
I was always told that you never really know
What you got 'til it's gone
Cancer caught my granny 'fore I got a chance to check up
What the fuck was I on? (the fuck was I on?)
I was playing checkers, this is chess
Never put your faith into a check
Got to play the hand that you was dealt
There's only four aces in the deck, motherfucker

[Chorus] (x2)
I been riding around off this ginger ale
Mama wouldn't like the way I smell right now
Realest nigga out; can't you tell?
Drink this water, tell me how you feel right now
Riding around off this ginger ale
Praying every day that I don't fail right now
Healing niggas; how can't you tell?
Drink this water, tell me how you feel right now
