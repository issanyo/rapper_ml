[Intro: Saba]
Mm, ayy, yeah, ayy

[Verse 1: Saba]
I woke up this morning feeling just like I'm a star
No I don't drink but I might buy the bar
Like shots on me because I ain't get shot
That's on my soul, Diana Ross
I am on my pivot like I am Ross
I am a force to be reckoned
Like a western film, might pull up on a horse
This is the part where the party is over
But you and your friends know you will not go home
This for my niggas who went and got fired
Just 'cause they desire to grow their hair long
I just said peace to the past like "so long"
I don't smoke weed yet they passing the bong
Chiefin' the reefer just like Cheech and Chong
This for the teachers who told me that songs won't go a long way
But I'm a long way from home because of it, ayy
Look at this love that I'm covered in, ayy
Built from the ground up, a architect
I present just like a scientist
I'm in this, I give just 'cause I am blood, yeah
Opposite of what they government
I protect people that show me their love, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Xavier Omär]
So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

[Chorus: Saba]
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me

[Verse 2: Saba]
I said I pivot like my name was Ross
Pivot, Diana Taurasi
Pivot like Moss, he all squeak
I'm with a army, audience applause
Ain't been the same since Walt's autopsy
I just wish that I could call him, tell him 'bout tour
Tell him how shit not the same like before
Tell him how labels knockin' at the door
Tell him about how my face in The Source or somethin'
Call upon the Lord to come my Autumn
Though I'll never get to see the day
That my daughter come, ignore the dumb
Shit that come with the territory, share the story, all of 'em
Even with the little twist like Oliver all of the time
I told the block y'all should open your eyes
I come from nothing but drugs and the crime
I sung out, oh yes I made it alive
Shouts to the fans and they gave me some time, yeah
Look at the love that I'm covered in
Kept it a hundred, I coveted
This is all real, ain't no supplement
Own all my masters and publishing
Head to Korea, they fuck with it

[Pre-Chorus: Xavier Omär]
So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

[Chorus: Saba]
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
Look at all of the love around me, astounding
How niggas still found the time to hate my county
Been cookin' niggas that look like me
We all got bounties on our heads and business is bountiful
My niggas accounted for
Two accountants to run my checks and balances
I never bank on balance though
We stay good with the handy work
But if I can't see a callous that can't be worth a dime
They say that a dollar'll make you rich
But that fake shit can't be worth the time
I got a eight to my face when I have the time
Smoking these days just to pass the time
Smoking sometimes just to stare in your face
Or just to stare in the mirror, I'm scared of standing in place
Even the slowest of paces
Keeping you on the move, it behooves you
All this mindless behavior we're used to
I kick it like Bruce Lee, I be like the water I'm deep in this shit
I'm a young Fela Kuti whippin' a hooptie, we smoked out
Boys at the corner store loc'd out
We stop at the corner store anyway
Look at all of the love around me

[Pre-Chorus: Xavier Omär]
So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

[Chorus: Saba]
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me
