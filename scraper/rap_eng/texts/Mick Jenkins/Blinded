I must admit that(?)
I see this light
I, once was blinded, but
I regained sight

[Hook 1: WebsterX]
So I tossed the papers off the desk
And my G be on my chest
Harder while I'm hollaring
Y'all cannot see me I'm next
Y'all cannot see me I'm next, y'all cannot see me I'm next
I'm moving like ????
Y'all cannot see me I'm next
(Where were you when I was new, yall cannot see me I'm next
?????, ????
?????, y'all cannot see me I'm next
I think I get the message now, prolly should admit I'm next

I was lost I found my way out the Matrix
It was through this neo-soul I found this poetry, I'm talking Floetry
And Sade, and Lauryn Hill, you snorin' still
I'll make sure that I pray for you
I was lost I found my way out the Matrix
It was through this neo-soul I found this poetry, I'm talking Floetry
And Sade, and Lauryn Hill, you snorin' still
I'll make sure that I pray for you

[Verse 1: WebsterX]
See? I told you
Lord knows you convince the world to fold and, Lord knows ?? bad for good is golden
Lord knows I just spit the bars chosen, Klondike bars say I keep it frozen
All the wilder while I'm takin hits and having poison, ???
False happiness cost a fortune, Lord
Avoid tainting coloured grass and moon rocks and ???
I been sicker than stars ????
Keeping faith, straps in the back of the cockpit
So one of these MCs will get faked out on this
Im hooked on sinus, ?????
?????? finish, eh!

Earth tones in the winter time, cold with it
Brought the soul with it (brough the soul), ya these rap songs is just church poems at a different time
And like church food kitchens fam we been in line
Ain't no precheck when its dinner time
The only united colours that I ever seen, was in the windows of Bennetton
But fuck it we rolling like inner tubes
I think yo' perception's offended mine, exac-tly what I inted to do
Black Wall Street burned down, coldest niggas was assassinated
Boldest of us get the coldest years, coz, most of us way past sedated
Niggas love it so they had to hate it
I can tell a feeling's fabricated
I can really give a fuck though, these days all my niggas been emancipated
FreeNation for the cancer patients, whole world been diagnosed
Racist notions getting branded racist, motherfuckers out here buying woes
Good niggas out here dying off, lace the verses with the cayenne pepper
Hella pressure I don't need the sauce, share my light I dont need the shade
On a mission you can see this water, learning lessons I won't be the same
Learning lessons I won't be the same
