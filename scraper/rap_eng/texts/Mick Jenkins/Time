[Verse 1]
Everybody want to float when the boat rock
We keep it organic
I get it straight from the grow-op
See the fire in his eye like a stove top
I don't know no op
Why we can't co-op
And disarm minds 'fore they blow up
Hold up let unleavened bread get broke up
We got plenty water we could pour up
I know that you parched
They try to say you dumb
But I know that you smart
See we all just victims
Of trying to staying straight in the system
Made to twist him like kinky weaves in '05
And this shit is still fucking up my hedges
Please don't get to fucking with the message
It's a lecture you about to learn a lesson
I suggest you get to praying for a blessing
I'm about to sneeze
Branch out like a tree without the leaves
Know that you witnessed the fall
Better know that the boat is gonna rock
Better know that I'm risking it all
Know that this ain't just a ball
Better know I dropped outta college
And spoke at DePaul
The one they poked fun at
Know that my picture's been focusing
Some ain't got focused at all
Watch the waves fall
Watch how I run it

[Hook X2]
Cause I ain't got time for the bullshit
Know that I do it for free
And they say time is money
Know that I do it for free
And they claim time is money

[Verse 2]
Back porch sippin
We were right off 62nd with the squad
And my nigga, that my brethren
Better know its Chi town
We just making hella noise
Feel them boys
What you want
Better know that
We them boys
We them boys
South side rolling King Drive
Sunbeams in my eye
Got the beam on the scope
Just might find you with the light

[Bridge X2]
Hit this truth
Better know I roll it right
Roll it right

[Outro]
Cause I ain't got time
Know that I
Know that I
Bullshit
Time is money
