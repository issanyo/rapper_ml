[Chorus: Curci]
Whole lot of pirates
Lookin' for high risk
Searching for idols
See through your iris
No foolin' a giant
Feel the wrath of a tyrant
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough

[Verse 1: Curci]
I’ve been searching my soul
Looking for diamonds and gold
Thinking how far does it go?
Can I buy love at a store?
Really how much are they running me for?
Are they conning for more
Look, I can see the greed in their eyes now
Trying to show their teeth when they lie
But I will never lie down
Enemies on the line now
Gotta get the high ground, take a step and get sniped down
Who’s got the highest price?
Who’s got the ruby eye?
You know everyone has a price
Who’s got the sharpest knife
Picking at diamond mines
Keep a short leash on them dogs of mine
Goonies they never die
My valentines follow the dollar signs
Hard to not compromise
When you never had shit to begin with
Picking up tricks in your interest
Rather get rich in the trenches
Man I'm talking big business
Where their morals are smaller than inches, get hip to the system or sleep with the fishes, outsmart the vindictive
Don't become a victim

[Chorus: Curci]
Whole lot of pirates
Lookin' for high risk
Searching for idols
See through your iris
No foolin' a giant
Feel the wrath of a tyrant
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
That’s why you gotta look for yourself
Do not live your life on another man's word
Open up these books for yourself
You would get shook by the truth too
Start to see crooks by the Buku
Connections unseen like the Bluetooth
Or the WiFi
Found facts that I can’t deny
I had to change my eye
Which is a fancy way of saying nigga's switch perspective
No auto-tune found my pitch perfected
Figure why a nigga felt so disconnected
Introspective questions answered with deflection
In the mirror no reflections
Was severely misdirected
And then that shit gets dismissed from recollection when I'm sky high
We could shoot the breeze
No drive by
I be Drew Brees with the knowledge of a Rabbi
Kobe send some shooters, keep a Raja Bell with me
Bare with me, grow with me , share with me

[Chorus: Curci]
Whole lot of pirates
Lookin' for high risk
Searching for idols
See through your iris
No foolin' a giant
Feel the wrath of a tyrant
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough
Never really had enough
You can never really have enough
