[Intro: Simeon Wiley]
Man, hell if I know
Damnit haven’t planned it
I’ve been working
Tryna stack it til i'm dead under the soil
I’ve met a couple of hurdles
I don't keep track, but i'm certain
I'm losing hair tryna win it
If a tour doesn't work i'm hurtin'

[Pre Hook: Simeon Wiley]
Bet I turn all my investments like their, heads
Was
Fed up with the days of feeling sorry on my, bed
Woah
Gotta get it right, I might oppose, but the subjects out of focus
See the photos so they know though, ho don't logic me again

[Hook: Simeon Wiley]
I stay hungry man regardless how I eat, Hey
God is on my side but damn I’ve never really seen him
Got problems in my life, but man i'm happy I can speak about it
See it now, it’s all so beautiful to me, beautiful to me
(Beautiful to me)

[Verse 1: Simeon Wiley]
I’ve been so motherfucking bitter about it
Basically I’ve been pacing, Reggie miller the foulest
Game you would be amazed, they want me choking like falcons
They fucking mouses homie, yeah I see me soaring without em!
Maybe i’ll finally kill it, maybe my thinking is wishful
I’ve got a bone to pick, these turkeys always after my dinner
Try to trample me like a roach, man y’all know how it feels
I’ve been developing, I plan to get respect in my field
Baby I need all the fame, speaking of honoring greats
I’ve been polishing game, headache splitting, I thought it would change
But they've been doubting my lane, you couldn't write this shit
No really man you're not comparing even in the slightest bit, ho!
But my hands up for a fight, man it’s been quite a while
Lately I’ve been feeling low, got me looking to the sky
Having trouble finding answers, oh I hate that they hide
I’ve been hating instead of living, I ain't really try
My god why do I bother, might never get it but I won't ever stop it
Oh my god why do I bother, might never get it but i won't ever stop it

[Hook: Simeon Wiley]
I stay hungry man regardless how I eat
God is on my side but damn I’ve never really seen him
Got problems in my life, but man i'm happy I can speak about it
See it now, it’s all so beautiful to me

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Just got back, from a week long vacation in Nassau
Was supposed to be relaxing, wasn’t supposed to be writing
And yet i'm already relapsing
Y’all still three mattresses deep in your slumber
I gave em flashes of light
They only notice the thunder, a storm is coming
So the punch lines weighted the same way
That George Foreman was comin' at niggas grills
Fire give em’ the chills
Bible give em’ the keys
Doctor give em' the pills
Imma bring em the water, but you can't make niggas drink it
Maybe too late to embrace it when your ship is sinkin’
Fuck is niggas thinkin?
I’ve been on point, I ain't throw a dart
Niggas reacting the same way they did to Noah’s Arc
The coldest part is when he closed the door in they faces
Runnin checks up yet i'm slowin' my paces in all these Nikes
Rarely showing our faces at the function
I’ve been dolo tryna grow mo at this junction, what it is man?
