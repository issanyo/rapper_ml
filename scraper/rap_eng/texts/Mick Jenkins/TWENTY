VERSE 1
You don’t talk no more to me
For days i’m in a cage with you
No way, i’ve been a fool
I rest my case and disappear
When i drive the cabriolet
I don’t have my phone on me
Girls, i’ll take you home with me
But you should know that I just need
Just need my way
I like you my way
Like you’re shifty gaze
You and me
I don’t know how to say “sorry”
I can’t change in so many ways
You and me
I don’t know how to say:
“man, sweet dream, teen dream
Aladdin, seventeen, big fight
Caught fire, yuppie”

CHORUS 1
20 hours 20 girls
Never never let me go
20 dollars 20 calls
I just wanna do my show
20 hours many goals
Never never let me go
20 dollars pretty girls
I’m just gonna make my show
