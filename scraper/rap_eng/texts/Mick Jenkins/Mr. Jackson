[Intro: Mick Jenkins]
Take two

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
Twenty in my pocket
How will I spend it?
I can blow it all and roll up something stupendous
Or coastin' in my car, cause niggas wanna go thriftin'
Or floating through the stars, heard Mars got pretty bitches
I'm floating through the stars, heard Mars got pretty bitches
I'm floating through the stars
Stars... (x6)

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Twenty in my pocket
How will I spend it?
Smoking shit that is guaranteed to have you suspended
In mid air, can't feel my toes, my vision's impaired
Them other rappers in there, I'm comin' for they necks like a razor after chin hair
I been rare, like steaks that's undercooked
I stay under radar, that's why I'm overlooked
Can't see me, like Stevland Morris, better known as Stevie
Her fingers in my hair cause my grandma slept in a teepee
She like the way it feels, it get her wet when she pee-pee
I put it in so deeply, that's why she need me
And this

[Hook]
