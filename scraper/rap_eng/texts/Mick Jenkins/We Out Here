[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
You know the hater's gone hate
But my homies gone be down to ride, so we out here
You know they always gone hate
But my niggas gone be down to ride, so we out here
(x2)

Fool

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
I swear to God, I'll be hookin' niggas up
When it's time to leave, got you in that box, hope you box, hope you bob and weave
They done had the nation on lock since the colonies
But i'd rather stand high and die than live on my knees
I told my closest niggas tell those who don't know
Fuck a YOLO
I'm trynna live life in slow-mo
Take a photo
Maybe invest in Acapulco, gold homie
And y'all only impressin' in these hoes, homie
I'm chillin' with women
And they feelin' my threads
Vintage Tommy Hilfiger and a breeze like linen, grinin'
When you see me, but i'm down to EarthProlly had a pound of earth, in my life time
Just blow trees and write rhymes
Goat cheese and white wine
Ho please, i'm quite fine
Like nose bleeds
You won't see
These proceeds
'less I shine
Plus we flowin' underground like the Pipeline
Trynna save the world with tight rhymes
Yeah we fightin' crime

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Playboy Prob]
I got my eyes on the prize, playin' for it
Naw, i'm prayin' for it
Hustle by the hour of power just like i'm playin' forward
Just know i'm slangin' for it
Even if you can't afford it
It's irony would have it free, shit you payin' for it
That's if you want a verse or even just to lay a chorus
Damn, lay before us all of ya plans while they record us
I know you salty, take a flight, you came to board it
My game imported
So I laugh and watch you play a tourist
You niggas make me laugh
Naw, really
I speak hustla' fluently so I can play thesaurus
I know my niggas takin' over and you can't ignore it
Fuckin' with broad niggas, baby drop you can't abort it
You see the chick i'm workin' with and say you can't afford it
You try to soap up all this dolla shit, you can't absorb it
Ask about me boa, Prop is a rida'
Hotta than a few inches of lava
Chill out

[Chorus]

[Outro]
They gone hate you
They can't break you
If you still here, dog, then just stay faithful
(x2)

Just stay thankful
Just stay grateful
You just remember homie they can't break you
They gone hate you
They can't break you
If you still here, dog, then just stay faithful

[Chorus]
