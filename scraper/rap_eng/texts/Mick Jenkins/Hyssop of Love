[Intro]
Wolves in disguise
How you supposed to see 'em with the wool in your eyes?
Sheep to the radio, we fooled and surprised
They ainâ€™t never loved me, it's bullshit and lies
Won't you recognize
All the real gold gets stole by design
That shit in your mind
Off a nigga head for these nickels and these dimes
Niggas ticking with the times
Getting crippled up by the crimes
Niggas say he over weight

[Bridge]
I heard your plug was dry
I heard your plug was dry and I think I got what you need
I might be your guy
No this ain't no weed, different type of high
Got it for the free

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Never needed no dollars to prove worth
Or a slap in the face, before I could move first
On a nigga these days you lose worse when you slipping
We came the truth, purged in the hyssop of love
These niggas talk bread, but they missing the blood
Like they crippin' much like Krillin how they disk could destruct
Rebuild in the ashes, cashes
With the training underwater with the passion, traction
Started gaining some muscle
Lemme tell you it actually started raining at shows
Wasn't moving no Os
But it's a symbol of hustle
Spreading love is an intricate puzzle
And hate'll have you strung out and addicted to struggle

[Hook]
I'm on this love as of late
Smoking bud
Praying to the one above
I been thinking 'bout his love as of late
Like a drug, you won't ever get enough
I've been feeling like the plug as of late
And I ain't saying it's the same kind of high
If you trying to feel good
And you looking for a pusher that'll push
That feeling then I'm that guy

[Bridge]
I heard your plug was dry
I heard your plug was dry and I think I got what you need
I might be your guy
No this ain't no weed, different type of high

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
And this flow is clearly inspired by the love below the TV
Sade coming out my mama speaker box
I know she see me vibin'
We would speak about the way
The world would try to keep me silent
Keep me vibing
Claim to keep the peace
And then assassinate the peace makers
We puff peace pipes
And anticipate
No you can't get security blankets where we from
Niggas have tasted money pussy and prison
But never had freedom a day in his life
I think that I remember
Probably tastes like kindred
If it's sweet I'm in my stride
It's mid December in these fucking walking boots
In a, John Hancock
Cause everything the South Side constitutes is lateral
But we in a different longitude
So we never arrive at the same point
Trees stay in the truth
So I ain't never smoked the same joint twice

[Hook]
I'm on this love as of late
Smoking bud
Praying to the one above
I been thinking 'bout this love as of late
Like a drug, you won't ever get enough
I've been feeling like a plug as of late
And I ain't saying it's the same kind of high
If you trying to feel good
And you need a pusher that'll push
That feeling then I'm that guy
