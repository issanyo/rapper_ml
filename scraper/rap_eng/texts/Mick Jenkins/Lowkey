[Verse 1]:

Pour me up a set
Liquor on your breath now
Baby I confess
I'm down to make you sweat now

[Chorus]:

You pull me in closer
Into your zone yeah
2 in the morning
We're all alone and
If I'm being honest
You got what I want and
Girl if you want it
Whenever you want it

Let's keep it low-key
Let's keep it low-key
Let's keep it low-key

[Verse 2]:

Lipstick on my neck
Liquor on your breath now
Lovin' me the best
Takin' off your dress now

[Chorus]:

You pull me in closer
Into your zone yeah
2 in the morning
We're all alone and
If I'm being honest
You got what I want and
Girl if you want it
Whenever you want it

Let's keep it low-key
Let's keep it low-key
Let's keep it low-key

[Mick Jenkins]:

I mean we always end up right here don't we
How we got each other still feel so lonely
It's not that this don't feel like homies
It's just that it's only on your terms, or my terms
Or some compromise, like it's my turn to be right
She playin' with these frames I can't see right
See 'bout as clear as the black when there be light in the crack of the door
Back of her neck low-key act as the shore for this wave of emotion
Crash on her shoulders like a slave to the potion
Process like session and toss-turn intimate tinges
Don't you see we dancin', don't you see we dancin'
Like back and forth
Push and pull might break don't force it
Give in take the pushing
Give in take me back
I'm fallin'

[Chorus]:

You pull me in closer
Into your zone yeah
2 in the morning
We're all alone and
If I'm being honest
You got what I want and
Girl if you want it
Whenever you want it

Let's keep it low-key
Let's keep it low-key
Let's keep it low-key
