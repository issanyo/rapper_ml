[Intro: TheMIND]
Witnessed the end of our fair lady
A million pieces lost at sea
Ruined is the crew
That's setting sail with me
Oh Lord we're sinking, God knows we fall
Set sail for Heaven, pray my soul won't get lost
Pray God accepts me, I know I'm wrong
But we've been shipwrecked, since we were born

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
It was 91st and Langley, we was 6 deep
Stepping up the stairs, black Buick with a slick creep
Moving down the block we had froze (froze)
Felt the tension in my toes “Man who is that? I don't know"
Driving slow, man, he probably throwed
See we was thrown off, it was New Year's Eve
I still remember when my baby lungs blew them trees
I still felt like a saint when I drew that breeze
On the corners was I hanging never banging, but I knew them G's
It's been tragic, since Boy Meets World it's been savage
But the goal was never really the beef, its been cabbage
We kill for it, when we die we can't have it
But we can't kill the habit holding on to this boat 'til we shipwreck

[Hook: TheMIND]
So we swim upon the shore, I die on sand before the dawn
I watch my niggas die afraid what could I fear
They say the waves will wash our sin
That we were black because our skin
I know we gazed upon the promise, but I'm not sure

[Interlude]
(Shipwrecked!)
(Shipwrecked!)
Oh, we've got a supernatural love
(Shipwrecked!)
(Shipwrecked!)

Oh, we've got a supernatural love

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
I been in these waters like the Titanic
Waves crashed down, you'd have thought a nigga drowned, but I’m staring at the sky like, “Why panic?"
Don’t you know who I pray to? We've been looking like prey
I just caught this shit at the prelude, peace
I been keeping it, steppin' to the wolves
Forever a black sheep to the herd
How you not heard about this nigga?
You think you feeling the flow?
It's somewhere in the ceiling, I’m not high
Trust, off the green, a nigga get it like Popeye, (uh!)
I’ve been trying to give 'em what’s good
But don’t call it food for thought; shit taste like a hot fry, (uh!)
Shit had a nigga so thirsty I couldn’t see straight
It was like I was cock-eyed
Fam, tell 'em what you’ve seen on the southside
Tell 'em, tell 'em where you been, nigga
Tell 'em where you’re going
Cole Park whenever I was outside, (uh!)
Somebody shooting nigga, even when it’s snowing
In the cold, you could see the people thirsty
Well, I gotta little water right here, you heard me
All you gotta do is take a sip
And I don’t want your souls, and I do not want your gold
I just do it for the Free my nigga don't trip
Don’t trip, I do it for the free, my nigga, don’t trip
Don’t trip, I do it for the free, my nigga, don’t trip

[Outro: Sample]
Ten thousand tiny soldiers marching right through my heart
Couldn't keep me at bay
