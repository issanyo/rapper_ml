[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I need a massage
It's all the same

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Place was in my face but it made me OD
Put my face in his place, should be me lowkey
Bullshit, that is all I see
Your face, your product, can you promote me?
I'm young and I can tweet, I'm black and I can rap
The world hates color, my iPhone taught me that
The newspaper died network got my brain fried
It's the same group of guys bringing nonsense to my eyes
You can sell me time shares, I don't care
Lotta money spent, hell yeah, it's in the air
Y'all keep banners up there so no man is down here, cuz
Men don't care 'bout the power in my hair
Put a roof on me, or a coup on me
Y'all the same motherfuckers that never told the truth on me
Who know me, it's like I'm dying just to see through
Runnin' through my thoughts, it's inside a mobile

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Y'all mothafuckas all in my face, man that shit ain't cute
Tellin me how I should live or what to play
But it just won't get through
I'm a cheap ass bitch I'ma save my money
Mothafuckas can't tell me what to do
Dude with the power wanna treat me like a slave
Might as well put me in a zoo

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
I got good ethos for you
That's not something one can repo
We can build on that
We should meet up at home depot
I'm not talking Eros
Or Agape I do not play
You could bring your peoples
Yeah you should bring your peoples
This is for the whole hood, it's soul food
Mix it with this food for thought to reach you
Meet you where you is
Where I used to be I see you
Got some things to learn from you
Got some things to teach you
Transparent, pouring all of his intention see-through
Translucent the delivery
Got light to lead you, light another L and let this fire peak your interest
Know you been stressed, too much negative
It's bout time that love was all we ingest
We pump sedatives
All into your rhetoric until, all that's real is relative
And I need the evidence
Got me screaming motherfuck the etiquette
I know you feel the sentiment, just know that love is love
I'm sowing deep into the sentences
We spread it with relentlessness when

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Y'all mothafuckas all in my face, man that shit ain't cute
Tellin me how I should live or what to play
But it just won't get through
I'm a cheap ass bitch I'ma save my money
Mothafuckas can't tell me what to do
Dude with the power wanna treat me like a slave
Might as well put me in a zoo
Y'all mothafuckas all in my face, man that shit ain't cute
Tellin me how I should live or what to play
But it just won't get through
I'm a cheap ass bitch I'ma save my money
Mothafuckas can't tell me what to do
Dude with the power wanna treat me like a slave
Might as well put me in a zoo

[Outro: Mick Jenkins]
People always looking so pensive
Had to start scoping intention, I peep game
Niggas always getting so defensive, only in the space for attention
Had to start scoping intention, I peep game
Only in the space for attention, I peep game
