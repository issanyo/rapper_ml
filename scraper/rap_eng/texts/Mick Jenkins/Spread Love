[Intro]
South, south, south, south, south, south side
South side, south side
Spread love, spread love, spread love
(south side, souths side, south side)
South side
Inside, outside, up, right, down

[Verse 1]
Southside 'round 91st and Cottage Grove
I done seen a lot of failures still I found myself a lot of goals
YCA was where I found myself
I started using lead to harness gold
It's way easier to smile, let your local hatin' ass nigga know
Learning patience fast, sippin' slow
All this water in me, I've been water bendin' on the southern side of the 'go
I got martyrs with me, ship is chartered
We've been on a mission, lowkey expedition
Using intuition, losing inhibition just to get
But only inches through the door
To put you on some shit you didn't know
This ain't no poser shit, on some Moses shit
You can see it swimming through the flow
See, I done told you this but gotta show you this
You know actions do a little more
I quit the fantasies and started planting seeds
Tryna usher in a little growth
My nigga we been on our way up, I won't say a lay up
But love is easier than what they show
You should know

[Hook]
And they be asking, "what do love got to do with the point?"
It’s the soothe in your water, it’s the truth in your joint
All that gold is overrated
What do you do with your coin?
We gon' try to spread some love with it
Spread some love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know
Buyin' water by the jug, I'm the plug
What you want, what you need? (Buyin' water...by the jug, I'm the plug, baby, Buyin' water...by the jug, I'm the plug)
Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know
Buyin' water by the jug, I'm the plug
What you want, what you need?
Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love

[Verse 2]
Cause what a nigga really got to say to me, huh?
I just let my little light shine
I guess that's why they wanna throw shade at me, huh?
Cause we'll say, "I love you" and never show that shit
That ain't okay with me, try to spread love on the daily
And the recoil like I got a AK with me
I bet the hater shit don't take you far
Breathe, stretch, shake, let it all go like Ma$e wit me
I brought the water in a mason jar
I'm trynna build, that's masonry in the literal sense
Some people got a literal fence around they heart
Mine's on my sleeve, and I'm out here sleeveless
I ain't finna plead with these niggas to fuck with me
I keep it a buck fifty
Tryna follow in the footsteps of Jesus
Hopin' you can keep up with me

[Bridge]
The basics of his message was love, the basics just loving yourself and projecting that love onto others
Treat the next man like a brother
And I know it's hard if you know his words
Then you know it's God

[Hook]
And they be asking, "what do love got to do with the point?"
It’s the soothe in your water, it’s the truth in your joint
All that gold is overrated
What do you do with your coin?
We gon' try to spread some love with it
Spread some love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know
Buyin' water by the jug, I'm the plug
What you want, what you need?
Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know
Buyin' water by the jug, I'm the plug
What you want, what you need?
Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love
