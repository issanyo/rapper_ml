[Intro: Mick Jenkins]
Word....here we go....here we go uh......tell em

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Fuck with me yall
I mean either way you stuck with me yall
I'm coming at these rap niggas first and for most that's unlucky, yall
Better know it just a mustard seed all, that I ever really needed
Nigga just tryna see Jesus
Yea, sippin' water like it come with different cheeses
All they opinions facetious, its faeces
I got a thesis, a slick dissertation
Our entire species is young and impatient and passive
All at the same damn time, why?
Tried, to kill 'em with the kindness
Hit 'em with the Visine, tried to cure the blindness
Couple coffee beans for the sinus
Folgers, the best part of waking up is the alignment of self of God
And that isn't for a selfish heart
My intention was to flood the scene
I don't never really hug the scene
Yall know I been submarine with this shit
A lil' more Actavis how I lean with this shit
Black as hell, still the cream of this crop
A king, no dream, just Ving Rhames with sick shots
It's a Dawn of the Dead and I feel so alive
Man the free been ahead you can tell by my mind like....

[Aaaaye, Mick Jenkins!] I almost died
