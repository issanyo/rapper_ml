[Intro]
Well I bet ya
Well I bet ya
Well I bet ya
Well I betâ€”

[Verse 1]
Ali's jabbin' them shit feel like hooks
The less you got stuffed in your pocket books
The more these politicians sound like crooks
They give me sloppy looks
They gave us nothing, had to hustle same way coffee cook
Early morning grinding trying to help these niggas wake up
Etch A Sketch flows, I got the shit to shake up
Niggas switching clothes
Niggas even switch their face up
But these clowns could never really switch their make up
Fam' it's in your genes
Fuck is that, Moschin'?
My triple beam onto bigger schemes
I'm on these waves
Don't expect a hand-clap 'cause you swim upstream
I'm expecting sand traps, I be in the green
If we talking green backs I'm back in the black
Been had the formula since Similac
Delicate flows under heavy metal bars but they're still intact
What's a nigga to do?
When you call the police but the trigger's on you
Shit crazy, man

[Chorus]
What's a nigga to do?
'Cause I be streaming black they'll beat me to blue
Put it on TV then tell you what's true
What's a nigga to do?
What's a nigga to do?
When you call the police but the trigger's on you

[Verse 2]
Pull up on 'em shining CeCe Winans with the C notes
Redefining everything the black man denotes
I could devote time
How many times I rewrote lines to get it perfect
Miss me with inertia I'm on dirt
You gon' need assumptions, almost certain
My assertion we gon' see if you got gumption
We gon' see if you gon' play it smart or you gon' be on dumb shit
Wrong answer, we-go-dumb shit
Slow you up on some speed-bump shit
On some ski-jump shit
I'm taking flight 'cause all my flows cold
Setting bars, no pole vault
I never blow smoke unless it's unleaded
I guess you won't know my worst
No unedited stress
Go on wax, I mean

[Chorus]
What's a nigga to do?
When you tell 'em who you is and they be like "Who?"
What's a nigga to do?
Yeah, what's a nigga to do?
'Cause I be streaming black they'll beat me to blue
Put it on TV then tell you what's true
What's a nigga to do?
What's a nigga to do?
