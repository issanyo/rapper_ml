I mean really, this some sick shit ain't it? The man, has lost his mind, almost 'bout as quick as he found it. And it's dark in there- in his mind. He done asked himself questions, to which no answer be. Damned if he know, damned if we don't find out. I don't see no ladder,  but they keep tellin' us to climb out it's dark down here. How is it that we've come to quantify the whole of a man, only by what he looks like in the light? Well, dot dot dittit dot dot dash
