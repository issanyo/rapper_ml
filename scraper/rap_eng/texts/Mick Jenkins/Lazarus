[Verse 1]
For thirty talents most niggas be off balance
Restore it with the writtens my hands will be all callous, in no time
Got up in this bitch but just like parking
They won't validate my shit without a cosign, can't play on both sides
He sleep with both eyes open, I be the token
Black guy in the room full of people screaming "nigga" with me
Now am I wrong if that's sitting with me?
That "fuck it, I wrote it, why hate if they quote it" shit is feeling iffy
And all this water got me feeling Misty, I making mad noise
Tell them flamethrowers I be Blastoise in your city
Dropping dope I could have dealed to Whitney
Spark the piff and then he spit epiphanies, swiftly
The aftermath is fifty-fifty, how you dealing with me
You either healing or you killing, know the weapons you wielding
No prosper, I be no doctor, naw, he much too sickly
You must believe it though, he must be Ripley
Shouts to Bozart how these buckets fitting, homie where your thinking cap at?
Know what you seeking, but I ain't preaching, a deacon of sorts
Hold your head boy they breaching your thoughts
Have your soul for a fucking Jesus piece and a Porsche
A couple years pouring up, send a peace to your corpse
We lost one...just know that I can never get that jaded
If ever a bone to pick, know I'd never be dislocated
I'm off one, burning with the sage for the good vibes
Better know you fucking with some good guys
But if you ever feel to drop sets from your hood at us
Know that in a swift moment we could be Goodfellas, it's not a game
Drop flames like Mario off the flower, cardio for an hour, these niggas ain't got no heart
I see TEN men, but stay with the amens, making better decisions like my wisdom teeth came in
Game man, learning, if I put it in laymens terms you worms couldn't fuck with an early bird at your best
Young Lazarus on the rise, I'm laying it down to rest, and it's free
