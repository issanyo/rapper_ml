[Verse 1: Supa Bwe]
One grandpa white, but my grand daddy black
Off the grandaddy purp- spit the xan in the napkin
Cause no more lackin'
Woke up mad at my vote like what happened?
Look at my pops and revoke all that's happened
He said "Ain't shit feared like a black man"
Music too loud, white man kill a black man
New Year's Eve with your knee on my back, blam!
I feel amazing
Raised in a place where complacence don't hold its own place almost feel like I'm prayin'
Hopin' for grace seeing faces on t-shirts like that could be Teagan
Damn who gon' save 'em, can't let you play 'em
You leave me with no ultimatum
Fuck is you sayin'
Come off them-come off them -come off them benefits
Treat me caucasian

[Hook]
Come off them-come off them benefits
Untriple all of our sentences, treat me caucasian
Get me a loan with no sin attached
Give me that privilege, give me that, treat me caucasian
Come off them-come off them benefits
Come off them-come off them benefits, treat me caucasian
Come off them-come off them benefits
Come off them-come off them benefits, treat me caucasian

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
All in yo' hood with my hoodie on, Skittles and tea
I'm like fourteen, treat me caucasian
Fuck yo' little scholarship, I need a grant nigga, sponsor my Kickstarter
It's damn near a food desert, I need some fresh produce, I need that clear water
Fuck my appearance, up that security clearance
Walk past security, they condescend, it's apparent
All of these people are parrots, treat me caucasian
Come off that privilege, my nigga I need connections at Yale
Y'all talking doctrines or bail? Just need a doctor, I know you can tell
Know that you hurting me police be taking like thirty eternities
They won't do that shit up North, I'm tall as fuck
They still look down on the boy even though they still gotta look up, treat me caucasian
Come off them-come off them benefits I need them premium wages
Come off them benefits I got the drive, nigga come off them brakes
Come off the hate, treat me caucasian

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
Please don't you misunderstand, don't need no bands
Fuck yo' little check, I just want your respect, me and all of my mans
We be the culture
Best do a fact check, we be the future
We just need access
Come off them benefits, fuck what you been on
Black man the president we shoula been on them podiums
Potus ain't nothing but a sendoff, ain't nothing but a sendoff
All in yo' hood with my hoodie on, Skittles and tea
I'm like fourteen, treat me caucasian
All in yo' hood with my hoodie on
All in yo' hood with my hoodie on
