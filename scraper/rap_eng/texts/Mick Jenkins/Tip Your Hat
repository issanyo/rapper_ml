[Intro]
I'm just trynna be happy
(Sniffles)
Groovy

[Chorus]
Tip yo' hat for a G if you fuckin' with that chill
Blowin' by yo' dolo and you fuckin' with that kill
Live yo' life in slow-mo and you promo what is real
They can't tell you what to wear because you free

[Verse 1]
Tell 'em bout the J. Crew socks and the Tommy Hilfiger sweater
Middle of a Alabama summer, field nigga weather
Value Village trippin' 'bout to catch a deal with the cheddar
Wicker Park pickin' niggas catchin' deals with the leather
Loafers I was rockin'
They were jazzy, I was stockin'
Had a horsey on the jacket
Didn't have another option
[?] bracelets on my wrist I can't remember when I copped 'em
I been fuckin' with that fly shit for the longest, fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Tell 'em that i'm straight up out the Chi
And i'm fly
91st & Langley, neighborhood guy
Went to Hirsch, off the 9
Seen to many in a herse from the 9
Lot of busted holes couple of them fine
Nevermind
Afterschool, we was cool
Chillin' on the Grove after 'bout a year
Shit changed, started gettin' chose
Seen a homie shot
On the spot
Seen shit stole
Seen a couple fights
When it's hot, niggas get froze
That's just how it goes
In the hood
Mama taught me good
Niggas didn't try me, understood
Wish a nigga would
Shorties on the block
On my jock
I was feelin' good
Got a couple numbers at a party then I told them hoes to juke, fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Aw
Oh
(Put them shoes on and keep my paper runnin')
Yeah, listen up
(Put them shoes on and keep my paper runnin')
Tell 'em bout the A-Life loafers with the tassels
Camo on the cargos, laces be a hassle
Tell 'em haters all about this vintage shit i'm thriftin
We don't listen
Save yo money, this a different type of pimpin'
Can you buy that?

[Skit]
It was $35,000, $35,000 cash money
Wha-No, I get one-$35,000+1, right?
The one I gave you
No you gave me 6, alright?
That was one
I had one that was 6 and the $35,000 + 6 + 1 makes 7. $35,000 and 7, alright? Motherfucker, can you buy that?

[Chorus]
