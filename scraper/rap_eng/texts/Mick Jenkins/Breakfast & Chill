[Hook: Supa Bwe]
Can I come over, can I come crash?
Can I come over, would you be down with that? (Down with that)
I been on the road, I'm finally home
I know that I'm late callin back but I'm callin back (Callin back)
Can I come over can I come chill? (Chill)
I'll keep it real if you real I can promise that (promise that)
Smoking a square, alone on my stairs (Stash)
Thinkin about what we gon do waitin for the cab

[Refrain: Supa Bwe]
I'll keep it real if you real
I'll keep you up if you real I'm forreal
Like forever and I don't mean Netflix and chill I'm talking sex before breakfast then breakfast and chill

[Verse: Mick Jenkins]
Just touched down back in town I been on the road
I been on a wave, I been turnin lead into solid gold
I mean I know that you see me, I know that you know that this ain't CGI and a nigga not in front of no green screen
No special effects, know I wouldn't misdirect like that
Imma keep it a buck witchu
I fuck with you
Manu Ginobli shit how I handle the pearls and they roll off the wrist tap backboard baby I'm just tryna lay up with you
May-be smoke a blunt witchu
(I mean) I prefer papers
Watch the smoke dance like a stove dance
And I space till it ain't nothin but vapors
Between us, water the cleanest
Have mercy from Jesus
I practice the telekinesis so I ain't gotta say it the feelings cerebral
(I know)
These cooped up emotions can get put in motion yeah I'm tryna reap what I sow
(I'm tryna reap what I sow)
Sowin seeds and so it seems
You concede to this poetry
Flow-etry and some weed baby you can grow with me just, know with me that, all you ever, got to do is, chill
Sowin seeds and so it seems
You concede to this poetry
Flow-etry and some weed baby you can grow with me just, know with me, all you ever, got to do is, chill

[Hook: Supa Bwe]
Can I come over, can I come crash?
Can I come over, would you be down with that? (Down with that)
I been on the road I'm finally home
I know that I'm late callin back but I'm callin back (Callin Back)
Can I come over can I come chill? (Chill)
I'll keep it real if you real I can promise that (promise that)
Smoking a square alone on the stairs
Thinkin about what we gon do waitin for the cab

[Refrain: Supa Bwe]
I'll keep it real if you real
I'll keep you up if you real I'm forreal
Like forever and I don't mean Netflix and chill
I'm talking sex before breakfast then breakfast and chill
