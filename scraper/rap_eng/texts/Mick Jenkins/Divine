[Verse 1: Kyle Bent]
It's been an awful long journey (ay ay ay)
And I still feel like ain't no one heard me, yeah
I ain't worried bout it, I ain't in a hurry (ay)
I'm just tryna uncover the treasure y'all forgot what buried
Coz I think the world deserve it
I been, tryna, spread a message
Don't mind the riches but I swear to God it isn't bout me no more
There ain't really time for me to sleep no more
We done entered in the scene, this ain't a dream no more
But my generation...still sleeping
Politickin' with the demons, they ain't free, oh no
The world's are tryna tell him how to think, oh Lord
Don't conform, don't you know that you don't fit their mould
You are different, listen
Baby please don't waste your whole existence, livin'
For someone else's visions and ambitions
Itchin', to see the side of life that you been missin'
It don't gotta be that way
Hidden riches, hide inside you, you just need to dig in, get it
Manifest the life that you envision
Bring your thoughts to life coz in this life there ain't no limits, they just made you think that way
You never know how far you can take it until you do it
The life you want is only a theory until it's proven
The people round you won't see your greatness until you use it so I took that first step, ain't surprised that it made a movement
A decade in the making, the way I'm living's amazing
Flying to different states everyday the scenery changes
But really I'm just playing my part and changing the wavelength and that's gon' take some patience, but trust me man, we gon' make it, ey

[Hook: Kyle Bent]
I...need me a life where all is alright
Yeah everyone's good and fine
No need to ask why the sun never shines, we always see the brighter side
Open your eyes, this life is a dream, does that come by surprise?
There ain't no high too high, you can do anything, don't you know you're divine?
Yeah, I'm in my zone right now (right now)
We up and we won't come down (come down)
Everything that I said, it happened
Manifested it like it was magic
I'm in my zone right now (right now)
This feeling like home right now (right now)
Put on for my homies and feed the family
But I ain't stopping 'till I heal the masses, oh man

[Bridge: Kyle Bent (and Mick Jenkins)
(In the OO!) In the Uber
In the Uber (in the...)
In the Uber (in the OO, OO, OO, OO!)
In the Uber (In the Uber)
In the Uber (In the Uber)
In the Uber (In the Uber)
In the..(In the...)


[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
In the Uber, on my way, nigga twisting broccoli
With my shorty, I'm no dog, but she pretty foxy, she don't smoke
She still rock my high ainâ€™t ever did the Rocsi, Terrence J.
Niggas taking shots, that's just paparazzi, let 'em spray
Let 'em spray, man it's time to eat
I'm a Jew about my dollar, I'm a Nazi bout the beef
Ain't no jewellry round my collar for your soul, these collard greens don't come with pork
I found my spot I'm Rosa Parks, I'm on this bus
I need a fork, this shit a buffet
And I don't to be rude, but I been in these waters, everywhere I look I see food
Crabs in a barrel, at one point my nigga me too
But I had to get out that jam, before I became R2D2
May the force be with you
Drink more water, please forgive me if I force the issue
Off these trees I'm wastin' paper like it's toilet tissue
Point the pistol at the one who tongue and cheek, I'm writing checks but man I'm coming at they mills, I keep it Meek
I'm in the Uber (in the uber, in the uber, in the uber)
So gon' take a ride with a nigga to the future (to the future, to the future)
They like to lie to the masses hoping one day I don't loot ya (I don't loot ya,)

But I ain't stopping 'till I heal the masses, oh man

Alright, alright, alright
But I ain't stopping 'till I heal the masses, oh man
Alright, alright, alright
But I ain't stopping 'till I heal the masses, oh man
