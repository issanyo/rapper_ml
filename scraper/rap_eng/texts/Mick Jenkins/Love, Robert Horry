[Intro]
Love is free
Love is free
Uh

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Photos of my life through these allegory
Shots from the corner like I'm Robert Horry
Or Anne Leibovitz you need a bigger name
Or that nigga from City of God, I forget his name
Be too worried how the picture fit the frame sometimes
Celebrating 'fore you even win the game, what's the basis?
Euro stepping, switching lanes, it's so easy to forget about the basics
How we pace it on the daily
But it sure is grapes that sun dried, it's raisins in the sun, my eyes is watching God
No need for hesitation
Always moving with conviction even if they gon' convict me
Yeah they hit me with a sentence all that did was teach me patience
All I did was finish Trees & Truths and start The Water[s]
And I wrote every single word like a court reporter's attention to detail
I can see the bullshit in all of the retails
Still I copped the Yeezys though, I bought them hoes resale
Grabbed all the clothes that I could like Ezal
Yeah we fly, throw a piece sign, I mean well
The cream rise, I need the weed high
Oh, we fell from the sky onto these waves
They see shore with sea shells
Most don't see straight at all
But the money on the way like a mail in rebate
The mall ain't never been the place
To ball, it's Free Nation
Aw, it's Free Nation

[Verse 2: J-Stock]
I found peace in the heart of the storm
I had to get released 'till inner demons was gone
Always kept to myself, never fit in with the norm
All I had was the pain, he tried give me the calm
All I had was the darkness 'till he gave me  a dawn
I was 12 with no parents then he gave me my mom
22 no direction then he gave me the jawn
Then I linked with the Nation and they helped me move on
Now I'm staring directly at the sun 'till my eyes go blind
Nigga never understand, the purpose is so divine
I'm way too far out, you can never change my mind
It's a half an eighth later the thoughts are just too inclined
Pictures too intense, make you have to press rewind
Cause everything's microwaved, they don't ever take the time
Free give you what you need, for spirit, body, and mind
If keeping it real is wrong then I be committing crimes
Every line hit like a projectile from the nine
Take a piece out your melon, put a tingle down your spine
It's how you know it's the truth
The feeling can't be defined
My nigga it's FreeNation, we water turned into wine

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins]
Give you photos of my life through these allegory
Lotta niggas talk but they ain't got a story
We out here taking shots from the corner like a young Robert Horry
I don't need to hear the comments for me
I'm in another lane
5AM, I'm on another plane
If you get the picture you can peep it through whatever frame

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Love is free
Love is free
Love is free
(Love? Love is loving someone)
(I don't know what love is)
