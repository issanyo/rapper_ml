[Hook]
This is for my niggas, my niggas
Love my niggas, ride for my niggas
This is for my niggas, my niggas
My niggas

[Verse 1]
Back, you ain't never met a iller crew
The realest niggas middle finger to the cynical
Motherfuckers who ain't riding with the team
Shouts to all the niggas that are riding with the team
They tell me you look tired I'm as tired as it seems
Cause you don't really sleep when you're trying to live a dream
Nah, you just party with your niggas
Parlay with the girls, stop and take a picture
For the niggas who just know you about to blow up
The only ones eating all this food for thought
You're sick enough to throw up
See this is for the niggas who won't never want to grow up
Veyrons if pay on with a box of Fruit Roll-Ups, now hold up
Tell me we don't kick it
Tell me I ain't blowing money fast when I'm thriftin'
Tell me I ain't who they want to be
And that's why they hating
On a motherfucker just because he different, nigga listen

[Bridge 1]
This is for my second-hand shopper, quarter-ounce coppers
OG3 and LA Dodger rockers
You're cool as fuck

And this is for my niggas with subs who be banging out classics
And honeys who got ass in the past tense
You're cool as fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back, if they ever call me jaded
This is for my niggas who was there before we made it
The homies who was down before the free was elevated
Now the free is escalating everybody want to stare
Things are getting sunny now these niggas want to share
But I can care less, they never impress
I could do it better coming off the top like hair, necks
Otherwise, I'm just posting with my niggas
Roll another blunt up while I'm joking with my niggas
Stepping through the door that I have opened with my niggas
And I'm trying to do this shit when I'm old as shit my nigga

[Bridge 2]
Cause I'm pretty sure they love my style, love my sound
Love my team like I love Chi-town
That's why they're cool as fuck

And it's probably cause I rep my own, dress my own
Love my bros, middle finger to hoes
That's why we cool as fuck

[Bridge 1]
