[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Since Oakwood I’ve been moving this dope
Trying to give you this truth
So potent every line is quote
Or a hit, I’m a fiend
Niggas scratching like I been in a dj booth
I know that you ain’t heard it like this
From the southside expect it to be so uncouth or aloof
Perception has made you believe that it’s easier to cope with in a coop
You don’t want this smoke roll the words I wrote
Puff puff til the joint go poof
They shooting over there where the youngings playing games
Duck duck better run those goose
I know that you don’t want no news
A little too loose with yours better choose your sword
Much wiser, I tell these niggas drink more water
Be the only time I ever dumb it down when I tell these niggas think more harder
A CPS scholar, pardon I think more charter
Mama had to think more father, pops never really thought about it
Cops only even seen one side, book us off profiles, nigga don’t doubt it
Niggas already know mine, show time, spit a couple clothes lines
Value village superfluous cosigned homie
Seven nine king drive picture me rolling
Southside where they shoot magazines
I’m alive never picture me posing, nah
I ain’t never did GQ, and I ain’t never claimed GD
I’m just with my folks
Know I got a ginger ale with my smoke
Know I got a peg cuff with my loafs
Do it for the Free even when I’m broke
College Dropout, he drive slow
Man we like the 18 tracks like an 8 ball
I been spitting napalm, tell me do you feel it
Tell me is it burning, tell me if you learning
Tell me can you tell if that nigga is the realest
Nigga I’m a realist
So many layers that it’s really bout how many you’re peeling back
Give it to the people with appealing facts
Make it so loud that you can still smell it from like 3 blocks down when they seal the pack
Send it through the mail, you don’t get it til like 3 years later
And it still a smack [?]
Some like how they brew and seal the jack
How can you hate on that?
Next best out the Chi and I told y’all I ain’t leaving no room for no debate on that
You can bet on that
I’ma keep dropping bombs, I ain’t really gotta flex for that
He don’t stretch for that, he don’t even has the chest for that
So if you wonder where to check for a nigga on the shit
Go to DJbooth.net for that
