[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
If you knew better you niggas would do better
They want it less complicated, I’m never gon’ lose letters
Not even for new cheddar
Don’t feel the need to beef it up when I abuse lettuce
Thrifty, dub print shorts, shooting the breeze
Like a drive-by, young fly guy that’s never gon’ lose feathers
Cop the purple or the green when the BB King blues get us
Couple that with my height and the paces at which I write
And it’s safe to say that I make enough music for two niggas
Make it for you niggas, hope that you catch the message
Hope that between the flash and the flare you pause and reflect it
I’m hoping checks get collected like a Nike shoe fetish
I’m shooting for New York Times, right now we newsletters
Not enough paper, way too many issues
Sweat from the grind require way too many tissues
Get a towel in here, F-R, can a nigga get a vowel in here?
Matter fact two E’s, matter fact that’s FREE
Bumping facts through these tracks
And these tracks get assembled like a factory
Ain’t no stopping or attacking me, it’s Mick Jenk-word
