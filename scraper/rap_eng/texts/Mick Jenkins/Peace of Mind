[Hook: The O'My's]
I wake up every morning wondering why
To myself I'm always telling half-lies
I see it in her eyes every time we meet
Want some peace of mind, you can count on me
(x2)

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
And I been on the same shit that I was on in '09
Never did the pig and I do not fuck with bovine either
Man, check the style, I could spit a couple clotheslines
Hang 'em out to dry, give a fuck about a cosign feature
I could teach about bars like the DEA
Talk green with the PGA
Spark a stogie, I'm so up to par
So up to par, these niggas bogey
All that flashy shit is bogus
Niggas show me what you produce
Like vegetarian grocery carts
From the heart and it's mostly art
With a flow that break ankles much worser than Kobe's are
What a holy art
And Jason Sellers should have went to Juilliard
I know too many talented minds to not prevail
South side just a plot detail, rebel
And it's designed, I hope you never think it's cop retail
Free nation rebel you cannot resell, so
Over the wave, I just hope that you can follow the flow
The flood's coming, you can't just follow the boat
It's an art nigga
Provide the light when it gets dark
Just let the vibes be the spark
Chilling, chiefing in the park, we was four deep
Did the fin like it was shark week
Via Rosa brought the saffron and parsley
I'm hardly anything like anyone you thought you knew
People always gonna talk what they thought they do, but

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins]
I told you how I do it and it's like that
Told you how I do it
Man I told you how I do it and it's like that

[Verse 2: Jayln]
I said bring in the priest, your priest look like a lawyer
I say this is a seance, they say this shit is recording
Tom-ay-to is tom-ah-to, this is apples over oranges
There's levels to this shit, you ain't trying to pay for the courses
No second chances, paper diplomas
Need money for bail or a little something for abortions
My south side niggas don't take out money around these poor kids
Matter of fact, don't bring nothing around these poor kids
Jesus Christ, I'm on the island, they the ocean
Which he advised, blind leading blind, while niggas focused
Watch out, eyes on the blinds for niggas rolling
They gave roadie five by five just over coca
That's 25 by the time my man turned 25
Off a hand full of zips, and some shit like twenty dimes
How can we get a grip when it's handled by design?
When I'm out here on my grind
Straight, we just trying to scrape to it, even slate
Say, who else could I blame, those I lead astray
Wait, this ain't okay in my bathing ape
Jake, niggas wanna play give they ass a game
