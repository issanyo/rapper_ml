[Chorus]
With THEMPeoples moving a piano
Choppin’ all these bars, trappin’ out the bando
Money bag, money bag
Patient, breakin’ profits with my kin-folk
Plus I been payin’ tithes, I need that ten-fold

[Verse]
I’m still on this ten-speed, touching these tempos
Eatin’ this tempeh
I feel like Dikembe, I never been dunked on
Young nigga can’t go
Chip on my shoulder, this queso is not comin’ in by the case-load
We was rippin’ samples by the crate-load
Pen do the paint job, never need MAACO
Even when the peso splittin’ up pay so

[Chorus]
With THEMPeoples moving a piano
Choppin’ all these bars, trappin’ out the bando
Money bag, money bag
Patient, breakin’ profits with my kin-folk
Plus I been payin’ tithes, I need that ten-fold

[Bridge]
Relax, smoke
Chill with a nigga, don’t tell the streets that I’m broke
Deal with a nigga
As long as you feeling’ the vibes
Imma keep dealin’ the vibes
Want you to feel it
As long as you feeling’ the vibes
Imma keep dealin’ the vibes
Want you to feel it
Relax, smoke
Chill with a nigga, don’t tell the streets that I’m broke
Deal with a nigga
As long as you feeling’ the vibes
Imma keep dealin’ the vibes
Want you to feel it
As long as you feeling’ the vibes
Imma keep dealin’ the vibes
Want you to feel it

[Chorus]
With THEMPeoples moving a piano
Choppin’ all these bars, trappin’ out the bando
Money bag, money bag
Patient, breakin’ profits with my kin-folk
Plus I been payin’ tithes, I need that ten-fold
