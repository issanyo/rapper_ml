[Chorus: Mick Jenkins + sample]
'Cause you never met another nigga quite like me
A Southside nigga, way too Free
A groovy nigga that's way too G


[Verse 1]
In the cut, twisting lemon kush and jasmine
Lemon verbena candles burn slow
Watch the verbs flow
I spit that fire they can feel it in the third row
He shoot deep, heroine, Larry Bird flow
They got your silver spoon heated
Treat it like it's a product
The doctors approved, need it, read it
Over here, it's ginger ale for your hoes
I don't want they souls
I move around if they want the gold
I can't fade it

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins + sample]
'Cause you never met another nigga quite like me
A Southside nigga, way too Free
A groovy nigga that's way too G

[Bridge]
It's the leaves, motherfucker
It's the leaves, motherfucker
Tell me, did you get to see 'em fall, motherfucker?
Tell me, did you get to see 'em change, colors?
It's the leaves, motherfucker
Tell me, did you get to see the truth fall?
Did you niggas see it?

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins + sample]
'Cause you never met another nigga quite like me
A Southside nigga, way too Free
A groovy nigga that's way too G

[Verse 2]
Floral prints for the nature enthusiasts
Caramel apple spice with a Hennessy Nubian
We talk rap shit
She do not smoke but I'm rolling a fat spliff
We talk passions
See we just trying to recognize the distractions
Distract em, divide your whole team is just a fraction of what I might do
Spit it full of solder, they speaking that tight, too
And send this bitch up with these haikus
Fuck with my famo

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins + sample]
'Cause you never met another nigga quite like me
A Southside nigga, way too Free
A groovy nigga that's way too G
