[Intro]
"That energy and that vibration shit is like, really real. Shit is really really real, know what I'm saying? Contagious in the whole thing. So we have to have an intent when we come to the studio, to be in this right frame of mind..."

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
All of this mercy on me, I've been trying to pray for my enemy
Hearing your words, does not mean I ignore your energy (energy)
I am not God, ain't judging unless you come get at me
But you be for sure, I am not gonna ignore your energy
Your energy, we feel your vibe (feel your vibe)
We feel the lows, we feel the highs (feel the highs)
And when it's off (when it's off), we feel that too (I feel that too)
We feel that too (I feel that too), we feel that too (I feel that too)

[Verse 1: Saba]
Uh, this is not a myth or a sitcom
Stand up, sit down
Hold my chair like a bar mitzvah
Even though I'm 6'1"
I don't wanna kick it with them kick rocks
Yelling in the mic, I'm hella pissed off
Even had clip it like I'm Chris Paul
They forgot about him like dementia
I'ma leader, I got 'em like a mentor
Ignore energy, they're all finicky
So little of this shit is important to me
It's so interesting
How many nigga my bro now
But they ain't no kin to me
And cousins out the woodwork
It's like a rat race, who's out the hood first
Niggas fictitious, causing friction
I do not do inertia
But I read the vibes
Like I play the xylophone and my solo coming
And I read the vibes
Even as a kid when had to ask for company over
Keep a compass on me 'cause I know we heading now and death is around the corner
Family ties
Cut down in your [?] and now you part like [?]

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
All of this mercy on me, I've been trying to pray for my enemy
Hearing your words, does not mean I ignore your energy (energy)
I am not God, ain't judging unless you come get at me
But you be for sure, I am not gonna ignore your energy
Your energy, we feel your vibe (feel your vibe)
We feel the lows, we feel the highs (feel the highs)
And when it's off (when it's off), we feel that too (I feel that too)
We feel that too (I feel that too), we feel that too (I feel that too)

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
We feel that like
Touching the wall for the light in the dark
I've been finding a spark in the spaces
Apart from where niggas been hating
I'm starting to face all the music
Amusing to think I was bending for energy
That was confusing and using me
That's just abusive, I'm used to it though
Niggas intruded, I treated 'em like, thieves in the night
Hip to the fraud, since Midnight Marauder
Rock of Gibraltar, sipping this mineral water
I don't do vodka, funny, I'm back on my pinnacle
Allergic to bullshit, I keep me a Benadryl
You down to face pollen when you in the field
Hope negative feelings get intercepted
'Fore they turn into projections
You intellect isn't enough to protect you
They'll disrespect you, just to misdirect you
Had me missing lessons, had me missing blessings
Had me stressing
Now my little light is incandescent
Now a nigga skin is iridescent
You can't get this glow with acquiescence
I ain't been there since an adolescent
I been asking questions

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
All of this mercy on me, I've been trying to pray for my enemy
Hearing your words, and I mean I ignore your energy (energy)
I am not God, ain't judging unless you come get at me
But you be for sure, I am not gonna ignore your energy
Your energy, we feel your vibe (feel your vibe)
We feel the lows, we feel the highs (feel the highs)
And when it's off (when it's off), we feel that too (I feel that too)
