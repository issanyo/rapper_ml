[Hook: Sean Deaux]
I need blessed assurance
Treat me just like the weed
Make me feel important
The higher up the better I feel (yeah yeah)
Backwood vacations while I'm in the field
Like bang, bang, bang
I need to get away and smoke
When I need to free my mind I smoke (yeah yeah)
We light up like Christmas time and smoke (yeah yeah)
Kush-ups that's exercise and smoke
Like bang, bang, bang
I-I need to get away

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Puff puff then pass
Don't boof the wood
Just promise me that
We got all the smoke nigga
You don't want no smoke nigga
I can't even smoke witcha'
Unequally yolked
I been makin' omelettes of niggas
Shit gon' shatter gon' crumble when I concentrate fuckin' with the conscious of niggas
That type of flower uncommon
Taste it when I smell it my palate is polished
My roses are budded and I'm tryna' cross-pollinate
Niggas still sleepin' cause the indica dominate
Know that I cannot accommodate Reggie
Vapors get to dancin' on the ceilin' 'fore they billow out the window floatin' straight up to the heavens though
I hold it in and let it go

[Hook: Sean Deaux]
I need blessed assurance
Treat me just like the weed
Make me feel important
The higher up the better I feel (yeah yeah)
Backwood vacations while I'm in the field
Like bang, bang, bang
I need to get away and smoke
When I need to free my mind I smoke (yeah yeah)
We light up like Christmas time and smoke (yeah yeah)
Kush-ups that's exercise and smoke
Like bang, bang, bang
I-I need to get away and smoke
