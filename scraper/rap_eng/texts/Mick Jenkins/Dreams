(On god my Nigga)
"On God"

[Verse 1: Rich Robbins]
This the life we chose
Pick a lane pick a road
Pickin any in the city where they bettin
On the kiddies who be the Rose
Have a 50 gone, never seen 50
But this song more about how we stay froze
Midwest cold, missed just Monroe
Blessed me lord, my sins, my soul
It's about time you roll
Need to get high before I reach my lows
Suicide thoughts cover thoughts with the most
Just bost a post with emotional cost
West side Philly
I was raised out the boast
Better get hard when you reach for the heart
And instead you get hoes that can reach the throat, right
Just let a nigga float, right

[Chorus: Rich Robbins]
I been dreamin'
Oh, oh I been dreamin'
Baby girl, yea, I been dreamin'
Oh, can't you tell I been dreamin'
I swear to god I been dreamin'
Oh oh, Oh I been dreamin'
Ah ah, I been dreamin'
Oh oh, Oh I been dreamin', right?

I been dreamin'
Oh, oh I been dreamin'
Baby girl, yea, I been dreamin'
Oh, can't you tell I been dreamin'
I swear to god I been dreamin'
Oh oh, Oh I been dreamin'
Ah ah, I been dreamin'
Oh oh, Oh I been dreamin', right?

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Come in and see me get parched
Dap in no less than corduroy slippers
Keep the flow hot
In the hood and I keep seeing robots
Bust out black young nigga caught both shots
Momma couldn't smile with botox
See I ain't really tryna cross over
Just get straight to the bucket like a pro hop
There's a lot of nigga's style that don't flop
Spit the picture crisp with no crop
I can't go
Crossfires with bullets that'll never bow to no chief
Cross joints with hashish, we passin' the kief
It's crossovers of source covers of crash in the street
Do anything for the dream even if you can't handle
We want life as a beach and our feet in them sandles
Luchini pourin' out the sky, been dreamin' like Camp Lo

[Chorus: Rich Robbins]
I been dreamin'
Oh, oh I been dreamin'
Baby girl, yea, I been dreamin'
Oh, can't you tell I been dreamin'
I swear to god I been dreamin'
Oh oh, Oh I been dreamin'
Ah ah, I been dreamin'
Oh oh, Oh I been dreamin', right?

I been dreamin'
Oh, oh I been dreamin'
Baby girl, yea, I been dreamin'
Oh, can't you tell I been dreamin'
I swear to god I been dreamin'
Oh oh, Oh I been dreamin'
Ah ah, I been dreamin'
Oh oh, Oh I been dreamin', right?

[Breakdown: William McGee Howard "Children Hold On"]
Woah, yea
Children hold on
Believe
Children hold on to your dreams
Believe in love
Let love be the light to show -

[Verse 3: Rich Robbins]
Brown bodies dyin'
Let's say it blatantly
We drown in drugs
I fill our lungs to fill the vacancies
I pray my brother's face don't end up on that Gucci tee
They melt my melanin and use the gold to fuel the indrustry
Like we don't know these things
Like we not smart niggas
We some 'make some art' niggas
We 'no play your part' niggas
We real cool and we skip school
And come alive at night niggas
We dreamin' ass niggas
Our mother's hate our decisions
My niggas live with addictions
I hit that blunt and my world disappear
I live inside nimbus

Our mother's hate our decisions
My niggas live with addictions
I hit that blunt and my world disappear
I live inside nimbus
Right?

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
I been dreamin'
Oh, oh I
I been dreamin'
Oh, oh I
I been dreamin'
Oh I been dreamin'

Right?
