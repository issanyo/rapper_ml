[Intro]
"Work? Fuck you wanna be on the streets talkin' about what you do for, and you ain't doin' it. Fuck you wanna be in the club lookin' like you do somethin' for, and you ain't really do it. Fuck you wanna stand next to a nigga like me that really do it, and you don't do it
The fuck from about me man. Feel me? I think Imma have a beautiful bitch next to me.  A nigga all over my fuckin' shit, what you talkin' about, nigga? Man, get the fuck off me man.  Write a rap man, or spit a si- go eat or so- go make a beat or somethin'. You niggas lookin' hungry, eat you some..."

[Verse]
Hella underrated these days, that shit the worst
Makes me think back to that Hov line
The meek shall inherit the earth
What, You was thinkin' Mr. Carter? nah
I been singin' like his daughter name
I heard him talk about the Audemar
Fuck the watches, I'm just talkin' timing
Fuck the tactful, I ain't talkin' timid
Servin' love, we been talkin' tennis
I ain't even gotta talk advantage
What's the budget? Now I'm talkin' Spanish
Fuck a nigga tryna talk opinions, I like to deal with the factual
I like to deal with the actual
I hear the words, but I like to focus on actions
Only the real in my faction
Flushed out the fakes, now we fractions of that
You know, fuck it, it happens
Rolled up the gas and walked out the crib like fuck it, fashion
This ain't nothin' but some trees from last year
Hit the scheme on my VC niggas
On the same schemes from last year
And I'm light years past you

[Outro]
"Seen you bro him up in black Saab, the gold bbs, man
I said, this nigga, this nigga's really makin this money and his really makin money, man, You understand?"
"Ay, it ain't just about the money. It's not. You know what it's about?"
