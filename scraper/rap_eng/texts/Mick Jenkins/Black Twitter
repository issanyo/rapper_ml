[Chorus]
If I was president
Head of the state getting head in the residence
Real nigga represent, fuck politicians black twitter my delegates
If I was president
Head of the state getting head in the residence
Real nigga represent, fuck politicians black twitter my delegates

[Verse 1: Mikeyblackkk]
Speak to all my people, they never been seen as equal
Niggas trapped in the trap, I reach 'em and make 'em peaceful
From Mexico back to Africa, [?] when I'm writing
Even let a gringo take a listen if he lighting up
I been enlightened since y'all niggas was lighting up
Kept my mind sharp, they cut the nooses when they tighten up
The young messiah turnin' water into fire
I been curvin' curvy bitches leave 'em burn with desire
Got independence I don't earn I just require
But rappin ain't workin' out and I'm too young to be retired
Inspired by all the bars and never gave you a cop out
They say I'm old school and I say i've been a drop-out
Y'all don't consider it trash lyrics you literate
Know that I read minds and you niggas make me illiterate
I was eleven and reminiscing in hindsight
All they gave me was lemons, I turned that shit into limelight

[Chorus]
If I was president
Head of the state getting head in the residence
Real nigga represent, fuck politicians black twitter my delegates
Head of the state getting head in the residence
Real nigga represent, fuck politicians black twitter my delegates
If I was president

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
The last of the Mohicans, they thought we was some hoes
Either get what I'm owed or it's no speaking
Collection play but I'm no Decan, do no pills but I'm so geeked its hard to believe
Like the magic tricks you scripted see the cards up your sleeve
Shit is lame on David Blaine had my heart on my sleeve
Heart on my soul, heart in my steez
Piss on the flag, I can't hold all this water on me
So tell, it i think they lack the methodics, niggas way too lethargic
Because making melodics ain't really moving no products
I know you thinking about hustle but I ain't talking narcotics
Because that's expected
So A1 niggas are collected, every bar was a Xan I got 47 for ya
Feel my De la Soul through these De La Hoya's
Like flurries, might have your wife pipe worried
You got shooters but they not quite curry's with the long range

[Verese 3: Mikeyblackkk]

I run tracks like slaves runnin' from capture
Black to the bone so my ankles never fracture
I'll pump rock if I need it a little faster
You can't be sayin' nigga if we would have called you master
That's out of pocket, I'mma leave you sniffin' rotten
I'll rock versace if a white man will pick the cotton
I'm back at it created from black magic
Revolutions isn't televised, homie we hash tag it
I see your recycled flows, imma have to trash bag it
And bring you to Wonderland, just follow the black rabbit
I'd right my wrongs but I couldn't get it typed out
I'm underground so every bitch around me gettin' piped out
I send a message every verse my new label answers
These niggas eat off the game with no table manners
Prophecy spoke of a nigga with fable grammar
Who'd make a table dancer take a seat for the spangled banner
