[Intro]
We
Be feelin' like I'm French

[Chorus]
We, real cool
We, left school
We, lurk late
We, sing sin
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, lurk late
We, sing sin
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

[Verse 1]
Quick fast, quick fast, plus one that's quick math
Quicksand, sink slow for some quick cash
Quit that, got a better chance with Bitcoin
Big banks see you stuntin' and this shit's deep
Crypt keep and now you're fucking with the blockchain
Speed race until we running out of octane
I brought loud, you brought Reggie that's a mismatch
We not on the same page, it's just no, no way
Can't sauce through the beef this ain't Bolognese
Don't get mad because I roll it straight
Bowl a strike, new pens and I feel I need some more again
Tryna write while they bite, I'm not Holyfield
Disagree with the nigga but they know you real
They gon' see for themselves, know I told you so
Can't teach a young nigga, he don't want to know
Could be a flower, he don't want to grow

[Chorus]
Real cool
We, real cool
We, left school
We, lurk late
We, sing sin
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, lurk late
We, sing sin
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

[Verse 2]
Pardon my judgement, and its worth
I'm trying to be reflective, don't mean to be overt with it
All this shit connected no cursive, it's more coercive than simple calligraphy
Figure me, a whole different nigga from what I was meant to be
A whole different mental, it was stencil, that was incidental
This was way before followers when I was following
Wasn't until a bit later when I started flowering
And I needed pollination not your validation
'Til they tell you, you ain't shining that's the provocation
I be speaking on the humble in the conversation
Who would think that I still copped a Cuban link?
It was thrifting, now it's Barney's it's that newer mink
Barnes & Noble savage army nigga, who you read?
One stroke of the pen for your eulogy
Usually, if not shit new to me
You niggas be too cool for me
Too many social rules for me
That superficial shit ain't fooling me
I'm in the party and this nigga think he's schooling me

[Chorus]
Real cool
We, real cool
We, left school
We, lurk late
We, sing sin
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, lurk late
We, sing sin
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

[Outro]
You niggas be too cool for me
Too many social rules for me
