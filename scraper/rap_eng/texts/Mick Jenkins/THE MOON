[Hook: Sean Deaux]
So much drama in my life, same time I'm winnin'
Oh, too many women, still I'm constantly sinnin'
Winnin' at the same time
But the devil's grinnin' at the same time
I can see the light, it's guiding me through [?]
Blinded by the night, it's something I could never do
But something's gotta change
Like the moon

[Bridge: theMIND]
Does your liquor spilleth dark?
Do you not wrap your tree in bark?
Why do you go, so far, to stay?
Why do you go, why do you go, why do you go
Why do you go, why do you go, so far, to stay?

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Good Lord, I just want to see you undress
You can strut at times, you can strut at times
Cause she shining in that sundress right now
Got a lot of marijuana around me
Can you see the path when the fog thick?
Can't you see the cash is costly?
You crash and there's no Farrah Fawcett
I'm forcing the truth as a topic
Truth is, I've never been this clueless before
Got a lot of questions, and I ain't gonna pretend like I've knew this before
Like, what about when that money come?
Because I've never felt like Judas before
Just a shooter with two pistols showing
Got sin in my sights but I'm losing my form

[Verse 2: theMIND]
Your face will opaque into the dusk
Waves often crash caused by your lust
They'll never touch you
Nor, I will love you
But if you fall we fall and turn to nothing
The fucking struggle
Face keep changing like the moon
You revolve around my world
I can't spin without you here
I said, you revolve around my world
I just sin without you here


[Verse 3: Dally Auston]
Huh? Huh?
Money come, money go, I'm all for it
Don't stop that forfeit, oh God
My God, why bad bitch
Am I with a winner or a sinner, my bitch a cold killer
Slick ruler, my nigga, like Slick the Ruler
My sunflower on that white dress
No the stars stay close to the moon while
Them bright lights light under flames
I burn so much drama at the same time
I'm holding at the same time
We don't see it with the same eyes
When the light don't show
I still be winning at the same time
Don't fall, stand that lane right
You love me bitch
I know you love me
You know you damn right

[Hook: Sean Deaux]
