[Hook x2]
Shouts to 3k
Told me roses stank
I just opened up the pack
I can't tell if that's the dank
Or her rose
She was cold
I'm like shorty what you drink?
Ask me did I have some water

[Verse 1]
I know you know what I mean
Drop lines you should read in between
Hotlines, we could hop on the phone
And drops dimes on the people we've been
And the places we've seen
Under moonlight, when the mood right
Room temperature moonshine
Sailor Moon type save the world complex
Check a nigga if he quote the bible out of context
Holy water showers healing powers when we
Confessed these feelings under the influence of flowers
No contacts, but I see you clearly
I was built for this
Damn near reckon, I might kill for this
Moved the crowd like a pilgrimage
Moved the crowd like police do
When my niggas peacefully assembling
Could see I've seen her and felt adrenaline
It was rushing I might need a Pendleton
For the cold shoulder she was giving them
Ill be sure that nigga I can't go for that and I ain't giving in

[Verse 2]
And I replied, I got ginger beer in the refrigerator
Trying to see if your heart is in the right place
Water like a defibrillator keep spreading love
We sense the haters everywhere
Fill these sentences with sentiments
See I ain't getting at you for your derriere
Seen your eyes sparkle like the Perrier
You not a player yeah but I crush a lot of herbs
Roll up big L's, talk it real smooth, know it sits well
Knowing me that ain't but the poetry
Soul in it bring the symmetry or the synergy
Or the floetry
Is you feeling me?
Girl your energy is so flowery, I mean
I'd pay that dowry, I mean
