[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
I never knifed no one
I never shot nobody
And I never clipped the thorns of my rose
It's too many other flowers in the garden
I play James Harden, who gon' let me score
Never did like the thunder, more a quiet storm
Only do it for the free, asking why conform
Never did like a drunkard in her driest form
Smoke with a nigga
Tell me bout your passions
Tell me how you ride then tell me bout your last couple crashes
I done met so many Stacey Dashes
Heart made of clay and they let him play Cassius
Why you easy to mold?
Did he iron out your morals?
Why you easily fold?
All I reached for was her hand, got a piece of her soul
It's July, she blaming me for the cold
And I cannot go

[Hook: Solei]
Feel like I swallowed the moon when I met you this time
So full it pulled me into now I that live in that tide
Even the day but I remember the night
I could deny state
I could deny fate

[Verse 2: Solei]
Still don't know about this (?)
Shoots comin' out my eye (?) like a (?)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You know like you know I do
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ahhh

[Hook: Solei]
Feel like I swallowed the moon when I met you this time
So full it pulled me into now I live in that tide
Even the day but I remember the night
I could deny state
I could deny fate

[Outro: Solei]
Ohh, ah-ah-ah
Ohh, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
