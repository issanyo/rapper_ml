[Intro]
Hi, I'm ambidextrous

[Verse 1]
I just kinda feel like rappin' right now
A lotta niggas cappin', I ain't really concerned with being captain right now
I'm 'bout to do a lotta a matter of fact
You see the numbers on the board, it's just fraction right now
That's just percentages, I need the whole thing
I whip this whole thing with my left
Not here for leftovers, all of them boys
We be slept over mom's crib
