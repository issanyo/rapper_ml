I know the cross, I know Judas
I know, I know you
Why'd you go & shame your tutor
I've no, I've no clue
Lime light aside
This wind don't feel alright
I can see you and the Romans approaching
To throw shade on our light
This was supposed to be our time
We worked,  we all shine
We supposed to grind when it's hard times
Look at you now cutting all ties
I know loss I know losing
I know, I know truth
I know the cross I know judas
I know, I know you

Pray for my niggas
We just wanna make it home safe
I don't really pop fly shit
Just bunts how you make it on base
Home studio flexing, a pen on point
Everybody got a joint to the face
Young Celadon City, it's a pity
I could really give a fuck bout the coins in the case
I been down and up and down again
Couple scratches on my crown again
I get lost but then I found my friends
One's that hold me down you supposed to drown when that shit real right?
This shit just don't feel right..
Damn, oh, this loud, ooh
Just make sure that seal right
Faced with the thoughts that are wasted
And I'm thinking, this can't be real right?
Pray for my niggas, we just wanna make it home safe
