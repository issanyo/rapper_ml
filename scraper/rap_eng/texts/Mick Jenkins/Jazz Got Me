[Chorus]
Take a little bit a jazz and you got me
Know you wanna be at the be at the
Take bita jazz and got me

[VERSE 1 -  LOUIS VI]
OK, Lemme tell you two things
There’s belief and a dream
You could be living so far but belief in your car, you could drive to the rings
Of Saturn
You know we made full of atoms
Don’t let your government try snatch them
Or Police when they draw the baton
We all Data or data
Put ya hat on, or later
Wear more sunscreen cose you will get burnt if you don’t come correct when you raise up
Read plato, while you play her
Fuck playdough know what your made of
Not woke yet, you better wake up
That won’t cut it like your mums razor

Stay grounded man
On the low when I’m on mountains man
Run through waterfalls and; fountains fam
Ain’t no other way to surmount it man
Man, like…

Let me be
Evergreen
Heavenly
Centre piece
It’s meanta be
Forever free
You could be
A friend me
My enemy?
Never be
Better heed
The heavy deed
Your tellin me
Dead your piece
Spread the peace
So let me see

[Chorus]
Jazz and you got me
Know you wanna be at the, be at the
Jazz when you got me
Know you wanna be at the, be at the
Jazz when they got me
Know you wanna be at the, be at the
Jazz when they got me
(Jazz is the tonic for your soul)

[VERSE 2 – LOUIS VI]
Music is the only thing you need
I ain’t here to be
What you think of me
Don’t think I see all of their Inner greed
Love my peeps but for them My heart’s a Winter scene
If you feel it
Then take it
It ain’t always there for you to make it
Don’t be a pawn of their creation
Just because you’re mind is creative
Without music I’d be barmy
Gone mad from surviving a tsunami
Why did so many die and I’m still alive sitting drunk in this London Party
I get stressed out but not stress-in
Got taught there is always a lesson
Don’t watch others it’ll do your head in
No sourdough for you Bread bin

Stay grounded man
On the low when I’m on mountains man
Run through waterfalls & fountains fam
Ain’t no other way to surmount it man
Man, like…

Let me be
Evergreen
Heavenly
Centre piece
It’s meanta be
Forever free
You could be
A friend me
My enemy?
Never be
Better heed
The heavy deed
Your tellin me
Dead your piece
Spread the peace
So let me see

[Chorus]
Take a little jazz and you got me
Know you wanna be at the be at the
Jazz and when they got me
Know you wanna be at the, be at the
Jazz when they got me
Know you wanna be at the, be at the
Jazz when they got me

[LOUIS VI + MICK JENKINS]
Let the lyrics flow and you got seas
Little bit of soul and you got seeds
Use all your mind till you got trees
Keep it shaded not shady, now your plot breathe…

[VERSE 3 – MICK JENKINS]

Then you hit the dro till you not need
Now you Socrates
Smoke and mirrors
All that shit just air space like Socrates
All I see isosceles
I been so obtuse with all my business ventures
Now I’m coping properties and assets
Still probably do the money phone
I ain’t never seen a money tree
Still catch me at the corner store
Never lacking I’m on cactus
Never lean and still I actavis trip
How you coping with the madness?
How you speaking to the masses?
All I really see is matchstick men
Kicking that bullshit yea
And I’m seeing hat tricks man
But I ain’t wanna fool wid
I come with the fool zip
Then empty a full clip
If you stuck on some cool shit
I ain’t never been a nigga that’s gon’ tell you no lie

[Chorus]
Take a little jazz and you got me
Know you wanna be at the be at the
Jazz when they got me
Know you wanna be at the, be at the
Jazz when they got me
Know you wanna be at the, be at the
Jazz when they got me
