[Chorus:  Che Lingo]
I sacrifice my life for you
My sidekick but more time who's saving who?
It's funny what the mind can do
But when you're by my side, I'm fine it's cool

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Aye
Backseat, windows up
That's the way I like to smoke
I ain't talking money if I call you broke
These days I just call you back
These days I won't call you black, unless I got some confirmation
These niggas ain't authentic
I can't lose my concentration
I need all my parchment stacked high on my expectations
On my car cracker shit
Man, all I need is a pen
He like a fucking octopus with the ink
Refuse to stencil a trend
No lead on me
You just know that I could pencil it in
I mean, the fuck did you think?
You already know why we came
Like we pulled up in a brinks truck
My armour it took a few chinks
My links tough
I'm super fucking with karma
Bout to open my chakras
Call me Rock Lee
No drama just broccoli rolled
I'm a pro, fuck a proxy
I hold my light on my own
From the go I got moxy
Coming at this shit so strong
All these jockeys
They keep coming up short
Well tell these niggas hold their horses
While we hold down the fort

[Pre Chorus: Che Lingo]
They just think you're dope
But I'm on smoke for you
All the money in the world
I could still go broke for you
Close my heart and my mind
I could open both for you
Getting woke for you
Like I'm s'posed to do
Like i'm s'posed to do, yeah

[Chorus: Che Lingo]
I sacrifice my life for you
My sidekick but more time who's saving who?
It's funny what the mind can do
But when you're by my side, I'm fine it's cool

[Verse 2: Che Lingo]
She told me
Che, you need to undress this soul
Covered in name brand fleece and polo neck tops
And change and reflective gold
Always on point
Never check this pulse
Living on my own terms till death tip-toes
From young I been building
Never really fit in the blocks
But I learnt to play Tetris though
This game, this game ain't something you can mess with bro
Sending me all of your energy just incase I need to spirit bomb enemies
You be my senzu bean in the blender when life hits hard and I need the remedy
Might get tendonitis 'cause this writing is more than a tendency
Seeing more than what they tend to see
Breaking my habits and honing my skills
Working harder for that home in the hills
What they're saying is fake
Their lips are collagen filled
I know man in college and field
Stacking bricks until their properties built
Majority wanted them killed
But they never had a wifey like you
Never had nobody riding like you
Tryna keep them on the straight and narrow
Even when they're feeling paro
Cupid hit me with the arrow
Now I feel your presence in my marrow

[Pre Chorus: Che Lingo]
They just think you're dope
But I'm on smoke for you
All the money in the world
I could still go broke for you
Close my heart and my mind
I could open both for you
Getting woke for you
Like I'm s'posed to do
Like i'm s'posed to do, yeah

[Chorus: Che Lingo]
I sacrifice my life for you
My sidekick but more time who's saving who?
It's funny what the mind can do
But when you're by my side, I'm fine it's cool

[Outro: Che Lingo]
I sacrifice my life for you
My sidekick but more time who's saving who?
It's funny what the mind can do
But when you're by my side, I'm fine it's cool
