[Verse 1: ASTR]
Slow down, caught up on your rollercoster
Hold out, never seem to get enough
And I know we're gonna too far
When you touch, it's givin' me a heartattack
Got a feelin' comin' too strong
There's a side of me I know sayin', "Don't look back"

[Pre-Chorus: ASTR]
Wanna be ya only girl
Wanna give you all my world
Wanna be ya only girl, only girl, girl, girl

[Chorus: ASTR]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Wanna be ya only girl
Wanna be ya only girl
Don't tell me it's over
Wanna be ya only girl
Wanna be ya only girl
Don't tell me it's over

[Verse 2: ASTR]
It's okay
Slow down, movin' in a little closer
Lights out, don't tell me that you've had enough
Yeah, wanna take it too far
But you playin' with my heart, I can't ignore
Got a feelin' comin' too strong
There's a side of me I know that's sayin', "Don't look back"

[Pre-Chorus: ASTR]
Wanna be ya only girl
Wanna give you all my world
Wanna be ya only girl, only girl, girl, girl

[Chorus: ASTR]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Wanna be ya only girl
Wanna be ya only girl
Don't tell me it's over
Wanna be ya only girl
Wanna be ya only girl
Don't tell me it's over

[Verse 3: Mick Jenkins]
Quality session, we not droppin' verses though
We just conversin', some women my brethren
Connectin' like cursive, reflect is the purpose
We break down the seventh
Prayers of wisdom do rose, songs inside of me told
You know how that story goes
These things don't always last for the long term
We made a wrong turn, maybe it was too much smoke
Cause everything was copesthetic
Now you say it's gettin' hard for you to cope
Cold shoulders got you reachin' for a scarf and coat
We wasn't ever supposed to get here, we both had to drive
I was takin' off a second, you was in the fifth gear
We got disconnected, we ain't have a conversation this clear
Not that I remember in a long time
Afraid it might've been the wrong time

[Break: ASTR]
Over (5x)
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
Me (3x)

[Outro: ASTR]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Wanna be ya only girl
Wanna be ya only girl
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Wanna be ya only girl
Wanna be ya
Don't tell me it's over
