I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I might have what you, what you need
Joint rolled up but you better know I keep it blunt, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Know I keep the water for the tree, for the tree, yeah
My niggas only focus be on, what they want yeah (yeah)
What they want, yeah yeah yeah
But God as witness, love is all you need

[Verse 1]
The parmesan ain't never been the problem
You will probably miss the point if coin is all that's on your palate
Changed a whole lot
Shout to DJ Khaled and according to my calculations
They see us as half of Nathan
This one here is black affirmation that we sunkissed
Fuck the fascination, that's the fuck shit
Forest Gump the culture, how you not gonna have the gumption to love yourself?
My nigga scream spread love at every function
And fuck all the assumptions about your nature
Never doubt, a hater's life is probably stressful
Learn from lessons, elevate your level
Nigga, burn through sessions assessin' myself
And my worth and my God and my devil, I never did Prada
I'm comin' at giants with pebbles
And praying three times a day
So nigga throw me with the lions or rebels
And I will eventually find a way
No mortal man could ever come take my kind away

[Hook]
I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I might have what you, what you need
Joint rolled up but you better know I, keep it blunt, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Know I keep the water for the tree, for the tree, yeah
My niggas only focus be on, what they want yeah (yeah)
What they want, yeah yeah yeah
But God as witness, love is all you need

[Verse 2]
And that's just basics for you
If the alcohol gon' make you tell then truth, then let's get wasted
If you want the truth from me, I got the water, you ain't even gotta chase it, do you?
And the basis is love, and this shit came straight from above
I know that you feel it, you know that it's love
I often wonder why He even chose us
His homie sold him out for the silver
It's beside the point but it wasn't even gold, bruh
Still die for a nigga just like him, and I know a nigga just like him
And that ain't nothin' but love, that ain't nothin' but love

[Hook]
I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I might have what you, what you need
Joint rolled up but you better know I keep it blunt, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Know I keep the water for the tree, for the tree, yeah
My niggas only focus be on, what they want yeah (yeah)
What they want, yeah yeah yeah
But God as witness, love is all you need
