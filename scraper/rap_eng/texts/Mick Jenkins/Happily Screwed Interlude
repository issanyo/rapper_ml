[Chorus]
I just want be happy, tell the haters is that too much to ask?
I just want be happy, tell my mom is that too much to ask?
I just want be happy, so I pray that's not too much to ask?
Pray that's not too much to ask
Pray that's not too much...

[Verse 1]
The piff twisted, aw yes
The Bic lit it
Big hit, a quick lift
We get bent like arm rests
And think about the days when I wasn't prayin', didn't talk to God
I'm amazed that I fuckin' made it, i'm so fuckin' far
From where I used to be
Y'all niggas best get used to me
Cool
In this Hilfiger shirt cause that other shit just uncool to me, fool
I'm talkin' Ivy Crew Chinos, off white Chucks
Cause the suede bucks
Got a scuff
Had to put 'em up
Wallet back, left pocket, nothin' tough, just a couple bucks
Chillin' with my shawty watchin' Netflix smoking coupled up
Ginger-Ale and Apple Juice is fizzin' in my double cup
Meal is in the oven and my Bible on the TV stand
Mind is on the message you can see me playin', fool

[Chorus]
