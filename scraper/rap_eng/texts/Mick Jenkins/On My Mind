[Intro]
Been here for a minute
Free
Be happy man

[Verse 1]
Tell 'em that i'm straight up out the Chi, and i'm reppin' that, to the def
Gotta couple homies that'll second that, reckin' rap
[?] might a second I was reckin' trap, run it back
Flippin' these trees like a lumberjack
Tell 'em that we ordered that
Smell like we imported that
We can see the bullshit, I was playin' Horace Grant
Think about it all the time, nigga we ain't forcin' shit
Think about it all the time, it's gone be unfortunate, fool

[Chorus]
There's something on my mind
Tell 'em (x10)
Tell 'em we ain't never goin' down without a fight
Tell 'em that we pray about it every single night
Tell 'em bout the mic
And the plight, of a chi nigga
Tell 'em that Free ain't only just me and my niggas

[Verse 2]
I really just be chillin' with my niggas
Ridin' down Jordan
With some shorties
That we courting
Trynna make them feel important
OG Skywalker like Luke
I been one with the force so I ain't never had to force it
Well manicured like golf courses
Tommy Hilfiger, fuck them horses
Lamborghini, Ferrari, and boxed Porsches
Stuntin' on these niggas somethin' I don't be endorsin'
You don't really gotta brag if you got the bigger portion, fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Trynna cop a bigger morsel of this pie called life
Now these shorties talk about releasing sexual endorphins cause i'm fly, all right
Like a 5 star dinner with a dash of Allspice
Niggas salty cause the system has been built on faulty premises
You just want it bumpin' and i'm seein' all the blemishes
Identities deminshin'
Plus a million witnesses play apathetic
They got you in this game simply off of athletics, fool

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's groovy
Free your mind
