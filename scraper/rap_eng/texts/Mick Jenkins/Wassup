[Intro]
It's Free Nation
We in here
It's Hot Crunchy Cheese Curls, man
Can't eat a bag of them chips without your thumbs being [?]

[Hook 1]
Wassup (x4)
You niggas talk about it, I'm tryin' to be about it, homie
Wassup (x4)
You MTV about it, I'm just gon' be Free about it, homie
Wassup (x3)
You niggas talk about it, I'm trying to be about it, homie
Wassup (x4)
You MTV about it, I'm just gon' be, Free

[Verse 1]
If you knew better, you niggas would do better
They want it less complicated, I'm never gon' lose letters
Not even for new cheddar, don't feel to beef it up when I abuse lettuce
Thrifty, dub-print shorts, shootin' the breeze, like a drive-by
Young fly guy that's never gon' lose feathers
Cop the purple or the green when the BB King blues get us
Couple that with my height and the paces at which I write
And it's safe to say that I make enough music for two niggas
Make it for you, nigga
Hope that you catch the message
Hope that between the flash and the flare you pause and reflect it
I'm hopin' checks get collected like a Nike shoe fetish
I'm shootin' for New York Times right now, we newsletters
Not enough paper, way too many issues
Sweat from the grind require way too many tissues
Get a towel in here, F-R, can a nigga buy a vowel in here?
Matter fact, that's Free
Matter fact, that's we
Bumpin' facts through these tracks, and these tracks get assembled like a factory

[Hook 2]
Wassup (x7)
You niggas talk about it, I'm tryna be about it, homie
Wassup (x4)
You MTV about it, I'm just gon' be Free about it, homie
Wassup

[Verse 2]
If you knew better, you niggas would just stop
You niggas would be rope, you niggas would just knot
I'm only givin' you Nas, my nigga, it's just props
I'm never gassin' you up, I'm more like a rest stop
Wassup
Faded out, on my green sueded couch
Watching NCAA and munchin' on some chips since Cajun
With my pen to the pad and a mean cadence count
My mind never stop, cause the grind never stop
Number six in the paint, like Lebron never stop
And Stock hate that line, money hate cause he great
Let's debate that line
We be ballin' and they play you
They be scorin' and they hate you
They deface you cause they hate that kind

[Hook 3/Outro]
Wassup (x3)
My niggas talk about it, I'm just tryna be about it, homie
Wassup (x4)
You MTV about it, I'm just gon' be Free about it, homie
Wassup (x4)
You niggas talk about it, I'm just tryna be about it, homie
Wassup (x4)
You MTV about, I'm just gon' be, Free
Fool
