[Verse 1 - Kid Pharaoh]
Why they tryna spend all my time?
You know I can’t really waste it, I don’t wanna spend a dime on you
Need to buy us some more time so I can save it
But time is money, tell me what I’m gonna pay with
See continuing in our continuum
Of space time, I waste time on a curriculum
That’s been sent to him from a dementing thing
Of black-hearted rap-stardom that I seek within
But what’s all that without time?
What’s a burning flame without that shine?
What’s the point if I don’t get mine?
Why’d I burn myself out and nearly lose my mind?
Is this evolution or revolution?
The feds are shooting, the reverend’s looting
The best solution’s to let them do it
Let time bare all the retribution

[Hook - I AM D]
Said I didn’t need the money, drugs, honeys, buzz
All I need’s time and love
Said I didn’t need the money, drugs, honeys, buzz
All I need’s time and love
Rolex with the sex? Nah
Funny, but, all I need’s time and love
Said I didn’t need the money, drugs, honeys, buzz
All I need’s time and love, ay ay

[Post-Hook - Kid Pharaoh]
We just need some time to let it burn
You just wanna see the flames
Time is all we need, father please
On my knees, beg and please that the people find the peace

[Verse 2 - Kid Pharaoh]
Time heals all, that’s the truth
Waste no time I be yelling to the youth
Waste no time feelin’ spirit in the booth
It’s when I feel it then I deal it, never lying through my tooth, through my teeth
I’m seein’ all the time you mistreat
You know time is of the essence, it’s a blessing on receipt
I said time is money, the currency for the dreams
Lighting the sun while I’m funding this brotherly love
We just let it grip and leave the dealings to become
We don’t ever question all these feelings from above
Seconds are ticking
These hours & minutes I’m tryna fulfil it
I’m trying to live it, apply what is given
Supply all the wisdom, it’s just a cold world
I’ve been living born sinning
Seeking redemption, delivering lessons
I’m counting these blessingslcounting these seconds

[Bridge - Hau]
When it’s all said and done, eh
Tell me how are you gonna compare
Between the life you lead to the one you should’ve lived out
It’s something you should think bout
You need to keep both your eyes wide
Keep both your eyes wide
And if you're not careful you’ll see how quick time flies
See how quick time flies
And kiss your arse bye bye

[Verse 2 - Mick Jenkins]
It’s 5:46AM, hide up
Pops just walked in on Craig with the burner
Earned a lot of shit talking, that’s adjourner
Lessons coming how the weed burn up
But we grown up now, make mistakes you gotta own up now
I still consider picking chrome up now
The way these niggas blowing domes up now
With [?] overseas so I’m only rolling zones up now
Whip the wrist like it’s Brunswick Zone
In my form, in my zone
I’m a deadeye, comparing me with clones, shit
Gotta be a Jedi, only wanna sip the Fela
Kuti, got your cutie on this water [?]
She made a point to say she’s not a groupie
Still tryna kick it, had to let her know I’m not her Bruce Lee
So excuse me, if I ever let The Times flow too loosely, uh

[Outro - Kid Pharaoh]
I said time is all we need, I’m out here tryna find the peace
Ain’t no love out on these streets, just know that time is all we need
It’s a revolution showing evolution in the streets
Keep the peace, time is all we need, time is all we need
