Cold muthafuckin' chillin' we ain't got shit to do [x3]
Cold muthafuckin' chillin'

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Bulls just won so the games off
Couple shorties tryna pull the Hanes off, sitting in the crib with a Vega and a chainsaw
AKA my grinder choppin' trees down but I'm high so my aims off
Almost out of raws now, smoke was in my lungs but its passin' through my jaws now
Shop the prop, private stock, make the thugs calm down
Call the homies up and they all down you know this
Paper muche nigga kudos if you know 'dis
Ridin' through the street with a homeless nigga motives dawg
We just tryna eat good, sleep good, and pass the peace pipe to my peeps' hood

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins]
Smoke some, do some, bring a friend and her two cousins
What's new cousin [x3]

[Verse: Mick Jenkins]
What you niggas bout, errybody, "I don't know"
Tell em' I'ma cop a gram and they down to roll
Order up some dominos, house only got two plates
Pizza on a paper towel, murdering at 2k
Netflix documentary I just finished that Zeitgeist
Tell me that I'm quite chill I respond with, "Ey quite right."
Never been attracted to the flashiness of night life, on my Drew Carey shit I party if the price right
But I'm only rollin' if my mind is on that kite height
Got flow, I'm comin' for your walls like a night light, night light, night light

[Outro: Mick Jenkins]
I know you niggas fuckin' with this free shit
I know you niggas fuckin' with this free shit
It's gon' cost if you ain't fuckin with this free shit, free shit, free shit
I know you niggas know that we gon' be shit
I see you niggas lookin' at this free shit, I see you niggas lookin' at this free shit, free shit, free shit
I know you niggas fuckin' with this free shit
It's gon' cost if you ain't fuckin with this free shit
I see you niggas lookin at this free shit
I suggest you start fuckin' with this free shit
