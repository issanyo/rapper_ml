[Hook:]
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, and they telling you they love it
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen

[Verse 1:]
Fuck yo, designer on my momma I get fly without them labels
15 minute savings, stacking paper with no staples
Geico wonder how I do it
Shot from every angle, yet this style is so congruent
I make these niggas mad when I'm dressing like they dads, out the 80's
Rekindle that fire, now I'm sparking all the interest with they ladies
Like where you get your clothes nigga, what you call your style boy
Can you take me shopping to some places I ain't never been?
Emani found that Dolce and Gabbana and Benny rocking the shit up out that letterman
Letters falling off but never ever is cheddar falling off
No never ever is cheddar falling off, nigga

[Pre-Hook]
And I be lying if I ain't tell you I love it
That YSL fly as hell but fuck it, I'm on a budget
Man fuck it, I'm on a budget
And, I be lying if I ain't tell you I love it
That YSL fly as hell but fuck it

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Tell them, fuck yo, designer on my momma 'til I'm rolling in that dollar
Liable to find your ho some old Balenciaga
For like three bucks, Ralph Lauren slacks, I cuff the crease up
Like denim off your ass, boy why it so tough to keep up?
Probably cause of how I creep up
Dress to kill, I'm goin' impress
Comme des Gar√ßons kiss my ass, [?] fuck yo' fresh
And if your heart ain't in it, nigga fuck yo' chest
And if they horses on it, fuck yo' vest
I'm on that Brooklyn Cirque Du Soleil shit
With a pair of killer gloves on some OJ shit
Stepping on the scene on some probate shit
And I dress it like I spit it on some Colgate shit

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Outro:]
Uh, and I be on my
Fuck the mall
Fuck the mall
Fuck the mall
Fuck the mall
Nigga, fuck yo outlets
Fuck yo' mouse trap
Fuck yo' mouse trap
Fuck yo' mouse trap
Fuck yo' full price
Fuck yo' sales ho
Fuck, I'm dead broke
So fuck yo' sales ho
Fuck the mall
Fuck the mall
Fuck them all
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, and they telling you they love it
Free shit

[Free nation member:]
Save yo' money nigga, save yo' money
