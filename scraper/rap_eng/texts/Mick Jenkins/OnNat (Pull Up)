Roll Up
(2x)

[Chorus]
I might
Have to pull up in that
On that wit ya
I might have to pull up in that on that wit ya
I might have to slide on ya
I might have to slide
On you
Pull up in that on that wit ya

[ ]
Vibe wit nigga let me taste your conversation Lady
Hopin' with intentions we don't need no complications Got the basics squared away
I might have to
See you
Grab you when I greet you
Girl it's Nice to meet you
Showin' her some things got somethings to teach you
I might have to
Slide on ya

[ ]
Skrrrr
Slide on ya
Pull up in the Bentley like I was a big Lincoln For my Mick Jenkins
Then I'll do whatever chick thinkin'
She got me lookin' at the lights downtown with the gets dark
Take the top down cause I wanna take her top down lookin' pretty when I pull up into park

Roll a back wood up
See you knew this
I could do this with one eye closed
Because I'm cold
Don't try to do this You better look at the
Look at the one-eyed crows
Smoke
Or would you really not really Know that get that Throw that cut up push back Got her on my  mind
When I pull up in that on that
Oh

[ ]
Thinkin it's magnificent
The way we
I can greet you flowers
I might teach you
So I might have to
What what
Slide on ya
Like I'm taking you to Vegas
Runnin the whip I never slip


But it's crisp when I
When I ghostride the whip
Or like a Ice cuz I dont slide to slip

Do it like Michael Jackson end it with a split Like the Jackson five when Michael split
Hold up
Who

Please please
James Brown on the stage when he slide on his knees
Legendary I can touch you with to electrify the ladies when they slide on their knees

You were never compatible to what I be doin' when you see me pull up in the white feline
You were never equivalent to when I
Movin' on skates B line

Mick Jenkins
Twista
Sunny Woodz
What you want

Sunny Woodz You got me too high
Just to Pull up
Just to get on
Gurl I know
