[Chorus: Supa Bwe]
Are you home?
Where you stay?
What you on?
I'm on my way!
Stay Awake (x4)
(x2)

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
You ain’t gotta search for me, I’ll turn on my location
I shouldn’t have to search for you, just turn on your location
Let me get that drop pin so I can stop sayin’ Imma pull up
Let a nigga pop in
Let me get that drop pin so I can stop sayin’ imma pull up
Let a nigga pop in
Wish I could say that I was on my way up
Still on my way and I’m still tryna lay up
This ain’t no crush and you can’t use them player statistics
I been puttin shots up shorty
Ever since a nigga got locked up, perception been changed
See the picture been cropped up for me
A great conversation is good food for thought
And we tend to treat it like a fuckin’ potluck shorty
What did you bring?
I brought more than pillow talk with me
Fuck what you thought
And they hate when you do it for the feel
I’m just asking for you to stay awake when you deal with a nigga
Need you to be real no matter how you think I might feel
Now tell me how that feel when you figure I’m…

[Bridge: Carl]
Right on time, I’m just trying to make it happen with you
I don’t have to get you
Let me pick you up
Let me pick you up

[Refrain: Mick Jenkins]
Let me get that drop pin so I can stop saying Imma pull up
Let a nigga pop in
Let me get that drop pin so I can stop saying Imma pull up
Let a nigga pop in

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Twista]
I feel like I’m finna go and desert everybody
I know what I want and I’m finna go get it
Admit that I’m horny as fuck
Given the one up in the air looking to hurt everybody
Dippin' up outta the back and I make a maneuver to get to the car
But I’m off the booze and buddah so then Imma have to go get me a Uber
Earlier I was at Lollapalooza but thinking that I wanna do you
But now it’s a matter of time and I feel like I gotta go get it before they pursue you
Pull up in front of your crib and I don’t care if it’s the AM
Feeling so good up off of the liquor that’s in me I be praying that she home like amen
Get up out the car and I be wobbling and call and let her know that I’m on my way in
Strike a pose and then I told her to take her clothes off
Glad she ain’t sleep, finna hit the ass soon
She went to the bathroom, I dozed off

(Twista, Twista. Stay awake, stay awake)
