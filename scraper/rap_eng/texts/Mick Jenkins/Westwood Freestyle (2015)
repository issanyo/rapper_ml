[Intro: Mick Jenkins]
Yo............yea
It's Mick Jenkins....I'm from the Southside of Chicago
............yea

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
I just kind of feel like rapping right now
It's lotta niggas capping
I ain't really that concerned with being captain right now
Yeah, do a lot a matter fact been seeing numbers on the boards
It's just fractions right now
That's just percentages, I need the whole thing
I whip this whole thing with my left
Not here for leftovers
All of them boys with me slept over, mom's crib
Deez is my negus
Runaway slaves, please don't act like they freed us
Best watch how you treat us
Caucasian preferably
Oh now he racist again
Bitch, what's the basis? Face basic infringements of rights on the daily
Fuck Mayor Daley
Two times for Rahm
Purified H2O, this shit's the bomb
Some called The Water[s] a storm...that's just the calm
I got [T]he [H]ealing [C]omponent man, I got some verses embalmed
Fluid in truth...lotta people love to hear the language, fewer people use it in the booth
I can't bang with a nigga, I don't hang with a nigga
If I don't see that man as a man
Lotta lost boys looking for a Tinkerbell
And that shit bout as real as a flying Peter Pan
Damn, come back to earth
I'm rolling this purple, it's straight from the grow house
I'm so down to earth, you could throw pounds
And dap when you see me, let's merch
Fuck out my mentions
Just sit back and witness this work
Whole bunch of immigrants, y'all niggas gone get this work

I just kind of feel like rapping right now
It's a whole lotta muhfuckers capping right now
Niggas whole lives in the caption right now
But yeah I'm bout to do a, lot a matter fact
Been seeing numbers on the boards, it's just fractions right now
Aheh! Yeah, that's just percentages, I need the whole thing
I whip this whole thing with my left
And I got nothing left...
