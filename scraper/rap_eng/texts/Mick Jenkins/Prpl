[Alan Watts: What happens after death]
These are the kind of questions
That make puzzle pro founded about our existence....

[Verse 1: EL Emcee]

Frozen rivers
But I ain't no seen her
But I'm sinner
Of cause my mama
I'll be back home for dinner
Before the nights out
Knock ya lights out
Not physically but mentally
Through This light switch
I might just
Lose ya life
Now ya lifeless
Ey Ey Ey

[Verse 1.2: Orgen A/EL Emcee]

That was nastyyyy EL

Frozen soul
Now my shoes cold
New born but so old
Premature
Breaking cervix's for fun
Who knows
I holm skills with the machete
Run up on ya yard
Turn ya kids to confetti
Or spaghetti
Walking through this hell hold
With a 44 and my teddy
Let shells go
Make fly with dodo's
Extinct ya soul
ELs inspiring rappers

[Verse 1.3: EL Emcee]
Spit it back in my face
Now expiring rappers
Like the 8th
Or the
Ides of March
Most these niggas
Like Brutus my nigga
While I'm Buddhist
My nigga
Align ya chakras ma nigga
Ancient samarians
Seed of life
Gods among us
We stars
Now astrologist can't align us
Or tell we who we are
You set the bar
Now I'm pole vaulting
Taking charge
Running tracks
Treadmills or lose ya pace
In fact lose ya place

[Bridge/Hook: Mick Jenkins]
I start to think about the after life
Cause' there ain't no coming back to life
Even when I'm tripping, know I'm packing light
Got the showers, meeting flowers
In the palm of my hand
Still waters, bringing calm to the land x2
