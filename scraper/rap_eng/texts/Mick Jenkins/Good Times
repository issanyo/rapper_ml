Verse 1: Gold X
I seek for time cause it seems we don't got any
And so I speak my mind thinking that we got plenty
What does future hold
Thinking about the principles
I never had goals
But I never had both
Golden goals
I turn the goals to
Golden gold
He who knows you
You cannot just come to me now
This the way I live my life now
But I grind for what's mind
So I'm looking in the mine
As I look for myself
I'm looking for the path of the right
I'm looking for the pass out of sight
Now would you commit sin
For something that's now in
Flowing inside of your bloodstream
Love is as hard as the concrete

Chorus: Gold X
I'm thinking about the times that we had x2
I'm thinking about the good times
The good times
And every time we set up a new line
They just hit my phone like It's new times x2
Thinking about the good times
I'm thinking about the good times

Verse 2: Gold X
Good thoughts got me alienated
And good shows good flows got me feeling hated
And now a nigga knows
That's just how it goes
I'm tryna get what's mine
But a nigga overdosed
So I open up the bible
Cause I'm looking for the answers
And I feel like I'm entitled
Cause I spent my life in prayers
Thinking should I do it now
Or should I let it go
I guess I'll go hard
Like I done bet it all
Don't try to read my mind cause I've embedded all x2
Yeah these feelings they encrypted
I'ma tell you how I did it
I felt like I had to get it
Got some change and then I flipped it
I ain't have to kill a chicken
Just get some fame inflicted
Cause those pains don't heal
Them shits will drive you down hill x2

Chorus: Gold X
I'm thinking about the times that we had x2
I'm thinking about the good times
The good times
And every time we set up a new line
They just hit my phone like It's new times x2
Thinking about the good times
I'm thinking about the good times

Verse 3: Mick Jenkins
It's 5:46 AM
Hot up
Pops just walked in on Craig with the burner
Learned a lot of shit talking as a journer
Lessons coming how the weed burn up
But we growen up now
Make mistakes you gotta own up now
I still consider picking chrome up now
The way these niggas blowing domes up now
It was skimp overseas
So I'm only rolling zones up now
With the wrist
Like it's Brunswick zone
In my forearm
In my zone
I'm a deadeye
Comparing me with clones
Shit I gotta be a Jedi
Only when I sip the Fela
Kuti
Got your cutie on this water
I'm like Yamaguchi
She made a point to say she not a groupie
Still tryna kick it
Had to let her know I'm not her Bruce Lee
So excuse me
If I don't let the good times flow loosely
I been focused on the loose leaf
Like a true say
Of the piece pipe
Like I'm Oogway with the kung fu
Art Deco with the Feng Shui
Wayne Geico for the insurance
Gordon Gekko with the fun say
Bless my nigga yeah
Peace and bless my nigga
I'm just thinking about the good times
I'm just thinking about the good times
The good times

Chorus: Gold X
I'm thinking about the times that we had x2
I'm thinking about the good times
The good times
And every time we set up a new line
They just hit my phone like It's new times x2
Thinking about the good times
I'm thinking about the good times
