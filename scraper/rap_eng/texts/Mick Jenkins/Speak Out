SPEAK OUT (ft. Mick Jenkins)

Bridge:
Conscience but im modest with this flow
The pros & con's about science
I know my own
I know my soul
I just can't be cool with this system
Knowing my people suffering cause what they do...
So i,  speak out

Vs 1
We need hope, the  fck you mean?
What u doing for us?
Why you tryna come between?
When i hear em, i dont just go with it
This ain't a movie
No, Aniston - this scene
This flo / been progressive
Insuring you been getting the message
All ya needs met
Is you with me yet?
Ima need it said – leaders of the ol school – peep this – sequence
Came from the bottom
Move to the middle
Back to the bottom
Hit the middle
Yeah, a little while after
Been back on the bottom ever since 18
12 yr wage slave
Yeah, you gotta feel me
Still see daydreams
Sitting in a field these kids in unison
Singing what i film
Please... keep this sht goin...
When the beet drop
Like, me when i was working at a shop
Where they pressed juice
Guess I wasn't cut out for the tools
Ohh
Fck it, got a couple tunes
That'll make em move like they in the way
& we in it, so the internet say
& we all up in it like the NSA
NASA in the space
I'm tryna raise the minimum wage
& that right there's a political statement
You know the typical arrangement

Hook : Mick Jenkins
Just make sure its an explanation point
If you punctuate
These days gotta say it wit ya chest
I need you to annunciate
Eyes roll back finna undertake the mission
Please dont underrate the message
Speak out, dont understate the effort


Vs.2
This is Hell on earth... The fck u thought?
A kid made a dollar off the stuff u bought
And the company u bought it from must use laws to get the labor done cheaper
While the public pay the cost – fck em - & another suicide
With them / & the foxconn in the news once again /
Yeah they got us when they stock up
Ery year new model / finding ways / hittin pockets, coming in-
Why tf y'all don't b making a better product ? Keep it a buck when you talkin to us, honestly
Im sick of corporations selling us sht
& knowing damn well when its gonna fail in this btch /
I'm in the mood to air em out /
Make a movie about it, i Paramount em /
Moving mountains - i usher em to the balcony /
& Leonidas they ass, all 300 hunnit of em - fck a 1 percent -
99 percent of us in the sunken place /
Gotta fake it ey other day,  at a Job that we hate working for the man
Ain't sht changed /
But the numbers on the dates /
And they still paying Lil homie in the cage, spare change, what a
Shame, I'm ashamed of the ways that we hate /
See, how they do you for a lil bit of weed -
Put you in a penitentiary /
A sentence that'll leave you in circumstance /
Difficult to work n get a band /
PO’s -  out here / alert the fans /
Its what i be meaning when i be saying, all the moneys in the service Damn... Kick us when we down /
Getting us to build they products that'll continually break to
Keep the wheel rotating / sell it back out / to the same people stuck
Up in profit driven system / fck efficiency right?
So get it how you live right?
Sht, we done already bitten  a Lotta forbidden things / we guilty but
We forgiven but / we a bunch a sinners, yeah.. we a get it right we got time God, right?
