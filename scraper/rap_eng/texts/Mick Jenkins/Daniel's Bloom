[Intro]
See, see, see what the world needs is love...y'all here me? See that's what we don't have enough of. Love, say it with me. Love. And we all done had them nights at 2 AM when the devil is, smoking at your goddamn coat tail. And you call somebody on the phone and you begged and you breathed and you say, "Pray for me! Pray for me!"

[Verse 1]
Yea, it was right off 79
Real niggas would roam the halls
It was Hirsch High
It was bankin' on your withdrawal
I was shellshocked
Donatello, I'm stickin' to it like a bell hop
Brought the baggage
I'm siftin' through it, tryna track the real
Love heals, I lean on it
Come and crack a seal
Crack the 5 right up the middle
(Th)ey was stonecold
I was jokes
A couple blocks, was just a stone's throw away from the folks
It was at war, I hit the peace pipe
That just means I had no protection
I was stressin' way more often if correct with
Recollectin' it was all well, or on Larry
On sight, and I was all love, but arms ready
It's all my life I had to stay low
No chance for a nigga to save peso
Or slow dance with death or hate
They like the same so I'm off that
On point
These youngins aimin' at your ball cap, for some coins
They say it ain't no love

[Hook]
Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet that you could pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
Moët, we pour it up at gatherings that we'll soon forget
Cause the day by day negatives be consumin'
Haters boomin'
Love is what flowers and finish blooms beget
Show me your plot and I'll do the dirt till my wounds cement

[Bridge]
Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet

[Verse 2]
Don't let the struggle make your heart harder
Sip the truth, spit the truth
That's the smart water
I'm talkin' gospel, J Hova, no Shawn Carter
It's more cons than pros
The Southside so cold
I suggest your keep your Carhartt
Love is stronger than pride
But also love is a muscle
You gotta build from inside
And amidst the hustle and bustle
Amidst the roll of the thunder
I play the role of a Russell Westbrook or Simmons
Put simply, I gotta get it and they couldn't kill me morally
Either way Free Nation got a couple more of me on deck
Young Nyjah Huston did the street trials
Kicked and pushed until I beat down barriers
Kicked and pushed until I beat down
They say it ain't no love, but I've seen it, I've seen it
They come few and far between it
But I've seen it, I've seen it, I've seen it

[Hook]
Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet that you could pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
Moët, we pour it up at gatherings that we'll soon forget
Cause the day by day negatives be consumin'
Haters boomin'
Love is what flowers and finish blooms begin
Show me your plot and I'll do the dirt till my wounds cement
