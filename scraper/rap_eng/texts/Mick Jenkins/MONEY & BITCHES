[Intro: Joey Purp]
Uh, Young Purple

[Hook 1: Joey Purp]
All I hear is money and bitches and 20-inch spinners
I ain't been to church in a minute, my Jesus piece flicking
They told us that bitches be bogus and niggas be tripping
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
Money and bitches and 20-inch spinners
They told us that bitches be bogus and niggas be snitches
I ain't been to church in a minute, my Jesus piece flicking
Riding in the whip and it's stolen and plus my licence suspended

[Verse 1: Joey Purp]
So fuck if they pull me over, I'm Audi, I'm dipping
Riding with a zip of that sour, I'm serving I'm pitching
If they catch me, seven or ten is my minimal sentence
But my Jesus piece fully golden and plus my pockets is swollen
They full of money that's stolen, I'll spend in a minute
They taught us to value possesions, obsess with expenses
They taught us accept your position, the bottom'll fit you
It don't cost a dollar to listen, I hope you pay me attention
Man, this the point that we making, it's easy to miss it
They taught us that hooping and rapping is all we invented
They taught us to speak your opinion and get you arrested
And we grew up being neglected by our elected officials
My nigga, cry me a river, I'll buy you a tissue
I don't wanna hear your complaining, you pressure my issue
All I know is money and bitches, ain't closing the system
They say life's a bitch but I'm pimping, she pay me attention

[Hook 2: Joey Purp]
Money and bitches and 20-inch spinners
I ain't been to church in a minute, my Jesus piece flicking
They told us that bitches be bogus and niggas be tripping
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
Money and bitches and 20-inch spinners
They told us that bitches be bogus and niggas be snitches
I ain't been to church in a minute, my Jesus piece flicking
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Started talking all this water, it penetrated the culture
Know I'm killing niggas cause I started seeing vultures lurking
Half y'all niggas signed to one, get you out of that jam
Most so dislocated, you don't even need a CAT scan
To see it these days, bullshit features 3K
And if you signed to a label, know I'm coming for that paper
Ain't no lacking, ain't no games to be played
Hit your girl with a parabola like, "Will you behave?"
It's only linear equations, we straight, ain't tryna kick it
Ain't really tryna get between your legs, bitch, this ain't no East Bay
These days Supreme on me, green on me
Used to keep the American Dream on me
Less promethazine and a little more Morgan Freeman how they lean on me
Scenes from movies reenacted on me and my team
All for that melanin, the essence of ebony
It ain't no magazine on me but they treat me like a felon
Cause I sag the selvedge denim jeans on me, I could give a fuck
It's your world, squirrel, but I'mma get this nut off
Puff, puff, cough, thinking as the vapours hit my taper
It's some gangrene that I must cut off
Keep it thorough, give a fuck how it must come off
That's on my soul, fam, it don't rub off
All that TV shit y'all niggas out here talking, that, I must cut off
I must cut off
