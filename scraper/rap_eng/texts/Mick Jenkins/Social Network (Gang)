[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
It’s really a song about being with all of my friends
Smoking a lot of the dope, spending up all of my ends
Only with niggas I started with
Canada dry for your girl 'n'em
All in my face with that Internet
Shit her future is something like Earl 'n'em (sounds odd)
What the fuck I give about a list
Half these niggas only talking wrist
And its an art to this
That shit not writing man niggas is scribbling
That shit is Parkinson’s
You should be shaking in boots
Yall shaking up with the left
Yall niggas can't shake the truth
I'm by my fucking self

[Verse 2: Carl]
Niggas talking imitation
Think they need a demonstration
Think they need a renovation
Remy -
Fuck you bitch I been amazing
Kiss my piff incinerating
Rinse the wrist off with my magic
Hella lightening elder Raiden
Thunder God I’m going Captain
Super Saiyian like whats happening
Power level 10,000
First appearance Pete Townshend
Who that said that we drowning
Island golden seas round him
Seize the throne and eat the crown
Master Roshi caught me flexing
Monsters only in my crowd
Kami house for my protection
Outer space I’m going Jetson
Flowers face the most inception
Gang shit fore I eat my breakfast
