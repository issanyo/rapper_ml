[Chorus]
I've been hiding out in plain sight
I’ve been getting high as hell, before these fucking plane rides
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
I've been hiding out in plain sight
I've been getting high as hell before these fucking plane rides
Never plain clothes, that just can’t fly
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes

[Bridge]
Robert Geller, Watanabe, Common Projects just to curve the groupies
I'm in Barney's, tryin' Marni copped it sooney sooney
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, got the Dries on me
Breeze on me, I might need to grab a new jacket
Double G's, a couple G's on my new jacket
They used to tax a nigga, now I'm in a new bracket
New bracelet, link from Cuba, going too savage
Change five times nigga going too savage

[Chorus]
I've been hiding out in plain sight
I’ve been getting high as hell, before these fucking plane rides
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
I’ve been hiding out in plain sight
I've been getting high as hell before these fucking plane rides
Never plain clothes, that just can’t fly
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes
Never plain clothes

[Verse]
Fitted yeah, getting ready I'ma be there in a minute, yeah
Getting blunted in the Uber, windows tinted, yeah
Five stars for the driver 'cause he wit' it, yeah
’Cause he wit' it
Shorty wit me and she fitted yeah
Getting ready she gon' be here in a minute yeah
Getting blunted in the Uber, windows tinted, yeah
Five stars for the driver 'cause he wit' it, yeah
Five stars for the dinner we ain't pay a dime
She a dime, gotta pay her more than nevermind
She rock theory, she got theories that'll level mine
Had to level up, styles, I got several kind
And the other side suede, yeah this leather lined, yeah
I got thick skin, yeah yeah she thick too
We ain't tossin' pig skin, but as soon as I touch down
It's already ceremonies
