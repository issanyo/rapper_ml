[Verse]
(Whatchu wanna do?)
Aye, feeling like that nigga these days my skin is much clearer
My woman skin is much clearer of course I'm drinkin' my water
Don't spend too much time in mirrors
Reflections will get you caught up
Connections will get you brought up in conversation
You basing everything you know about me from moments
I'm more a compilation of composition it's complicated
I've contemplated so many perspectives
Accomodated my vices, exonerated emotions
And then I'm copin' Macaulay Culkin
I'm trappin' my demons over Bohemian Rhapsody
They draw lines in our widow's peak, we don't peak at capacity
Casually givin' no fucks about your two cents
We gon' clip the loose ends, we gon' clip the split ends
We gon' split ends, we gon' burn the nooses
They try to exclude us they lie to include us
My tribe is of Judah, your kind is of Judas
I ordered the seasonal Brutus among us uprooting
The fungus these niggas is leeches they learn it all from us
They fuck up the numbers

[Chorus]
Don't you get to countin' up another nigga dough
Don't call me a hater just because I wasn't fuckin' with the flow
If it's reggie then I gotta let you know, keep it that real, niggas already know
Don't you get to countin' up another nigga dough
Don't call me a hater just because I wasn't fuckin' with the flow
If it's reggie then I gotta let you, gotta let you know

[Verse]
You got it for your niggas already
Whatchu wanna do about me tellin' the truth? I get it you sensitive
And I don't say that with malice
My intentions are pensive and poignant
Opinions, annoying us they are all often informin', I'm critically Thinkin', I'm fixin' my form and my shootin' percentage is risin'
I worked on my vertical simply by just switching horizons collidin' My will with the wave and niggas call me Poseidon
Just call me the plug, I'm providin' the drugs, and small doses we Grindin', we rollin', we smokin', we cookin', we eatin', we focused Repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat 'til it's polished Acknowledge my genius no college degree on me, gotta few G's Wit' me, got a OZ on me, it's some OG homie don't you count the paper on me homie

[Chorus]
Don't you get to countin' up another nigga dough
Don't call me a hater just because I wasn't fuckin' with the flow
If it's reggie then I gotta let you know, keep it that real, niggas already know
Don't you get to countin' up another nigga dough
Don't call me a hater just because I wasn't fuckin' with the flow
If it's reggie then I gotta let you, gotta let you know
I got real niggas already
