[Intro: Michael Franks (Sampled)]
We get higher and high
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's Fire
Love so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at
[x2]

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Um ebony playboy prop stock named Burman
Trees burnin', gon' need that smokey bear and shurm
Heh, 'till the freak cannot get no higher lightnin' jolly ranchers on fire
Please don't knock it until you try it, on some tweak shit
And we don't really fuck with that street shit when we high
Niggas got the munchies tryna get a meal, on that meek shit when we high
Niggas snort ricky and pop pill that MMG shit we decline
Only stickiest of that icky pack yo bags right and get trippy
Got them ray bans on my face and bomber jackets 'bout to get pimpy hol' up
Hol' up, playboy got the buds, stockling got the roar you hit that bitch 'bout once bet you won't want that bitch no more

[Break: Michael Franks (Sampled)]
We get higher and high
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's Fire
Love so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
So, why should I care about these wack rappers (you shouldn't)
No class, got the gat up in my backpack wrappers (pow pow pow pow pow)
Working at the Gap and I unwrap mad wrappers with fresh gear I could address mad rappers right now (right the fuck now)
'Bout the terrible shit they write down, that Cuba Gooding Jr. flow they're just bad actors
So, I give 'em a dose of my own stuff to take 'em higher than mountain ranges where Karl Malone was
A stoner, I'm coming at these pussies like a boner
They sleepin' on a nigga so I'm spitting cups of Folgers
Wake up nigga, time to wake up nigga
I'm here for the money you gon' take a pay cut nigga got fooled

[Outro: Michael Franks (Sampled)]
We get higher and high
Crazy blue like St. Elmo's Fire
Love so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at
