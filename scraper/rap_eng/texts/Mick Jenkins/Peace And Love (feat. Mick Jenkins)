(Hook)
Free my mind
Escape my soul
Traveling this unknown road
Why can't I just find peace and love
When nothing even matters anymore

(Verse 1 - Mos Poetik)
Sit inside with some sadness, sparkin' a spliff trippin'
Subliminal visions
Eyes slit, slippin' driftin' away
From sober livin', liquid drippin' from the empty 40 bottle hollow thoughts driven, distorted illusions, images are vivid
Paint a picture with your dreams uh, god given
I preach peace
Prosper from the dirt, livin' inside of a world consumed by lies, visions
Will guide, listen to the words that I'm tryna to speak
An empty voice full of passion captured on a beat
Depict a masterpiece
Immaculate gods walk divine through the shadows seekin knowledge from the inner battles we defeat
Feastin' with kings so caution
Cosmic objects develop exits, deceivin' process
Third I watch them warp the source of objects
Sweat pourin' from the core walk with lords and knowledge
Polishin' the pores of conflict, constantly continuin' across with content
Deeper than the reaper, seekin' lethal nonsense
Evilest mindset, believin' my conscience
It's [?] when the reefer speakin' ignitin' my mind through higher teachin's pray to conquer demons
Split seams like I'm Moses, grippin' a spliff with ease
Twist it like, molly in Jamaica wakin' up in peace
Walk a divine pace, posted with the OE
Provide a hope for the livest souls to vibe with me
Defyin' physics, I'm lifted from below the knees
Mental spirit is clear, steer for lonely peeps who holdin' me
Close to they soul, hope that they notice me
Nonchalantly, I'm kamikaze we coastin' beats
Saliva 6-bit syphilis sativa leaf and eyes dripped, dipped inside the mind of a believer
From the belly of the beast, puffin' blunts stuffed with ether
Fuck the world that's what I'm screamin', deceivin' the nonbelievers uh
Equivalent to splittin' atoms, destructive as stuffin' dynamite inside your pipes, sayonara guy
Overdoses psychosis, givin' god a high five
Praisin' Ghandi, peace to the armies to a rebel side
Metallic palace, Alice trapped inside a plastic mind
Passin' by
The impatient pack with passion like
You're impractictal, practice and try to capture vibes
Nonexistent to livin' I'm driven through the afterlife

(Verse 2 - Mick Jenkins)
So what?
I'm just supposed to sit and spit about how fly I am
Tell you that I'm on my second sky, that that's how high I am
Fuck that, fly shit ain't never made a nigga change
It's just like RedBull - it ain't never gave a nigga wings
Never made a nigga dreams come true
You never made a nigga bright and swearing that you shine just like the Sun do
So ima have to undo
Give it to em different you better bring your infantry this nigga make his militant the rythm it you feelin' it and I ain't poppin, gat gat
Well I got tricks all up my sleeve, I'm like Inspector Gadget
It's tragic
You can see it in these niggas' face, can you believe these niggas fake, it's like they rap for Gucci pageants
I'm past that
Pass that joint so I can ash that
I'm tryin' to get my stock up, no Nasdaq
Niggas need insurance now, but where they 'bout to crash at?
Each day I'm more progressive, out here crackin'  'bout this water like it's Aflac
Need a hazmat suit, he spit it too sick
Comin' after your meals like a toothpick
I'm fuckin' ruthless
In here tryna tell the people what my truth is
I ain't sayin' you lyin', I'm just asking where your proof is

(Hook)
Free my mind
Escape my soul
Traveling this unknown road
Why can't I just find peace and love
When nothing even matters anymore
