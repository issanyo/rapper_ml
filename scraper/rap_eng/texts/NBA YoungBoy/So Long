[Chorus]
When my grandma died, I jumped off the porch and started hustlin'
Me and 3Three in the nawf but we was thuggin
Promise I won't let up off my grind till I get some
Each and everyday, we been getting to that money
I done took so many losses trynna bubble
I swear that's so long, I been waiting for this moment
Going hard we gon' turn nothing into somethin
Stayed down now I know you see me stuntin
I done took so many losses trynna bubble
I swear that's so long, I been waiting for this moment
Going hard we gon' turn nothing into something
Stayed down now I know you see me stuntin

[Verse 1]
On the run for 2 months I was sleeping on Mi's couch
Slipped up and got caught
Judge sent me up the road
Josed up in Tullulah, whole time was writing songs
I been knew I was cold, but not 'til now that it showed
Came home then I blow
They fuckin with my song
Without the track with Scotty hundred thousand on my own
Through my city floating 'round
Smoking on some strong
Thinkin bout a murder cause I heard they want me gone
I got money in my pocket
Tatts all on my arms
So much designer on my body bitch I feel like Stroke Tha Don
Forever posted on the block
Addicted to the guap
I promise I won't stop till I make it to the top
I swear I want the shit so bad
No I can't lie (No I can't lie)
No I can't flock em baby K you gon' get popped
I heard this money on my head so I went and bought me some more shots
Won't hesitate to open fire

[Chorus]
When my grandma died, I jumped off the porch and started hustlin'
Me and 3Three in the nawf but we was thuggin
Promise I won't let up off my grind till I get some
Each and everyday, we been getting to that money
I done took so many losses trynna bubble
I swear that's so long, I been waiting for this moment
Going hard we gon' turn nothing into somethin
Stayed down now I know you see me stuntin
I done took so many losses trynna bubble
I swear that's so long, I been waiting for this moment
Going hard we gon' turn nothing into something
Stayed down now I know you see me stuntin
