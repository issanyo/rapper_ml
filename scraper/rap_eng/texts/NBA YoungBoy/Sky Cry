[Intro]
Oh, oh, I'm good
Oh, oh, I see things I shouldn’t have seen
Playboy on this bitch but he ain't playin' tho

[Chorus]
I see your pain, through the skies in the backyard
I know you love me, baby you ain’t gotta act hard
I'ma leave a stain, shots to the brain, left the whole block scarred
Down for the gang, gotta use your brain, we gone make the rocks hard

[Verse 1]
Shawty say go when it's time
I thought you was under this here but you not
Puttin' up with your shit way too many times
Everybody you know say you never was mine

[Refrain]
Let a nigga come try, and get hit with that iron
Got a real big heart, but I'm real deal slime
Get a real bad bitch, I'ma make her mine
I'm a real street nigga who be totin' that iron
She a real hood bitch, she the rich nigga kind
She a real good girl, some shit on her mind
Post up at the trap with the stick outside
Every bitch in the truck, neither one my kind

[Verse 2]
Have a daughter by choice, I’ma name her Kind
Come and knock at the door with the rod in the ride
Ray Ray, RiRi, the Arabian tribe
You a never get far with you tellin’ them lies
I know you never left me, and I know you probably right for me
And I can't say why I’m leaving
I just wanna tell you it's hard, no it ain't easy being me
And you don't know how to play your part wit’ a nigga
On stage turnt up wit' the hardest of niggas
You need to go read a thesaurus to niggas
Them shooters they sleep wit' that rod in a pillow
You tried to make a choice, but your heart in the middle
I see your soul in the sky through a symbol
No insurance for the incidentals
Real bitch go hard for they niggas

[Refrain]
Let a nigga come try, and get hit with that iron
Got a real big heart, but I'm real deal slime
Get a real bad bitch, I'ma make her mine
I'm a real street nigga who be totin' that iron
She a real hood bitch, she the rich nigga kind
She a real good girl, some shit on her mind
Post up at the trap with the stick outside
I'm a real street nigga, who be totin' that iron

[Chorus]
I see your pain, through the skies in the backyard
I know you love me, baby you ain't gotta act hard
I'ma leave a stain, shots to the brain, left the whole block scarred
Down for the gang, gotta use your brain, we gone make the rocks hard
