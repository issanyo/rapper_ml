[Verse 1: NBA YoungBoy & Jacquees]
I'm like for real, brand new Audemar stainless steel (stainless steel)
House in the hill, I ain't got one yet, but I ran up a mil (I done ran up a mil)
Nigga know I don't steal, but you know for sure that I'm ready to kill (I'm ready to kill)
Ayy, I be traumatized, my cousin died, and I ain't shed a tear (I ain't shed no tear)
Nigga try, he get killed, you play with that money, you know what it is
38 baby, I'm thuggin' for real, straight out the slums, I'm gutter for real
That nigga disloyal, you know how I feel, but I'm really chasin' that money for real
Not chasin' no bitch, I been chasin' a mil
My daddy locked up, he just waitin' on appeal
Yeah, I gotta admit, I got demons in my body (in my body)
I'm paranoid, and I feel some people watchin' (some people watchin')
I gotta maintain and stack up that money, you know they can't stop me (know they can't stop me)
I stay with a burner 'cause if it ain't on me, them niggas gon' pop me (gon' pop me)
These bitches ain't shit, and I know these niggas ain't shit neither (whoa)
Got a stick in the car with thirty-six Os in the trunk of the rita (ayy)
Not askin' for shit, not trustin' nobody because I don't need 'em (ayy)
I'm sippin' on lean while Jacquees steady smokin' on reefer

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Before the fame, I was a star
Changed our ways, but we ain't changin' who we are
I copped a foreign, remember the stolen cars
I thank god I ain't dead or behind bars

[Verse 2: NBA YoungBoy]
They have a shootout in a minute
On the phone with my mama while sittin' in prison
Criticizin' myself, steady sayin' I'm trippin'
Got a brand new 'Vette, dropped the top like a Bentley
I perform on stage with cases pending
All over the world AI been trending
In my Balmain jeans I keep a Glizzy
Got the VVS diamonds in my NBA pendant (skrrt, skrrt)
Hop in the Benz, I step on the gas
Focus on business, you know I ain't playin'
Only the real gon' feel what I'm sayin'
Gotta go chase it and get off my ass
I really don't hang 'cause I like to flash
Fuck all that shit, I'ma get me a bag
Hoes tryna get in Jacquees' pants
I know all they really want is them bands
Hey, I need to stop
Head on collision, I'm 'causin' a wreck
Steady finessin' my way to the top
Hey, can't give up now
I think I'm a wizard, just call me John Wall
I tighten my shoe, and I run with that rock

[Bridge: Jacquees]
Fuck the critics, I'ma get it 'cause I want that ('cause I want that)
I won't complain what was on my plate 'cause I was hungry (I was hungry)
I still got love for all the people that left me lonely
Never will I come back, forever I'm on that, yeah

[Chorus: Jacquees]
'Cause before the fame, I was a star
Changed our ways, but we ain't changin' who we are
I copped a foreign, remember the stolen cars
I thank god I ain't dead or behind bars
