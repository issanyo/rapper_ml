[Intro]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
It's so fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

[Chorus]
Styling hard, covered in LV
And bitch I'm shining hard, diamonds in my teeth
I just left from Saks and I put blood on my feet
My PO told me "Nah," but fuck it
I'm still with Nene, Jania
Hold on, I pull up bouncing with my chains on
I'm not worried about no fuck nigga, got my thang on
Got a Glock for out that eight, I'll put yo name on it
I told that bitch that I'm a dog without no chain on
Money paging on my beeper
VVS in my teeth now
Serving in my Reeboks
Bitch come give me teeth now
Money longer than a queen hair
I don't know Rapunzel
Take his pack and we get out of there
We runnin' through your front door

[Verse 1]
Choppa louder than a bucket, I'm like fuck it, nigga
I bet that I could fuck yo bitch you think I'm ugly, nigga
We post up on that ugly corner, shit get ugly, nigga
You know we keep the burners on us, quick to buss it nigga
I throw them bands on a bitch
I turn up bad on a bitch
I put no caption in my caption
I just swag on a bitch
Got 'em mad as a bitch
I know they hate I act like this
You say that you don't like this song, just wait I drop my CD, bitch

[Chorus]
Styling hard, covered in LV
And bitch I'm shining hard, diamonds in my teeth
I just left from Saks and I put blood on my feet
My PO told me "Nah" but I'm still fucking with Nene
I pull up bouncing with my chains on
I'm not worried about no fuck nigga, got my thang on
Got a Glock for out that eight, I'll put yo name on it
I told that bitch that I'm a dog without no chain on

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm a dog with no chain on
Chicago, bitch, I'm home alone
Play me like a dummy, think it's funny?
I'ma bust yo dome
I got lean in my styrofoam
Smokin' on that Al Capone
Say he need a blessin', I'm not stressin'
I'ma send him home
Hoe, don't turn around
I fucked that bitch from the back
I'ma hang that ho up on the wall like a tat
Tag teaming that bitch, we go back after back
Don't give a fuck 'bout this track
I do this shit back to back
Need money, where it's at?
Flexin', get stuck on this stack

[Chorus]
I pull up bouncing with my chains on
I'm not worried about no fuck nigga, got my thang on
Got a Glock for out that eight, I'll put yo name on it
I told that bitch that I'm a dog without no chain on
Money paging on my beeper
VVS in my teeth now
Serving in my Reeboks
Bitch come give me teeth now
Money longer than a queen hair
I don't know Rapunzel
Take his pack and we get out of there
We runnin' through your front door
