[Chorus: Yungeen Ace]
Ain't too many people that was there for me
If I told you I love you then you can depend on me
I was walkin' alone, they all was countin' on me
I was locked in that cell and y'all didn't care about me
I'm deep in these streets and I swear that all I wanted
I'm deep in these streets and I swear that all I wanted
I pray the lord protect the path I'm goin'
I pray the lord protect the path I'm goin'
I'm deep in these streets and I swear that all I wanted
I'm deep in these streets and I swear that all I wanted
I pray the lord protect the path I'm goin'
I pray the lord protect the path I'm goin'

[Verse 1: Yungeen Ace]
Have to ask the lord to protect 'em, got the devil in my direction
In my city they hate me, I'm shoppin' hard up in the grave
Keep it on with no safety, even though I'm on probation
And if I slip I'm goin' to jail, can't let a nigga take me
Word 'round the city they all want to rob and kill me
Word 'round the city I got some change on my head
Heart of a lion, niggas know I ain't scared
And it's death before dishonor and I'ma die 'bout my respect, and that's on my mama
Niggas still tryna test me, bitches sick and get ready
Fire out with the Glock, still tote the Smith and Wesson
Niggas still tryna test me, bitches sick and get ready
Fire out with the Glock, still tote the Smith and Wesson
He said his opps so much pressure
So when I see he I'ma stretch him

[Chorus: Yungeen Ace]
Ain't too many people that was there for me
If I told you I love you then you can depend on me
I was walkin' alone, they all was countin' on me
I was locked in that cell and y'all didn't care about me
I'm deep in these streets and I swear that all I wanted
I'm deep in these streets and I swear that all I wanted
I pray the lord protect the path I'm goin'
I pray the lord protect the path I'm goin'
I'm deep in these streets and I swear that all I wanted
I'm deep in these streets and I swear that all I wanted
I pray the lord protect the path I'm goin'
I pray the lord protect the path I'm goin'

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Don't know this path I'm on
Tribulations 'til the second I'm gone
If I ever get enough I'll run
Money racing, we don't have no fun
Take one to the head now, be the same day I said
Young nigga made history
Money talk, what they say can't get to me, yeah
I'ma speed through the light and the red
Family business don't pay
I fronted him a whole plate
My own nigga ain't pay
Don't know what to do, what should I say?
Probably be wrong if I knock out his brain
It ain't hit up my pain, ain't nothin' gon' change
It ain't nothin' you can't have, just stay out my way

[Chorus: Yungeen Ace]
Ain't too many people that was there for me
If I told you I love you then you can depend on me
I was walkin' alone, they all was countin' on me
I was locked in that cell and y'all didn't care about me
