[Intro: Adrien Broner]
Ayy

[Chorus: Adrien Broner]
I lost a lot of money, I lost friends, but all I want is the money back
Niggas saying they gon' rob me but I ain't worried 'bout none of that
I'm in some all black Off-White, I got the gun to match
You take a shot, I'm at your neck, like Rosa Parks I'm bussin back
Ayy, ayy, I don't really think these niggas know about me
Yeah I see they gas you up but I'll leave you on E
I see you niggas with these chains but y'all diamonds don't dance
You might see me with my ace but I won't show you my hand

[Verse 1: Adrien Broner]
100 thousand in my Nike box, my bougie bitch she like to shop
I can't pronounce the car I got, you see me when I drop the top
I'm feeling upper echelon, you niggas just a replica
My jewelry is irregular, you niggas need to step it up
Just put three hundred on my wrist, I stay clean 'cause I'm filthy rich
She told you she was celibate, she let me fuck 'cause I'm the shit
I'm the real, you counterfeit, you niggas is so fraudulent
All these diamonds got me lit, they loud, I think they arguing
Yea I got a big gun, chopper got a big drum
The Benz I got like Redd Foxx, I promise it's the big one
I'm really out here in the game, you niggas keep the bench warm
So I can't trust no bitch 'cause

[Chorus: Adrien Broner]
I lost a lot of money, I lost friends, but all I want is the money back
Niggas saying they gon' rob me but I ain't worried 'bout none of that
I'm in some all black Off-White, I got the gun to match
You take a shot, I'm at your neck, like Rosa Parks I'm bussin back
Ayy, ayy, I don't really think these niggas know about me
Yeah I see they gas you up but I'll leave you on E
I see you niggas with these chains but y'all diamonds don't dance
You might see me with my ace but I won't show you my hand

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
One in the morning, I'm going hard
Walking 'round with the foreign broads
Living my life like a rockstar
Before it came I could say I saw it
Nigga play games, up with the rod
I'ma fly in the sky like a shooting star
So much money could get me a black card
Steady dranking on Act, ain't no Wockhardt
Posted up, steady watching for cop cars
Twenty-four seven, we going in
Thirty-eight baby a block boy
We gon' trap round the clock from ten to ten
Spend it, it's coming right back again
Float 'round the city with Ben-10
Shootin' dice, me and AB
Shoot a ten then bet the ten
Shootin' dice, me and AB
Shoot a ten then bet the ten

[Chorus: Adrien Broner]
I lost a lot of money, I lost friends, but all I want is the money back
Niggas saying they gon' rob me but I ain't worried 'bout none of that
I'm in some all black Off-White, I got the gun to match
You take a shot, I'm at your neck, like Rosa Parks I'm bussin back
Ayy, ayy, I don't really think these niggas know about me
Yeah I see they gas you up but I'll leave you on E
I see you niggas with these chains but y'all diamonds don't dance
You might see me with my ace but I won't show you my hand
