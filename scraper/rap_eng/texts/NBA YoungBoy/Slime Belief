[Intro]
(Hey-ah, yeah, hey-ah, yeah, hey-ah, yeah, yeah)
(Hey-ah, yeah, hey-ah, yeah, ah) Hey ma, what it do?
(Straight up)

[Chorus]
If you want it, you got it, you know how I'm rockin’
They never could stop it, it's stuffed in my pocket
I got up for the score and they never could block it
After the show, I count up in a Masi'
Tears fall from the lies, despite
Hunnid bands through the time of the night
When you left, I ain’t wanna live life
Now I'm happy on the in and outside
Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Barettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Spin the block, finna stretch 'em
Wake the hood up when we wet 'em
And it's all gon' be alright, yeah
When that wrong choice take your life, yeah
Gucci pressure be on top of that Nike print
From them rich niggas kickin' yo’ back door
And they should give a Rollie to niggas who want it
Who don’t know a thing but trap, though
Blue faces, I put that over nat hoes
The shit that we sellin' will make you relapse, though
Thinkin’ I'm slippin', run up and get clapped, ho
I put that North on the map, ho (Gang)

[Verse 1]
Turn up on a bitch when I'm gone off a Perc
That ho gon’ fuck on a fast beat
Ben behind me, do the dash, keepin' up in a Vert
You get jacked out yo' shit, you can't text me
Pussy nigga throwin' shots, ain't at me
Strapped up, tell that nigga get at me
Tough love for a bitch, won't trap me
Pay for the body then I give them the MAC free
Got a pound in the car, I'ma smoke on that
Left the state for a show and I'm comin' back
If he say he want smoke, ain't no fallin' back
Want a bitch for the play, I'ma blow the strap
He ain't usin' his head, put it in his lap
He ain't 'bout it, could tell that he only rap
I just put 40 bands inside the trap
Every manifestation, I'm callin' rare (Gang)

[Chorus]
Now can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Barettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Tell Jugg bust a right, yeah
Hop out, gun flames through the night, yeah
You know how I'm rockin', you know that I'm with it
You loyal to me, I'll make sure that you get it
If you want it, you got it, you know how I'm rockin'
They never could stop it, it's stuffed in my pocket
I go up for the score and they never could block it
After the show, I count up in a Masi'
Tears fall from the lies, despite
Hunnid bands through the time of the night
When you left, I ain't wanna live life
Now I'm happy on the in and outside

[Verse 2]
Pick it up, throw it out, watch it come back
Got a whole hunnid racks in a Dior bag
Count up that money, I run up the sack
Boardin' on the jet with a illegal strap
The shit that they talk, I could tell you is cap
Up off the X and I only took half
Stay energized, I fall back from the tabs
Put a half in my way, I'ma pay off the staff
I feel like it ain't no bitch I can't have
Saint Laurent boot with the fur like a bear
Balenciaga, that Gucci, and Prada
I got on all three and I bought several pair
When it's up, what we slidin' in, duckin' from 12
Time wise, clockwise, I never fail (No)
Ain't no slackin', we hustlin', we on this for real
If we don't get it, we take it, you know what it is

[Chorus]
Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Barettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Barettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Now, can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Barettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Spin the block, finna stretch 'em
Wake the hood up when we wet 'em
And it's all gon' be alright, yeah
When that wrong choice take your life, yeah
Gucci pressure be on top of that Nike print (Shh)
From them rich niggas kickin' yo' back door
And they should give a Rollie to niggas who want it
Who don't know a thing but trap, though
Blue faces, I put that over nat hoes
The shit that we sellin' will make you relapse, though
Thinkin' I'm slippin', run up and get clapped, ho
I put that North on the map, ho (Gang)
