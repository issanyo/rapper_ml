[Chorus: Youngstar]
My lil' niggas say the brave 'round the corner
Fuck the blue and whites, they say the FED boys on us
Smae niggas up the road, same niggas in the streets
We ain't trippin' on no hoes, [?] for keeps
My lil' niggas say the brave 'round the corner
Fuck the blue and whites, they say the FED boys on us
Smae niggas up the road, same niggas in the streets
We ain't trippin' on no hoes, [?] for keeps

[Verse 1: Youngstar]
Floatin' round in a rental, I got multiple options
Really plugged to the source, I can triple the profit
Goin' mad with that bag, catch me flexin' up in Saks
This a house on my neck
I'm a boss cut the check
I was thuggin' 'fore the deal, ain't no secret how I'm livin'
Ask that Park I be gettin' it, hands on in them trenches
Mastermind, fuck a semi bag flew to ATL
Carolina on my mind, I be really causing hell
Fuck that line me up, I hold that shit down
On the road in the Sprinter, 'bout a 100 somethin' rounds
Pounds of that shit nigga know my people call that shit
Why you think I'm ridin' 'round tryna blow that shit
Gorilla hustlin' that's like every city that I'm in
I be plan it to win, give a fuck 'bout that
Me and Youngboy no they ain't wanted that
Fuck the promoter niggas, find me where the corner at

[Chorus: Youngstar]
My lil' niggas say the brave 'round the corner
Fuck the blue and whites, they say the FED boys on us
Smae niggas up the road, same niggas in the streets
We ain't trippin' on no hoes, [?] for keeps
My lil' niggas say the brave 'round the corner
Fuck the blue and whites, they say the FED boys on us
Smae niggas up the road, same niggas in the streets
We ain't trippin' on no hoes, [?] for keeps

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
If you lookin' for me nigga you can find me where the block at
Gettin' money nigga tell them bitches they can't stop that
Followed by a entourage nigga with 'bout ten straps
Any altercation hit at me and they gon' hit back
Dog hatin' on me musta thought I wouldn't gon' shake back
All my niggas strapped say what you need and they gon' send that
Drop your money off ain't gotta pull up where we be at
And I don't take no shorts so best believe I gotta see that
I'm floating 'round with dump in a Range Rover matte black
I'm coolin at the moxy, I just hopped up out the Maybach
Fuck the brave team, Carl told me not to say that
And fuck Parish prison they just waitin' on me to come back
Tonight I'm going off so I call 3 like where the K at
I never see a drought I got that lean by the case yea
Everybody want that shit we got it this that raw yeah
[?] need to watch that, [?]

[Chorus: Youngstar]
My lil' niggas say the brave 'round the corner
Fuck the blue and whites, they say the FED boys on us
Smae niggas up the road, same niggas in the streets
We ain't trippin' on no hoes, [?] for keeps
My lil' niggas say the brave 'round the corner
Fuck the blue and whites, they say the FED boys on us
Smae niggas up the road, same niggas in the streets
We ain't trippin' on no hoes, [?] for keeps
