[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
I been fucking everything, fucking everything, fucking everything
And I know it's wrong but it feels good when I'm doing my thing
'Cause it's hard to say no when all the hoes calling my name
So I'm fucking everything, so I'm fucking everything

[Verse 1: Damar Jackson]
I been fucking everything on the regular
Say she on her period, get that head from her
Beat around the bed, it wasn't big enough
Tried to take the condom off, I wasn't slick enough, yeah
I ain't even lying, girl I be the plan
Put a cape on my dick and call it Superman
Before you fall asleep, I done called the Uber man
Don't be stingy with the dick, you better tell a friend

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
('Cause I'm fucking everything, fucking everything)
I been fucking everything, fucking everything, fucking everything
And I know it's wrong but it feels good when I'm doing my thing
'Cause it's hard to say no when all the hoes calling my name
So I'm fucking everything, so I'm fucking everything

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I need your love for to comfort my pain
And I'm not, not for nobody, you the one that I claim
And I swear, to be with you I swear it drive me insane
Girl all for you I swear I'm willing to change
Say you wouldn't leave me but you took your shit and left
Always told you how I feel but you act like you ain't care
You say you can't go without me, really you don't need no help
Say you want to start a business, you can do that shit yourself
My heart divided, I can't lie, I love you boo
Still ain't decided, I gotta let go another rose
Everything we talk about, I swear that they'll never know
Say you never left the South, so many places we can go

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
('Cause I'm fucking everything, fucking everything)
I been fucking everything, fucking everything, fucking everything
And I know it's wrong but it feels good when I'm doing my thing
'Cause it's hard to say no when all the hoes calling my name
So I'm fucking everything, so I'm fucking everything

[Verse 3: Damar Jackson]
I don't know what the fuck it is
Everywhere I go, it's another fe' tryna fuck with me
Tried to pray to God, tried to go to church
But then all I see is another freak, Lord, please forgive me
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
I always end up fucking everything around me
That's why I'm out the country, just for new surroundings
You know I be wilding, aw yeah

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
('Cause I'm fucking everything, fucking everything)
I been fucking everything, fucking everything, fucking everything
And I know it's wrong but it feels good when I'm doing my thing
'Cause it's hard to say no when all the hoes calling my name
So I'm fucking everything, so I'm fucking everything

[Outro: Damar Jackson]
Everywhere that I pull up, I'm takin' me somethin' to go
And I know I gotta grow up, but this is the life that I chose
Fucking everything, fucking everything, yeah, nah nah nah nah
Fucking everything, fucking everything, yeah
