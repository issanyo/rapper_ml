[Hook: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Drinkin' on this potion steady fuckin' up my kidneys
Malu had just text me and she told me that she miss me
Fifty-thousand on me, I got all these hoes reachin'
Steady sendin' money to my brothers up in prison
Lil' [?] in my phone, he like, "Nigga, what the business?"
I told him, "Fuck the laws, you know that I'm still spinnin'"
Hit a nigga block with the quickness, hop out with that glizzy
Whack his partner, tell him come and find me
Bitch, I'm in the trenches
He like, "Bitch, I know you didn't"
Hoe, you know I did it
Send yo' brother to my show and, bitch, I'm tearin' up yo' city
Nigga said that he want smoke
Nigga know I'm with it
When I catch you we gon' stretch you
Put one in yo' fitted

[Hook: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space

[Verse 2: Lul G]
VVS on my chain be the cheat code
All these blues on a nigga ain’t no greens loafs
Hella rounds in the chop we don’t reload
Hundred round for the pussy nigga flee low
I can buy it all girl let me take you shopping
Landmark, Mark and Jacobs I can get you Prada
Oh yo nigga speaking down, oh he outta pocket
Never worry bout' ya nigga cuz' my shooter keep the rocket
Oh ya nigga wanna be me
Diamonds shine in the dark yeah they 3D
Sellin' out shows bitches wanna see me
Tired of nerd niggas actin' like they on me


[Hook: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
