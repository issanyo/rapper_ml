[Intro]
India
Mommy, India got the beats
Tennis chain, a hundred and ten thousand (A hundred and ten thousand)
We took some losses, spent some money, but we still ballin' (Still ballin')
Know when they hatin', straight from the gutter, I forever call it (Forever call it)
These niggas hatin', know they just wanna see my career fallin' (Wan' see me fall)

[Pre-Chorus]
He don't wanna see you with more money than him, that ain't your man
I take these Percs and pop that X to hide the pain
The way they crossed us, I swear it drive me insane
They drained my bank, they thought they took me out the game
I came back runnin' with some

[Chorus]
Top shottas, I paid 'em top dollars
Livin' like a Ruff Rider, they locked him up for violence
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He fell out of love, now he can never trust
They told him lies, he was depressed, they thought he gave it up
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He came back like a survivor, yeah

[Verse]
Pulled off in a Maybach (C'mon)
I came back whippin' the Rolls (In a Rolls)
I been betrayed by these niggas and hoes
But this is the life that I chose, yeah
Out the top of the roof in the middle the road, yeah
Forever slidin' 'bout my bros, yeah
Screamin' out, right or wrong, yeah
We gon' bust a nigga dome, yeah
Bullets flyin' like an army
Convicted felon bear arms and
Shoot the burner, hold it steady
Hit a nigga in the arm and leg
Hunger Games, Armageddon
You broke your promise, you was wrong for that
Went to jail all behind your love
Laid down and I came back
Steady scopin' (Scopin')
Wipe a nigga's nose, I say slatt
I'm steady workin', since I made it out that North I ain't look back
Jail time and the prayers on lockdown, writing songs on the rec
Now I'm boardin' on the jet with a Glock-9 and a bag full of racks
Talkin' down used to drive me insane
When I know I stayed true to this game
Bitches playin', steady sayin' my name
Niggas playin', we be slangin' that thing
I'm growin' up, tryna grow as man
Maintaining, elevating my brain
I know that I'm great so I'm never gon' settle
Won't value the money, won't value no change
Steady scopin' (Scopin')
Wipe a nigga's nose, I say slatt
This for Dump, spend every dime that I got to bring him back
Ran up my money, all my sons gon' have them racks and that's a fact (I ain't lyin')
I told D to do his time then come back grindin' with some

[Chorus]
Top shottas, I paid 'em top dollars
Livin' like a Rough Rider, they locked him up for violence
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He fell out of love, now he can never trust
They told him lies, he was depressed, they thought he gave it up
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He came back like a survivor, yeah

[Outro]
Top shottas, I paid 'em top dollars
Livin' like a Rough Rider, they locked him up for violence
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He fell out of love, now he can never trust
They told him lies, he was depressed, they thought he gave it up
He came back like a survivor, yeah
He came back like a survivor, yeah
