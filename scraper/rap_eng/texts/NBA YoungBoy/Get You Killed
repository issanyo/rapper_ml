[Intro]
DJ Swift on the track
They like I know who bust that nigga brain
Dubba-AA flex
Louie Bandz made another one
I know who bust that nigga brain
They like for real
They say them niggas out they game
They the youngins of the year
They say the smallest shit you do can get you killed
We up in broad day, so you better keep your [?], nigga

[Chorus]
I'm out that north, I don't give a fuck 'bout where you from
Nigga know how we comin', we come retarded when we come
You say you gon' kill me, so when you see me don't play dumb
That nigga dissed me, now that bitch ass nigga slumped
Big strap with that 40, it ain't no stuntin', he gon' dump
We uppin' in public, ain't stoppin' bustin' 'til you done
You gon' get the same treatment as the lil' boy that you sent
Niggas spin in my section, we loadin' up and comin' huntin'
Believe that

[Bridge]
This for them 38 babies who out that north
Who lay down low, who make the homicide detectives draw the chalk, that's what they 'bout
Them niggas posted that don't do nothin' but talk
So when we catch you, we gon' stretch you, we gon' close your fuckin' mouth

[Verse]
And all us certified, all us been on that walk
Gon' bust a nigga shit and ain't gon' speak on what we saw
We got assault rifles for whoever try to assault
Can raise your voice all you want or that choppa gon' talk loud
Up on me, you got me fucked up, bitch I doubt it
Hollow steady bouncin', might as well say that we ballin'
You know that from that north [?] fill bitches with [?]
Get to pickin' you lil' bitches, I was just like we havin' scoutin' (bet, bet, bet, bet)

[Bridge]
This for them 38 babies who out that north
Who lay down low, who make the homicide detectives draw the chalk, that's what they 'bout
Them niggas posted that don't do nothin' but talk
So when we catch you, we gon' stretch you, we gon' close your fuckin' mouth

[Chorus]
I'm out that north, I don't give a fuck 'bout where you from
Nigga know how we comin', we come retarded when we come
You say you gon' kill me, so when you see me don't play dumb
That nigga dissed me, now that bitch ass nigga slumped
Big strap with that 40, it ain't no stuntin', he gon' dump
We uppin' in public, ain't stoppin' bustin' 'til you done
You gon' get the same treatment as the lil' boy that you sent
Niggas spin in my section, we loadin' up and comin' huntin'
Believe that
