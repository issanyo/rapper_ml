[Intro: Montana & NBA Youngboy]
(City kinda fucked up right now)
I know pops
(Murder after murder)
Back to back
(Know who run that motherfuckin' gang nigga)
(Ain't none of my niggas crash)
(And that's something you don't too motherfuckin' top nigga)
Montana, I'ma stand on that

[Bridge]
I got it on my mind, yeah
Whole lotta bullets flyin', yeah
All my niggas slangin' iron, yeah
On my mama I ain't lyin', yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
These niggas be bitches, these bitches with 'em in disguise
They claimin' that they real but I can see it in they eyes
You know I'm out that gang and you know that I won't stop
Don't go against the grain, bitch we headed to the top

[Chorus]
You bitches don't want war with us
You niggas don't want war with us
You bitches don't want war with us
I'm screamin' "Who want war with us?"

[Verse 1]
Seven murders in one week, bitch it's crucial and it's wicked
Body after body, ain't no help up in my city
Homicide, you gon' die if you stuntin' like you with it
Caught 'em slippin', blowed his brains out, nobody said who did it
Now word around town, niggas say that I'ma get it
Some nigga told Cordasha they gon' put one in my fitted
Nigga all I know is murder, swear to God that I'm with it
And everything I talk up in my songs, you know I live it
We keep a gun on all of us, you know that I'ma spit it
They say that they want all of us, we right here in the city
You bitches don't want war with us, everybody gon' get it
Want a nigga for to follow us and he gon' end up missin'
Yeah, four choppas in the car, 400 shots up in the rental
My niggas ready for to spin, you know that I'll send 'em
Confidential, I'll never speak on who had killed him
And don't think that we ain't gon' get you cause you stay in Denham

[Bridge]
I got it on my mind, yeah
You know that I ain't hidin', yeah
I keep a gun when I be ridin', yeah
It's gon' be a homicide, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
These niggas be bitches, these bitches with 'em in disguise
They claimin' that they real but I can see it in they eyes
You know I'm out that gang and you know that I won't stop
Don't go against the grain, bitch we headed to the top

[Chorus]
You bitches don't want war with us
You niggas don't want war with us
You bitches don't want war with us
I'm screamin' "Who want war with us?"

[Verse 2]
My lil' partner, he go to work, he don't be fuckin' with nobody
You gon' die since you put a bullet up inside his body
All through Baton Rouge, nigga we been ridin' with them choppas
If I catch him, I'ma pop him, give a fuck 'bout what they hollerin'
Since I was a baby I was born to be violent
I'ma bust yo' fuckin' head and my confidence on highly
I be thinkin' 'bout killin' a nigga every time I'm smilin'
All my niggas wildin'
My girl be scared but she know that I'm bout it
Montana out his body, sayin' a nigga ain't gon' fuck with us
Baby Joe be thuggin' nigga knowin' that it's up with us
Cross me and it's stuck with us
We 'bout beef and niggas know that we ain't squashin' nothin'
Until we even, bitch

[Bridge]
I got it on my mind, yeah
Whole lotta niggas dyin', yeah
All my niggas slangin' iron, yeah
On my mama I ain't lyin', yeah

[Chorus]
You bitches don't want war with us
You niggas don't want war with us
You niggas don't want war with us
I'm screamin' "Who want war with us?"

[Outro]
You know what it is nigga
Murder gang
Ain't too long
Ain't too long until I'm gone
Ain't too long until we get what we been workin' for, believe that
Slime
