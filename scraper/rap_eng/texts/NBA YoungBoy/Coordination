[Chorus]
Feds got us on they billboards (got us on they billboards)
But you know that I ain't goin' for it (you know that I ain't goin' for it)
I stay hidden from the radar (hidden from the radar)
Under tint in them foreign cars (ayy)

[Verse 1]
Muhamed Ali, bitch come test me (come test me)
And watch how quick shit gon' get hectic (get hectic)
Me and my young niggas we reckless (dumber)
Bitch we know who really steppin' (baow)
I don't get no sleep, bitch I'm restless (I'm restless)
Five in the morning, I'm up
Droppin' the pints and you know that I'm at it (at it)
I'ma tell you when to come
My girl left early in the morning
Talkin' 'bout she goin' to get her hair done, bitch I ain't dumb
I can play the same game, call a bitch over to the hotel room and I'm bustin' her up
Nigga on my dick inside the club
Sayin' he got bricks, I'ma get him drunk
Money on deck, meet me by the truck
I don't give a fuck, Ben stick 'em up
On the phone, bitch I'm runnin' it with dump
Nigga pull up, man I'm finna come
Me and Jordan Dixon riding through that North
Down 38th, strapped with a pump
Birdman got that dogfood up in valley park, posted up goin' dumb
Kevin Gates, I remember we was young
Strapped up bitch, forty with a drum
Yeah, bitch I'm gettin' it
Straight out the North, bitch I come straight out them trenches
No handouts, yeah you know I had to get it
Know how I'm living, AI YoungBoy I'm the sickest

[Chorus]
Feds got us on they billboards (got us on they billboards)
But you know that I ain't goin' for it (you know that I ain't goin' for it)
I stay hidden from the radar (hidden from the radar)
Under tint in them foreign cars (ayy)

[Verse 2]
They ain't believe that I did it
Was runnin' and jumpin' them fences
Forty Glock in my britches
Tell that nigga he can get it
They ain't believe that I did it
Was runnin' and jumpin' them fences
Forty Glock in my britches
Tell that nigga he can get it
Tall gall, stand tall, had to turn my phone off
Pray to living God that I never ever fall off
Really going in, I'm headed for the powerball
Missed call, call log, had to turn my phone off
Diamonds in my teeth and you knowin' that I'll eat you out
Fuck you real good, yeah you knowin' what I'm really 'bout
Scuffed real good, yeah you know we could fight it outs
Strapped up good, what you mean, we could shoot it out
Dumb, ayy, hold up
Dumb, ayy, hold up
Dumb, ayy, hold up
Dumb, ayy, hold up

[Chorus]
Feds got us on they billboards (got us on they billboards)
But you know that I ain't goin' for it (you know that I ain't goin' for it)
I stay hidden from the radar (hidden from the radar)
Under tint in them foreign cars (ayy)
Yeah, bitch I'm gettin' it
Straight out the North, bitch I come straight out them trenches
No handouts, yeah you know I had to get it
Know how I'm living, AI YoungBoy I'm the sickest
