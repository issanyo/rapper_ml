[Intro]
Yea
This for all my fans who been fucking with my music for a lil minute
I don't know what's wrong with these niggas

[Verse 1: NBA Youngboy]
Woke up this morning in the Lotus Hotel
Look out my window and I'm starring at the hills
I'm moving up shit finally getting real
How I feel I should be up there less than a year
I gotta get it nigga knowing what it is
Got a family counting on me so you knowing whats the deal Draw down, give it up, nigga knowing what the drill
Young nigga I'm just tryna get a mill
I'm from Baton Rouge where they wildin' off the pills
You ain't from where I'm from
You don't feel how I feel
Everyday strapped up
You don't live how I live
Police killing us and the police getting killed
I got so many niggas waiting on an appeal
Most of my niggas dead and we still shedding tears
Watch ya homeboy he fake, he ain't really real
Shit I ain't trippin' I'm just focused on my career
Just stopped by Booma, bought a 9 with a dick it
32 shots in the Glock I won't be a victim
Ain't no waiting Ima shoot till' a nigga tempt me
When I up two tips out the clip zip em
Soon as the pack tryna tax you know we gone rip ya
38 baby I put on for them young niggas
Tell them niggas we the motherfucking sickest in the city
And we don't do no motherfucking scare business

[Chorus: NBA Youngboy]
Where I'm from it get wicked shit real
No you ain't safe where I live
Any age you can get killed
Gunshots broad day where I live
Fuck the law , free my bros out of jail
Running with the same niggas 'til the end
NBA Gang la familia , no we don't do no friends
Where I'm from it get wicked shit real
No you ain't safe where I live
Any age you can get killed
Gunshots broad day where I live
Fuck the law , free my bros out of jail
Running with the same niggas 'til the end
NBA Gang la familia , no we don't do no friends

[Verse 2: NBA Youngboy]
In my zone going hard right now
I won't stop till' the top where I'm going right now
I ain't lying I'm going in it's my time right now
All day working I ain't taking calls right now
KD got the cannabis card, where the smoke at?
In California I'm with Eli we on Fairfax
Walking out the Supreme store with two bags
Make that shit, spend that shit, get it right back
Montana asking everybody where the hoes at
Kill time smoking joe's where the laws at ?
Hollywood Boulevard walking with that sack
Tell the truth I'm just living it up
I'm just stating facts
When I spit ima snap when I'm on the track
Another youngin fucking with me tell me where he at
(Another youngin fucking with me tell me where he at)
Ain't from where I'm from , live how I live
Yea ...

[Chorus: NBA Youngboy]
Where I'm from it get wicked shit real
No you ain't safe where I live
Any age you can get killed
Gunshots broad day where I live
Fuck the law , free my bros out of jail
Running with the same niggas 'til the end
NBA Gang la familia , no we don't do no friends
Where I'm from it get wicked shit real
No you ain't safe where I live
Any age you can get killed
Gunshots broad day where I live
Fuck the law , free my bros out of jail
Running with the same niggas 'til the end
NBA Gang la familia , no we don't do no friends
