[Intro]
Dubba A flex
Drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
Movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby
This is the sound

[Verse 1]
They say Kentrell got a baby, he ain't nothin' but thirteen
They told me that he needed love, he couldn't pay for what he need
They said he said he don't feel love and he so caught in these streets
They say he plottin' to kill himself because he just wanna leave
Plus he ain't happy with himself 'cause what he want he can't keep
He feel like he won't make it out because his problems too deep
He had a shootout in the south, his friend got hit with that heat
He startin' to have some crazy thoughts, he put tattoos on his sleeve
He got one tatted by his eye, it symbolizes Nene
He swear to never tell no lie 'cause that's not what he believe
He keep a pistol when he ride but still feel like he gon' leave
They say that girl not on his side because he gave her herpes

[Chorus]
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
They say he movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
They say he movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby

[Verse 2]
They say his miss just walked in on him, he was playin' with some fire
They say he mentioned to his nigga he might blow out his mind
Say he been lookin' real suspicious, they can tell he been cryin'
They say he steady waitin' on somethin', he keep his eyes on the time
They hear the headphones on his head playin' Luther Vandross, baby (sayin this home not a home)
They read his wall it was written up in hand he got a dead soul, baby
They say he headed onto the land to hear his grandma call, baby
He said they don't understand who I am, they all think I'm goin' crazy

[Chorus]
They say he headed onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
I say I'm drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
I say I'm headed onto the land where the gate close, yeah

[Verse 3]
They say go get that out his hand, he on the porch with a choppa
They say he took like 7 Xans, he say he's helpin' his problems
He say he cannot trust a girl, he got no love for his momma
And he got used while he was up, he feel he back at the bottom
They say his body actin' up, he don't want go to the doctor
They say they see he givin' up, he don't want no talk 'bout no dollar
His only trust is for to run because his past gon' follow
They say this nigga dressin' crazy, he won't put down his collar

[Chorus]
They say he headed onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
I say I'm drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
I say I'm headed onto the land where the gate close, baby

[Outro]
Drawin' symbols in the sand 'til the pain gone, baby
This is the sound
Movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby
I say I'm drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
I say I'm headed onto the land where the gate close, baby
