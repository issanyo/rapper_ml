[Intro]
Livin' it up, yeah
I'ma talk to 'em right quick

[Chorus]
Live it up
That's just what I'ma do cause I ain't never had nothin', yeah
Humble yourself, I feel nobody real as us
But everybody great at some', yeah
Who is you? Why you here? You wasn't around some years ago (Who is you?)
Why would I beef with them and they ain't never killed before? (Ain't never shoot)
Know why the bullshit comin' fast, 'cause I'm livin' slow (That sound true)
Admit I put my past behind me, but I ain't let it go

[Verse 1]
I'm from place where you'll never go
They'll kill you at the corner store
Remember strugglin' with my brother
We hotboxed the car with hella smoke
Now I got money, nothin' changed, we still doin' it though
People callin', askin' for money, not worried 'bout how I'm doin', so, yeah
This from the heart, I knew this from the start
This rap shit don't mean nothing in real life (Tell 'em)
I'm just keepin' it real, don't give fuck how you feel
Recordin' now, not many rounds, but on the floor, got my steel
'Cause I know shit can get tragic
When you stop thinkin', that's when some shit gon' happen
For somethin' he want, you know you got
He take you 'way from your family
Now you in a casket
'Round ones you won't be huggin' no more
Wishin' you never fucked with them niggas you was callin' your bro

[Chorus]
Live it up
That's just what I'ma do cause I ain't never had nothin', yeah
Humble yourself, I feel nobody real as us
But everybody great at some', yeah
Who is you? Why you here? You wasn't around some years ago
Why would I beef with them and they ain't never killed before?
Know why the bullshit comin' fast, 'cause I'm livin' slow
Admit I put my past behind me, but I ain't let it go

[Verse 2]
I'm steady wishin' we'd move on
I been sleepin' alone all at night, I been strong every night
I had no motive for the shit that I be doin'
And I feel I can't go wrong, I tell no lie
Oh, I tell no lie
Hahaha, yeah

[Bridge]
Livin' it up, livin' it up, yeah
Livin' it up, livin' it up
Livin' it up, livin' it up, yeah
Livin' it up, livin' it up (Slatt)

[Chorus]
Live it up
That's just what I'ma do cause I ain't never had nothin', yeah
Humble yourself, I feel nobody real as us
But everybody great at some', yeah
Who is you? Why you here? You wasn't around some years ago
Why would I beef with them and they ain't never killed before?
Know why the bullshit comin' fast, 'cause I'm livin' slow
Admit I put my past behind me, but I ain't let it go

[Outro]
Livin' it up, livin' it up, yeah
Who is you? Why you here? You wasn't around some years ago
Livin' it up, livin' it up, yeah
Why would I beef with them and they ain't never killed before?
Livin' it up, livin' it up, yeah
Know why the bullshit comin' fast, because I'm livin' slow
Livin' it up, livin' it up, yeah
Admit I put my past behind me, but I ain't let it go
