[Intro]
Hustler’s ambition nigga, yeah
Everybody wanna ball

[Verse 1]
Gucci shirt with a snake up on it
Whole lot of chains around my neck, I got that bag on me
I pray to god ain’t no snakes around me
Tell every nigga that I love I’ll give my last to him
Now this here shit gon’ get hectic
How can you judge but ain’t met me?
I swear that they don’t know the half about me
‘Cause I’m seventeen, shit don’t mean a thing
On my gang, ain’t no tempting me
Bitch it’s murder, all my niggas play for keeps
I’m finally up and I’m making cake
OG driving me state to state
Out of line, bitch I break your face
We gon’ burn ‘em, that’s out the gate
Kyle just beat his murder case
Now he back on another case
Talked to Von just the other day
Safe the judge took his bond away
I been grindin’, tryna make a way
Shit I take a chance every day
Talked to moms and she said be safe
‘Cause she know that these niggas take
I be gone on the interstate
New deposit just came today
Fuck these niggas, it’s strictly gang
Let them play, catch one to the brain
Fuck the fame, I won’t never change
Bitch it’s pressure behind my name
It get wicked ‘bout money
These niggas change on they mans
Swear these niggas ain’t solid
Tell everything on the stand
I keep it on me, run up on me
Watch how quick you get bam

[Chorus]
He say he want it with us, bet
We gon’ see about it
Play with me , bitch you get stretched
I keep them hitters ‘round me
You gon’ get slaughtered
We don’t spare nobody
Only my gang up in my circle
You can’t hang around me
So please don’t come around me
Please don’t come around me
Please don’t come around me
Don’t come around me

[Verse 2]
I know these bitch niggas hate my name
Probably wan' take me for the fame
I ain’t trippin' 'cause that burner stay with me
Rob who, rob who? tell that bitch I dare 'em
Approach me and we gon’ slam
Like ho ass nigga play with me
Think I’m a bitch, well come and see
Police gon’ cover you in sheets
We flatline shit when we creep
Be a duck and flap your feet
We step on shit when it’s beef
We serve whoever we see
Shoot back at who? you must be sleep
We gon’ kill your whole street

[Chorus]
He say he want it with us, bet
We gon’ see about it
Play with me , bitch you get stretched
I keep them hitters 'round me
You gon’ get slaughtered
We don’t spare nobody
Only my gang up in my circle
You can’t hang around me
So please don’t come around me
Please don’t come around me
Please don’t come around me
Don’t come around me
