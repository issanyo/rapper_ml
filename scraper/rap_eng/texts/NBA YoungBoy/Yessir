[Intro]
How you been?
All is well
I'm in my house right now, I'm in the studio
Dubba-AA flex
You cool?
Yeah, we is now
But look, I'm finna finish this song
For sure

[Chorus]
Ask how I been, and I respond "all is well"
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, eh
Was you unhappy when your loved one had left?
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, eh

[Verse 1]
I been beatin' the game up, for days I'm locked in the booth
And I been gettin' my change up so I can shit on you
I thought that I was coldhearted, I ain't got shit on you
This just ain't wrap up in the booth, I put some diamonds on my tooth
They say I'm overrated, I say I'm outdated
Grab the game and play it
Watchin' smilin' faces, through the day I'm thankin' god I made it
Respect, boy I raise it
Four lil' boys, I need another baby
Houston for the races, lot of rocks, just thank the plug it came in
Thank you for your time, I'm doin' fine, yes sir
I cherish every element, respect the grind, yes sir
Admit that I'm not celibate, I'm chasin' mine, yes sir
Not wastin' time, no sir, I catch right back up with her

[Chorus]
Ask how I been, and I respond "all is well"
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, eh
Was you unhappy when your loved one had left?
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, eh

[Verse 2]
When you was gone I turned up bad on 'em, had to show my ass on 'em
Carry Louis bags on 'em, and they full of cash on 'em
Niggas in they feelings on my ass, mad that I'm shittin' on 'em
Heard a nigga say he want it, I'ma put them hitters on him
Disrespectful manner, change the channel if you don't wanna hear it
Diamonds on me dancin', and I know for a fact you see it
Hold that bitch for ransom, hold her up just if you wanna knee it
Told her saddle up 'cause bitches up that pussy, but I beat it

[Bridge]
Yeah, I ain't lyin', bitch I do this shit (ask how I been, and I respond "all is well")
And I love this shit to death, that's on my soul nigga (yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yeah)
I been doin' well, though (was you unhappy when your loved one had left?)
All is well, what about you? (yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yeah)

[Chorus]
Ask how I been, and I respond "all is well"
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, eh
Was you unhappy when your loved one had left?
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, eh
