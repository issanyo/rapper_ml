CHORUS:

They wun one hunnid or loyal
But I can say that I knew
Quick to run off alone, cause on know what to do
I dont want talk, leave me lone, ain trynna be rude
Back to back rolling up, thinking bout my next move
On erything i won't fold
Maintain to get through
In this life that im living, either you win or you lose
On everything i won't fold
Maintain to get through
In this life that im living, either you win or you lose

VERSE 1
I do this shit to make it better

Posted up in the trenches servin' just me and my niggas
Keep erything on the low ain puttin' you up in my bidness
Watch who you dealing with, these niggas outchea they snitchin'. Kel runnin' some shit, ace do i got it i get it
I go to war bout them benjis, stand up
For what i believe in
Drinking on muddy im leanin'
This shit hea got me dreamin' but you know that im focused
Hold it in i can't hold it
Whole table filled with wit white, but no it ain snowing
I thought you was my boy
Loyalty before royal

CHORUS:
They wun one hunnid or loyal
