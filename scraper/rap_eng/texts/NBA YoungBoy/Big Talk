[Intro]
What up, Rippah?

[Verse 1]
I come from posted on the block with them hot boys
Seven of us ridin' on a bike, totin' them fire rods
A smoker showed me how to sit and make the powder
Von showed me never go to sleep, he press all the cards
Bitch, what it is? We can talk about it
Skinny nigga, pockets thick, my bitch got a wide body
Hoppin' off the jet and I got twenty racks in every pocket
Cross get set on fire, niggas die if you try to stop me
Jail cells, I was only 12, gettin' put in them
Hood hoes tryna come up off you, I grew up with them
Snake niggas, straight up hatin' niggas, bitch, I run with them
Fuck niggas with that sneak dissin', I ain't hearin' them
Hold on, now let me turn up on a ho
Your favorite rapper rattin' on the low
Hundred shots in that cutter, we got that Chevy sittin' low
And my youngins, they reckless, blow all the hinges off your door
Shoot that forty twenty times, they gon' start callin' one time
And I remember one time, I think it was in '09
And I couldn't seem to stop cryin', mama put me on medics
And I never took Ritalin, a real killer, unapologetic
Bitch, and we forever steppin', hit a nigga with that fire
Boomer really slang that iron, behind it I caught bodies raw
Let me talk my shit, matter fact, check out my Diddy Bop
You all steady runnin' wild, fifty in that forty Glock, c'mon

[Chorus]
Old niggas on that old shit, it's a young nigga time
A bigger picture, bigger difference, it's a young nigga rhyme
Head over water, he say all he do is step with that iron
Catch that nigga slippin', knock his heart from out his chest with that iron
Big boss, that lil' nigga with that big talk
Cutter got a big spark, Lil Ben let that stick off
Plus half of these niggas, I could tell you what your bitch 'bout
Richer than your daddy, with my moms in a big house

[Verse 2]
Young nigga pull up with them shooters and I fold you
I won't ever let these niggas get me, that's a no-no
High definition, VVS's, on my son, ho
What is shit you could do that hurt me when I'm done, ho?
Tryna bust a nigga head, and I'm like, "Yes, sir, yes, sir"
Got some shit up in my trunk'll rip a nigga's vest up
Shawty tryna fuck a nigga, she want me to bless her
Cousin killed by Fat Phil, she don't know we stretched him
Gave some molly to that bitch, now she wanna do somethin'
Couldn't rep that violence with the thirty, youngin tryna shoot somethin'
Out on Holly, past 1:30, bitch, we tryna move somethin'
In the morning, was flashin' early, I was goin' through somethin'

[Chorus]
Old niggas on that old shit, it's a young nigga time
A bigger picture, bigger difference, it's a young nigga rhyme
Head over water, he say all he do is step with that iron
Catch that nigga slippin', knock his heart from out his chest with that iron
Big boss, that lil' nigga with that big talk
Cutter got a big spark, Lil B'll let that stick off
Plus half of these niggas, I could tell you what your bitch 'bout
Richer than your daddy, with my moms in a big house
