[Intro]
Mhm
Aye, aye, Youngboy
Slime
Slime
This is the sound

[Chorus]
I felt like I can do it all, so I ain't want no help
I always thought that I can fall, I was scared of myself
I never trusted none of y'all 'cause I was worried 'bout death
So many people not around who said they stay, but they left
I keep my bible on my right and keep my Glock on my left
I thought that human's feelings fake, so when they say, I ain't care
Now I'm regettin' that I ain't say, I never told how I felt
I'ma do my shit until these bitches get so mad that they melt

[Verse]
I see these bitches start to change soon as the fame appealin'
Go against the grain, I'll bust yo' brain
Won't say the pain I'm feelin'
You changed yo' clique, I stayed the same, my niggas hang a nigga
My nigga ain't won't bust his brain but them prices temptin'
Am I the reason everybody come around and start to leavin'?
I don't know (I don't know)
I ever found out that you was leechin', I won't stop 'til we get even and you know (and bitch you know)
That I
I was 100 'til I got broken hearted, yeah
You couldn't much finish all the shit that you started, uh-huh
Focused on this because I think they disarm me
I shoot this bitch all by myself with no army
Before I sleep, though, I think everything you was sayin'
I was too deep, though, she ain't understand who I am
I'm in the streets, though, I came a long way from the can
Memories keep me happy, so I'm doin' my dance
She here for me, though, I told her, "Hit me up when you land,"
And she so street, though, I filled her bank account up with bands
I feel I can't tho', she always tell me that I can
She all for me, she said, "Let's rock and roll," I don't give a damn
You know that I'm thuggin', you know that I'm with it, you talk to them bitches and say how I'm livin'
You let all of them hoes fuck with yo' mind and go against me and you listen
Life on the line, cases still pendin'
But I stole a car, we still spinnin'
Talkin' to you, 'fore you left, you was in it
We gon' hit the gas soon as I spit it
Warm it up, wanna ass 'til they feel it
Want smoke, give 'em gas, I feel it
Thought that I came to the town that I did it
Straight out the north, I did time in the prison
All is well, must love, no tension (yessir)
Murder Gang (yessir) and everyone (yessir) in my business (yessir)
Maserati truck (yessir) soon as I hit it (yessir)
Money talk and I listen

[Chorus]
I felt like I can do it all, so I ain't want no help
I always thought that I can fall, I was scared of myself
I never trusted none of y'all 'cause I was worried 'bout death
So many people not around who said they stay, but they left
I keep my bible on my right and keep my Glock on my left (keep my Glock on my left)
I thought that human's feelings fake, so when they say, I ain't care
Now I'm regettin' that I ain't say, I never told how I felt
I'ma do my shit until these bitches get so mad that they melt

[Outro]
(And they still don't understand)
Understand me
(And they still don't understand)
Understand me
(And I ain't feelin' what I'm sayin')
Understand me
(And they still don't understand)
Understand me
