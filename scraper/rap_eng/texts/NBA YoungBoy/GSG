[Verse 1]
Painful shit
Say lil' nigga who you playing wit?
Disrespect my gang, that's that shit that get yo' man slit
Fuck 'bout how you come in, who you wit'?

We gone pull up where they be, hop out and let that choppa spit
Young nigga stay with a burner on 'em
Let him run up on me, he a goner
I don't cut corners, you know how I'm comin'
Don't fuck with them boys from 'round the corner
I feel like them lil' niggas up to somethin'
Say lil' boy you ain't takin' nothin'
KK tellin' me don't worry 'bout 'em
Fuck that man, I'm spinnin' on 'em
One call to bail, I know he comin'
Thousand shots kill a whole army
Bitch come here, no it ain't no runnin'
One to the head gon' put him under
One call to bail, I know he comin'
Thousand shots put a nigga under
Bitch come here, no it ain't no runnin'
One to the head gon' put him under


[Chorus]
I walk around with a GSG
Shootin', you ain't gotta test me
I pull up that gang and they with me
I know they gone bang behind me
I walk around with a GSG
Shootin', you ain't gotta test me
I pull up that gang and they with me
I know they gone bang behind me
This for whoever wanna kill me, eh, eh, uh (What up? Come on)
This for whoever wanna kill me, eh, eh, uhh
This for whoever wanna kill me, eh, eh, uhh
We make it happen by any means
I'ma make you niggas feel me, gang

[Verse 2]
That GSG look like a carbon, say lil' nigga you don't want it
I give him the word and they on it, NBA pullin' up like the army
That GSG look like a carbon, say lil' nigga you don't want it
I give him the word and they on it, NBA pullin' up like the army
I got that hammer stuffed up in my jeans
Make a nigga beat it up like Billie jean
100 shell cases left on the scene, Miami, Florida bitch we bringin' the heat
Who the fuck do you take me for, playin' wit' me ?
33 got a Glock, a whole 23
Once he up, he ain't skippin' a beat
Once he up, he ain't skippin' a beat

[Chorus]
I walk around with a GSG
Shootin', you ain't gotta test me
I pull up that gang and they with me
I know they gone bang behind me
I walk around with a GSG
Shootin', you ain't gotta test me
I pull up that gang and they with me
I know they gone bang behind me
This for whoever wanna kill me, eh, eh, uh (What up? Come on)
This for whoever wanna kill me, eh, eh, uhh
This for whoever wanna kill me, eh, eh, uhh
We make it happen by any means
I'ma make you niggas feel me, gang

[Outro]
