[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
You can’t short me out my money, I want all of that
Post up in them trenches where them killers and them robbers at
When I press that button, ain’t no surrender, ain’t no fallin' back
Tell that nigga I’ma kill him, hang up, and he callin' back
Like fuck that
When it's up, ain't no down, every minute we ridin' round
Every bullet a hollow, that's 30 rounds
You know I make profit off every pound
He 'posed to be stackin' with me, but he tryna finesse me
I don't see myself goin' down
50 bands, with a whole 100 rounds
Judgement Day, we gone burn up the town
Sick of recording, am I tired of gettin' money? That's never a [?]
Every day I be runnin' from night to the morning
Get it in in the rain, get it in while it's sunny
I'ma run up a check
Every day I go harder, it never stop comin'
Niggas bitches, they don't like how I'm stuntin'
Brand new McLaren, and it's over 300

[Chorus: NBA YoungBoy]
Run it up, take it all, and bring that shit to my grave
And I can't seem to get it right, spent damn near half what I made
And I came from the block where it's storming
And I came from them trenches by my lonely
And I came from the block where it's storming (I came)
And I came from them trenches by my lonely (I came)
And I came from the block where it's storming (I came)
And I came from them trenches by my lonely
Run it up, take it all, and bring that shit to my grave
And I can't seem to get it right, spent damn near half what I made
And I came from the block where it's storming
And I came from them trenches by my lonely
And I came from the block where it's storming (I came)
And I came from them trenches by my lonely (I came)
And I came from the block where it's storming (I came)
And I came from them trenches by my lonely

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
From the bottom, through the middle, made it to the top
A couple storms slowed me down, but I never stopped (I didn't)
I'm always in the studio, they waitin' on me to drop (let's go)
You blew yo whole deal on chains, now that's all you got (broke)
Must be a sale goin' on (why?) they buyin' loyalty (that's crazy)
My nigga never comin' home (nope)
Still payin' lawyer fees (that's crazy)
You think you hit rock bottom? Never been as low as me (you ain't)
Illegal trips out of town, nobody rolled with me
No doors, late nights, can't swerve, trunk full of Eddie Kane
Made it safe, thank god, didn't splurge, I'm married to the game
Self made Millionaire, I hear you talkin', I don't really care
Got perfect memory, trust me, I know who's really there

[Chorus: NBA YoungBoy]
Run it up, take it all, and bring that shit to my grave
And I can't seem to get it right, spent damn near half what I made
And I came from the block where it's storming
And I came from them trenches by my lonely
And I came from the block where it's storming (I came)
And I came from them trenches by my lonely (I came)
And I came from the block where it's storming (I came)
And I came from them trenches by my lonely
Run it up, take it all, and bring that shit to my grave
And I can't seem to get it right, spent damn near half what I made
And I came from the block where it's storming
And I came from them trenches by my lonely
And I came from the block where it's storming (I came)
And I came from them trenches by my lonely (I came)
And I came from the block where it's storming (I came)
And I came from them trenches by my lonely
