[Intro]
Playboy on this bitch but he ain't playin' though

[Chorus]
Cut my ties with my people, now my grandfather poppin'
Ran it up, all by myself though, now they never gon' stop me
And I see they say I flop though (yeah, yeah)
In my head I know what I know
Oh, and I said
I count fifties, all in hundreds, that's that time flow baby
I say stop it, no comparisons on that time now baby
And, oh yeah, I cannot keep it off my mind
Now, oh yeah, they cannot seem to keep up now
I been hidin' from attention on the rise
I didn't respond and now they see me on the rise
I got some sense up in my head now
I'm on my shit and I'm not scared now

[Verse 1]
Slander my name, I ain't do shit to nobody
Relationship goes to the ones with the problems
She wanted space and she got it
Talk about babies, only got three children
I ain't want no part and I swear ain't kidding
Gave her my love, now she say she don't feel me
And I been betrayed, it ain't no forgiving

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm riding in a new Maybach, yeah
Walk with a whole lotta racks, yeah
Tote on a whole lotta straps, yeah
Push a nigga shit way back, yeah
Heart cold as a bitch, no cap, yeah
Fuck nigga play get splat, yeah
Fuck what they say, state facts, yeah
Kill the whole world with these racks, yeah
I feel I'm right, they say that I been wrong my whole life
Thought that was life, but since it's not, I keep my soul tight
'Cause I came from the bottom
Can't make you forever be with somebody
'Til the day I'm not heard, I'ma stack every dollar
I'ma blow out the brain when I feel that I got 'em

[Chorus]
Cut my ties with my people, now my grandfather poppin'
Ran it up, all by myself though, now they never gon' stop me
And I see they say I flop though (yeah, yeah)
In my head I know what I know
Oh, and I said
I count fifties, all in hundreds, that's that time flow baby
I say stop it, no comparisons on that time now baby
And, oh yeah, I cannot keep it off my mind
Now, oh yeah, they cannot seem to keep up now
I been hidin' from attention on the rise
I didn't respond and now they see me on the rise
I got some sense up in my head now
I'm on my shit and I'm not scared now

[Verse 2]
Tryna do better, they know that I'm wit' it
I kill ever nigga, I listen to critics
I see what they sayin' and I know I'm not trippin'
How the fuck can you just put me in that position
They postin' that shit, tryna send me to prison
How the fuck do I supposed to take care of my children
I be flippin' that money, it stack to the ceiling
Why the fuck should I care and I know that I'm with it?
Let a nigga come try me, it's gon' be a murder
How the fuck I'ma die with no snake in my circle
How the fuck he gon' do when this nigga a serpent
He claim he a boss, but this nigga a worker
If I nut in that bitch, it's gon' cum 'cause I'm fertile
That's as far as it go, it won't go any further
Ride in the car on the back of the curtains
If I beat it, the fuck, I might as well dirt her

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm riding in a new Maybach, yeah
Walk with a whole lotta racks, yeah
Tote on a whole lotta straps, yeah
Push a nigga shit way back, yeah
Heart cold as a bitch, no cap, yeah
Fuck nigga play get splat, yeah
Fuck what they say, state facts, yeah
Kill the whole world with these racks, yeah
I feel I'm right, they say that I been wrong my whole life
Thought that was life, but since it's not, I keep my soul tight
'Cause I came from the bottom
Can't make you forever be with somebody
'Til the day I'm not heard, I'ma stack every dollar
I'ma blow out the brain, when I feel that I got 'em

[Chorus]
I count fifties, all in hundreds, that's that time flow baby
I say stop it, no comparisons on that time now baby
And, oh yeah, I cannot keep it off my mind
Now, oh yeah, they cannot seem to keep up now
I been hidin' from attention on the rise
I didn't respond and now they see me on the rise
I got some sense up in my head now
I'm on my shit and I'm not scared now
