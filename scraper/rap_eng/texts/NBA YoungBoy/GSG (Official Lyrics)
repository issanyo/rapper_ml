[Chorus]
I walk around with a GSG, shootin' you ain't gotta tempt me
I pull up that gang they with me, I know they gon' bang behind me
I walk around with a GSG, shootin' you ain't gotta tempt me
I pull up that gang they with me, I know they gon' bang behind me

[Post-Chorus]
This for whoever wanna kill me (ay, ay, ahh)
This for whoever wanna kill me (ay, ay, ahh)
This for whoever wanna kill me (ay, ay, ahh)
We make it happen by any means, Ima make you niggas feel me (gang)

[Verse 1]
Say lil nigga who you playin' wit
Disrespect my gang, that's that shit that get your man set
Fuck behind you who you comin' wit, we ain't sparin' shit

Young nigga stay with a burner on him
Let 'em run up on me he a goner
I don't cut corners know how I'm comin'
Don't fuck with them boys from 'round the corner
I feel like them lil niggas up to some'n
Say lil boy you ain't takin' nothin'

Bitch come here, no it ain't no runnin', one to the head gon' put 'em under

Bitch come here, no it ain't no runnin', one to the head gon' put 'em under

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
That GSG look like a carbon (carbon)
Say lil nigga you don't want it (you don't want it)
I give 'em the red and they on it (they on it)
NBA pullin' up like the army (get 'em)
That GSG look like a carbon (carbon)
Say lil nigga you don't want it (you don't want it)
I give 'em the red and they on it (they on it)
NBA pullin' up like the army (let's go)
I got that hammer stuffed up in my jeans
Make a nigga beat it like Billy Jean
A hundred shell cases left on the scene
Miami, Florida, bitch we bringin' the heat
Who the fuck do you take me for playin' with me
3Three got a Glock, hold twenty-three
Once he up he ain't skippin' a beat
Once he up he ain't skippin' a beat

[Chorus]
I walk around with a GSG, shootin' you ain't gotta tempt me
I pull up that gang they with me, I know they gon' bang behind me
I walk around with a GSG, shootin' you ain't gotta tempt me
I pull up that gang they with me , I know they gon' bang behind me

[Post-Chorus]
This for whoever wanna kill me (ay, ay, ahh)
This for whoever wanna kill me (ay, ay, ahh)
This for whoever wanna kill me (ay, ay, ahh)
We make it happen by any means, Ima make you niggas feel me (gang)
