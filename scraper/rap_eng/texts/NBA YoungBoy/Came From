[Chorus]
I'll never forget about what you did to me
I'll never forget 'bout what you what you told me
Shit hurt so deep can't lie you showed but I'ma run my bands up
Fuck everybody that had changed up
Shit I remember we ain't had nun, look what we done came from
I heard somebody said they said something
What the fuck you mean these niggas can't tell me nun
Look where we came from
I heard somebody said they said something
What the fuck you mean these niggas can't tell me nun

[Verse 1]
I never forget what papa told me
This shit ain't nothing like the old days
I'll never go back to my old ways, all the lies they told me
Thought you was true but shit you showed me
I was 1hunnit you weren't real with me
Got time for the think and I thought about it
I gotta watch who I bring around me
After all this shit ion't trust nobody
Call up my phone tryna come around me
In the Maybach alone ion't need nobody
Go watch for myself ion't need nobody
Go hard in the booth when I get inside it
Turn up in this bitch I'm in full throttle
Know I'm blessed but I'm sick of the fame
To tell the truth you ain't feeling my pain
Whole lot of money for my chain, I just charge it to the game
Go above and beyond for my gang
Send a shot through the dash in the lane
All the shit they done said, you know I ain't forget a thang

[Hook]
Did me
I'll never forget bout what you what you told me
Shit hurt so deep can't lie you showed but I'ma run my bands up
Fuck everybody that had changed up
Shit I remember we ain't had nun, look what we done came from
I heard somebody said they said something
What the fuck you mean these niggas can't tell me nun
Look where we came from
I heard somebody said they said something
What the fuck you mean these niggas can't tell me nun
Aye youngboy...

[Verse 2]
When it's cloudy I'm still shining, raining I'm still stunting
Time wait for nobody, all day gettin' that money
Scared to trust somebody baby look what you done, done me
That shit I don't acknowledge
Check out while I'm comin'
They called me broke now I'm poppin' shit, they treated me like I wasn't shit
Now my neck full of Cuban links these niggas see that I'm havin' shit
They criticizing motivated me
This for the ones betrayed me
This for the ones who hated me
Now you gotta pay just to see me bitch

[Hook]
Did me
I'll never forget bout what you what you told me
Shit hurt so deep can't lie you showed but I'ma run my bands up
Fuck everybody that had changed up
Shit I remember we ain't had nun, look what we done came from
I heard somebody said they said something
What the fuck you mean these niggas can't tell me nun
Look where we came from
I heard somebody said they said something
What the fuck you mean these niggas can't tell me nun
Aye youngboy...
