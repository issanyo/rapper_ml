Shawty if you need a thang you can call on me

[Verse 1:]
I had lost track of all my money
Help me count it for me
And i be in my feelings when you don’t be talking to me
I was recording Ben say that you was calling for me
When i got done i read your text
You say you waiting on me
When i get there imma eat you
Fuck you like no other
Imma kiss you
Imma rub you and tell you I love you
I be looking in your eyes when we talk to each other
Deep down inside i can see us turning out together

[Pre-Chorus]
Come here baby let me show i love you
Fuck them hoes and the fame
Girl you know i’m thuggin
Fuck what they sayin, i’m yo man and you know i’m fa you
(eh eh yea yea baby call on me)

[Chorus]
Shawty if you need a thang you can call on me
I never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range imma be there for you
Baby we don’t need a ring for to prove my loyalty

Shawty if you need a thang you can call on me
I never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range imma be there for you
Shawty we don’t need no ring for to prove my loyalty

[Verse 2:]
And she said
“Ion share nun that’s mine
I can’t waste my time
Look me in my eyes
And tell me no lies (yea)
You need me on the road
I’m on my way now
Bae it's 3 o’clock
I’ll be there at 5
Just tell me your spot
You turn on wit yo gang
That’s something i can’t stop
Just give me respect
You act like ian there
You know that ain’t fair
Fuck them hoes
They can’t touch but they can stare
Ain’t no secret boy
Tell them i’m your girl
And you know that’s real”
I’ll admit i want you to be mine
Told that girl i think about her all the time
She said “If you really love me you wouldn’t lie
You would never let me leave from off your side”
She say “I promise to stay down and i’m gone ride
When i call for you promise you gone make time
Hold me down and together we gone ride
Truthfully maybe one day me and you gone tie the knot”
(eh eh youngboy)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come here baby let me show i love you
Fuck them hoes and the fame
Girl you know i’m thuggin
Fuck what they sayin, i’m yo man and you know i’m fa you
(eh eh yea yea baby call on me)

[Chorus]
Shawty if you need a thang you can call on me
I never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range imma be there for you
Baby we don’t need a ring for to prove my loyalty

Shawty if you need a thang you can call on me
I never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range imma be there for you
Shawty we don’t need no ring for to prove my loyalty
