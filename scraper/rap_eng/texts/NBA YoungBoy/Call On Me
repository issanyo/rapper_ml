[Chorus]
Come here baby let me show I love you
Fuck them hoes and the fame, girl you know I'm thuggin'
Fuck what they saying, I'm your man and you know I'm for you
Ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy, call on me
Shawty if you need a thing you can call on me
I'll never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range I'ma be there for you
Baby we don't need a ring for to prove my loyalty
Shawty if you need a thing you can call on me
I'll never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range I'ma be there for you
Shawty I don't need no ring for to prove my loyalty

[Verse 1]
I had lost track of all my money, here babe count it for me
And I be in my feelings when you don't be talking to me
I was recording, Ben said that you was calling for me
When I got done I read your text, you say you waiting on me
When I get there I'ma eat you, fuck you like no other
I'ma kiss you, I'ma rub you and tell you I love you
I be looking in your eyes when we talk to each other
Deep down inside I can see us turning out together

[Chorus]
Come here baby let me show I love you
Fuck them hoes and the fame, girl you know I'm thuggin'
Fuck what they saying, I'm your man and you know I'm for you
Ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy, call on me
Shawty if you need a thing you can call on me
I'll never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range I'ma be there for you
Baby we don't need a ring for to prove my loyalty
Shawty if you need a thing you can call on me
I'll never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range I'ma be there for you
Shawty I don't need no ring for to prove my loyalty

[Interlude]
You don't fuck with me how you say you do
You know I fuck with you
How far you'll go for me?
Above and beyond

[Verse 2]
She say, I don't wanna share nothin' that's mine, I can't waste my time
Look me in my eyes and tell me no lies
You need me on the road, I'm on my way now
Babe it's 3 O' clock I'll be there at 5, just tell me a spot
You turn up with your gang, that's somethin' I can't stop
Just give me respect, don't act like I ain't there
You know that ain't fair
Fuck them hoes, they can't touch but they can stare
Ain't no secret boy, tell 'em I'm your girl and you know that's real
I'll admit I want you to be mine
Told that girl I think about her all the time
She say if you really love me you wouldn't lie
You would never let me leave from off your side
She said I promise to stay down and I'm gon' ride
When I call for you, promise you gon' make time
Hold me down and together we gon' ride
Truthfully maybe one day me and you gon' tie the knot
Ayy, ayy, YoungBoy

[Chorus]
Come here baby let me show I love you
Fuck them hoes and the fame, girl you know I'm thuggin'
Fuck what they saying, I'm your man and you know I'm for you
Ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy, call on me
Shawty if you need a thing you can call on me
I'll never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range I'ma be there for you
Baby we don't need a ring for to prove my loyalty
Shawty if you need a thing you can call on me
I'll never ask for anything but to be there for me
You ever call out of range I'ma be there for you
Shawty I don't need no ring for to prove my loyalty
