[Intro: OG 3Three]
Yeah, yeah
I just handled the phone
Sad how I have to make [?] wit' my brother
Nigga, huh, yeah, yuh (there's no cryin' , there's no cryin' 3)
Three!

[Chorus: OG 3Three]
Hung up the phone, said I'm finna make a million (make a million)
Nowhere to run
But my main bitch steady trippin' (nowhere to run but my bitch)
I grabbed the gun
Add the three scope just to go hit it (just to go hit it)
One phone call, bitch that's your ass
And we gon' send 'em, gang (and we gon' send)
Hung up the phone, said I'm finna make a million (make a million)
Nowhere to run
But my main bitch steady trippin' (nowhere to run but my bitch)
I grabbed the gun
Add the three scope just to go hit it (just to go hit it)
One phone call, bitch that's your ass
And we gon' send 'em, gang

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Yeah, one speculation and one altercation
I'm sendin' them hittas, aye (sendin' them dope)
These niggas be hatin' ain't no time for debatin'
You know we don't feel 'em, aye (no feelin')
Move in they faces, move in they places
And knock down the building, aye (brrrt)
I'ma 21 Savage, do work with the X, [?], yeah
On the block wit' that rock like I'ma ball on 'em (ball)
Got some niggas gon' shoot, ain't gon' call on 'em
Got some F-15 bullets gon' fall on 'em (yeah)
They gon' hop out and run like a dog on 'em
Aye, aye (bitch)
Think that I need to stop rappin'
Hang up the phone, walk from the mic
Get the racks out the safe then we right back to trappin' ([?] back to trappin')

[Chorus: OG 3Three & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Hung up the phone, said I'm finna make a million (make a million)
Nowhere to run
But my main bitch steady trippin' (steady trippin')
I grabbed the gun
Add the three scope just to go hit it (and it's a clip)
One phone call, bitch that's your ass
And we gon' send 'em, gang (and we gon' send)
Hung up the phone, said I'm finna make a million (make a million)
Nowhere to run
But my main bitch steady trippin' (nowhere to run but my bitch)
I grabbed the gun
Add the three scope just to go hit it (just to go hit it)
One phone call, bitch that's your ass
And we gon' send 'em, gang

[Verse 2: OG 3Three]
I teein' you and you teein' me
Teein' you forever, 10.3
Came from nothin', know you can see
Now they take pictures of 3Three
Sellin' drugs like my nigga BB
100 Pounds of that purp in a week ( 100 pounds of that purp in a week)
Get 'em for the low-low, we got 'em for cheap (for cheap)
And errybody good, know we all gon' eat
Let errybody turn up wit' the gang (gang)
No bitch we don't want change (we don't want change)
Lotta money make us go insane
Lil' bitch just stay in your lane (in your lane)
You just wanna gimme lil' bread for the fame
All for the lane she gon' hang
When I [?] her she say three names (3Three)
Sand a bag to the main
Shawty in desinger, she playin', woah
Hung up the phone, said I'm finna make a M (make a M)
These niggas worried, no I ain't worried 'bout them, shit
Feelin' like Scotty, bitch I'm shootin' above the rim, better
Better empty your pockets, if I come up off my hip I'm gang

[Chorus: OG 3Three]
Hung up the phone, said I'm finna make a million (make a million)
Nowhere to run
But my main bitch steady trippin' (nowhere to run but my bitch)
I grabbed the gun
Add the three scope just to go hit it (just to go hit it)
One phone call, bitch that's your ass
And we gon' send 'em, gang (and we gon' send)
Hung up the phone, said I'm finna make a million (make a million)
Nowhere to run
But my main bitch steady trippin' (nowhere to run but my bitch)
I grabbed the gun
Add the three scope just to go hit it (just to go hit it)
One phone call, bitch that's your ass
And we gon' send 'em, gang
