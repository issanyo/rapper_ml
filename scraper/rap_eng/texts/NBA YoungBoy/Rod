Fucking with my clique and you get robbed
Shit I’m chillin' with yo bitch and she a thot

I ain’t worried 'bout no niggas, got my rod
Fucking with my clique and you get robbed

[Verse 1: 4TM Fru]
I never did a jost, but I ain’t tryna go
But I done robbed some niggas of some weight and moved all kind of dope
But yet these niggas still talking gangster, fuck you lyin' for?like tryin range with bangers
Pistols slangin at the counter [?]
I’m most around them Scotland babies
Bitch you know I’m from that O
Catch a nigga slippin' and relapse, I did that for the four
I still ain’t on my shit, but on my shit mine
Who I’m grinding for
Bodies losing patience so it’s time to score
Fuck who flexing, hold my bitch down
And it’s fuck my exes up
Bro with it then it’s hectic
Bitch you better not disrespect me
Catch it or I’ll intercept it, light up a nigga section
Your girl in love with our music but get more dick than blessings
