(Intro)

Yeaaah

Tell a pussy nigga ain't worried 'bout nothing

Im strapped up, ain't worried 'bout nothing


(Chorus)

Tell a pussy nigga ain't got no worries       (x2)

Walk with it on me ain't got no worries

Be around shootas ain't got no worries

And i know they gone bang ain't got no worries

(Vers 1)

Young nigga i ain't worried 'bout nothing, walking with this .40

Watching everythang cus i know this shit is retarded

Let a nigga run up on me better have him fucking ignore me

Hit his ass up and then we take a trip to florida

Laughing at you niggas as im sipping out of the lean

Claim that we beefin' hop out when we see him

(???) from the (???) sitting in the beamer

On phone (???) and he saying he about to meet us

Tell a pussy nigga ain't got no worries

Walk on the block late at night holding on this syrup

Be around shootas .40 on deck i ain't gotta say a word cus i know he gone bust

Charger after charger i ain't trippin' fuck it if you wanna do it tell a nigga its nothing

Ay, i ain't worried about nothing, noooo i ain't worried about nothing


Im on stage and im jumping to the ceiling        (x2)

Put that on Dave, nigga play he got get it

Promise every nigga with me is with it

Dive in the crowd and i know they come with me

(Chorus)

Tell a pussy nigga ain't got no worries     (x2)

Walk with it on me ain't got no worries

Be around shootas ain't got no worries

And i know they gone bang ain't got no worries
