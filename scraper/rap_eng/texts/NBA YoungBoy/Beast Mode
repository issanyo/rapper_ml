[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Huh, man I swear I be so faded
I almost forgot that I was famous
Last night I almost popped a nigga
He got too close, he had a hoodie on, he wanted a picture
He ain't even think that I was about to smoke him like a fucking swisher
I can't afford it, I got a daughter, you won't catch me slippin'
Yeah, I should be gettin' realer, I be gettin' richer
But I just spent up on my neck could pay a bitch tuition
All my diamonds, they be dancin' like they New Edition
I mix the Louis and Supreme, that's limited edition
Fuck ya bitch and now ya bitch, she missin'
Yeah, mothafucka I'm in...

[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Fuck her with my jeans on, fuck her with my chains on
She like how I be kicking she might think that I'm from Hong Kong
Everybody turn yo' power off if yo' phone's on
Hoe you gon' get slapped up in yo' shit using the wrong tone
PnB got us all Milly Rocking with his song on
A Boogie just walked up in the party with his hoodie on
You know me, rollin' off a pill, strapped up with that chrome
Hoe, don't walk up smilin' in my face if I can't take you home
Baby girl I'm leaning right now on a 4
You know I'm going hard when it's time for beast mode
I'm turnt up, I'm out my body, I'm in crunch mode
40 Glock up in my pocket you don't wanna know

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & PnB Rock]
Beast mode (yeah), go beast mode
Ballin' so hard, yeah they think I got the cheat code
Huh, I got the cheat code
