[Pre-Chorus]
Your smile play a big part in why I want you
For your love, it ain't not tellin’ what I won't do
Yeah, you bad, I guess that's why they hatin’ on you
Why they mad? It's because they ain't got nothin' on you

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna waste your time
And I ain't tryna make you mine
But if it happen that's fine
I hope I learn to treat you right over the time

[Verse 1]
And I ain't lyin’, I been droppin’ bags on 'em packs to make that money stack
And I been tryna run it up so I can turn up on they ass
And you just came inside my life, don’t make me put you in the past
People say she make you wonder, I try hard to make you laugh
Let's see how these bitches like you in a new Birkin bag
I could flew you on a jet with private thoughts to make it back
It's way too early, but they talkin', so I hit you with that sack
Jump out the back, I’m like, "Lay back," the way I pop out with that Mac
Remember when you was mine
I'm thinkin' 'bout all the times I hit the blunt to get that shit from out my head, like, "yeah, yeah"
I used to tell you "you fine"
I'm sad I can't press rewind
How I been feelin', I been scared to say the shit that's unsaid

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna waste your time
And I ain't tryna make you mine
But if it happen that's fine
I hope I learn to treat you right over the time

[Verse 2]
Thought I was pressure, I ain't lyin', and that's a fact
She told me, "Baby, look, relax"
Dropped up her hair and showed me how to hit it from the front and back
I say "slow down," she told me tap, I'm steady pullin' on her hair
But we just friends, I got some pieces of my heart I'm tryna map
You like, "Keep it real," I won't tell no lie, I'll tell you how I feel
My people with me keep the steel, want you to help me change, for real
Ain't speakin' on my past because I'm tryna lose that pain, for real
I'm like bae this ain't a game, for real
We done bust a nigga brain, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
Your smile play a big part in why I want you
For your love, it ain't not tellin' what I won't do
Yeah, you bad, I guess that's why they hatin' on you
Why they mad? It's because they ain't got nothin' on you

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna waste your time
And I ain't tryna make you mine
But if it happen that's fine
I hope I learn to treat you right over the time

[Outro]
Baby I'm a real Slime
We might fight from time to time
Make me feel some shit I never felt and I won't let you down
Baby I'm a real Slime
I'm talkin' time to time
Make me feel some shit I never-yeah, haha
