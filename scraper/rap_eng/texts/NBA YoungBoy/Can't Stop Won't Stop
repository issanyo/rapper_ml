[Verse 1]
I had to show Im the best in what I do
I’ma show you niggas how to make something
Let a nigga try me, I’ma spray something
Piping down on you bitch boys, won’t take nothing
Real killer, murk a nigga and won’t say nothing
All my niggas sliding, I ain’t gotta play nothing
Winning these bitches, it was given, I ain’t make nothing
Shit ain’t giving me something, I’ll take something
This for the nigga on the block steady getting money
This for the youngin sixteen with the stick on him
All chrome 38 with a body on it
Step on it, run up on me, I’ma up on ‘em
Everything that I claim, bitch I stand on it
For my NBA chains, put them bands on it
Do another show, a whole ‘nother check on me
Let ‘em hate, I’ma steady just flex on ‘em
In the studio with Eli, bitch we getting to it
Forever going in until I get up out the hood
Forever going in until I know we all good
Stand down, you ain’t a boss, you ain’t got no pull
NBA YoungBoy, bitch I be the plug
Whole lot of verses, I ain’t even sell drugs
But every nigga ‘round me, yeah you know they sell drugs
Every nigga ‘round me, yeah you know they sell drugs

[Chorus]
I ain’t got nothing for the do
But stunt ’ on everybody, whoever slept on me
I can’t stop, won’t stop, now
‘Cause I got so many people that’s counting on me
I’ma show you niggas how to make something
Let a nigga try me, I’ma spray something
I bet now one of you bitch boys won’t take nothing
I bet now one of you bitch boys won’t take nothing

[Chorus]
I ain’t got nothing for the do
But stunt ’ on everybody, who ever  slept on me
I can’t stop, won’t stop, nah
‘Cause I got so many people that’s counting on me
I’ma show you niggas how to make something
Let a nigga try me, I’ma spray something
I bet now one of you bitch boys won’t take nothing
I bet now one of you bitch boys won’t take nothing

[Verse 2]
All spring, all summer I been working
Tell me how the fuck can you say I don’t deserve something
First time in my life that I earned something
I bet now none of you bitch niggas take it from me
Every last one of us got a gun on us
Every last one of us got them shots on us
Let a nigga play and we gon’ slide on ‘em
For that money could get hit, we gon’ burn something
We got Pep on stand by, ready to kill something
[?] boom on that fifth, ready to drill something
Ben walk up broad day and face something
Ben walk up broad day and face something

[Chorus]
I ain’t got nothing for the do
But stunt ’ on everybody, whoever slept on me
I can’t stop, won’t stop, nah
‘Cause I got so many people that’s counting on me
I’ma show you niggas how to make something
Let a nigga try me, I’ma spray something
I bet now one of you bitch boys won’t take nothing
I bet now one of you bitch boys won’t take nothing

[Chorus]
I ain’t got nothing for the do
But stunt ’ on everybody, who ever  slept on me
I can’t stop, won’t stop, nah
‘Cause I got so many people that’s counting on me
I’ma show you niggas how to make something
Let a nigga try me, I’ma spray something
I bet now one of you bitch boys won’t take nothing
I bet now one of you bitch boys won’t take nothing
