[Intro]
Slime, money gon' talk on me, big knots and it don't fold, nah
Don't fold, nah-uh
Slime
XL legal made it

[Chorus]
Tell me what you doin', yeah
I pull up flexin' with some niggas too influenced, yeah
I got lil' shawty to my left lookin' right and she teasin' me
After the night I just won't know is you gon' leave with me?
Like what's the issue?
Money gon' talk on me, big knots and they don't fold, nah
Patek Philippe, draped out on me and I got four now
I first come that I don't need, I got my own now
Guns bustin' in the streets, it's a showdown

[Verse 1]
Money gon' talk to your friends
Kick back at the Drury  inn
Niggas be talkin', we bustin', we never discussin', we know how to end it
Cash out on my pendant, just add up five times ten, yeah
I'm zoned out on them Xans, yeah, Wockhardt don't drink no gin, yeah
Bombs all over my 'cause my car strapped wit' the pipe
Say, "Lil' boy that's that burner nigga, play and I'ma burn you nigga"
Hol' up, bitch hol' up, have 'em runnin' tonight
Money talk all on my sneakers, big B drippin' tonight

[Chorus]
Now tell me what you doin', yeah
I pull up flexin' with some niggas too influenced, yeah
I got lil' shawty to my left lookin' right and she teasin' me
After the night I just won't know is you gon' leave with me?
Like what's the issue?
Money gon' talk on me, big knots and they don't fold, nah
Patek Philippe, draped out on me and I got four now
Offers that I don't need, I got my own now
Guns bustin' in the streets, it's a showdown

[Verse 2]
Slime shit, I'm on, they can't tell me 'cause I know now
I'm built to win, you say I run wit' them men, gon' be a showdown
Walk in my house and get fitted, I get it, I spend it, I hop in the Bentley and spin it
Stay wit' a Glizzy, I take out the clip and I fit it, he say he want smoke and I'm wit' it
Fuckin' these little bitty bitches, soon as I'm done, out the door she gon' kick it
Know I be thuggin', told the ho' "Fuck you bitch", for a fact she know that I meant it, yeah
Step on the gas I'ma hit it, I'm on my way, I be flyin' through the city
Float on the floor like I'm wearin' some healies
Get out your body, I'ma give you the business

[Chorus]
Now tell me what you doin', yeah
I pull up flexin' with some niggas too influenced, yeah
I got lil' shawty to my left lookin' right and she teasin' me
After the night I just won't know is you gon' leave with me?
Like what's the issue?
Money gon' talk on me, big knots and they don't fold, nah
Patek Philippe, draped out on me and I got four now
Offers come that I don't need, I got my own now
Guns bustin' in the streets, it's a showdown
