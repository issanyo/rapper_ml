[Hook: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I can't even feel the pain inside
I can't keep living in a lie
Yeah, I might be breathing just like everybody else
But I still don't feel alive
Every night man, I hear a pistol poppin'
Make me feel like God ain't really watching
Watch out for the snakes, they steady plottin'
They wanna put you in a cage or in a coffin'
Now a days, these cops just wanna kill
No love in the streets, don't wanna feel
What I felt when I heard my lil' brother passed
I'll never get him back
But yo I still, know his soul is still roamin' on the streets
Now I just hope he's watching over me
Now I just keep on praying
I've been trynna' talk to God but these demons never leave

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Before the rap money, young nigga was ballin' way before it
I don't do no talkin', I drop a bag on 'em then nigga you know it
I bought me a pint of that Hi-Tech, I crack it and pour it
I crunch up the X, end up in my mouth, you know that I throw it
She all in my section, she steady keep pressin', but no, she don't know it
When I'm up in Texas, I ride with that Wesson, just me and my boys
I swear it's controlling me, seventeen, got four sons
Tryna go cop me 'bout four foreigns
Studio on the bus, I'm touring
I swear I don't put no effort in these songs
Bet these niggas pissed off, mad at me and Bagg, aw
Grandma gone, I hold it down
No I won't flock, I keep it strong
These bitches be aching, I steady be raking
So when I'm recording, don't call my phone

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
Yellow bitch, yellow diamonds, ooh, I'm pissed off
The way she love me and she fuck me, ooh she gettin' off
He talking hard, approach him, watch how fast he get soft
Rapid fire, nothin' stop him, choppers lettin' off
If I catch you I'm gettin' off
I'm tryna knock your whole shit off
You and your mans too, I'll drop the bag on the whole crew
Ben be suffocating, the hundreds they be all blue
I'm on a whole 'nother level, the bitches, they all-new
Speaking of bitches, a bitch tryna get off on Instagram 'cause I fell back
Why you ain't make a post how you fucked the clique, bitch go tell that, hah
These rappers tryna sneak diss, tryna get off to get on, hah
Catch their ass in public, they gon' get right and get gone
