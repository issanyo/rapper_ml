[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
Like, yeah
Ayy see
See I'm a young nigga with this paper, you know what I'm sayin'
I ain't gon' even lie, like
Sometimes it get to me, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I just popped a bean, I just threw my neck back
I'm in the latest machine, I hope I don't wreck it
Bitch threaten me like she gon' leave (bye bye)
Cool, ain't gon' sweat that
You ain't never got no time for me
I hate when she text that
I just got flagged by the law, I just had a minor setback
Hundred hundred with my dogs
Ten-oh-four, I'm like bet that, ayy
I met the paper, I met that
Neck and my wrist is on wet wet
At the crib, pour where the jet's at (where the Lear at?)
Name one thing I ain't best at

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
I just hit me a lick, I just stretched that
I'm on pills in the foreign, I might wreck that
I just copped an AP, I love how it shine
I ain't took the time to set that
All my young niggas still on that hot shit
I can't fuck with you, you on that opp shit
All that hatin' shit, that ain't gon' stop shit
I be fly like dude in the cockpit
She textin' me talkin' 'bout she want better
She wanna come 'round but I won't let her
This money got these niggas so jealous
But I keep them straps like Margiellas, hey
Still making sales, fuck 12
If I get caught I make bail (federal)
Pull up servin' with the tags out
Still got the bales out the schoolhouse
Three shows one night, that's a paycheck
I just hopped off a Lear G5 jet
Vibin', stylin', profilin'
Bad bitch with me, she red like Hi-Tech (red like drank)
Hold up, she might be bad but she don't listen
Always talkin' 'bout other bitches (god damn ho)
Send my lil niggas on a mission
I got that power like Fifty

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I just popped a bean, I just threw my neck back
I'm in the latest machine, I hope I don't wreck it
Bitch threaten me like she gon' leave (bye bye)
Cool, ain't gon' sweat that
You ain't never got no time for me
I hate when she text that
I just got flagged by the law, I just had a minor setback
Hundred hundred with my dogs
Ten-oh-four, I'm like bet that, ayy
I met the paper, I met that
Neck and my wrist is on wet wet
At the crib, pour where the jet's at (where the Lear at?)
Name one thing I ain't best at

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Flight up to Cali, you know that I bet that
Pull up, show my ass, I'm like where the check at?
Before I walk in I'm like where the perps at?
Turn up at the party, you know I success that
Bitch textin' me, tryna see where I be at
I told her I'm headed wherever the check is
She said when you comin' back to where I live?
You need to find you a new nigga to bitch at (bitch)
Don't fuck with me, then say that
Bitch, then say that
I chauffeur my car, in the back of the Maybach
(I chauffeur my car, in the back of the Maybach)
Don't fix your mouth to say what you gon' do
I told a ho bitch you know I don't play that
I walk around with a whole lot of money
Four of your boyfriends couldn't even make that, ho

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I just popped a bean, I just threw my neck back
I'm in the latest machine, I hope I don't wreck it
Bitch threaten me like she gon' leave (bye bye)
Cool, ain't gon' sweat that
You ain't never got no time for me
I hate when she text that
I just got flagged by the law, I just had a minor setback
Hundred hundred with my dogs
Ten-oh-four, I'm like bet that, ayy
I met the paper, I met that
Neck and my wrist is on wet wet
At the crib, pour where the jet's at (where the Lear at?)
Name one thing I ain't best at
