[Intro: Shy Glizzy]
GG, NBA, aww
Real gangster shit, yeah

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Where we come from niggas don't play
Southside nigga on the North movin' weight
Yeah, we might slide on a nigga broad day
Them youngins, they be thuggin', don't come in these hallways
And we be on the block makin' money all day, yeah
Playin' with them rocks, put the money in the safe, yeah
Screamin' wrong or right, shoot a nigga in the face, yeah
Nigga out of line, we gon' put 'em in they place, yeah

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Now look here
I come from beefin', slangin' iron at the other side
I never let it go, I just went harder when my nigga died
I been locked up too many times, I run it without even tryin'
I want your head, I drop a dime
You run up, you might lose your mind
Rich nigga, Audemars on me and my bitch
And I be runnin' with some niggas, every one with the shits
Don't take my jewelry off, come out the window slangin' that stick
I'm cold-hearted, fuck my mama, we gon' step on a bitch, believe that
No picks and chooses, it go down when I lose it
And I done came up on so much, I swear I don't wanna lose it
I point him out and that's a fact that Meezy steppin' on fooly
And I know Glizzy really trap, don't give a fuck 'bout the music, yeah

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Where we come from niggas don't play
Southside nigga on the North movin' weight
Yeah, we might slide on a nigga broad day
Them youngins, they be thuggin', don't come in these hallways
And we be on the block makin' money all day, yeah
Playin' with them rocks, put the money in the safe, yeah
Screamin' wrong or right, shoot a nigga in the face, yeah
Nigga out of line, we gon' put 'em in they place, yeah

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
Bitch you know what's up with us so don't act like you stupid (Yeah)
I just bought a Bentley truck and it came with a shooter (Skrrt)
Your bitch sucked me up while I was listening to Future (Ooh)
No I don't give a fuck, you see them niggas, better do 'em (Brrt)
Tell me what the fuck you on, I just bought another home (Yeah)
Got the plug on line one and YoungBoy on my other phone
When I ran up on them niggas, my hoodie was VLONE (VLONE)
Baby 3 my heart, and in my eyes, no he can't do wrong
.45 tucked inside my Helmut Lang sweats
If I call you my Slime then that mean you gon' slatt (Slatt)
Your niggas they ain't ride, bitch, how much you gon' bet?
Catch that bitch who killed my brother and I won't mind goin' back (30, 30)

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Where we come from niggas don't play
Southside nigga on the North movin' weight
Yeah, we might slide on a nigga broad day
Them youngins, they be thuggin', don't come in these hallways
And we be on the block makin' money all day, yeah
Playin' with them rocks, put the money in the safe, yeah
Screamin' wrong or right, shoot a nigga in the face, yeah
Nigga out of line, we gon' put 'em in they place, yeah

[Outro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Hold on
I'm out that North, my niggas out the South
When I get... ...that's how you know to put the spot, lil' bitch, yeah
Fuck you in your booty then I kick you out
That slime shit, that rhyme shit, I blow a nigga down
Straight out the cell, bitch I'm out my mind
I got a million for every nigga want a slice of mine
And all my niggas keep them pistols, we ain't wasting time
These niggas **** around my set and then these niggas dyin'
Now look here
Ready for Glizzy to go back to Jefe 2, wait
Probably on that Law 3, but shit, nigga what up
I'm thuggin' in this bitch and I'ma cut up
And when it's steppin' we gon' **** a nigga the **** up, believe that
Meezy, what it is bitch?
You heard me, I'm waitin' on Glizzy, Glizzy be gettin too high
Man I'm just coolin, I'm waitin on him, you heard me?
