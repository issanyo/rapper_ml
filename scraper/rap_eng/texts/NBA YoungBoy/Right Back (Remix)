[Intro: Trey]
Ooh (Yeah)
Ooh
Right back (Oh)
Tone it down

[Verse 1: Trey]
I done seen it all, I seen the signs
Lately you been acting outta line with me
Who knew you was plotting on the side? (On the side)
I knew you would, knew you would

[Pre-Chorus]
How you fuck up with a nigga like me?
But truly lucked up with a nigga like me?
Tone it down, I said you gotta tone it down
Held you up, shit, I used to hold it down, forreal
Now how you feel my, oh my new bitch look like a steal?
'Cause I used to give you all the trust, yo’ bullshit was so obvious (Hey)

[Chorus: Ar'mon & Trey]
Don't go walking ’round like you don't know
What goes around gotta come right back
What goes around gotta come right back (It's gon' wrap around) Don't go walking 'round like you don't know
What goes around gotta come right back
What goes around gotta come right back

[Verse 2: Ar'mon]
No more falling in love again
Shit ain’t making no sense
I’m tying all my loose ends
You just don't understand
You fucked up with your man
Now you ain’t part of the plan
Fell short, need a hand
I just don't understand

[Pre-Chorus: Ar'mon & Both]
How you fuck up with a nigga like me?
But truly lucked up with a nigga like me?
Tone it down, I said you gotta tone it down
Held you up, shit, I used to hold it down, forreal
Now how you feel, my, oh my new bitch look like a steal
You know I, I used give you all the trust, yo' bullshit was so obvious

[Chorus: Ar’mon & Trey]
Don't go walking 'round like you don't know
What goes around gotta come right back (Right back, yeah)
What goes around gotta come right back (It gotta come right back)
Don't go walking 'round like you don't know (Don't know)
What goes around gotta come right back (Right, right)
What goes around gotta come right back (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I thought you knew that I would leave any day
Instead of playing games with my heart
Baby, you for the state, why you hopping from out the car?
I couldn't accept that every time, baby, what the fuck you thought? (What you thought?)
I'm 19, you just one option (One option)
I could find different things, I could never, ever stop you (Never, ever stop you)
You spoke of confidential things then you showed me how you rockin'
No, that didn't make me leave your side, I was always by it
Oh yeah, I've been moving on
Chasing that money, I ain't let nothing control us
Did so much for that side, we never said they owed us (No)
I never treated you right, that's what the fuck you told us
But hold up, it's like

[Chorus: Ar'mon & Trey]
Don't go walking 'round like you don't know
What goes around gotta come right back
What goes around gotta come right back (Gotta come back, gotta come back, girl)
Don't go walking 'round like you don't know
What goes around gotta come right back
What goes around gotta come right back (Ooh)

[Outro: Ar'mon & Trey]
(It's gon' wrap around)
(It' gon' wrap around)
Yeah, yeah
(Gon' wrap around)
It gotta come right back
It gotta come right back
It gotta come right back
It's gotta come right back
It gotta come right back
It gotta come right back (Right back)
It gotta come right back
It gotta come right back
It gotta come right back
It gotta come right back
It gotta come right back (Ooh)
It gotta come right back
Right back
Right back
