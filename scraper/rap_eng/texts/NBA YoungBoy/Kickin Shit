[Intro]
Aye YoungBoy they wanna come see how we livin' shit (GG)

[Chorus]
You don't know what it take to get here
You don't know 'bout them long nights and all the shit i did
All you see is how a nigga live

Now when we pull up we pull up straight on that gang shit
Now everybody wanna come see how we kickin' shit

Now everybody wanna come see how we kickin' shit

[Verse 1]
I go by YoungBoy what the business is, I pull up flexin' just because I never had shit
I swear done walked alotta miles to get right here
So I won't let you come and take a thing from me
We stayed down and came up kept it one hundred ain't change up them niggas they hating ain't phase us
They tryna act like they gang now
They don't know what I did for this
How many times I done layed down
I done waited some years for this
Now its my time I won't stop now

Every day we live it up cause not a thing was ever fronted
All night we had to hustle tryna turn nothing to something go to jail ain't sayin' nothing, hold up who had said something

[Chorus]
You don't know what it take to get here
You don't know 'bout them long nights and all the shit i did

Now when we pull up we pull up straight on that gang shit
Now everybody wanna come see how we kickin shit
