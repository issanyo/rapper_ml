[Intro: Moneybagg Yo & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Ah, ah, okay, okay, right there, right there, right there
Can't hear you
Punch me in
Do it all over

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Back then she ain't fuck with a nigga, but now she wanna cuff me
My sack bigger
Fuck on her, I leave
I'm that nigga
Dope on top of them trees like cat litter
I ain't choosing no side, I stay in the middle
How the fuck he gon' ride? He ain't kill a nigga
I got over two bodies like John Diller
[?], we done hung niggas
Wockhardt on the bottle, that's actually
Crack the seal
What I'm pouring up? Actavis
New Ferrari, buy it
I put a MAC in it
Yellow bitch, big booty
I'm smashing shit
From the gutter, fuck the rapping
I'm jacking shit
Money talking
Nigga playing, we smashing shit
[?], nigga know that we cancel shit
Fully loaded, fully ammo, immaculate

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
On short notice, I just ran up 100
Well not 100, 97 exactly
Living cinematic, this a world premiere
I ain't acting, but I'm fucking a actress
Blue hunnids gang bang, they stacking
Two bitches, one me exactly
Opps on the other street that's action
Slide down, 100 round exactly
Exactly (exactly)
Look at they reaction, let's see who the maddest (big mad)
I'm smashing (what)
'Rari or Lamb'? let's see what's the fastest (skrrt)
Exactly (big drums on 'em)
Bands in the field, heritage, classic (woo)
Exactly (we the new dope)
Fed baby's like two bricks in a plastic
Hey!

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
(Bagg)
For that pack I want exactly what I told you
And that's closure
Dispensary out in Colorado, keep a backwood full of doja
Machine gun 'cross the shoulder, wake the whole house up
Folgers
Shawty tripping on poster, like I'm 'posed to
She want exposure
Six cars, I'm more than mobile
Rockstar, I'm never sober
Shit at all, what I owe them exactly?
Two for one, only one was a baddie
Plug hit, say he having contractions
That mean yay on the way (any day)
Straight off the block to a billboard spot
That mean I'm hotter than May

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
On short notice, I just ran up 100
Well not 100, 97 exactly
Living cinematic, this a world premiere
I ain't acting, but I'm fucking a actress
Blue hunnids gang bang, they stacking
Two bitches, one me exactly
Opps on the other street that's action
Slide down, 100 round exactly
Exactly (exactly)
Look at they reaction, let's see who the maddest (big mad)
I'm smashing (what)
'Rari or Lamb'? let's see what's the fastest (skrrt)
Exactly (big drums on 'em)
Bands in the field, heritage, classic (woo)
Exactly (we the new dope)
Fed baby's like two bricks in a plastic

[Outro]
Tay Keith too bangin'
