My nigga
Up in my city is murder, niggas ain't even 18 and they killin'
All my niggas be strapped with dem glizzys
Run up on me, swear to god you gon' get it
I ain't go to school, had to get it out the streets
All my niggas stood right behind me
All my niggas gon' spit 'bout me
[?] They'll spend no fee
Gettin' money, I be plottin' with [?]
Niggas steady keep on callin', tryna get with me
I be hustlin' ain't never doin' nothin' for free
What it is, what's the price, tell me what it's gon' be
Switchin' style up everytime I spit
When I do a show everytime it be lit
Gotta get it out the mud, gotta get it how I live
Bitch niggas they be hatin', they ain't never faze shit

All I know is murder, one of a kind, everything I do unheard of
All I know is hustle, everytime I wake up I be on that, I don't stop for nothin', mhm yeah
Droppin' the price on the packs and I call 'em, yeah
Jump in the [?], runnin' from the law, ooo yeah
You know I go down on my city, you know I go down, yeah
