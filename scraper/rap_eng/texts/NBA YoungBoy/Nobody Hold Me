[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Healin' my pain, on a level, pissing out codeine
Niggas gon' talk, it's whatever 'cause they don't know me
Never stand down, Nation Business, you gotta show me
Earn and provide for myself 'cause nobody have ever hold me

[Interlude: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Aye, say look, aye, I'm tellin' you I can't love you
Ya heard me why the-what the fuck you want me to do when I've been wrong my whole life
Ya heard me, shit
If-if I, I don't know, if I ain't stand on Nation Business I wouldn't be here
Ya heard me but it is this right over love (and I don't want to hurt you)
And that man I am pardoned, believe dat, yeah

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I got some shit up in my blood, it never leave for life
And you so perfect, you deserve it, I can't treat you right
And if I ever get a chance I might hurt you (I knew it hurt)
So go and travel, find somethin' new like a bird do (brrr)
I'm from the north, my brothers come out that four
I'm in the valley, me and Quincy steady servin' that dope
And I grew up around some killers, shake the block with that pole
If I was ever for the flock you three gon' carry my load
I could rock some, grams out the bag, I'm finna drop some
Hit it wit' that sawed off, mediocre, milly rock some
Passin' through the block, get caught out, that choppa cut some
Fuckin' wit' my brother, ask him can I hold a block or something
Now tell me do you comprehend? We stand on Nation Business (Nation Business)
Now tell me do you understand? That I got cases pendin' (cases pendin')
Had a talk wit' all of my niggas and they steady spendin'
Unfamiliar places, up in life  could have your brain missin'

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Healin' my pain, on a level, pissin' out codeine
Niggas gon' talk, it's whatever 'cause they don't know me
Never stand down, Nation Business, you gotta show me
Earn and provide for myself 'cause nobody have ever hold me

[Bridge: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Yeah, no one ever hold me yeah, no one ever hold me yeah, slime

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Healin' my pain, on a level, pissin' out codeine
Niggas gon' talk, it's whatever 'cause they don't know me
Never stand down, Nation Business, you gotta show me
Earn and  provide for myself 'cause nobody have ever ho-o-o-ld me

[Interlude: Quando Rondo]
Huh, aye, pass me the cup, aye?
Eh, eh, eh, Quando Rondo nigga, eh

[Verse 2: Quando Rondo]
I got some shit inside my cup, dirty sprite stick to the ice
You said you love me, gave you my heart then you scarred me for life
Your loyalty I never doubted, never thought 'bout it twice
If lovin' you was wrong then baby I don't wanna be right
I'm from the trenches, I stay strapped with that pole
Just bought Leeky a new extension, back that up with some smoke
Nothin' but killers in my mirror, for a check they gon' go
And that's a bet they gon' blow (Throw one in the head and give it to me)
Clutchin' my metal while I fill my kidney wit' codeine
Trapped in the wagon, steady servin' percys to dope fiends
I'm 'bout to fill my mouth wit' VVS, I'm gettin' tired of the gold teeth
Hittin' the bank not a suggestion, I'm steady fiendin' for more lean

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Healin' my pain, on a level, pissin' out codeine
Niggas gon' talk, it's whatever 'cause they don't know me
Never stand down, Nation Business, you gotta show me
Earn and provide for myself 'cause nobody have ever ho-ld me

[Bridge: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Yeah, no one ever hold me yeah, no one ever hold me yeah, slime

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Healin' my pain, on a level, pissin' out codeine
Niggas gon' talk, it's whatever 'cause they don't know me
Never stand down, Nation Business, you gotta show me
Earn and provide for myself 'cause nobody have ever hold me
