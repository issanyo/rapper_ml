Gotta watch who around you
You better not get your self caught in them schemes
We ain't the same i dont believe what you leave
In what you believe
I can't live forever i know someday that i gotta leave
Can't get caught  in the fame if i go broke i know they gone leave

{Verse:}
Thought we was forever , no i wasn't ready for you to just leave
This shit ain't forever , i know someday its all gone leave im in love with that drank back to back sippin that lean
Them niggas hate me but im up in the streets and i stay wit that heat
Dont mess with nobody but you running over me i swear to god
I ain't having it
Steady spending that money we run it back up  we get it and flip it and stack the shit
My grandmother white i live the same my lil cousin a they african
So dont come at me with racist shit commenting under my insta pic
Ralph lauren everything im so fresh and clean asics on my feet around my waist a V
Fuck with DGK but rather rock supreme true religion beanie true religion jeans

Im blowing up so you need to stay the fuck out my business
When i go through it , it ain't yo problem so to you i would not mention
Stacking paper and i pray that ion never stop getting it
You was in it but you flopped i won't flop now that im in it riding round in that rolls royce im always timing baby celebrating ace of spade got me feeling brazy
Rollie watch  up on my arm look im proud i made it  i just gave my mom a racks im still thanking jesus
I just signed to atlantic and i can't believe it won't chase you you can't see yo worth then baby i dont need you
Niggas just can't play they role , repping off they people
Nigga you can play that role , and get hit with this heater
Since i was young its been my dream
But this shit ain't what it seem
It get grimy for that money everbody trynna scheme
We hit bottom know we running we gon stick him out his green
They conniving and profiling still they can  see by any means
