[Intro]
Kalayo
June Onna beat

[Verse]
Smokin' cigars fatter than a Swisher sweet
Caught him on a corner, nigga thought he had me beat
I’m on location, I'ma die right in the streets
Shooters trailin' on my rear wit’ a Glock on a seat
He want it wit me, shit what's up, nigga smoke somethin'
Talkin' like he 'bout it, you ain't never Baby Joe'd somethin'
I talk that talk, I walk that walk, You know I tote somethin’
Bitch, I’m out that 8, I said it straight I'm tryna blow somethin’
Put my flex down, I'ma spray that tec round, Ben put the bet down
I'ma spin then spin again and wet their block until the sundown
In FruitTown not far from sundown, we ain't make not one sound
Keep passin’ by their trap and they ain't out that bitch get burnt down'
Menace to society and I won't stop for nobody
So what you mean you know we 'bout it, I get work with the shotty
He ran his bike in KK car, I up that bitch and I shot him
Never be silent, we be wylin', where I'm from they get violent
I got that money, turnt to poppin', collected over two bodies
And I invested in this smoke so if you want it we got it
Plus I've been bootin' up off of that molly, bitch I'm turnt out my body
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you say, bitch you ain't stepped on nobody
R.I.P. boo bitch, he'd been spinnin' on shit before they caught him
We never beef, put shit to sleep, I take that name as a daughter
I started steppin' on my own, I turned myself to a rider
Tryin' to knock you niggas out, bitch I done lost every dollar
I run it up and get it back, I'm tryna slatt shit, I'll wipe his nose
Bitch I buy that food from Birdman, B ain't never closed
Bitch I'm out that north and every nigga wit' me throw them four's
Bitch I got a problem, ask my momma, I be whoopin' hoes
Now eat that dick up, better make it spit up before I beat it up
Don't wanna let Montana fuck, take our clothes and make her get the fuck
She say that I'm a dirty bitch and I'm wrong but I don't give a fuck
When you tryna be a part this business you can hit me up retarded
They ain't gotta say my name, I'm a starter
He movin' wrong, they say he tellin' so I cannot fuck wit' no body
Crash the party, walk up in that bitch to get me started
My comprehension is distorted, ask me can I spell like hardly
He talk 'bout takin' mine, you must not heard I slang that iron
Don't do no blinkin' or no duckin' when it's bitch I go to firin'
All behind my cousin and the bottom shot eleven times
The clip wasn't full, when I counted it, only came out to nine
Oh you fuck wit' nine, when niggas say when you ready
Spin on your block with them cutters and we gon' see who be steppin'
He say he down to ride, we'll send that bitch up to heaven
Stay with them shots, I keep that Glock, I fell in love when I met it
He want in wit' me, nigga smoke somethin'
You feel a nigga playin', when you drop your nuts pussy bitch you gotta show somethin'
This nigga must think I'm a hoe or somethin', I gotta do this nigga dirty
Spin the beam and smash 'em all up on the porch or somethin'
(Ok, I'm a 38 baby for real)
Straight out that north livin' lavish
My youngin' never had a daddy, he'll let a bitch have it
I hide my pack inside the house, put my stick under the mattress
And bust a nigga dome in seconds, now that's what I call magic
(That slime shit)
