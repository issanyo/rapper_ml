[Intro: Yung Bleu]
First
I was the first young nigga pull up in these cars nigga
First young nigga
First young nigga to show these niggas how to do this shit nigga

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I'm the young nigga got the juice up in my city
I was the first nigga in that coupe up in my city
I was the first one show these young niggas how to swipe it
That's what I get for tryna ball, niggas don't like me

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
I was the first one that these bitches went
First nigga in that 'Vette
I was the first one showed these niggas a check
First nigga out my set
First young nigga on B-L-A
Radio station, I'm a young vet
These young niggas ain't gettin' no check

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I was the first one showed these niggas the game
I was the first one showed these niggas this pain
You get that fame watch how the streets gon' change
You get that fame watch how the streets gon' change
You get that fame watch how your people gon' change
I'm the young nigga got the juice up in my city
I was the first nigga in that coupe up in my city
I was the first one show these young niggas how to swipe it
That's what I get for tryna ball, niggas don't like me

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I had to show these niggas how to stack it
Never gangster, show 'em how to map it
These niggas broke and they all acting
They was stuntin', you know we'll clap 'em
On the road, money comin' slow
Once I get it I'ma spend it faster
When I buy it I'ma buy it whole
I remember we'll have the mansion
We gettin' it in, give a fuck 'bout what you heard
This for my dogs, every album like a bird
Ain't go inside from the first until the fifth
I had to show my niggas never be the sketch
Watch my haters make the news
OG's schooled me with the clues
Badass AI
Billy nigga with the moves
Watch my haters make the news
OG's schooled me with the clues
Badass AI
Billy nigga with the moves

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I was the first one showed these niggas the game
I was the first one showed these niggas this pain
You get that fame watch how the streets gon' change
You get that fame watch how the streets gon' change
You get that fame watch how your people gon' change
I'm the young nigga got the juice up in my city
I was the first nigga in that coupe up in my city
I was the first one show these young niggas how to swipe it
That's what I get for tryna ball, niggas don't like me

[Verse 3: Yung Bleu]
Let me tell you what I'm dealing with
Nigga really on some friendly shit
You niggas [?] act like lil bitches
I'm finna put a nigga six inches
Tell them niggas that you upped it on me
You ain't tell 'em that I busted on you
You ain't tell 'em that you ain't get shit
These diamonds still on my wrist
These diamonds still on my neck
They wanna kill me for bragging rights
They wanna send me to paradise
I'm outer space with the sattalites
I ain't playing with these lil fuck niggas, I ain't taking no losses
I ain't playing with this money, young nigga you fuckin' with bosses

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I was the first one showed these niggas the game
I was the first one showed these niggas this pain
You get that fame watch how the streets gon' change
You get that fame watch how the streets gon' change
You get that fame watch how your people gon' change
I'm the young nigga got the juice up in my city
I was the first nigga in that coupe up in my city
I was the first one show these young niggas how to swipe it
That's what I get for tryna ball, niggas don't like me
