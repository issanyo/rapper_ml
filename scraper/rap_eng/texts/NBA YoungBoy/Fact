[Intro]
Bl-Black Diamonds
Slime On The Track

[Chorus 1]
I remember I ain't had nothin'
I had to go get some racks (Some racks)
I was hustlin' at the store, tryna get me some cash (Some cash)
A month ago I was broke, I ain't never goin' back (Goin' back)
In these streets it ain't no joke, so you know I keep a strap


[Chorus 2]
They wanna kill me cause I'm next to blow
You know I ain't goin' like that, I ain't there
But I grind hard for to get where I'm at, I'ma blow 'bout that
Gave him my trust and I burnt from it
I should've known better than that (I should've known better)
I done bossed up, I ain't trippin' no, just remember that
I done kept it real witchu, you know I ain't lyin', that's a fact
I done rode for niggas after they changed on me and he know that's a fact
Kept it real with all my niggas and that's a fact
Say that they fuck with you but really they don't
I got no love and it's time to get back


[Verse 1]
This for the ones who betrayed me (Who betrayed me)
Say you with me but you hate me (You hate me)
I feel like you tryna snake me (Huh?)
Boy what the fuck is you thinkin'?
On the block clutchin' a banger
Gettin' loaded, just me and Lil' Ben (Lil' Ben)
We had to run from the laws, we got away again
Grindin' and stackin' them M's (Them M's)
Want money, I don't want no friends
On the Megabus by myself, with the pints in my bag


[Break]
*Phone Ringing*
That's Lil' Ben
Hello?
Nigga play around with that sack
What?

[Verse 2]
So we loaded with them straps (We strapped)
Pap and OG in the back (In the back)
Floatin' 'round Park Forest, we tryna see where they at (Where they at)
Catch 'em, hit 'em, boom
Put his shit straight on the flat (Pow)
I had a show up in XO, you know I turnt up bad (Bad)
I was stuntin' wit' the cash, these niggas know we ain't friends (Nah)


[Chorus 2]
They wanna kill me cause I'm next to blow
You know I ain't goin' like that, I ain't there
But I grind hard for to get where I'm at, I'ma blow 'bout that
Gave him my trust and I burnt from it
I should've known better than that (I should've known better)
I done bossed up, I ain't trippin' no, just remember that
I done kept it real witchu, you know I ain't lyin', that's a fact
I done rode for niggas after they changed on me and he know that's a fact
Kept it real with all my niggas and that's a fact
Say that they fuck with you but really they don't
I got no love and it's time to get back


[Chorus 1]
I remember I ain't had nothin'
I had to go get some racks (Some racks)
I was hustlin' at the store, tryna get me some cash (Some cash)
A month ago I was broke, I ain't never goin' back (Goin' back)
In these streets it ain't no joke, so you know I keep a strap
