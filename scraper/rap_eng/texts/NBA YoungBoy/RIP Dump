[Intro]
Oh yeah, I wish I could hear the guitar play
Go Grizz
Slatt, bitch ass nigga I'ma feed 'em the rock

[Chorus]
Rest in peace to my nigga, Big Dump I miss you I just wish I was there
Feed off the pain and fuck the game, shit ain't the same since you left
Me and Dumaine got that 'caine and I've been searchin' for death
Got that work in the street and that pot is gon' melt
Got some niggas that kill that stand on my left

[Verse 1]
Law enforcements, we on top of the paper
When you sayin', I just know you can't hurt me
You tried to shit on me bitch, fuckin' wit' her so you hurtin'
The way that you handled me dirty, I'm facin' ten to thirty
I'm steady workin' and I'm not even much worried
Keepin' it real, gimme courage
You just like them bitches you wit' it ain't certain
You come from a good place, where I come from it's ugly
Hood niggas they love me, the reason you fuck wit' me I don't know why
I know it's a lie, I don't know why I'm tryin'
Tyrone on the cot, me and Trey in the ride
Start sayin' my prayers when Elijah had died
I done did it again, time after time
I ain't show it but inside I swear I was cryin'
Go to sleep and I picture me dyin'
Watchin' my nigga, he snortin' a line
Come from the slum, I ain't pressin' rewind
Slangin' that iron everytime that we ride
38 baby put trust in that fire
Came from the bottom, I'm up in my prime
Speak of that day and you payin' a fine
No love for a nigga, he playin', he dyin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I admit I'm a gangster but you ain't worth it
And I ain't know what you thinkin', I must ain't worth it
I never went against you after you hurt me
That pain gon' come from the truth, I had to learn it

[Chorus]
Rest in peace to my nigga, Big Dump I miss you I just wish I was there
Feed off the pain and fuck the game, shit ain't the same since you left
Me and Dumaine got that 'caine and I've been searchin' for death
Got that work in the street and that pot is gon' melt
Got some niggas that kill that stand on my left

[Verse 2]
I put that shit in your blood
So if I cut you I feel that ain't gangsta
Loyalty, loyalty, that's what I'm claimin'
Royalty, royalty, you won't be famous
So many times you done left me hangin'
Wonder how I'ma heal up from that
Swear to God I ain't playin', get back
I am gone shit on you , I promise you that

[Bridge]
Shawty I love you
I swear what you gone loss, is comin' back never stand down
You see what that love do
I ain't got nothin' more to prove, I swear to God that I won't back down

[Verse 3]
Grabbin' the safe, put the guns down
Banned from my city I move 'round
Nigga play, I'ma spray and that's man down
I be makin' that beat with a drum sound
Tell 'em come step in the compound
Tell 'em stand up, he a man now
Nigga don't tell me you're scared now
He cannot diss 'cause he dead now
Fuck

[Outro]
I admit I'm a gangster but you ain't worth it
And I ain't know what you thinkin', I must ain't worth it
I never went against you after you hurt me
That pain gon' come from the truth, I had to learn it
Slatt
