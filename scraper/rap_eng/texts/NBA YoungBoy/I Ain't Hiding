[Intro]
Probably in yo city

[Verse 1]
Private number call my phone say that I'ma kill ya
I told that nigga I ain't hiding, I'm probably in yo city
I keep it with me, pull up on me and shit gone get wicked
All this shit these niggas doing I swear that I don't feel them
11 thousand 'round my neck and that's just up in chains
10 bands up in my pocket fresh up out the bank
You ain't my roun pussy nigga, you don't feel my pain
This shit I spit on tracks straight facts
It ain't a fucking game
It ain't a song that I write I don't think about Dave
I walk on stage, thousand people screamin' my name
He probably think I owed him something
I don't owe him a thing (nah)
Bitch, you gone make me show you something
You go against the grain
Send my niggas to bust you up since you think that I'm playing
One night we hit two back to back
Like nigga what you sayin'? (Nigga what you sayin'?)
I cut the barrel, make it short, got that from 'cross the track
Catch you slippin' down bad and we gone bust your ass (bust your ass)
My OG say 'cause you'll shoot that don't make you a man
It's how you play your hand or react when you in that jam (jam)
This for my niggas dead and gone and the ones in the can
I'ma forever hold it down, forever take a stand

[Chorus]
You say you looking for me, nigga?
I ain't hiding 'bout it
Drop yo nuts and play with me, get touched
I could bet 5 on it
That's on my mama, all us 'bout that drama (bitch, we slanging iron 'bout it)
Reppin' like you step, we really spare (these niggas lying 'bout it)
50 round choppa for whoever want it
You know how we comin'
Run up on ya, put this bitch up on ya, put this bitch up on ya
Shit get gutta, gotta stay up on it
Never know who out to get ya
Better watch yo homies

[Verse 2]
Wake up every morning tryna get a dollar (dollar)
When you down and ain't got nothing
They ain't got no holla
Gotta get this shit for my lil' boys
Gotta get it for my mama
You better not short me out my money
I want every dollar (or else)
I'ma bust yo fucking head 'cause I don't play that
We gone load up with them cuttas
We gone swerve where you stay at
Can't keep hitting the block like this, YoungBoy
Too many people on that
I don't give a motherfuck
Ain't stopping 'til I get my shit back (believe that)
Nigga said spin again when the sun down
All night we gone wait 'til he come out
See his ass, hop out on him with the Glock out
What it is?
It's a man down
Where I'm from I was taught never stand down
Once my youngin spin, believe I'm coming back around
Suppressor on the front take away the sound (suppressor on the front take away the sound)

[Chorus]
You say you looking for me, nigga?
I ain't hiding 'bout it (I ain't hide)
Drop yo nuts and play with me, get touched
I could bet 5 on it
That's on my mama, all us 'bout that drama (bitch, we slanging iron 'bout it)
Reppin' like you step, we really spare (these niggas lying 'bout it)
50 round choppa for whoever want it
You know how we comin'
Run up on ya, put this bitch up on ya, put this bitch up on ya
Shit get gutta, gotta stay up on it
Never know who out to get ya
Better watch yo homie
