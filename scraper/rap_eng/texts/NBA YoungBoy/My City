[Intro: Youngboy N.B.A.]
Mmm, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Youngboy N.B.A.]
Droppin' the price on the packs when I call 'em, yeah
Jumpin' the fences, runnin' from the laws, yeah
You know it go down in my city, you know it go down
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Hook: Young Profits]
Them young niggas trap in my city
You might get kidnapped in my city
You might just get shot in my city 'cause
Them young niggas ridin' with .50s and
You know it go down in my city (x2)
You starve or you rob in my city
You ball or go broke in my city
Go to school or you trap in my city
Bitches linin' niggas up in my city and
You know it go down in my city (x2)

[Verse 1: Youngboy N.B.A.]
Up in my city, it's murder
Niggas ain't over 18 and they killin'
All my niggas be strapped with them glizzies
Run up on me, swear to God you gon' get it
I ain't go to school, had to get it out the streets
All my niggas stood right behind me
All my niggas gon' spend 'bout me
If you get today they'll spend, no fee
Gettin' money, I'm plottin' with Fee
Niggas steady keep on callin' tryna get with me
I be hustlin' I ain't never doing nothin' for free
What it is? What's the price? Tell me what it's gon' be
(Switch the style up every time that I spit)
When I do a show, every time it be lit
Gotta get it out the mud, gotta get it how I live
Bitch niggas, they be hatin' they ain't never phase shit
All I know is murder
One of a kind, everything I do:  unheard of
All I know is hustle
Every time I wake up, I be on it, I don't stop for nothin'

[Pre-Hook: Youngboy N.B.A.]

[Verse 2: Young Profits]
I done seen a lot, I done been through a lot
Had to roll up on a opp, probably send some shots
Knowin' my city hot, we ain't give a fuck 'bout goin' to jail or not
We was tryna put on for Mom and Pops
I was tryna get my niggas up out the hood
If a nigga cross me, I wish he would
But let's get one thing understood
If you ain't in the streets, then read a book
'Cause in my city, man, it's so heartless
And your life, it might get took
And these bitches just be linin' niggas up
They can't wait for the time for you to fuck
So they can catch you in the room and wet you up
They just lookin' for the cash to quick a buck
And I wish I was there, man, with my dawg, man
When the feds had picked him up
Told plug, "fuck twelve, just keep it comin'
And I'ma keep it consistent, do the numbers"
Murder rate goin' up 'cause it's the summer
Niggas puttin' up stats, quadruple, doubles
When you out in the field, try not to fumble
Niggas get locked up and watch 'em crumble

[Hook: Young Profits]
Them young niggas trap in my city
You might get kidnapped in my city
You might just get shot in my city 'cause
Them young niggas ridin' with .50s and
You know it go down in my city (x2)
You starve or you rob in my city
You ball or go broke in my city
Go to school or you trap in my city
Bitches linin' niggas up in my city and
You know it go down in my city (x2)

Jumpin' the fences, runnin' from the laws, yeah
You know it go down in my city, you know it go down
Yeah, yeah, uh
