[Hook: Kodak Black]
Lately I been workin over night
I can't party on the weekend
Like why the hell you even in my life
Tell me what's the real reason
I pulled up, drive my seat in
I'm catching flights you catching feelings
My diamonds wet her pussy linkin'
Ran up a check then went to Nimens

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Now with my ex I had to get my feet in
They had told me change my ways but I ain't wanna listen
I look my son in his eyes I can feel my mansion
(?) I know they wanna give me ay
Wake up in the morning I ain't got nothin to eat
I hadda man up and get on my feet
I go to (?) to fuck with KD
Can't even swim but I'm deep in that sea
Got my first gun and I ain't spend a day
Since I was young I been slangin that heat
It's some (?) motherfuckers on my street
Think it's some monsters right on my street
Remember they ain't give me shit when I have nothin
They want me stop but fuck these niggas I'm focused on money
On everythang she say she love me I know she ain't love me
3three ain't round for him watch me I think feel somethin'
My mama told me stack my ends told me watch my homies
But I ain't listen Joe got shot and he told on me
My uncle told me that ain't right
I don't need (?)
Can't lose it all for somebody who ain't care about chu

[Hook: Kodak Black]
My momma always told me about that water
And I said okay mom I'mmma put my feet in
I'm sorry mom I got right in that water
I ain't ever noticed (?)
Lately I been workin over night
I can't party on the weekend
Like why the hell you even in my life
Tell me what's the real reason
I pulled up, drive my seats in
I'm catching flights you catching feelings
My diamond wet her pussy linkin'
Ran up a check and went to Nimens
