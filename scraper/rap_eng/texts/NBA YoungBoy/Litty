[Hook: NBA Youngboy]
We party, we smoking, we breaking the rules
We turnt up, won't turn down, like ain't nothing to do
We rock out, we boot up, we litty like ohhh-ya
Yeah, vibe out, we have fun, I'm up in my mood
On my level, I'm so high, I'm way on the moon
Outside to my ride, me and you can move, yeah

[Verse 1: NBA Youngboy]
I ain't never been to a party like this before
Bad hoes all on the stairs and the floor
Boomer steady telling me to choose, I don't even know
Cause I don't planning on leaving any time soon
I don't wanna drink baby girl, I just wanna smoke, yeah
To tell the truth, really I just wanna get you home
Oh, don't mind me, you could keep doing what you're doing
You could steady just drink on your Petron
Why I throw up that gang and I scream for the band
All of my niggas say we going in
Sipping on lean, ain't drinking no gin
I'm tryna leave with you and your friend, yeah
Let's get up out of here, come out your band, yeah

[Hook: NBA Youngboy]
We party, we smoking, we breaking the rules
We turnt up, won't turn down, like ain't nothing to do
We rock out, we boot up, we litty like ohhh-ya
Yeah, vibe out, we have fun, I'm up in my mood
On my level, I'm so high, I'm way on the moon
Outside to my ride, me and you can move, yeah

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I put that bitch on a pill
She on a molly for real
Bust down Rollie, no deal
Said the ass real, let me feel
Pop pint, where the Sprite? Where the lean at?
Bad bitch, break her back like a kit-kat
Fuck her hard, that's your bitch, squirt
Pinky ring, that's a vert
Freak ho, she'll swallow a bottle
Instagram don't make you a model
Only drinking on Bacardi
Red bitch and she suck me sloppy
Snuck in the club with a pocket rocket
Rich nigga and a new Bugatti
Flexing on her, bitches calling me papi
Diamonds on me, too much ice like hockey
Take a ho to a crib, make her party
Skateboard bitches make me gnarly
She wanna pop a lil pill
She wanna party for real
Rich nigga with a mil
I can show you how it feel
I'ma fuck her cause she wet, splash
Two phones, plug calling me back

[Hook: NBA Youngboy]
We party, we smoking, we breaking the rules
We turnt up, won't turn down, like ain't nothing to do
We rock out, we boot up, we litty like ohhh-ya
Yeah, vibe out, we have fun, I'm up in my mood
On my level, I'm so high, I'm way on the moon
Outside to my ride, me and you can move, yeah
