[Hook x2]
Walk alone, I miss Lil' Dave
I think 'bout dying everyday
In the streets, I can't be safe
My mind stuck up in a rage

[Verse 1]
Everyday I'm flashing out, I really need some help
Don't like myself but shit, this me and I don't really care
They all around me for the fame and I don't need them here
It's new to me, I ain't had nothing and they were never there
Fuck the world, I be thuggin', I'll never change
Montana helped me in that cell when I ain't have a thing
My bitch don't like me but be 'round me, steady playing games
Why I ain't left? 'Cause I don't want to be alone, man
Niggas be actin' like some hoes but I really want smoke
Fuck the police, I up this bitch and I'ma let it blow
Loyalty for royalty, they don't live like that but I ain't know
Look behind me, I see [?] while standing up in cold

[Hook]
Walk alone, I miss Lil' Dave
I think 'bout dying everyday
In the streets, I can't be safe
My mind stuck up in a rage

I build my own empire, they ain't knockin' down what I made

[Verse 2]
Everyday I'm flashing out, I really need some help
Don't like myself but shit, this me and I don't really care
They all around me for the fame and I don't need them here
It's new to me, I ain't had nothing and they were never there

[Hook x2]
Walk alone, I miss Lil' Dave
I think 'bout dying everyday
In the streets, I can't be safe
My mind stuck up in a rage
