[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Uh-uh, yeah
Uh-uh, yeah
Slime

[Verse 1]
4 in the morning, shorty textin' me down
Say she want a nigga for to slide through
I was tryna make the pack touch down
My niggas drivin', that's some shit I don't do
These niggas cappin', keep it G, which one you workin' bitch?
And I'm too slimy for to be up on some hurtin' shit
He slang that iron, on 4K Trey, yeah I can vouch for jit
Slidin', you be in, so you be out, oh, I'ma talk my shit
Real player never sayin' who he fuck with
Real hoes never layin' with niggas they hoes slept with
Tryna put this cutter on a nigga on some fuck shit
They ain't down with me but they know I'm one nigga that it's up with

[Chorus]
Nigga, I came through swervin'
I was thuggin', gettin' loaded, gettin' dirty
He want smoke, we blow it, make him choke it
We gon' murder him
Sippin' potion, tryna focus
Nigga play, we shoot another film

[Verse 2]
Been gettin' dirty out my top so nigga, what you wan' do?
I'm with some niggas with no name, when you say something, they like, "Who?"
He lost his brother to this shit, but he gon' bang 'til he through
And I can tell you Black snort 'caine before he load up and shoot
I'm smoking doja, my cup dirty, Percocets, I'm on two
This nigga actin' like a bitch, I can't control what he do
Well bitch, we steppin' on you, a hundred flyin', comin' through
And fuck that bitch, that ho ain't shit, she cross that line with me too

[Chorus]
But nigga, I came through swervin'
I was thuggin', gettin' loaded, gettin' dirty
He want smoke, we blow it, make him choke it
We gon' murder him
Been drankin' potion, tryna focus
Nigga play, we shoot another film
Nigga, I came through swervin'
I was thuggin', gettin' loaded, gettin' dirty
He want smoke, we blow it, make him choke it
We gon' murder him
Sippin' potion, tryna focus
Nigga play, we shoot another film
Nigga, I came through swervin'
I was thuggin', gettin' loaded, gettin' dirty
He want smoke, we blow it, make him choke it
We gon' murder him
Bitch, we bangin' 4K Trey
A nigga play, we shoot another film
