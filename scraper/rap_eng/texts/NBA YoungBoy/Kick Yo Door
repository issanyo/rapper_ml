Bow, bitch, kick yo' door, uh

This ain't the time for games now, bitch, I'ma wipe your nose (Slatt, on slime, nigga, uh, uh)

Dirty bitches, talkin' groupie bitches, always in my face
Bloody niggas, he got plenty bodies, caught another case
Nobody savin', all he wanna know is who gon' die today (Blat!)
Wet that nigga up in traffic, he got road rage
Slime, he just wiped a nigga nose for a whole thing
He on probation and he thuggin', fuck what people think
Said he gon' buy his bro a cutlass with some candy paint
Get that money, nigga

[Chorus]
Bow, uh, bitch, kick yo' door, uh

Bow, hit the ground, bitch
Please don't make no sound, bitch
We came here for the pounds
Show me where the money 'fore yo' head I leave some rounds in (Agh)
This shit could go straight or I could leave here with yo' head split
