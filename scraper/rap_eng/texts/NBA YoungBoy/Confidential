[Intro]
Any day now
No no, we don't play now, yeah
Where I'm from no it ain't safe, no, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm like take me to the safe now, yeah
Where I'm from no it ain't safe, no, yeah
You get shot up in your face, oh, yeah
Nigga know that we don't play, no, yeah
Confidential, ridin' 'round in the rentals
Bad bitches tryna fuck on the lil niggas
Wrap it up, we wrap the bricks and then we send 'em
Young nigga, gettin' to it, chasin' millions, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hop out the back of the Bentley, I'm thuggin'
Strapped with that forty, you know I'll bust it
Hustlin', yeah we be trappin' in public
Strugglin', I really came from nothing
Gone on the road, I be chasing that money
Flooded in diamonds, you ain't taking nothing
Hitters on go and I'll push the button
Shoot out anywhere, you know it ain't nothin'
John Wall, that's my nigga
Ralo ahk, know I'm with it
Stood tall in that prision
Now I'm up and bitch I'm gettin' it
Talk on the flip, they be tappin' my cellular
Fuck the police and you know we ain't tellin' nothin'
Know that I'm with it, I'm quick for to step on somethin'
Really about it, nigga never gon' run from that
We don't know you then we won't sell you nothin'
Take your chain if I feel that you stuntin'
Rob you, I ain't leaving with nothing
Make a song, watch how quick I'ma burn you

[Chorus]
I'm like take me to the safe now, yeah
Where I'm from no it ain't safe, no, yeah
You get shot up in your face, oh, yeah
Nigga know that we don't play, no, yeah
Confidential, ridin' 'round in the rentals
Bad bitches tryna fuck on the lil niggas
Wrap it up, we wrap the bricks and then we send 'em
Young nigga, gettin' to it, chasin' millions, yeah

[Verse 2]
Confidential, ridin' 'round in the rental
Worldwide but I still be dealing
I used to be on the ground
Now that I'm up bitch I'm way in the ceiling
All of that fake shit you do I don't feel it
Talkin' 'bout hits and you know I'll send it
Niggas hating 'bout the fact that I'm in it
Contemplating about makin' them millions
Not wasting my time with bitches
Quit it right after I hit it
Thank the lord that I did it
I really came from them trenches
All of my niggas they with it
Moving dope through the city
Like the beat, when it's beef I'ma kill it
Hop in the foreign, I start it and hit it

[Bridge]
Confidential, ridin' 'round in the rental
Bad bitches tryna fuck on the lil niggas
Wrap it up, we wrap the bricks and then we send 'em
Young nigga, gettin' to it, chasin' millions, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm like take me to the safe now, yeah
Where I'm from no it ain't safe, no, yeah
You get shot up in your face, oh, yeah
Nigga know that we don't play, no, yeah
Confidential, ridin' 'round in the rentals
Bad bitches tryna fuck on the lil niggas
Wrap it up, we wrap the bricks and then we send 'em
Young nigga, gettin' to it, chasin' millions, yeah

[Outro]
Ayy YoungBoy, gang
Yeah, I'm like take me to the safe
I'm like take me to the safe now, ayy
Get shot up in your face, yeah
