[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I swear I'm traumatized, whoa
I'm caught up in that fire

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I swear I'm traumatized, caught in that fire
Lot of bullets flying, whole lot of people dying
I swear I'm traumatized, I'm hypnotized
Like I'm a reaper, I see blood when I open my eyes
Won't sacrifice my child, 2020 we all will die
I'ma go fly high in the sky, take a doll and I pop out his eyes
Hit the gas and I jump out the ride, I'm causin' suicide
Head on collision, collateral damage, I'm letting go of my pride

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Percs and molly in my casket so I can roll in heaven
Get a bad bitch up out of Magic, need a ho in heaven
I need me a TEC and I need me a stick, have a shootout with the devil
No weed up in my kingdom, Ben said that he need a seven, let's go
Cheat on my girl, I'ma fuck on that ho
If I go broke I'ma stick up a store
If you got to school, go strapped with a pole
Better not let a nigga come step on you, no
Got brand new shoes, don't step on my toes
I'm ready to fight with a nigga or ho
I leave out the class 'cause I gotta go
I'm gettin' head in the bathroom
They always talk 'bout me, no they don't know 'bout me
Gotta pray before I sleep, the devil talk to me
Gotta get 'em out my dreams, 'fore he take over me
Get down on my knees, like Lord don't cancel me

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm traumatized, caught in that fire
Lot of bullets flying, whole lot of people dying
I swear I'm traumatized, I'm hypnotized
Like I'm a reaper, I see blood when I open my eyes
Won't sacrifice my child, 2020 we all will die
I'ma go fly high in the sky, take a doll and I pop out his eyes
Hit the gas and I jump out the ride, I'm causin' suicide
Head on collision, collateral damage, I'm letting go of my pride

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Traumatized since I was a boy
Hit the target, we don't shoot at cars
We'll shoot at 12, nigga fuck the law
Scream fuck 'em all, we forever ball
When I hit the head, watch the body fall
It's guns up when we involved
Thirty eight baby, keep my revolver
Glizzy with a dick, that's the problem solver
Traumatized, traumatized, traumatized (traumatized)
Seen my main man commit suicide
It was right in front of my eyes, I couldn't even cry
To this day I don't know why, it's still eating my insides
We gon' stand tall, we don't play soft
Catch 'em down bad and shoot his face off
I been puttin' in overtime, nigga I'ma take off
Gotta get it every minute, we don't take no days off, oh

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I swear I'm traumatized, caught in that fire
Lot of bullets flying, whole lot of people dying
I swear I'm traumatized, I'm hypnotized
Like I'm a reaper, I see blood when I open my eyes
Won't sacrifice my child, 2020 we all will die
I'ma go fly high in the sky, take a doll and I pop out his eyes
Hit the gas and I jump out the ride, I'm causin' suicide
Head on collision, collateral damage, I'm letting go of my pride
