[Intro]
And I hope, I hope everyone
Everyone I have been in a relationship with
Find someone that make them more happy than I ever did
Even tho I know bullshitin'
And be like you don't
But I know you love me
Slatt

[Chorus]
When it all comes down, I been here for too long
And I still can't believe that I didn't moved on (yeah)
Ain't no sign of love
It done ran away without no trace
I ain't for you no more, you ain't gotta come back it's too late

[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta move on
I done found another girl who ain't mad about the names on my face
I guess my home wasn't a home
I'll accept the fact if another man up in my place
You ain't gotta try to fix it, I ain't worried about it
And if you looking for your shit it's on the curb bout it
Bought a water meter and it's way off the meter
Yo' love is plain, Tell that hoe I don't need her
Told me to stop but drink still in my liter
Hope when you come that I be gone, I don't wanna see you
Forever I'll stay the same but I can't no mo'
Forever ducking your presence till I can't no mo'
And I remain the same with a big sack (aye)
Said don't buy no car but I done bought a big 'bach (yeah)
They say my ex been looking for me
Where she at (aye)
Tell her leave a message, Imma' call that bitch back (aye)
And bae I love you
Never did you wrong but Imma leave like a thug do
And I'm regretting the fact that I even touched you
Even though you said fuck me it’s never fuck you (it ain’t never fuck you bae)

[Chorus]
When it all come down I been here for too long
And I still can't believe I didn't moved on
Ain't no sign of love
It done ran away without no trace
I ain't for you no more, you ain't gotta come back it's too late

[Verse 2]
I put my life on the line
I ain't never give fuck what no anybody had to say
And if them people try to come and pick me up
Tell them bitches before they come in here I'm blowing out my brains
Cause I don't know
How you would let pride come in here and catch me slipping
I always knew you would leave any day
How the fuck I ever  put myself in this position
Fake friend follow you, you follow back
But I been knew you was like that
I don't want to see it so I block you
I don't care bout that

Aye look mane the hook tell it all

[Outro]
When it all come down I been here for too long
And I still can't believed I done moved on
Ain't no sign of love
It done ran away without no trace
I ain't for you no more, you ain't gotta come back it's too late
I put my life on the line
I ain't never give fuck what no anybody had to say
And if them people try to come and pick me up
Tell them bitches before they come in here I'm blowing out my brains
I'll do life for you, Why the fuck can I see that you wouldn't do the same
