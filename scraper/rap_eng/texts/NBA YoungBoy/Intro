[Intro]
Oh Lord!, Please protect from these bitch niggas!, on a mission tryna get rich nigga, you ain't a fan you gon' get it nigga

[Verse]
It started with a dream, I'm only 16, but shit nigga its my time to blow
I started with some niggas bout a year ago, but they ain't live up to the shit that they'll talk
But now I'm in it I'm my own boss, now every nigga 'round me NBA they running for
More money more problems, time to go to war, I feel its you or me I ain't tryna go
It's just some shit that you don't do and we know right from wrong
Fuck wrong with you nigga, I don't wanna do no song
Nigga you know what you did and that shit was wrong
How I feel, nigga play and we gon' get him gone
We posted on the block, don't give a fuck 'bout 12
Keep it 100, 100 niggas who never fell
Im strapped I can't let you get me outta here
Ky got booked for a Pistol me and P bond him outta jail
We be with that first 48 something, See who gon' run up on me, bitch who gon' take something?
City to city I be with it you know how Im coming, screaming free D Dog RIP Dave until they put me under
Strapped from the belt 2 holes in you bitch no Ferragamo
Running with some steppers, who gon' stretch you if you trip
You know how we live, you know you ain't real
Tell him pull up since he say its up there how it is
Meet me by the Canal where Elijah got killed, Pussy!
