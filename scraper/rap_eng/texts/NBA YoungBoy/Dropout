[Intro]
Say, you see that nigga in the cut, yeah him right there
Aye watch him, he keep lookin' over here

[Chorus]
Bae, bae, they must be thinkin' we won't rock out
Soon as them niggas pop out, I'm bound to let some shots out
We pull up I'ma jump out, he run I blow his shit off
In front that house keep actin' like you raw, you can't live off (bitch)
400 grand, I buy a lamb and chop the top off
I'm tryna drop a block off, you play we blow the block off
Want smoke? we gon' rock out, I'm a rich fuckin' dropout (yeah)
Come out the window, swing that cut around and knock 'em all off

[Verse 1]
That menace shit, that Fat Boy leanin' shit, watch how that draco kick
Home of the land, I'm talkin hunnid' bands, that's how you catch a bitch
Bust his head, now I could tell you how to stretch a bitch
Give you a test, now I can't tell you how to pass the shit
I'm caught up in this flexin' shit, these niggas on that rappin' shit
That 4, 0 that's that Cali' shit, now I be quick to clap a bitch
Lil Ben, this that ratchet shit, that money I'ma stack the shit
Now I can't smoke no weed but best believe I be on activist
I'm reckless, I'ma walk up to that hoe and whip my cock out
I bat that bitch, she talk loud, cut up and I'ma shoot y'all
I'm short and that hoe too tall, pussy tight she give me blue balls
3, 3 that's only one call, say they know me, I don't know ya'll (I don't know you bitch)

[Chorus]
Bae, they must be thinkin' we won't rock out
Soon as them niggas pop out, I'm bound to let some shots out
We pull up I'ma jump out, he run I blow his shit off
In front that house keep actin' like you raw, you can't live off (bitch)
400 grand, I buy a lamb and chop the top off
I'm tryna drop a block off, you play we blow the block off
Want smoke? we gon' rock out, I'm a rich fuckin' dropout (yeah)
Come out the window, swing that cut around and knock 'em all off

[Verse 2]
(uh, rock out) yeah bitch, 38baby 2
I'm sayin' what it is, yeah, playin' we gon' step on you
Slime, I'm straight out that north nigga
I ain't never play 'round like that bitch ass nigga
Draw to chalk shit what you 'bout you better stand on that

[Outro]
Bae, they must be thinkin' we won't rock out
Soon as them niggas pop out, I'm bound to let some shots out
We pull up I'ma jump out, he run I blow his shit off
In front that house keep actin' like you raw, you can't live off
Nigga, huh
