[Chorus: Project Youngin]
If you searching for that person who can change your life, yeah
Start by looking in the mirror
Believing in yourself, release that beast you got inside, yeah
Now it's time to make these people feel us
Grinding all four quarters tryna make a dollar
Is your money being long worth your life being shorter?
No nine-to-five, playin' with the blocks like it's Tetris
Pray to God I'm still alive, that's the biggest blessing

[Verse 1: Project Youngin]
I done been through a lot
And I ain't got a deal or ever seen a mil but I'm still thankful for the shit I got
I don't even need to open my doors, why?
I can jump out the top
Wave the nigga, no surfboard
Just a two door coupe, slidin', gettin' this guap, yeah
No scammer baby, huh
Hustle hard on the block, yeah
I'm a real magician, hah
Turn the sandal to rocks
You got them credit cards, I keep a dope boy knot
And I'm sorry mom, ain't graduate from college
But I make the thousands out this part pot
I'm workin', I'm workin', I'm workin', on my way to the top
Stuntin' hard on purpose, know I got niggas hot
Teach you niggas how to get some money, I'll school you
Keep the tool, I'll use it
Don't let this light skin fool you

[Chorus: Project Youngin]
If you searching for that person who can change your life, yeah
Start by looking in the mirror
Believing in yourself, release that beast you got inside, yeah
Now it's time to make these people feel us
Grinding all four quarters tryna make a dollar
Is your money being long worth your life being shorter?
No nine-to-five, playin' with the blocks like it's Tetris
Pray to God I'm still alive, that's the biggest blessing

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Anything that I want I go get it
Out the north, I came up in them trenches
I had to stay down just to get it
Make the count, I go hard by the minute
Brand new Porsche that I got, it ain't rented
I been changed on by so many
Put my mind to it, I ain't stop 'til I'm in it
Now that I'm up I can say that I did it
I clutch on my heat 'cause I know they want kill me
Tell 'em my life and I know that they feel me
Whole lot of money, you know I'm still dealing
I swear that this is one hell of a feeling
I walk on the stage and turn up to the ceiling
Strapped with the glizzy, you know that I'm with it
YoungBoy who you like right now? who you feeling?
Project Youngin, man I swear he the realeast
Paranoid when I'm out on the road
Staying safe, any day I can go
Full of pain, I don't know what to do
Sip on this lean and I go with the flow
No I won't stop, I put that on my soul
Hundred thousand, got my neck looking froze
Blow a bag with every one of my bros
A hundred, I'ma stand on all ten toes

[Chorus: Project Youngin]
If you searching for that person who can change your life, yeah
Start by looking in the mirror
Believing in yourself, release that beast you got inside, yeah
Now it's time to make these people feel us
Grinding all four quarters tryna make a dollar
Is your money being long worth your life being shorter?
No nine-to-five, playin' with the blocks like it's Tetris
Pray to God I'm still alive, that's the biggest blessing
