[Verse 1]
Bitch, I had pulled up fresher than a motherfucker at my best
Playin' on my top so I say that’s a bet
If they get out of place, we gon' leave them in check
Cold hearted, I don't lean on that
Diamonds layin’ on a vest on my chest
Bitch, I'm aggressive, suck me up, I break yo' fuckin' neck
Bitch, I got on Prada head to toe
I got them choppers by the floor
I got that wrong by the low
I got one block already gone
I cannot stop, I want him gone
I pay that price to bust his dome
I'm all alone while I'm at home
I changed the numbers to my phone
Hol' on

[Chorus]
Top down, choppers on, uh-uh
Bitch, you must be dumb, we kill him dead, nigga, bam-bam
Bitch, I'm rich as fuck, accept myself, so I don’t care now
Thou shall not kill so I guess I’m goin' to hell now

[Verse 2]
Hol’ on
Bitch, I'm loaded
And I'm rollin' like a rollin’ stone
That nigga got your feelings gone
A half a million in my home
A Rolex on my son arm
Convicted felon, bare arms
Speak on that, I'm goin' to jail
You know I do that time strong
Hol' on, what it is?
Shorty say I keep that shit too real
Every diamond froze, bitch, you knowin' I don't never chill
If they say that, then fuck it, nigga, tell them bitches what it is
You play, I bet I bust a nigga
You know I do this shit for real
(baw, skrrt)
Stinky hoes
Bitch mad that I got my own
Want smoke, nigga, what you on?
Nigga want smoke, I'ma get you gone
I ain't never put them choppers down
Been asked her if she gon' leave me 'lone
Purple weed got my mind gone
Bitch, I'm pullin' up with my top down
Let's bang, nigga

[Chorus]
Top down, choppers on, uh-uh
Bitch, you must be dumb, we kill him dead, nigga, bam-bam
Bitch, I'm rich as fuck, accept myself, so I don't care now
Thou shall not kill so I guess I'm goin' to hell now
Hol' on
