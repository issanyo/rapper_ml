[Intro]
All of my niggas some shooters, most of 'em they be trappin'
Praa!!
Prrr!!!

[Chorus]
All of my niggas some shooters, most of 'em they be trappin'
Ain't no pretending, we live like this no acting
You better watch out for your friends cause niggas be hatin'
The minute they feel like they know you, they'll try to play you
But I'm ready for anything, strapped with that burner every time I'm rollin'
City to city just me and my shorty
Tried sellin' me dreams I ain't never bought 'em
Livin' life on the edge now we start to fallin'

[Verse 1]
They gave up on a nigga you know what I mean
Since younger than this I been chasing my dreams
On Double XL, but not the magazine
Locked in that cell missed alot of things
Thinkin' bout how to take over the game
I gotta make my way outta the ring
My heart full of hatred, my chest full of pain
My heart full of hatred, my chest full of pain
Four deep in the whip while we trap out the Range
We up in BR, took a break from the stage my nigga tryna figure out what I made
For my chain they don't know what I paid
I ain't have no money, I remember them days
Come run up on me you get hit with the K
These niggas hatin' and I know that they fake
If you don't like me, don't come smile in my face
Yea, If you don't like me, don't come smile in my face
Ain't no waiting I'ma up let it spray, I'm just waitin' on a nigga to play
Keep it on me when I'm up in the A
Could you touched anywhere, anyday
Nigga better stay the fuck out my way

[Chorus]
All of my niggas some shooters, most of 'em they be trappin'
Ain't no pretending, we live like this no acting
You better watch out for your friends cause niggas be hatin'
The minute they feel like they know you, they'll try to play you
But I'm ready for anything, strapped with that burner every time I'm rollin'
City to city just me and my shorty
Tried sellin' me dreams I ain't never bought 'em
Livin' life on the edge now we start to fallin'

[Verse 2]
I ain't know what to think, now I know what to call it
Ain't got no regrets you know that I'm faultless
Tried sellin' me dreams I ain't never bought 'em
I'm tryna figure out why the fuck is he callin'
I caught myself when I had started fallin'
It's up with me, yeah you know It's retarded
Shake back bitch you know that I thought it
And I'm knowin' that you see how I'm ballin'
I know that my baby mamas fed up with
I know that my niggas steppin' with me
You dissin' but know you ain't fuckin' with me
You niggas need to try to catch up with me
We confiscating money and stackin'
You niggas ain't bout it, y'all all actin'
You know that my niggas they still trappin'
You run up on me bitch we all clappin'
Smashing round through the Cali streets
Valentinos all on my feet
Chasin' money I ain't worried bout beef
You wanna book me then hit up Fee
None of that shit mean nothing to me
All my niggas know what up with me
Negotiate put it in front of me
He say what? Bitch you know that it's dumb with me

[Chorus]
All of my niggas some shooters, most of 'em they be trappin'
Ain't no pretending, we live like this no acting
You better watch out for your friends cause niggas be hatin'
The minute they feel like they know you, they'll try to play you
But I'm ready for anything, strapped with that burner every time I'm rollin'
City to city just me and my shorty
Tried sellin' me dreams I ain't never bought 'em
Livin' life on the edge now we start to fallin'
