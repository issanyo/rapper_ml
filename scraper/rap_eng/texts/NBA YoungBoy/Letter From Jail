We will never be the same (we never be the same, yea)
Everything change ( everything change)
You don't know what i been through
I swear i been down for so long
You weren't there when i needed you
I relies i'm on my own
Im somewhere writing a song
Thinking bout where we went wrong
I swear that she think i'm so hard
You told me you would hold me down
But now you ain't no where around
I really thought we was forever
But as i get older i learn
Forever never be forever
But when them niggas
Killed lil Dave i knew that shit there was forever
Pe'nem go out of state for that purp and that drank
When they come back they changing the weather
They ask whats my purpose of how i'm living
I'm growing up i take life serious
I just want to be able to say i did it
At the top of the biggest hotel in the city
Just me and Pete talking bout the riches
I feel complete but its something i'm missing
I feel like nobody fucking with me ( Yeah, i feel like nobody fucking with me )
My girl foreign from Costa Rica
Im trying to get in good with her people
If you believe that then quit fucking with me
She say you see that im still fucking with you

When she catch me down worrying bout a nigga
She pick my head up say fuck all this niggas
(X2)

(HOOK)
Tell them get on they shit if they hating he go against the grain
We gone slay em
I do this for Ari and Bayne
I think about yall on the daily
Passion all i ever needed
Fuck all the ones that betrayed me
So my niggas fall off and get on
Shit i just wanna tell them we made it

(HOOK 2)
No i ain't rich but this life i live so amazing
I just wanna take care of my baby
I just wanna take you to Jamaica
(X2)

Put on a front just to hide the pain
I'm in to deep that will never change
I know we will never be the same
But this feeling i got it won't go away
I will go to war for you girl any day
Yeah, you know i stay strap with that 38
Ready my cup take the pain away
Stick together with me though the rain

What we going through that life of fame
They don't want to see us together mane
On everything no i won't ever change
On everything girl you better not change
(X2)

(HOOK)
