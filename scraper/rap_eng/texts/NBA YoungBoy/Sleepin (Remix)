[Chorus: Leeky Bandz]
Tell me what you think 'bout when you go to sleep
I think 'bout murder, think 'bout felonies
I think 'bout murder, think 'bout felonies
Bitch I'm the chef, I came with the recipe
No you can't cook, they ain't share sauce with me
Can't walk in my shoes, no you can't walk with me
Took the chains off my neck, they done unleashed the beast
Took the chains off my neck, they done unleashed the beast

[Verse 1: Leeky Bandz]
On my mama I speak to the streets
Be a boss, don't be working for cheap
Made mistakes, you can learn some from me
Don't be dissing, don't worry 'bout beef
I'm up early, I can't get no sleep
Everybody need something from me
My heart on froze, McFlurry
You try to rob me, I dare you
You talk 'bout murder, I hear you
You shoot in the sky, you scary
I know you don't love me no more
But I still remember times we cherish
I know you don't be in the streets
With my flag on red like cherries
My money stacked tall to the sky
My pants fall down, embarrassing
I know you want come over here
Switch sides, better stay over there
Haters get popped, I ain't talkin' Bel Air
Yeah they shoot but they aim at the air
I seen niggas get popped, I ain't talkin' Bel Air
Yeah they shoot but they aim at the air
I seen niggas get popped, I ain't talkin' Bel Air
Yeah they shoot but they aim at the air, go

[Chorus: Leeky Bandz]
Tell me what you think 'bout when you go to sleep
I think 'bout murder, think 'bout felonies
I think 'bout murder, think 'bout felonies
Bitch I'm the chef, I came with the recipe
No you can't cook, they ain't share sauce with me
Can't walk in my shoes, no you can't walk with me
Took the chains off my neck, they done unleashed the beast
Took the chains off my neck, they done unleashed the beast

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Bitch I'm the chef and I came with the recipe
All of my niggas, I know they gon' step for me
Steady be askin', I know they don't care for me
Up in the cell, they ain't have no help for me
I'ma go hard until none' is left for me
Spent fifty bands on a Patek Philippe
In the McLaren, do the dash, goin' fast, ain't no drillin' me, no
North side on the block, I'm strapped with that pole
I'm takin' chances, get on my knees, I'm shakin' the dice and I roll, yeah
Chasin' that money, you already know how it go
38 Baby, I'm straight out the jungle, nigga I'll never fold, no
Hellcat, not a Charger, diamonds they drippin' like water
Four sons, need a daughter, I think it's gon' make me go harder
Spend the bands up in Florida, stay with a chopper, they know it's retarded
Montana wrecked the motor bike, so no more I do not want a Harley

[Chorus: Leeky Bandz]
Tell me what you think 'bout when you go to sleep
I think 'bout murder, think 'bout felonies
I think 'bout murder, think 'bout felonies
Bitch I'm the chef, I came with the recipe
No you can't cook, they ain't share sauce with me
Can't walk in my shoes, no you can't walk with me
Took the chains off my neck, they done unleashed the beast
Took the chains off my neck, they done unleashed the beast

[Outro: Leeky Bandz]
My heart on froze, McFlurry
You try to rob me, I dare you
You talk 'bout murder, I hear you
You shoot in the sky, you scary
You shoot in the sky, you scary
You shoot in the sky, you scary
You shoot in the sky, you scary
My heart on froze, McFlurry
You try to rob me, I dare you
You talk 'bout murder, I hear you
You shoot in the sky, you scary
