[Intro]
If you stand for nothing, you gone fall for anything
Yeah ,and I stand for something,I dont fall for anything

[Chorus]
Gotta focus put my mind to it
Had to work and go hard for it
I done lost a lot of friends for it
I created me and [?] to it
I just had to find a love for it
I just had to find a time for it, and im on my way heading to it

[Verse 1]
I been waiting for this for so long
I jumped in and went hard on these songs
[?]
For my gang i forever put on
I can't slip and get put in the dungeon, but won't move without a banger on me
I got so many people counting on me
One up to all of my niggas that under
You ain't never noticed till you're gone, and they don't show you love until your funeral
Fuck all that other shit young nigga get the dough
I just want my people straight before i go

[Verse 2]
Put my time in the studio to get up out the street
They say hard work gone pay off, I know patience is the key
Everybody changing on me like they stop believing me
But I know my time  coming i been late at night no sleep
It ain't nothing that can stop [?] if you're really chosen you gone get up and go get it
You gone make it if you want it
I won't stop until i get it every morning i be on it
Dont settle for nothing (I won't yeah)

[Chorus]
Gotta focus put my mind to it
Had to work and go hard for it
I done lost a lot of friends for it
I created me and [?] to it
I just had to find a love for it
I just had to find a time for it, and i'm on my way heading to it

[Verse 3]
For so long I had nothing, i struggled
Had to man up to make this shit better
Dedicated, ain't stopping for nothing, and i put that on all of my niggas
Up in my dream i see millions,no i won't stop until I get it,my hopes to the ceiling
No I can't slip off my pivot, no i can't waste all my time wasting 'round with these bitchs

[Verse 4}
They dont know how bad i want it
I swear that i want it they know I won't stop til i get it
Driving that foreign Bentley [?] I'm only 16 yeah you need to come see how I'm living
I'm on [?} the Wraith I'm just sitting and looking and watching the stars in the ceiling
Where I'm going, I don't know
Very confident how i'm feeling

[Chorus]
Gotta focus put my mind to it
Had to work and go hard for it
I done lost a lot of friends for it
I created me and [?] to it
I just had to find a love for it
I just had to find a time for it, and im on my way heading to it
