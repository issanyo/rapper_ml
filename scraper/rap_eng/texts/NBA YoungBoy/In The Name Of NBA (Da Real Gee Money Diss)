[Verse]
Shout out to your main bitch, shout out to her neck
It's cold outside ain't got time to play so please don't get wet
It's just me, and my young boy at your front door, with that tech
Ain't shit free, that's it for me, I demand a check
Shout out to my weed men, I call them the geek squad
I smoke too much I just lost my thoughts I'm feeling like a retard
Got two best freaks plus me riding in that two seater
They face to face I'm by myself but they hugging like a wife beater
Shout out to my OG for him I'm putting in work
Shout out to them real killers that's putting in that twerk
Wooh 3Three a real nigga shout out to my set
Shout out to my jeweler, for my wrist and neck
You don't mess with NBA nigga you know you get shot
Like Davie shot in the fucking 10's
My shit be rich as fuck
A nigga try me, a nigga get shot up
You better stay up in your lane
All I know is bang
I'm a nigga from NBA, my gang
All my niggas bang, we don't play
Bitches so reckless, you get your cock sucked
Who the fuck is GG nigga
Me and gang will kill you nigga you will die, nigga
You niggas on my dick, my nigga 3Three get this shit together
I got the Glock on me everywhere I go
You see this shit, this is the shit I do daily
All this bullshit you did to me, fuck that
I got arrested in November and put 6 months on my shit
I don't give a fucking damn
I ain't got no respect nigga
I'm only 17 and I got a whole lot of money
Me and my niggas firing shots at every hater we know
Bitch
