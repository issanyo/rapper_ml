[Intro]
Whoa Kenny

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Came to the top of the mountain like a lion
I'm tryna see what the business
Came from the block and right now it's that time
I made it out of the trenches
Never look back, I ain't pressin' rewind
Thank God for the way that I'm livin'
I never slipped off my pivot and I can tell you how I did it

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I came in with the dopeboys, I came in with the rockstars
I came in with a cold heart, and I left as a popstar
I came in with the dopeboys, I came in with the rockstars
From the beginning I played my part, I left the game a permanent scar

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Yeah, I left the game a permanent scar, yeah, yeah
Money callin' everybody 'round me, way in Abu Dhabi eatin' fisheyes
Takin' dabs at a seven star hotel, at the top the penthouse
Wine and dine on a big roof, we go monkey like a chimpanzee
The dogs with me, yeah Kenzu
I was fuckin' gettin' sucked up by a three nothin' less than two
They was all tens, nothin' they wouldn't do
For me, nor the whole crew 'cause they know we all players, no suits
YSL the slime, we not Saint Laurent (slime)
They don't respect your mind when you born blood (respect your mind)
Ridin in a Benzo, with a Maybach on the pillows
I put Balenciaga on my boxers, hands on the trigger

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I came in with the dopeboys, I came in with the rockstars
I came in with a cold heart, and I left as a popstar
I came in with the dopeboys, I came in with the rockstars
From the beginning I played my part, I left the game a permanent scar

[Verse 3: Quando Rondo]
Got a gangster bitch and she so 100, she don't even speak English
You ain't talkin' 'bout money, you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', we don't speak the same language
My bank account got a large amount, two bad bitches in the Bentley truck
We don't do no cappin', my whole team havin'
I done figured out that's why they envy us
I'm in a Sprinter van, you on a city bus
And we don't tote .380's, yeah, we glizzied up
No matter where I'm at, I'm throwin' sixes up
You can't do no track 'cause you ain't real enough
All in first class, we finna live it up
On the way to the bag, I ain't givin' up
For a couple racks you gon' give it up, yeah, hey
Hi-Tech with the Wockhardt, livin' life like a rockstar

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I came in with the dopeboys, I came in with the rockstars
I came in with a cold heart, and I left as a popstar
I came in with the dopeboys, I came in with the rockstars
From the beginning I played my part, I left the game a permanent scar

[Verse 4: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Came from Reebok to Versace, I upgraded from Huaraches
You set the bar and I top it (I top it)
They can't knock it, they know we the hottest (hottest)
I collected way too many bodies
I think Thug gave me too many thousands
I pull up in that Benz with the highlands
I get lost in my house, you can't find me
I'ma fuck her so good, now she can't find no other
I done mastered this shit, I come straight from the gutter
I done mastered this shit so I'm used to this shit
For a verse I got ten, gave it straight to my brother
Did a verse for a ten, gave it straight to my brother, yeah
I'ma say it like that, know you heard me, yeah

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I came in with the dopeboys, I came in with the rockstars
I came in with a cold heart, and I left as a popstar
I came in with the dopeboys, I came in with the rockstars
From the beginning I played my part, I left the game a permanent scar (permanent scar, permanent scar, permanent scar)
