Act right, act right

[Verse 1: NBA Youngboy]
When I first met you I was down for to get you baby
I remember the first time that I kissed you baby
No you won't understand this way that I been living
Love it when I'm with you
No I can't explain the feeling
No I can't lie every time that I'm with you I love it when I see yo smile
We smoke on that loud, we sit and we talk
Every time we roll around
Fuck all these hoes my attention on you
You already know how I get down
They watching us but I'm strapped in this truck
Let em' play and it's going down
She don't smoke but every time she with me we be faded
I'll never change on you girl you my baby
Promise that I would protect you through any altercation
Code to my heart yea
You got the combination

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Aye, sippin' that lean, I'm monster
My bitch, she look like Tiana
Chopper big like Iman Shumpert
Rockin' that Wang, Alexander
Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m Shabba
Kanye told me he was happy
Four of my hoes got family
Now I be gettin' them dollars
Diddy be given' me knowledge
Xan in the lean give me power
Tear up the pussy, got molly
I be whippin' the chowder
My bitch, she be in college
What the fuck you talk about me
Little Uzi got the dollars, aye
2050 in the hunnid
Nigga, I'm stuntin'

You don't get nothin'
I'm countin' the comma
Lil Uzi gettin' the dollars
I be designer
I ain't worried 'bout your homie
