[Chorus]
My No. 9 love it when you got it on
Baby you so hot, all these diamonds cool you down
Got a lot of guap everyday I walk around
Baby girl I'm up, ask 'em how I put it down
Just give me a chance, promise I'ma make you love me
And me and you together could accomplish more than something
Askin' would I leave, baby that's outta the question
Everything I make a day, I bring it back you count it for me
Umm, right or wrong
I'll never salt you down
I hope you feel me through this song
Promise you won't never leave me 'lone

[Verse 1]
Tonight it's Wednesday baby, me and you we goin' out
And don't worry bout a thang we gon' have fun now
Lotta money in my pockets when I'm walkin' 'round
Once we get back to the house, girl it's goin' down
Started staring in your eyes, then I tongue you down
I wanna show you that I love you, lemme hold you down
You my lil' 38 baby, with my necklace on
Don't like you mad, but you even cuter when you frown
I really need you shorty, you my mate
Never do a thang to hurt you, get that through your head
I been hustlin' everyday, I been goin' in
Run up a bag, I'll let you count it when I make it in

[Chorus]
My No. 9 love it when you got it on
Baby you so hot, all these diamonds cool you down
Got a lot of guap everyday I walk around
Baby girl I'm up, ask 'em how I put it down
Just give me a chance, promise I'ma make you love me
And Me and you together could accomplish more than something
Askin' would I leave, baby that's outta the question
Everything I make a day, I bring it back you count it for me
Umm, right or wrong
I'll never salt you down
I hope you feel me through this song
Promise you won't never leave me 'lone

[Verse 2]
I'll go a lot of miles for you baby
Birkin Bag, Goyard, anything you want just tell me
Fine No. 9 got me loving the way you you smellin'
Yo Chanel lotion got me loving how you feelin'
Baby what we talk about, I'll never tell
Treat you like you my lil thugga, buy you YSL
VVSs cool you down 'cause you hot as hell
Can't tell you nothin', you NBA, you Never Broke Again

[Chorus]
Baby you so hot, all these diamonds cool you down
Got a lot of guap everyday I walk around
Baby girl I'm up, ask 'em how I put it down
Just give me a chance, promise I'ma make you love me
And Me and you together could accomplish more than something
Askin' would I leave, baby that's outta the question
Everything I make a day, I bring it back you count it for me

[Outro]
Ummmm, right or wrong
I'll never salt you down
I hope you feel me through this song
Promise you won't never leave me 'lone
