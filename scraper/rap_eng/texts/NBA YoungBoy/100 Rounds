[Chorus: SG Tip]
I like hundred round drums on my stick
I starting shootin' at niggas for fun with my stick
This draco explode a nigga's lungs on a hit
Hitman junior, nigga I never miss
I'm out in public with the thirty on my hip
Big bullets, it'll sink your battleship
Shoot up your whole block, nigga then I dip
Move your grandma out the way 'fore she get killed

[Verse 1: SG Tip]
I keep it on me every day in the six
That mini micro loaded, ready to spit
And if I catch you down bad then it's over with
Another toetag, another pussy in a ditch
This carbon fifteen, it get ridiculous
I hit you one time, your mama felt that shit
The beef ain't over nigga, I'm shooting up your funeral too
We came in all black, ready to shoot the pastor too

[Chorus: SG Tip]
I like hundred round drums on my stick
I starting shootin' at niggas for fun with my stick
This draco explode a nigga's lungs on a hit
Hitman junior, nigga I never miss
I'm out in public with the thirty on my hip
Big bullets, it'll sink your battleship
Shoot up your whole block, nigga then I dip
Move your grandma out the way 'fore she get killed

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I walked up in the club strapped with the four-fifth
I'm with the shits, I'm waiting on you for the trip
I go to dump and everybody gettin' hit, yeah
Stop all that running, pussy boy you getting flipped, yeah
I hit up Ben, it's just me and Mister Tip
We in the six, I'm like what the move is?
I told that ho stop talking, quit with all that lip
Real hitter, bitch that burner come equipped

[Chorus: SG Tip]
I like hundred round drums on my stick
I starting shootin' at niggas for fun with my stick
This draco explode a nigga's lungs on a hit
Hitman junior, nigga I never miss
I'm out in public with the thirty on my hip
Big bullets, it'll sink your battleship
Shoot up your whole block, nigga then I dip
Move your grandma out the way 'fore she get killed
