[Intro]
Youngboy

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with a bitch that I don't know suckin' my dick
Watchin' CNN news, all of this poverty shit, how worse can it get
You say that you rich, then poverty hit, but we forever rich
Not what I psychologically meant, they want me to quit
You would do better making a Doberman sit
I rose for this shit, from one jail to another precinct
You told for this shit, this shit, you niggas sold for this shit
How old will it get before we start exposin' and shit?

[Chorus]
We all makin' choices just to die, not to live, it's a lie (Yeah, it's a lie)
It's a thug nigga life
It's a thug nigga life
They hollerin', "1 gun, 2 gun, he shot whose son?"
How long 'til your time comes? These hoes gon' misuse him
It's a thug nigga life
A thug nigga life, yeah

[Verse 2]
Patek and Audemar, got both and it don't mean nothin' (Uh uh)
I rock too many chains, just one feel like I mean somethin' (On God)
Back to back, I'm swervin' lanes, leave a stain then I clean somethin' (Let's go)
I fucked her five times, to her, I bet that mean somethin' (It don't)
They left a dime in the car, that's ten shots
Lil' nigga, I been there, 223, hangin' out the car with one Glock
Montana closed shop, way he passed the phone with my homeboy Trent now
Don't trust nobody, but it been good, it's a scary empire

[Chorus]
We all makin' choices just to die, not to live, it's a lie (Yeah, it's a lie)
It's a thug nigga life
It's a thug nigga life
They hollerin', "1 gun, 2 gun, he shot whose son?"
How long 'til your time comes? These hoes gon' misuse him
It's a thug nigga life
A thug nigga life, yeah
