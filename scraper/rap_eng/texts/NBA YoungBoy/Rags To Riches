[Intro]
CashMoneyAP
Get up, go get it if I ever want it
I got some Act in my cup, and I'm loaded
I pop them Perkys, you know I control it
Straight off the dome, you know I ain't wrote it
Gotta tell it, swear it's hard for to hold it
Up with the Glock, and you know I'ma blow it

[Chorus]
Pour up my cup and I sip it (I sip it)
Whatever I want, I go get it (I go get it)
Came from rags to riches (rags to riches)
Blew up and took over my city (my city)
I'm thankin' the lord I did it (I did it)
I wanted a bite, and I bit it (I bit it)
I swear it ain't hard to get it (to get it)
I stay with that rod, I'm with it (I'm with it)

[Verse 1]
I see blood, I want blood like the reaper
Run up that check and take care of my people
Collect them bodies, I swear I'm a demon
I pour a five of that Act in a liter
Run up the money with all my brothers
Up with that Glock and I shot it in public
Say that she love me, I know she don't love me
Straight out the north, I'll never stop thuggin'
Sosa come in, pull up with the drank for me
Walk in the mall, and I'm spendin' your budget
Label gave me a whole lotta money
Told me that they got another check for me
Never tell, I'ma keep it one hundred
Stick to that shit 'til the day I go under (dada)
My son recorded that for me
When I die, I'ma leave you my money

[Chorus]
Pour up my cup and I sip it (I sip it)
Whatever I want, I go get it (I go get it)
Came from rags to riches (rags to riches)
Blew up and took over my city (my city)
I'm thankin' the lord I did it (I did it)
I wanted a bite, and I bit it (I bit it)
I swear it ain't hard to get it (to get it)
I stay with that rod, I'm with it (I'm with it)

[Verse 2]
I swear I won't stop 'til I get it
This fortune and fame ain't rented
I'm lovin' this pain I'm feelin'
I'm way outta range, I'm winnin'
I wanted a bite, and I bit it
Had to jump out a plane and get it
Lay on top of that rank commitment
I'ma blow out the brain and hit it
I count up that money like every night
My diamonds gon' shine like a headlight
Focus on keepin' my head right
I know for a fact it's gon' be alright
Make sure my son gon' be alright
Lord forgive me for takin' lives
CashAP got the beat tight
Workin', I ain't goin' to sleep tonight

[Chorus]
I pour up my cup and I sip it (I sip it)
Whatever I want, I go get it (I go get it)
I came from rags to riches (rags to riches)
Blew up and took over my city (took over my city)
I'm thankin' the lord I did it (I did it)
I wanted a bite, and I bit it (I bit it)
I swear it ain't hard to get it (hard to get it)
I stay with that rod, I'm with it (rod, I'm with it, yeah)
