[Intro]
Opposites don't speak on me, yeah
Murder Gang, old pussy ass boy

[Chorus]
YoungBoy who you talkin' 'bout? I don't wanna talk
Won't speak on nothin', I'm too official (too official)
I heard your niggas let them choppers off, strictly 'bout beefing
I go to war with any nigga (any nigga)
I heard 'em say that they want smoke with us, ain't got no name
What you sayin'? I run with cold blooded killers (blooded killers)
I bet a nigga ain't gon' fuck with us, so what you sayin', it's up?
It's up, I'll step on any nigga (any nigga)

[Verse 1]
I go hop in the rental, with two choppers and the glizzy
If they say that they want smoke
When I catch 'em I hop out and zip 'em
You around then you turn to a victim
When I up it I'm shooting civilians
I can bet my whole bank, that's on my name, I'ma kill 'em
38 North Side where we at (North Side)
NBA, double G, I bleed that (we don't hide)
Where you trap same place we creep at (where we creep)
'Til we shoot everyone, we ain't leavin'
Want blood like I'm a demon, can't wait 'til I get me a reason
Shoot him in his head, leave him for dead
Hop in the whip and we leavin'
I live the life of a villian, you lil niggas be the nemesis
I heard these niggas ain't feelin' this
Like a reaper I be killin' shit
Chief Keef, we be drillin' shit
Said that they 'bout it, they want it with us
When I catch him I'm a split his shit
Put that on my body, ain't steppin' on us

[Chorus]
YoungBoy who you talkin' 'bout? I don't wanna talk
Won't speak on nothin', I'm too official (too official)
I heard your niggas let them choppers off, strictly 'bout beefing
I go to war with any nigga (any nigga)
I heard 'em say that they want smoke with us, ain't got no name
What you sayin'? I run with cold blooded killers (blooded killers)
I bet a nigga ain't gon' fuck with us, so what you sayin', it's up?
It's up, I'll step on any nigga (any nigga)

[Verse 2]
Niggas say that they want it, you know I ain't quittin'
I brought the TEC, it's repeatedly spittin'
Fuck the police, I'ma walk with that glizzy
Said they want beef and you know that I'm with it
If we want to kill him you know he gon' get it
Step on that boy, you know that it's instant
He say that it's up and you know we gon' bill it
Bust at that boy and shoot 'til it's empty
I got my eye on the target, I hit it
Whole lot of aim, you know I ain't missin'
Swear it's a shame, these niggas be snitchin'
Fuck all that shit, bitch we steady be killin'
Whole lot of money, I steady be stealin'
38 Baby, I'm a juvenile
400 Degreez like Juvenile
I'm forever runnin' wild

[Chorus]
YoungBoy who you talkin' 'bout? I don't wanna talk
Won't speak on nothin', I'm too official (too official)
I heard your niggas let them choppers off, strictly 'bout beefing
I go to war with any nigga (any nigga)
I heard 'em say that they want smoke with us, ain't got no name
What you sayin'? I run with cold blooded killers (blooded killers)
I bet a nigga ain't gon' fuck with us, so what you sayin', it's up?
It's up, I'll step on any nigga (any nigga)
