[Intro]
Lotta bloodshed, lotta bloodshed when that shit happens
You just ain't scared in the dark, huh? (better not be scared)

[Chorus]
It ain't nice when a thug nigga cry
It ain't nice when a thug nigga cry
It ain't nice when there ain't no moon in the sky
It ain't nice when they say you wrong and you right
It ain't nice that very moment that you die
It ain't nice that they be telling all these lies (all these lies)
It ain’t nice how they be playin’ with my life (with my life)
It ain’t right how we so blessed but we still slide (grrh)
Got a brand new Draco from my brother with my name on it
And that concrete under the gutter, left his brains on it (buh-bow-bow)
38 Baby from the gutter, Imma claim on it (Imma claim on it)
We go and spray a nigga street, I leave a stain on it (leave a stain on it)

[Verse]
Gotta brand new Glock, that red redemption for you motherfuckas (everyday)
Playin with my life, gonna make me kill all of you motherfuckas (make me kill em)
Want me to stop but I’m going in on you motherfuckas (yeah)
Pulling up to the jewelry end for to scoop my brothers (woah)
When its time to ride, we don’t never show no pity, nigga (don’t ever)
Everybody gon' die, cuttin' my ties with no killing nigga
Draco and my wife, the only people thats gon get it, nigga (gon get it)
One more time, that nigga play, I'ma make him feel it, nigga (we gon make you feel it)
You ever saw that Draco bust and it split a nigga
You wanna come and join us, you gotta kill a nigga (gotta kill)
How the fuck they hold they nuts and ain't got seven figures (got seven figures)
I'ma tell you bout when it get rough if you just listen, nigga

[Chorus]
It ain't nice when a thug nigga cry (thug nigga cry)
It ain't nice when a thug nigga cry (no, it ain’t nice)
It ain't nice when there ain't no moon in the sky (there ain’t no moon)
It ain't nice when they say you wrong and you right (yeah)
Got a brand new Draco from my brother with my name on it
And that concrete under the gutter, left his brains on it (buh-bow-bow)
38 Baby from the gutter, Imma claim on it (I claim)
We go and spray a nigga street, I leave a stain on it (I leave a stain)
