[Hook x2]
Mane it hurt me so deep (no lie)
So I don't even trynna think about it (no,no)
Plus I'm barely getting sleep (sleep)
All this pain I've been suffered from it
And I know I ain't loyal (ain't loyal)
I just pray they don't know about it
I'm just chasin' my dream (yeah)
This what it is ain't no way around it

[Verse]
Gaving my trust and I burned from it
I take my lost and learn from it
I get the time you ain't do it for me
They wrap up the shit but I can't front it
Remember days I ain't had nothin'
Jump out of the porch and get ride some
I had to shoot, trynna rob some
You niggas ain't never shot none
Comin' up I'n really had shit
We had to hustle like errday'
Startin' beefin' with the other sides
So we port up on em' hop on let it bang
I know better then a trust a bitch
I fucked the wrong feeling low shade
I ain't bout money it's irrelevent
I don't give a fuck about what you say
Countin my brother I ride for em'
Get on the stand and I lie for em'
Killing deep I got love em'
On day ??? I give my last to em'
??? up in the gray, the dog in the cell I promise we don't hold it down for him
Better be trippin' but shit is my brother, you playin' we gone spread this rounds for em'

[Verse2]
Shawty just wanted the real nigga
So I won't go let shit tears for em'
None of around me but real niggas

Trynna maintain but it's getting hard
And I swear that you don't know the half fool
Me P, V, B ridin' roud in the whip trynna smash some
Imma get plotter and down on em'
He gonna leave his head on the dashboard
He know that I ain't wouldn't change on em'
Late night on the flight to Cali smash some
Imma get plottin and down on em'
He gonna leave his head on the dashboard
This shit deeper than a fan homie
Let beat one hunnid got the gang on me
For my brothers I swear I won't change
Speak the truth and stay true to this game
Celebrate yeah we want the sarane
Actavis we don't pop no champagne
For my brothers I swear I won't change
Speak the truth and stay true to this game
Celebrate yeah we want the sarane
Actavis we don't pop no champagne
