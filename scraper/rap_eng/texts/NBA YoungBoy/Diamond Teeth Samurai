[Intro]
DJ Swift on the beat
Aye
Aye, they might could do it better
I ain't trippin' off all that shit

[Chorus]
Used to be broke but now I'm rich, I'm spendin' every penny
2Pac Shakur, ridin' through the North up in the Bentley
Curtis Jackson, ain't no actin' when I'm on a mission
Tryna assassinate my character, I ain't say I did it
Nigga, you got that yayo? (well cook somethin' nigga)
Nigga, you let them Ks go? (well bust somethin' nigga)
Oh, you duckin' them laws? (you better run from them nigga)
Oh, you playin' with that raw? (well look here, front some nigga)

[Bridge]
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha

[Verse 1]
Whole lotta killin', Helter Skelter like I'm Charles Manson
These niggas hatin' now keep that hammer, all these diamonds dancin'
Me and Meek Mill watchin' movies in Rick Ross' mansion
You disrespect, I up the TEC and let you niggas have it
23 shots, Lebron James I shoot the cavalier
These niggas speakin' on my name, I'ma get it clear
When they shot, they aimed for my brain but I'm still here
I'm a Bad Boy, never met Diddy but that's what it is

[Chorus]
Used to be broke but now I'm rich, I'm spendin' every penny
2Pac Shakur, ridin' through the North up in the Bentley
Curtis Jackson, ain't no actin' when I'm on a mission
Tryna assassinate my character, I ain't say I did it
Nigga, you got that yayo? (well cook somethin' nigga)
Nigga, you let them Ks go? (well bust somethin' nigga)
Oh, you duckin' them laws? (you better run from them nigga)
Oh, you playin' with that raw? (well look here, front some nigga)

[Bridge]
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha

[Verse 2]
I'm in the all white Porsche wit' Fee ridin' through Hollygrove
Discussin' 'bout what it's gon' take to get them birds gone
Say "look, lil' daddy," I ain't your woadie, make me bust your dome
Got a 100 shots up in the Caddy while I'm headed home
My lil' hitter quiet like Slim, we gon' shoot above the rim
We gon' pop 'em when we see 'em, whip his pockets 'fore we kill 'em
We got the police on our trail, so we runnin' when we see 'em
Don't wanna front us no heroin, we gon' rob 'em when we see 'em, bitch
Police hit our stash house but we ain't closing shop
They got some niggas movin' work who stay right up the block
Knock on the door, I need a zone yeah I got the guap
Soon as he open up the door, he gon' see the Glock

[Chorus]
Nigga, you got that yayo? (well cook somethin' nigga)
Nigga, you let them Ks go? (well bust somethin' nigga)
Oh, you duckin' them laws? (you better run from them nigga)
Oh, you playin' with that raw? (well look here, front some nigga)

[Bridge]
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
The block is hot, the block is hot, ha-ha
