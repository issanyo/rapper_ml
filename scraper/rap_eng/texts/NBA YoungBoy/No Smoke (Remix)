[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
My bro, my bro
That nigga my homie
Count money, fuck hoes
Make sure you get money
We laugh we joke, 'cause all the opps funny
Put that on God, man these niggas don’t want no smoke
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it
I can't go, won’t go, won't leave my momma lonely
No smoke, no smoke
But we die 'bout that money
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I heard these niggas want smoke (want smoke), they better pull up with 100
Yeah, we want all the smoke, I walk around with it on me
Draco protect me you, ain't taking nothing
Boy, you can try me, you know I'ma burn ya
Quick to come to it, we ain't never running
These niggas hating, they mad 'bout something
You know I’ma blow, I ain’t never stuntin' (you know I’ma blow)
You know how I'm coming, you know what to do if you ever want it (if you ever want it)
Nigga stop all that talking you know where I'm at come and pull up on me (skrt, skrt)
I hope you don't slack, you know that I’m dumping

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
My bro, my bro
That nigga my homie
Count money, fuck hoes
Make sure you get money
We laugh we joke, 'cause all the opps funny
Put that on God, man these niggas don't want no smoke
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it
I can't go, won't go, won't leave my momma lonely
No smoke, no smoke
But we die 'bout that money
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I told that bitch to kiss it, that shit landed, now she miss it
I put your ho in the mission, she put the pis' on her titties
I got the coupe with exhaust, your bitch want the molly, it costs
She wanna fuck with a boss, she told a nigga get lost
Smoking on gas in the old one, wrist's cold, Minnesota
My girl bite like a cobra, love when she bend it over
Had to buy a new Rover, fucking in a Rolls Royce
Girl, you know your pussy moist, what you need is your choice

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
My bro, my bro
That nigga my homie
Count money, fuck hoes
Make sure you get money
We laugh we joke, 'cause all the opps funny
Put that on God, man these niggas don't want no smoke
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it
I can't go, won't go, won't leave my momma lonely
No smoke, no smoke
But we die 'bout that money
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I'm looking at you haters through my rear view mirror
I'm sliding in some shit you see in Fast & Furious
I'm switching lanes on 'em, but I don't got no gears
Shawty say she wanna ride, but she don't know how to steer
They paid me for a show, but I didn't even appear
They say, "Kodak Black, you drive like he ain't got no fear"
They say, "Kodak Black, you act like you ain't got no care"
I say my car got a horse like I'm in a marriage
Pull up in a 'Rari, I, jump out with your shawty
Driving like a crash dummy, speeding to that cash money
Money all in my head, if I wreck I'm dead
Shit, I'm driving, that no cracker wouldn't even get behind

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
My bro, my bro
That nigga my homie
Count money, fuck hoes
Make sure you get money
We laugh we joke, 'cause all the opps funny
Put that on God, man these niggas don't want no smoke
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it
I can't go, won't go, won't leave my momma lonely
No smoke, no smoke
But we die 'bout that money
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it
