[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yes, I'm a rich nigga
(Dubba-AA flex)
Yes, I'm a rich nigga
Yes, I'm a rich nigga

{Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert}
Yes I'm a rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga
I heard that you is a bitch nigga, bitch nigga
Keep a 30 stick, nigga
Bitches on my dick, nigga
I patiently waited, for your ass to trip, nigga
Fuck nigga, flip nigga
You know that I'm lit, nigga
Walkin' with the bands, so I could pay for the hit, nigga
Diamond chain choker bitch, so I could not trip, nigga
They changed on me so many times, I cannot trust no one

{Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert}
No worry, no you is a bitch, so you ain't goin' up now
You ain't never bust a strap so we call that a Rust Gun
I'm the type of nigga eat the ice when the whole cup done
Diamonds they so big up in my chain, they look like mushrooms
These niggas keep talking 'bout that smoke, but they don't want none
Heavy artillery on me, heard that you got one gun
You know my chain is gon' shine even when the whole sun-done
If I wear all this shit at the same time, I'd weigh a whole ton

{Chrous: Lil Uzi Vert}
Yes I'm a rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga
I heard that you is a bitch nigga, bitch nigga
Keep a 30 stick, nigga
Bitches on my dick, nigga
I patiently waited, for your ass to trip, nigga
Fuck nigga, flip nigga
You know that I'm lit, nigga
Walkin' with the bands, so I could pay for the hit, nigga
Diamond chain choker bitch, so I could not trip, nigga
They changed on me so many times, I cannot trust no one

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Where the whole team?
Wanted you to know that I copped it
Niggas they know that I stay with the rocket
Still they be hatin', but know I ain't stoppin'
Shit we do these rappers copy
Sauced up, I'm a trendin' topic
Step on the scene, they lookin' and watchin'
Throw up that gang like fuck what the hollering (gang)
Used to be jumpin' them fences
Put my face down, and now that I'm in it
You know I stay strapped with that glizzy
17, I got locked in that prison
Wait, hold on one minute (hol' on)
You go wit' your moves, you know you gon' get it
Make me drop a 50
Leavin' the scene with blood on my tennis

{Chrous: Lil Uzi Vert}:
Yes I'm a rich nigga, rich nigga, rich nigga
I heard that you is a bitch nigga, bitch nigga
Keep a 30 stick, nigga
Bitches on my dick, nigga
I patiently waited, for your ass to trip, nigga
Fuck nigga, flip nigga
You know that I'm lit, nigga
Walkin' with the bands, so I could pay for the hit, nigga
Diamond chain choker bitch, so I could not trip, nigga
They changed on me so many times, I cannot trust no one
