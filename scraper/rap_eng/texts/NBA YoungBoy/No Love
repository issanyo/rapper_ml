[Intro]
Ayy, this ad-lib right here
Yeah (oh yeah)
Slime
June, you're a genius
Slatt, slatt

[Pre-Chorus]
Pressed by my life, my interview be the booth
I got my head on steady, going in, I can’t lose
Just want your love to be genuine, I’m the one that you use
And I won’t change for anything, I give it all up for you
But if I ever let my feelings past, baby then I’m through (Then I’m through)
And I won’t never leave, but if I catch you with another man baby, then I’m through (Oh yes I'm through)

[Chorus]
'Cause I been caught up counting up (Count up), and baby I don’t need no love (Don’t need no love)
I just want money and some drugs (Some drugs)
I’m turned up in the club (Club), blow through the ceiling with my thugs (Bitch)
They know that I don’t give a fuck (Wow)

[Verse]
Plus I’m strapped up, who wanna play with me
You know them killers stay with me
We screaming out it’s first degree
I come up banging in them streets
I’m here and I won’t never leave
My blood running down my sleeve
My feelings change with the trees
My heart covered down with lean
I’ll never choose you, won't admit that I’m right
Them hoes wanna just be you, they tell you leave out my life
They tried to make me leave you 'lone but I said "fuck it, we fight"
I’m on a road, tryna figure who you fuck wit' at night
But I say fuck it, prison taught me better, turn up rock out with that metal
You sneaking ‘round with these niggas, I guess that, that nigga better
Try my hardest not to hit her, know you think that I'ma kill her
If you leave I ain’t got nobody, I better not catch a nigga with her
'Cause in the streets nigga, we bang for our life (we bang)
For you, I risked everything, I feel like I paid the price
If you ain’t happy, I ain’t happy, I just want make it right
I’m taking twenty pills a day, might overdose through the night
Don’t wanna talk 'cause I don’t know (I don’t know)
How the fuck can I live alone? (yeah)
Don’t wanna talk before you came I was down
How the fuck can you leave me ‘lone? (yeah)

[Refrain]
On the block with that dog food, truck comin' bop-bop
Police coming (wee-do-wee), where the fuck to run now?
D. Dawg run down on a nigga, stick 'em up like lay it down
Bitch that been my girl from the jump, you play I’m  laying down
'Cause you know, I’ll never let em disrespect her (No)
On my own, I been balling on another level (Another level)
And I’m gone, I’m sending hits, they think that I’m a devil (I’m a devil)
On the road, nobody left, I done brought all my niggas (Gang)

[Pre-Chorus]
Pressed by my life, my interview be the booth
I got my head on steady, going in, I can’t lose
Just want your love to be genuine, I’m the one that  you use
And I won’t change for anything, I give it all up for you
But if I ever let my feelings past, baby then I’m through (then I’m through)
And I won’t never leave, but if I catch you with another man baby, then I’m through

[Chorus]
'Cause I been caught up counting up (Count up), and baby I don’t need no love (Don’t need no love)
I just want money and some drugs (Some drugs)
I’m turned up in the club (Club), blow through the ceiling with my thugs (I'm with my thugs)
They know that I don’t give a fuck (That's right)

[Refrain]
On the block with that dog food, truck comin' bop-bop
Police coming (wee-do-wee), where the fuck to run now?
D. Dawg run down on a nigga, stick 'em up like lay it down
Bitch that been my girl from the jump, you play I’m laying down

[Outro]
Ayy bitch don’t tell me none 'bout her, what you mean?
Ayy, long as I don’t catch her with no nigga, I'ma stay this
I'ma stay loving her the way I love her
And the day I do catch her shit, then I’m through
What it is nigga? Fuck you
Ayy, 'cause I ain’t worried bout nothin'
There’s somebody outchea for to love us all
But if we can’t be in no relationship with this person and make it work
How the fuck you gon' go be in another one and make it work, it’s the same thing
