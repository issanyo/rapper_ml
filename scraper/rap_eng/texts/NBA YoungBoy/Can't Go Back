[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
How long we gon' make it last?
I know I made mistakes, that was in the past
You wanna know the answer but you never ask it
All this money, all this fame, ain't shit too dramatic
And baby I'm just tryna make it home to you
I be thuggin', I know you don't want me to
Lately I been on the road tryna make it last
'Cause I can't go back to what I never had

[Verse 1: Yhung T.O.]
Uh, and I been on
I been full time thuggin' so the clip long
Fully automatic chopper, leave his whip gone
I don't really fuck with niggas 'cause they been hoes
Cuban choker on my neck but my money long
When I signed my first deal I bought a hundred poles
If it's pressure we apply it, ain't no comin' home
Still remember all them days I was on my own
AP, fifty bands on me
Probably why she keep tryna put a friend on me
Paranoid in this Benz, got this stick on me
I came from nothing with my niggas, it was all on me
And I don't want to leave you
Can't let all this time go to waste
Deep down I think I need you
No these feelings ain't gon' never fade away

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
How long we gon' make it last?
I know I made mistakes, that was in the past
You wanna know the answer but you never ask it
All this money, all this fame, ain't shit too dramatic
And baby I'm just tryna make it home to you
I be thuggin', I know you don't want me to
Lately I been on the road tryna make it last
'Cause I can't go back to what I never had

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
If you love me, keep it strong and don't ever leave me
Money be talkin', I remember they ain't ever see me
Why you the only one I want, I got several reasons
I keep that Glock, I die for you, and I forever mean it
Got everybody hatin' on us and I know why, know why
Money talkin' like a preacher and that's no lie, no lie
Won't say a word when it go down, I hit the block with that metal
Tryna test me money, I bet it, and I'm never gon' settle
Step on a nigga out in public and they know it's whatever
Young rich nigga granted a million, live my life like a rebel
And I never told 'em what I wrote in the letter
But I told 'em that I'd never let you go when I met you

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
How long we gon' make it last?
I know I made mistakes, that was in the past
You wanna know the answer but you never ask it
All this money, all this fame, ain't shit too dramatic
And baby I'm just tryna make it home to you
I be thuggin', I know you don't want me to
Lately I been on the road tryna make it last
'Cause I can't go back to what I never had
