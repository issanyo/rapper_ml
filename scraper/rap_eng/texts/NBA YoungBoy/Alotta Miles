[Chorus]
We done walked allot of miles for this shit
So what I know niggas can't take it from me
Life on the line man I'll die for this shit
Never give up cause this shit always been my dream
I seen my nigga shoot his dawg over money
Seen it with my eyes the realist shit I seen
That's on Lil Dave money can't change me
No they don't understand me, don't understand


[Verse]
Even when I ain't with my gang I'm still that same nigga
Them boys say I switched, I just got smarter ain changed nigga
NBA GG, that be the fuckin team nigga
Man this shit we in too deep
Outsiders they can't hang with us
Stay up in your lane nigga, them bullets change niggas
It ain't no turning back, Lil Dave up in the grave nigga
Monique had told me respect take you long ways nigga
That's why I stand tall, respect all, handle my shit just like a mane nigga
I can't do no favors for you if you ain't my fam
Can't have you in my business you might get me jammed
Tryna make it happen but we steady trappin'
Then I started rappin'
We shot out to Atlanta
Flipped off the road, my life flashed before my eyes
Looked to the Lord as I'm praying to the sky
That's when I told Beanie we too far to turn back now
He layin' in the bed I saw a tear come out his eye cause

[Chorus]
We done walked allot of miles for this shit
So what I know niggas can't take it from me
Life on the line man I'll die for this shit
Never give up cause this shit always been my dream
I seen my nigga shoot his dawg over money
Seen it with my eyes the realist shit I ever seen
That's on Lil Dave money can't change me
No they don't understand me, don't understand
