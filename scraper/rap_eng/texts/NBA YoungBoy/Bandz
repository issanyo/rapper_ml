[Intro]
Can't hear what you sayin'
Ay ay, YoungBoy

[Verse 1]
I'm out the north, Chippewa and 38
All we know is murder, so don't come our way
Ridin' with my brothers, ridin' with my gang
No they won't stop me, I put that on Lil Dave
I put my life in my rhymes, and just focus on music
Another mission accomplished, I told my gang I salute 'em
Never change on my squad, go do life behind bars
Them niggas ain't in my gang, so I don't fuck with them boys
No I ain't trustin' no nigga, let them play get they head shot
I told my brother I love him, never fall off for these bitches
I'm steppin' out rollin' tapes, bitch my life like a movie
I'm calling peeps from collective, like man I'm way in Tallulah
Go take a trip to Atlanta, meet up with Jarvis tha E
Promo tape making city, DJ calling P Mistie
Connor called, bitch we gettin' it, you know we still on a mission
Checkin' in Georgia Telly smellin' like loud and we leanin'
On every track I eat, catch up, can't fuck with me
The best I wanna be, P say don't skip no beat
I stay up in the streets, wait 'til the day we meet
And so much shit be going on, I can barely see

[Hook]
So much shit be goin' on, I don't understand
Promise to myself, take off, know I'ma be the man
You did yo shit, fuck what you talkin', can't hear what you sayin'
I ain't never had shit, I just want some bands
I just want some bands, I just want some bands
I just want some bands, I just want some bands
You did yo shit, fuck what you talkin', can't hear what you sayin'
I ain't never had shit, I just want some bands

[Verse 2]
NBA, GG be the team, broad day spin the benz, hop out with the beam
Get money, smoke weed, sip lean, I'ma tell you one time, can't fuck with me (can't fuck with me)
Young nigga won't stop, headed straight for the top, stay strapped with the Glock (stay strapped with the Glock)
Rap game on lock, still posted on the block screaming motherfuck cops
Fuck what you talkin', walkin' with it on me, don't touch me nigga (don't touch me nigga)
Been around shooters, worry about nothing, man fuck you niggas (man fuck you niggas)
Niggas sneak dissin' better stop that shit, you don't want that nigga (you don't want that nawl)
Calling in pape ain't got no money, they dumpin' niggas
If you ain't talkin' money, don't know what you saying
No, you can't hang if you ain't in my gang
We get to them benjis, ain't no type for playing
We go against the grain, you know we gon' slam
[We hit 'em all], no time for playin'
I'm pulling up with that gang, all of my niggas you know we gon' bam

[Hook]
So much shit be goin' on, I don't understand
Promise to myself, take off, know I'ma be the man
You did yo shit, fuck what you talkin', can't hear what you sayin'
I ain't never had shit, I just want some bands
I just want some bands, I just want some bands
I just want some bands, I just want some bands
You did yo shit, fuck what you talkin', can't hear what you sayin'
I ain't never had shit, I just want some bands
