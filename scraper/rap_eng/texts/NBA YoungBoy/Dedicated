[Chorus]
Since a yungin' I been gettin' it on my own
You gotta get it, nigga, that's what I was told
I ain't quittin' and I put that on my soul
I'm dedicated, that's on everything I know
I'm dedicated, baby, that's on all I know
I'm hardbody and I promise I won't fold
Like a pirate, I'm just searchin' for some gold
I'ma get it that's on everything I know

[Verse 1]
Shit movin' fast remember it was movin' slow
As a yungin' I been jumped up off that porch
Don't need no lecture you just need what you know
Half of ticket in deposits the day I came home
Yungin' on the block with a pole, tryna get some dough
Seen O.G.'s die shit, he ain't tryna go
A couple of niggas tried him, he ain't ever let it go
Revenge on them niggas, shit, I could say 'bout four
Man I feel like I been doin' this shit too long
Since I was seven, I been rappin' steady tryna blow
They done slept on me and criticised me, talkin' down
Now for to see me, bitch, you gotta go pay for the show

[Chorus]
Since a yungin' I been gettin' it on my own
You gotta get it, nigga, that's what I was told
I ain't quittin' and I put that on my soul
I'm dedicated, that's on everything I know
I'm dedicated, baby, that's on all I know
I'm hardbody and I promise I won't fold
Like a pirate, I'm just searchin' for some gold
I'ma get it that's on everything I know

[Verse 2]
You can't play around and be serious
I'll do whatever it takes just to get it
I ain't never listen to the critics
I put my mind to it now and I did it
I don't do no drugs when I'm in your city I swear I'm high off the feeling
Book me for a show when I walk in the building you know I turn up to the ceiling
They think that I act like a star
They think I'm stuck up I be chillin'
Thank the Lord that I'm far, it's so many people didn't
Down Fairfax peelin'
They really think that I got millions
I ain't even make a killing
I know they wish that they can kill me
I know that they wish that they can kill me

[Chorus]
Since a yungin' I been gettin' it on my own
You gotta get it, nigga, that's what I was told
I ain't quittin' and I put that on my soul
I'm dedicated, that's on everything I know
I'm dedicated, baby, that's on all I know
I'm hardbody and I promise I won't fold
Like a pirate, I'm just searchin' for some gold
I'ma get it that's on everything I know
