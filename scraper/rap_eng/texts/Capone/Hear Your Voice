8.	Hear Your Voice

(Maxx 39)
Always been something wrong on the right road
A white toad in a colorless light mode
I write ice cold, when the dice rolls, I might scold
The fight holds blood under the light polls
And the lampshades, we in a damp age
With a stamped paid on the forehead of my camps craze
I love to hear her voice, I love her voice as well
Mental hell, only a witch can cast a spell, what does that tell
Me when I’m asking for answers in the moonlight?
I soon write consume lights and move quite fast
The cash can have pending
Offending me when you ending this trending
Topic, your a hot chick when you stop shit
But when you move quick and assume shit
I’m rude, posed and the truth is you’re a crude bitch
To swift for the foolishness, a ghoulish kiss
I don't know that song
Can you hold that long with a throwback wrong?
Turn the goal back on
Soccer penalty like, I cock ending in fights, I block her into my sight
And that’s rude to the common man
Well that’s dude being honest fam
God has a plan
God knows where I’m gonna end, where I’m gonna stand
His job to lead me? Hell yes
It’s my job of figuring out of keeping out of hell best
And I’m so swelled stressed in a dwelled vest
But the music make me chill better
In hot or chilled weather
I come correct with the right endeavors
In never-never you fly forever
What do you get out of being a sore better?
Oh-ho-ho, What do you get out of being a sore better?

Real life comes from the heart and if you don’t believe me, leave
Real life comes from the heart and if you don’t believe me, leave
Real life comes from the heart and if you don’t believe me, leave
Real life comes from the heart and if you don’t believe me, leave

C’mon, Lets Go

Always been something wrong on the right road
Always been something wrong on the right road
Always been something wrong on the right road
Always been something wrong on the right road

(Brittney Crush and The Sun King)
Why you keep acting like this? I want to know
Why you keep acting like this? Who-ho-ho
Why you keep acting like this? Oh-ho-no
Why you keep acting like this?

If you felt some type of way, you should’ve told me something
If you felt some type of way, you should’ve told me something

Now I ask you:
Why you got to act brand new?
Why you got to act brand new?

If you felt some type of way, you should’ve told me something
If you felt some type of way, you should’ve told me something

Now I’m singing…
I’m like la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

(The Sun King and An Capone)
Always been something wrong, always been something wrong
Always been something wrong, always been something wrong
Always been something wrong, always been something wrong
Always been something wrong, always been something wrong
Something wrong
Something…
Something wrong
Something wrong
Something wrong

(Brittney Crush)
I’m always wrong
I always seem to be wrong
It’s always something wrong

If you felt some type of way, you should’ve told me something

(Brittney Crush and The Sun King)
If you felt some type of way, you should’ve told me something

So it looks to my diagnosis that you have a lot of, hostile emotions, trapped in your mind. Maybe coming from a lack of, response as far as your feelings are concerned. Hmm
To change the topic a little bit, my question to you is:
To escape those lack of feelings, what do you do?
Actually, a better question might be:

(Maxx 39)
Huh?

(Dr. ****)
How do you proceed to succeed?

(Maxx 39)
Uhh. Well I sure as hell don’t want to be like everybody else

(Dr. ****)
Is that right?


(Maxx 39)
Yeah. Everybody else. hahaha
