[Chorus:]
Listen it’s my style it's my song
It’s your style it’s your style
It’s your song
It’s my style it’s my style
It’s my song
It’s your style it’s your style
It’s your song

[Verse 1:]
Yow see i never want to kill man never
But i don’t know if i won’t kill a man ever
Cause i never stayed around for the repercussions
I was in the slinging coke
Buggy down reproduction
I know if i jerked off with the susie vasoline
Glove towel that way my first groopie
Afterwards you know a nigga smoked lucie
For miss Reynolds her body well loopy
Bigger dopay and delanapas ros games from
My Dan seeing them i got a bottle
I use to be a dirt bomb
With arms filled with ringworms with a gun in her arms
I can't believe i went platinum trying out the world and the atmosphere
This compass is crazy you was once hurting once
There eating rice and gravy
Use to be at home crib hoping for our own cell
I stuck up the sticker kids were on their co tail
All i ever wanted to be was a shooter
And disturb the peace and doing without looda
Doing these base shit without a ruler

[Chorus:]
Listen what we do and listen what we been through
But look at us now
Holding and we blowing came from growing
Just look at us now [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Yea i came up  in the ever widow hallways
With cracks in it skelly got it with a water top with the wax in it
Watching only got controlled the cause
Gone from my old dodge to a BM
I saw the door to  success i just got to put the key in
Never wanted to be a rapper
Was on the turntables cause i DJed nice black poet
That's why i got the nickname DJ slice
When rich died had to start a rally
I hit the police and did 3 in harlem valley
That’s when life changed quite strange
And then i came home and started rolling with a nigga from
The rap no dice game this shit happened so fast
Its like its in 3D
Look ma your shooters made it to TV
17 years later we still in it to knees deep
We like a couple of classics like rebuk believe me
We did it for QB in Iraq it touched the whole map
Had the world rocking for T strong
CNN break up get your dream on

[Chorus:]
Knowing what we do we been through
So look at us now
Holding and we blowing came from growing
Just look at us now [x2]
