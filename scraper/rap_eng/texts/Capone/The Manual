(Boo)
These are the dos and these are the don'ts
These are the dos and these are the don'ts
These are the dos and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want

[Chorus:]
Yo, These are the do's and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Real niggas stay ready to dump
These are the do's and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Real niggas stay ready to dump, leave ya slumped

Do ride to the death, don't fuck with jake
Do squeeze on a nigga find out he a snake
Don't walk in my hood after 11 or 12
Do the right thing and always stack money for bail
Don't fuck with the soft, do fuck with the hard
Don't ever wear a walkman when you spin in the yard
Do come through prepared, don't wait to blast
Do ?????????????????????????????????????
Don't think you gunna' win if you likin' that ass
Do your business in person don't talk on the jack
Do know the consequences getting caught and a tap
Don't let a nigga put a battery in your back
Do salute me when you see me, don't fuck up a pact
Do realize the villain of the city is back
Don't shoot it in air waste bullets for that
Do understand these codes or you will get clapped

[Chorus:]
Yo, these are the dos and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Real niggas stay ready to dump
These are the dos and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Real niggas stay ready to dump, leave ya slumped

Don't fuck with white liquor, do shots of the yaght
Don't trust when you see a nigga hoodied in black
Do whipe your prints off when you tossin' a gat
Don't let a 10-4 get a nigga the snatch
Do the white air forces, keep a tee to match
Don't fuck with my good boy, breath with that
Do look out the peephole before you leave
Don't let a nigga catch you comin' out the crib and squeeze
Do push her face down when she givin' you top
Don't let her spit it out make her swallow every drop
Do watch for the feds, cuz they seekin' indictment
Don't go do a hit a buck and whip out hydrant
Do walk around New York vest under your jacket
Don't promise a jail nigga, kites in a package
Do smoke till they have your last bag of piff
Don't fuck with a drug that'll make you scratch and sniff
Do understand these codes, or you will get clapped
Don't forget to put it down like an OG black

Yea yea, these are the codes, this is the manual
You must abide by this

[Chorus:]
Yo these are the dos and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Real niggas stay ready to dump
These are the dos and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Real niggas stay ready to dump, leave ya slumped

Do take A or C, don't neglect the kids
Do ????????????????????????????????
Do the math, look at all the bodies droppin'
Don't front on your soldiers, take em' out gun shoppin'
Do wear a seat belt when you hop in
Don't open they knockin' to ask around, ain't nobody can stop em
Don't fuck your man family, that shit is a problem
Do live by this manual consider the doctrine

[Chorus:]
Yo these are the dos and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Real niggas stay ready to dump
These are the dos and these are the don'ts
I'll give it to ya real nigga, take it how ya want
Live life by the codes and get a shotgun pump
Real niggas stay ready to dump, leave ya slumped
