[Hook]
Always on my grind, making sure I get it done
If you want it, let's get it, boy you can come and get you some
But if you fin to come, bitch you better come correct
You know if you run, know somebody get you wet
If you willing, then you tripping, cause homie I'm not the one
You know me I'm on a mission I ain't doing this for fun
Know I'm all about the fun, so they better cut the check
Money calling gotta run so somebody getting left

[Verse.1 Malik Montana]
I'm a fully loaded fool, with nothing to loose
Cut nothing but buttons for you, nothing to do
With custom made suits like whip in the park but making the soupe
I'm listening to Pac laid in the coupe
Waiting for your wife to come through
She do me like a noodle, spaghetti, bone apetite
Had too many men with manners like you Malik
The federals watch me, narcotics with cameras like paparazzi
Gotta speak with a code, cause even my phone calls
A registrated, I dedicate this few bars
To all of the true hustlers that can relate, salute
Those on the run and those on they paper chase
Better days are coming, young and don't loose your faith
Gotta keep your head up, let's get up and make that
Change, it's not too late
God who gave me game so I'm balling like I supposed to
Hopping out that range, chain flashy like a photo shoot
Hated by many, respected by all
By any means necessary, I'm ready to pop off, let's go to war

[Hook]
Always on my grind, making sure I get it done
If you want it, let's get it, boy you can come and get you some
But if you fin to come, bitch you better come correct
You know ...run, know somebody get you wet
If you willing, then you tripping, cause homie I'm not the one
You know me I'm on a mission I ain't doing this for fun
Know I'm all about the fun, so they better cut the check
Money calling gotta run so somebody getting left

[Verse 2 A-Mafia]
Yo, I keep it moving, keep them attuned with powerful music
Funny catz with them dummy rapz, you must be stupid
Keep shooters, those ab ...reach for the luger
I haunt your dreams and your aspirations I'm Freddie Kruger
No days off, I be that Fergus...
Hi haters, hi haters, I'm at the jeweler
You know my style is too official, it's not an issue
Cause I still feel like when the mafia kisses
Fuck a non believer, you cats is bottom feeders
Nothing to come and my reality is not a dreamer
I'm not a schemer, niggas...
And we coming with heaters

We world leaders, y'all the queen of...
I'm already out the throne, see I could come and meet us
Y'all could never see us, competition, wanna be us
So ... until you get a hundred mill

[Hook]
Always on my grind, making sure I get it done
If you want it, let's get it, boy you can come and get you some
But if you fin to come, bitch you better come correct
You know ...run, know somebody get you wet
If you willing, then you tripping, cause homie I'm not the one
You know me I'm on a mission I ain't doing this for fun
Know I'm all about the fun, so they better cut the check
Money calling gotta run so somebody getting left
