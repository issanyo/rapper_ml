[Verse 1: Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo, TV's in the headrest, Sega entertainment
Pushed the Lex Land on the way to my arraignment
D.A. got a witness, lawyer can't explain it
Face the judge, on some money maintain shit
Black Ceasar, hundred grand on the Visa
Took the stand, suddenly, caught amnesia
Found him in the warehouse, tied in the freezer
That's the life of a thug when he hold heaters
Willies, up North, turn to dick beaters
Sendin flicks to any bitch that'll feed us
360 waves with the shell-top Adidas
The Black Jesus, Lebanon, remain calm
Rocking state greens, sippin on Dom
Arabic link, Cartier on the arm
Nigga fresh off work release, Hercules
Nigga fuck the D's, we blazin trees
Capone bag the keys, let's move like a gypsy
It's hot out here, relocate to Poughkeepsie
Feds play the roof in the hood try to hit me
Snakes on the block wanna sip Mo' wit me
The life of a thug wasn't made right
When I die leave a bottle of Dom, by the gravesite
The tombstone let the record show I was sinnin
Lay me in the earth with the Armani linen

*chorus*
All my convicts, livin on the edge of life
Criminal type thugs who love to pull a heist
We move sheist, livin in these days of trife
Rockin four carat ice, in Thug Paradise

Thug Paradise, yeah, yo, yo, yeah, yo
In Thug Paradise

[Verse 2: Capone]
One for the money, two for villains
Three for Willies holdin millions, four-wheelin' with no feelings
Shit, my resident, Q-B settlement
Hit him on the hill, Jake wonder where the metal went
Jump in the Ac-u-ra, then blast a trey
Pour this A for those who passed away
My whole clique shinin like a diamond
While on Rikers Island, fake niggas eat a dick rhymin
Maricon, we got it sewn
Capone-N-Noreaga's on, we try to touch like a flip phone
I sip on Porter while you get extorted
The single, "Illegal Life/Stick You," I hope the world bought it
(Cop that...)

Yeah no doubt
Capone-N-Noreaga

*chorus*

[Verse 3: Noreaga]
Yo it was broad daylight, woke up, early in mornin
Didn't even brush my teeth, I grab heat
Bust the fonta leaf, then roll up, some Sweets
They was on since yesterday night, Dunn got bucked
In his windpipe, we'll go to war until you pre-write
Pick tight, can stick to guns in a gunfight
Yo Nostradamus, the new millenium was promised
Black comments, we tryin to squash that beef
But niggas get hard-headed, filled wit leaded
Fuck around and get deaded, nine beretta'd
God set it, automatic
Yeah me you face these niggas starvin
General Iraq squadron
Acousiastic, attract with the Glock plastic
Move quickly, switch spots to Poughkeepsie
Black gypsy, but tell me, destiny
Move quickly, stick him, he tryin to stick me
You mad morbid, but it's a planet out of orbit
Can't absorb it, but tell me, you all for it
Can't call it, my defense'll make you forfeit
Son you quit fuckin wit Iraq shit
The General who, create my own crew like Yacub
Blast the two, and plus your chick too, now know

*chorus*
