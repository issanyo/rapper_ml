Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, check it out
Niggas know, niggas know where we comin from
And it's gon' go down like this..

[Capone]
Yo, I gots no name, I cause pain, people'll cry
My size vary at the murder scenes, homocide bag me
Try to trace me back to my leader
I put niggas in chairs to pine boxes way up under the stairs
Niggas use red dots, make me follow they path
I hit cops, they be raw, tip is ten thou' cash
I'm metamorphic, I'm forced to switch
Dum-dums to hollow tips; unfortunate, you can buy me legit
I get heated when I seperate my shell
With the pin in my back, I bang like (?) I got some nerve
They jam right? But I still get respect and heard
I hit niggas legs for fame, my lead through, shit in the game
I leave a red stain whenever I'm sprayin
I'm known as the B-U-double-L-E-T, and S-L-U-G
Enough'll make you D-I-E, Queens Finest (yeah yeah)

[Hook: Algado & Shoballotti]
Yo stolen car -- top down, on point -- real route
Set it off -- thug it out, pull a heist -- peel out
Fingerprints -- ain't none, black mask -- no face
Cash flow -- no sweat, Jakes come -- no trace

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo fuck these niggas let's ride on these niggas
It's so simple Dunn I'm down and don't fuck around
Comb the hood, in two black Excursions
Lookin for this nigga so we can merc him
Parked in front of his building for like two hours
Been around the corner for a few hours
Came back, there he go, let's go, that nigga ours
Hopped out the truck, went right at the coward
The gun showers, rain on these niggas they frontin
He didn't even saw it comin..
Hopped back up in the trucks, light the tree back up
I need that Dunn, havin to deal, with these fake niggas
And fake bitches, give me that Dutch, it's never enough
Niggas O.D. off of us (Queens Finest)
It's never enough, bitches O.D. off of us (yeah yeah)

[Noreaga]
Whaaaat? Can I rap, can I rap?
We keep it under, no rotunda, with the fully thunder
Mad traffic, and I still buddy whack it
Put your name on the affadavit
Just to save it, the project ghetto favorite
Laundry mat trap, the Yacub and the rat
Bill Clinton of the ghetto, respect my name
Tecs and 'caine, the rains nearly stretched the lane
Ridiculous, how my shit spit, fake fishes
Non-religious, Christians won't pay visits
Fast for a month, and mix a lot in the trunk
Ice fuckin full of skunk, double barrel of pump
Kick rhymes like priests, I'm a golden boy
I got a brand new whip, and it's stolen boy
Fiends love me, they see I'm still holdin void
(Queens Finest, yeah yeah, Queens Finest, yeah yeah)

[Havoc]
Watch me flow, a nigga like me all about dough
Bonin' your ho, and have her hard to find like 'dro
You know we Range Rov', come through, tinted lay low
But most of these niggas don't show 'til ya blow
Don't, wanna come through Queens, if shorty act stank
Be like, "Mami won't you meet me halfway?"
Shook cause the crooked side done took a long trip
Niggas on point runnin the gauntlet, fuck with
Niggas that heartless, picture me, you carcas
CNN Mobb shit, don't let us start to plot shit
Chill Dunn I got this, better learn from what I spit
Hail what the God kick, bow to what this nigga live
Bunch of dead niggas get hit when they reneg'
Like it's hard to find your fuckin crib
I be up in the cut, in the bushes, pick up
Last from where you took it, you hit? Now I'm good kid
