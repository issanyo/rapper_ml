[Verse 1: Noreaga]
Carhartt dungarees; it's estimated that my mind elevated
Organized crime related
Bam Bam Bigelow, I'm not a gigolo
More like a general, chef like Emeril (look it up)
Panama Canal shipment, distributed to Dominican Republic
Republicans'll love it
Democrat, Arafat, Madoff
And we don't take a day off
We lay off and spray off
Meditate, Indian-style, knees bent
Throw grenades at the precinct, and I'm talking recent
Doing donuts on the highway in a Tahoe
Cash flow, I go
Jefe, muchacho
Hermano, Italiano, horizontal, Verrazano, old wino
Speak wisdom when we kicking it
I sit back and listen, it
Effect me magnificent, I'm different

[Hook: Noreaga]
See, I prefer that you call me by my alias
Nickname change at times, various
Girls curious, bi-coastal
Like a toaster, we toast you
Swift when we approach you

[Verse 2: Noreaga]
Niggas warned me, they informed me
Jakes swarm me, they straight storm me, they all on me
CNN tradition when them bodies go missing
Anybody get it -- Muslim, Jew, or Christian
Your honor, I was taught to move the onions
It's just what I learned from OG's as a young'un
It don't mean that I'm a bad person
My Tec-9 got hiccups, it do mad burping

[Capone]
Shootouts, niggas is mad heartless
Them automatics and targets
Be the topic of discussion for the bloggers
And the robbers and the slingers
Muslim and Catholic, the non-religious
They recite every rhyme like holy scriptures
Consiglieres you might fear
White Airs looking like coke in heaven
You wanted it, we right here
We beat charges like Roethlisberger, paid attorneys
No witnesses, DA want to burn me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Capone]
From the home of broken dreams and coke babies, it's so crazy
They blow eighties, a body and a shell drop
Ricochet bullet hit shorty neck in the nail shop
The morgue is ice cold, but the corners is real hot
Non-stop observation, hustling's my occupation
Give me a few ki's, I'll show you how to lock the nation
Queens House criminal, OG kush the minimal
Shorty grabbed my soldiers, salute the general
We send them shots back and forth like a rocking chair
Overthrow your block and lock it just like Rasta hair
Peer -- it's mad cake on the plate now
The streets know we ill; any minute could be a shakedown
Tap your pants pocket, take your wallet and your girl bangles
Little goons, I wing em like Bojangles
I walk with angels and a halo, my jewels glisten
CNN reporting the war, listen

[Hook]
