[Capone]
We put too much work in
Seen too many cold days, too many nights servin
It's been tried, we will survive
CNN rise, keep street ties
We got a hundred niggas strong
A hundred niggas armed to kill you right or wrong
You can't murder what's dead
We walk the pavement with, one in the head

[Capone]
Now what I stands for I rise for, my man's who I die for
Blows frontline in the war, despise law
I'm built to be guilty, filthy, dirty, rich
Niggas wanna kill me 'fore I'm thirty-six
Stop my lifeline, I'm tryin to hundred thousand dollar car and ice mine
Predicate felon, lifetime
Consecutive cases, no respect for racists, haters hate this
Hope to trade places, and piss where my grave is
I lay this down, I blaze this pound I'ma say this now
Fuck around and I'ma chastise
You ain't that wise, I'm out to capitalize
My cap size is nine milli, leave you slumpin back in your ride
My hood sit on bloody acres, parallel to my maker
I squeeze vertical a fiend I'm servin you
What dirt'll do to virginal niggas, is get 'em kilt
Filled with hot lead, but not by the feds, who wanna see me dead?

[Hook: Capone]
You can't killlll, me
We put too much work in
Seen too many cold days, too many nights hurtin
You can't killlll, me
It's been tried, we will survive
CNN rise, keep street ties
You can't killlll, me
We got a hundred niggas strong
A hundred niggas armed to kill you right or wrong
You can't killlll, me
You can't murder what's dead
We walk the pavement with, one in the head

[Noreaga]
I can't believe what I saw, through the eyes of the corner
I had warrants on each name, aliases in each state
I got caught, what the hell did I thought?
Turkey bacon or turkey ham, it's pork
It's the same thing, you should look how I walk
The gun make me lean to the left, I saw it and repped
Look for the moment to step, Mo-e' I'm wet
The judge know I caught a nigga and I beat him to death
But it's okay, I go jet ski in the Bay
Away from New York, and go lay up in L.A
I know intelligent niggas that move dough
Leave out of the hood, and lose all of they shit
Well I don't lose nuttin, I learned how to mix with other cultures
Other vultures, niggas know I leave my path
Kneeds the math, it's good like the Haitian hash
It's amazin, you know my nigga Maze won't crash, it go

[Hook]

[Capone]
As long as blood in my vein flows niggas gon' hate
Wish on my death date, give my description, to the plain clothes
Rely on my fate, remain cold
Like lost souls to the crossroads, guns I been bought those
I'm a legend, only if Lord knows
You can't kill me and place me in Potter's Field
Y'all niggas not as real
I predict that I'ma die squeezin, thug it through the five seasons
I place my trust in the heat, my higher bein
You cannot kill me, or have me leanin slumped on a project gate
With one in my stomach, barely breathin
My moms grievin, my wife cryin, my kid's a bastard
I bust iron, fuck livin or dyin
Fools who work out get tight caskets
Niggas who merk out when I spray crash kid
That's the way that I'm on it
