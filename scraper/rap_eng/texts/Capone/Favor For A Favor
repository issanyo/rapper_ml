A yo a favor for a favor
It's how we do business
Bottom line, end of the story, period sentence
Wanna walk with me
Follow thru the entrance
So we could post up on the block
Sit on the benches
Favor for a favor
It's how we do business
Bottom line, end of the story, period sentence
Wanna walk with me
Follow thru the entrance
So we could post up on the block
Sit on the benches

[Verse 1]
Ya..ya..ayo...
Stupid retarded
Regardless, heartless
Verrazano bridge cross thru that q-u
All white air force
Puff coat, north face
Made in america
A story of a court case
Land of the brave misbehaved ex-slave
Ex-king conquera'
Ex-inmate to a
Apologize, kiss the ring or nigga's scrape you
We will face you
Then replace you
Treat you like a number 2 pencil and erase you
I used to cook coke up without nigga's smellin' it
No inhalin' it
Baking soda aroma
Stay tony roma
Good coke, corona
Only one rule, gotta re-up when ya soba
Peppermint breath strong
Heron stepped on
My hustle is old just like a fossile
Deblanco
Like casso, big shit
Calossal!

[Verse 2]
A yo
Callico's get tossed in the garbage
Half narses half heartless
Shoot empty the cartrage
Red dot, movin targets
Put a slug in ya face
Go watch the blood trail
Leak from ya waist slow
The day goes by how ever the pay goes
Same rules apply new york to vala[?] hoe
Section 8 kid's smellin' like weed and roach pape'
Dude throat right in the cabinet next to the old blade
Guts right in the fridge next to the oj
Serial hustler
All I drink is rozay
Time is money, I'm watch how the clock tick
Handcuffed to da block
And never got my lock's picked
Break it down, spinnin back
Watch it!
Open on nigga's block
We the new blocksmith's
The coop is stupid, sedan obnoxious
Fly shit that we can pull in pine boxes
