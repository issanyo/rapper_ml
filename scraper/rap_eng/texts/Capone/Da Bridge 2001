(Aiyyo calm down, fall back!
Y'all Queensbridge always fightin up in here!)

[Marley Marl]
Ladies and gentlemen, we got Queensbridge Finest up in this mothafucker
Tonight
They just came from war
They wanna let you know a little something about where they come from

"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge"

[MC Shan]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never over, we left our mark
This jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs, kill that noise

[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody with strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those who squeal
Squeezin' them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got room to spit 'em
But through my rhymes, they livin'
We the Bridge, through tracks I'm givin'
Never lose sight, 41st Side's my life
The 40th Side of life, dunn, we keepin' it tight

[Cormega]
What, yo, it ain't just the music
Hoop aspirations or ghetto illusions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin' through each building
If you sleep, you better wake up, as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record with Nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist
There's no denyin' the greatness
Queensbridge, never try to disgrace it

[Millennium Thug]
Yo, yo, yo
The Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries
Pull out long guns, pop out casualties
It's like I gotta see a thug nigga ill as me
The Ill Will in me, I rep that willingly
Step back enemies, death trap, feelin' me? (yeah)
Six blocks, losin' my mind
Runnin' from D's
These P's got me usin' my nine, I pop off

[Nature]
Y'all know the place where stars is from
Every night it sparks off and the crowds'll run
We leave chicks trippin' over strollers (Slip, it's over)
In Queens, you be the victim 'til you get to know us
Your hood's bogus, my hood be keepin' it crunk
So much be jumpin' off I ain't sleep in a month
Y'all can play the front line, I be deep in the cut
Drive through, y'all can't peep it enough
You in the Bridge, nigga

[Capone]
Yo, you must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
Out-of-towners get knocked off
We regulate block laws
I had the hood like Watts flooded with cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
Mister Everything that re-center pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!

[Tragedy]
Yo, for you, I take a fifth to the head until I earl
Boomerang dunn, QB bust they gun
Keep them PC niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis
The last verse, "T.O.N.Y." remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who wanna set it

[Prodigy]
Yo, yo, yo
Move, me and my dogs comin' through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get rained on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns
2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to y'all?
We like that snowball, goin' downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin' bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar'
The Head Niggas In Charge
We number one, QB there's no competition
Infamous Records, Bars and Hooks listen
Littles, Noyd, and Mega
We independent, dunn we Infamous Mobbin'
G.O.D., Nitty and Twin in
The Ill Will Bravehearts, L.E.S. millennium

[Nas]
Yo, blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin' with a hundred soldiers
Gangstas, we postal
Oh you didn't, wanna know whose life was written
The life I'm livin'
The ice, the women
The kites that sendin' to lifeless biddin'
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin'
La-ser, AR-15 doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your ho, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo, the biggest on earth
Queensbridge know they history, left y'all cursed, cuz

[Hook] *repeat to fade*
Keep on rockin', the Bridge'll keep rockin'
If the beats stop rockin', the Bridge'll keep rockin'
