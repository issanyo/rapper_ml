[Verse 1:]
Ya little bitch
CNN
A lot of people thought this would never happen
And yo bow in the presence of some legends and some real shit
Real shooters worldwide they’re gonna feel this

CNN
We’re mixing Yapi with the Remy shots

Sour with a splitter riddle like a little ether

DJ going to quest

Yo we’re CNN once again blood smell like potpourri
Knees bent catholic church gripping on some rosary
Everybody posed to me do it like some older Gs
Never flash on them
If you got it you’re supposed to squeeze
They ain’t know that we shoot still
I met Capone in Harlem
He got a coup still
You had the worm with the drop top proof pill
CNN be riding out glove box blue still
I don’t fuck with fade bitches and they fake sums
Only bust on real bitches bust real guns
I’m only fucking if she shoot for me
Get a base the fuck both of us
You know recruit for me
Tell them bitches yo yo

Marleys that we sell to
Big drug deals
