[Capone]
Well I'm known to keep it thorough in the MC field
No respect in 01, in 02 you kneel
Cuz I shoot to get loot, when its time to perform
Brought fire to the set, when they turn my mic on
I'll rap a second time, and put two in the air
E-MONEY the bridge &  murder unit is here
Nigga front and get popped, ain't no fuckin with my dough
Girls with my jock, with my dope intro

[Maze]
Ooh I like the way she movin in her pradas
She got a booty like and African (YEEAH)
