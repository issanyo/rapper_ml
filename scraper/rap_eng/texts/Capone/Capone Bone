[Intro]
(House of hits ya'll. . . for the ladies. . . Capone Bone. . . Marley Marl)
If you want it, you got it forever
If you want it

I like your stockings, stretch socks even your Reeboks
Thug you out, take you on tour, to all the weed spots
We can sip wine, bump and grind on the slow-mo
But on the d-low I heard your man was a homo
We can combine just like Two-Five and DoLo
Tell me where to put it like solo
Meet me at 702 I like your steelo
Now boo face it, you're bangin' to your ankle bracelet
I went against the grain when I said I'd never taste it
You work all day come home ready for foreplay
Your favorite dish, hominy grits and fish saut√©
You love a thug boo, highly impressed by my tattoo
Slim cut, walk with a strut keepin' it natural
Your physical frame is like a Jada Pinkett
I like to hear you moan, spank it grab your X and O anklet
Freak off

[Hook]
If you want it, you got it forever
If you want it
If you want it you got it forever

Sick and tired of your wannabe thug he got you heated
Knowin' that you need it but he's still afraid to eat it
Friday night you tell him that you out with the girls
But you're zonin' in my world gettin' bent till you hurl
I got the fireplace, bearskin rug so kick your feet out
Hit me on the hip eight hundred I got the weed out
Hydro keep it on low now bust the weed out
Slide off the DKNY's so I can eat out
Jump inside a jet black 5 or watch you speed out
Adrenaline got you open like a stack of Benjamin's
Then back to the Bennigan's to eatin' pasta with Dominicans
Eat it up

[Hook]

Real niggas in the front, fake niggas in the middle
Live niggas in the back shake just a little
Real niggas in the front, fake niggas in the middle
Live niggas in the back, shake just a little
