SameOldShawn: I was listening to "Back From the River" the other day.

Mystikal: Holy shit!

SOS: Can we talk about that on camera?

Mystikal: Damn right we can.

SOS: Okay. So can you go into that -- the whole "Drag Em 'N' Tha River"/"Back From the River" kind of thing?

M: I actually started it.

SOS: You started it?

M: I kinda started it. Unintentionally and...I didn't really give a fuck. Cause at that point in my career, I was battling against what we call bounce music in New Orleans.  When I was first coming out, I considered myself hip-hop coming from New Orleans, and all the New Orleans audience wanted to hear was bounce.  So I was trying to compete with the fucking bounce market.

And so I had a lyric that said, "One, never gonna change my style/Two, never gonna bounce, never gonna bow." That was a stab at bounce music, bounce artists.  I didn't give a fuck.  And UNLV didn't take too well to that shit.

SOS:  So they did "Drag Em N the River."

M:  So I'm just riding down the street the next day, and I heard, "Oh, he wants some/Ain't that cold."  Beat knocking -- Mannie Fresh got that shit bumping!  Then I hear, "Mystikal, you a hoe."  What?  Hold on, motherfucker!  That's where that started.  And that was a real fun rivalry, man
