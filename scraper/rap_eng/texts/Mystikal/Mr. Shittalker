Diaherrea mouth muthafucka
Talk shit constantly
Talk so much shit....wipe my mouth with toilet paper...

First Verse:

WHO DAT?
Think they talkin' more shit than Mr. Shit Talker?
Run around, disgustin' muthafuckas make me get Foghorn
Don't make me pick your ass apart like a vulture
Next thing you know I be preparin' these rhymes for you like sculptures
I thought the last seven would have taught'cha
I'm known for remarkable feats with my points in the tape recorder
Mystikal into MC Mad Slaughter
Standin' and I dropped a couple of rhymes and they dropped the charges
I ran 'em by deep margins
How dare you try to compare a fuckin' private to a FIRST SERGEANT?
I come with more rounds than a hundred soldiers when they marchin'
I make more noise than a yard of German shepards when they BARKIN'
Spin the bin, it, will make heads split when they hear them
Shit you get flipped from this MACHINE GUN MOUTH NIGGA
My rhymin' skills be dirty if I wash'em
I keep pepper on my tongue so approach me with CAUTION!!!!

Chorus:

That's MISTER!!!!  Mr. Shit Talker
You fuck with the old
And all of a sudden what make you think you can fuck with the new shit?
That's, Mr. Shit Talker....
FOUL MOUTH SON OF A BITCH!!!!!!!
MISTER!!!!  Mr. Shit Talker
You fuck with the old
And all of a sudden what make you think you can fuck with the new shit?
That's, Mr. Shit Talker....
FOUL MOUTH SON OF A BITCH!!!!!!!

Second Verse:

I fly past ya like you're movin' backwards
You fuckin' good for nothin', no talent, non-rappin' bastard!
I can tell you outta breath, like asthma
I can see clean through ya like CASPER!!!
Done went from ordinary to spectacular
Refuse me then I'm swingin' at you bitches til' I see the platinum
And I bet it make you  mad, ha?
Well brace your fuckin' self cuz it's about to be some shit now
Bet'cha I'ma make a foot a part of ya
Since you tryin' to kick some dust up, got to make it hard for ya
Slow ya down like you drinkin' booze
Started workin' in the studio all night LIKE IT'S THE THING TO DO!!!
Opening act to main attraction
Therefore disrespect is not allowed no form or no FASHION!
Sell my album and I'm still smashin', BLASTIN'
Who the fuck that is, is what they askin'?

Chorus

Third Verse:

I talk more shit than a LIL' BIT!!!
Makin' it rough enough, y'all can sure feel it
Nigga be fussin' that bitch be feelin' faint
Just like a cheerleader I'm bout to (go, go) TO THE BANK!!!
And watch, the baddest niggas even gonna shrink
Keep them bitches out my damned face like my breath stank
Starin' at niggas like wet paint
You done ran out of gas that's why your shit don't wanna drank
You hit the charts but you can't stay up
You want a contract, but you don't weigh up
Mic-clutchin', rhyme bustin'
Ain't no fuckin' rushin', cuz I'm perfected to the percussion
Start to finish chorus to the verse
Bout to fight you niggas with FIRE so prepare yourself for the WORST!
If I tell you to take precaution then you oughtta
You ain't heard it til' you heard it from MISTER SHIT TALKER!!!!!

Chorus (2x)
