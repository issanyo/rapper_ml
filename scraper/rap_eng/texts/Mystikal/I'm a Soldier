[Intro]
You can tell I'm a soldier (it's time to go to war)
You, you, you, you can tell I'm a soldier
You, you, you, you can tell I'm a soldier
You, you, you, you can tell I'm a soldier
You, you, you, you can tell I'm a soldier
You, you, you, you can tell I'm a soldier
All I wanted to be was a soldier, bitch
And If you ain't a soldier, then what's yo' purpose bitch?

[Verse 1: Silkk The Shocker]
See, I'm a N-O, nigga L-I
M-I to the T
Yeah, I'm Silkk the Shocker
And yeah, that's me
Tank dog all I wanna be, nigga I told ya
Tat on my back is that of a No Limit soldier
About face for a TRU salute, to my tank dogs
Y'all scared to bust, niggas duck, 'cause we ain't sure
So don't flip me, 'cause you'll end up empty
And then I'll reload
And reload, and reload, and reload, and load
Whole barrel explode
Nigga I'm T-R-U, that means I'm TRU 2 Da Game
Mention me to my enemies, they takin' the pain
Now you can do what you wanna
But y'all don't wanna start
Fuck, these No Limit soldiers
'Cause y'all don't wanna go to war!

[Verse 2: Master P]
No Limit mercenary killas, nigga wit army fatigues
Tattoos and gats, niggas gone off Hennessy and weed
Colonel, nigga becoming the ghetto E.F. Hutton
Holler ungh and every fuckin' soldier start stuntin'
Nigga just robbin' and niggas they ridin'
Dressed and robbin' on the side
Niggas just bout it, rowdy
Niggas better show me that them muthafuckas still gettin' rowdy
I cut wit G's nigga
March playas, step wit me killas
Come wit me, real soldiers keep yo' eyes on yo' enemies

[Chorus: Silkk The Shocker]
I'm a N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier
N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier

[Verse 3: Fiend]
All my rivals remember me, Fiend
The one that call the shottie
Blastin' the mafi, there them niggas that wanna rob me
Givin' you hobbies
Gettin' slugs at your own body
For my piece, or Sugar Hill, I'm New Orleans like Lolli
I'm fearin' no man, as long as I'm stompin' in these Broganes
There's no playin', soon as this army stop, ya got no hands
Damn, ready for war, and keep the weed lighted
If they ain't indicted still, blast it, Fiend the insighted prophet

[Verse 4: C-Murder]
I'm a No Limit soldier, nigga, it's in my blood
I started rappin', so I wouldn't have to sell drugs
We 'bout it, muthafuckas representin' them killas
TRU tatted on my back 'cause I make moves wit thug niggas
You don't wanna go to war, 'cause I'ma bring the brigade
Ask the colonel, we rowdy niggas tryin' to get paid
Affiliated with game, totin' thangs that bang
On them corners we hang, and we slangin' the pain

[Chorus: Silkk The Shocker]
I'm a N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier
N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier

[Verse 5: Mystikal]
A helluva, helluva nigga right'chea
You can take that and fear it
I'm a cold blooded killa combat engineer
And a highly decorated lieutenant
I'm up on the front line, you all the way to the rear
But ya still gettin' injured
Nigga don't you know by now the tank can't be dented
And when we reach a hundred million cartridges
We ain't finished
Bitch shoot yourself in the head if you can't take it
'Cause we gonna represent it
If I said it, I meant it
If I told ya, I showed ya
I'll break y'all, outrank y'all
I was born to be a soldier

[Verse 6: Mac]
Whoa, murder, murder, kill, kill it's real
Shell shock turn your neighborhood block into the battle field
Nigga, soldier rag still on my eye, no lie
I'm camouflaged, I never die, I live longer than them white guys
We tattooed, I done gone cashews, ain't no turnin' back
Nigga won't be burnin' Mac, uh, I got the thirty gat
And it get trifer, but I'm a lifer
A camouflage sniper, from the rooftop I might ignite ya
(Bring it on nigga)

[Chorus: Silkk The Shocker]
I'm a N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier
N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier

[Verse 7: Lil' Gotti Gambino]
Gotti I told ya', I'm a muthafuckin' soldier
Forty calibers and doja, what keep makin' holes
Nationwide exposure, for me and my brethren
For fiend to bust'em, leavin' my enemies bleedin'
Being a soldier many fourteens, I be needin'
A No Limit soldier, till the day of my leave

[Verse 8: Skull Duggery]
I been a No Limit soldier since 1994
Them niggas know one thing, that Skull broked in the door
They watched me in Waco, as I bring the flow
What you sayin', hanh you nigga? You bitch? Yeah, you ho
You know one thing you can't be fuckin' round wit these niggas
Niggas out the tank, straight spittin' on you niggas
You nigga you think, you gonna get away
Slammin' jive bitches like you, dead in the pavement

[Chorus: Silkk The Shocker]
I'm a N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier
N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier

[Verse 9: Big Ed]
Nigga make some room, nigga back up, back up
Forget that thing out the trunk, and act up, act up
Got my tank dogs steppin' camouflage fatigues
I represent like a loaded weapon, paper bought wit P
When I get that thing, everybody look down and round and round
Got the M-1 spittin' fire, bring yo' set to the ground
Got the C-4 explosives in the black backpack
Big Ed be puttin' down like that

[Verse 10: Mia X]
We come strapped in, we roll thick
We represent that TRU click
Playa haters, yeah we know who you are
Make infrared shine on your head like the North Star
Bomb shit, boss bitch, mama set it off
Let it be known cowards you don't wanna go to war
The hard hitta still be the biggest mama nigga
Swallow yo' shit like a fuckin' Anaconda nigga
So, bring it, bring it on, how you wanna do it, what?
'Cause next to other's knees, I cover fuckin' dust
Anten-Hut nah, take it to the battle field
Shoppers gon' run, while we kick our enemies doors
I ask the lord, they don't want no more?
Mama, drama, told ya No Limit done took over

[Chorus: Silkk The Shocker]
I'm a N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier
N-O nigga L-I
M-I-T soldier

[Outro: Silkk The Shocker]
