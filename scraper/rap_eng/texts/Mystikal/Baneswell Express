P Xain

If you dont know by now then Ill doubt you'll ever know
So let me try and educate you with my Lyrical flow
On the Mic at this time, in the place to be
People hanging out just coz they wanna be next to me
Its a special place let me try to explain
Its not a record shop or a fast food chain
When my cupbpards are bare and Im not Hip Hopping
You'll see me down there, doing my shopping

Chorus
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
Its like a mini Mart you get more for less
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
The range of Soft drinks and Crisps is the best

Eggsy
If you dont know where it is go to microcare computing
Just round the corner from Acorn Recruiting
Sanitary prtotection, Magazines or a twix
Theres some bloke on the door who looks like Neo from the matrix

Balls
Homemade sandwiches and homemade pies
You get served after hours if you give them the eyes

P.Xain
Well dont try shoplifting and dont go nicking
The last person that did got a proper fucking kicking

Eggsy
Loads of wicked people utilise the store
One bloke did try to start a fight before
But he wasn't affiliated with the friendly staff
Coz he was rough the sort of person who would shit in the bath

Adam Hussain
Pasties, Sarnies and Polish meats
Extra strength Lager to drink on the street
I even hang round outside when its closed
Take my Mrs down there when Im gonna propose

Chorus
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
Its like a mini Mart you get more for less
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
The range of Soft drinks and Crisps is the best.

Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
Its like a mini Mart you get more for less
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
8 Baneswell Rd is the Address

Baneswell Express Baneswell Express
Do they sell booze? YES!
They got porno mags to give you an erection
And spotted dick in the frozen section
They got lager cider, cherry coke
See me outside in Pauls car having a smoke
They sell sex lube, Scratch Cards and Choc Ices
All that and more at reasonable prices

Maggot
Its a local shop but its so much more
Ilove going down there when I smoke the draw

GTB
Three bottles for a tenner Red, Pink or White
Will keep your mrs's legs ope all night

Maggot
If you need tampons and you've got a heavy flow
Then Baneswell Express is the only place to go

GTB
I took some ecstacy and went there shopping
Loved it so much next week I'm double droppping

Mysty
Sometimes I just hang out on the street
Because you never ever know who your gonna meet
Sometimes I just browse and hang around
Coz you never ever know what will be found at the

Chorus
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
Its like a mini Mart you get more for less
Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
The range of Soft drinks and Crisps is the best

Baneswell Express, Baneswell Express
