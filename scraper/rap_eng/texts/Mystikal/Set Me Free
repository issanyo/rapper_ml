[Intro: Lloyd]
Yeah you know what it is
Young Goldie in the house tonight baby, I'm a let my hat out on em haha

I'm a beast (I'm a beast)
I'm a dog (I'm a dog)
Let me off the leash so I can set it off (set it off)
Pockets fat
You acting so sad yeah
Set me free

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
Yeah you know, I'm stunning man
Look at me I-I-I'm the man
Here I go I'm coming man
For this money
I do the running man
Gun in hand we gone chop her
Wave that bitch around like a helicopter
Pointed at your eyes like a teleprompter
Haha and set you free
Yeah baby it's YG and Decatur where it's greater is the place I be
You might catch me up town down in New Orleans
Or somewhere overseas size like Chinese
Or maybe riding jet skis on Miami beach
With a Spanish freak, Vigasarafe
She's my number one fan in the messagi only English she can speak is
(Set me free) haha
I turn into an animal (animal)
Every time that the moon is full (is full)
Something so unusual
That you've never seen before

[Hook: Lloyd]
I'm a beast (I'm a beast)
I'm a dog (I'm a dog)
Let me off the leash
So I can set it off (set it off)
Pockets fat Rick Ross
You acting so sad
Soul off

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
You already know that a playa shining
And I'm sipping something
While I'm second lining
I'm back up in the game
And itâ€™s perfect timing
No more local joker
Now I'm head lining
Like Eastwood call me trigger man
I'm good but I ain't afraid to kill a man
Feels like I got the whole world in my pants
They done set me free (set me free)
Yeah, I'm feeling like Ali
In this prime baby I'm a P.I.M.P. yeah
It's me and MC in the VIP
And if you wanna roll with us we need to see id
Because I turn into an animal (animal)
Every time that the moon is full (moon is full)
Something so unusual
That you've never seen before

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Bitch stop lying on me
I smash these rappers and beat up the track at the same time homie
Young Lloyd done called me told me sit the dog on it
Hubba Hubba I'm a doba pigeon
I'm black and mean
But I got mean from being behind that fence
I'm trampolining it
Trampling over you trifling bitches
I cock one leg up when being
Full of blood pedigrees
Bitch I done told you
And I done showed you
I'm like left over pizza
I'm getting cold
I'm a dog on the song
I'm a beast on the beat
An animal on Pro Tools
And a baboon on the tune
I'm a canine when it growl
I'm a werewolf when it howl
I hit the street and rappers ran
Like fucking gunshots in the crowd
(Pow pow pow)
Ya'll was out there eating shrimp
I was on that work out bench
But I'm back on the beach
Muscle up bitch
I'm about to come get it
Suck my dick if you fucked up with it
No more beat my meat
Set me free

[Hook]
