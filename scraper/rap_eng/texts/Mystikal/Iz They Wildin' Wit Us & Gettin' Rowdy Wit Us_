[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Coincide with yo boy check out with no lines
On yo boy look out but don't hide
When you bust it up and keep rhymes
When you walk towards the tape offline
For your boys got instinct rhymes
When you bump between the sixteen lines
When you bowl win the goal bitches scream
Win the goal keep ahead keep it live
Before you go get your tattoo rhymes
For your boy pick a bell in the bathroom
Penalized doing it till he get tired of ya boy
That shit between me and you niggas
Then trying to figure out what I say
I give less than a fuck, what you doing over there
Just don't get in my way
Hear my records feel my presence now and forever and until
Stop what you doing and work it fuck it nice
Just complete it with a licking to the man right there
Tell you motherfuckers what we came to do
It's just plain as day but they don't wanna see
If you don't wanna fight get the fuck is you'll be
In the spot working on my beat
Long time I'm having no compromise
Ima open them up and them I'm dumping them out
I'm keeping it hard so don't get mad
Cause I'm loading 'em up and I'm running 'em out
Hit 'em with the bang then I feel a bang
Take her in the backyard outside leave 'em in a ring
Teach the niggas not to fuck with us
And next year we gon do the same thing and

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mystikal]
Now who you is nigga?
I'm Mystikal nigga
Now who you is nigga?
I'm Busta Rhymes nigga
Now is they wildin with us
And getting rowdy with us
Now is they wildin with us
And getting rowdy with us

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo
Me and my nigga Mystikal make a plan that generate
Sufficient amount of funds across many lands
Generate the heat the place radiate
When I break shit I drop create a earthquake
Yo, anyway we still double masking
And get the gambit and eat super pie niggas
All over the track with a kick in your back
I know we making you black
And you stay fucking with that
You my niggas is platinum
Can you deal with the fact?
Me and the fact getting money
With my name on the plaque
You know how I blow the spot
You niggas can't fuck with what I got
Nigga please
Ooh nigga you don't need me to smoke trees
Nigga freefall make you feel some of these
Four or five hollow tips pinned in your ass
Get off the Earth the fact that you even in my class
Yo
All my live bitches get over here
And all my live bitches get with the niggas right there
All you other niggas get in the rear
All you weak funny niggas you better stand clear
Come inside of my storm put on your gear
You ain't up here my nigga better be up outta here
Yo, when we come you know we the one
We only here to get money till the whole shit done

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mystikal]
Now who you is nigga?

Now who you is nigga?

Now is they wildin with us
And getting rowdy with us
Now is they wildin with us
