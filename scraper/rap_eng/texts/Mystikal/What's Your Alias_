Bitch I'll backslap or backstab after that kidnap a whack rap
Bring it louder if you coming to rap
Your arms to short your legs to small
I'm the sure shot shit off of deputy dog
Break it in two and TRU so do
By myself I can take you and you and you and you
Straight forward like Kerry Kittles
Nigga's head bob very little
Gooder than a whole hand full of skittles
Evil with feedback when I turn on the mic
I'm the spritz that has to "Chsssss" when you open your Sprite
No fight no war no brawl y'all ain't ready
When they see me their eyes get big arms get sweaty
Enough to go around you know exactly how it go down
In house uptown big boys throw down
Out of control ballers from Bagwood back to New Orleans
If it'll make ya feel good that's what you can call it

With niggas with them ill times are rocking
He lifts and cocked it
Suckers are toxic
I'm all about what's falling in my pocket
I'll be the one they wanna share that cock with
Your just that nigga that they wanna shock with
You never hit it told your niggas you did it
You probably ate it
Laid back and masturbated
Take them fake wood strips off the side of you ride
Cause real niggas keep their war on the inside that's money with pride
Shell shock niggas
We on the block niggas
Fiend cocked in 98
We bought more figures and triggers
We be murder murder too
So have my money or have my shit
And oh tell your little sister to stay up off my dick!
