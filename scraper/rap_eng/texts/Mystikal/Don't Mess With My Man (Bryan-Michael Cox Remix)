Find someone you can call your own
Cause, now you're walking in a danger zone (DANGER!!)
And if I touch you I'll be wrong

Whenever you ready to scoop in the Coupe
Whenever you ready to ride Jag with no roof
Big truck 22's!
And if you don't like the second apartment we could move
Do whatever you wan't but don't fool with My boo!
You can't find me cause I'm inside
Lately I can't seem to stay outside of her!
We Can't stop talking on the phone, I let her jump My bones
Ooh she let Me see her model in a thong
But all of a sudden, life 's been changing!
You've been trying to dog Me, shine on Me, Walk over Me!
All this time you was being Phoney?
I was down for you down for dollar signs only
How could you do a brother that?
After all I do for you and yours this is how you pay me back?
Don't worry about the news, that's what I got My boo for
Fuck I need you for?
SING IT!
