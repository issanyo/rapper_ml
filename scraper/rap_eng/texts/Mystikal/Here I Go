[Intro]

[Bridge]
I know y'all niggas ain't fucking with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self, here I go
I know y'all niggas ain't fucking with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self, here I go
Da man right, chea (da man right, chea)
Here I go, here I go

[Verse 1]
Y'all muthafuckers better get ready to rumble
Get in the line like a conga, plastic like plumbing
Cise on the bongo
Y'all muthafuckers ain't ready
Hey to them boys, get at them bitches and cut they ass
As sharp as a machete
Dope I don't; herbs I do
You bitches probably couldn't see me with a birds eye view
It's alive, finna make your head spin
Stop walking the one way to a fucking dead end
Bitch you yellow
Coward hearted, better bring some water
Kick the gasoline can over
Get this fucking fire started
Your heart jump like a bass drum bump
You bad enough to meet the alligator in the swamp

[Hook]
Here I go, here I go, here I go, here I go , here I go
Here I go, here I go, here I go, here I go , here I go
Here I go, here I go, here I go
The man rightchea

[Bridge 2]
I know y'all niggas ain't fucking with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
What you muthafuckers know bout rapping (what you muthafuckers know bout rapping)
Who put you on the map (who put you on the fucking map)
I know y'all niggas ain't fucking with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
Here I go - the man right, chea
Here I go, here I go

[Verse 2]
Rhyme slaying, straight suckers I'm slaying
Hoes I'm laying, niggas gon' barely stand
I got 'em laying and praying, delaying, decaying
Ask them hoes, I ain't playing with 'em
Wanna get beef, you'll have to turn your cheek
Cock back like like Mad Max and knock out one of them fucking teeth
I'm a mean, gene machine
The executioner be appeased with guillotine
My lifestyle is brutal, like a pit on a poodle
After disaster, have you sipping on chicken noodle
Get yo ass in gear, Iâ€™m getting fucked by your women
I'm the shark in the dark, bitch at night don't go swimming
Cause if you do you doomed
I'll probably be the king of the looney toons
Sweating and gasping, I'm a massive assassin
All this smashing and smashing, kicking ass with a passion
Mystikal's on a roll, just that throwed
(Ice cold)
Another nigga couldn't touch me with a flagpole
Wanna fight Iron Mike but you're too damn light
Like a knife I'll rip ya from ya ass to your appetite
Gangsta since Genesis
Fuck a (?) I'm the foreign minister, don't brag fag
Wanna battle, bring a body bag
I'm gonna need it, to carry your stupid ass
I observe, time to serve rhymes I heard like words of King George the 3rd
I proceed, to mislead the sweet hoes I cheated
Devour cause I'm sour like Johnny Appleseed
I intrude hoes call me rude, bitch I'm smooth
Watch your fucking attitude
Blast from the past, curse like I'm Mac
I'm like a black cat on the trail of a fat rat
You finna overdose
And choke off these rhymes I wrote
Somebody said that you was looking for me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm coming straight for your throat, like a coyote on a goat
Note by note, you sweat me like a ho be no, you ho
Cannot find a antidote cause when I start to flow
Murder he wrote
Huff puff and bluff, come, touch this rough stuff
And get cuffed, snuffed, buffed and scuffed
You can't hit this, get with this or witness
I'm bad tempered, I'll fuck you up with the quickness
I paid my dues, I'm bad news to fools, I choose you lose
Fuck the rules, I wreck beaucoup crews with the words I use
Got me feeling like Z.Z. Hill cause I'm screaming and screaming
And singing the blues you been child-abused
I never bled in the battle, I refuse to lose
You can bring your whole posse bitch I still won't lose
I'll stomp your whole staff, you must want a bloodbath
Fucking riff-raff, break you in half and laugh
Then snap and served you I (?) and heard you
Think about them words you heard, you fucking nerd
You tried to probably rob me, dodge me
Fucking, fighting, making money on my hobby
Freezing degrees run 'em up, shut 'em up, buttered 'em up
What up? Wanna fight? Bitch, put 'em up
How that sound come get knocked down
Bolos, I throw bitch you won't last no round
I bet let's see, what we can fuck with next
Step that ass in the ring and I'ma jab you to death
Cause I am the baddest black Prince of the South
He who run up, gon' get knocked the fuck out
Pound for pound, blow for blow we could go
If you're really looking for an ass whooping
Here I go, here I go, here I go
The man right chea
