I'm a muthafucking No Limit Soldier
It's a mystery (what)
How us young black thugs made history
We be some TRU niggas on the rise
And we gonna ball till we fall
Two shots to my dead niggas on the wall
Captain of a bunch a ghetto millionaires on the rise
And much respect like them muthafucking wise guys
TRU tattooed on my back and arm ho
And represent the south 3rd Ward Calliope

(Fiend)
I dropped on the streets
Like cocked 9's or spray painted stop signs
Niggas gettin knock down
Needles in white lines
Second lines pity crimes
Down to a gun call all from a phone call
I done been through it all
Well you forgot my name Fiend
And I don't fuck around
And soldiers show that there bowdy rowdy
When I come around
I'm Mr. Womp Womp
The one tighter than some new J's
Bout getting some to plays
That get me funky for few days

(Chorus)
We No,No Limit Soldiers
I thought I told ya
We No Limit Soldiers

(Magic)

Voted least to succeed but I'm back to let cha have it
Now I'm moving on yall can't stop the tank I'm wit
If you fuck wit me be guaranteed bitch that your head gonna split
AHHHHH shit

Respect the tank or get your ass rolled over
By this 200 & 20 lb. 9th Ward bulldozer

(Mr. Serv-On)
You bet its me the only one to spell everything out
The nigga to snatch your muthafucking neck
If you ain't got no muthafucking respect
The soldier that been holding back for years
Cause niggas scared of my motherfucking bite
P done let loosened up the straps, believe me nigga

So lower you tens if you don't respect
You know I'm from the 3rd bitch

Roundin up my soldiers, scoopin up my warriors
Mobbin with these No Limit TRU shotcallers, street brawlers
All the nigga don't fuck around
We ain't gonna tear your club up
But we gonna shut the bitch down
Lyrically I drown soldier hatas
I'm the lady alligator
Take you shake you and bake you
Split your decision maker
Wake up fire starters coming harder
Than your father's fist
Like he caught your mamma's lips around the neighbors dick
It's the same bitch

(Chorus)
We No Limit Soldiers

Muthafucker I been tight
Running from the breath fire coming from my windpipe
Bullet wounds pistol play muthafucking fist fight
Hiding in the tent with a motherfuckin chim light
There go the tank there come the round
Throwing grenade get on the ground
You might just get up without your head
You looking for trouble and that's what you found
Take a long time look around tryin to find
These niggas ain't trying to respect our minds
Shoot us, and stab us, and kick us, and cut us
But can't fuck with us when we combine
Get you everytime put your foot on the mine
Flyin metal when it highly explode don't matter how you put it
When you are telling a nigga bout me
Let it be known I'm a motherfucking soldier!
