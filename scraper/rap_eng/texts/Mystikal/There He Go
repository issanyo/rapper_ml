If you gone be down be down stay down
Get the fuck from round me
Nigga let me know if you got some type of fuckin' problem
We can solve it, wash it up and dissolve it
Up the pistol lay it down on the carpet
I ain't come here for no fuckery don't fuck with me
Niggas sly be ducking like PAC cause I'm a hoodlum like Skull Duggery
You can't get enough of me
Don't worry bout the pain bitch cause you gone die sudden
They be playin TAPS for yo ass at reveille
You ain't gone need no "do not disturb" cause you gone sleep heavenly
I'm reminess bout my baby, then I wipe my tear
Plottin revenge on one of these bitch ass nigga out chea
I done lost it; I done surpassed mad
I can't keep still cause my nerves are bad
I punch the brick wall with my balled up fist
I know I can't rest till I CATCH THAT BITCH!!!

There He Go, There He Go, There He Go

This Nigga here can cancel New Years
Cause he ain't even much gone live to see Christmas

A job well done make dick get hard
I bagged that bitch with the pistol then I walked the fuck off
Huh.  What goes around comes around my nigga
So why I'm still here I'mma hold down my nigga
This for the Gangstas and Killas, Drug Dealers and Wig Splitters
This for my niggas Locked down and all the niggas that feel us
This for the Projects and Ghettos with the scatter sight
And every street nigga thats duckin' them flash lights

There He Go, There He Go, There He Go
