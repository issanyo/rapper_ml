Listen!...Listen!...huh...Listen!

God forgive me but you can't do shit no mo'
The water ain't no good, the grass don't grow
Never mention schools ain't safe no mo'
Killing in the 1st grade six years old
Ask yo self this, In what kind of world is that to raise yo children
Then again it really don't matter, where you gone go
You still gotta live it
Let's face reality, stop talking bout peace that's a thing of the past
But then again that's a bald face lie
Cause a few years ago you was hanging my ass
??? no presidents, sometimes the whole world just pressed up against me
Think about it, young black man, come up set up for penitentary
Do the math, all on you, choose yo path,be a leader, pray for strength
Know when to cap and when to blast
Get back on track, we damn near got past crack, then every dope dealer got
Snatched back
But we already black on black, that's sad
Is it really in our nature what make it so bad
But I ain't no better then the rest of ya'll
Plus I came up in a house wit out no dad
I knew that you left, you didn't won't to
But that how it is, Lord help us, You know what we going through

Hook:

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow

Somebody tell me what you get in a relationship
With nothing but silence, silence
We ain't married so we can't get divorced
So the only thing left is domesticated violence
When a man uses a woman to take out his problems
He abuses that woman, then man must recognize this and stop it
We got two kids and you pregnant again so how can we profit
That's BULLSHIT! That ain't no reason to pull her arm out the socket
Baby I'm so sorry, you know that I luv you and didn't wanna hurt you
When I put my hands on ya, I was wrong so I don't deserve ya
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be a witness when they describe a nigga on the t.v
Now my sister flipping in the grave
Cause that's a how she died and I know this can't be me
Lord help her forgive me, God give me my purpose
Jesus break this chains, you know this a viscous circle
But I got my trust in you
I know there will be light at the end of the tunnel
I done been in many situations, she was there each and everyone of 'em
Keep me humble
I wanna take time out write down and thank ya, thank ya
Trying to make it wit out you is something we can't do

Hook:

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get us together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow

Lord tell them you difference
Between having eternal life or forever burn, burn
Lord tell em you was wit me when I had my accident
And my truck started flipping and turnin'
When it felt like I was dying from the moment of impact
We rolled ten times
I was driving my best, that fool came on my side of the line
But when the truck did finally stop moving I was just fine
My little brother that was on the passenger must of got hurt
Cause he was unconscious
We done had our tradegy's
We was just talking so this can't be happenin'
But before I could say anything else
I saw the helicopter and the ambulance
My little brother came back through, first thing he said was
"What is going on"
But the next thing he said was
"Watch over me lord and keep me strong"
And right then and there, I knew every thing was gone be alright
But we ain't promised nothing
So thank you my lord for saving his life

Hook: 2x until fade

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow
