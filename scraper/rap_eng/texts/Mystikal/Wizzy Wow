Hit them and ??? throwin' the face was like... WOW
Went to the crib and her mouth dropped like... WOW
Took off her clothes and then
OH-OH there always was trouble

Yo', this girl was so kinky like... WOW
The cranium was crazy, it made me shout... WOW
Touchin' her clothes with her hands and mean...WHILE
She got me in her carpet and sweatin' like... WOW

Phat expressin' her to my peeps, that's... WOW
Hit up my dawg on a two, he hollered... WOW

Shake your ass, won't you sleep with me now
Wiggle the middle, shake the shit up in the middle
Touch what's really simple, don't get stuck in the middle
