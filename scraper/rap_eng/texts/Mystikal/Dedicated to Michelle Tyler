Miss Michelle Tyler:  Sweet, beautiful
Intelligent, talented, creative, and
Crazy as hell.  And missed more than
Anything in the world

Thank you for being the best sister
A brother could of ever wanted
Twenty-four years.  Laughter and joy
Sure is gon' be hard not being able
To see your smile again, baby
So, I guess, I'll just hold onto
All the memories that we did share
Until we meet again

Anyway, I did it Chell.  We did it
I wish you could of been there
For the finishin' touches
But it's all good
Cause your gonna always
Be in my heart

Oh, thank you for hoopin' on
I'm Not That Nigga for me
You did that, baby.  You
Were already a angel, so
I guess your just goin' home
And, I know that heavenly
Choir sound good up there, now
They one more strong
So, you keep singin' baby
And I'm gonna keep you in my heart
And my thoughts

I love you
