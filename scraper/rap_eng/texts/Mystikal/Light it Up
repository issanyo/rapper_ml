[Intro: Master P]
(Hoody Hoo)Put this bitch on fire........
We dont need no water let the...house burn(ha-ha)

[Chorus: Master P]
Hit em up, hit em up, light em up, light em up
Get em up, hit em up, light em up, light em up
Get em up, hit em up, light em up, light em up
Get em up, hit em up, light em up, light em up

[Master P]
I wish my enemies fall, I put my name on the wall
We like to hustle and ball, see we big and ya'll small
Gimme the mic and imma tear the fuckin club up
(Hoody Hoo) Hot Boys, and girls get buck
Where you from? there they go..Who you wit? I dunno
Bout to pull a kick door, everybody on the floor
So twirk somethin nigga, Twirk somethin bitches
How ya livin fool? I got ballin in the kitchen
Ghetto star wit riches,Got gold on my dishes
20 inch when im dippin, got that thing I ain't slippin
Got a mansion when i'm dippin, call the doggs I ain't trippin
Holla if ya hear me, light it up if ya wit me(Hoody Hoo!)

[Chorus]

[Silkk The Shocker]
Yea, I did it did it..yea i hit it hit it
Got bad involed..got cash involved,yea im wit it wit it
Girls wit them (ha-ha) killas and bust ya guns
Countdown..5-4-3-2-1
Here it now, do it right now suckas get down
A bunch of thugs came in a club and told ya to get down
Last year was love, and this year's hate(Hoody Hoo)
Last year was luck, and this year's fate
Last year I was good, but this year i'm great
Last year was 7 figures, but this year's 8
N-O-L-I-M-I to the hype it up
Silkk the Shocker, yea thats me and imma light it up

[Chorus]

[C-Murder]
I hit em up, you lit em up, so get em up, what up?
Huh bro? I light it up, so you can hype it up, at the club
Show me love, we blazed to get paid, you can't faze
Cuz ahh..i'm about two steps ahead
Of the game, its a shame, how could you be so lame
But don't blame me mayne, unless you going insane
I say woah it ain't my fault, you got caught
And had to return, everything that you earned
You hadda learn, you play to follow and might get burned
You lit em up and hit em up, you shoulda waited your turn
One time, Two times, when I hype it up(what, what)
And just pass the blunt, so I can light it up.....Yeah

[Chorus]

[Mystikal]
They call me the black 12th ward prince
When I hit the stage then the whole crowd get intense
Jump the barracades, to see the man right chea, ooh shit
Them bitches fightin they way to the front, tryin to get near
Screamin and hollerin til they faint, to get a chance to touch my hand
Then again, when they get that chance, all they do is grab my pants
Pull my leg, and touch my dick, get onstage and hug me
And tell me how much they love my shit
Don't tell no lie, them niggas get amped and their hands held high
GO MYSTIKAL, GO MYSTIKAL, GO
Without me, you ain't shit, cuz the man said so

[Chorus]

[Outro: Master P]
Light em up...hit em up...believe...
Remember what you hear and half of what you see
NO LIMIT runnin this for the 2000..ya heard me?
Light it up, we'll burn it up if we hafta....
