[Intro: Trinidad James]
For all my gorgeous, healthy sisters all around the world
I'm talking the one-seventy-five and up club
The 'we cook good, we eat good, we look good'

[Chorus: Trinidad James, Lil Dicky & Mystikal]
She ain’t fat bruh, she’s just a lil thick (Watch your mouth! I know you ain’t said what I thought you said!)
She ain’t fat bruh, she’s just a lil thick (Watch your mouth! She ain’t chubby, she juicy!)
Anything them slim hoes can do, she can do it better (I’m BBW curious!)
Anything them slim hoes can do, she can do it better

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
I'm talkin' cook, clean, kids, man and swallow the dick
You never see a big ho beggin' for shit
And if you fuck her good she might buy you a whip
And if you say you love her she might pay the rent
You know I'm from Atlanta, home of Georgia peaches
Cornbread booties fill up the bleachers
I wanna kick, back up, slap, drop in her pussy
Big girl a freak, man you know that she's with me
On fleek, pretty teeth, bitch fuck being skinny
And if your nigga ain't with it then fuck being with him
And if your nigga can't hit it then hit up a nigga
I be off in that pussy like, ooh!

[Chorus: Trinidad James, Lil Dicky & Mystikal]
She ain’t fat bruh, she’s just a lil thick (Watch your mouth! I know you ain’t said what I thought you said!)
She ain’t fat bruh, she’s just a lil thick (Watch your mouth! She ain’t chubby, she juicy!)
Anything them slim hoes can do, she can do it better (I’m BBW curious!)
Anything them slim hoes can do, she can do it better

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
She just had a baby and she gained a little weight (Damn straight!)
Bye-bye size 6, 7, and 8
Humpin' a small ass and little titties is out the gate
I'm seein' her later on and she know I'm bringin' a plate
Fuck a water and a salad (Get that shit outta here)
My baby say she need somethin' on her palate
Shit, you should see the way she straddle it
She deserve Texas Roadhouse, fuck Rally's
Yeah, she might be a little round
But she look just like Beyoncé laying down
When she bend over, it's a full moon
Say girl, you gon' fuck around and turn a nigga into a werewolf

[Chorus: Trinidad James, Lil Dicky & Mystikal]
She ain’t fat bruh, she’s just a lil thick (Watch your mouth! I know you ain’t said what I thought you said!)
She ain’t fat bruh, she’s just a lil thick (Watch your mouth! She ain’t chubby, she juicy!)
Anything them slim hoes can do, she can do it better (I’m BBW curious!)
Anything them slim hoes can do, she can do it better

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
LD
Little mama got a body like the guy who got Bin Laden
Fanny on her like a potty, dancer hotter than wasabi
Got me lookin' at the bombs, titties on the Nagasaki
Gotta drop it: kamikaze, magic city, call me Copperfield
(Woah, woah, woah)
Booty flappin' like it wasn't nothin' to a ho'
This bitch named Delicious done took up an interest
I put in some wings and then tried to envision
How my dick would fit up in the pussy from the back
Over here just doin' math
I'ma need Ike Newton, Kama Sutra
Martin Luther King Jr for that booty, I can dream

[Chorus: Trinidad James & Lil Dicky & Mystikal]
She ain't fat, bruh, she's just a lil thick
She ain't fat, bruh, she's just a lil thick
Anything the slim hoes can do, she can do it better
Anything the slim hoes can do, she can do it better

[Outro: Mystikal]
Big mama, big mama, ohh, big mama
Big mama, big mama, big mama, ohh, big mama
Big mama, big mama,  ohh, big mama
Bitch, get off my foot
