[Chorus: Mystikal + Silkk]
[M] When you see that 5 and that 0 and that 4
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[S] When you see the tank swingin
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[M] When you hear them choppers cuttin
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[S] When you see that 5-0-4
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)

[Mystikal]
I keep my motherfuckin fists balled up
In case a motherfucker tryin to start somethin
You done did a little ginseng gotcha little dick hard
Now you like Hoffa
Think you gon' jump in the ring
Go pound for pound with the knockout kings
No shit like that ain't gonna happen
Them niggas down here can't touch what I bring
First time you heard the do' open
And you heard that {*open sound*} you know that's me
And you bust ya rap
Hit the mat you'll be on your back like one, two, three
Them niggas know I come off the top rope
Leave you knocked out with you mouth open
And they gon' have to take your ass home
Leave you in a hot tub soakin
BALLS BANGIN!  You know ours swingin
I ain't got to tell you nigga
Don't bother to go there you don't know who you fuckin with
I'm the flow-spitter, natural born go-getter
This is for the hustlers, ballers, cake dealers

[Chorus: Mystikal + Silkk]
[M] When you see that 5 and that 0 and that 4
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[S] And when you see them tanks swingin
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[M] When you hear them choppers cuttin
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[S] And when you see them bandanas
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)

[Silkk]
Uh-ohh, look
It's only right, it's on tonight
When I'm on the MIC; they know when to fight
When I drop, they known to bite
.. uh-huh, this is freestyle but look
Y'all can just go on and write
This is 504 livin, y'all know what it's like
That's them boyz, you see us roll up on them bikes
Chop-chop, just, like it was timber
We make it hot like July or either cold like December
(Ohhhh) Ain't my fault, I'm hot and I can still spit it this cool
Ain't my fault your girl tatted my name, get it removed
If you lookin.. then you know we ain't duckin
You know my face it ain't like my tank gon' be tucked in

[Chorus: Mystikal + Silkk]
[M] When you see that 5 and that 0 and that 4
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[S] When you see them tanks swingin
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[M] When you hear them choppers cuttin
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)
[S] When you see that 5-0-4
You know that's them boyz (that's them boyz)

[Silkk]
When you see us in the East (that's them boyz)
When you see us in the West (that's them boyz)
When you see us in the South (that's them boyz)
When you see us in the North (that's them boyz) (that's them boyz)
When we deep up in the streets
Want y'all to say (that's them boyz) (that's them boyz)

Can somebody tell 'em, I was only kidding?
I was only kidding!
