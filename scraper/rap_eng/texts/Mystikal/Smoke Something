Smoke something niggas
This one go out to all the niggas that be getting loaded
All the ladies that be getting loaded

Score it up, roll it up, blow it up
I'm bout to let you niggas know something
'fore you get mad and throw something
Bitch you better smoke something
If it's on your chest, get's rid of that mess, for the end of that stress
Nigga told me that's sess was the best, so I got's to test
It's all in the roll, fuck how you hold it
If you didn't notice that I was fucked up, y'all niggas ain't loaded
Speakin' of myself I'm just a rap writer
But before I get my nerves bad, let me go get my -- let me go get my lighter
Blaze up a swissa full of herb, shut the door, shut the window
Close the gate, get the phone out, I don't want to be disturbed
I'm on too but I'm in my own home
High as Cheech N Chong, in my own zone, smokin' homegrown
Smoke all over this motherfucker
But never would have knowed it, if I wasn't loaded
So come and take a walk with me
Get spark with me *inhales* what a brought with me
See ya'll nigga can't find this, niggas be moving in slow motion
Smokin' that  Bionic Chronic
And ain't no weed like Bo-Weed
No four like that score
I be screamin but yall know what I'm fiendin' for
Nigga you wanna know something?
Fuck the dumb shit, nigga you better smoke something
