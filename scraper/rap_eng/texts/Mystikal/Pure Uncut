Verse 1-(Silkk)

AHHHHHH! I kicks it off, nigga what rhyme wit no fuckin problem
Down wit them drama boys, an also Eightball
Understand I gotta plan, to get me some green
I stay in cruise like control, but bustaz fold like a bad poker hand
Now watch me shake this bitch up, like the dice games
See I'm always schemin tryin to get over niggas like left an right
Lanes
Different day same shit, I ain't playin bitch
Niggas still got a rusty four-five wit the same clip, an see
You can get wit this, or you can get wit that
You probably won't get wit this click, cuz um, this where the gangstaz
At
It's a real deal bitch, the real shit, there's no gimmiks
Suave House, an the 504 Boyz courtesy of No Limit, hit em up

Verse 2-(Buk)

Get down, feel the ground, shake 'em up, you down to die
Cuz we too much for the industry to handle, we Buk and Psyde
But a nigga nut wit yo five
Unluckily shit is gettin' lethal and uh
You know the drama boys, down fo life the Suave an I, to the dirt
Drama boys, wit Ball got drama that will work
Make 'em feel it, every land we hit it from Sugar to Chi
Adrenaline pumpin, ready to ride, gotta get my guys
Can't waste no time, it's first of my life and money
Now watch drama get bloody bloody, and be done doney
Gotta let you know that it's a cut and uh
And if you don't hundred guys, hundred girls gonna make you wish you
Hadn't stuttered

Verse 3-(Mystikal)

Slow down, they see me an say, THAT'S HIM
That's that bastard
An as soon as you start runnin up like it's hurtin ya
It's when I fuck ya fasta
Don't really wanna be like that, but I tear this bitch up if I have to
Shut this mutha fucka down, bend it backwards
Y'all already know where we at this is Suave House, it's like my house
An if you ain't down wit tha an No Limit, then ride out
Y'all hype done died down, it's past tense and dried out
Sparks poppin from the rhymes that's comin out my mouth
Bitch don't get mad, go get yo bags an roll wit it
Or stay the fuck away from niggas you got no business
We don't give a fuck about nothin, we untouched
One-hundred percent pure shit, uncut

(Chorus x2)

Suave House, No Limit soldiers (x8)

(Eightball)
Real playaz
Wit nothin but this uncut
(Master P)
Down south fake hataz get tossed up
(Eightball)
Ain't No Limit to the Suaveness, we bust
World wide wit this pure uncut. UGHH!

Verse 4-(Pysde)

Here goes this precocious vocalist
With the motion of locust
An leavin 'em, open as dope in their noses drove out of focus
The filthy, infected brain cells, there by the thousands
The music them hittin shown to be known to livin in project housin
Towels that ring-out, givin up on y'all boy
Y'all don't need to be fuckin wit moi boy
No Limit an Suave boy or I boy
Do something serious to you make you feel me deeper than you
Some of these bitches as cold as a Chicago at Christmas And this is
A testament, a scroll from a brain of the belligerent
Ignorant mutha fuckaz that will get high and drunk and kick it with
Inflict the sickest shit yeah for the paper, guess who after me
The non-limited and the fat mack gon cut it after me

Verse 5-(Master P)

UGHHH! Tanks and houses ride wit me
Real niggas and bitches get high wit me
I live the life of a No Limit soldier
I run wit pimps an dealaz, I thought I told ya
But we all about our piz-aper
That's why I jumped in the double R and hooked up with Tony Draper
So handle bizze at the biz-house
It's all about No Limit an that.... Suave House
Gettin paid for the diz-ounds
Worth millions cuz we all about our piz-ounds
So how ya do dat there, make 'em say UGH!
Get rowdy, get bout it

Verse 6-(Eightball)

Who is it? Big Ball payin a visit
Don't miss my exhibit, nigga I'm about to rip it, apart
Startin wit yo heart, we ain't barrin' shit
Dirty ass street nigga, stained an the scarin shit
In foreign shit, most hoes would kill to get wit
The Suave House, and them soldiers at No Limit
Niggas fear it cuz we strong and we black owned
Green or brown, we be smokin til the sack gone
Tornados flows, blow away my foes
Hurricane game, stormin on these hoes
Master P, Silkk, Mystikal an Psycho Drama
In the kitchen wit me cookin up this uncut

(Chorus Eightball an Master P's x2)
(Suave House, No Limit soldiers x16)
