[Intro]

WOOH!
Get faster babe!
Move faster!
Get faster babe!
Move faster!
Get faster babe!
Move faster!
Get faster babe!

I came here like WROOM WROOM
(Brake squeaking)

[Verse 1]
Big truck driver
Fast car rider
You hear them horses comin' what you gon' do
Get out the way, move fool!
He’s driven backwards ‘cause my pedals on the floor
When the see me PULL OVER CAUSE I THINK I OWN THE ROAD (Hey fool)
[?] to hold on tight, two hands on steer wheel sharp left and quick right
I got craving for racin’. I got Need for Speed them tires burnin' up the pavement
150 when I start to slow up
Catch me on the Interstate when I’m doing donuts, WOO

[Hook:Mystikal]
Smashing the gas, moving through the city fast as I can
Got to play how it go (that's right)
Only problem is watching out for 5-0 (Whoop Whoop Whoop Whoop)
Smashing the gas, moving through the city fast as I can (hey baby)
Ain't got time for play (Whassup?)
Ain't got time for game

[Verse 2]
I'm headed off to the sunset and the [?] and how is going down
[?] flow must fell to come on the ground
I only ride the brakes around a sexy woman (hey baby)
Cause other than that I’m gunnin' tryna touch 200
I’m in the window hair flyin' like a ....
I zip by you so you only get a glimpse
With all them hundreds of horses what I’m supposed to do
With all this power I supposed to zoom
Drive dirty cut you off if you let me
But money on this sucker you ain’t supposed to catch me
Gotta finish first that’s yeah that’s my steelo
Until my radar detector went off (Whoop Whoop) Slow down Tito!
That's the man! But there ain’t no way you catch me with those Nitrogen can
The speed's getting out of my hand (for real)
I know you want to stop me, but you ain’t got a chance! (never)

[Hook]

[Outro]
EA Sports baby (EA Sports)
[Got?] the seat belt on
Drive [?]
Don't drink and drive
You know what I'm saying
Follow the rules on the road, baby
Get faster babe!
(laugh) It is in the game
