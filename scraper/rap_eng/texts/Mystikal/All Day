[Verse 1: Trevor Jackson]
She said can I get a minute?
I told her that she got it with the Denims
She said my name Alicia
And I've been waiting all day, waiting all day
Boy I know you always get this
But I ain't like them other girls I'm bout my business
(bout 'cha business, she said)
But I still wanna picture
Cause I've been waiting all day, waiting all day

[Pre-Hook]
Sweating in the back of the club
Whoa, damn, oh my god
She looking like she wanna leave the club
I'm like whoa, now I got her
If you ready I'm ready then we can get it
Just hop in that car and then I'll be whippin'
It's your decision but baby the clock is ticking

[Hook]
Cause I ain't waiting all day, waiting all day
For you, you, you
Ain't got no time to be waiting all day
For you, you, you
It's unbelievable
For you, you, you
Either you'll have it or you wo-oh, oh-n't, oh-n't
I ain't waiting all day, waiting all day

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
She make the pimp go woah!
She make the hustlers say fuck!
She make the old school dudes say Ooo, Ohh!
She make the gangsters say damn!
Man you done seen that dick for mile you'd have been like  ohh too!
They was like who's that
I was like I don't know but bring her over here
'Bout to who's who
Tell her where the ballers at, the bottles at, the ganjas at
Holler, holler, holler, I'm tryina holler at her
Tell I'm the certified shit
I ain't gotta say shit or do shit
This bitch already know what's happening
Gonna ignore these bitches cause some of these old bitches
Jack a nigga, really go nigga my guitar I'm rapping
Flick up, flick up, need no self esteem
Push a fucking button
Or take a picture, let me know
I ain't waiting all day
Hustle up hoe!

[Pre-Hook: Trevor Jackson]
Sweating in the back of the club
Whoa, damn, oh my god
She looking like she wanna leave the club
I'm like whoa, now we're talking
If you ready I'm ready then we can get it
Just hop in that car and then I'll be whippin'
It's your decision but baby the clock is ticking

[Hook]
Cause I ain't waiting all day, all day
For you, you, you
Ain't got no time to be waiting all day
For you, you, you
It's unbelievable
For you, you, you
Either you'll have it or you wo-oh, oh-n't, oh-n't
I ain't waiting all day, waiting all day

[Outro: Trevor Jackson (Mystikal)]
(Waiting for you)
You ain't gotta lie
(Waiting for you)
Now you wanna kick it
(Waiting for you)

(Nah baby, waiting for you)
Just stop playing, I got you
(I ain't waiting all day
Hustle up ho!)
Ohhh!
