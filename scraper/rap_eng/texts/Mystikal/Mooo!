Old McDonald had a farm
I give him a titty, tryna keep him calm
I'm just tryna turn up in the country
I ain't in the city cause they ain't got lawns
Suck a nigga dick or somethin', E-I-O
Shittin' on these bitches only thing I know
Tippin' on his dick, I see the chickens and the pigs
They wanna catch us ridin' dirty with them fiends, I know

[Refrain]
I ain't a moose, bitch, get out my hay
Get out my hay, bitch, get out my hay
I ain't a moose, bitch, get out my hay
Get out my hay, bitch, get out my hay

Get out my hay, get out my hay
I ain't a moose, bitch, get out my hay
Get out my hay, bitch, get out my hay
Milkshake brings all the boys to the farm
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right, it's better than yours
I can treat you, but I have to charge
My milkshake brings all the boys to the farm
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right, it's better than yours
I can treat you, but I have to charge
