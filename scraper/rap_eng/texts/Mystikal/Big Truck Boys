(Chorus 2x)
Buckle up, boy
Don't give a fuck, boy
Me, Gillotine, Big Rock and the rest of the Big Truck boys
Leather shit with the big chrome, boy
Hit 'em with flat double barrel big strung, boy

(Mystikal)
Dont Get Caught Up with my big truck boy
Fuck Up Doggg!!
Respect My Line And Keep my shit clean
Ain't Gone Let The Big Buck Fall
White On Black Tinted Windows
With the big black dog
Nigga Slippin Bitches
Toten
Trying To Get Knocked Off
Its With the corna Shit
Sidewalk
3 6 Hard
Ain't No motherfucka know whats on my old man log
From Yall with the paint balls Horrible Dogs
Ten hut but I can pay for it fog fog
Somebody follin me in my rear view
And it probaly them lawerys
Thinkin im slanging that powder
But I ain't bout to cop no charge
Thats the pt crosier Double R no job
But I ain't got no time im bout to ride to the frayer
Hope they dont bring my shit back cause he ain't to far
If they take my shit strait over to buisness for war

Hot curds front light in the streets
Wodie wanted every small car 5 10  east

(Chorus 2x)

(Mystikal)

Pull Up the red light
Tring to watch which nigga bone get back bra
Packin towla gone rollin through town

Some white nigga tryin to be like a snake

(Chorus 2x)

(Mystikal)
Belive me niggas on 18 & 19
20 up tinted up piped up
Tank up filled up grilled up loaded siked up
Hyped up iced up polo striped up might up
They want fresh cuts they rush all like big trucks
Big house big car big dogs like big stuff
Big piano pig feet pig smoked hut hut hut
I like the to let the sun roof to let the wind blow my hair
I tured on 5th avenue boom! there them nigga's go right there
Lookin at all them guns will do harm to yo eye balls
These niggas live you might not see can the side walk
Showing off with some thing mystikal
Drip drop
He aught know being a dog he gone tag it
Looking like he gone charge at me cut
Nigga drinkin taboscian mixed with wine
Put it 1 I put em with a cat fish
Dangrous niggas having fun
Holling at q we got a show in florida
Here we come

(Chorus till fade)
