Humph, Come on

(Verse 1)
It's the nigga that get hard than starch in yo fuckin creases
Rip it to pieces
Slicin and dicin and icin em right
With the mic I use
That's as clean as a wild teacher
Eyes stay tight when they fade
To watch swarm bleedin
From out the freeza
Can't you see em? Jesus!
Big tittie Tina boppas out chea catchin Mystikal Fever
Ol you'll be sayin you ain't takin no shit this time
Nigga me neither!
You could leave nigga fuck we don't need ya
Rapper, killer, loaded, beat
Swivel, shark, butchers meat CLEAVER {*knife sound*)
A lot of you niggas believe in walkin a thin line
But when I get through wit cha all I be hearin is awwah!!
Of all maps and adages knocking off hats
Y all know
Act a ass
But don't call me that
Fix yo fuckin shirt
Tie yo fuckin shoe strangs
Jive and Mystikal comin up in the bull dagger

(chorus)
Big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever
Aaw oh, aaw oh
These niggas know, these niggas know when it's Mystikal season
Big tittie bitches catchin big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever
Aaw oh, aaw oh
These niggas know, these niggas know when it's Mystikal s fever

(Verse 2)
Keep my motherfuckin fist balled up
Case a mutherfucka tryin to start somethin
Takin ginseng got yo lil dick hard makin it harder
Think you gon jump in the ring and go pound for pound with the knockout king?
No shit like that gon happen cause them
Niggas down here ain't gon fuck wit what I bring
You heard the the motherfuckin door open
You heard that arrrr (door open sound) you know that's me
If it was a wrestlin match you'll be on your back like 1&2&3
Come off the top ropes leave you knocked out wit yo mouth open
And they gon have to take yo ass home and leave you in a hot tub and soak
Bar banga and if you don't want swang
Wit a mic I tell you nigga
I m wild ass a gorilla on chain
Time to flow wit a natural-born go getter
This for my hustlas to ballas, gangstas and cap pealers
Hustlas to ballas
Gangstas and cap pealers
Hustlas and gangstas
Gangstas and cap pealers
Hustlas to ballas
Gangstas and cap pealers

(chorus)
Big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever
Aaw oh, aaw oh
These niggas know, these niggas know when it's Mystikal season
Big tittie bitches catchin big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever
Aaw oh, aaw oh
These niggas know, these niggas know when it's Mystikal fever

(Verse 3)
I'll go pound for pound wit the knuckle cuffin motherfucka
Rush em and touch em
Then stand ova his ass and screamin I told you not to start nuthin
I'ma damage ya
You ain't got the stamina
Half the talent to match, to dance wit the tarantula
When I'ma chargin at cha
Niggas be tryin to copy cat
Wanna jump on the mic and do what I do but can't keep up
Ain't no thankin
That'shit gon change
Cause when I drop off Mystikal sound a likes
Gon have to get the fuck off
Crackin they glasses
Smashin they records
Smash and catchin they ass all day and tackle they ass
Tell em all settle shop down close fo sho
Put it down like 1990 M.C. Hammer
I hope

(chorus)
Big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever
Aaw oh, aaw oh
These niggas know, these niggas know when it's Mystikal season
Big tittie bitches catchin big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever
Aaw oh, aaw oh
These niggas know, these niggas know when it's Mystikal s fever
Big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever
Aaw oh, aaw oh

Big tittie bitches catchin big tittie bitches catchin Mystikal fever
