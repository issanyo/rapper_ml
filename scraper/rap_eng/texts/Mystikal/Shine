There we go right there, ok were on the air
Let's go

[Verse: Mystikal]
We grew up with showbusiness on our mind
In hope to make a big name
That's why me and my sister was a stiff competition
Show off when company came
Now my Lil' cousin wasn't shy see but in front of the rest of the family
Shake that ass!
Although my sister was the one with the beautiful voice
I still had to go last
Everybody waitin' on me to cut a fool so they could laugh and act goofy
I either came in the room when ain't nobody gonna see the Michael Jackson and just act stupid
But lately, me and my people ain't been havin' too many family groupin'
Or maybe, itchin' for sometimes heard a sweet melody of my baby whoopin'
You was there through the struggle
And shortcomings tryin' to reach the big picture
I'm tellin' ya
It hurt when you plan on showing somebody love and
When it's time to do it, they can't be with you
I'm feelin' guilty to tell you things been better since you been gone
Well no matter
How much you fake something and front it ain't the same when you ain't home
(Baby)
I'ma miss you forever, forget you never
But you gonna see the world through my eyes
And live what I endeavor
So, if you can see me way up in Heaven, over the clouds
You can be proud of your little brother, so look down and smile

[Chorus]
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
You're my sister, I'll always miss you
No one can get ya', 'cause God is with ya'
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
There's no other, it's from your brother
Your son and mother, 'cause we all love ya'

[Verse: Mystikal]
All the sad songs in the world
Probably couldn't express how much I miss my baby
I just thank God that I had a big sister
The 29 beautiful years that he gave her
Even the days when I misbehaved
And I knew she was gonna get that belt to pop me
I could see the aggravation in your face when
My momma said that they had to watch me
“Michelle, if you go somewhere, take Michael with you”
Know what that meant
All up and down I was gonna try to find out how your time gonna be spent
'Cause I was too hard-headed
Everywhere you said “Don't go”, that's where I went
Always flipping, jumping around like a jackass
Somewhere climbing a fence
Bring me my Rocking Robin, my double dutch bust
She had some songs to sing for us, we had some name brands to discuss
Plus, I want to tell her I was sorry for leaving the toilet seat up
And not cleaning out the tub, and leaving peanut butter and jelly
And drinking out the Kool-Aid jug
I pissed you off, burned you up
When you told me: “Cut that music down”, I turned it up
Bickering conflict cuss each other out is how we showed our love
You was my flesh and blood, we was brother and sister
And it meant so much
Now I'm doing it, you supposed to be here
We supposed to be writing songs together
I'm telling ya', that girl tore talent shows up
With old Tina Marie records
What you left us with, never be in vain
You gonna be shining, and they gonna know your name
Too many damn things left unexplained
But since you was an angel down here
Then an angel there you shall remain
And that's always until my time
You're my strength, you're my light
Shine

[Chorus]
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
You're my sister, I'll always miss you
No one can get ya', 'cause God is with ya'
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
There's no other, it's from your brother
Your son and mother, 'cause we all love ya'

Shine on, shine on
'Cause we do miss you
There's no other like you

Shine on, shine on
'Cause we do miss you, oh you

Oh yeah, oh, ohh (Oh, oh, yeah)
Oh yeah, oh (Huh-uh-uh, come on, yeah)

Oh yeah, oh, ohh (Oh, oh, yeah)
Oh yeah, o-oh-oh-oh (Huh-uh-uh, come on, yeah)

Oh yeah, oh, ohh (Oh, oh, yeah)
Oh yeah, oh (Huh-uh-uh, come on, yeah)
