(feat. Mystikal)

I dont know, if im the one you should be stepping to right now
Your so-called man, he came up to me and he wanted to know my name
Slowly he proceeded, to kick a little game to me
Thats when you came up in my face, but now its time to check your place, yeah
He doesnt really care for you, he's out for me
Why can't you see it ain't me
You better get it right, im not tryin to fight
But if I have to I will, yeah I think I might
If you really want somebody to make a fool of you, baby girl
Walks around like she has no clue
Youre talking to the wrong one about this mess
So why even bother when I couldn't care less
Tell me why your man keeps stalking me
Call me on the phone, keeps paging me
You know he's doing wrong, why you talk to me
If thats your man, check your man
Heard about the things that he do to you
Youre up in my face what you wanna do
I can take it there if you want me to
If thats your man, check your man
If he's your man, then why the hell are you walking up on me
Need to check him out, cause im a lady not a girl who will put up with your mouth
Still im trying hard now, to keep my sanity
But see im not about to start up a fight over some silly situation thats long gone
You better get up out my face before I make a scene, see the trick is on you
You better get it right, im not tryin to fight, but if I have to I will, yeah I think I might
If you really want somebody to make a fool of you, baby girl walks around like she has no clue
Youre talking to the wrong one about this mess, so why even bother when I couldn't care less
Im out of time for crazy games, theres no need for you to try, and run up on me
(Mystikal rap)
Look I debuted beatin' boy bands, go on lil' daddy
Number one for over seven months 'Shake It Fast'
But if that coochie cheesy then take a bath
That funky cat girl can't do nothing but make me mad
I get it started for ya as soon as I getcha
Cos I know that you've been waiting for me
Now tell those other supposed to be
Sorry ass rappers, look I'm here ya'll can go
You mothersuckers need to shut up before you get shot up
Look I'm bout to tear the spot up
I see your mouth don't lack or quit
So if you see me and Nivea sitting together
At the awards don't say shhhhhh
You're mad with me cos it's over
Callin' Nivea's house playing on the phone
Yeah I know ya
Stop that frontin' all that fakin'
I'm hittin' it till she can take no more
Playa why you hatin'?
