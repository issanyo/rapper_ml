[Hook: Mystikal]
Nigga that's that bullshit, nigga that's that bullshit
They got me fucked up, right now on that bullshit
Nigga that's that bullshit, nigga that's that bullshit
Got us fucked up in here on that bullshit
Nigga that's that bullshit, nigga that's that bullshit
Got us fucked up out here on that bullshit
Nigga that's that bullshit, that's that bullshit
They got me fucked up, right now on that bullshit

[Verse 1]
Same nigga hump the beat like a pussy
Fuckin' right I put the dick on the track
Same nigga he just got outta jail
Same nigga that's 'bout to go back
So what the rapper got 90 more days?
Should have never hit that bitch in the head
I know she pushed you and you probably felt played
Better next time you gonna walk yo ass away
Get yo shit together, nigga get yo mind right
Every nigga in here smarter than Albert Einstein lookin' at it from hindsight
Hope this shit starts sankin in before it's a cell you be stankin in
No bitches, no titties, no pussy prints tell my why the fuck you wasn't thinkin' then
I said, "uhhh." The judge say, "'Uhhh' my ass!"
Tell yo people how much that you miss 'em and you love 'em talkin to 'em from behind that glass
Hello Canteen Line, I plan about five racks
Lemme get that in coffee and hygiene, stamps and bugler packs
You're mad cause I'm movin' fast, so you're usin' that
Now you're out here talkin' shit, but bitch I'm used to that
Bitch, I never give up
I said I'll never go back
But judgin' from the way the ball done bounced
I might get to see my nigga Mac

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tryna do me like a low-down dog
Treat me like a hen-pecked freak
A mother like a one legged gimp
Or something like a four-eyed geek
Cause you up in there huffin' and puffin'
Talkin' 'bout I lie and cheat
Bitch I want you outta my house
She said I want you off these streets
Damn! Hold up, sorry baby. Ain't gotta be all that
You know how much I love you. Don't do nothin' crazy
No man, you you ain't gettin' no panties
You might as well pack yo bags
In court, standing next the DA
My brother can't you hear me like kiss my ass
Say goodbye to those shows, and peace out to those beats
Tell 'em how I got you out the truck
Yeah nigga hand over those keys
There you go, take it baby
It's yours darling
Turn the motherfucker sideways
Stuff that bitch where you sit on the toilet
'Scuse me speakin' in tongues
But she forgot about the Charger
I know I shouldn't have never bought the Charger
Now that bitch got me facin charges
I guess it go like that, and it be like that
Momma said knock that lightweight out
81 days you gon be right back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bitch you tryin' to swing below the belt, ho you tryin' to hit behind the knee
If this were Silence of The Lambs, our troubles would be over. Popo Clarice
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Fly, fly, fly
I repent if you think that this is gonna be the end of me bitch you's a goddamn lie
Hey there mike mike mike man, now that you're my my my
Seen Daddy get off probation, when the restraining come off, I'd love to see y'all come by
Daddy gotta go through the joint just to get to the door
Daddy gotta climb over these hoes just to make it back home to the toil
Now we know that big girls don't pout, and big boys don't cry
Y'all better not fight in this bitch and cry, y'all play nice
Do just as I say, but not as I do
In the house, you start fuckin' up, guess what? I'll whoop your lil bad ass too
