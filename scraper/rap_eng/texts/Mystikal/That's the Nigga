Say, KL, we gon' lay up there and kick this bitch raw
Ya heard me?
Like some of that old Parkway shit, nigga

Microphone check (check), check one
Microphone check (check), check two
Microphone check (check), check three
Microphone check (check), check four
What y'all niggas wanna do, how y'all wanna do it?
Check, check, check one
Kick this shit raw

They say, that's the nigga
That's the nigga (7X)

Turn your head towards your ass and say bye bye
From the southside, southside, puff, ya ya ya
Nothin but the Fi-Yi-Yi
Eardrums snatchin champion
Chief Rhyme Buster till the day I die
I say I lie
Bitch I'll be fuckin on your grave singin ay la ba
I'm throwed off
I'm two scoops, I'm cuckoo
I crew screw your Froot Loops, poo poo in your Fubu
Yall niggas remember what happened to that mosquito
Tweety tweety MC, sweetie I'll read ya meter
Stop your water turn off your gas cut off your lights
Move you out, cut your grass, watch your kids, fuck your wife
Like a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich I'm good
Mm hmm, like syrup on the biscuit and orange juice puddin'
Come and take me by the hand and walk ya
I'm the thief in the night that slide your draws off ya
Watch where ya steppin I'm a verbal weapon
Bring more pain then when John Wayne came on old westerns
What is the actual fuckin meaning
I come in this bitch, when I leave out this bitch this bitch be leaning
It's been like that since way back
I used to rock 8 track before I rocked ADAT
Concepts going stay fat, concerts goin stay packed
Ownership's goin stay black, nigga this is payback
I scraped and scruffed and crawled until I'm established
Now I'm country club livin from the scribble scrabble in my tablet
Proper proper droppin somethin decent
Yall niggas is as fucked up as Santa Claus for Easter
I'm a keep comin as long as KLC keep drummin
And the only way to stop me is call the people for me
Fuck them people, I'll fuck over you if I have to
That's the nigga, that's that bastard

That's the rapper (15X)
Ghetto fabulous
That's the nigga (8X)

Who dat what they say they can't sell, boy?
They the 3rd ward huh, the 12th ward
For yall I rock all of my pauses by heart
Guitars on these boys and get down and go off
All sides get high when they ride to my words
They mine and they high when I'm live in concert
Stop what your thinking
This ain't no show 'less I'm up in it
I don't need nine or ten niggas rappin' with me
I'm independent, make frontin, stuntin suckers lose thier stomach
They lose their clout, their cool
And after I come in the cut they lose thier woman
Hello, ghetto fabulous!
Big mansions and fine fabrics
Like a man, my money and my pussy come automatic
You don't want no static with a hardcore rhyme fanatic
Full speed head addict, vocabulary acrobatic
That's him, that's that rapper
That's the man, that's the nigga
That's that bastard

That's the nigga(5X)

What is the actual fucking meaning?
