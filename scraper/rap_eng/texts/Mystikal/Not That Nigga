[Verse 1]
I'm not really the type of nigga to play the gangsta
Cause you's probably coolin'
But straight off the motherfuckin breast
I ain't comin for no foolishness
100 volts on the mic kept knowin' (?) then I'm probably chillin'
Tilt that crazy off bottle 'til I'm blitzed
Look-a here nigga yall know that feelin'
But I ain't that type of nigga to shoot the shit if you on my shit list
But I'm that type of nigga that's quick to handle my business
Im makin' a run with shit that I've done
Im wavin' a gun at shit that you've brung
Make niggas get brung strung and hung with the slip of a tongue
I unfold a truck-load as I explode
You bitches can't hold the side-door when I'm in my front-load
Im keepin'em (??) I'm keepin'em hype
I'm leavin'em right I'm even uptight
Holdin' the mic and say the word FUCK more times then Dolomite
I'm the nigga that got the last words you got served
Smokin' fat herbs and gunnin' niggas down like black birds
With fast words, observe I'm funky like raptures
But I'm much much more then a mouth full of adverbs and bad words
Stick dick to your lips like chop sticks
My (?) I rock with with
More paid well no fade but bout colder than a cub of Kool-Aid
It never been done before so nigga then why try
Hittin' harder then Popeye slappin' motherfuckers like Cha-Cha
I fuck with a capitol "F" put (?) to death (??) crowd def
And I'ma continue to flow until I come up on my last breath
So homie raise up (OH!)
Hold these tricks up (OH!)
See I'm that nigga that tells whether or not a nigga stay now look here

[Hook: Mystikal & Michelle Tyler] (x8)
I'm not that nigga
I'm not that nigga
I'm not that nigga to fuck

[Verse 2]
You'll get picked off
Keep fuckin' with a nigga like me get hip-tossed
Fuck fightin' fair get every nigga I know
And jump your bitch ass like Kriss-Kross
And look at a riddle that I belittle
When I'm a jumbo now a fiddle
I jump in your eardrum and play (?Baradiddle?)
Stop wanting to ditch'em
I'm in this bitch and comin' out rich
In case yah haven't noticed I'm 'bout a foul mouth son of a bitch
Inch by inch as I drench
I'm a sense clench
That bullshit that yall niggas throw is equivalent to the pain of a pinch
I got the gimmick to make them bitches bounce like DJ Jimmy
They can't get near me cause they fear me but yall don't hear me
It's like that bitch I saw
Who hit my fucking car
Look-a-hear, I ran that ho from Chippawa to Witchita
I'm steady for 'fessin, so niggas can kick this funky lesson
I'm effervescent as a fluorescent from that fuckin' crescent
A nigga that know how
Making them bitches say, "Go Child"
Poppin' that pussy and shakin' that ass just like they at a luau
So come with the pussy the paper the pen and the pussy now pass me the mic
Show you around jump on yo' ass just like a (???)
I shot more shit than Shawn Kemp but got more bitches than a world pimp
And got more flavor than a brown shrimp
I'ma be comin' up on some shit that make a nigga wanna talk some shit
But if you ain't brought shit
Then I ain't the nigga to start shit with

[Hook]

You couldn't fuck with the old but all of a sudden what make you think you can fuck wit the new shit
You stuck on stupid
I ain't that nigga to fool with
A nigga might sprout up talkin' about what
The only way to keep my muthafuckin' name out your muthafuckin' mouth
Is keep your muthafuckin mouth shut
I don't step (?) fire then a gutter
I'm takin'em 10 at a time cause I ain't SCARED of you muthafuckers
I'm strippin'em up
I'm rippin'em up and flippin'em up
And just to continue to flow on rhymes I single and double and triple'em up
Making passes
See massive titties and pussies and asses
But got more hoes than the Bayou Classic
More vicious then BooBoo wash you up like we do
I'm blacker then Voo-Doo, harder than a raw Ramen noodle
Black like Sheep, I'm Cool like Jay in effect like Rex
I'm Grand like Pub huh, huh daddy how you?
I'm Ice like T, rock like Kim fuck it
Spice like One but got more Enemies then the Public nigga
I kick it at random standing and dumpin until the band come
Bitchin and pitchin a temper tandrum, to the hand drum
The bigger opponent nigga that flow
You can't compare a nigga like Mystikal to Skidrow or Ugly Kid Joe
But yet you steadily pickin dirt with me
You irkin' with me you jerkin' with me now  tell your bitch to stop flirting with me
Im (?) as a man I'm strong as a fan belt, I can't melt
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
I'm making em mumble as I utter
Nigga you beating me is like cuttin' a field of grass with wire cutters I
Get deeper than Lou Rawls Im breakin em off
Inatead of fuckin' with me you faithful walk in a lion's den with pork chop drawers
I'm ready to graze and blaze pump up the gauge and pick up the pace
I'm more deadly then having safe sex, with a bitch with AIDS
A nigga like myself is bad for your ho health
I fucked that bitch one time and now that ho can't help herself
That shit be kicks and niggas be smokin' in cliques and fuckin'em tricks
I rollin' from that Big Easy
Where the buddha B-yotch? and niggas they rumble, over the least mumbo-jumbo
Standing taller than Mutumbo but talkin more shit than Briant Gumble
That's how we do it when we kick it back on my block
It's pop or get popped
Kill or get killed
Drop or get dropped
And niggas be wondering why they always finding themselves in some dumb shit
Cause I ain't, cause I ain't, cause I ain't that nigga to fuck with bitch

[Hook]
