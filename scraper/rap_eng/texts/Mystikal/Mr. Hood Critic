[G-Quikk]
It took a nigga thirteen muthafuckin' years just to make a rap song
But I'm on my winnings, in fact now niggas is jealous
Y'all niggas don't faze me
Hoes gone...hate me
Bust up and then I may get they lips bloody
Your back nutty
Aw, y'all niggas ain't ready for me
But if you want me, who clamps?
I'm shell-bound, watch me throw down on my first go-round
Here's our shit, properly did it and now you're evicted
Now admit it, fuck that yin-yang, you talkin' behind my back Mr. Hood Critics
You're all on my dick hun
Get one, lick one
Shit son, talk about me?  Jealous man, you're done
Fuck it, it's all good
I'm not that nigga, I'm not that nigga, I'm not that nigga either, understood?

Chorus [Mystikal & G-Quikk]

[G-Quikk]
You're all on my dick hun

[Mystikal]

[Mystikal]
Only way to keep my muthafuckin' name
Out your muthafuckin' mouth
Is to keep your muthafuckin' mouth SHUT!

(x4)

Second Verse [G-Quikk, Mystikal, & J-Dawg]:

[G-Quikk]
Roll like a tank
Comin' cold like a shake
Every move that I make
Be smooth like a, snake
I got what it takes to make your eyes burn
Hooked up in the jazzy fifth, with the pee-wee sideburns
I dress better than a drug dealer
Cuz when I jump shop I'm on my job nigga
20/20 couldn't see me

[Mystikal]
Who you?

[G-Quikk]
Q to the U to the I to the K, K, I be......

[J-Dawg]
Follow me now, open sesame
You niggas ain't ready for the best of me
I'm takin' you niggas nuts and givin' you bitches a hysterectomy
I'm comin' up fast, runnin' in more ass
Sharp as glass
Bitch you might think this nigga be lickin' the pussy cuz my tongue fast
Hoe, but that's a no-no
Oh, you mean you don't know?
Mr. Hood Critic told you what?  I'm lickin' pussy on the down-low?
Now if I'd did it, I'd admit it and walk around proud
But tellin' no fables, on this label, pussy eaters ain't allowed
Now I be comin' around the mountain like "Oh Susanna"

[Mystikal]
Nigga where the fuck you from?

[J-Dawg]
New Orleans, Louisiana
Home of the boot camp clicc
And now it's time for rest of you muthafuckas
To bow down and respect the South shit
Get your mouth split
That's what thing that you can do up with this chemistry
The Boot Camp Clicc is droppin' bombs on the industry

[G-Quikk]
You all on my dick, hun

[Mystikal]
Mr. Hood Critic, the only way to keep my muthafuckin' name
From out your muthafuckin' mouth
Is to keep your muthafuckin' mouth SHUT!

[G-Quikk]
G's oh, G-Quikk's a G so
Want me to creep these hoes?  I'ma keep these hoes
On they tippy-tippy toes
Shovin' that dick all in your daughter
Called a nigga, fucked a nigga
Sucked a lil' dick

[Mystikal]
BUT CAN'T GET A QUARTER!!!!!

[G-Quikk]
I'm not your everyday extraordinary busta
Another soldier out that boot camp
Bustin' you dick suckers

[Mystikal]
From walkin' round town tryin' to call Michelle
Hit slow like shit you jump now nigga

[G-Quikk]
Ain't nothin' colder, ain't nothin' cooler...
Ooh!  Don't let the smooth ice fool ya

[Mystikal]
Cuz I ain't that type of nigga to get my...
