Now let me tell you that I caught you
My dear, my dear, my dear
You do not know me
But I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I caught you

Talk to me, tell me, where you were
Late, last night
Ya-you told me, you were with your friends hanging out
Late, last night
Ya-you're lying cuz you're stuttering
Now where were you?
Late, last night
Stop lying to me cause you're ticking me off
See you're ticking me off, ooh

Watch yourself

Quit your lying heffer
Watch yourself heffer

[Joe]
Listen
I called you on your cell phone
No answer, tell me why
So I paged you on your two way
Still no response, tell me why
I took care of you, I love you
And you played me, tell me why
Stop lying to me about where you've been
Cause you're ticking me off, tick-tick-ticking me off

Repeat 2 (4x)

[Mystikal]
Quit your lying heffer, watch yourself
Yeah, I'll give the whips but leaving you out here by yourself
I'm keepin' it gangsta with all the tattoos and platinum mouth
I was the rapper you heard about strappin' up in the waffle house
Right next to niggas when I be sparkin' 'em out
And I'm way too cold to plain let you come and dog me out
Should've of knew what you was up to when you got here
Get off my couch, get
And I just can't change it
It's gonna be good
Get out on ya route
My bad, you're out
I seen it coming with that nappy hair
She was running docked out wanting what you had
You let him set you up and you fell for it
Now it's "I-I-I'm sorry, my a--!"
That's why you're paying for it
You got the garbage, I got the trash can for it
The man ain't gon stand for it
You better respect my flow
Don't be stuttering when you're talking to Mystikal
Or lying when you be talking to Joe

[Joe]
I smell cologne damn it's strong
How did ya get it on?

He messed up your hair
Make-up's every where
Ooh yeah I'm not dumb
Girl you're crying cause you're lyin'
To my face, I'm not dumb
Stop lying to me about seeing a man
Cause you're ticking me off
