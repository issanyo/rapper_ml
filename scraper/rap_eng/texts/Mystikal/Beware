Intro:
(Mystikal saying "Beware" played backwards)

First Verse:

BEWARE!
The man with the braids done walked in
Mild mannered like Clark Kent
I'm rougher and tougher than dead shark skin
This man gonna be have you flippin' like the blades of a propeller
Evil like Cruella
Five years later I'ma still be hard as a armadillo
Roll like a eighteen wheeler
Shinin' like the slipper of Cinderella
And bad weather
And a capella
This fella
Top seller
Gon' be that way til' I'm old as Mandela
Still gettin' better
Writin' rhymes under pressure
I'm the aggressor, I'm the professor
I'm the nigga that keep his picture on your girlfriend's dresser
Now really
Tell me what you muthafuckas know about gettin' rowdy
Turn your whole Sunday day cloudy
Bitch, I been 'bout it
Now, I kick the rest of you into HASH
Bow, Grasshopper
Bow, to the man

Chorus

Second Verse:

I bet'cha, bet'cha I'm best that I'm better
Letter for letter
Swift as a jet or keep up with the pacesetter
Sparkle like glitter, hard-hitter, hoe go-getter
Side-stepping from no nigga
Whenever you bitches decide you gonna get too big for your britches
Leavin' you stitches
Diggin' in ditches
Sufferin' hickeys, cuts, scrapes, bruises, welts
Don't fuck with the rhymin' black belt
Watch yaself
Boom! Here I go!
Boom! Boom! I know
Y'all niggas can't fuck with the man with two tongues, cuz that's the way I flow
Cuz I can get hot like fire
And you can't put it out, it's like tip-toein' on top of barbed wire
For instance, persistance
No resistance, stay your distance
Is vital to your existance
You leave it to me to show you the way out
I'm never gonna play ya
I'll take your old lady
Even if I took my braids out

Chorus

Third Verse:

And I'm uh, ready, and it looks like all you bitches are rusty
Y'all can't buss me, don't cuss me
Hit'cha, so much muthafuckin' we gone leave this bitch musty
You disgust me, trust me
When Mystikal hits the door
You bitches be screamin' to touch me
I'm the invisible man you can't see me
I'm like an illusion and confusion
I'm abusin', your conclusion, and contusions, from the bruises
Issuin' these muthafuckas with the style that them bitches want
Five-foot-eleven, screamin' and yellin'
I say fuck, shit, got damn
Bitch respect me like a reverend, and...
Congregation say "Amen"
(Amen)
I come through this muthafucka swingin' like a caveman
And just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water
(Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun)
Up jumps the shit-starter
From the rafters
The mornin' after
Since you won't bow to the man
Bow to the master!

Chorus
