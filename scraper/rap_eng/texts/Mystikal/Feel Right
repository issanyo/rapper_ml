[Verse 1: Mystikal & Bruno Mars]
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Mystikal!
Calling all cars in here, for the Prince of the South
Fuck that yabba-dabba-doo shit,bitch, I just got out
Still rappin', slappin' kittens, and grabbin' my cock
I'm the artist, the godfather, still hard as a rock
You gon' fuck around, and make me knock your fruit juice loose
Banana, your watermelon and pomegranate too
Rhymin' kung-fu, that split bamboo
Crowd rockin', ain't no stopping that rapping ass, fool
I been bad, bro, 'cha getting mad for?
I'm gon' have to fuck you up!
I eat flames up, shit fire out
Don't make me light my butt!
Excuse me, who me!? I got a lot of groupies
Oughta have a fucking doghouse, like Snoopy
Curtains go up! It's going down!
Tear the thing out the frame, with my band!
Come on, come on

[Chorus: Mystikal & Bruno Mars]
Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
Mystikal, don't hurt 'em now!

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Grabbin' at my pants, she trying to pull it out my pocket
Don't yank on the motherfucker so hard, you're gonna pull it out the socket
It's exercise, with thighs and hip muscles
Next exercise, we gon' burn some lip muscles
Let the music work your ear muscles
And if you're skinny, then use your little muscles
Bag back, or tea bag with these duffles
Pow pow, get smash when we hustle!
When the last time you have a knuckle sandwich, huh?
The last time, a nigga had a foot so far up your ass, you couldn't handle it?
You can't stand it! To make matters worse
You gotta go to the studio with Bruno Mars, on another planet
Don't get mad, I'm just saying'
Don't believe it, cause I'm sayin' it, bitch
Believe it, cause I'm telling you
I'm doin' the rappin', and bussin'
Ronson! On the scratchin' and cuttin'

[Chorus: Mystikal & Bruno Mars]
Feel right, in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good, in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood, in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
Feel right, in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good, in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood, in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
Get down!
Wait a minute now
Give it to them on the one

[Bridge: Mystikal]
This the intermission
I'll break it down, so you niggas listen
Take a second to wipe my sweat
Might be the only chance you get, to catch your breath
Don't get too comfortable in here
Niggas know I'm bringing back the rumble in here
Just when you thought you could cool down, and sip some of that water
Shit.......A nigga back!
Say it again!

[Chorus: Mystikal]
Feel right, in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good, in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood, in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
Feel right, in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good, in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood, in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)

[Outro: Bruno Mars]
Ladies and gentlemen, one more time
Put your hands together for Mystikal
Don't it feel good?
Ain't he making us feel good tonight?
Thank you Mr. Ronson, for bringing us together this evening
We gon' go ahead, and head over to the after party
We'll see y'all uptown
Come on
