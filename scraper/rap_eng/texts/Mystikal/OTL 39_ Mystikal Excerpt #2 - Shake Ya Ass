SameOldShawn:  And I would be remiss, while I had you in the room, if I didn't talk to you about "Shake Ya Ass."  I'm sure you're talked out about it...

Mystikal:  Not really.  I mean, that was the biggest song of my career

SOS:  Is there something you've never said about making that song, or something about it, or a line in it or anything?

M:  I know, if it was my choice to put it out as a single, I wouldn't have wanted to do it, because I didn't think it represented me as, you know, lyrically the way I would want to be represented.  Once they put it out there, they definitely proved me wrong.  So, okay.  I've been wrong before
