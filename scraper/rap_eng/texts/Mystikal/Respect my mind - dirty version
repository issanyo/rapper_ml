Fuckin right I'm hip-hop
I hoe hop, I'm funky as a pair of Reeboks with no socks
I'm hot like a nigga ? the beef to the beers with no brats
I'm tight like them twistin up under the 6 with no top
I've been up all night
Writing like a motherfucker cluck with no clock
Been platinum and I'm still stompin
Rock jam-packed concerts and bitch filled parties
Done had them standin more than a hot comb when I perform
Gotta em feelin like they in Saigon when they hear what I got
I got funk
No Limit legitimate respect the man of power
I turn your motherfuckin thunderstorm into scattered showers
Yo Bam, bitches can't get down
Like me and the Pound can, we ain't gotta bring up SoundScan
I come into focus when they all starin
I turn your fuckin head and, spin your fuckin ball bearings
Hit the antenna so they all scatterin
Believe that cause I'm tellin you
They don't challenge what they can't handle
M-Y-S-T-I
Smoke spinach, eat chicken, shit bullets, SPIT FIRE
I'm above you like the sky
Like the clouds like the Gods like the birds and the pilots
You know why I'm here, come to say it loud
For the one-thousand nine-hundred and nine nine
To infinity and BEYOND
Now.. now.. now.. now.. bitch
Respect my motherfucking mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you think
Bitch I kill you
Respect my fucking mind
Fuck what you think, fuck what you feelin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my mind
Fuck what you think, fuck what you feelin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my fucking mind
Bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you
I said BITCH I KILL YOU
Back-bending, That's That Nigga spinning
Y'all done feeling my line before I finish my SENTENCE
This microphone's for holdin
I don't give a fuck, as quick as you bring them niggas
Then that's how fast them niggas get FUCKED OVER
No prisoners at no time
I'm so advanced I put your ass in the blender
With my OWN rhyme, bitch say, "Damn that nigga tight!
I heard what he did to that other rapper that other night
And Dawg that shit wasn't right!"
I'm nothin nice in the shinin lights
No band, no choir, just me and my fucking Nike's
But am I missing something? FUCK NO
I got the whole crowd bucked up, "UH OHHH!"
I smash a rapper into smithereens
Make him spill his beans
Then I'm running with the guillotine
Diss on my rhymes bitch and diss on my records
Diss on my moms bitch you gon' respect it!
Respect my fucking mind
Fuck what you thinkin, fuck what you feelin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you thinkin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you thinkin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my fucking mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you thinkin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my mind
Bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you
Respect my fucking mind
Bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you!
