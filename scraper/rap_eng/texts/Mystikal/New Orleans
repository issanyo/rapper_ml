[Hook: Gudda]
East side, west bank
Downtown, up town
Better have a pass when you’re coming down to my town

I’m from the city where the skinny niggas die
A dope fiend will kill you for a motherfuckin high
So if you’re getting money, better keep it on the low-low
Other they’ll come to get it, niggas shooting like a photo
New Orleans nigga, I’m a New Orleans nigga
I’m from New Orleans, niggas
East side, west bank
Up town, down town
Better have a pass when you’re coming down to my town

[Verse 1:Gudda & (Thugga)]
(I’m from the side of the city where I don’t represent no other
I was looking for my dog, he was fucking with that boy. Pause.)
All my niggers running with them toys, handgun
Got the silencer, chopper making noise

(East side, east side, pistol on to my prom, bitch
These young niggers be wiling, ever since that storm hit
Keep it on my side like a fucking phone club
My name is trans-genderous, you pussies get that long dick.)
Aka that long clip, you could get your dome hit
It’s busy on the first of the month, we on the bone shit
Murder cappin but we’re murder happy, turn beef to a burger patty
(This dope fiend try to get credit, saying no, bitch, i don't take debit.)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Flow]
Bitch, I’m from the up town where we took gas
You niggers ain’t have no hope there
You and Mike can read it right, but I bet you know where that dope is
Better know where that coke is, them xans, them percs at
Them Surp at, that yurp at, fuck around and get mur-dead
Same spot when I bang shots, kill the light with a slang shot
That nigga daily, that nigga crazy, he skip that eye into the next stop
Hold drugs in tank tops, smoking on some stank pipe
Fold perks and I own some snack, just to make my plane stop
I’m so up town and I can’t stop, I’m so up town that my vein stop
I’m so up town, I’m so up town, bitch, I’m so up town that my frame drop
Yeah, keep on thinking New Orleans’ sweet, Mardi Gras and been here
This shit get real up in the field, you better duck when you hear the keys

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
Nigga I don’t give a shit if you’re sitting by a motherfucking nigga
Got a nigga loving from the hate
Ask to be a man, not a mouse
Then fuck you in the motherfucking chest
Up town nigga near, boss
Down town over that clown
West nigga leaving that stage
They used to brag of the heat
Who wants niggers up in their streets
Fucking about the laws and peace
Such a ho, looking for him in the day time
Your mama lie for you “he’s asleep”
No, nigga, you ain’t shit
Like I’m from under them sheets
Nigga, leave no shoes
Now get your ass in the gym
But I told ‘em no talk, don’t tear
I should die for your help
Now I got a ticket for a ride
Woke up on my god damn self
Got ‘em, got ‘em, clean ‘em
Stab ‘em, rock ‘em, lean ‘em
Win it, ask about it
Tell ‘em I ain’t seen him
On a devil’s introduced to my name
I wanna transpire you between them
‘cause I heard niggers lying in a demon
I was out of town, but my nigga guillotine them
That’s my fucking story, and I’m sticking to it
Told you what happens, I fuck all the acting
Nigga, don’t put it, now shut up

[Hook]
