Nigga, that's like somebody who ain't
Got no f*ckin' money tryin' to say somethin' to "P"
It's like y'all niggas goin' to learn - to learn with "E"
Y'all niggas act like ya go to job interviews
And come and try to f*ck with our beans
Oh no, you don't go, go there, fool!
That nigga said what? Oh ah, hell no!!
Still hot, just thought I'll tell y'all
Bitches suckin' dick if they thought it fell off
Like a man-stare, hundred-twelve floors
When they want the fire I'm the one they'll call
Your Record Company's Stores' fallin'
I'll pick that bitch up, put it on my back and start walkin'
Hit the car, start coughin'
Shoplifter get off, I'm bustin' the dodger
I'll B&B y'all from N.O. to L.A

I better go complete, tie to put together rap DEAD on the beat
Don't beg for my weed, don't step on my feet (step on my feet)
Don't pull out my prenium, messin' with my trailor
Lookin' my women, don't f*ck with my jeep
My coban motherf*ckers, can never be chuckin' no beef
Y'all niggas still can't f*ck wit' me and would not compete
I'm out the box, off the HEAT!!
Proper prop-lock up blocks with much shit, drop shit
Jaws and break bones with my shit-song
And it's on with rhyme-stones, styles gon' be shown
And I'm known, bring it home, an' home on microphone
It don't say my name on it, so, cause they know I'll be comin' for 'em
