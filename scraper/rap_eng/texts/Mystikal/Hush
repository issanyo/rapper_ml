Mystikal talking:

Now look baby
If I kick it with you like that
You can't  be runnin your mouth and stuff
Cause you know what time it is
You know what's happening
You gotta keep it on the under
Nawl im sayin can you handle that?

Chorus: (Mystikal)

Can you keep a secret?  Hush, Hush
Shut your mouth, it's just between us
Can you keep a secret? Hush, Hush
Don't say nothing, it's just between us
Can you keep a secret? Hush, Hush
Don't tell nobody, cause this is just between us
Can you keep a secret? Hush, Hush
Shut your mouth, don't say nothing

Verse 1 (Mystikal):

If we gonna peep it, we can keep it
She don't know that we creepin
Just beep me, when you be tweaking
And I give it to you whenever you need me
However you want it, call on me, I'm all on it
I'm all over it, but I ain't gotta tell you cause you already know it
Forget what you feelin', cause we gotta keep in check
If we gotta be on the cool, look and respect
Beside me like whenever we met
You know what you feelin'
It's on you but keep that bitch out of our business
I got it and manage it, but you know ?? sentences
You know why I got em, stay on top of em, and ride em
And if your runnin' your mouth
I'm tellin you girl, I don't need your problems
You wanna fuck with the man?
Before we go to work we gonna need an understanding
You can't be sayin' shit can you handle this?

Chorus: (Mystikal)

Can you keep a secret?  Hush, Hush
Shut your mouth, it's just between us
Can you keep a secret? Hush, Hush
Don't tell nothing, it's just between us
Can you keep a secret? Hush, Hush
Don't say nothing, cause this is just between us
Can you keep a secret? Hush, Hush
Shut your mouth, don't say nothing

Verse 2: (Mercedes)

Now I ain't gonna lie baby you my nigga we be discussing shit
Thats supposed to be between us, a just like a bitch
You jaw-jacking and yapping on my business
I got the answer cause right here is where we end shit
If that's not it you got us caught up in a web of desception
They ain't your friends they are you down-fall
Baby just stay focused, we all know
You better keep your eyes on your eniemes and you better watch your friends
Cause your unknown and your tone, and next time you hear something
You better just keep yo' secret, hush hush

Master P talking:

Hell yeah
We got L-E in here for the 9 9
Miss Mercedes, and lest-o with the best-o Mystikal
If you can't keep a secret, you need to keep your mouth closed
Ya heard me?
