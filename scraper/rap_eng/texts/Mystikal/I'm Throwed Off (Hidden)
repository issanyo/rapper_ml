Man, I ain't never felt like this before
Damn, I ain't never felt like this before
I ain't right, fuck, this shit ain't right
I ain't right, shit ain't right
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm fucked up in the head but every time I go on
Bitch ran my coat on, bitch gonna take my clothes off
Niggas are crazy like road dogs, you can do what you wan' do
And say what you want, just don't play with me
Go wit'cha flow go, just don't call me bitch, okay?
Back off, back off, mind your business
Damn dog, didn't know you were ever gonna drop
Nigga, soon as I finish, I'm gonna make your motherfuckin'
Record Store look like it just got broke with a crowbar
I ain't gotta stand up in this bitch, take your hands on
Throwed off, throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
Niggas be testin' the street like dick-birds
Then they start day-dreamin', watch my tons and hit curbs
Then I fuck my eyes and spit in my face, they got bad nerves
I smoke, funny, ain't lust and use bad words
But I'm in another revolution, motherfucker seem with his ass heard
If you ever in your car and you play my game, throw the password
'Cause it doesn't rest its head with an exquisite hand and they blast first
I can't stand my next door neighborhood, so I'm here to get a transfer
They won't stay over my grass, fur, I ain't right
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed
Check this part out right here
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I smell a sticky nigga roll up one
Get back if you ain't got none
If you ain't 'bout it, then nigga, don't come
We tear this bitch up every time we come through
Actin' stupid, bitch, you know what I do
Lookin' like I come from Artabozoo
Where the feeders gumbo and cross-fetch too
I get down 'cause I come up around the checkin' line
Kell, stop that fuckin' track, I've lost my mind
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
Hickery-dickery-dock, get 'em jump off my cock
Bitch, get out my face, whore, stay out my pocket, that's right
Every time I come in the kitchen, put two in the kitchen
Gettin' fat, eatin' all the fuckin' food up but ain't washin' the dishes
The fuck you mean, do I have somethin' else to drink?
You just got to emptyin' the jug out the hands, it's the same
That's it, gotta get the fuck out
Bitch about to schold your hand to the door
Nigga, don't play that shit, better ask somebody
Bitch, thought you know
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
