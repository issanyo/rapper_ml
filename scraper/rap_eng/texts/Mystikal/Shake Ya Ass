[Intro]
Eight! Nate is great!

[Hook]
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with
Shake ya ass, watch yourself
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with
I said shake yo ass

[Verse]
I came here with my dick in my hand
Don't make me leave here with my foot in yo' ass;
Be cool, don't worry bout how I'm ripping this shit
When I'm flipping what I'm kicking nigga, it's just what I do

[Hook]
Shake that ass, show me what you working with
Shake that ass
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with
I said shake yo ass
I said shake it!

Shake ya ass, show me what you working with
Shake ya ass, watch yourself
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with
I said shake yo ass
Shake yo ass
