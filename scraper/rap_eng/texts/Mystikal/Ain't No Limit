[Intro: Master P]
Wuz up yall, wuz up soldiers?  This M-P, The Colonel
We ain't no rookies at makin records
Mystikal, Silkk
Together, Oh yeah.  It's time to pass out the stripes
Hah Bra
I told you there wasn't no limit

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
I told ya like I told him
Like I mean what I say what I say is what I mean
I talk mo shit than Muhammed Ali
In a situation about makin my green
First impression nigga back down
Fuck they can't stand up next to me
Competition bring out the best in me
Shit you talkin deader than Elvis Presley
I'm tryin to blow out bigger than the jaws of Dizzy Gillespie
Nigga the nigga won't let me
That's why when I get my shit I snipe like Wesley
You fuckin wit my right on what you been missin in this picture
Style funkin than a big pot of chitilins in yo kitchen
Some slang in yo shit ain't hittin Like I used the sound before
Listen to yo punk ass diamond sherm like what the fuck I'm around here for rough lines and hard rhymes
Consider me an asset
Slow down cause I got some more rhyme ambush ya ass set
Nigga that's how it is and I'ma make sure it stay that way
I did what they thought that I wasn't gonna do
And said what they thought that I wasn't gonna say
You know when I'm cookin
Cause you can smell it
To a buckshot from a pellet
Here I Go! I'm here to tell it

[Hook]
Here to tell it
Stomp this motherfucker like elephant
Spray you bitches like apes
Fly by you bitches like pelicans
Put a crack in yo exo-skeleton
Shake this bitch like a bowl of gelatin
We soldiers no limit soldiers ugh there ain't no limit

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Acceptin you can deliver title material
Somethin got your mind all blocked up
I be sexually exited when I'm writin'
I'm rocked up Oh Creative valves been unclogged up
I keep my elbow in your back To keep yo ass cocked up
Ain't no fuckin wit me Ain't no fuckin wit shit I did
26 and been through it, Tellin it like it is
Comin up with tight shit To make your girlfriend love me
Hunt me like playin rugby, Been a star since smokin puffies
And I'm that type of nigga that come thru this bitch
Now I stay down like it ain't nothin, My position is not up for grabs
My title is not for uppin
Seem like I can take a little bit more that what you put out to harm me Gotta continue to line my style to take
Formin a fort (You really will) I writes em line for line
Take my time till the shit is all tight
Focusing mind For most definitive could take all night
All right Fuckin right Unlike nobody else
I'm a one man show, Like havin sex with yourself
(Oh that was good)
You know how we kick it
You know what we do
All opportunities
And all unlimit
No matter if its good
Its gotta be tru
Mix mastered and marked
Somebody sell it
Fuck wit a no limit nigga over there talkin bout
Bitch I'm here to tell it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Silkk]
All aboard, put your coat on boy
Cause its about to get real fuckin chilly
Smoke yo ass like a philly
Fix yo face
Why you lookin all silly
Uh I stay muggin
Or should I say stay thuggin (Okay)
I ain't lettin shit pass NO!
I'm whoopin yo ass down the boat
Trick I'm the illest
Shouts say fuckin thriller
Mystikal and Silkk tha Shocker
Is how we met like King Kong Godzilla
Two of the baddest niggas on one track
How many of yall see some of that
None
Well in this rap game it don't matter
We run that!
Master P, Silkk, Mystikal
Like Earth, Wind, and Fire
Yall busters better retire
Put chall mouthful under the wire
It ain't no limit to our biz
Monopolize, capitalize our share
Makin rhetoric comin thru shit we done did
Cause I lay laws down like the mayor do
Boy look I'm buck wild
Plus I got mo styles than a hairdo (That man?)
I play my enemies and foes like checkers
(Crown Me!)
Keep those in section  (How broke?)
Broke like some records
No limit play it
Yall better hear it
You a bad mutha (Hush Yo Mouth)
I was only talkin bout yo lyrics
I hang with ballers and gangstas
(Oh my)
Step back for a second
And watch these soldiers on tanks
Roll By!
Entrepreneurs n Tycoons
If yall doubt it
Yall better not say it cause I been known to get down and dirty
Or should I say I'm just Bout it Bout it
T-R-U
Yall spell it
It ain't no limit to this boy
And I'm here to tell it

There ain't no limit
Where you at Mystikal!
HERE I GO!
