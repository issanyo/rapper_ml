Me that's who
Me me that's who
Me me that's who
I'm the round out the tank
I'm the round out the tank
I'm the round out the tank
I'm the loud blacca blacca, wacca wacca coming from
Behind cha
Me that's who

(Chorus X 2)

I'm the "weee" before the "boom"
I'm the fire in the hole coming from the tube
I'm the claymore mine sittin in the dirt
I'm the prone unsupported
I'm "doom doom doom" three round burst
Sleepin bag in the freezin weather
I'm the fragmentation vest for shrapnel and flyin metal
I'm the auto on the fire selector
I'm the thousand shells bouncin off the brass deflector
Squeeze the trigger center mass when it's time to take aim
I'm the "waahhhaa" boom when they ricochet down range
Creeping, heat seekin and keepin my target
I'm that biological threat you don't wanna go to war wit
Listen here I make you fuckin grave where you live at
I'm almost there one click away from yo' bivouac
Flash bang, highly illuminated
This is operation fuck over my destination

(Chorus X 2)

Ha, I'm all you rank and ribbons strips and brass and decorations
I'm that fucking hole in the earth after detonation
C 130 airborne soldier coming from the sky
Recognize ground troopers rolling just like hemmit tires
I'm fixin my road march so save ya breath
If I don't get cha with the rifle I'm a catch cha with my bayonette
I run with M1's, tanks and howtzers
I'm a 45 day 45 night field problem
I'm yo' smart book when the live exercise begins
And when it get dark I'm noise and light discipline
Twelve bravo run you out the foxhole
Make it to the bunker or it ain't no survival
I'm that war vet that's combat ready
Whether arctic or jungle or the middle of the desert
They try to make it when they know they can't
How the fuck yo gon run from the round out the tank
