Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm
Oooh-OOOH!

[Hook]
Shake it fast but watch yo' self
Shake it fast, show me what you workin' with
Shake it fast but watch yo' self
Shake it fast, show me what you workin' with

[Verse 1]
I came here with the mic in my hand
Don't make me leave here with my foot in yo' ass
Be cool and don't worry about how I'm rippin' this shit
When I'm flippin', when kickin', and this just what I do
I'm effervescent and I'm off that crescent
Nastier than a full grown German Shepherd
You better keep steppin'
They don't mess with me and they don't
Y'all can't catch me and you won't
Pay ya fare, fix it throw that pussy
I'm proud of my poo nanny and a dollar for my booty
You think I'm trippin', but, I ain't trippin'
I'm buyin' if you got curves for your iceberg
Drinkin' here acting like it's gonna do somethin' to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin' with me
Forget a dollar girl pick up fifty and forget that coward girl
You need a real nigga, off top a nigga 'bout hurtin' me
Bend over girl show me what you workin' with

[Hook]
Shake it fast but watch yo' self
Shake it fast, show me what you workin' with

[Bridge]
Attention all y'all playaz and pimps
Right now in tha place to be
I thought I told y'all dudes before
Y'all dudes can't mess wit me
This ain't for no small booties
No circus that won't pass
You feel you got tha biggest one
Then momma come shake it fast

[Hook]
Shake it fast but watch yo' self
Shake it fast, show me what you workin' with
Shake it fast but watch yo' self
Shake it fast, show me what you workin' with

[Verse 2]
I come with that fire like cayenne
Chocolate and bowlegged runnin' up behind her
Go head get down pop lock at the cock house
For real though girl donâ€™t lie you know you wanna go back to my house
Man right, Cher wanna get under that dress right there
Spicy Cajun we gon' a good time over there
You better stick a head on that, there craw fish
You gotta bend all the way over to dance off this
Handle yo business but I know you do it way better
You dead wrong
So if you totin' by and make noise
When you pass by girl you find yourself on the floor girl
This yo' song
Do yo' thang, don't be scoured 'cause you gon' get served
Get mine and you gon' get yours
You making me lovely
Raise it up, show yo G-string hustlin', huslin'

[Bridge]
Attention all y'all blazin' pimps
Right now in the place to be
I thought I told y'all dudes before
Y'all dudes can't mess with me
Now this ain't for no small booties
No circus that won't pass
But if you feel you got the biggest one
Then momma come shake ya fast

[Hook]
Shake it fast but watch yo' self
Shake it fast, show me what you workin' with
Shake it fast but watch yo' self
Shake it fast, show me what you workin' with

[Verse 3]
Stop yo' cryin' Heifer, I don't need all that
Got a job for you the braided up pimp is back
Break them handcuffs, forget your man move somethin'
They ask you what you doin', say ooh nothin'
And we been doin' for the past 2 somthin'
Been beatin' that stuff up now smooth lovin'
You can betcha bottom that if it's fire, you gon' holla while you cry
So don't be actin' like you don't be backin' that stuff up
You girl in the club and thats what you got for, wobble, wobble
I'm infatuated the girl ride that thing like she makin' a baby
Now I see that we gon have to go to a quiet corner for just of two
Don't worry about who lookin', just keep doin' what you do
Your brother like me gon' get to workin' for I know the girl
Trick, what's happnin' let 'em see, show the world

[Bridge]
Attention all y'all blazin' pimps
