(Mystikal)
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Nigga, that's like somebody who ain't
Got no fuckin' money tryin' to say somethin' to "P"
It's like y'all niggas goin' to learn - to learn with "E"
Y'all niggas act like ya go to job interviews
And come and try to fuck with our beans
Oh no, you don't go, go there, fool!
That nigga said what? Oh ah, hell no!!
Still hot, just thought I'll tell y'all
Bitches suckin' dick if they thought it fell off
Like a man-stare, hundred-twelve floors
When they want the fire I'm the one they'll call
Your Record Company's Stores' fallin'
I'll pick that bitch up, put it on my back and start walkin'
Hit the car, start coughin'
Shoplifter get off, I'm bustin' the dodger
I'll B&B y'all from N.O. to L.A
You ain't lookin' for me, cause you know me by my face

(Chorus: Mystikal)
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
You lookin' for me, you lookin' for me?
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
You lookin' for me, you lookin' for me?
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
You lookin' for me, you lookin' for me?
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
You lookin' for me?

Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
I better go complete, tie to put together rap DEAD on the beat
Don't beg for my weed, don't step on my feet (step on my feet)
Don't pull out my prenium, messin' with my trailor
Lookin' my women, don't fuck with my jeep
My coban motherfuckers, can never be chuckin' no beef
Y'all niggas still can't fuck wit' me and would not compete
I'm out the box, off the HEAT!!
Proper prop-lock up blocks with much shit, drop shit
Jaws and break bones with my shit-song
And it's on with rhyme-stones, styles gon' be shown
And I'm known, bring it home, an' home on microphone
It don't say my name on it, so, cause they know I'll be comin' for 'em

(Chorus: Mystikal)
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
You lookin' for me, you lookin' for me?
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
You lookin' for me, you lookin' for me?
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
You lookin' for me, you lookin' for me?

(Mystikal)
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me
You said we're takin' a trip cause I'ma pocket-full of TNT
What the fuck you gon' get? Them niggas ain't fuckin' wit' these
Well fuck it and feel , nigga, my shit don't come from the streets
I'll be the pepper, hot sauce for ya
SPICY, somethin' ride on fool
WATCH ME, polished up, saddle up - giddy up
Oh shit - dried out, let's go - HIT 'EM UP!!!
Come on - let 'em have it - ditchin' out then don't have it
It's like I accept it - take my loss, shake it off
You got my ends bitch, bring it ALL for the year
Strap, hold my tongue - MOTHERFUCKER - I SAID "ALL"!!!
Fuck, first ya family, this street was never a skin-up-ya
Watch your mouth nigga, never do business wit' cap-peelin'
I bring that funk - stop says: "Stop at yo' door"
Come out the trunk - are you sure I'M THE ONE YOU WANT??!!
