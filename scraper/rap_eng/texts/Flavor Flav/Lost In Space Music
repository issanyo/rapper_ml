[Intro: Chuck D, Flavor Flav]
Lost in space... music

Yeah!

[Verse 1: Chuck D Flavor Flav]
Every generation
Got their music
Kick it!
Beyond this hatin’
Every generation
Gots its favorite (Haha)
Favorite nation (Hahaha)
New releases
Label ceases
To release it
Magazine pieces
Lambo leases
Gabardine creases
What we gonna do?
Fashionistas
Lovin’ that music

[Hook: Chuck D, Flavor Flav]
Lost in music
Don't understand it!
Lost in music
I’m lost in music

Ya know... some of these dudes out here ain’t right

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Lovin’ believin’ it
Without even seein’ it
Young folk feel it
Not even bein’ it
People say steal it
I’m a realist
Damn
Pass the cam
(Daaaaaam!)
Turnt up brand

[Hook: Chuck D, Flavor Flav]
Lost-Lost-Lost in music
Don’t understand it!
Lost in music
Yeah!
