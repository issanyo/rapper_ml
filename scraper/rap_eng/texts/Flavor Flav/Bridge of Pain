[All verses by Flavor Flav]

[Intro]
I'm wit'chu Spider; aiyyo check one two
Tis cut goes out to all my brothers locked up
In the penal systems all over the world y'knahmsayin
I wrote this cut about a bridge, that takes you to Rikers Island
I was locked up on Rikers Island, C-73, C-76
This is my story about when I was in the mix

[Verse One]
WHEN IT RAINS IT POURS - that's what they all say
Ridin on the big bus down the highway
Thinkin of the next move, ridin in the rain
Headin up the road to the bridge of pain
Only if I woulda, only if I coulda
Maybe I just shoulda, nah that ain't gon' work
I'm fucked up in the game, they got me by the balls
To cross the bridge of pain your ass is right behind the walls
'Fore you at that bridge a lot of shit goes through yo' mind
You stressed the fuck up, ready to spazz
Goin' back behind the gate, walk around without a pass
The bridge of pain makes you think of all of that
Doin' magic ain't blankin' out none of that
Because it's all about reality, you fucked up mentality
SO just sit back and face uh, the technicality
This shit is real son, keepin' it gully
Cause even after jail when you could be sleepin' at your telly
Too late now is the name of the game
Cause right around the corner is the bridge of pain

[Hook]
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain

[Verse Two]
Here we go again, back to this shit
Same old shit, just a different toilet bowl
Hangin' in there like a sweater in the closet
Slow motion, is better than no motion
Gotta beat the game tag, gettin' caught up in the broom
Police sweep the streets to make room
They don't give a fuck, all they want is rank
Not givin' a fuck about what your family think
You get Flavor Flav in the papers
Headline news about all of my capers
Everything that Flavor Flav gotta do hit the news
Front page to back page, from the jail to the stage
Make crowds outraged all over the world
Around the world 8 times and I'm goin' for more
I had it goin real good 'til the judge stopped me
Locked me up and tried to make the world drop me
Simple and plain, Judge Goodman's insane
After I saw his face I crossed the bridge of pain

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Mind done ran down the drain, can't make no moves
Loosin' all my shippin' cause of state boots
I guess they need me, the C.O.'s lead me
Some niggas greet me until they freed me
To cross the bridge of happiness, which do exist
Within the same bridge that you see in the mist
But too late now is the name of the game
Cause right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain

[Hook]
