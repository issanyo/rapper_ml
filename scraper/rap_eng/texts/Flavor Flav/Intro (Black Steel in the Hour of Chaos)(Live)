Hey check this out right about now
I wanna introduce a brotha
That came all the way out here from the strong island
New York
And he's one of the fathers of revolutionary music
In our time period
He was a huge influence on us and we wanna bring him out right now
So check it out
We got a man by the name of Chuck D, from Public Enemy
Yeah

[Chuck D]
Wassup, wassup!
Wassup, wassup!
Wassup, wassup!
Wassup, wassup!

[Zack]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Chuck D]
I'm with Rage on the stage and I back Zack
Tim on the bass, Tom in your face
We got Brad on the drums, can you get some?
Drummer in the ? can you get some?
Pump pump on my lap at all times
We murder the boom-bap
This is the rage in your ear
Here ye, here ye
The crowd so near me, but you still don't hear me

I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for the army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn - I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute it
Occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me for some crime
Never the less they could not understand that I'm a black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, Zack, so I'm lookin' for the steel
Peace y'all

[Zack]
C'mon y'all, give it up for Chuck D!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
