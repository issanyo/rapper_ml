[Intro]
Ha ha, this beat is rockin yo
Flavor Flav comin at y'all from a different angle y'knahmsayin
I hope y'all understand this
I think y'all gon' like this y'knahmsayin

[Flavor Flav - singing]
I'm the one that got that flavor
Make you feel the Flavor Flav from side to siiiiiiiide
I don't care wherever you at
In your crib or in your riiiiiiiiiiide
Everytime I deliver I come correct
My word is booooooooooooooooooooooond
And when I come to your hood it's all good
Flavor wave the Flavor waaaaaaaaaaaaand

[Chorus 1]
And give flavor, flavor, original Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav
Flavor, flavor, original Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav
Flavor, flavor, original Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav
Flavor, flavor, the one and only Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav

[Flavor Flav - singing]
I promise to flavor all things in existance
The right and exaaaaaaaaaaaact
I will flavor up reality
So dope you will taste it in every faaaaaaact

[Flav rapping]
Everything that I do is on the real smart thinkin on the impulse
No choice, of the matter
Every move you make has got to be a bullseye
One slight move can cost the whole camp somethin vicious
Just cause it was cold Pepsi drink that's not delicious

[Chorus 2]
Flavor, flavor, original Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav
Flavor, flavor, the one and only Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav
Flavor, flavor, original Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav
Flavor, flavor, the one and only Flavor Flaaaaaaaaaav

[Flavor Flav - singing]
Every day that you wake up and open yo' eyes
You must thank Goooooooooood
If you think life a prison you will find yourself
Layin up in the yaaaaaaaaaaaard
God says you can't keep it unless
You give some of it awaaaaaaaaaaaay
Everything that you give away
You will get ten more than the staaaaaaaay
Yo' eyes may shine, your teeth may grit
If I catch you stealin from me then you won't see ISH
I worked too hard, for you to take mine
If I take your life if I catch you comin from the blind

[Chorus 2]

[Flav rapping]
You better act like you know cause the streets is f'real
You don't see everything that sees you, Flavor keeps it real
Out the corner of your eye there's a blue suit guy
Watchin you make transactions, now he gotta take some action!

[Chorus 2] with ad libs
