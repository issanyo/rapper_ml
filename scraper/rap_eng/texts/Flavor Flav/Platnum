And watch me pack the house (say what?)
Everybody goin crazy yo without a doubt
Everybody come on and get up off the wall
Everybody come on and let's have a ball

[Interlude]
We rock, we roll
Oh yes this beat is cold
It gets deep in your soul
And makes you very bold
It makes you wanna dance
It makes you wanna sing

Everybody come on and get up off the wall
Everybody come on and let's have a ball

Everybody come on and dance this
Guys grab that girl and romance to this
You've only got one chance at this
I'm throwin 900 grands at this
Everybody get up and do the damn thing
Get down with Flavor Flav and sing

[Interlude]

Everybody get up and do the damn thing
Get down with Flavor Flav and sing

[Chorus] - repeat 3X

[Flavor Flav]
