[Verse 1]
Now I dialed nine one one a long time ago
Don't you see how late they're reacting
They only come and they come when they want to
So get the morgue truck and bag the goner
They don't care 'cause they get paid anyway
They treat you like an ace that can't be betrayed
I know you stumble with no use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Late comings with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise
Y'all I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers
Quick they come to fetch you
With an autopsy ambulance
Just to dissect ya
They are the kings 'cos they swing amputation
Lose your arms your legs to them it's compilation
I can prove it to you watch the rotation
It all adds up to a funky situation

[Chorus][2x]
So get up get get get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up get get get down
Late 911 wears the late crown
911 is a joke [2x]

[Verse 2]
Everyday they don't never come correct
You can ask my man right here
With the broken neck
He's a witness to the job never being done
He would've been in full effect 911
They the token to your life when it's croaking
They need to be in a pawn shop on a
911 is a joke we don't want 'em
I call a cab 'cause a cab will come quicker
The doctors huddle up and call a flea flicker
The reason that I say that 'cause they
Flick you off like fleas
They be laughing at ya
While you're crawling on our knees
And to the strength so go the length
Thinking you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor
Cause 911 is a fake life saver

[Chorus][2x]
