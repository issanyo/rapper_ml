[Flavor Flav]
I didn't die right!
I didn't die right!

[Harry Allen]
This is Harry Allen, hip-hop activist and media assassin, with Flavor Flav. What's the flavor, Flavor?

[Verse 1]
Yo yo yo gee, guess what happened
To the burned up hand that was clappin'
Too good to be true
Getting all the guys turn to get in doo-doo
Took it all for granted
Then life start turn to granted
Having everything to having nothing
Now this turkey ain't got no stuffing
On the couch ill puffing
To get you buffin', it's you they got cuffin
Your family they did not believe me
Till they heard it for themselves on TV
I called the crib, the clock said seven
More news at 11
(Yo, Harry!)

[Chorus – Harry Allen]
More news at 11

[Verse 2]
I was watching the TV screen
Can't believe what I seen
Three guys tried to rob a store
Got more than what they bargained for
They shot them right before my eyes
All three just dropped like flies
If they only thought before they did it
Neither one of those three would have been with it
As they fell to the floor and got rougher
Now the family has got to suffer
Pallbearers got to carry them
While the family cry loud just to bury them
Newscast and people were heavily amazed
Flavor Flav just stared in a daze
Eyewitness News - channel seven
More news at 11

[Outro – Harry Allen]
This is Harry Allen hip hop activist and media assassin
With my co-anchor Flavor Flav for PETV
And by the way if you still think that they're that type
Don't believe the hype
