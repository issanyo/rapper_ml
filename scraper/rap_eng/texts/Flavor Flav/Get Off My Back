[x4]
You've got to get off my back (Get off my back!)

[Verse 1]
The monkey ain't no joke
So you want to mess with the coke
Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy
The monkey ain't no joke
You better leave 'em alone
He's home grown, he's the cyclone
He's the moan, groan, Capone, the clone
The broken bone tone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You've got to get off my back (Get off my back!)
You've got to get off my back (Get off my back and let me breathe!)

[Chorus]
We got the real Flavor Flav
Gettin' down with the sound
And he's tellin' you to get off his back
(Hey!)
We got the real Flavor Flav
Gettin' down with the sound
And he's tellin' you to get off his back

[Verse 2]
The monkey ain't no joke
So you want to mess with the coke
Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy
The monkey ain't no joke
You better leave 'em alone
He's home grown, he's the cyclone
He's the moan, groan, Capone, the clone
The broken bone tone

He's on your back, gives you no slack
Don't give me no flack!
Because I know
Toe to toe, go to go
He's on my back (Get off my back!)
Get off my back!
Get off my back and let me sing!

[Chorus]
We got the real Flavor Flav
Gettin' down with the sound
And he's tellin' you to get off his back
(Hey!)
We got the real Flavor Flav
Gettin' down with the sound
And he's tellin' you to get off his back

[x4]
Asalaam alaikum
And that's the way we take 'em
And if we got to frisk you down
Then that's the way we shake 'em

[Chorus]
We got the real Flavor Flav
Gettin' down with the sound
And he's tellin' you to get off his back
We got the real Flavor Flav
Gettin' down with the sound
And he's tellin' you to get off his back

[Verse 3]
The monkey ain't no joke
So you want to mess with the coke
Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy
The monkey ain't no joke
You better leave 'em alone
He's home grown, he's the cyclone
He's the moan, groan, Capone, the clone
The broken bone tone
He's on your back, gives you no slack
Don't give me no flack!
Because I know
Toe to toe, go to go
He's on my back (Get off my back!)

You've got to get off my back (There you go!)
You've got to get off my back (Hah-hah... Uh!)
You've got to get off my back
You've got to get off my back (Get off my back, homie)
You've got to get off my back [x6]
