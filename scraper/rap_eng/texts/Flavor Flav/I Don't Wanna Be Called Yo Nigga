[Verse 1]
How can you say to me, "Yo, my nigga!"
Cursin' up a storm with your finger on a trigger
Feelin' all the girls like a big gold digger
Take a small problem, make a small problem bigger
You say, "Yo I ain't poor I got dough
"You don't consider me your brother no more?"
Goddamn killer brown, how do you figure?
I don't want to be called yo nigga

[Verse 2]
I try to make my statements stick like flypaper
Judge says to me, "Yo nigga, sign these goddamn papers"
My boss told me, "Yo nigga, you're fired"
Cause my body told me, "Yo nigga, you're tired"
Yo nigga this, yo nigga that
I'm yo nigga now cause your head got fat
Flava framalama boy you won't figure
I don't wanna be called yo nigga

[Verse 3]
N-I-G-G-E-R
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
Everybody sayin' it, Everybody playin' it
Roll it on the scales, cause everybody's weighin' it
Toby say, "Yo, I be good nigga
"Nigga get a shovel, nigga be good digger!"
I don't care how small or bigger
I don't want to be called yo nigga
