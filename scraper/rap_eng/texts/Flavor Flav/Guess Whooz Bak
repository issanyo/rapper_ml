(Scooby Dooby Doo, Scooby Dooby Doo, Scooby Dooby Doo)

[Intro]
Guess who's back? (Who G?)
Yes, it's the Flavor Flav (Ohhh snap ha ha ha)
Scooby Dooby Doo, Scooby Dooby Doo, Scooby Dooby Doo
Guess who's back? (YEAH~!)
Yes, it's the Flavor Flav (Flavor Flav you done it again ha ha)
Scooby Dooby Doo, Scooby Dooby Doo, Scooby Dooby Doo

[Flavor Flav]
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh snap
Back again it's the incredible
Your man Flavor bring it up another decibel
Mark my bank account, add another decimal
Keep the party fresh like funky fresh vegetables
Tomatoes, potatoes
Still fuckin runnin from that dick in the plainclothes
When I'm the road I keep my dick in a raincoat
Flip with a rainbow
'Pon ton, wonton soup and a eggroll
And I get my petrol from Mexico
And my weed come from Texaco, that's just to let you know
They locked me up and you see they wouldn't let me go
I asked myself "Yo Flav how the hell we get here yo?"
Bodyguards, comrades and the CEO's
Got the bitches at the bars and the peep shows
Just when I thought all my luck ran out
They fucked up and let your boy out, HOLLA AT YA BOY!
Ha ha, ha ha

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Guess who's back? Yes, it's the Flavor Flav
Scooby Dooby Doo, Scooby Dooby Doo, Scooby Dooby Doo

[Flavor Flav]
Back in your face and I'm kickin ballistics
A lot of other people kickin false statistics
Flavor Flav, is back
On track, and I'll never be whack
2003 I came out the system
And I see the beginnin for me
That's when, I got
Caught with, the gun
And then they locked me up
And they broke the key, you see
I had to do my time like everybody else
Then they took Jam Master Jay off the shelf
Then Flavor Flav
Had the jail locked down, gimme a pound
All over the Island, if the nigga who did it
Came around, the nigga would be ground round
So here we go
Just like K-I-M, keep it movin
Nigga what, nigga what
Up on your face with a cigarette
