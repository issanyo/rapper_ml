[Chuck D] {*storm raging in the background*}
Does it gotta come down to this...
In order to see things for what they are and what it is...
We still might not be free up in this piece
Or treated very equally as far as I can see...
Hell no we ain't alright!

[Chuck D] + (Flavor Flav)
Now all these press conferences, breaking news alert (this just in)
While your government looks for a war to win
Flames for the blame game, names where I begin
Walls closin and get some help to my kin
(Who cares?) While the rest of the Bush nation stares
As the drama unfolds, as we the people under the stairs
Fifty percent of this "Son of a Bush" nation
Is like, hatin on Haiti and settin up assassinations
Ask Pat Robertson, quiz him (mmm - smells like terrorism)
Racism in the news, still one-sided views
Sayin whites find food
Pray for the National Guard who be ready to shoot
Because they be sayin us blacks loot
(What is your boy "Son of a Bush" doin?) {*laughing*}
(NUTTIN!)

[Chorus 1]
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright

[Chorus 2]
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! "Damn, damn!"

[Chuck D] + (Flavor Flav)
Now them fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, I don't mean to scare
... wasn't this written somewhere?
Disgrace is all I be seein is hurtin black faces
Moved out to all them far away places
(Emergency) state, corpses alligators and snakes
Big difference between this haze and (the little diamonds on the VMA's)
You better look what's really important
Y'all under the sun, especially if you over 21
This ain't no TV show, ain't no video (this is really real!)
Beyond them same ol' keep it real
Quotes from them TV stars, drivin big rim cars (streets keep floodin B)
No matter where you at no gas, driving is a luxury (urgency)
Don't y'all know? They said it's a state of emergency
Show somebody's government is far from reality
(Aiyyo check one two!)

[Chorus 1]
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright

[Chuck D]+ (TV broadcast samples)
And they don't have a CLUE of what's going on down there
I'm like you've gotta be kidding me, this is a NATIONAL disaster
It's awful down here man
God is lookin down on all this
And if they are not doin everything in their power to save people
They are gonna pay the price

[Chuck D] + (Flavor Flav)
Now I see we be the new faces of refugees, who ain't even overseas
But stuck here on our knees
Forget the plasma TV, ain't no electricity
New world's upside down and OUT of order
Shelter, food, what's up yo? (Where's the water?)
No answers from disaster, them masses be hurtin
So who the f#$! they call - HALLIBURTON?!
"Son of a Bush" how you gonna just trust that cat
To fix s%#t when all that help is stuck in Iraq?
Makin war plans takin more stands in Afghanistan
Two thousands soldiers there dyin in the sand
But that's over there, right? What's over here?
It's a noise so loud some of y'all can't hear
But on TV I know that I can see
Bunches of people, lookin just like me

[Chorus]
New Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright
Mississippi in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright
Alabama in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright
U.S.A. in the mornin afternoon and night
Hell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright

[Chuck D]
We definitely ain't alright
And some of y'all voted for that cat! "Son of a Bush"
That's right, what God giveth sometimes your country taketh away
Yeah, one love, comin from Public Enemy, #1 y'all
Public Enemy, 2006 (yeah)
Public Enemy 2007, all gettin together now

[Flavor Flav]
Let me tell y'all somethin
All of our hearts is out there with y'all, you know what I'm sayin?
And we sendin trucks, we sendin boats
Boxes of.. cans of soup and everything
Clothes and all of that, shoes
We donating everything to y'all, you know what I'm sayin?
Don't worry, y'all ain't by yourself
You need to know that
