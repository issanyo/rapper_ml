[Verse 1]
I am taking no prisoners, taking no shorts
Breakin' with the metal of a couple of forts
While we're hearin' that boom supplement the mix
We're gonna rush 'em like the Bears in the 46
Homeboys I don't know but they're part of the pack
In the plan against the man, bum rush attack
For the suckers at the door, if you're up and around
For the suckers at the door, we're gonna knock you back down

[Hook]
Yo! Bum rush the show!

[Verse 2]
Searching my body for fuckin' what
Cause my gun's just for fun and knife don't cut
How can I make you understand
I get ill on a posse with my goddamn hands
Troubles, not me, I don't mean to cause
But you took one look and began to pause
Didn't holler at the dollar we willin' to spend
But you took one look and wouldn't let our ass in

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cold bum rushin' doors like at first it's something
But all we realize that the show ain't nothin'
For the stunts and the blunts, whole world inside
The reason that the mighty used force supplied
No comp, we'll stomp all in our way
Gave me static so I won't pay
It might be a trick that you don't like
Comin' in the side door then grabbin' the mike

Walkin' and talkin' - fist full in the air
It might seem like that we don't care
A ho for an oh, a pow for an ow
Girls start screamin' all I say is wow
Get that sucker who shot that gun
Whip his monkey ass till it ain't no fun
5-O showed and wouldn't you know
They blamed it on the kid cause all I said was...

[Hook]
