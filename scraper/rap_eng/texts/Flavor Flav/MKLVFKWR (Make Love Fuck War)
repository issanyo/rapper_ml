[Verse One: Chuck D]
Rather be sitting just to get in it
Power to the people not the governments
Capitalists, communists and terrorists
Swear to God, I don't know the difference
Making new slaves out of the immigrants
Want to know where all the money went
Another trillion spent by the government
Here the bomb go, sent by the presidents
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE!!

Tell the leaders, they got to feed us
Grand Theft Oil, gonna bleed us
New World Order, doesn't need us
Call for peace, better heed us
Dictators, Human Haters
Hand on the bomb, Mass Debators
Finger on the button, infiltrators
MAKE LOVE, FUCK, WORLD, PEACE will slave us
Yeah, COME ON!!
