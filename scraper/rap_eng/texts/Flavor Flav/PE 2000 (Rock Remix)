[Puff Daddy]
One, two, one, two and the place to be
As it is plain to see I am the crushed proven
The body movin, the record breakin, and the record makin
Yeah
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two and the place to be
As it is plain to see
I am the record makin, the record breakin, the booty shakin
(One, two, one, two and the place to be)
As it is plain to see I am the crushed proven
The body movin, the record breakin and the record makin
And it goes a little somethin like this:

[Puff Daddy]
Here I am, where's my enemies?
Fear no man, whoever you send to me
Won't last long, I'm to strong
I disagree in between right and wrong
Watch all the men that's around you drop
When will the madness stop?
When will the nonsense cease?
The war or the peace rage is the way I release
So you want it, I surprise you, take alive you
Penalise you, a sibalise you
My eyes seen the comin of your downfall
Weaker than all, identified you with raw
I found strength when he heard my call
Pray to cry number
You can't win if it's on again, I'm a call 'em in
Let them all begin, you know prevails
Who never fails, who excels
Who's left when all else has been destroyed
The righteous ones to hard to avoid
Come on

Public Enemy
My eyes seen the comin of your downfall

Come on huh and I sing

[Mista Chuck]
Oh no, here goes trouble
God damn, now watch the weevils wobble under the rubble (What) (Bounce wit
Me)
Shot no photo shoots got the whole troop backed by the proop
Man salute to the troops un nuclear from nukes confrontation
Can't stop out the corporation
With all my might at night backed by fist fights
Nothing to lose one choice to choose once for fools
A pro for interludes both the blessed in the cursed
So I trip to know what figures in the verse
Now who feelin' worse the real a real threat
Pull a Generation X style object
Broadcast free at last (free at last)
Anti violence repast
So I pray

[PD]
MOTHERFUCKER'S!

You see I just wanna get in to do mine
What kinda, kinda fucking problem you got with me
I ain't do nothin to you but make a whole lotta money
BIACH! Come On

[Puff Daddy]
Can't be touched, can't be takin
Face to face with em never once seen shakin
Can't be scared or prepared be dared
Can't be controlled when I flare
I'm hard to hold, hard to fold, difficult to roll
No one can stop my stroll
Won't be defeated or deleted
Be cheated, stampeded over, I repeat it
Can't lose can't be refused, nigga's can't snooze
Are you payin your dues? All the P's and Q's
Never been accused, walkin with the light
Coming with the bad moves
Better flee for your life like a refugee
Cause I'm comin for you, so God help me
Now... throw your hands in the air, better be prepared
Better stay aware, better say your prayers

MOTHERFUCKER'S

I be your Public Enemy
Come On

Public Enemy

Public Enemy

Oh God damn
Come on
Can't be stopped, I refuse to stop, I will never stop
I refuse to stop, I will never stop Huh
