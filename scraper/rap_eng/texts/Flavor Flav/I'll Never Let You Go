[Verse 1]
You say that you'll want me, you'll hug me, you'll hold me
You'll squeeze me, you'll feel me, you'll please me
Deep in your heart you'll know I'll never let you go

You say that you'll go anywhere and do what we do best at
We'll leave it up to the rest
Deep in your heart you'll know I'll never let you go

[Hook]
Did I ever tell you I would not be your best friend?
Didn't I tell you that I love you to the end?
Deep in your heart you'll know I'll never let you go
Didn't I tell you true love was hard to find?
Cause what we have is one of a kind
Deep in your heart you'll know I'll never let you go

[Verse 2]
You think when I go to the club with my boys I get girls
But I would never do that to you
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go

I promise to death do us part, for better, for worse
Till one of us at the pen that hurts
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go

I think that you're cheating on me
You think that I'm cheating on you, so what we gonna do?
Deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go

You're banging on me, I'm banging on you
Babygirl, you know what we gotta do
Cause deep in your hart you'll know I'll never let you go
