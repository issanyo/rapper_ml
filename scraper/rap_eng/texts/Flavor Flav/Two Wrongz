[Flavor Flav - singing]
Two wrongs don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT - don't make it right
Two wroooooooooooongs, RIGHT

When we first started off as bein friends
Havin good times over and over again
And then we fell in love, our feelings were so strong
After four years long, what went wrong?
You didn't believe me so I didn't trust in you
You gotta watch out for your feelings cause they ain't all true
Feelings can be right and feelings can be wrong
Without trust it won't be strong, it won't be right

Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it ALRIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT - don't make it right
Two wroooooooooooongs, RIGHT

You'll do things to me, I do it back to youuuuu (RIGHT)
What goes around come back around, this is true
We gotta put the past behind us, move forward like we should
Just like K-I-M, keep it movin it's all good
God gave me power to have strength to forgive (RIGHT)
Livin right within yourself is how I want to live (RIGHT)
God knows how I miss my first three kids (RIGHT)
But there's this foul shit that their mother did
It wasn't RIGHT

Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT
Two wrongs, don't make it RIIIIIIGHT - it don't make it right
Two wroooooooooooongs, RIGHT
