[Bridge]
What you talking about, money?
Money, bitch, I blow it
Talking about weed
Shawty, come roll it
Talking about hoes
Yeah, they going
What about me? Bitch, I'm rolling

[Hook]
(I got my) double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
(Ace Hood!)
Let's talk about money
Bitch, I get me a whole lot of
Stunting in this hoe like a Globe Trotter
Leave red on your shirt like a 49er
I'm sippin' slow with my mind gone
That purple stuff in my styrofoam
I'm too stoned, no angie, nigga
Bad bitch and her mouth deliver
Sweet niggas get choppa feelings
I'm getting head with my ceiling missing
I'm too trippy, I'm to flithy
I'm about bread but don't do jiffy
That new Ferrari cost 250
I pull up park but don't play with me
You must be crazy, they stay with me
Shooter smoking like 420
I smoke good and I fuck better
Me and pussy niggas don't go together
Boy, I got balls like a prison cellar
Cop me a watch with a stupid bezzle
My weed loud and my neighboors tripping
I'ma made nigga but I don't wash dishes
Fuck you if you still hating
Your bitch patient, she still waiting

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I am double cup with my top down
Two stems, them blocks down
It's war time, no guns down
And I'm sipping on that H-Town
I'm notorious
All my niggas sell angel dust
All my niggas rock styrofoam
And they doubled up and they have fun
I'm on that remix
I'm selling remix
Hey, this that G shit
See them white whips
Hey, that's that me shit
I'm 'bout my V shit
That parade, that white parade
I drop the top on that new Phantom
This city waved
My ghetto ways, my ghetto ways
They got me paid
I'm double cup and triple stacking
I got racks for days
And I can't lie, back in the G
I used to trap for days
They ask me how I get this money
A 100 ways, I am

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
I hold my cup up
(They double cup down, know what the hell I'm dranking)
I let my top down
(They drop the coupe, y'all know what the hell I'm thanking)
Say shout out to them Texas niggas
(Let them know, let them know)
I do this shit for Texas, nigga
Young gun of the city got the rock now
Niggas wanna see the shooting star, get shot down
Please, don't approach with any [?]
[?] bitch I'm Bobby Brown
Got overdone hump like I'm collar man
I been in the Stu like it's shining time
I'm back in this bitch and I'm 'bout to take charge
When they thought I was flopping, I gotta find
I pull up in something them niggas can't fuck with
The bitch on the front looking gold like a trumpet
The bitch in the passenger, ass like a puppet
My pockets on Kermit, we look like The Muppets
I don't need no soda, I don't need no crutches
To roll with in cup all I need is a tussen
Can't pay for these bitches, not part of my buget
You saving these bitches with no control button
Uh, my cup up my top down
(Double cup and my top down)
I'm well known in that H-Town
From the eastside to the southside to the north
To the southwest to the fair road
And the [?] summerpoint, let them know

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tiffany Foxx]
Talking to a boss bitch
I talk about keys, I talk about packs
Talk about weed, I talk about crack
Talk about Ace, I talk about yacht
Talk about cheese, I don't talk to no rats
I learned from the best
Still go see a nigga while he in the feds
Still run this rap shit while I'm in a dress
These niggas wanna undress me
Then I'm in that category with the rest
The pull up on the breast
Fuck that when it come to this shit
Infamous we the best
He said, T. Foxx, kill this shit, get the Smith and Wes
Blow out the chest
Cavities intestines, wear it on my neck
Once she take her last breath
Have maggots eat the remains
Of her brains till it ain't nothing left
And your name on the TEC
When I spit a hot 16
So much cake like I robbed sweet 16
Pussy so clean and tight like a virgin
So I should been on original bitch

[Verse 5: Jim jones]
I'm on some Bentley shit with a double cup
Two blunts in the air playing double dutch
Her and a friend, that's a double up
Two 40s on the hip, that's a double trouble
You don't want that, don't trouble us
Niggas wanna blow till they bubble bust
Married to the game, no cuddle up
Don't pillow talk if they cuff you up
Drop top shit till the sun is up (and)
Watch on my wrist cost a 100 bucks (ew)
That's for the jeweler, got to flood it up
You wanna fuck with us, get your numbers up (go)
She jump in the ride, she gon' suck it up
My niggas get money and they bust it up
You wanna get money then fuck with us
But if you fuck with us then you fuck with us
Like whoa, whoa, whoa

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Snootie Wild]
If it ain't that loud I don't want it (I don't want it)
I can get it anytime anyday in my city
I'm drunked out, I'm joaning
I'm up early in the morning
Double cuping horny
Still count this money
I'm 'bout to pull me a 4-o
Drop tickets in slow mo
Everywere I go-o
They be like that yayo
Oh, I will get with it, ain't no pitty
Gangsta in my city
Long nights in that kitchen tryna get it
They gon' see my vision
Aye, yayo
Aye, all I know
