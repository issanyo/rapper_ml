[Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Better watch what you say to me
Cause being broke don't relate to me
Like a dick I'm in these bitches heads
Allow me to reintroduce myself

[Verse 1: Tiffany Foxx]
The names Foxx, only fuck with the top notch
Hotter than gasoline and a match box
Wrist, fuck around, call it top watch
Floating on cloud 9, call it top watch
On the block, while you sell frames, neighborhood botch
Jumping double dutche in giuseppes for the neighborhood watch
Hotter than Black Eyed Peas and corn bread in the Crock Pot
And I'm from the Louie, cut crack and soup in the same pot
Been the shit since hard bottoms and big wheels
Now it's red bottoms, shotsy rim
Persevant through the struggle, I know how that feels
That’s why I grind harder than wheel chairs on 6 wheels
I ain’t vibing these niggas, I need 6 pills
Now the chick Brooke Shields, turned down 6 deals
Hustle a castle, Donald trump 6 mill
I got a 6th sense so know how 6 feel

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Better watch what you say to me
Cause being broke don't relate to me
Like a dick I'm in these bitches heads
Allow me to reintroduce myself

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
The names Queen, Bee
Be on them Pirelli wheels
Rims like I'm riding on a ferris wheel
At least six inches in them guiseppe heels
B.K. Bitch, shopping in Beverly Hills
In the ferogamo store, noble and siaga
I got Chocolate diamonds in my dog chain
You bitches rocking flea collars!
I gotta go I'm meeting Marc Jacobs at the top!
Marc Jacobs watch, Marc Jacobs yacht
I'm at the Barclays Center, front row
Man I'm sitting so close a bitch looking like the coach
Please, they all know Kimmy is the best
Why you think them nets run around with B's on they chest
Keys, mayor gave me that to the city, bitch please
Me and Foxx in the drop, like Thelma and Louise
Pussy wetter than a deep sea diver
From the streets to the bedroom, Kimmy is a rider

[Hook: Lil' Kim & Tiffany Foxx]
Better watch what you say to me
Cause being broke don't relate to me
Like a dick I'm in these bitches heads
Allow me to reintroduce myself

[Verse 3: Tiffany Foxx]
The names Foxx, only fuck with the top notch
The pitch hard from the mount like the white sox
These niggas bugging me, I need a fly swat
Easter clean, padded leather with the white socks
Still getting em cutting em birds, over to the white socks
Drugs, all I needs a spoon and the right pot
Thugs, all I need is goons and the right plot
Rather get this beat now than get this beat when the mic stop
Fish scaled on the same porch as pig tails
Sea shore, sea shells, guess I did well
Vanquish, caramel, with the big wheels
First class, leer jet to the hotel
Rude top, beaut heavenly, giving them hoes hell
En-route in seventy, get to a wholesale
Even without bail, still I won't tell
And I creep these hoes, don't need a doorbell

[Hook: Lil' Kim & Tiffany Foxx]
Better watch what you say to me
Cause being broke don't relate to me
Like a dick I'm in these bitches heads
Allow me to reintroduce myself
