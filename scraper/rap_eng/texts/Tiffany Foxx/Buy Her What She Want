[Hook: Tiffany Foxx & Chubbie Baby]
Buy her what she want
I ain't saying I'm a gold digger
Buy her what she want
But I ain't fucking with no broke nigga
Buy her what she want
This for all my fucking goal diggers
Buy her what she want

[Post-Hook: Tiffany Foxx & Chubbie Baby]
I want all this (buy her what she want)
I want all this (I buy her what she want)
I want all this
All this, I want all this, I want all this
All this, I want all this (buy her what she want)
I want all this
All this, I want all this (buy her what she want)
I want all this

[Verse 1: Tiffany Foxx]
[?] CÃ©line bags
My crew bad, popping new tags
Pull up in that new jet
But I don't know where my roof at
Since I got my Porsche
Don't know where my keys at
But I ain't mad, my ass fast
Black [?], my cash fast
Just a bad bitch from the Mid West
[?]
Crack, cocaine, pray on the hopeless
I like lillies, but I put you on a little test
Flower, my money is power
[?]
Pussy so wet like you took a shower
Got bitches in check like it's [?]
I'm the shit, I ain't got no [?]
Foreign and you think I'll put my toe in
Broke niggas [?]
Just sold out a show in [?]
I squeeze your bitch, I'm balling
If you ain't talking money, why you calling?
And I stay on this [?]
Bought me a coupe that you can't fit four in

[Hook: Tiffany Foxx & Chubbie Baby]
Buy her what she want
I ain't saying I'm a gold digger
Buy her what she want
But I ain't fucking with no broke nigga
Buy her what she want
This for all my fucking goal diggers
Buy her what she want

[Post-Hook: Tiffany Foxx & Chubbie Baby]
I want all this (buy her what she want)
I want all this (I buy her what she want)
I want all this
All this, I want all this, I want all this
All this, I want all this (buy her what she want)
I want all this
All this, I want all this (buy her what she want)
I want all this
