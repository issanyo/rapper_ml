Shawty my desert, lick her whole body up
Shawty my desert, lick her whole body up
Shawty my desert, lick her whole body up
Shawty my desert, lick her whole body up
Shawty my desert, lick her whole body up
Shawty my desert, lick her whole body up

Girl, you're looking like a menu
Everything on you looks good to me
You make me wanna read you
Tell me what is your specialty

Can I get a preview?
A sample, a taste, what you got on me?
I got a hunger for you
Craving the days I'm yours, oh baby

[Hook]
Shawty my desert, lick her whole body up
Shawty my desert, lick her whole body up
I'll be your desert, lick my whole body up
I'll be your desert, lick my whole body up

Can I get that? Can I get that? Can I get that?
Maybe some of that?
Girl, what you're doing got me
Girl, let me lick you up and down
Can I get that? Can I get that? Can I get that?
Maybe some of that?
Girl, what you're doing got me
Don't you say "stop"

[Hook]

What's your recipe, girl?
Addicted to your ingredients
I wanna tear the wrapper off
'Cause you're sweet like chocolate, with a cherry set

Maybe we can mix it up
Take you plus me, skip treats to cause three
Baby, let me heat it up
You're the only flavour that tastes good to me

[Hook]

Can I get that? Can I get that? Can I get that?
Maybe some of that?
Girl, what you're doing got me
Girl, let me lick you up and down
Can I get that? Can I get that? Can I get that?
Maybe some of that?
Girl, what you're doing got me
Don't you say "stop"
