[Intro: Tiffany Foxx]
(Twisted, twisted)
Like dawg!
I don't even know what happened last night
I mean, we mixed the Cîroc, the rosé Moët
(Twisted, twisted, twisted)
The orange juice?
(Twisted, twisted, twisted)
I'm so fucked up
I'm at home but my car is at your house

[Verse 1: Tiffany Foxx]
I'm T. Foxx
Call me black goldie locks
White hair, red lipstick, fat ass
Casper the ghost for the drop
Diamonds for the rocks
No sucking no lollipop
Killing these hoes, don't call the cops
Yellow tape on my Giuseppe box
Pussy wanna lay upon it
Asking me could he put the head up on it
Dipshit cotton my head upon
And I might only head upon it
Bad bitch all in my genetics
That means swag in my genes
In the morning I do calisthenics
That's why I'm busting out my jeans
Loyal to truth it, I'm married to the game
I tied the knot
Decided to run for my dream
Grab my shoes and tied the knot
I'm from the Lou, everyone is a target
That's a daily shot
Dump the clot, dump the clot
Holy water's my daily shot

[Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Like, yeah, the money keep on flowing
It's stackin up so high my nigga we could barely throw it
Bottle after bottle, baby, we can barely pour it
If we taking that rosé and then we mix it with that Moët

[Post-Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Now we twisted, twisted, twisted
(I can barely feel my face)
Twisted, twisted, twisted
(I'm drowning in the 808)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Im g'd up, like the monogram on my Gucci belt
So icy, I guess that make me Gucci girl
I'm at the mall, 2 new jags
One I push, the other for my shopping bags
Queen of hearts and that ace of spades
Queen of diamonds twerking on the stage
I'm fucked up, got my shades on
So these jokers can't read my poker face
Keep throwing racks on me, all I see is dollar signs
He asked my zodiac, I told the nigga a dollar sign
This is helluva night, mixin dark with the light
Wait, I'm in a black phantom
But where's mines 'cause mines all white
This nigga been following me all night
Please get this thirsty ass nigga a Sprite
He wanna UFC this kitty
Beat the beat the pussy up like Kimbo Slice
Yeah, this molly got me going
My hormones is jumpin, I-I-I just can't control it
My tittie hanging out, man, and I ain't even know it
I'm so turnt up, I-I-I just can't control it!

[Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Like, yeah, the money keep on flowing
It's stackin up so high my nigga we could barely throw it
Bottle after bottle, baby, we can barely pour it
If we taking that rosé and then we mix it with that Moët

[Post-Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Now we twisted, twisted, twisted
(I can barely feel my face)
Twisted, twisted, twisted
(I'm drowning in the 808)

[Bridge: Tiffany Foxx]
Where the fuck my keys at? Where the hell my shoes go?
Where the fuck my bag at? Where the hell’s my iPhone?
Im twisted, twisted, twisted
I can barely feel my face
Where the fuck is Brooke at? where the hell did Kim go?
It’s going down, I was pouring shots
But where the hell did Miley go?
I’m twisted, twisted, twisted
I can barely feel my face

[Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Yeah, the money keep on flowing
It's stackin up so high my nigga we could barely throw it
Bottle after bottle, baby, we can barely pour it
If we taking that rosé and then we mix it with that Moët

[Post-Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Now we twisted, twisted, twisted
(I can barely feel my face)
Twisted, twisted, twisted
(I'm drowning in the 808)
