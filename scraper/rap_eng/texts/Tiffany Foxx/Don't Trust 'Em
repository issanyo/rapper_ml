[Intro]
K Classic

[Hook]
You gon' make me get a side nigga
(I don't trust 'em, I don't trust 'em)
'Cause I can see 'em by your side, nigga
(I don't trust 'em, I don't trust 'em)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I love him but he know that I don't trust him
I don't trust 'em
(I don't trust 'em, I don't trust 'em)
Trust a nigga as far as I can see him
(I don't trust 'em, I don't trust 'em)
Tell me different but I don't believe him
(I don't trust 'em, I don't trust 'em)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I love him but he know that I don't trust him
Tell me different but I don't believe him
(I don't trust 'em, I don't trust 'em)
Tell me different but I don't believe him

[Verse 1]
These bitches be like "my heart is so broken"
[?]
I just be mad when your bank is not open
Married to money, you hoes not allowed
Niggas be wastin' your time
Fuckin' the penny or dime
There's anything, anything
I'll pay it, no never mind
No nigga is up for mine
He got a mind of his own
I want him, I need him, I wanna say I love him
No, never mind
These niggas be out with these hoes when they low
And they all be tellin' lies
Went all trough his phone
I found what I already know
So I keep it G
When they day I leave he gon' be broke
I promised myself I won't be a sadistic
With my new nigga [?]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I used to be loyal, I used to be down
Put up my house to bail you out
Heard you be with she when I'm outta town
So naive but look at me now

[Verse 2]
Look at me now, boy
Home I come around, boy
Sittin' next nigga that's fuckin' your bitch
Don't let it get you down, boy
These niggas dawgs that's frontin'
Like "damn, boy" "when I come around, boy"
Make you get sick to your stomach
'Cause you messed up with the woman
Get your shit up off the ground, boy
'Cause I tried to, been lied to and I don't like it
Had that nigga, he gon' do the same to you 'cause I'm psychic
'Cause I know
Me and my bitches don't want bein' pissed off
'Cause it ain't none [?]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Trust a nigga as far as I can see him
