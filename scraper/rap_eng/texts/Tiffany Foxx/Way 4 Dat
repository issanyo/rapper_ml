Wanna fuck that bitch

[Verse 1: Jung Costa]
40 grand on the wrist
5 bands on the pants and the kicks
[?] dance in the shit
Out the window and the roofs
I can play with the Knicks
[?] I'm in Japan with your bitch
Ain't not on FaceTime 'cause she playing with the dick
[?]
Got me feeling like Drake, bitches playing in the 6
Flip phone dripping [?]
I show a nigga how to get a brick off
In the hood nigga, we don't [?]
Laid back, Maybach, nigga Rick Ross
100 grand on the floor, I made her wait for that
Put the Rolly on her wrist, it was made for that
Boss up with your bitch, never lay with that
If the pussy real good, will you pay for that?

[Verse 2: Tiffany Foxx]
Porsche Panamera (Fox!)
But I got the raven black
My man, my money, my mom, my paper
Yeah, I don't play with that
Bitches talk a lot of shit
But where your paper at?
Niggas ain't got enough money to fuck with Foxx
And I'm OK with that
Bitches watch me, need to watch TV
Comcast bitch, where your cable at?
BET, MTV, VH1
I been on all of that
Givenchy with the Balmain, King, Queen Bitch
Live like I move cocaine
Yeah, I got the propane and I'm from the Lou
M-A-G gunplay, we with all of that
