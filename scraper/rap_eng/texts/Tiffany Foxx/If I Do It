[Intro]
Buy a bitch a bag or somethin'
You a trick anyway so
Buy a bitch a bag or somethin'
That's what you do anyway so
Nigga, buy a bitch a bag or somethin'
You a trick anyway so

[Verse 1]
I once knew a trick from Centreville
Sucks on the clit, does it real well
He love the way it tastes, like they way it smell
So he bought me Gucci then he bought Chanel
He knew I was the shit, such a pretty bitch
Ain't got no job but I got my own shit
He took me down to Memphis, all up in the trenches
I was rollin' kush, doin' shit I cannot mention
Started in the kitchen knockin' over dishes
Hit it from the back, nigga pullin' on my inches
Grabbin' on my throat, damn, this nigga vicious
All up in my gut like it's 10 inches
Oooh, I like that
Boy, don't keep me waitin', fly me right back
Oooh, I like that
Boy, don't keep me waitin', fly me right back

[Pre-Hook]
Representin' for the light-skinned girls
Representin' for the dark-skinned girls
Poppin' shit with my light-skinned girls
Poppin' shit with my dark-skinned girls

[Hook]
If I do it will you spend it?
If I do it will you spend it?
If I do it will you spend it?
Will you spend it if I do it?
If I do it will you spend it?
If I do it will you spend it?
If I do it will you spend it?
Will you spend it if I do it?

[Verse 2]
Now I'm back up in the city, textin' Brooke to come and get me
I was fuckin' with this nigga, he left hickies on my titties
We were sippin' on the Henny, started fuckin' with no jimmy
If I end up gettin' pregnant, I'ma name that baby Jimmy
8 missed calls on the boost, 80 grand for the coupe
Crocodile on the boots, see the arch from the roof
If I order fried rice made a stop at Bing Lou
East, West, Southside, Northside, what it do
So I ran into his BM 'bout 8:30 pm
She was kinda mad, I get the bag she gets per diem
Ran up on my BM, talkin' 'bout some DMs
Girl go pop that shit when when it's your turn to go and see him
'Cause you don't want no smoke with a wildfire
Leave that ass flat like a down tire
Bitches know I'm hotter than a bonfire
Send that nigga back, bitch when I'm tired

[Pre-Hook]
Representin' for the light-skinned girls
Representin' for the dark-skinned girls
Poppin' shit with my light-skinned girls
Poppin' shit with my dark-skinned girls

[Hook]
If I do it will you spend it?
If I do it will you spend it?
If I do it will you spend it?
Will you spend it if I do it?
If I do it will you spend it?
If I do it will you spend it?
If I do it will you spend it?
Will you spend it if I do it?

[Outro]
Buy a bitch a bag or somethin'
You a trick anyway so
Buy a bitch a bag or somethin'
That's what you do anyway so
Nigga, buy a bitch a bag or somethin'
You a trick anyway so
