Now we been up till then sun came up
(Where my panties at?)
Can't mention all the places we touched
(Where my panties at?)
But I can't find my panties
Now I can't find my panties

[Verse 1]
Hey ladies, ya know we all been through it
Can't find our panties after we been screwin'
It don't make sense but I'm common to it
Oh, they always accidents, so do I try to do it
Keep the pants on the cat then hit it from the back
'Cause he the number one sprinter and do read my lips
Now that will tell you where they help you find your panties at
'Cause if he is a quckie, don't take of your vickies
For what? You can just move 'em to the side
And they ain't even gonna have a chance to hide
If I find them kinda quick then I'm not satisfied
He true to rock the boat, eventually I find 'em on the side

Now we been up till then sun came up

[Verse 2]
To all my ladies and my bitches
Throw your motherfuckin' panties in the air
'Cause if y'all gon' fuck
And he handle his business
Might as well throw 'em out
'Cause they don't come up missin'
From the door to the floor
To the headboarder, under the covers
On the bed by the Magnum rubbers
Means that was good love
And get this feeling in your stomach
Wanna leave 'em on purpose
To see if you're the only one
That man know his spot
And even knows his spot
If he a thrill ass nigga
Then he know your plot
And he might help your find 'em
Better crack your face
If you wanna be safe
Just leave 'em in a pillowcase

[Hook]
Now we been up till then sun came up

Now I can't find my panties

[Verse 3]
Look, I'm the type of chick that like to [?]
Grab me by my shoulders, tingle me all over
From the front to the back of the Rover
Workin' my body like a no limit soldier
I thought I told you don't got too fast
But still rock me fella like you Damon Dash
I gotta ask where the hell my panties at
Back at the red light is where I seen them last
When I was on your lap I seen them on the dash
They must've fell down when you put your foot on the gas
But I don't care, you can keep 'em as a souvenir
'Cause I'm sure by the mornin' I'm gonna lose another pair

[Hook]
Now we been up till then sun came up
(Where my panties at?)
Can't mention all the places we touched
(Where my panties at?)
But I can't find my panties
Now I can't find my panties
