This for my Goaldiggers
Day one
Been there for me since day one
Bosses take losses

White beater red chucks rep the lou no matter what
When they play this in the club goal bottles throw it up
Body, looking like a supermodel
Pussy so wet need a pair of goggles
Im so fly Ms? Salad bar lettuce in my avocado
I remember when ppl didn't know my name
But now run the record baby catch me somewhere in the clouds
Grinding like i ain't got shit
Whit the gun in ya hand still wouldn't cock it
And i dont see u hoes im in the cock pit
Only king foxx get of my cock bitch!
