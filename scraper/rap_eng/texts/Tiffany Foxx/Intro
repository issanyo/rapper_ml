[Intro]
Fear! I love the smell of fear!
Guards! Make room for my lions!
They wanna take a walk
Hear ye, hear ye!
Commoners, peasants and country men
Bow down to your new king
Thou has had the privilege
To witness the daughter of fire
Bow down and give beg to the disease vermin
You swine, you dirty dogs
Her royal highness, King Foxx has arrived!

[Verse 1]
Murder what she wrote
Bitch, hop off the boat
I oversee you
Whole team is first class
I just shot the coach
Plumped and shot the coast
East and west
Middlewest is way up best
Just lead the blood on my hands like a Crip
Bitch, I know you see it
Spaz in this bitch like back in the day
The ass in this bitch like packing for days
Fowlpack burning million packed in the day
So I sell shit, but be back in the way
'Cause I'm back in your face 'cause I piss and debate
You hoes ain't living, y'all passing away
In a six foot ditch with your ass in delay
In the panamara coach where you're passing the wake
Nigga, I'm a season goya
Turn a grown man to a boy, ya
When it coming to the money, I'm loyal
And it turns out that the hota
Go, suicide door
Cut from the wrist to the suicide motto
I'm the main bitch, I don't ever do chores
Rollie on the wrist, I ain't got time to play with you hoes
