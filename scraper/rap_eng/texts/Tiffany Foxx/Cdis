[Intro]
Rise to your feet
And pay homage to the rulers
Tiffany Foxx (Sonny Digital)
King Foxx that is
Y'all motherfuckers waiting

[Hook]
You see this shit
This nigga's tough, these niggas broke
You see this shit
These niggas talk more than hoes
You see this shit
You see this shit, you see this shit
You see this shit, you see this shit
You see this shit, you see this shit
This foreign thang is what he drove
You see this shit
I hit Versace and [?]
You see this shit
You see this shit, you see this shit
You see this shit, you see this shit
You see this shit, you see this shit

[Verse 1]
You see this shit? You see this shit?
Come see this shit
This Balmain, not Adidas, bitch
Conceited shit
You all lame, wanna be this bitch
'Cause we this rich
Go eat a dick
Just bought the fox, no PETA, bitch
I'm captain, hoe, I laugh at hoes
While I'm laughing, hoe
You lacking, hoe, 'cause your act is low
Must be slacking, hoe
Niggas ain't getting no cream
Must be lactose
Like a nigga with a sad squad team
Yeah, we pack, hoe
Pap smear, pussy getting checked
I ain't talking about a doctor [?]
Talk about stones while you're on your way home
And I'm on my way to Rome, I'm [?]
And I'm back out
Killing hoes with no mack out
With that MAC out
Leave red on your lips like Ruby Woo, no [?] out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Counting the money he dropped off
In my new [?] with my top off
End up pissing [?] off
I'ma end up knocking your top off
Never be rocking no knock off
[?] they outlaws
[?]
Conceited shit nigga, I ball
[?]
Tell [?] bring the chef
In the kitchen cooking yams
No thanksgiving on the shelf
See them niggas you help
Them niggas wanna [?]
When the time got [?], nigga kill yourself
Them big boy pants
Where the fuck your belts?
[?]
Don't name no names
'Cause this bitch got fame
All this house and chains
[?] I can see your fangs
Never can feel no pain
Got no brains, call her Kurt Cobain
Chop her up like [?]
And the bitch go bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Haven't seen this
You're lying, I know you haven't seen it
You broke bitches can't believe it
So, I know you haven't seen it
