[Intro]
It's kinda creepy, ain't it?
I'm comin' to take everythin' that's mine
It's trap
Biatch!

[Hook]
Back in this bitch like I'm Kim J. Un
And you look like Donald Trump
So I'm killin' everythin', anythin', everyone
It's like a war zone where I'm from
And we takin' everythin'
Killin' anythin', everythin', yes, so you better run

State of emergency

[Verse 1]
Niggas tip-toein' like some ballerinas
I be speakin' Spanish in my Valentinos
Niggas fuckin' niggas, Bobby Valentino's
Playin', actin' gangsta like they Al Pacino
Money sittin' in the pocket, Dan Marino
I'ma kill 'em with the bills, Tarantino
We be set trippin' like we in the Beno
Got the white bra like I'm Jay and Nino
Fuck fuckin' niggas, I'm fuckin' these millions
Evictin' yo ass, get the fuck out yo feelings
First when they get it, the truck with no ceiling
Choppas got pockets [?] burn down your village
Last nigga told me I wouldn't be shit
When I got his tired ass tied up
Wearin' cement shoes, now he sea sick
I'm in Cabo Cabo gettin' sea sick
Like I'm doin' magic, all these tricks
If the fans calm I ain't see shit
Got the hammer wavin' at C6, nigga, ah!

[Hook]
Back in this bitch like I'm Kim J. Un

[Verse 2]
Balenciaga, Vera Wang
Prada, Prada, Balmain
[?]
[?] watch me play
Michael Jackson with the dance moves (he-hee)
Lamborghini, flow's bamboo
You know I'ma act a damn fool
Ten thousand dollars on some damn shoes
All these haters wanna dare me
The bad bitches understand me (goal diggers)
Ass lookin' like I'm Bambi
Yo momma shoulda took a plan B
Savage like my name is Randy
LA niggas wanna rent me
Bitch wanna be down like she Brandy
But I do this shit for the family
Fuck fuckin' niggas, I'm fuckin' these millions (get money)
Evictin' yo ass, get the fuck out yo feelings (get out)
First when they get it, the truck with no ceiling
Choppas got pockets [?] burn down your village
