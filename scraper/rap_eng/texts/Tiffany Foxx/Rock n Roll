[Hook]
Gotta have a lot of dough
Bad bitches love drug dealers on the low
Diamonds freezin', catch a cold
Got these niggas spendin' bands, call it rock n roll
Gotta have a lot of dough
Bad bitches love drug dealers on the low
Diamonds freezin', catch a cold
Got these niggas spendin' bands, call it rock n roll

[Verse 1]
Hey, wassup doc, I gotta thank for some carats
Put the pussy on him, say it feel like magic
All them chains on, that's them nigga who be rappin'
They ain't got no money, want the niggas who be trappin'
Me and Ben Franklin so in love, gon' steady
Bitches couldn't even see me [?]
Louboutin the cross, so much Christian, Mary, Mary
[?] gettin' Thierry
Ride upon them bitches, snatch a nigga like I'm diva
So much money on the floor [?]
Head honcho, bands off set, takin' off, migos
I don't fuck with the [?] niggas gotta be illegal
So let me see that that money tree
Come through with a donation that will make me rich
Wanna see me blow a kiss?
Put it back on my ass and watch this pussy drip

[Hook]
Gotta have a lot of dough
Bad bitches love drug dealers on the low

Got these niggas spendin' bands, call it rock n roll
Gotta have a lot of dough
Bad bitches love drug dealers on the low
Diamonds freezin', catch a cold
Got these niggas spendin' bands, call it rock n roll
