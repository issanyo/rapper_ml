[Intro: Tiffany Foxx]
[?]
I decorated the crib that you stay in
Got you on no budget, with me he was payin'
You a fan

[Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Ain't none of them needed
They're my x-bae, take that
Left him on read, don't text back
Still love me and you hate that
If I want that nigga I take that
X-bae, take that
Left him on read, don't text back
Still love me and you hate that
Ain't none of them needed

They're my ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex
Ain't none of them needed
They're my ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex
Ain't none of them needed
They're my-

[Verse 1: Tiffany Foxx]
Laid back, Maybach, hair long, jet black
Got La Perla layin' where the tits at
Got the Himalayas where the wrist at
I'ma always know where the cash at
See your hair nail money [?]
Stalk him on live and he told you not to post that
We was alway kissin' on my Snapchat
Listen, I do not play with you hoes
Nothin' to say to you hoes
Y'all are a joke
I'm on a ship when they out [?]
[?]
I clean 'em out like I made round with my money
That's so much green like I made [?]
I don't understand how ya OK with no money
Too busy stalkin' my 'gram
Don't that make you a fan?
You not a follow-up, you just a follower
Happy to live in my past

[Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
They're my x-bae, take that
Left him on read, don't text back
Still love me and you hate that
If I want that nigga I take
X-bae, take that
Left him on read, don't text back
Still love me and you hate that
Ain't none of them needed

They're my ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex
