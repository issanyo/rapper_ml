[Hook]
This is for my pretty bitches, country to the city bitches
Whole crew fly, fuckin' with no silly bitches
Where the bag at? Before you get the kitty bitches
Talkin' all this shit but I can't really feel it, bitches

30 inches in my hair
Money baby, I don't share
Fuckin' him, I don't care
Same shoe, got three pair
Fox all in my fur
Diamonds, they so clear
Winnin', so unfair

[Verse 1]
Stripper bitches, scammers to commited bitches
Take your nigga, whipped out, no, no feelings bitches
Rent they pay 'cause I gotta have them bundles, bitches
Gucci, Louboutin, Prada, Balmain, and Fendi, bitches
In the kitchen, watchin' baby flip them chickens
All this trappin' reason why my ceiling missin'
Suck his dick like my motherfuckin' teeth is missin'
Watchin' SpongeBob while he eat my kitty kitty

[Verse 2]
Been about my dolla, bank account, I got them commas
Bitches talkin' all this shit, when they see me want no problems
I'ma keep these bitches mad and I put that on my momma
Diamonds dance around my neck and I put that on my collar
Fried rice sweet and sour, in LA I'm at Katana
With them killers and them robbers, private jet in my pajamas
And yeah, I'm from the Lou, in the hood we got them [?]
Now I spend my summers in Zimbabwe with lions and llamas
