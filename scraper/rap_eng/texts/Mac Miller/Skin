[Intro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
You hide your skin like you're shy or there's something wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So finally I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones
You want it don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean

[Bridge]
It's okay that you like it babe (I like it baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (this way)
To live this way baby baby (ooh baby)
Chillin' with the AC

[Chorus]
That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart

[Verse 2]
Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine, yeah; too divine
Who am I? Well; I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Ooh-He-Blew-Your-Mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make you waterfall
Girl you my painting, you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Just I've been way too hot for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was; man I'm broke
But now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what it's gon' be

[Chorus]
That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart

[Outro]
These hoes
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
