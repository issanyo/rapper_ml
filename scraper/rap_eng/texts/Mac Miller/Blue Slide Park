[Verse 1]
Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades
Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varying from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on their cooter
Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doing shows daily call me John Stewart
So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred g's so none of y'all can fuck with me
Yeah I said it publically so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker

[Interlude]
Hold up Jerm let me spit the second

[Verse 2]
Hey yo I breeze past haters in the E-class quickly
In deep, did a hundred songs and thatâ€™s this week
Shit keeps goin' on and on
We just tryna go bananas like it's Donkey Kong
Yeah, on my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gonna see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' til the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holla at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy with an irregular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike
Who knew that I can turn turn sound into somethin' so cool
Fresh kids, see me I'm bustin' the moves
Coming in soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when money in the room
Ohh, I switch flows switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition

[Outro]
This is Blue Slide Park
