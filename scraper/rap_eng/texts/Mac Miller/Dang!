[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on losing you over complications
Gone too soon, wait! We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto, dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losing you, you, you, you, you, you
I can't keep on losing you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 1: Mac Miller &  Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
How many mistakes do it take 'til you leave
When I'm left with my hand on my face all red
In the face looking at you like ("Wait!")
I know I ain't a saint, if it ain't too late, well...
(I can't keep on losing you) I run away so fast
But my heart like gold, but it break like glass
Know my shit get old when I act so young
Baby you so cold, never have no sun
You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'mma give you some
Make you feel like woo, when I hit that drum
Yeah the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
You way too drunk, you don't know what I'm saying
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night, I keep you waiting
You say you don't care, is what you saying
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fighting, we be reuniting
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited
God, the devil, who is who?
Tryna get through to you because...

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on losing you over complications
Gone too soon, wait! We was just hangin'
I guess I need to hold onto, dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losing you

[Post-Hook: Mac Miller]
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Well, you can't go away girl, I'mma need you
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy league school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguing about who ain't giving who attention
Starting up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
To keep on holding on to your trust
I know you don't want nothin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much
Fuck 'em all, let's be us, summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keeping me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it's seems inviting, trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me, girl

[Interlude: Anderson .Paak &  Mac Miller]
I can't keep on losing you
Where the hell you going?
Where you taking this trip to?
Wait!
Don't move, don't stay, too
I can't keep on losing you
Where the hell you going?
Wait!
Where the hell you going?

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on losing you over complications

[Post-Hook: Mac Miller]
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
Can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing you
