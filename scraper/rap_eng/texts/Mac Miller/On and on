[Intro]
Scuse me son, can I see your identification?

[Hook]
I wanna walk into the mall
Tell the man I'll take it all
Drop it from the roof top who’s gonna break my fall
I think I am going on and on forever
I wanna walk into the store
Buy everything and more
Travel around the world
To places I ain’t been before
I think might go on and on forever
I this this could go on and on forever

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I’ve been riding in my car with the music all the way up
See me shining and I'm a star, take a picture see you later
I’ve been dreaming some baby shit and every time I wake up
Gotta head back to reality but reality is greater
Than you could ever imagine you say that you cooler
But im better at rapping, I'm forever the captain
I'll be making music out of joy stick thumbs up
Joint lit y'all get what the point is
Baby I'm here I ain't going nowhere
All these haters say im faking but I really don't care

[Bridge]
Got my teammate right beside me you know where to find me
Burgh representative I need y'all behind me cause...

[Hook]
I wanna walk into the mall
Tell the man I'll take it all
Drop it from the roof top who’s gonna break my fall
I think I am going on and on forever
I wanna walk into the store
Buy everything and more
Travel around the world
Places I ain’t been before
I think might go on and on forever
I this this could go on and on forever

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
One day im gonna get mines too
And I think that's sometime's soon
Whatever you got in your crib, I'm gonna get it times two
If I win or lose what the fuck I gotta prove
I've been living out my dream everything I saw came true
Travel on a tour bus for screaming fans
Got a stellar reputation girl be who I am
Im gonna be the man, son, connecting people everywhere
Like Samsung gotta shoot around the back alley oop and one
This the championship game you ready yo
You don't sound ready better scream it just to let 'em know

[Bridge]
My teammate right beside me
You know where to find me
Burgh representative I need y'all behind me

[Hook]
I wanna walk into the mall
Tell the man I'll take it all
Drop it from the roof top who’s gonna break my fall
I think I am going on and on forever
I wanna walk into the store
Buy everything and more
Travel around the world
Places I ain’t been before
I think might go on and on forever
I this this could go on and on forever
