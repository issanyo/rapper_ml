[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Get some brand new kicks, couple hundred on the jeans
I been spendin' all this money got me feelin' like a G
Hand me down gear, some shit you never seen
Droppin' three stacks now I'm so fresh so clean
See we never could of dreamed of
All of the shit me and my team does
Girls see me like damn you look good, now you cleaned up
Feelin' fresh got my teeth brushed
I'mma new kid been waitin' to do this
They hatin' up on my plate got some steak and it's Ruth Chris
Been feelin' like a true pimp biatch
It’s '05, I'm the Steelers, you the Seahawks
This weed I keep hittin' makin' me cough
The olly giant, i’m jack smokin' the bean stock
I get hoes in boat shoes, style I won’t lose
Welcome to the old school
Bitch

[Hook]
Now my clothes look cleaner and my kicks look fly
We be buyin' more reefer so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin' and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge but, I'mma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day their somethin' new to do
So I’ma keep on dreamin' hit snooze

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hit snooze, I ain't tryna wake up yet
I'mma keep on dreamin' be the straight up best
And i’m blessed, everyday and I’m gettin' straight up fresh
My homies like Mac damn you get your cake up yes
I did, that’s the life I live, I grind all day
High School sellin' mixtapes in the hallway
I bet they never thought I’d be this cool
Now they understand why I skipped school
Had my dreams wasn’t worried at all
That's why if I'm gettin' bored I go splurge at the mall
I got money, I got bitches
I got everything they dreamin' of and I ain't done shit yet
This major leagues big business
Used to have a wish list, now I just give gifts
Shit would make me happy
Here’s how to reach me, you can get at me

[Hook]
Now my clothes look cleaner and my kicks look fly
We be buyin' more reefer so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin' and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge but, I'mma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day their somethin' new to do
So I’ma keep on dreamin' hit snooze

When the fuck will I wake up (wake up)
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day there's somethin' new to do
So I'mma keep on dreamin' hit snooze

[Hook]
Now my clothes look cleaner and my kicks look fly
We be buyin' more reefer so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin' and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge but, I'mma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day their somethin' new to do
So I’ma keep on dreamin' hit snooze
