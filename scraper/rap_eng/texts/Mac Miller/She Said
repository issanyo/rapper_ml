[Intro]
Hold up, Yo Will your mom's calling
Can I uh, can I ignore the call
I can ignore it? Aight
I'm feelin' a lil' ill right now
And I don't mean ill like really cool and awesome
I mean like, I'm comin' down with a sickness

[Verse 1]
Well I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway
Listenin' to music, haven’t slept in like five days
I tried to take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend, though
'Cause, me, I get high, make music for a living
If that ain’t the best job, then give me your opinion
'Cause I love life, chillin' for the night, case of Bud Light
Small world for me, but you, you live a Bug's Life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think its make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine love it, grimier than rubbish
You softer then a Snuggie and you sweeter then a Sunkist
Never eatin' beets on your Doug shit
Come with all the swagger, but you lackin' all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school
Spendin' money, drinkin' liquor, naked girls up in my pool

[Hook]
Wake up in my bed, gettin’ head, she said
The act so cool but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes
Today a new day, a fresh start
If you didn’t make mistakes, you wouldn't get far
Life get hard, so we get high, you ain't shit till you try

[Verse 2]
Ay, yo, my herb smoke tasting like a Nerds rope
I'mma get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Something like a millionaire in training
Still my shit amazing, we jumpin' over puddles when it's raining
Planning on a tan, I’m in the sand
And we'll be jammin', make it bounce
While we dancing on the clouds until I’m landing in my house
Remember when my moms would hate me standing on the couch
But now I’m making so much money I start to lose count
I try and spend it quick, I got bills though
Yeah I’m only eighteen, I got skills though
Beats, Rhymes, Life, Tribe Called Chill Flow
You been rapping twenty-five years and you still broke
No disrespect, the riches is the art
I’m just mad at all these haters who was bitches from the start
We just do this 'cause we love it and it's setting us apart
We was already gone while you was only on your mark
