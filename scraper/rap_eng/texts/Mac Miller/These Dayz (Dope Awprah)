[Verse 1]
Light the weed, wish you would stay you have the right to leave
Its who I like to be, you say I may be losing sight of things, and I might agree
But we livin in a digital world, you told me you wasn't a material girl
Then I realized those don't exist freedom of the mind thats the only bliss
And they told me no but I did it, ain't got shit for these bitches
Living life with no limits, days becoming so different
Get money fuck hoes, when your eatin your stomach grows
Whos that love to know ?
Makin music cause I love to, you hatin on me sayin fuck you
Its simple but it means a lot, this is what I do, I dont need to talk

[Verse 2]
Ya I tried to do a lot of things, couldn't focus on everything
I think im really good at many things, phones calling that's the devils ring
Im not gonna answer that phone, im ready to go back home
Been on this road for so long, that all I do is sit and make sad songs
What the fuck happend to that nice kid that you knew when he releasd that mixtape called KIDS
And everybody thought that he would be so big, till he lost focus cause he got so sick
Of all the bulshit that they always do, tell you what you gotta do
Everybodys watching you, you just wanna scream an Awprah
I think I need to see a doctor

[Outro]
(Keep it moving, Keep it moving you know I got stuff to say, when will the world fuckin realize
I got something to say, im not finished, I ain't scared of nothing, this my motherfucking time
And I'mma do this shit cause I was meant to do this motherfucking shit. Yeah motherfu shit yeah uh!
The funny thing, the funny thing is, this song isn't just a song because I just dreamed of this song
In past days and I woke up and it was the future, its funny when the future is things you dreamed
Because you never understand what they mean at that time but then at the forward of motion of
Seconds and minutes and hours you finally realized that they were all secret messages
From people you don't know but you might of seen them in a past life or the life in the future
Or whatever the fuck this whole thing is that you will never figure out SO STOP TRYING!
