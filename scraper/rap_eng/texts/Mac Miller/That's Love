[Hook x2]
Cmon it ain't cool to make a love song
They lookin at me like theres something wrong
This ain't a song about cars and drugs
Even gangsta moutha fuckers fall in love

[Verse 1]
I got a girl who always trippin on these bitches who keep trying to come and holler
I dont bother with these groupies who just wanna chase the dollar
My everything, I got her, platinum and copper
We gonna stay together til one of us use a walker
She popular but I got her first, I tried she denied so I got to work
I gotta let her know the way her smile tend to grow
And at time we took that molly that shit had us on a roll
I disconnect, cordless feeling all distorted
Bored with the smorgasbord of all that horse shit
I bet she never thought id have her fall in love
Beauty or brain maybe she all of the above

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I know that every time I do something wrong
I can't just get away from it by making a song
Getting in these fights start taking too long
But if its what you wanna do then im playing along
Cause I know you love me though so I love you back
And some shit I do is fuckin wack
But you donâ€™t care about your hundred stacks
Shit you just want your fuckin bubby back
But im somewhere far way out on a tour
Livin it large its everything and more
My dream come true starts problems with you
You want me at home but im all on the move
When im back at the crib we gonna go on a cruise
My alarm goes off ima reach for the snooze
Nothing to say but so much to do
The second that we meet I was fallin for you

[Hook]
