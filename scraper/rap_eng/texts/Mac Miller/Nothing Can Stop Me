[Intro]
Eh yo Brody
I don't think they stoppin' us right now

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Nothing can stop me, I'm way too cocky
Turn you into chopped meat
In hockey, I'm Crosby - Sidney
All of y'all ain't fuckin' with me when I'm rackin'
Cause you're, you're Alex Ovetchkin
And I'm all sorts of nice
You the type to get strangled by a cordless mic
You think you buzzin' I ignore your hype
Freestylin' cause your ass can't afford to write
And me, well I do boast, but I'm too dope
Your whole crew chokes 'cause they know I chew most
Blue smoke and it's rolled in a cigar
Your girl won't let me hit 'cause she know that I'm a star
You act and can't spit, trapped in sandpits
You scruffy as a mutt, rockin' hats with dandruff
I wrote a whole zip, blow it in the air
I spit cancer, now you losin' all your hair

[Hook: Mac Miller, (Yung Brody)]
I stand strong, nothing gone stop me
We got the verses, Big Jerm got the hot beat
We gone blow, bought to let it go
Eh yo Brody, you need to let 'em know

I stand strong, nothing gone stop me
We got the verses, Big Jerm got the hot beat
We gone blow, bought to let it go
(Eh yo Mac), you need to let 'em know

[Verse 2: Yung Brody]
Eh yo Mac, listen
Cops tryna knock me, no one can stop me niggas
Look a little sloppy, I'm swinging like Rocky
Strapped like an armed robbery, I'm robbin'
[?]The locksmith[?]
I'm arrogant [?]athlete[?]
Ride bitches like jockeys
Quicker than fast, gettin' rid of this cash
Chopper in hand just to split your fitted in half
I'm hungover bent, plus a hundred percent
Nice Catholic boy so I cooked your mother for lent
Rich nigga shit, yeah, like I'm listening to Gucci
Pop three shells, leave 'em fizzin' like a roofie
Man I'm just a [?]
And I'm coming through next
Pushing numbers like 1-800-COLLECT
Yah

[Hook: Mac Miller, (Yung Brody)]
I stand strong, nothing gone stop me
We got the verses, Big Jerm got the hot beat
We gone blow, bought to let it go
Eh yo Brody, you need to let 'em know

I stand strong, nothing gone stop me
We got the verses, Big Jerm got the hot beat
We gone blow, bought to let it go
(Eh yo Mac), you need to let 'em know
