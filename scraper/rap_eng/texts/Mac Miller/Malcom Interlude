[Intro]
Yeah, uhm..yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Okay-alright, okay-alright
Yeah..

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah I spend, my nights working and I'm quite certain
If the right person come across me then I might hurt her
This the-the white sermon, and I ain't talking Erick
These rappers is my sons I'm the shittiest of parents
This just another suicide lullaby
You don't get the truth here we only summarize
The facts ain't nothing we should publicize
Throw the lightning bolts my bitch got the thunder thighs
It's young Zeus with it
Throw the blunt in the circle playing duck, duck, goose with it, too prolific
Lot of people after the bread, me I'mma rap when Im Dead, tell them shoot me in the back of the head

[Bridge:]
Man with no face
..yeah, man with no face, uhm
Man with no face
Yea.. yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Unstable head, fillin' up with raps
Whiskey in my flask shit you didn't have to ask
There's making judgements but they didn't know the half
I ain't Schoolboy Q bitch, I didn't go to class
Your bitch pussy lips is on my 'stache
I see these new rappers and, all I do is laugh
Rap sabotage, young Macintosh
Funny money like I was buddies with Judd Apatow
Yeah, the raps is hard but the pack is raw
I'm Old Jewish homie, chillin' playing racquetball
And it's all good after all
And it's all good after all
Yeah, man with no face
Man with no face
