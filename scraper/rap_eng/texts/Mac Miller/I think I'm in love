I think I'm in love, and I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love, cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love, but she probably ain't in love with me
I think I'm in love, so I guess we'll have to see

Look, there's just something about her caramel skin
And how that chest look in every single bra she in
And got me with her every single day out the week
We don't even hit the streets we just stay in the sheets
Those brown eyes got me trapped
Kiss her on her stomach when she lie on her back
She got class, cry and she laugh
A dime with a ass drinking wine by the glass
No other girl can make me hers
It's whoever wanna take me first
And she grabbed me wouldn't let me go
Usually your heart like an Eskimo, cold
But she said there's something about me
That she don't want no loving without me
Skin so soft like I'm touching some downy
Girl I think I'm in love

I think I'm in love, and I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love, cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love, but she probably ain't in love with me
I think I'm in love, so I guess we'll have to see

Look, check my phone always text me when she wake up
Sex is real great always messing up her make up
No clothes on, loving to a slow song
Everybody telling us, this thing we have is so wrong
And she don't care whatever goes on
Plus she's best friends with my mom
Keep a journal, you all know the story though
The superficial type, love her horoscopes
And I'm a Capricorn, that she ain't never had before
Her ex hates me cause he ain't me that's for sure
She got this look she give that send him running
She so stunning, got my heart jumping
And my mind is all twisted
Her lips is delicious for kisses
I got her heart on my wish list
Manager, give her the business

I think I'm in love, and I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love, cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love, but she probably ain't in love with me
I think I'm in love, so I guess we'll have to see

So this bitch really hit me like
How did you get so lucky?
You know what I said, I said
Bitch how did you get so lucky?
The fuck you think this is
Aye I treat my ladies right and that's for damn sure
