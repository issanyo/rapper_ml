[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause I’m so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause I’m so into you, into you-

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Baby, this a microphone checkup
What you getting into when you get up?
When I wake up early, I'm gonna text ya
Heard you got a man
Baby, I could do it better
And it really ain't the plan
I just want you to remember
How it was, how it is, how it could be
You could pull me in, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, you the sky
Looking up, you a high
You ain't never gotta lie
Cause it's more than just pussy
For the night, everything's alright
When you lay down, I'mma hit the lights
(If you say so)
And what's a life if you don't got me?
Give you what you want, what you need
(What you came for)
Hit me up when you're feeling blue
And I'll tell how I'm feeling too, so you know
I just want to get into you
Right here in the living room
Let's go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause I’m so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause I’m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Tell me what you came here for
Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause I’m so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause I’m so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
A little dangerous
A little dangerous, my baby
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause I’m so into you, into you, into you
