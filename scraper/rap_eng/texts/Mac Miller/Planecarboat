[Hook: Mac]
It’s a plane, it’s a car, it’s a boat
A planecarboat
A planecarboat
It’s a plane, it’s a car, it’s a boat
A planecarboat, a planecarboat
A planecarboat, a planecarboat

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Q, My pants gon sag forever, my top gon drop whenever
My gun gon shoot whatever, your ho gon love me bruh
Richard James rag, that pussy came fast
All of this Balmain, look like I fell out a plane
Walkin’ on water, impressin’ your daughter
Nothing to be it's a button for me
You got a key and them twentys is weak
Lookin’ like you done got that from the auction
When did you floss and (lose that shit)?
Not a scent, late for rent (broke bitch)
Your wife had an ass-clap contest
All the home girls tryna fuck me after
Give me head and turn me to a conscious rapper
I could tell you how the world begun ‘em
Virgin Mary slutty sister’s son
At birth I was meant to come
Take over the world and fornicate with girls and
Dog on these kitties' pearls, it was on point like Earl’s and
Shit is easy as 1 2 to the 3
Can’t make out what could it be
Look up up up it'll be

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac]
You can taste the wind ridin’ in the foreign with the titties out
Shit a million out, you just chillin’ at your bitch’s house
She on prescriptions trippin’ itchin’ for a different dick to mount
I’m givin’ out some dick to mouth resuscitation (breathe bitch)
The meanest genius, my style seamless I’m dope as fuck
Release my thesis, a piece on demons who spoke of love
Openly cope with emotion, only the strong survive
Along with my personified dog and my bionic eyes
Life a cartoon, turn it up, you probably heard of us
We murderers and you curious what the verdict was
Release me please or believe the evil is coming for ya
It’s me and a hundred warriors armed with swords and we sorcerers
Singin’ Gloria the morning that your abortion come
And so it goes, guess I'm in love I suppose
We fuckin’ these hoes, bitch I’mma jump on your bones
Reach in and pull out your soul like (Jesus)
