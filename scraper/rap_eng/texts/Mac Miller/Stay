Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Hook]
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

[Verse 1]
Yeah, hold up, wait a motherfuckin' second
I know you stressin',  you don't gotta keep me guessin'
I'm full of questions, in return I get the silent treatment
I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say
It's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'?
I could have a whole collection
Just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit

[Hook]
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

[Verse 2]
Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'mma go crazy, girl, you saved me
Meditate me, get me piece of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between her lines
Binge watched "Sopranos", made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come, see her freaky side, leavin' me behind

[Hook]
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while, babe

[Bridge]
The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Yeah, girl, the way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go, girl?

[Hook]
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
