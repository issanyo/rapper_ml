[Chorus] (x2)
Don't control yourself, this your life youuuuuu own it uh say you own it
So live it up, all that matters is thiiiiissss moment, uh so who's coming

[Verse 1]
I swear to God it's a dream come true
Everybody wonder what we gon do
Drinking a red cup pre-rolled ten blunts
When I go to sleep i don't think I'ma get up
Stay in bed to the afternoon
Ay cause you know what us rappers do
Get high get drunk then find some butt
Girl i don't wanna chase after you
