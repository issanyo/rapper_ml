Fuck love, all i got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum

[Hook: Drake]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything (uh huh), other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever (psyche!) on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up (when i hit her)
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up (then i quit her)
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up (roll a swisher)
And I say the same thing every single time (what)
I say, you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best (fuck you)
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fucking best

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I used to be a player who was searching for the one
Scared of being me because it was hurting me to love
But then i found something that i thought was real
You know the type of girl you could cop a meal for
See life is real good on the come up
I used to hit my lady with a text when the sun up, like what up
And i gave it all away just to fall
Now i'm waiting on the day when she call
Nah fuck that, because nowadays love is always lose
My heart's staying bruised if i'm giving it to you
So i'm a keep playing girls like they was a instrument
Trying to find the one is just ridiculous, i'm sick of it
Because i found out that every girl the same
They saying that they victims but they love to play the game
So i ain't feel ashamed for who i am
And love don't really drive me to do these jams
But i'll tell y'all everything i write about
All the ups and downs then the smiles and frowns
The good, bad, ugly, funny, and the money
The honeys, the grumpy, the hungry, whatever
Because my life has never been better
She can't break what's underneath the polo or my sweater
And that's my heart so fuck a heartbreak
This was just a little case of some heartache
