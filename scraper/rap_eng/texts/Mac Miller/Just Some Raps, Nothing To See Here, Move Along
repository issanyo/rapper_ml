[Verse]
It's the realness
City of the steel where the films is
Bill shit, balling like a smaller Josh Childress
I'm in the building, swagger on a million
Ill shit, in my bitch pussy like a drill-bit
MILFs get hunted down, pussy age like fine wine
Busy ol' clock in the dark, hard to find time
Spitting out iodine, rhyming on advance
Finna' burn ya, put the magnifying glass to all you ants
It's fire everywhere we go
Nobody watch you anymore like Drew Carey shows
Coming through your stereo, here to  cause the chaos
Bitches throwing bras on stage, hit 'em with paintballs, shit
"How'd you make out?"
Pretty good, got a mansion and a lakehouse
Millions off of PayPal, in the table at the steakhouse
Man, life is brilliant, militant, still the shit, killing off civilians
All these white rappers, I'ma never meet my children
That don't go for everybody, just the obvious ones
I'm on the boat, 'bout to eat when this tilapia come
I put the cocaine away, I'm drinking coffee a bunch
So what you in it for? Pretty sure it's more than a hunch
Wrote the formula for defeat in the form of ordering such
A warrior, I'm too much, watching porn on a camcorder while I'm ordering lunch, I give you more than enough, what?
The young heavyweight, rapping on detonate
Reading Hemingway, I been a leader, not a lemming, better get it straight
Fuck the system, bitch it's time for prison break
I been a great, shake it, got you falling just for timber's sake
And I ain't Justin Timberlake but I ain't much intimidating
Waiting patiently like can't you see, this shit is innovation
Been creating, standing on the roof, I feel the shingles breaking
I'm just spitting raps and y'all be single-making
Unlock ankle bracelets, paper chasing, in the pussy, procreation
Grand slam, load the bases, in the zone, bring 'em home
Been around the globe, done a hundred thousand show
Now I'm in album mode, everything I touch, it turn to valuable
Pittsburgh pile of snow, never gave a fuck about a slut
I pile-drive a hoe, wild lion tiger flow
Expert rhymer, never will I tire with these firestones
Might as well retire, go and find a home
