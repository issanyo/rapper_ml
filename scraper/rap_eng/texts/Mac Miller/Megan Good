Megan Good
Mary Tyler Moore
Maybe Melba Moore
Sing while Mya dances on the dance floor
Mary Jane, or even Mariah
Might be a queen
Or maybe Maybelline or Amerie or
Tina Marie or Melody, oh
I just chill 'em 18, y'all
All

[Geechi Suede]
Brass Barbies
Clashing glasses of scotch
White linin' off the mirror
8 ballin', calling grape schnapps
Pretty marble faces, they lookin' like mannequins
Movin' on the porcelain
Under the china ? is in
Show you're right, show you're right
Emeralds ultra bright
Rayon the rubies
Wrapping around the thunder night
They all wanna dance, they all wanna wave
We all wanna sip, we all wanna chase

[Sonny Cheeba]
You like fur
Rub across my collar, does it purr
All these pimps is hysterical
I think they full of scurr
Pass 'em by, I'm in the V twin
Ghostridin' the blur
And rejection don't occur
Call an officer or a fireman
Dr. Feelgood, operates on Angela's Winbush
Call me Sonny Kush, take a puff baby
If that don't get you high
Hit the cliff and hang glide
Love potion number 9
She gonna trip off every line

[Hook]

[Geechi Suede]
Ballerina ball
Beautific Betties get blown
Bar Mitzvah for the blacklist
Iced ceramic wrap her wrist
Watch the fur blitz
Around her curveness
Blue bottle bubbles break at the rim I'm concerned with
Hop your corset out the Corvette
Walk on the water 'til a wave
And then you soakin' wet
? the Lex, stretch the next
Celebrate the scene
Catwalk your Maybelline until it drip clean

[Mac Miller]
I got a bitch in my neighborhood
She looks like Meagan Good
And everyone around her holler at her
Tryin' to pay for pussy
She don't fuck with that
Or hit it 'til she hunch her back
She in love with that
That's why she in the kitchen baking cookies
Yeah, she a down ass bitch
She said I was her favorite once I found that clit
Saw Mary Tyler Moore at the vinyl store before
Said I'd put it in her ass if she about that shit, cause
I need a freak that like to be a geek
Roll blunts of good kush and them that we can chief
She a believer in Jesus, I thought I'd teach her 'bout evil
And have her givin' me head
While we in a room full of people, she nasty
Always talk to my dick, she have a conversation
Put some God in that pussy
That's a revelation
Yeah, I like to eat it if it's tasting good
Never spend a dollar on a bitch, even if it's
