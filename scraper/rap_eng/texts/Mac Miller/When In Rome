[Intro]
Yeah

Ha ha ha ha
Uh

[Verse 1]
All the freaks coming out when the sun down (Woo!)
Hating on it, I don't give a fuck now (Woo!)
Bad little bitch with her tongue out
Told her go long, it's a touchdown
Do this for the city and the state
Buster better bring me to the safe
Want it right now, I ain't really tryna wait (No)
Got me on trial but I'm beating that case
Motherfucker say it to my face
Say it to my face, motherfucker go and say it to my face
Trippin' now, everything straight
Rappers all wanna drop it now and they can't even get a date (Woo!)
Feeling great, I'm the man here
If you got a problem don't stand here
In the middle of the ocean, see the land here
In the helicopter, fuck it, we gon' land here

[Chorus]
When in, when in Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in Rome
When in, when in Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in Rome
When in, when in Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in Rome
When in, when in Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in Rome

[Verse 2]
Bad little bitch and her ass fat
I give it to the homie, he can have that (Take it!)
You talking that shit, where the racks at? (Woo!)
They keep you on the shelf where the racks at (Goddamn)
I'm just trying  to go and see the Colosseum (Woo!)
When I die they better build a mausoleum
I don't got time bitch I'm high, ain't a secret
I don't got time bitch I'm high, ain't a secret
Everybody and their mother wanna rap now
Tell 'em cut a check for a youngin', and I'ma cash out
Walking in the back door to the pat down now
On my shit, you can borrow my bitch, give her back now, right now
I'ma need that, right now
Give her back now, right now
I'ma need that
Came up from the gravel to the motherfucking castle
Broke culture all we do is trappin'
At the table breaking bread with Italians
Got a whole bunch of bitches doing Valiums
Make a song everyday, got 1000
Got a whole bunch of trophies and medallions
Been the motherfucking man before the motherfucking money
Got another hundred grand, but who's counting?
When in, when in, when in Rome
I was 19 with the homies goin' 'round the globe
Got 75K, now they book me for a show
Muhfuckers can't see me when they standing on they toes
God damn, look up, god damn, look up
Yeah

[Hook]
When in, when in, Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome
When in, when in, Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome
When in, when in, Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome
When in, when in, Rome
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome

[Bridge]
I'm at the top of my game
(Goddamn) Don't mean to be rude
But me and you, we are not one and the same
(Goddamn) I'm eating your food
And fucking your bitch, 'cause you is a lame
(Goddamn) Pittsburgh
Where I lick, stir, little kid
God damn my life changed
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
See, I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)
I'm at the top of my game
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)

[Verse 3]
Yeah I made a couple million off rap like it's nothing
Keep the shit quiet, I don't stunt too much
She could fuck me, she don't give it up too much
Drink liquor like water, getting drunk too much, haan
I was off them drugs too much, in the crib fucking all these little sluts too much
How it is when you young, blowing up too much
Talking shit, but I know that you ain't up to much
Man I been working, said I'm the greatest
Now that I'm certain, Benzo the latest
Drunk and I'm swerving, I'm going ape shit on all of my verses
Fuck being famous, I'm here to fuck up your favorite
Lately I'm hearing too much of the same shit
Young and I'm faded, killing shit, bury it all under my basement

[Outro]
Shut your motherfucking mouth bitch
Fuck your motherfucking couch bitch
Yeah you talking, you ain't 'bout shit
Swear you a lame
I'ma keep killing shit, let them all hate
Bitches in love with my face, yeah I'm collecting
I need that money today
