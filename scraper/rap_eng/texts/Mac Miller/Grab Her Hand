[Intro]
Turn the beat up a lot
Like, a shit-ton
A little more

[Hook: Michael Christmas]
I told that nigga grab her hand, grab her hand
Then you gone have some fun and dance, fun and dance
And do some shit you never did before
And do some shit you never did before
I told that nigga grab her hand, grab her hand
Then you gone have some fun and dance, fun and dance
And do some shit you never did before
And do some shit you never did before

[Verse 1: Michael Christmas]
She get a whiff of some money
Mix it up with some liquor
She say I'm being a dick like my name was Richard
I can't be cold I'm no blizzard
Don't do dress codes, I'm that nigga
I wear a poncho, sombrero, La cucaracha came with us
Spend every fish and he fishin'
I drop his neck to these bitches
I see if she wanna dance, she sent my shot in the distance
But then She paused, stopped, "Are you Michael Christmas?"
I told her "yeah"
She said "My boyfriend is fan" and she dipped and

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Who the fuck's knockin' on my door?
Breakin' mirrors and I'm stompin' on the floor
Blowin' chronic, towel underneath the door
This life is nothin' like before
I must have did somethin' right
Bitch so bad I'm cumin' twice
Leavin' after, fuck your life
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sike!
I’ve been wrong way less than I’ve been right
I've been through a lot but I wanna keep it light right now
I probably could have stunted if I want to
Put a sub in the trunk if I want to
Bring a fire and make the bitch jump through
Ooh! Eat the booty like junk food

[Verse 3: Michael Christmas]
Now usually I'm nervous and this ain't no exception
I'm hidin' this erection, I'm searchin' for affection
I seen you pass the window lookin' back at your reflection
But if you see me lookin' I bet you would be offended
I'm just lookin', I ain't touchin'
Way too shook, I should say fuck it
Peel off skrrrrt in this bucket
What a Weird Day, go get this money
You can judge like your honor or you can get up and dance
Get off your phone and let an awkward nigga reach for your hand

I told that nigga grab her hand, grab her hand
Then you gone have some fun and dance, fun and dance
And do some shit you never did before
And do some shit you never did before
I told that nigga grab her hand, grab her hand
Then you gone have some fun and dance, fun and dance
And do some shit you never did before
And do some shit you never did before
