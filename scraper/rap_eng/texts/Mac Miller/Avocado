[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I said this visual symmetry
Riveting sentences in calligraphy,
Officially divinity
My conditions are critically important,
Horrorcore, assortment of orphans
Fuck a bitch, contortion
I'm a beast animorphing style
Act humble I stumbled upon a fortune teller
Got cashed up and blew this shit out of proportion fella,
Brass knuckles in rumbling jungles,
Gods that pray,
Smart fathers throwing Hail Marys then I'm on my way,
Fuck Twitter there's none iller this butt's Fisker,
Put my ho up in it, then I bust in her
Puff Swishers till' my lungs blister
Spittin' tongue twisters
My work ethic incredible, yeah I'm from Pittsburgh
Got an intern go'on grab me the Swishers
Read the book The Giver, analyse, Trent Dilfer,
Wes Craven with less Satan all hail Larry,
The mass making of homosapien male fairys
I need more money, a little less dairy
Keep my bitches in the sanctuary paying fairly
Jim Carrey, you be more like Drew
I'm eating and he look a little more like food
You see Satan was an angel before horns had grew
On my way I buy lebre' I get a norm tattoo
Beep that horn at you, bitch move
You look so confused
Spent, 10 million to ensure- to ensure my motherfucking vocal cords
I said I spent, 10 million, to ensure my motherfucking vocal cords..

[Outro:]
Beat making, weed breaking, down
Clean faded, cremated now..
(Clean up on Aisle 7)
And when your dreams make a, creation, wow
Clean wasted, these sacred, vows
Beat making, we breaking, down
Clean faded, cremated, now..
(Clean up on Aisle 7)
And when your dreams make a, creation, wow
Clean wasted, these sacred, vows
Spend a little time with a run-on sentence..
