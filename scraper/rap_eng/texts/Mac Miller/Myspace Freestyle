Pathological Liar
Went to my girlfriends house and set her dog on fire
Blamed it on her little brother, got him sent to juvi
Fucked her in the bathroom while her dad was watching movies
Reach in to my backpack for a fully loaded UZI
Started shooting up the room he was in
That Chapelle show episode, you know, Paule Mooney was in
Told her everything would be alright
Just don't scream as I dismount
Left the crib
Started searching for a discount
Exorcist I need to get some help with this
Once as sweet as [?] is, think he went insane tho
Must have been the drugs in him, he love to sniff the yayo
Insane could accompany a angel
But maybe one day I can be somebodys angel
Catalog with greatest hits
Sacred does what sacred is
And people raise their brows
When you wierd as Al yankovich
I just wanna make out with groupies and play with tits
Snort H and shit, just forget what day it is
I'm eating Seder with Clinton and Ralf Nader
Trading Acres and betting millions against the Lakers
Spitting out what used to be a children's favourite flavour
Sentenced to hell but I'm out on good behaviour
Oh shit, got a new neighbour

Pause - Humming "The Star-Spangled Banner"

Still alive in a room full of melted candles
Lost my job, now I'm in New York selling sandals
Saw Christopher Stokes and SW Randall
Introduced my youngest cousin to him, told him he was DTF
They probably had some freaky sex, really I'm not worried
Already plan to kill myself when the clock hits 7:30
Reading Hamlet out loud in a room by myself
Giving different characters different voices
I think it helps
Storyline flow of the plot
Got a gun in my dresser
It's holding a shot
