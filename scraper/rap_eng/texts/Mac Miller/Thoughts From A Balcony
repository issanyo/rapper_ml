[Verse 1: Ali Tomineek]
I got a lot of dreams that I want to turn into reality
But most of these people are doubting me
Like, “This child should be in preschool”, not giving his thoughts from a balcony
And this just scary like I’m insidious so I’m Palpatine
Spitting it different than Malcolm he’s
Trying to keep it fresh so somebody pass me the talcum please
I just wanted these people to be crowding around me
Rowdily shouting screaming I’m flyer than a falcon wing
But it’s just so different
My dad always telling me I don’t listen
And since then? I guess I’m acting the same
Thinking that my rapping is lame and there ain’t really cash in this game
But I ain’t gonna be passing the fame…
So you can sack me or try to while I run it in for a touchdown on this Sap beat
I’m just trying to make people happy

[Hook: Mac Miller]
They just dreams, turn ’em to reality
Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the sky thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories so what the fuck is time
They just dreams, turn ’em to reality
Double cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the street thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories so what the fuck is time
What the, what the fuck is time
Ask ‘em what the fuck is time
I don’t know
What the fuck is time
I ask ‘em what the fuck is time

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
What do you do when you think you can be an icon?
‘Cause all these people get to screaming when the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes zebra coat
Racing to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers taking shots without a Nikon
But I don’t fight though, figure it’s a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright now
Potion in my sprite then my night slows, down down
See that’s exactly what I need
My khakis filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it Donald trump a fucking hit but I just call it love
They throw it on when I’m walking in the club
Hey this is Burgh shit I don’t deserve this
Well, I don’t think you are looking for me on the surface
Learn quick now I’m big time
Fill your cup up, and I'mma sip mine
