[Verse 1]
Recently it seem like everywhere we go
The drinks stay cold when we cooling, cooling
And being broke starts to get a little old
My money had to get some fine tuning
Tonight might be the night I make it
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all
All these faces, different places
People hit me up but I'm forgetting to call
Get away to California where the weather getting colder
My honey's by the pool with umbrellas and mimosas
Chilling at the beach house, lounging on the sofa
Riding with a chauffeur, on my way to blow up
Stoner, roll up, fishing, champagne sipping
5-star chef stay cooking in the kitchen
But making only the good shit
See the way I'm living they like "Oh my goodness"

[Chorus]
I tell 'em I'm fine
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
And baby all we got is time
Let's just watch the clouds go by
Ah ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
And there ain't no need to panic
Girl, we can lay up on this hammock
No need to pose here, everything candid
Living in the moment, feeling so splendid
Bottles on me, you can put it on the debit
I'm just trying to have fun tonight
So everybody wang chung tonight
Girl, you can fall in love tonight
Cause trust me, I'mma fuck you right
Got my Louis shades on, ain't no damn thing wrong
Fill enough cups 'til the bottle all gone
We just cooling, cooling, feel the breeze
It's time to get you something you can sing off key
Like "La la la la la la la"
I'll be puffing that la la la la la la la

[Chorus]
I tell 'em I'm fine
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
And baby all we got is time
Let's just watch the clouds go by
Ah ah ah ah

[Outro]
Yeah
Haha, that's that smooth shit Jerm!
That pimp shit dude!
Oh yeah!
Thumbs up
Haha
