[Intro]
Yeah, all these haters an shit
They're just forced to hate no reason (fuck y'all)
Don't really know who I am at all (fuck y'all mutherfuckers)
So I guess I kinda gotta introduce myself again
To these mutherfuckers
So I'm just like, yeah

[Verse 1]
Pleased to meet you, find me with a heap of reefer
Speakin' ether, I'll whoop your ass and crease your sneakers
Haters keep the hatin' little faggots figure skatin'
While we figure eightin', seekin' your replacement
And I ain't gonna, touch the hate like some bacteria
Some nasty ass food from the cafeteria
You'll have and hear me bruh, if you pass me up at lunch
I'mma beat yo ass tearin' you in half and eat you up
Like any given friday I roll up to your drive way
Rock you in the face, have you lookin' up and sideways
So step back cause you ain't want it with Mac
The young cat with the rap to leave you flat on your back
And as a matter of fact, I'm like crack on the track
With my cap to the back, I'm the cat in the hat
Yeah we rhymin' like Dr. Seuss
So be careful before you end up on the news
Every time that we

[Hook]
Cruise like we got nothing to loose
Hear the speech through the speakers
Hope it's coming in smooth
When we cruise, see I ain't got nothing to do
So I'mma roll around the city smoking blunts with my crew
When we cruise
Cruise like we got nothing to loose
Hear the speech through the speakers
Hope it's coming in smooth
When we cruise, see I ain't got nothing to do
So I'mma roll around the city smoking blunts with my crew
When we cruise

[Verse 2]
And there ain't nobody that do it like Pittsburgh (NOPE)
Said there ain't nobody do it like Pittsburg (NOT AH)
I said it twice just in case that you misheard
Cause this verse is like (sippin' an ounce of sizzurp)
So quit your back talk, I ain't havin' it boy
I'm lookin' fresh right now, straight dazzlin' boy
Light a swisher now I'm gone
When my minds on, 5's on, laced up, headed out the time bomb
Get your life right, size truck with a white light
Triple X tee and a fresh pair of white Nikes
I write like nobody you've seen
Cause my weed is purple and my money is green
See I'm hungry for cream with my fitted on lean
If you wanna talk shit, I'mma shit on yall's team
I rock my fitted to the side
Roll around the city blowin' piff up in the sky
When we

[Hook]
Cruise, like we got nothin' to loose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we Cruise see I ain't got nothin' to do
So I'mma roll around the city smokin' blunts with my crew
When we cruise
Cruise, like we got nothin' to loose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we Cruise see I ain't got nothin' to do

[Verse 3]
The kid raps like lasers, sharp like razors
Rollin' up my weed in some Garcia Vegas
Fuck a cop tryna chase me with tasers
I'm runnin' out my crib, then I'm dippin' through the neighbor's
Garden, High homie, Marvin the Martian
I wipe my ass with you soft rappers like Charmin
Y'all hungry, I'm starvin', you talkin shit, oh I beg your pardon
Specifics is never gimmicks, I rip it just how I live it
You wanna it, I'll go and get it, I'm kickin' it so exquisite
The wickedest motherfucker on the block I live at
Shit talk on Hip-Hop, I'm pealin' your wig back
Yup, so where the crib at? Where the party at?
Where them butt naked hoes and the Bacardi at?
Cause when I start to rap, it's game over
And I ain't spend a single day sober
When we

[Hook]
Cruise, like we got nothin' to loose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we Cruise, see I ain't got nothin' to do
So I'mma roll around the city smokin' blunts with my crew
When we cruise
Cruise, like we got nothin' to loose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we Cruise, see I ain't got nothin' to do
