[Intro]
Yeah
Hahaha
Hey

[Verse]
Louis frames hide my bloodshot eyes
My disguise, from this world outside
Vivid description paints a picture for the blind
Got me on my syrup sippin' shit, slowin' down time
Uhh, Hidden from the shine
Trippy shit, she listen and she rewind
Put the black light on, close the blinds
Walkin' on the clouds, turnin' water into wine
As I travel through ya mind
I be swimmin' through ya thoughts
Creep outside the lines
Those who live within the box
Gone...
Seein' spots like chicken pox
So gone, Michael Jordan start missin' shots
Acid, tablets, down the hole with Alice
Smilin' like the cat is
Water from a cactus
Snap back, fallin' off my head, mad hat shit
Got the Earth spinnin' off it's axis
Feelin' like the shit, no diaper
Sippin' apple cider
Goin' back and forth like a windshield wiper
This gon' be another all nighter
Cuz I'm trippin' out
Yeah, I'm trippin' out

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Got a bottle of water, couple tablets, and a half a zip
Pack your bags, we goin' on a acid trip
Don't mean to scare you
Just get inside the car
The driver sayin' where to?
To the top, please
Hidden from the news and paparazzi
It wake you up like coffee, yeah
Now, I'm layin in my strawberry fields
Appeal to my senses
And it seem so real
A figment of imagination, uh
And I've heard your prior allegations
And it's true
Bitch, I'm higher than you
Maybe goin' skitso
Open up the window
Trippy like the music on Nintendo
It's all good, bro
Roll some endo
Lost you at the twenty
But I'll see you in the end-zone

[Outro]
I'm trippin' out...
(I'm trippin' out)
