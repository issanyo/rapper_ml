Ya um ya ya ya
Ok alright ok alright
Yeah okay

Ive spent nights workin
And im quite certain
If the right person come across me then I might hurt em
It’s the, the white sermon
And I ain't talkin air
Rappers is my sons im the shittiest of parents

Its just another suicide lullaby
You don’t get the truth here
We only summarize
Facts ain't nothing we should publicize
Throw the lightning bolts my bitch got the thunder thighs
It Young zeus with it
Throw the blunt in the circle playing duck duck goose with it
Too prolific
Lotta people after the bread
Me, im gonna rap when im dead
Tell em shoot me in the back of the head

Man with no face 3X
Yeah yeah yeah
Unstable head fillin up with raps
Whiskey in my flesh, shit you didn’t have to ask
Making juggles but they didn’t know the half
I ain't schoolboy q bitch I didn’t go to class
Your bitches pussy lips is on my stache
I see these new rappers and all I do is laugh
Raps sabotage, young macintosh
Funny money like it was buddies with Judd Apatow
Yeah the raps is hard but the pack is raw
Old jewish homie chillen playin racquetball
And its all good after all 2X
Yeah, Man with no face 2X
