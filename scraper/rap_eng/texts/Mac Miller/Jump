Yeah, who-ho
Yeah, who-ho
Hey now
Hey now
Who-ho

[Verse 1]
Yeah, who's that on the other end of the phone?
Didn't hear nothing when I said my hello
Oh well, to Hell then we go
So high looking at Heaven below
You know me though from coast to coast for smoking dope
Overdose with the holy ghost, but hold the phones
I hold my own, was local grown
Been killing that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drank, I'mma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air that thing so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama you ain't need no drama
You ain't gotta cry no more now

[Bridge 1]
It'll be alright
My mind on the run I won't sleep tonight, it's like
When it all goes up in flames who gon' hold me down
(Down)
And I'm the chosen one
Looking all around what has the world become
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground
I've been getting paid
About four, five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'mma drown
Drown
Drown
Drown

[Hook]
You've never been better than me
From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump
To see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly

[Verse 2]
It's the life of an entertainer
I need that check, go on get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode
And these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in an elevator, he was headed to the top floor
We're quite similar
We just did our work and we were in it for a lot more
We were trying to change the world, but we got bored
When I rip this show, got an encore
Back when we were still in school we didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies the top so lonely
But we ainâ€™t  gonna die not now

[Bridge 2]
You gon' make it here, live free tonight till the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile
How do we get rich, if she acting crazy I don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now
Go on and on, know I had this shit all along
Take a breath, feel this moment hold it just so you can
Look where we at, look where we came from
When will we wake up, lost in translation

[Hook]
You've never been better than me
From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly
