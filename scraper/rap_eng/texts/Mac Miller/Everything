[Intro: Boaz]
Uh, whattup ?
I'm sitting here in the studio, man
Thinkin' 'bout all the hours we put up in this motherfucker
All the sweat I got in this mic, you heard?
Motherfuckers' phones ringin' and shit
Keep fuckin' up the set
It was all worth it though

[Verse 1: Boaz]
Yeah, okay, ordinary rapper, ended up a superstar
Sittin' in the ghetto, wishin' on that shootin' star
Order bottle service, we ain't gotta do the bar
Let's go hard tonight, the same shit we gon' do tomorrow
Different city, different state, bang out with real niggas
Every sponsor big estate, you gotta feel nigga
Smashin' out in the Astin, gettin' head and not crashin'
Got the brown bag from '09, not spendin' bread, just stashin'
Still gettin' that cash nigga, rap money more fast nigga
Rollin' up that grass, I still smoke a joint 'til the ash with ya
But time's changed and people too, I feel the same, how it seem to you?
I'm where the weather's nice and the trees is blue
Welcome to the life, this a dream come true
Got the city goin' hard cause we all bubblin'
Got the fans talkin' 'bout me way out in Dublin
Who you shinin' with? When the album comin'?
It's all a grind cousin, I knew my time was comin'
Poetical justice in unusual fashion
Let's get this established, this music my passion

[Hook]
It wasn't for the money or the fame
But for the love of the game, they expect you to change
But when you grindin' shinin' ain't a thing
But when you grindin' shinin' ain't a thing
Now I'm sittin' at the party with pretty hoes
Fresh from my head to my toes, sippin' bottles of Roz
Don't want for nothin', I got everything
Don't want for nothin', I got everything

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Humble beginnings I was dreamin' 'bout the superstardom
Money and women, give a fuck about women
My problems always in my own head, started out with no bread
Kept my head up, got my bread up, now I'm chillin'
Still I hit the gas station, passin' Jacksons to fiends
Go and buy me a blunt that I packed with some weed
I remember all them days they would laugh at my dreams
Now when they look at what I'm doin', they just have to believe
Rappin' with my cast on, broke my hand and hashed
Til I rapped like it's my last song
Passin' chip to hash when they ask about the Burg I tell 'em listen to Bo
Because them stories go way deeper than these bitches and hoes
Stickin' to the program, always on my own two
I always build my own, man, there's nothing that I won't do
To get this money, tempted by materials
I always dreamt I'd have that B emblem on my steering wheel
These rap motherfuckers funny though
Young and with success tend to move 'em out they comfort zone
But fuck these hoes, I'm thinkin' 'bout some better things
Forget about that bullshit, the music becomes everything

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, now they see me all bossed up, bad hoes gettin' tossed up
Chauffeurs pullin' cars up, push a button it starts up
I feel like I just landed on a whole 'nother planet
This money changes everything, these niggas don't understand it
Got paintings on the wall now, my countertops is granite
I take it as a blessing, no never took it for granted
This just how God planned it, these haters can't stand it
Can't stop that if I wanted to, we ball out automatic
Everything's top of the line, shoppin' in ?
Ice on both of my arms, frames Versace design
But those are just material things
Can we rise beyond that to a spiritual plane?
Can I make million dollars without dealing cocaine?
Wanna die a happy death without feelin' no pain
We hit the game like an asteroid, name in the tabloids
Now go and get your money on little duffle-bag boy
As I roll up the stank and pour me a drank
I'm laughin' at niggas all the way to the bank
As I roll up the stank and pour me a drank
I'm just laughin' at bitches all the way to the bank
