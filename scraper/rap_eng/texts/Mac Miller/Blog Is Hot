[Verse 1]
Everybody love it cause we do it with ease
Hop up online get your music for free
The blog is hot it's no longer on the down low
A song side if it get a lot of downloads
Everybody love it cause right before a hit drop
Already grabbed it off hot new hip hop
Blog is like the shit talk coming at your neck
Cause fake shit coming well it doesn't get respect
Blog's hit the net like a mufucking typhoon
Nobody dropping dollars on iTunes
Websites good to look at like a hot mom
Rap mullet allhiphop.com
A lot of hate on hip hop game
Dudes like damn white boy is lame
But it's great cause i love hate
So listen fuck face
I'm giving news, hip-hop updates
You want music? And all that fly?
You better do it like motor and blog or die
If you searching you'll come across sermon
Cuttin' up more than your everyday person
And some blogs makin' no noise
