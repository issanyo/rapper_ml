[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Said this a muthafuckin' real thing, no warning shot
I didn't come up to your door to knock
C4 in a foreign car, either with me or you not
I'm Pittsburgh born and bred, Portishead Glory Box
Bitches let me get inside the glory box
Tell her get down on her knees, kneel before her God
Yeah muhfuckas better come with it
I'ma fuck it up before I get done with it
Get money fuck bitches, I'm the muthafucka one
No chill I'm still having fun wit it
