[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
The pill that will cure me is hard to swallow
I met her at a car show, somewhere in Colorado
With an act that's hard to follow, she an astronaut
The band had practice at my house, I had a large garage
She take the trolley to the coffee shop, around the corner, behind the clinic
Had an espresso shot and one Virginia Slim
All she could think about was him, how he's been and if he's seeing someone
Haven't heard much from him since he joined the marching band
Selling her mom's Percocets, and popping uppers
Her heart would stutter, thoughts were often cluttered, raindrops on the gutter drumming
Her ugly rubber duckling sinking while the bath drain
Tell her doctor she need Vicodin, it's for her back pain
Took a nap on the last train, her mind's in the ashtray
She can't unlock her conscience, left her keys with the valet
Bad day marathon, can't change the channel
Hard to arrange what's scrambled

[Hook: Mac Miller (Delusional Thomas)]
Can you sing me a troubled man's lullaby
Save the fairy tale endings for another time
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
Can you sing me a troubled man's lullaby
Save the fairy tale endings and romance for another time
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep

[Verse 2: Retch]
It was niggas everywhere, it was looking like a plan
Take the fix, started bucking, they was booking by the van
Little kids started crying, I seen a nigga trip and fell
It was me and bro, just dumping, nigga all you seen was shells
When he tried to hop the fence, he was running towards the V
Bullets whizzing past his dome, he was ducking by the tree
Another nigga he was fly, had the Jordans that was black
But them niggas they was food, so he got wet up in his back
Other nigga got away, but it was quiet for his mans
I seen bro lick a shot, it hit his head and then it jammed
He pulled the 40 out his back, cocked the shit and kept blamming
Had the smile on his face, caught excitement from the panic
Could of swore it was a game, he was shooting like it's Xbox
Darkskin, skinny ass nigga with the dreadlocks
Now I'm all out of dog food, bodies lying twitching
Hit the trunk and got low, heard them sirens in the distance
Turn and go
