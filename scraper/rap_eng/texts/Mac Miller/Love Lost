[Intro]
Fuck you!
Hey, hey, where'd ya go?
Oh yeah
Where'd ya go?
Doin' the happy dance
Doin' the happy dance
Doin' the happy dance

[Hook]
(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we found it)
You lay with me, now you're gone and
All I've got is this damn song
(And if you cross your heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart, can't find no crush
So why don't you come on back home?

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, I'm a fuckin workaholic with a passion in my heart
Treatin' rappin' as a art, which you have to be apart of
I just copped a new car to hear it's all up
Try to do the right thing and please karma
All I want to know is where the fuck did you have to go?
I've been waiting on you baby
Why don't you leave and come on home?
I can't be mad, I'm living my dream
Going all around the globe
Though you said you think you love me
You need to let me know
So I've been fucking all these hoes
And I've been blowing all this cash
Cause baby this just the beginning
And I'mma make all of it back

[Hook]
(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we found it)
You lay with me, now you're gone and
All I've got is this damn song
(And if you cross your heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart, can't find no crush
So why don't you come on back home?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
It's all good, everybody trying to eat tonight
Trying to go to sleep having good dreams tonight
Go home, might get better
All I know: It don't last forever
So take it while you got it, try to get a little more
They say I'm getting better than I've ever been before
And that's for sure, tell 'em what I do
Rap keep me filled like a spoon getting soup
I've been out here on the road
And now they missing me at home
All these ex-girls that I used to know are hitting up my phone
But I ain't here
I guess you can't call back
Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll, I think I'll take all that

[Hook]
(Our love was lost)
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
(But now we found it)
You lay with me, now you're gone and
All I've got is this damn song
(And if you cross your heart)
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart, can't find no crush
So why don't you come on back home?

[Outro]
Yeah
Huh Huh, But it gets no better than this
Huh, Yeah it gets no better than this
Yeah
Yeah, It get no better
Yeah, It get no better
Yeah, It get no better
This shit forever
Get no better
Get no better
Yeah, it get no better
Yeah, this shit forever
Bum, didi bum bum bum bum bum
Bum you can cut it here!... and then were done
