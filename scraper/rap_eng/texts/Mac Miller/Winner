And when its night time with the shine of the city lights
Same day different mic what you living like
Travel around the country always at the airport different flights
Its anything but the simple life
I break em off fuck a magistrate
And I laugh at hate
Revenge a dish served cold y’all can grab a plate
Grab a tape toward the money and the fame
But it ain't all what it seem boy just another game
No wii, xbox, or ps3 just good weed and some henny you can leave me be
Maybe find me in the west coast like ez e
They in a coma been asleep for weeks
But now they waking up
They notice that the youngin got skill
Ya im white but you can't put a color on ill
I got my own thing going for me
Sip lean so they move in slow motion for me
Just a juvenile but these vets moving over for me
Cold glass of henny so they go and grab a coaster for me
Life a fuckin roller coaster homie
Whats my name? bitch you were supposed to know me

Just forget all that bullshit mane
Leave it to the lames
Im just trying to make it in the game
I can do it all
Still gonna end up winning
That’s just what I saw
Right from the beginning
They gone change
I was built to be a winner
I was built to be a winner

[Mac miller]
Its just me and my team that’s all that matters yeah
Live my life right and just be happy here
Ain't no white light, bitch I got my whole life ahead of me
Architecture my life but you can't design my destiny
All the family that I lost, rest in peace
Wish you was here to see me catch my dream
Iv chased my shadow now im on another level
At the playground playing freeze tag with the devil
I ain't gonna sell my soul tho
This music worth more then hoes, boats, and polo
No college but bet I win the rose bowl
The way I smoke got my moms going loco
Live on my own now paying rent and shit
When life stress gets thick you need some sedatives
A little weed and a little bit of liquor
Make me forget about this bullshit im into
