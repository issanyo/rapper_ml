[Bridge]
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat
But now she think she got it like that
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat
Mmm I think she think she got it like that

[Refrain]
Baby you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat
If you got something to match

[Verse 1]
Baby you could wear my hat
Just twist it to the back
We drinking out the bottle while you sitting on my lap
Then we could go outside, let me take you on a ride
With the top down show you off to people you my prize
Nothing like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes
Shining like my high beams cooler than some iced tea
Yeah I got a female, who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shopping and you would think she worked at retail
Snapbacks make em look so cute and that girl know how to blow
Something like she played the flute
That long hair and it’s falling down her back
I put on my hat and she reach and try to snatch it
Baby you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch
Make a snapback look fantastic but sorry you can’t have this
She smiled big, kissing on my cheek
Baby you could wear my hat make sure you give it back to me

[Refrain]
Baby you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat
If you got something to match

[Verse 2]
She like to play her stupid games with me
She never seem to have enough
She brought some friends for whoever came with me
So, my homies sayin’ that’s what’s up
And I hear her name’s pretty from different continent
Telling me she’s single but to tell the truth I’m not convinced
It’s all good I’m used to boyfriends always talking shit
Thinking that they players but I’m coach call me Popovich
Baby I ain’t doctor rich, but I’ll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight
And we ain’t seen her since so tell me what does that look like
I’m the type to bring you right back down to earth
And for what it’s worth I’ll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I’m guessing she a keeper
I think she stole it though I keep trying to reach her

[Refrain]
Baby you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat
If you got something to match

[Bridge]
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat
But now she think she got it like that
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat
Mmm I think she think she got it like that
