[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Soul!
Ever since a nigga had recess
Mothafucka felt like a grownup (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing 'round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno, damn, that fucked me up
At 10 I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid
I'm living too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm riding high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm 25, no lie

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes
Tell 'em all what they missing, while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodging my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best
Watching my step, never no college plan
Found myself nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from "The Bachelor"
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama
Only 18 but I had my own business
Then I got fame like "what the fuck is this?"
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool, cause I got money
Back in high school none of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

[Hook: Mac Miller]
They, they, they been looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed
If you're 18 years and older, 18 years and older
If you're 18 years and older, 18 years and older

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds
Blaze a gang of trees
Went to see a rated R movie about me
They said you must be
18 years and older, 18 years and older
18 years and older, 18 years and older
18 years and older
