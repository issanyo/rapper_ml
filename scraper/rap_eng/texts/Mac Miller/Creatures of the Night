[Verse 1: Njomza]
She rocks the streets so mean, with high heels on
It's a quarter past 3 A.M., she'll be out 'til dawn
Give her what she wants, she'll do anything you need
She wants to feel love like in the movie screen
He said, "I got something that'll make you feel good"
As long as you remain calm, I can take you away

[Chorus: Njomza]
Will you come and join us?
Creatures of the night
Will you come and join us?
Creatures of the night

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Mascara fallin' from her face
Don't believe their lies, my eyes
Feel so safe inside the chaos
It's easy to hide

[Bridge: Njomza]
So cold, young girl, she hates to be alone
So cold, young girl, she'll be gone in the morning

[Verse 3: Delusional Thomas]
One, two, three, shh
If you're quiet you can hear 'em comin'
He just appeared from nothin'
Gettin' weirder and weirder
'Til I'm severely fucked up
Drugs got me clearly buggin'
But if I take another dose I might eat a human
Chugs a pint of diesel fluid
Lurkin' in the shadows with a makeshift weapon on
Tucked behind the Polo, my Ralph ain't got a logo
We the monsters, we're the gremlins, we seek to cause terror
It's America, call the pallbearers up
Creatures of the nightfall, bleeding on your white wall
Shittin' on you demons, see my shadow when the light's off
And everybody hates a cokehead
While cleaning up my own mess I noticed I wasn't grown yet
I'm probably a little wiser, my mind is a synthesizer
I'm next level, you the left pedal
Yeah we the dirty, we the garbage that you threw out
Here to blow the fuse out, evict the white house, tell 'em move out

[Chorus: Njomza]
Will you come and join us?
Creatures of the night
Will you come and join us?
Creatures of the night
