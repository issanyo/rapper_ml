[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, and it go like
We just can't help but make chill shit man
But it's some great chill shit
ID Labs, what's good

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey
I got champagne dreams, Louis Vuitton hopes
Rolls-Royce fantasies staying in condos
For now living lavishes on hold
If you wanna play the game then go pick up a console
It's not slow cheddar, it's nachos
I know my path while you turning in wrong rows
Hype like pom-poms, tied into some Long Johns
Finally some brand new gear that I got on
New shoes and some twenty dollar socks on
Me and my people stay connected like a dot com
They say I blow a contact I'm a car bomb
I'm just finding me a target I can lock on
Nobody can do it exactly like I do
Cause nobody I know got my life or got my crew
They try to, telling me I'm you
Probably don't understand but you will when it's time to

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Everybody mention me letting me get away
From the people always telling me nothing is left to say
But, they can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
Everybody mention me letting me get away
From the people always telling me nothing is left to say
But, they can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Caviar appetizers first class flight
Making money kinda easy when you learn to do it right
Melody through this mic, they telling me what they like
But never get to the brights forgetting to live their life
I'm, one of a kind see me breaking it down
I heard the spotlight was yours but I'm taking it now
You looking good there lady come and stay for a while
I love to hear my parents say I'm making 'em proud
I got a gift to show the world I'm a take it around
Guarantee you every single hater hate when I smile
Once upon a time there were people that didn't know
I had talent, I was cool but it seems that it'd never show
I'm finna blow, travel across the globe
And if they didn't before, now they know
Look at me now, I'm getting to Europe
And at first they was telling me no

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Everybody mention me letting me get away
From the people always telling me nothing is left to say
But, they can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
Everybody mention me letting me get away
From the people always telling me nothing is left to say
But, they can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
They can't tell me shit
