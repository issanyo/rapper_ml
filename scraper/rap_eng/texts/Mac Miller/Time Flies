[Intro: Lil B]
Time flies, time flies
As we keep living and as we keep being positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories
Mac Miller, I love you

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
All of my homies used to get on my case like "When you 'bout to kill 'em?"
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprouts some children
But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man
My mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn

[Hook: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies
Time flies, try to catch it

[Interlude: Lil B]
Watch as time go
Time moves, time flows
How do we handle these things?
I am time, we are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams are manifested
From my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive
But I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with an ego big as Texas
Thinkin' "I'm the man", I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone

[Hook: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies
Time flies, try to catch it

[Outro: Lil B]
One day we will, we will find
We will conquer, conquer with love
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on
Lil B
