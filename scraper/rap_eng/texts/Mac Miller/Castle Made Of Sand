[Intro]

Yeah
Let me crack open my high life real quick (Big Jerm)
Product placement

[Hook]
Lets take it to the top now
To the top now baby
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow
I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky
And if you sittin' down, please stand
Cuz I'm on the rise and I reside
In this castle made of sand

[Verse 1]
Let me get a hand clap
I'ma make an entrance
Givin' y'all the lecture
Then I'm taking questions
My soul a sword, write a sentence, make a weapon
Swimmin' in the deep end
You bitches takin' lessons
Then I hear u hatin' on the boy
Well I ain't offended
Cuz I'm the captain of the team and y'all play the benches
Still breaking it down, to rollin' it up
Put an eighthy in the blunt
And I'm smokin' a dutch
But talk hoes, know I stay with a few
But they replace like the lace in my shoe
So tell me what a player to do
When being real don't appeal to the player in you
I've seen some whack cats fast track to the fame
To me it sounds like some clowns rappin' the same
And we, we all living for the same thing
Just to make it to the top
And remain king

[Hook]
Lets take it to the top now
To the top now baby
I'ma take my time
Through rain. sleet. snow
I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky
And if you sittin' down, please stand
Cuz I'm on the rise and I reside
In this castle made of sand

[Verse 2]
You can't name a single youngin'
With a flow like mine
Got bars like soap
And I glow like shine
If you think I'm whack, you might change your mind
Cuz I got them punchlines that stain like whine
Let me take my time
Collect my thoughts
Keep it fresh like shoes when they kept in the box
Connect all the dots
I'm fresh, so clean
Stay pinchin' my self
Cuz I'm living in a dream
Believe, I ain't ever gonna stop
Find a new spot then I set up my shop
When I drop, your wifey gonna cop dat
Haters gettin' shaken out they jockstraps
Some say I'm bringin hip-hop back
While others say that I'm all up on that pop-rap
Team captain control the game
Goin' hard till every single person knows my name

[Hook]
Lets take it to the top now
To the top now, baby
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow
I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky
And if you sittin' down, please stand
Cuz I'm on the rise and I reside
In this castle made of sand

[Outro]
To the top now, to the top now babby
Yeah
