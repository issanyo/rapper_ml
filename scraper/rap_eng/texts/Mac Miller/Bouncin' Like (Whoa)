I was riding something playing with the top down
And I’m used to play it loud
I told my girl to pull her top down
Like she was standing in the crowd
Baby I got all this money, and everything you need
If you could please just take your clothes off

That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Wrist on free oh, when I’m in Orlando
You can catch me up in Prios
Shawty is an animal, a lion like Leo
And I’m in this bitch, smoking weed nigga
Please don’t tell my PO
Shawty all about her money
I love it when she take it down
Like it when she bend it over
Move that ass around, go, go, go, go
Girl I wanna see you do something you never done
Share the party just begun we the hella ones
And fucking right that we gon’ have some fun
And don’t be worried bout that money, you gon’ make a ton

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

I got that top push back, it was kinda hot
Got on my Gucci glasses, looking fantastic
Wonder how quick I can get her bra un …
Got good taste of fashion, and she kinda classy
Why don’t you drop it low for me girl when I ask it
Yeah, I got a pocket full of hunned dollar bills
If you want it, baby tell me how it feels
Fuck it woman, girl you got to keep it reals
And the last time I saw her

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bounce that ass for the kid while we cruising
Put a Marley on her tongue, watch her loose it
We’re in the 442 white and blue, with the leather sits
Louie sneaks, lil freak, right next to me
I got all these money, president rolls
Shawty thick, doing crazy tricks on the pole

Bad bitches outside, who I bought them for
All I know to ride tall, wake up by the mall
Blue…for my broad, yo we buy it all
Blue shades, they cost a …
My bitch pussy … like lasagna

[Hook: Mac Miller]
I was riding something playing with the top down
And the music playing loud
I told my girl to pull her top down
Like she was standing in the crowd
Baby I got all this money, and everything you need
If you could please just take your clothes off

That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, oh, oh
