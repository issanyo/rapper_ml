[Hook] (2x)
I got you right where I want you
Now you can't get away
You try to find, a way I wanna break out

[Verse 1]
You can't get away but trapped in this so
Grab your seat belt, fasten it
Girls keep me on them Facebook status
Repping for me like a activist
Now I don't have to spit, I just choose to
With some words that will move you concept confuse you lose you
Intelligent with etiquette never let it get better than mess around with a medicine
Sentences with a predicates
I take action no use relaxing
Curses that I'm casting got them all wrapped in my spell
They say he rapping so well
Light a square up right after the L
I'm smoking come roll with me
It's potent got a whole O to chief
Teacher's like Mac can you focus please
But y'all ain't control of me

[Hook] (2x)
I got you right where I want you
Now you can't get away
You try to find, a way I wanna break out

[Verse 2]
Look, young Socrates, thinkin' so prolific
Critics give a fuck about my business
No gimmicks, I talk it how I live it
Told God that this gift is a privilege
So thank you for blessing me with talent
My neighbors and my fans think I'm chemically imbalanced
Move on with new songs, beasts getting chewed on
Wake up bake up put my shoes on
Money got you shady if it's too long
Act crazy the he going to do wrong
Right where I want you, in your brain ima haunt you I got you

[Hook] (2x)
I got you right where I want you
Now you can't get away
You try to find, a way I wanna break out

[Verse 3]
The most Dopest overly devoted
Young mechanic making everything that's broke fixed
This a simple routine so focus
I'm just watering the flowers no lotus
It's magic when I spit, go hookas pookas
The game is full of clay ima mold it
People that I roll always ready to protect me
A lot of hate coming towards an MC
Ain't nobody friendly out for them own chips
I'm so sick epidemic like a cold hit
My team running it now, Most Dope clique
A lot of rappers in the game but they don't fit
A long journey to the top but I won't quit
Got delta in his hand, don't fold it
Keep it pushing don't let yourself get stuck
I know your momma never told you to give up

[Hook] (2x)
I got you right where I want you
Now you can't get away
You try to find, a way I wanna break out
