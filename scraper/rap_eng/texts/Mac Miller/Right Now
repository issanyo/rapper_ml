(Verse 1)
I only got a couple bucks in my pocket, fuck
Spitting out these bars like it tastes bad, yuck
I'm way too much, just shrug like shucks
Every time a hater diss a homie I dont give a fuck
Hell yeah, its Most Dope bitch, just got it tatted on me
The only motherfuckers coming to the after party
No time to bullshit, no bad advice
Been getting buzzed, spitting crack tryina bag of tight
Cause, I'm trying to stay kinda low key
And all the OG's get the whole glory
Always pay hommage to the dudes who came before me
Harder from the top, cause I thought it was lonely
Never going back to the old me, so here's the new me
A lot of motherfuckers starring in this movie
Heard it's impossible to do me
Thumbs up bitch, everything groovy

(Hook)
Do you remember, when you was different from the man you are right now
Getting high in the car right now
I'm just trying to have a ball right now
Swear I want it all right now [x2]
(Verse 2)
If it ain't stuck in your head I'll get the nail gun
Delivery like the dude you get your mail from
Happy shit how these bitches wave their tails
You can bet you haven't lived if you never even failed once
Taking over shit, call me pilgrim
And now we got fans who wanna film him
To be honest, it's a little too much to comprehend
Cause everywhere I go, they know they gotta let me in
Stay humble though, mama raised a gentleman
Told me be polite when you introduced to Benjamin
But now I'm spending them, acting like the president
Tryina shake the world, like I'm jumping round some gelatin
And they think they tempurpedic
I'm a get it though, best believe it
This is shit they sure to kept it secret
But fuck it, I'm a let you see it

(Hook)
Do you remember, when you was different from the man you are right now
Getting high in the car right now
I'm just trying to have a ball right now
Swear I want it all right now [x2]
