[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh, let's go
Uh, let's go, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Uh, let's go, uh, let's go
I just like, need Phonte to write me a intro
That's what I need from him
Ghostwriting intros out this this motherfucker
Alright look, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Got a 9th Wonder beat, a dutchie, and the diet Coke
You better bring some fresh lungs if you tryin' to smoke
Tatted up sleeves, I'm a mac with that cheese
And these women show their titties when I'm rappin' on these beats
Please, don't fuck around cause I'm a rapper with a mill made
And who you kiddin', ride that flow that cain fill graves
Spendin' days in the shade to eat the rarest salmon
Chicks give me brains, but they dumber than a Sarah Palin
Sick of Republican bitches who think they know it all
If it could double they digits, they'd probably blow us all
I got the coldest flow with loader hoes who blow they nose
Into a holy rosary, got angels flying over me
My poetry with sound make you hit 'em, Jim Thome chief
Like Keef do, don't hate like all these people do
They playin' peek-a-boo with monsters for a week or two
Guarantee to hear about a murder when you read the news

[Break: Chuck Inglish]
Yea, check me out
I'mma let the beat breathe for a second
Thanks 9th Wonder, man
I ain't never rapped on none of your shit before, but
I'm about to do it right now

[Verse 2: Chuck Inglish]
When I speak, sit up in your seat
A sheik head wrap, make you think when I see
You feel what I say? (?) me how I play?
And I damn near spent a K on new paint
Pay me in gold, see all, be great
Men, raise your kids and we'll all be straight
Ace, infinite A's, Teslas, Benz
Damn, Chuck, you back on foreigns again?
A couple wins, I shop for the affordable deal
Cut the check my nigga, so I know that it's real
The most poppin', the livest out rhymin'
Nine hundred turbos out the lot, you could time me
Real quick nigga, hit the Tommy with the iron
Speed boat down the street, keep a eye out for the sirens

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
They say you can't take it with you, but I need it
Drawn tattoos in my tissue, gettin' weeded off the indica
My girl pussy tight like she dipped it in the vinegar
It's one of the reasons that I started gettin' into her
Ridin' around in that (?), kitted up, partner
You got a couple cars, but my shit just go harder
Be happy, be healthy
I'm smackin' these (?) with the zans for the low
And that old Benz truck roll good in the snow
You already know I rock the bulkiest, huskiest, chunkiest gold
And I'm in the stocks, I keep my eye on the market
You pretend a lot, it make you look like a target
Nigga bend the block, snake niggas venomous plot
Google maps on your iPhone to give it the spot
And location
All these apps so they could track yo ass
And tap yo line and snatch yo cash
I got the jellyfish tank with the Swarovski glass
Crystal clear, yeah they wear pistols here
For crystal dreams, cat schemes get you creamed
Whether it's pills or the lean, don't matter what you fiend

[Verse 4: Rapsody]
Black hoody, summer night, full as a Hummer tank
I'm gassed, fully drivin' you niggas nutty, I'm Tommy Hanks
Philadelphia sick, let me give you a clip
Burn through your marrow, my flow will touch you like hollow clip
Rap is the name, eh, twenty four one day
I spend all my time rhymin' so in timin' I'm black k
B momma, like your momma, give you life lyrically
From Rollywood to Hollywood, not even Diedre
Could detox for dopeness, 9th Wonder no coke needed
Get high, no weed neither, I spit that shit that cold ether
Rap is the name, eh, galaxy Foamposite
Rare as some stars, word to 9th Wonder he rockin' 'bout it

[Break: 9th Wonder]
Yeah, just a little roundtable discussion
Cool kids, Mac Miller, Rapsody
From Pittsburgh to Chi-town
To Raleigh-Durham
To Cambridge, 9th Wonder
