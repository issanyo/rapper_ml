[Hook]
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's (5 o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
The streets empty 'round 5 o'clock
Driving by the cops
Low key microscopic to the eyes that watch
Everything a hustle when you trying come buy some guap
I'm a keep grinding 'till I'm shining like a diamond watch
Me and bo-head bringing you the truth
With all night sessions we just living in the booth
Strong bars like we spitting out 150 proof
Take shots, get loose, 'till you spitting up yo' food (like ohh)
You see that? I'm a need a recap
Grab a weed sack chief that 'till my feet flat
I got this covered like a pro bowl d-back
Breathe rap and I been known to make the beat clap
Need cash so I'm trying to move some trees fast
Tell you where the meat at
Ask you where the cheese at
People 'round the city see the youngin' and respect the grind
Putting in the extra time
Guaranteed next to shine

[Hook]
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's (5 o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest

[Verse 2: Boaz]
I rise before the sun come up and get my day started
Pray to the most high, I roll up my haze and spark it
And then my paper starts to roll in
Money in paper bags
Hammers with laser tags
We grown men
Out on the corner 'till the early morn'
The blood of a hustler getting mines before I was born
You get stormed by these hot ass bars
From me and Easy Mac
Crusin' in the 'Lac smoking weed with no seeds in that
There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (why?)
Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us
They get the BBS's, radios play us
Then we blaze in the Benz's
And sit this off on BBS's
And from P.A to Texas
These niggas know about me
International hustler can't move no snow without me
Or get no dough without me
Niggas getting they stacking on
Early bird get the worm
I'm out here at the crack of dawn

[Hook]
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's (5 o'clock in the morning)
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest
