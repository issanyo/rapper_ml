[Hook]
If we could know where we was going to go
We'd probably never see tomorrow
So if I keep on making love to these songs
I'mma be good for the rest of my life
Hey, some people just don't want it
Hey, whatever it is, whatever it is
But I think I got it
Hey, whatever it is, whatever it is

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Aye, whatever it is, they're gettin' it straight
I'm too obsessed, too dedicated, never escape
I ain't scared, I'ma go in, lookin' like I'm glowin'
Runnin' on beats, you show me your feet, if you ever be down to flowin'
Now, I got a notion, I'mma put this into motion
Speedin' through the present, tryin' to get there and coach them
Hopes the smoke man will be there soon
For now the music up loud and the beat on smooth
I'm just rhymin', spittin' so efficient
Keepin' the tradition, while seekin' to be different
Just dropped K.I.D.S., but I'm a man of many words
You had to do it big, but couldn't never stop the work
Now you heard my words and your bubble gonna burst
Yeah we on third but say what's up to the homies on first
If I can, I'ma kick it, rip it just cause I love it
Now they see me, ask me to spit it right out in public

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, yo, rappers got time that they're wastin', hatin'
When they could focus on their own grind, skatin'
They mad I got fans and they mad I got love
Cause me and music fit like a glove, so snug
All you angry mothafuckers go and form a club
Cause when you come around me, it ain't nothin' but love
I got girls givin' hugs, people dappin' me up
And you in the corner, like, "Oh man, Mac sucks!"
Been a long grind and a little bit of luck
Feelin' blessed everyday for the way I'm comin' up
I can promise you this: I ain't even close to done
Just pray to god that I'm safe when the soldiers come
They hear me, they forgettin' if I'm old or young
Got this music on lock, but I open up
All the time, cause my bars and my rhymes be my lifestyle
Blowin' white clouds, I'm gettin' high right now

[Hook]
