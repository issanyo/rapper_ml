[Intro]
"I know what happens to you, me and everyone else
When they supposedly die
It's this passage around the great loop"
This music go with my funeral
Music go with my funeral

[Verse 1]
Said I was raised inside this gritty city
Riding through, you probably miss me
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me
All this sins be more than shitty, I just pray the lord forgive me
Doing drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
My side-bitch is sort of pretty but she got enormous titties
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them
Lord knows I turn a child to an orphan when I'm touring
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be
Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassing me
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't getting back to me
A shame that my tragedy my masterpiece, yeah
Trapped inside these dreams of mine
Just trying to get some peace of mind
Yeah, I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine
So you'll never get a piece of mind

[Hook]
It's the last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life
This the motherfucking last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life

[Verse 2]
See we swallowed in this web of lies, never try to exercise
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised
I heard the legends never died
Oh this lonely hell of mine
There never was a better time to better myself
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean
Staring inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open
I'm smoking on this field of hope, waiting till my deal gets closed
I keep getting hotter but all I seem to feel is cold
22 don't feel so old but I think I'm 82
You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?
I'm out here with the kangaroos, making danger, break the rules
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused
Happiness I take from you, searching for the naked truth
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
Bitch, check out the butterfly
If you the truth then what the fuck am I?
Yeah

[Hook]
It's the last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life
This the motherfucking last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life

[Outro]
So where are you going?
Where are you headed?
Where are you going?
Can I come? Can I come?
