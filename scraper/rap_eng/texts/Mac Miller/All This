We spending all this money
Getting all this shine
Hitting all this cuddi
Spending all this time
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for better or for
All this money
Getting all this shine
And its all so funny
Cause its all just fine
Im feeling better than ever before
This my life for better or for worse

[Verse 1]
I'm looking out the window
The kid stayin' lit like a Zippo
You hatin' I don’t trip bro
It's gravy cause your bitch know
Cup of henni, I sip slow
The spins, yo
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme call me Flipmode
This, that the other rhymer make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back, you reminisce on all your favorite classics
My words play more than madlibs
I got plenty lyrics
They got plenty adlibs
Want a holy spirit
My fathers on some rap shit
Listening to Tribe, getting high puffin loud
See some people ridin by
Come outside say what up
I ain't nothing like a star
I’m chilling, layin back
Travel all around the whole world
Enjoying everwhere I'm at
Meeting different people
Eating different food
No one like a gourmet meal
More than Que

[Verse 2]
They actin like they jealous
Everybody be thinkin’ that they was cool
Getting money since my mommy was dropping me off at school
Now I got a whip to cruise in
You the Pirates so you losin’
Im in the news, you let them bring your news in
I bowl strikes you always leavin a few pins
I do me you keeping up with them new trends
I got fam you worried about makin new friends
Im in my PJs you had to wear your suit in
Thinkin without doing, where, how, why me
Relax myself kick it like Tai Chi
You could find me, only where I’m at
There ain't no other Mes
They be checkin on my stats
How Cat I find them up in a tree
Homie be spittin bars they ain't fuckin with me
Im just turning up the heat to 100 degrees
Spittin like I got a razor blade stuck in my teeth
