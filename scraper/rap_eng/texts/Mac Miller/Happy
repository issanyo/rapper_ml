[Hook]
This what you'll been waiting for, ain't it?
Talking ya'll wastin' your hatred
Shit, Im just happy that I've made it
Im just happy that I've made it [2x]

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Coming live from the Burgh like the first time
Know what it is before you even hear the worst rhyme
Chosen one, the coldest soul, focus whole, so dauntless
And you know I'm from the PA...PGH
Where all the weed blaze
Where they work 3 jobs, no free days
Yo TreeJay, look what we made, and where we came from
So let them say somethin'
And let them hate us
And nuthin' change up
Forever came up, we made it
Let a motherfucker go say shit
One for the ages, this is one for the ages
It's outrageous, spectacular, how I use a vernacular
To rap a word, slap you backwards, shit has to hurt
Hit a home run and come back to first, yeah
Backstage, no passes work
With a light-skin bitch, get her ass to twerk, yeah
This the work of a master person
But it sound like Catholic church, God damn
Who the man with the hot hand?
They go nuts when I drop jams
I shake it up like a pop can
But I'm doing numbers like a motherfucking rock band
Yeah, won't stop till I'm
The motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
And I won't be not everybody's favorite
Not everybody's favorite
But I won't stop till I'm the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest

[Hook 2x]

Take you back to the basics
Yeah, here, face this
