[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ok, it's the high flying, sky diving
Hoes tell me five diamonds, mine and whining
Dropping gems with the finest timing
I'm eating acid, start to burn away my stomach lining
Coming with that fucking violence
Where's chaos, love is silent
My mom should've had another son
Maybe that would make my crazy ass less troublesome
I come in peace, but unleash this fucking beast inside me
You may need to CSI, investigate the scene when I leave
I start drinking whats inside my IV
I'm poison ivy and my voice is whiny
New car, yeah my toys is shiny
Drive it in the river, break the ice
Skate Monongahela in the winter
I'm a ninja, I might kick ya in your fucking head
This is Pittsburgh, you lookin' like a fucking guest
I got a mayor fucking bitches in the south-side
Tell 'em they can get a job, just to open up your mouth wide
You Mrs. Doubtfire, fake ass bitch
I keeps it constipated, we don't take no shit
Nothing for these hoes, lego my eggo trick
I'm a real a-hole, yeah ok
I'm with my bitch, watching Scandal in some Gucci sandals
Or whatever's on the movie channels
I drink whisky, start puking on my stupid flannel
Plot the tracing paper, I'm just tryna recreate a Van Gogh
The devil can't know my plans for destruction
The angels get eliminated, process of deduction
Red lights, rushing through it, nukes like I'm Russian
I paid a foreign nun to bring the drugs in
I put the dope in the dumplings, the coke by the onion
Snort so many lines, it's disgusting
Open up the blinds, see the white light
I'm getting wasted with a bum, start a knife fight
Putting lice in my bitch bed
Drink Windex and go and swallow a match
I got the right pipes, need to borrow some crack
Got a problem with that?
I'm doing drugs with the coastguard
Smoke clouds coming through the sonar
I can beat my own ass with a crowbar, cause I'm so numb
I don't even know where my toes are
This is Mozart, dope art
I'm gonna have a daughter, name her Rosa Parks

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Dude you not from still..
You know what I'm saying, from Pittsburg dude
You can't be down there in Hawaii
Down there doing Alohas
And jumping off mountains
You're not down here in the south-side, I don't see you

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ok, look I said it, um, I'm a bitch ass bitch
That's why pre-teen girls be like "this that shit"
But once they eighteen, they gon' kiss mac's dick
Goddamn, I'm on some mismatch shit
God hate me, the devil don't like me either
I'm posted up with a forty and a wife beater
Murder rappers, keep they bodies in the freezer
Snort coke and have a minor seizure
I'm lost in amnesia, threesomes with Venus
And Serena, I can dream, huh?
I really miss the lean, bruh
Bought my homie's team Jordans
Now they pissed off
