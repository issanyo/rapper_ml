[Intro]
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Yeah

[Verse 1]
She do whatever she like
And that just don't seem right
Make people so mad
They want her so bad
We was fuckin'â€”almost missed my flight
I wasn't even trippin', I said, "It's all right."
Goddamn, we was hit last night
Wouldn't you rather get along? Wouldn't you rather get along?
You was coughin' when you hit my weed, yeah
But I've never seen you feel that free, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So cute, you wanna be like me, yeah
Wouldn't you rather get along? Wouldn't you rather get along?

[Chorus]
Until, until, there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the clouds
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down
I can calm you down

[Verse 2]
Well I was busy when you hit my phone
But you miss me, tell me come back home
You don't really like to sleep alone
But I'm takin' too long, I'm always takin' too long
Yeah, baby, we don't need a trip, we could be right here
When the shit get weird, we could switch up gears
I wanna see them lips, kissin' ear to ear
I wanna hear your song
Ohh, I wanna feel just how you feel
Touch it one more time so I know you're real
We could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?

[Chorus]
Until, until, there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the clouds
And you, you don't gotta work harder, babe
I can calm you down
I can calm you down

[Outro]
I think we just might be alright, thank God
I think we're gonna be alright, alright, okay
Yeah, hold me close don't hold your breath
That's really your favorite, I know
I know, I know, I know
