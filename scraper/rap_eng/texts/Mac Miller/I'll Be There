[Hook: Phonte]
Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there
For the good times or bad, I’ll be there
Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there
For the good times or bad, I’ll be there

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
See I was 6 years old with a dream
When my Moms told me I can do anything
Said she’d be there forever
No matter what’s the weather
She’d always have my back even when we weren’t together
And I took her for granted
Thought I had a plan
This a different generation
I don’t think you’d understand
In the quest to be a man
You start to learn you need your family
It wasn’t for them, I’d be way closer to insanity
It ain't about the vanity
Think about what's important
The reason I was 6 years old rocking some Jordans
The reason I had food
My own damn room
A TV and a living room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her
The world’s best mother
Yeah it ain't fair
So I’ma take care of her and her gray hair
When I get rich, I’ll have her living how she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me cause it’s

[Hook]
Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there
For the good times or bad, I’ll be there
Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there
For the good times or bad, I’ll be there

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey, hey
Dear mama, please don’t start to cry
You the reason I’m alive
How these years have gone by
You were there when I was on my first bike ride - riding in the street
That delivery truck almost ran right over me
You were at my games when I was sitting on the bench
When I skipped school, you lied saying I was home sick
Had my back before I had my own
I know I’m always welcome when I’m back at home
I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say “wassup” before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now but remember being a kid when she fed you in your bed, shit
You were her baby, so find out what she doing lately, uh
I wanna tell you momma…

[Hook]
Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there
For the good times or bad, I’ll be there
Sunshine or rain, I’ll be there
For the good times or bad, I’ll be there
