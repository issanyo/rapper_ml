Once a day I rise
Once a day I fall asleep with you
Once a day I try, but I can’t find a single word

I wonder what they know
I wonder if they ever even cared at all
I wonder do they see their own reflection in the mirror and look away
Everybody is rushing
Why aren’t we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby I get high
Don’t ask me what I think
It never really mattered what I had to say
I just keep waiting for another open door to come out soon

Don’t keep it all in your head, the only place that you know nobody ever will see
You’re running low on the thread
No tears just keeping it real
And I think you got it now
Everybody keep rushing
Why aren’t we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby I get high
And everybody needs something
When they stuck on your mind
But every now and again they just getting by

Once a day I rise
Once a day I fall asleep with you
Once a day I try, but I can’t find a single word
