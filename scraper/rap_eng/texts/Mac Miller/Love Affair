[Verse 1]
Darling, I been waiting in the cold
Holding this umbrella for you
The raindrops make me feel romantic
Let’s run away, sail through the Atlantic
Two of us, such a wonderful pair
Stuck inside this love affair
Try to make you smile, that view is worth the while
The only one I call, all I do is hit redial
Why don’t you come and lay with me?
Let’s make a couple babies
I know we still so young
The idea seems crazy

[Chorus]
Your love makes every day of mine worth it
Sometimes I wonder if I even deserve it
Look in my eyes, you know how I feel
I know it’s real, girl, let’s close the deal

[Post-Chorus]
Ou—ou—ou, ah—ah—ah
Ou—ou—ou, la—da, da—da—da, da—da, da—da—da
Ou—ou—ou, ah—ah—ah
Ou—ou—ou, la—da, da—da—da, da—da, dum—dum

[Verse 2]
Darling, you and me strolling down the street
Talking 'bout our dreams throwing pebbles
I wanna hear 'bout everything you know
The places we could go, the songs that we could sing
The two of us, such a wonderful pair
Stuck inside this love affair
I know you like when I hold you tight
What’s your favorite color? Let me know and I’ll paint the sky
And all I wanna do
Is make love 'til the morning
A one way ticket to paradise
The love train is boarding (Baby, let's go)

[Chorus]
Your love makes every day of mine worth it
Sometimes I wonder if I even deserve it
Look in my eyes, you know how I feel
I know it’s real, girl, let’s close the deal

[Post-Chorus]
Ou—ou—ou, ah—ah—ah
Ou—ou—ou, la—da, da—da—da, da—da, da—da—da
Ou—ou—ou, ah—ah—ah
Ou—ou—ou, la—da, da—da—da, da—da, dum—dum
