[Intro]
Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing?
Just wanna ask a question, um, have you,  have you
Have you been in love, before?

You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should probably take your heels off
Cause you've been running through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain these days of rain
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still trying to find you, I'm looking for you babe
And I'm still trying to find you, through sunshine or rain
I love you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you got your stained glass iris
Diamond behind your eyelids, autopilot fly
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power
Swear there's something about her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug, in love to death
Feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream
So fuck the world, it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

[Hook]
Your love is not too kind, to me, yeah
You know my love is sugar sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind, is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and she is cool, calm and collected
I knew that you was the one
When I seen you leave me breathless
Say okay I need a second day today, give me attention
I want to take care of you
Marry you, something I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you're not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession
I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy (moan)
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen
Look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love that love was record breaking
I'm sick of waiting, yeah

[Hook]
Your love is not too kind, to me, yeah
You know my love is sugar sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind, is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

[Outro]
So gimme all of your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine
