Long days, longer nights

You keep startin' fights

Think you always right

Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight

Say you wanna leave me

It's just talkin' but I know you might

Now get along, now get along, now go

You sing along, now every song you know

You play your part, I'm playin' mine

You breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine

Since growing old is taking time

I'm acting like I'm 8 or 9

Tryin' to move on, talking to my old friends

See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them

Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that

Ripping people's hearts out, you to cute for that, cute for that

I've been on the same shit

We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language

I guess people always going through changes

Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

[Hook]
Said baby I got missed calls and emails

All going into details

About how you just not happy

And you think you gotta leave so

Go, go

I'll be fine on my own, own

Said baby I got missed calls and emails

All going into details

'Bout how you used to love me

I keep changing like the leaves, hell

Go, go

You'll be fine on your own, own

[2nd Verse]
She tell me, "You an asshole, superficial douche bag

Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back

Of all of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back

All the shit you buy me"

She said, "I want you back

I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends

It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when

I thought you used to be the one

I guess you don't have time

Cause all you do is grind and it's got me loose my mind

You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to

Think I'm bout to lose you"

I'mma end this now before things just confuse you

Kept breakin' promises you said you keep

So you can leave a message at the beep

[Hook]
Said baby I got missed calls and emails

All going into details

About how you just not happy

And you think you gotta leave so

Go, go

I'll be fine on my own, own

Said baby I got missed calls and emails

All going into details

'Bout how you used to love me

I keep changing like the leaves, hell

Go, go

You'll be fine on your own, own
