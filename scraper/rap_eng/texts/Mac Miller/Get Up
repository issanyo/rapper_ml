[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Bout to be big shit poppin' by the time this shit is droppin'
Stoppin' not a option, I’m addicted, it’s a problem
This way of life, sex, drugs, rock and roll on the road
Feeling blessed performin' for sold out shows
You rappers talkin' shit what you know bout those
What you know bout spittin' bars and the whole crowd goes
It’s unbelievable these people say I made it
Throwin down a little Henny, can’t believe that I don’t chase it
Life goes on, days get brighter
I’m feelin like I came in with my haze no lighter
So I’m lookin for the missing piece
Goin down in history for rippin’ beats
Smooth game sweeter than a Krispy Kreme
You tune into my station hope you listening
Turn it up and follow on my journey as I live my dream
All natural whole foods that lay you back
Have you straight chillin' in a dope mood
And some shit is happy like a show tune
This a brand new world I can show you
Some people still have no clue
But they can look at all this cheese that I produce

[Chorus]
In a world, that go round, are you up or you down
You in or you out
You smile or you frown
Just get up, get up
In a world, that go round, are you up or you down
You in or you out
You smile or you frown
Just get up, get up


[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ayo, I’m fast lane switchin', rap game spittin'
Chillin' with some sour, got a bad dame twistin'
These people think I’m goofy, say I’m Max they trippin'
Cause life a comedy like my last name Griffin
Livin' for the moment, blowin' potent overloaded
And my swagger call me old spice
Yeah the kid is so nice
Smokin' in the whip chillin, duckin' from the police
So bright you know lights, I’m shinin' like a strobe light
Leave a show with money and I always count my dough twice
Most Dope general, and that shit is for life
My mama taught me well so I even treat these hoes right, I’m polite
Workin' in my office, but no Dwight
Coke white skinded, no light dimness
Me who I am plain sight for these bitches
And I ain’t even tryna fight with these bitches
And I don’t got time to spend a night with these bitches
