Chorus (x2)
Aye yo Mac, what it is?
We wanna know what you sound like kid
So whatchu sound like?
Who you sound like?
How you sound like?
Why you sound like that?

Verse 1

I sound like old, (what?)
I sound like new, (uh-huh)
I sound like me
And I sound like you
I sound like yes
I sound like fresh, (fresh)
I sound like a bird first flyin' out the nest. (ah-hah!)
I sound like rap
I sound like rock
I sound like every single type of hip-hop
I sound like pain
& I sound like fame
I sound like water
& I sound like flames
I sound like cash
You sound like change, (cha-ching!)
I sound like style
& I sound like bang
Sound like trash
Sound like ecstasy
Sound like a harmony on a melody
To determine what I sound like
Please come listen
This ain't no ordinary white boy spittin'. (boy spittin'!)
Mac Miller
He'd a give you sound bytes, (what?)
So why do people wanna know what I sound like?

Chorus (x2)

Verse 2

I sound like death
I sound like life
Cause good things don't come around twice. (uh-huh)
I sound like feathers
And I sound like steel. (Yup)
Yeah, I sound like real
I sound like the next dude up to get a deal, (Thas' me!)
Sound like i'm hungry; never had a meal
I sound like heaven
I sound like hell
And it sound a lot better than it smell. (ah-hah!)
And it taste a lot better than it look like
So, i'ma make sure it cook right
It sound like Diddy vs. Suge Knight
Sound like [?]
Sound like the suburbs
Sound like the streets. (Yup)
Sound like a bomb
Sound like boom!
Sound like a kid writing raps in his room
Don't sound like your everyday rap cat spittin'
You wanna know what I sound like? Listen

Chorus (x2)

These motherfuckers know how I sound
I sound like fresh
I sound like the new
I sound like the motherfucking future
So if you ain't listenin'
Don't ask what I sound like
But if you know
Then you closer to the future
