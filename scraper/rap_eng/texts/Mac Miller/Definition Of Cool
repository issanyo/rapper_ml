[Hook - Mac Miller x2]
The definition of cool: that's me yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shooting free throws

[Mac Miller]
Ay yo first name Mac, and my last name Miller
On beats, I'm a monster, iller than Godzilla
Yeah my skin vanilla, I'm hotter than chinchillas
Hitting Vegas for the night and cop a villa
Get my lyrics from L, and my soul from J Dilla
Chillin with the sour cause some smoke'll kill ya
I'm just me, trying to cover all these magazines
And bitches trying to give me treats like it's Halloween
Lil old school flavor when it's Jerm on the drums
Dodge the bullet points like it's words from a gun
Spitting flames so they burning my tongue
Bitches wanna fuck, but they heard that I'm young
And they still do, I'mma stick around, call me mildew
Gonna stay in Bel-Air like Uncle Phil do
Get rich, go and buy me a mansion
And get my parents a nice crib up in the Hamptons

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
Jet Set general, roll like a innertube
Drinking on tiger's blood: that's what winners do
It seems that you like to hang from my genitals
Well, pause, oh gosh
It is I, the D to the I, with the two G's
Like it's Gucci attire
Why? Don't ask why, you so inquisitive
And the shoes I'm wearing are only limited
My word, was that a bit much? A tad
Didn't mean to rap, that was low class
Pardon my rudeness, that was so crass
And I'm always making moves
Cause I never procrastinate
The number one spot is up for grabs
Too late: what was that question you asked?
What is the definition of C-O-O-L?
If you haven't gotten it by now, well, oh well

[Hook x2]

[Mac Miller]
You ain't cooler than me, get a job bitch
You ain't cooler than me, empty pockets...
