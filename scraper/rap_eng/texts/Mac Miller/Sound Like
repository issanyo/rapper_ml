[Verse 1]
I sound like old, I sound like new
I sound like me and I sound like you
I sound like yes, I sound like fresh
I sound like a bird first flyin' out the nest
I sound like rap, I sound like rock
I sound like every single type of Hip-Hop
I sound like pain I sound like fame
I sound like water and I sound like flames
I sound like cash, you sound like change
I sound like style, and I sound like bang
Sound like trash, sound like ecstasy
Sound like a harmony on a melody
To determine what I sound like, please come listen

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I sound like death, I sound like life
Cause good things don't come around twice
I sound like feathers, and I sound like steel
Yeah, I sound like real
Sound like the next dude up to get a deal
Sound hungry like I never had a meal
Sound like heaven, sound like hell
And it sound a lot better than it smell
And it taste a lot better than it look like
So, I'm a make sure it cook right
Sound like Diddy vs. Suge Knight, sound like heat
Sound like the suburbs, sound like the streets
Sound like a bomb, sound like boom!
Sound like a kid writin' raps in his room
Don't sound like your everyday rap cat spittin'
You wanna know what I sound like? listen

[Outro]
These mothafuckers know how I sound
I sound like fresh, I sound like the new
I sound like the mothafuckin' future
So if you ain't listenin', then don't ask what I sound like
But if you know, then you closer to the future
Mac Miller, Eastern Empire
