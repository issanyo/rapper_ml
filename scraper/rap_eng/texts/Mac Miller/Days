[Intro]
Days, days, days
Days, days, days
Days, days

[Verse 1]
So who's that lady with her picture painted on my everything?
And what is she trying to say now?
I could probably spend my time thinking all about some better things
I've been floating for so long, think I'm ready to drown

[Bridge]
Said I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
Yeah I'm going down, down, down, down, down, down

[Hook]
I'm in way over my head these (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
Most (days)
Most (days)
Most (days)

[Verse 2]
I'm sticking to deprive 'em of it all
Something beautiful to brace my fall
Gotta find a melody
Gotta guide some memories
And don't believe in what they say
A predator will find his prey
Close your eyes and run around
They comin' now to hunt you down
And can open up the blinds let the light in, please
I get kind of tired of fighting
We need make love, we need to make love

Days, days

[Outro]
This is confusion, confusion
This confusion, confusion
There's a confusion, confusion
There's a confusion, confusion
There's confusion
