[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Well, who is he?
I be the meanest, putting Jesus' pieces on a fetus
The Lord taketh and he keepeth, one of many masterpieces
I'm, rolling up the weed, and feasting on gorditas
Your bitch a junkie, always sucking on somebodies penis
Ooo, I'm eatin' generals, so it's chicken off the fine china
I put my dick inside your bitch and say the our father
Young Moses, part Wahlberg
Head Wrapped, car bomber
Death trap, dark slider
Jump, I motherfucking got ya, once I dropped ya
Who's hot?
I moonwalk the Jungle GYM
Do not try to stop, cause you not gon' fuck with him
I'm rumblin' with countrymen
Do it for the USA
First you get the money, then the fame, then you get paid
Allayboomyay!
Come with superhuman strength
All this for the music's sake
But I'm getting stupid paid
Get ahead or lose a leg
Never did the funeral fake
To be great, you await
Everybody lets eat cake!

[Hook: Big Boi]
And ya don't and ya don't and ya don't stop

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, I'm sipping liquor 'til my liver pop
And playing tennis with cinder blocks
I'm in the spot
Chillin' with some nympho thots
Landed on the Planet Rock
Man to God, Hammerhead Shark in human camouflage
God damn, I'm on
Understand the plan is strong
Lead singer, came with Keith Richards, brought the band along
I'm pretty zen, lady
Head spinning, it's 1080
They say that I went crazy, but love me when the check clear
Red beard
See into the future, fear the end near
Bitch, I want it all, I will not give you not a cent here
This is not pretend, I'm trynna pay some pricey rent here
It's no words
Send in Goldberg and you gon' get speared
Do the most, I'm the host, and the special guest here
It's a fucking party started, everybody get weird
Take your pants off, move your body, you can dance around
I got you shitting in your pants, you wearing pampers now
Mean flow, hittin' free throws
Shoot em' granny style
Came a long way from rocking hand-me-downs
Err-Err, Fresh
I said the world is just a big gazebo
So, baby, let's get married in it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Well, mornin' Mr. McCormick
Mister should have been aborted
Mister Mighty Morphing sperm
Might absorb this Nike fortune
Money makes me feel important, like some type of vital organ
Rich people give poor advice, never could afford it
Walk into the jewelry store
Spendin' all my money
What did I do this for?
Pussy on my mustache
Never clean it up cause I'm a dumbass
