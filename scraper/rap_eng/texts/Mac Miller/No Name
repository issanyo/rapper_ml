I just ain't gotta see these sad people who got raised up with that means
Most empty hands on the wheels, warmin up by the fears they on ride through the hills
Fuck around once on a high slope and I gone hear them cry life's a flop
I know people aimin high makin plans to get this money on to grow
Not even sitting they playin games betting that they will get this hoe
Say they master of their life until that they're broke
Then seein life as a hole diggin till touch on some gold
But I ain't wanna spend a whole life in a hole
Imma build and stand tall on my lands, live it by my own laws
Got two boats people rent, damn business for my time, guess who's fuckin director
I'm improvin once the chance there, my mind workin like a detector
Got my whole future in the hands, hope enough time to make it
Now I stop this pimpin I'm comin back to ya, not sure that I gave ya enough hits, yeah bitch
Gettin prepared for a post life, chekin out some LV pants
Askin yourself if it will fit, tryna make a complete plan
But you distract from the matter, you gon fall off the bridge
You feelin weak, you can't see end of the road, no wonder, no lane switch
Riches gonna be rich and poor gonna be poor
Ain't gotta work low if you wanna turn a
Ruined nigga into a nigga that merit dollars more
Hold the soul far from all wrong thoughts
Make a pure living without influence cause the smallest fault
Could be the biggest fall

Hook:
Nigga don't hang around, I like them niggas doin independent shit
No tags featuring my name, no headlines, I'm no name, It's self made shit
It's heart made, I'm beatin hard to bring head minds on light
Don't need no expensive shit
It's not a name who'll recover the fund of my art, the pain way deeper in the heart
It's bleedin out the pen and shit

Verse 2:
No shit no shit, I'd feel good the way everybody look at me
VIP shit, get through each door like I'm portunes holy keys
Got money to control, vices aren't consuming free
I know youths gettin faded and shaded and then hope that they'll make it
And cursin their future family tree by plantin these seeds
Say I'm too valuable of my life to get this weed
And say I should be yelling through the plains but I feel
How the system faked me born me with a silver spoon in the hands and greed
Fated to show my will, now they all see the bill
Now they want ball but spill over their mentality of mill
I know people grindin hard blaming me
For not being thankful, say I'm high and chill
Why the fuck feel I like my life ain't filled ?
Do I yet consider what I have or am I high on a trip ?
Is it my style or it's surroundings who're ill?
Human being diverse like a zoo but everyone still want it in his grill
I would put my enemies on a grill, swearin if the stake be there they would get evils
And it hurts to know that's the supposed company we live with
When everybody look at you, maybe McQueen shirts'll cover you
But one day, you'll have to tell the truth, to proof to the world you ain't no fool
Pray the angels grant a panda fur coat for a cold love
At least two bank accounts for my ladies, your job to spend it
Scopes turned towards me, complexion skills are lean
People sucking dick for piece of my kind, nothing of the shit is real
I just guess I'm too valuable of my life too live it free
Blue, white and red three questions mark an ethnicity and a riddle for me

Verse 3:
Claim it's my first first rap but my bars deeper you ever would expect
Life on a line but you blinded by the masses, only tryna follow fashions
Busy by your dope life, no time to be wise, I know you never had this education
Anyway it not seems in range of your imagination
Don't worry I'll give to ya, just lay back to your elations listening to my phrases
A quiet nap implicates a dozen of benzos
Couples of xanies because the pressure keeps holding me on
I know that's what they sippin when they call it a living and my finger is 'bout to make a killing
If they ask where I'm at, answer is I'm writin this, I just followed my instinct, that's the way it is
I didn't follow how the problems was pilin, though I could solve them peelin off and takin pills in
Much history in the tree I'm from, the mark ain't no scar, you don't know my sore
I 'member five years when my mom was poppin bottles on every friday
Ten years later we still not seen the payday
Her pain was her man, father's psychotic behavior'll never get away
Lord did life hard but lord did right cause now I'm here to tell her bad plays
I don't fault her, she's only human, I forgive, I know better days are on the way
Get in my shoes for a week and you'll stumble
I really don't like this style of being not humble
If you don't see through my eyes the tears that are stuck
You are danger for me, I just gotta keep duck
