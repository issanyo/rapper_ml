[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ridin' with the window down, rollin' through the city
Got the weed goin' round and the MOST dope with me
Hey, simply gettin high like it's 1969
I'm a be grindin' till the kid a-hundred-sixty
New York, Atlanta too, flyer than Santa's shoes
She bring her camera through, I'm playin' crash bandicoot
This be the bitch, got some cock to serve her
I'ma rape the game, no Roethlisberger
Hey, above the clouds, seein' stars like L.A
Have your girl always comin' back like Elway
I'm a be rich, that's what they tell me
So let me start workin' with this paper like an essay
Hey, athleticism, workin' game when I'm gettin' women
The freshest linen, like I'm spittin' through your television
In a daydream, living while these minutes pass me by
Lean back and hang these Nikes out the ride
Just

[Hook]
Role the windows down, turn the system up
We just trying to ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Rocking khaki colored jeans, and a plain white T
Nike watch, Pow chain, spend a day like me
Hey, everyday like a movie scene
Smokin' weed, eyes glued to the computer screen
I'm Super duper skeed, ridin' in the Civic
Just got some speakers, now I'm tryin' to get it tinted
Every dream vivid, talk it how I live it
Uh, up in the air playing 'quidditch', bitches
This is, once in a lifetime
They gonna put me in a flight, no Priceline
Used to want to be in Marvel, fightin' crimes
Till I realized the boy had the nicest rhymes

[Hook]
Role the windows down, turn the system up
We just trying to ride around, cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey let's just hit the road
