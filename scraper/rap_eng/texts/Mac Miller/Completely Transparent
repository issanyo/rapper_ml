(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Uh, yeah, yeah
Trapped in the middle of a stampede
Can you catch the beginning of a riot
Will I last? I'm trying but I can't breathe
The Devil is on dial
I was so polite and quiet
Been fighting my thirst of violence
My mind is without a pilot
I've never felt so alive, Uh
I'm laughing while I sleep
I told my nightmares, "Remove the shackles from my feet"
The evil wanna massacre the weak
But, still we smile when we pass them in the street, so
What would you do if you had one day left?
Try to live your whole life before the Sun take rest
God told me he just wanna watch his son play chess
In a park on a Sunday, yeah

(Refrain: Tay Walker)
(ooh, uh oh, ooh uh oooh)
Ooh! Blur my vision until I'm blind
Then I fade away
It's so lonely on this hill of mine
But still I climb
But still I climb
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But still I climb
But still I climb

(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
Yeah
We are all products of addiction
Live inside a fictional world that we call utopia
It's filled with phobias
Send them to Estonia
Grew a little older and got lost in California
Yeah, we the lonely ones
Colder than a frozen Sun
My veins contain more poison than any cobra's tongue
And I don't give a fuck if i'm the chosen one
'Cause everybody tryna be Napoleon
I'm good where I'm at
Hidden in the shadows, I'm a train with no track
A game with no score
Things ain't the same as before
Swallow all your happy pills
I'ma rain when it pours
Wonder what I have to say to the Lord
Shit, I don't even have a lot to say anymore
Wanna live life fast
Careful, 'cause you might just crash

(Refrain: Tay Walker)
(ooh, uh oh, ooh uh oooh)
Ooh! Blur my vision until I'm blind
Then I fade away
It's so lonely on this hill of mine
But still I climb
But still I climb
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But still I climb
But still I climb

(Verse 3: Mac Miller)
Yeah, um
They may ask ya, "Who's your master?
Is it your father or your pastor?"
Illusions, who turn your bliss into disaster?
And when did everything start moving backwards?
I cast spells on the wicked
I dwell with the different
And I don't need no help 'cause myself has a vision
They think you' sick, quick to yell for prescriptions
Just keep your numbness on the shelf in the kitchen
Listen, this might be your last chance
God damns all the sinners and the advanced
On a beach of blacks sand
As high as a bad plan
But I know the feeling like my back hand
So, fuck the ribbons and the merit
Me? I'm just a ghost;
Completely transparent
And lately, I've been living careless
I'm just a ghost though;
Completely transparent
Now, let that mari-nate
