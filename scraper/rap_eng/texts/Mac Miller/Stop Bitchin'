Stop bitching, stop bitching, stop bitching
Stop bitching, stop bitching, stop bitching
Stop bitching, stop bitching, stop bitching
Should they go change and nobody gonna listen
You
Just stop bitching!
Got your favorite sentence
Aha, these other bitches just table tennis, aha!
Put some weed with some rice in this
Aha, that's spicy Jamaican, that's
You for hating
Rap shit is nice, but I might need some fragrance
I'll be that rap all the white people playing
The game is changing in these radio stations
Can show 'em dollars, and I'm the scholar
Hip hop today
Fr Dray won't get the chronic play
And that's a shame, a shame
Just some shit I gotta handle
I get these bitches a little something they can dance to
I ain't gonna be a s how that gets canceled
You ain't like
Mother f*cking channel
My hip hop people start feeling your pain
But it ain't no reason to just sit and complain
F*ck rap, all is whack
These cream mother f*ckers say it's all for the catch!
So if you're single, single
Then you can stack chips like Prinkcles
You see that chick that you like, say f*ck you
They go back to blessing the mice
Forever, but it's stressing the fight
And money makes it easier to rest here at night!
Paying on soldier boy, it sure happened
Look at him laughing, he know he ain't that good at rapping!
You can hate, but it ain't gonna solve shit
It's gonna evolve quick
That's the music I don't bump and bang, but it is what it is
Let 'em do their thing!
Stop bitching, stop bitching, stop bitching
Stop bitching, stop bitching, stop bitching
Stop bitching, stop bitching, stop bitching
