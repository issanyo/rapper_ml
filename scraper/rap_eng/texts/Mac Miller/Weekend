[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Yo, now

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets
Roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins
I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me?
Get me healthy
Keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin'
Like, fuck it, we ballin'
Now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling
I'm chilling, just living
I'm burning away
Conversations we having
I'm getting too static
Too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

[Hook: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

[Post-Hook: Mac Miller]
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browser
Like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

[Hook: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

[Outro: Miguel]
Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m in, gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit with you, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always
The start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it
But, baby, it’s gon be alright, ha, alright
