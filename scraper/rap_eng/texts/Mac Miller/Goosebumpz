[Verse 1]
Better act right, 'cause I smack dykes
Give 'em blow and a bit of that bagpipe
Bitch wanna live that rap life, but I already hit that last night
Think you're fuckin' with me, huh? Must be hittin' that crack-pipe
I be makin' my money, thank God I learned how to add right
My cash like that cocaine, give me more, say, give me more
Don't worry 'bout it, ain't no thing, big titty hoes in my videos
Classy bitch, don't kiss and tell
Smack her ass and then wish her well
Life sucks, better give 'em hell
Get money, fuck girls, free Biggavel
A million in my briefcase, 'bout to shop for some real estate
'Bout to party with drugs though, turn it up, bitch, feel the bass
Throwin' money in your face, feelin' good, livin' great
Bad bitches in different states, it's like I think I'm Vincent Chase
With porn stars, sports cars, and my crib got a courtyard
How we get all this money though?
You know how big his tours are?
Greedy bitch, you a needy bitch
Want some money, but need some dick

[Pre-Chorus]
And my belt monogram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram
My hologram

[Chorus]
We in my black Benz, windows up
Gettin' head, smokin' blunts
Everybody know what's up, and I turn them girls to sluts
Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed
We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop
'Cause all we do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she, all she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck

[Verse 2]
Don't I look like a drug dealer? Don't I look like I'm somebody?
Killin' beats with that Murder Inc, don't I look like I'm Irv Gotti?
Ridin' through in my hippy van
You broke bitches don't give a damn
You softer than the Michelin man
Your bitch put her pussy on Instagram
Better go hard when my flow starts
They brand new with they old cars
Your pockets is on low carbs, she do a show, she a pollstar
In the penthouse, with the pants down
With the camera out, no hands now
Them hard drugs, we don't ran out
Can't believe that's somebody grandchild
She's so bad but I like it, wanna hear your pussy, I'll mic it
My credit card bill is righteous but, girl, that ass is so priceless
Spend the night with the right bitch, my dick ill, my pipe sick
Small pussy, tight fit, she loves to sniff that white shit
Fuck free, no charge, I play the pussy like Mozart
Eat that pussy, I won't starve
Love the pussy with my whole heart
Bitch named Layla my Clapton ho
Give me head, put the Benz in captain mode

[Pre-Chorus]
And my belt monogram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram

[Chorus]
We in my black Benz, windows up
Gettin' head, smokin' blunts
Everybody know what's up, and I turn them girls to sluts
Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed
We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop
'Cause all we do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she, all she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck
