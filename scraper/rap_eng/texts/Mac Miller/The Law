[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Love, yeah, love
Love is the law, love is the only law
Love is the law, love is the only law, yeah
Love, yeah
Love is the law, love is the only law
You should, you should do thou wilt
You should…

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
See I was thumbin' through the mail, fishin' for a feed
To feed my female, A-S-A-P
Nature is a mother
And life is a bitch, I am convinced
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time (Ayy!)
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time (Ayy!)
Take your time, baby!

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I get the feelin' that you only playin' hard to get
‘Cause you ain't forget how much I love a challenge
I know we were divided to restore the balance
Hope I still get you wet while you bendin' over backwards
Watchin' over me in ecstacy, expectin' me
Your number is 6 and 50 interestingly
I hope you're still blue, with golden ovaries
On your tippy toes for me, just how you 'posed to be
They spoke of us in Cairo quite some time ago
How these Adamines adapt to this is incredible
They love to go to sleep but hate to be awake
Treat the eye of Horus as if it's just a symbol
Unattainable, they read the wrong rights
They see the signs but ain't see what the sign saw
But luckily, uh, love is the only law, uh
Love is the, Love is the only…

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
See I was thumbin' through the mail, fishin' for a feed
To feed my female, A-S-A-P
Yeah, nature is a mother
And life is a bitch, I am convinced, yeah
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time, yeah
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time
Take your time, baby!

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Love, love
‘Cause all my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
And you the only one that know what I mean
You know what I mean

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
And they say our separation was sacrificial and all
But I'm in awe
These hybrids gettin' high, but they don't get it at all
The pain of division is nothin'
The joy of disillusion is all, but all in all, man
I know you a modest Scarlet Woman
Like to say you everything but nothin'
But you nothin' but my everything
How shall I explain? Ayy, Mac

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
See I was thumbin' through the mail, fishin' for a feed
To feed my female, A-S-A-P
Yeah, nature is a mother
And life is a bitch, I am convinced, yeah
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time, yeah
God comin', she just takin' her time
God comin', she just takin' her time
Take your time, baby!

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
Can't forget about the Queen

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Queens, we are noddin' back
Understand we are his back
And when he puts the arc in your back
Understand that we took him to Heaven
Where those golden arcs are at
Golden as sundrops, Queen
When he looks in your eyes
You show him where the stars are at
And your beautiful, beautiful darkness
And in return he replies that
"Girl, I'll be your knight, your knight in shining armor
‘Cause you're my heart, Queen"
And lying on his chest our hearts beat box
And you and I are queens
We remind him that he can be all ours
‘Cause we all gods
And God is Queen and God is love
And love stays above all
Heaven, stars, queen, God, God

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Love, love, love
Love is the law, love is the only law
Love is the only law, love

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Ayo, Bentley, remember that chick you brought by the studio?
You thought that was your woman, your woman
Ain't your woman, she's Soul's woman
It's love though, B, it's love, yeah
