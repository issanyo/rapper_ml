[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Billy blickity, blickity blank, blankin' out
Tryna get it warmer than the Cayman Isles
Like these Jordans they fought in, I got this many styles
That these niggas can't seem to file
Little league of my own, like pitchin' off the mound
With boobs, fallopian tubes, these dudes gon' know me now
I'm serial
Killin' at willin' and feelin' very proud
AP, I owe you and I ain't talkin' vowels
Huey P, double D, I swear it's the future now
Cold and I be pushin' this itish to leave you all astound, brown
No Z, they know we holy
The illest boldy to point break in between the new and all the goldies
Oldies that molded the many ways I flow it
Kickin' this itish, they catchin' like a goalie
[?] never dare, just like the police
Forever these niggas scared, they want no more beef
'Cause we killin' like reef, my flow is deep sea
Fire, retire, never these degrees
Press fire, the sire sweat and my heat team
Jamla the acaddy, coolie respect the seams
That we sewin', I guess I really go in, no dream
So they callin' me, now I glow [?] with ring
Torchin' 'em with the torch I carry
Like Roman mortuaries
Dig it though like bury, I buried it and married it
And accept responsibility, no arrogance
Had a talk with my nigga, you know, some therapy
'Cause Digga holla'd and she really seem to care for me
Rah Digga, what up?
Guess they darin' me, darin' me, double darin' me
Pairin' me, I'm apparently narrowly, ball from [?]
'Barrassing, I'm embarrassin' merrily all these niggas
Concentratin' on labors and bigger figures
Movin' up in this world, I hear they dig us, dig it?
Dig a class, spazz on these niggas and have these niggas trippin'
Rewindin' my verse, hearse, I really kill it
Shout out to the ones in here who really feel it
Feel it, feel it, like Dennis the Menace to the finish
Tryna carry on for my lineage, I know my flow is [?]
See me not, forever hot
Went in on the jawn without nothin' left to jot, Rap

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Dear money, yes I want you
Fuck it, girl, I need you
Is this the real world or is it just another preview?
Now in division one, started out in D2
Used to rock some baggy gear, now I look like GQ
Meet me and they tell me that they fuckin' with the movement
Would they still if I didn't have millions of YouTube hits?
Dropout student, not stupid
Pure music, clean your ears like a Q-Tip
Back on my bullshit, spittin' what I know about
My people tryna party so we lookin' for an open house
Every day kid shit, that's just how we like this shit
Car cost a hundred grand, but my life is priceless
Can't put a price on talent
Surrounded like an Allen
Late night music like The Roots and Jimmy Fallon
First name Malcolm, that's on my birth certificate
Talkin' it, I'm livin' it, thinkin' they gettin' sick of it
Wishin' that they could finish it, listenin', now they in the whip
Permission to get and spit, sweeter than all this licorice
Weed crumbs on my passenger seat
New joint bein' smoked, better pass it to me
They notice how the boy tend to spazz on a beat
Middle finger up to everybody laughin' at me
'Cause I'm doin' what I wanna do, inhalin' marijuana fumes
Why you interested in the people that I'm talkin' to?
Why you wanna call it quits 'cause ain't nobody stoppin' you
You doin' what you gotta do, need someone to sock it to
I get a [?] will do
This is somethin' easy, soft and smooth
So watch me move
