[Hook x2]
Had some baggy gear, now my clothes tailored (x2)
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback (x2)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, I used to rock a double XL
Now the ladies all say I dress well
With a nice pair of jeans, LRG or Evisu
Crew neck sweatshirt, hat and some clean shoes
Pockets stayed equipped with some paper and some gold piff
Pack of gum, squares, Blackberry and a phone clip
Got Most dope Clique, bunch of mothafuckers lookin' fresh
Crooks and castle dress, sloppy sloppy haters shouldn't mess
Walkin' by your lady and I'm sorry if I took her breath
You was just baby, cryin' til you end up shook to death
(Bitch,) fade away like an Etch A Sketch
Don't second guess, ain't nobody better dressed
Text hoes wearin' less clothes than her mama like
Church girl, always go to school, she the honest type
But when it comes to boys she like 'em bad
So holla at the kid I got swag

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Knick knack paddy whack, give that boy some clothes
Imitate the kid, you may get yourself some hoes
Snap back, flat cap, abstract swagger
Kid come correct never messin' up the pattern
Y'all jigsaw puzzle, mismatch mess
Got my J's on with some jeans lookin' fresh
Yes, my colors match
And I ain't no other cats lookin' like the kid, yeah none of y'all fuck with Mac
You rockin' somethin' that lookin' like a lumberjack
How you wearin' 3 different t-shirts under that?
Teach you how to dress real stylish, I'm the wildest
Nothin' on me lookin' childish
Fire talk, I am hot
And, y'all is just some mild sauce
Got my clothes tailored, fit so nicely
Soon you'll see these mothafuckers dressin' just like me
