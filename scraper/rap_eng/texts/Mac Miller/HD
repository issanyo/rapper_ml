[Intro: Choo Jackson]
Yup, yup, yup
Hey, yup, hey

[Verse 1: Choo Jackson]
Please Young Choo, tell me how you feel
I just stay turnt like the Wheel of Fortune wheel
And I stay shining like Paul Wall grill
I don't fuck with pigs cause you know that nigga squeal
Call Mass Appeal, I think I need an interview
Mortal Kombat cause my outfit bout to finish you
Y'all are lame and boring like an interlude
I just be working, I do this shit from ten to two
Money is power but pussy it devours
Tryna get paid, I ain't fucking you for hours
Shoes all white like I stepped up in some powder
Tryna stay high but life is a downer
Everyday's a fee when your living ain't free
Couple old bitches and I know they hate me (Bitches)
Swimming in the women and I think I'm waste deep
Turn on your TV cause I live in HD

[Hook: Choo Jackson]
You better watch me
I know you love to watch me
So just turn on your TV
And you could probably see me
I said watch me
I know you love to watch me
Cause nigga I'm in HD
My nigga I'm in HD

[Verse 2: Choo Jackson]
You in trouble now, don't ask me to dumb it down
Every time I come around these hoes just be fucking now, holy cow
If there is a problem, I'm sure that we could work it out
I don't talk to snakes and you looking like a serpent now
Never do drugs, that is what my momma told me
Now I'm getting high, shout out to my big homie
Are you playing defense cause I think that I'm Kobe
Stacking this for four weeks, got green like a four leaf
Clover, I know her, I showed her
She rode it like a bull, I gave her the dozer
That ass so fat it's making my toes curl
Wait who we talking about, it probably be your girl
And that's how the world is
Man my generation so selfish
But you know these niggas can't help it
Tryna go against me almost got a death wish, that's no joke

[Hook: Choo Jackson]
You better watch me
I know you love to watch me
So just turn on your TV
And you could probably see me
I sad watch me
I know you love to watch me
Cause nigga I'm in HD
My nigga I'm in HD

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
This is just another cry for help
I'm moving to Jerusalem, assume I crucify myself
The flow inside the fire melt the diamonds to Orion's Belt
Splash into a giant well, motherfucking cannon ball
Yeah I got the long sleeve Polo on
Groupies sucking dick, I'm busting quick cause they don't know my song
And Choo love bitches so we go along
Fuck her in my guest room, the pussy helps stress too
(Aight, hold on)
Your heart's broke and you need to get your pockets fixed
You done a lot of work, it shall remain anonymous
The flow is bottomless, it come around like karma quick
And boys turn to men at the end of the road, yeah
Ain't nothing more important than your family
I can do without the money and my sanity
I bust a nut, put the condom on the vanity
Only ones with ID Labs tatted, that's E. Dan and me

[Hook: Choo Jackson]
You better watch me
I know you love to watch me
So just turn on your TV
And you could probably see me
I sad watch me
I know you love to watch me
Cause nigga I'm in HD
My nigga I'm in HD
