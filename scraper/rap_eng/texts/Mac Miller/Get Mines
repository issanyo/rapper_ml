[Intro]
I'm tryna get mines
Tryna get mines, (?) at a time
(If you from Pittsburgh then you know what it is)
(Cause around here we gettin' money)
(Ain't no other options to it)
Easy Mac I'm just tryna get mines
I'm just tryna get mines
(For the money)

[Hook]
I'm just tryna get mines
You just gotta get yours
So if you wanna kick around and you try to cross the line
Then you better be ready for war
Tryna get mines
Tryna get mines
So if you wanna kick around and you try to cross the line
Know that I'm just tryna get mines

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna get mines
Get a dollar and a dime
If you try and take it break your collar and your spine
I'm one of a kind, money followin' my rhymes
See the cash on the table? Well all of it is mine
Pockets full of 20s cause I'm all about my money
Goin' home every night with a Playboy bunny
Money, money, money all about the cream
Rules everything around me, nothing here is free
See Easy Mac, he be all about his cheese
Fresh white T, matchin' kicks lookin' clean
A crispy fitted cap with a hoodie to match
Show up to the party askin' where the pussy is at
Spit game so easy like this shit on beginner
I'm gettin' bitches naked fast, quicker than a stripper
Rollin' up a swisher full of the finest green pines
I'm just tryna get mines

[Hook]
I'm just tryna get mines
You just gotta get yours
So if you wanna kick around and you try to cross the line
Then you better be ready for war
Tryna get mines
Tryna get mines
So if you wanna kick around and you try to cross the line
Know that I'm just tryna get mines

[Verse 2]
I put spells on the beats, flippin' L's full of tree
I'm a man on fire, Denzel basically
I'm like hell with my heat, I'm too hot
Easy Mac but don't forget the jukebox
See, that's my name don't wear it out
And if you don't hold your tongue I'ma tear it out
You and your mans talkin' shit? You can share a mouth
See I"m the best right now, I don't care what's out
Cause I'm just tryna get mines with the money on my mind
Stayin' on the grind like a clock and the time
I'm a hot rhymer, even better writer
Scarin' MCs, make 'em up and shit they diapers
Cause they just see what they can
Battle cats'll have to cry and pee in they pants
There goes Easy Mac
He got some good trees, let me get a G of that

[Hook]

So if you wanna kick around and you try to cross the line
Then you better be ready for war
Tryna get mines

So if you wanna kick around and you try to cross the line
