[Intro]
Uh, The Ill Spoken
2008 shit
(Ahaha) We had to take it back
P Dub and Easy Mac

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Life changed since the old days how it all used to be
The buffoonery, and dreams of buying jewelry
The class can't learn 'till a student teach
I gave a lecture wrote a stupid speech
Back in the days The Ill Spoken riding ATV's
Performing on TV there at JPB
It was 4 years ago seemed like so long
In the attic smoking coming up with dope songs
Never knew I'd be a star back then
I was trying to get money for a car back then
I just wanted to record back then
Never had a lot to do we was bored back then
All them day's at the Shadow Lounge selling tickets getting shows
We was trynna tell the world we was the next to blow
Even beef with some dudes up in Canada
Had a little battle spit our bars in the camera
We stayed up late making mix-tapes
That we gave out trying to get our name out
Doing shows no one knew us
They would boo us, knew that when we grew up
They be asking for a verse I'm blowing back dutches
Still got love for my dudes on rap mullet
Man that grind was tough we wasn't getting far
Still rolled up to show's with more cars than people in attendance
Most of the people they were people we was friends with
The best shit but, it got expensive when we couldn't sell tickets
Wasn't doing much but trying to be the illest
At your crib smoking weed and raps
Grinding hard, cause music we believed in that
We had some differences yes, but for real we've been blessed
You the homie man I wish you the best

[Hook: Mac Miller & Samples]
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real
I remember way,way back in the days
Every aspect is vivid, (the Ill Spoken)
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real (Yuh)
Drop flows that is hot fa'sho (Ill Spoken)
I never thought that we would make it up this far (Beedie)

[Verse 2: Beedie]
Life a times, that we recharge
Fresh out the weed jar, run that bih like a seesaw (haha)
Been 3 years since we dropped a song
Got me thinking 'bout them days that we talking on
Staying, up hella late 'till we passing out
Just trynna face a 8th Jimmy pass the loud
At my mom's house Point Breeze north south
Circle room smoking yo, we blow the back porch out
Mac was still in High School, While I was at the day job
Afterwards we lingered for, attracted to the stage y'all
Most them cats hatin too, face who wanna face off
Stories like "ey, sup"
Boy I'll tear your face off
From a fantasy your getting on
We had the Talent and Drive, like we just can't go wrong
Can't forget our first video, from any raw
Quality was really raw
But them kids was really haaard (word)
We made it catchy, like we blocking Gretzky
Nowadays you couldn't miss me like the cost is risky
Dreams turn to business, business turn to paper
Turn the pages of the book and watch us turn to something major
And always puttin' labor, even if they try to label us
With elements to change the game call the labels up
And we was naive probably got soy loadin' up business for the quality
From freestylin' we kneel, to watching you up on TV studying how it be doe
You my man, seen a real up and down the starter
Second hand give me unique respect of on it
And when you signed with Rostrum
Made me realize this shit was real and I ain't lost
No bridge that I ain't cross
And we some kings, I'm mom's Capricorn
Til the castle gone, we Ill Spoken

[Hook: Mac Miller & Samples]
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real
I remember way,way back in the days
Every aspect is vivid, (the Ill Spoken)
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real (Yuh)
Drop flows that is hot fa'sho (Ill Spoken)
I never thought that we would make it up this far
