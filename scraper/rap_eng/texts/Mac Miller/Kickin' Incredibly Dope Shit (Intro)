[Intro: Telly & Mac Miller]
When you're young, not much matters
When you find something that you care about
Then that's all you got
When you go to sleep
At night you dream of music
When you wake up, is the same thing
It's there on your face, you can't escape it
Sometimes when you're young
The only place to go is inside, that's just it
Music is what I love
Take that away from me and I really got nothing
Ha ha!
This shit right here, feels like a million bucks
Jerm, make sure I'm coming through clear here
Most Dope, what it is
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to K.I.D.S

[Verse 1]
Motherfucker, I feel like the hardest working kid in America
Playing with the pros, I remember being amateur
But now I'm rocking shows, see the lights from the camera
Phones
See my people and their hands is up
Yeah the game a girl trying to tease but don't plan to fuck
My older brother told me that I'm finally manning up
Cause I've been a fuck up if you ask me
But I'm still praying that my teachers gonna pass me
Letters from my soul
Scriptures from the Torah
Only give you what you like
I'm a station on Pandora
Rock a sag, my girl tell me pull my shorts up
Rock solid homie
I'm built Ford tough
Sip a little lean
Smoke a little weed
We just trying to keep it cool
So we blast the AC
Some people hate me, tell 'em it's all gravy
Yeah you got your team but I'm fighting with the navy
Battle to the top
We in it to win it, we won't stop
No more going to stores
But don't cop shit
Never go another day with empty pockets
Houston you there?
We balling like the Rockets
And now these eyeballs dropping out their sockets
High honor roll but not thinking about a college
In love with these rhymes, want the cover of Time
Man of the year, got my image stuck in your mind

[Interlude]
Hold up one second

[Verse 2]
Girl this my last L
Imma roll it up with you
Cop some brand new shoes
Put me in a good mood
Imma bring a couple homies, you can call a couple friends
Is there a type of alcohol that you would recommend?
Being young so fun, I don't ever want to age
Haven't came down in the past 5 days
Just trying to tell it like it is
We the shit
You're now dealing with some motherfucking kids

[Outro: Mac Miller, Cab Driver & Jennie]
What?
Rostrum Records in this bitch
Thank y'all for tuning in
What up, E?
Let me do what I do
Most Dope, thumbs up, Pittsburgh
What up, Taylor Gang?
RD, ID Labs, Benji
Big Jerm, everybody man
Let's do it, yeah
My time right now
K.I.D.S., kicking some incredibly dope shit
Bitch!
Miss, would I be prying if I asked you what went wrong
Would I be prying
Everything’s wrong
No, not everything
The sun is still shining
It’s a beautiful day out
Some things are okay, right
