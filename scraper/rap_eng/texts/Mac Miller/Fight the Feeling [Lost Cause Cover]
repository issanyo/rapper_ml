[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, A-Rod
This onâ€”this on some personal shit right now
You feel me?

[Verse]
Welcome to the anthology of my mind
This is where everything that I've been tryna make sense
Rhymes, and it makes cents
Cents I could use to pay rent
Glad at 17 we've never paid rent
I've stayed blessed not the full amount
But paid enough dues just to make it out
People I love either dead or alive
Barely living their lives
Or otherwise they don't pay no mind to me
Well thats fine to me, I'm living prophecies
While Trav has been working
And Jharrel has been living the dream
Or starting off, I know you Spanish nigga but Mazeltof
Made it out the Bronx to a better a life
Got your Mama sleeping smooth and well at night
We got better nights
Dark times we going bat crazy
Yeah, it's hell at night
But it's best I write to get this off my chest
Saying I'm no liar, I'm on fire
So if you tryna get higher better fly with me
Been working all week tryna seal the cream
Take the team overseas
Just to see some places that they've never seen
And then right when the devil grabs me
I hope heaven speak

[Outro]
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
(It won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling, the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
