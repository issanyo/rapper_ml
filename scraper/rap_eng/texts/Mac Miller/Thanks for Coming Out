[Intro:]
Yo
You have now reached, the back of the High Life
Ah-ha!
Thanks for coming out
I've been your host, Mac Miller
It’s been great spending the evening with you
Let’s ride out, for one last time
East end empire
DJ Chef
Let’s get it

[Hook]
So lay back in your seat, with your feet up on your couch
Thanks for coming out
It’s been good, it’s been great, see you later
Times running out, and y’all know what I’m about
Thanks for coming out
It’s been good, it’s been great, see you later

[Verse One:]
So it’s the end of the tape
The last page
Hoes back stage
Party like my last day
Matter fact bitch I ain't even half way finished
Y’all fragile held up in your glass case
Your grind sleepy like that foreign dude running the Rat Race
Ass face, all your music nothing but bad taste
I murder beats you can ask Ma$e, homie
My shit I drop stickier than trash day
I ain't gotta change shit
I’m so dangerous
And my style like a smile
So contagious
Bitches giving me they hearts
So consistent never smart
Cause they always begging me not to break it
And ima make it
I’m something you don’t really see often
Gonna be the greatest and that just ain't just the weed talking
I tell these people give me a clue
Cause the boy be chasing honeys like Whinny the Pooh

[Hook]

Verse Two:
Rain drops falling on my brain
Staying on track like I’m following a train
And I’m grinding like your teeth when you angry
Go ahead cry yourself to sleep you a baby
Just a bum gotta hand you some change
Too smart
Y’all can call me Andy Dufresne
Still gotta inbox full of texts
And hoes tell me that I make a great first impression
Never stick around so they never learn they lesson
Hit it then I’m Nick Cage
Gone in sixty seconds
But you already know that pimping
Fish outta water need to go back swimming
They tripping
Every time I’m rolling they dipping
Cause my style “doh!”
Call me Homer Simpson
In the sky like Santa I’m fly
You a loser
Meg Griffin on Family Guy

[Hook]
