[Intro]

[Verse 1: J. Venom]
And I'm back in black like I'm coming from a funeral
I'm back with the venom, man I'm motherfucking killing you
A time-paradox like I'm coming from the future dude
These other rappers like "What the fuck should I do?"
I don't give a fuck, ya'll "poets" fucking suck
Ya'll already know what's up, man I'm just out of luck
Gotta get my money right, shaking through the night
Wondering about my fate and my life, I don't even know
Did I make the right choice to put out my flows
Did I make the right choice to start fucking with morph
Did I make the right choice to start shooting the low
I don't know, I don't fucking know
But they done now, no point in worrying
Cause all that shit do is add to the turbulence
To the rocky-ass flight of life
That's enough philosophy for one night

[Verse 2: Dextro]
I been out the game a while, but I return like Jesus Christ
Come back twice as nice, but I will always improve
Some people gonna hate but what the fuck can you do?
NAC connects and we've got our own system
I'm riding the bus to make sure I don't miss them
Still I'm wasting away, just trying to survive
And we act like we're the ones who're gonna keep Hip-Hop alive?
No faking though, because I really believe it
And if it ever becomes a trouble then I'll fucking leave it
Never deceive it, because ya'll cats get it twisted
The beats are pretty ill man, but it's soul you're missing
So listen, I hit em' up just like my dealer
Song about nothing, it ain't ever been realer
No song stealers, because we do our shit from scratch
We get on it like a rash, spit a couple of remixes
And we don't do it for cash

[Outro]
