{Intro: Mac Miller & Sir Michael Rocks}
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
BANCO!

[Hook: Mac Miller & Sir Michael Rocks]
All this madness
Shopping bags with some shit from Saks Fifth
Please don't think you won't fuck around and get your ass kicked
Cool shit, keep a smile
Bad chick, cheeks is out
I just hope this movie that we make gon' be a classic
You know life keep passing them lights keep flashing
You know life keep passing it might speed past ya
Cus life keep passing them lights keep flashing
These nights keep lasting I might not last

{Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks}
Maaaaaaan
I'm stupid faded with yo' lady watching paid in full
She say she wanna have my baby but I ain't a fool
Bitch you crazy, please don't call off your engagement
This is all for entertainment, don't be falling for the same script
I'm blowing my money cus Miami is sunny
And my girls been good they don't want nothing from me
They just loving my aura, so I take em down to Florida
You just can't afford it, that's why you never explored it
That click phone be doing the most
She jammed up, I shoot my side
I'm laying up, I'm scoring one
Cock her like some sort of gun
Passing out that ass to tap, plus I probably take me some
You mad at the money cus you probably just ain't make enough

[Hook: Mac MIller & Sir Michael Rocks]

{Verse 2: Mac Miller)
All I see is big lights, New York City nights, how I pictured life
Go down to Atlanta where them bitches sniff that chip of white
Drugs, drugs love or drugs, like to love but love to fuck
Living in the lies, nothing to her coming from her trust
Fun, late as fuck, and I been through 80 blunts
Got a bunch of blonde girls around me they the Brady Bunch
I'm throwing vinyl at your head bitch I'm breaking records
I had to get it now wasn't gonna wait forever
So if I'm talking bout good times that means I'm havin' some
Won't you stop hatin' get your ass up and go have you one
Concrete, pave the way
Go ahead and make my day
Glass of chardonnay, that's in your face bitch

[Hook: Mac Miller & Sir Michael Rocks]

{Bridge X4: Mac Miller & Sir Michael Rocks}
Young as hell
Rich as fuck
Set it down
Pick it up
We ain't going nowhere
Nope, you can't get rid of us

[Hook: Mac Miller & Sir Michael Rocks]
