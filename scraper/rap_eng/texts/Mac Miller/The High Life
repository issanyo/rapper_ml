[Verse]
I'm so high
Find me somewhere in the sky
And I know these days just flow by
When you're so high
Headed somewhere in the sky
And you know these days just flow by
When you're so high

[Outro]
Yeah, my name is Mac Miller
And you are now living
The high life
Most Dope
Big Jerm I see ya!
Get into it
