[Verse 1 - Mac Miller]
Ayo Jerm I need you to do me a favor real quick
Turn the beat up in my headphones a lil bit
This shit needs to knock a lil bit for me feel me
Ayo Cardo you keep hitting me with heat like this man
Imo have no choice but to kill it you feel me

Hey Hey I want a bunch of bad broads, a couple fast cars
So high up in the air that I can grab mars
Got a bunch of miles in me like a gas card
King of the jungle bitch I'm Madagascar
Don't aggravate him cause I don't have the patience
Send you home early like a bad vacation
Fuck with hoes that been struck with infatuation
But I be on the road and have em waiting
Escape from reality, life is just a fallacy
So we ride the clouds round skipping through the galaxy
On the Millennium Falcon you see me traveling
That's the type of shit to have you falling off the balance beam
Way to confusing got they hearts moving
Homie life is a game and you loosing
Better start improving, boy get your stats up
Cause my shit is gonna hit you like a mac truck bad luck

[Hook - Mac Miller]
In my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep My clothes real clean at the laundromat
Hit the hit the liquor store to get my medicine
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
In my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep My clothes real clean at the laundromat
At the laundromat,At the at the laundromat
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat

[Verse 2 - T-Shyne]
Louis duffle on my way to the laundromat
I'm the reason fathers wonder where they daughters at
Pussy on platter yea imo order that
Mac Miller on the song who would've thought of that
Haha doesn't matter 'cause it came through
Shy high cause I'm in my paper plane mood
Bottles of that Clicquot that's what my fame do
I get it in you just claim to
I won't blame you, you ain't a business man
Gettin' money 'til my death you niggas in a jam
Living spam, me I live a clean life
Money in my pocket love nature its a green life
Double dutch the same size as Harry Potter's wand
It last a NBA game 4 quarters long
And when its done we rolling up another one
I stay with bud like gold stays with a leprechaun

[Hook - Mac Miller]
In my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep My clothes real clean at the laundromat
Hit the hit the liquor store to get my medicine
I'm in a league of extraordinary gentlemen
In my Polo button up and a starter cap
Keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
At the laundromat, At the at the laundromat
I keep my clothes real clean at the laundromat
