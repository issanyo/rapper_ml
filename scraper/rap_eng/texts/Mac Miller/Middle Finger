[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah
And I feel like
Put your middle fingers up like

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
(Ugh)
Got my middle finger up
And it's pointed to the clouds
Rollin' in with my whole entourage
Too many of us to count
Tell baby girl I'm on that
Danger, bring your hard hat
Might not get that call back
So where those stories start at?

[Verse 1: Gabe Saporta]
I step into the club
The haters turn around
My middle fingers up
Man I'm just getting down
To get me in the mood
To get me good
I need an aphrodisiac, yeah
Aphrodisiac, yeah
And then she pulled me close and told me now
Let's rock the night away
Move your body to the beat like this
Like this, like this

[Hook: Gabe Saporta]
Throw your cups in the air
We so fly
Middle finger up to the sky
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y
In the sky-y-y
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y-y-y-y
Do it all the time (hey)
Do it all night (hey)
Middle finger up to the sky
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y
In the sky-y-y
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y-y-y-y

[Verse 2: Gabe Saporta]
Keep it movin' yeah
I gotta let you know
That you're the only girl
Who can drive me wild
Yeah, you feel good
Better than I thought
You got me so
Girl you got me outta my mind
Now if you want me like I know I want you
Let's rock the night away
Move your body to the beat like this
Like this, like this

[Hook: Gabe Saporta]
Throw your cups in the air
We so fly
Middle finger up to the sky
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y

In the sky-y-y-y-y-y
Do it all the time (hey)

(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y-y-y-y

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
We got our middle fingers up
Cause we don't give a fuck
Little bit of gin mixed in my cup
This is us so drink that up!
Girl I might need a ride home
You can take me back to your spot
Sure shot, Got your heart on lock call that Fort Knox
Or not, be a swing and miss
I bet you're trying to prove what the meaning of single is
But you got the moves
I'm drunk as hell
Trying to talk you
No other girl here that's hot as you
So i'll slow it down

[Hook: Gabe Saporta]
Throw your cups in the air
We so fly
Middle finger up to the sky
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y
In the sky-y-y
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y-y-y-y
Do it all the time (hey)
Do it all night (hey)
Middle finger up to the sky
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y
In the sky-y-y
(throw it up)
In the sky-y-y-y-y-y
