[Mac Miller- Verse 1]
You know all about me, I don’t know about you
You need somebody to lead, I be on my own two
You talking all that shit but what you really gon’ do
While I’m posted in the background chillin’ so cool
You know all about me, I don’t know about you
You need somebody to lead, I be on my own two
You talking all that shit but what you really gon’ do
While I’m posted in the background chillin’ so cool

[Mac Miller- Hook]
As time goes by, find yourself swaying side to side
Turn the music high in the ride and drive
See me, I’m cool, good music put you in that mood
She sings my tunes and thinks I’m fly

[Mac Miller- Verse 2]
Hey hey, they say I’m magnificent
And I rap different than dudes who say they living this spitting out bad sentences
Getting high, see the sky where my limit is
I’m the shit bitch, come and get a whiff of this
Around my neck and some beads on my wrist
Got a girl back at the crib, just to clean off my dick when I piss
But not really, that was just a joke, who you think I am? Diddy?
She looking in the mirror double checking if she pretty
But I just see that ass and them titties
And she got class, that kinda silly
She be letting dudes hit it like their name was Ken Griffey
I don’t mean to joke around cause music is my job
But whats a fucking job when you don’t get no days off
Hmm, well that would be my music shit
My team I make maneuvers with
Be traveling all around the world still here getting used to it
This Karate school bitch, you’ll get super kicked
While I chill relax and take these Buddah hits
Fucker then I move that bitch, it’s so Ludacris
Making money now, they blame it on my Jewish-ness
Stupid bitch

[Verse 2 - Locksmith- Verse 3]
I’m using music to get inside of your pubic strip
Damn bitch, than you stupid thick
I’m too equipped with my lyrics and metaphors
Measure cords like I’m on my ’92 Grand Puba shit
? to tell a bitch slow down
Most frown when I choose to spit, fucker no lube and shit
You can use your spit
Either that or choose to get all up on this metaphor-skin
No Jewish dick
You was quick to write him off, now you love it
You was hating when in public, all alone you like “dudes the shit”
You was schemin’ I was chillin’ by the pool with chicks no dick
Hit the pussy smell like a school of fish
A clam chowder with Mac powder I back at her
If the smell nice than I blow the fucking back out her
I give that bitch the news like Matt Lauer
That’s like now til my last hour

[Mac Miller- Hook]
As time goes by, find yourself swaying side to side

See me, I’m cool, good music put you in that mood
