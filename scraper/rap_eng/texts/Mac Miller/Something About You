This one goes out to ya girl
Sorry that she with you

Something bout the way you move
Got me talkin just to flirt
Something bout the things you do
Got me callin off work
Its just something about you

Its just something about you
Something bout the way you look
Got me with you everyday
Something bout the way you cook
Got you sleepin at my place
Just something about you

Something bout your style got
Me pickin up the down
Something bout the way you smile
Got me actin like a child

You ain't gonna find another boy
To treat ya, like I treat cha
Take you out to dinner just to feed ya
Kick it in my leiger
I'm the only to guarantee ya satisfied
Im passin by, just to see them happy eyes
And you laugh and cry
Just a little drama queen, starter on my roster
And its great to have you on the team
I been noticing women making me notice them
And I been focusing to never leave
You alone again. if you lonely
You can phone a friend. ima grab you from
Your home and spend a night sleepin over there
Look, daze somethin bout them eyes
Something bout the way she watch it
Got her on my mind
I could have every girl in the crowd room
(its true) but theres just something bout you

(Hook)
Something bout the way you move
Got me talkin just to flirt

Something bout the way you look
Got me with you everyday
Something bout the way you cook
Got you sleepin at my place
Just something about you

Something bout you
Its something about you
Something bout the way you cooler
Than a motherfuckin ice rack
Got me mad when I leave
But ill be right back
She dont like that, askin me for more
Dont matter bout her life
She been askin me for it
She say that I ignore her, and all
I care about is work. I say its what I do
And try not to be a jerk. she give a smirk
Knowin how it be, go to kiss up on her lips
But she turn and get a cheek
Cause she all about that slow seduction
No rush, total crushin, we been up laughin
Haven't got to sleep in weeks
I konw what you sayin you dont need to speak
But call me mister, make you sweat
In the morning turn myself
In mr. make a check. lets go!
Gettin away with the lick of her tounge
Better together, than givin it up
Member you can never miss me enough
Whenever im back im hittin you up
Im consistant, not to distant
Know you got a life, so ima let you live it
Oh, just respect my grind, you extra fine
Always got some sex in mind
Lets go more, its sexy time
Ahaa making you laugh with every line
Yeah, my eye been on you lately
Im just tryin get in on crazy

(Hook)

The high life, thats my life
But it could be yours
But it could be yours
