I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Cause, I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch Please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]

A lotta' times I don't get the credit
Forgettin' about my ethical work
Let it be first said that I'm here to earn bread
I been dedicatin' ever since I turned 10
Got the type of style quickly gonna turn heads
I been workin', part time hustla'
Hit you with a dub, feedin' bubblas, (got this bruh)
On the road with a dollar and a dream
Cause anything is possible, believe bitch please
It ain't nothin' to spit, sparkin' up in the whip
Stayin' stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement
No one ever sees a legend when he stuck on the bench
And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench
My head, can't contain all these dreams of mine
When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna' leave behind
For now, it's food for thought it'll feed your mind
But you can't get a piece of mind
Nah homie

[Hook]
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Cause, I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch Please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]

Now, I can either try and be a hero
Or I can grab a one with six zeros
What would I do with a million dollars?
First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father
Then pay for college, get TreeJay a camera
Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta
Cop a Phantom, just to ride in
Some celebrity friends to get high with
Couple four models that I find dine with
Cause the music that I make is timeless
The pressures on, don't choke, Heimlich
Maneuver, got my songs all through your computer
You wonderin' "is it buzz or just a rumor "
I'm Superman, y'all just Lex Luther
I'mma make a mil, that's for real no deal
Just the illest mothafucka in the bill, so chill

[Hook X2]
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Bitch please, I'ma make a million
Cause, I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch Please, I'ma make a million
With ease, I'ma make a million
