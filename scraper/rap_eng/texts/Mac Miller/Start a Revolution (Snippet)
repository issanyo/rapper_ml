[Verse]
It'll take a lil bit of practice
Get lost in the madness, world keeps spinning on an axis
Risen from the ashes
Over through the king, now I'm feeling high, [?] on a palace
Wishing on a miracle, living on a prayer
Open up the third eye, see what's really there
Wait, can taste the freedom in the air
Give thanks, based beings, we the rarest
Yeah, you staring at an illusion
I don't need shit, I'm my own Rick Rubin
Burning down the shitty, have a contest in the ruins
I'm goonin'
Super loose, start the hula hoop with Paul Newman
Say "fuck it" and keep it moving, can't stop the revolution
