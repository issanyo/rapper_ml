[Verse 1: NJOMZA]

I hear that shit
You wanna get started
You thinking you styling
You hoes is all garbage
Saying i changed from the second i started
I just upgraded
Why you still hatin'

See that I'm on now
I'm out here faded
Up to no good shut up bitch don't look
I might just turn you to pavement

[Hook]
SHUT UP, BITCH

[Verse 2: NJOMZA]
Y'all some stank pussy hoes
Ain't nobody fuckin' with ya
When i pull up to the club
Bet you wanna take a picture
I got money in my pussy
Tell your man to come and earn it
I dont fuck rappers
They can try but it ain't workin'

You hear that shit
When I'm ridin' through the city
Middle finger out the window
Just because I'm feeling bitchy
I don't got the time
Too much money on my mind
Seeing dollar signs
Five foot three but i beat a bitch ass
You don't know about me you better ask somebody
Word around town i could break a bitch down
When she open up her mouth
I'm like shut the fuck up

[Hook]
SHUT UP, BITCH

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]

God Damn so many hoes on me
I hate them all but i fuck 'em when I'm lonely
She a groupie, treat her like a groupie
Playin' R. Kelly feelin' on that bitch booty
With some dyke bitches i hope they scissor
I'm an asshole i fucked my homies sister
We was watchin' movies
I hit it raw as sushi
And then i
Sh..sh..shut up

[Hook]
SHUT UP, BITCH
