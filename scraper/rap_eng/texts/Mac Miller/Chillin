[Hook: x2]
I'm just ridin on some chillin shit
With a bad little joint, feelin good and shit
And we've been drinkin so we kinda hit
But I'm a smoke just a little bit

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Tink top on with my big chain
Riding through my city numb bit a chief thang
Money in my pockets shit I'm getting checks
Just got a text, ran my pussy wet
20 minutes later, hood bad and select
She a bad little bitch but I don't eat up, never
Go and get a bottle from the [?]
Slow sippin if I'm trippin I'm a hit it raw
Grand papers filled with the weed, smoke that
Now I got the feeling that I need
I'm feeling her and she feellin me, come on
But feeling love's for the suckers be
We could fuck if we both agree
And if I spill enough, she gonn eat the peas, you do that
I double up, for the mornin after
And I'm a real nigga, double on tantrum

[Hook: x2]
I'm just ridin on some chillin shit
With a bad little joint, feelin good and shit
And we've been drinkin so we kinda hit
But I'm a smoke just a little bit

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Still riding in the backseat, listenin to mac be
Thousand dollar belt, buckle holdin up my cachis
It ain't nothing, I ain't ballin, I'm just playing round
Kinda wish my bitch stayed around
Still runnin slow when I smoke a mind drough
Still keep it low from the fuckin 5o
Still ain't got a penny for any of these hoes
Still getting shows, still getting throwed
Still let a bitch suck my dick while I'm on the mike
Still call that hoe a fiend cause she on the pipe
And then mom still tell me I ain't talkin right
Still bring my homies with me when I'm on a flight
I ain't chillin on the ave, shout to rally or smash
Still chillin with some bitches, watchin belly smokin hash
For the oprah cash, we're fuckin by the badge
Till the spazz going fast, 120 on the dash
Throw some rap, that ain't shit, man that's easy to me
It's funny cause it's money like Jesus to me
How would be, my bitch japanese
Shout to french montana still I'm mac with cheese

[Verse 3: Troy Ave]
Nigga, in the hood and I'm kinda heavy
I just bought a 2 pack now the [?]
Ideal, it's slick talk fucked up birds
First of the month gone by the 3rd yes sir
If you don't hustle, then you won't relate
Bricks in my backpack, niggas on it late
Powder, it's all good, niggas only cake
On my way about the hood, niggas show me hate
I need that, believe that
Fuel to my fire, fire up the weed at
Alright, alright, pack loud than a motherfucker
I'm ballin hard baby act [?]
In the bare jays, and a pair of shades
Got the club going crazy and I'm center stage
Puttin on for my city, got a bunch of fly niggas
And my real niggas with me
