[Intro: DJ Drama]
Just the other day it was a just dream to make it
Just the other day, that same dream, they tried to take it
Just the other day all you wanna do is see 'em be great
Just the other day, they look you in your face, eyes full of hate
Bobby Kritical

[Chorus]
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (Woah, woah) nigga you too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros
(Woah, woah) Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
Just the other day I was, yeah

[Verse 1]
Just other day I was broke as a bitch
Walking to work in the hot sun, so-soaking it in
I never been a dope man, but I'm the dopest of man
Buying some smoke from the dude with the dope
Throw five, four point five, so on, so forth
I'm tryna get my fucking goals, not Goyard
Paying for the lawyers, get my bros out the courtyard
Cause I got the ear for the flows, not Mozart, but damn a nigga go hard
Put me on a postcard or miss me 'til the show start
My niggas got a Benz and he push it like a go-cart
Tryna get one of them, but my ends like "don't start
The bullshit again fore' you end up a broke boi again"
So don't pretend
Oh we remember, last September, like the coldest winter
Man I really had to show these niggas
I owe these niggas a throat slit, know me nigga

[Chorus]
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (Woah, woah) nigga you too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros
(Woah, woah) Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
Just the other day I was, yeah

[Verse 2]
Today, today, I woke up like this
My girl on my left, no watch on my wrist
Some rings on my fist, what we did last night?
Was it a hurricane in here last night?
It would appear that something sexual or severe
Happened being that I see liquor and beer
Weed, people still in the living room sleep, come and see, huh
She say "I'm dizzy," don't wanna move, just wanna lay under me
Honestly, I know that just other day you was goddamn broke
Watch outside, that nigga shot them folks
Glock in ya ride, you gotta watch them folks
And the cops be wilding, we ain't even provoke 'em
I remember being broker than I is right now
Tryna find a place to live, shit I'm is right now
In doubt of my next move, get a pill, bite down, find focus
I grab pen, it was poetry in motion
Not the same for many folks, different strokes
Colloquialism, idiot vision, y'all seen I was doing the most
Definite dope, it's on the scene, not in need of a vote
Repping the city, what's ya team, nigga? Fuck 'em
East Atlanta king and I mean every letter
But when I'm good, I'm good, when I'm bad, I'm better
The man of the method, it's a method to the madness
I'm stepping in my bag with the cannon, step back
Repping the city, showing love that I don't ever get back
But that's the plight of a player, plot an attack and rocking and rapping
Rippin' rappers off of the fuckin' map, suckers suffering, succotash
I need that Mark Zucker bag, Zuckerberg
Hovercraft flows, I don't fuck with that, bullshit below
From the ceiling to the floor, full schizo for the dough
New pistol, but I know I'm planting seeds so they can grow
But if they don't, then I don't know
But all I know a nigga

[Chorus]
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
You got a five, I got a five, let's smoke
Just the other day I was running from them folks
Like (Woah, woah) nigga you too slow
Just the other day I was telling all my bros
(Woah, woah) Nigga it's time to go
Just the other day I was goddamn broke
Just the other day I was, yeah
