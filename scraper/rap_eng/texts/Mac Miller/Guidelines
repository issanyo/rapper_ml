[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, mhm

[Verse 1]
Alright, lungs full of weed smoke
Trunk full of C-notes
Always keep a plan and a bitch with a deep throat
Came from the keystone, drink 'til my speech slow
I breath fire, kill time, collect zeros
Coming with that heat stroke, every verse's key low
Whole team flying and my name Rick Pitino
We know, but still we fight ego
Feeling like Michael but you really like Tito
And all I got is dead heroes, wanna take my girl and move away to Puerto Rico
'Cause it's a freak show everywhere that we go
Shit been different ever since I did a song with CeeLo
I make that music you can digest
Take you out your mind and let me become the pilot
Fly Jets and sign checks, we don't fuck around, no joker inside of my deck
My head inside of clouds, show me to the sky and I'll kiss it
If you blink an eye you gon' miss it
And this will happen once in a blue moon, it's always over way too soon
I spend a hundred twenty on it just to go vroom, vroom
Homie, the wheels looking like soup spoons
I ain't worried, I got nothing left to lose
You gon' be alright if you just follow a few rules

[Chorus]
It's right now fuck forever, we right here
Rain clouds come before the sky get clear
And just when you thought it was alright here come another long night
We can do better, have no fear
Death creeping slow don't you shed those tears
And just when you thought it was alright
It might be alright, yeah

[Verse 2]
Okay, I spend nights looking like a deer in the headlights
Sweat like I'm running up ten flights of steps with the left right, from now to the next life
Only coming out of the house when the check right
The test score a hundred percent and I don't need to study buddy I'm comin correct
I go and get a ton of money a ton of respect
They talking a ton of shit but say it under they breath, the flow fuckin possessed
On par with Charlotte, got 'em stuck in the web
Darn it, the flow so marvellous, I look so harmless
The sun don't shine though, my mind never low on darkness
Pardon the interruption, excuse me
You were just saying something how rude of me
One man but I move like a few of me, I'm not human I was built more beautifully
Mhm, and every single dream lucid, I could probably fly if these wings keep moving
All we do is speak truth and put a beat to it
I need music to tune out the bullshit
Yeah, turn off the lights and I glow, now that I have it I'ma never let it go
And this for everybody, friend or foe, yeah, friend or foe
Well, well, well
I fantasized 'bout this back in my early teens, I'm talking holes in my dirty jeans
There's no soup for me, I let the chickens out the coup to feed
See, I'm becoming something way beyond a human being
Who wanna hollar for a dollar with a handout?
A little oochie wally got you feeling like the man now
I see god every time I pull her pants down
It's the holy water 'til I'm at my only dollar

[Chorus]
It's right now fuck forever, we right here
Rain clouds come before the sky get clear
And just when you thought it was alright here come another long night
We can do better, have no fear
Death creeping slow don't you shed those tears
And just when you thought it was alright
It might be alright, yeah
