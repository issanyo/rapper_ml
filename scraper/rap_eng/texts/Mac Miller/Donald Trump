Ay yo, the fliest muthafucka' in the room
Yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hating on me, cause they know I started locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at the house on the couch, watching cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget
When you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothing when you stop and just say fuck it

Walking out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
Ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Big butt bitch, but you never touch this
The way it goes when you party just like I do
Label on my ditty, used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit

Take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all the bitches sad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gon win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in, got these boys that used to play me from afar
We gonna take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches sad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into to the van then we take 'em to the pad
It's a wrap
