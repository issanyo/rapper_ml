[Intro: Thundercat + Mac Miller]
Change anything
Love, death
As it should
Birth
As it should
Life
As it should
Death (death)
One more time, are you ready?

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Perfection
Seduction, deception
Enough with the questions
Ooh, we running outta time, time, time

[Bridge: Thundercat]
Heavy load
Watch it all unfold

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
You promised that you'd never die
Oh, how naive of me
I wish someone could tell me why
Why it's so hard to lie from your knees
I'm down to the bottom of the bottle
Say hello forever and goodbye tomorrow
Oh

[Outro: Thundercat + Mac Miller]
Children of forever
Children of forever
Children of forever
That sound is so awesome

[Instrumental]
