[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, as hard as it gets: cool, calm and collected
Holdin' my breath, this ain't what I expected
Don't argue to death, pull my heart out of my chest
The cards is all on the table, I'm callin' it
Don't say it, I swallow it
When livin' off of borrowed time
Often I'm on the fence, on a line
Addin' up what's on my mind
My feet on the clouds, head on the ground
That we goin' down, bet you know me now

[Bridge 1]
I'm treading water, I swear
That if I drown I don't care
They callin' for me from the shore, I need more

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is It?)
Who really has the time at all?
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is It?)
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it feel like the weekend on the Tuesday
I can move dates
"I got something else to do" day
Always do hate, If I do say
The D'USSÃ‰ with the homies like it's Kool-Aid
Me? I'm just tryna play it cool, J (anyways)
Yeah, mind over matter I'm
Purer than alkaline
Been stuck on album time
I gotta get out to shine
Fly on the wall, shit, I was buggin'
Miss me like you gettin' withdrawal, I keep that coming, yeah

[Bridge 2]
I'm treading water I know
If I stop movin', I'll float
They nothing new it-
Just play it cool baby, just play it cool
You know, cool

[Chorus]
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'

[Outro]
Yeah
Tell me you love me, spin me around
Pretty please pick me up in the air and don't put me down
Seen it all unfold, sat back and watched
Knowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop
Bare feet, runnin' late, her car started
Even though the only thing that she drivin' a hard bargain
More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but
She put me back together when I'm out of order
Perfect
