[Verse 1]
This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

[Verse 2]
Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Don't know where I am
Don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

[Chorus]
So I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wonder if I could come home

[Verse 3]
I remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

[Verse 4]
And you said, "This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
Now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy"

[Chorus]
So if you want to be with me
With these things there's no telling
We'll just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
