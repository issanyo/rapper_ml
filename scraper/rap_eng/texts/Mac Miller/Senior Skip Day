[Verse 1]
I'm just high, why they hatin' on me?
People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have no money to spend
To buy Patron for you and all your friends
Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
'Cause we tryin' to get high, get high, get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give them what they need
Just wakin' up and gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle
Damn, well, it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs
Ayy, gotta work with watcha got
Ayy, gotta work with watcha got

[Chorus]
Supposed to be in class but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can ya stay a while?
Can ya stay a while?
'Cause girl I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ain't tryna get out of my bed till noon
Neighbors smell the perfume smoke in my room
And I got the door closed can't be sure though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euro's
Get the herb rolled,let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escaped the world, escaped the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
Cause we gonna handle that later, we gonna handle that later
Right now lets get this paper and smile for all them haters
Aye cream cheese and a bagel, have a glass of milk and an eggo
I'm rockin' PJ's and no shirt, I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Haha, enjoy the best things in your life
Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice
They say you waste time asleep, But I'm just tryin' to dream

[Chorus]
Supposed to be in class but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can ya stay a while?
Can ya stay a while?
'Cause girl I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around
