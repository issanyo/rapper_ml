[Intro: Mac Miller and B.DuBB]
Ye, Listen to the Ill Spoken
Yo, yo let me get this real quick
Alright mac, so come around
Ye, let's go

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I focus, on bein' the dopest, to hold a mic
I'm cleverly ending enemies lives with words that I recite
There'll never be anyone better than me
Contenders tendin' to be settin' the scene
The rookie but still the best on the team
See these cats like sex in a dream
Yall spit the good but ain't nothin' is real
I'mma cut off all your fingers spit you something to feel
Cuz you ain't, touchin' the real
I'm spittin' ideal, it's surreal
Yeah, welcome to the City of Steel
Where you can find me kickin' back
Pirate hat, twisted back
Pen and pad, on my lap
I'm sippin' on a Pabst
I'm a menace to society, Dennis would admire me
Burnin' through more rubbers than a tire be
See i speak figuratives
Spittin' with metaphors and irony
Variety of ivory to ease my anxiety
The young masta pass the rules, they don't apply to me
The game got me messed up and taken what's inside of me

[Verse 2: B.DuBB]
And I'm a, take it from there
Never playin' it fair
Got the throne up in my way until i'm makin' it there
And as far as I'm concerned
Shit is vacant, so I'm breakin the chair
On the ground is how I'm makin it, chyeah
Thinkin' about how much cake that I can make in a year
Few grams I'm movin' grams, not a day I can spare
Hear the jam as i play in my ear
Psssh it's hot like fevers
Hustle hard, sellin' pot to feeders
Dippin all across the block
Cops holla if you seen us
Me and EZ Mac come back like we was jesus
We stayed skeed and my trees is the greenest
I keep a buck sixty in my jeans
I'm a genius
So, heed this when we puttin' it down
We speak ill, reekin' hell
Leave you shook from the sound
I stand tall with my foot in the ground
So if you doubt me, come and see what im about
Come in to my town

[Hook: B.DuBB]
So come around, come around
Come around, come around
Into the underground
Come around, come around
We so sick, we got that hunger sound
Come around, come around
Come around
So bet it's going down
Come around
Cuz we breakin' all sets and we takin' the crown

[Verse 3: B.DuBB]
I spit with authenticity
You can't get within the width of me
Surround me by the definition victory
You think you lava, then my line-up that some shit to see
Speedy flow its sick i need to get some antihistamines
The mista mean, the mista please
I know you pissed at me
I'm beatin' up you beaters
And dismissin' you a mystery
Leavin' haters history
I'm hurtin' you cowards
Heard him out, word him out
Cuz I'm a person of power
The TV said I couldn't curse
I spit a verse and devour
We Ill Spoken
Spill minds, rhymes, it's still potent
Battle us at real times
Try, you'll feel broken
They quotin', but we fire, my rhymes is still smokin'
Fo real folks, you better reckon the flow
Cuz yo I'm comin' through your section and I'm checkin' the pros
You better know
The mecca we the best in the show
The record explodes the second I'm lettin' it go

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Check it, respect the method
Man I wreck it
I said it
With an eccentric sentence
The apprentice, will not stop spittin' till I'm breathless
You ain't feelin' me
Feel free to use the exits
To other mc's that know me to preach
Gonna spend my history to eat every lyric you willingly speak
You still gettin' beat each and every battle you havin' with me
The champion, you bringin' to feat
The fat lady singing the C
Ain't nothin' change, I'm a do what the game never does
With clever stuff i'm the rapper that there never was and never will be
The kid with that ill speech
Not quittin' unless you kill me
Nah, ill probably still be
Spittin' from the grave, my flow mindless
And no need of a brain
Simple and plain
The kid will remain the best in the game
Hittin' your chest with flames
Remember the name
Or we came, i'm at your second game

[Hook: B.DuBB]
So come around, come around
Come around, come around
Into the underground
Come around, come around
We so sick, we got that hunger sound
Come around, come around
Come around
So bet it's going down
Come around
Cuz we breakin' all sets and we takin' the crown
