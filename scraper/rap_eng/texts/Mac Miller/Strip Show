Verse 1:
Only thing that's been on my mind, where it's allright okay, can't
Wait to get home to my ladies zone, where it's all right okay
I've been rolling up all day, I've been pouring up all day
Gave it all during tonight so that after the party I'm feeling like after the party
Only've got a couple hours in tonight left, gonna spend it at home with my lady
She's gonna make me feel so righteous. I've pulled up to the crib, see your silhouettes in the door frame
I can see your eyes wat's your plan, you're gonna hold it down for your man

Chorus:

Flying you around give you the fliest in the town
Know it's time to reward your man who always held you down
So tonight, I feel like I deserve a strip show, yeah yeah
A private strip show
Always kept you clean, always cop you everything you need
Now it's time to pay your nigga back, and you know what I mean
So tonight, I feel like I deserve a strip show, yeah yeah
A private strip show

Verse 2:

A lot of time spent in diamonds glisten over your body
Probably could've waited, but I made it
Perfecting this hobby, opened accounts to stash wealth and share it with you
Even through the ups and downs, I hid my carrets is for two, you
Know we got history, I did more than a little bit
Fulfill your sexually needs, even put with rentals
And them furs, even those earrings that you love from channel
And that perfume the way you smell, put a nigga under a spell
Got me hooking nonetheless good, ready for some positive karma
Let me see that laced lingerie sliding down your hips and pasture
Drop that G-string south, show me what it's about
Do it for your nigga, and make me feel like someone with clout

Chorus

Let me, just lay down watch them panties hit the ground
Cause my dick be gettin' harder every time you make a sound
Do a dance for me baby make me want it bad like you know I do
Only you got that ass round, it's like my own balloon
Pussy like it a cobra tooth that's filled with venom
Own that pussy, kill that pussy, needs resurrection
Don't you want it bad, workin for this dick so let it be your boss
Yeah my penis floss, let me cop some head, free of costs
Work all day and night, so when I see you please be naked
Do those things I like but try to mix it up and be creative
Yeah you know you please me and you help me to ease my mind
From this grind, if you got a second, I'mma take my time so

Chorus
