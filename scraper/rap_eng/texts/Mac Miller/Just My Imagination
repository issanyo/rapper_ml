[Verse 1]
Wake up in my king size bed
Girls all around me, eyes all red
The true life of a player kid
It's nice to wake up to a naked bitch
Got the finest clothes, diamonds, hoes
Goin' to sleep on a pile of dough
Lacoste, phantoms, yards, mansions
Piff in the cannons, house in the Hamptons
Big parties every night
This is the life of the paradise
My main man twista told'em right
I make'em celebrities over night
Grammys, Oscars, starrin' in movies
Gotta pool house, 4 cars, and jacuzzi's
On my way up, gettin' my cake up
Wake up

[Hook]
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away

[Verse 2]
I got groupies, who got groupies
And I buy a new car every two weeks
My chain got diamonds in it
And my whip got a diamond finish
Got the MTV jam of the week
Sign autographs when I stand in the street
Plus I been all over B.E.T, Columbia records, and D.T.P
Both want me to sign to their label
Plus I got my own channel on cable
Always fresh court-side, best view
Kanye West and beats from The Neptunes
Stackin' cream, magazines
Kids dressed like me on Halloween
They lovin' my mixtapes, money like Bill Gates
I'm on top and it feels great

[Hook]
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away
