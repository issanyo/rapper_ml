Uh yeah, little old school shit

[Hook]
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right

[Verse 1]
I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
She got a boyfriend but left him home
See I got style so yes I brag
The things i do just make them mad
Download new kicks to my iPad
Why ya girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag
You a fag, this is forever, ladies in love with my agenda
My names something these girls remember
She write hers down, return to sender
I don't need it, thinking she can keep her secrets
One night only that's how I treat this, sleepin'
Bitch please make me some breakfast
And then leave

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Ya see I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
Girls audition to bring them home
See I might chose, so just go with it
Her mom adores me, dad thinks i'm a nitwit
It don't really matter I'ma have her fall in love
I need my beauty, brains, booty, and she all of the above
Relationships, I hate that shit
Got one night only so make it quick
You see me out, wanna take a pic
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit
I ain't that rich, but I got friends
Make a sandwich, get me fed
Decide right now, don't got all night
This the life so play ya cards right

[Hook x2]
