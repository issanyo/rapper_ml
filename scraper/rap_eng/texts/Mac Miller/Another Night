Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm
I'm just a regular kid, at my crib
Doin' regular shit, burnin' 5 spliffs
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'm a pour another cup and roll another zone
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me, hit me on Twitter
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name
Waitin' at the station till it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin bout
Pour a little liquor then I drink it down

[Hook]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank god for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gate
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and
Burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do it's nothin' new

[Hook]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone
