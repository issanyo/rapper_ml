I keep on smoking, up my weed
Till I'm out of bud
Now I got nothing, but this high
And the roach of a blunt
You seen me blow, I'm rolling up
I'm trying to smoke
I'ma be high cause I don't give a fuck
Take one hit for the round, just one time for your mind
This , got me feeling the *divine*, I'm way up in the sky

I keep on smoking, up my weed
Till I'm out of bud

Now I got nothing, but this high
And the roach of a blunt

I'm up in the clouds, I'm not coming down
Thousands of miles in air
And I ain't ever close to the ground
We smoking the pounds, pounds, pounds
Breaking it down, down, down
Just me and homies, homies
Till the hoes come around

I keep on smoking, up my weed
Till I'm out of bud
Now I got nothing, but this high
And the roach of a blunt

Smoking smoking , smoking my weed
