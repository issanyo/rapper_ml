My fucking belly looks like pudding
I just need to find some luck, it
Seems I need to get a fuck in
But I don’t really know something I don’t totally suck in

But then came rap
And the real W was back
On track with the homies and the girls in the back
Seat, my 9-5 is fucking up beats and im proud of it
Not 9am but pm im too loud for it
The weed is too loud too
Gotta say yo girl looks like she want some W
But I ain't giving out shit
Cause in the past that came out shit
I was shitfaced with the way people come and hate
But then came the wait for a better life
A better sight, girls with better thighs
Better hips better lips
And a better face
Better b’jays, she gets off at 8
So I pick her up in my ford
Pass some billboards
I will one day be on
She will see oh
She spilled some drank on the keyboard
But she’ll get ignored
Because im in trance with the music
We ain't never losing
Hope
Or dope for that matter
I threw the bag at her
And she rolled till we passed out
Then I smoked till the lighter’s gassed out
But sometimes im bored of all the smoking
Thinking bout the things I could be if I’d be working
No joking that shit Is poking
I left her choking, and soaking
In the bath thub
We did drugz nothing is provoking
That’s right and we might roll another one, nothing’s granted
Except the good vibes, and the disappointment when we landing
Cause we love to be above the clouds, never proud of what we chanting
The music got us so high it must be enchanted
It must be enchanted


Ayo and I want to be the numbero uno
Im wit the homies and we see nothing cuz the fumo
