[Intro: Mac Miller]
Ha ha!
Mhm
Don't mind if I do

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, it seems like every day I got a filled up phone
Ladies tryna text me, saying that they home for the summer
And they heard that I'm living on my own
So they wanna come to the crib, maybe cook me some supper
But I'm busy, so I'm ignoring her
Yeah I just touched down in California
Now I'm headed to the beach gon' swim in the water
Like I'm tryna sneak in across the border
I do all different types of crazy shit
I'm the younging hoes tryna make a baby with
Cause it'll make 'em rich
Know I'm headed to the money, so these funny little girls wanna take a trip
But no, only the M.O.S.T. Dope with me
Other fools homo, Roy and Siegfried
No disrespect though
I got addictive cigarette flow for the green pesto, presto

[Chorus (Sampled): Adam Young]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Me, I'm highly underestimated
So educated in getting paid quick
If you ever hated, anticipate that I'm famous
Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with
Celebrate that we seeing another day, life good
Never wanna end this
Me and Mary Jane got a really nice friendship
Yeah they give me money but I gotta go and spend it
Man, I been a bad little jew
But I gotta pay the bills now so I gotta chill out
I ain't walking 'round like I'm splurging with a mill now
Feel like the kid working at the mill now
Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bill's house
Now I gotta schedule, things I gotta do
Doing interviews, see it up on YouTube
I say it feels just like a dream
'bout to wake up from a nap
How fucked up was that?
Like

[Chorus (Sampled): Adam Young]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems

[Outro: Mac Miller]
This shit just feels good I'm not gonna lie
Just some motherfucking kids
We just some motherfucking kids
