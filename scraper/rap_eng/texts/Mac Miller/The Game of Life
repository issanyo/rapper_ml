Yo, TreeJ just ate a Triple Baconator in 2 minutes
Jesus

[Hook]:
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I’m going for another one
Put me in the friend zone, loving how we get along
But she wouldn’t let me fuck her once
You got to take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain’t nothing big, it’s just the game of life
So motherfucker how you playing?

[Verse 1]:
In this game of life, I’m just beginning
Only the first inning, but how much they paying to get admission
Oh nothing?
They just listening?
It’s all good, cause I’m just trying to make a living
This planet that we living on
Streets people spitting on
Got this cold world in my hand, I put some mittens on
They playing dirty so my bib is on
Why they hating on the stars that they wish upon?
Twinkle, twinkle, a wrinkle in time
I got these motherfuckers hating cause they wish they could shine
But they can't and I can
So they stand while I dance, with their bitch
With my hands on her hips and she ask me
“Can you take me to the crib?” (Ha)
Well bitch that wouldn’t be too classy
I’m sick of all the same advice
Motherfucker this the game of life
So how you playing?

[Hook]:
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I’m going for another one
Put me in the friend zone, loving how we get along
But she wouldn’t let me fuck her once
You got to take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain’t nothing big, it’s just the game of life
So motherfucker how you playing?

[Verse 2]:
It ain’t smart, I’m playing risky in this game of life
Roll the dice, just trying to get my paper right
When the heat’s on, most of yall made of ice
So you pay the price, but I’m here to save your life
You the type to never ever take advice
The world is a girl who ain’t playing right
Everybody love life cause it sound nice
But you can’t turn a ho into a housewife
Everybody tried but they failed
Oh well, light another L (ha)
I guess the show goes on
You had her naked, now her clothes is on
What’s wrong?

[Hook]:
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
