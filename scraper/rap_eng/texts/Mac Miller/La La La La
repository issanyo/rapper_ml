[Verse]
I'm going in after hitting this ganja
Out to dinner with the homies, private table at Nakama
I'm a new millennium Sinatra
Copping marijuana from the neighborhood Rastas
Chiefing, feasting, king of the new school
I'm speaking in tongues, try translating voodoo
Hold up, let me start again
Undefeated shirt, Levis and a Mr. Rogers cardigan
It's a hell of a feeling, being this fresh
Spit seem to sit upon my lips, call it Blistex
Peddling this medical, the presence of a general
Magazine centerfolds, they all up on my genitals
Got the game in the palm of my hands
Attention, wilding out better talk to your man
He bitching cause I ain't got a lot time for these weirdos
Talking shit all up in my earlobes
I just live life, trying to do it right
Everyone that hear me say "The boy is super nice"
Put a bitch up on a flight, she gon' be here by tonight
Get some afternoon delight, only eat it if it's ripe
Call me Stanley Steemer, I'll be giving her the pipe
And when I'm out of town she wanna see me so we Skype
She might get obsessed and keep calling
30,000 feet, Tom Petty, free falling
Just laying back, letting gravity take it's course
I wanna tell all of my haters that we made it boy
From basement studios to some official shit
From stressed out all the time to I don't give a shit
Used to dream about it, boy now I'm living it
412 is the Most Dope syndicate
Had a normal life but now I'm sick of it
Try and spend money just to spend and it's ridiculous
Young and so mischievous
