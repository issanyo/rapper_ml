[Hook: Boaz]

Round and round the world we go
Fly first class, living five stars
Lifes got its ups and downs I know
But I must say by far
I've been living the good life doing my own thing
Just a natural born hustler
All around the globe

[Verse 1: Boaz]
Yeah hoppin off the plane
Shopping when I land
Ain't got these in the states
I copped em in Japan
Tokyo driftin in the bubble face Lexus
I wake up this morning
Had trees for breakfast
Cause all I need is food for thought
Everybody in the kitchen tell them to use the pots
Is getting hot hot lookin like money in the making
These niggas out here got the hustlas mistaken
What you take me for a rapper cause I am nice with my wordplay
But I still lost money on the worst way
Every month we be waiting on the first day
Hope it don't fall on a Tuesday or Thursday
All around the world I found myself travelin
Wishin I was drinkin with my niggas at the tavern
No love lost but we are not grind
Late in the city you can see who the stars shining

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]

I can never make a dollar too many
Sipping on this henney till the bottle go empty
Shorty wantin it all
Prada, Louis and Fendi
I'm just workin the bar, they chase but they can't catch me
Try to snipe from a distance, no Wesley
Now I am counting hundreds I used to be counting pennies
Counting plenty now
Round the globe, many miles
You hatin hard, smile, throw the duce and I'm out
My mothers second child make her so proud
Walk in, hear myself and its playin so loud
Everywhere we go we cause a riot, risin above the choir
Shine like we untraviolet
Homie you lyin, I like it and then I buy it
Hot but homie im fryin, you playin but I'm designin
Autographs signin, top of the chart climbin
Man, I do me you chill and listen to simon... bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boaz and Mac Miller]

If you are looking for me just hit me on the iPhone
Probably on roam how we switching up the time zones

Every way you wanna be they used to make fun of me
But hating all your life, the only thing that you're ever gonna be

While we showin in the world still making bucks, peelin plenty paper till my thumbs got the paper cuts

It's like the whole world underrated us and all of the sudden the whole city on ya radius

You we gotta hold it down for the whole town, enjoying every bit of life as the world goes round

We in the middle of everything, got our own sound. when Mac and Boa in the studio it goes down

We in the club free bottles, good lookin out
Only the baddest bitches with us if you look around

We in the sky, can't see us but we lookin down all around the globe, you stuck in your home town

[Hook]
