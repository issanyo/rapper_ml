[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ayo dipset in London, right up on the youtube
I don't know why it don't got two million two views
That's a great video, chilling in this city though
'bout to do a sold out show, like I'm Diddy though
But I'm not my first name Mac, and if you heard that
My first time in London, I came back
Cause this is freestyle off of the top
And when I rip it on the mic I said your jaw gonna drop
This some biggie, chilling here in this London city
Girls pretty, everything I never smoked ??
Only smoking on that haze you be smoking on that phase
I got bars for days, everybody amazed
Cause every way I'm spitting is crazy
Cats all be rapping on their ish but it doesn't even amaze me
I just saw Kanye and Jay-Z live in Watch The Throne
Gotta girl and I gotta bone
You got a phone, I got two though
Shout out to Future, I copped Pluto
That's a great album, all up on that track
And I flip it back with some gymnastics
