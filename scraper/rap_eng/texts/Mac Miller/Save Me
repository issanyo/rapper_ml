Still can’t seem to figure out
What happens in my head
The thought alone is gonna kill me
Sick of living with this doubt
The pistol in my hand
I can end it all before the morning
The summertime always go come around
I'll be waiting for another smile, yeah
Let my feet off the ground
Try to hold on
But gravity won't let me go
This gravity let me go
Gravity won't let me go
This gravity won't let me go
Ooh oooh woo oh aaah
Ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh oh ooh ooh oh
The devil always smile when you need a friend
I'm laying on this cloud
It’s a long drive back to earth
Wonder when my happy days will fade away
Don’t breath on my parade
If it is only for this moment
So gravity let me go
Can ou please let me go
Let me go oh
Wooohoo will you let me get higher? (higher)
I just wanna get higher
I wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Let me get higher
I wanna get high
Said I wanna get high
Can you let me go?
