[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Verse]
In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it looked like rain
Grey skies and I'm drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head
