(Chorus)
Memories don't live like people do, they always remember you
Whether things are good or bad, it's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do baby don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But lord willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo
I'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But god willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo

(Verse 1)
Ye I keep my bags packed, always back on the road
Headed back to baby girl right after the show
But now I got clothes, hoes, piff, and kicks
Always twist a couple spiffs while I'm in the whip
First thing I need the gas, hit the pump fill the tank up
Tell my homie at the register to stay up
I'm on the parkway feeling like the straight month
Going through the tunnel bout to break up
Phone gets hanged up, tunes turned way up the max
Hit the L twice then pass it to the back breath
My mediation coming in from recreation
Ain't no pause or hesitation, trying to catch my respiration
I ain't never had no patience, so I'm hardly ever waiting
Just creating money making, with creative preparation
Sink all these cats with false representation
Two bigger words maybe need some translation
Intellectual boy figurative language
And that there, that ain't shit
(uh) You feel me? The high life and I'm gone

(Chorus)
Memories don't live like people do, they always remember you
Whether things are good or bad, it's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do baby don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But lord willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo
I'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But god willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo

(Verse 2)
My plane coming down and I'm happy to land
Every time I got to go my girl grabbing my hand
Trying to pull me back to her, and as mad as I am
I gotta make this money I'm a traveling man
So through airplane, boat, or packed in a van
Baby I'mma hurry back to you as fast as I can
It don't matter what I gotta do
Dreams I gotta follow you
Love is what I'm falling to
And ever do I follow through
So ima put it all on you
Just know that I ain't got a clue
But baby I be watching you copping you some Prada shoes
Hurt me when I watch the news
The doctor is in the hospitals trying to heal the sick
But all their chances is impossible
Giving the word like literature spitting the verse
For all of those who live in the Berg
I travel the word the land and the sea
Here to open up your mind
Just hand me the key

(Chorus)
Memories don't live like people do, they always remember you
Whether things are good or bad, it's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do baby don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But lord willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo
I'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But god willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo
