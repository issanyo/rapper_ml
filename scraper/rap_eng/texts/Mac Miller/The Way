[Intro: Ariana Grande (Mac Miller)]
What we gotta do right here is go back
Back into time
I love the way you make me feel (Okay)
I love it, I love it (Yeah)
I love the way you make me feel
I love it (Yeah,) I love it (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Ariana Grande]
Say
I’m thinkin' ’bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower, pickin' petals off of flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain’t a player, I just ***** * ***
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I’m at a 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

[Refrain 1: Ariana Grande]
If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave ya
And I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry
Baby, you got me (Ayy)
I, I got a bad boy, must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way
I love it, I love it
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ou, I love the way, the way I love you
I love it, I love it

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Ou, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin'
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it ain’t a question (Qu—qu—question)
Boy, I know just what you like

[Refrain 2: Ariana Grande]
If you need it, I got it, I got it every day
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave ya
Said I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry
Baby, you got me (Ayy)
I, I got a bad boy, must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way
I love it, I love it
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ou, I love the way, the way I love you
I love it, I love it

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Uh
I make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time
Said your bed be feelin' lonely, so you sleepin' in mine
Come and watch a movie with me, American Beauty
Or Bruce Almighty, that's groovy, just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for ya I’m not gonna get bored of
But, baby, you an adventure so let me come and explore ya

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry (Yeah)
Baby, you got me (Woo)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey) (Uh-huh)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel,) I love the way
I love the way, I love the way
I love it, I love it
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ou, I love the way, the way I love you
I love it, I love it
I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way, I love the way
I love it, I love it
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ou, I love the way, the way I love you

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
The way I love you
You, you, yeah, the way
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, the way I love you
