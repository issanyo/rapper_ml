[Verse 1: Hardo]
I’m just rolling up my next blunt
Pen and pad, I’m just tryna be the next up
I’m a dad, I’m just tryna be the best one
Blood money, going to war about an income
Straight out the ‘burgh, now a nigga out in Cali with it
Riding on the money train, some niggas bound to miss it
Streets like a hurricane, some niggas drowning in it
Chasing money and these dreams, I got no time for bitches
Trapper Hardo, I’m the nigga that they talk about
A1, not the shit that got em dropping out
Spray guns, 30 clips’ll bring them choppers out
Street nigga, yeah I’m really what the block about

[Chorus: Njomza]
We’re out here taking risks
Would never picture this
Past life won’t miss
Fast life is this

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Rap star, I’m a motherfucking rap star
Bad broads, and they laugh at the back of the black car
That’s on the MX, her ass fat in spandex
I tap that then vanish, the Mac’s back god damn it
Khakis on, he a mastadon
Sensei, young padawan
No designer, I’m just tryna get my fashion on
It’s Pittsburgh, that’s Hardo
Fly to Austria, watch Argo
Lambo out the car show, that Murcielago
New god flow, you looking at the head hancho
Rock shows across pond or online
Champion, LeBron know
Bitches from España, they don’t speak Americana
Don’t play them games with me, no don’t make me Barry Bonds ya
I’m very proper, riding like I carry choppers
Dream like a dairy farmer, I’m smoking this marijuana
Blueberry ganja, never run out of ammo
I just want to hear my jams on wham-o

[Chorus: Njomza]
We’re out here taking risks
Would never picture this
Past life won’t miss
Fast life is this

[Verse 3: Hardo]
That glass powder, triple beam nigga
Was the truth, I ain’t never had a dream nigga
Ain’t from ‘burgh, probably wrapped up in some jeans nigga
Get high, post up, waiting on some fiends nigga
What you do in this life, you get accustomed to it
Young banging that slim was part of my influence
Need to cook up some work, I got a pot to do it
When it’s ready to serve I got a spot to move it
Shit I went from the bottom, now headed to the top
Tryna stop what I’m doing, can get what’s in the Glock
All these blocks that I’m moving and tryna duck the cops
I sent my plug up the street, don’t get it off the dots

[Chorus: Njomza]
We’re out here taking risks
Would never picture this
Past life won’t miss
Fast life is this
