[Verse 1]
Well, off the walls with these raps
Better call ya homies off, cause we back
Had it locked all along, I'm not falling off
I'm too smart to fall for these traps
Sitting in the parking lot, my seat back
Getting topped off some mornings, freeze that
Gotta be a God with all of these racks
I don't wanna talk to y'all, the flow Alcamo
And I'm finding this hard to relax
Wonder where my mind has gone, I've seemed sad
When you try'na hide from us, I'm the final boss, and the chance for y'all to feed Mac
Bitches started, wanna be that
Homie you be lying wanna be all I spit facts
These motherfuckers wanna hold me back
And they got me blinded all I see's fact
Talking 'bout a rematch, I be in the belly of the beast playing Dreamcast
Tell me where the weed at
Get that up, little homie don't need that
I forgot my head, skip to my lou bitch
I jumped off the ledge
I like to geek by myself, this is no cry for help
I jumped off of the deep end
Me and my homies we out here
There's not much around here
Come jump off the deep end

[Bridge] (x2)
We really do this (music, music, music, music, music, music) yeah

[Hook]
These motherfuckers can't fuck with my style
Human like me though, you don't come around me
Verses get buried six feet underground
I been waiting so long for what's coming now
And fuck what you heard
You want to see realness then come to the 'Burgh
It's up in the air, but be sure that everything we do is pure
When will these motherfuckers learn?
When will these motherfuckers learn?
When will these motherfuckers learn?

[Verse 2]
Y'all is boring, I've been scoring with a foreign-born model
Shooting porno then I fall asleep
All the Z's Zorro, I'm not sure though
Why did Lizzie McGuire never fuck Gordo?
Eating sushi, copping Toro
We surviving, it's a war zone out here
See, I'm far from normal out here
Rocking fleece when I'm on the beach, I snorkel out here
Yes I'm weird, do not fear the other world that I revere
And stay clear of all the bad guys, cool you in the clear
In the rain, I ain't scared, shit I really can't complain
I don't like what's down the drain, but it's cool, let me explain
I'm alive, I'm okay, do not entertain the lies that they say
You gon' find your way, we just take up space here
