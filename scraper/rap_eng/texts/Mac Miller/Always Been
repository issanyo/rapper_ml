Good weed, fine women, fast cars, new clothes, and I'm ready to go
The further we get the bigger the check new cities more people to know
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin', but that's how it's always been
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin', but that's how it's always been

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah a little bit of Kush, break it down, sprinkle it in the joint shit
The type of stoner who be late for his appointments
Fresh white Crest shit, good
Festive, infest the internet, now my shit congested
Got stupid flow, musically amazin'
Let it out like water, so I'm fluid with the cadence
New York, drove up, flew up took a train then
Hit smoke, when I got here we blazin'
Smoke weed and maintain
And Most Dope with me at any of my engagements
Bunch of fine bitches, line em' up and arrange em'
Black, white, Asian, got a whole compilation
They say I'm talkin' crazy, but I'm young and I don't give a fuck
You wanna hate me, but I'm dope so now you're givin' up
Give me your money and I'll dibby it up
Make sure my homeys got some liquor they can drink in their cups

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I'm in the, wind, plus I'm cool like a Cali night
Might shoot through a few zips, but that's somethin' light
You know I charged through it
Soaring over the clouds, might fall through it
You can't take me out this sour state of mind I'm in
Plus Mac hit me so it's marathon time again
How far is the high life and the finer things
We worldwide they doing minor things
If you ain't flying high then you might as well hate
36 thousand feet in the air I'm feeling great
And I ain't never coming down
You need your pilot license with you whenever I come around
The dispensary I done ran through there
It-it's heroina and it's bamboo here
Courtesy of my homey Brock
Smoker's club baby, we got it all in stock
