Hey, hey
I bet it must be nice chilling every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm working all the time, never getting me a break
Fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I got to be going in
A part of me want to chill, but a part of me want to win
No college paying my bills, I'm saying just what it feels
Cause haters be looking stupid when you just keepin it real
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
When the people coming up sayin I'm forgetting who I am just because they
Random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs I'm trynna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything will be okay

Chorus:
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay

Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true?
One day you gonna make it
If they gave you hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?
I found out being famous in reality, well it ain't shit
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'mma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
And turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for free
Hey man, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?
Bitch suck my dick

Chorus:
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay

Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be all right
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
Don't let anybody say you can't, heart beatin like the 808
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
But everything will be all right!
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright

Chorus:
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
