[Intro]
Yeah
Well

[Verse 1]
I got a bone to pick like roses (Roses)
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Balled a fist, they gossiping, I notice
Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives
Wonder who the fuck I'm supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride and feel the breeze
With something bad beside n' next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone that you picked gon' break, that's a motif (That's a motif)
Yeah, when it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about
Runnin' through the many thoughts that count (That's way better)
Still ain't addin' up, I'll let you know when I've had enough, yeah
Yeah, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd put some money on forever, but I (Hey)
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I
Just watch while
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey

[Chorus]
These are my wings, these are my wings, yeah
These are my wings, yeah, well

[Verse 2]
Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (Slow)
Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listenin' close as I can
Growin' up (One, two, three) jump
Nobody holdin' my hand though
Trust is a problem, never knew how
Yeah, that's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, and I be out (Please tell me)
Who can surf the universe with me?
Lucifer is human, so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And that don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on the up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks?
Now, I look around like, "What the fuck?"
If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Don't ever gamble on the weather, but I
Just watch while the
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, no, no
Yeah, well

[Chorus]
These are my wings, these are my wings
These are my wings
