[Hook: Mac Miller]
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fucking with it then you my dude, my dude
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got their thumbs in the air

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, everything good right now
Little bit of molly make your boy bite down
Thinking I could probably figure out my style on a stage
Looking at a big high crowd
They go insane when I run out the stage
Cause we don't give a fuck, don't need to act our age, hey
When I'm old I'mma spend my days
Laying with my girl on the beach in the shade
Have every single thing I can name
Thank God everyday I don't sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success so I'mma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God he'll be impressed cause
I've been on my grind, thinking I'll be fine if I take my time
Working so hard I might break my spine
So all yall goin' see this face of mine
There's different ways to shine
I'mma find my own, know when I disappear
I'mma find my way back home cause...

[Hook]
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fucking with it then you my dude, my dude
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got their thumbs in the air

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Days go by and I think that I
Maybe going crazy, maybe lose my mind
Looking at a constellation
Me and God have a conversation
God and I, sorry about the lingo
Just kick it in the cut playing bingo
I be all over the beat like Ringo
Look sweet honey bee gonna sting though
I'm here, wanna do my thang
You can roll no matter who you bring
Like your wifey wanna loose that ring
I don't pay her no mind, I just want, I just want, I just want the paper
Bring the games a little more flavor
Say what up, take a flick with a hater
Throwing a deuce like see you later
That's funny, all I really want is a little cash money
Then life is gonna be so sweet, nah it ain't a hotel, nah it ain't a hotel
I'm next, shhhh, don't tell

[Hook]
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fucking with it then you my dude, my dude
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got their thumbs in the air
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fucking with it then you my dude, my dude
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got their thumbs in the air
