Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow
They know who da fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street
Try'n touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But, you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, goy

Sleep on a plane
Wake up in a different state
Rock the stage, get paid
And off to a different date
College boys come up
Offerin' me the haze
And hoes be approachin' me
Offerin' me some brain
I can't complain
People show me love
Actin' like they know me
But no one really does
I say "What up?" and appreciate support
But if you're sparkin' conversation
Please just make it short
'Cuz I ain't got time for no monkey business
I stay on the grind for the money in it
I know I'm cool, I definitely rhyme well
Tellin' jokes to these hoes, Jerry Seinfeld
See you boo
You can come and meet the crew
No one makin' moves like me and Q
And Big Will got the triple Es locked down
I got all your lil sisters on my jock now
At the bar, no I.D. on me
Every girl's eyes be on me
Approach 'em
"Why you so lonely?
I'd introduce myself, but you already know me"

Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow
They know who da fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street
Try'n touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But, you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy

Almost famous, see me standin' on the rooftop
High like some tube socks
Puttin' on a jukebox
Billboard status, y'all know my face
'Cuz I got buzz like a phone on vibrate
Take what's on your plate, put it on my plate
'Cuz I'm hungry and I don't got time to waste
I like my ladies fine, kinda how the wine taste
Hit it from behind, that's a blind date
See, the life of a fly boy funny
Always try'n multiply more money
Yeah, I'm cocky
And they love it, too
Walk up in your crib like, "Who da fuck is you?"
Try'n be a little modest
'Cuz I don't have enough paper in my wallet
Parents think I be somewhere in a college
But I disagree, I'll be somewhere livin' prosperous
There's a lot of things that I ain't got yet
The progress is kinda hard to process
How I'm so young, such a prospect
I'm still crawlin', I ain't even start to walk yet

Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow
They know who da fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street
Try'n touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But, you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy
