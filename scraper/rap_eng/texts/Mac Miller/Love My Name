[Intro: Mac Miller]
This one right here...this the one
Not you bitch the song

[Hook: John Record]
Baby if I don't have money
Then I don't have a heart beat
I know you gon love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights
See the neon lights
In the neon lights
See the neon lights
I know you gon love my name
I know you gon love my name

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I usually write rhymes in the blackberry
But I went back to the pen for this one
So ima let my fingers to the talkin'
And she probably what they talkin' bout
Girl you got to listen
Im in this situation where you got me sittin’ waitin’
And im losin’ all my patience, I just need a vacation
Your friends all player hatin’
Cause I’m the one you always stay awake with
And spend the day with, always wanna walk ya home
And you hate the way my day to day is on the road
Front row know every single song
When she know she comin’ home with me she always bring her thong
Bring her lingerie whatever moods she in
Put a movie in, got the lights dim, we gone make love till nights end
Have you callin' up ya friends like oooh I like him

[Hook: John Record]
Baby if I don't have money
Then I don't have a heart beat
I know you gon love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights
See the neon lights
In the neon lights
See the neon lights
I know you gon love my name
I know you gon love my name

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I know I take ya breath away darling
Smooth playa treat you like a princess
Cause love tricky like parallel parking
A business I won't invest
But I show interest in that slim waist of yours
And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours
Givin’ you flavors that you ain't even taste before
We gone make love till you achin’ sore
And baby don’t worry ima be rich
Name in the neon lights
So how about you give me that kiss
Cause you don’t want to sleep tonight
Your one night love gone get swept off ya feet
Yeah lets get undressed from your breast to ya feet
Light a cigarette just to stay awake
Liquor got us bangin like a 808

[Hook: John Record]
Baby if I don't have money
Then I don't have a heart beat
I know you gon love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights
See the neon lights
In the neon lights
See the neon lights
I know you gon love my name
I know you gon love my name

[Mac Miller and John Record]
Throw your hands up people party all night
Celebrate my name in the neon lights
Throw your hands up people party all night
Celebrate my name in the neon lights
Throw your hands up
You gon love my name
Throw your hands up
You gon love my name
Throw your hands up
You gon love my name

[Hook: John Record]
Baby if I don't have money
Then I don't have a heart beat
I know you gon love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights
See the neon lights
In the neon lights
See the neon lights
I know you gon love my name
I know you gon love my name
