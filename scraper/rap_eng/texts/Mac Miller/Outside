[Intro]
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right
We outside, outside
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
I wake up, throw on some clothes and out the door, I won't be back ma
Shining sun, horizon setting up a lovely backdrop
My life's a topic of a lullaby
Ah, a breath of fresh air is something right
I don't wanna be inside today
Just keep it rolling like we riding skates
I got a half E of haze, I'm thinking we gon' get high today
And let the sunshine all in my face
Oh yeah, this life is good, don't let it all go to waste
Just walk outside the door to get your mom off your case
Yeah, free-living, I swear I be on some hippie shit
But getting way fresher than the hippies is
I got the the gift of gab, something that you wish you had
Don't need to get a strap, no, I'd rather kick a rap
Enjoy the place that you living at, stay around
We just some kids and this world is our playground

[Chorus]
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right
We outside, outside

[Verse 2]
When I be on some kid shit, go and take my shorty on a picnic
And everyday feeling like it's Christmas
The kinda weather had the people living so privileged
I know the Lord take, today he was tryna giveth
Hey, hey, ey, rich or poor, a sunny day a sunny day
We start the madness as soon as we hit the month of May
Rain rain, go away
Waiting for my homie Mr. Sun to come our way
Little kids running through the streets playing'
Poppy on the porch, he ain't got time to waste it
He's just a old man in the sea, Ernest Hemingway
Elevate, look up in the sky, stare at Heaven's face
Second grade, holding down the corner slanging lemonade
Everyday hustling, you riding down penny lane
You ain't gonna get a day like this
So put to rest your troubles with that goodnight kiss

[Chorus]
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right
We outside, outside
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right
We could post outside for the night
Do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside?
Cause it's nice out and we could get high
Oh yeah, the sun shining and I'm feeling right
We outside, outside
