[Mac Miller]
Put your hands up if you feel like you a salamander
Me, me, me
You ain't no human, you a salamander
Put your hands up if you feel like
You a motherfucking form of energy
You ain't even, these electrons
These bones just keeping it all together
We full of spirits, look

American born, welcome to my stomping grounds
In point breeze, where I used to walk around my father's house
Older brother used to always say I was adopted
Convinced I'm a Russian foster child my family forgot about
Curious toddler, such imagination
Didn't have the patience to be top of the class at my graduation
Little pervert infatuated with masturbation
Couldn't wait to bust a nut, watching porn, in love with sluts
Rusty trumpets and such, disgusting sleezy shit
12 years old sexual deviant, got my penis licked in 7th grade
Thought I was a man now
Couldn't understand how my parents still thought I was a little kid
I had the mind of a 109 year old elder man
The passion of the Christ and the memory of an elephant
Used to wonder all bout heaven and hell
Witnessed death at a young age
I said to myself, we all mortals
We leave this world into eternal life
Other kids of different religion wonder which person's right
Worry bout your fate, no separation of church and state
You be good, never break the law, you'll see the pearly gates
Fuck philosophical, back to the diabolical
Binocular couldn't see my skills, I'm way too ill for that
I feel my raps will be underrated and underappreciated
Until I pow, blow my brains out
I need to stop paying attention to opinion shit
I rather be the pen that come and sign your death certificate
Kill your career if you give me a year
The X Factor, whip my dick out, give Britney the spear
Got some shit for your ears, it's something to be excited 'bout
Here to give you industry critics some shit to write about
Me or you, who got the nicer house
You got a daughter of age, might have to pipe her now
If Sean Price is mike Tyson now
I might as well turn my life around
And check these fools like Nike town
But what would have happen if Lance would have never biked a mile
I was blind, but I'm seeing like a psychic now
I know the future like Atlanta
I knock it out the park like my name was Joey Randa
Ball like Miguel Cabrera or Garciaparra
Sail the French Riviera and my camera panorama
This radiation, sample the gamma
I look like money whillie whips looks like a panda
Word, sinister, administer bits of comic life
You bullshittin' homie, go and get your economics right (money!)

How many emcees wanna come and test me
My technique, weaving through this traffic on my jet ski
Looks can be deceiving and my raps are so friendly (ah they're so nice)
Yeah my raps are so friendly (so polite)
How many emcees wanna come and test me
My technique, weaving through this traffic on my jet ski
I know that looks can be deceiving and my raps are so friendly, ah they're so nice
Yeah my raps are so friendly, so polite
