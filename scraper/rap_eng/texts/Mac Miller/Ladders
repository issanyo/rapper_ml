[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, yeah, you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meets the light
Turn to day

[Verse 1]
Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on your door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain, I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free your mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I catch you
Blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow your mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Refrain]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
All the- lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delay, but I came and you're cool with it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle's made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow, we gotta find a way, okay

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Refrain]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

[Instrumental Outro]
