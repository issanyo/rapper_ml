[Chorus: Mac]
Ayo I'm living the high life
Fly clothes, good liquor, good weed (good weed)
Fine hoes, all the things imma need (imma need)
We get these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic
And we gon' have them like:
La la la la, la la la, la la la la, la la la ehh
Sit back relax and move slow and now we on cruise control

[Verse 1: Wiz]
Wizzle man, the fans can't keep em off me
Always repping for my city even though I don't see em often
As a younging learn it's best keep em talking
I only say I'm the best cause that's what the people call me
And imma keep shining till the day the reaper call me
Alot a shit on my chest so I suggest you keep from round me
Tryna slander my name but when you sit and think about it - it's  hard to show off your aim when niggas yet to see the target
He's talking that mess cause he's garbage
My trees rolled beauty, other week is foreign
And my homie bought a yacht so we on it and drinks are pouring
Hoes admire my clothes cause I got Louis features on em
Life just like a movie plus the special feature bonus with -
Bad bitches and good weed to keep us coughing
Hard as a bed of nails you a beast for sleeping on em
Motherfucker yeee.. bitch

[Chorus: Mac]
Ayo I'm living the high life
Fly clothes, good liquor, good weed (hahaha)
Fine hoes, all the things Imma need (what up Mac)
We get these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic (yee)
And we gon' have them like: (Taylor Gang or die, I see you nigga)
La la la la, la la la, la la la la, la la la ehh
Sit back relax and move slow and now we on cruise control (ey good lookin Wiz)

[Verse 2: Mac]
I got these motherfuckers hating on the way the boy live
Angry at the way the ladies always say I'm the shit
People stay up on my dick, I ain't worry 'bout them
I'm too focused on the money I ain't worried about friends
They say the younging dream like a king (like a king)
I'm Muhammad Ali in the ring, Christmas Eve in the spring
Waiting for the boy, but I ain't 21, Wizzle cutting up, cause I stay puffin blunts
And when the money come, imma give it back
Got a driver who adresses me as Mister Mac
Dealing with these diva hoes, they so demanding
Maccy young superstar, Dakota Fanning
You know I'm planning for the world to be mine
No blind dates but I'm getting girls from behind
The type of shine - stay turned and I am blind
Just cruisin' smokin' purp and recline

[Chorus: Mac]
Ayo I'm living the high life
Fly clothes, good liquor, good weed (good weed)
Fine hoes, all the things imma need (imma need)
We get these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic
And we gon' have them like:
La la la la, la la la, la la la la, la la la ehh
Sit back relax and move slow and now we on cruise control
