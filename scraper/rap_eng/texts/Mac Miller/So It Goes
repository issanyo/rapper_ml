[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Um, yeah, well

[Chorus 1]
You could have the world in the palm of your hand
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em "red light, stop it"
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics

[Verse 1]
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot o' dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall, the grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it (it gets so exhausting)
Often with the bullshit, but, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
Okay, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hand
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
So it goes
It's like, in every conversation, we the topic
This narcissism, more like narcotics
So it goes

[Chorus 2]
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standing, sit down
Woah-oh
And I know I been out (and I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (but now I'm back in town) so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
So it goes (so it goes)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
So it goes

[Verse 2]
Well, this is a special delivery, comin' to you live with the
Endless artillery, always down to ride
My eyes on the enterprise
Nine lives, never die, fuck a heaven, I'm still gettin' high
Never mind, did I mention I'm
Fine, 'cause her pussy gettin'
Wetter when the weather dry
Clementine, peelin' off
And everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7'' 'cept I'm feelin' like I'm 7'5"
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happening, my man
No relaxing, kicking back, this ain't exactly in the plan
I can't get no satisfaction, goddamn
They sayin' I been gone too long
I could just tell 'em fuck you, but that come on too strong
My god, it go on and on
Just like a circle, I go back to where I'm from

[Chorus 2]
Well, everybody gather around
I'm still standing, sit down
Woah-oh
And I know been out (and I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (but now I'm back in town) so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
Da da da da da, da da da
Da da da da da, da da
So it goes (so it goes)
Da da da da da, da da da
Da da da da da da, da da
So it goes
