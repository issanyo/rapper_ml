[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Oh my, this guy, don't smile but don't cry
Not to be real tough, some nights I tried
But they won't ever fall they are too dry
Don't try to climb this wall, I hate when you pry
Oh sunshine won't you go away
Oh sunshine won't you find a place
In my heart, where it's dark
Light up my chest, like mr stark
How could you luv me when you left a mark
Something to remind me not to trust my heart
Cause he's dumb, it's no fun, being sad
I need some sun, in my life, please don't add
Oh pain won't you go away
Oh pain won't you evaporate
In the air, I can't wear
You no more man I swear

[Bridge]
Heart throb, Cupid robbed
Me of all my pride
I'm tired of heart throb
Pain dear friend is my bride

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What if I told you heart throb is something real
Something you can't see but something you can feel
When the pain in your chest can't be explained
It ain't heartburn becasue it feels like a train
At full speed running over it you know
The feeling when you getting booed at the apollo
Guess I couldn't please her, wasn't good enough
Guess she was a teaser, some good nuts
Some good fucks but still lust never luv
All pussy ain't good pussy so she could get the gluv
