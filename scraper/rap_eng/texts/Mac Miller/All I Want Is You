[Chorus]
Girl, I don't wanna share you
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by, baby all I'm gonna want is you

[Verse 1]
Look, they told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favor
You way too young and right now that's just human nature
You think you love her, but you don't
Think you gon be with her for the rest of your life, you prolly won't
But on my side, shorty just attacked me from the blindside
Used to be a player now I'm sidelined
Connect like Wi-fi, mixed like tye-dye
She feelin' cute wanna wear a little lingerie, voila
It ain't a sexual thing though
We be stayin' up smokin' weed out her window
In love with me now, she never huntin' me down
I'm tryna have it all, she ain't comin' around
It's like a never endin' chase, longer than a marathon
See the smile on her face, and I can't help but carry on
I know you love me don't lie (don't lie), but you just gotta be mine
Cause

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't wanna share you
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by, baby all I'm gonna want is you

[Verse 2]
Look, I know this girl who want the world to call her own
Goin' through these dudes like some minutes on a phone
And once she leave, she ain't comin' back home
Hit the road forgettin' about everybody she know
Miss hasn't called me in four days
But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay
Hey, she tryna be a lil' player, think she cute too
But I'mma yank her out the game like a loose tooth
When the boy blow, I know she worried
About all these girls who approach me actin' flirty
See that's the thing thing, I don't give a fuck
I want your heart so baby give it up
In this life girl, all we can do is try
Forget that dumb stuff, it's just you and I
We can travel 'round the world movin' through the sky
Or we can stay right here and you'll be mine

[Chorus]
Girl, I don't wanna share you
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by, baby all I'm gonna want is you
