[Hook: Mac Miller]
Memories don't live like people do, they always remember you
Whether things are good or bad, it's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do baby don't forget me
I'm a travelin' man, movin' through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But Lord willin' I'm comin' back to you, baby boo
I'm a travelin' man, movin' through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But God willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I keep my bags packed always back on the road
Headed back to baby girl right after the show
But now I got clothes, hoes, piff, and kicks
Always twist a couple spiffs while I'm in the whip
First thing I need the gas, hit the pump fill the tank up
Tell my homie at the register to stay up
I'm on the parkway feelin' like the straight month
Goin' through the tunnel bout to break up
Phone gets hanged up, tunes turned way up the max
Hit the L twice then pass it to the back
Breathe, my meditation comin' in from recreation
Ain't no pause or hesitation, tryna' to catch my respiration
I ain't never had no patience, so I'm hardly ever waitin'
Just creatin' money makin', with creative preparation
Sick of all these cats with false representation
Two big of words ? maybe need some translation
Intellectual boy, figurative with language
And that there, that ain't shit
Uh, you feel me? The High Life and I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
My plane comin' down and I'm happy to land
Every time I got to go my girl grabbin' my hand
Tryna' to pull me back to her, and as mad as I am
I gotta make this money I'm a travelin' man
So through airplane, boat, or packed in a van
Baby I'mma hurry back to you as fast as I can
It don't matter what I gotta do, dreams I gotta follow you
Love is what I fall into, and ever do I follow through
So I'mma put it all on you, just know that I ain't got a clue
But baby I be watchin' you, and coppin' you some Prada shoes
Hurt me when I watch the news, the doctor's in the hospitals
Tryna' to heal the sick, but all their chances is impossible
Givin' the word like literature
Spittin' the verse, for all of those who live in the Burg
I travel the word the land and the seas
Here to open up your mind, just hand me the key

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I'm leaving on a jet plane
And don't know when I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
