[Bridge]
Even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life flashing light before me
So even if I told you it's like I see my whole life

[Chorus]
Flashing light, flashing light, flashing light
Flashing light, flashing light, flashing light
Flashing light, flashing light, flashing light
Flashing light, flashing light, flashing light

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Perfect picture, she lovely
It hurts to miss her
Fall in love like its my first time then she always runs away
She crazy though and turns away
It's popping pills - she loves a rave
Tryin' to get that money saved to party hard, stayin up for days
Head to Tokyo, we'll find our aid in Romeo, its nowhere when she blow her nose
Got a problem, girl, I'll hold her close

[Bridge]
Even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life flashing light before me
So even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life flashing light before me

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Lights flash, then we strike a pose
Down a hill, then we like to roll
Can't ignore it, she make me feel euphoric
Cause every time I'm with her I feel like I'm just a tourist
It's her world I'm visiting, she wants down and she don't care about them little things
She signed up for that faster life, filled with money, drugs and flashing lights
Yo!

[Chorus]

It's like I see my

Even if I told you, told you, told you, told you, told you
It's like I see my whole life flashing light
Flashing light, flashing light, flashing light
Flashing light, flashing light, flashing light
Flashing light, flashing light, flashing light

Even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life flashing light before me
