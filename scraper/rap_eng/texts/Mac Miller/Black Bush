[Hook]
Tell me what reality is, all of ya’ll back off my dick
Whoa, woah, I don’t get mad about shit
Did you see that ass on that bitch
No, woah, no I’m not waiting in line
Got a little paper that’s fine
Whoa, woah, find it hard to make up my mind
All of ya’ll hate when I shine
Whoa, woah...

[Interlude]
Ladies and gentlemen
This is a revolution

[Verse 1]
On that black bush, smoke a bunch of Backwoods
My mind numb, I’m high as high come
I’m somewhat of a fuck up, put it in her guts ‘till the cum bust
Combustion, at the function, drunk and acting as prophets would
When Pac rocked with Suges, smoking blunts at Hollywood
I was a youngin’ who didn’t know shit 'bout nothing
Now I’m 21 and I feel like I’m on to something
Getting emphysema, madder than Ebenezer
I’m a king bitch, (salads, I get a caesar)
Pulling uranium from Mesopotamian rivers
I need a bitch that let me fuck and make me some dinner
God made me a sinner, following protocol
Overall, I’m fucking bitches and there’s coke involved
Watching Carl Sagan, wishing I could talk Jamaican
I’m waiting, be prepared for invasion

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I blow a kiss to the Jehovah’s Witness
Fuck a corporation, I support local business
And this one goes out to all the hoes and bitches
My homies told me better know your limits
I’m so efficient, ultra dishing with dope prevision
We smoking if we here, homie don’t need no permission
Variation of avian in the atrium
Waiting for nature’s rain to shower ya’ll with some sense
Shit, life gets realer, then the press kits
Special like Ed is, someone call a medic
‘Cause I lost my mind, I’m off the Richter scale
Don’t you worry yourself, baby this is hell
Product of a witches spell, rappers all Chippendales
I’m getting-getting money now, expensive ginger ale
Sip the whiskey with a bitch named Lewinsky
Told her give me head and tell everybody
