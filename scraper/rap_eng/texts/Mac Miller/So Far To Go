(Chorus)
Got my mind in the cloud see paradise living with style
My mom should be proud I've been dedicated now for a while
I'm in love with hip-hop, I'm in love with life
I'm in love with the days, late nights, kush, money, I'm in love with this mic (love with this mic)
And I've got time on my side because I'm young and I'm grindin' so hard (grindin' so hard)
Because I'm saying something every single time and I'm rhyming my bars (rhyming my bars)
I'm just a child, y'all gon' see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to go

Sometimes I think about this time next year
Grinding to the fullest kicking rhymes for your ears
I wonder if they hear me now, coming fresh with a style
The illest child always chilling with a smile
Cause hip-hop waitin' for me back at home, we just need to have a little time alone
Because lately I've been living life by my phone
Tryin' to do business, mind on my dough
Woah, hold up, let me take a rest
Bring your back with my dogs like I'm playing fetch
I'm trying to be the future, molding the CD
Something bumping out the system all repeat
My minds elevated like ET
Work hard in quick sand, knee deep
You know I'm always doing double like a re-read
It's like I played the whole game with a cheat sheet
Dollar signs to my name like Too Short
Gonna go broke with this tax no newport
I'm unhealthy, working to succeed
Trying to spit out more words than I can read
Staying up late, keep burning through this weed
My grandma probably turning in her
G-R-A-V-E, that's right
Spelling bee champ 5th grade
This my job, I'm about my guap
Keep it fresh like shoes right out the box
I'm just trying to give you something loud to knock
So far to go, but I'm never gon' stop

(Chorus)
Got my mind in the cloud see paradise living with style
My mom should be proud i've been dedicated now for a while
I'm in love with hip-hop, I'm in love with life
I'm in love with the days, late nights, kush, money, I'm in love with this mic
I've got time on my side because I'm young and I'm grindin' so hard
Because I'm saying something every single time and I'm rhyming my bars
I'm just a child, you can see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to go
