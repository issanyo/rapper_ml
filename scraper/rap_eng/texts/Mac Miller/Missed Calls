[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin' but I know you might
Now get along, I get along, I go
You sing along, to every song that you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growing old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm 8 or 9
Trying to move on, talking to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that
Ripping people's hearts out, are you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language
I guess people always going through changes
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into detail
About how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave so
Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details 'bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go, you'll be fine on your own, own

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
She tell me, "You an asshole, superficial douche bag
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me she said, "I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm bout to lose you"
I'mma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into detail
About how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave so
Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details 'bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go, you'll be fine on your own, own
