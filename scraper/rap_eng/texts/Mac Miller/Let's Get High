[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yo, what’s up
Right now this is Mac Miller with my homie TreeJ
You know what I’m saying it’s 4/20
Piff Jar baby getting me fucked up
High as hell, right now, so much weed in my lungs
I’m really high, it’s like a fucking movie except I can’t see cause I’m so high
Thank you TreeJ for this bomb-ass weed you hooked me up with, peace, love, more weed, blah blah blah!
Man you kids got some, you got some other stuff, man
Yeah man, yeah man. Sounds like a weed anthem right here
And if you say I make to many weed songs, I say you don’t smoke enough weed! Bitch!

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Let’s get high, high, lets get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
I wanna get high
Grab it break it, roll it up, smoking joints, smoking blunts, grab it break it roll it up, roll it up, roll it up

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Feel good when you go and get an O
And you wanna roll the whole thing up
A little codeine in my cup with some funk
Gon' take me up I'm trying to get lifted are you
With it cause you ain't ever been this high
Before I'mma light my weed inhale then blow that
Smoke gotta bag full of good we can toke no
Air balloon but lets float we way up in the clouds
Dancing on the stars keep breaking it down then
Rollin up cigars paper or blunt lets roll it
Vaporizer or bong or lets bowl it so gone im feelin
Home sick this chronic so explosive

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
And I ain't comin down

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Let’s get high, high, lets get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
I wanna get high
Grab it break it, roll it up, smoking joints, smoking blunts, grab it break it roll it up, roll it up, roll it up

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Gotta little bit of weed from my homie on the
Corner but I gotta get more hovering above the
Floor I can go anywhere no cord more or less I'm
High and you can't catch me
Yeah that bag of fifth dont impress me
Weed gunna knock me into next week
We just tryna get jetskied a bong with ice
But no Gretzky you trying to get high with me
Travel 30 thousand feet in to the sky with me
Smoke til you feel like you gon' die with me
I got sour kush and all kinds of weed
Come fly with me I can sing I just find the
Key and he know where all the vinyls be so
He be makin all kinds of beats
And when I find my tree I'mma roll it up
Never ever gunna sober up if you wanna come show
Some love just smoke my drugs

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Let’s get high, high, lets get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
I wanna get high
Grab it break it, roll it up, smoking joints, smoking blunts, grab it break it roll it up, roll it up, roll it up
