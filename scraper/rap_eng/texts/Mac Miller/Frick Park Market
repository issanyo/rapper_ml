[Intro]
Uhh, let me get a turkey sandwich, uh lettuce tomato (bitch)

[Verse 1]
My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you
Well my crew too live but I ain’t Uncle Luke
And I ain’t no hipster, but girl I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I’m dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I’m heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop & Glo
Tryin’ to get a mansion ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin’ with whats trendy
My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)
And anybody in my way goin’ to be left to die

[Hook]
I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch
I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market

[Verse 2]
I got my own stickers now so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool you better get prepared
Don’t know ‘bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I’ve been a boss so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chilling writing on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just bout who the hardest
On my own two, fuck who's saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I’m the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I’m just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin’ it and goin’ in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn’t fuckin’ know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in

[Hook]
I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch
I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market

[Outro]
Yeah
And this is Blue Slide Park
