Who rocks grooves and make moves with all the mamas (I'm V.I.P)
Who rocks grooves and make moves and make moves with em
Who rocks grooves and make moves with all the mamas (I'm V.I.P)
Who rocks grooves and make moves and make moves with em
Who rocks grooves and make moves with all the mamas (I'm V.I.P)
Who rocks grooves and make moves and make moves with em
Who rocks grooves and make moves with all the mamas (I'm V.I.P)
Who rocks grooves and make moves and make moves with em
In the back of the club sippin more liquors than your father
[Verse 1: Consequence]
This is just an appetizer for all the advertisers
Until I re-up like Pusha T and ab liber
See I'm a bad driver I'll make your computer crash
But it ain't by accident how I be running into cash
Damn I heard you been ran through your stash
It's messed up how your life be going
And that's unfortunate I heard how your wife be hoeing
She no different than a chick who marry Gary Coleman
Well at the moment, I guess what Im tryna say
The best way to describe how my homies play
Is they be pourin champagne up in the telly
Im from the same part of Queens you mightve seen the belly
So just bring the bottles out that you're tryna sell me
I dont give a damn about the ? like R Kelly
Cause Im runnin the pick and roll
Whenever my guys toast
We takin shots with women who be playin high post
