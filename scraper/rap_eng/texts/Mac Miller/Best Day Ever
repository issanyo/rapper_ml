[Verse 1]
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say "ow", make 'em say "oh"
The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "no"
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope

[Hook]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever

[Verse 2]
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure

[Hook]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever
