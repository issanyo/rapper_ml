[Intro]
This is gonna feel real good, alright?
Most Dope
Everybody please put your thumb in the air

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in (Hey)

[Verse 1]
I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm bout
Trying to get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night - Johnny Carson
I ain't gotta Benz, no just a Honda
But try to get my money like an Anaconda
Real, real long cross the country
Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream
All the pretty little girls come flock with me, yeah I rock the beat

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in (Hey)

[Verse 2]
And I like my rhymes witty, all my dimes pretty
If you got weed you can come fly with me
I don't take pity on them silly little hoes
Milli Vanilli but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shh, shut up bitch and ride this dick
I'm just playing, let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wrecking the etiquette for the hell of it
Smelling it when the L is lit and I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls giving brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in
Finna have a party, baby, you can tell your friends
We the type, looking right, still setting trends
Fuck a job, I'ma get these dead presidents

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in (Hey)

[Break]
Not a day, goes by
When I ain’t gettin’ high
They wonder why
Don’t I
Go get myself a job
So I can make, them bucks
But I don’t give a fuck
No I feel great
Bitch I feel great

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in
Let 'em in (Hey)
