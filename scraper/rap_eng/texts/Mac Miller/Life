[Verse 1]
I didn’t mean to pull the trigger, I swear
But now she’s dead and there ain’t no coming back once you there
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared
Your food getting cold, why don’t you come sit down in this chair
We can talk about all the things we should have done
All the arguments that you probably would have won
But I’m stubborn, baby, you knew that when you told me you loved me
And I told you I loved you back
But now you laying on the tile, I’m waiting for a smile
So I’ll stay here for a while, when the cops come in
They’re gonna have to take me away

[Hook]
And I tell ‘em, I’m sorry
I didn’t mean to do it
I guess I’m just emotional
And maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close
So why'd I have to give you away
I tell ‘em, I’m sorry
I’m not a bad person
I couldn’t take your pain away
I guess I’m undeserving
But if I can’t have you to myself
Then you're, gone

[Verse 2]
I didn’t mean to pull the trigger, I swear
Life full of surprises, but that shit isn’t fair
Tell me how we live is different, guess this shit kinda rare
Your food getting cold, why don’t you come sit down in this chair
We can talk about everything you hate on this earth
And that you’re getting tired, cause you making it work
But can I kiss you just one more time
Baby lemme close your eyes, feel your lips touching mine
I’m sure I’ve never seen you look more heavenly
Now I’m rubbing on your back, whispering rest in peace
It’s okay baby, go to sleep
I’ll keep you safe, you alone with me
Say I wouldn’t hurt you, I lied
I don’t deserve you, I tried
So I’m a stay by your side
But when the cops come in
They’re gonna have to take me away

[Hook]
And I tell ‘em, I’m sorry
I didn’t mean to do it
I guess I’m just emotional
And maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close
So why'd I have to give you away
I tell ‘em, I’m sorry
I’m not a bad person
I couldn’t take your pain away
I guess I’m undeserving
But if I can’t have you to myself
Then you're, gone
