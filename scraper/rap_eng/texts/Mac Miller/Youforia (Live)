[Verse]
I been waiting so long
Been waiting to have you by my side (tell you "I love you")
I can't do no wrong, no you are an angel
With you by my side, you are my euphoria
And when you look in my eyes
The pain goes a-way, euphoria (euphoria)
You feel so damn good, I want you to know that
Just come take my hand closer so hear me out
We could go to the moon
Look at my eyes as we land
We're here now

[Chorus]
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
Now when you lay in my arms the pain goes a-way, euphoria

[Chorus]
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh
Euphoria
Euphoria

(Euphoria)

[Outro]
And when you're mine, I won't let you goThe pain, it can't stay (euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
