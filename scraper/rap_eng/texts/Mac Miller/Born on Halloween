[Verse one: Mac Miller]

Yo, look I'm kickin to fight deliver this could it get rid of your life
Isn't it nice? I'm rippin it once, it's hittin you twice
Ghost deliver it nice so take it as a present
Fuck sittin in college, I kick this knowledge for the lesson
It burns ya chest, the words are blessed, confuse and bring ya questions
Cause with my complexion, a finger nail can cut the tension
And in case I didn't mention spittin it better than anyone did it before
I'm rippin your corpse, dippin and lettin you live in the morgue
Shit in the porsche, trick or treat I'm here to piss on the floors
And if I didn't come with the whip I'm gettin in yours
On devils night we come to bless this track
Mischief so we rest from raps
Steal your soul, snatch your heart, laugh and let your chest collapse
I'm dressed in black, ready to run up inside your crib
Smack you upside the head while you sittin beside your kid
I laugh cause your son's in my history class
Make him cry while he sees his dad kissin my ass
Spittin razor sharp cancer so I'm pissin out glass
Sit and relax, you bitches stay and live in the past
And hers a toast for me and ghost we be the dopest with this rhyme still
Ghosts raps explode like they running through a mine field
Time killin itself, clock blowing out his brains
Cause you are the average joes, who goes without a name
