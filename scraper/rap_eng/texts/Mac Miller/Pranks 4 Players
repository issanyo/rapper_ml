[Intro: Casey Veggies]

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
It go rock-a-bye baby
What if I'm fuckin' with my butterfly lady
In the backseat of the 'Cedes, or the Saleen
Something that I cop, made in the eighties
I've been lost inside this puzzle
Rearrangin', keep on sayin'
I'm a god damn fool
Tell me quit playin'
I'm like, "no can do"
Been through this bullshit
Actin' foolish as a dude that's hit with Cupid doings
Music is the key to everything I keep pursuin'
Bitches used to do the friend thing
Now they ask me what I'm doin'
Trying to give me head before the show
Go out, I'm interviewin' with a student newspaper
Maybe with the radio
Curb Your Enthusiasm
Huh, the Larry David Show
It's something that we probably watchin' while we be gettin' high
Step aside if anybody think they lookin' fresh as I am
With my Daily Bread hoodie and a floral hat
This shit these rappers talkin 'bout
I'm getting bored of that

[Hook: Mac Miller & Sir Michael Rocks]
This, or that
And a wiffle ball bat
Make a million dollars
Then I give it all back
These rappers talking shit
When they shit is all wack
Yeah I said it on wax

Pulling stars from the sky
Live large, get high
Women lie, men lie
But we always fly
At the end of the movie
Dubs always cry
Pulling stars from the sky
Live large, get high

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
It's all live, baby
Golded up like Tut
It make guys hate me
But I ain't giving a fuck
I tell them, "drive safely"
How dare a man lift his hand at me
Like I'm goin' flinch, I'm not no bitch
With the concreature concrete monuments
Your man prolly pack his bag if you tryin' to trip
Nick Bruno, Boldy James kinda shit
It's like the Godfather, y'all gotta honor this
Tryin' to split the money up like communists
You should shake the person hand that put you on to this
Hold up, that's the swag you would kill for (kill for)
What the fuck you tryin' to chill for (wake up)
Are you alive or a still born
Cause you really ain't livin' till you get yours
Sky's the limit, we could build doors
Open 'em up, nothing gon' be closed, I'm sure

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks & Mac Miller]
This, or that
And a wiffle ball bat
Make a million dollars
Then I give it all back
These rappers talking shit
When they shit be all wack
Yeah I said it on wax

We pullin' stars out the sky
Live large, get high
Women lie, men lie
But we always fly
At the end of the movie
Dubs always cry
Pullin' stars out the sky
Live large, get high, ha
