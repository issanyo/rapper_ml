[Intro]
This is a message to, uh, all of you who, uh, don't believe, alright?

[Hook]
They gunna try to bring you down
Hating is what they do
But you gotta keep a smile
Stay up on your move
Live free, live free, live free, live free
Homie live free, live free, live free, live free
They gunna try to tell you no
Shatter all your dreams
But you gotta get up and go
To bigger better things
Live free, live free, live free, live free
Homie live free, live free, live free, live free

[Verse 1]
Hey yo, microphone check one, two, one, two
We good ? just had to make sure I'm comin' through
With the driver Ricky Bobby, more class than a college
And the shine of Liberaci, 'bout time that you acknowledge
That the boy here to stay, fired up begin to blaze
Buzzin' out my name, gettin' out like a triple play
Haters tell you what you can't do, fuck that
Say there's everything you can do but rap
Shit, I paint pictures with a hot flow
Young Picasso, ya feel me? I thought so
There's people in the world that are jealous of success
Don't ever second guess yourself, step or get left (get left)
We on the march we ain't waitin' for no man
You can't get distracted by haters & romance
So if you sittin' trapped in defeat
Get that monkey off your back, live free

[Hook]
They gunna try to bring you down
Hating is what they do
But you gotta keep a smile
Stay up on your move
Live free, live free, live free, live free
Homie live free, live free, live free, live free
They gunna try to tell you no
Shatter all your dreams
But you gotta get up and go
To bigger better things
Live free, live free, live free, live free
Homie live free, live free, live free, live free

[Verse 2]
And everybody know I got haters like Maino
Actors all phony, give 'em Tonys like Yayo
Flush the bullshit out of music, Drain-O
This a true story type of movie, Fandango
Flamethrower, strange flow
They got me on the top like a halo
A Christmas tree Angel, yeah
My team attack the game from all angles
Passin' all these rappers, just pussycats, Bengals
Hip-hop's LeBron, nothing better
Here to kick you out the game Braylon Edwards
Fast Devin Hester runnin like six feet
You got a sign on your back like kick me
I'm a race bike, six speed, nah you can't get me
Move too swiftly don't deal with other rappers tryin to gyp me
Cuz im way down the road where I live free

[Outro]
Yeah to all of you getting trapped by those who doubt you
Be like bitch, just keep on pushing
