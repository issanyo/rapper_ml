Ladies and gentlemen
This is Macadelic
Mother Fucker

[Mac Miller: Verse 1]
Ugh I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sippin'
Groupies fall in love, I’m like bitch you must be trippin’
I’m just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck and nothing 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain
Yeah you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
But it don’t make a difference if you cryin’ in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'mma kill more
I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mil more
Play a number one spot on the billboard

[Bridge]
Yeah people lie, numbers won’t
Keep me high, drugs is close
Not growing up, pour a cup
Watch the world go up in smoke

[Hook x2]
I like my music real loud (real loud)
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn’t, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud (real loud)
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)
Here she comes, there she go, never chasing after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Benny Banks: Verse 2]
I've got weed up in my rizla
You can bet your life I'm smokin'
I'll be tokin' 'till I'm chokin'
I'm forever ever puffin' potent
Take your girlfriend right up off you
Go report that bitch she stolen
I dig deep up in that pussy 'till her leg drop like Hulk Hogan
I'm the realest ever living most these other rappers bogus
I got money for a mortgage this time last year I was homeless
I get pees the broke don't like it
See me coming and the rich get frightened
This is my mouth I ain't ever gonna mind it
Lost my mind maybe I don't wanna find it
I make them hate, haters gon' hate
A B C I'm all about cake
Born and raised I ain't ever gonna change
I'll still take the food off your plate
You can call me the great white hulk
Came and I leave and I take shit home
Got her mad at me cah I do it on my own
Now they gotta watch how the world go up in smoke

[Hook]
I like my music real loud (real loud)
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn’t, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud (real loud)
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)
Here she comes, there she go, never chasing after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Mac Miller: Verse 2]
I’ma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team, in that pack with me
Hear that Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be
Tryna fuck the female faculty
I’m a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won’t ever fuck with yay
I just made a million dollars still I think I’m underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way
When you meet me, bitches stand up straight
Pump out reps, yeah I got reps
Tryna talk shit what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank rolls, I’ma lay low chill, til I let that stack

[Bridge + Hook]
