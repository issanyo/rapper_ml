What if I’ll never make it?
What if I’m never famous?
What if, I’m broke
And my whole life is been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
What if I gotta stop rapping?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

What if I never got the chance to tell the world what I gotta say?
When I’ll die all I do is just ride away
I tried to talk about my life in every song
So you have a little something to remember when I’m gone
I tell you like this, I ain’t pretending in the…
But I tell you that I’m working and I’m getting very strong
It won’t b long ’till you hear me on the radio
But in my head I got ways to go
But I’mma take it slow, this is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can …
I’m taking notes, I am hip hop
It replaces my soul if I sing to the bottom and make a flow
I heard the real world’s cold, I’mma take your coat
Be prepared, and be aware …

What if I’ll never make it?
What if I’m never famous?
What if, I’m broke
And my whole life is been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
What if I gotta stop rapping?
What if, what if, what if this is it?

Expectations picking, they wonder what I’m about to do
Sport interest, music I can count on you, right?
Do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to… in an instant
My friends forgot me cause they probably seen me on…
In an… where I should be out at a party!
It drives me crazy, money is the due
Insomnia I could wait.. something I can do to put the work in it…
Failure getting jealous, throwing dirt upon my name
Burning up my pain, but I’m working through my pain
Cause life’s hard, ’till you learn it’s just a game!
Play your cards, use your letters on your scrabble board
If you’re small, put your heart into your rapping more
No money? why the fuck you’re counting for?
A thousand.. trying to get up my allowances

What if I’ll never make it?
What if I’m never famous?
What if, I’m broke
And my whole life is been a joke?
What if nothing never happens?
