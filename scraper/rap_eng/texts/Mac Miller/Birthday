[Sample: Daisy & Tom & Nick]
Oh, there's a bird on the lawn!
I think it must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or the White Star Line, he's singing away, it's romantic isn't it Tom?

Yes, it is romantic

It had been a golden afternoon, and I remember having the familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer

[Instrumental]

[Sample: Nick]
It was what preyed on him
What foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams

[Instrumental]
