2 records hard to find
So I thought I'd start this rhyme with a couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind
I've had all the dimes
And all are fine but now I need the one to call her mine
You know that girl that everybody wants?
But can't have fat ass, nice eyes, high class
I get the last laugh now cause she under my arm, layin' down, hittin' L's lookin' up at the stars
I tell her listen, I ain't gonna do you wrong, forget what you hearin' on my songs
My always is gone, I'mma be real wit' ya
Recently I've been lookin' at the big picture
Perfectly framed see the way I'm workin' the game
Take my name I'mma share all of my fortune n' fame
Beauty or brains, girl you all the above
True playa' for real but now I'm fallin' love

[Hook]
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady [x6]

You used to the bullshit the dudes put you through it
Cupid, never shot up nuisance
See with me my love is with the music, but baby you can be the next to it
My boys say I'm stupid I need to move along
And when we fight I hope you use this song to get it right
My moms is gettin' jealous how I feel about her
And the fellas say I could deal without her
See baby I ain't playin' around
I don't need cupid dude could have aimed at the ground cause thats real, real
Just had to tell you how I feel
And the party tonights goin' crazy
But I'm just here with my baby
I love the way that she makes me, I'mma just kick wit' her and break trees

[Hook]
