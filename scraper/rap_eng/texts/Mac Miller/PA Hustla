They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Getting' honeys smoking piffs stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and ya'll mu'fuckas bustas
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Getting honies smoking piffs stackin cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and ya'll mu'fuckas bustas

[Verse 1]
Ok you're a goon, what's a goon with no profit?
Broke as fuck sittin with an empty wallet
One dude lemme come in boy I got this
Everybody jumpin' around like it's a mosh pit
I drop that hot shit, you drop nonsense
And my money long like the center for the rockets
I get that cronic, that cali weed roll a swisher pass to me
Smash a beat, work of art, masterpiece
Game on lock and key, nobody's stopping me
Got some haze and Patr√≥n, bout to pop a bean
Now I'm rollin' like a 16 wheeler, and my money fat like its 16th meal bra
Your favorite rapper's, favorite rapper, that's the game I'm after
Getting cheese like we play the packers cake and batter
So be careful for your hook to the IV, I be, chillin in the P to the I T

They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Getting' honies smoking piffs stackin cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and ya'll mu'fuckas bustas
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Getting honies smoking piffs stackin cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and ya'll mu'fuckas bustas

[Verse 2]
My swag official like a referee no one on the plane is stayin' fresh as me
Boy I'm dressin' clean, denim jeans sittin low on my waist, and haters get a cloud of smoke blown in they face
My fam beside me, fans behind me
Sorry ma but its money over punani
I'm super fresh, make your lady lose her breath
It's hard not to take a ralphie but I'll do my best
Rock your head and do your step, move it to the left
Where you can posted up in my Gucci vest
Boy I'm getting paid, then I'm getting laid
Don't tell the hoes at the party that I'm in 11th grade!
Ain't nobody out there fresh my age and you best believe
That's why I got 20 honies sittin next to me
Child celebrity, gotta be me
Cause my swag stayin' clean like a washing machine
Fuck y'all
