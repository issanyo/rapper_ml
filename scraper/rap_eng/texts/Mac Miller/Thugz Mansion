[Verse One: Lyrics by 2Pac Shakur]
Said a place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, I would've tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside of misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I've survived
Praying hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't got a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trickiness
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, where players go in past
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

[Hook:]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace love
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thugs mansion

Thugs mansion, oh, oh
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thugs mansion

[Verse Two:]
Sometimes I see the world for how messed up it really is
Tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
But then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm getting high to forget about the lows though
Get a paycheck spend it all on Polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothing but an average Joe, though
And now I'm dressing so expensive for no reason
Cold world we living in, it's below freezing
I got some fam who can't afford to cope
So I leave a little paper there before I go
I spend a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Make me wonder who I'm praying to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just hoping that you see
Remember love and remember me

[Hook]
