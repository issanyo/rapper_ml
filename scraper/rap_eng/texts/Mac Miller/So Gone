[Hook]
I'm so gone
Ayo I get so gone
I said I'm so gone

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ayo I'm so gone, somewhere in the clouds
The room is filled with smoke but the blunt still goin round
We blowin pounds, I'll admit I'm just a weed head
My mom say by age forty I'mma be dead
But I live free in a world that's make believe
To say the least, I be goin like I'm off the leash
I'm pretty chiefed, roll another four up please
Hit the crib, get it Jerm, havin him send me some heat
The beats I speak on, I'm spittin like my teeth gone
Off an L a couple hundred feet long
Cop it by the pound, smoke until the weed gone
That's when you'll find me going
I'm so gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Felling like I can't go on, on, on, on, on, on
This weed so bomb I've been high for so long, long

[Hook]
I'm so gone
Ayo I get so gone
I said I'm so gone

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And this purple got me paralyzed
The reddest pair of eyes
That you ever seen
Never wearin Visine
I ain't tryna hide it
See I'mma superhero, Mary Jane just my side kick
Yeah, something I can't live without, girl you got me lifted
Those who tell me not to smoke its really not your business
They say I'm so young and so gifted
But fuck it, more blunts gettin twisted
I love it, I'm so drunk, so piffied
Find me at the spot where no skunk omitted
Ya'll know this blueberry so pretty
I'll only come if Mary Jane can go with me
