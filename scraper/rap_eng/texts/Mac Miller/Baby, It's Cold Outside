[Verse 1]
[Ariana Grande]
I really can't stay

[Larry Lovestein]
But baby it's cold outside

[Ariana Grande]
I got to go away

[Larry Lovestein]
But baby it's cold outside

[Ariana Grande]
This evening has been

[Larry Lovestein]
Been hoping that you'd drop in

[Ariana Grande]
So very nice

[Larry Lovestein]
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

[Ariana Grande]
My mama will start to worry

[Larry Lovestein]
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

[Ariana Grande]
My daddy will be pacing the floor

[Larry Lovestein]
Listen to the fireplace roar

[Ariana Grande]
Really I better scurry

[Larry Lovestein]
Beautiful, please don't hurry

[Ariana Grande]
Maybe just half a drink more

[Larry Lovestein]
Put some records on while I pour

[Ariana Grande]
The neighbors might think

[Larry Lovestein]
Baby it's bad out there

[Ariana Grande]
Say, what's in this drink?

[Larry Lovestein]
No cabs to be had out there

[Ariana Grande]
I wish I knew how

[Larry Lovestein]
Your eyes are like star light

[Ariana Grande]
To break this spell

[Larry Lovestein]
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

[Ariana Grande]
I ought to say: "No, no, no, sir"

[Larry Lovestein]
Mind if I move in a bit closer?

[Ariana Grande]
At least I'm going to say I tried

[Larry Lovestein]
What's the sense of hurting my pride?

[Chorus]
[Ariana Grande]
I really can't stay

[Larry Lovestein]
Baby, don't hold out

[Both]
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2]
[Ariana Grande]
I simply must go

[Larry Lovestein]
Baby, it's cold outside

[Ariana Grande]
The answer is no

[Larry Lovestein]
Baby, it's cold outside

[Ariana Grande]
The welcome has been

[Larry Lovestein]
How lovely that you dropped in

[Ariana Grande]
So nice and warm

[Larry Lovestein]
Look out the window and see the storm

[Ariana Grande]
My sister will be suspicious

[Larry Lovestein]
Gosh, your lips look delicious

[Ariana Grande]
My brother will be there at the door

[Larry Lovestein]
Waves upon a tropical shore

[Ariana Grande]
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

[Larry Lovestein]
Gosh, your lips look delicious

[Ariana Grande]
Maybe just a cigarette more

[Larry Lovestein]
Never such a blizzard before

[Ariana Grande]
I got to get home

[Larry Lovestein]
But baby, you'll freeze out there

[Ariana Grande]
Say, lend me your coat

[Larry Lovestein]
It's up to your knees right there

[Ariana Grande]
You've really been grand

[Larry Lovestein]
I thrill when you touch my hand

[Ariana Grande]
But don't you see

[Larry Lovestein]
How can you do this thing to me?

[Ariana Grande]
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

[Larry Lovestein]
Think of my life long sorrow

[Ariana Grande]
At least there'll be plenty implied

[Larry Lovestein]
If you caught pneumonia and died

[Chorus]
[Ariana Grande]
I really can't stay

[Larry Lovestein]
Baby, don't hold out

[Both]
But baby, it's cold outside...
