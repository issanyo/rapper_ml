[Verse 1]
Welcome to the dark side of my bizarre mind
I'm trapped inside of this amusement park ride
There's an atom bomb inside of my hard drive
I'm holding the apocalypse
Let's take a ride and get lost in this metropolis
Just realized that I'm an idiot
Wearing my disguise, my real face is fucking hideous
My pretty bitch watching Insidious with her pussy out
Awww, Sookie Sookie now
Rapper terrorist, rarer than good parents is
Putting hard drugs inside of all your baby carriages
Arrogance, throwing cherry bombs where the sheriff lives
Just because that shit's hilarious
And I inherited the thirst for self-destruction and I'm scared of it
I wanna be buried with a novel and a chariot
I'm a bigger illusion than good marriages or what it means to be American
(Woah)

[Hook]
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo that was dancing at the strip show
I gotta stop thinking with my dick-hole (Yo)
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo that was dancing at the strip show
A genius still thinking with his dick bone

[Verse 2]
Out in Wichita, Kansas, smoking meth with all the locals
Asking them to teach me how to yodel
Suppose I'll die alone from an overdose of some sort
In a motel while some whore fucking running to the drug store
I hacked into the motherboard, argued on a public forum
Uploaded a virus to the network then unplugged the cord
The laws are not important
If you scared lock your door then
I always feel like a foreigner
Morphing into some sort of sorcerer
I'm Yuri's brother if it's Lord of War
What would I be normal for?
I'm going door to door shooting porno's with a good script
