Ay yo Jerm, Banger

[Hook X2]
Rdin' round, tryna get this money right
Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin' around

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm just foolin' around, comin' new with the sound
I give you music that pounds, start movin' the ground
I'm a wildfire, y'all just burnin' slow
Got that Midas touch with it how it turn to gold
You gotta earn your own chips, never lose focus
Bang it til your ears goin' deaf like Moses
I'm on vibrate, buzzin' all crazy
Haters gettin' mad cause I'm fuckin' all they ladies
I stay skeed, smoke until I can't see
Takin' pictures with the hater like say cheese
Yeah I'm kinda young, weavin' where the vinyl's spun
But no practice here so call me Iverson
But I'mma be ready when the finals come
Said I'mma be ready when my time'll come
Gimme brain get inside they mind
Go to sleep, wake up now it's rise and grind

(Oh, ay yo Jerm, tryin'a tell 'em man
Let's get it, what)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Alright, look at when I come around and spit that flow
3 in a row, no Tic-tac-toe, hit that Dro, get so blowed
Hold up and spit that slow, oo I'm high (who done jump)
Ya'll hatin', you gon' stop, I'm comin' to your block
Still hear my music knock
Gon' take this to the top, I want the top spot
Spittin' them pop rocks, the human talk box
I'm top notch and you ain't got a fan yet
Watch me blow they minds with some bars, call me Xanax
I ain't even goin' hard, told you my flow is sharp
And when the Dro is sparked, sittin' back Rosa Parks
Don't call me lazy, I ain't just some bum kid
But I can bust wigs with every single drum kit
I like to joke a lot, I'm....... I'm not
My moms is walkin' in the room "like are you smokin' pot?"
Blow the smoke out like yes I am
So can I mothafuckin' kick this? yes you can
