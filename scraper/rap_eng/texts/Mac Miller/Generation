[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
These.. Generations, combination of generations
Levitating through matrixes
Baby, heaven's waiting
I feel naked, consider the fact that hell is vacant
The temptation was just your imagination
Listen, we know the feeling like a nursery rhyme
Blood rushes to the head make a burgundy mind
News anchor, I channel Ron Burgundy's mind
Cut the lights, turn your church to a shrine
Now you blind, so
Fuck the cops if your daddy one, fuck ya pops
I hate the personality but girl I love the box
Something's off, they popping a penicillin
I'm illin', your paper thin as Sicilian crust
Warning civilians are aiming adhere, they killin' us
Still I must continue to venture into outer space
You got [my dick] inside your mouth tell me how it taste
I'm not, I'm just, I'm just saying...

[Hook: Jared Evans]
Cause we all meant for something
Even though we feel like we're nothing
Because it's our generation, oh
Our generation, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Our gene', our gene', our generation)

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Yo, fisherman buckets, double cups
I only lean on family and double on my dutch
Generation hope faith is tomorrow's trust
Land of milk and honey
All the boys found it inside a bus
Only lust for the feeling of large city's dust
I could pierce the night with a light
Bright as a delta's tusk
We either shine through it or not
Where your block
Whether east or west
We don't go stressing unless it's cops, shit
Justice ain't for us
I've come to that conclusion
Wildin' out in my mind
They lost in they illusions
Uh, dear Momma say, my Momma sigh
We die too young, she told me have fun
YOLO lie
She told me try, I had no time
Go for broke
Life deep, but unlike a reef I could stay afloat
Never drown, say something profound by the pound
We keep a lot of soul
Like Kenneth Cole walking through the town
My generation yes, my generation no
My generation ain't stressing
Burning that chemical
Higher pinnacle when I pen a flow of this magnitude
My third eye off the hour of all this on the news
In the battle they rattled to see a Black and Jew
Stand for the lives of all that died like me and you
We don't see color or class, we more powerful
Generation change, we rearranging they attitude

[Hook]
