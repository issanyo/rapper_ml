[Intro: Mac Miller]
This is my biography
It's really something that you gotta read
You all are weak words that make me fall asleep
Dime nots please can you drop the beat

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Now everybody can you clap your hands
When you hear us out the speakers be like "that's the jam"
And ask your mans if they'll please turn it up
And we can gather round the cypher while we burn a dutch
Words rush out my mouth when it's my turn to bust
Try and challenge the battler you herbs get crushed
Cause you'll be smoked right away like the herb I puff
Steel City put your hand up the Burgh is us
Smoking purple stuff hold it down for the pot heads
Cross the cat he'll fill your body up with hot lead
I'm not saying what's not said before
Taking words out the book and I'm making metaphors
Cause I (Cause I)

[Hook: Mac Miller]
I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it's what they take from me what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you

I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it really ain't funny what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
We all tryna be rich man it's all for the cash
Whether you slinging trees or moving 8 balls in the bag
Now from this jail cell where you calling your dad
Saying you dropping out of class and you following rap
So don't worry 'bout the cops dad I hate the feds
I'mma make it pops try not to hang your head
Cause I spit so sick that I should stay in bed
I'mma keep making rap till I'm laying dead
I'm collecting dollars, and quarters, and nickels, and dimes
My hat turned upside down while I'm kicking a rhyme
I'm sitting reclined you claim real but you all sound fake
All for the money, fam, all for the pound cake
And when I get rich I won't forget about my family
I'll be spreading money all throughout the whole family tree
The words I speak with herbs and trees about the currency
I gotta make money before the dollar bill murder me

[Hook: Mac Miller]
I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it's what they take from me what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you

I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it really ain't funny what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you
