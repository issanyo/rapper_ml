2 records hard to find, so I thought I'd start this rhyme witha couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind. I've had all the dimes and all are fine but now I need the one to call her mine
Ya know that girl that everybody wants but can't have fat ass, nice ass, high class
I get the last laugh now cause she under my arm, Lay down hittin' L lookin' up at the stars

I tell her listen I ain't gonna do you wrong, forget what you hearin' on my songs
My always is gone i'ma be real with ya
Recently I've been lookin' at the big picture
Perfectly framed see the way i'm workin' the game
Take my name i'ma share all my fortune and fame
Beauty or brains, girl you all the above
True player for real, But now i'm fallin' in love

Chorus;
I'm bout to get high with my lady, (x6)

You used to the bullshit the dudes put you through it
Cupid never shot up such a nuisence see with me my love is with the music
But baby you can be the next to it, my boys say i'm stupid i need to move along
And when we fight I hope you use this song to get it right
My moms is gettin' jealous how I feel about her, and the fellas say i could deal without her
See baby I ain't playin' around I don't need cupid dude could have aimed at the ground cause that's real, real. Just had to tell you how I feel, and the party tonights goin' crazy, but i'm just here with my baby
I love the way that she makes me, i'ma just gonna kick it with her and break tree's

I'm bout to get high with my lady(x6)
