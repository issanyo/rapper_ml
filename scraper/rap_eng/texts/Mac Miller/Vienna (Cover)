[Verse]
Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But if you so smart, tell me why is you still so afraid ?
Where's the fire, what's to hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
So much to do, so many hours in a day (Hey)
You know when the truth is told
You can get what you want
You can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get half way through
When will you realize?
Vienna waits for you

Slow down, doin' fine
You can be everything you want to be before your time
Know it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
Too bad, it's the life you lead
So ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Got your passion, got your pride
Don't you know that only fools are satisfied
Dream on, don't imagine they'll all come true
When will you realize?
Vienna waits for you
Slow down, crazy child
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two
