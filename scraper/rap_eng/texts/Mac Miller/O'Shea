All this talk you got, we don't believe you

Got a lot niggas I ride for you
Tell me why would I lie for
We gon' knock down like dry wall
Gotta be ready when the time come
Pull up in the [?] like [?]
You can prolly catch me on your Tevo
Bad bitch bow down like Tebow
We working so we all gon' eat ho

Real deal holy field nigga
Mm-mm-mm tired of showing these niggas
Ain't no way you are controlling these niggas
And I'ma keep spitting til my dough is getting bigger
You know I had to win the election
How you host a party, you ain't even got a section (What?)
I'ma keep drinking man, she gon' keep working
And them bitches gon' keep twerking cause she loving my [?]
I'ma put it down for my side
Feds stay listening, I gotta thank God
Keep on running, make sure my shoes tied
They say I ain't killing then you know them niggas lie
One phone call and my niggas bring the pressure
And that goon shit, you know that be forever
Hella bills stacked up on my dresser
But I'ma work I'ma get it, no stressing

I had to take it down, take it down
They say that we been everywhere, everywhere
Ever since I started getting cash flow
Now they say that I'm a young asshole
They say that I'm a young asshole
Now they say that I'm a young asshole
Ever since I started getting cash flow
Now they say that I'm a young asshole

We ain't got a lot of time, please make it worth it
We ain't got a lot of time, please make it worth it
Gotta stay up on your grind, just make it worth it
Gotta stay up on your grind, just make it worth it
We ain't got a lot of time, please make it worth it
We ain't got a lot of time, please make it worth it
Gotta stay up on your grind, just make it worth it
Gotta stay up on your grind, please make it worth it

Picture perfect in the field like a mercenary
I'm like Jay meets the K, that's legendary
I got niggas that's with me, they ain't ever scary
And I don't wanna fall in love, fuck February
Like heaters on heaters, that's hot
And we cooking up, that's a crock pot
Watch yourself, keep your mind on stealth
And you gotta get right or get left
And that's real

I had to take it down, take it down
They say that we been everywhere, everywhere
Ever since I started getting cash flow
Now they say that I'm a young asshole
They say that I'm a young asshole
Now they say that I'm a young asshole
Ever since I started getting cash flow
Now they say that I'm a young asshole
