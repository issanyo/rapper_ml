[Intro]
Yeah, ha ha ha ha ha
I think- I think I see where you're goin' with this one E

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that
Still kick raps that cause impact, so whereâ€™s my kids at?
These muthafuckas hatin', soundin' funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the assholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it's wild
6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you man
If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand

[Hook]
There's a party on 5th Ave., hit me if you tryna go
I can be there in like 20
I'mma honk it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose
There's a party on 5th Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, what's the difference 'tween me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than Beetlejuice
Don't count on the sheep to snooze, I'm fucked up off weed and booze
I party then sleep 'til noon, what every day people do
So haters see me improve, just give me a week or two
See when you read the news, my bitches all sleepin' nude
My rhyme talent is why my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gon' put it aside
This that old school shit soundin' good in the ride
And fuck ten, I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old school shit soundin' good in the ride
So let's head out to the party, I'll drive

[Hook]
There's a party on 5th Ave., hit me if you tryna go
I can be there in like 20
I'mma honk it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose
There's a party on 5th Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do

[Bridge]
What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gonna do that now
My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
My light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
'Cause there's a party on 5th ave

[Hook]
There's a party on 5th Ave., hit me if you tryna go
I can be there in like 20
I'mma honk it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose
There's a party on 5th Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do
