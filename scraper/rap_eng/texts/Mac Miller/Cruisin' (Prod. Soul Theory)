So quit ya back talk i ain't haven it boyy

Light a swisher now im gone
When my minds on, 5's on, laced up, headed out the time bomb
Get your life right size truck whit a white light
Triple x tee and a fresh pair of white nikes
I wright like nobody youve seen
Cause my weed is purple and my money is green
See im hungry for cream with my fitted on lean
If you wanna talk shit, ima shit on your teaam
I rock my fitted to the side
Roll around the city blowing piff up in the sky
When we..

Chorus:

VERSE 3:
The kid raps like lasers, sharp like rasors
Rollin up my weed and some ?gos see a vegas? (yuup)
Fuck a cop tryna chase me with tasers
Im runnin out my crib and im dippin through the neighbors, garden
High homie marvin the marshin
I wipe my ass with you soft rappers like charmin
Yall hungry im starvin, you talkin shit, oh i beg your pardon
Specifics is never gimics
I rip it just how i live it
You wanna it ill go and get, im kickin it so escuisit
The wickedest mothafucka on the block i live at
Shit talk on hip hop im pealing your wig back, yuup
So where the crib at, where the party at
Where them butt naked hoes and the bacardi at
Cause when i start to rap, its gameova
And i ain't spend a single one sober
When we..

Chorus:
CRUISE like we ain't got nothing to loose
Hit tha speech throught tha speakers hope its comen in smooth
When we CRUISE see i ain't got nothing to loose
So ima roll around tha city smoken blunts with mah crew
When we CRUISE x2
