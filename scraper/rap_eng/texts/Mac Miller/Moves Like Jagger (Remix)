[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
There's something about my ego, tell her back up, Tim Tebow
Got Tivo up in the ride, I'm leanin' back and my seat low
You need hoes, I just sex em, bend the ass like Beckham
Undress em, respect em, just for the night, then after that I forget them
Neglected, I'm sorry girl, turn the house into a party world
Probably gonna get herself played, Atari
No time for tears, if you cryin' call Maury
Got girls by the army, feelin' kinda horny
Love it when Iâ€™m on a Benny Blanc beat
Talk cheap, but I spend big
Cause I

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
Then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away, make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a sh*t
And it goes like this

[Hook: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger

[Verse 3: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's hard
When you feel like you're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That I've got the key
So get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this

[Hook: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the mooooooves like jagger
