When we reminisce, when we reminisce, when we reminisce

[Hook]
Let the smoke signals guide you back home like Indians
And lend the spliff and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin me down from the heat on the streets
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn a free and kick flows I see
And think back to chicks who love my magic stick

[John Records]
When you look back Malcolm
Never forget, never regret the outcome
Never tear or spend a year askin' how come
Lookin for love, cause you found some
Never let a dime infiltrate your mind
She has no right questionin' McCormick design
Never quest for beef, always record your own rhymes
Never bothered the time on this planet earth
Take a nap take a snap but when you take it for granted it hurts
Try to be thrifty so manage your work
Expect the best but plan for the worst
Never take advice from those who never question themselves
But your mental health should never be managed by doubt
MM I'm your MC Mentor
There for sure when things go south
I'm out and route back the beat back to nookie
She says she loves me what she want half a cookie
Never contemplate life when you high as a giraffe's pussy

[Mac Miller]
Matt wreck the rest is history
Cause him and me, well we hit the weed in between the misery
We spit for free, we had dreams of gettin' cream
But things don't always hold exactly how they seem
The big kids they talkin' bout they big guns
But I just chill, lay back here to kick drums
Boom kak boom baboom kak
Around and back now I'm gettin' of track
And I saw rap, as a way to get away
From everybody tellin' me the day is not my day
My day, my week, my month my year
My tears held back confronted by my fears
This endless intelligence my mind can expand
As high as I am, chill I'll be fine with a gram
Cause I'll be bumpin' through the speaker box, tryna bust a flow
At first an outcast lookin' for the love below
Don't mistake my terminology for philosophy
Screamin' till I get what I want, like a toddler be
Urban mythology, the words of the prophecy
The prodigy see deep inside your mind like psychology
Taught to be verbal passin' purple in the circle lifuyufyuyfke we pass a word
Save it of mind but you ask so serve
Attack then words right happens fast send your ass on swerve
Got a question ask it first
Pass the purp and mash the verse
