[Intro]
I'm coming back
Hey yeah, I'm comin'
I'm coming back
Hey yeah, I'm comin'

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It's a cold world baby, but I'm a cold nigga
Frostbite tryna take a chew of how I slither
My presence give 'em chills, like an Antarctica winter
And I'm banging Inglewood till I'm getting caught with a splinter
I'm having artists for dinner
So many fall apart when I spark it's hard to remember
It's always hard remembering pain is part of the riddle
Somewhere between my art and the dark, I'm parked in the middle
I knew my part since was little
I knew my heart was official
I knew that in my heart that that boy was part of a bigger plan
I know my momma not coming up short of rent again
Cause I put this rap shit down and go and sin again
Fuck all the daps and pounds I'm on my shit again
All that bad mouthing just running up my adrenaline
And yeah, it's safe to say we made a way
From getting slouched on
And Doms'll be that nigga from now on, you dig me?

[Hook 1: Mac Miller]
Nothing to do, except smoke and drive
Twenty in your pocket, million on your mind
And someone had the drink, someone had the drug
Someone had bitches on the line, that's what it was
And I don't regret a single night I came home fucked up
Ain't sorry for a single time I made hoes cry
Money was a thing I didn't make too much of
Tell me "Hurry up", I'ma take my time

[Hook 2: Domo Genesis]
I feel like I'm designed for this
I don't know how all my timing is
But I know I want that time again
To give this all I got

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
All my clouds got silver linings
Amazing how I keep my peace alive through all this violence
It's a war outside my window, it's like all I hear is sirens
But it's something 'bout the melody, I'm drifting into science
I was born hateful, looking at this world ugly
Way at the bottom, got me questioning if God love me
You know my steez dog, real niggas ride gully
Lost a couple soldiers, got me smokey with my eyes runny
My heart cold like I said in the first verse
And I'm tryna eat, you niggas eyein' dessert first
And somewhere between the hoes and money, I got hurt
The worst, I swear to God this life a gift and a curse
My path was chosen way before I existed, the misfit
The voices in my head never tell me wrong so I listen
Either make a way or collision
I ain't here to play nigga, I'm on a mission

[Hook 1: Mac Miller]
Nothing to do, except smoke and drive
Twenty in your pocket, million on your mind
And someone had the drink, someone had the drug
Someone had bitches on the line, that's what it was
And I don't regret a single night I came home fucked up
Ain't sorry for a single time I made hoes cry
Money was a thing I didn't make too much of
Tell me "Hurry up", I'ma take my time
La-la-la-la
