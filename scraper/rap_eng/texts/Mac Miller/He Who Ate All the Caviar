[Intro]
Fuck you mean, “I’m drunk,” mo'fugga?
You crazy?
Shit, you didn’t say that a hour ago!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I made more than this money, don't label me as no business
Came up in this country, started out in the Civic
Pray for rain til' it's muddy, praying more than just sunday
Eating good, I'm still hungry, left no evidence on these dishes
Watching movies, no sound, smoking weed in this dope house
And my bitch coked out, smoke loud when she go down
Damn, this the life, riding on Gary Fisher bikes
Know the kid is nice, piece of cake, you won't get a slice
Any time of night, hide your kids, hide your wife
Find a sip, bottle Sprite, high as shit, blind a bitch, dynamite
Bitch, tell me what your problems like
(I wanna know, for real, I just wanna know)
Just got the pipe, we could talk all night, sike

[Hook 1]
I get money, I fuck hoes
I wear really nice clothes, I
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (all of it!)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (bitch!)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfucking rich (I'm so motherfucking rich!)

[Hook 2]
I get money, I fuck hoes
I wear really nice clothes, I (you're a bitch!)
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (cash, motherfucker)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (slut-ass hoes)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfucking rich (I'm so motherfucking rich!)

[Verse 2]
Why the fuck did I start this? Now, I'm spitting retarded
That bassline, made that, that's the hardest
Regardless, I could get this yardage
Cause I'm a quarterback, bitch, gimme my quarter back
Change, vending machine, make it rain
Buying out the whole bottom floor, buying out the whole bottom drawer
Buying out the whole bottom row
There's ice in my mouth right now, lemme chew that shit, bitch, I'm cold
Yeah, I'm cold, all you rappers, you old
Don't go to award shows cause they smell like nursing homes
Yeah, never wanna get nominated
Yeah, I do, I'm just pissed I haven't got nominated
