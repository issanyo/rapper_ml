[Verse 1]
A-yo! I'm ready for whatever this world brings to me
I'm ready for the night, I'm ready for tomorrow
Whatever's after that you feel me?, lets get it

[Hook]

We stay fly new clothes on smoking on that drake till im so far gone

Baby girl you fly but we got away lets take a drive I need to get away
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

[Verse 1]

Ain't a damn thing change I'm happy to get away leavin shawty's in the morning she's grabbing on me to stay
I'm ready for the next day, just text me, she said I hit it out the park like fenway
Aye its just one nights work after stay up late and sleeping in my shirt
Girl I gotta leave now I need to get to work im a young heart breaker believe me its a curse
But hey I stay focused cause the money comes first, but my real life situations I throw em in the verse

You should know my name don't forget me bout to take over the game I'm ready
