[Intro: LilStevie]
Yeah
People Lie
Things Change
People Cheat
Friends Bail
There’s Always Gone Be
Those People Who Would Kill To See You Fail
But Me, Ha
Nah, I Ain't Gona Fail
You Ain't Gotta Like Me
Just Like My Mother Fu**in' Music
Haha,  Damn Righhh'
[Hook: LilStevie]
This Radicle Flow
Inside I Compose
My Poems Is To Potent
Out Of Control, Bad To The Bone
My Heart It Is So Frozen
Cold Dose, Of This Love, Is Left Me All Broken
[Verse 1: LilStevie]
Helpless When I’m Reciting Notes
Where’s The Hope
I Feel Like I’m Pulling The End Of The Rope
When I Needed You Most, You Seemed To Be Ghost
I’m Leaven Beaten, No Reason For Me To Believe
That You Needed Me In your Life,  I’m Leaking My feelings
While Fitting These Pieces Together To Write
I’m Too Sick To My Stomach, From Cussing And Fighting
Depression, Confession, I’m Done With This Mess
Get Cleaned Up With A Kleenex, LilStevie Is The Best
White Boy gone Stupid, I Go Dumb, I’m A Nuisances
Show No love, I Keep Refusing, Stupid Humans
Ruined Music, I’m Influenced To Renew It
2Pac Done Told me To Do It, Rest In Peace To The Legends
Please Don’t Ask Me No Questions, I’ll Leave You Guessin'
[Hook: LilStevie]
This Radicle Flow
Inside I Compose
My Poems Is To Potent
Out Of Control, Bad To The Bone
My Heart It Is So Frozen
I Pledge Of Allegiance To The Flag
Of This Ungrateful Nation
Head Of The State, Towards The Government
Making It Hard To Face, Its Own Mistakes
I’m Spittin' It Raw, They All Relate
To What I Make....
[Verse 2: LilStevie]
Liven American Dream Where These Kids Can’t Breath
And The Sh*t Gets Deep, When They Parents Leave
Addicted To Drugs, And Given Em Up
Just Like My Pops Did Me
Rest In Peace To My Boy Chad, He Flyin' High In the Sky
I’m Gone Ride Or Die Till I Shine, Roll It Up
And Let The Smoke Rise, Raise Ya Lighters High
I’m gone Kill It When I Rhyme
[Break]
Bring It Back..
Bring It Back..
Bring It Back..
My Feelings Ghost
Bring It back..
[Verse 3: LilStevie]
These Tats All On My Arm, Bring It Back, Cause Im The Bomb
I’m Blowin' Up On That Pu**y These Raps Is Gone Take Me Far
This Life Is A Given, You Got to Go Out And Get It
Ill Paint A Picture So Vivid
But It’s Okay, Just Roll A Jay
Any Woman Lackin' Love Is Entitled To Get Away
I Love These Woman No Need To Treat Em Like Sh*t
Cause My D*ck Gone Need Some Company Later Pumpkin
Haha

[Outro: LilStevie]
Not Easily Beaten, I’m eatin' These Rappers

LilStevie
"And That’s My Million Dollar Dream"
