[Chorus]
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you trying to feel the vibe, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 1]
The wheels stay spinning on the Civic, boy I'm always on the move
When you grinding all the time there's a lot of shit to do
That's why I got Q, cause he keep me on the routine
I be too skeed, trying to kick it like Bruce Lee
Clean shoes, boy new feet and I'm never in the car with only two seats
I got a whip full of people, all fresh, call 'em 10 Deep
Motherfucker we the future like next week
Young people don't see you as an equal
They just see you as deceitful, trying to send you back to preschool
You only getting one shot, no redo
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue
Bitch, who the fuck you think you playing with?
I'm Justin Bieber meeting Jadakiss
Here to take what's theirs, treat 'em all like Taylor Swift
Leave 'em in a daze, all like "What day is it?"
Yeah, the boy got class, no Cambridge
Fresher than your man girl, but whiter than a plate of grits
They keep wanting more, I'm their favorite dish
It's me motherfucker, I ain't changing shit

[Chorus]
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you trying to feel the vibe, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 2]
I got a brand new phone, rocking brand new clothes
Leaving every single party with a brand new hoe
Yeah, I've done a little traveling, circling the globe
Always keep it moving, inertia on these hoes
Boy I'm an asshole, girls call him a douchebag
This some old school shit but no boom bap
This ain't new swag, it's the same old me
The younging get respect from the games OGs
The cameras flashing when we passing, so we stay low key
Go to Mexico, to party where the pesos be
On a turnpike bitch and your tank on E
With my head out the window screaming "Get like me"
Hoe you should know the way I roll
Take a couple shots and superman these hoes
You ain't nothing with your wack rap
Used to be the class clown, now I get the last laugh

[Chorus]
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you trying to feel the vibe, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
