[Verse 1: Choo Jackson]
I say rest in peace to my old hoes so I can say what's up to my new ones
But I don't be chasing hoes so that's why I don't choose though
I'd rather just go lose one before I say that I use them
Torn apart, broken heart, she blowing up, I defuse 'em
I don't worry about extra guys, we have sex for that exercise
And then she buzz like pesticide, my ho flow is so mesmerize
She say we dying, say I'm lying, she say one thing, then she crying
But I can't do shit but keep on flying, cause my dreams too big and they call me Giants
She know that I'm next to gold, God damn I hate x and o's
First she love you, then she hate you, make you shoot yourself like Plaxico
When she look, I swear she gold, it's like I'm watching my favorite show
I try to tell her in person, but it's the only way that I can let her know

[Hook: Mac Miller]
And all I need is mirrors when she tell me it'll be okay
I just wish that everybody could see how it looks to me
We fell so far in love I'm thinking that's where we gonna stay
You make it go away when you look at me, so look at me

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I heard she read about it in books, heard about it on the radio
She's seen it all in movies, if you believe in that then you crazy though
What's going on in my head? My friends is worried about that
Either talk to you, have the option to disappear when I come back
What if I gave all this up? Would you let me be so in love?
I've been taking all of my problems and drowning them in that cup
Just to find that feeling, girl I need that healing
Need a little bit of fantasy, that Dali, we surrealing
The real world is so frightening, we're trying to catch the right thing
If you scared to look cause of what you find, you overthink, you could fall behind
Fall and I'm getting money now, situation's so funny now
These ex girls want to hunt me down, their old friends want to come around
But still I'm taking my time, go somewhere and just breathe
We can run away forever, cause I'm just trying to be free
Maybe if I do good, karma got my back
I put us all on the map, so give me love for all that

[Hook: Mac Miller]
And all I need is mirrors when she tell me it'll be okay
I just wish that everybody could see how it looks to me
We fell so far in love I'm thinking that's where we gonna stay
You make it go away when you look at me, so look at me

[Outro: Choo Jackson]
And we rolling like a train, whoa, we gotta hurry
We getting everything
