Once a day I rise

Once a day I fall asleep with you

Once a day I try, but I can’t find a single word

I wonder what they know

I wonder if they ever even cared at all

I wonder, do they see their own reflection in the mirror and look away

Everybody is rushing

Why aren’t we taking our time?

Every now and again, baby, I get high

Don’t ask me what i think

It never really mattered what i had to say

I just keep waiting for another open door to come out soon

Don’t keep it all in your head the only place that you know nobody ever will see

You’re running low on the thread

No tears, just keeping it real

And i think you got it now

Everybody keeps rushing

Why aren’t we taking our time?

Every now and again, baby, i get high

And everybody needs something

When they stuck on your mind

But every now and again they just getting by

Once a day I rise

Once a day I fall asleep with you

Once a day I try, but I can’t find a single word
