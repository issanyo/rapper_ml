[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Every day a different car ride
A ticket on the plane
All of the sudden all these people dont be treating me the same
Treating hoes like a bombvoyya
See them tomorrow
The second that you wake up baby im be gone
I got all the time
I got so much to do
I'm not losing my mind out here fuckin' with you
Tryin' to travel overseas
Blowin' smoke in costa rica
Beat gettin' walked on
The sole is on my sneakers
Keep up we after the tippy no ballerina
Rockin show they say eureka, they start to do the macarena
Chiddy I see ya, we turn them to believers
Smoke and get high it all
I'm trying to do my thing
Figure out who the jokers around and who the kings
Maybe one day, fuck it never say never
For the bars it my pleasure this the best day ever motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chiddy Bang]
We live a fast life
No one told us about the speed limit
We in the UK steady smoking weed in it
This my douquati flow
Kill tracks I body those
We player stay in vegas at the bellagio
Im gone, adios
See what you made me do
Just go and kill some shit crazy too
The flow is evil nigga chuckies bride
Pride never tucked aside
When I was just a superstar in my mothers eyes
What changed the brother skies
A slight forecast
If I kill these verses I can get some more cash
The expensive shit we someday could afford that
Im on the plane and they probably couldn't board that
I like the way you brought me down and it brought me up
Its early morning but I'm steaming nigga, coffee cup
Yeah just know I'm holding a prize
Before you know it I'm fired why won't you open your eyes?

[Chorus]
