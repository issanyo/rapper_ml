In your old man voice
Yeah, a one two, a one two
Four one two, four one two
Four one two, four one two
Four one two, four one two
Uh uh nothin' but rhymes its quite simple

Hey its what I create to eliminate the hate
Illuminate the night in the lightning
Ufo sightings leave em unidentified
Steady I be getting high
You ain't got no herbal Im'a lend you mine
Its Doctor Octogon call him young phenomenon
I leave these rappers starving like its Ramadan
You are the wackest my style holographic
Had to put my city on the map shit
If you a fat kid go get active
If you a bad bitch then be a actress
Rap ease carnage, my family ain't the partridge
Whore tricks flawless like trapeze artists
Take my life and put it in a photo album
How much money do I got? I don't know who's countin'
Fake mouthafucka's round me I could do without them
You keepin' it a hundred I could use a thousand
Im comin' now, call a truce
I got a lot, but not to lose
I'm the shit makin hits call me Doctor Luke
And prescribing you a vibe for that awful mood
Why you sad all the time?
Jump off a roof
While I'm kicking it with Q-tip and Posdnous
Tryna put me down well that's futile woo shell
Supernatural message got you spooked out
Believe in God but don't believe religion
Saying its the truth but never really listened
Thats another conversation though
Walking on the pavement home, find a way to go
Maybe one not taken, word to Robert Frost
Blowin' out steam but its all exhaust
We comin' for your dollars better call the cops
You want a war? We got a nuclear holocaust
Yo E how many bars is that?
Is it enough to give these haters all heart attacks?
I been writin on the paper
Gave me carpal tunnel
Couple billion people are they all gon' love you?
Hell no, hell no
I be grindin' though rain sleet hail snow
Sticking to my word like its Velcro
On some shell toes
What else yo
Dope shit, go crazy
Kinda like the Internet over Hov's baby
My girl tell me "Mac you a weirdo"
I guarantee that baby be a super hero
This ain't nothin but some rhymes from my mind
That been stuck inside since the
Beginning of time
Chemical romance, slow dance with no pants
If I got my eyes on her, player, you got no chance
This some simple shit I'm sure they feel
I'm just trying to explore whats real
Child of the blues, never liked school
Been miseducated so word to Lauryn Hill
Music is my outlet walking through the Polo store
In the studio wondering what I go home for
In my own world when I close the door
To the booth, young and searching for the truth
Like that, like that, like that...

And a little bit of this and a little bit of that
I just spit a rhyme tell me that I kick a rap
Damn, if you got some time, you can sit down
Listen to me now, pass the flow around
Hey, this some cypher shit
I know you like that shit
Freestylin' in the air, go and write that shit
I don't write that bitch, I got ill flows
Yeah, I'm ill, yo
And this is real, yo
Mac Miller gon' kill those
Flows
Bouncing up and down, yo-yos
Head to your toes
In the... in the paint throwing balls
Yeah, throwing balls in the paint
That's what basketball players do
I don't think anyone was gonna listen this for
But we should keep it in
Bee-yatch!
