[Intro:]
Just so Pittsburgh, man

[Hook:]
So how does it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel?
Now it's real
So can you tell me how you feel?
Can you tell me how it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel? So can you tell me how's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?

[Verse:]
Baby what you doing tonight
We can watch the world get ruined tonight
Living this life, got you flexing feeling cooler than ice, let it melt
As we follow all this stupid advice
And I don't usually like to be this honest with you
I must have lost a picture, gimme a box of swishers, room full of obnoxious bitches
Why you lying to me?
Describe your ladies, that Mercedes all kinds of roomy
And when the time's is gloomy hit me up
I can make you feel like the perfect girl you wish you was
Giving you that feeling like when Chrismas come
I just take all of my problems throw 'em in a blunt
Light 'em up and watch em float away
Watch em float, I can take you anywhere you wanna go

Can you dream?

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
I'm back on these rap songs
Feeling that's never gonna last long
Got a shortcut baby I'll pass on it
Might throw your ass on it
Pass the time, as for my alibi
Trynna tell you I need that
Just relax

[Verse 2:]
Put that money in my motherfucking hand
Drinking in the pool, goddamn
Ain't part of the plan, like a car in a van
I'm rolling, I'm feeling good, I'm golden my man
So let me do my dance
Cause motherfucker this my jam
This my motherfucking jam
How many times you got to let them opportunities pass you by?
I used to be a pretty passive guy
Since before I was a goddamn mastermind
[?], I came up
Didn't have the time to see these lame fucks
You can't rush that greatness
That mansion where my maid lives
Like wow

[Hook:]
