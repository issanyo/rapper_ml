[Intro]
Clarity...
Clarity...

[Verse 1]
Clarity—figure all this out, I ain't gona take a charity
Marry me, wish everyone could shake
And play the tambourine perfect
I know I love you I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss, I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive
Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin' towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activeless
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for
I hope you found what you lookin' for

[Hook]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'mma be waiting for that, I'mma be waiting for that

[Verse 2]
Misery—you represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany
Disconnect from everybody
Who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet is where my mind is so I light another cigarette
To calm me down
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around, chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream, that's so cliché
But I can't tell you what it means to me

[Hook]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'mma be waiting for that, I'mma be waiting for that

[Outro]
And so it is to the printing press...
To the recorder of man's deeds—the keeper of his conscience
—the courier of his news—that we look for strength and assistance—confident that with your help, man will be what he was born to be—free and independent...
