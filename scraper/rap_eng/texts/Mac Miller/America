[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? Bet I steal her
Shout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
They don't know I come from the illest
City on the map, we don't know how to act, ahh!
Realest young rappin go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal
Veggies

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6
Rise to the top, the topics change
The Glocks in the Stock Exchange
Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane
You can't stop this reign, don't name drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters so I've been afloat
No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes
Sun got shine, now they say he shady but he never dippin' though
Still facing L's, you would think a nigga's wins was low
What you think I'm in this for?
Won't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope
End the flow or behind bars droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources now he in the store

[Outro: Sample]
People are just uptight because the kids are having fun and they didn't have the same freedom because they didn't take it, they just followed the lines laid down by their parents
