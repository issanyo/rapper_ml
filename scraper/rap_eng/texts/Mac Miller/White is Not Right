[Intro]
White white white white white is not right
Dollamd stop tryna mess with me
Dont mess with me
And you just got your fight

[Hook]
First things first you're all lil bitches
Dont mess with me i dont talk to no snitches
Ill end your career and make you shed a tear

[Verse 2]
You can't drive a camaro
Just bow down to the pharaoh
Banged your bitch
With the camo
Your not fly your not fresh
Just stop and hit refresh
Boi wid yo lame ass bars
Stop talking 'bout cars
And remember this as a memoir

[Hook]
First things first you're all lil bitches
Dont mess with me i dont talk to no snitches
Ill end your career and make you shed a tear

[Verse 3]
Rollback what you just made
Dont mess with me
You just got played
Ill cross you out like d wade
Stay under my shade
Stay under my shade
Fuck off and peep this fade

[Verse 4]
Your name is the definition
Of a sexual disease
Seymour fucks you when your on your fucking knees
"oh daddy please i want your cream pie with the cheese"
You made a mistake being in that videotape
What the fuck is a motherfucking soundscape
18 minutes and 9 seconds
Go cum on seymours back in 9 milliseconds
Do you want beef
I thought you were vegan
Heres a list of what youll be eating
Vegetables, grains and my nuts
Ill cut you up like cold motherfucking cuts

[Hook x2]
First things first you're all lil bitches
Dont mess with me i dont talk to no snitches
Ill end your career and make you shed a tear
