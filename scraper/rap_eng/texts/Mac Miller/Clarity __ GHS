[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Figure all this out, I ain't gona take a charity
Marry me, wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
Perfect, I know I love you I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss, I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive
Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin' towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activeless
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for, I hope you found what you lookin' for

[Hook]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
Ima be waitin' for that (x2)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Misery, you represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere, your epiphany
Disconnect, from everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet, is where my mind is so I light another cigarette
To calm me down, so calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around, chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream, that's so cliche but I can't tell you what it means to me

[Hook]

[Outro]
And so it is to the printing press
To the recorder of man's deeds
The keeper of his conscience
The courier of his news
That we look for strength and assistance
Confident that with your help
Man will be what he was born to be - free and independent
