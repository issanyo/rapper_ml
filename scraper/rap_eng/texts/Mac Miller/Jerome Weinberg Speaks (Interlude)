Good afternoon, Class of 2010
My name is Jerome Weinberg
I'm running for Class President this year, because I believe I can bring positive things to the student body
My opponent, as you might have already heard, is Mac Miller
Now... I know, hes the rapper who gets all the ladies, and hes the that popular guy
But do you really want somebody running your school that smokes that much marijuana?
Is that safe for your environment here at school?
I've been in the bathroom and seen him lighting those... Dutch masters in the stalls
And that is not cool
So vote for me and not for weed
Thank you
Again Jerome Weinberg
