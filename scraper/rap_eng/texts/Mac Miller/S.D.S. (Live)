[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
Said, close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams
Yes, Iâ€™m in awe, this jigsaw, puzzles not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing concrete
I Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
So, shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
Said, I'm no god, I don't think that I'm a human, though cause I'm so odd
People sellin' drugs cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Okay, let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan

[Bridge]
Do something please
Said, somebody do something please
Said, said, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody do something please, said somebody do something please!
Yeah, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, yeah..

[Verse 2]
Like I was majored in whiskey flavouring
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off, leave it dangling
FlyLo's still tryna put me on to Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
Said, I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
Hell na'
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook
We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm down for this movement, trying not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist tryna consume the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in an igloo
I hear the fish biting nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
So, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown, that's yeah poop, poop

[Bridge]
Somebody do something
Somebody do something
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, do something please, somebody do something please!
Somebody do something, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody do something please
Said, somebody do something please, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody do something

[Outro]
Somebody do something please
Somebody do something please
Said, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody do something please
Somebody do something please
