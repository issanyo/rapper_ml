Cookin Soul on the Beats

[Verse 1 : Mac Miller]
She looking like a modern day queen
Style so mean, see the booty through the jeans
Got a little brother that she always gotta baby sit
She knows the games, every type of chick you playing with
Ain’t really talking bout relationships
She just wanna hang out and watch her favorite flick
She make a funny face when you take a pic
That girl that gonna tell you how lame you is
She likes the Roots crew,Erykah Badu
A Tribe Called Quest and a little bit of Snoop
I’m playing something smooth just to put her in the mood
She my lady color baby cause she hate to turn blue
Laughing at the girls who wearing nothing when they go out
When we at her house she …and tender well
Now that’s what I’m talking about
If there’s a time, it’s gonna be now

[Hook]
Cause girl you’re a genius, hey, I said girl you’re a genius
Hey, I said girl you’re a genius, I really mean this
Girl you’re a genius, hey, I said girl you’re a genius
Hey, I said girl you’re a genius, hey, I said girl you’re a genius
I really mean this, girl you’re a genius

[Verse 2: MC Melodee]
No, I’m not a genius, this is what my life is
Living to the max, I’m like that, I like this
Gotta be on top of my game, I’m shameless
Enough to go hard, throwing game …
…to cook through a good, I’ll be the main dish
Sex on the plate, you don’t like that booty weightless
Standing out with the boys…
…rock a party, I’m a little famous
…to laugh a lot, I know you won’t say this
You feeling my pleasure, we share, the same kiss
…university, ain’t it no greatness
Soon my music is my art, dj play this
I left my doggy … cause I left a man chainless
Dressing for…at times…
Know I ain’t perfect, my records ain’t stainless
But way beyond the average, not many can beat this

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
She is straight A student with an after school job
I just wanna hit her up and never take the day off
Walk around the city maybe go around the world
Different face, place, take you everywhere, you my girl
She explore like Dora drive to California
Then fly to Israel cuz she wants to read the Torah
She a foreigner, company, I’m enjoying her
Invited to the late night, trying to smoke a joint with her
Now we chilling, feeling right
She superman kryptonite
You ain’t gonna let me hit the night
How you feeling like me and you getting nices
You ain’t gonna let me hit tonight

[Hook]
