[Intro]
Yeah
Let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let
Let, let, let, let, let, let
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Let, let, let, let, let's get started
Nobody wanna be themselves, everyone's an artist
Walk around with a target on my head, take your best shot
Watch me do my thing, try and shoot me from the press box
We keep on going 'til they press stop
Errr Errr I'm breaking records so rewind
I left you scared, say a prayer, put it on the Holy Bible
Better hold a microphone like how a soldier hold a rifle
It’s the Young Mac, I been there and done that
Went away and come back with a mother fucking vengeance
I'm collecting, every sentence is impressive, learning lessons from the legends
Dreams is  nightmares, so I fall asleep, holding a weapon
Some people do this for attention
You can miss me with the bullshit, I get busy with this music
Tell 'em shut-up or get butt fucked, with a broom stick
Been touring before you were born and I made the rules, bitch
Thou shalt not hold thy tongue
Don't quit, no going home until you done
Like train tracks or breaking glass, you can hear me coming
Motherfuckers better take off running

[Chorus]
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin’ like they know me, little homie, I’m a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I’m a Speed Racer (pick up the pipe!)
I’m a Speed Racer (pick up the pipe!)
I’m a Speed Racer (pick up the pipe!)
Pick up the pace!

[Verse 2]
Well it's a speed race, cross-over knee breaker
Green maker, creator, hotter than the lines on the equator
Take your life and remake ya, all for the green paper
Write it all down but never got the time for eraser
It ain't nothing but a mother fucking song though
Rubbing on some big ol' titties, I'm playing bongos
I put my long pole in the wrong hole
She say "Get up out my stomach," I'm like, "Bitch, you know you love it"
I'm disgusted mind start to wonder about this world we in
Matta fact, I'm on the phone I'm fighting with my girl again!
Shit..I never been normal as a youngin
I was in black clothes, they close the portal on me
Talking shit but you folding more than origami
I'm fucking awesome, better run along and call your mommy
Cause we dropping bombs more than atom do
Still we posted up on Penn Avenue

[Chorus]
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin’ like they know me, little homie I’m a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I’m a Speed Racer (pick up the pipe!)
I’m a Speed Racer (pick up the pipe!)
I’m a Speed Racer (pick up the pipe!)
Pick up the pace!
