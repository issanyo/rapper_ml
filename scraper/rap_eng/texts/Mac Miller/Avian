[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Look, concoction of hamentashens, launching a bottle rocket (okay)
Done being nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits (woah)
I'm not your conscience, you nuts? Almonds and HÃ¤agen-Dazs
Auction off your grandfather's watch from the Holocaust
I'm iconic, naked walking in the garden and bird watching
Alarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope (pope)
Puffing that white smoke (smoke), get faded and play the maestro
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe (probably velvet)
Sneaky bitch stole my Rollie last night, yo
I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though (yeah)
Walking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close up, we all just molecules and isotopes (that's very deep)
What psychic don't know the future?
To live life, you kids might just close your computer (go get some exercise)
The street lights might blind you though (blind you though)
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope

[Chorus]
There's a bird, in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Let the money pile, I'll be running wild
Life's a mothafuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep
Literally, I do this in my sleep

[Verse 2]
It's an impression of Bueller
Yeah, yeah, a little TV money (okay), dollars for sense of humor(yeah)
Scholar but my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor
Some cold brews in the cooler (have one)
Coming through in the wood grain PT Cruiser, stunting
I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom (restroom)
Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes (coughs)
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude (yeah)
And I was raised better, say God bless you (God bless you)
I'm Kenny Powers, you're more of a Debbie Downer
My bitch taking off her trousers every time I get around her
I'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers
Not into this conversation, I've been in my head for hours
I'm out

[Chorus]
There's a bird, in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Let the money pile, I'll be running wild
Life's a mothafuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep
Literally, I do this in my sleep
