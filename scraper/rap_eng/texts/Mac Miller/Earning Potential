[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Yeah, they said I need to change my name
Who the fuck you think you are, Brand Nubian
Now they only playing the famous, saying that they knew me then
I walk through the flood, see the direction that I'm moving in
Step into the blood, my soul is red like Louis Vuittons
Know I can choose to be the deepest rapper
Or write punchlines back to after the cheapest laughter that'll reach the masses
But now they wishing that they peeked it faster, ain't wanna admit it
But they had to concede it, so I'm a conceited bastard
The flow is coveted love it your rose colored glasses
Many degrees to this rapping, but I completed the masters
Try to describe it and you run out of superlatives
This the real what you hear on the radio alternative
They guessing what I'm making, but they ask to make conservate
Cause boy you see how pure it is
I earned what they said I wouldn't, and got it the way they said I couldn't
Fuck that, we're kicking down the door to get a foot in
Fuck that, we're kicking down the door to get a foot in
Fuck that, we're kicking down the door to get a foot in
To get a foot in, yeah, to get a foot in, to get a foot in

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
They told me I ain't got a chance to be a rapper
Might as well just hit the books
And everytime I went to shows I had these people give me looks
Now they watchin while I'm doing it, they pussy smell the uterus
You haters keep on hating, it ain't nothing cause I'm used to it
See me as a young'n just eager to get a chance
Writing in the lab with no one believed I could make a jam
But now I got my fans in the stands with their hands up
They worry 'bout the morals that I follow and what I stand by
They say I'm nothing new, I ain't got shit to say
Sit back and I'll change the world, you're in a different age
I burst your bubble, your struggle, double the trouble
And dissin with no rebuttle from me laughing from another country
It ain't about tons of money, I'm here to open minds
They close the door on me so I guess I'll open mine
