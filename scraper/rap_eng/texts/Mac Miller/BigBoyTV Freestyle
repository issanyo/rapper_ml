[Intro]
If only you guys knew what just happened in here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you turn the beat up a little bit, yeah
Turn my headphones up
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well who is he? I be ze meanest, putting Jesus pieces on a fetus
The Lord taketh, then he keepeth one of many masterpieces
I'm rolling up the weed and feasting on gravidas
Your bitch a junkie, always sucking on somebody's penis
Ooh, I'm eating General Tso's chicken off the fine china
I put my dick inside your bitch and say the "Our Father"
Young Moses part water
Head wraps car bomber
Death trap dark slider
Jump on motherfucker, got ya, once I dropped ya
Who's hot? I moonwalk the jungle gym
Do not try to stop cause you not gon' fuck with him
I'm rumbling with countrymen, do it for the USA
First you get the money, then the fame, then you get paid
Ale boombaye, come with superhuman strength
All this for the music's sake, but I'm getting stupid paid
Get ahead or lose a leg
Never did the funeral fake
To be great you await
Everybody let's eat cake
D-dumbass

[Interlude]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
I'm sipping liquor 'til my liver pop
And playing tennis with cinder blocks, I'm in the spot
Chilling with some nympho THOTs, landed on the Planet Rock
Man of God, hammerhead shark in human camoflauge
Duck down I'm on, understand the planet's strong
Lead singer came with Keith Richards, brought the band along
I'm pretty Zen lady, headspin is 1080
They say that I went crazy but love me when the check cleared
Red beard, seen into the future, fear the end near
Bitch I want it all, I will not give you not a cent here
This is not pretend, I'm trying to pay some pricy rent here
It's no words, selling Goldberg and you gon' get speared
Do the most, I'm the host and the special guest here
It's a fucking party started, everybody get weird
Take your pants off, move your body, you can dance around
I got you shitting in your pants, you wearing Pampers now
Mean flow, hitting free throws, shoot 'em granny style
Came a long way from rocking hand-me-downs, fr-fr-fresh
I said the world is just a big gazebo, so baby let's get married in it

[Interlude]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 3]
Morning Mr. McCormick, Mr. Should've-Been-Aborted
Mr. Mighty-Morphin'-Sperm, the Michael Jordan's Nike fortune
Money make me feel important like some type of vital organ
Rich people give poor advice, never could afford it
Walk into the jewelry store
Spend all my money, fuck did I do this for?
Pussy on my mustache
Never clean it up cause I'm a dumbass

[Outro]
