[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yo
PA to BK
Skyzoo
Easy Mac
S.K.Y.Z.O.O
I love money, I love money
You take a buck from me, you doug funny
I said I love money, I love money
You take a buck from me, better duck dummy

Im with my man Skyzoo, is the class clown of his high school
Dround you in typhoons, hittin' you with rhymes too
Haters keeps they eyes glued, pound if you my dude
We stay high like Einstein's IQ
And ya'll muther fuckas know where I'm comin from
Chewin' cats up, like a little peice of bubble gum
Tryin double sum's, hustle, wanna let my money run
I ain't even battling dude, I'm having fun with it
Jokes make him feel wrong in his own skin
Sippin gin from a bin that's makin' my dome spin
And your the type that'd try to take from your own kin
Feel it close on your toes, hangin from clothes pins
I'm spittin blades, God damn it, my tooth hurts
I'm out feelin' with a bunch of cancerous tumors
Yup, music's my baby, I ain't gonna, lose her
So I stay with the radio, like Cuba Gooding Junior

[Hook]
Who you think could bother me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat
My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn
The pen game insane
Who you think could bother me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat
My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn
The pen game insane

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
I'm one drink away from everything you meant to say
Like I think he on the rise of what the kings made
And in the blink of an eye I'm on the kings page
But no album, this is all for the mixtapes
In a different lane, no signs of road rage, ain't no body over here to rage quit, so no gains
No sleep, no retreat, no surrender, no apologies from me
I'm the pen of the penners
I mean what I speak, so if I given you a sentence
Then it bez what it bez, nothing hit on the agenda
You leave it up to me, and you can divy up the team
Put your pride in end and I'm dismember your limbers
The harder the city, the starting point guard, that can play up to the fall
So the parts is all gone, no room on the bench
And I got a no trade clause, so I'm here long haul no switchin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Look, I rip mics to piece cook em or eat em raw
I was bustin freestyles before I could read it all
MCs just call me the monster in their mind that haunt them all the time
And they thought if they could ryhm they could make the situation a lil diffrent then the present
See, I fucked this track, worried thought I got her pregnant
I'm haulin ass, yall is whack, taking out the garbage trash
Duckin from these sharks n crabs, giving MCs heart attacks
Its yo boy Mac, damn Im great, and you guessed, no love like a man with aids
I feel you dancin gays with some hand grenades, drop bombs, remove your hands and legs
And I pray dear Lord please give me the strenghth not put these little stakes in their taint till they faint
Suffocating, now you choke you a broke MC, now ain't nothing to do but smoke your weed like...

[Hook]
