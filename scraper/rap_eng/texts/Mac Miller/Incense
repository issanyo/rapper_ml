[Verse 1: Phil Ade]
Yeah, sometimes I let my mind take me on a trip
Away from theses fake niggas and these dimes trynna hit
Looking for a nigga with a little recognition
Still fighting for my start, I'm looking for my ignition
My attention is on a place where my mom don't work
And the fact that me and dad don't get along don't hurt
And the niggas I been with that dabbling hood shit
Ain't gotta carry 9's like a Rondo shirt
Been trynna be Mr. Right, and I ain't it
My ex got hip to it, she know I ain't shit
Arguing over texts, a part of me want her back
Wanna give her the time, I figure its time to relax
Focus, get my head right, shine get my headlights
Up so long, I'm forgetting what a bed like
When it come to bars, I got prisms, yeah I shed light
Dreams, I got visions, man I'm driven fuck a red light

[Hook: Mac Miller]
One time for ya mind, two times for ya soul
This some late-night rhyming, its so cold after 4
I don't know why I'm just wide awake
Laying back and my mind will race
I let it burn like incense
Hey, I let it burn like incense
Hey, I let it burn like
I let it burn like
I let it burn like incense
Tell me baby, do you think you feel alright?
Cause I think I can go all night
I got the lights dimmed real low
Let the incense burn slow
Tell me baby, do you think you feel alright?
Cause I think I can go all night
I got the lights dimmed real low
Let the incense burn slow

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ay yo, late night rhyming
Always great timing
This another world I tend to always put my mind in
I'm in, places they ain't heard of yet
Well I wonder what I deserve cause for sure I'm blessed
My words is no threat, I'm just living this life
Do it, do it again 'til I'm getting it right
I know a girl and she always try and hit me at night
Cause she need to hear me say that everything is alright
So I do, me I'm chilling everything cool
And my crew, living good cause I be singing these tunes
On the move, never stay in one place for long
Have an empire fucking with a Genghis Khan
Trynna make a million dollars off of T-shirts
I'll be fishing from the moon, hope my DreamsWork
Let it burn like incense
Lay back when it get tense, see the world through nothing but a 6th sense
Impressed

[Hook: Mac Miller]

[Verse 3: Phil Ade]
Sometimes I need time alone
My phone, I keep silent on
This when your man need a Tylenol
Before I get violent on a nigga
Got me yelling fuck him every time I'm on this wine or on this liquor
Searching my mind trying to find different approaches
To get where that dough is, cause a nigga never owned shit
Except this 'dro I'm blowing out the back door a Mac show
Niggas quick to speak but they can act slow
On that note, tell D-lists make a move
A fan need to eat, ain't nothing sweet except the room
If shorty asks right, something wrong is what we do
And if I'm sleeping with her, we ain't sleeping until noon
Zoom zoom, smell the exhaust fumes
Stepping on the gas of life, I'm gonna be lost soon
That's what Mama said
So much drama in my head, let the incense burn until its dead
One
