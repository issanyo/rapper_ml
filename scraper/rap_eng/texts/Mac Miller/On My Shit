[Intro]

[Hook]
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I’ve been gettin’ money, what the fuck have you been up to?
Up to, up to, what the fuck have you been up to?
Livin’ out my dreams, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I’ve been gettin’ money, what the fuck have you been up to?
Up to, up to, what the fuck have you been up to?
Livin’ out my dreams, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I’ve been gettin’ money, what the fuck have you been up to?
Up to, up to, what the fuck have you been up to?
Livin’ out my dreams, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?

[Verse 1]
What I’m up to? Workin’ hard - anybody askin’, I’m on my job
Late-night lab then a late-night cab – 365 boy, no days off
Everybody know that the boy got sweet flow
Then my money get a couple more zeros
We go ‘til the weed run out
Look at people in my past like “see me now?”
On it, supersonic, my words gonna hook ‘em on phonics
I got it, that’s why I talk shit, bitch, I’m fillin’ up my wallet quick
If they ever wanna come and try and copy me
It’s mine, you can look at the apostrophe
You whine, but then you carving out apologies
Goin’ at Mac Miller, now you follow me
Set the bar high, take drugs at the car drive
It’s alright, a false eye - in it for the distance, par five
Yeah, I’m gifted, aren't I?
Ride by, pump my shit - if you hatin’, suck my dick
I’mma do me, homie, watch it get me fuckin’ rich

I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I’ve been gettin’ money, what the fuck have you been up to?
Up to, up to, what the fuck have you been up to?
Livin’ out my dreams, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I’ve been gettin’ money, what the fuck have you been up to?
Up to, up to, what the fuck have you been up to?
Livin’ out my dreams, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?

[Verse 2]
Ain’t nobody hit a dope flow like me
The boy can speed it up like OMG
Don’t claim to be tough, you can hate on me, but
I’mma still get money, homie, let me be
Job for you, career for me
Took you lifetimes, took a couple years for me
Now, I got all the people all hearin’ me
They may not like it, but they listening
So fresh, so clean – hoes show ass to impress my team
I’m a MVP, you second string, that’s why I got your girl text messaging
Tryna make enough money for a pinky ring
Make money, make money, it’s a simple thing
Grind on, grind on, money what my mind on
It’s gonna be my seat, called fives on
You ain’t on what I’m on - just chillin’ here, tryna get my shine on
Now the fans want a pic, no Nikon
Hung over in the morning, where's the night gone?
Ride by, pump my shit - if you hatin’, suck my dick
I’mma do me, homie, watch it get me fuckin’ rich
