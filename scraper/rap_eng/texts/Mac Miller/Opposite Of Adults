[Intro]
Cali Kush, it's fantastic
(I'm too high to think of something to say in the intro)
(I'll think of something later)

[Hook x2]
Hey, don't control yourself
This your life, you own it, said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is this moment so who's coming?

[Verse 1]
I swear to god, this a dream come true
Everybody wonder what we gon' do
Drink in the red cup, pre-rolled 10 blunts
When I go to sleep I don't think I'mma get up
Stay in bed till the afternoon, aye, cause you know what us rappers do
Get high, get drunk, then find some butt
Girl, I don't wanna chase after you
Lets live it up, live it up
Party like we ain't got shit to do
I don't give a fuck, give a fuck
Nothin' but cuttin' up with the crew
My parents outta' town so we gon' put it down
We takin' shots, who can go another round?

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Hey , I wake and shit
First thing I'mma do is take a hit
Tonight's gonna be great, lets get a little drink
I'm trying to get wasted bitch
It's gonna be something to remember , too bad we won't , won't
And it's gonna get hot in here so, don't bring your coat , coat
Take your clothes off , we gonna get crazy
She's sorta fine , just borderline , but tonight she's gon be my lady
My parents out of town so we gonS put it down
We takin shots , who can go another round ?
