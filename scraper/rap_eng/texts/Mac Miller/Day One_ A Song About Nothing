[Intro]
I made this beat
Uh
Yeah
Oh, and I—and then I now wrote to it too
So it go like this
It’s like real late and Jerm’s tryna get home
So I’ma try and one take a ma'fuckin' song
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse]
When you first start rappin' everybody curious
Then you make it happen and everybody furious
Young kid courteous, don’t know what the worry is
Wanna be buried in my Pittsburgh Jersey, bitch
Nobody certain if you gonna make it
Life give you some hurt and then you gonna hate it
Sometimes it leave you cold and it leave you naked
But one thing for certain I’ma leave it faded
Still young but I wonder when my time gon' be up
When my time come I’ma smile and peace up
Shorty sipping forties, hangin' out by the tree stump
So Jerm and me started making hits and it occurred to me
You didn't have to be like thirty-three to start earning cheese
With uncertainty, in it for eternity
A lot of style, little money and some purple weed
Me and my queen, my girl, not Freddy Mercury
‘Cause first you work for free, anything to get noticed
Stayin' focused ’cause bullshittin' was hopeless
So treat yourself like a damn professional
Your first music check, damn incredible
Every day feel like the best day ever
Until every day feel like the best day ever
And you used to them days, kinda become a routine
You have a bad one, fuck up a good dream
You realize that you’ll probably be away when
All the people die and you never get to say
Everything you always wanted to but never got the chance to
Start to weigh you down, what can a man do?
I could’ve stayed around, probably cancelled
A couple of shows, spent the last two
Years being dumb on the road, I guess
Haven’t got to spend too much in the home
Time is what you make it, but player don’t be mistaken
All of your shit get taken
Broken, beaten oasis, still I wouldn’t trade it
Now it's five o’clock, but my mind won’t stop
I’ve been thinkin' ’bout life, pourin' syrup and pop
Smokin' cigarettes like I’m really tryna die
Try to keep my head on my shoulders but my mind in the sky
I’m that moment when a gazelle and a lion collide
I'm a burned down building with a diamond inside
Yup, independent platinum, wishing well passing
Jewel'ry out the ice age, bitch outta Maxim
I be writin' this shit and just relaxin’
Let the time start passin'

[Outro]
Yeah, so I just made this ma'fuckin' beat
And decided I was gonna rap on it too
It’s like
Yup
Took my chains off to rap this song
Ou, almost dropped my big chain *laughs*
Who'd ever thought that I’d be standing in a booth with a big chain?
Syke, I’m joking, I don’t got another verse
All right, peace
