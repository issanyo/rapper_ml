[Hook: Mac Miller]
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it’s a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

[Verse 1: Mac miller]
I got my cup filled, bitches all around me on some bachelor shit
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it
Globe trotter, ho hopper, superstar asterik
People always wonder so they ask us who we are
Rolling up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar
Wanna be on top and tryna to get there by tomorrow
See the money, bitches, bubbly, designer clothes, foreign cars
But I ain’t never gonna change
Different city everyday
You hear these people scream my name
They think I’m underage
They don’t know shit about the game
Till I’m drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne
Living life like it’s my job, and I don’t ever take a day off
Shit ain’t been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some “I don’t give a fuck” shit
Still with my homies I came up with so celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous

[Hook]
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it’s a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bitches of every nationality get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin’ noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch you can’t breathe
Somewhere where it’s sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do never made a plan B
Can’t we, get it how we live
Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls, comin’ all dressed up and they takin’ off their clothes
We know your man an ameteur so come party with some pros
You need something new, I know your life is gettin’ old
We ain’t gettin’ younger so tonight's the night to go
So, crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like you cash right
It’s the fast life, don’t worry baby we ain’t here to slow it down
Tonight we goin’ crazy and tomorra’ you can hold me down

[Hook]
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up
Warn the neighbors it’s a party, so go tell everybody
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
