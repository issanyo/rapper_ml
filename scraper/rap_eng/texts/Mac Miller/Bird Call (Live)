[Intro: Mac Miller & Tay Walker]
Alright, you ready?
Bouta, yo Tay, I'm bouta mothafuckin' rap
Check these raps out baby
You wanna see some raps
Do that shit
Okay, (laughs hysterically)
Oh my goodness
Alright let's go

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay, chilling for an hour, smoking weed, watching Worldstar
Benz in the garage, probably gotta drive your girl car
You ain't a rapper if my homies never heard y'all
I just spit a punchline, smile then they bird call
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball
I'm dealing with some shit that really don't concern y'all
Punch a fan if you get a fucking word wrong
I'm wavy, giving you some shit that you can surf on
Finding me a bitch I can swerve on
Frank Thomas homie, 'bout to put the hurt on
Your bitch a night light in bed, she turned on
Roll some weed, tell her burn one

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay, I used to give a fuck about success
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress
Hope she down for buttsex, it will be a cum fest
FUCK! Sorry that's some shit I had to confess
Crazy-ass bitch doing 911 threats
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit, gold on my outfit
Surrounded by this pussy, I'mma drown in it
Got that wet pack, bitch come and give me that
You know we want to know where them titties at
Got 'em gassed, they be asking what I'm cooking with
Have your little brother ask your moms what a pussy is?
Corruption, stunting at the function
Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream & Onion, woo
Pay attention, you'll learn something
Roll that weed up, burn one

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

[Outro: Mac Miller & Crowd]
Put your motherfuckin hands up!
Everybody put your hands up!
Everybody put your hands up!
Put your motherfuckin hands up!
Okay okay, when I say Saint you say Louis!

Say hell yeah!
