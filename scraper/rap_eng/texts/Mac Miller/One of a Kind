[Intro]
Ain't nothing else like me

[Hook]
I ain't nothing like you
So what is going on?
There must be something wrong
You'll love me when I'm gone
I'mma keep on doing me
Cause you don't even matter
No, you just an actor
And I ain't just a rapper
I'm one of a kind (x3)

[Verse 1]
Here's a prototype that I know you like right
Headed to the light on over night flight
Never in your life you going see another me
I tend to catch the eye like a pair of double d's
I'm here, not the same, I'm a pioneer
Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spear
Grind to see success, God damn it's clear
The time shine like a chandelier
I'm going through this cake
Spitting about what you relate
Never could you duplicate
Any of the music made
Getting super paid
Looking at your future star
They recognize me when I pass them in a moving car
Always worried about finding out who you are
You know somebody, you got look into his heart
Yo mind so blind
I'm ahead of my time
Cause I'm one of a kind

[Hook]
I ain't nothing like you
So what is going on?
There must be something wrong
You'll love me when I'm gone
I'mma keep on doing me
Cause you don't even matter
No, you just an actor
And I ain't just a rapper
I'm one of a kind (x2)

[Verse 2]
And my pops said
Young man you ain't ready for the world ahead
Way too much marijuana
Always having girls in the bed
You going realize that life ain't a party
Fuck around, you going end up starving
Fuck it, I stay fly, live free, die hard
No Bruce Willis, this the whole nine yard
Thought that I can rhyme bars
Go and buy cars, you gotta grind hard once the sun rise start
In my heart great things in my future
Cause broke rappers, shit, that's just a rumor
I see these diamond chains, mansion in the videos
They must got silly dough
Do they really though?
Or is it all just a scam for your eyes?
Or are you in disguise
God damn I can't decide
All the words here come from a mind guy
Got nothing to hide boy
I'm one of a kind

[Bridge]
Walking through this world, I just take a look around
Ain't nobody here like me
Don't nobody got my style
People say I'm different, I assure you that's okay
Cause I'm way past tomorrow
And you stuck in today!

[Hook]
I ain't nothing like you
So what is going on?
There must be something wrong
You'll love me when I'm gone
I'mma keep on doing me
Cause you don't even matter
No, you just an actor
And I ain't just a rapper
I'm one of a kind (x3)
