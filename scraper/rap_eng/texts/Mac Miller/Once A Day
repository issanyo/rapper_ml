Once a day I Rise
Once a day I fall asleep with you
Once a day I try, but I can't find a single word

I wonder what they know
I wonder if they ever even cared at all
I wonder do they see their own reflection in the mirror and look away

Everybody is rushing
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again baby I get high

Don't ask me what I think
Never really mattered what I had to say
Just keep waiting for another open door to come by soon
Don't keep it all in your head
The only place that you know nobody ever will see
Running low on regret
No tears is keeping you wet
I think you've got it now

Everybody keep rushing
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again baby I get high

Everybody means something
When they're stuck on your mind
But every now and again they're just getting by

Once a day I rise
Once a day I fall asleep with you
Once a day I try, but I can't find a single word
