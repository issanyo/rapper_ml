Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
See I'm one of a kind
There's a brain behind
All these different wonderful rhymes
Some people's livin in the past
Cuz they runnin from time
Seems like so long since big punisher died
Hope he see me when I'm lookin up from under the sky
I'mma tell you how it is cuz I got nothin to hide
And soul theory makes the beats that'll bump in the ride
This criminal lifestyle that I'm jumpin inside
A mastermind, superb with both sides of his brain
Roll me up into a swisher, start flyin away
But ash my soul, rub the L on the side of the tray
Cuz its hard looking up, like the sky when it rains
Smokin strains that levitate me like David Blaine
I'm a player and you hatin on my game
Say my name, cuz this here's my destiny child
Now that all the stress is off of my chest I can rest for a while

Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high
Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind

And I shall not hold my tongue
So i'mma speak till I fold my gums
I was told to run
Cuz every day is a colder one
I wake up not knowing if I'm old or young
I can't find my place so I lay upon these beats
Covering my pain with layers of melodic sheets
Mother earth's a bitch so when kingdom come
We gonna bring em some till thy will be done
And still to come is when I'm finally driven to insanity
By my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me
My knees are shaken, see I'm not able to stand
Cuz they label a man by his paper in hand
Sittin in a dark alley with some paper and pens
Writin, just thinkin when this day's gonna end
What can you say to a man who can't look at himself
When the image in the mirror keeps on yellin for help

Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high
Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind

Hip hop's child, you feel me do the touchin
Spittin got me smitten, no excuses for the lovin
I'm tryina get it written but I'm comin up with nothin
A couple words in each line filled with somethin somethin somethins
And to me, hip hop ain't got a criminal past
Its just explosions of sound as these syllables clash
Briain on critical mass
Fuck political trash
These politicians speakin, but its comin out they ass
Talkin bout "school is cool" and "drugs for thugs"
Tryina push me down the path, but I shall not budge
Cuz, i've been thinkin and I think I have a hunch
Who hand the mic to get enough
While me and music makin love
And my community, ain't all about who I choose to be
This life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities
This figurative language that I'm speakin so fluently
Look back like a photo album seein who I used to be
Playin piano while I'm strummin guitar
Can't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin to mars
Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car
And not everybody hatin, but enough for you all

Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high
Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind
