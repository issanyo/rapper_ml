[Intro]
"You're a hard man to reach, Willie Dynamite!...I wanna rap"
"Go right ahead.."

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
The girls ask me for that Willie D that's how I know they feelin' me
It's simple see, the pimpin' be what got these bitches clipped to me
We maybe at the game, I guarantee you we in different seats
I seen you in the nosebleeds, but where I'm at that isn't cheap
In the Benz, in a Jeep, make a million in a week
Takin' off her clothes 'fore I begin to speak like gimme cheek
Spin to London, been to France, go there if you get the chance
Been to Amsterdam, hit the club, hell no I didn't dance
Rolled around a little, smoked the weed, seen the red lights
Ain't fuck a prostitute but the head nice, get right
From here on to the next life, relax and sip that Red Stripe
The way I spend this money you would think I had an ex-wife
Bitches love the lead pipe, the Burgh word to Ken Rice
New place every day, what I would give to just have 10 nights
Yeah right, bout to drop an album, hope to blow your mind
Tryna reach a level where no music is put over mine

[Hook]
Uh, the girls ask me for that willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?
Uh, the girls ask me for that willie D
Uh, the girls ask me for that willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
It's young Macintosh, tell you bout that sabotage
Travellin' through Germany, word to David Hasselhoff
Back up off me, kill em softly, bitches like to fuck em doggy
Probably off some molly got me turnin' into polygons
On and on, DJ's puttin' on my song
People say I talk too long, killin' every single track the God is on
They cheerin' with their pom-poms, buyin' what I got on
Straight gold, find me fuckin' Silver with my Long John
Tom Tom, direct me to that money please
Square sponge, fuckin' dumb, yeah your grades is under C
And I know in God we trust, but how much do they trust in me?
Enough to be a fuckin' beast on beats, yeah, shit is so disgustingly
Amazin', bitches out the playpen
You fuckin' hand askin' "how much money can I fit into this rubberband?"
Hustlin', throw your ass right inside a rubbish can
Excuse my french, that's just how I talk if I was Russell Brand
Know that I'm the fuckin' man, play my shit for three days
"All I make is hits, call me T-Pain!"
Sicker than if she gave me AIDS, plus some teeth decay
Then she stole my condom, try to auction it on Ebay
Talk a little shit man, probably thought he dissed me
Bitch please, I just ate out Monica Lewinsky
Yeah, I taught her bout some slaughter, had her cryin' about her father
Then I busted in her face while she told me it's an honor
Bob O'Connor, we just politicin', finger-lickin' on my chicken
Got a way with words, words, words, word to Charles Dickens
I wrote this on the shitter usin' toilet-paper
Put your head inside the water, enjoy the flavor

Yeah bitch!
Nah Jerm, don't cut me off man!
Fuck you!
