[Intro: Mac Miller]
So much for one take man
Alright look

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Life crazy now, when did this happen
I'll probably make your favorite rapper wanna quit rappin'
Bin Laden had me dissapear, kid snatchin'
I know you sleepin' on me though and that's a kidnappin'
Collaboration is bringing you fascination
I'm captivatin' my cadence and leading my generation
To the forefront, coming through, fuck it if the door shut
Girl put the team right on her back, poor slut
But wait a second, not disrespecting the women
I love 'em, I wanna hug 'em
They mad I'm pushing their buttons
She ugly, look like her cousin
So I ain't givin' her nothin'
End of discussion, only the tensional sexual lovin'
My girl, come by the dozen, but the ain't what make me cooler
Got a eyepatch on me, I'm slick like I'm Rick the Ruler
So, this a crazy flow, let me slow it down
In here with Maseo, I'm giving y'all the dopest style
Think you tough huh? Oh you a solider now?
I had these gangsters in here tryin' to get the [?] down
Piss a motherfucker off is what's incredible
Most Dope Army, I'm the motherfucking general

[Hook: Mac Miller]
On the grind, sick of working a nine to five
Everybody say I look like I'm kinda high
Fuck it, you bring the soul and I'm gon' bring the funk
I need y'all to but your hands up
Fucked up, but I promise I'm fine to drive
I just came in here to tell you I'm alive
Fuck it, you bring the soul and I'm gon' bring the funk
I need y'all to but your hands up

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ayo, pussy can't hold me, nor can it control me
Punch you in the face like I'm Sugar Shane Moseley
Rap boxer, ya I'm Math Hoffa
In between a field of dreams, word to Kevin Costner
Who you know that's iller than Mac? Riddle me that
Still hungry for success, here to give you the scraps
Talking all that shit, get you kicked in the ass
Chardonnay, if I may, I'll be sipping my glass
I hold the mic, slap you with my left hand
Tonight's the night, motherfucker, word to Redman
Punchlines that will make 'em say "Oh!"
Ill so long, you'd think I caught the flu
Got simplified, sicker rhymes
Upside down, sixty-nine, twisted mind
Farty kid in class who had to sit behind
Bet your dime, pretty fly, cruise right out of District 9
Pulling all the honeys, every time I go to kick a rhyme
Little guy, Marvin Wayne, bitches tell me all the same
Life is what I call a game to into the Hall of Fame
Fuck you, it's Christmas though
So you can kiss my fuckin' ass by the mistletoe

[Hook: Mac Miller]

[Outro: Mac Miller]
I said put you, put you, put yo' hands up
Ya, in the spot, put yo' hands up
If you, think it's hot, put yo' hands up
If you, down to rock, put yo' hands up
Ya, I don't make shit like this one man
I just wanted to rap a little bit
Because that's what I do motherfucker!
