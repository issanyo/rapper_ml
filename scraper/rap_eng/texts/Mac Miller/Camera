[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert & Post Malone]
Ayy, ayy, ayy (ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Ayy, ayy (oh)
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
She want to be just like daddy
So you know I had to slam her
In the kitchen, fuck your pans up
When I'm done, she clean them pans up
She think the trap is romantic
She said my style doing damage
In the room, private dancer
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She want to do me on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She want to do me on camera
In the room, private dancer
She just want to fuck on camera

[Verse 1: FKi 1st]
Oh shit, I think she planned this
This ain't no candid
She lick it, licking my dick
She treat a nigga like candy
I'm coolin', su-super coolin'
She started dancing
She told me, "Look in the camera
Boy you so handsome"
She told me to go harder way she can handle it, we gon' see
Just see what she can do with a motherfucking selfie stick
We had all kind of angles, two views
​iPad on the dresser and a phone in the hand
POV, you might see
If we let that leak, but she gon' blame me
Now we showing off for the camera, she screaming harder
I beat it from the back while she looking for her charger
I can't let it die, I gotta get this
I had to put it on panorama then take a flick
We don't need no filters, keep it basic
Her body is the canvas and I paint it
If that shit come out, we know we made it
$49.99 just to stream it

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
She want to be just like daddy
So you know I had to slam her
In the kitchen, fuck your pans up
When I'm done, she clean them pans up
She think the trap is romantic
She said my style doing damage
In the room, private dancer
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She want to do me on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She want to do me on camera
In the room, private dancer
She just want to fuck on camera

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Good girl but a freak on the low
Let me eat that pussy slow, baby
Seeing how deep I can go
Your bitch scream make her go crazy, yeah
I'ma go in like I'm tryna give your ass a baby
Start from the bottom then make my way to the top, girl you so tasty
This is sincerity, what is your fantasy? I want to make it come true
I'm addicted, girl you got me lifted, I love everything that you do
I'll talk to you with ahh’s and ooh’s and fuck you like a prostitute
I love the way your body move on me, on me
She want to do me on camera
She love the paparazzi
I play a little music, she a dancer
Have you been a bad girl? Are you naughty? Yeah
You have not felt anything like this feeling, I want to give you
I'm going to film you, the pleasure continue
I want to get in you, girl

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
She want to be just like daddy
So you know I had to slam her
In the kitchen, fuck your pans up
When I'm done, she clean them pans up
She think the trap is romantic
She said my style doing damage
In the room private dancer
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She want to do me on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She just want to fuck on camera
She want to do me on camera
Dancer
She just want to fuck on camera

[Verse 3: Post Malone]
She said she love me in Spanish
After that, she call me daddy
She's fucking anyway, it don't matter
Put the camera on the dresser
She fuck me like she want a Emmy
Fuck me like she stating a fact
She ride me ten speed like a jet ski
I always record 'cause she let me
No 1080p, I film it like I'm Scorsese
Touching herself on a T, when in public she thinking of me
I fall into the pussy 'til my death
I might just fuck her on a RED Cam
I'ma borrow that shit from my friend
She only want to fuck if it's in high-def
She know she loco, I give her a lot then un poco
Give me brain, Mojo-Jojo
She saving me Todo
Throw it back like she Romo
'Bout to stand like I'm Hulk Hog
Lose her mind like Memento
Movie industry's cutthroat
Got a feeling this bitch know
But this why she came to the west coast
