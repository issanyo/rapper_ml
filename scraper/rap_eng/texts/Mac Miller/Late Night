[Chorus]
We get it poppin on a late pop popping on a late night
Popping on a late pop popping on a late night
Popping on a late pop popping on a late pop popping on a
Pop popping on a
Back Backpack full of goodies backpack full of good
Backpack full of goodies backpack full of good
Backpack full of goodies backpack full of good
Pop popping on a late night popping on a late night

[Verse 1]
We get it popping in the late night rocking til the day
You be in the corner just talking to some lames
Watch me as I take flight hopping on the plane
I'll be going til the song drop drop and go away
