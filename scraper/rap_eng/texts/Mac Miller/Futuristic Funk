Yeah, and it goes like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, and I tell em' fuck youuuuu if you hatin'

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I said they actin' like they better, but they never been the shit
Hows it feel to have a hundred thousand people on ya dick?
Well, it feels good, homie you should probably try it
If you never rocked a sold out show then keep quiet
I gets busy on a track, workin' double time
Tryna find a foreign pussy just to put my tongue inside
I be on top of the charts, you just an underline
Tearin' through the streets all these hatin' suckers run inside
Furious, fool probably wanna come and stomp me out
Mad they got a girl, and I’m all that bitch talks about
Been gettin' money since I walked around my fathers house
That dads be cop and search when I come and take their daughters out
Paper comes in large amounts, Im eatin' like I should
Surf and Turf shit, sink my teeth in somethin' good
They mad I ain't hood, nah I came to party hard
Your grillin' at me but I smile back, bitch hardy har

[Hook]
Come on down, grab your girlfriend down, make her spin around
Ain't no other motherfucker get the people this wild
What you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want? a little futuristic funk
We those kids gettin' cheese on some Cheetos shit
Just fuckin' for the night, then we leave that bitch
So what you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a little futuristic funk

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, so you probably heard I rap a ton, havin' fun
Never have I had a gun
Vomit when I spit like I devoured somethin' bad for lunch
Tryna figure out the way to get me rich, I have a hunch
Like Velma up a Scooby-Doo, confusin' like a Rubix Cube
Usually don't do this I be stupid just a nuisance
All you seem to hear about, I’m in ya ear, q-tip
Yeah that's dude sick, sleeve with a few tricks
Breathe in a huge spliff, weed come in two zips
You light it then I burn it like a furnace when the herb hits
Like it cause I earn it smokin' good veggie turnips
Bitch I'm fallin' from the sky like bird shit
Makin' movies everywhere I go, call me Ernest

[Hook]
Come on down, grab your girlfriend down, make her spin around
Ain't no other mothafucker get the people this wild
What you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a little futuristic funk
We those kids gettin' cheese on some Cheetos shit
Just fuckin' for the night, then we leave that bitch
So what you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want? a little futuristic funk

Like uhhhh, like uhhhhh
Yo Jerm's out there, makin' all this shit sound good
