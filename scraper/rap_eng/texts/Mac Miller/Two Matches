[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

[Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (let's have some fun)
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my longterm goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade
But can't we all just get along?
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged", I say I know
Roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash
Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo) and our key is anarchy
Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia
Soul!

[Post-Hook: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've seen some shit (I've seen it all)
How'd I end up in a place like this? (In this)
Swear to God, seen some shit
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
In this lifetime, be the time of your life
It's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest
Curse words were probably my first words, affirmative
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure
I'm a goner
Shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer
Better find that thing you die for
I don't know why what I get so high for
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...

[Bridge: Mac Miler]
Take your time
Don't close your eyes
Life happens in a flash
And you don't wanna miss that

[Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]

[Outro: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]
We all grow up to be gangstas, playas, snitches
Freaks and strangers, politicians
Good and evil people
Sinners, saints and everything in between
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, knowï»¿ me
Lately I've been thinkin' (lately)
I've, I've been thinkin'
What's the difference? What's the difference?
Nothing at all! (Never mind us)
Aye, let me just add one more thing, Josh
Aye, aye, watch that shit man, you almost burnt me nigga!
