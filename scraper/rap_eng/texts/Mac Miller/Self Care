[Part I: Self Care]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Mhm, mhm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home, with my eyes closed
But it be kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you can find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & J.I.D]
Yeah, well, climbing over that wall, mm (Yeah, wall, wall)
I remember, yes I remember, yes I remember it all
Swear the height be too tall (Yeah), so like September I fall
(Down, down, down) Down below, now I know that the medicine be on call, yeah (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
It's feeling like you hot enough to melt, yeah
Can't trust no one, can't even trust yourself, yeah
And I love you, I don't love nobody else, yeah
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere (Yeah)
Self care, I'm treatin' me right, yeah
Hell yeah, we gonna be alright (We gon' be alright)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home, with my eyes closed
But it be kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you can find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out

[Interlude: Devont√© Hynes]
Been on the road, I don't see it
Out on the road, I don't see where I'm going

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & J.I.D]
Yeah, I been reading them signs (Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I been losin' my, I been losin' my, I been losin' my mind, yeah (Yeah)
Get the fuck out the way ('Kay), must be this high to play ('Kay)
It must be nice up above the lights
And what a lovely life that I made, yeah (Uh)
I know that feelin' like it's in my family tree, yeah (Wow)
That Mercedes drove me crazy, I was speedin'
Somebody save me from myself, yeah
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere
Self care, we gonna be good
Hell yeah, they lettin' me go

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home with my eyes closed
But it be kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you can find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out

[Part II: Oblivion]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know, hey
Well, didn't know what I was missing, now I see a lil' different
I was, thinking too much, got stuck in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
I got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling
Plus I know it's a, it's a beautiful feeling, in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay I ride around my city when I come home, yeah
The sun set quickly then get up slow, yeah
I disconnect and upload
Watch it spin around, we just spinnin' round, yeah
Let's go and travel through the unknown, yeah
We play it cool, we know we fucked though, yeah
You keep on sayin' you in love so
Tell me are you really down? Are you really down? Yeah
Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's
It's safer there, I know there's still a war outside
We spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high
Can you feel it now?

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oohhh
I got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling
Plus, I know it's a, it's a beautiful feeling, in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
