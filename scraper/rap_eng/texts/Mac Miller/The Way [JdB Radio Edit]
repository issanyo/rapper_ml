[Intro: Ariana Grande]
I love the way, you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way, you make me feel
I love it, I love it

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Say, I’m thinking ’bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You give me that kinda something
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I’m at 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't want to hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way
(I love the way)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way you love

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
Oh, so crazy you get my heart, jumping
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it ain’t a question, (quick question)
Cause boy I know just what you like

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So If you need it, I got it, I got it every day
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't want to hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way
(I love the way)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way you love

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Uh, I make it feel so fine, I make it feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You’re a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time
Said your bed be feeling lonely, so you’re sleeping in mine
You come and watch a movie with me
“American Beauty” or “Bruce Almighty” that groovy
Just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you, I’m not gon’ get bored of
But baby you’re an adventure so let me come and explore you

[Chorus/Outro: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care this is it babe
I don’t want another way to feel you next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way
(I love the way)
I love the way
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way I love you
The way I love you
The way I love you
The way I love you uh, uh uh yeah
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
The way I love you
