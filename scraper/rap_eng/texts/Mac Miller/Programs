[Intro]
Yep, yep, yep, yuh, yep, yep

[Verse 1]
I don't got a reason to lie, they gave me the key to the sky
But I'd rather open my eyes, 'cause that's what'll keep me alive
Somethin' that's easin' my mind, please do not fuck up my day (No)
Everybody want a headline, I don't got nothin' to say
'Cept I'm comin' back with the freshness
You know I love makin' a entrance
Now now, don't get defensive, time is a matter of seconds
One, two, yeah
Off to see the wizard, lead the picture
Me and liquor, evil mixture, demons glitter
Clean the whiskers, he be Mr. Fisherman
Back on my shit again, doin' my own dance
Feel the rhythm that's no hands, I tell ya vision like programs
Busy livin' on triple digits, young old man
Y'all dead wrong, I'm upper with the echelon
So butter when the bread long
I'm goin' strong 'til my head gone, 'til my head gone
Yeah, floatin' back up on the scene, I'm sayin' hello (Hello!)
Do my thing, I'm pullin' strings like Tom Morello
I keep it movin', you be doin' way too much
I ain't tellin' time, just tell you when it's up (Yep)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (Yeah)
Yeah, one for you and one for me (Yeah, yeah)
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I mean wow, do not touch that dial, I've waited a while
Been around, just like word of mouth, you gon' hear me out, and I-
And I, and I, and I put that on my house
I'm always goin' overboard, I better swim before I drown (Drown)
I'm like rubber with the bounce, hundred be the count
Drummin' loud as thunder with the sounds, yeah
(Bang, bang, bang, bang)
I was younger, fuck around, every summer wild
Always had it jumpin' at the house
Yeah, clappin' for y'all (Y'all), I'm into havin' it all (All)
Feelin' like Shaq with the call (Call)
Stature is tall (Tall), rollin' around with the homies
A battery pack on my dawgs (Yeah)
Fuck with my thoughts (Yeah), havin' enough ain't a lot (Lot)
Puttin' a check in the box, straight to the top (Top), it don't matter
Never mind the pattern when you takin' your shot, woo!
Yeah, enough with the bullshit, enough with the bullshit
Enough with the extras, fuck all my money
I swear I been through it (Swear I been through it)
Fuck all the losin' (Yeah), that's just an illusion
Gotta keep them comin' back for more to keep it movin' (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me, yeah (Mmm, mmm)
Yeah, one for you and one for me
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me (Love for me)

[Outro]
Follow me, I know the way (Follow me, I know the)
(Who do we appreciate?)
Yeah, you know you better stand
Goddamn, put your hands together
Everybody got money, get the band together (Uh-huh)
Movin' like you can't stand the weather
But it ain't gon' rain always
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
