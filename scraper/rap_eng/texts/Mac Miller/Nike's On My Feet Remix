And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Aye lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em
Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon
Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete
Uh, I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night
Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm at LA eatin' 22 course
Young boss bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoe boxes
Mom says my spending habit a little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes wear-em-out
Hit the club bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin' they should give me a degree
Good liquor what I'm sippin' isn't cheap
Uh, finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep
All I really need is some shoes on my feet

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nikes
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike nike nike nikes

[Verse 2: Jay Lav]
Know I'm always rocking checks
Though I always cash em
Cash them ousside cuz you know I never back em
Rolling up 3 grams, we got them backwoods
I know you mad cuz, you not that good
I got a few pairs, few vans
So much money, I got shoe shares
Got a party, got a crew here
Waves, Nike's on my ferry
Fuck a check, we're rocking Sperry's
I'm from the burbs, no concerns
Got some holes, we could burn
Got some hoes, we could earn
Match up, we wanna burn
Smoking late, it was written don't overstate the peak
Nikes on my feet, Nike's on my feet
