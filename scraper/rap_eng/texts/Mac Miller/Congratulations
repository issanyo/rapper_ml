[Intro: Ariana Grande]

The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Ohhhhh-ohhh
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
Ohhhhh

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (sex)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they felt like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Um, well, baby
You were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this will make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Take your time, my baby
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
Cause I'm waitin' right here for you, for you

[Outro: Bilal]
You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your loveliness bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
