Chorus (Wiz Khalifa):
Got no problems
My weed lit
Got no where to go
So we ride
And we smoke
Til we can't anymore
And keep floatin
Uh
Pass it to your man and roll another one
And keep floatin'
When its almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some
And keep floatin'

Verse 1 (mac miller):
And you can pass that
The kid who rock a snap back
Steady blow this hash back
Until my thoughts are abstract
How to get by
Thats how we livin in this day and age
I bring some color to a world thats filled with shades of gray
Throwin this cake away

To blaze and sip some tanqueray
Remember spectatin till they pick the kid to play the game
Now im an all star blast it out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini speedin your a golf cart
California dreams
Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems these the thoughts the weed pull out of me
Blow through a thousand trees
The whole entire crowd can see
Livin in what seems to be fiction im on a balcony
I Light one up this for those whoever doubted me
Then light another this for those who hold it down for me
Passin around the weed
No problems at all
And you haters keep on hatin man I ain't talkin to yall
