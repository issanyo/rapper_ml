I'm posing a question, how many been empty and holding aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fucking recession my brother my mind's always moving I'm letting it go
Know that I'm pointing at negative energy, telling me stop
They're telling me no, don't
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, hoes got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me I'd rather you not, cause
It's driving me crazy the fact that you pay to make me into something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs, drunk
Fucking these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting
Why ain't you chasing your dreams?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us wanted to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won't they give me a turn--out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You're mistaken the world is cold and it's lonely ain't it
When 'em high roller homes in Vegas
Raid them with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands and I'm giving it back
Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like you work in the morgue aborsving the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life's so precious, Lord knows life is so precious
Fight to the death, til' there's nobody left
You're holding your breath because you might get infected
I'm animalistic, is mentally thinking I'm going ballistic
Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time
Initial symptoms is schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers
Except I'm cool with Vader and blowing up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on homie we major
I waste away in this room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands and I'm giving it back
