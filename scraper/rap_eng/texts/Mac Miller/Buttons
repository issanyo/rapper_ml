[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might, wake up, do it all again
There's a world going crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretending that it's alright

[Verse 1]
Yeah, alright
Days get mixed up, schedules get switched up
Can't be in two places at once
So, I take a hit of the spliff that I lit up
And forget I had to be anywhere at all
Goddamn how the mighty will fall, they wanna see me gone
But I'm here in spite of it all, I never play along
You can keep the fear and self pity
I'd rather tell you who I am really, yeah
This is not a wakeup call
I am the hotel operator, I don't owe nobody favors
I don't know how the fuck I've been around so long
Busy as an escalator in a crowded mall (uh-huh)
It's like, every year I realize my house too small
Get paid, upgrade, two cribs, new maids, more flights, flew planes
Live out my suitcase, lose days like loose change
I swear my life is on Blu-ray
Welcome to doomsday, the world needs a hero
And I am your Bruce Wayne, kind of like Luke Cage
(Well, well, well, well, well) You keep on running
We keep on pushing your buttons

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might, wake up, do it all again
There's a world gone crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretending that it's alright

[Verse 2]
I run around with open scissors, they taking pictures
I could lose my head, they grow instead, gets only bigger
I put one foot in front of the other, I never settle
Waste your time with water and wine, I'm turning liquid to metals
Still the same dude that used to never be sure
When I was way more insecure, and I'd feel better before
No umbrellas never could weather the storm
No sympathy for the devil, too busy building a temple
I am looking beyond, leaving them looking
Hot as the grill I'm putting them on when I be cooking
Shit, I keep on running if I have to
Medusa never turned me to a statue, no
I keep it moving, but keep it low
You can do your thing, shit, to each their own (yep, yep, yep)
But you better do something
We keep on pushing your buttons

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might, wake up, do it all again
There's a world gone crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretending that it's alright
