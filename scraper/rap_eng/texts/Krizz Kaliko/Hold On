She in love with the win her hand
Way you lift up when it's shit in the kill
Left up to the wheel in the air
She get a rush and thrill when it's...
Can't get enough, feel so real
Car... up,...
Anything so brilliant on this
Swear to god look like I spent a million on there
So where the country cowboys?
No hood, just... still warlords
In their chrome cause it bring the whole crow joy
Girls twing like when we showing out boy
Just throwing to break the new throttle with
Light... when you nick named
Tight body it's the same... modeling
The back, all you hear it is a holiday

Love when he... my motor up
... sometimes it ain't enough for me
Puts me on the back, hits the gas
Then he tells me hold on, hold on, hold on

She in love with the chrome, shine like...
She lust for the...
Bad girl she a bust for the...
Bad girl she too much for you homes
Real talk leave to dude like I
Bad boy, keep a tool on the side

... sheet and a fool on this ride
It's hard to move on to the next
When your last got... had to clean the... off his chest
Yep, stunt... I let the... she adore my...
Like a jet move forward with ease
And home boy can't afford my keys
So just... I bring, she step on the stage
And that hoe gonna leave with me

Love when he... my motor up
... sometimes it ain't enough for me
Puts me on the back, hits the gas
Then he tells me hold on, hold on, hold on

Bad boy, you can give to me, what I'm looking for
Bad boy, you can give to me, what I'm looking for
Bad boy, you can give to me, what I'm looking for
Bad boy, you can give to me, what I'm looking for
Take me for a ride,... while you hold on
Take me for a ride,... while you hold on

Love when he... my motor up
... sometimes it ain't enough for me
Puts me on the back, hits the gas
Then he tells me hold on, hold on, hold on
