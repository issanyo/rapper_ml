[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one that I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins
In a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
My hurt, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I grow leaf to chief

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: VerseBorn]
(VERSE!)
Follow the leader tell em holler at Ceasar
Its going down throne and crown like a bible to preacher
Keep it live for the people, meanwhile they lie to the people
And tryna justify disguising the evil? Na!
The skies look evil- poison pouring down constantly
I battle all my demons got me feeling like Constantine
Honestl-y im just the unlikely hero
Unplugged from the matrix out here feeling like Neo
Behold the beauty of the blueprint
As it unfolds with the exact hinged motion of the movement
(KONQUEST!)
A smooth shift once i setup shop
Be a transparent transition let the world listen aak!

[ALL]
Now we got the whole world pitching in
They listen in to what the TeamKonQuest mission is

[VerseBorn]
Its love peace and respect to all blessings
So bow to the three kings of the Quest without question

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here
