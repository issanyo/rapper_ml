[Intro: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
Your best better lay it down
'Cause homie don't play around
In my face they don't say a sound
And they never disobey the crown (Never disobey, let's go!)

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
King shit bring glitz, teams get fiendish
They see me looking like a mean lick
You dreamed this, your bean split
The demon said they want my wing clipped
And my green stripped, I seen zip
Talk a lot of shit but never steppin' to me
Not a weapon for me, nah!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Wanna get to me, with the AK but I'm running with the B
Never son of Mr. T, hoes keep coming with the V
'Cause they hear Tech stunting with the D
From a lit degree, tell me what the G
They try to figure how much money this'll be
Little dummy chickadee
Try me, am I gonna quickly eat a nigga like a yummy fricassee
Bitch

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit

[Verse 3: King Iso]
Man, what the fuck can you expect
When you rapping with niggas who be thinking y'all neck neck
Now they wanna funk with the master because I flex, bet
I been on my independent grind and you a Tech Deck
Now I'm out with Tech, yes
Bitch I'm 'bout to  bubble like a meth head
Sleeping on me, that'll be ya deathbed
Fly whooping Mitchell from the jet set
When your future's promising but not with them
They try to send you death threats

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I think you really better think about the cockamamie shit you're gonna pull first
'Cause if you do, I'm gonna pull first
The tool squirts and you'll hurt
Death threats give me fuel burst
Your bull chirps of jewel jerks
Get a motherfucking fool merked
And stay out of the wolves' worlds

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit
I get your death threats 'cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs and alcohol and bling shit

[Outro: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
Lay it down, lay it down, bitch (hey), bitch (hey)
