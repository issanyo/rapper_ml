[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Pain (Pain) (What is it?)
Originally penalty physically or mentally sensations
You feel when you hurtin' distressed
A bit of anguish can bring you closer to your death
'Cause of the lack of success now
Time, ain't on my side
'Cause I'm tryin' to find my piece of mind and rhyme
But the catch is you got to have the paper to shine
If we don't I'm sorry, we might have to do capers do crime
'Cause my mom is sick doc I'm grid-locked
Epilepsy and Lupus, Alfred Hitchcock
Couldn't write the suspense and shit on this block
Fist-cocked when I'm walking my lips locked
IRS and the child division they wanna
Shut a nigga down to the ground, gotta make this shit pop

[Hook: Liz Suwandi & Krizz Kaliko]
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on tickin', tickin' (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on slippin', slippin' (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on tickin', tickin' (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' (We got to keep it movin')

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Runnin' like a cheetah for the cheddar
Whatever we gotta do to make it better 'cause I'm (Running out)
Mama gotta get a better livin'
I got the power to bust (We got to do it movin')
Tryin' to get a milli and really I been silly
The pill in me killin' me the devil (Comin' out)
Lookin' for love and the demon never lookin' for love
I'm in lust (I guess I'm truly ruined)
No matter what I ever do, N9na always gotta deliver
Never comin' out on top as the winner
Might have to take it back to November
'71 when I was the heavenly son
Now we run with killers who carry the guns
Marry the bum now I gotta marry the one
But the one sick of carryin' the chrome, done
The root of the problems is the root of all evil
The ones that hiss are the enemy
And the ones that root are my people
After all this time, after all this rhyme
Still comin' to see me the fans
Takin' in all this all this N9ne
And that's positive 'cause everything
Is negative I need a sedative
You get her preg-a-nent they levy shit
Takin' more money than you'll ever get
I'm ready as ready get
For the capital out for your stack
I'll attack for your fetti, bitch
But that's petty shit
And if I grind I wonder how much time they gon' make me sit

[Hook: Liz Suwandi & Krizz Kaliko]
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on tickin', tickin' (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on slippin', slippin' (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on tickin', tickin' (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' (We got to keep it movin')

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
It's like it's a trap - Rap
When you spend your scratch
And you get with a partner on the coast
And somehow you never get it back
And you can't go get him with a gat
'Cause if you do that
The state will separate you from your brats
Chillin' with the killers and rats
I'm in a race for time
They wanna replace my mind
Skinheads, cops, gangbangers
And it's all in the devil's design
Just to get me, gotta get the money quickly
Before my mother is a wonderful history
If I can't make it before that
I will never ever forgive me
Racin' for happiness for that sunshine euphoria
But it's melancholy
And it's dim-foggy and dark like Fangoria
But I'm tryin' to pick up the pieces
That are broken beast is my species
So I hope my mother's alive and me too when this album releases
But the time is tickin' and my kids
Are growin' up I ain't blowin' up
I guess the bass in my music ain't hittin' low enough
Fuck that shit nigga 'cause my tone is tough
Shit that I'm doing is rough
Meetings with Atlantic, Jive and TVT can't come soon enough

[Hook: Liz Suwandi & Krizz Kaliko]
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on tickin', tickin' (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on slippin', slippin' (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Running out (We got to keep it movin')
Times a-running out (Running out)
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin' (We got to keep it movin')

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
We do too much, will we make it?
We make money and they take it
Time (Time, time, time) (Running out)
For me and you what is we gonna do?
