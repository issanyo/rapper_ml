Yeah...
Hello baby
What's the matter you don't love me anymore?
I'm back...

[Hook]
I love you so hard (hard)
We're breaking up, we're breaking up
But baby don't do me so hard
Breaking up, we're breaking up
Cause breaking up is so hard [2x]
Don't let me down

[Verse 1]
Together we stand, divided we fall
We tallied in pantyhose, way too small
All y'all, know how I met her
We broke up and got back together
And now we know better
And I talk about it on every record it's very hectic in the
Back up my mind, it's just a matter of time
And I bring home the bacon, my belly aching
"You been gone too long, how many girls you been on?"
You would never understand, the relationship
Baby just, sign the paper we could split the babies up a little later
Get you a little paper, every month
And now you can do whatever you want
I jump through hoops
Not these boots made for walking
Cause you think that we argue and I think that we talking
I paid for ya, maybe not made for love
Better wait til I'm older and pray for love
Love ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't really know what to fight for
Maybe you ain't s'posed to be my wife though
Here I stand, left hand on the bible
By the hand in my back where your knife go
Where'd my life go?
Guess I messed it up
It's on me, guess I'm fessin up
You were jealous it's all your fault
What more can I say I'm at a loss and I
I'm not the one with the evil eye
If looks could kill, I would for surely die
You need a guy with a 9 to 5
I got those Scorpio tendencies we can't survive
So turn it down just a little bit, you're clownin a little bit
When I'm gone reboundin a little bit
It looks like another love T.K.O
I'm a deadbeat dad but I beat the dough
You gotta lose ya, you're too much Medusa
When I break up now, then I'm down, with floosas
Would not goose the looser
Nobody else can do it to ya, I'm out now

[Hook]
