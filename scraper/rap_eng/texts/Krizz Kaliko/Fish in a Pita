[Hook: Krizz kaliko]
Got me fired up
Might wanna keep that tied up
Get up (get up)
And get goin' right now
Ain't feelin' right, feelin' wrong right now, hold up
Don't need her, don't need ya, won't eat ya
Fish in a pita
Alright then (alright)
I ain't trippin', I'm slidin', wait a minute

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
She pulled up in car at the crib
This was way before the Nina was a star and I lived
At my Granny's, the girl that stepped out the car she was a whammy
Tight jean shorts, no panties, and her booty was uncanny
Went to school together, how 'bout some food endeavors
I wrote it smooth in a letter
She wrote back cool, whenever
So this is the day
Hopped in the car wit' her to a kissin' display
Later for eatin' now I'm on a mission to spray, okay
Hopped in the backseat
Movin' toward her with that heat
Between her legs, the wings are spread
I'm yearnin' for that cat meat
I'm wishin' to beat her
But I got sniffin' her skeeter
Through her clothes
I quit because she had the fish in the pita, ugh

Ain't feelin' right, feelin' wrong right now, hold up
Don't need her, don't need ya, won't eat ya
Fish in a pita
Alright then (alright)
I ain't trippin', I'm slidin', wait a minute

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Big chick, pretty face
Okay I wanted to find out how them huge titties taste
Can't remember what city, state
I wanted the kitty space
But I did this dizzy date on the bus after my show with a bigly shaped
Bitch, kissin' on me, chick is only
They told my hissin' homies
Dissin' on me, ya'll trippin', nigga this a pony
They laughin' while I'm dashin' to the back
Finna be smashin' my pretty fat friend
Till her ass need a aspirin (hol' up)
Strippin' down, my dick is now (swole up)
Smells a fish and now my stick outta commission how (tore up)
I assume she hate to groom, funk illuminates the womb
Can't believe she let fish in the pita fumigate the room, ugh

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
If she sit on your lap and she got jeans on
And you smell that fish in the pita
She ain't a bring home
That really mean the stream wrong
It seems strong to be comin' through her garments
So why would you want that fishy cream on your ding dong
Some women need just to stop treating their twats cheaply
If that's between you we're not eating it's not freaky
So stop mistreating you're not feeding me hot meaty
Fish in a pita leaking to ziti, or tzatziki, ugh
I know you women thinkin' this awful
But you know who you are and you're livin' unlawful (if you're stinkin')
Fellas I don't know if anybody eva' taught you (fish in the pita)
It's hard as hell to clean it up off you
Jesus

[Spoken]
Hey man, what's happinin'?

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Alright then (alright)
