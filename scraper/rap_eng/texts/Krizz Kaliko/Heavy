[Intro]
Deformity, a bodily malformation, check
Distortion, or disfigurement, check
A Deform, person or thing, check
Gross, ugliness, check

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna take this, I don't wanna carry this, I don't wanna lift this
Everyday, when I wake, wishin' was a way that I can rip this
Off of my shoulder off of my back, like a big boulder got me off track
I don't wanna be seen lookin like that
I'm looking at it, it's mean lookin right back
Ugly, bloody, pussin', heavy
Way more sinister than Leatherface, Jason or Fuckin' Freddy
And that shit weighs me down, got me going crazy now
Lazy round me place, cause I got shit right side of my face
How did I get it? How did I grow it? How do I cock back and just blow it
Off? Surgery yes you know it cost and I ain't goin out to show it off
I'm just stuck in here, with this fuckin' weird stuff in near
Crushin', pussin', bustin' till it up and clears
I'm ready, it's wicked, it's gotta be deadly
It's everything you could imagine, bad, twisted, evil and medley
Down into eternal fire, this is where it lead me
Can hardly hold it up because this thing is so fucking heavy

[Hook]
(Ewww, that's gross, yuck, what's that?
Oh my god, disgusting, repulsive, what the fuck?
It's not a tumor, fuck the rumor
I need more to go, stop Staring at this
Mutherfucking side show)
HEAVY (Everyone you love got needs)
HEAVY (I'll shove start to buckle at the kness)
HEAVY (My lord said this slow heal carry
And if it don't then it might get scary)
HEAVY

[Verse 2]
Cha!
Gotta cover it up, gotta go outside to get food
How when the smell is like shit stew?
The way people are staring and lookin it gets cruel
Bad when I'm shoppin', at the walmart
They be laughin', then a brawl starts
Cause they wanna pick on a muthafucker
With deformities, bless yall heart
I'm sick of it, when it's on my back
I can't even get a women to kiss on this
Face, I don't even want to live on this, place
Because all people givin' is hate
And your really gonna get it bad if your, disfigured
The more these sick gigglers
Pointed my heavy load it gets bigger
They call me hunchback and I wish they wouldn't taunt that
They be lookin at a nigga like I woke up
And showin straight up shittin' in their lunch sack
Kids, grown ups, dogs, cats
All be lookin and pointing at this deformity on my back
Taking over me, I'm slowly, turning into it
This repulsive, nasty, heavy, sick, humongous pile of shit
Under my skin, infecting my blood
Like I have some kind of disease, it's
Big and bulgin out of my jacket and everybody sees it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What is it? With this load I carry there's problems in my life
Got big problems with the IRS and problems with my wife
Got a lot of problems with this music career, problems with my mom
And I gotta solve 'em quick they fallen on me
It's a problem with this shit on, and it's heavy
When everybody depends on you to be the shot caller
And you pushin, tryin to get all of your people
Over the wall, but the shit got taller
But you tough and determined, you rough and you learnin'
You cannot do if you not baller
So you get it and hit it one after another
And look - the lump got smaller
