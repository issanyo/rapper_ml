[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Another piece that I wrote, about me
Being stuck in my ways, yeah

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
What did I do to be so wrong?
Could I be so different?
Is there a remedy?
Will you be forgivin' me?
'Cause this ain't my life
Or the way it was supposed to be
Waiting here for you to come and tell me
What I do so wrong?

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Listen to me, this talent was given to me
By his omnipotence so dig it music is livin' through me
Even through prisons I've arisen he big and is in movies
Is him as if his is a hit, the vision is in beauty for women
When I'm writin' I'm winnin', so excitin' I'm grinnin'
Then you strike and now the fights are beginnin'
I gotta be sharp as a knife when I'm on the mic and you sinnin'
By stiflin' my spinnin', what imaginary life has you been in?
By thinkin' you be the reason, no speakin' to you this evenin'
I'm deep in this music reachin' for the piece I dilute the season
But you be illin' because my attention you truly stealin'
Pursue the millions, come in second-would you be willin'?
Don't think so, you be thinkin' time and I think dough
Love is what you need from me but in time it'll shrink mo'
'Cause I be on the grind for this rhyme and the ink flow
I go for mine and you think it's a crime and I think "WHOA"

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Everything in my closet is black, white and red
Most of my homies was bosses but got life or dead
Now I move in they shadows but I got the mic and bread
But this life it seem ya destiny is a knife or lead
Yes I was brought up in a Christian house
But my mother marrying a Muslim threw the Christian out
And what they did to Malcom X threw the Islam out
So my homies with money seemed to be the glistenin' route
What I found was funerals and I found it was real friends
But I paid attention and then I found it was real men
Takin' care of their families automatically built in
Riskin' they life in the street as long as the wheel spin
So, what I gathered from it is simply my prerogative
I only wish the organization was more positive
I maintain, and continue to gain thangs
I bust and I claim Strange but I'm reppin' the gang bang

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
