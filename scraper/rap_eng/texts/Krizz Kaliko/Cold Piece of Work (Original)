[Pre-hook: JL]
They treat my bidness like it's soda
Or my music like a perc
They know my flow is the yola
That's a cold piece of work

[Verse 1: JL]
That's dope nigga what you call a buzz when you caught a bus
I make you feel like you was on all the drugs
All the drugs, drugs, I got all the plugs
A-A-All this was to satisfy the customers
It'll hit you different depending on what we pay you
Pop it then the check the purity side effects of it fatal
Now you know that when you blow niggas wanna know what they pay you
(Fo sho') N-N-Noses in my bidness like a yayo!
Flippin' like it's crack and can't relax it's like we drug dealers
Or sit in psyche or SEG, I'm servin' sinking this and sink with nerves
Cook 'em like it's smack is what they slappin' when they get the urge
Keep 'em coming back we push these packages to listeners

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
I'll probably get it in a minute
And I be benefited when I finish
Ain't been timid about a meal ticket
I will kick it, 32 diamonds I'm all up in the dentist
I'm Donald Trump I grab the world by the crotch and kiss 'em
Make her bow down and now she's addicted to Krizz and how you feel now?
She let Kali Baby come drill now
Only use you to pay the bills now (Yay-yeah)
They can roll me up and smoke me like sativa
My pen'll penetrate the air like it's some type of reefer
Pinnacle, I ain't there but I'm 'bout to achieve a
Planet status, but I'm asking - can I buss sativa?

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
T9X is what they sniffin' when Tech Nina get to spittin'
My position is give 'em a hell of an addiction
On these scripts and they be itchin'
For the good dope that I be dishin' out for the listenin'
That's why I'm constantly cookin' off in the kitchen
Nigga I'm Mr. Molly, when Nina shit hits her body
It takes her and gets her naughty
Fella mixed it with liquor prolly
She'll love you and lick your lolly
Taking me is her hobby
She flipping through my discography, nigga
Then she swallow me, nigga
Buss serves on them bitches steady searchin' for the sickness
If you want it Nina's on it with the quickness
Shit is real not ficticious all the wishes for the bomb
You can get it from the Don P, I daze you like a whippit
Nigga I'm addictive
