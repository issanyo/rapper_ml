[Intro: Tech N9ne]
(Cause I was born to be fly)
Strange Music, baby
Cognito, Krizz Kaliko, Tech N9ne, yeah

[Hook]
(Cause I was born to be fly)
We rockin', we rollin'
We rockin', we rollin'
(Cause I was born to be fly)
We rockin', we rollin'
We rockin', we rollin'
(Cause I was born to be fly)
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
See I was born to take off, take off
And ain't no way that you can stop it
Yes I was a passenger, now I'm in the cockpit
Rock pits where I started it
Snake and bats where I end it
Living ghetto fabulous, ain't got but I spend it
And I fly like an eagle
Watch me fly around, the new guy in town
And I never let 'em tie me down
You need binoculars to eye me now
The new pilot, watch how high I get
When I provoke and quote how high I sit
Like ganja, high above came from under
Then so fly, now angels are under
The beast wanna get control of me
Spread my wings to fly high, when I'm too low to see
High like I'm ever a Jodeci
Are high like Micheal Jackson, patrol the sea
Get way up in the solar system
Flow too slow and you missed him
Fly way above I level
Fly to high for this devil, Kali

[Hook]
(Cause I was born to be fly)
We rockin', we rollin'
We rockin', we rollin'
(Cause I was born to be fly)
We rockin', we rollin'
We rockin', we rollin'
(Cause I was born to be fly)
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me

[Verse 2: Cognito]
Never mind that I'm a (Genius)
I never could know that I could take it
To a level that celebrities go
Now that I made it, I separated the hated
Debated on what the hell I'mma do
When I make it to the show
Jump in the crowd were the mosh is
They know who the boss is
I'm cuttin' my loses whatever the cost is
I'm never lookin' back, I never wanna be the one
That said I should've made it
So I sighed with the King of Darkness
I'm claiming Strange baby, I'm from the hood
And I would never trade it in for nothing
NNever take it back, even if I could
To live a life of rock'n'roll, every night on the road
And every night another city and it never gets old
Never too weak to get beat with she a diva belive'a
And C-O-G, Kutt, Scoob, Kali, Lynch and Tecca Nina
We the ultimate level of satisfaction
Everlastin', call 'em industry assassins
So what you askin', so when they hate you with passion
That's when I cash and laughin' all the way to the bank
With the money that I make
Take a little trip into the world of Strange with us
We got everything you need, weed to angel dust
Come and take a couple of these pills to make you lust
Why?

[Hook]
(Cause I was born to be fly)
We rockin', we rollin'
We rockin', we rollin'
(Cause I was born to be fly)
We rockin', we rollin'
We rockin', we rollin'
(Cause I was born to be fly)
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me
You ain't fresh as me
Nah, you ain't fresh as me

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
11-8-71 is when everything is a'comin again
I'mma feed 'em, begun of be one of the dummies
Get money the tug of gunner be who shoot you, who got you
No one ahead of me, you better just let it be
Better close by the stands a poster for lead in me
If you ever be ready to sever me, never be you caca Moo-fucka
I got everything, forever be king
The heap-a hunk-a cheddar we bring, will never be seen
Unless you got the weathery thing, you better be clean
I'm steady with the the feddy, baby let it get green
I was born to be fly, so in the sequa
I'm addicted to riches bitches and porn for me
Know what the rocker really wanna come with the chopper
When I pop and pop, believe the industry is torn when we die
Tech's gonna murder, better block your people
If you think you better, better stop the ego
Niggas wanna battle, but no prob for me though
The speed of Tecca Nina got the NOS for negro
Flyin' over niggas like a flock of seagles
You better get away cause I'mma drop the C-4
Tecca Nina and Kali, with Cog-enito
