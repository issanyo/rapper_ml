[Baby Bash]
I-I-I-I...
I like to watch her move slow...

[C-Ballin]
"C-C-C-C-Ballin..."

[Chorus: Baby Bash & Krizz Kaliko]
I like to watch her move slow
Uh oh, don't move it too fast, take it slow
I like to watch her move slow (slow)
Slow like siz-erp, but like the way you wiz-erp
Wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz, I like to watch her move slow
She is, she make it move just my speed
I-I-I-I-I like to watch her move slow
But don't stop
Make the body rock
R-r-rock, rock

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Peep game, that girl movin' like baked bread
Neck row turned ring row, great head
Skin tone seems smoother than a water stone
Don't move, girl, let-let me grab my camera phone
Talk to me, baby, you ain't got no man yet
Weekend in the Bahamas, you got plans yet
I'll tell you anythang if I could see that coochie rang
Lay-lay it down like Ballin G up on that California cage
I like to watch her move her body like a rattlesnake
Ass vibrate the room like an earthquake
Slow-slow motion, her body screwed up
It must be some purple in the cup
Cause she movin' so slow (slow, slow)

[Chorus: Baby Bash & Krizz Kaliko]
I like to watch her move slow
Uh oh, don't move it too fast, take it slow
I like to watch her move slow (slow)
Slow like siz-erp, but like the way you wiz-erp
Wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz, I like to watch her move slow
She is, she make it move just my speed
I-I-I-I-I like to watch her move slow
But don't stop
Make the body rock
R-r-rock, rock

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
I kept sippin' on Jemima, sippin' on that molasses
See how big that ass is, I'm higher than giraffe tits
I'm-I'm just checkin' out my draft picks, ass is mad shit
Can slow mo through 3D with no glasses
Slower than a turtle, a tortoise, harder than rigor mortis (No)
Is there none before us, I'm a Libra, she a-she a Taurus
Re-replay, grind it out, baby, feed me
Then can call your rear phone, girl, let's have a threeway
I'm-I'm into foreplay, we can do it your way
Just grease your body, damn girl, Oil of Olay
Tell me how you pop that P, win it like a lottery
In and out like a robbery, baby-baby get on top of me

[Chorus: Baby Bash & Krizz Kaliko]
I like to watch her move slow
Uh oh, don't move it too fast, take it slow
I like to watch her move slow (slow)
Slow like siz-erp, but like the way you wiz-erp
Wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz, I like to watch her move slow
She is, she make it move just my speed
I-I-I-I-I like to watch her move slow
But don't stop
Make the body rock
R-r-rock, rock

[Pre-Verse: Krizz Kaliko]
I like the way she move slow, baby making me hot
Call me Usher, she got me like "Oh my God!" (Kali Baby)
I like the way you do that thang
Slow it down, baby, I ain't going nowhere

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Too fast, baby, slow it (slow it)
I need the T for it (for it)
You the baddest chick in here, and everybody know it (okay)
Let me see you move it like you got it stuck in neutral different than one I've been used to
First, get you over the hotel balcony, rip out the [?]
First, she movin' sluggish like a snail do
Bringin' out the beast in me, I'm a mess up your hairdo
Pour me somethin' sur-pic, when we finished, don't desert me
I might want some more of your sippin', you're like a slurpee
Do it slow (do it slow...)

[Chorus: Baby Bash & Krizz Kaliko]
I like to watch her move slow
Uh oh, don't move it too fast, take it slow
I like to watch her move slow (slow)
Slow like siz-erp, but like the way you wiz-erp
Wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz, I like to watch her move slow
She is, she make it move just my speed
I-I-I-I-I like to watch her move slow
But don't stop
Make the body rock
R-r-rock, rock
