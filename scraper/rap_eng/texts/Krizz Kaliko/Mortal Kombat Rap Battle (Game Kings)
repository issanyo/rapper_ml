[Round 1: Sub-Zero]
I am cold, I know everybody knows it
Those who chose to oppose will get frozen
Chose by those who knows that I really go on
Break the nose of any foes that I flow on
Follow Bi-Han, do what I say
Up in the Lin Kuei mountains and beyond
Some say I'm fast, hall of famer like Deion
Well, maybe, ice, ice, baby, like Freon
Hey, Scorpion, I have no fear
So put away your spear 'cause I won't come here
I'll make you flip, I'll crack your lip
Make you see more blue then if you was a Crip
But I'm repping the Lin Kuei won't catch a thing
With your swing, so don't come near the sting ray
I stole the scroll of the temple of elementals
You hear me? So you know I R.I.P instrumentals
Just throw some water at you, it ain't hard
To get cold, rip off the gold of your shinguards
The wind chill is so ill and I'm to blame
Your new hero: Sub-Zero, that's my name

[Round 1: Scorpion]
Quickly tell you to get over here, disappear then I'm over there
There ain't no catching me, my weaponry is unfair
A much more powerful Asian than Raiden
Shoulda pushed pause, awh, naw, you really stayed in?
The game: who's a better ninja? I think you know
The name, I'll have you crying like you're just so mean
Now, you're trapped on your side of the screen
They push mute to get to hiding your screams
You can say I'm the king
Dissing me and I'm releasing the spear
No more speaking, come here shrieking
You beating and you leaking with fear
Freak of the Shirai Ryu Clan, sneak right by you and
Finish him! Rock-a-bye you, man
You think you're close but you're not, you were froze, now you're hot
Fatality! Right in tha spot
That you're standing in, so let the bidding begin
Sub-Zero, I beat 'em again, come here

[Round 2: Sub-Zero}
Yeuh, look, the gloves were off whlile they were never on
Alright chief, now you got beef to put the lettuce on
You know you're messing with a veteron
I mean a veteran, Scorpion's who I'm better than
It's like I'm chilling, I mean that I'm chilly
I shoot more water than Free Willy
All who Mortal Kombat me are beaten silly
'Cause I'm cold as the winter when I enter, feel me?
Haven't had a boss since Quan Chi
He paid me a fee, but I'll beat you for free
You know you can't defeat me
Push a button and blocking your fatality
So go the way of the Lin Kuei
Or catch a "L" from a sting ray
I win the belt soon as you push play
You should do what him say, I'm your Sensei

[Round 2: Scorpion]
Bring that ass to the Netherrealm, let me rope you
You can't cope that's why they put me on the poster
This is fire like you never felt, let me roast you
Scorpion win! Man, I told you
I'm a hell spawn spectre
You're just Quan Chi's collector
Slayed Jade, Cassie Cage and Sonya Blade
Kitana, I'm gonna disrespect her
I'll be attacking you, already black and blue
And your face will be matching too
Mister Big Voice tells me to finish him
No round two, Scorpion diminish him
The head hancho, Hanzo already won
'Cause I'm dropping bombs, yo
I'm a keep, telling you come here
So you could see the face of the anti hero
