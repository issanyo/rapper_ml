[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
(Tic-Tac-Toe)
I'm lining up my X's and O's telling Nina let's go nigga!
(Get that dough)
Kali Baby, we world wide now, tell your girl bye for now and
(FU Pay Me)
I'm looking for them checks next, looking for the exit, that's it
FU got a wife, sister, mama and nephew with little Christopher
What the F you think I'm spittin' for?
I'm not living for the middle living the given is difficult
Gotta live it up but life is pitiful
A pedestal, I put myself on, nobody gave me a damn thing
Stealin' vans, different lands, we doin' the same thing
It's time to pay the piper, freestyles for the cypher (Cypher)
Ain't no volunteer, look how far we got here
I been in places that you never been
Colored money, get it Netherlands
I get around like a ceiling fan
I need my chips with dip or meet my pistol grip
Cause if I slip, nigga, Crystal will trip, baby!
And I see some ladies tonight
That should be havin' my baby
FU Pay Me!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(FU Pay Me)
I'm not doin' it for free, I'm doin' it for me, tell 'em again!
(FU Pay Me)
I'm not doin' it for fun, I'm doin' it for money, honey
(FU Pay Me)
That's to get lots of mozza, that's what we after
(FU Pay Me)
I'm want the Presidents to represent me like Obama

[Verse 2: Makzilla]
When have you known me not to have no cash? (Think about it)
When have you seen me with a bitch that ain't bad? (Think about it)
See me in a color other than red? (Think about it)
When have you heard about me talking to Feds? (Think about it)
There's two sides to every joke, a partner best believe
I know green thumb, niggas with them coca leaves (That's right)
You see the game ain't the same, man, it's reasonable doubt
Niggas falling off the chain when it's a reasonable drought
In every hood, it's a snitch nigga running his mouth
But I was smart, I took my stash, told my brothers I'm out
Hold up, back up, Via, Diaz
Bitch nigga's envy, jealous, not us
Hand cuff, your bitch, she know, we rich
That's why, your face she rots Disney
Script writer, only know how to ball
No rehearsal, niggas know we die alone

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(FU Pay Me)
I'm not doin' it for free, I'm doin' it for me, tell 'em again!
(FU Pay Me)
I'm not doin' it for fun, I'm doin' it for money, honey
(FU Pay Me)
That's to get lots of mozza, that's what we after
(FU Pay Me)
I'm want the Presidents to represent me like Obama

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I'm still coming for that Absolute Power money
And I know they don't really want to have a shoot shower for me
Especially when I'm in L.A., they lay like a hour from me
Let me stop cause he is what makes the thing on Gower yummy
And I eat that with a waffle, I regret I didn't pop you
No respect I get hostile, checks you owe Tech is colossal
Many consecutive checks you kept I can stretch, that is awful
But I suggest you get it even if an address given, sex in a brothel
All that money must've left you lazy
Guess you took a couple more steps too crazy
We one hundred but take a guess who's shady
Woulda handled it man to man except you lady
Ikey this really piss your nephew daily
And it's serious now that cause Tech grew babies
Even if you say you send all that's left to Haiti
FU Pay Me!
