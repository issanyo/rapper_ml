[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Hey!, Kali baby!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(She got a backpack!)
And a lunch pail too
Cheatin' when I'm sitting next to you
(She got a backpack)
And I got a ruler for her too
And I'm bout to take her back to school
(She got a backpack!)
And a lunch pail too
And milk could do her body good too
(She got a backpack)
And I got a ruler for her too
And I'm about to take her back to school
Like this!

[Verse 1:Krizz Kaliko]
I can tell she got that thing by the way that she walking
Love that ding-a-ling by the way that she talking
Baby got them goodies, think she wanna do me
She's a floozy, oozy wanna give it to me
She got a jack-in-the box, plus she a fox, might jump right off
If I get to toss, not gonna talk, lights come right of
She know I'm Kali baby maybe its unfair
I don't care, I just wanna lay in her hair
Give me than number one rhyme-y voo on the after set
I ain't seen one to stunt ya wonder if it happened as of yet
Her bubble, gets me in trouble
You can call it two XL, imma call it double (oh yeah!)
Her backpack two pack, eject some, she got me erect some
Now I just expect some
Your body's inviting me to a fight that we'll both like
We'll end the night in the right light if I spoke right
(Baby!)

And milk could do her body good too

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Her backpack full of school supplies
(Whoo!) Her thighs make me scoop her
Back end round like a tuba
Got a trunk on her
Front keeps me wantin' her
Mad at her for that
Matter of fact, I need to have it in the back
Attack it in the sack
Don't know how to act when around ya
She gimme that look like I'm bout to clown ya
I hound ya, for a piece of that
How's about a squeeze on that
I'm easy like Sunday morning
I'll give up my cheese for that
Thick Ms. Krizz is the pick for ya wishlist
Get bent, you'll get a pinch in the bidness
She make 'em all geek when they view that
I told you, she got a backpack
But you already knew that

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(She got a backpack!)
And a lunch pail too
Cheatin' when I'm sitting next to you
(She got a backpack)
And I got a ruler for her too
Now I'm bout to take her back to school
(She got a backpack!)
And a lunch pail too
And milk could do her body good too
(She got a backpack)
And I got a ruler for her too
Now I'm about to take her back to school

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Baby just shake ya
Your money maker
Looked her up, and down and said
"Hmm, I'll take her"
Break out my wallet, pay for that whatchamacallit
I knew she had a backpack from the front' fore I saw it
She's a stallion, got them boys hollerin'
Ballers, all of us, hope her and them girls come on and follow us
Them 816 Boyz, brand new Rat Pack
Lookin' for them girls
Packin' them backpacks

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

And a lunch pail too
And milk could do her body good too
