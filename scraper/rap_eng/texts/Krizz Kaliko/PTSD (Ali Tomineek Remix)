[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one that I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in Iraq, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
My hurt, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A verticle leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: Ali Tomineek]
Okay, I hate to say it, but my brain is aching
Your thoughts are decisions
My noggin's a prison, I can't escape it
I'm staying anxious anywhere that a stranger's face is
It's way too dangerous, I think I'm safer in vacant spaces
Living every single day on the edge can really go straight to your head
Tossing and turning, I feel like somebody is lurking, I'm laying awake in the bed
I'm hot as the furnace
I'm feeling my body get nervous every time I'm taking a step
Ahh, they want me taking some meds
Ahh, just to take away from the stress
I just dismiss it
Don't need to get my fix in just to fix it
Don't want to risk it cause who knows what this medicine is mixed with
We've got different visions
You ain't never been in this position
So my dispositions dismissive when you sentence opinions
Somebody please
Stop me from living in my memories
It's all I can see
It's making me freeze like negative 180 degrees
It's not a disease or a disorder
My mind's just trying to reorganize
I'm never too sore to fight
I'm the warrior type
Leave them mortified

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
