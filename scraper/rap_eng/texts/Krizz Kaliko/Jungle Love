[Intro]
Oh my God, it's like I've never been with like a black guy before
I mean, you're so different
You make me feel so different, you know?
I mean, you make me wanna...
I don't wanna tell you
Oh, you just excite me so much
My God, I can't believe I'm about to make it with a...
Black guy!

[Hook x2]
Oh, she wants some jungle love
That's what she want from me
Oh, she needs some jungle love
Yes, she been bad
Watch me come back

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Lighter than the lightest, more than quite a view
After she attend the barbecue
Baby got the 'itis
She fishing for something
She wanting something new
What better than a human to do it than a man of hue?
She won't leave me alone
Yeah, it really turns her on
Three hundred sixty degrees
Dunking, chicken eating bouillon
She heard stories 'bout how the loving was better
From my girlfriend, the best she had ever had
Kick it back, bad to the bone
She like the black snake moan
Want to take me home, put me on the metal dust me
She can't handle me, trust me, breeze is 'bout the bundle
Now she's in the darkness looking for loving in the jungle

[Hook x2]
Oh, she wants some jungle love
That's what she want from me
Oh, she needs some jungle love
Yes, she been bad
Watch me come back


[Interlude: Woman]
"So, is it true what they say about black guys? I mean..."
*Unzip*
"Oh my god!"

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
She likes to get it on the reggie
What, me? Too veggie
See me? Too heavy, baby, hold steady
Let the doctor operate the proper pace
Knock your vertebrate out of socket (Rock it)
Let me be the chocolate you can bite off of
Might offer her the Hershey kisses, she the new missus
Ebony and ivory, looking for the size that'll suit ya
Ghetto Kamasutra, what's happening
Mixed babies like we from Minneapolis
Falling in love with them Amafricans
Never coming back again
She'll bring the porch monkey back
Jungle bunnies rocking, sock it to them in the side riding in my Cadillac

[Hook x2]
Oh, she wants some jungle love
That's what she want from me
Oh, she needs some jungle love
Yes, she been bad
Watch me come back

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
She wanna do it with a black dude
What if daddy catch you
Sleeping with a brother full of tattoos?
Pretty sure that he want to slap you
When you admit it that somebody hit it
Plus the leader of a rap crew
She really craving the chicken and watermelon
She's begging to give it up with a fella, that's incredible
Weddles and heavy metal
Put my huevos on pedestals
Women love it too much to let it go
Now she on CP time with thugs and bad guys
Bad vibes, her family hopes she gets her act right (Act white)
Now they run to their Rev and a Rabbi
'Cause you want 100% Zulu Massai
She wants to hear ruckus, not them queer suckers
Banana Republic wearing label and the spear chuckers
Polow da Don says white women are submissive
But in time, he will find there's a bit of psycho in all bitches

[Hook x2]
Oh, she wants some jungle love
That's what she want from me
Oh, she needs some jungle love
Yes, she been bad
Watch me come back
