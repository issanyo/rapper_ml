[Intro: Tech N9ne]
(Tech Nina, lets get it)
Mama told me get it and I did
Make a beautiful livin' for my kids
Man, I'm really in love with my gig
Wasn't always known I couldn't take the throne 'till I raced for home and I slid
For my labels flown where I lived (KC)
But the Yates was growin' in my biz (Yeah)
And I couldn't even afford Reebok's
It was Payless shoes and hole-y socks
Then I started to earn G-knots, screamin' F-T-I on TV spots
Livin' the lovely life we chose
Still I'm livin' it by street codes
Pain and poverty put these flows in Beast Mode
Here we go

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
The road to my success from here was not a block away
On the coast they told me I'ma part with Travis, not today
We just wanted what's hot to play
But they gave me no slot to slay
Even though I'm not Lecrae, every day Tecca Nina would drop to pray
On my knees in a cot
There was multiple beds in my spot
So let the champagne pop, everybody feelin' my gang-gang lots
Took a lot of hard work to get guap, when you comin' from a scarred turf, could be stopped
From the hurtful dirt to the top
Yeah we gonna celebrate today 'cause we got

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
Let the song play (We got it)
'Cause we done came a long way (We got it)
They know we get that grown pay (We got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (We got it)
The long way

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Too big and too ugly, would you ever love me?
Every city we visit, we get it, but people they look at us funny
I feel like I'm way too fat, but what I'm packin' is making them kitties get after 'em
They hearing me flippin' and rip the back up out the track, then they trackin' a pack of 'em
Applause, applause, now we sell it enough to get our house and our cars up
Gotta get them bars up to be part of the upper echelon and hit the stars up
And we did it (okay)
Me and Nina stay committed to our art, we always doin' our part
We get it (okay)
And we knew we gettin' the cheese or we siezin' our G's up, Jesus
Only breaking from making 'em rock
The pushin' manuever been making the block
Indusin', I'm cool when I'm oozin'
I'm cruisin' the planet, they think I'm faking a lot
I gotta get to the money, gotta get to the money, and they think I'm making a lot
I'm keepin' a millimeter pilly under the tummy for dummies, if they wanna plot
New money, I ain't trying to save, 'cause I just made it
Look at my royalty state, thank God for the ones who gave it
Lots of props for the ones who made it
'Cause this road ain't paved
Sippin' till I'm elevated
We made it, so we gon'

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
Let the song play (We got it)
'Cause we done came a long way (We got it)
They know we get that grown pay (We got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (We got it)
The long way

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, we started this Strange Music in Trav's basement
Now we gonna have our fifth Strange building because we had patience
And I got all these mass payments with a mad cadence
Kill it when I rip it up, I'm makin' 'em listen, not pickin' me up, and I never have a cash craving
We appreciate this, so we create hits
See me lay this, inebriated
And we be faded, indeed we stay lit
From the oddest, to people listen, and look at me Godish
Not a time for Nina to be modest
People celebrate with me 'cause we got it

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
Let the song play (We got it)
'Cause we done came a long way (We got it)
They know we get that grown pay (We got it)
Now they mess with me the long way (We got it)
The long way
