[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Damn, forgot to do something
Oh yeah, it ain't over, motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Godemis]
Could it be they don't really know me?
I don't care, fuck you, blow me
I'mma get it right for the show me
Can't nobody call me out, I'm a vet' 'round here
Y'all stuck in the middle like Monie
Cooked with the roni
Up to my neck in a pile full of vixens sucking up on me
Fuckin' her face like I love that bitch
But I won't ever let one control me
Fuck with it Bro B, look, I'mma luncheon
Ridin' the back of a one-trick-pony
Back in the function, lightin' the stage on fire
Now look at me like a phony
Hooked I'm an only -- child and I give two shits if a bitch wanna run up on me
You can lick my asshole but do not pass go
Gotta pay me what you owe me
Wait! For the warning I'm alarming 'em all
You finna get mauled outside the mini-mall
And admit it we are literally raw
Y'all Mitch Bade with a thong and a bra
Better call the law, the snake and the bat in the building
Swildin' I'm stackin' a million
Crackin' a couple of cases smokin' a freshy
Facin' the fuckin' ceiling, chillin'

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't over 'til it's over [3x]
Okay, this shit's over

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
Huh, uh
I'm about to act in my faith so I rap in the game and the game
Mean we back with the fame like a slap in the face
It's strange, how I laugh at the pain get to tappin' your brakes
Need a couple racks in the safe
I'm stacking the cake, I play for the bat and the snake
Never wonder why I'm jackin' my rates
I train in the trap, livin' in a maze
No map now I'm runnin' like a rat in a race
I happen to know, many men are wrapped in my soul
Man you dunno the half of the whole
I chill in the class on my own
I'm feeling when you [?] feel like Attack of the Clones
Can't tell the weird from the wack
Skill from the flash, Jill from the Jack from the Joe
I act on my own, after the throne
Come up out of my chair, the gat to your dome
Pass me the dro on the left hand side
No captain of coke, I'mma let that ride
Wrapped in a robe, Jedi Knight
Bet I bust on the mic with dead eyesight
I'm back in the zone like I never had left it
Somebody show me which crew better than Ces is
I don't know why they ain't get 'em a necklace
Get 'em a world tour with a bed and a breakfast, uh ha

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Once again the never ending (Kali)
Always offending rappers, over now they're bending
The death of hip hop open my mouth avenging
I'm way too clean, all of your styles are dingy
Never see me (No!)
Even if you had me under a microscope, see my mic provokes 'em
A Twitter full of fans and you're by your lonesome
Get her out of her pants and you know she wants some
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Your status ain't nothing more than a penny
Rap until my lungs is empty
Even Tecca Nina can't pretend to be me
The wild in me or Godi defend the Ubi
This is my duty to rock and then don't stop it then they interview me
Don't know me that ain't common cause I ain't a newbie
I'm a painter from anguish
You don't know, baby you ain't speakin my language
It's a done dealy-bob, a done deal-rosky
Got a deal so you can't approach me
Hot so you never could roast me
So it ain't finished, finito until I say so brosky
So I clobber 'em when I'm coming I slobber 'em
Don't bother em with garbage
This shit's over, but I feel like it barely started (Kali)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't over 'til it's over [3x]
Okay, this shit's over

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
You need Schei√üe spray, because my shit's makin' the flies split
So anybody that want it they're gonna die today
When the mic sits, upon my lips, it come a crisis, you better hide away
High pitch, you no like this, then it's bye bitch, don't even try to play
White Mike and it's Donnie, your life's a bitch
When it's Tecca Nina with them and then a Spider K
We groovy with a Caucasian and three mulies
Never disrespect us see toolies from Kali, Godi, me, Ubi (Eh!)
Effortless I'm gonna change your brain
Bring every wicked bit of Strange to mainstream
Now my baby-making thangs are hanging
Cause my type of insane we slanging
And you don't wanna wake up
In the middle of killers a milli gonna rudder you up and
I feel up a butter my niggas ill and willing to buck
With a villain a cutter you chilling with a pill in your gut!
I wa- I wanna rock, nine mil I got
I'm in this, rhyming assault, shot when I call bubble
The way I'm livin' it ain't nothing subtle
And he just livin' in a fucking hovel

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't over 'til it's over [3x]
Okay, this shit's over
