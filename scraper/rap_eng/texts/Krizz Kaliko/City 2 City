So bend it over baby, let me see it pop
On this tour bus we party 'til the panties drop
You smell that green (Green)
That's the Kottonmouth
That's my family, homie, hold up what you talkin' 'bout
If it's negative, I don't want to hear it
Eliminatin' player haters with their evil spirits
Kansas City King
Kickin' it with the Kings
Take a whiff of weed and we for wicked things
Dang choices

Going city to city, stick a stick and move
HEY! X daddy, they call me Daddy X
Can I get a whoop-whoop for my homeboy Tech (Whoop-whoop)
Fuck checks, we get paid in cash
We the lords of the underground dine and dash
Fuck that, put your ass on the table
Thoroughbred bitch get fed in the stable
Back room look gather 'round real quick
Bitch is sucking dick like carrots on a stick
What you think was gonna happen in your town

Of the Middle, lovin' and givin' it to you, when you give me lovin'
Hurtalina girly-girl, don't after she sippin' the purple
She perpin' the perpsinse against the influence
I got a fifth of whiskey a grip of bitches with me gettin' tipsy
A bag that we can roll up in zig zags, now hold up and get back
