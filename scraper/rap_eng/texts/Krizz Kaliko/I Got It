[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Baby, where you been
You left this morning, but it feel like forever
I got this money to spend
Let's spend it together
Trips ain't but a price (Oh, yeah)
Whips ain't but a price (Oh, yeah)
You could just spend the night
But feel like I want you forever, yeah
Oh, whoa, if I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
Oh, whoa, if I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
If I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
If I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
If I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
If I got it then you got it

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Baby, where you been
Hot up in the summer
Mama came around
Had to get the number
Go connect the dots
Shopping spree coming
If I gotta cop it
Racking up the numbers
Anything, you could pick it up
Pack it up and we could walk it out
Lot of bitches gon' be hating on you
Let's give 'em something they can talk about
Snapchat, Virgin Airlines
Celebrate with baby every night
Rub her body down, bubble bath
Instagramin' baby, when it's bed time

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Baby, where you been
You left this morning, but it feel like forever
I got this money to spend
Let's spend it together
Trips ain't but a price (Oh, yeah)
Whips ain't but a price (Oh, yeah)
You could just spend the night
But feel like I want you forever, yeah
Oh, whoa, if I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
Oh, whoa, if I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
If I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
If I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
If I got it then you got it (If I got it then you got it)
If I got it then you got it

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Doing a whole lot of spinning
Me and mama won the lotto
The new Christian, me and the Louis
Them VVS's, they gon' follow
Hopping out from Colorado
Mansion all up in the hills
I'm planning get you to the money
Let's take a tour from Beverly to Hills
Ruby diamonds define us
They give me more expensive wine list
I place you up upon a pedestal
Them other hoes know what time it is
I introduce you to some new shit
And every single day exclusive
See, baby, this'll never ever happen
You have to sit and listen to the music

If I got it then you got it
