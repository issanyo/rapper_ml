[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatised much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse Two: Jester]
Voices in my head evicted who's inside
Cheated on death, committed to suicide
Nuts are loose, restricted screws are tied
Hung the jury out to dry, watch the court divide
You expect me to keep every thought inside
That would be fuckin' selfish of me, being the only one mortified
Personalities in the floors, that's where they hide
Characters in the walls is where they reside
Disorders beyond these doors are denied
My cocks burnt, balls are scolded & my arse is fried
Doctor kept this mental suit case closed classified
In chemicals my futures soakin', presents damp & the past is dried
Loosen up arteries with your nerves tied
Gave my mums mouth a hysterectomy, my dads throat got fucking circumcised
Stepped outta my boundaries, crossed my limits, never been dignified
Seekin' skeletons in my closet, dig & hide
Orderin' stress traumatic posts I been terrorised
My sounds won't be radioactive, my visions won't be televised
