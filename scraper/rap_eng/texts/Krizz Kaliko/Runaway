[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Yo, wassup baby?
How you been?
It's been a long time since I talked to you last
I got a question, you still with homeboy?
Y'know homeboy don't matter to me
I'm interested in you baby
We can creep
Y'know what I'm sizzlin'?
Just think about it baby, I'm tryin' to get with you for real

[Hook: Erica Hugunin]
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Wassup?
This ya boy Tech Nina
It's good to hear ya, but it's been a minute since I seen ya
Fox demeanor, gots to dream ya
'Cause you stay blocked and locked with hops between ya
I know you got a man, I know you got a little on the side
But I was thinkin' if you down for creepin' then we can slide
You's a hot one, and you look like you need a top notch one
Ya boy couldn't win it with Johnnie Cochran
I know he with you when it's cool, but I'm still tryin' to get you to cruise
That ill behind and your lips and your boobs
Come get with a fool
We can take any trip that you choose
Forget that your dude is waitin' while you twistin' in the nude with this
Boss villain ghetto true mafia
Feel you from here to Czechoslovakia, what's stoppin' ya?
I need it and I don't think that I can deal without it
Strictly being real baby tell me what you feel about it

[Hook: Erica Hugunin]
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I know you got time with dude and I'm new
But I'm a true, and I'm tryin' to get into you
I know he probably give you big love, but I don't trip Cuz
Dude's cool, I met him at the strip club
Ya he's good for you, he keeps you grounded
While I pound it, soft and wet is how it sounded
Leave you astounded, from the tongue dancin' around it
That's the angle, search for an angel and then I found him
Right between those eyes baby
I know it gets heated at home
But your homie Tech Nizzle can hear your cries baby
I know it's hell, I put out fires with this
Got him cussin' on your pager and slittin' tires and shit
You don't need that, you need positive feedback
Lift you're skirt up and throw you on the counter and eat that
L-E-G's back, pull it out and I tease that
We release that, have us a drink and repeat that
What you think?

[Hook: Erica Hugunin]
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Yo, yo, check
I need a hardcore chick who can chill on the rap side
Love, money, and keep her scratch-tied
So when your homeboy don't act right
Just remember my face
Is a permanent sittin' spot, for your backside
I'm just tryin' to kick it
Make up your mind you want N9ne to stick it
I'm diggin' you because you fine and wicked
Don't want to miss it, I'm psycho sick wit' it, dig it
I sop you like a biscuit, and I'll hop ya like a cricket
This is a - decent proposal don't ever hate on it
When I see somethin' I want baby, I'm never late on it
You ain't gotta answer now, you can marinate on it
But before I go I got to throw this serenade on it
It goes when it rains and when it thunders
If he treat you like a cheap and he runaway from ya
You can call me on the under
When you need someone to run to just dial my number

[Hook: Erica Hugunin]
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
So what you think baby?
You think you can do this?
You think you got the borders to do this with me? (Hehehe...)
I know you're thinkin' about it
I know you're thinkin' about it
I see how you look at me
You and me exchangin' looks over his shoulder at the restaurant, remember that? (Heh)
Ya, I know you remember that
Just creep with me baby, it's cool
We can kick it, y'know what I'm sayin'?
