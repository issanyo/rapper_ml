Now they be takin' turns, tick tick talkin' tongues with the agony
They want me locked up before I swallow the canales
Reminiscing the killin' of families, strangling callously
If for the higher power wants me to feed me the virgins
I'd murder the prophet for leaving me bodiless
Resurrection, this is the second coming but
Who would have ever thought he would spit a verse with Tech Nina?
And when he kills, the bodies chill, but it's still
Spiritual battle between the devil and the rapping phenom
Welcome to the armageddon, but do you think you breath enough
Dead bodies stuck in my torture rack, embodied soul, it's the paradox
But I'm dreaming, sleeping paralysed
Walk me through your fantasies
Torment me to my death
But there ain't nobody stopping me
Now I wake up, breath in, death wishes, say my prayers, I'm checking out
I be marching to your rhythm, blindfolded puppet, I'm breathing out
Getting closer to my moment but I'm looking at a mirror
Now I'm stepping to your
Vision, shit
I am my own freakin' demon
