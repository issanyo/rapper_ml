[Acapella Verse: Tech N9ne]
Yo
What up, sit up, get up wit' us killas
Enough niggas to crush ya luck and bust ya' guts and liver
Hit with the Ruger and now ya' livin' off in the river
Watchin' this arsonist while a spark a bit
Of my heart and bark I'ma start the shit (Sir, please)
Welcome to the bottomless pit, animalistic
I know it's hella dark in it
My world (Sir), is not like a regular life
We tote big guns instead of a knife (Hey, you can’t say that in here)
Hella grim night, the devil is in flight
He said a Beretta will get us whatever is in sight
You got a job, I ain't got one
You've got wad, I gotta shotgun
You gotta guard, I got squad
You here to work and I'm here to rob!
