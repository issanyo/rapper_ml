[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Steady shootin' for the stars on this vertical journey
I be recruitin' more for bars
Gotta be hard, in the tar
I'm runnin' with cannons that really loosen your regards
Creatin' money money and then some
These motherfuckers will murder you for your income
So when the flash the pass into begin some
Spittin' my favorites with Prozak and Lynch Hung

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
After the shows I'm thinking about food (MMM!)
Just give me some vittles and drink and I'm cool
You probably thinking that a woman's on mind too
But I drool over Italian cooking, it's my jewel
I eat all of it all the time
At the mall even y'all when they call the N9ne
Money tall yes I ball missin' all the signs
So when you see me we can meet I never draw the line, huh
Doctor said that my blood pressure phewm!
I was healthy for one minute but then the fumes
Of a peppercorn filed within the room
I gotta go get it soon, you seeing the nigga zoom
Capital Grille and The Melting Pot, they know my name P.F. Chang yes it help a lot
You let the N9ne cut the line when it's sweltering hot
So wind and dine me and mine 'til we belching lots
I can't stop eatin', I really love eatin'
I know my body be wishing I was vegan
The fat of my stomach it was leaving me, feedin' me
All I be thinkin' when I be breathin' unevenly
But that don't matter, I'm taking it to the head
Tucking my tummy in even if in bigger threads
Telling me if I don't be careful and kill the bread
I'm gonna pig out until a nigga dead

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Insatiable's my name when it comes to my favorite things
I sleep my sins off in the day
And then at night I come to play
On my favorite
I never plan to die, too much I haven't tried
Give me more, give me more, I crave it
Yes I love it, that's my favorite

[Verse 2: Prozak]
I'm an addict, who's frantic manic on everything
Kamikaze chemicals into my blood stream
Caffeine, nicotine and the good green
On top of Vicodin it's kinda like I'm takin' flight again
Prepare for lift off, stimulation drift off
If I don't feed my addiction I'm getting pissed off
All these vices they siphon my life span
Monkey on my back I got the devil in my right hand
Always leadin' me, deceitful thievery percedes to impede 'til there's no more Steve in me
In need to feed the beast, off to eagerly
I can't seem to leave it be and be free
Feel my synapses, collapsing, I'm gasping, I think I'm going out like Michael Jackson
Tunnel vision everything is turning black and I'm headed to a place where there never is no coming back
Swan dive in the Lake of Fire all thanks to my faithful drug suppliers
All it takes is a taste, now you're all subscribers
Under the reigns of the chains of your own desires
Your new God is in black attire
Now a slave to his ways, you could not defy him
Such a waste in this race 'til ya life expires
No escape, given chase like I'm Michael Myers

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

Give me more, give me more, I crave it
Yes I love it, that's my favorite

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
After the shows I be off the E
Got a big fat sack and it be all for me
6 in the morning I be off of these
Yellin' 6 in the mornin' like my nigga Ice-T
I pop all of it all the time
And they put me in the zone when I'm writing rhymes
Drugged out, 'bout to take the mug out
Drinking gallons of water I gotta get the drug out
So stuffed like I'm sniffing coke up
And I love it as much as I love putting cold cuts (go rough)
Yeah I'm the nigga that your hoe love
She be trying to rape me but I be like hold up
Date rape 'bout to sell a rape tape
Yeah, Kim Kardashian/Ray J
All up in that ass again, mayday
I'm just sick in the head as they say
I be off the top, TEC-9 cocked
And I'm paranoid ready to pull it that's off top
Y'all better than us, hog slop
Get us on a Tech N9ne stage it's gon' pop
Grrr, and it's all up to her
She just popped the pill and I'm purr
This is not for real and I'm ill
Call me a Beastie Boy, Kill at Will
