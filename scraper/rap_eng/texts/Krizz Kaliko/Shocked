[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I'm off on L.A with the Rogue Dogs, I'm using the phone
And Big Scoop rolling a nigga get out the shower
I say: "take a bath fat nigga"
He said: "bath don't make no sense"
I said: "why is that?" He said: "sittin' in your ass water"
Ahahahahahaha

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
It's like that yaw, it's like that yaw
We went from slangin' them pieces to bussin' raps yaw
It don't stop yaw, 'til we at the top yaw
Me and Kutty bloody nutty leavin' 'em shocked yaw

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I roll with, villians and vigilantys, regimers and outlaws
Mob figures we don't hang with cowards without balls
When they come runnin' nigga they stunnin' I give the outcall
Consisting of pistol starters dealers and south paws
Payed brother say brother where you get them hoes at
Is what they say to the nigga with the most scratch
We dominate niggas prominent rhyming acts of war
You vomited when we commented boming at ya door
Just call me chakratease awfully cockin' your properties
Dropping the hypothesis make knots and monopoly roll
And it ain't no stoppin' me my stock will be properly watched
I'll be hot to these biancs it be a lot of flocks
At the top will be hoes
Yeah, you tell them niggas we can't be blocked
We can't be stopped, can't be halted I'm from the block
Exalted I'm at the top, you talk it I'm bustin' shots
With the villains and the deuce niggas
We leaving you motherfuckers shocked

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
You don't really wanna step to me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease
You don't really wanna step with me

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
My melody reeks, so mo hail to hell on the streets
My felony peeks, 4 mo sells, of yahl on these streets
You tell the police, I post bail then bail on the chief
My mail is a speech (Like verses out koran, it's too deep)
If a weak crevy bleed ghetti, sauce he's gonna need help from
Jesus or geeznod to bless him for the spleet second
Freeze when yo beat stops, heat seeking salt rocks
(Blood hungry)
K-U double T & Tecca Neeze shocked
We'ze not yo dummies, solomon grundy gumbee props
We crocodile dundee's against rachna-pho-biancs
Kutt's awfully money hungry & zealous spocs, put it on me
I'm often watched by the phonies, got snakes and vawchers among me
Boiling, liquid, expanding, vicious, explosion, commanding war
Sink you bitch niggas Titanic extremist screaming more
I'd rather die than Bin Laden controlling common thought
Ra-sue, la-ee-yah, ohh-awk-bah, will leave you niggas shocked

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
You don't really wanna step to me

You don't really wanna fuck to me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Bounce to my hit bitch, bounce on my dick
At the club, at the crib, at the tele, in the whip
Havin' visions of incisions of Tecca Nina's collisions with
Pigeons
I'm thankful for all that pussy ya giving
And you get nothing from me
Maybe some weed and some Asti Spumante
Boucin' up and down in the bed, like we bungeed
Not Jumanji, everyone I'm tryin' to shock the monkey

[Verse 4: Kutt Calhoun]
Mo dough, mo power, mo motherfucking respect I tell ya
Focus mo on cowards the world don't stand a projected failure
Seek Absolute Power, perfect and conquer the world with it
Use at yo discretion, but knowingly at yo own risk
These times are strange
But use time to gain in my mind frame
I strive for change but I'll die for change when the time came
You betta tell 'em Tech N9ne millennium big shots
Our revelation through out the nation results in big shocks

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
You don't really wanna step to me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease
You don't really wanna step with me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease
You don't really wanna step to me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease
You don't really wanna step with me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease
You don't really wanna fuck to me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease
You don't really wanna fuck to me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease
You don't really wanna fuck to me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease
You don't really wanna fuck to me
We can do it in the street and get 'em up with ease

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
You don't want to fuck with Nino
Tech N9ne, Kutt Calhoun, Kaliko
You don't want to fuck with Nino
Tech N9ne, Kutt Calhoun, Kaliko

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, it's 'bout twelve minutes passed the hour
Hear the W-T-E-C-H radio
To all the listeners out there
You don't wanna fuck with me (ahahahahahahahahahhaha) at all
You're a god damn clown
Hold up man don't clown
