[Intro: Jamie Madrox]
(It sucks to be you)
Oh boy, we doing it bigger than a muthafucka right now, we got Glasses Malone with us
(Sucks to be you)
Krizz Kaliko in the mutherfuckin' house and if you mutherfuckas ain’t down with this shit, Krizz let they ass know
(Sucks to be you)

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Me and the terrific, with wicked Twiztid, spit it one
Now we more hated then George Zimmerman
So put your hoods up like you’re reppin' for trey van
This track sucked more the minute I came on (no it didn’t)
This is for blooded cousins loving us in dozens
And Juggalos is cheering when they hearing niggas bludgeon
You might be offended, I can’t be ended
All y'all is in Cali, they be trendin'
Caddy I’m firing the warning shot
Niggas still see I stepped it up, don’t know how warm it got
Hot, hot, hot, hot!
I’m taking it back to the days I was packing a strap
Cali’s in town, they mad they don’t know where they girlfriend at
So have a glass of suicide, a cup of shut the fuck up
You niggas made it on the radio, I guess you lucked up
But you’ll be outta here in a year and the crowd’ll boo
We get the cheers, you get the tears

[Hook: Krizz]
Sucks to be you
And its so unfair that you keep talking and no one cares
Sucks to be you
When in your end is coming, running and you do nothing
Sucks to be you
And I know y'all hate it cause we ain’t shit but we still made it
Sucks to be you
Put the gun to your face and make this world a better place

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
You can do it like this, but you’re makin' a bad decision
See I’m worse than the mob cause even the fishes are missin'
This ain’t some off the wall pill pop mission
But givin' a listen to what I’ve been giving
I’ll have you begging for what what Micheal was hittin'
I’m sickening like a man’s ass on a 50 inch
And destined to end up in a bathtub like Whitney did
But my mission is to live long and I got her shit
But I know she’s gotta be dead, butted heads, had a Chris brownie kid
I’m a lunatic in a zombie wig
Sweeney Todd couldn’t dream
Of the nightmares that I've been followed with
Like lobsters fuckin' ostriches
It’s preposterous to think you got a fuckin' shot to stop this

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
Cool it, all these niggas need to cool it
Cause I’m on while they spent a lifetime tryin' to do this
Sixes, I don't even fuck with dueces
Ruthless and ain’t a nigga breathin' gonna refute it
Fooled it, stanky heart until he proved it
Nice plus I’m ‘bout that life so yeah I used to move it
Ask the Crips, ask the Bloods, ask the [?], ask the Hoovers
About Glasses Logan gettin’ looped up
Get this bitch to nooch you, let it revel, bet that lie
Hey I’m thug until I die, bitch it’s seventh street for life
Tossers said hi till they sever off my head
Poser motherfucker you could never understand
Try and beef with me you pussy niggas are dead men
I’m ready for whatever, hundred guns, hundred bands
And I'mma keep it hundred till I’m hunted down and lynched
And since she’ll take em out, I can’t give my bitch an antic

[Hook]
