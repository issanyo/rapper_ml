[Chorus]
Watch yo mouth when you're talking to me
I'll knock you out (C'mon! C'mon!) Piece definitely
I hold it (Down) for my block, for my hood, for my sector
Look at what ya mouth got ya, niggas should've held it (down)
Watch ya mouth or you might get hit in it
One piece two piece dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (Down)
This is for the niggas from my section
Hope you learned the lesson
Bully niggas better hold it (down)

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Left, right, right, left, he's toothless
Not Cube but the Big homie's ruthless
With my two fists I can move this
And bout to prove that I can move it with my true spit
I'm locked and loaded I'm ready I'm heavy, lyrics so steady
This for the block Big homie 'bout to get it, mayne
It's time to get it my nigga, my villains spit it my nigga
And if you feel it my nigga then throw a villain, mayne
Veteran now bustin' with my strange cats
Krizzy Kali, Tecca Neez and my nigga Skat
Chasin' paper my nature we 'bout to sew up the nation
We keep it real while you fakin' now how you love that
Rather scrappin' and rappin' see I'm attacking the action
Big homie makin' it happen now shake it shake it, girl
That pussy poppin' and clappin' now I be tossing your cabbage
And you be watching the savage so come and get it girl

[Chorus]
Watch yo mouth when you're talking to me
I'll knock you out (C'mon! C'mon!) Piece definitely
I hold it (Down) for my block, for my hood, for my sector
Look at what ya mouth got ya, niggas should've held it (down)
Watch ya mouth or you might get hit in it
One piece two piece dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (Down)
This is for the niggas from my section
Hope you learned the lesson
Bully niggas better hold it (down)

[Verse 2: Joe Vertigo]
Watch me as I rock through the pain, I walk through the flames, insane
With lyrical scatter and spit that'll splatter your brain
I'm tired of chatters get choppers to rattle your frame
We inn like Wendy's it's my way we robbin' the game
I'm throwin' them thangs, I swang with the pain, deranged
To vertical murders sho' dumpin' on niggas with Strange
Ring the alarm, the heavy fuckin' hitters on
My patients will scorn the heavy fuckin' spitters on
I'm postin' wit Tech, I'm postin' with G's in the back
My swagger so mean wit the mini machine on my back
For violence I fiend, I move with a team as a crack
Go loco for rojo, I put that mozzle to your back
And take you on a walk you won't come back from
I take you to the other side of the black sun
(If you disrespect, you'll die to regret it)
Ya fuckin' right Joe Vertigo said it that's for your mouth
Yeah

[Chorus]
Watch yo mouth when you're talking to me
I'll knock you out (C'mon! C'mon!) Piece definitely
I hold it (Down) for my block, for my hood, for my sector
Look at what ya mouth got ya, niggas should've held it (down)
Watch ya mouth or you might get hit in it
One piece two piece dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (Down)
This is for the niggas from my section
Hope you learned the lesson
Bully niggas better hold it (down)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Punks run up when I'm wit a bitch, mumbling bumpin' some shit
Talkin' bout rap when just bickin' it
Chump, I don't do battles and this rap will outshadow your spit
Nothing's compatible with this wickedness
When I'm eatin' some niggas just keep peepin'
I guess they just heat seekin' when it come off with disrespectful talk
You geeks weak and the Nina's the beast chief
And you heathens ain't street deep
So keep beefin' and get yo head tore off
So dem scram for sight of thee grim hand, the fight'll begin bamb these niggas is rose peddle soft
It's ten grand to rock with me
Him stand like he ought to be Tin man
The gorillas'll blow his kettle off
With Big Scooby Joe Vertigo shit's groovy
With Kali Big Nick truly nobody is gettin' through quis
You get woozie then outti, then out of your head through you hit through you derowdied and shit, who beat 'em down and issued a 2 piece

[Chorus]
Watch yo mouth when you're talking to me
I'll knock you out (C'mon! C'mon!) Piece definitely
I hold it (Down) for my block, for my hood, for my sector
Look at what ya mouth got ya, niggas should've held it (down)
Watch ya mouth or you might get hit in it
One piece two piece dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (Down)
This is for the niggas from my section
Hope you learned the lesson
Bully niggas better hold it (down)

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
You wanna battle me battle me
All that blabberin' that'll be causin' you cavity givin' you agony agony chatterin' that'll be the reason for your batterin'
Screamin' loud but you niggas ain't matterin'
(Already warned you)
That I can give it to you with singin' rappin'
Don't think I can't be clappin' at your habitat
(If I harm you)
Then you must be weak and be frequently gettin' beat in the seat and plus you a faggot now
Now (Down) how many MC's must get dissed
Before they all know don't fuck with Krizz
See I'm a boss boy, fuck around with hog style the deuce click with Strange and get tossed boy
When I'm off of that oil, spoil the whole night for niggas that came to fight, I'm like fuckin' with Kali, it might be trouble
(Look away)
Here come the Kansas City Shuffle

[Chorus]
Watch yo mouth when you're talking to me
I'll knock you out (C'mon! C'mon!) Piece definitely
I hold it (Down) for my block, for my hood, for my sector
Look at what ya mouth got ya, niggas should've held it (down)
Watch ya mouth or you might get hit in it
One piece two piece dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (Down)
This is for the niggas from my section
Hope you learned the lesson
