[Intro: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Yo Stink, help me give em a taste of KABOSH, man
Yeah hahaha right about now, me see a whole heap a people inna the crowd
So I come like a international ting where I deal with
It's time to party all night long
Yeah [?] them tunes that come out out of your stereo
Boss I'll make you blow
Make you up so international
[?] personnel
Dedicated to all the party people around the world
Ayo Stink tell 'em what this song is about mayne
No need to sweary to those out of their mind and
Work five years are weak
Tech N9ne and Stink it is real

[Verse 1: Tech n9ne]
It's Friday night and I, got my check man I
Damn I really need a (PARTY!)
So when the weekend come, I'm tryin' to get deep in some
(ALL NIGHT ALL DAY!)
Tryin' to break the monotony, get away from my property
Ain't no way that you stoppin' me, at a party I got to be
But the check was a shock to me, that won't let my velocity slow
Wanna party with me let me know
We party 'cause we in pain, we party to celebrate
To keep from goin' insane, we party just to escape
No matter how much the cost, regardless of what it takes
You call my phone and it's off I'm tryin' to numb the mistakes
But if you fell like you chill put yo cups up
But if you ill about yo bills and it's just touch
Take a drink but don't spill, this ain't no time to be still
Fuck the world what you know and realize shit is real

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Saturday night and I, still got some check man I
Damn I really need a (PARTY!)
Now that the weekends here, it's time for the cheefin' and beer
(ALL NIGHT ALL DAY!)
Whether you puff or you're drinkin', when life is tough we go seekin'
Somethin' to thrust or go deep in, work is rough with no freakin'
So we lustfully speakin', girl you what's up for the weekend?
Plan a trip to Las Vegas, a room at the Venetian
Let's go
We party 'cause we in pain, we party to celebrate
To keep from goin' insane, we party just to escape
No matter how much the cost, regardless of what it takes
If you're found or you're lost, hey baby these are the breaks
But if you good it's understood that you prosperous
We from the hood and drinkin' good means a lot to us
Put away yo knife and yo steel, have some fun and you'll feel
Like a shield has been lifted, yet and still shit is real

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real
Shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real, shit is real

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Sunday night and I, blew my check man I
Damn I really wanna (PARTY!)
Now that the weekends done, I'm tryin' to sleep in some
(ALL NIGHT! ALL DAY!)
Hey yo this songs for the strong, not for the backboneless
Workers who don't make enough for they own but give to the homeless atonement
For the wrong that has grown strong for the long
Spent time for dimes, you better take advantage of this moment yo
We party 'cause we in pain, we party to celebrate
To keep from goin' insane, we party just to escape
No matter how much the cost, regardless of what it takes
Never put your trust in the state, they not controllin' yo fate
But if you made it, then I'll say you did yo thang today
But if you lost it, then I'll say party yo pain away
Do your job for your skrill, don't lose control of the will
It's Sunday night but on Monday realize shit is real
