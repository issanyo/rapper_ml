[Intro: Gianni Ca$h]
Uh-huh, okay, light it!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Wake up in the morning, hit the porch and puff a doobie
Wake and baking got me coughing up a lugie
Make a quick mimosa, now I'm feeling kinda groovy
Got to find that chick that got the biggest booty
But she got to have the facial features of Karrueche
Easy sex, she got the diamonds in the coochie
Get me girls to gift to guys to grip and give them Gucci
Living lavish, looking loving lot of Luchi
Got to give a shout out to my other mother Ruby
That's because she's always been an angel to me
Plus I wanna give one to my O.G. brother Scoobie
Packed a punch that'd make a sucka nigga woozy
Loving leaf and liquor ever since I was a juvie
Now I need another, no, I'm not a newbie
Smoking reefer with the darker nigga from the Luniz
Piece of hotter head is stuck off in her booties

[Pre-Hook: Tech N9ne]
Got them vape toys
That creates joy
Such a great choice
Wake and bake, boy

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(Wake and bake!)
When I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Puffiing on the loud, we gon' make the clouds bigger!
(Wake and bake!)
Gotta get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Oh no, no, no, no, can't sleep! I got the "ooh" weed, ah!

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Open up my eyes and eat some roaches for my breakfast
Don't know where I am 'cause lately I been living reckless
Dig 'em out the ashtray, smoke 'em 'till I'm breathless
Soaking up the high and try to focus on my next shit
Toking on that lion 'till I spot other dimensions
Fuck a GPS, my dude too high to get reception
I been on a mission, just to get us all that necklace
Hitting every city with the motherfucking vengeance
Maybe it's in excess, maybe it's expected
Maybe you can blame it on material possessions
When I'm getting high it's when I tell you my direction
But if it's up to me I'd rather lie and give y'all guessing
Every single morning I'm just smoking on my blessings
Mix a little coffee with my cannabis and exit
I know it's infectious, a spiritual connection
I get when I wake up and turn into the smoking session

[Pre-Hook: Tech N9ne]
Got them vape toys
That creates joy
Such a great choice
Wake and bake, boy

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(Wake and bake!)
When I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Puffing on the loud, we gon' make the clouds bigger!
(Wake and bake!)
When I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Oh no, no, no, don't sleep! I got the "ooh" weed!

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Waking up, I'm baking blunts, I'm going, somebody stop me
I fly my definitions higher than Hitachi
Last night I was drinking, got my thinking kinda choppy
My girl came over knocking, calling out for papi
Fly as Nicaragua and dressed in Louie and Versace
I bent her over and I fried her like hibachi
Feeling high and cocky, balling out like Bocci
She brought a friend who had a tight end, Jeremy Shockey
Matter fact, the volcano was loaded up and locky
Vaporized the weed and dropping treats like we were Rocky
All the brothers bringing over trees was kinda sloppy
But Â¡Mayday!'s packing pens that's got your friends acting like zombies
Nakatomi Nazis, die and hard to proxy
But fuck a middleman, you know that Joanie only Chachi's
Rappers's butts are pressing us to snooze, bitch, watch me
Wake and bake and take it to the face like paparazzi

[Pre-Hook: Tech N9ne]
Got them vape toys
That creates joy
Such a great choice
Wake and bake, boy

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
(Wake and bake!)
When I get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Puffing on the loud, we gon' make the clouds bigger!
(Wake and bake!)
I said I gotta get up, I gotta keep the lit up, my nigga!
(Wake and bake!)
Oh no, no, no, no, don't see! I got the "oh" weed, my nigga!
