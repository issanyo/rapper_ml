[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I know y'all don't see me on TV
Or hear me on the radio
But you industry brats
Better check billboard and polestar
Before y'all get to cryin'
About who get seniority at these shows
Especially when compared to me
Y'all ain't shit on stage

[Hook]
I hit the stage, grab the mic
And blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
The gig is over, the gig is over (Bitty bye-bye)
The gig is over, the gig is over when (Ayy, play)
The kid is older and gettin' colder (Many fly by)
But his will hold you, so listen closer to
A-A-R-O-N, they dissin' and twistin' my name
Because Aaron is scarin' these glitz spittin' pricks in the game
Hit with this gift, everybody get a whiff of this script and it's pain
Gotta talk about the people with a attitude who
Hiss me and slipped in my lane
I've been wrecking crowds for a long second now
Got 'em guessin' how Tech is blessed
And yes, the best in-town rep
On the real, I keep it trill and when I spit
I ain't spillin' 'bout my million, it's the feeling that you get
With this underground headliner, mainstream ignored a bro
And they be petty, so jealousy is sure to show
But they rich and got more to blow and every thing's affordable
But they gotta go before me because their stage show is horrible

[Hook]
I hit the stage, grab the mic
And blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
They may be platinum, but they know
I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)

Why you do me like that girl?
You know, I love your mama

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I just wanted to have a bite with her or somethin'
Didn't go get up on that show to fight with her or nothin'
It was Keyshia Cole, Eric Ben√©t, Gorilla Zoe, Tech N9na and T.I
But Keyshia was actin' bia-bia
Why she actin' like a (What?), like a (What?)
She ain't know I grab the mic and light it (Up), light it (Up)
She say, "She don't know me"
But I'm the number one independent in the country
Man, she the only one actin' funky
And the people at the summer jam, they want me
She say, "she ain't going on before somebody that's local"
And she went postal and loco, saying, "her not closing, is a no-go"
Down talked me real low though
About how she got more doe and just did a TV promo
No show better than the MO bro with the S and M logo
Damn baby, much success is sittin' in your favor
Slam the N9na Tech before considerin' the data
Fans waited, so we went, so she'd get it for later
But Frankie said, "Excuse my daughter, she's a bit of a hater"
Dwamn!

[Hook]
I hit the stage, grab the mic
And blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
They may be platinum, but they know
I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Ayy, ayy, check it, I understand seniority
But in this case, on this show, I'm a top priority
In Lawrence, you're minority and I'm the majority
Check it, I was young and broke
But i'd fetch it, if it was freshest
Shoveled snow for the Eric B. and Rakim record
Promoters called us and said
"We got this show and want you to close us"
Ghostface and Brother Ali rockin' with a band in 'Sota
We couldn't wait to see Rakim rock, but he never ever showed up
He swole up 'cause he didn't wanna go up before us
Man, what's wrong with these people?
Think that the world gotta kiss their asses
500 capacity but you wanna get 200 passes
Thought it was about Gouda, 40-Watter told me
"N9na, get your cabbage, stay savage and ravage the average"
Y'all better hope radio and video
Keep me from slithering into they circle
I'll change it, that's why they shivering
Rakim the god? he just miss the king's delivering
'Cause they know they'll fall
And I'll blow them all to smithereens

[Hook]
I hit the stage, grab the mic
And blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
They may be platinum, but they know
I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)
(Superstars) But they know I blow 'em all away, hey
(I blow 'em all away, I blow 'em all away)

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Real, real spill, yeah, baby girl
I know I ain't the only one that know you could be bitchy
You know what I'm sizzlin'?
Ol' boy, I know I ain't the only one that know you could be bitchy
Do your research before you down somebody else
Get off your high horse
Keyshia Cole, get off your high horse
Rakim, get off your high horse
Industry, get off your high horse
Yeah
