[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Remember your brother, your father, your cousin, your friend
Life ain't over now, matter of fact it's just began
I'm on a mission, this is just the way it had to be
Can't be mad at me 'cause I'm tryin' to feed my family

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
When ya think of me, picture the sad little boy
Ya know that's trapped in a grown man
And when ya picture me, see me in the world
Full of fans alone and far from his homeland
Cryin' in repetition, feedin' his family
Bein' the definition of hardcore
And tryna be what you expected out of me
Gotta be proud of me without slavin' over an hourly
I know it's feelin' like I've vanished in the dark
Keep tamperin' with what I'm so enamored within this heart
Gotta come better, be better than the average competitor
When I'm impressin' the press and execs, etcetera
It's lookin' like it's easy, but it easily eats at me
People need a piece of me, but home is where I need to be
If you lookin' for me and don't see me
Just leave your loved ones for months
And see who still wants to be me

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
If you wake up and I'm not there
Cry for me, 'cause damn it, I swear
Nothing ever can stand between us but time (rewind)
If you wake up and I'm long gone
Close your eyes, and play my song
Nothing ever could stand between us but time (rewind)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
If I could re-re-rewind time, I would de-beast me
Have you be-be-behind N9ne baby, 'cause I'm crazy
Did dirt to a kind lady, at first you were mine, maybe
That hurt you that lyin' baby
'Cause I was gone in physical and gone in spirit, gone
Mentally long gone, long enough for a nigga to get near it
Now when you come home, some other John is your dearest
I put a million on it that you thinkin' of me when he rear it
That's cool though, rappin' shouldn't make you let your boo go
Especially when the man is working to get you dough
Back then I was strugglin' baby, now it's a new show
Instead of a Maybach I guess you prefer a Peugeot
At night you're callin' my name, and drive him insane
Incredible pain, you got with no monetary gain
I'm sorry, baby, that's comin' from the heart of the N9ne
I know you're thinking about me at this moment
Wishing you could just rewind

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
If you wake up and I'm not there
Cry for me, 'cause damn it, I swear
Nothing ever can stand between us but time (rewind)
If you wake up and I'm long gone
Close your eyes, and play my song
Nothing ever could stand between us but time (rewind)

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Bet you wish I could just rewind time
And just work a 9-5, wouldn't have found N9ne
Could've just found time
To kick it with all who that I've neglected
And find my place, a blank face, and I'm off this space
'Cause I can't get it right, get it right
Everybody I know be steadily mad at me
'Cause they be callin' me, ringin' my phone
Wanna know what's the matter with me when I'm traveling
I could just put the whole city behind me
Never let anyone find me
Drop off the face of the Earth, my vacation hurts 'em the worst
Rap or die!
Yeah, explain it to my wife
Why daddy gotta go bye bye, live out his dreams so bye bye
And dry-y the eye, eye of my son and tell him why
Daddy been gone so long, only seein' him off and on
And tuck him in for me
Maybe when I get back then he'll remember me
And cry for me, the big guy who had me and gladly'd die for me
And why you sittin' idly wonderin' what's inside of me
Rewind the times when you kicked it right along side of me

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
If you wake up and I'm not there
Cry for me, 'cause damn it, I swear
Nothing ever can stand between us but time (rewind)
If you wake up and I'm long gone
Close your eyes, and play my song
Nothing ever could stand between us but time (rewind)
