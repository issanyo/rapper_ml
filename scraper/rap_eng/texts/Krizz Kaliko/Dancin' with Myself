[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Feelin’ like I want someone to tangle with me
The whole wide world don’t know me
So my whole label lookin’ at me
Knowing I'm the GENIUS
People lend me a ear I said that I’m the GENIUS
Just so I made it clear
Came boxin’ me, unboxable
Top the untoppable
Impossible, from more popular we be way more profitable
B.E.A.T. obstacles, see me, pay me, gotta get the dough
And I wait to the left, I’ve never been a didle
So I don’t get the riddles, this had better be all
Check, cause I ain’t reached my pinnacle yet
And if they too sentimental then jet cause everything up in the way was disrespectful
So check for me, I’m the one with the crazy hair
Dancin’ by myself, you don’t understand me then leave me there

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
If they don’t understand my music
And no one else is dancing to it
I’m dancing with my self
Dancing with my self
And I’m a little hard to swallow
Cause what they do I do not follow
I’m dancing with my self
Dancing with my self

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
How you make it when you’re fat, black and you rap, whack
To the naked ear, 11 years
And I never even shoulda made it here
When you a freak of nature they hate ya
Stacks of paper can save you, and take the chance that they gave you
These ranger labels will slave you but Trav and Nina
Saw a chance to stack they green up
Tech's hittin first then Kali's battin clean up
You are something else
A record deal, it was summer y’all and sit on the shelf
And was sippin’ something soapy next to a sexual cause my wealth
But only a handful of you follow me, and I gotta be godly
And how they babble me, cause I'm an oddity I can see poverty
And I’m left of center, I’m out to lunch, I’m out to dinner
I’m the best the world has ever had
If you don’t get me, too bad
That if

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Oh my God
Oh my goodness
This business is so ri-cock-ulous
The whole industry watchin us
We don’t fit in, and if you listen close and dose it in
Cause we supposed to be, the poster boys
The total time of me in this economy
I don’t wanna defuse this for coopin if you’re snoopin through the sound scan
Think I’m floppin, stupid you sound man
But I march to the beat of my own drum
And I can only make it so dumb, so I’m dancin by my lonesome

[Hook]
