[Intro]
Kali Baby

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Mouthpiece good enough to catch yea, alright
But she's way to hot for me
Must drive her crazy when I touch her, alright
'Cause I'm way too ugly
And I'm to nice and I'm to gentle
I make her [?], I make her mental
And I might drink a little but it's worth it
Don't love me like I love her so, I guess she don't deserve it
But uh

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She said she love me, but she really wants a bad man
I can be bad a little, but I can't be that man (oh!)
B-Boy Baller what she need to make her day
She chasing all of them boys away except for I- I
She said she love me, but she really wants a bad man
I really feel her so I be as bad as I can
She definitely need a rude boy in her world
I'm feelin' it [?] cost you too much
Look in her eye you see dollar signs
Look in her eye you see dollar signs
No bad man you don't qualify
I'm not a man then who am I?

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
I like it slow, she like it fast
It's duck and go like a foot on the gas
She got them [?] on her
[?] kinda I wanna
Steady pick up at her, the feelin' when I'm up it hurts (woo)
Her way or no way
She want a soldier, what can I say?
My love don't buy her Chanel
A gold digger far as I can tell, but she got that (oohh)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She said she love me, but she really wants a bad man
I can be bad a little, but I can't be that man (oh!)

[Verse 3: Oobergeek]
Yo, you are blind all he wants from you is vagina, 'gina (oh)
I know you won't find the finer things in life are
Put it behind ya, shine yea
Shine ya lighter brighter then I might have been a half pint
But I got a gallon for the love inside it
I ain't saying I'm soft, I ain't saying I'm off
I ain't saying I'm boss neither
But I'm paying a call to nights like this, when we priceless
You can get all of me for free instead of chasing G's
With unnecessary baggage fees
Place your baggage where you grabbed 'em right next to the savage that you thought was above average
There's an empty heart, have it
You laughing like I didn't ask you, but I gotta understand
That the man that's bad is your humble habitat and
If you say you wanted a rude boy, I can be rude, but I [?]
Your mysterious love me so hard to fathom
Momma raised me to treat a lady like a lady
But it's cool if you want dudes to treat you shady
You can have 'em
