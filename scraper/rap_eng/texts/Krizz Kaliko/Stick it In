[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I just wanna stick it in
I know it sounds sickening
Bet I make it feel good
I put that on the Vill' hood
Get up on this and you bouncing
You know my youth is the fountain
Do this right and I'm announcing
You will be counting money mountains
'Cause they give a lot of paper
To the one that move the shakers
You will accumulate haters
When they find they women wanna taste ya
I'ma be the biggest
Thing up in ya cranium I give it
To you when you want it, I can dig it
Haters they be livid
'Cause I'm 'bout to get it all
She want the Tech, T want the neck
Bouncing I stretch and I flex
What I possess is a threat
Those who ain't with me upset
'Cause I get it wet
Yeah

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They don't be talking 'bout nothing
You know I know
I be pushing them buttons
And I give it to you
We don't need no discussion
I don't be fronting
I know what they want
Take what I got and put it in your head
I just wanna stick it in your head
Let me put it in your head
I just wanna stick it in your head
Now let me stick it in (yep)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
People really think it's evil
When I put it up in the cerebral cortex
Your bet is to know I am making galore chicks
Wanna be giving me even more sex (Ay)
Up up in the whore nest (Ay)
Better give it your best (Ay)
'Cause I'm gonna absorb it
Of course I got the force to put the bitches in orbit (Ay)
Each one wanna have a D one
When the beat drums stick it where they pee from
Become a Tecca Nina legion
Wishing my D up in the V giving me some
'Cause I'm driving 'em crazy
When I'm rappin' amazing, I'm having the ladies
Thinking they want Nina stabbing the labia
I'm so good, they want to be having a baby
T fetish, she get it and be wantin' me to wet it
He regretted he fed it wishing that he never ever let it in
I am the medicine
You hating don't you do that again
Ain't nobody better than Tech Nina
Baby your head is spent, go take Excedrin (Excedrin)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They don't be talking 'bout nothing
You know I know
I be pushing them buttons
And I give it to you
We don't need no discussion
I don't be fronting
I know what they want
Take what I got and put it in your head
I just wanna stick it in your head
Let me put it in your head
I just wanna stick it in your head
Now let me stick it in (yep)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
See me cometh
She got it in but her friends let him in 'cause I sin
When they wanna flee from it
Then with a grin I begin to get in to the skin
With the pen then again I be winning a friend
Wanna spin Tech and 'em be the creme de la creme
With the gems look at him he pretends to be zen
When his grim hella dim swinging limbs for the brims
Shit, I don't wanna say nothing else
But, my rhythm make your lady fucking melt
Nuts, know that Nina and they know the wealth
What, and what they want is right below the belt (Out)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They don't be talking 'bout nothing
You know I know
I be pushing them buttons
And I give it to you
We don't need no discussion
I don't be fronting
I know what they want
Take what I got and put it in your head
I just wanna stick it in your head
Let me put it in your head
I just wanna stick it in your head
Now let me stick it in (yep)
