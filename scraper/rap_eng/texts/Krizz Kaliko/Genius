[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
1-9-74 was the year mommy and daddy had created a monster
The funny looking kid from the suburbs
And referred as genius cause nobody wants ta'
Cook up a musical recipe, left it to me
So I'mma effin' give it what I got left of me
Cause if I left it up to y'a-all
Most of yall would probably drop the ba-all
I be raping these records lately, and yall ain't trying
You say celibate, but I ain't buying
No we can't baby baby
That crazy world maybe maybe
And dont be caring they hate me
And if you staring it maybe-be-be
Blinding, cause I'm a supernova, I'm shining
The tippy-top is where I'm residing
So if I gotta Rescue Ranger it, picture painter it
Whoops! I left my stain in it (I AM!)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Genius
Genius (I am)
Genius (Don't you know my nigga)
Genius (Don't you know my nigga)

[Bridge 1]
Take this session as a blessing
His confession, keep 'em guessing
He's the best in his profession
He's professin', learn the lesson

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
If E equals mc (squared)
I'm an MC (square)
No comparison (stare)
I'm a therapist
Dare you to listen
Now pay attention
How can I mention, your music paralysis!?
Beckon 'em, (Come here!)
Lyrically I'm checkin' 'em
Tellin' 'em (Get over here!)
Way too far too left on 'em
The best since my conception
Put ya antennas at my direction!
Give me an inch in a lead and it's over
I've been a sidekick, now I'm taking over
Never believed that a team, me could lead 'em
Now they salute when they see 'im (I am!)

[Hook]
Genius
Genius (I am)
Genius (Don't you know my nigga)
Genius (Don't you know my nigga)

[Bridge 2]
I've been different all my life for a reason
Waiting to attack in my season
And I'mma be here, never leavin'
This is the reason I'm breathing

[Bridge 1]
Take this session as a blessing
His confession, keep 'em guessing
He's the best in his profession
He's professin', learn the lesson

[Hook]
Genius
Genius (I am)
Genius (Don't you know my nigga)
