[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
She keep switchin' that ass and she know she playin'
Lick her lips when she walk past, she know she playin'
Bad as hell, I know, she must have a man
I got to have you's what I'm sayin'
She gotta be the baddest, marital status don't matter
Hit it like a batter and dickin' up in her bladder
She begin to chatter, the way that I'm comin' at her
Too many get the number, get at her a little louder and I
Up there like I lock her down and hope she stayin'
I got to have you's what I'm sayin'

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'd kill for your lovin'
(Say it) I will for your lovin'
(Tell me) What to do with my lovin'
(Nothin') I won't do for your lovin'
Now give it up to me
I'd kill for your lovin'
(Say it) I will for your lovin'
(Tell me) What to do with my lovin'
(Nothin') I won't do for your lovin'
Give it up to me

[Verse 2: Crystal Watson]
He tryin' to holla-ho-holla, no, he trippin'
But he got them kinda lips that was made for kissin'
Maybe he packin' and he got somethin' with him
I think I'm goin' with him
He gotta be a winner and gotta take me to dinner
And he ain't going in her if he ain't gonna deliver
I never let him enter if baby is a beginner
Cause this'll be the tender to put you off in a blender
He's like a player and got a lot of women
I don't care, I'm goin' with him

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Your man ain't no problem, off him, it's automatic
His hands, Iâ€™ll take you up off them, it's automatic
I'll come, call me, it's automatic
You know I gots to have it
And I've been
Focused on pokin' you on a regular-regular
Ready to take at any competitor (I'll stalk you)
And ain't nobody better that can piddly-diddle your middle make you bout to piddle a little (I got you)
She can make me do the fool and I ain't playin'
I gots to have you's what I'm sayin'

[Hook]
