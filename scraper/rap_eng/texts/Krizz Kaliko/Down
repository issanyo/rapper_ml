[Intro]
I just wanna party, I don't wanna go down, down, down

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Too much of anything'll kill ya
We do what we want to do when home gets too familiar
Drink like a Russian, eat like a glutton
Bang a different slut but hell, it don't mean nothin'
Put the music on, dance, who you answer to? Damn it you
If you believe then stop it less you plan to be flammable
You find a tramp stamp, and plant one off in her mandibles
And open up a can on her and hope she's a cannibal
Well (And) I feel no consequence with you
(Rap) be no competition with
(Offish) niggas is wishin' to switch into your position (Okay)
And I'm hopin' that it ain't so
Cause if it's fiery pits below, I ain't tryin' to go

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See I don't mean to live my life this way
Like my granny used to say
It's just the devil, baby
And I don't mean to do the things I do
What done gotten into you?
It's just the devil, baby
I smoke, I drink, I do too much
I act like I don't give a (hey!, hey!)
Stop me from my wicked ways and turn my life around
I just wanna party, I don't wanna go down, down, down

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, Kali the ticket to kick it
But I party with the Nina he ain't got many limits
And as a youngster I used to know Nathan (Nathan)
Now I don't go as hard on the liquor, and I cut back on the bacon
But I'm quick to anger, I feel like the Coathanga Strangla
And I'm hanging with gangbangers a lot
Tryna maintain me to make it to Shangri-La
With a life full of fun, with a knife and a gun
For the lives of my wife and my son
And I might be the one
To warn ya, maybe too late, nothing I can do for ya (Okay)
Kali's a misfit, hang with nitwit nimrods
They kiss lips, dick on thin broads
They work in strip clubs and serve drinks with they bras on
Get out or go down (down), with gasoline draws off

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See I don't mean to live my life this way
Like my granny used to say
It's just the devil, baby
And I don't mean to do the things I do
What done gotten into you?
It's just the devil, baby
I smoke, I drink, I do too much
I act like I don't give a (hey!, hey!)
Stop me from my wicked ways and turn my life around
I just wanna party, I don't wanna go down, down, down

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I got lots of mischief in my pocket
Flocks of bitches quick to jock it
Optimistic with the thought they hopping this
The wicked bosses, often lifted, it's the saucy
Lost in this shit, just get off it
In the hottest pits he walk it
I miss Molly
I can feel it in my body
I've been giving the women
The venom within 'em
A nigga just wanna parlay
Guess my life is awkward, drunk fucking like clock work
Hand right up a fox skirt, always on a twat search
But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna
They say I'mma keep living this way, then I'm a goner
But if they take my soul, then I go, below
I take the Devil's bitches, then I stick it in her hole

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See I don't mean to live my life this way
Like my granny used to say
It's just the devil, baby
And I don't mean to do the things I do
What done gotten into you?
It's just the devil, baby
I smoke, I drink, I do too much
I act like I don't give a (hey!, hey!)
Stop me from my wicked ways and turn my life around
I just wanna party, I don't wanna go down, down, down
