[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]:
I keep feeling footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark
Why I keep feeling footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]:
Scoob
Footsteps all duck his name was journey left
I'm outta breath and I confess I'm preferring death
Too much weight on my shoulders as I'm getting older
Pull out the mower mow my grass
Snakes is getting closer
Feeling the host ready to bang like a nigga 'posed ta
But its darker than my heart I'm torn with emotion
It's hard to function through this punk shit on a daily basis
A game of trumps but the chumps holding all the aces
Cause my laces make em tight and I'm back in the fight
Lightning strikes and its clear im supposed to lose the fight
This my life i ain't crying I'm just going through it
Past my prime if its time nigga lets get to it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]:
I keep feeling footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark
Why I keep feeling footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark

[Verse 2: Blind Fury]:
All the people I call my equal try to play me close
I can't see em but I can hear em like they may be ghosts
In the game its a lot of phonies it's some shady folks
So I raise a toast take a minute and praise for those
And as for the relationships i built along the way
It's sad to say but most of them people is gone today
But what don't kill you be the shit that make you stronger hey
So I read the scripture listen to what my momma say
The other day I dropped 200 on the half a zip
Tryna decide if I should smoke or would i rather flip
I'm losing homies to the game and they gone rather quick
Its like they hearing disappear call it a magic trick
It's a god gift my style and my grace
So people don't talk shit they smile in my face
Just know that I'm gon flip
Get wild in this place
And know we gon rep Hogstyle in this place

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]:
I keep feeling footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark
Why I keep feeling footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]:
Just waking up in the morning
Got to thank god
I don't know why every day gotta be so hard
Anxieties inside of me
I try to disregard it and stay far from a nigga
In case a nigga try to pull my heart
Feel like I'm staring into the game from the sideline
Ain't coming for a minute just to get picked up for our primetime
Nickel play the nine
It's my lifeline
I'm tryna stay in gods graces
Devil make me feel like I'm lying
I'm sleeping like I'm in Seattle it's a constant battle
I keep getting knocked off the horse like it ain't got a saddle
Sometimes I feel the reaper standing right behind me
A grown ass man still calling from my mommy
I'm knowing it feel it like I can avoid it
If there's a chicken exit I'm all for it
I'm Kali baby though maybe so
Feel like I haven't got little left
Wish I was death I'm hearing footsteps
Yes

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]:
I keep feeling footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark
Why I keep feeling footsteps baby
In the dark
Oh in the dark
