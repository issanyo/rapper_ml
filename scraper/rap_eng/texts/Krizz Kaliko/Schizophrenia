[Intro]
She’s a beast in the morning, sweet in at the night
We don't speak in the morning, freakin' at night
She’s a beast in the morning, freak-freakin' at night
I like it, I like it like it (this is dumb)

[Verse 1]
I wanna love you forever, that’s why we’re still together
Why you be trippin' so much? You make it tougher than leather
See one minute you love it, then the next one you hate it
You like to argue with a nigga, I’ll be participating
See you sweet as a donut, then you flip and you go nuts
You always trippin' with somebody, if you don't it's a bonus
You keep it peaceful but evil, you can’t be yelling at people
Sometimes I think I should move on
I should just go on and just leave you
Don’t try to tell me nothing, you just be fussin' and cussin' me out
Don’t understand what all the fussin' about
Open the door and get the W out
But you were thinkin' 'fore you get to speakin' that you got a foot in yo mouth
I don’t understand if you was putting me out
Will I be losing? I think it's rude of you to got no scruple about
We get to damn near duking it out
Look here I love you
But that’s the kind of love I can definitely do without
'Cause um…

[Hook]
You love is like schizophrenia
And I be like a-ya-ya-ya
Don’t know what done got into ya
And baby I try-ya-ya-ya
You love is like schizophrenia
And I be like a-ya-ya-ya
I’ll be your straitjacket, hold you tight
Maybe then you’ll be alright now
You make me mad, you make me
You make me (cray cray) crazy
You make me mad, you make me
Make me say (this is dumb)
This is-is what I'm talkin' about
Delivery… love you
This is-is what I'm talkin' about
Delivery… love you

[Verse 2]
Broke up and got back together, we can handle the weather
Sometimes I think I’m in love with you, sometimes I’m like whatever
'Cause you’re hot and you’re cold, and your fussing get old
You can’t stand the sight of me but still it’s love that you show
'Cause you the baddest thing walkin'
And the maddest thing talkin'
You make the ugliest faces even when I be jokin'
I can’t stay with you for nothing, only a crazy man would
But I still can never leave you
'Cause you look…
Good in an act when you been breaking my back
You give it to me, give it to me
I ain’t giving it back
Get a text from my ex wondering what's up with that
And I reminisce of messin'/beatin' up the kitty cat
Seen her pic and pick my tongue off the floor
Then I wish that Crystal would walk out the door
Do her thing and just about ready to go
But she kiss me, now I can’t leave for sho'
And you know

[Hook]

Maybe then you’ll be alright now
You make me mad, you make me
You make me (cray cray) crazy
You make me mad, you make me

Delivery… love you
This is-is what I'm talkin' about
Delivery… love you
