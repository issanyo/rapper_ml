[Verse 1: Prozak]
A hot summer night
I was in my bed
I couldn't sleep a wink
Just laid awake instead
I slipped out the sheets careful not to wake her up
Insomniac restless got me shaken up
I walked down the hallway and out the front door
Took a seat on the steps of my front porch
The rain was cooling bouncing heavy off that concrete
Lightning lit the sky and thunder crashed around me
I saw a man on the corner in the pouring rain
I'm thinking homeless, hopeless or just insane
I called out to him sir can I help you
No reply he was motionless, statue
I started walking down the sidewalk to approach him
Dressed in black and he stood taller than most men
His trench coat stood still though the wind blows
Déjà vu premonitions innuendos
The car passing by
The headlights lit his face
Knew you from somewhere, somebody, someplace
I've seen you before at the hospital
My family was crying you were smiling when you passed us all
My uncle died that night
And now I'm looking back
There was a thunderstorm yeah and you were dressed in black
Vivid thoughts and memories came to light, come to think about it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I realize all the time it was you
Only Christ it can save me from you
If it's a nightmare waiting for you
What can I do that will save me from you
I realize all the time it was you
Only Christ it can save me from you
If it's a nightmare waiting for you
What can I do that will save me from you

[Verse 2: Prozak]
I looked into his eyes and I saw genocide
I seen world wars and mass suicides
I saw my father cheat on my mother with another
I saw my mother cheat on my father with his brother
I witnessed every evil deed that I've ever done
I saw Jesus crucify gods only son
I heard screaming victims
Play with disease and I
I smelled the toxins from the
Air that we breathe and I
It sounds farfetched but you
You must believe that we
Will self-destruct as a
Result of greed

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
See I've been watching you
And I know everything that you do
Where your families at, places you go to
Every number you dial and every attempt that you make to get away from me is futile
Ha ha ha ha ha!
So you can't sleep or eat without me, nightmares about me, you doubt me

[Hook]
