[Krizz Kaliko]
What we are is what we are
What we feel is what we feel
O-Kay

There's a part of me you don't see
There's a part of me that don't bleed
Godspeed if you only knew
Oh
And if it's hurtin' we throw it away
And we live to fight another day
Pray for me, and I'll pray for you
Oh
But some things are left unsaid
We killed, yet undead
Hurts like hell but I'm try'na make it heavenly, heavenly, heavenly

[Hook]
I would have told you how I feel
But my feeling's almost gone
I wanna scream out something real
(Yes, there's something wrong!)
What we are is what we are
(Ay, ever told you something like)
What we feel is what we feel

[Bridge]
Right, you better guard your heart
Cause it's going down
You better hold your love
Cause I'll let you down
Right?

[Verse 2]
Picture one, picture you, preach it
Picture you as a new creature
Godspeed if you only knew
Oh
And if we're dirty we throw it away
We do it to get another day
Maybe baptized will make us new
Oh
But some things left unsaid
We killed, yet undead
Hurts like hell but I'm try'na make it heavenly, heavenly, heavenly

[Hook]
I would have told you how I feel
But my feeling's almost gone
I wanna scream that it's something real
(Yes, there's something wrong!)
What we are is what we are
(Ay, ever told you something like)
What we feel is what we feel

[Bridge]
Right, you better guard your heart
Cause it's going down
You better hold your love
Cause I let you down
Right?

[Verse 3]
So wipe that smile off your face
Might not like what you taste
But I can make it look good to you
Don't I make it look good to you
And I'm feelin' disgraced
So maybe your smile's out of place
It hurts like hell but I'm try'na make it heavenly, heavenly, heavenly

[Hook]
I would have told you how I feel
But my feeling's almost gone
I wanna scream that it's something real
(Yes, there's something wrong!)
What we are is what we are
(Ay, ever told you something like)
What we feel is what we feel
Right?
You better guard your heart
Cause it's goin' down
You better hold your love
Cause I let you down
Right?
You know I didn't wanna-
