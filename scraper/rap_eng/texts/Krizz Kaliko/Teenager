[Verse 1]
Just a young girl, half as dead
Let me take your back to the
Very first time we ever met
I think it was Chubby's Diner
Up on Broadway, she had to learn the lessons the hard way
And daddy touched her, all the wrong ways
But now he's gone and she just can't let it go

[Chorus]
Teenager
I think you're too far gone
Teenager
A long, long way from home
Teenager
Your heart's so full of doubt
Teenager
So lost and so turned out

Teenager
Haaaa, haaaaa
Teenager
Haaaa, haaaaa

[Verse 2]
And now she's taken off her clothes
But little with none of it
And she said, that's the way it goes
With drug friends with nothing
She had a baby boy, but don't know who the father is
Little mama know the chore, just a kid raising a kid
Drops to her knees, makes her needs clearer
But it seems like no one hears her
No one's there, so no one cares
Pops a handful in front of the mirror

[Chorus]
Teenager
I think you're too far gone
Teenager
A long, long way from home
Teenager, yeeaah
Your heart's so full of doubt
Teenager
So lost and so turned out

Teenager
Haaaa, haaaaa
Teenager
Haaaa, haaaaa
Teenager
Haaaa, haaaaa
Teenager
Haaaa, haaaaa
