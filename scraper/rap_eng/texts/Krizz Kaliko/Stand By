[Verse 1]
Is it possible for me to remain in the same lane
And I would be insane to leave
Or would it kill me inside
To take a nose dive and I can plunge in the sea?
Unknown it's where I'm goin'
I got mouths to feed in my home
And I go whichever the way that the wind blowing
Another day, another dollar, another show and
Please believe that I'm thankful for cheese-receiving
I'd be a fool to leave it, but need TV for the people to see it
Conceited, the world has conceived the genius
I'm ready to take off, baby I'm too anxious
That's something I can't shake off
So I sit right here, I just hope the blood, sweat and tears over years'll pay off
Peace

[Hook]
You'll be a star there may be no
Place in this world that you can't go
Ready to soar into the sky
Lately I've been flying stand by
Lately I've been flying stand by
Lately

[Bridge]
I been flying in circles
I'm nervous
And I've been waiting to land
Somewhere aground?

[Verse 2]
They told me sit in my seat
And prepare for the ride
You'll love the view
Once you'll learn how to fly
Don't be afraid
Cause you're gonna go high
Close the door in my face
Told me wait, you're flying stand by
You'll be flying stand by
You're flying stand by

[Hook]
You'll be a star there may be no
Place in this world that you can't go
Ready to soar into the sky
Lately I'm flying stand by
Lately I'm flying stand by
Lately

[Outro]
