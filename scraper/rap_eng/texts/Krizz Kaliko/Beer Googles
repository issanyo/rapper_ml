In the world, there's a lot of lonely girls
Who am I to deny 'em? So I think I'll try 'em
And some of these girlies is cuties too
And some of these cuties look just like you
But there's some I do and some I don't
If I have me a few, she's what I want
And my eyes can't see what's wrong
I take another couple shots and we gone
Beer goggles got me getting at her
Maybe it's the liquor that made me get at her
If I have one more cup
I'm a try to come see what's up (What's up?) (Alright!)
Beer goggles got me getting at her
Maybe it's the liquor that made me get at her
If I take one more sip
Baby, guess who you're goin' with (Kali Baby!)
Ooh, ugly, yeah, she's lookin' ugly
Before you take a drink
Pop that bubbly, she'll be lookin' lovely
'Fore you can even blink
Sprite, lemon, and a couple women
Add a little Hennessey
You might not be the right one
But tonight, baby, you can pretend to be
Slizzur, slizzur, must been a mix-up, mix-up
How did we get twisted? Shit, last night you was cold as blizzard, blizzard
Not as cold as my shoulder, woke up and looked over, whoa!
Um, the cold rum mixed with Coke somehow set me up with a fe-fi-fo-fum
The beer goggles turned you into a fierce model
From a deer with no eyes, I-have-no-idea model, tears
What have I done? What if in 9 months...
I can't think that into existence, I'm a leave here and never mention... anything
