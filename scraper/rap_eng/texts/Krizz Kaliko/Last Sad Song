(The Hole)

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I really need to get up out of this hole
I'm really really sinking deep down in this hole
I need to get out of this shit, I'm serious
I really wanna go into the light, man
I know y'all love me to be sad and shit
But this got to be my last sad song
I mean, I gotta get out of this shit
Before I lose myself in it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't you pity me no more, just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hey, y'all know my mother's sickness, y'all know I'm breakin' down
Y'all know in my circle the devil's steady makin' rounds
Y'all know I'm missin' my children because I'm shakin' towns
And y'all love my music and how sad I could make it sound
I'm in the darkness so low I'm under the carpet
Whoever wants me to park it you motherfuckers is heartless
They want me stuck with hardships, want a unhappy artist
But I'ma break apart from this KOD shit regardless
Of who's mad, a lot of my shit is too sad
Like the death of Micheal Jackson, motherfucker who's bad?
To jump right up out of myself, this shit's a fight on my health
The darkness is sellin' but I really wanna put y'all some light on the shelf
Will you still be able to feel me
Even if I'm not talkin' about tryin' to kill me
The King of Darkness can no longer conceal me
This could be my last sad song, hopin' it will be

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't you pity me no more, just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, I want some Caribou Lou
I wanna see areolas chicks on my shoulders instead of boo-hoo
Like I said I'm too through with me spreadin' blue spew
All I wanna hear is my peoples say "Tech go head and do you"
Y'all love my pain and I was glad to give it
But most of the people who love it never really had to live it
Now they mad and livid, I don't want no sad to visit
My music thinkin' I'm about to lose it so they bash and diss it
Before they even hear what I have comin' this year
I'ma be that lit spear let's get some of this shit clear
I ain't switchin' to mainstream only what is happenin' is
You watchin' the mainstream go me
So watch me bloom out of this blackened cocoon
'Cause if I go back into gloom I'm just askin' for doom
Man I'm just rappin' to whom to keep attacking my tunes
I don't wanna be melancholy 'til I put my ass in a tomb

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't you pity me no more, just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Listen, only time can dictate if I'll get straight
But I'm reachin' for the light as of this day
I love KOD but I think I made a mistake
By lettin' negative energy in me now I'm misplaced
I lost something along the way
My mama taught me bad things are wrong to say
Still I conjure up a album of songs to play
For the dark and a lot of my loved ones are gone today, damn
I'm in a crossroad, I'm tryin' to go into the light
Like Carol Ann there I stand still a lost soul
On the subject on when I talk low
I'm ready to dangle this darkness
At the top of the catacombs and toss those
But will you still be with me or just kill me quickly
Away with the darkness but I promise the flow will still be sickly
I am the king and I always have the throne
But I hope and pray for the brighter day
Hope this my last sad song

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't you pity me no more, just pray for me
That this'll be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you stand here with me
And this'll be the last sad song I have to sing

[Collision: Tech N9ne]
It's time to be something else
'Cause this shit is fuckin' me up
Talkin' 'bout mentally, it really is fuckin' me up man
I'm talkin' about, it's infecting everybody around me, man
I'm tryna, I gotta get out
Gotta be done with this shit

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Fuck this shit, let's go party, nigga
