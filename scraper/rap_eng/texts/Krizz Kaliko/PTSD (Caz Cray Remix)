[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one that I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins
In a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
My hurt, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: Caz Cray]
My psychosis got me hurtin' people close to me
This ain't how it's s'posed to be. I look at my life hopelessly
I'm praying up to God to ease the mental pain as I clutch my rosary
But as of this moment, he hasn't spoke to me
So I'm at a loss for words along with sanity
Spewing out profanities, I'm screaming out so randomly
The demons deep inside me got me turning on humanity
No longer have a family, my mind is a calamity
They tellin' me it's impractical, even laughable
That i'm telling the truth about my struggle, but it's factual
My thoughts are so irrational, I'm feeling like an animal
That's locked inside a cage with a muzzle stuck to my mandible
And all I want is peace of mind, but a piece of mine
Rips the peace to pieces and it's hard for me to keep from crying
And it pains the ones that care for me to see me dying
I tried my best but the devil in me is free from hiding
