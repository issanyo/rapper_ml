Bless me father, for ive sined
Its been 25 years since my last confession

Ive watched people die and ive stolen to survive
And im still feedin miles because addicts get high
Now is this the life that i was born to live?
Could i really have fate with all the crimes ive committed
I can't trust anyone, even though im sappost too
Becuase i know people don't do what they sappost to
Ive shown more love, then ill ever get back
But all the evil ive done i know im sure to catch that
Ive worked to feed the demons,and the devils have sent me
But i need your help, when the minnions attack me
Proffesious dated boy, im just like you so when im spawn from hell
The ones grew through...
Ive been torted and burned in ways uncopprehendible
Eatin alive by the worste kind of cannible
You say id be dead for shit like that to happen
It's the bullet holes, theres a meanin in this rappin

( x3) I need a change, in my life
The way im livin oooh just ain't right
Oooh i need a change
I need a change in my lifee
Ooooh i need a change

I know yall think that i really got it made
I hear them rumors talkin and you say im over paid
Some of yall even spread lies against me
Then you see me in person and you try to befriend me
Let me tell you this though, real from the gitgo
Compare me to an adam tick n ready to blow
From my head to my toe,my heart to my soul
Ive praid to the lord, take me before im old
My brain is sicker then biologicle virisus
Im livin in hell with my body thee impirited
A cabbinet full of medicine i dont ever take
Rather die from bein real, then live from bein fake
Visions of the future it was all in reverse
I just want it, when we get there its really gunna hurt
A proffetic breature movin through ya speaker
Whos the real loser if i fail to teach ya?

(x3) I need need a change
I know i know
I need need a change

The problems that i got build up beond beleif
I cannot escape, not even in my sleep
I feel the heat, from the kitchen to the street
I won't make it far with theses shackles on my feet
So i turn n fight from my soul to my life
It Seems i lost sight of whats wrong and whats right
What the hell am i doing here, i got no clue
People say they love me but i dont beleive its true

( x4-5) I need a change, in my life
The way im livin oooh just ain't right
Oooh i need a change
I need a change in my lifee
Ooooh i need a change
