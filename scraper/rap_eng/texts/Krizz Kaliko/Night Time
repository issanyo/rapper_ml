[Hook]
In the night time
When night is on its way
For some reason I feel better
I'm so bored with the day
Don't know why I feel this way
In the night time
It's wrong for me to feel this way

[Verse 1]
So excuse me if it's weird
When it's dark, some people fear it
I go near it
I can feel it
The sun just fell, and I know this feeling well
A change has taken place, the city's outer space
And I wonder, who's gon' cry tonight? Who's gonna get fly tonight?
Get drunk, get high tonight? Hell, who's gon' die tonight?
What is waiting on the other side of day time
Feels like it's playtime

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In my head, it's always nightfall
Close my eyes, and then the light's off
I'm 'bout to wipe off
If these streets still gotta beat me but the mic's off
They holler, "Kali Baby!"
Put your arms round me, baby
And show me what it's made for
I like the sunshine
But I love the moonlight
The freaks come out at night
The darkness is the right time
For us to do what we do --

[Hook]

It's crazy
Don't know why I feel this way
Ooh, it's crazy
In the night time
