[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Every morning way in her eyes I see a brand new day
Opportunities arising, and I can't be late
Yesterday's so far away, that I can't turn back now
Because I know it's greater later, someway, somehow

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
It's my day, so I'mma tell my wife that I love her
How she stood up, and stood by, when the shit [?] went under
When the plug got disconnected, and I made a few blunders
I got sloppy, so I stumbled, what a way to be humble
Wasn't stressin', never flexin', never asked me a question
God must've seen me hurting, so he sent me a blessing
He sent heaven in the form of a girl, you my world
And I love you more than diamonds and pearls, you hear me, girl?
To my oldest daughter, all we do is fuss and fight
But baby, I'm your father, I've got to tell you wrong from right
I know you think you smarter, and I should let you live your life
That ain't the working order, see, I'm supposed to hold the light
To help you see father, if you ain't ready for your flight
Then you gon' fall harder, that ain't my vision for your life
But, I'mma try harder, to let you learn to live your life
But if you need me, holler, and I'll be there to make it right

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Every morning way in her eyes I see a brand new day
Opportunities arising, and I can't be late
Yesterday's so far away, that I can't turn back now
Because I know it's greater later, someway, somehow

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
On this day, I choose to raise the souls of the dead
And change the loss so all my dogs'll make it home from the feds
Cure my granny from diseases, set her memory free
So I can call her, say "I love you" and she'll know that it's me
Then I go platinum in a day, and I go double the next
So I can start my sister's business with mechanical checks
With no fed investagation, how it come with the bread
Monsterifik so terrific, feds boppin' their heads
Then give my [?] and show him shit can be right
We ain't got to grit and grind or fuss some fight to get stripes
Have the world screamin' villain, mass appealing, we kill them
Resurrecting all our soldiers from the grave and in prison
Put the hood up on my shoulders, tell them follow the dough
Can't defeat us, I'm elitist, till we hounding the hall
Boy, it's my day, it's my way, what I see, what I say
It's coming real soon, man, it's time for a new day

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Every morning way in her eyes I see a brand new day
Opportunities arising, and I can't be late
Yesterday's so far away, that I can't turn back now
Because I know it's greater later, someway, somehow

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
So now I take the chances, speak to three little girls
Baby Tracy, and my twins, that's the rest of my world
Try to teach them, hope I reach them, let them know they can fly
Break them chains, play them games, and be much colder than I
And in this world, right for pickin' better fruits of your labour
Just stay focused on your dreams, and keep your faith in the savior
Don't let the man change your plans, if it's love, let it keep it
He raise his hands, you take a stand and spill his blood with the heat
Remember, family's all that you got and I'll be here if you need me
No one can ever love you more than me, I hope you belive me
But now, it's time to let you fly, and take your place in the sky
Little ladies, almost women, with that look in your eye
Sophisticated, educated, keep on questioning why
Don't ever settle, chase them answers till the day that you die
Remember, daddy did his best, and tried to teach you the rest
The road was hard and it was stress, but y'all prepared for the test
Yeah

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Every morning way in her eyes I see a brand new day
Opportunities arising, and I can't be late
Yesterday's so far away, that I can't turn back now
Because I know it's greater later, someway, somehow
