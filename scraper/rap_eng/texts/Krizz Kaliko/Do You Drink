[Intro]
What y'all drinkin' on
And can you gimme some?
Sippin' until you can hardly blink
And do you drink?

[Verse 1]
I got a disease and they dunno what to call it (what is it?)
I'm an alcoholic, drink until I fall retarded
Thick headed, sick individual, liver's condition's critical
Medical, better do somethin' to get him through
I ain't standing up, I'm layin' down under
Under the table, cause drivin', I ain't able to do it
See a stop sign and run right through it
Dry heavin' on my buddy's sleeve and spewin the fluid
The ladies want a couple cups and pink panties
Yeah, gimme a couple cups and they can't stand me
KC Tea, Caribou, and some foo-foo drinks
And you won't care what dudes think, ladies

[Hook]
Do you drink? (Look away now)
There's nothing to see here
I-I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons of KC Tea
I want the world to have a drink with me
Do you drink? (Look away now)
There's nothing to see here
I-I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons and gallons of the 'Bou-Lou'll
Run right through you
Do you drink?

[Verse 2]
I don't drink Patron, that's a no-no
I know I tried, I almost died back in '04 though
Club Maniacs was a spot where we watched
All the top-notch crotch jockin' my swatch-watch
Holla, lil Mama way up out my league
Gucci, Prada, 'bout the dolla like (ya-da-da-da-da)
Whatever game, I'd get at it together
Booty look fatter than ever
Almost had to have to let it go
Had to leave her alone, I took a sip of Patron
And choked on it, it started coming out my nose
Neh'mind, she ain't coming out her clothes
Walked the other way, what would you think? But shorty

[Hook]
Do you drink? (Look away now)
There's nothing to see here
I-I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons of KC Tea
I want the world to have a drink with me
Do you drink? (Look away now)
There's nothing to see here
I-I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons and gallons of the 'Bou-Lou'll
Run right through you
Do you drink?

[Verse 3]
I'm the king of flip cup and beer pong
"99 Bottles of Beer" song and a beer bong
I take a Irish Carbomb and a Screwdiver
Make me up a Boilermaker, I ain't trippin', you drivin'!
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in
I've been drinkin' liquor since I've been alive and jivin'
Don't consume more than you can handle
If you gangsta walk and spill it on your flannel
Jesus never spilled the wine upon his sandal
People probably never asked him...

[Hook]
Do you drink? (Look away now)
There's nothing to see here
I-I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons of KC Tea
I want the world to have a drink with me
Do you drink? (Look away now)
There's nothing to see here
I-I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons and gallons of the 'Bou-Lou'll
Run right through you
Do you drink?
