[Verse 1]
I kinda go any way that the wind blows
See I remember when I almost jumped out the window
I lived inside the darkest cloud
You'd never see me smiling
If I don't make it out of the woods, I live in Limbo

[Hook]
See I'm not happy, I'm just happyish
Get everybody on some happy shit
See it don't matter the weather, if you wanna feel better
Get up and on some happiness
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Verse 2]
I try to live my life and be simple (hey)
Cause this world will mess with your mental
I keep my head up in the clouds
The only way I'm smiling
If I don't make it out of the woods, I live in Limbo

[Hook]
See I'm not happy, I'm just happyish
Get everybody on some happy shit
See it don't matter the weather, if you wanna feel better
Get up and on some happiness
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Verse 3]
Look, I learned how to smile with a frown
Faking it so I ain't taking you down
I got a lot to be happy for, but I still want more
I see a silver lining, the sun is shining
But what I got to be happy for?

[Hook]
See I'm not happy, I'm just happyish
Get everybody on some happy shit
See it don't matter the weather, if you wanna feel better
Get up and on some happiness
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
