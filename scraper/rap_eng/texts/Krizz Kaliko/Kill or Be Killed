[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
You woke up this morning not knowing blood will be on your garments
Ambulances and informants hood rats callin' down your homies
See them demons and them omens staring at you
Mind control they want your soul
And then your rolling with them just know where you going (Hellbound)
Twelve rounds came out that .45, make it to see 25 that's alot,(Let's rewind)
When you pulled up on them 6's bust a pistol busting bitches nigga's looking suspicious load em' up while you (Split your swishers)
Hungry enough to come and get you
Hope the gun is coming with you
Gonna have to shoot it out or shoot infront (Won't pitch em')
Time is now you wasn't focused you seemed up like you had posted
No tags it was stolen and then it was murder motives
Blink of a eye you looking right at yo demise as they hopping out they gonna ride
It's a homicide on yo life
The coldest thing you didn't see and now you laying there bleeding
Hopeless they keep out your weakness and now you hope to see light

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See out of my body's where they want me
They think they can catch me slipping they want me
So I sleep with one eye open
Cause you never know when you wake up and you're gone

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Now the doctors they operating pumping your heart infront of yo momma yo dogs
If you don't make it you gone
On the way to the trauma center
They taking to long swerving in and out of traffic yo mamma tell you (Hold on)
Your bodies filled up with holes
You feel your body getting colder smelling that death in the air the reaper waiting for your soul
While youâ€™re fightin for your life, strugglin to get some air struggling to get some air yeah, when that line flat then it's a tag on yo toe
As your soul start to travel out your flesh you see yourself lying on that gurney all bloody buddy it's a mess
Wish the best upon your flesh
But your flesh might be dissapointed
Pray to god that you anointed while awaiting your appointment
While he pointing in that waiting room
Going through the motions all the screaming and comotion
As they split yo body open, for the surgery and accertainly as seems that it's over better pray that you hold over
Call your bloods how you was potent, I said maybe cause your safety is for certain out your hands
Not your momma not your daddy not your girl not your mans
None can save you hope they play you in a memory when you fly
You made but your ligaments ain't alive
Wish you had died

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See out of my body's where they want me
They think they can catch me slipping they want me
So I sleep with one eye open
Cause you never know when you wake up and you're gone

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Plantin' messages, punks get ahold of my voicemail
Plotting and planning damaging, on giving this boy hell
Hopped off on my boy hell
Man I hope they enjoy shells
Dropped, all up on they property
Gotta get dos when this toy yell
Nigga I ain't dying just cause you jealous
I'm gettin' relish and I sell it my shit developed
So well that a deaf dude could tell it
I smell it he female-ish
Swell up cause his gal I nail it, Spell it!
(B-i-t-c-h) but killer is the sales pitch
I'm gonna be poppin' chopping, a lot of of body's gonna dropping from this
Never gonna be another motherfucka livin' in my land when he be talking some shit
Cause I got kids niggas, and I'll do a bid nigga
But for the safety of my babies, crazy, "Now look what I done did nigga"
Hop off my tour bus in your town I'mma scope you out
Hoping that I find you when I hear that shit that you spoke about
Like I'm goin' feel shit
Like it's gonna be a real hit
But you're just like that chick that gave you my number a little bitch
Been in your town over and over, you still absent
And I do meet and greets, nigga you for real acting
I'm sick of yo ill yapping, you gonna get your grill blackend
That's from the steel clapping that's 56 Vill rapping
It will happen, bitch!
