[Verse 1]
I grew up a young choir boy
Christian like Chris is like the last you ever think to pick a fight
Kids used to throw rocks at me
When the bus stops at me
How sis would come running out
"Leave my brother alone!" she would tell 'em
"I'ma kill 'em momma, if they send him home again yellin'
I'ma erase at least one of 'em from this place
I hated they make fun of him 'cause his face"
Go on and on, travelin' on through adolescence
Teach 'em a lesson, carry a weapon
'Cause that's the only way to keep 'em off of me
They teasin' me awfully bad
Wish I could take off my mask and I'm asking my momma
"Why you think the lord seen to fit to hit me with this?"
He could make a different Chris if he wanted to
Here's what I'm gonna do: I'ma tattoo my face and erase this
This is Vitiligo

[Chorus]
What kind of life is that for a boy who looks like this? (famous)
Wanting to fit in this world, but it's just a wish
Pointing fingers, people whisper, silhouette of a lonely figure
Where can he go? Where can he hide? Livin' inside of his Vitiligo

[Bridge]
Save this freak of nature, songbird make his way from

[Verse 2]
From the bottom all the way to the top
Even though he hated the way he painted, momma told me I can't stop
'Cause no one cares if anyone's watching
People stare at Mr. Watson
But that never stopped him from coppin' the
Boxes and was popular
It's over and shit
Colder the older it get
And sorry pop never made it to see his son be the great one
Escape from the place that definitely made him
Look what I did, I made a life, a wife, and a kid
People know me wherever I go
This is Vitiligo

[Chorus]
What kind of life is that for a boy who looks like this? (famous)
Wanting to fit in this world, but it's just a wish
Pointing fingers, people whisper, silhouette of a lonely figure
Where can he go? Where can he hide? Livin' inside of his Vitiligo

This is Vitiligo... hold on

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Here comes the drop! Here comes the drop! Oh shit!
