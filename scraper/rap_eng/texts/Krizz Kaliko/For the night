All these laim ass bitches
Got me fucked up
Im here to show you what im about to do
Pursing every move
My dream i can't seem to let it go
Hot girls show up to every show
Getting loose drunk as fuck off a bottle or two
Malibu rum
Got em freaky about to come
Haters always run
When i bust out the gun
I perfeer to duke it out
Cuase thats what men do
Relax im just kicking back smoking hindo
Fuck a slut bitch and a hoe bag
Fuck around and ull end up on a steel slab
Sporting a toe tag
Barley hanging on like a thumb tack
Im snapping back
Like a rubber band always on track
Talking mad smack
Eating all these pussys like a fucking lunch pack

Lil dude doing big things
Tatted up repping no chains
Like a man everyday i let my nuts hang
Blowing up
Spreading through the air like propane

Stacking my career like legos
Like legos
Creating my scene like playdo
Like playdo
Ill even fuck a girl if she prego
If she prego
And when im flipping weight i lay low
Lay low
Killing all you rappers like haylo
Haylo
Spreading through the air like volcanos
Volcanos
Ripping shit up like tornados
Tornados
I strap with a tool
Cause theyll play you like a fool
Like a fool
When ya did threw the city
Gotta make that money
And im feeling kinda pretty
Never nerdy
I dont give a fuck
Flying like a birdy
You can see me landing on top of yall mother fuckers shittin
I just keep going like a transmission
Been switching gears over years
On a mission never quiting
Ima keep going till my piston blows
Ima kick back and smoke this dro

Lil dude doing big things
Tatted up repping no chains
Like a man everyday i let my nuts hang
Blowing up
Spreading through the air like propane
