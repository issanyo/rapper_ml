[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
See she the object of my affection
Nah, I take that back
See she the object of my erection
I gotta use protection
I'm way too paranoid, so I'm avoiding the infection
To get her in position I use different voice inflection
How you doing?
That nannies high on a pedestal
I need an intervention
Attention I need is medical
They rev me like an engine
I'm itchin' to get my antidote
So give me an inch and I'm into it like it's cantaloupe
Be girls, be girls, be girls everywhere
I can't help but stare
I'm just hoping that they share
Overseas they call me KaliBobbitto Frejo
He called Mr. Bookoo Speedy Labito
Do 'em in then they ask for me to do 'em again
I ain't playin' with them girls but they like to pretend
Like I'm their boyfriend for the night so I treat them a little meaner
It's been too many years and surely been way too many girls

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I do way too many girls
I simply, plainly have too many all around the world
So if you trippin' with your lady
She might be-be with Tecca Nina or with Kali Baby
I do way too many girls
I simply, plainly have too many all around the world
So if you look and you don't see her
She might be with Kali Baby or be with Tecca Nina

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hey, I really like you so maybe we
Can go half on a baby see
Countries take a chance with crazy me
And I never wanna be shady
T don't give a damn were the other ladies be
Andrea I mean Damicica, damn
Man I think I got ADD
I'm callin' you to say I think I've seen the light
Reg should come over right now and just sleep with me tonight
Sarah please I mean Teresa Jeez I steady keep losing sight
Cause they bodies be hella tight
Even though it's wrong the feelings right
My bed is so ready to get run up by incredible sex
I just wanna set up and get ate up caress your straight edible breasts
Do you hear me Loretta, sorry bout that Gina
Would you give me that thing I really want you Stephanie I mean Katrina
I get calls from Lacey, from Amber, and sometimes Sabrina
They all over my demeanor
So they stand in line for the wiener
From Christina, Pam, and big booty Jay
The one with Jareeta
And the Louse beauty queen and Tayaneeta
Said you got too many girls Nina

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sundae]
I need a girl Nina
Ain't no sense in me lyin'
I'm like Biggie you buy her wine
And I just creep from behind her
Say she wanna be on my team
Lickin' clits and vagina
Never mind me you'll never Kevin Federline me
Too many girls, girls, girls around the world
They wanna eat my pussy buy your girl diamonds and pearls
I need a girl Nina
I like her but shes scarin' me
Sextin' me she like bury me
Since prop 8 bitch wanna marry me
I need a girl Nina
I ain't it but I'll bet a fifth (she's Strange)
And I like it Pam and Kandy wanna do me

To put me in her moutha

Mind lost like Jimmy Hoffa

She says she wanna lick me and have Krizz Kali babies
I need a girl Nina
