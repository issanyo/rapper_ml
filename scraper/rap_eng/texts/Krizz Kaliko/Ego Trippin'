[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ay, by now everybody breathing should be into this
With us, even have a membership, loving me when I begin to rip
But there be some that wanna hinder the sinister nemesis
Cause I'm grim a bit, I am at the end of what I'm finna get
Intricate, I finish it with a diss for the hiss, but I get no benefit
I am not a demon cause I'm always beamin' and on some sinner shit
This shall replenish this menacing glitch that men have set
On my syndicate, this genesis will spit and diminish it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I done took all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
When we bust they clap their hands, clap, clap, 'till the hands are sore
And possibly, could you be afraid of me? (Afraid of me?)
Be careful who you fuckin' with
Boy, don't let your ego trip

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I can't stands no more like I was Popeye
Then I got my spinach and now the industry drop by
When I rock the spot my, plot's to be shot high
In a dark sky, in hopes I! Will not die
They really are scared of me, they said that T would not fly
And credit was deaded, but he kinetically sped up and guap rised
Off the top I, will not lie, bread is my fetish
And I really get it, that's why I'm a dreaded hip hop guy
So stop try, do not pry
And me won't have to bring the Glock by, nigga, hot fry
Leave ya mammy with a soft sigh, lost why?
Because the jammy did her man like standing on pot pie
And now I keep bitches that'll make Dennis Hoff buy
Twat, I be so paper that it make the cops spy
And now the haters try to mock my walk to the top
Dynamic and they not I, Boss Nine!

I done took all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
