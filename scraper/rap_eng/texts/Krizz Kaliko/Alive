[Intro]
Baby, you still making me sad
Make me feel good
Like that
You want some more?

[Verse 1]
What the hell are you doing?
You give it up and making me want some more
Why the hell do we ruin?
A silvan go right in the closet door
I think this is heaven or hell
Baby I can't tell
You're the only thing on the menu
Bury me in you

[Chorus]
It feels so good I hate it
Go in half on a baby
And when I get you naked
Feels like I could die!
I don't know what you gave me
I don't want you to save me
I got to get you naked
Feels like I could die inside you
Like I could die inside you
You make me feel alive

Perfect, perfect
You're perfect, perfect
You're perfect, perfect

[Verse 2]
If I gotta go I gotta go
I'd rather die like this
You know nobody really gotta know
This between you and Krizz
You're exactly what I don't need
But I'm in need
She said touch me till I'm in deed
Die in me

[Chorus]
It feels so good I hate it
Go in half on a baby
And when I get you naked
Feels like I could die!
I don't know what you gave me
I don't want you to save me
I got to get you naked
Feels like I could die inside you
Like I could die inside you
You make me feel alive

Perfect, perfect
You're perfect, perfect
You're perfect, perfect

[Outro]
Oh my God, the music just turns me on!

You're perfect, perfect
