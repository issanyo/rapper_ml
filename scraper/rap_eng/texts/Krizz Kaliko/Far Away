[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Man, I can't even picture myself not breathin'
But it's certain

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I love too much, I love too many to count 'em
So extras and pets, it's easy for me to go on without 'em
Cause everything goes away
Love it eventually gets stowed away
Why does it have to be when you're breathin' when even
And then you're heated wonderin' why is it cold today
Immortal - it's fake and impossible
But every time I look up I'm shakin' an obstacle
What's gonna happen when time is up and I gots to go
Beautiful lands are took away from my opticle
It's not that I'm afraid of death
But afraid of the thought of my people laid to rest
They're sayin' there's six million ways of death
But not even one way to fade the stress
It's certain that a person
Got somebody lookin' workin' to close the curtain
Or maybe something out of some dream
With a devilish soul for hurtin'
Sometime I be wishin' I didn't love
Cause when it's away I be missin' love
Your mother, your father, your children are livin'
To die from the crib then a ditch is dug
From the process I get nauseous
Cause I can't see my death and its causes
Pac he saw it around the corner
But me not breathin' is a pound of balogna
I keep fightin' and I'm tryin' to get right in my mind, Bryan
Cause one day I'm gonna see you
Even though I can't picture the N9ne dyin', I'm flyin'

[Chorus: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Far far away from here
(And nothing I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here
(I'm wishing I could do without it)
(I think you're gonna go)
Far far away from here
(And nothing I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here
(I'm wishing I could do without it)
(I think you're gonna go)

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
See, I tried to call for you father, but nobody answered
And I tried to scream out loud, but nobody pampered
But you're leaving tomorrow and I'm just a youngster
And even in sorrow nobody wants to (Die)
Now I gotta try to get away
From the pain I'm never escapin' though
Maybe I did too much to you, you, you by forsakin' ya
And now I see a reflection of you off in my son
Cause he's the same complexion of you, color of the sun
And now I'm done baby makin', hatin' it to even see my baby sleep
Cause he gotta die one day or bury daddy deep
And I'm stayin' too far away from him
Spend too many days from him
Tears steadily fallin' I'm creatin' 'em
And it's gettin' colder, you getting older year by year
Never know when you gotta go far away from here
Listen here

[Chorus: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Far far away from here
(And nothing I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here
(I'm wishing I could do without it)
(I think you're gonna go)
Far far away from here
(And nothing I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here
(I'm wishing I could do without it)
(I think you're gonna go)

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Far far away from here
Everything I love go away from here
