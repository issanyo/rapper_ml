[Big Krizz Kaliko]
It's been a long time coming
And we stop singing We Shall Overcome and negro spirituals, we are no longer humming
Just what are we becoming?
It pulls a piece of life up out of me
That for little or nothing you willin to battle me
And actually it's not an act
We unruly, shootin up schools, doin the fool, we got a knack
I been carryin guns since I was knee high
Till it all stopped, I stopped and now I'm watchin' all my dogs die
This is the beginning of armageddon
We get high regardless, we godless so how high are we gettin'?
And we stay iced out in this land we on
See errantly on you, losin your arm over the diamond
Try em on, here go my shoes
Now check the ways of racism and be the first one singin the blues
Gods children are on every land we rhyme on
We share the same sky and gotta die, that's just what we got in common. Come on

We livin' up under the rain... can't stop it from fallin' down
We livin' up under the storm... can't stop it from brewing here
We livin' up under the rain... can't stop it from fallin' down
We livin' up under the storm... can't stop it from brewing here

[Prozak]
They say you can not judge a book by its cover
But it seems somehow we be judgin' one another because of color
Thinkin about the prejudice that plagues the human race
Even in God's grace, the people ain't safe with all this hatin' that we face, now check it
They say that Martin Luther King, he had a dream
But a dream is all it was because a race still comes between us
We never did learn, watchin the crosses burn
In his grave he would toss and turn
How many times can he return? Now we must..
Learn to stick together
And whether the stormy weather
We can never survive unless we can coexist together
A nation that is united, but all of its people divided
No more, we can not hide it, politically tryin to justify it

We livin' up under the rain... can't stop it from fallin' down
We livin' up under the storm... can't stop it from brewing here
We livin' up under the rain... can't stop it from fallin' down
We livin' up under the storm... can't stop it from brewing here
We livin' up under the rain... can't stop it from fallin' down
We livin' up under the storm... can't stop it from brewing here
We livin' up under the rain... can't stop it from fallin' down
We livin' up under the storm... can't stop it from brewing here
