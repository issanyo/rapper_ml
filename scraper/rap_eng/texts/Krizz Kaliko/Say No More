[Verse 1: Rittz]
Yeah, my God, my God, I’m odd, I’m Strange
Tech want me to kill 'em, give me a time frame
And point 'em out I'll gun 'em down yelling "Die lame"
Let the wet blood spots fly, gonna drop pain
I’m game, they think I'm playin' but I ain't
Why lames act hard, they far from it
Killing you ain't nothin' but a walk in the park for me
Shove you in the middle of the street when a car coming
Let’s splash, get hit with an Avalanche, King Kong Bundy
Blood leakin' like a virgin pussy at homecoming
Dissing me is similar to theivin' some dough from me
Get beat like a promoter tryna cheat me on show money
Backstage doing blow with a snow bunny
Rappers that you thinks dope, we poke fun at
But don’t come at me wrong, homie you don’t want it
These coyote dudes too slow for this roadrunner
.357 throatfucking you, choke on it
No one is fucking with Tech or Krizz or Ces Cru
Or Lynch, Kutty, Big Scoob or ¡Mayday!
You see the Snake and Bat upon a necklace, they know it’s (Strange)
We’re the Number 1 independent
See us win and ever since your skinned and ended
Fuck an image, all the mimics, trends and gimmicks
Hop us in, and they're given the business pimpin'
Ya-uh-yeah! Bitch, Rittz

[Tech N9ne]
"I don't try to write shit for the radio, I write what I feel!
If they like it on the radio they'll play it on the radio
Just do you, and the reward will be greater."

Fuck an image, all the mimics, trends and gimmicks
Hop us in, and they're given the business pimpin'
Ya-uh-yeah!

[Chorus]
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
Tech told me to kill 'em, say no more
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
Strange in this bitch and we waging war
Tech told me to kill 'em, say no more
Strange in this bitch and we waging war

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Give me a piece of it, I’ma feast on it
Beast on it, he see a leak in the industry
He’s on it, killer chop of the choppers
It ain’t no time for gettin' on 'em
Strip until they topless, come out lookin' marvelous
And so you get the barking dog, we never park at all
Willing the niggas that kicked it off
And if we get to talk at all, we get to nodding off
Leave it to Tech and Rittz and all
King of the topper, same king thingofabobber
Many teeth like I'm eatin' a whopper
Freakin' improper, can’t see me on the doppler
Your daughter want me cause I’m pop-popular
You can say no more ain't no more to say, Kaliko
You can't ignore any normal day
Niggas is horrible, course I’m forced to say
Never could hold a torch to immortal K
Because I make the jealous fellas tell us when they trail the
Elders killers feel us can’t impale us
Compare the heroes, it’s zeroes of their era
We're the Neros, underground getting the euros
(Okay) This is what you waited for
Baby boy, this ain’t the chorus
I’m just playing I ain’t got to say no more

"Fuck with the critics think they can criticize [?]
Excuse me, I think you should live with the project before you can critically claim any fuckin' thing"

I’m just playing I ain’t got to say no more

[Chorus]
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
Tech told me to kill 'em, say no more
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
Strange in this bitch and we waging war
Tech told me to kill 'em, say no more
Strange in this bitch and we waging war

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Get up on 'em, I'll kill 'em, he’s a banana so peel him
With ammunition I fill 'em, we diggin' a hole
Man I got the milla for reala, I get to chillin' with villa
And hit the grill with the steela, we takin' a soul
Step in the circle of course you're gonna pay a toll
Gonna be working to put the body in the morgue
Sucker, you never gonna get the weapon to fold the soldier
Animals in the road, never slow the cobra
Callin' me insane is a name with honor
Evil up in the brain make a Bane persona
Mentally in pain when I rain the lamma
On any fucking lame who wanna bring the drama
Pickin' the punk and I push him to pay
Pop a pilly 'pon his pimples and pray
Peep at you passive for penalty play
Pitches, pasta, pregnant pussy penne
I’m sorry y'all, talking about a demon on a hardy fall
When I should have been having a ball and a party y'all
Nigga Mardi Gras, hella gnarly y'all
But I came to rage, I aim to wage a war
Change the game deranged I came for gore
Nigga or came here to spray galore
I done said a whole lot and I say no more, cha
Bitch! Tech N9ne!

"I don't care about what they think
I write my life and from that came Strange Music"

Came here to spray galore
I done said a whole lot and I say no more

[Chorus]
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
Tech told me to kill 'em, say no more
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
This is what you waited for
Strange in this bitch and we waging war
Tech told me to kill 'em, say no more
Strange in this bitch and we waging war
