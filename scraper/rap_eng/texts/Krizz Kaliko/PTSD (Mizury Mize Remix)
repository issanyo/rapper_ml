[Verse: Mizury] What's the purpose of the earth when you feelin all cursed since birth since the womb
Cuz past events triggered me to now trigger easily in these present events when I shoot
Anti depressive, anxiety and A.D.D
Killin everybody when I freak out then peace out and forget it like a short term memory PTSD
Wit holding grudges wit this life that I live
While wishing some things I shouldn't of done and some things that i wish I did
Cuz some things i can't un-see and somethings I just dream on to much
Like countin sheep to go to sleep then dreamin of butchering 'em and still be a mad whitey when I wake up
Ha, born a little cray-cray at a young age I'd stab you wit a Crayola
My teenage days inserted umpteen markers and now I'm markin territories like im Ebola
I'm sorry about that; I can't help my random outburst
They say its better to let it out then keep it in but no one explained how its suppose to really work
I'd take meds but the side effects get me mixed up feelin thrown together like I'm goo-lage
There's no loosening up my mood cuz quite frank; I'm hot dog
Like I'm pissed off when I gotta talk about it; I'm from the show me state when i come undone
Because it really feels I'd have better luck bustin a nut in someone's eye for they can see where I'm comin' from
I'm Mizury
