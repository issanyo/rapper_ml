[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
One time, Kali Baby
Two times, Big Ben (Okay)
Three times, Kansas City stand up, yeah
Definitely one of them

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Ones, ones (ones, ones, ones)
See they pretend, but know that they fakin'
They don't see the money we making
We ain't asking for it, we take it
Yeah, I'm one of them ones
You can hear it when they mention me
See I'm the one they pretend to be
See the boss is what I'm meant to be
Just keep your eyes open, you can see
I'm one of them ones

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Look, Kali Baby, Ah-ha! Hey!
I never been a gangsta, you can still get it
I never been a rock star, but I still live it
Nobody gave me nothing, I was born with it
So no thank yous up like dynamite, put my ankles in it
Samuel Watson is my heritage
He tells you can't even watch him if you stare at him
If he fell he won't taste the bottom, God carries him
Won't touch the hair on my chinny chin chin chin
I'm daring 'em (give it to 'em!)
And I'm taking the gloves off
Do it with no vaseline, I'm taking the rugs off
That means I'll put the pickle to 'em
So if you a jellysickle-sucking mother (hey!, hey!)
He know I'm talking to 'em (hey you)
Kali the best, the best, the rest of 'em
You don't wanna find out
Ask Tech N9ne, I but puttin' their lights out
And if you didn't know, you better run, nigga, run
'Cause my tongue weighs a ton kill for fun and I'm one of them

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Ben]
One of them ones, I'm not the twos of fuse, refuse to lose
Battling of a champion, standing like there's no move to do
Rude, I don't mean to boast, but damn if I don't brag about it
Work for everything my tags reflect it with the task amounted
Thought before I tried, but now I die trying to get past this mountain
I ain't lashing out
And I ain't stuck and not at work
Custom job they lay it down
My sound of numbers sponsors
And yeah, I get cash wide spreads, some tumble dollars
If that's ain't what it's been about then I guess I been wrong too long for a troubled conscience
I don't puddle nonsense, I don't carry burdens
My life is like a show, the Tyler Perry curtain
And I'mma draw the shakey
Feel the night and call the day
'Round the clock connecting drops
If not, I take it all the way
Never had a handout, I was looking for that ball to play
Can't be get the money and conquered all that tried to stall my way
So what might work for me won't work for some
I saw the special, remarkable, you know the type, they call it a one

[Hook]

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, slow down
Now that I'm in my seat
I see the paper boy street
Never catch me sleeping
Y'all the reason I stay on my feet and

[Hook]
