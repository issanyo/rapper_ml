[Intro: Rosemary Clooney & Tech N9ne]
"Apap ruoy llet annog m'I ro a-pots uoy yas amaM"
Yeah, well I don't know if you don't
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"
Ahaha
Tech N9ne back in this Bianc, ya know
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"
KC!

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Rosemary Clooney]
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"
(I told you we wadn't playin')
Close the door before your child hear the sound, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
The Killa Clown's in your town raisin' all hell
Tecca Nina with the stamina comin' to damage ya
Buckin' the bammer when I bust with a bang
And it ain't no clause that say fraud ain't no tall tales
Women love it when I hit when I covet the booty
They givin' it to me, but it ainâ€™t no thang
We reppin' KCMO, fellas and the ladies know
That we coming with the killas, I'm with the gorillas
The villains that get ya when you disrespect us
Even the babies know, Tech Nina got crazy flow
We be givin' the women the willy we sick of the haters
Wanna pay us good to get this record
This is important, we be courtin' every place we go
Get you up in the room, and drippin' up wit' the groom
I give it to you any way you wanna have it
Baby is a horse and yes, of course, I'ma have to break the ho
Leavin' the kids at home, I wanna bone alone
We hoppin' up and down like jack rabbits
So many kids, put this on they daddies mind!
Never will I ever put 'em out there like that
Feelin' that I did Tecca Nina take it right back
Tellin' 'em that they mommy's boyfriend's Tech N9ne!
Don't be lookin' at me like you really wanna fight cat
All Tecca Nina wanna know is where the mic at

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Rosemary Clooney]
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"
Close the door before your child hear the sound, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"
Close the door before your child hear the sound, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
151, Malibu Rum, and pineapple juice
For those that don't know that's Caribou Lou
Origin in Mizzou
We havin' fun, got some buns on some yack abuse
Rouge Dawgs gonna rep it and smoke a lot
Regime, Outlawz, Duece Click in a zoo
Stagger when you wit' the Nnutthowze, we gon' have ya
Takin' everything up in the book from X and the puff
You lookin' to get took
Abracadabra, 151 and coke is viagra
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Gotta real love from havin' the bed shook
Look, I'm hella fed up wit' all the silly rumors dawg
Sayin' that we got dropped JCOR
That never ever would happen I mean what do they know
We kept our head up and now money's comin' to us all
We kickin' it wit' Strange, wallowin' in fame
Givin' the game only when I say so
So crack some bud wit' me, demons get some love wit' me
Doin' what you gotta do to get, what you gotta get it
Gotta get it all, Tecca Nina's on a roll
Get on some shrub wit' me, two cases of Bud wit' me
What you gonna do to get the women on crunk
I'ma hit 'em wit' the funk, got 'em all like OOOO!

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko, Rosemary Clooney & Tech N9ne]
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
"Apap ruoy llet annog m'I ro a-pots uoy yas amaM"
(That's Tech N9ne)
Close the door before your child hear the sound, baby
"Apap ruoy llet annog m'I ro a-pots uoy yas amaM"
(Sex all the time)
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Teasing your chakra and ain't nobody hotter
Close the door before your child hear the sound, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
One, and then comes the two to the three and
That was the anthem now this the anthem
Hella rockin' the planet again, you can't stand it again
Huns, they been comin' through to see me, man
Then I de-pants 'em and I bust at random
In a bit I'ma land 'em, dock, women I ram it again
Raves, I love to get high and get paid
Why do I wanna stick 'em wit' another hit up out of abyss
Baby, you don't wanna miss the ISH
Babes, they love to come by and get laid
Why am I at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill 'em in this
To the haters I gotta send 'em a gift
Bump this in your ride or in the club
Givin' everybody what they need
I give it all so they give it all back to me
Haters, don't you hide just show some love
Do you dig it? I'ma rep the B
And never ever let the C get the best of me
So many kids put this on their daddies mind
Never will I put 'em out there like that
Feelin' that I did Tecca Nina, take it right back
Tellin' him their mommy's boyfriend is Tech N9ne
(Oh no girl your baby's at the do'!)

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko, Rosemary Clooney & Tech N9ne]
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
"Apap ruoy llet annog m'I ro a-pots uoy yas amaM"
(That's Tech N9ne)
Close the door before your child hear the sound, baby
"Apap ruoy llet annog m'I ro a-pots uoy yas amaM"
(Sex all the time)
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
Teasing your chakra and ain't nobody hotter
Close the door before your child hear the sound, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko, Rosemary Clooney & Tech N9ne]
This one is for my homies and for all the DJs
"Apap ruoy llet annog m'I ro a-pots uoy yas amaM"
(Yeah, we kick it)
So when you pump it once, press instant replay
"Apap ruoy llet annog m'I ro a-pots uoy yas amaM"
Yo, they gon' love this one, love it, love it
Teasing your chakra and ain't nobody hotter
Big Krizz Kaliko and this is another Tech-Neko production
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"
This is the town where the clowns put it down, baby
"Mama say you stop-a or I'm gonna tell your papa"
Close the door before your child hear the sound, baby
Momma open this door
