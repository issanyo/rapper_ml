[Verse 1]
Only happy when I'm drinking
Cause sometimes life is just too hard
The chemical kills what I'm thinking
I end up right back where I start
This is not my for real life

[Hook]
It's the chemical x2
The chemical, it won't let me go
(I like it!)
The chemical (I love it!)
It won't let me go (I hate it!)
Let me go
I'm almost there
(No you're not)

[Verse 2]
I can only fly if I'm high
The chemical it gets me by
If I don't scream it means I'm fine
I can't leave the chemical behind
(Take me!)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You, who? Me? Must be crazy
Should not take this for my safety
Chemical kills what little pills
I can't seem to keep myself still

[Hook]
