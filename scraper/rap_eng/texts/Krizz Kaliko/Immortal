[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
If I poured my heart out, would you leave it on the floor
Or would you pick it up and place it in your chest for me?

Everyone wants to live forever
At least to be remembered forever
We mere mortals are vain enough
To want everyone to know our name
To hear our songs, to be... immortal

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I need (what)
A penny for your thoughts, and a nickel for your kiss
Would you fight for me? (huh ho)
Y'all 'ready know what I'm about
Would you pick up the pen and write for me
Would you spray me like a disease, sneeze me
Or cryogenically freeze me, loving me is easy
Would ya? Could ya? Keep me as a keepsake
Hand me down, my sound to freeloaders and cheapskates
(I think very deeply)
Then peep me, Kali Baby, maybe, rappers'll repeat me
Keep saying my name or spread me in the streets
And graffiti me, reheat me
Serve me up as if I was a leftover
Stepped over me, repeatedly
Tech blow up now you seeing me
Pass me on, like it's your turn to hit me in the rotation
Then I wanna blow up today, cause I'm gonna blow up the world today
And look at what we facin' (okay)
Everyone should say the same shit, ape shit, lucky we tape it
Download it, hold it
You love Strange Music never replace it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
If I poured my heart out would you leave it on the floor
Or would you pick it up and place it in your chest for me?
(So I can be immortal)
And when you play my song, would you just pass it along
Continue to love me even when I'm gone?
(So I can be immortal)

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
We takin' over, we takin' off, like a helicopter
We gettin hella props, from our billboard placement
These Hollywood niggas don't know what to do with us
They changin' shit to ruin us and my life's wasted (gone)
If you see the path I'm on, then pass me along, I have (come)
Just for a season, I'm leaving, now how could you sleep on him?
He's destined to get you in, the best thing since Mescaline
Success that's a sin
When all the breath in his chest has ended
Then you know the best ascended, depended
On nobody, playin' with nobody
He's nobody? Yeah, well alrighty
At my solo shows, I'm throwin Bolos
At cholo hoes, lettin' 'em know, how this mofo goes
See I'm an entity, plan all my infantries, since my infancy
And I'm coming to get that, coming to get what's good for me
Coming to shake your hand and take your fans
Doing it with no advance, and still make grands
If I go mainstream I'm sellin out of people's arenas
Now was sellin' out, he'd find something to yell about
Crazy's that way, I'm thinking I might just
Go seem to be having an identity crisis

[Hook]

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Immortal, I made it
And everyone gets to hear my stories
Kali, baby
