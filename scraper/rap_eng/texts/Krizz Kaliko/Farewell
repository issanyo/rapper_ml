[Verse 1: Prozak]
I think you did it this time I think she's leaving you
It seems she's finally fed up you better man up and speak the truth
I know your only human still that's no excuse for consuming and taking advantage pursuing her value to ruins
It sorta hurts to finally find that ya'll are separatin'
I'm praying you make it cause the results could be devastatin'
You guys were destined to be together not leave each other
Let's just better? your weather the storm and keep from going under
So many years invested she always kept you protected
Peep her perspective she's only asking to be respected
I'm only saying this cause I feel it sincerely
Cause I care about both of you equally just hope'n that hear me

[Hook x2: Prozak & Krizz Kaliko]
Think about the chances you had
Mistreating her and making her sad
Deceiving her and treating her bad
She gave you everything you needed everything that she has

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Ya say that ya love her but yet ya still abuse'n her
Your actions are speak'n louder then words only confusing her
What does it take for you to reinstate the faith
And prove we're forsaken before she finally takes herself away from you
You'll lose the best and only thing you have, can you?
Go on without her I don't think you can, she'll send you
Back to nothing right where you began, attack you
To save herself but that's the only plan, and some say
There is no fury like a woman's scorn, whose been betrayed
By the loved ones she's been caring for, perhaps one day
You will finally understand her more, hope it's not to late
She's feeling fed up right down to her core... can't take no more

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Prozak]
I really hate to say it but she'll be better without you
She was stronger then ever before you came and found her
You weren't the first and it's looking like you won't be the last
She's moving on soon you will become a thing of the past
Respect and coexistence has to stay mutual
So tell me how can you be so selfish and self centered through and through
You have forgotten and intentions have become rotten offend'n her with your monstrous egotistical confidence
This is a problem that you really need to solve and intervene from further falling this is key to keep this thing evolving
Cause with or without you she'll prosper without your involvement
It is impossible to stop her, her constant revolve'n

[Krizz Kaliko]
Hold on hold on hey Prozak man... who you talking about?

[Prozak]
Earth

[Krizz Kaliko]
Oh
