[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: Ashtin Larold]
Where am I?
Flashback to that hospital bed
Wires lead to the holes in my chest
Can't rest, don't have control of my head
Strap me down, shut me up, pump that IV bag full of meds
Morphine in my veins, so what's this pain?
Am I alive or dead!?
I'm SICK of these fucking cold sweats!
Try to sleep, but get no rest
Ask for God to throw me a bone
He threw a noose and said, "Go fetch!"
Grabbed that rope with both hands, wrapped it around my own neck
Jumped when I felt my neck snap: I woke up in my own bed!
I'm tired!  I'm living inside a hell!
My head is a fucking prison, my body's a fucking jail!
Sentenced without a trial, my soul has been set as bail
I'mma lose my fucking MIND if I don't get out of this cell!
One more minute, just one more night
One more round: get up and fight
Take those blows 'til the bells start ringing!
If I go out, I'mma GO OUT SWINGING!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
