(Intro)
Fans take a picture of me grinning
When I’m around women it’s like that
Now picture me, I think I’m winning
When I’m alone see it’s right by

(Verse)
I’m seemingly rich, seem to be a glitch in my plans
I’m hoping the whole world is a stand, I’m holding a 4-4 in my hand
You know what I’m talkin bout
I need me a bitch to hold a boulder off in her cage
And if I had to tell her off this you’ll stay
She knows you’re really better off with the man
When the smoke clears
I’m spinning tires, ain’t switching no gears
But a lot of time end up feel like like ain’t did no years
So what am I crying bout?
To the title that I’m whining bout
When I come out my whip nigga spines out
You know that you’re bout to find out
So turn the industry and turn the lights out then I climb out so

(Hook)
Why? Why so serious?
I’m so furious. Why so…?
I keep asking myself
Why? I’m so curious
So serious… Why?
And I can’t calm down down down
No, I can’t calm down down down
Call me a sad man
Baby I ain’t so bad (I ain’t so bad)
Maybe it’s just me
Why do I get so mad?
And I can’t come down down down
No, I can’t calm down down down

(Verse)
I’m getting closer to my last days
Cashing the cashiers, we’re saving for rainy days
And if we’re living in the last days
Need to be living it up without living the fast way
The older I get, the colder I spit, I’m the boaster and owner a bit
He see cheese, leaves the order a bit
Speak deep freeze, took a form to get
We’re one hit away hah
Pay for play – that’s the only way to make it if you ain’t high
See me I get mad at the chatter splattered
On the baddest rapper that never mattered
This like it never happened
So worldwide buy my last album but might just forget it
There was a man did some cool things
So why so serious?

(Hook)
Why? Why so serious?
I’m so furious. Why so…?
I keep asking myself
Why? I’m so curious
So serious… Why?
And I can’t calm down down down
No, I can’t calm down down down
Call me a sad man
Baby I ain’t so bad (I ain’t so bad)
Maybe it’s just me
Why do I get so mad?
And I can’t come down down down
No, I can’t calm down down down

I can’t calm down!
I can’t calm down!
I can’t calm down!
I can’t calm down!
Down down down
Down down down
