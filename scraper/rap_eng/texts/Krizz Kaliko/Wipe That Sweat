Slow it down baby, wipe that sweat
Turn around baby, wipe that sweat
Do it now baby, wipe that sweat
Bring it down, let me see how hype that get

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Is it the way that I can find a way to be up in here sweatin' with you
Gettin' and pettin' and if you lettin' then I'm steppin' with you
OK, now that we got past the issue of askin' for ass
And if you down with what I'm countin' on then I'm runnin' with you
I see you persperatin' and perspririn
The way that you shakin' look like you'll never be retirin
And better bring it back, better bring it back
And if you packin' a spectacular cunt up in the front
Let me see the back of ya
Well let me flirt with ya, wanna observe ya curves
Tryin' to do dirt with ya, with no one observin'
And you look marvelous, the dogs is hungry girl you starvin' us
I love the way you wigglin' it for all of us
I need my ass with her, with the cash, slip out the
Pocket of my trousers, I can't smash without ya
Put some wait on it and put it in reverse baby doll
Drop it to the floor and bring it up and pause
Sweat your weave out!

[Verse 2: DJ Chill]
And I'm turnin' up the thermostat
Every beezy in the telly knows there ain't no turnin' back
I'm a nasty ass nigga with a rubber
And Y'all know good and damn well I don't love her
Heah, I play the part like Danny Glover
On top of the covers, come on and mop a brother
Turn around and now wipe that sweat
If you ain't got enough cash girl write that check
Bitch please I gets cheese [?] on Hennesey and kush
I'm a playa to the fullest degree
A lap dance in this bitch, don't worry 'bout me please
Do it now, juicy it out baby
You're sweatin' for a reason quit usin' my towel lady
I'm just playin' girl go on and get it
Messin' with this boy I got a towel full of pigs

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Oh Lord look who just entered into the building
Lookin' for grown ass from the bitches up in here livin'
I'm managamous, Hagen Daiz, off in some bootytition
Lookin' whop ba ba loo ba ba wobble so bootylicious
It's the Kansas City Chief and I'm flamed up like a lantern
Damn look at the chain on us man, it's people damagin
I'm Mick Jag' swaggin', I'm big cat status
They never knew that one brother could live that lavish
But back to the story this orderly was your booty galoraly
Shakin' up all over the floor I'm thinkin' it's bout to break off
I know you feelin' it, pardon me, pumpin' through your Valore
And we need a spot to do more when I order and take off
I'm a freaky [?] if you freaky too
We can get naked and play peek-a-boo, you like that shit?
She said well baby, if you man enough to handle this peezy
You gon' need a squeegee to wipe that sweat
