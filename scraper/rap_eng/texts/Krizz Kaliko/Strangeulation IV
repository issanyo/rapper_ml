[Verse 1: Rittz]
I am, too hot to cool off
Blew Atlanta up like Eric Rudolph, and starving in pursuit of moolah
Floss and get your crew robbed, my crew'll shoot at you like "hoorah"
I be on tour and shit, you get on stage and you get boo'd off
You throwing jabs at me but we ain't in no boxing gym
I'll stab you and have you inside of a hospital hooked up to oxygen
So who the hottest? Conversation my name get brought up in
I'm Woody Harrelson, this industry is Zombieland
You wanna fuck with us, you must've had no common sense
I'll kill you then your guts get eaten up by Brotha Lynch
It's Strange Music so the competition nonexistent
All them other record labels fallin' off like rotten limbs
I'm making some money, it's making their stomach cringe
I'll never forget it, a couple of summers ago, I was cooking and scrubbing pans
Drink 'till I get drunk and spin
Puffing something with a lovely scent behind the Cutlass tint
Floating in the Strange stream, who jumpin' in?

[Verse 2: Prozak]
My brain is full of thoughts that are darker than Samhain
That span across the Great Lakes and vast Midwest Plains
Spreading coast to coast like a virus you can't contain
Now a global pandemic, panic courtesy of (STRANGE!)
The biggest independent label, pop the champagne
We don't need no head now, homie you can keep the change
Coming through your speakers, receive us into your blood vein
We the truth like Nostradamus' prophecy quatrains
Snake Bat, Praise that, part of rap since way back
Since the days of 8 tracks and 808's and adaps
Analog cassette decks, steady grinding, what's next?
Starving artist 'til Trav and Tech cut me that advanced check
Strange outcast step child, call me Damien
Five Finger Death Punch straight to the cranium
Flow so sick, could be enriched with uranium
Extraterrestrial, lyrics labeled alien

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Appetite destruction, never been no punk shit
My voices give me choices, just to spite me I choose dumb shit
Choppers all around me, I mean lyrical and literal
Spit it through this microphone and pull up at ya mami's home
Jump out on the dumb shit, speaking through this drum clip
Tearin' flesh, rippin' hips, watch me kill shit
Cypher without the villain, that's appealin' but it's silly though
An army without it's general, an octopi no tentacles
Not trying to be subliminal, nothing I do is minimal
Heavy hitter, heavy words, push a nigga, pushin' verbs
Squish my button, you push my nerves, ten toes in the turf
Not the last or the first, gutta nigga, stomp the Earth
Grippin' metal, I ain't special, on the level
Smack your temple with the barrel, not complying, I'm a rebel
And I'm fresh up out the ghetto, puppet master, I'm Geppetto
Take a minute, you'll get it, nigga, Scoob did it

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
Kali Baby! 'Ight man, I'mma do this! I'm kinda nervous
The purpose of having a cypher is so you can sit here
Wide-eyed, listen, look at me in this position
Now, I coulda just left you sitting there
But Nina told me to pick 'em apart, you're a victim of art
K-R-I to the double crooked, look at him
He pudgy like they took a ugly stick and frickin' shook at him
And I don't stay Gucci down to the linens
I'll let you trick off, she jerking my dick off and grinnin'
You can see him, but he just a figment
You wanna be him, better get your pigment gone
Try to beat him with deliverin'
I get belligerent and that's the end of the song
And I get a little bit ahead of myself, feel like I'mma melt
And I feel like I'm better than everyone else
I guess I be rappin' ahead of my wealth
I'm the coldest thing since the ice cube
Only thing missing from this beat back in the day was Ice Cube
Yeah, I said I'm the best in a minute, nigga what?!
Only niggas that could contest it is rested, dig em up!
Okay! Hahahaha! Whatever, nigga...
