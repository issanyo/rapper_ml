[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hey, you beautiful
I'm tryin' to have my hair stuck off in your cuticles
From cunnilingus I'll bring it if you think I'm suitable
Do you know I'm a fool for you booty so let's go to the whole
Encore baby, tower sweets on 'em
Set that ass on the couch and put your feets on 'em
The way you lookin' baby girl got me foamin'
Smile for me, damn, you got beautiful teeth women
Can I lick them motherfuckers, I gotta do it
Before my dick's in your motherfuckin' mouth
That is what I'm 'bout
Lick it, then I stick it terrific and dash out
Baby you should have did hella commercials
Preferably, Colgate, I know hoes hate
Cause you destined to find your soulmate
But I'm only searchin' seekin' your taste
So smile at me, even growl at me
And I'll run my tongue across
Ya teeth and all the while it be
Mr. fun time, that's if you sexy as fuck
So before we buck, I'mma slap my
Tongue across your gum line

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (2X)
Baby can I lick your teeth? (Yes, you can)
Where I'm at, your mouth looks so sweet (Yes, you can)
So all you gotta do is smile for me
If I'm into you, I'll lick your teeth

[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]
You're the baddest thing I've seen in here tonight
And plus this drink I'm sippin' on, don't got me right!
Now girl, I know this here might sound a little bit eww
But momma don't knock it, 'til you try it
You never know, you just might like it
Plus all this Hennessey, that I've been drankin' makes me feel
Like losin' all in ambitions
Never been with kissin' bitches, I don't know but tonight I
Will make a bit of an exception
I'm a bit intoxicated with the biggest of erections
Plus you grindin' on a nigga, got me feelin' like we sexin'
Frame can make a nigga sin
But gotta face that's straight from heaven
Look good, smell good, plus you got pretty feet
Damn you so sexy to me, I think, I would lick your teeth
(Look good, smell good, plus you got pretty feet
Damn you so sexy to me, I think, I would lick your teeth)
