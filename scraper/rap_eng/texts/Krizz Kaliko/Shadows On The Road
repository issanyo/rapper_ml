[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I see shadows on the road again
Wonder if they comin' for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
And will I ever grow old?

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I 'member them high nights, on X we find sites
To climb heights, unheard to man we lined white
Molly up it had to be non-flight
Mix it with weed and wet it's chronkite
That shits beyond hype
Spittin' somethin' we be trippin', seeing some shit
And it's fuckin' up the buzz of me and the clique
So we hop up in the whip and flee with the quick
But the shadow make us swerve and we on the strip
Did you see the shit? (Yeah I saw the shit)
Did y'all see the shit? (Yeah we saw the shit)
All agree that a shadow was crossin' the street
Then immediately vanished we need a hit

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I see shadows on the road again
Wonder if they comin' for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
And will I ever grow old?

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Is it comin' for me because of all the shit
That I did in the past was bad to people
Mad and evil, if you're the A.O.D. I'm sad to meet you
Angel of death when I quit doin' X
Because of seeing you every night on the stretch
So I've been clean for three years
And counting still I'm seeing shadows will they scheme for me
To follow them into the pit of despair
Punishment for what I did in this lair
What if evil spirits live in the road
To take the kindred spirits' polluted souls
I don't know how the spirit thing goes
Real or livin' in my frontal lobe
Will I be livin' life until I'm old?
Or will I be takin' by shadows on the road?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I see shadows on the road again
Wonder if they comin' for my soul
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in
And will I ever grow old?

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
I be coming home from the studio
Seventy East real real late, you know?
Damn I see like a shadow walk right in front of the car
Like what the hell, you know I be trippin' man
Like I thought I just saw something
Swerve real quick, good thing there ain't no other cars on the road
Fucked yourself up
And I be thinking like the people that wrecked on the side of the road or something
You see those crosses and their names and the roses and you be thinking it might be their spirits
I don't even know if most spirits exist
I don't even know, I don't know what the hell happened man
Is still haunts me to this day if it is a spirit or whatever it is
It's crazy
