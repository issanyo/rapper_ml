[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl
She bad, bad, bad
Bad, Kali Baby, I'm looking for the bad girls
The hood chicks, I'm talking 'bout skally wag

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She's a skally wag
Knows how to give it up
No, she won't turn it down
Knows how to live it up
She's a skally wag
She's such a super freak
She 'bout to turn it up
See what she do to me?
She's a skally wag
Talk with her hips and
Walk with a [?]
Bad little... Whoo!
She's a skally wag
I know I know better
But she got that wet- wet [?]

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Look here, I need a hood chick
She's thick, [?] Snicker, oh my goodness
I wish that I could get with her
What she cooking don't matter 'cause I'm eating it up
She's so rough, [?] ain't no beating it up
Kali, baby mama got them jeans so fitted
When I lick her hit me quicker [?] tell me to get her
And I'm with it, girl you get that
I just can't park my car where you live at
'Cause I really be liking them low life type
Might fight, might wife her
Gucci outfit, but ain't clean, they lifer
[?] better but I ain't never seen none tighter
Fill her full of oh boy, she pull an all nighter
Red phone, white girl, don't matter she's a monkey rich
Krizz Kaliko on deck, she be bumping it
Boost the clothes up out the store whenever she be wanting it
Throw it in a bag, she's a skally wag

[Pre-Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl
She bad, bad, bad
She no good for me, but she good to me
Even if it ain't hood then it ain't no good
That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl
She's so bad, bad
She no good for me, but she good to me
Say it ain't so, I gotta let 'em know

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She's a skally wag
Knows how to give it up
No, she won't turn it down
Knows how to live it up
She's a skally wag
She's such a super freak
She 'bout to turn it up
See what she do to me?
She's a skally wag
Talk with her hips and
Walk with a [?]
Bad little... Whoo!
She's a skally wag
I know I know better
But she got that wet- wet [?]

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Now, she's loose as a goose, but I wouldn't call her ho
She's a super freak, but her girls don't know
She's insatiable meaning she wants some more
Throw that skeleton right in the closet door
Bad kids at home waiting for mama to get back
Stumbling to the door around four and she is toed back
Black heels to hike it up, black tights to hype 'em up
Eyes wide open, drooling on the floor so wipe it up
I need a sister just to kiss her 'cause I sense resistance
I need to come [?] mami think her 'nani the ooh
So if you looking for a hood chick
Want to swig the bottle out the bag, I'm talking skally wag

[Pre-Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl
She bad, bad, bad
She no good for me, but she good to me
Even if it ain't hood then it ain't no good
That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl
She's so bad, bad
She no good for me, but she good to me
Say it ain't so, I gotta let 'em know

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She's a skally wag
Knows how to give it up
No, she won't turn it down

She's a skally wag
I know I know better
But she got that wet- wet [?]
