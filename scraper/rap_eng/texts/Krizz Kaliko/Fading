[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Tell me something good like Rufus of Chaka Khan
Although haters want us to fail, we keep on keepin' it on
Holy water and hell and not a second before dawn
Ya just need amp up the pace because the spotlights on
Hey Man, they say I often preach
Spit it like a wicked evangelist
So only the chosen will understand this
Too complex for one dementional minds
I'm a monster in make-up who wake up and get high
Cause in my all life I'm blessed with sorrow and pain
Got the occasional happy day to keep from being mundane
I'm insane like my armada and the killers I roll with
Pandora's box was never ment to be open
Close caption, my want is take action
And hit em when there asleep or just relaxing
Never see it coming, Prozak started up the death machine
And I'm riding in the front seat with someone's blood covering me

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Here, is darkness where I am
I don't know where I am
I'm slowly fading...
And it's here, this darkness is where I stay
If I can't find my way
It's where I'm staying...

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Sometimes I feel so down and depressed
Sometimes I feel that the weight
Of the whole world sits on my chest
Sometimes at night I try to sleep but then I can't catch my breath
Sometimes I try to cope with stress
Feeling that there's nothing left, put to rest
Man, I started path of wicked about a decade ago
I was destend to bring darkness to records and microphones
You can hate this if you want but I'm still going call this home
Fuck the mainstream radio, play the wicked we walk alone
Never intended for the weak minds to understand or except this
Donâ€™t end up another statistics, devils reject it
Test it and what going to find is this shits true
That this audience we supply will devistate you
Going to desecrate you, never did trust you'
That's okay that you don't like us, because we fucking hate you
So ironic in view of sycotic, morphed, and balistic
When ya'll should be on Prozak
Because mainstream minds are twisted

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
I'm a maniac by trade
Raised by public enemy number one
By tearing domes out the game
And I'd be careful because every word that you say
Is another way for people to imulate you everyday
And then hate it in everyway
And when you face with it, it's on some hater shit
Catered to that mainstream bitch
And get some play with it, I'm straight with it
I'm wickedest when I'm sittin here with this pen
And it's given me the grin, even like the purest of sin
And if I let it loose to a bottle of grey goose
By the time the cops come I'll be firing on them too
If you can hear the thunder now, I'm underground
You wonder how I've never been found
Even with the wickedest sound I hover around
My fingers up in your face
And all you weak ass sell outs
Ain't nothing more than motherfucken disgraces
And I'm hiding from all the fakes
Who dominantly want to take from my mind
Of something so twiztid but I turn them away

[Hook]
