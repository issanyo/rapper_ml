[Intro – 1 Ton]
You do all the worst things, but you the best thing that ever happened to me

[Verse 1 – 1 Ton]
Yeah, baby you just my type
You always down to get drunk, and you can handle your high
You got an independent mind and you ain’t scared of a fight
You always help me get right, and you can hang with my life
My lovable lush, my wonderful crush
I know that you can speak your mind and never cover shit up
And you can check me when I’m the wrong
One look and I can read your eyes
We living on the wild side and me and you is ride or die
Dirty money, [?] hard like it’s a honeymoon
Spending every night together, can never get enough of you
Quick to roll a joint and really love eating steaks
Farted on them scrawny bitches scared of gaining weight
Fucked up just like me, we swap meat, wearing white tees
In Vegas on New Year’s in the fast lane going light speed
You want to fight me but in the morning love me back
Cause me and you, little mama, is just a perfect match

[Hook – Krizz Kaliko]
Baby you a troublemaker
Love the way you take it there, come and take it there
Little mama’s like a ride or die
We smoke till we’re high, la la la la la, what’s up
Baby you a troublemaker
Love the way you take it there, come and take it there
And she ain’t right
But I don’t care cause she’s just my type, what’s up

[Verse 2 – Underrated]
She’s the shit, you can’t deny
Don’t bite her lip, she speaks her mind
She’s ride or die, one of a kind
I get butterflies, she’s so fine
Sipping wine, she owns a gun
When trouble comes, she doesn’t run
Bump hip hop, not bubble gum
Top shelf bitch, she’s number one
Her skin is so soft, body perfect like Photoshop
Tittys and asses everywhere, I swear this girl is smoking hot
Jealous bitches be talking shit, she laughs it off cause it doesn’t matter
She’s the baddest, ain’t nobody badder
Everybody in the club want to get at her
In the car she don’t want to talk
Just bang the beat all down the block
Turns me on and pisses me off
But she lets me know that I’m the boss
Never once will snitch to cops
When I’m gone she watch the crop
Sniffing coke and smoking pot
We’re going hard, still taking shots
The best there ever was, if I stick around I might fall in love
She’s the cure when I’m in pain
She’s always there, I can’t complain
She’s the smartest, she knows me well
When I’m fucking up she can always tell
She’s my little piece of heaven who puts me through hell

[Hook – Krizz Kaliko]
Baby you a troublemaker
Love the way you take it there, come and take it there
Little mama’s like a ride or die
We smoke till we’re high, la la la la la, what’s up
Baby you a troublemaker
Love the way you take it there, come and take it there
And she ain’t right
But I don’t care cause she’s just my type, what’s up
