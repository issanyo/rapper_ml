[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Is anybody listening?
It's like I'm yelling, but I'm whispering
It's like it doesn't even matter
(I'm talking fast), but it's idle chatter
If you can feel me, hear me out
I got something to talk about
I promise I won't waste your time
Nevermind, I'm lying

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Hello walls, hello ceiling
No one's home, and I'm feeling
All alone
Hello bed, hello pillow
When I'm high, I still feel low
No one knows me like my things
But no one answers when I scream:
"Hello walls!"
(And I keep feeling invisible)

[Verse 2: Jester]
I can't take off this disguise
Stacy baby I miss my eyes
My appetite for destruction is hungry for prescription pills
Cracks in my character this subscription fills
Pain don't tell me addiction kills
I'm startin' to suffocate
Strangled by a cabinet, smothered by the crate
Can't keep dressin' up my torment, why do I cover the ache
I don't wanna stay on this roller coaster
Depression I'm holdin' closer
Stains in my personality, I'm foldin' over
Relapse from the withdraws
I just wanna cave in & collapse these walls
Slip through the cracks in my floors
I keep tellin' myself I'm not alone
Thoughts diggin' deep, I forgot I'm sewn
I can tie this knot on my own
My thirst for destruction is why my mouths cotton never dries
I'm sorry because I never apologise
I heard I don't look the same in Amira & Molly's eyes
Everythin' I love about myself disappears
Karly baby, daddy misses his ears

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Laying in this bed I fear
Me filling my brain with some leads right near
I think if I do this my head I clear
Or maybe I should overdose on these meds right here?
Everytime I get ahead a wall hits me, fall quick
Do y'all history, when it came to my artistry it was all iffy
The laws just be raw, this we call shifty
Tall chips to fix me, ball, stalled, it be all thrifty
I don't let nobody see my pain behind these walls
Bet this blade will help me see my veins
Cause these walls are caving in and the ceiling's getting closer to me
Everybody is unhappy with me and taking away all dough's a doozy
I feel so, helpless and nervous that I will go ill
So freaking real though and spill slow
Caribou Coffee tryna stop my 'Bou Lou mill
So my grill show daily, but nightly tears upon my pillow
Right now I'm real low
So..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Hello walls, hello ceiling
No one's home, and I'm feeling
All alone
Hello bed, hello pillow
When I'm high, I still feel low
No one knows me like my things
But no one answers when I scream:
"Hello walls!"
(And I keep feeling invisible)

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
My life looks like a party that never ends
I can't tell what's business and what's friends
I think they pretend to like me
And then I'm slightly get thrown off my look now
Why they phone of the hook, huh?
It's getting harder, to make it through the weekend
I try to push it farther, they act like I ain't speaking
I walk to the door, there's no one else to walk to
I talk to the wall, there's no one else to talk to
(And I keep feeling invisible)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Hello walls, hello ceiling
No one's home, and I'm feeling
All alone
Hello bed, hello pillow
When I'm high, I still feel low
No one knows me like my things
But no one answers when I scream:
"Hello walls!"
(And I keep feeling invisible)
