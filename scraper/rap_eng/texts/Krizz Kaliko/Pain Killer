(The Hole)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
My painkillers' in my dresser, right next to my rester
What insane brain would agree to this gesture?
To unjest less stress left with no extra
View's a mess, true depressed steps can infect ya
I'm a product of some shit gone wrong
Even though I speak to many, with a hit song tone
Even though I'm famous and I'm giving chicks long dong
Man, I feel like the coppertop just a sick stone throne
One Flew Over The Cucoo's Nest, then he cashed some beaucoup checks
But he was not nearly stable to crew new Tech
As a, phenomenon, but karma wanna noose dudes' neck
Designer of death, get to choose who's next
Is it real to you?
But if you got evil you kind to come and steal a few
Condemned souls, cause of what the old painkiller do
Keep having these dreams of me taking my nine milla
Who can help me execute this desire to pop a pill or two?

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
You can't give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpless and need some thing to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D, but he has none in store for me
So when the raining pours on me, my dream fulfill us
Painkillers

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
My pain comes from me, being a fuck up
With Strange Music we, really we lucked up
Cause being a lost soul got my bucks up
Even though my cerebral cortex and spirit
Needed a touch up
Everybody around me hurting and shit
While everybody on TV, kicking it, reject,jerkin and shit
I be the one on stage and studio stressed out
Workin and spit
This shit to the people that I know
That I got a lotta evil lurkin and quick
Women want me-want me, so they flaunt the monkey
Even during sex sometimes
A heap of stress still
Wants to haunt me
When I grabbed the yalk she couldn't talk
And it was no humpty-dumpty
Even though I'm sick in the head we kicks it like a donkey, don't we?
My apology to everyone who've been labeled a victim
I be losing my mind, I just picked up the nine and I gripped 'em
And I put it off in a direction like I was the Kiss one
I always think about the day when I'm able to pull back and I click 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
No meds for me, just lead for me
Any light inside of my head is just too dead to see
Any kind a way out of this whole, can I pull this darkness out of this soul?
A lot of people wanna know how it's sold
Cause a lot of motherfuckers' having doubt on this globe
And I'm one of 'em
You can see it on the television, everybody trippin', it's a ton of them
Straight feeling that pain, go insane then bang and it ain't no none of 'em
Many ways to end these days when the darkness make you wanna shun the sun
Ten million ways to die when you constantly cry and the gun is one
