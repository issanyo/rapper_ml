[Intro - Krizz Kaliko]
See I don't know what you've been told
Somebody told me
Never trust a man with a smiling face
Just might be the day of life they take


[Verse One - Kutt Calhoun]
This here be a letter from the heart
Does anybody listen anymore?
I dunno what where how when why
And who I'm trusting anymore
Everybody got the same look, hard to decipher what's real
My little homie Layne just got tamed but he copped 5 with a deal
Does that really mean that he snitching when he's smiling
Tellin' me that it's official
Guess I'm gonna find out in his discovery
If it's game that he's spittin'
Can't even trust my own girl, I done fucked up too much
Keep havin' dreams of her fucking other niggas
Man it's just my luck
My own baby mama got it in for me
When she tellin' me shit's straight
Got a weird feelin' everytime I talk to her now we being taped
By some jealous ass bitch nigga thinkin' me and her in cahoots
Any given day and they speak no words when they shoot
This is what I deal with daily, ain't enough pills to lay me
Down to sleep, I don't even trust a cheap life when you feel this crazy
That alone will decay me, lettin' all this realness fade me
Please Lord God
If and there's a way, let me see the real one's faces

[Hook - Krizz Kaliko][x6]
What's that smile you wearing
What's that smile you wear

[Verse Two - Kutt Calhoun]
Look at Hillary Clinton when she speak
Looking like the devil with a grin
Got it in for what Bill did then, canâ€™t wait to put it to an end
Hope Barack Obama got a plan, everybody waiting on you man
To get assassinated cause they all hatin'
Better be related to the Klan
Hope you got a vest when it comes, Better yet a section of yard
Would be killers who don't give a fuck sent to protect when you run
Look at John Melville's state, think he had a smile when he aimed?
Shot and killed, life was sealed, hit an old lady in the face
The world is full of monsters, you can see it hide behind the grin
Watch the movie there's a hidden message
Cause I think they all devil advocates
Even mama when she on the drugs
Different person when you give her hug
Everything you say and do is artificial
When you got the poison in your blood
Don't go to church that much, found out the reverend's a bold face liar
Get the money, get the whip, get the house and get they feels on a 12 year old
But they smile all in your face
And then they tell you the Lord is great
I just hope they all burn in hell
When I bail and they smile in my face

[Hook][x6]

[Verse Three - Kutt Calhoun]
Pac was a Martin Luther Kin" died young cause he had a dream
To make it necessary for each and every man and woman to make amends
Told us all to smile through the madness, couldn't understand what he had then
Now I recognize he was prophesied, angel in disguise in his passing
Don't know what this shit mean, Good and bad do the same thing
Till I know Imma walk around with a gun
Before I let the streets take me
Stress level at a new high, look around everybody a suspect
The man at the liquor store, the women at the mall, ain't nobody worth trustin'
Smiles every motherfucking where nigga go everybody ain't happy
Where the snakes at, show the comment, why the jealous ones was the one to cap me
Keep smiling I keep brawling and I feel like Imma catch an end soon
Before you get me, Imma get you, don't visit me up in the pen fool
Cause you just gonna come with a smile, sayin' everything's ok
When I know that's all just bullshit I'm never gonna see the light of day
I'd rather just talk to myself, I swear to god it's better that way
Cause I feel ain't nobody real like I'm real, There, now I said it
Good day!
