[Intro: Krizz Kalko]
Nueve!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
The rapper you gotta have in your chatter
You be gathering data, to mom and dad it's a matter
Cause they lad is fanatical, for this Vladic, this radical
Add a skill that brings avid adolescents to drag us
Everywhere in there beats by, they be loving the speech
I teach my beast, I eat when records released by
They favorite artist, invaded they hardest
The way that it started, my latest they'd have paid it regardless
Ever been to a Tech show? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)
Then why you stopping and popping me out the deck for?
Hear that I got the best flow? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)
Granny clipping, tripping with Ellie and Jethro
For listenin' to my music they choose it, they use it
As therapy they're on me when I do this, they lose it
Mom and daddy wanna ban me, I'm loud like a wild banshee
I'm rowdy and antsy, maybe that's why they can't stand me for real

[Hook: Tech N9ne & (Krizz Kaliko)]
These are people who can't stand me
Your mama, your daddy, your greasy-ass granny
Who be callin' me uncanny
Your mama, your daddy, your greasy-ass granny
They tell you: ("I'm no good to you," but you don't listen to me
I'm the one you love, but your people can't stand me)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
She knew this rap kid was a stack getta
But dad lit up, when he saw that the kid was a black nigga
And she's a wack bitch, if you fight back with her
And her mama's mad sick, cause the lad's dick is from Africa
That's why they always act shady, we splat babies right at Brady's
That's maybe the worst for a white lady, that's racy
No longer match-makey, when the blacks
Attack wack, they be watchin' the mac lately
Ever been with a black dude? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)
You're prolly thinkin' we all weed and tattoos
Ever thought white and black's cool? (I haven't, I haven't, I haven't)
That's cause you think your daughters' gettin' her back bruised
Your mom's in your business, she's in your business
Can't you see she wants you to keep us niggas at a distance?
Separation existin', and here's cold
This story took place when I was 16 years old, yo

[Hook]

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Ves, que ellos dicen
Que soy malo para ti
Si tu me amas
Te puedo deshonrar, deshonrar
No soy bueno
Pero te amo, te amo
No soy bueno
Pero te amo, te amo
