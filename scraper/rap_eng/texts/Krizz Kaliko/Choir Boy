[Bridge]
Is anybody listening
Can anybody hear me
Is everybody listening
Can everybody feel me

[Verse 1]
When I was little, my momma would sing about ya, she'd sing about ya
Then I got to thinkin' of me without ya, where'd I be without ya?
(You gave) Me more than just a little bit
(You save) Me more than just a little bit
(My life) I never would get over it
(Survive) I really shoulda' been dead
I feel tainted, embarrassed for you to see me
And I'm praying that you'll never leave me

[Hook]
(I'm your) Choir boy
Somebody help me
Somebody save me, I'm losing the faith that you gave me
(I'm your) Choir boy
My mama's worried
I'm gonna hurt me, I'm godly, but I'm just too worldly
Choir boy

[Bridge]
Is anybody listening
Can anybody feel me
Is everybody listening
Can everybody feel me

[Verse 2]
Caught up in the middle, I straddle the fence
Your armor is my only defense, yeah
Watch over me and make me believe it
Prepare me so that I can receive it, I'm your

[Hook]
Choir boy
Somebody help me
Somebody save me, I'm losing the faith that you gave me
Choir boy
My mama's worried
I'm gonna hurt me, I'm godly, but I'm just too worldly

[Verse 3]
See the devil is waitin' on ya
The Creator is waitin' on ya
What side will ya choose
It's wrong or it's right, It's black or it's white
You can lose if you listen to the fake bologna
See I sat in the pews
Can't do enough to pay your dues
Get the good book, follow the rules
And faith is the only way to get to the gateway safe
And kick it with the King of Jews
