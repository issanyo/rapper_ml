[Hook : Krizz Kaliko]
De de de de de da de da de da de de
Guns spray when problems come my way
Affiliation is a must where I come from
Don't want no problems, then go back where you come from Watch out

Guns spray when problems come my way
Affiliation is a must where I come from
Don't want no problem then go back where you come from Watch out

[Verse 1 : Tech N9ne]

I've been a problem
Ever since ever since I was squabbling
With the doctors I gots to get out this twat, then I'm mobbin em
Scorpion, morphed up in this
Course I've been hit by Kevorkians
By a Messiah, Esquire now let the torch begin
How many sins are left within when you wobbling war
Warriors with us when it's wanted without wobbling whores
Full of malice and more
Give us gallons of gore
Pour it on merciless jerkin it's, made my house almost poor
Man up, nigga it's time to stand up, nigga
Ran to get grands never slammed a jammed up nigga
'85 Bloods hit my block and I watched it
Kansas City adopted, with Cali niggas concocted
Now even Portland, Oregon's on some mob shit
Launch them rockets, take them sockets up out your knot quick
No need to mock this, stop, don't pop shit
Cause the Devil's on this level forever making it hot bitch
