[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm kinda jealous of my dick sometimes
Cause its always on their mind
I'm kinda jealous of my dick for sure
Cause they seem to love you more, baby
I'm kinda jealous of my dick you know
But it gets me what I need
I'm kinda jealous of my dick for sure
Cause they love you more than me baby

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You ever been in a predicament
When you and your lady are fussin'
And cussin'
And she dont wanna deal with you but you
Pull out your dick and get to stickin'
Her and all of a sudden wanna chill
And have a meal with you
Thats crazy right? She ain't even got a feel for you
All she want is the pecker to fetch her
My tally wacker to break her
Back and no [chatter]
When she mad at you no matter
What kinda ill you do
My dick get all the love
So many women got jaws for blood
They even give draws they kissin balls but no kiss at all for mug
(Hahh) I no my breath dont stink
Any more neglect and my chest go sink
Baby I want love and a kiss thang
It's pain
But I'm sayin' I'm kinda jealous of my dick, man

[Hook]
I'm kinda jealous of my dick sometimes
Cause its always on their mind
I'm kinda jealous of my dick for sure
Cause they seem to love you more
I'm kinda jealous of my dick you know
But it gets me what I need baby
I'm kinda jealous of my dick for sure
Cause they seem to love you more

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I can already see the call
They don't wanna be with me at all
They just wanna do D to balls
I shouldn't a ever let it be free to ya'll
Cause my heart be hurtin'
But my private part be squrtin'
I don't even get a touch it in spurts
Whenever I'm lookin' for love and sex be certain
I even have a lot sayin'
I ain't givin you none but I can suck you off. Damn!
I don't think I would ever cut you off
Cause look at the crazy amount of nuts you lost
But they all wanna bone me
They don't want to get to know me
They wanna dome me but I'm hungry
For lovin' I never get because of my dick, bitch I'm lonely

[Hook]
I'm kinda jealous of my dick sometimes
Cause its always on their mind
I'm kinda jealous of my dick for sure
Cause they seem to love you more
I'm kinda jealous of my dick, you know
But it gets me what I need
I'm kinda jealous of my dick for sure

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Kali Baby!
It gets me in to problems and it gets me out
Gets me into arguments and don't even know what it's about.
Call him the Black n' Decker pecker he's a home wrecker
Drops 'em to they knees and he's a little chin checker
See it's either him or me
Lately we becoming enemies
Only likely when I'm in between them
And they say they love me
When I'm in the V
I try to tell them get out
And then they spit out
And they scream my ding-a-ling they can't live without
Abusin my unit, just wish they love me more then my middle

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
I said you love me but I hate you, Fo' Sho'
You can't see me but I've watched you
Kinda women that you love them (hoes)
If there's a way to stop it I don't, know, Kind of jealous
(I'm kinda jealous of my dick you know)
It's crazy crazy crazy, I'm kind of jealous
(I'm kinda jealous of my dick for sure)
My johnson, my unit, my peter, my trunk, my everything wrong
I'm kinda jealous. Kinda jealous of my dick sometimes
Yeah...
