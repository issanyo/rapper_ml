[Intro]
Strange! Music!
Okay! Kali Baby, watch 'em lose it

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothin' to see me out with a bad one
Give me on one of them KC Teas and then add one
Couple shots ready to go
Her song come on and she dropping it low
Must of had too much to drink but had fun

[Chorus]
I keep a bad bitch on the side of my hip
You see it
And I always had a good grip
You see it
I talk a lot of shit but I push a big whip
You see it
Good girl ain't nothing but a flip
You see it
She never been scared to just (Buss it x25) x4

[Verse 2]
A 1,2,3
I come through stunting
It ain't nothing to me
To a boss it's nothing
Couple of shots ready to go
My song come on and then I hit the flo'
I buy the whole club a drink to have fun

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Pull up in my own trucks
Smelling like last night liquor
Give no fucks
Slap five with my broseph - Joseph
Hit up Tecca Nina new crib so we can roll up
It's like I've never been to [?]
Got it Kaliko it all time nothing iz-else
Got me a bad little rare bone
Sexy little slam from the gym with the headphones
She a dime or at least 2-5
She give me goo-goo eyes or ooh-aahs from the pu wah wah
Hope she got the blade out
'fore she laid out and played out
If you're rocking Mufasa
She stay on me like a bad scar
See that ass I'm on it fast like a Nascar
Then we are
She get to hit it, get it, lit it
If she missing know I

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Strange! Music!
Okay! Kali baby, now you can lose it
