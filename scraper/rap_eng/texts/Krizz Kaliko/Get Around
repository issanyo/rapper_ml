[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Oooo ohhhhh, Kali baby!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Gave me, gave me, you not offer baby, shame on you
Now I'm naming you with gangs of babes I gave it to
Now it's in front of you, I know you know I want it too
But we stay co-cool cause I get around

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Kortney Leveringston])
(I get around)
Just let me do what I do
(Don't hold me down, down, down)
I wouldn't do it to you
(It's alright)
If you wanna act like a ho
(For one night)
As long as you know

(That I get around)
Wo-oh, wo-oooh
(That I get around)
Wo-oh, wo-oooh
(That I get around)

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
It's you, it's me, now what you want from me?
It's me, it's you, got what I want from you?
Whatever happened to the groupies?
Who wanna meet me just to do me
We ain't gotta get all crazy
I ain't called ya, now ya hate me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
It's you, it's me, now what you want from me?
It's me, it's you, got what I want from you?
Cause I get around like doughnut, don't I?
Boner, big kahuna (yeah!)
Said anything to make them come out their linen
It's Kali, a magnum for the women
You gave it up cause you was lovin' my show
I'm going just 'til they letting me go
Talking with fans, they like Kali sound
But don't fall in love with me, baby!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I'm an amazing, living a making
L-O-V-E completely I'm taken
Into the muttin but I'm leaving her something
Got her something, but I'm leaving you money, for the wanton
Many moves I get it, any poon I wet it quick
And I can't let it sit, I don't got no etiquette
Women are fetishists, eat' em up like lettuce
And fed her cheddar and then I'mma getta

[Hook]
