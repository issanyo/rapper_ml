[Verse 1]
Before I get started, a couple things that I'm addressin
I'd like to thank you for my blessings, some name stars, quaze hearts
Niggas say I'm like Elroy Jetson
Getting paper's good and make them good
If I got to raise em in the same neighborhood
Where the killers and they babies still, I ain't prejudice
But thank God I ain't gotta live in Connecticut
A fool
Give me some kids on the earth
But if I'm a be away from em they gon be away from me
I gotta get up and to work
And I gotta pick the bill so the strapping gotta work for me
But she was in my corner
That's my girl, that's my mama
Thank God I learned about this music from em

[Hook]
(Thank God for) sex, (Thank God for) pain
(Thank God for) life, (Thank God for) rain
(Thank God for) Love, (Thank God for) hate
(Thank God for) tears, (Thank God I'm) here
(Thank God for) Sex, (Thank God for) pain
(Thank God for) Life, (Thank God for) rain
(Thank God for) Love, (Thank God for) hate
(Thank God for) Tears, (Thank God I'm) blue
Thank God for you

[Verse 2]
I ain't taking it back
Thank God for the Snake and the Bat
And I'm statin the facts, save me from breaking my back
Or robbing a safe full of stacks
Seem like we saving the rap from the paper planes in the back
When the paper stays in the sack
Your hear what they play on airway
Strangers say that it's whack so we save up for mac
There's gotta be a God somewhere, someone who cares
I stay on bended knee and hope the Father answers prayers
But still some still don't believe
You're seeing G.O.D. you're seeing me
Thank God for...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And I thank God for this woman of mine
Cus she be loving a nigga and taking care of me and mine
And she think that she fine
You getting lucky if you finally get me loving every kind
He set to told me
Infest a leaf, instead I love this movie
And I love how she love to do me
She never gave me trouble with the way I doubled it and give it to me
Okay, had to wait on my soul mate
Never in her face with colgate
And if it's all the same
I love having a ball and chain
If I'm locked they'll need no paroling baby
Mama, in a way you never drama-free
But I'm a be connected to you at the hip
Plus I be on, I got way too much lift
Somebody gotta pay these bills
Somebody gotta cook these meals
Somebody gotta tell these women they got celebrity niggas and they supposed to feel
I know I do the fool more than I used to but shit we going though it cool
If I had it to do again
It would truly end with me choosing you

[Hook]
