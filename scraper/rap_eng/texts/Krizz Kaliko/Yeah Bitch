Yeah bitch

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
If this gonna pop off baby then let it pop off
Niggas think I Mardi Gras the way I take their top off
I'm laughing at you hardy har but blowing the socks off
Your girly, if she naughty after the party probably'll get knocked off
And I'm that nigga to keep one on the side of me
Pull that trigger, quit muggin' and say "hi" to me
Kali's a go-getter, a nigga but I'm heaven sent
No Bloods, Strange Music's all I represent
Give me from outta the cold, Paul Wall got my mouth frost bitten
Open it to talk, y'all need ya when I'm eatin'
But I bet the house, honk, tell the bitch to get in
My son's car need rear sitting
Women be all up on Kali like I'm Diddy and White Lenny
They all that surround me, latino and white women
In the club Mr. L. J. Watson I'm fightin' women
Black as hell, but I love light women
(Hey!) Yeah bitch!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Screaming out so they hear me like (Yeah bitch!)
In the crowd they be women like (Yeah bitch!)
If you dreaming come and get me like (Yeah bitch!)
Money all that you about, holla out (Yeah bitch!)
I'm screaming out so they hear me like (Yeah bitch!)
In the crowd they be women like (Yeah bitch!)
If you dreaming come and get me like (Yeah bitch!)
Money all that you about, holla out (Yeah bitch!)

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
When I said yeah bitch I mean yeah beatrice
She saying that she love me but I know she's an actress
That's usually how they get when I been in they catfish
Ain't tripping but it's feelings they catches
And after the workin' I'm sayin' I'm out, not takin' 'em out
I'm figured I'm out so I put a dick in they mouth
She gets it right in the lip and I'm out
And they screamin' out Kaliko, hear it on your radio
I represent Juggalos and take 'em everywhere I go
I'm a consistent misfit, you don't listen, missed it
Persistent tips man, tryna get rich
And if it's over then I be slow rollin' in my Cadilac
I don't know how to act, I'm out the back

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Screaming out so they hear me like (Yeah bitch!)
In the crowd they be women like (Yeah bitch!)
If you dreaming come and get me like (Yeah bitch!)
Money all that you about, holla out (Yeah bitch!)
I'm screaming out so they hear me like (Yeah bitch!)
In the crowd they be women like (Yeah bitch!)
If you dreaming come and get me like (Yeah bitch!)
Money all that you about, holla out (Yeah bitch!)
