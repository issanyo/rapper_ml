[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
And sometimes I
I don't, I don't feel good
Not physically, but like ment...mentally
...Mentally
It's like I lose myself, like I'm not
Krizz anymore like ....
Unstable

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
It seems like I would've fixed it
But I've been gone for way too long
Put a band-aid on it to fix it
But I've been barely hanging on
If this is hell, then I need help
So dark it's like I never see the sun
It's like I'm dreaming, but feels so real
And I can't be the only one

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Unstable! Give me a reason
Cause I can't stop, been thinkin' 'bout leaving
I'm so unstable, and I need help
Cause I can't do it by myself
Unstable! Give me a reason
Cause I can't stop, been thinkin' 'bout leaving
I'm so unstable, and I need God
Cause by myself its just too hard
So unstable

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Now I'm back on my coocoo medicine, it's better then
Feeling like I'd rather be in heaven if it never end
Either that or added soon to a padded room
Wish I could come back up in the womb, if there was any room
Unbirth me, this Earth hurts me
Said I'm beserk, not a single person heard me
Up and down, like working out and doing a Bur-pee
If life's a beach, then can we at least go surfing (Okay)
My scruples are gone (Ah-Huh)
I done been around a Soo-Woo group, brains are noodle soup
Pain got me jumping through these hoops
That's why I'm jumping back up in this booth
So I can figure it out and get it out
Wanna get rid of it so I gotta let it out
I'm still breathing but feeling completely

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Unstable! Give me a reason
Cause I can't stop, been thinkin' 'bout leaving
I'm so unstable, and I need help
Cause I can't do it by myself
Unstable! Give me a reason
Cause I can't stop, been thinkin' 'bout leaving
I'm so unstable, and I need God
Cause by myself its just too hard
So unstable

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Make it up, out of it, battle it, take a hit
Gotta get out of it before it gets malignant
I'm digging my own grave, and being my own slave
I figure it's gon' take a miracle one day
To get it up off me, it's killing me softly
The feeling is awfully, like jittering from coffee
Panic disorder, got me thinking it's over
Can't be feeling this torture, but it's fully a scorcher
Kali Baby, may be crazy since the day that he was born
But if he raised in three days, maybe he can get me through this storm

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Unstable! Give me a reason
Cause I can't stop, been thinkin' 'bout leaving
I'm so unstable, and I need help
Cause I can't do it by myself
Unstable! Give me a reason
Cause I can't stop, been thinkin' 'bout leaving
I'm so unstable, and I need God
Cause by myself its just too hard
So unstable

Cause I've been finding myself praying a lot lately reaching out to God
Cause
Well
Unstable
