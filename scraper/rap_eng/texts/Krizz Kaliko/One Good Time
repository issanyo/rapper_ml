Just give me one good time
Nobody is looking at me anyway
Nobody is looking at me anyway
Yo
Yo

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm hardcore, know how to start wars
Know how to scar yours in a fist fight
'Cause toughness is our floor, warriors that bar nor
But this one is far tore up on this night
Some people show it and then, some people hide it
But other people they do it whenever they get excited
But me I can't even do it when the wrongs all mine
I'm saying I've been trying to do it for a long long time
I get jealous when I see people do it and it's like fluid
I'm thinking how can they swallow that when I can't even chew it
I guess God seen it fit to label me the consoler
Bestowed upon a broken show and forever be the shoulder
My mission is plain to see, it's freaking insanity
I'm wishing the pain in me would just leave me be why can't it be
Simple 'cause on the real this one could die
So I'm asking God Before I go just give me one good cry

[Hook]
If I could cry maybe one good time
I could wash away all my pain and maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
So I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway

[Verse 2]
Why I got to be the one to cheer up, people until they clear up
When I sneeze I tear up, and then I go look in a mirror
So I can see how it looks, when I really wanna know how it feels
When I'm hella down I try to push, no matter how hard no water spills for real
My patience is soon to go, waiting for the balloon to blow
I'm thinking back to when I used to go to funerals
No matter how close we were, on the inside it ached while
Others be losing it, I'm wishing I could just break down
And I been to a lot of them, and there's not a one
That went on and got it done, no moisture that even try even to come
And this ain't no tough thing, 'cause I've had enough pain
Tears should be runnin' like Mustang's, man it must rain
Been trying for years, but the crying been inside
And the Nina so serious, there ain't no lying in his eyes
And it makes me so furious, when I look and I'm in genocide
Please let me break down with the pain I felt when Brian Dennis died
One time..

[Hook]
If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
So I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway

[Verse 3]
I look at actors crying, it's as easy as fondue
But what do you do when extreme hurt is upon you
Real life ain't no movie homie, and this ain't John Woo
But I almost lost it at the ending of John Q
And I almost lost it when Jennifer Hudson blew
But I'm still waiting for that real emotion to come through
Then maybe I could get a cry God
Maybe one, two?
Been red for life for the first time ever me want blue
(What?)
Give me the blues, sometimes I turn on the news
And I look at all these feuds, then I try to make them ooze
(Don't cry, no teardrops from your eye
Poetry's music oh my, almost made me tear up about thinking about my children, no lie)
Maybe I'm black hearted, you thinking damn he shady
Or saying man he crazy, for the way I abandon me lady
One day she can repay me, yes that woman can betray me
Then I'll probably cry if not than I do it if I win me a Grammy maybe

[Hook]
If I could cry maybe one good time
I could wash away all my pain, and maybe free my mind
After my shows, it's a lonely road
So I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time, hey, hey
Nobody's looking at me anyway
