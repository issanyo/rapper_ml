[Hook]
Lacrimosa
Tears are so serious
Come, Holy Spirit
Stay with me always
Suffer, my true love
It tears up my face

[Verse 1]
Now-now-now-now people cussing and busting
They get nothing but in the ground when they blown out
Oh wow, tell me how he got the stubborn, he tough and
He was young with a grown mouth
Zoned out cause my mother is gone, how
Simply would he send me with the alone route
Bone out, to the studio hitting the Don Julio
My duty go if I'm moody yo, get up and get the song out
My angel fades, then came more rage
And even though Strange still pays, something inside of me saying it ain't yo days
My religion, walking away
My prediction, lost in the gray
I'm thinkin' the holy spirit don't really wanna hear it
So people who givin' me evil, they all finna pay
Anybody really want it, I'mma get dirty when a demon is my opponent
Feeling froggy any moment, know you will never be the owner because I'm on it
Losing mama, really did it, demons really gonna get it
I'm looking for the light
I'm asking you open and losing all of my inner good
And the hope with it

[Hook]
Lacrimosa (Inside I'm weeping)
Tears are so serious (Constantly seeking)
Come Holy Spirit
Stay with me always
Suffer my true love
It tears up my face

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear no punk say "weirdo"
If you ain't in my circle, then you're not even near, bro
Here go the fear though
Getting the zilla and my killas in the villa
To make a racket in your ear go (BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM)
That is severe mode, bodies I'm not even with the jolly
My tears go (DOWN-MY-FACE) yeah
But I'm switching the gears, yo
Got on the plane to Colorado
I go to hit the Summer Jam, then momma tomorrow
Hoping the Lord will give me time on the Movado
To say I love her before the Bible go hollow (GONE-GONE-GONE-GONE)
My show was sorrow, needed a little bit of mo' time to borrow
(MY-TIME'S- UP)
Man, steady talking to God, so I don't - get it
Thought I was special enough for God to be with it
By giving me another day with my mother, but I missed it
For rocking with Denver said in her name, I'mma rip this (DONE-DONE-DONE-DONE)
This ain't no way to be, hella jaded, see, but I'm created
My mother love me, but her death ain't okay with me
Still I'm praying for her spirit to stay with me

[Hook]
Lacrimosa (Outside I'm weeping)
Tears are so serious (Still I am seeking)
Come, Holy Spirit
Stay with me always

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Lacrimosa (When you interview me, I don't wanna talk about this)
Tears are so serious (I don't denounce God in any way)
Come, Holy Spirit
Stay with me always
Somehow (I just feel)
My true love (my mother's suffering)
The tears on (was too great for how much she worshipped)
My face..
