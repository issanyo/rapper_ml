[1st Verse: Big Scoob]
White bitch tryna shake that ass
For me no rhythm
So I stop up in the pop
To put a little nigga in her
She thick for a little white bitch
But I like 'em so thick
That it stank just a bit
I ain't playin'
Man I love that chocolate
Apple bottom jeans
See a bone when she drop it
That's a different story
Let's get back to topic
(This bitch thick!)
Yeah baby girl poppin'
From the back she look just like a sista
'Bout to bend it like a twista
Than I pass it to my nigga
(She a flippa!)
Got it goin' off the liqour
Plus she love a rap nigga
White bitches get it in much quicker
(Don't kiss her!)
Now I gotta take a picture
Gotta send it to my niggas
Gotta ask him if I'm trippin' off the liquor
(My nigga!)
She's thick like a gutta black bitch
You ain't never seen a white bitch thick like this

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I get crunk like i come from down South
White girls wanna kiss me in my mouth
Keep playin' I'mma show you what it's 'bout
Get it in than I kick ya ass out
White bitch, white bitch
White bitch, white bitch
Booty like a black bitch
Black bitch, black bitch, black bitch!

[2nd Verse: Krizz Kaliko]
Now I ain't trippin' off your color
I just like your back end
Looking for an undercover
I can put my Mac in
Even though she pale
Booty big as hell
No rejection, complexions
I just want to tell me
The new baby mama
Steady tryna bona
Gotta have a ass like Michelle Obama
Shake it like you really tryna get paid for it
Body's made for it
See a G spot and aim for it
It's an epidemic
I got jungle fever all over again
I'm all over her and then I'm over they bend
White girls is the new black girls
'Scuse me sister can you touch that girl?
Cause I like em
White, brown, yellow, Puerto Rican
I'm freakin out!
Make her say (Oh my god!)
Can a bitch don't speak enough
She gon' get in trouble
Her momma might think she crazy
Cause I'm tryna get her a African baby

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I get-get crunk like i come from down South
White girls wanna kiss me in my mouth
Keep playin' I'mma show you what it's 'bout
Get it in than I kick ya ass out
White bitch, white bitch
White bitch, white bitch
Booty like a black bitch
Black bitch, black bitch, black bitch!

[3rd Verse: Irv Da Phenom]
Kaitlyn, Carly, Emily
Molly, Ashley, Claire
All get twisted off of Jager
And they ready to take it there
Now it's funny to me
I used to pass and they would grab they purses
But now I done picked up a microphone
And they know all my verses
Plus her daddy would never approve of this
Which makes it even worse
That she be falling in love with moulies
And she coming up out that skirt to get it on
She just wanna know
If it's as big as they say it is up in the show
We believing so
Henny you can go
Or tell your friends about your adventure
You walk a little different
They like Oh, OH!
They might have to try that
If you got some luggage
Above the place where your thighs at
Becca, Sara, Ashley, Vanessa Katie and Lindsay
Ain't got no black in you?
Well I'm fixin' to give you plenty

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I get crunk like i come from down South
White girls wanna kiss me in my mouth
Keep playin' I'mma show you what it's 'bout
Get it in than I kick ya ass out
White bitch, white bitch
White bitch, white bitch
Booty like a black bitch
Black bitch, black bitch, black bitch!
