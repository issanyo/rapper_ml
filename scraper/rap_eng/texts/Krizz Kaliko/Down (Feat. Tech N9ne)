I just wanna party, I don't wanna go down, down, down

[Krizz Kaliko] Verse 1

Too much of anything'll kill ya
We do what we want to do when home gets too familiar
Drink like a russian and eat like a glutton
Bang a different slut but hell, it don't mean nothin'
Put the music on, dance. Who you answer to? Damnit you
If you believe in stopping lest you plan to be flammable
You find a tramp stamp and plant one off in her mandibles
And open up a can of nana and hope she's a cannibal
I feel no consequence with you
Be no competition with, niggas who's wishin
It sucks to be your position! OK?
And I'm hopin that it ain't so
Cause if it's fiery pits below, I ain't tryin'a go!

[Chorus] [Krizz Kaliko]
See I don't mean live my life this way
Like my granny used to say
It's just the devil, baby!

And I don't mean to do the things I do
What done gotten into you?
It's just the devil, baby!

I smoke, I drink, I do too much
I act like I don't give a (HEY!)
Stop me from my wicked ways
And turn my life around
I just wanna party, I don't wanna go down, down, down!

See I don't mean live my life this way
Like my granny used to say
It's just the devil, baby!

And I don't mean to do the things I do

It's just the devil, baby!

I smoke, I drink, I do too much
I act like I don't give a (HEY!)
Stop me from my wicked ways
And turn my life around
I just wanna party, I don't wanna go down, down, down!

[Tech N9ne] Verse 3

I got lots of mischief in my pocket
Flocks of bitches quick to jock it
Optimistic with the thought they hopping this

The wicked crosses often
Lifted it's the saucy
Lost in this shit
Just get off it
In the hottest pits he walk it

Ay Miss Molly!
I can feel it in my body
I've been giving the women
The venom within 'em
A nigga just wanna parlay

Guess my life is awkward
Try fucking like clock work
Hand right up a fox skirt
Always on a twat search

But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna
They say if I keep living this way, then I'm a gonner

But if they take, my soul, then I go below
I take the devils bitches, then I stick it in her hole

[Chorus] [Krizz Kaliko]
See I don't mean live my life this way
Like my granny used to say
It's just the devil, baby!

And I don't mean to do the things I do
What done gotten into you?
It's just the devil, baby!

I smoke, I drink, I do too much
I act like I don't give a (HEY!)
Stop me from my wicked ways
And turn my life around
I just wanna party, I don't wanna go down, down, down!
