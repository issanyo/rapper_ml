[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Cause ain't nothing but heartache
Still not amazed, at what you see before you
I can't go, I can't stay
Ooh, do tie, if we walk away
Don't you, don't you want somebody to love you?
Won't you, won't you need somebody to love?

[Hook:]
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
See, I don't love you (Yes I do)
You don't love me (You do too)
We can't hardly get along, with the clothes on
Everything I say is wrong, listen
Hot in the kitchen; I can't take it
All dem lil' folks thought we'd make it
Ain't nothing left for me to do
Cut loose from me to you

[Hook:]
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Aye!
I think we should stop
Because I'm callin you
From the studio
Asking You wanna see me
Or not?
Being my beezy
Ain't easy
She won't see me a lot
So when you creeping, deceiving
Please believe me
I'm hot
Why do I have to feel
Like I'm begging you
To be with me putting me through this hell
When I'm showing you what Heaven do?
After all of these years I never knew
You would back off and slack off
When I had to move and stop your monthly revenue
Only wanted to love you but money seemed to be bigger
That's worse than us having sex
And you white and calling me nigga
It's over baby hope you get this message that I deliver
It never was about loving
It was what I could give her
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
I didn't hear from you
In a year
And found out you had somebody else's baby
No more me and you girl I had to go
Hit the do'
Now the only time you see me is at my show

[Hook:]
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you
