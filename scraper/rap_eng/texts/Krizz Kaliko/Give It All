[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yep, I'm the one ya heard
Reppin rojo on Jimmy Kimmel had some disturbed
But niggas know that we ruff and rugged so mum's the word
Tech Ninna face painted look like he come ta purge!
Real Scorpio, shoot this thing like a torpedo
Rock the rip, no remorse we go
Dummy like Mork from Ork, we know
And I say that with the utmost respect
I bust flow to death, I must blow the check
It's never enough dough for Tech
So I get sick with it, I make a bitch dig it
Even when I wanna speed it up and I quick-spit it
I get a bit wicked up in a battle
Try to bite I buck a blammer in his fitted
Killin' music get me stiff sitted, I can't piss when it become hard
So I need a chick to hit it when I kick a lyric
And I'mma murder 'til I'm on the yard (Murder)
My verse are like burst that jerk up and merk the weak twerp
You cannot hurt the Gurkha
First ta', insert the work, the son of the earth
I disperse the curse to reverse ya to the worst of ya
Then I'mma squirt ya MRSA (Ugh)
Trip not, you see I got the advantage in hip hop
Cause rappers sound identical so when Ninna's shit drop
I do numbers, I'm the pinnacle so never will this stop
Y'all can't beat me doin' nothing, except for
Stalkin' these thoughts I spew and suckin'
We run this independent game, it ain't no screwin' us
When we runnin' everything except our mouth while they blue and sufferin'
This on the Bible, I kill any life with a script from this rhyme
Music's done - divine
This is my rifle, there aren't any like it cause this one is N9ne
This a gift from his mind

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

[Verse 2: Price]
Yo, I Got the call from Tech N9ne
He needed assistance from the group with the best rhymes
That spit that get up off of yo ass and grind
Fuck all of them flex lines
I get love in every city I sack in cause I rep mine
Around the world, the girls give me head on tour cause I headline
I gotta get fed, I'm fed up, my homies is doin' fed time
I look at that clock and all I see is "Go get that bread" time
Lost too many soldiers so tears, I gotta shed mine
Turn on the radio, hear yo shit, and oh, it's bedtime
I fall asleep, it all is weak, most y'all shouldn't be called MCs
Burnt ya discography, you ain't sale cause all of ya talk is cheap
Smoke up all the tree, my whip look like it got a fog machine
My crib look like a pharmacy, that's prolly why you wanna halt my team

[Verse 3: Oktane]
Livin' facetious, bobbin' head while the weed lit
I make change where I see fit
I don't play like I don't see shit
Yeah, one hunnit, one hunnit, keep it that way and it's potent
And stay away from the hate and keep all yo plays right in motion
Bust it, I'm down after the sun and up before it, better know it
MVP, most valuable poet, been the coldest, kept it focused
Cause you miss every goal that you don't shoot for
And every time you cut a corner, you make two more
Put richness in my life so I don't have to half at things
And listen for the whispers so I don't have to hear the screams
And I go hard for what I want, so it's just colors when I dream
And then you realize, it's not as scary as it seems
Normal is for pussies

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody handle me, heated like a candle be
Kissin' dirt, ya man'll be for tryin' to dismantle me
Music is my weapon, true, loud enough to deafen you
Never trip with Tech and crew, be careful who you steppin' to
I remember when I was young and I got scars through
Right in back of the paddy-wagons and cop cars too
Now that I'm flyin' high from a rockstar view
Security level let Allahu Akbar through

Hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!
Hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!
Hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!
Hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!
I wanna try
