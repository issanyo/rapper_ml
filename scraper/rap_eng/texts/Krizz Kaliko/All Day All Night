(Cookin' Soul)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
This ain't nothing like a nine to five
A superstar now, it's your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!

All day, all night (4X)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I wrote my life down from '85 to right now
And my style had a heap of people just like "Wow"
Schizophrenic, grim and venomous lyrics with a slight growl
I was destined to be Tech, to rip and excite crowds
So my pals think after I rip the mic down
It's lights out and right to the pillow of my right eye brow
But when I chow I stay up and write sounds
I like loud, I stay wake and create late like a night owl
Meeting deadlines, serious as fed time
They said I'm extremely different and I head mine
I wedï»¿ rhymes, married to this game and my bread's fine
That's why I'm always rocking classic J's, the red kind
With that said I'm always up in y'all sights
Some think it's all wrong, being spotted it's all right
Thinking that I'm the no type is all hype
I ain't got a problem with being Tech all day and all night
For real

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I write my flows and record them, I do my shows and we floor them
And so they go, let's reward them with merch and ticket sales
That's why my clothes I afford them, this love I know never short 'em
So why would I go and abort them and curse and give it hell?
They spot me at the movie, sippin', tryna press a newbie
Getting through these a hectic next to me singing my message to me
But I never get vexed the scroogie when I'm at the Ruby Tuesday
That's a doozie, follow me for autographs when I'm set to dookie
That's TMI, whether on the street or fly
With the need desire to be seated high and this heat is why
Even sometimes I be down and dark they all bright
Lifting me up, being Tech Ninna all day and all night
Yeah

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Ey, they even find me up in Wal-Mart
And give me coochie coupons, sexy mamas be all heart
Even at the Mandalay Bay I'm off in the mall parked
Chicks looking for me, patrolling the area like Paul Blart
And it be the same when I'm with the chiefs to gain
People greet me, heat arraign, sleep, they need to meet the Strange
Cat cause he became the creature sent to eat the game
Speaking of eat the pizza came in the beast in frame of the pizza mayne
At the funeral, taking pictures, near urinals
Not only when I'm on tour, you know where I'm stepping, they're sure to show
And it's a blessing, even if I'm stressing I'm durable
And you're to know, to do this like Tech you have to endure to grow
Yo
