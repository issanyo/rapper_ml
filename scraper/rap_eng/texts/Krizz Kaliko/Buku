[Intro]
So it's like, I think in God's eyes it's described as like, gluttony or greed. Just too much man -- you can't have too much, you know? They're gonna try to rob you for it, women try to take it from you some way. You know what I'm saying, because it's described as buku, you know?

[Verse 1]
I got too many women close to me
And they lay a little closer than they supposed to be
[?] are we
They hoes to me
Have every one of them committing adultery, approaching me
Pulled the back up out of it again
Rode the pony, saddling again, woe is me
Feeling like it's happening again
I'm looking how she acting when she sin
She got too many men for me
Not really trying to be one
Right [?] how they left some
Left one and I, gets the Henn-a
Blessed the nigga repressed by breath blessed [?]
An ass like that
No wonder I'm tryna give up my cash like that
I must of found another job
She get me feeling [coochie ma?] but it ain't worth dying for, so what the fuck am I crying for
Got 4 more just like her, more tighter, won't fight her so I must like her
Invite her, to get higher, Wahweh
Pop her in the midst and watch her vibrate

[Hook]
Buku
I got too much dough, dough, and I got too many hoes
Buku
Buku
I got too much change, change, and I got too many thangs
Buku

[Verse 2]
Now I'm all about a
Few shots, and popping the pills
1-151 and a couple of girls
And they look a little better than before I think
Let another drink sink then I'm up in the pink
They get naked
I got a couple niggas with me so why don't you bring a couple of yo hoes over
Get wasted
I got a little fifth with me and we ain't finna be going home sober
This rap shit brings
Women in my face, that's women in my place, I got to gripping they want it
It makes em holler with me, and swallow another bottle with me and follow me to [?]
Yeah, I'm more the dose and [?] and too much potion, I'm hoping
This life I chose to lead don't slowly slow my heart beat

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's about to be, over
This nigga's trying to make me give it, over
And now they got me looking over my, shoulder
[?], toed up
And I got way more money then I used to possess
And this music boost in progress
Got things that I'm wishing, popo
[?] getting mo'
Getting low when I see black people, cause they out to do me evil
Cause they see me on TV
They wanna ride and [?] me
So I return to the steeple, to relieve me
[?], can you tell me where the true love at
Trying to get a push, they just push back
Just should of pushed that crack
Things just ain't that bad
And I guess this, paternity test is, gon' serve me justice
Teach me them lessons, not to mess with
Red bones with them big ol' breastes, that I spend my checks with
On the daily
She like fuck you pay me (Damn)
Damn, is everybody shady
Every woman I touch, they got my baby
It's crazy, I like it, but it's crazy
Maybe, if you got too much this is what it'll do to you
Boo, you got that buku
