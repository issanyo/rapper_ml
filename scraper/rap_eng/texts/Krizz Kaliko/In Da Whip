[Intro]
Its me in this heat bout to turn this mother out
Dip, dip in da whip, burn rub out out
Kali Baby, Strange music, it's another one
Most definitely, Kaliko in the house for sure
Most definitely, dip off in da whip for sure

[Hook x8]
Dip, dip in da whip, burn rub out, out

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' at the light these people trippin' off
The damnest with the data seat
Bout to treat out in this bitch, filled it up with PV springs
And the girlies rushin' up, so they can find out who the tightest one ,so they roll with us, go with us
Superstar now, so ain't no holdin' us
So we dip to the spot, where we pop when it's dark out
Might get ya popped so you betta get the spark out
Me, the N9ne, and Kutty Kal will let his bark out
To let them little fishies know that the sharks out
Strange lane, we outrageous
And you have now begun to be (rockin' with the greatest)
When we fall, then all you (better grab ya ladies
Cause they definitely be jeffin' with the Kali Baby)
I got it, my Chevy squatted in the parking lot
With y'all doin' his whisperin' me and my people talk a lot
Fresher than a pair of Nike Airs, and get to bossin' it
Your breezy be easy for tossin' it, up after that then we

[Hook x8]
Dip, dip in da whip, burn rub out, out

[Verse 2]
We in the place where they playin' that Tech N9ne and 'em
Lookin' for them lot of bodies and they got a lot of em, gobble 'em
Plush button, tuck on the seats, from underneath
And them diamond cuts on them choppers to match it - nigga teeth
Check it out
Willy bars, on them hotrods, run up and get it, get it
Jackers get it, twit it, do-do-do-do you feel it
Hit the block and make em bop
When I come through, with that new new
Safety halfway off don't make me have to do you
Still sippin' on somethin' surpy
Got me sorta leanin' I'm hardly seein' 'n whippin'
In something can't afford to be in
N I'm lookin for that floosy who, do me like she usually do
Dig at her break out and she's a doosie too, are you?
I'm gone with it, I'm gon get it
Out to smoke tenants and before he had it too long and now I'm done with it
Throw it in the gutta, go and buy anotha
Dip in da whip and now I'm burnin out the rubba'

[Hook x8]
