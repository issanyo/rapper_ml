[Intro]
Denver, Colorado
Please welcome for the last time of the strictly Strange tour 2008
The number one independent rapper in the world
TECH N9NE!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
How could I be so down at a time like this, when I'm high like this?
On the billboard charts, many major tours overseas, when I fly like this?
I've been thinkin' about the people that need me
They needy in all of the pain that I might miss
Sooner or later it seeks me, reach me
Then bleed me deep in the rain inside my pit
I'm goin' down now, because my mom frowns
In a research psychiatric center without her son around
And I'm deep off in this hole, when I'm out here rockin' shows (They say)
I should be hyped 'cause my life is so rock 'n roll!
But I feel like The Grinch mixed with Ebenezer Scrooge
Let the fever ooze, up out of me, clouded me, never eager to
Let up when I'm in an interview, they prolly be thinkin' they gonna hinder dude
'Cause he be lookin' like he might offend the rule
Never intricate to remember blues
Because is always right here, with the Hennessy and light beer
Let it enter me and fight fear, yeah
I know I quit, but I started back, the homie caught a gat
And my bodyguard Nicholas just had a heart attack

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm sinkin' again, I'm drinkin' again
Drownin' in water, you're breathin' again
It's easy to sin when you're bleedin' within
Needing to grin, cheese and recede in the spend
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I feel in the morning
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I sound when you're callin'
(Lower than low, lower than low)
I'm high, but feel like I'm fallin'
I'm sorry, but I'm feelin' lower than low!

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
My smile is forced, my style is warped
Morale is corpse, now that my really good pal is torched
I'm just gone with the wind, I'm home with the gin, to the dome when I spin
I'ma zone 'cause the phone must be roamin’ again
Another tone, I'm alone now I don't want me to spend time with
I’m just mind this, might find Miss N9ne missed
I find my mind in this lime ditch, dine quick, not even a second for mindless
In the middle of a time when the music's flyin' I've depleted my kindness!
Low like the grasses, low like poor folks on Gratiot
I'm so below the casket, ragged pulse of the maggots
Why do I feel this illness?
I'm lookin' for somethin' to come and kill this a little bit
I got my head in the hills 'cause the real shit is momma is sufferin', takin' pills with the stillness
And I feel it, I can't shake it, in any case my space is the basement
I can't erase my abrasive encasement
I'm chasin' hatred, my taste not complacent
So as I go to the flo', the industry finally opened the do'
But now I'm in the motherfucker, all I feel is.. low

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm sinkin' again, I'm drinkin' again
Drownin' in water, you're breathin' again
It's easy to sin when you're bleedin' within
Needing to grin, cheese and recede in the spend
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I feel in the morning
(Lower than low, lower than low)
That's how I sound when you're callin'
(Lower than low, lower than low)
I'm high, but feel like I'm fallin'
I'm sorry, but I'm feelin' lower than low!
