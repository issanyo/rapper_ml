[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Everyone that you don't need put you on behind
Caught the girly standing in line
Every notch on your belt
Just another notch I guess
A fifi bag wearing a dress
No significant other
People discover that you is insignificant
Sorta la vida loca and you're living it
Beauty is a curse you the spell caster
Fornication is a sin, give 'em hell faster
He tryna split everyone he see
Everyone in front of me's a victim
That ol' daddy he 'sho 'nuff can pick em
Stick em send 'em to the Grey Hound
Make 'em lay down, go down
Whoa, you better slow down

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Slow down
Where are you going to?
This world's in front of you
Slow down, slow down
Slow down
This world's in front of you
So where are you going to?
Please, slow down

[Verse 2: Agginy]
Cute as a little button, the apple of your eye
This little girl that's interrupted was corrupt by lies
How can she not cry? How can she face her fears?
How can she overcome her hurt and pain that's still here?
With faith she climbs this high mountain where she belong
Her hands is bruised with cuts for climbing this mountain for so long
Her vision's not strong, her love is so weak
She tries to love again but is her love gone to sleep
Whisper sweet nothings in her ear
She loves the attention but is that what she wants to hear
Give him permission to take advantage of what is dear
More precious than silver or anything there's no compare
The consequences is more than what, she can bear
No one to blame in her shame of what she gain
Plus she didn't care
When love is not given to you how do you love
Express affection with kisses and hugs
Maybe I should slow down

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Slow down
Where are you going to?
This world's in front of you
Slow down, slow down
Slow down
Where are you going to?
This world's in front of you
Please, slow down

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
He-he almost died in nintey nina
When he popped E's
Lotta vitamin C and Aquafina, such a dark seed
You would think he was a fiend if you really ever seen him
But then he had to stop speed
Maybe now his grass would get a bit greener
But, 3 years later he ran into a rut
On top of having a major tour and creeping with a slut
His wife ordered a separation, that's weakened him to the gut
Now he's back with a vengeance
Popping, tweaking-mentally stuck
Pill after pill on the tour, he's popping X like it's medicine
This is the way homeboy can fly away like a pelican
Without the family so far from heaven dove off in hell again
So ashamed of what he became, can't even tell a friend
So he be lying, steady fucking with their mind
But on the inside he's dying, internally crying
Desiring peace with his family, but he's a beast
When you wanna be dad you'll rehab, put him on a leash
And he's hoping that his partner won't part from his art forming
Part the dark when in drops stop him from stardom
With drugs, it's the second go 'round
Blow now his heart will have no sound if he doesn't..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Slow down
This world's in front of you
So, where are you going to?
Slow down
Please, slow down
The world's in front of you
So where are you going to?
Baby, slow down

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
Now that I found (war)
I can give all the others the highs man
No longer young and dumb, I'mma wise man
Used to be too promiscuous, with more than two I was ubiquitous
See my wedding band and know where I'm standing with this
Cuz there's a lot of fruit in life's basket
If you out there like that put a cast on it, fork it in the casket
Live entertainment maybe make em wanna lay with ya stay with ya
Put an autograph off on they picture
Take it home with her sleep with it
Keep it in a spot where it can be found
This world is slowing me down

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Keep it, keep it, slow when you see the clock moving fast, faster
And hope you-hope you watching what you're doing, doing
