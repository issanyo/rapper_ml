I would have not have ordered these for you: the rap, the music, the genre in which you create. The vitiligo, the anxiety, the harshness of life, the struggles, the worlds in which you move. But (God) God ordered, and it made you beautiful to me, your family, your friends, and fans, many of whom have uttered to me: "Krizz Kaliko saved my life with his visions, truthfulness, experience, and talent". Go into all the world and make a difference Krizz Kaliko. With your soulful reality creations and genuine genius performances in the key of life
(God) God ordered. Obey. GO!
