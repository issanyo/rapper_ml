[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Hahahaha, in the world of BET
I'm looked at as too rock'n'roll
In the world of MTV
My name is too gangsta huh, hahaha
Man, Strange Music we got this baby
This year we got this one baby
Red hair, red everything
It's Tech N9ne baby like it or not

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Never been a harder rhymer in my region or globally
That's holdin' me, I'm totally hard and bossed up
Why you think that the majority of the rap musical authority
Sword me and barred and crossed up
'Cause they don't wanna let the crazy kid in
Then spit his hymns, begin a grim religion
Of rhyme, forbidden my isms are hidden
My mind to written then spittin' the kid in
The N9ne is playin' you, slayin' you, sprayin' you
Permanently delayin' you, swayin' through, it's the gay in you
That's hatin' who, something's that hella beyond us
(I love Kanye, his shit is bombay, but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my retina, that I won't be lettin' ya
Threatening us better respect Tech the messenger
Too dope on ‘em for this to be history, listen it’s a mystery
Why they spittin’ and dissin’ me

[Hook: Tech N9ne and (Krizz Kaliko)]
This is me (This is me)
I'm a king, I'm a clown, I'm a G (I'm a G)
I believe what I want, got you singin' my song
But you're seein' me wrong, so what's the matter with me?
This is the belief (The belief)
The religion has arisen from the deep (From the deep)
Darkest prison if you listen you will see (You will see)
If collision's your decision you will reap
What you sow, so forget what you know this is me

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
This is Tech bruh, for years I've been the next to
Collect a plethora of checks let's get extra
Is what I set ta Travis let's go select the
Baddest rappers infect the planet leave 'em in ecsta-
Sy, I'm a vet the powers don't really wanna let the best
Come and wreck your sets and test your sector
Instead of rawness like Inspecta Deck, the
Eldest rather set they specs on Mason Betha
Slept on my records If you knew my music's Hannibal Lector
What the hell you callin' for Funkmaster Flex for?
Don't pester me I won't sweat you be on a quest to
Investigate your techma respect the
Chakra tease in hop to these
Hot degrees me and Mr. O Apostrophe
Never listen to these pop pussies 'cause they suck!
(I love 50 Cent, he gritty when he vent, but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my demeanor
The Tecca Nina will blast arenas, the grass is greener
Made it ma, top of the world
Kiss me, miss me (This is, this is me)
Can't you see?

[Hook: Tech N9ne and (Krizz Kaliko)]
This is me (This is me)
I'm a king, I'm a clown, I'm a G (I'm a G)
I believe what I want, got you singin' my song
But you're seein' me wrong, so what's the matter with me?
This is the belief (The belief)
The religion has arisen from the deep (From the deep)
Darkest prison if you listen you will see (You will see)
If collision's your decision you will reap
What you sow, so forget what you know this is me

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The industry treat me like a ride on the short bus
That's why I'm tellin' they youngsters when your retourt cuss
And make a fort fuss, 'cause you went out on Sam Goody
On F.Y.E. with their money and you support us
Strangers, Shadys, Psychopaths and Juggalos
Losers, Shootas, College women and gutta hoes
Rock it for precious dough, drop it, just let it flow
Cop it don't knock it you block us stop at the record store
This is Aaron Yates, this Alyia and Reign
This is for little Donnie this is for all Lacoya's pain
This is for the sickness of Maudie Sue
This is for all the love of Sara, Suzy, Ira Mae and Izeta Lou
This is for Ike and Ricky, Rufus, Rhonda, Barbara and Marla really
This is for B'zle and I know that rest of my family is with me
This is my friends, this is the end, this is a G
This is life, this is wrong, this is right, this is me

[Hook: Tech N9ne and (Krizz Kaliko)]
This is me (This is me)
I'm a king, I'm a clown, I'm a G (I'm a G)
I believe what I want, got you singin' my song
But you're seein' me wrong, so what's the matter with me?
This is the belief (The belief)
The religion has arisen from the deep (From the deep)
Darkest prison if you listen you will see (You will see)
If collision's your decision you will reap
What you sow, so forget what you know this is me
This is me (This is me)
I'm a king, I'm a clown, I'm a G (I'm a G)
I believe what I want, got you singin' my song
But you're seein' me wrong, so what's the matter with me?
This is the belief (The belief)
The religion has arisen from the deep (From the deep)
Darkest prison if you listen you will see (You will see)
If collision's your decision you will reap
What you sow, so forget what you know this is me
