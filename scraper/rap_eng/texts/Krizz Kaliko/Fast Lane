[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
They say life is a highway
Are you ready to roll?
There's no turning back that way when you step out on that road
Life in the fast lane
Fast Lane (x4)

[Verse 1: Steven Cooper]
I put my pedal to the medal and I roll out
I'm moving faster now that everybody finally got a hold now
It's ten years after but we're still on the road to sold out
I smell disaster, when I get it Ima get it, I'm blow out
Leave nothing after

I got place to be, I got people to see
I got a whole lot of people waiting on me
I got a brand new sound they waiting to hear
2014 now yeah that's my year
Built this thing on love baby
I got that buzz baby
Now we moving so quick, we master those hits, try to stay away from haters didn't ask for no lip
Haven't slowed down since I left that town
Got a brand new record now
Gonna set these records now
Ya'll the same we that other sound
And there ain't no other now
Once you get that show me sound
It's Kansas City, ya'll with me, ya'll better show me how

Haven't slowed down since I left that town
Got a brand new record now, gonna set these records now
Y'all gonna save me that other sound
Ain't way no other now when you get that show me sound
It's Kansas City, yo with me y'all better show me how

Give me the track and I'll lead off
It's about time to speed off
Turn the cheek and brush sleeves off
Gotta keep it moving, gotta kill it while I do, gotta get it while it's hot, gotta get it while it's moving, put your hands up with a lighter full of fluid
Hotter than the others but I'm hidden in the gutter, gotta make me feel the rhythm 'til there ain't no other

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
They say life is a highway
Are you ready to roll?
There's no turning back that way when you step out on that road
Life in the fast lane (x7)
Fast Lane (x4)

What you know about that Phantom

[Verse 2: ThePhantom*]

I can do it a mile a minute when I get all up in it
Everybody be like phantom bet he wilding when he
Hit 'em wit the danger they be thinkin' I was
Born in a manger then I came up
Holy trinity of rap I bust lyrical mac I tuck
And bust cats with the raps that immaculate
Used roll in a 87 Acura, now I'm stackin' bucks cats
Packin up they like
Whoa, in the fast lane from the KCMO
Watch me as I put the pedal to the floor
Hop in buckle up cause I'm finna go
You don't wanna go toe to toe
You get a broken nose and get an
Overdose of dope with my quotes
I can be cocky when my top speed is at mach 3
Everyone knowin' there ain't no stoppin me
Even veterans comparing me to Socrates
Still I be kickin' hard as soccer teams
If I were you I'd take stock in me
You got an IOU than don't talk to me
I'm in the Fontainebleau I'm on the balcony
I'm finna count two you finna vouch for me
What I'm bout to do is finna clown your team
You couldn't be this fly with an ounce of weed
I be, inundated, with all these haters they
Say I won't make it but I'm finna say them
Say your prayers, I will demolish your
Doubts cause I'm volatile I will not honor you
When I blow up when my dough up don't show up
Imma close up got my nose up
Fast lane I can't slow up, finna go 'til my engine blow up

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
They say life is a highway
Are you ready to roll
There's no turning back that way when you step out on that road
Life in the fast lane (x7)
Fast Lane (x4)

[Intro: Steven Cooper]
Kansas City, Numba 91, Come on, Tamba

[Verse 3: Tamba Hali]

On the road to money
Got to get that cash up
Don’t harass us
You know we run it
From east to the west side of the atlas
My team keeps winning
On the track them boys really think they could pass us like like wait
How they gone do that in an Acura
Relumae Records ask for us
A nigga still flowing like an aqueduct
That’s why they so mad at us
But I ain’t got time for the acting up
Headed for the mula
That’s what’s up
Hoorah nigga marching up
Calmly
Cannot harm me
I’m a army like
This ain’t the last of us
Gone

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
They say life is a highway
Are you ready to roll
There's no turning back that way when you step out on that road
Life in the fast lane (x7)
Fast Lane (x4)
