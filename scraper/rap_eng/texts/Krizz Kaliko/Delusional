[Verse 1]
Yeah... Like this (Like this)
I'mma drink this Henn, I'mma keep this grin
But if you look at N9na closely
I'm trying to contain this beast within
I know some of y'all already knowing
That I got a lot of cheese to spend
But that don't change the fact I go insane
I've got a heap of sins, please begin

I saw the glitz in all of this when I was just yay tall
And I pictured y'all and it wall to wall but they all said I was just
Delusional
But the people startin calling us and I'm balling tough
But the crawling rough and I never thought of stuff with saw enough
What the problem is now I got 'em here
Telling all these kids I'm the K.O.D
And they pumping up the volume and listening hard
When I give my heart, is it
Delusional?
When I'm thinking I'mma boss in the biz
But I'm lost and I fake it that I'm off in the lid
But they pay the cost when it is dark at the crib
Some say that if I tell them to hate
My people are at the gate ready for sealing your fate
That is up for debate because when I make
My music ain't no evil from Mr. Yates
Calling me a cult leader
I don't really know but I'mma fosho heater
Wickedness coming from Monrovia
They could blow me but the folks wanna soul see us
At the bottom with the devil look around and it be no N9na
They say I lead 'em to evil
Like I was Jimmy Jones and feedin the people
When I bleed in the steeple
The reason they seizing me ain't no decreasing my ego
My power's for good, I think
Would I shrink if somebody took away how good I ink?
But that would never happen I'm makin it with the rapping
But they want me to collapse and when I could I sink

[Hook]
I hope I find what I'm looking for
Maybe I should drink just a little more
Delusional
I'm fightin but I'm losing
Feel like the author of confusion
Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life
And confusion seems to be my alibi
Delusional
I'm feelin like I don't belong
Feel like I'm telling you to do wrong
Hear me!

[Verse 2]
She feel like I'm
Gonna make them hate
Because I was around and kick it and make them babies
And now that I made it gotta escape them daily
And that's crazy
Because all I'm doing is making the industry pay me
But when I show my face feeling everything's great
Did a show then we ate then I'm outta that state
She said I'm a good provider
But daddy of the year? Man, I'm out of that race
How I compensate for the losses they get often dates
That's too personal, Will stop the tape

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say I'm seeing things
But everybody know I'm being things, we them kings
Like it or not we running this
Got a lot of hype because I wanna spit
And I come to grip on the fifth
You gotta know Tech's never gonna miss
I know I might be a little psychy
But it's nightly and brightly inside of me making me a little frightening
Ripping it with the right team
I bring hella light when reciting
When it's all said and done I'm sickened and heavened
Caused this a damned reverend
ALL 6's AND 7's
