[Intro: Tech N9ne]
We been doing this for a long long time now...
This music thing... and touring, y'know...
And still... I ain't met one person that could maintain righteousness
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
A wise man told me evil was lurkin' and if you found it
Try your best to not put yourself around it
'Cause when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but
Then it’s the sin you begin it, then wish that you stayed grounded
I went all over the world and I done been through it
At the beginning I knew I wouldn't give in to it
But temptation, oh what the sensation
Women I am embracin', so many of them waitin'
Contemplatin' how to get fornication
At yo door when it's late with the motivation of Satan
So they say, but things go they way
And it's more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today
But lust it sets in, and crush your chest in
For dust you're destined, if drugs are let in
Enough to nest in, prolly make you punch your best friend
And next kin 'cause you let S-E-X win
You mean to tell me you can fight this land
With brightness and walk the path of the righteous man?
Yo, I wanna believe that, itching to see that
If a positive person can shake the negative feedback
That this life has to offer when it's faster
What a disaster if you didn't obey the master
'Cause that's mutiny, it would be new to me
If you was on tour with Tecca N9na and still you could be

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Strange Lane Choir)]
(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you
(Know me, know me) I know you'll be strong, but you've been gone a
(While) I know you still my
(Child) So I'm pullin' for you
(Don’t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you
(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the
(Clouds) You're holier than
(Thou) So I say it for you

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
How can I move the crowd without losin' out on my faith?
Lucifer out of the way (way)
Or maybe he don't even exist
I ain't gotta trip off gettin' hookers out of my system (get you out of my system)
See that's how he tricks 'em
Get 'em sippin' then a big ol' mickey he slips them (I wonder why)
Music soothes the savage soul
People can lose it when we lack control
Really get used to livin' fast and so
We smashin' women then they bypass they soul
They believin' everything we breathin'
Half of us is Jesus, the other half is heathen
And how we get that bad half out?
We pray the Lord'll cast that out
Hope he got blessings left and pass that out
When we travellin' and pass that route
Keep us under your graces in places where we have that doubt
Where I stand, it's pointin' at me, but it's with my hand
I need you, you holier than I am, I am

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Strange Lane Choir)]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
This verse was intended for a gospel rapper
That we all admire and he goes by the name of Da' T.R.U.T.H
All we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction
And maybe if he came we could change and regroup
So we laid it down and sent it hopin' he would rap wit' us, track splittas
Waited, and none of his people got back wit' us
We kept callin' and they finally answered, when a month passed
We was prepared to do whatever, give it if he wants cash
But the lady who represent him would never send him a message from a secular messenger
Never be no nepotism, we s'posed to be brothers, on the road to teach others
But the flow would be covered, better mess with the Tech they know that we smother
Anybody that diss us, retired of they weak flow
'Cause this is the pinnacle, nobody flyer than me, bro
If you didn't like it then I admire the ego
And if they never told you, then you better fire ya people
'Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed 'em
But Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims
But they always helpin' in the hood, but y'all closed me out
Y'all didn't even really wanna know what we 'bout
And we bombay, T.R.U.T.H ain’t on this, so the Don' spray
And I had to spit on it 'cause I couldn't afford Kanye
I needed help, your people showed me the wall
Below me is y'all, I guess y'all wasn't holy at all... naw!

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
Much love to the gospel MC J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation
Even though most if his peers told him not to 'cause we secular MCs
Thanks for giving me Da' T.R.U.T.H. CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro. God bless you, for being so
