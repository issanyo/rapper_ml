[Intro - Tech N9ne]
Haha! You know with my name on it, it's gon' sizzle right? Hahaha! Strange Music represent, all day, all night, TECH N9NE! Big Krizz Kaliko man
He's bout to hit you with it
Hey yo, we but to bust up in the industry like, JAM, I NEED MY MONEY!

[Verse 1 - Krizz Kaliko]
Relax for a minute and let just me begin to tell you
'Bout how I feel about women wearing Chanel when I smell you
It's incredible
And I've been waiting for you like a long time
Feel like a lifetime
Tonight feel like the right time
Order a vodka tonic top it off with lime twists
We feel great, and maybe we might just
Slip up out the back of here, or sneak up out the front door
Unzip a pack of magnums baby, don't know what she in for
Let's do it to it
I'm injecting mama with do it fluid
It hurts at first, but you get used to it
When we do that backseat thing
I'm the backseat king
I'm the rich girl's promise and that poor girl's dream
Well there she go
Telling me no
And I'm a back up out of it then do everything I know from Miss Got-a-lot-of-it so
She don't want anymo'
I can't handle it so
I got right out the door
Didn't want to let it go

[Hook - Krizz Kaliko]
I'm looking for that someone
Who's just gon' let it go
Just let it go, (I let it go)
Just let it go, (I let it go)
And if you are that someone
Come on girl let it show
Just let it go
Just let it go
(I l-l-let it go)

[Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko]
I need you to dance, I need you to strip
I need you to move them little ass and hips
Baby I got a pocket full of twenties, a pocket full of ones
A pocket full of money, you better get you some
So what's the haps on some extra curricular
I don't holler at any batch I want you in particular
So let me know to tip out, lets slip out to Krizz' house
How much I gotta whip out, to get you out the strip house
Cause
I really love the way you do that there, you right there
She bend down whispers something in my ear, it's cold back here
I'm still pulling out the latex
And trying to see you watch you play text, to get you naked what I gotta say next?
I wanna be on you
Yep, yep
I wanna be on you
We're alone now
What are we gon' do?

[Hook - Krizz Kaliko]
I'm looking for that someone
Who's just gon' let it go
Just let it go, (I let it go)
Just let it go, (I let it go)
And if you are that someone
Come on girl let it show
Just let it go
Just let it go
(I l-l-let it go)

[Verse 3 - Krizz Kaliko]
It's five in the morning, the clubs closed down
We through with the waffle house, we at my house now
Outta your blouse
Arousing my trouser mouse
So we mouth to mouth, guess what I've been talking bout
And yo this one was on her
I'm hoping I can get a chance to put it on her
Now she's officially kissing me where the sun don't shine
And if you digging me then give it to me one more time
And let it go baby

[Hook - Krizz Kaliko]
I'm looking for that someone
Who's just gon' let it go
Just let it go, (I let it go)
Just let it go, (I let it go)
And if you are that someone
Come on girl let it show
Just let it go
Just let it go
(I l-l-let it go)
