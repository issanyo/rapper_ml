[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I've landed, but which way now to go?
'Cause it's Strangeland everything goes up vertical above the clouds I flow
How I got here I don't really know or remember like The Alamo
So to give me direction on this journey is Big Krizz Kaliko

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Now here is a beautiful world for you to enter
You can hear how we kill everyone, we're Helter Skelter
On this fear that is fearing us spear chuckers that love to bust
Shear stroke of genius since we appeared out the penis
We just the lost boys like we sons of Donald Sutherland
We done struggling we forced our way in and forced to weigh in
The big swinging cocks of rap, R&B and rock
We been seeing lots of cats copying ya not
Them G-O-D's and we can bless ya like we was a pastor
We past ya long ago ya concentrate on rapping faster
This is the temple of making it look simple to y'all
I wasn't really into rap or in the rap 'cause I seen too many flaws
Why they fall for Strangeland go up filled with streams of Caribou Lou
Fill ya cup and toast how they blow up
My team captain is you Nina I'm the first lieutenant
Enjoy your visit this is Strangeland that you invented

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Welcome!

We'd like to welcome you
If you're new then you're overdue
Take a quick peeking overview

We'd like to welcome you

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Wow, Juggalos, Kottonmouth Kings and Queens
Gangbangers, metalheads and the college kids
Then everything in between
They love when Tech spitting, know he's the best ripping
Blessed this when all of these titles can equal technician
So let's get it into some retro Tech's vision
Complex written scripts are always sex driven
Behold us we've had it so rough so what's the slogan we have at Strangeland?
It goes up!
When I ask you what goes up mane if it's all good then you say that it goes
Mane if it's no, you simply just say that it don't, then I'mma label you foe
That's when they hit the flow if you hating in my land we can throw
But I prefer with drinking 'Bou Lou that's cold
Then hit the vertical path and get on these hoes
I love it Eep Op Ork Ah Ah
Even if you're brand new come meat shock your faja
And I'm looking for the girls with them deep bra's more tatas
On the vertical then get horizontal then I'mma beat up your nana

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
