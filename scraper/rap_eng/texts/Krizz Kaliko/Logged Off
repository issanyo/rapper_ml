[Intro]
(Woman speaking)
Check this out right here now

[Verse 1]
Oh please, oh please, oh please
Just give me just one more second
I can't stay connected, Instant got too hectic
Look how it's really affecting me
Cause I've been in there for the long haul
It's like Tall-Tall order and I'm sorta ported and logged off
Recorded it Stranger can pre-order it
A way to avoid it we know it
So we Michael Jordan in it for y'all
Nina give me the ball
Now you see me speaking out freaking out call me Nepal
Cuz I've been having trouble transitioning
From daddy to Kali Baby
Bring this medal and I'm wishing it was different
That's how it made me
If I stutter in a sentence, they might censor, try not to pay me
I'm complaining relentless about dollars and since it's crazy like
I'm Jones-ing in my boots ain't bout to fall off
This shit pays, ain't no sick days to call off
Listen though, if I'm missing dough, strangers got me hugging, kissing
So I'm eclipsing my iPhone, logged off

[Hook]
If Earth had a heaven you would find me there
(Logged off)
And I can become invisible anyway
(Logged off)
Cause I forgot where home is (Hey)
Maybe I guess in showbiz (Hey)
If I were you and you were me, you too would be
(Logged off)

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
See this is what it's like to be me
Hey, but when I'm gone, I'm gone, believe me

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I be on some more paranoid
Avoiding the every noise
I'll freak and I'll front, I'll poise
My voice I'll moisten
Make 'em avoid they boyfriend
They'll die for us, I'm they choice of poison
So I cannon ball into it, get involved
I flew it, that is all, my thinking cap is on, ain't gotta call it off
Jesus take the wheel, I feel an incentive to kill
I'm living in Atlanta, lala, and think it's real
Cause I be logged off ready to fall of the grid
If you callin' the kid, I'll be ready 'till I'm on top of social media
Hitting the nigga, please button is getting easier
Can't discover why I'm on the cover at
If you thinking deep, I'm even under that
Even if you text and tweeting, I can't find a reason
Why we ain't speaking
Avoiding you like we two beefers beefing
If you sent a search party, call it off
We out on tour, I'm hard to reach
I Control-Alt-Delete and log it off

[Hook]
If Earth had a heaven you would find me there
(Logged off)
And I can become invisible anyway
(Logged off)
Cause I forgot where home is (Hey)
Maybe I guess in showbiz (Hey)
If I were you and you were me, you too would be
(Logged off)

Can you be my friend from a distance?
Can you solve that problem with no assistance?
Can you live without me?
I'm not around if you talk about me
Can you make me older?
I'll get back home when it gets colder
Now isn't that more fun
Cause I'm logged off and on the run?
