[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Lurking in every corner of your mind
Haunting your feeble existence with the rhyme
Your every breath consumed back in
For battle with this MC you’ll never win
Anghellic, Everready, Absolute Power, MLK
Scream 'til nay sayers run away
You’ll be infected soon even if you've never heard of
This deadly MC, prepare for murder

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ain’t nobody stupid enough to get at me
Full of a lot of lemon, Sprite and Hennessy
Better be on my team and not my enemy
Givin’ the suckers murder with my energy
See by the way I’m walkin’ I’m a killer
Can see by the way she talkin’ I’ma steal her
Get it poppin’ you watch it take a Godzilla
And the Glock’ll pop if you mix up my skrilla
Listen to me when I say that I’ma get it
I know you really lovin’ the way a nigga spit it
It don’t matter the weather, N9na gotta grit it
And I never will give a damn about a critic
I don't think you ever seen nobody rougher
One way or the other the music gotta touch ya
But if I gotta break it down for the suckers
All killer no filler, motherfucker

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me

[Krizz Kaliko]
With an arsenal of tongue twisting rhymes
N9ne’s music makes for good times

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Haters you better be careful when you speak to me
I don’t think you really wanna be off in the beef with me
Stupid thinkin’ you wanna come and get a piece of me
Flow anorexic and my flow is obesity
Better kneel down the moment that I enter
I’m a veteran and you nothin’ but a beginner
Not a devil but you can bet that I’m a sinner
I gotta eat the pretty women up for dinner
I can be a little psychotic on the wickedness
It’s a homicidal recital when I’m rippin’ it
And you know we get hella vital when I’m kickin’ it
It’s a fantasy for many but I be livin’ it
Do whatever I gotta do to get the mill
I get down and dirty and dummy with the skill
If you wanna come and get it but know the victory
Is not in your favor ‘cause I got the power to kill

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Ask anybody they will say I’m runnin’ this
I know I got your lady wantin’ some of this
My encephalon ain’t no tellin’ what will come of it
Night is trouble, I bring ‘em hell even if the sun is lit
Got the prophecy it’s takin’ over the nation
Ain’t no stoppin’ me I got the certification
Choppin’ broccoli count the money that I’m makin’
Stop the mockery it be funny ‘cause you fakin’
All of my killer homies wanna hit
Put the elbow macaroni on a bitch
Killer killer for real guerrilla with that fist
Let it loose I’ma leave you losin’ with a stitch
If you thinkin’ you got it better I’ma cut you
Killin’ you off and I love it when you suffer
But if I gotta break it down for the suckers
All killer no filler, motherfucker

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me
The killer in me, there's a killer in me

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
So there and beware of what you say
For misspoken words you will surely have to pay
A vial of musical poison will fill ya
You can’t resist the swarming of the killer
