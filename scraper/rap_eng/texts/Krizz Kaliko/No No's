[Intro: Stevie Stone]
Let me dance and I'll be okay
Let me drink and I'll be okay
Let me smoke and I'll be okay
Cause if you don't
I'm about to lose it

[Hook]
Hey!
Spend your life talkin' 'bout No No's
Okay! What you say?
I need it (No)
I need it (No)
I need it (No)
I need (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Hey!
Everybody's talkin' 'bout No No's (Ah-Huh!)
What you say?
I need it (No)

I need it (No)
I need (No, no, no, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
Hey!
Drinkin' 'till I throw up (Hey!)
Tonight I'm gonna poh' up
Cause the world is gonna blow up
And there's nowhere to hide, so I'mma ride it out
Hey!
Try'na find them thots
I want what she gots
Maybe, better not
Cause if she's a killer I'mma be findin' out

[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
Let me dance and I'll be okay
Let me drink and I'll be okay
Let me smoke and I'll be okay
Cause if you don't
I'm about to lose it

[Verse 2]
Hey!
Inhale 'till I'm sky high
People gotta die, why?
So I log on to the wi-fi
And people are crazy, people are crazy
I know, now we're all-stars
Lovin' money, women, cars
But none of this is ours
So we live it up, liquored up, before we leave it

[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
Let me dance and I'll be okay
Let me drink and I'll be okay
Let me smoke and I'll be okay
Cause if you don't
I'm about to lose it

[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
Let me dance and I'll be okay
Let me drink and I'll be okay
Let me smoke and I'll be okay
Cause if you don't
I'm about to lose it
