[Verse 1 - One Ton]
One Ton official Humboldt county heavyweight
The undisputed roll a champ from the golden state
There's no debating I've been smoking joints and celebrating
Your coughing on your first hit bitch your hella fake
I'm a drug dealer never snitch and ?????
Your studio y'all limit ??? talking cheap
I know the weed game and play it like monopoly
A stoner building green houses on my property
And everywhere I roll I got the smell of Kush aroma
The cops search the two of us they sure to find a stoner
Potluck, Dank Alumni, certified diploma
Poses with the hash joint, choke into a coma
You ain't a stoner cuz you got a weed tattoo
I'm the man I'll roll a blunt thick as bamboo
I'm smoking green miles bitch so I lapped you
Left you all stoned stuck like a statue

[Hook - Krizz Kaliko]
You're a lightweight
You don't smoke like me
Bong hits take a toke with me
Or imma call ya lightweight
Bake when the sun comes up
Then we drink til we throw it up
Ill never grow up
How long how long will I keep getting high its the way I wanna die
How long how long till your rolling up cuz I can't wait no lightweight

[Verse 2 - Underrated]
I'm smoking broccoli oftly cocky talking like I'm Socrates
I'm high from the green weed eyes dropping like I'm Japanese
I got the strongest weed you've ever seen please believe
Your passing out your girlie flirts with me, I'm Hercules
Its Humboldt county dude it ain't just a hoax
My puppy loves pot candy and my whole family smokes
So if you think your big and tough and you can smoke a lot
I've got a plan put out your hand, man and roll this pot
While your rolling I'm grabbing a bong and I'm taking a big ripper
I'm taking it fly ??? in the sky I'm like the big dipper
Put the oil up in the flow we about to get stuck
Its potluck we getting so fucked up
Never quitting when we smoking
Never stopping we keep going
Its so often that we blowing
You talk but you ain't knowing (Shut up man!)
So listen up and smoke the whole bowl chump
Its the right way you lightweight punk
