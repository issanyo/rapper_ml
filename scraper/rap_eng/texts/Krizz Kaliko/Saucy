[intro]
Hey, hey, hey
This your song right here (Song right here)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It's the one you love (It's probably Krizz)

[Hook]
Saucy, saucy get to drinking with your girlfriend
Saucy, saucy way too much now I'm earling
Saucy, saucy lots of shots now it's time to go
Saucy, saucy I'm so tired, can't get off the floor

[Verse 1]
I'm off of 2 shots of Patron, and now I'm looking for a bad one
Til most of 'em leave me 'lone 'cause already had 'em
Tipsy, they used to pass me, they used to diss me
Harass me, now they ask me if they can kiss me
The best there is, I piss excellence
Try to check me for my dough, you insult my intelligence
Screaming "Kali Baby!" and them babies end up yelling it
Stacks big as a elephant ,spending it for the hell of it
We coop the day my shit come out
Get your girl in the Coupe and watch my (Hey!) come out
In the air iI'mma shoot, and all the niggas run out
And I'mma blow all my loot until that shit run out
I'm mad niggerish, me and all my niggas is blacker as licorice
Like shining Big Nicholas
With bitches we be kicking it
Christopher, keeps his wrist glistening and frosty
Damn, what it cost me? I'm way too saucy

[Hook]
Saucy, saucy get to drinking with your girlfriend
Saucy, saucy way too much now I'm earling
Saucy, saucy lots of shots now it's time to go
Saucy, saucy I'm so tired, can't get off the floor

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm as something old school, bumping something old school
And I'm looking like a young buck, feeling like a old fool (Aha!)
You say the breezies want me, I say the breezies need me
You say the breezies talk me up, I say the breezies breathe me
In the place, shit faced and I'm leanin'
Holla at both of y'all, there's two of you I'm seeing
I'm down if they're stepping up let's step this party up
And hit the throttle, get the bottle, yup, mix it up with 7 Up
Wall to wall girlies looking like they wearing swimwear
Kali Baby in here, you know the Snake and the Bat
Look how lil' mama shaking that fat
Everybody looking, all the women hating at that
All the people in here crispy, twisted is how Krizz be
Thizzes getting passed around like they little frisbees
Gots to take lots of rock lobster shots to the dome to off me
I'm way too saucy

[Hook]
Saucy, saucy get to drinking with your girlfriend
Saucy, saucy way too much now I'm earling
Saucy, saucy lots of shots now it's time to go
Saucy, saucy I'm so tired, can't get off the floor

[Verse 3]
Girlies flocking to him, jocking
Rocking my sneakers, once fresh white T, party right by me
Hot the dance floor with my drink and my two-step
Party up the party til it hasn't any juice left
Who's coming with me, man?
It's several devil chicks looking for me to immediately
Beat these cheeks repeatedly
I'm too drunk to drive, ride on the passenger's side
Gotta get to where I'm going alive
Baby backing it up, put that thing on my lap and then what
Acting like you want me to beat up your tilapia
Slapping ya, right across that, 'cause I'm off that
Tee many martoonies, they running right through me
(Bet your cam when the shit come on
Put your hands in the air, this Big Krizz song)
Hyphy, might be, gone off the Long Island iced tea
It's on me, I'm awfully, saucy

[Hook]
Saucy, saucy get to drinking with your girlfriend
Saucy, saucy way too much now I'm earling
Saucy, saucy lots of shots now it's time to go
Saucy, saucy I'm so tired, can't get off the floor
