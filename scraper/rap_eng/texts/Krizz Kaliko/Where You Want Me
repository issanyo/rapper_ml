[Intro]
So, uh, after this dance.. maybe we can go back to my place
Have some donuts and milk
Listen to a pop tune, baby

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
What kind of man would come in spendin' up all of his money, and then leaving here with nothing?
What kind of girl would give it to you the way that you want it and make believe that it was nothin'?
And we grindin', you look in my eyes, and I think that you think what I'm thinkin'
And you touching me softly and taking it off, all my money is leavin'

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See, I keep trying to leave but ya
(Got me where you want me)
And I keep trying to go but ya
(Got me where you want me)
I don't need no more to drink 'cause ya
(Got me like I like me)
I thinkin' you want me 'cause ya
(Got me where you want me)

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Strip down to your birthday suit, give me that sexy dance
I can give it all to you, give me that sexy chance
And it's turning me on that you're leading me on
And I think it's on now
You movin' too slowly, give me what you owe me
All my money is gone now

[Bridge: Krizz]
Ooh, give me like I like it
Ooh, give me what I want it
Ooh, give me like I like it
Ooh

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See, I keep trying to leave but ya
(Got me where you want me)
And I keep trying to go but ya
(Got me where you want me)
I don't need no more to drink 'cause ya
(Got me like I like me)
I thinkin' you want me 'cause ya
(Got me where you want me)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Got me where you want me by the way you work it
Goddamn, that ass so perfect
Slow it down baby, let it surface
Goddamn, that ass so perfect

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
So what's it gon' be, baby?
Been waitin' for you to do somethin' all night
Spendin' all my money, my time
(Got me where you want me)
I just wanna take you home, baby
I just wanna, show you my bed
It's.. in my home, it's all so exciting
(Got me where you want me)

[Verse 4: Kutt Calhoun]
Uh, call me your long-lost one night stand until I'm found, and then I
Commence the beast and unleash, this is so profound, na na na
Got to show your body, what form
Why you should probably aboard a gigantic Charlie and Donkey fucking like man stick
You know you naughty, plus more the reason to party
For retreatment, I've gotten this store, it's a fucking playin' trick
Let Kutty cut ya, I'll lace the tune
It's nothing to face the rumors I'm bluffin' when I'm the brother that's up in the butt
Ruffin' it up, tuffin it up, any little kinks and I'll be touching it up
Got to speaking in tongue when you [haslinama, haslimana]
I got you

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
I got you where I want you, don't you know me baby?
Tell me, baby
Give it to me, baby
