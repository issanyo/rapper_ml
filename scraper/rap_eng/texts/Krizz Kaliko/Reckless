[Intro: Tech N9ne]
They say I need to slow down
Like I drink too much, I party too much
But I'm reckless baby
I was born that way, I’mma stay that way

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Niggas couldn’t see me if my vitiligo was neon
Nose in the air, staring at the planet that He on
Scratch you off my balls with my paws, y'all be gone
Effortlessly F em, left em jeffing, my nuts they be on
Get out my face is what they telling me
But I’m the shit, you smelling me
And I refuse to rep any letter, this ain’t no spelling B
So what I’m saying, ain’t no question who the man is
Kali take his chances with you jarets
I’mma keep on talking reckless, brothers left em respective efforts to dap em in
Used to be in love with the pen, don’t know what’s happening
Bread ain’t matching the abstract rapping, now how that’s happening
Everly telling me money’s funny
Why I ain’t laughing then?

[Bridge]
It’s like I got the wheel but I neglect it
Drunk as hell and don’t know where I’m headed
Sideways down a one way dead end
Telling you to get in
It’s like I’m talking Greasy to an OG
Slapped a couple pimps up like they owe me
Mugging you like nigga you don’t know me
I can be that nigga you want me to be

[Hook]
I be talking reckless reckless reckless reckless reckless
I be talking that reckless reckless reckless
Well shut up!
When you leave I’ll be talking that shit

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
But I’m a master when I match words
In a nutshell I bust well
After burner, taking off
I’m on a launch pad, no Duck Tales
What smells? I’m on fire
Throw a little wood up on the bonfire
Tell yo mutts I’m on a Helen Hunt
And now I’m mad about you, Paul Reiser
Killer on the mic, born naturally
Baseball bat with the barb wire
Mick Foley, I’m sick homie
If you paid for the verse you an art buyer
Ides to march, hide yo marks
Howard Stern, private parts
How on earth first thing that I prove is 13, is that I could chart?
Maybe I shouldn’t be giving you the crazy eye
If I was smart but I’m U-B-I and I’m reckless
Set tripping and writing for Ces bitch
Knock 'em out cold, south pole
Matter don’t money, I’m about dough
Fuck a hard rock, I’m a star fox
No Falco, outro

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Godemis]
I’m ahead of the curve cousin
Killing 'em, keeping it strange, I’m coming to burn something
Ain’t nobody on the radio
Fucking with us so you niggas ain’t heard nothing
Yet I’ve been up in the lab
With a pen and a pad, a couple of bad bitches
Blowing me off of the map and a matter of fact – I ain’t never had bitches
Killer City sinner Swillionaire
Pop a molly, put a drink in the air
I could be rotten or Akhenaten and with a rocking Ankh and a lock of my hair
Fuck if I care, fuck if I’m rare
I could be cutting the muck of the mayor
Wavy in the midi really we coming
Shake it up and I’m dumping the flare
Fan out, find him, find him, I need a necklace
A needle plus a package, a crash can complete the checklist
What I need is R&R when I’m buzzing as big as Texas
In the whip with no brakes, hitting the gas
Nigga, I’m reckless

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Nigga, do you know who I am?
Nigga, do you know who I am?
