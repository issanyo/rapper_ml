[Verse 1: Insidious Flow]
Yo, I'm sick on my stomach 'bout the way this life's running
I'm just glad to be alive but if I die I'll stop loving
Maybe that's the way we need to go
Why the fuck are we bleeding for
If God is up above, why didn't he compete with those
Motherfuckers who be taking the lives of a little 3 year old
But he always got the time to revive a rapists who needs parole
What about the people [?] they starving and probably need a home
[?] just wanna argue and bargain because they feed their on

[Bridge: Insidious Flow]
I- I don't know why
But something 'bout this story seem to be indeed alive
I cannot believe that you exist unless you try
Show yourself around me, give me something, give a sign
I don't want no fall victim do something that ain't right
I wanna know that there's something more when we gon' die
But it's hard to believe it when you can't see it with your eyes
All that hoping and pleading for Jesus, he ain't coming by

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm sleeping with the enemy
My life's inside out, I'm upside down, these beats are foul
Sleeping with the enemy
There's no escape from the darkness inside me, no way!
I'm sleeping with the enemy
My life's inside out, I'm upside down, these beats are foul
I'm sleeping with the enemy
There's no escape from the darkness inside me, no way!
I'm sleeping with the enemy

[Verse 2: Insidious Flow]
Oh, God'll save you when you have a gun to your head
That's what he said, let me know when you'll come back from the dead
I seem be touring with this guy in white and Devil in red
Tormented by all of these questions, mention them and I'm fed
To the public like I'm disgusting and summoned by the demons
Tryna be in the right state of mind but I'm always fleeing
Depleting under the heat of the beast and I'm tryna beat it
But completing with this reason is easily out of reaching, ah!

[Bridge: Insidious Flow]
I- I don't know why
But something 'bout this story seem to be indeed alive
I cannot believe that you exist unless you try
Show yourself around me, give me something, give a sign
I don't want no fall victim do something that ain't right
I wanna know that there's something more when we gon' die
But it's hard to believe it when you can't see it with your eyes
All that hoping and pleading for Jesus, he ain't coming by

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm sleeping with the enemy
My life's inside out, I'm upside down, these beats are foul
Sleeping with the enemy
There's no escape from the darkness inside me, no way!
I'm sleeping with the enemy
My life's inside out, I'm upside down, these beats are foul
I'm sleeping with the enemy
There's no escape from the darkness inside me, no way!
I'm sleeping with the enemy

[Outro]
I'm slepping with the enemy, upside down with this evil shit
(I'm slepping with the enemy)
I'm slepping with the enemy, friends of me better leave here quick
(I'm slepping with the enemy)
I'm slepping with the enemy, upside down with this evil shit
(I'm slepping with the enemy)
I'm slepping with the enemy, friends of me better leave here quick

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm sleeping with the enemy
My life's inside out, I'm upside down, these beats are foul
Sleeping with the enemy
There's no escape from the darkness inside me, no way!
I'm sleeping with the enemy
My life's inside out, I'm upside down, these beats are foul
I'm sleeping with the enemy
There's no escape from the darkness inside me, no way!
I'm sleeping with the enemy
