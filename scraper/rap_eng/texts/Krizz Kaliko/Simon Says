Let's play a game of Simon says!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] x2
Put your hands up like you're get held up (Simon says)
Make a lot of noise like you're getting felt up (Simon says)
We gettin' money there ain't nothing you can tell us
Do it! Only when I say so, only when I say (Simon says)

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Kali baby in the building baby talk about it
Head's too big, ain't no room to walk around it
I'm off in the clouds, can't be humble, can't be grounded
When you see the king kneal to the ground, make a fist and pound it
Follow me like your new leader, school teacher
I'm the head coach, you a cheerledaer,in a school bleacher
Me and Tech like the double creature feature
Heat ya up, shitting on you niggas
Damn we leave the seat up
Posted on the throne with my feet up
I'm tee'd off, 'cause T9 done drank the KC tea up (oh man)
So how low can you go
Nobody make a move (move) until Simon says so

[Hook] x2
Put your hands up like you're get held up (Simon says)

Do it! Only when I say so, only when I say (Simon says)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Only when I say so, only when I say
That some poltergeist lingo that was put on me in my day
When my money was in my A
When my homies was in my way
Now these ronees(?) attend my showees
And now they're wanting to spend my pay (hey!)
Simon Says
Go snow
Let these hoes know
Without no, oh-oh, better get steppin they get no doe
But slow glow make a bro grow, here go the mojo
(Bounce) (pogo pogo) up, down
Till it's rojo
You're gonna have to listen to Tech Nina to rhyme his dance
To the diamond encrusted snake and the bat with a diamond hand
You'd rather be spending your time in better dime instead
But the N9ne and Simon says you'd better do what ever the fuck!

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Stand at attention for your highness
Comin' for your highness while niggas be way behind us
Strange Music if you can't find us, you got on blindness
Steady mutiplying, your money be in the minus (okey)
They follow me like religously, bitches be jockin' me
'Bout that P, rich and have a Bent-e-ley
Mentally fly as an eagle, oh I think they like me
And stroking my ego (Kali Baby)
Fans do what I command 'em
Rappers don't talk to me
Tell 'em I can't stand 'em
And umm (what?)
If your hands still in the air
Wave 'em like you don't care
You can swear by my anthem
