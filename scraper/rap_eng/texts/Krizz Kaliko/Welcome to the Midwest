[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
The only real place to be
The middle of all controversy
West, yes, of the Mississippi
Welcome to the Midwest

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Pistol packin' and money mackin'
Rappin' up out the city where killaz keep it crackin'
Too dark and gritty, back in the dizzy
Jackin' was happenin'
Gafflin' many cacklin'
Now we packagin' crack and the addicts will POP
Kansas City, Missouri
Feel the fury of the inner city
Poverty stricken, novelty spittin'
Follow me quick into the bottom
We gotta be thizzlin'
No frickin apology given
You trippin', we lick a SHOT
Get ready to brawl, hometown
Breakin' a jawbone clown
You ain't a criminal killa
Be ready to get up and fall on down
Look at the darkside
Fulla the gangbangin'
Hookers wit' choppas
And the coppaz they keep them thangs rangin'
You ain't gotta be killa gangsta to know
That you can die tryna hide side thangs for the dough
But after the club, get to skippin' 'cause they trippin' off in the MO

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It doesn't really matter where you go
Where you've been
Beautiful foreign lands you've been in
Gun play reigns
Sun rays shine
Stay inside you should be fine
I'll show you, follow me
Wel-come to the mid-west

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
It's a city where anybody can 'cause you bodily harm
When you walk in my city hardly armed
And hardly safe to show your face
Apes will erase you and let the blades graze you for the paper
Nowhere to hide on either side of the water
For Gucci and Prada
Krizz and the millimeter will follow ya
Holler and scream, it won't get you a thing
So get you a thing, load it up wit' hollow ones
Light 'em up like a halogen
Look at the crime rate
No wonder why I hate
Niggas keep it peepin'
I'm seekin' it when you leavin' 'em
Keep 'em at bay
And take 'em away if it ain't in the day
Hurry get ya people up outta the K
The Mid (west) is more than just a little chaotic
And if we ain't got it we plottin' 'em to rob 'em for they checks
That be the nature of the beast, to keep the peace
I keep my piece when you in the midwest

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It doesn't really matter where you go
Where you've been
Beautiful foreign lands you've been in
Gun play reigns
Sun rays shine
Stay inside you should be fine
I'll show you, follow me
Wel-come to the mid-west

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Hands up, if you wit' it stand up
If ya get it Midwest, we admit it we the scheiße
Stand tough, we can get it manned up
When you visit, big stress hella when you recognize us
Hands up, it you wit' it stand up
If ya get it Midwest, we admit it we the scheiße
Stand tough, we can get it manned up
When you visit (wel-come to the mid-west)

[Verse 3 Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
If you trippin' we givin' you a lobotomy
Cannibal, you Hannibal can't amount to my psychology
And poppin' me better be the way you thinkin' of stoppin' me
Get on top of me quick before I make what I got on me click
Money, the mackin' and murder is all that we know
Whether sunny or black in the dirt I'ma gather my dough
If you hustlin' maybe the place you can get it for low
Get your package, and get to packin', gotta get it and go.”
Never walk in my city when alone better draw down
Keep them babies out the way
Catch a stray in the K-Town
Boss in my city
Never crawl, never fall down
Me and Millimeter spray in your way and you better lay down
Gangstas, mobstas, everybody know
'Cause in a town ya wanna clown around at the show
Pack a milli 'cause everybody silly
So get ready to hit the flo'

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It doesn't really matter where you go
Where you've been
Beautiful foreign lands you've been in
Gun play reigns
Sun rays shine
Stay inside you will be fine
Where you go
Where you've been
Beautiful foreign lands you've been in
Gun play reigns
Sun rays shine
Stay inside you will be fine
I'll show you follow me.....
Wel-come to the mid-west!
