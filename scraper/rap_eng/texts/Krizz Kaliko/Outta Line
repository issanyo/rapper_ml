Wake you..

[Verse 1]
Okay
We be good girls
You be bad boys
So what ails you (Sh)
So what ail- (Sh, Listen)
Can I ring your bell?
If I call you to come over, would you come?
Do them things, I know you won't tell
Anybody, cause they think that you're a nun
Now I can be gentlemanly or I can be rude
We all know what you're used to
Now we can go to dinner or you can make food
Sixty Eight'll get me closer to your number

[Hook]
Am I outta line?
Am I outta pocket?
If I told you it'd be good if I call you
And you don't mind
Or you'd have told me stop it
If I told you it'd be good if I call you

[Bridge]
(We be, we be on that good good
You be on that chang chang (?) )
I'll bet you do
I'll bet you do
(We be, we be, we be good girls
We just want that.. Hey!)
I'll bet you do
You know I do

[Verse 2]
And I think I love the girl (Love you)
And I think I love her mama (Mama freaky too) (?)
She could get it, get it right now
In them polyester sheets (Polyester sheets)
She could be from any land (Ah-Huh!)
I like it when they speak that foreign (Me gusta, baby)
Cause when the lights go out and they all screamin' 'Kali Baby!'

[Hook]
Am I outta line?
Am I outta pocket?
If I told you it'd be good if I call you
And you don't mind
Or you'd have told me stop it
If I told you it'd be good if I call you

[Bridge]
(We be, we be on that good good
You be on that tra-a-train (?) )
I'll bet you do
I'll bet you do
(We be, we be, we be good girls
We just want that.. Hey!)
I'll bet you do
You know I do

[Verse 3]
Peanut butter to the third power
(I got the Jelly!)
Peanut butter to the third power
(I got the Jelly!)
Peanut butter to the third power
(I got the Jelly!)
I can be gentlemanly or I can be rude
We all know what you're used to
Now we can go to dinner or you can be the food
Sixty Eight'll get me closer to your number

[Hook]
Am I outta line?
Am I outta pocket?
If I told you it'd be good if I call you
And you don't mind
Or you'd have told me stop it
If I told you it'd be good if I call you

[Bridge]
(We be, we be on that good good
You be on that tra-a-train (?) )
I'll bet you do
I'll bet you do
(We be, we be, we be good girls
We just want that.. Hey!)
I'll bet you do
You know I do (Gone.)
