[Intro]
To whom it may concern..

[Hook]
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
I'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
You sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang

[Verse 1]
I've been inside every hip-hop circle you could imagine
Gangster or Pop, even backpackers know that I'm real good at rappin'
I was strugglin' back in the day when my hood was lackin'
Yo, so I'm 'bout to talk about what should've, would've and could've happened
If music was about innovatin' and penetratin'
Generations by generatin' musical integration
It wouldn't be about limitation and demonstratin'
Imitation we then are blatantly just disintegratin'
It ain't about the music, it's just about the fame
If you ain't popular homie, then you just out the game
If video and radio don't frequently announce your name
They don't know your music even though you blow most out the frame
But a closed mouth don't get fed when it stays shut
Lay cuts with Tecca Nina 'cause he can straight bust
Say what? You ain't heard of me gettin' paid bucks?
Touring, y'all see me rippin' the stage up

[Hook]
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
I'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
You sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang
Why you ain't?

[Verse 2]
I've been on tour with Hov, 'bout 27 shows
Why he ain't have me on a record only heaven knows
Maybe he missed us, missin' the big picture
That this is a fixture, aw yeah, he got Twista!
Well Twista's my homie and we both from the Midwest
And I guess Hov ain't lookin' for another speedy rapper kid yet
Me collaboratin' with them was all in me dreams
Matter fact the only one of 'em called me was Beans
He told me he played you "The Industry Is Punks"
And you loved it so you know Tech is what the industry would want
I started down at the bottom, got with TOG and then it paid
But I would've loved to been on the third verse of "Renegade"
They must think I'm a stick of dynamite with no stem
That's probably why I got D12 but no Em!
But I burst flame and I bet that y'all know my first name
'Cause I'm the hardest this side of Earth, mane

[Hook]
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
I'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
You sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang
Why you ain't?

[Verse 3]
This ain't no hate-mail, this a love letter
I love you niggas' music and I hope it does better
I just wish you woulda hit a brother that love cheddar
But I'm ballin' now and I'm better than I was EVER
Space age flows like Jesse and Primrose
Tenfold, I used to open-up, now I end shows
Grim road, when you one of the best with slim dough
And you ain't got Dre, Storch, Pharrell and no Timbo
I've met almost half of the DTP
But the couple times I spoke to Luda, don't think he see me
Had never met I-20 but he spoke at BET
Shawnna love me, Field Mob and Chingy decently speak me
So I'ma reiterate the game it's all fame
And you don't get no play if you an emcee with a small name
If I wanna get on TV I guess I gotta call Pain
And Nelly, my great-grandmother's name is Maude Haynes

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm trippin', full of delusion
Maybe it come from all the drugs I was usin'
Maybe I am the best thing that you ever saw
Maybe I'm wrong and you don't know me at all
I guess I'm blinded, I got reminded
That none of you just will never know who the N9ne is
And you never heard of the homie from the Show-me
PUNK THAT! I know you niggas know me

[Hook]
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
I'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
You sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
I'm not broken-hearted, but it could have been on when I started
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
You sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my thang
Why you ain't?
