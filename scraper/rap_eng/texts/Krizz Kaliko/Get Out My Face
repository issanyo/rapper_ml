If you ain’t got no money (yup!), if you ain’t got no money (yup!)
If you ain’t got no money get the hell out of my face
Get the hell out of my face, get out of my face
Get the hell out of my face
And if you got the money, let me
Spend it, (spend it), spend it, spend it, (spend it)
Spend it, spend it, (spend it)
Make your whole crew do it, do it (aha!)
Spend it, (spend it), spend it, spend it, (spend it)
Spend it, spend it, (spend it)
Spend it, spend it, spend it
