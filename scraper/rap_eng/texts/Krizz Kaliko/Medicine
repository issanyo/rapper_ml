[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, it’s been 20 years and counting
Been hurtin' since the birth of me
Poppin' Percocets purposely
First to be medicating, they waitin' on the medic
I’m hatin', there’s to much pressure and giving me a headache
It was the Seroquel and Prozac (okay)
Vicodin's a throw-back (okay)
Ativan and Adderall, Depakote, I ain’t mad at ya’ll
Weaning myself off of the Celexa
I don’t know what's next, but it feels like the Devil's coming to get'cha!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Well I don’t feel good, and I don’t feel like I should
It must be my medicine, it must be my medicine
And I can’t calm down, I can’t calm down
I can’t calm down, I can’t calm down
Must be my medicine, it must be my medicine
And I can’t calm down
I think- I- I- I- I think little pills-pi-pill-pills is necessary
I think- I think- I think- I think- I think- I think- I think
Little pills is neces-necessary

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Th-Th-Throw 'em down my throat, my anxiety's out the roof
And it's proof that a loose screw can result in your loose tooth
Try to trust you, but I’m ailment with loose truth
On my nails, and I’ve chewed threw
I'm derailed like a choo-choo
I’m tryna get off, because of the laws
I’m tryna figure out some things
If I stay addicted, I'mma be afflicted with pain
My mental state is hanging in the balance
I’m crazy that's the reason I got talent
[?]

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Well I don’t feel good, and I don’t feel like I should
It must be my medicine, it must be my medicine
And I can’t calm down, I can’t calm down
I can’t calm down, I can’t calm down
Must be my medicine, it must be my medicine
And I can’t calm down
I think little pills is necessary
I think little pills- pills is necessary

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Fame after ya brain
Snatching all thangs
Got to 'cause grain
Alcohol, and mix it with darkness
'Cause the business is heartless
Heart, art, to start sip some bars, regardless
Pain, where my bottle at?
Bringin' that water back
Exchange it for Jameson, mane, got a lot of that
Aim where the dollars at, drain in my veins
What remains is the strain and a lot of Yac

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Well I don’t feel good, and I don’t feel like I should
It must be my medicine, it must be my medicine
And I can’t calm down, I can’t calm down
I can’t calm down, I can’t calm down
Must be my medicine, it must be my medicine
And I can’t calm down, I can’t calm down
I can’t calm
