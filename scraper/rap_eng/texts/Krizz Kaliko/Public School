[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Are you ready for it?
We ready for it!

[Verse: Tech N9ne]
Most of my teachers didn't teach me shit!
Chiefin' in the locker room, fuck English Lit
Oh why, oh why, oh why I had to take wood shop?
Instead of speaking French, when I went there I could not!
A lot of truancy 'cause they couldn't influence me
To fluently spew it, the two couldn't do it congruently
So I learned culture, rock music, rockin'
While I rock up that Coca, Pac on my poster!
So now I'm part of it when I used to fear it
I learned a lot of shit but most would not clear it
Some were scared of me and would not come near this
People failed me but music lifts my spirit!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They writing on the walls, fighting in the halls
This education kicked me in my fucking balls
They fighting in the class, fighting in P.E
This education's un-educating me!
(You're in my head, you're mine till I'm dead)
I am my mother's child and I wish I knew what I know now
I am my teacher's favorite, I made it and I don't know how

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
First day is a bitch (first day is a bitch)
First day is a bitch (first day is a bitch)
Think I'm wanting to ditch (think I'm wanting to ditch)
'Cause you ain't teaching me shit ('cause you ain't teaching me shit)
I was bored with the classes they gave me
So I stole the books that I wanted
I taught myself to think different
Now I'm the number one independent rapper in the world
Tech N9ne (the chill factor)
