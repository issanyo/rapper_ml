Who woulda thought I'd have to pop a trunk

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Air Force 1's on my feet
I ride a Chevy (?) the freaks
Yo I can't stop stop cause my clique still with me
Life is twirl my rims is still spinning
Increase my goal and pop my collar
Bad bitches talking in the club with they Prada
Open my trunk with a lame if I gotta
Show em how quickly a comedy turn to drama
Blaze dead bull for saying shit outta line
Something like (?) a lame get outta time
(?) pop some pills to power up
Don't [?] I used to buy them shells when I (?)
I bust, boy you talkin' shit then don't play around us
My niggas'll split your wig
Uh, uh, ya dig?
My crew like what it do
Air 1's on my toes in the club when I roll through

[Hook: Big Kriz Kaliko]

[Verse 2: Big Kriz Kaliko]
Now bigger straps than forces are shell-toed Adidas
Can tell who it is by the way we rob people
We headed to the club to see what we can snuff out
But first we head to the spot so we can get totally drilled out
There's no doubt that the boys from down south
Take a look at the kids they taking what I dream about, sex
Now what you think that I came here for?
To buy (?) for my Adidas? No!
(?)
(?)
In the (?) of the room on the flow, in them nice kicks
Drinking that lady pipe, don't say that you don't like this
I see you (?), so I'm knowing that ya liked it
Now hold up, I see some niggas gettin' (?)
Now all my niggas right here because we (?) more than doves
Hey, Killa K bring it out because I thought that it was all up
But at the end of the night it seems we gotta pop the trunk
