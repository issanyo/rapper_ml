[Intro]
The following is a list of things to do if I ever go
Followed by a list of people I love in my book of life
So if you're listenin', party for your boy if I ever go
Big Krizz Kaliko

[Verse 1]
Now, I, Krizz Kaliko, hear bein' the sound mind and body
Duly command you to party
And toast to that guy that made you see fat guys in a different light
Leap with the beat when he touched the mic
Now listen closely cause I won't repeat myself
And if you're close to me
Peep in and a keep a peace for yourself
I make it easy if a people grievin' and livin' in hell
Jesus got me sleepin' peacefully livin' somewhere else
I ain't got much: some cars and some jewels
And some fools who love me
Fans that's just waitin' to hug me
A wife and a son who I'm absent from
And a mama who raised to be just what I've become (Krizz Kaliko!)
You couldn't forget me if you tried to
This is for all my people to write to
And to my sisters and my nephews
Uncle Chris ain't left you cause through my music
I feel like I can bless you

[Chorus]
Life don't last forever no
If I was to ever go (if I ever go)
Remember, (if I ever leave) I love you (if I ever go)
If I was to ever leave
Something you done say to me (if I ever go)
Remember, (if I ever leave) that I love you
(That's what you should know)

[Verse 2]
Crystal, I know you missin' me badly
That picture that boy be pointing to, pick it up and kiss daddy
Cuz I ain't ain't far, baby, I'm right by your side
Think of me and close your eyes
I knew that I would go first
The only reason I'm even writing this verse
Is just to ease the pain, I know that it hurts
I'm always thinkin' the worst
She gotta go on, you can-you can go on
And date him in the beyond (and I ain't gonna hate, no)
And teach him 'bout his daddy and how he was a fool
He's already funny, he'll probably be one too
Or an athlete, a musician
Growing up boy you listen, you getting big
Keep him out the kitchen
Listen
And G-O-D free me and let me B E
And bury me a C-E
Spark up a T-R-E-E
And cheers to the guy, as you're gettin' high
For an angel of a man livin' in the sky

[Chorus]
Life don't last forever no
If I was to ever go (if I ever go)
Remember, (if I ever leave) I love you (if I ever go)
If I was to ever leave
Something you done say to me (if I ever go)
Remember, (if I ever leave) that I love you
(That's what you should know)

[Verse 3]
I guess you are for my bigger brother Joe, little Yony, and Tanya
Dink, the whole clan, and Landa
Franny, Uncle Sonny, Uncle Hank, little Chris and Donna
Alex, you know I love your momma
Nena and Kendra and John, Tech N9ne keep on keeping on
Keep Kutty and Trav on the path you on
And Elegne, Erica, and Monyay and look out for nigga Charles Nay, Nick
Big Fred, somebody help him keep a cool head
And for my niggas representing the red and representing the blue
And if I didnâ€™t mention you, you hold a special place in my hear too
Barbara Jean, there's no words to explain
There can never be another or better example of a mother
If I ever leave, Marcus, take care of my family
Keep pursuing your dream, we still a team
If i ever leave

[Chorus]
Life don't last forever no
If I was to ever go (if I ever go)
Remember, (if I ever leave) I love you (if I ever go)
If I was to ever leave
Something you done say to me (if I ever go)
Remember, (if I ever leave) that I love you
(That's what you should know)
