[Intro: Krizz Kaiko]
Ya left me
I act like I don't know why
Ya came back
And gave it another try
But Im caught up
And my old habits a lie
So we stop...
And now were sayin' bye bye

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
If ya ask me to kill I would
If ya ask me to steal I would
If you want me to love I could
But we're so misunderstood

[Verse One: Krizz Kaliko]
Me and you together ain't really good anyway
We could break up or just break out
In a heated argument on any given day
I'm impossible
Being with me is an obstacle
Women of the world I got lots to pull
But we closer than most
Especially with our clothes on the floors
I only give a dose to them hoes
And without you is the one thing I hate
Togethers our fate
But if ya ask baby I would jump in a lake
And I cheated
You stayed faithful
And I'm ungrateful
And I act so damn hateful
And over and over, I know that it's over, finito
Cause I ain't seen when they get control of my libido
Forget about it
Cause I mean the world of you
I was just playin' with them girls baby I love you
I know I messed up with ya baby I owe you
If we break up I'm a die or you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Baby this is too hard
The fightin' and the fussin'
And the cussin' and ya bustin'
Me in my mouth
Girl I just want ya heart
I'm tusslin' with the fact that ya want me to get out
But I ain't leavin'
You will listen to me now
If I gotta hold ya down (down, down)
Were so misunderstood
Ya family wonderin' why ya still keepin' me around

[Hook]
