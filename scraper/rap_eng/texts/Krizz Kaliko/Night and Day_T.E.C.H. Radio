[Intro: Amanda Root & Tech N9ne]
Night and day
Ha ha, it's Tech N9ne, baby

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Put the rappers out commission, to the mouth they 'bout to listen
Do it up, reroute conditions make you bounce without permission
Check it out, we 'bout to glisten, bring 'em out, we scout them chickens
We don't need no strife in this, 'cause life's a bitch never doubt we thizzlin'
Better triple-lock your vixens, 'cause I make them rock with diction
Let go inhibitions and hittin' this one with all the fixins
So put the knife away, party your life away
Hardly evil 'cause we the party people (night and day)

[Chorus: Amanda Root (Tech N9ne) & Krizz Kaliko]
Night and day (we we we what?) Party parlay
Party hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy
Night and day (we we we what?) Party parlay
Party hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy
Night and day

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Life's a bianca, so me and Kali create the Funkra
Don't interrupt me during me mantra
Hunts for party chicks in Sri Lanka
Past them hookers, with fat ass like Ashton Kutcher we Punk'd ya
Dash to the liquor store, past me no Michelob bastard
Half, on the Henndo & Captain with it 'cause we masters
Heineken bottles behind a thin model with collagen
Kind, in Colorado, benign, like rollo, she swallowin'
Tarantula with fruit punch, vodka, and cranberry
Sara cara terra bou lou so I can stand barely
Yeager bombs Goldenschlager or you can feel the pain
Of Cuervo, Silver Patron Tequila
Dos Equis, Corona, Sapporo
Give me the Pies, Porter Goldstofchen out of the bottle
Gobble the Malibu baby I don't mean to startle you
We do what we gotta do to get the party inside of you

[Chorus: Amanda Root (Tech N9ne) & Krizz Kaliko]
Night and day (we we we what?) Party parlay
Party hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy
Night and day (we we we what?) Party parlay
Party hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy
Night and day

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I hit the party with 50 niggas, we blood hounds
We come to kick it with Biancas and tear the club down
If these haters trippin' 'cause their women love clowns
At the back of the club stickin', she making love sounds
Have women and we'll travel, she will straddle
Saddle up bitches 'cause this is a, real battle
I'm loving to parlay, rock & roll even Sade
Playin' when layin' having our nasty little soiree
Party like it's your last day, to get your last say
Take the pathway, to ecstasy hit you the fast way
Get so drunk I might just have to crawl tonight
I'm 'bout to rock it, shake it, rip it up and ball tonight
Take a look off in my eyes, I come with no disguise
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt I'm a big surprise
Gotta party right away, we can hit your hideaway
KCMO is just a flight away - Night and Day

[Chorus: Amanda Root (Tech N9ne) & Krizz Kaliko]
Night and day (we we we what?) Party parlay
Party hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy
Night and day (we we we what?) Party parlay
Party hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy hardy
Night and day

[Outro:Tech N9ne]
Yeah
When it comes to partying
Strange Music, we the best (the best)
Eheh
We party all day all night, baby
Tech N9ne
Tip you bartenders, PUNKS
Drink 'til you get drunk
With Tech N9ne
We the party people night and day
Living crazy is the only way

Night and Day
