[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
This here's my two week notice
If you hear that I've resigned
I fear this world don't want us
And they rather see us fly
I've been out on my own and seen a million folks
I'm not sure I can stomach this place any longer
I speak to buried souls, they want me down below
But I've been fightin' and these three eyes have been gettin' stronger

[Hook: Bernz]
Yeah, these are last days
Drink up, get blasted
We know it's over so we sport the highest fashions
The very last days
Seems nothing's lasting
We're celebrating 'cause the end is finally happening

What's happening? What's- what's happening?
We're celebrating 'cause the end is finally happening
What's happening? What's- what's happening?
We're celebrating 'cause the end is finally happening

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
You can take this job and shove it, rub it
I can do something better and think a-nothing of it
Got a God complex, into raw bomb sex
I can take the beat anywhere if it's done by Plex
Disrespectful, effortless to get ahead of you
It's dark in this business, a shark in this business
Gotta make money for my wife and baby
Sit on a wing and a prayer that drives me crazy
So forget about a party, hardy-hardy
You ain't loving me by the time that I'm 40? Sorry
Ahead of the game or are we - tardy?
Got make our own and got a check from Accardi
Here's my two week notice, notice I'm getting outtie
Gotta be in a place where the crowd is around me
The end is near, I get scared, fear tell me, "Come here"
I say, "Fuck it, chuggin' a beer"

What's happening? What's- what's happening?
We're celebrating 'cause the end is finally happening
What's happening? What's- what's happening?
