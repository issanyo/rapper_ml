[Intro: Tech N9ne]
All hail to the N9NE!
You punks thought it was over for me?
I shall prevail in any situation
All hail the high exalted punks
Tech N9ne!
Move something do something, scream something AIGHHHTT
Cruel-some, gruesome, hoodlums AIGHHHTT

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm still climbin'
Niggas be rhyming
But they can't get with me
So you can keep hatin'
I'll be money makin'
Swimming in victory

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yo, yo
They thought it was over, but I gots to bust
Call them foes, stealing flows, that they got from us (What?)
We coming through your city with lots of lust
Get the dough, get ya hoes, then we knock them up and cut
Still clowning, jealousy be frowning
Keep in the street pounding, haters that be downing
Y'all keep houndin', looking for new sounds
That N9na done put down, well hey baby you found 'em
We victors, invested in big wars
We coming to get yours, we hit 'til it get sore
We spit acrobatical, never simple schematical
Vivid liquid compatible, shrooms, X's and Adderalls
Thought Anghellic wouldn't make it, we take it
Every time, get your girly butt naked
Real melons, still Heaven, still Hellin'
Still bellin' through the city, with them class A felons
At that bar with it, the fans know it how we are with it
Caribou Lou, with a Churchill cigar with it
Don't never for-get it, woman getting targeted
Six hundred cars with it, Tech is coming hard with it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm still climbin'
Niggas be rhyming
But they can't get with me
So you can keep hatin'
I'll be money makin'
Swimming in victory
I'm still climbin'
Niggas be rhyming
But they can't get with me
So you can keep hatin'
I'll be money makin'
Swimming in victory

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
All I wanna see is broads with us, Strange hella odd niggas
Roll with them hard hitters, that would mob with us
So God get us, player haters that squab with us
They bob with us
'Cause the Tecca N9na is bizarre literature
I'm A (WHAT?!)
Party animal, horny and a punani cannibal
Can nobody calm me, the killa Dahni is a zombie and ho'
Ladies on the dance floor
Let yo homey make you touch your toes, skip them foes, strike a pose
Hot as hell, grab your chicken head by the tail
A lot of tail â€” can generate you a lot of mail
I'm the victorious, you the victim
Ya gal took my lizard and licked him
And my twins she kissed 'em (MUAHH)
So tell me how this tune sounds
You love it so don't never turn the boom down
You never thought we be some scholars with shrooms round
Mexi-can women, now we ballers and poon hounds

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm still climbin'
Niggas be rhyming
But they can't get with me
So you can keep hatin'
I'll be money makin'
Swimming in victory
I'm still climbin'
Niggas be rhyming
But they can't get with me
So you can keep hatin'
I'll be money makin'
Swimming in victory

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Hahaha
Yo
That's why your mama got a big 'ol butt ( OH YEAH )
And your sister got a big 'ol butt ( OH YEAH )
Since your mama and your sister had a big 'ol butt
They helped the N9na bust a big 'ol nut ( OH YEAH )
I'm the King (king)
Niggas that know it
That's why they want me in the ring (ring)
Hoping I blow up but I love the cream (cream)
Is what I mean (mean)
No matter what kind of lyrics you write
Tech N9ne fans don't want to hear it tonight
All hail to my jail homies
Cameron, Moberly, Boomville
You can bet we soon will (What?) Bump head
A wise man once said (What?)
"Everybody want go Heaven but nobody want dead"
Numb heads, if they diss the vet
Break the motherfuckers down if they disrespect the Tech
This is Victory 'cause I gets the check
I leave you player haters glistening wet
PUNK BITCH
