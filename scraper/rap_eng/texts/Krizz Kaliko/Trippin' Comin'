The Hole

(Played Backwards:)
Some might call me uh paranoid
But I think I would just say that I was very aware of my surroundings!"

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Retrogression
Let's go back to an earlier state
Back when a bunch of cats was jumped into this world via hate
Gangbang shit, yeah I'm guilty of it
When I'm looking at the TV, man seem like everybody really love it
Wave they flags high, for the world to see
Even though we know we don't want our son and little girls to be
Nothing like we were, some of these youngsters got no thumpers
Bet they want no funk, but they could get shook up like a seizure
If bangin' retrogresses, now the color's no longer measures
Stresses of rival sets get wet, go get the Tec, and press it
To make sure they get the message, a lot of these motherfuckers
Reppin sets know they faking just like they know the phrase "Don't F with Texas"
But still oblivious and fancy free
But real life is mo' serious than a damn TV

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Like '85 they might be gunnin'
While you living like the Drummonds
Or you sippin' wit' your woman
I can feel the trippin' comin'

When they all talking loud
Feelin' proud cause no one is gunnin'
Hey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'

When I'm down for the town
In the club beefing with the woman
Hey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'

[Verse 2]
They was family, used to love you
Swear to God that they would never put nothing above you
It's just to, see your successes, then 'bout plug you
Put slugs to, cause they ain't with you so now it's fuck you
I get so much love, I get to searching
For the evil cuz is coming, I can see right through the curtain
But the haters fill with anger, I can feel it's about to worsen
The bigger that I get, I can feel these tricks is sick for certain
When I'm partying without my body-guardians, I'm hardly and chill mode
Cuz I'm feelin they wanna scar me and fill those
Clips with lead and headed to kill foes
They real hoes plus they fake fuckers like dildos
Envy can equal murder, show love but they preferred to
Hurt her servers, picks alert us, quick with the squirter

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Why do I see mayhem?
Cuz when I watch the news I say damn
Everybody living in they last days
Are in hate and waste and
Innocent children, evil it feels the nation
Facin', life sentences are the case man
It's just too good to be true
Or maybe not huh?
Buried in the hood could be you
Cuz you got some
Extra, but next brah, ain't lookin for no kinda lecture
When you sittin on something better, gotta be alert
Or you off in a stretcha
When I'm 'sposed to be here in fun
I'm standing near a gun
Cuz I ain't gotta have no demons
Scheming on me, tryin to tear a lung
I'm just a real one
I keep my eyes open for the bullshit
Never am I clueless
I'm looking every direction
Everywhere it comes
From

(Played Backwards:)
No matter how big I get, or how much money I make
The seepage will always find a way
