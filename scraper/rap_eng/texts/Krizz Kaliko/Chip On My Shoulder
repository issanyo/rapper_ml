[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Genius: A person of great and original creative ability
Of extreme talent and superior intellect
This is Genius
Chip on my

[Hook]
Shoulder, I can't hold it in much longer
Words are gettin' stronger
I'm gettin' closer to you, you're closer to me
So knock the chip off and we'll see

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Now I got a chip on my
Shoulder, might as well be a boulder
I'm holdin' it with four molar holders and I got a holy roller motives
Take a bite off my, right off my plate, then I'm leavin' this evening
A piece of my reading, it's the meat with no seasoning
You can't even it out with a steam roller, I steam over ya
Free throw as sick in style as Ebola, he colder than a mouth full of Ricola
Bacardi on the rocks and Pepsi Cola
Maybe you be that one youngster when you're a wee older
Chip on your shoulder when you know you're an elite soldier
Believe me, but believe, wanna see me on
When I hit TV, better leave me on
Spit telekinesis far as it reaches
People can see I'm a beast at this
Hit the repeat and the heat don't be leavin' this
Got a chip on my shoulder and bet you'll be leavin' it

[Hook]
Shoulder, I can't hold it in much longer
Words are gettin' stronger
I'm gettin' closer to you, you're closer to me
So knock the chip off and we'll see

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Ay ay! There's a chip there (too)
Gotta pair you two
While I dare you
What I say to you might scare you
The rap's apostle possibly pop you
Wrassling hip-hop with a bird's-eye view
When I had on a mask since I was about two
So (they're all gonna laugh) at me, not you
Lyrically I'm the atrium
Look eye, when ya facin' them
Never mind cause you hatin' them
40 said, "If you do your due diligence
You could be killin' 'em
Stacks you could pill up their feelin' ya"
Krizz a piston in all of the cylinders
Even if we get crumbs for runs
The stadiums is still fillin' up
We killin' up anybody runnin' up
And head on the snake and black flyin' mammal so nigga, what?
Go on dig 'em up, your favorite rappers and start feelin' 'em again
Kali'll kill 'em again

[Hook]
Shoulder, I can't hold it in much longer
Words are gettin' stronger
I'm gettin' closer to you, you're closer to me
So knock the chip off and we'll see
