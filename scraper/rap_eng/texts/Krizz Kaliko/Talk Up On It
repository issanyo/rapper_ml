[Verse 1]
I'm only thinking of myself
When I make you feel so com-fortable
You hate it, I'll just flirt with someone else
Till I make you make your mind up
You can't take it

[Bridge]
If I tell you you're a star falling from the sky
And make you think that you're the apple of my eye
And I can tell you that I'll never tell a lie
But you don't need another reason why

[Chorus]
I'm just trynna talk up on it (okay)
Leave me alone
I'll only do what you let me
Talk up on it!
Wouldn't do that 'till you met me
Talk up on it!
I know you know I'm the one
Let me talk up on it! Ah-ha!

[Verse 2]
I'll leave love up to someone else
But I'll make you feel a lifetime in one minute
You can stand it by yourself
Cause the night is young but thirsty's no way to spend it

[Bridge]
Let me tell you you're a star falling from the sky
And make you think that you're the apple of my eye
And I can tell you that I'll never tell a lie
But you don't need another reason why

[Chorus]
Oh, baby I'm just trynna talk up on it (okay)
Leave me alone
I'll only do what you let me
Talk up on it!
Wouldn't do that 'till you met me
Talk up on it!
I know you know I'm the one
Let me talk up on it! Ah-ha!

[Verse 3: Krizz & (Woman)]
Can I say something to you?
(That will make me do...)
Exactly what I want you to do
(...I want you to...)
Take you where I want you to go
(And leave you sayin' right!)
Right, baby won't say no
(Talk to me babe!)
I like to do it
You like to do it
We like it, we should
Do it!
A couple shots will make it better
(I wish this night could last forever!)

[Chorus: Krizz & Woman]
Leave me alone
I'll only do what you let me
Talk up on it!
Wouldn't do that 'till you met me
Talk up on it!
I know you know I'm the one
Let me talk up on it!

[Outro]
But I don't listen when you say
Leave me alone
I'll only do what you let me
Talk up on it!
Wouldn't do that 'till you met me
Talk up on it!
I know you know I'm the one
Let me talk up on it! Ah-ha!
