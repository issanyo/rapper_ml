[Intro: Tech N9ne]
We gon' make 'em slither dance to this one Zilla

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaiko]
E'rybody just, throw your hands up what
All the ladies just, throw your legs up what
All the fellas just, throw your cups up
And toast to the homeboy that off in yo' girls guts, what?
Say man she said she broke up with you last week
Now you trippin' 'cause your chicken went out and passed cheeks
And got a fast leak, from Tecca N9na Katrina
Now she right up in mi cocino while your ass sleeps
How'd I take her from you? Oh, it twern't nuttin'
It's because your girly girly know I earn somethin'
Now I got them legs over my shoulders
Holdin' my soldier, swollen, I can't hold my composure
And when I come to town, your woman come around
And plenty fun is found when I give her some of the clown
The Kansas City style got her yellin' "just gimme now"
You don't wanna hear the sound 'cause I'm doin' 'bout 20 rounds

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
If your girl's at a Tech show, it's what you thinkin'
Feel like she let go, it's what you thinkin'
You never get no, it's what you thinkin'
(Yeah) it's what you thinkin', (yeah) it's what you thinkin'
If your girl's at a Tech show, it's what you thinkin'
Feel like she let go, it's what you thinkin'
You never get no, it's what you thinkin'
(Yeah) it's what you thinkin', (yeah) it's what you thinkin'

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
She know you barely make it, we got crazy cash
On the movie set, me and my homie Baby Bash
Got your girl waitin' to get her world shakin'
At the Grand American givin' your girl spankin's
'Cause she's a bad gal, she said she need a release
So she greeted with beast now she's no longer sad now
I'm with your wifey
'Cause she say I make her feel wanted and by the way she never met nobody like me
At the Graft'n and laugh makin' her stare at these
Cutty Cal Grese Chris havin' the paracleese
Got your hottie naughty when she drinkin' them Cara B's
At Kidd Rock's and I'm off in a booth with Tara Read
Tecca N9na is not a coward, I'll jump in the shower
And bumpity bumb that rock girl if you doubt us
Ask freaky Adina Howard about it
She know we Scorpios lovin' to hit it for hours

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
If your girl's at a Tech show, it's what you thinkin'
Feel like she let go, it's what you thinkin'
You never get no, it's what you thinkin'
(Yeah) it's what you thinkin', (yeah) it's what you thinkin'
If your girl's at a Tech show, it's what you thinkin'
Feel like she let go, it's what you thinkin'
You never get no, it's what you thinkin'
(Yeah) it's what you thinkin', (yeah) it's what you thinkin'

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I see you mad at me, but my nads happy
'Cause you losin' and now you wanna take a stab at me
She hangin' wit' me, 'cause you foul nigga
And I'm at the four seasons takin' her to eat a Tao nigga
That's T.A.O, when I see a ho
She's hooked when I let the instant replay go
She's bare now everyone's there throwin' wood at it
Man this music's so unfair if you good at it
Come wit' us women it's so fun wit' us under the sun wit' us
From dawn til' dusk, I'ma give her the lovin' that make her wanna say hamduilla
Praisin' this craziness in Vegas when I get up on the stage it's outrageous
Mandaly Bay with the right ages everybody get laid to this
I apologize if your heart broken
Keep a spark smokin' once the N9na starts scopin'
She'll lie to you and won't blink
When it come to Tech N9na bein' wit' your lady don't think (don't think!)!

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
If your girl's at a Tech show, it's what you thinkin'
Feel like she let go, it's what you thinkin'
You never get no, it's what you thinkin'
(Yeah) it's what you thinkin', (yeah) it's what you thinkin'
If your girl's at a Tech show, it's what you thinkin'
Feel like she let go, it's what you thinkin'
You never get no, it's what you thinkin'
(Yeah) it's what you thinkin', (yeah) it's what you thinkin'

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Ha ha it's what you though dawg your chicks wit' us
Tech N9ne, Kalikeezy, Young Green why you keep doin' it to yourself dawg
Her jaws are full, get back, she'll holla tomorrow
