[Hook: Adrian Truth]
Your world can get flipped upside down
Ten toes remain I keep it G
Never been known for the handouts
Chin up, chest out, it's all on me
But now I'm elevated, I made it, quit hating
But now I'm elevated, I made it

[Verse 1: JL]
Life is unpredictable and unapologetic
Hustling's habitual, winning is not  genetic
Struggling is hectic, without it just not as epic
I keep one expression like too much collagen got injected
Never let em see me sweat
I've been but I won't show em stress
I don't think there is anything about being broke I'll miss
Stranging everything I'm a soldier, I'm a chauvinist
Ten toes down with my chin up, poking out my chest
No regrets
No sympathy, no charity
Put every word and then carefully fully aware that our word is our therapy
Niggas be looking like "seriously, how did he do it?", come up with conspiracies
I get a moment of clarity, I can do more when my mama 'n em carry me
Even if I took a L straight, I'll still never be a loser
From the bottom of the bottom making lemonade I keep a lemon juicer
People tell me I'm a God to em not too odd but the future
Talking to a sucka nigga, he would say I ain't actin' like I used to, but I know

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
A lot of the homies are dead
Lot of the homies are dead
We doing it all for the bread
Doing it all for the bread
I'm dealing with all of this stress
Getting it off of my chest
All that we want is success
And we never settle for less
My manager died, look at the baddest survive
Ain't nobody helping my momma, we waiting on dad to arrive
It's easy to get a girl pregnant, it take a man to provide
I'm keeping my feet on the ground, I got my hands in the sky
Trying to pray to a god that I've never met, living with sin
Is better than trying to live with all the regret from what that I did
I cover the scars and tats all on my skin
But please don't get it confused of where I'm going and where I've been (Yo let em know man)
I've been around the globe and then back again, did a lot for a little hood Latin kid
Earned it all was never handed shit, so my reputation's immaculate
New York to Los Angeles, no fuck shit, I handle it
Anything that I want to have, I ain't asking for it, I'm grabbing it

[Verse 3: Joey Cool]
I'm the product of what happens to you when you wear your heart up on a sleeve as if it's tatted on you
I done pissed so many people off I took sabbaticals
And that's what happens, we're not happy and you all irrational
Had to summon up the powers of the supernatural
Going a hundred miles an hour down destruction avenue
Drinking my jack and smoking sour in a fucking Malibu
With an attitude but that's just what a chaos addict do
Everybody mad at you
I was drinking everyday and every weekend
Like a fish up in the deep end of the ocean
On my shoulders sat a demon
Every time I thought I'd leave him he'd just tell me that I need him
He was just trying to make it even
For some reason I believed him
I'm a Libra so I understood the balance he was seeking
I'm bout to raise the challenge to you, J they really ain't competing
This what they want, guess I'ma have to comply
It's just like taking a beating
Y'all got to go, we finna tell you goodbye
No really we just had to meet ya

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
Now how can I just keep it to myself when I'm
Eating sandwiches but I'm looking at a steak dinner
Is it impossible for me to get optimal oculars on my popping composition when you a bread winner
Maybe if I was like this then I'm cool
People would love me with strangers I'm throw'd
But I be vacating games, playing like PlayStation
They taking aim so lames be patient it's painstaking (Okay)
Moving a product, even in the digital world, I'm feeling invisible
I think about it like I'm getting rid of a girl, it's making me miserable
But I adjust and I don't pay it no mind
I'm built for this on stilts and my bitches be fine
It's like I'm mental, be gentle, the ten toes is just a memento of what I do to instrumentals
Fresher than a pre-teen that's full of pimples
Ain't got no floss, menthol, polar bear with peppermint claws
Fuck y'all
