[Verse 1]
Are you surprised to see me?
Yeah, you left me for dead
But I made it instead
And you thought that I’d never make it
Feelin' like the world strip me naked
Not who I used to be
Now they scream for me
And you created a monster

[Hook]
Who am I to you? (nobody)
Who are you to me? (nobody)
Life ain't so long
Guess I made this song for you
You did it, you did it
You created a monster
Oh-oh, you created a monster
Oh-oh, you created a monster
Oh-oh, such a beautiful monster

[Verse 2]
Guess I get picked last in gym class again
There go the fat kid, we can kick ass on him
And he funny lookin’ and he can’t even afford lunch
So just give him a bunch of punches in his stomach maybe
Roughin' him up and then making 'em cry
Cause he got Vitiligo on his mouth and on his eyes
And he’ll never fight back, he ain't built like that
He’s a scaredy cat, afraid he might get killed like that
Mama's boy, turn them into ominous
It’s probably just a matter of time
Before he come to school like it's Columbine
Minus the trench coats, slit throat them foe
Put ‘em in a choke hold, never let ‘em grow old
Mama told me make it into a gimmick
And my Aunt Fay told me it’s a reason God made you this way
What the world did to me is comin’ right back at ya
I’m glad that I had to be a monster
Monster
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, such a beautiful monster

[Hook]
