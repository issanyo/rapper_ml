[Tech N9ne interlude]
Yo what's up?
(Hey daddy)
I can't wait to get home and get at you baby
(I know)
When I get home, I'ma suck you like a neck bone
(Oh yeah)
I'ma hop you like a cricket and suck you like a biscuit
I wanna hit it from the back and smack it
(Ooh yeah, baby)
Hahaha

[Chorus]
[Krizz Kaliko]
Give me all that I need
I'm insatiable
Baby and I need it more than just a little bit
Give me more than I need
Cause I'm looking for satisfaction
I need action
Sexy heffer
What you here for?
To rock the guest spot
With a heavy keffer
Get you messed up
Get you sexed up
Throw them legs up

Prad is next up

[Tech N9ne interlude]
Doggy style, what you think about that?
(I love it)
I'm talking about real, real, real hard doggy

[Pradagy]
Yeah
We'll make you something like a psychic
Cause looking at me is like looking at the future
And I can see that you like it
Now I'ma ride solo but you should bring a sidekick
And when the night hits, that can be your bitch and my bitch
Or that's our bitch
You rolling with me because that other nigga is garbage
If he's getting on your nerves, shit, sit him on the curb
Send him on his way, tell him: "Have a nice day"
Because you got somewhere today and that is what the Pradagy, okay?
You're dealing with one of the besta
And I betcha
My sex'll put you right to sleep like Lou Nesta
Sweet dreams, no need to bring a washcloth
No more cream, I'll lick the peach clean
Yeah I know I'm sorry, too much information
But that thing between your thighs
Gives me such a sensation
It's my, my drug of choice, it's the high I keep chasing
So when you see me on your homegirl, stop hating
Insatiable

[Chorus]

[Krizz Kaliko]
Below is next up

[Tech N9ne interlude]
Remember how I used to choke yu when we were doing it, baby?
(That was the best)
Remember how I used to smack the hell out of you, when we was doing it?
(Bring it!)

[Below Zero]
I done did it all, baby what can you do for me?
I'm a professional, you made it to the big leagues
Sophisticated, I see ya and your body's right
Little mommy, with those Pilates help this appetite
My hunger's intense, fulfillment is hard to reach
So full, give me the 'itis, put me to sleep
You's a hot tamale, me I seen salami
And my salami goes real good with your pastrami
I want it, you need it, you want it, I got it (trust me)
I'm fly, you fine, but we gon' do something disgusting
Soon as I finish this liquor, this good boy's gon sic 'em
And once I'm gone (brrrr)
It's how stick 'em, stick 'em
My bad, my name's Below, it slipped my mind you didn't know
I'm coming clean by telling you I'm insatiable
(I can tell you want it)
So come over here and get it
And what we 'bout to do, hopefully I haven't did it, baby

[Chorus]

[Krizz Kaliko]
Tech is next up

[Tech N9ne interlude]
Prada was checking you out, Below was checking you out, now I'm checking you out
What you wanna do baby?
Question for you:

[Tech N9ne]
Yo
You ever been eaten up?
To where you be skeetin' nut?
Tech N9na be deep in guts
Sweeping sluts off of their feet and stuff
I'm leaving her leaking, my [week?] and reek it from heating up, queefing, releasing beef, she's in lust, reaching for me to keep in touch
I make the coochie do the watoosie if you the beauty
If you be ugly, me Louis V shoe be to the booty
You do's me, booshy, you choose the groupies and lose the luchie
Slip you the roofie, now she do gucci and Ruby do's D
She bring it to me, because I'm greedy
Insatiable
And what she be giving Techa N9na when he be needy?
Fellatio
When hot water's fire and exciting
Off in my underworld she's gonna find I'm vampire and I like it
Scorpihoes, get her done, keeping many hideaways
At the crib, cabellas, even inside a cave
Banging her, having her like a tidal wave
Night or day, I can go deep missionary
But even deeper side-aways

[Chorus]
[Krizz Kaliko]
It's time for the next cut
