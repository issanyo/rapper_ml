[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Turn it up 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Get off of your lazy ass and do something for the people to make them feel it faster
Don't wanna post [?] I can make 'em feel The Holy Ghost
I can preach the pastor {Electricity}
I'm amazin {[?]}
I was gazing
Say it to the place to release my anger
I'm an angel with a gang of bangers
And I'm not home with a gang of strangers
Never stand still, it's a gang of danger
Gotta pop pills to contain my anger
'Cause if I stay the same, the days are lamer
So I'll rep there to rep yours
I really don't care, but I'm sure
That we can all lose weight, get in shape, maybe even get attractive
Get on up, g-get active!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Let me take you for a long ride
Up and down, in and out
Right around and out of your mind
Get active
Let me take you for a long ride
Up and down, in and out
Right around and out of your mind
Get active
B-b-b-baby! B-b-b-baby!
Get active!
B-b-b-baby! B-b-b-baby!

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Turn it up 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Turn it up 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"

[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]
Pheee-nom! Aaaaah!
Maybe you're gonna be the one to come up and act super cool
Kali hold on, let me break it down and explain the rules
See the women be the kitties [?] see you make your move
[?] do the fool
Get up outta your mind and get super loose
Dudes be coo-coo
Break it off the chain like I'm bad, dawg
Lose the poop chute
Better get to dancing your ass off
Get crunk like Zu-lus
I'm counting down for that blast off
(5-4-3-2-1)
OK, it's on, let's act a ass, y'all!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Let me take you for a long ride
Up and down, in and out
Right around and out of your mind
Get active
Let me take you for a long ride
Up and down, in and out
Right around and out of your mind
Get active
B-b-b-baby! B-b-b-baby!
Get active!
B-b-b-baby! B-b-b-baby!

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Turn it up 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Turn it up 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it 'til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Givin' 'em an anaphylactic shock, your body is overreactin'
Travel the globe and I hope that I don't hit the hole in the road
'Cause if I stay stagnant, then I'mma get backwards
Kick my bad habits, I gotta g-gotta get active!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Let me take you for a long ride
Up and down, in and out
Right around and out of your mind
Get active
Let me take you for a long ride
Up and down, in and out
Right around and out of your mind
Get active
B-b-b-baby! B-b-b-baby!
Get active!
B-b-b-baby! B-b-b-baby!

Turn it up 'til ya...
