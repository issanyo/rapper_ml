[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I once said in a cypher of famous friends back in 2011
"Who do I catch?"
Outside of technicians' tunneled Tech vision
At a point in time when dope is the new whack
So it's safe to say we're in Barney says Cheadle
On the outskirts of our army, we scare people
But it's not for evil, up with hawks and eagles
But I'm lost and feeble wondering if this restarts the needle
Look around, do you spot Tech
In front of seventy thousand at RockFest
By the way he won the crowd does he got next
To infect the mainstream or sell a lot less
God bless my core fans still around
We're here 'cause you held us down
Love the way that you love my sounds
But I'm still try'na break new ground

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Feels like I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing you a song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yes doing this for, yes doing this for, yes doing this for profit
And my pocket's one dimension
I wanna reach so many hearts and souls is my intention
Since 2001 is when I started my ascension
But in 2015 I went up just to get honorable mention
Makes me wanna end it, I get so offended
When they speak of genre breaking but no N9ne is in it
Or friended I'm winded, my music's intrinsic
But it's kinda looking like the needle ain't moving even when I did a killer with Kendrick
Jimmy Kimmel was splendid, four million attended
But when we were done it's like not one of them were mended
Maybe it's my image and large amount of grimness
My pen spits on them scripts
Thinking I'm on a sin trip and then skit
Rock on the range we had 'em flocking for Strange
But it was a shocker when no rockers remained
When it came to the game where they claimed
Fame could get you big as the Beatles
Yeah we got it this far but I really wanna push that needle

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing you a song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Pardon me Lucas
I was blessed to do a song with Marshall Mathers
I was thinking when the emcees hear this they hearts'll shatter
'Cause the art's so radder than babblers with partial chatter
But the garble swagger actors win it all, but this?
Not a chart no ladder, dark so daggered
Why do mega artists do this with me?
Man it make me feel so good when they all really do skip the fee
Slipknot, System Of A Down, Deftones, Doors got a few hits with T
But the one thing that makes me wanna say screw this and flee
Man I did it all this when music is free

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing you a song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Now they gonna say:
"Poor N9ne, please you're fine
'Cause you made it to the Forbes List 'bout at least four times"
But since I wrote my first rhyme it's been war time
To get the masses to see this talent deserves more shine
So this year I sat at my very first Grammys
Me and my partner Travis watching my peers go hammy
I thought about all the awards these folks should hand me
Man I swear I'd disappear if it wasn't for fans and family
