[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me offly rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here


[Verse 2: Danjor]
The show begins, the curtains pull, let's get a little personal, you listen to this verse I dole, about the world that's
Jordan's foe, am I okay? I'll nod but see, behind all of the comedy, life decided to trod on me, shatter my will like pottery, disputes of who has custody, for a kid it sucks to be forced to choose between the ones you love and it was crushing me, constantly being thrown into the thick of it, the desolation, manipulation for information man I was fucking sick of it, now a little older and the world is only colder, adulthood looming closer, rolling over like a boulder, as a kid the possibilities were exponential, but laziness and indecision's wasting my potential, it's why I'm always existential, all this prodding and this poking, I am bloody I am broken, I am losing all my hope and I don't know if I can cope with all the demons that are choking me, they're the only ones holding me, and they are kept alive by all of the tears that are soaking me, the cloud of post traumatic stress disorder hovering over me, after an eternity, I believe I've become one with it, my mountain of problems, have fun with it, Tech, take this beat 'cause I'm done with it
