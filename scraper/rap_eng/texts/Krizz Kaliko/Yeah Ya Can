[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, you can
Yeah, you can
Will you go with me, don't leave me lonely?
Will you go with me, don't leave me lonely?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Would you go with me, baby
If I tell you I can do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Can we get lost mama if I promise
I can break you off tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Would you go with me, baby
If I tell you that I'll do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Can we get lost mama if I promise
I can break you off tonight, say

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Can I holla atcha, yo holla holla?
Can I holla, holla you liking the way
I throw these dollas at you?
They say your kitty cat
Is one hell of a dog catcher
Can I take to my kennel and make it all better?
Can I get you in the parking lot, I mean?
Can I get you out the parking lot
Then we can bend the corner and find a darker spot
Baby can I let the seat back, so I can bark a lot?
Yeah, you can
I see why you at the silver slipper
Cause that ass fat, baby, pass that
Let me smash that, want me jizzum
But I holds 'em back, them courtesy of my player partner
Trojan Magnum, think you pimping your broads
You'll be hold like tagnum first night like I'm mad
I don't know these hoes from Adam
Deep as I'm deep down diamond Joes, I jabbed 'em
Can I come back again and repeat this with you madam?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Would you go with me, baby

[Verse 2: Shadow]
Can I tell you a secret before you get to answer?
Shadow done already peeped it
It's the freak with reason, the ladies wet in they bed
And she'll probably get orgasmic just from giving me head
Can I bring a couple of my closest friends, get a telly
Play some music prolly, throw you some mens?
Oh, you wanna keep me all to myself
You wanna cum a couple times well mami, can I offer some help?
Can I see the way your body look from the back
She shook form the fact that my tongue motions did it like that
Had her walking like she had a camel hump on her back
And since they say we only mammals I'm the king of the cat
And as long as your ass is fat can I give it a smack
And record the whole thing and play it on track
If you telling me you good with that
I'mma handle some things but is it cool
If I come right back?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Would you go with me, baby
If I tell you that I'll do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Can we get lost mama if I promise
That I'll do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Would you go with me, baby
If I tell you that I'll do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Can we get lost mama if I promise
I can do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I know you heard of me baby
I'm one they talk about
They call me Kali Baby
Say it while we walking out
And next let's hit the exit, go get naked
Do them things you know will get you pregnant
Or can it be just a fantasy planned to have you panicking
It's your pantin' that's bringing out the man in me
And I'll be gentle at first
And then frantically I'ma damaged the back-a-you
Attacking where your pants be
And I just want to love you now
Can you tell me how I get you home tonight?
Baby let me turn you 'round, look you up and down
Let me see every part I like
And maybe it's the drink making you look better
Or maybe it's my voice making you get wetter
If you like me like I like you girl
Don't hesitate, don't make me wait, tell me

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Would you go with me, baby
If I tell you I can do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Can we get lost mama if I promise
I can break you off tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Would you go with me, baby
If I tell you I can do you good tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
Can we get lost mama if I promise
I can break you off tonight, say
Yeah, you can?
