[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Whoo, all my ladies all around the world
Get fresh and new dress
To get your man it's the fuck 'em girl
It's Friday night, just got paid
She's lookin' for a little bit of action captain to get saved

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
So you go straight to the mall and call your girlfriend up
Tell her you bought a fuck 'em dress
Nothing less-more-than-a thinner-sinner-Chris Dior fitter
You gotcha hair did or that there wig
Sho a fitter got your own sitter for that there kid
She's goin' out to find a thick stout to out her dig
That dress' fittin' catcher's mitten is out there big
She manicured and pedicured up and lookin' like you wanna
Your man's hittin' your phone up, say fuck 'em if you wanna
Lip gloss is on her blow that mirror a kiss and if your man
Got you stressin' put on your dress and don't listen and sing
I can't wait til I get there, step in the club lookin' player player
Grab your keys and beat it to the spot where you guess you'll
Find you a nigga buyin' a two for one special
Exceptional sexual healin' is what your cravin'
Your man pagin' you, but fuck how he's feelin'

[Hook] (2X)
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em girl, fuck 'em
It's your time to get out
No time for thinkin' of 'em

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Now this is a story, all about how
These chicks get tricked and don't know how
So I'd like to take a second and explain to them
How all this craziness evolves out of relationships, listen
He never used to hit you, he always used to treat you
With some respect and dignity, and now he wanna beat you
Six months done passed and he's changed
You never would have thought he'd be crazy and deranged, huh
Just the way he approached was so sweet
He let you know you was far away from a (Late night creep)
Mister telephone man when he what'nt with you
Bobby Browny and Whitney, you found you a new edition
Right in the beginning it was grinings from the sit down
'Til he let you know that it was all on a bitch now
When, after you had you a baby, he wanna start
Arguing his excuse to start sipping the Remy Mar-
-Tin, darkening this relationship
Now every lady grab your bics if you relate to this
You need to get up out those drawers
And put on some lip gloss, throw on a thong
Now make your way to the closet and

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Feel like I was put here for the female species
Hella listening watching whispering offerings no feces
When the back is obese we double back and go deeply
In her life in her mind never hate but'll go extra time if need be
Easy for me to connect so peep me
In the club I take her some place we can talk discretely
You're creep free definitely that heats me
Your body's wop bobba lu bop so hot baby teach me
How to get up inside it ride it, chakras are now ignited
That's a beautiful smile, don't hide it
Getting Tech the N9ne excited
Stress free I bet she so Nestle
Wanna know how wicked the sex be don't test me
Drink your drink eat your cherry and tie the stem
This is your world mommy ain't said a damn thing about him
