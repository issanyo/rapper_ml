[Intro]
Oh what's the matter baby? You don't want me to be honest?

[Hook]
I got a eye for ol' girl but I'm supposed to be faithful
Short miniskirt and she showing off her navel
Try to be good I'm unable, my eyes are like (hello,hello)
Caught a few times, swept it all under the table
One woman man, but I still keep it stable
Try to be good I'm unable, my eyes are like (hello,hello)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm just like every other man
Some things we do I can't stand
I try to be that other man, but every time they pass I do a kickstand
Wedding bands on her hands and we faithful
Or we do it under the table
I used to tell my sister April, niggas'll never get right we unable
Sometimes I feel like we not'posed to be platonic, girl you looking good but you putting extras on it
Got your hair all done up at the gym, know he got a baby mama, but she wanting him
Acting like you working but you flirting on the sly, baby got the type of body that you hardly get to try,this my set, check out my breath and made my approach, I said you got a good team baby you need a new coach

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What you look at me for?
Have I seen you before?
I went to school with you and your sister
We played spin the bottle and I think I kissed her
Used to put a nigga in the friend zone, dating on a supersport, got me in the end zone, hate that I don't look the part, my face I can't depend on, but daddy left some cake to get the whip and put some rims on
April's baby daddy hooked my beat up, shook the block a lot
Now ain't gotta plot the twat, at lights I stop and [???]
Cause her friend was tryna put me in the weed business, meet me up at Rossy's house dump a ounce and revisit
But I was way too busy tryna get a blind date, Tryna bust that cherry open like Sonic do lime-aid
Couldn't quit it, got committed quickly, now my boys is going to strip clubs and my girls tryna go with em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She told me that she really leaving me
Don't like how I treat her and he cheat on me
I told I could replace her so easily
I don't mean it but she keeping me off also
I'm with my girly but I'm staring at the waitress
She ain't got no hair done, outfit looking tasteless
But her waist can fit a bracelet like vanilla if I taste it
You want some twisted up face shit, make me question who I came with

[Hook]
