[Hook]
Tell me you love me
Yes I do Yes I do Yes I do
Tell me you need me
Yes I do Yes I do Yes I do
Tell me you want me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do
Tell me you need me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do

[Verse 1]
My son was born on 6/6/06
Maybe a sign to get my mind back on the crucifix
And get back in the church
And it hurts in the meantime
So im drinking daily for skirts make a b-line
You find yourself searching for me time
An extra sexual
Home alone and shes right next to you
When your in trouble it a double liped sword
That'll get ya, split ya
Crack open the bottle and let it hit ya

[Hook]
Tell me you love me
Yes I do Yes I do Yes I do
Tell me you need me
Yes I do Yes I do Yes I do
Tell me you want me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do
Tell me you need me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now
Im only as lonely as i want to be
A million miles on the road
A million women in front of me (and you can have us all)
Wifey's at home what she don't know won't hurt her (Wrong)
Any killer and ill be the infidelity dealer
You'll find that earth girls are easy
And eager to please
Easy to ease on her knees to freak me
And damn i messed up
Cause now shes in her 3rd trimester and I've gotta fess up

[Hook]
Tell me you love me
Yes I do Yes I do Yes I do
Tell me you need me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do
Tell me you want me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do
Tell me you need me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do

[Verse 3]
For the foot up im trynna shoot up to the top
And its true love ive got for the luda
Pimpus music pop
And im tring to give my son the best of it all
Yes im blessed with a check and yet no extra to ball
You find that your ends dont meet if you dont move your feet
And get back in the street life
What is the way to survive and way to feed the need for greed in this life

[Hook]
Tell me you love me
Yes I do Yes I do Yes I do
Tell me you need me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do
Tell me you want me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do
Tell me you need me
Yes I do yes I do yes I do

[Verse 4]
Bless my soul lord when i lose control
And i can't get ahold of it
And i can't run from it cause where i go it follows
So lay me down to sleep and ill be better off tomorrow
Take one last trip cause this pills off to swallow

[Outro]
Tell me you love me
(you know you want me)
