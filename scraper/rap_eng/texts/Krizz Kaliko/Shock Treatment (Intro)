[feat. Tech N9ne]
[Female:] let's play a game of simon says!?

[Chorus:]
{Put your hands up like your get held up
Make a lot of noise like your getting felt up
We gettin money there ain't nothing you can tell us
Do it! Only when I say so. only when I Say
Simon says
Put your hands up like your get held up
Make a lot of noise like your getting felt up
We gettin money there ain't nothing you can tell us
Do it! Only when I say so. only when I Say}
Kali baby in the building baby talk about it
Heads too big ain't no room to walk around it
I'm off in the clouds, I can't be humble, can't be grounded
When you see the king kneal to the ground, make a fist and pound it
Follow me like I'm your new leader, school teacher
I'm the head coach and you the cheerledaer, in a school bleacher
Me and Tech like the double creature feature
Heat ya up shitting on you niggas
Damn we leave the seat up [?]
Posted on the throne with my feet up
I'm Tee'd off, cause T9 dun drank the KC tea up (oh man)
So how low can you go
Nobody make a move until SIMON says so

[Chorus]
[Tech N9ne:]
Only when I say so, only when I Say
That some polturgiese lingo that was put on me in my day
When my money was in my A
When my homies were in my way
Now these ronees [?] attend my showees
And thier wanting to spend my pay (HEY!)
Simon Says
Go snow
Let these hoes know
Without no, oh-oh, better get steppin they get no doe
But slow grow make a bro grow, here go the mojo
(Bounce) (pogo pogo) up, down
Till it's rojo
Your gunna have to listen to Tech Nina to rhyme his dance
To the diamond encrusted snake and the bat with a diamond hand
You'd rather be spending your time in better gi-mer stad [?]
But the N9nes and SIMON says you'd better do what ever the fuck!
SIMON says
[Krizz Kaliko:]
Stand at attention to your heiness
Comin for your heiness when niggas be way behind us
Strange music if you can't find us, you got on blindness
Steady mutiplying your money be in the minus (ok?)
Follow me like religously, bitches be
Chocolatey, pop-top-ly, rich and have a Bentaly
Mentally fly as an eagle, oh I think they like me, distorting my ego (kali-Baby)
Fans do what I command them
Rapper's don't talk to me
Tell em I can't stand em and umm?
If your hands still in the air wave em like you don't care. and you can swear by my anthem

[Chorus]
