[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Yeah so, since I was 10 years older then her she tried to give me that "Coming to America" spiel. You know what I'm saying? Like "Some guys put in an hour. Some of 'em even an hour and a half. But a man gotta put in overtime for me to get off." Ha ha

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Work it baby
I'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby
Put a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby
All the time
Clock out, clock in for overtime

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
If you think we 'bout to go to sleep - forget about it
You really doubt it, though we can make the synergys link
In the middle of the night I'm fixin' to enter the pink
Never the one to be stingy. I leave my dinner, she winks
'Cause she think she got me and her percentage be Brink's
But I'mma stick it without a ticket in the tender she thinks
Suck me up then I can become her energy drink
And that's what she gon' need
Punching the clock, I'm not gonna be done on three
Baby you probably wanna kick it and get her done on E
But you ever have steamy sexual fun on weed?
So I told her nein! No I don't look like it but I'm the older kind
But that don't mean I'mma stick it, n' quit it, forget it
Because tonight I'm 'bout to get it in overtime

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Work it baby
I'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby
Put a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby
All the time
Clock out, clock in for overtime

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Lovin' your body, lovin' your pace
Love it when you maneuver your body off in my space
And weather the chase, and have your body off in the daze
And could you feel the hormones, they off the rage
Now check it - let me take a little dose of the page
I'm hittin' for hours and hours, hours hours and days
All the positions I'm feelin' real kinky today
I've waited to play my trombone, have a parade (have a parade)
Kitty kitty kitty kitty c'mere
Well there's a couple little things I wanna say in ya ear
I'm shiftin' gears, love it when I strike the wheel
Stevie Stone in the bed I'mma flip for real!
Baby girl I'm a freak for real
A little too much tongue got me head over heels
Wetter the chill
Head shot, ready to kill
Ready to deal, head rock, watch what you will

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Work it baby
I'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby
Put a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby
All the time
Clock out, clock in for overtime

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Baby, baby, gave me a job and I love it
I know you be lovin' the way I throb when you hug it
When I got the poonini I thought the job really was it
Before the poonini you take the job and you shove it
Feel like a nigga makin' love when I does it
On the clock I won't stop and when it buzz I'mma plug it
Good enough for me to be your husband in public
You really be wantin' to pack a stud in your luggage

[Stevie Stone]
Ah, pack a stud in your luggage
Break down baby, Stone gonna love it
While we bangin' make a nigga wanna love it
Make me wanna snatch it
See to it girlie, ha
It's one of a kind
You bring the girls and I'm comin' with the n9ne
Spread them legs and open wide
Give you that overtime

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Work it baby
I'mma give you extra, you deserve it baby
Put a star next to you 'cause you're perfect baby
All the time
Clock out, clock in for overtime
