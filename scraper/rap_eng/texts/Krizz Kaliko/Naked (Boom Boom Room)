It's time to get naked!
You don't wanna be in that top
The room burning ya know that it's hot
It's time to get naked!
You ain't gotta be in them jeans
Take 'em off, make sure that it's clean
It's time to get naked!
When I tell ya give it to me, give it to me (give it to me)
Thirsty; ya looking like the liquor to me
Naked!
Even if ya ain't that cute
Strip down to ya birthday suit
It's time to get naked!

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Hello, and welcome to Club Raze
The Boom Boom Room, where negligence don't pay
See a body, get on a body it's okay
Be proactive, you can just treat it like marmalade
So preserve ya sexy and rip the rind off
Everybody up in this bitch getting they grind on
And you all in the corner like you sniffed the Nitol
Somebody better check his vitals, cause all I see is:
Big hips, big ass, tits and eyeballs
Looking for a dick to slide on
Waiting to saddle up and ride on: a Clydesdale thug
And a couple of niggas with they iPhones
Partying getting FUCKED UP!
So join the festivities
The more pussy off in the room the less enemies
We about to act a baphoon, the sex energy'll
Literally shoot the roof and...

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
She showing off, we ain't throwing nah
But if she get naked we break it then she going huh?
To the pad, to get drunk and be bad
Now her boyfriend mad cause when he got it, it was worn huh?
At the video, had a pretty ho giddy
I'm witty plus she know I do music like Livio
Show me tig ol' bitties and yes a little bitty ol'
Waist but her face was looking funny like Arsenio
So I shook the spot, as I booked and got
With a Amazon chick that look'd-ed hot
King Magazine, Queen straight from Brooklyn hah
What I gotta do to get through her Apple Bottoms and get in that
BOX! Shine Malco said it was basic
Eat then watch 'Black Dynamite' and get wasted
Then if she like ya Strange chain, watch and ya bracelet
You can prob'ly taste it, Yates is in the place to get...

[Bridge: Kutt Calhoun]
There's a party planned
Where the naked women dance
There's a hole in the wall
Where the men can see it all
It's time to get naked!

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Like you're in a nudist colony
You're new? Just follow me
Your new Sickology...
(Makes it!)
Easier for you to market it
But soon no mattering
How cute yo body be...
(Take it!)
Off, then take you down
To a basic squat, then shake it 'round
'Til you make it start, to quake the ground
'Til the earth break mommy, you're safe and sound
You are now officially groomed and whom soon
To be a valid member of the Boom Boom Room
Now it's time to play monkey-see, monkey-do
And pretend that you're on your honeymoon...
