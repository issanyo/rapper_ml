[Hook: Jess Hurley]
You can't pretend, you already caved in to the other side
Arms stretched out wide; you can't run, you can't hide from the other side
You can't return, your soul already burns on the other side
You can't resist, you don't even exist on the other side

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'mma be never ready to die 'cause I'm gonna live forever but haters steady deny
When I say that I'm the greatest I get a petty reply when they should be in agreeance with the killer deadly as I, Tecca Nina
Checkin' em so fast, they watching me blow past
The competition I'm ripping them up and they told Tech
The opposition they wishing
I get a flow flack for popping this when I'm kicking, they walk up with no class
So another died, stupidly trying to go with the Nina I kill 'em and their mother cried
Michael Myers making her cut her ties
Gutter guys, eat your food up and giggle if he suckerfied
Everything I do it, thugger-wide
Super audible making it so impossible to shut her thighs
Look at me with lover eyes
When I spit it she with it she wanna get into the choppa sides
I am what butter buys
Sensational scripted seeking Satan's suffers high
So many come gunning for the soldier but death is what I showed ya
Man even the tougher tried
I am a Mel Gibson and Denny Glover Ride
Lethal weapon like an evil reverend you can keep your jeffin' on the other side

[Hook: Jess Hurley]
You can't pretend, you already caved in to the other side
Arms stretched out wide; you can't run, you can't hide from the other side
You can't return, your soul already burns on the other side
You can't resist, you don't even exist on the other side

[Verse 2: Teri Legato]
Got a lot to do, guess I'm feeling pretty anxious
Paid a lot of dues to be laying up on fake shit
Just a bad bitch running game to this English
New to this game I found my way and so I feed this
Found peace in my soul when I turned strange
Since ten my a pen don't kill pain
Dark vibes telling me avoid flames
While the paper boy's feeling to escape
Evil seas [?]
Dark sides stepped in couldn't feel hot
Kiss my soul goodbye
And hearing angels cry
Open up the sky, dark Grim tried
Heartbeat raised high but my veins bleed
Falling flat on my face on the concrete
Other side of my door keeps knocking
Looking for the light in the dark, please stop me
Picture dark nights with the angels lying
Feel my black wings, I'm a soul be flying
Running from the truth, fallacy be hiding
Loving all the used prophecies subsiding
Daughter from a pastor's son of a bastard
Burning all the souls hearing purgatory's laughter
[?] and you screaming wild
Like you don't exist on The Other Side

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Just picture dark nights when the angels cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Just picture dark nights when the angels cry

[Hook: Jess Hurley]
You can't pretend, you already caved in to the other side
Arms stretched out wide; you can't run, you can't hide from the other side
You can't return, your soul already burns on the other side
You can't resist, you don't even exist on the other side

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
It's a lot of beauty, journey into my beautiful darkness
I let [?] what they did to me off of my beautiful darkness
It's kinda vicious, malicious, a shame what they did to that boy
And now they visit the venues, and digits they give you will buy you your toys
And on the account of my ob-stacles
Beauty gets nude to me only if you will get new with me
But ya refuting me and Strange Music rebooting me
Has taken like glue to me and putting me where the Buddha be
The opportunity knocks I know they hear me busta fluently, or soon to be pop
I get diplomatic immunity as soon as he drop
And everybody in the room that make a fool of me stop
Rock it, not get tipsy off this flocket
Tryna' get lifted, check my pocket
Got that Nino watch make profit
Let it go!
See there's levels to this
[?] and the side that I'm on, ain't no devils in this
Even sayin' that Tech take no medals in this
On the other side I guess I'll settle for this

[Hook: Jess Hurley]
You can't pretend, you already caved in to the other side
Arms stretched out wide; you can't run, you can't hide from the other side
You can't return, your soul already burns on the other side
You can't resist, you don't even exist on the other side

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
See it's that other side, no one can take it there
Nowhere to run and hide, people don't even dare
Me and you, you are nothing the same
I live on the other side and that's where I'm gonna stay

[Hook: Jess Hurley]
You can't pretend, you already caved in to the other side
Arms stretched out wide; you can't run, you can't hide from the other side
You can't return, your soul already burns on the other side
You can't resist, you don't even exist on the other side
