[Intro: C-Mob]
Music...
So many people listen to music
To try to find peace of mind
But for the real artist
Who create the music
Sometime we got to give you piece of our mind
In order for us to find peace of mind
So while we try to master
Peace within our mind
We end up, creating, a masterpiece with our minds

[Verse 1: C-Mob]
Ever since the age of 12, 1994 that's when I would start out
Had a hard route
So I learned to grab the pen and pad and I write my heart out
Just a bad little adolescent
I was pretty nerdy but I leave your grill split fast
Forward to the presence, 20 years later in my 30's and I kill shit
Came a long way, long days, blew it then a fifth of bombay
But I'm not new to this, I am Vesuvius
These other rappers, they are Pompeii
Like Dante in my Inferno they will be stucked, when I erupt
So these other rappers better ease up
Pumping their guns, rather be fucked
See, music supposed to be an outlet
For the real ones to be devout with
But nowadays every wants to be a rapper
When they ain't about shit
Making music's how I keep my sanity
While these other cats spit vanity
And they treat the fans like shit
But I don't have fans, I got family
And I try to find a way to deal that
All the real cats, they can feel that
I've been lookin' through the glass too long
Banging on it, hopin' that it will crack
You can kill that, nonsense sayin' that I'll never make it
I've already made it, further than they thought I ever make it
And I'm workin' so that I can elevate it

[Verse 2: Charlie Ray]
C-Mob I was thinkin' (what up?)
We gotta give 'em somethin' that'll make 'em listen up
If they will give a fuck about what they were doin'
For what they're pursuin', I would give a fuck
I would surely go and get your CD
I ain't talkin' iTunes, I would go to bestbuy
Just so I could rip the plastic off
And see who took the credit for what made my head nod
But none of you rap niggas are comin' with acid any longer
See like I'm  only supposed to come with spits
The quicker the massacre, deliver it faster to the father
See I choke the throat up out you bitch-es
I got no love for you hood rats and your hood raps
And your tall  tales, that you're tellin', bust 'em like a melon
Better watch 'em all fail, I am troubled in the brain
I don't care as long as y'all are entertained
I can hide the pain in the music, and I'm finna use it
That's the spark I need to light the propane
Let 'em burn how I do in agony
Like everyday I try to make a masterpiece
The only way that I can get it out of me
So I don't lose it, snap and cause a tragedy
So let me be, and leave me to my devices and my vices
Wallow to provice, while I try to keep my nose clean
So my son and I can start enjoyin' life
And for him? Ignore the price
Never money over blood, never let 'em up
Keep the competition in the vice
Winnin' everytime I roll
Blow the dice (Ahh)

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
And when I see 'em in the front row
I'll never disappoint when I'm knowin'
And every fan that know me
Know more than they need to know and
Can it be, that they dancin' for me and
That they see themselves in me and can't ignore it
So I put end to this, whenever my brains admits to spits
And I will krizz about
And if the rain persists, I'm filckin' the wrist and change it when the veins are drippin' out
Everybody only got a few hundred ones, a few hundred blunts to
Smoking like I only got a few hundred months to live
Tell 'em that the truth got to be talked
Never switch over and put the more hold
Know I can't stop till I'm old
Made a monster of Kali who broke the mold
We get our eye poked, say a few words, you'll get your eye opened
When your words wise spoken
You might have to eat your ego when I'm hopin'
That you'll get it often, people receive you never take a loss
When you take it off and you get your cheese up
And you become a boss
Seem all I can get my dreams y'all get my seem hard
So put your money on me and C-Mob

[Verse 4: C-Mob]
So friends, Romans, countrymen, tell me can you lend me an ear
People talkin' alot of shit when we're not around
But they quiet when we appear
Sick of this bullshit that they call the rap game
Dealin' with these dumb fucks
Cause they lie scheme and they're unjust
But you're clamin' that their guns bust
I've been giving it all I've got
Put my heart and soul in for the last 10 years
I've been here, stay in-gear, sincere, even when the flames clear
See I'm tryin' make a better livin' for my family
Therefore my music has to be the grind
Cash for me and mine, laugh and be sublime
That would be divine, has to be the time
Actually deprimed, that I make a come up
Cause I'm battling this apathy of mine
See my mind's a masterpiece
But at the same time I'm tryin' to masterpiece of mind
Jerky record labels, asking me for signs
Sorry but your offer has to be declined
Better come correct, or don't come at all
Cause your jaw will be vastly realigned
Then I think about why I started music for the love
I remember that, so I cut the bullshit
Thrill the fact, with the pen and pad I will fin attack
Got it down packed, this is my soundtrack
Never listen to the he say, this is my world
I'm the DJ, claim my mind while I let the beat play
Like

[Instrumental]
