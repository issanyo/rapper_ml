First entry to Everready: The Religion
It's called "In My Head." It's dedicated to my Marine homeboys, Foxes
Second battalion, fifth regiment, like this...

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
A lot of talent a chemical imbalance and MDMA (MDMA)
I can't reroute it so people they hear 'bout it and tend to turn away (tend to turn away)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Kinetic you bet it's somethin' movin' your head it's prophetic
So get it embeded let it control your bodily
Close to lettuce my head is far from synthetic
You credit this vet is poetic that is merely a part of me
The other part it be wicked similar to psychotic
We kick it we frolic sickness neurotic fought at the God in me
Mixed with erotic on top of Hennessy and Hpnotiq
You got it a solid sub-savage knowing not of comradery
Don't want kill ya (somethin' in my head)
Is makin' me done deal ya (somethin' in my head)
Is making the gun fill ya (somethin' in my head)
Is makin' me want drill ya, can we get familiar?
Check, always fantasizing on gettin' sex
Wettin' that and settin' Tech up on you carressin' breast
Sweatin' that you'd get me vexed and not get your second breath
Stressed you would've been left where you was beckoned at we neck and neck

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
The place where I have no relaxation
Is in my head
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
Liberate me Lord devastation
Is in my head

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I keep that one that'll heat ya, so you better like run better seat ya
Might get found under the bleachers, no one'll reach ya come to the creature
'Cause in my head is a hole, dark and deep and it grows
Actually capital G-O-D have mercy on my soul
I'm sick as I wanna be, get the hell up from front of me
When I spit at everybody yeah they gonna be feeling this for eternity
Boss many thoughts pretty lost but I cost plenty sauce
Soft killa crossed me tossed put 'em off in the moss
Respect my mind everyone (somethin' in my head)
Says if he disrespect N9ne then he done (somethin' in my head)
Wish as I could put the nine on his tongue, (somethin' in my head)
Says ignoramus you too famous for that to be done son
Stuck 'cause I can't trust his bluff must
Clutch bust (hush hold up enough)
Woosa goosfraba makes you holla
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
The place where I have no relaxation
Is in my head
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
Liberate me Lord devastation
Is in my head

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Some people joke and say me loco
Throw evil quotes but yo they don't know
Doctor don't know, so he won't go
In my head it's like I said I mean I'm oh so
Full of decay and MDMA
Sin we in way deep off in the end like many men say
Slaughter you pay, he told me that you gotta today
Allah hu A.K.B.A.R. with a Auda Dufe'
In my head, in my brain, dead am I?
Will I shed a cry when they red Ninna
You might red Ninna, but never dead Ninna
But if you bled Ninna, then you's a dead nigga!
Yo, I feel it you feel it, can we heal it? The devil's encephal
We rebels get it level no matter what it becomes
With the heavy metal impatiently wait with a shovel
For the wedos who hate the negros, I think I'm losing my Lithium

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Super savage erratic you don't say such an attic combative you don't say sick his status so there's no Beyonces there's no hope for Dontez

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
The place where I have no relaxation, is in my head
Everyone want go heaven
But nobody want dead
Liberate me Lord devastation
Is in my head
