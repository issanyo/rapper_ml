[Hook: Stige]
I ain't too cool to say I'm sorry
Too proud to dance at your party
Too good to sin on a Sunday
And we go up and down these peaks and valleys
From Miami out to Cali
Doing all the wrong things the right way
Heyyyyy! Ohhhhh! (x4)
Hey!

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Last night I almost died, woke up on Sunday morning
Didn't know where I was, and if I heard you calling
Maybe my soul departed soon as the party started
Dance with the fallen angels, drink with the local shaman
Ignored advice and guidance, and mixed with the outsiders
Stuck in the world between some spirits and the corporate buyers
Hope that they never find us, and can't afford to promise
Eternal life to all us, and flicking off their alma matters
Ask me and I'll jump to, come grab me and I'll come through
Forgive me when I hurt you, and don't judge me for my virtues
All of my issues are just fuel to spend my life out past my curfews
So I'm saving all my sins for a Sunday that I can work through

[Hook: Stige]
I ain't too cool to say I'm sorry
Too proud to dance at your party
Too good to sin on a Sunday
And we go up and down these peaks and valleys
From Miami out to Cali
Doing all the wrong things the right way
Heyyyyy! Ohhhhh! (x4)
Hey!

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Hey!
I'm a bad, bad boy
Never thought they would be loving the fat boy
But they had to employ me
Let the people enjoy me
Could've crumbled, said "Poor me"
Bitches never adored me
They ain't stop shit
Let me sing to 'em a little bit like an option
Spit a winner in the middle of a map
And I'm trying to get the same thing as King James, stream same
See every time I leave, she let's me go
And I gotta leave to get these hoes
They really wanna believe I'm at these hoes
Loving the way I'm sneaking at these shows
So let the church boy sing out
Trying to hang out
With no groupie hoes to bang out
Affiliated but I ain't trying to pull my thing out
Out of town, out of bounds, so shots won't ring out
Sorta like you bad at doin' good good, good at doing bad things
Puffin' on the loud, blowing smoke rings
We gon' be alright
Cause when the weekend comes, we doin' the same old shit tonight

[Hook: Stige]
I ain't too cool to say I'm sorry
Too proud to dance at your party
Too good to sin on a Sunday
And we go up and down these peaks and valleys
From Miami out to Cali
Doing all the wrong things the right way
Heyyyyy! Ohhhhh! (x4)
Hey!

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Strange Music!
