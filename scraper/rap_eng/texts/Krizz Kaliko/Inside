Do exactly what I tell you to
Drop on the floor

I wanna love you from the inside, inside
And we can get closer and closer
Love me on the outside, outside
And we'll do it over and over

When you move
It's almost violent - her attitude
Ooh
And when you breathe
It's like you're breathing life into me

If I had to choose the way that I die

I wanna love you from the inside, inside
And we can get closer and closer

Because I never touched you
But I'd like to

[Hook:]
I wanna love you from the inside, inside
And we can get closer and closer
Love me on the outside, outside
And we'll do it over and over
