[Intro: Tech N9ne]
EST is 1985 in KC on a bus ride from the 56th side
Not too many knew that it was alive
But they spread it so now they tied to Technicians worldwide

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Listen!
Trying to recruit is the mission, we offer you a position
Where Tech'll rule and condition your brain
To know actin' a fool is the vision, Caribou Lou is tradition
And the way to be true to your living is strange
We come in peace, but if you wanna be dumb and beef
A gun'll summon heat, wanna be young and speak, I'ma numb his beak
He's a woman, he the one and, he brung in meat for the cunning beast
Hit a lung and seep dung and sleep long, in deep tongue full of gum and teeth
It's when a Tecca-nician do the sets who diss the crew
The best thing is for you to let the clique see who the vet is amidst the new seekers
Wonderin' who the fuck is coming through these speakers
Never forget it the medic for you tweakers
Ahead of the medicine developed to soothe creatures
You're pathetic if you're no believer, 'cause we all are energetic and eager
Come alive when you walking side by side with me
Fly the skies and get high with me
On this ride you won't collide, just confide in me
Try denying me, ye dying violently
That's the way, you fakers got to pay
My people quick to spray, and buck a demon 'til they lay
But if he breathing it must've been an angel by his side like Sade
Never would've been the case, because my clique ready to ride when I say:

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Technicians!
Owoh! Owoh! Owoh!
Others ain't got a clue, they coming through suspicious
We do the shit we do
'Cause if you not with the crew converting you is our mission
If you're a born Technician
Put your ammunition and your hands up in the sky
This is a strong addiction
Live to this if ya Technician 'til ya die

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
My people all know what a Bianca is
Most of 'em want to diss
Don't come unless you don't want the biz
It ain't nothin' but real women in my circle, not them phony chicks
That don't know what I mean when I say elbow macaroni bitch
They know what I'm drinking, the ladies looking right, they know what I'm thinking
The babies even hype, the oldies be geekin'
The red, the black, and white, the soldiers beef seekin'
All of my people's here, Tech and the bidness are gonna equal fear
'Cause I'm 'bout to bubble and get the evil peers
Out of my life I never wanna see you here (Yeah!)
Bitch! You ain't a Technician
You don't know the pledge, but you said that you listen
Guess you misunderstood the shit, huh?
Disrespect that Tech trick get done
The moral of the story is we warriors
Notorious for the hordes of core, ready to roar he is glorious
Technician number one
The Mission leave 'em sprung with the tongue
And if you listen it's a gun

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Technicians!
Owoh! Owoh! Owoh!
Others ain't got a clue, they coming through suspicious
We do the shit we do
'Cause if you not with the crew converting you is our mission
If you're a born Technician
Put your ammunition and your hands up in the sky
This is a strong addiction
Live to this if ya Technician 'til ya die

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
We are family, that Tech shit we on it
We could be damaging to all you punks that want it
We bring calamity, that snake and bat we flaunt it
Unforgettable, Tech's formidable, reppin' the mid, the MO
Bitch we run it
You don't gotta know that I really meant it when I said that I was gonna make the mainstream go me
Still rapping like I'm popping a pillow off of the killer more like I was taking Molly in '03
We can take anybody, we so deep, I bet that you got us on yo' street
I'm tryna find a spot that's big enough, so that all of my people can meet!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Technicians!
Owoh! Owoh! Owoh!
Others ain't got a clue, they coming through suspicious
We do the shit we do
'Cause if you not with the crew converting you is our mission
If you're a born Technician
Put your ammunition and your hands up in the sky
This is a strong addiction
Live to this if ya Technician 'til ya die
