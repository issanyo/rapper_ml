[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Aw shit, Aw fuck
Me, Kali and Ces we go to get bucks
On the path but didn't think we'd get stuck
By some crass lads that's 'bout to get tough
And they play not, temperatures stay hot
And don't nobody be relaxin' when on they block
Like it a yay spot, never let that pay stop
Unless you wanna be trippin' with Kutty and Jay Rock

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
Bad Flames, Feature Presentation, Raw and UnKutt
All of 'em undeniable classics like who they come from
Most talked about on the internet
Nigga I been a vet
Eleven years strong, still holdin' on
And I ain't finished yet
Red headed-est step child
It's a plague spread to accept how it is
Wanna see me fall get me out the loot
When all I've done is respect how it is
Now I gotta turn into a nigga you once knew
No mo' papers off
Probation I'm a cold case
He gon' sho hate it
When I throw a bomb like Troy Aikman
To do damage you walk in a bunch huh?
When you niggas are really the punks huh?
In the hearts of men, I'm seeing cowards
Where you niggas is at when the funk come?
Smoke a blunt to that
When the funk ensues you resort to rap
Said you was all in, 2 on the 10 you must distort the facts
So I pledge allegiance to only me I only breathe
Eat to shit, the chrome's in me [probably wrong]
The only misconstrued message in the song you see
Is it's not arrogance, this is what it's grown to be

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See you can tell be the way that I use my wealth I'm cocky
This the man right chyea as to ya'll out south I'm cocky
And if you ain't figured out what we talkin' about
I'm the one they all talkin' about
And if they hatin' me that only mean my name in they mouth I'm cocky

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Pull up to the spot, watch the girls all pause
Like a dirty ass dog house, drawers gon' fall
Bitches get wet when they see that candy paint
Suck yo dick through them boxers 'cuz you got bank
Shout out to them shot callers, niggas got rank
Death to you snitches singin' like Drake
I'm all the way silent, I will never break
Pillow talking to them hoes, you all the way gay
The problem is niggas never know they place
Just know your role, play your part and you'll be straight
But niggas crooked like Deebo eye
And could never ever see why we so fly
You either gotta go home or go hard
Keep a bad bitch with a good job and good jaw
Black strap on me, yeah you can tell when I walk
Pitbull of the leash if you flinch I'mma bark

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
You thought we through
Stop the bull talk
We rule papi
Smooth
Knock these fools off me
Boo sloppy
How I have they bitches bukakke
Move awfully cool hotty
Slob these jewels softly
Who's naughty?
Shock exudes bossy
Dude's cocky
Soowoo got me blue blocky
When I do shop
At the woowop
I bought the boo jockey
My Gucc watch
Perfuse rocks
And I be loose of the Caribou Lou
Mami your poonani
Saw me and got tsunami
Tech's elated I'm rated
They say the greatest
Paraded my latest
Pages I created
And the news shot me
That's why I'm hated
You faggots is weak and dated
When I spray this place and do away
With this fakin' then erase it who'd stop me?
It is evident, that you wonder why and where her cheddar went
That look on your face I'm seeing I'd rather get
When your boo prop me
I'm a sedative
Cuz I beat it repetitive
Used twat be
All in ya mouth and you never knew Charlie

[Hook : Krizz Kaliko x2]
