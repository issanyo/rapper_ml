[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me offly rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: SplytSecond]
Layin' awake at night and I'm hearin' a voice as it sings
When the flame is alight, drum is bangin' upright
Feel the pain and the strife from the poisonous stings
Could you even imagine the vertigo caused by the body of the blackest young boy as it swings
From the branches of trees to the joy of the kings, so when I cock it back and let it go
I destroy everythin', you can see the reason that I can't squeeze
Or escape these insane dreams that plague me
Hate speech, taint teens, make they're cerebellum stop
Spinnin' at a temperature that makes teeth chatter, now that's a brain freeze
Inside of my mind, I'm dubious, throw me in a bucket full of acid to liquify me and put me in a needle is the only way you could ever shoot me up
'cause I, am built like a warrior plagued, with guilt and dysphoria, but we will be victorious, that will be our story
But indeed we have yet seen that I really need be healthy, so that when I'm knee deep in the sea
It'll never leave me empty, so then, when I am bleedin'
Then they wanna feed me with a lotta free BMT
Look into my face, you will see I'm nothin' but another case of the PTSD
