[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one that I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in Iraq, hold, I'ma drop those sins
In a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
My hurt, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I grow leaf to chief

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'm thinkin' about my lady, is she doin' something shady?
Like havin' dudes around my baby, situations got me crazy
Brainiac in subjects, but a maniac in public
Where they train me at is insane we sat with no zany act
We in thuggish - mode, feelin' my love is - cold
In about a minute I'ma flip my top, gonna watch my mug ex-plode
What I need right now from a lady is a kiss and a hug at -shows
Got a grudge, it - holds
God bless my rugged - soul
But I got it, I'm stable, I'm for real I'm willin' and able
Got you feelin' I'm ill and I'm crazed go
Get the manic depressant pill on the table
What'll keep me cool is a good birthday for my baby girl
'Till that time I'm dealin' with my mind and trippin' up with the crime in this crazy world

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

[Verse 3: Jay Trilogy]
Look in my eyes
You can probably see the crazy feats of danger that I've survived
Don't wanna relive 'em
If you make me, then I get livid
I might just go commit a crime
I can feel 'em starin' at me all crazy
Like they don't understand what I be s-sayin'
But you ain't seen death
Man I been awake for seven days and I just cannot stop shakin'
So now I'm bout to take another shot and try to battle all my demons, can't let em win
I'ma take a semi automic into my dream and pop shots until they all drop to the end
And that was goin fine
Until I had a small flashback and they all started risin' from the dead
And now they start to double and double, and this shit's overwhelming but I gotta find a exit quick
My psychiatrist told me I ain't got no hope
I ain't got no pills that I can pop to cope
Just need to buckle down, and try to battle it out
And try to dodge the shit that they about to throw
I know I put in the hours
But it still feels like I got a loose grip on my skill set
But fuck it
I know I gotta get a grip on my head if I'm really bout to do this
All or nothin' man I gotta give it all I got
One shot gotta make this shit count I'm on the clock
Watch, my shit tockin'
Sweat drippin' from the top of my head fallin' to my eyes, so God
Please help me do my best
Then pop, there's a hole in my bullet-proof vest
Shot to the chest man, I'm runnin' out of breath
But I can't leave this world till I lay this shit to rest, ahh!
