[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Get out your seat
Stand on your feet
And make some noise
For your Kansas Jayhawks

[Hook]
Game on (Game on)
Game on (Game on)
Game on (Game on)
Game on (Game on)
I'm screaming Rock Chalk Jayhawk (Rock Chalk Jayhawk)
I'm screaming Rock Chalk Jayhawk (Rock Chalk Jayhawk)

[Verse 1]
On your feet, out your seat, yeah you
Rock Chalk, Jayhawk, KU
Opponents scared, man what you gonna do
Kings of the Big 12 coming through
We're the kings, top seeded, crush 'em all, defeated
Got the heart of a champion, blue and red, we'll bleed 'em
We're competent, not cocky, so please don't call it conceited
You want to be the kings? I suggest that you beat 'em, then
Players focused [?] on the sideline
Allen Fieldhouse, going wild when it's game time
Right to the left, fists pumping, arms swinging
"Go KU"'s the only thing that we're singing

[Hook]x2

[Verse 2]
Lights, camera, action, about to act a fool with it
Half court track me, ain't nothing you can do with it
Caught on the field, brain on teal
About to eat your defense up like a meal
My opponent's not a factor, my adversaries mediocre
I'm a send 'em packing, I ain't stopping till the beating's over
Your franchise player, go on and send him over
I'ma make him forfeit, quit, try to pretend it's over
Hand the ball off with the [?] like you owe it to me
Rip it like a pickpocket [?] throw it to me
When the Jayhawks win, we sing the same song
How can I remain calm? I'm screaming game on

[Hook]x2

[Bridge]
Hit 'em with the no look -- I mean the new look
Ball in my right hand, left hand a schoolbook
[?] too smooth, you fools, you shook
The way that we're playing, got the whole crowd saying "Game on"

[Hook]x2
