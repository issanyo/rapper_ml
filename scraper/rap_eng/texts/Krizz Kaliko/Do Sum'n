[Hook]
I'm fucked up, you fucked up, we fucked up
Can we do something?
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
And I'm about to get up in it
I'm fucked up, you fucked up, we fucked up
Can we get it freaky?
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
And we gon' leave here in a minute

[Verse 1]
We iIn the V.I.P. spot, looking for them "no-no" girls
Who wanna give it to us even though they barely knew us
If they swear they would do the cruise
Two for me and one for you
And they make me hot
And I'm looking for a girl to do some
Extra-able bodied, baby 'till the night stop
Are you gon' be that one? That one? That very special one?
To come to do me right like we on our wedding night?
If so, okay, let's go
My room, clothes hit the floor
And where they go we'll never know
Blame it on the Cuervo
It's kinda hard to resist a sister
With the lips of an angel and them big ol' hips on her
Like what I seen and then I made my approach
I said "Ya got a good team, baby ya need a new coach."
And I'm a 5 - 10 minute mack
And when we finish that
151 rum, wonder if I know how to act
It's moving through me and you too
And ain't no telling what you gon' do
When the sex on the beach is affecting how you speakin'
Ain't even the weekend, you creeping on a Thursday
Bought you a drink 'cause you looking thirstay!
Gobble it, gobble it!

[Hook]
I'm fucked up, you fucked up, we fucked up
Can we do something?
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
And I'm about to get up in it
I'm fucked up, you fucked up, we fucked up
Can we get it freaky?
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
And we gon' leave here in a minute

[Verse 2]
We off of one too many!
Baby let me call us a cab!
We way too tipsy!
You looking like you got sum'n you wanting me to have
So let's make the night go right
Go back to my casa, relax a baby
Lemme relax you
And when I make the lights go low you go low, woman
Kali Baby known for making women want him (really, really, really)
It ain't over! Let me turn you over!
I told you I'm a beast now lemme show you girl!
Fasten your seat belt it's 'bout to get turbulent
After I hurdle your girdle we'll experiment
And I know I'm to up
One and two and three, foreplay, you do whatever I say
It's only right of you to spend the night, now come on ba-by
First we'll let the song play, then do what the song say
We're married any way, it's all a part of our role play

[Hook]
I'm fucked up, you fucked up, we fucked up
Can we do something?
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
And I'm about to get up in it
I'm fucked up, you fucked up, we fucked up
Can we get it freaky?
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
And we gon' leave here in a minute

[Outro]
I'm fucked up, you fucked up, we fucked up, so fucked up (x4)
I'm so fucking drunk {repeatedly}
