[Intro: Tech N9ne]
At the first y'all ain’t hearin me, but in the end y'all gon' play

[Hook: Athena Pasutti]
Poisoning the well
Y'all gon' hear me, oh yeah
You're on me, final days have only been going through Hell
So drink it up with no filter
I give you my drama
So if you don't get it, don't get it
Well then you can't live it, I'm livin'
See I’m only as funky as my last cut
Don't blame my gifts, just fill your glass up

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Sincerely
Man I love this music thing severely
But it seems some don't wanna feel me clearly
I'm the L in Salmon, they can't hear me
So I had to work up to not giving a fuck
But the people thought I was evil
I was brought up at the steeple but they trust it not
But turn and tell a killa that he must kick rocks
When he bust it lots
And you will get a couple in ya muffin top
Me popping will be they D-day
'Cause they can't say the shit he say
Everyone don't have a tongue like a gun
They not trying to be running no relay
Sat in hell for a whole lot of years
Bread and tales I got a whole lot of cheers
Sold out shows, so bout those, foes doubt flows but bros oughta hear
Change in the making
Deep in the midwest something insane been a-baking
They claiming a nation with brain innovations
Aligning with everyone with the Strange integration

[Hook: Athena Pasutti]
Poisoning the well
Y'all gon' hear me, oh yeah
You're on me, final days have only been going through Hell
So drink it up with no filter
I give you my drama
So if you don't get it, don't get it
Well then you can't live it, I'm livin'
See I’m only as funky as my last cut
Don't blame my gifts, just fill your glass up

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Something strange in the agua
When everybody sound like blah-blah
Put the KOD in the pot and he nod
But the God no more rides well Tecca Nina saga
Someway the killa is getting twisted into the mainstream
Gangrene sick of hits again
I can flip from the rip come and sip the sin
That's my dirty water worser than Flint, Michigan
They don't wanna see my progress
But you can't stop a talent that’s God blessed
Over the years I showed 'em with my I guest
To a handsome mansion and from the projects
Wayne Minor, insane kinda, in the brain I'm a strange rhymer
Always been a change the game grinder
Poison the well
You can tell that, this boy's been in Hell
I'ma joy when inhaled
I'm the reason why everybody cheesin'
I got 'em even making noise in the jail
If everybody had to do what I do
They'd have flows coming out the wazoo
And let the god spew
Alaikumasalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh

[Hook: Athena Pasutti]
Poisoning the well
Y'all gon' hear me, oh yeah
You're on me, final days have only been going through Hell
So drink it up with no filter
I give you my drama
So if you don't get it, don't get it
Well then you can't live it, I'm livin'
See I’m only as funky as my last cut
Don't blame my gifts, just fill your glass up

[Outro]
Oh, Oh, Strange
Something’s strange and here it comes
And we ain’t nearly done
G-Zone nigga
