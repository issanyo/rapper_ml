[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Them niggas were in each other's face like this, I thought they was gon' fuck, I don't know! I'd rather be looking at a pussy like that like "Muah, muah, muah, muah, muah, muah, muah, muah!" Sorry and shit

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (4x)
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Sorry and shit

[Post-Hook: Tech N9ne]
We go, that's why she want us in her throat
Don't bring her around us because we will get the vote

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Cause money and the power get your honey in the shower
With this one he got it runny in her flower
When that whore see me rap
You won't be able to snatch your beezy back
It ain't no reason to act so sleazy cat
Music is some kind of aphrodisiac
You don't know she dreaming of having us in the sheets like
Loving that nigga that eat right, what you expect?
See, if you were Tech you would be pounding punani each night
If she bites, tell her to stop! Then we fight
Next minute, break up, then make up
That's what I call a peace pipe
My apologies, she wants Tech so she nollers me
Swallows me, on my rod is where your broad'll be
And your girl's a hella partying chick and she kiss it like
Muah, muah, muah
Sorry and shit

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (4x)
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Sorry and shit

[Post-Hook: Tech N9ne]
We dope, that's why she want us in her throat
Don't bring her around us because we will get the vote

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Uh huh, 'em big ones huh?
So I dumps the pumps, her rump will hear that song and then she on my bumper
After the show, watch how these hoes get (ya, ya!)
Cuties trying to kick it like a Colquitt
She just tryna' give me what I'm 'poda get
I'm sober as a gopher, poke her and then I'm over it
(Okay!) And I ain't slowing it down cause I got a goal to get
I know what your motive is, but you roll it 'fore the morning hit
(Okay!) I know she know just what a boner is
She phone the kids, she ain't coming home cause she on the dick
W-why you fighting 'round them areolas
Might be piping wives and them, like my rhymes reciting 'em
At the bar we can sit, drink and see how far we get
Me and the Donny Punani we already hit
(Sorry and shit) Okay!

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (4x)
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Sorry and shit

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Aye! We're some dudes they want to hug
Want us in they throat cause we hard
And give her what she missing at home
Feelin' K9 and she'll be alone
I see that snake and bat tat
Then I'm at that, wanna give us head
Around the map, you don't match that
Talkin' bout, she love me now
Now how hard it can get
And I can tell her now she hardly can sit, yeah, yeah!

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (4x)
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Sorry and shit
