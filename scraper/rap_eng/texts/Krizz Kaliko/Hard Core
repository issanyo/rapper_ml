[Intro]
Hey, Daddy!
What's up boy?
They are playing around!
Think so baby boy
Tell them you're the definition of hardcore!
I got it

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm the definition of hardcore!
You knew it when you see him
Don't try to beat him, you should try to be him
The definition of hardcore!
Hol' up, hol' up
Now why would you try? It's a suicide, it's a suicide

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Ain't nobody test me now
Now I'm pulling out the weapon
Watchin' where you steppin' on
All them steps'll get you slept in (slept in)
I ain't seen no devil in the industry, I crept in
Execs might regret the type of nigga they let in
I stay about 10 steps ahead of yah
A milli, a milli
Is what I'm headed for
Country boy [?] reppin' [?], heck no
The crowd don't move 'cause you say so!
Make some music the people can't let go
Big Krizz!
Tech birthed me in this
God cursed me with this
Way to do verses it hurts just a little bit
And hurts when you mention it
Been hurt since a little kid
But now I'm the first to burst ya twerps
Reverse and we travel the world with no rehearsal
We tryna get on, we with Fontana Universal
Commercially snake and a black bat
Makin' 'em backpack, we hardcore
You niggas is soft as fat backs repping the

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Hardcore!
You knew it when you see him
Don't try to beat him, you should try to be him
The definition of hardcore!
Hol' up, hol' up
Now why would you try? It's a suicide, it's a suicide
I'm the definition of hardcore!
You can't ignore it when you see him
Don't try to beat him, you should try to be him
The definition of hardcore!
Hol' up, hol' up
Now why would you try? It's a suicide, it's a suicide
I'm hardcore!

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
You resemble a contour Labrons tour
Gorilla I'm beating it down ya door
In a Mack truck, affectin' the people when I'm on tour, la monster
Is when the venom is seepin' up through my pores
So pay attention
Check my demeanor when I'm in arenas
My words is weapons, huh!
I'm Hiroshima, I'm buckin' with Kali
And all of my Strange team
As you're walkin' we're ridin'
Might secretly Benzes and Bimmers
Huh, my tone tough
I'm ridin' up through the city
I'm so witty, I'm wit' it
I'm keepin' the breezers giddy
They ready already
They climbin' on down my chimney
I'm hardcore, we stuck
Got Henny, Crown and the RÃ©my
Hustlers get to walkin'
Haters'll get to talkin'
And clearly no competition, so silly we gon' stop 'em
I'm front n' center
All the contenders I'm here to drop 'em
So give me the beat and watch it how I rock

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm the definition of hardcore!
You knew it when you see him
Don't try to beat him, you should try to be him
The definition of hardcore!
Hol' up, hol' up
Now why would you try? It's a suicide, it's a suicide
I'm the definition of hardcore!
You can't ignore it when you see him
Don't try to beat him, you should try to be him
The definition of hardcore!
Hol' up, hol' up
Now why would you try? It's a suicide, it's a suicide
I'm hardcore!

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
We harder than your average savage
One stroke of the pen and then we mashin'
You have what you heard and the um
And if you haven't you haven't
Your girl have, that's why we can stab it
Commence to just offending anyone listening
Peasants, never will sit with 'em
Pheasant, chicken nugget niggas, with Bentleys and buckets
From the ground up, regulators'll mount up
See you was hardcore then they found us
Fat boy, I wrapped a round pound on my tippy toes
Better bow down, I'm slippin'
Got niggas like Nicholas to hold me down
I was the prey now I'm the predator
Headin' for your cheques next
Headin' for the exit, that's it
See me I'm the eager beaver
Lynch Hung's the people eater
We family with ICP and carry a cleaver
My words can start wars
Hop is what they want more
My bite's worse than my bark when I'm reppin'

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm the definition of hardcore!
You knew it when you see him
Don't try to beat him, you should try to be him
The definition of hardcore!
Hol' up, hol' up
Now why would you try? It's a suicide, it's a suicide
I'm the definition of hardcore!
You can't ignore it when you see him
Don't try to beat him, you should try to be him
The definition of hardcore!
Hol' up, hol' up
Now why would you try? It's a suicide, it's a suicide
I'm hardcore!

[Outro]
That's what I talk about
