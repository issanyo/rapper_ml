[Verse 1]
The look upon my face
Defines the room
There's so much I want to say
That I hide from you
And it's obvious it hurts
I can make it worse
But I know my limits
Show me a bible verse
Cause I don't want to search
Just wanna end it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so hard for me to pray
While I sit and wait
In a line for change
And maybe you relate
If you've ever played
The waiting game
Now my life is like a merry-go-round
Sick and ready to stop now
And I can't handle this speed
Stop the world and let me off

[Chorus]
Stop the world and let me off
Stop the world and let me off
Let me off
Please stop the world, let me off
Let me off
Please

[Verse 2]
And I got the nerve to try to smile
Ain't been happy for a while
I only laugh to hide my pain
And I got nothing left to give
This ain't a way for me to live
To get to the sun you gotta go through the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so hard for me to pray
While I sit and wait
In a line for change
And maybe you relate
If you've ever played
The waiting game
Now my life is like a merry-go-round
Sick and ready to stop now
And I can't handle this speed
Stop the world and let me off

[Chorus 2]
Stop the world and let me off
Stop the world and let me off
Let me off
Please let me off
