[Intro]
Let's go, yeah
I feel this one mane
And this one is long overdue
It’s ’bout my Mama Nem
My mama, her sisters, her brothers, grandma too man
I just wanna take this time to speak about mama nem
Yeah, check it

[Tech N9ne - Verse 1]
She carried me when she was fifteen
Had me when she was sixteen
Reminiscing on how well she did things
Got one popped on 11/8/71, she had this king
She was baring that on that day
I was just a staring upon that face
With her, just declaring, my mom said "Wait"
Then her and her sisters named me Aaron Dontez Yates
She tried to give me everything I seen
KCP&L Gas Service was her means for green
Took me to the movies one day for Halloween to scream
Got me a big wheel couldn't afford a green machine
But I loved it
When I got it, all my friends swarming
Cause in the projects big wheels wasn’t the norm
And I’m pouring this out to the woman I’m adoring
She knew I like Sugar Smacks and a fried baloney sandwich in the morning

[Hook]
Mama
I take you everywhere I go
I thank you’re mine, that's my momma nem
I only know what I know 'cause of my mama nem
You gave me life and made me me
I don’t know who I’d be without
My auntie nem, my sisters and, my uncle nem
Mama nem

[Tech N9ne - Verse 2]
When I got bad grades I was in the heat seat
Got a whoppin when I used another kids cheat sheet
But when I got a good grade card she bought me Beat street
The single, ayo I had that mug on repeat
Mama nem taught me rythm that I use yep
My uncle nem say’s stay on your P’s and Q’s neph’
Mama talking catch you, if you actin' like you deaf
God-fearing still taught me how to two-step
Took me to church, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Than Sunday thinking why me?
That was mama nem placin’ the love inside me
Our house was lively
My granny house, 8 girls and 4 boys beside me
Thanking Mama nem, for the weight that you carry
Pulling my teeth with thread sayin “boy you scary”
I ‘memba mama laughin sayin’ “Is it loose?”
“Very”
Pull it then, put cash in my pillow sayin’ its the tooth fairy

[Hook]
Mama
I take you everywhere I go

[Tech N9ne - Verse 3]
Epilepsy at 18, the lupus hit her
Pancreatitus was taking her but God was with her
I asked to show me something 'cause I was all bitter
Right after that the pancreatitus had all withered
Mama? “Yeah”
Mama!! “What?”
MAMA!!! “WHAT Boy?”
I’m a big timer
I’m always away from you 'cause of this music biz drama
But I really miss you and I’m always thinking ’bout big mama
She used to make that Thanks Giving and Christmas dinner
Grandma’s home cooking easily show up Mrs Winners
Mama nem would take you in even if you’re vicious sinner
Nobody would ever take that humungous love that's within her
If your mama gone, heavens where mum belongs
But if your momma home, call ya momma phone
And say I love you momma and you are not alone
I just wanted to thank you and that's why I made this momma song

[Hook]
Mama
I take you everywhere I go

You gave me life and made me me
I don’t know who I’d be without
My auntie nem, my sisters and, my uncle nem
Mama nem
