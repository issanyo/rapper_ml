[Hook]
Way out, way out
I'm the life of the party
Way out
We going all the way
Way out, way out
You better ask somebody
I'm way out
That's what the people say
Way out, way out
Every night and day
Way out
I'm so far away
Way out, way out
Ask me where a nigga stay
I'm way out
Psycho, might go, skitzo
Krizz so, effin, crazy
Kali Baby

[Verse 1]
You feel the chant of the Zulu massi
You wanna hit? Bullshit! Nigga, I won't act right
We parade round the planet, like we laylow round the Wu Tang
If you do, you're about to seal your fate
See I'm doomed
Nothing left upstairs but some cobwebs
And tryna push my crazy into y'all's heads
Almost paid, you gave me some
My baby try to eat, he's sucking on his baby thumb
The poster child of stage antics
We say what we want em to say, and they chant it
We one hit away, but they trying to get away with our pay out
Me and K.O.D. will stay talkin' bout

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Just a regular nigga
From let it brew
Douche ready for talkin snippy so I'mma let it chew
They can't come out here
With fricasses they freak
When seen round here
The stars seem like they a car length away
Better yet a bar length away
Y'all sink the pay
The snake and bat will bring the paper back
To the state of rap I'm callin' out
And we stayin' way out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Am I insane, have you been tainted
We running things, that you've been sayin'
I get your message on the internet
Sayin that we bout to change it up
And every time you see us scream it up
Why you can't play nice with the regular kids
And why you got that makeup over your eyelids?
Feel like I'm been stranded on an island
I've been, meditating when I'm awakened I feel violent
