(Verse 1)
Now what is pain?
Pain is heart break
The long road to disappointment
The fly in the ointment
Lifes a gamble
Life's a coin flip
Scattered emotions
Fabricated notions
Lead to convulsions
Inside we bleed for love, we fiend
Was the need for devotion
Water the seed and then ya leave
Once you see the commotion
He's like a fairy tale, call him Dad
But no one knows him
See, pain is lonely
Knows no race no age
Has no limits
What'll you do when
Those around you break they
Past commitments?
How do you deal with
The demons that seem to
Always want you?
It's hard to react
Just never look back
The past will always haunt you
You see for some people
Pain is poverty, money stricken
You get that flu like symptom
Pain can pick and choose its victims
Just as soon as you think you through
You're hit with new convictions
Substance abbuse you choose to use
Pursue some new addiction
And only you can fix em
Soon as he sips the boose it hits him
Rips his crucifixion
Only god can view your true afflictions

(Chorus 1)
Pain, I can't escape it
It ain't the way I made it
Is their a way to change
The ending of my days
I feel the pain

I can't ignore it
What can I do for it?
Is there a pill that I can take
To help me medicate this pain?

(Verse 2)
See pain is Cancer that eats away
From inside of ya that fast
The road to death with no answer
Ya diary of shattered dreams
An empty hope Chest contain
A mental anguish
Pain communicates through any language
Whether your broke or famous
Either way ya make some money
Watch how fast it goes
But you're too broke
To have a drug problem
It's that simple
To get through pain you have
It's half grindin'
It's half mental
Still its hard too explain
To your family why
You act schitzo
See, pain is court
Hopin' the judge can hear you speaking
When you're explainin you're fit to have
Your kids more than just weekends
Pain is falling outta love with her
Moving on to another
While your daughter asks her daddy
Do you really hate my mother?
Its like we really hate each other
It's crazy how smarts some kids could be
It's crazy by just looking in their eyes
How far a kid could see
The pain, statisticly affects the average person mentally
So simply, the rides headed for self destructive misery

(Chorus 2)
Pain, I can escape it
It ain't the way I made it
Is their a way to change
The ending of my days
I feel the pain

I can't ignore it
What can I do for it?
Is there a pill that I can take
To help me medicate this pain?

(Verse 3)
I've had so many ups and downs
In my life, its making me nauseous
Had so many people let me down
That's what's making me cautious
Compare the wins to the losses
Compare the frauds to the phony's
Compare the people that had my back
To five minute homies
Compare the father that left me
To the one that took me and raised me
He ain't my blood, he wasn't there
When I was born, but he gave me
That second chance that I needed
When I was down and unconscious
Did everything around me
Still I stood up tall to the nonsense
I won that custody battle
I'm raising my daughter, my way
I call the shots, I make the decisions
From Monday through Friday
I beat that case
I said goodbye to probation
Its like the weight was lifted off my shoulders
Once I shook that time I was facing
The family problems always linger
When someones pointing the finger, yea its funny
More that half of the time its all over money
You could label me temporarily insane
But see, you gotta understand
I ain't the only person going through pain

(Chorus 3)
Pain, I can escape it
It ain't the way I made it
Is their a way to change
The ending of my days
I feel the pain

I can't ignore it
What can I do for it?
Is there a pill that I can take
To help me medicate this pain?
