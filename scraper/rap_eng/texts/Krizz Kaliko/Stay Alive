[Hook 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, I just hope that I’m alive for it
Sacrificed everything up under the sky for it
Crossed my heart to only die for it, yea
Feel like it’s comin’, I just hope that I’m alive for it
Sing junior (La, la, la)
Sing for the world (La, la, la)
Sing for the people (La, la, la)
Yeah (La, la, la)

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Globe trottin’, me and N9na ain’t stoppin’
Eye poppin’, stage antics for your eye sockets
Antibiotics are so toxic
I take ‘em so I can still keep the people’s head noddin'
This the Mister Kali Baby, how you’ve been?
From here to Iraq and back, that’s how we live
Eatin’ in gas stations, fast foods, that’s how it goes
Months got us surpassing, every hood send the casket closed (Okay)
And if you missed us, we’ve been right under your nose
We home for Christmas, then right back on the road
It’s been a great blessing, a lesson of sorts
Baby got new shoes, put 'em in the best schools that I can afford
Been a long way since Travis' Ford, drivin’ us back and forth
And I only need one reward, they see your people look poor (Okay)
Dip my head in the holy water, pray the Holy Father
Forgive me for wrongs and just let me live a ltttle bit longer

[Hook 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, I just hope that I’m alive for it
Sacrificed everything up under the sky for it
Crossed my heart to only die for it, yea
Feel like it’s comin’, I just hope that I’m alive for it
Sing junior (La, la, la)
Yeah (La, la, la)
Sing for the people (La, la, la)
Yeah (La, la, la)

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Scoob
Don’t think it’s comin’ nigga, especially not the way I wanted
How it’s supposed to be, it's old to me so I'm still on it
Ain’t no frontin’ it, no stuntin’ man, I came from nothin’
A block nigga, everything I’m worth came from hustlin’
This rap shit full of tricks, ain’t no ruse in it
Flip a switch, back to itch and I can’t lose with it
I dump that pow wow get them tow wow’s on my food with it
Play me 5 pow I go pow pow, that means you get it
I read these blogger sites where rocker tights been talking trife
They can't feel my life and what I write when I bless a mike
If they ain’t feelin’ what the villain spillin’ fuck 'em man
This what I’m spillin’ till my killin' and then come back again
Never win, never will, never end in battles
It’s like I’m tryna push a herd of sheep that’s really cattle
I’m so rattled in the saddle, it’s a bumpy ride
It wouldn’t matter if I died or if I stayed alive

[Hook 1]

[Outro]

Bless my uncle Chris
Thank you Heavenly Father for protecting my husband in Jesus’ name, amen
God bless my daddy
