You're one hunder-ed, we so hunterish
You're one hunder-ed, we so hunterish

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Unga bunga bunga, inga binga binga bunga
It's fun to hunt the cunt to ding the dink to feed my hunger
I jump on a bitch, pump on a chick
Crunch and munch on a clit, dunking a dick
Somethin' sunk in it quick, krumpin' a bit
Humpin' the nina bring the thunder
I be the king of Kongo up in your spleen, the weiner's on you
I eat it up like sufamunda, cheese between lasagna
I skeet it up then giddy up, fiend for cream, vagin-a tong-ue
Then feed the need, we lump for hunters, easily we done you
The gal sure look like fuck food to me
Might as well, bitch, I know you suck dudes for free
I can smell slit, when I'm in lust to a degree
If it's shellfish, I'm in the dust, you is debris, trick
If you one hund-er-ed, we so hunterish
We come for the wonder chicks, whose buns are thick and to make my lumber spit
And my whole crew hunt
Want some of that new chum
Keri Hilson sure looks good (tastes good too, punk)

[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]
I'm placed in hands and they notice I'm approachin'
Scopin' out where the cushion at
Snatch her out this habitat, soon as I stab my hook in that
Can't stop lickin' my chops, watchin' her walking, now I'm lookin' at
Them pair of Apple Bottoms and that donka that she put in that
I got bottle full of Captain and Jack and I'm ready to get it crackin'
Baby, now tell me what you wanna do
I got a package full a Magnums back at the pad
If you wanna attack then I'mma be strapped up for you
And all ya home girls, baby bring the whole herd!
It's open season for pillow squeezin' and leavin' toes curled
Inebriated, slightly faded, time to get it poppin'
Pull up the bus, open the doors and all the bunnies hop in
Show me her naval ring and said there's one more underneath it
Tech I don't believe, Kali what you think? (LET ME SEE IT!)
The newest member of the Drill Team
I'm on the prowl
Just a wiff of the feminin' scent I'm equippin' for infinite pimpin'
It's goin' down
See baby girl, I'll beat it up, and put it in a headlock
When I snap and go primeval on that ass, makin' the bed rock

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm a sexual predator, better alert the neighbors
'Cause they desperate housewives is just my flavor
Darth Vader, pullin' out my light saber
And they like my hard candy, call it Now and Later
Spear chuck of mutha (HEY!) I'm a hunter-gatherer
Lookin' for a super soaker and loofah lather her
Bend 'er over then ya stroke her, I mean ya stabbin' 'er
Get to pokin', get to strokin', I mean ya ravager
Bring it down-a, I'm eatin' bush babies right out the showa
Dine with me and N9ne, byin' fine wine
We devour ya, carnivourish niggerish
I gobble the top of ya like it was liquorish
I even tell fat girls (HEY!) come here, are ya ticklish?
Dirk Diggler, might hurt ya but might fit ya
Honey want a hunt ya just ta hit ya
So go on, take a chance, when I advance, don't freeze up
Somethin in ya pants I wanna beat up, 'cause, ya-ya-ya-
