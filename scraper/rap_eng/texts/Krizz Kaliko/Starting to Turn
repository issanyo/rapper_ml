Turning
Turning
Turning
Turning

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Alright
I don't wanna do this anymore, stop
Tellin' me that we can make it in a hell where it's gonna be many more shocks
Use to be I needed love now I need about 3 or 4 shots
With another round just to hit it now yes I'm messier than any gore plot
I am doing what the sick does
Takin' anything to get buzzed
'Stead of eatin' wit' the family I rather get my dinner in a strip club
Not a evil that can rival me becoming even darker than a crip slug comin' to clip bloods
Took the gentleman and put him underground like in Dig Dug
So long every day shit there's no hope for we
Repetition kept us glitchin', your folks bore me
I'm turning into what my lady provoked for she never really knew inside of my brain having ho soaked orgies, constantly

[Hook: Jonathan Davis]
Do you really wanna see this thing that's turning in me?
Turning in me? NO!
I am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn
I didn't do it, got something to stir it up
I am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn
I couldn't see it but hatred is feeding it

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Migraine, I'm bane, ain't nobody feelin' my pain
Stupid women I blame so goodbye sane I'ma fry my brain! Drugs I'ma try aim to deny shame and defy thy rain
Look into my eye mane I wanna fly gettin' really high and die strange
How do I describe, you and I entropy, inside of me an entity
Turning me into to the portion of identity
That you'll never know there, 'til my anger make a slow tear
Any beef wanna grow, I swear I eat it so rare, baby oh yeah
Take off your bitchiness that hate oh so it's just
Turning me into the insane, playing all kind of sin games
Taking it in like a ganja hit, you're the reason why the bomb was lit
Got me thinking "murder everything in sight", monster shit!

[Hook: Jonathan Davis]
Do you really wanna see this thing that's turning in me?
Turning in me? NO!
I am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn
I didn't do it, got something to stir it up
I am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn
I couldn't see it but hatred is feeding it
I am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn
I didn't do it, got something to stir it up
I am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn
I couldn't see it but hatred is feeding it

[Outro: Tech N9ne & Jonathan Davis]
No!
Wait for it, wait for it!
Driving me crazy when you lie to me baby
You're driving me crazy when you lie to me baby
Driving me crazy when you lie to me baby
Well that's real shady, you might die if you play me!
