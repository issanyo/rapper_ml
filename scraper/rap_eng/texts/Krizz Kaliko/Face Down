[Intro]
This is for you
No one in particular
For you
No one in particular
No one, no one
Yeah, yeah, look

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't got a problem with people rejecting me
But you the only one that connects to me, next to me
If you don't love me, then you don't love me I guess
But don't put me out there, you know what's next
I hide from you, I know you don't feel me
Cyanide, cyanide, like you 'gon kill me
I might fall off, but guess who get up
That makes me soft, yeah, gonna run up

[Hook]
Face down, every time I get up
I see the funny look that's on your face now
I ain't bout to put up with bullshit
Ain't got time to waste now
Pull up on me, nigga pull up
Now you in my face now, wait hold up
Face down

[Verse 2]
I don't think you see me
Maybe I've become too invisible
Nobody believes me
'Cause they see me smile and I'm miserable
Stay true, stay true
Say real niggas stay true
Well if you say I'm the realest
Tell me what that make you

[Hook]
Face down, every time I get up
I see the funny look that's on your face now
I ain't bout to put up with bullshit
Ain't got time to waste now
Pull up on me, nigga pull up
Now you in my face now, wait hold up
Face down

[Bridge]
Falling out of love with
What I do, blame it on you
Loyal, loyal what I'm used to
Falling out of love with
What I do, blame it on you
Loyal, loyal what I'm used to

[Hook]
Face down, every time I get up
I see the funny look that's on your face now
I ain't bout to put up with bullshit
Ain't got time to waste now
Pull up on me, nigga pull up
Now you in my face now, wait hold up
Face down

[Outro]
This is for you
No one in particular
For you
No one in particular
No one, no one
