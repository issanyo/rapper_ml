[Intro]
Yeah, you must be throw'd
You gon' make them thangs come up out that load
You ain't built like that but you talk so cold
Yeah, we know

[Verse 1]
Hurts now, purps found cause a nigga squirt rounds
Acting like ya wore a purse on turf grounds
Like how his homies didn't tell him to pull his skirt down
Now look at'cha
Loud mouth we found a round to match ya
Bound to smack ya, now the ground'll catch ya
'Cause you frowned at the hounds and you found disaster
He talking hella shady
How I get it on the daily
They jelly bout my gravy but they crazy 'cause they think I won't be banging like the 80's
Your homie was a movie
So we dot him with the tooly
Got his family sick and woozy
Giving him the finger, way of Rodney O and Joe Cooley
They hot around the collar
'Cause I got a lot of shotters
So don't nobody bother, if they try to then we stoppin' they medulla oblongata
So be careful when you saucing
You could end up in the coffin
You better take precaution when you see real niggas crossing, shut the fuck up when we talking
If you get my killers heated
You'll be curled up like a fetus
All them words, you're gonna eat it
Every fist and all the feet is never ceasing when you pleaded
So I think you better comma
Or get lit up with the llama
KC all the way to Ghana, when you grown and start the drama, ain't no running to yo mama, nigga

[Hook] x2
No running to yo mama
When you caught up in the drama
No running to yo mama when you caught up in the drama 'cause you did nobody honor

[Verse 2]
We the boss players
In this, industry and not SEGA
Nigga we are stop haters
We take 'em to the end and then it's biva Las Begas
If you tripping, y'all nuts
'Cause we sick and all bust
So get the motherfucking pineapple, the rum and the coconut and mix it all up
We coming from the ghetto
And we keep the heavy metal
So you suckers better settle 'cause we turn a wolf and devil to a woman in stilettos
'Cause they didn't really want it
They was only in the moment
Hella talking, never on it
Had they're chance and now they blown it 'cause the king was their opponent
He bit the hand that fed him
Run you over if you let him
All the homies wanna get him, heard the words when he said them now I know that he regret them
'Cause we be getting money
And he be looking bummy
So keep the coward from me, when you see me don't be chummy
Muh'fucking dummy
I know you can't stand me
But you know that we go hammy
Have you sleeping like a xanny, hit them with a super whammy when I cut them from the family
We in every nook and cranny
Hit you when you're in your jammies, when you're in your manny panties
See me and my brother Sammy, ain't no yelling for your granny and no running to your mammy nigga

[Hook] x2
No running to yo mama
When you caught up in the drama
No running to yo mama when you caught up in the drama 'cause you did nobody honor
