[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Motions run deep
Eyes my demise
Lies on the lies
Just to get a rise
Keep the purple, it all up in social
Having a milli thighs
Rise throwing up my vibe
I been loud at nine
Time
You post online now you won't resign
These words, these words'll have you in a bind
I'm riding, I done got ghost
Ride out (Ride out)
Ride out. hoe

[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
Be careful of the words that people say
Becomes a wedge between us
You can't redeem us
Said the choice is all you make
Gotta learn from your mistake
Never should have came out of your mouth
In this world, we been living, we been living
In this world, we been living, we been living like

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Ohhhhh
In this little world, we been living like
Ohhhhh
Envy and greed in the middle like
Go secure the bag, I was living life
Wanna do you bad then they minimize
Ohhhhh
Wanna do you bad then they minimize

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
I only look as good as the money made me
I only go as far as I let you take me
Krizz in his feelings any given day
I say fuck everybody, that ain't the thing to say
See I'm needy though, pockets staying meaty though
Are you charging the girls or am I shooting off your pinky toe
Girlies used to call me rock of Gibraltar
Used to plot the twat hot thoughts that made me stop at the altar
That's what they used to say 'bout little old me
Had 'em in fiddle well when I was little they try to pin it on me
But I rise like the sun up
Money in me gun up
But I backpedal 'cause I pack the metal
Nigga shut the fuck up

[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
Be careful of the words that people say
Becomes a wedge between us
You can't redeem us
Said the choice is all you make
Gotta learn from your mistakes
Never should have came out of your mouth
Got me feeling like

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Ohhhhh
In this little world, we been living like
Ohhhhh
Envy and greed in the middle like
Go secure the bag, I was living life
Wanna do you bad then they minimize
Ohhhhh
Wanna do you bad then they minimize

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
(Who) Said I lost it
(You) When I spit raw shit
(True) Sin agnostic
(Few) This hem is god's grip
On your esophagus we sock a trick in the oculus
When he rock it be populous
When he gassin' better call E. Brockovich
His mouth, it spits doubt
Then I flipped out on the sick route
Now it's tits out
Like a chick when you rippin a bitch blouse
Norm niggas born rigid
But the Nina's (what?) Korn wicked
How you gonna say that a nigga lost it when I was
(What?) born with it
I take it back Tech
Why play with rap's best
I make it fly, basic guys, they can have debt
I cash checks on the regular
Tech is high as nebula
So bust a route, doubt it
Should never came out your fucking mouth

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Ohhhhh
In this little world, we been living like
Ohhhhh
Envy and greed in the middle like
Supposed to get a bag, I was living life
Wanna do you bad then they minimize
Ohhhhh
Wanna do you bad then they minimize
