[Verse 1: Mackenzie Nicole]
This year is mine get your hand off the pie
I'm a good girl and I'm never a thot
People see me, think they know what I got
Well I got the money, just give me a shot (ayoo)
The way that I'm living, don't have to get used to
Money from the booth too, Strange life is beautiful (en fuego)
I'm somewhere thawn out from that cold
Live this way 'till I'm old
Stay on my toes

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
I stay on my toes, I stay on my toes
You don't have to tell me, I already know
Don't say it to me, just wait 'till I go
Shoe game, Liu Kang, stay on my toes
I stay on my toes, I stay on my toes
I stay on my toes, I stay on my toes
Don't say it to me, just wait 'till I go
Shoe game, Liu Kang, stay on my toes

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Look, well I ain't never been on TV
Nah, I maybe once, but I ain't never been on BET

That's where we at, where we at, in case anybody say somethin'
See the way my bank account is set up, I got a checking and  savings
Keep my foot on the gas and don't let up

In my Jordans, I'm on my toes
Y'alls froze, we clap back

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
I stay on my toes, I stay on my toes
You don't have to tell me, I already know
Don't say it to me, just wait 'till I go
Shoe game, Liu Kang, stay on my toes
I stay on my toes, I stay on my toes
I stay on my toes, I stay on my toes
Don't say it to me, just wait 'till I go
Shoe game, Liu Kang, stay on my toes

[Outro: Mackenzie Nicole]

From the left side baby to the right side, you can tell when I walk in
And then I walk out, I
