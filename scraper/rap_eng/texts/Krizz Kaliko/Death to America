[Intro]
No terror... this is just my opinion (2x)
Listen

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
My president ain't black, he's high yellow
Tell em, legalize weed and shut the hell up
Crack baby, act crazy, bullies always bother him
Maybe that ain't that crazy, no one is responsible
Thicker than a snicker make you stick a ?
Now we're paying taxes just to raise another nigga
Just run out my EBT, what my youngins gonna eat?
Put my gun under the seat


[Hook]
And welcome to America, uh huh
We'll tell em death to America
Death to America, okay

[Verse 2 : Krizz Kaliko]
Welcome to America, "liberate me" tatted on my arms
Yeah we got bombs, but YOU can't have nuclear arms
See the whites of my eyes, and the pinks of my gums
Got a Master's degree, I still sleep in the slums
I see how they're misleading the people
Tell 'em don't mention the steeple, and if they do it's illegal
Lost in your elementary school, it be penitentiary rules
Teachers pack a gun now, off in Youngstown
I cry cause they was Kristopher's age
You got to bury your young, we get to live on the stage
But you don't care
Your baby's safe at home... not
You better pack your chrome

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Well welcome to America, where we got crips and bloods
That will try to rip you right up out your Christian blood
This is the place where you wish you was
Come meet me, and beat me, but greet me with a kiss and hug
This is the land of abomination and nigga's
Livin' rich still working on the plantation
Hold your temple or the whipping will continue
We're still segregated, but we don't pretenduh be
I still see bullies will fully - semi autos
And they pull 'em out of they hoodies
Colorado - can't even go to the movies
Cause if you do they'll shoot ya
Well this is the America
You know it

[Hook]
