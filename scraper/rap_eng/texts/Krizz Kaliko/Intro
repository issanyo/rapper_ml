Son of Sam!
Can he do what he do?
Can he do what he do?
Feel of the way that I’m holdin my rapping apparatus
If I was absent would they be mad at us
It’s like a natural attraction to back it up on the package
Look at they asses throwin' ad at us
My rap strips the innocence of millions of citizens
Enter they showin' their inner in or my finishing
Do backflips my energy with intimate genital genitals
I know a million ways to give it to him
I get her super soaked cause I thought that would be
Sick on me I sodomize I cauterize I gotta like her
(Okay!)
She do somethin' to my music and hopin'
She didn’t kind of need me, needing me to have her terrorize her
She’d like she wanting the feel of the pen in her
I been there and then dinner
A gentleman at dinner but
I sing in tenor my men is ready to bland her
My tenderloin bigger she need the Focker, no Ben Stiller
Give her on up, get upiddy right, I got it
I busting in, they give it up, the gun is automatic
What's up with skilly, potbelly and like shot so appealing
I thought those kiddie it, giddy up and giddy it, look like an idiot
Take mention to Kalikoholics
Know we get the bitches have a frolick and can do nothing about it
They get to  listen and  get up all their kissin' and lick up on us
Put they mouth and shout, Krizz'll wanna
Love you
I know you do
And now, the greatest love song ever
