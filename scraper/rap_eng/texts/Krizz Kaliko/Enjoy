[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Your body don't lie, I can tell you done this before
You're too locked up, let me put my key in your door
I know you're feeling broken, won't you lead
And put yo' body all on top of me, I want to enjoy

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Welcome to my wonderful world of enjoyment
Only go-gettin' sexy women get employment
Full of exuberance, behavior is flamboyant
Anyone not drinkin' and smokin' is an annoyance
If you wanna work you can visit me in the cockpit
You will now you have it when I put you up on the hot list
Then I'll check your body parts makin' sure that it's spotless
I am the controller, so baby, just know I got this
Truly elegant, sex for the hell of it
Who you got waitin' at the crilla is irrelevant
Need to know the smell of it
Smellin' like the crotch produce Creed Spring Flower's what I tell the bitch

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
BEBE, BCBG, BP (Baby Phat), CC (Chanel), GC (Gucci)
Take it off so I can see ye 3D
You're great at extending the pee-pee
Oh shit focus, mo' chicks, hold this (what?)
Hootie and the Blowfish (huh?)
Hocus pocus
I'ma go in my pocket and pull out a wad of this guac and baby it's no trip
And when your shift's over we can be done
Or we can continue at a sleaze moteez
You can check out anytime you like
But you can't never leave the need to please
Enjoy!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Sexy, sexy, enjoy

Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I can see your lips are smilin' but it's not the ones above
If I enter in ya we'll just have to pretend that it's love
You’re topless (oh lord) you’re bottomless too
Kinda crazy what a bottle'll do to you and ooh (ooh wee)
Baby do me, give to me, please let me enjoy

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?
Sexy, sexy, enjoy
Won't you let me enjoy?
Sexy, sexy, enjoy

Sexy, sexy, enjoy

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
It's not a fantasy (so so real)
We'll be comin' uncontrollably
Sexy individual
Baby let's get physical
Play with you, you are my toy
I want to enjoy
