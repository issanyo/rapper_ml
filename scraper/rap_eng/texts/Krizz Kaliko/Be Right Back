[Intro]
Y'all done did it this time, uh huh
I ain't lettin' that ride (ride)
Yeah, y'all done did it this time
Better not let me go outside

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Say somethin', say it again, I dare ya!
I got somethin' that'll do a little more than scare ya
They say wear a raincoat or we might get wet
Well I ain't met a motha-huh who can do that yet!
Talkin' that jibbity jabba 'bout to put some hot ones through us
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us
Your girlie wanna do us, the Snake and the Bat cats
She off some of that fluid, just for shakin' that back fat
We come in peace, but you know we got our pieces
Can be the beast, takin' out all 32 teeth is
'Cause church folk got limits to that limits you to minuscule
Words you can use to make criminals diminish you
Finish you and your women too, wet you like a swimmin poo'
That 80's baby face got 44's and turned to 88's
But keep 'em in my holster I'm supposed to be the nice guy
Don't do me like that, keep on poppin' off then I'll be right back

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Keep on disrespectin' me homie
And I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
You done said somethin' slick to me?
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
Back up- back up, give me room, boy
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
Told me- told me bust a move, well
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
These slick talkin' disrespectful bad mouthing the gods
It's lil buddy thinkin' gully, I'mma give him his chop
Knock his hinges with the vengeance; so precise with the heat
Like Adam Jones from on the throne; I send my dogs to the streets
Young thundas wit' no blunders, make the hit then they wonder
Roguish villains made a killin'? That's the question they ponder
Old head street villain with the tricks of the trade
I'f I'm Sicily my history a nigga be made
Well paid, legendary from my time in the field
I call the plays, I'm quarterbackin', I'm a boss in the Ville
Send em seein', chasin' cream, movin' dolo for green
Not what it seems? Call the team, have you blitzed like a fiend
Paparazzi's flashin' choppies hundred pictures wit' papi
While I never left the party slammin' liquor wit' mommy
Leave my message with this reference; I ain't givin' no slack
Slick talkin', disrespectful boy them dogs'll be back

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Keep on disrespectin' me homie
And I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
You done said somethin' slick to me?
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
Back up- back up, give me room, boy
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
Told me- told me bust a move, well
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Yates!
Why you yellin' on my phone like you major
Actin' like you killin' your witness somebody paid ya'
If you really want Ninna in ya spot then I can aid ya'
I'll be right back on tour then me and my rellies invade ya'
Nigga I got riders in Fresno, never scared to let lead go
Your message was womanish, betta yet it sounded real lesbo
Like a gay woman you trip 'cause anotha bitch said so
Just tell the truth you trippin' 'cause I'm reppin' that red though
But don't be actin' like you don' know C-Bo is my family
And you claimin' West Coast Mafia soundin' real Ghandi
C-Bo don't be runnin' wit niggas feelin' dandy in panties
Instead of a man these pansies hand me a shanty
Stop callin' me from a private number violent gunner
In a silent slumber, die and it wonders, rise at thunder
Is it because ya chick gave me a night cap and you don't like that?
Well don't worry homie my tour is comin' I'll be right back

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Keep on disrespectin' me homie
And I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
You done said somethin' slick to me?
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
Back up- back up, give me room, boy
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
Told me- told me bust a move, well
I'll be right back, I'll be- I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
