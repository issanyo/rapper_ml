[Hook] x2
See they can try but they can't do it like I do it-do it
Go on dance then do it like I do it-do it
Don't try to stop me boy, do it like I do it-do it
I see you, now watch me baby, do it like I do it-do it

[Verse 1]
Kali in this thing, baby, watch me go
If I'm soft motherfucker, then I'm the last to know
I'll come through your town
Beat-the-beat-the-beat the ground up
This one here make you bob your head and keep your frown up
What excuse to let loose and it's proof to boost my ego
Through the roof and there be groupies, two per wherever we go
Twenty dollar bill in the cushion of my Chevy
And I'm off of a piece of pill and I'm drinkin' kinda heavy
We stars so you know we show up late to the place
And I'm trying to get so crunk that I can't feel my face
And I'm out the house tonight without my spouse so I'ma let it out
Get it out, reak out and all my niggas be way to weirded out
We see them looks, we see them mugs on your face
And the funny hand shakes, grab your girly by the waist
We ain't even trippin', sippin' on that do it fluid
It's a circle of them girly's 'round me came to watch me do it

[Verse 2]
I'm a out south suburban knight red bone high, yellow huntin'
Chocolate chunky, Dunkin' Donut typa' guy (that's me)
Fat, black, greasy and still'll pull your breezy
And it's easy if you're weak you better keep her by
Man why? See it's simple they can't do it like I do it-do it
Specially when we off a' Caribou, Super Dew'll do it
Hardly gnarly, Big Krizz be the best in the biz
After the party escape with your ex to the crib
She put a little bit of kiss on a little bit of this and a little bit of (High, Ho)
And I fall up in the spot and I'm finna' make it hot, and I'm finna' freak her off then I (Go, go)
Slow, 'cause I don't want to be the first to lose it
I'm the papi I prove it with how I do's it (That's coo)

[Verse 3]
Ain't no tellin' how I plan to do 'em if you know I'm better than 'em
That can hold a candle to 'em baby I'ma hand it to 'em
'Cause they don't deal with like a O.G. or me
Keep on thinkin' Kaliko your homie, so we
Dip to the spot where they look at me crooked
I got doubt in your clout, 'cause I took it 'cause I'm popular
They ocular socket be focused on my pocket
And it's something I got cocked and I'm knowin' to make 'em stop it
Played and been all over the world, this is my opinion
You can tell by the self rolled Benjamins we spendin'
Been gone, 50 city tour but we used to it
Maneuver the crowd and they be lovin' how we doin' it
