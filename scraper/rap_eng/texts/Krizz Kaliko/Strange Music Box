[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Aww, dwaamn!
Do y'all realize what y'all done did? Hihih!
Y'all done opened up a can of sick-ass
And I'm about to eat y'all quick-fast, hey

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I've been hibernatin' in the deepest darkest part of Necropolis
Now that I'm poppin' it's top, yes I'm the opposite of monogamous
MÃ©nage, I get awkward in this box a bit
Hostile, it's gotta get twist in a knot with this apocolypse
Holla it (Tech-Tech N9ne-N9ne shit, I'm lovin' it)
I'm a drug to this grudge of his, rip my covenant, I'll plug a bitch
Lovin' this mug is what the ruckus is, psycho thug with it
Fallin' down like Michael Douglas with the ruggishness
What did I mean, they wonderin' why did I bring this side of my dream?
The Nina's a horror machine, dollar for dollar, I balla for all of my green
Nigga, my name is Inigo Montoya, I got an evil plan for ya
And you're about to get dropped, this box is worse than Pandora
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
They're all gonna laugh at you, 'cause I had to do what I had to do
When tappin' you like Shabba Doo
Beatin' 'em up and shootin' 'em up then stab a few
Sad ya knew that you had your crew and they ass are through
I'm killin' em, throwin' 'em back at you

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
That's what's happenin', Strange Music Box
Got us tappin' in, Strange Music Box
Bump then slap again (why?) Strange Music knocks
Back up openin', Strange Music Box
That's what's happenin', Strange Music Box
Got us tappin' in, Strange Music Box
Bump then slap again (why?) Strange Music knocks
Back up openin', Strange Music Box

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
See once they open my lid I'mma give it to 'em
Ever since I was a lil bitty kid I've been truly ruined
I reflected on what I did 'fore I ran into 'em
I used to be a fat jerk now I flirt 'cause the scent of a woman
Now I don't act like, walk like, the nigga that you used to know
Now I sing and rap about the strange life, it's beautiful
Tell it to 'em like a Geni-u-s, spit it out like I thought you knew
Bubblin', hope you hear me fizz, prayin' to God I make it through
Kali Baby, check my strange box of tricks
Kaliko alley cat, lyrical, watch his lips
He can go really fast, slow it down and stop that shit
Or make it dumb to make sure you niggas got that shit
I'm just playin' with music, I'm the elite heat speech chief
Play me and watch they feet turn Beat Street
'Cause I'm blowin' out they socks, The Freddie Foxxx of my block
There's somethin' strange goin' on in that box, Kali Baby!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
That's what's happenin', Strange Music Box
Got us tappin' in, Strange Music Box
Bump then slap again (why?) Strange Music knocks
Back up openin', Strange Music Box
That's what's happenin', Strange Music Box
Got us tappin' in, Strange Music Box
Bump then slap again (why?) Strange Music knocks
Back up openin', Strange Music Box

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Spiderman, off of this lyrical Vicodin
Off of this here we go I get it in
Spittin' that petrol, let go, Tech know sets blow (Kaboom)
Come see about me, nigga
Figure this, I'mma get venomous takin' out ten of us
Niggas is sweet like cinnamon, wait, but then again
I'mma pick up the pen again, bit 'em in half, blood bath
Then I'mma laugh, then I'mma smash
Then I'mma ash, then I'mma blast first
Then I'mma send him his ending, cut 'im up
Fuckin him up the rectum, I dissect the man
I'mma try to eat the neck and hand
Slice him up like a Mexican
Seconds in his body is fricassee shit is bleedin', you should see him or you can be him
I got dead human beings in the freezer, I'm a believer
I ain't no Wally Cleaver but I carry a meat cleaver
I speek geek to people, I'm lethal, a little strange
I eat it with Cream of Wheat and some butter that's mixed with brains
I'm the Coathanga Strangla, hangin' him up, he's fried rice
He tried twice, he's dry ice, tell 'em Tech N9ne

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
