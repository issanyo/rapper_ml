[Verse 1: Liquid Assassin]
Lord that's me, your boy LA
I just wanna thank you for my heartbeat needed today
I wanna thank you for my mom and dad too
Sorry I live life like I gotta be a bad dude
Really I just wanna confess
About the thangs goin' on
Get this pain off my chest
Deep down in hurts words and it burns in my flesh
Now I'm sorry for my sins that's made you upset
But these thangs goin' on now, I though you should know
Paps got cancer, I don't know where to go
Doc told me that he had too must to live
Turns out his feelin' fine he's not even feelin' sick
But I know you propably had some to do with that
By the way my mom, she right back on the right track
Couple thangs going good, I though you're like that
Sincerely yours can't wait to see you right back

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Lord please
Keep your eyes and your hands on me
My sunny days are kinda hazy
And I'll be waitin' for an angel to come save me
Lord please
Keep your eyes and your hands on me
And I've been lookin' for the sunshine
And I know one thing that I'm yours and that you're mine

[Verse 2: Liquid Assassin]
Lord it's me, you got a second?
Gettin' crazy on my neighbourhood not to mention?
A lot of people die over money and greed
That's become a big problem if you ask me
Me and my girl split
She's really over with
Had to love for 4 years
I wish I could show a ring
Nieces and my nephews are gettin' older quick
And I'm always on tour so I never get a hug or kiss
I think about my brother
Yeah, he's doin' good
Married, with some kids
I'll do it if I could
Yeah I'm writing everyday makin' rapwork
Call my third gun charge, yeah it hurts
Lord, I know you mad
Cause I don't learn my lesson
I ain't pray enough
Can't handle my depression
Give me guns for agression and I'm always stressin'
Sincerely yours, right back when you'll get a second

[Verse 3: Liquid Assassin]
Lord!
So depressed, I got nowhere to run
Feelin' like no future for my mama and son
Everytime drop a leave drama comes
I'll never get a break or pause like a (?)
So me yellin' at the top of my lungs
Everytime pissed when I go to shop for guns
I ain't doin' backup
Still watchin' for us
Sometimes rock by a screamin' for the God above (Lord!)
Done so bad, I don't get life
Feel like I could pull the blade to my windpipe
See me just prayin' that things might get right
Give me pen and pad LA's sit right?
Lord I speak
You got me through
Everything fall apart and I try to do
Rap won't stop, I won't lie to you
To the day I die I sit beside you
