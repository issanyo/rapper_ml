[Verse 1:]
I'm watching you every move
Right through the window, wherever you are (aha)
You look through your rear view
Like you see me looking / when you're in your car
And you can feel that / someone's watching
Can you feel my love?
And I don't call it stalking
Girl / you're all I'm thinking of!
Feeling strong to me
With it you're not on to me
Is it wrong of me?
But if I had the chance / I'd be sure to tell you

[Hook]
I love you / I Love You / I LOVE YOU
More than you will ever know
More than you will ever know
I love you to death
And I'll be watching you / be watching you
More than you will ever know
More than you will ever know
(x2)

[Verse 2:]
I hope this don't get ugly
When we finally meet / I hope you love me
Don't act like you're above me
Think you know that I'm watching
You bend over more
That was me / right behind ya
At the grocery store
I walked up / you walked in
Wish I was in the bed
So I can tuck you in
But I ain't / got that lucky
So I'll just be / outside of your house if you want me
Screaming...

[Hook]
I love you / I Love You / I LOVE YOU
More than you will ever know
More than you will ever know
I love you to death
And I'll be watching you / be watching you
More than you will ever know
More than you will ever know
(x2)

[Verse 3:]
The funny thing about it / think about it
Me and you / could be together / think about it
I sit inside my car and I / dream about it
I know I can't do a / thing about it
Yo / you're so precious maybe that's why / I love you to death
I smell your scent / when I'm taking a breath
I watch your every step / and make sure you get / home at night
Just make sure that door is looked up tight
Cause I might be / tempted to creep it
Finally get the sleep in
Just think of how much time we can spend
In my head / it's been a lifetime
You'll never find a love like mine
Know where you can hide it, I can't find it
I'm coming to meet you tonight
Yeah / I can't take it no more
It don't matter if you lock your front door
Here I come baby

[Hook]
I love you / I Love You / I LOVE YOU
More than you will ever know
More than you will ever know
I love you to death
And I'll be watching you / be watching you
More than you will ever know
More than you will ever know
(x2)
