[Verse 1]
10 year old boy single mother 2 black parents
Parenthood, slowly substituted by the crack era
Momma in the back, eviction notice on the front door
Fightin' over school, because what I see at home she don't know
We got nowhere to live, I ended up on my sisters front porch
Damn, she just a kid herself, tryin' to raise her young bro
Stripped of any childhood, I quickly learned the ropes though
Misdameanour, burglary, I need to find the front door
Fell behind my senior year, cause all I knew is crack sold
Same year my son was born, but all I knew I knew was trap more
Had another baby out of town I didn't asked for
Same month I got shot, just inches from my backbone
My nigga called him M, and they won't be sendin him back home
Reality was checked when I finally made him back home
Went and got my diploma, decided to leave that crack alone
Picked up a pen and pad, now I'm destined to get my rap on

[Hook]
Struggle, grind, pain, faith, triumph
Focus, drive, game, relief, triumph

[Verse 2]
4 years, 4 kids later down the line
My progression is my profession I'm doin' shows with the N9ne
My momma is tryin' to kick it, my sister she's doin' fine
And I'm makin' my way through life no longer blinded
Wait, a minor setback, this supposed to be friend of mine
Emptied the clip on me, one night when a friendly fight
Turned personal, guess he wasn't my friend after all
After a brawl, he hit my 3 times and I wouldn't fall
Made it through with a blessin', karma with no confession
Believin' my body armor is made of faith from the heavens
Flipped over 5 times, in the van without a belt on me
Escaped without a scratch, don't know what the lord has prepared for me
Just last summer was faced with another death to be
MJ's deceased, I love you and may you rest in peace
Gun shots rain and got it through my shirt, they were recklessly
I'm here to send a message that every day is a blessing each

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
And to the present day I'm so lucky to have my family
Strict and with a career lookin' solid, for where I planned to be
All of my children love me, concrete, foundation
I steadily rise above every trial and tribulation
My nigga done made it home after 16 straight
With a sound body, sound mind after 16 straight
Innocent but never told after 16 straight
If I had it I'd give em a hundred and 16 K
My momma is doin' beautiful and this shit's great
My pop's a part of my life, now is this shit's fate
I'm takin care of my family, I've since missed days
Of a young boy all alone, I've since been saved
Glad to give you my struggle, had to share my defiance
Glad to give you my pain, I'm closer to my alliance
Got it off of my chest, a weight is lifted I'm flyin'
I had to witness defeat in order for me to triumph

[Hook]
