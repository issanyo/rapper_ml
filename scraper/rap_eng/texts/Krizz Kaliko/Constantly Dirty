[Speech: Tech N9ne]
Yeah man
Niggas think it's all peaches and cream
Shit's hard right now man, it's real shit
Me and my Rogue Dogs man on this one
We stay constantly dirty, grittin' for our shit
Y'know what I'm shizzlin'?

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Ain't nobody ever gave me a thang in my lifetime
So I'm on my own, standin' strong, holdin' chrome
Disrespect my Villians, get 'em gone, early mo'n
On the co'n, get my hustle on
I stays dirty - chippin', choppin', flippin' birdies
I'm pushin' thirty, vision clear, I'm never blurry
Plottin' plans, strategic mission, I'm on my toes
I stays with fam my mans, to shake these fuckin' foes
Lord knows all the different situations, trials and tribulations
Aggravations that a nigga's facin'
I get complacent that's my ass, I'm a memory
They spillin' liquor on the curb when they mention me
But they're ain't no fear in me, get it how you live
That's if you hearing me then dug down and dig
Lace your boots man, prepare for the struggle
Stay in them trenches, hella dirty, grit and hustle

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

[Verse 2: Bakarii]
Nigga
I got a pocket full of G's, I'm constantly servin'
My nina knock him to his knees, I'm constantly dirty
Super Villian, check my powers, I get the early worm
Chop with choppers, lose the coppers with just a single turn
True to life, through the mic, they got me tellin' stories
With the fame and the lights, I feed my territory
Gutter livin' with precision, them busters know they phony
Flip my profit keep on rockin' it for my dead homies
They wanna follow my shadow and waddle in the mud
It's the infallible cannibal with the dirty gloves
"Absolute" with this "Power" they call me realistic
Savage Bakarii still comin' up off that fetal living
Givin' my life, to the night, on the dirty
All my might, when it's right, then I strike on them early
Twisted like livin' dirty, super savage, I'm out to get that bread
Gutter livin, that's my habit until I rest my head

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

[Verse 3: Txx Will]
Which one of y'all can I holler at when it's time to pay rent?
And who you think's gonna loan me money when my last bread is spent?
I got an even shorter list of people to call on when I'm in a pinch
So I might just walk around with my jaws clenched like The Grinch
I'm, headed for trouble 'cause I can't sit here and struggle
How do I bubble if I don't get out and hustle?
I'm in the wind put the spud on my muzzle
Put on my hood, grab my gloves and my shovel
Tie up my boots because the mud it gets thick
And hit a lick so quick, they think I love this shit
It's real life gutter livin', nigga comin' straight from the brain
Some handle the pressure and others break from the pain
It's been fifteen other damnedest and ain't nothin' changed but the weather
Times' still gettin' harder and niggas can't stick together
All through my teens, my twenties, even when I'm thirty
T-Will'll be gritty, grimey, constantly dirty

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Yo! Ain't nobody gave me nothin' but God
He gave me talent, these civilians perpetrating the fraud
That point is valid, got niggas sayin' they made me
The only thing that was made was music 'cause nobody ever properly paid me
Don't get it twisted, that little money was appreciated
It got me out there again, glad that's alleviated
But the nigga that say I didn't have a followin'
Before Mitchell Bade hit the streets must be inebriated
Soon as Mitch hit, it hit!
Because we some talented motherfuckers but they still talk shit
Keep that shit low black - that shit be getttin' back
To a nigga that will fight for you at the drop of a hat
I tried to tell 'em, let me do this here
They talkin' like they don't want Nina gettin' through this year
I'm still strugglin' hard, how can niggas disregard? I'm thirty!
Watch what you say when you speak to little birdies
I'm constantly dirty

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle, you heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Constantly dirty
Constantly dirty
Constantly dirty
Constantly dirty
Constantly dirty
Constantly dirty
Constantly dirty
Constantly dirty

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothin', I'm on my own
