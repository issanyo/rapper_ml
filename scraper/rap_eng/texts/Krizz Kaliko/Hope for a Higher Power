[Intro: spoken by Jim Jones]
“The world- The Kingdom suffers violence, and the violent shall take it by force. If we can’t live in peace, then let’s die in peace. (Applause.)
We’ve been so betrayed. We have been so terribly betrayed
So my opinion is be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we are not committing suicide; it’s a revolutionary act.”

[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Grandma told me the good book said
In the last days get ready for the ten plagues
1st, the rivers will be ran with red
2, 3, and 4, dead frogs will 'cause lice and flies
Sick livestock is 5 the living they must fight for their lives
6, 7, and 8, a boil storms a fire and locusts
9 is darkness, so dark it's hard for you to focus
And 10 is death of the firstborn
If I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point
To get at me and battle me, maybe have this verse torn
How will this curse form?
Well, Creationism and Darwinism been at it forever
'Bout at it I got nothin' but hurt for 'em
'Cause really nobody knows when you live
Then you die where your body goes
If it's Hell or it's Heaven
6 or the 7, well I'll keep the nina for all the foes in a gamble
That's what life is and it's hard to handle
When the bible says worship this but the scripture's written by man though
So when man destroys us the word might not stand so
'Til that day I'm just gon' protect my fam with ammo

[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]
If there is a final hour

And at the height of their power
(God) will send an angel to destroy them

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I've been looking for something supernatural for a long time now
But I never got proof that a spiritual realm existed, wanted to find how
Everybody sure of a supreme being, are people just seeing things?
Wondering if we get wings, seems sick to believe in an extreme king
I know it sounds far fetched, every night I put knees on the carpet
Then I pray to who's up with the star set
'Cause the Earth in its self is a target
For destruction, for combustion
'Cause there ain't too many you can trust in
Think of all the women losing their husbands
In Iraq a lot of killing and suffering
What I hope for, seemed folklore
When the enemy kills and gloat more
'Cause they killin' us off in this hoax war
Then I wake up yellin' and my throats sore
'Cause the fight's there, it's a nightmare
If it come to me, I'm in my snipe wear
If a bullet give my lung a slight tear
I wanna believe that the light's there
So all you Christians don't get mad at me
I just hope your mystical magical miracles work in catastrophes
And this ain't blasphemy, but artillery is my strategy
I hope for a higher power when I look at all these tragedies

[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]
If there is a final hour

I will never follow the beliefs of man, why?
Because man destroys everything in his path

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Oh what a miracle, angels and demons
But the only miracle is that people keep believin'
Right hand on the bible, left hand on my rifle
Keep that for my rivals and evil disciples
Expand your mission, man to women
When they attack do you plan to give in
Or do you do like I do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition
People like us, piece and knife up
'Cause we got evil to sweep and wipe up
Devils and demons and humans, irrelevant
So if they lookin' deceiving I bust
I hope that the higher power is watching over me
'Cause we young people don't see faith like most the older see
If he or she is listenin', a mere sign can spark me
But if the laws in the bible are bogus, then prepare for anarchy
Worst case scenario is never ever was a higher power
So in the midst of chaos now, the only real savior is fire power

[Hook: Girl & Krizz Kaliko]
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo, what about you?

[Outro: Spoken by Jim Jones]
“I, with respect, die with a degree of dignity. Lay down your life with dignity. Don’t lay down with tears and agony. There’s nothing to death. It’s like Mac said, it’s just stepping over to another plane. Don’t be this way. Stop this hysterics.”
