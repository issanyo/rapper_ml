[Intro:]
Ooh
Can you send your love?
Okay, Kali baby
And anyway you gotta do it

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & (Kortney Leveringston)]
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love
I wanna, I wanna send your love
Baby, send your love
Send your love

(Would you send your love to me?)
Send your love

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I got your message when you tweeted me
And you're askin' me when I'm free
Said you left it in the form of a letter
You e-mailed me to make me feel better
I replied with LOL and smiley face
I can update my status when I'm at yo place

[Kortney Leveringston]
That means face time with you and me
When you upgrade to 4G
You gotta send your love

[Chorus:]
Send your love
Send your love
Baby... your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko & (Kortney Leveringston)]
Use me as a hotspot
Use me when your call drops
Choose me as your Facebook friend
(I'll poke you all over again)

[Chorus:]
Gotta send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Baby, send your love
Send your love
Send your love
Send your love to me, girl
Send your love
Send your love

[Verse 3: Kortney Leveringston]
Just let me Skype with you tonight (tonight)
We're free to...
'Cus the feeling right
And I will text you some more pictures tonight
I want you to send your love

[Chorus:]
Would you send your love?
Send your love
Yea yea
'Cus I need it baby
Send your love
Send your love
Yea
Just send your love
Send your love
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko & (Kortney Leveringston)]
(Krizz)
Wussup?
(Do you love me?)
Tonight I do
(Shut up boy, you better be glad I love the nighttime)
