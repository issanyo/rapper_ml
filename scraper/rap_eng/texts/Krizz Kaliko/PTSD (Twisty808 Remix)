Tech N9ne ft Twisty808 - PTSD

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me offly rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A verticle leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: Twisty808]
They keep tellin’ me SLOW DOWN
The way my past is creepin’ I WON’t DROWN
Sanity has me hearin’ all these GHOST SOUNDS
My mental is an echo
Put me in check or I WILL LET LOOSE
TIE THIS NOOSE before I GET YOU
A tazmanian devil when I spaz as it just breaks through
I’m HOLDIN MYSELF BACK
Kolonopin keeps me subdue
The mayhem that pursues
Keeps my judgement in hot pursuit
Is my METHOD CONDEMIN MY LESSON
My roots make me feel BATTLE PROOF
IF YOU GET IN MY LANE
There only is one absolute
RESULT IS COCK AND I AIM
No testimony if I execute
IS THIS WAR WHAT YOU WANT?
Nobody wins we all lose
Consent is OVER-RATED
Forgive me if I FORGET TO CHOOSE
I’m gettin’ sick of all these doctors
Tellin’ me what pills to pop
The way that I feel makes me want to wake up dead for real
Almas Muertas no Tienen la Alegria!!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
