[Intro: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Dedicated to all the DJ's all over the world, man
(One for the treble, two for the bass
Come on Tecca Nina, let's rock this place)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Tech's in the place, everybody get mainy
Punks better cuff your lady, can't nobody tame me
Blame me, for keepin' her runny eyed rainy
Ladies used to hate me, now they comin' out they panties
Girls on the jock (Check), pocket full of socks (Check)
Got a fat knot (Check), somethin' gone squat (Yeah)
Down, puttin' it down, down for the block?
Tryin' to be hot, but you flop
Wanna be shot to the top but you not DWAMN!!!
I ain't never seen so much green
Than when I seen when my team hit the scene
It must be a dream
Hit the stage, everybody holler
Gettin' throwed, rippin' shows for a bigger dollar
Father, I donâ€™t wanna leave nobody toothless
Cause they greedy in the middle of what I do best
You finna' to see me in the TV with a few guest
We 'bout to bubble baby, get you waterproof vest

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, baby
'Bout to bubble, baby
'Bout to bubble, baby
We got you, lady
And drinkin' and smokin'
And humpin' and likin' it
And drinkin' and smokin'
And humpin' and likin' it

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yo, get ya ID, passport, state skippin'
All around the world, busy with the bass hittin'
We ain't come for bustin' heads, yeah we hate trippin'
When we through rockin' the shows, man we chase kittens
J's on my feet, car full of beats
Trunk full of heat, Caribou in the seat
Frown, you can make us all clown in the street
Gimme the beat and you leakin'
No mercy for the haters that weep
On to the next, Minnesota to the Netherlands
Veterans, caravans, gettin' cheddar, man
Round the world in a day, off in LA
Oklahoma, Dallas, Kansas City to the Bay
Everybody hyphy, the South really like me
Ill Bill got it where the East Coast invites me
Sets in the air when the mood really strikes me
Hey, we 'bout to bubble, so embedded in your psyche

[Hook]
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, baby
'Bout to bubble, baby
'Bout to bubble, baby
We got you, lady
And drinkin' and smokin'
And humpin' and likin' it
And drinkin' and smokin'
And humpin' and likin' it

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Hey, B-boys hit the floor with it
Off in Jamaica let me see ya heel toe with it
Clown and crump with it, A-Town stomp with it
At the set, jugglettes make they double D's jump to this
House on the hill (Check), hella tip drills (Check)
Paul Wall said he'd do me up a red grill (Yeah)
Busta Bust circlin' the 5-6 'ville (Yes)
40 water, he told me a lot in this business for real
Stormin', in Salt Lake City performin' for Mormons
Out of their garments before the morning, I'm torment
Leavin' 'em torn, mess with the bull you get the horns
Nina gets with a beauty, that's disarming
Misery's behind me, labels tryin' to sign me
Ain't too many who don't know just who the Tech N9ne be
Is she lookin' for somethin' with a future so shiny?
Kansas City, Missouri is where she gone find me

[Hook]
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, baby
'Bout to bubble, baby
'Bout to bubble, baby
We got you, lady
And drinkin' and smokin'
And humpin' and likin' it
And drinkin' and smokin'
And humpin' and likin' it

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
(And drinkin' and smokin')
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
(And humpin' and likin' it)
'Bout to bubble, 'bout to bubble
