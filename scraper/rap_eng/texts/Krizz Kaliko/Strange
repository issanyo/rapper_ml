[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Breathe deeply my friend
You're normal, take it easy
You're only strange, you know

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't the same
When no one remembers your name
And nobody knows where you came from
And they don't applaud you
They all ignore you
They only know that you're strange
And nobody knows who to blame
And everyone all looks the same so
They don't applaud you
They all ignore you
They only know that you're strange

You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
Everybody
I see you lookin' with ya lookin' ass

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Gotta get 'em off for the reggie
'Cause I'm a little heavy-er
And I never thought the industry would let me in her
And they know I'm no beginner
So I eat a rapper like it's my dinner (Kali!)
And I used to get stares from them pair of eyes
Vitiligo get them paralyzed
We sing cling the thing is I am sterilized
He sing sing and scare 'em they terrified
So which way does he go?
Ball til him fall every crawl in a hole and
I won't stop even if y'all tell him no
The world so cold I make them fall with a quote (OK)
Spider K's a rhyme vet, I'm next (OK)
Thought only pretty boys would get laid but I'm sex (OK)
It's almost over for this industry
The blueprint is Strange Music and you know they mention me
We in your pocket like we're loose change, the new thang
Is you could make 'em love it when you're strange

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't the same
When no one remembers your name
And nobody knows where you came from
And they don't applaud you
They all ignore you
They only know that you're strange
And nobody knows who to blame
And everyone all looks the same so
They don't applaud you
They all ignore you
They only know that you're strange

You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
Everybody
I see you lookin' with ya lookin' ass

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Fat guys are in now
Everybody love the guy the thing can't bend down
So if you got your chin down
Anybody can make it and if you got it they hatin' so now
K.O.D. and Seepage make 'em show they cleavage, freakish
Maybe they bust been 'bout to bust and so we cause the leakage
'Cause it's unfair to be this rarity
Thought I would be some charity case
The industry'll be scared of my face
'Cause I don't fit in to any of they categories
This fat boy'll, show 'em how them independent underdogs make them noises
I was real hard, now I'm real easy to look at
Breezies don't think I look real fat
My CD ain't easy to put back
See we gods to you lames
Roll odd to a strange
We're not gonna change
Our shit bangs, nigga!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't the same
When no one remembers your name
And nobody knows where you came from
And they don't applaud you
They all ignore you
They only know that you're strange
And nobody knows who to blame
And everyone all looks the same so
They don't applaud you
They all ignore you
They only know that you're strange

You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
Everybody
I see you lookin' with ya lookin' ass

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I be the one to be not normal
Baking a bitch in my hot caramel
Shaking the chick and I got carnal
Taking a flick and I shot porno
Naked and wicked, it's not formal
Waking the sick when I got born on the funny farm
Warned, I'd be armed like Arnold
In the morn' got to horn the corn holes
Look at the six and the seven on my arm
Though nigga totally torn yo
Awfully gifted, I'm boss in this shit
Put you quick in a coffin with this
Awesome script then I'm knockin' this chick
When I get this pop and take a pic
And never know when I'm odd from exist
Ants in your pants, I'll make ya dance, a hip hop chemist
I'm rockin' this bitch
And you niggas is far from it
Mr. Mojo Risin' told me to flip the flow and go rhymin'
So I went to get the dough in no timin'
Everybody gets the bro, they go N9nin'!
Ordinary people think we fuckin' insane, hell yeah!
So you punk muthafuckas gonna be stuck when I reign!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It ain't the same
When no one remembers your name
And nobody knows where you came from
And they don't applaud you
They all ignore you
They only know that you're strange
And nobody knows who to blame
And everyone all looks the same so
They don't applaud you
They all ignore you
They only know that you're strange

You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
Everybody
I see you lookin' with ya lookin' ass
