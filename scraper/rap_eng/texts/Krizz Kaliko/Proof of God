[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I can only imagine
What heavens like (nothing like this)
And we can only imagine
From the other side (nothing like this)

Can you tell me what it's all about
When I'm on my knees I cry out
Why is the world like this?
And what did I miss?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
People die, children cry
People lie, I don't know why
I think you would be feeling the same
If you were the one in my place

I wanna love you
I wanna know you
I want to tell you things I think you're telling me

I wanna meet you
I wanna see you
I don't want it to be this hard
To see this proof of God

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Can you tell me what it's all about
And why the world is overcrowded
My days are gray and look the same
Feels like it's not going changing

Can you tell me what it's all about
Some people gotta do without
Maybe I'll teach the world to sing
Then everybody live my dream (Yeah!)

[Hook]
People die, children cry
People lie, I don't know why
I think you would be feeling the same
If you were the one in my place

I wanna love you
I wanna know you
I want to tell you things I think your telling me

I wanna meet you
I wanna see you
I don't want it to be this hard
To see this proof of God

[Prayer: Brother K.T]
Praise God my brother
Dear heavenly father right now in the name of Jesus
I come over to you Lord of Grace
Lord I come asking great blessings and favor right now for this young man

And lord whatever the situation may be, sometimes it may be cloudy
And we may not understand life's situations lord but I know that your in
Complete control of his career, his family, his finances Holy spirit Lord and even

Favor, favor, favor
In Jesus name I pray, Amen
