[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Well alright
It was once said that uh
You can't stop what can't be stopped
Or uh
You can't kill what can't be killed
You know what I'm saying
We're gonna give you another Tale From The Sick
Cause that is what this is
And this here is my boy Prozak hailing all the way from  Saginaw, Michigan
He is The Hitchcock Of Hip-hop

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Don't think I hear them plannin, To try to reach the planet
I roll with Strange Music, bitch we carry automatic
To all you hating faggots, who wants to start some static
I call me Quick Quick, but clips can make you drip with maggots
No method to this madness, I do this for the thrill
I still do PDM, right now I'm the solo kill
Relax and take these pills, should help to ease those ills
You mind will spin in circles, 'briate your brain stays still
I'm still the same old motherfucker screaming fuck fame!
Mob underground and hell and marching over red flames
So tell me who's to blame, the planet as a whole
The Corporations gain, now watch the panic grow

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See I've been down this road
I'm still a million miles from where I'm going
Watcha think of me?
Watcha see in me?
Who I'm tryna be?
And I'm still grinding
See I've been down this road
I'm still a million miles from where I'm going
Who I wanna be
It's what I'm gonna be
And if you trouble me
I keep riding

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Psychotic rhymes that show, malotic rhymes that flow
Exploding microphones with schizophrenic episodes
I'm aiming at your soul, you feel the darkness grow
They call me Hitchcock, the modern day Edgar Allen Poe
I love them Gothic bitches, they are stripping at my shows
I hang with misfits, and weirdos, and also Juggalos
Radio stations keep hatin' because of statements I'm making
Like they mistake me for Satan, why must I be forsaken?
So keep on conversating, I'm here to haunt the nation
I am the ghost of those who chose to pose the Declaration
I'm here to fight for freedom, I'm here to fight for speech
And trust me we can beat them, we own the streets

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See I've been down this road
I'm still a million miles from where I'm going
Watcha think of me?
Watcha see in me?
Who I'm tryna be?
And I'm still grinding
See I've been down this road
I'm still a million miles from where I'm going
Who I wanna be
It's what I'm gonna be
And if you trouble me
I keep riding


[Verse 3: Prozak]
This life is critical, these times are biblical
Sin is habitual as these rhymes are political
Some say I'm cynical, some say I'm criminal
Some say I'm heaven sent, behold the spiritual
Exquisite and spiritual, yeah wicked and lyrical
The source of my material, okay now here we go
Sometimes I wake up screaming and even if I'm dreaming
I'm pleading for reasons to belive is this Prozak or Steven I'm wheezing
I'm barely breathing pleasing these demons I'm self-defeating
I'm freezing this heathen from perceiving these thoughts that I'm receiving
I feel faint but I'm bleeding I can't take it I'm leaving
Is this fate that I'm meeting or these mushrooms I'm eating?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
See I've been down this road
I'm still a million miles from where I'm going
Watcha think of me?
Watcha see in me?
Who I'm tryna be?
And I'm still grinding
See I've been down this road
I'm still a million miles from where I'm going
Who I wanna be
It's what I'm gonna be
And if you trouble me
I keep riding
