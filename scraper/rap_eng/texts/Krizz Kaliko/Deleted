[Intro]
Yeah (yeah)
(x4)

[Verse 1]
Say what you gotta say, yeah
Turn around and run the other way (other way), yeah
Read it, read it, yeah you said it
That's the price I gotta pay
So keep doin' what you're doin' if it feels right
Is that really what it takes to make you sleep at night? (Alright)
You didn't have to look me up
Now I'm looking down to try

[Hook]
You don't like what you see? (Deleted)
I don't know what you want me to be (Deleted)
And I came here to do me (Deleted)
And so if you don't agree

[Post-Hook]
I could just keep it inside, you could ignore what I said
No, I got nothing to hide, plus you don't know where I stand
It's not about you, it's about me
You Actin' Like you Know, so you can go

[Bridge]
Tear me down, tear me down, tear me down
Let me down, let me down

[Verse 2]
Can you say it to my face?
Kinda hurts me, but it fades
I'm feeling kinda like "What'ev"
Keep on throwing shade
So keep doin' what you're doin' if it feels right
Is that really what it takes to make you sleep at night? (Alright)
See I love it, love it, love it
The city'll see, watch me rise above it
