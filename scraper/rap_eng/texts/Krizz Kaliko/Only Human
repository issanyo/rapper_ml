Intoxicated
Feeling violated
While im living in this life
I dont even got a minute to enjoy myself
So bad in dept
Going over my head
Court calling to collect
So broke
Im here to confess
Another court count
Check that i bounced
Friends doing me dirty
Stuck up in a mess
I dont know what to do feeling so confused
Im tring my best hommie
How bout you
Walking this path
Even without a clue
Got alot of people saying that im rude
Cause when i say my two sense its true
Even when i tell them fuck you
I just take another shot
And smoke a doobie
Living my life like a fucking movie
And all the ones i thought where my hommies
Used me
And all the ones i feel in love with turned to groupies
All this type of shit
Is what makes me loopie
Than you wonder what drives me insane
Trinna stay focused
Keep myself in motion
I stay devoted
With mad comotion
Al pachino
If you fucking knew me
Im a little bit by polar
But only when you make my attitude roll over
Turning good from bad talking all that crap
You just pissed off
Cuase i told you to kiss my ass
Got snakes in the grass gotta cut that shit
Reminising my past
Everytime i spit
Got friends and family that make me sick
Talking behind my back
Like i dont do shit
But everything i did was by myself

I use to care
But now i dont
I can only do so much
Im not perfect and im not a clone
Only doing what i can
Everything i did my efforts shown
I got many flaws
Im only human
Im only human

Check it out
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to loose
Im trinna kick
But i really ain't with it
If i can smoke a spliff to lift it
Take another sip im blifted
As i glitch and are brain is gifted
See i know that im holy and dont let nothing control me
And meant it
But sin can't be prevented
You tell me
Feel like i smelled and sniffed it
Religious but lately been feeling different
Im independent
My love ones defended
Its sorta like saint asented
To the paper pended
Some may be affended
Cause i ain't david sented
I say to the lord find favor
And not to mention
Ill stay a prayed up pinchman
Like the clocks ticking on me
The way the world be living on me
This ain't the way im trina be living hommie
Feel like i got the nuse to my throat trinna hussle
I feel like im the one doing dope
As a fine line
Trina figure out and find time
Life on the run
Ducking one time
But i got one body one mind
Life is turbiling
And im looking for the sunshine
Irs hitting me up again
Mira locking me up its enough of this
Mid as well picture me suffering
Migrane can kill it with bufferen noisomeness
Pack it up
Pack it in
I came to win
Been down since the beggining
Are feeling i try to refute them
Demons we buke them
Im only human

I use to care
But now i dont
I can only do so much
Im not perfect and im not a clone
Only doing what i can
Everything i did my efforts shown
I got many flaws
Im only human
Im only human
