[Hook]
The bills that I owe, places I go, people I know
Sippin' real slow, so we don't go out of control
I'm turnin' up 'till it's over
I don't want this to ever be over

[Verse 1]
I've been turned down
And quiet too long (yeah!)
And now I need my speakers blown
From gettin' cussed out
Then I'll play my song
It makes me just forget about

[Hook]
The bills that I owe, places I go, people I know
Sippin' real slow, so we don't go out of control
I'm turnin' up 'till it's over
I don't want this to ever be over
So please don't blow my-my hi-high
Bite your tongue when you're near me
Or give me like 50 feet (O-Kay!)
(Whoa-oa-oa)
Cause I need sunshine around me
And right now you're killing me (O-Kay!)
(Whoa-oa-oa)

[Verse 2]
And I'm gettin' burned out
Been down for too long
A little drink puts me where I belong
Ey! Don't bring me down
I'm try'na move on
Turn up 'till I forget about..

[Hook]
The bills that I owe, places I go, people I know
Sippin' real slow, so we don't go out of control
I'm turnin' up 'till it's over
I don't want this to ever be over
So please don't blow my-my hi-high
Bite your tongue when you're near me
Or give me like 50 feet (O-Kay!)
(Whoa-oa-oa)
Cause I need sunshine around me
And right now you're killing me (O-Kay!)
(Whoa-oa-oa)

[Bridge]
Cause I can do whatever I want
Shut up
Shut up, just shut up
And you can do whatever you want
Shut up
Shut up, just shut up
And I can do whatever I want
Shut up
Shut up, just shut up
And you can do whatever you want
Shut up
Shut up, and just forget about

[Hook]
The bills that I owe, places I go, people I know
Sippin' real slow, so we don't go out of control
I'm turnin' up 'till it's over
I don't want this to ever be over
So please don't blow my-my hi-high
Bite your tongue when you're near me
Or give me like 50 feet (O-Kay!)
(Whoa-oa-oa)
Cause I need sunshine around me
And right now you're killing me (O-Kay!)
(Whoa-oa-oa)
Bite your tongue when you're near me
Or give me like 50 feet (O-Kay!)
(Whoa-oa-oa)
Cause I need sunshine around me
And right now you're killing me (O-Kay!)
(Whoa-oa-oa)
