[Hook: Iceprince]
I wish I could find you
Wish I could find you [x3]
All over again
I wish I could find you
Wish I could find you [x2]
All over again [x3]
I wish I could find you
All over again

[Verse 1: Iceprince]
Yeah, see I feel lost in this world
Since you left me in this place with your girls
And I heard that you're in a better place
No hurts, no pains, just diamonds and pearls
Yes mama, yes daddy
Its been a really long time since you bought me a sweaty
I remember so clear how we sit on the floor
With the candle lights waiting for my mama's spaghetti, yeah
Dad left first and he said bye
He told me we could be together maybe sometime
I hope he's alright and things are going fine
I hope he's proud in heaven copping some of these lines
Please mama tell dad that his son's doing well
That his son's bought two cars as well
And don't forget to tell him about Oleku
That's the song he'll be proud of if he knew that I was strong

[Hook: Iceprince]
I wish I could find you
Wish I could find you [x3]
All over again
I wish I could find you
Wish I could find you [x2]
All over again [x3]
I wish I could find you
All over again

[Verse 2: Iceprince]
Hey daddy have you seen your wife
She got even more pretty you should see your wife
Did a very good job with your kids for real
She made sure we had a roof and a three square meal
See everybody left
And she became the man
And even when I was bad she met my demands
She told me I was great
She said I had a gift
She gave me a tree when all I needed was a stick
So please tell her that I'm missing her face
I still remember when I brought her up with me to the stage, yeah
She was really happy facing the crowd
She told me the next day that she really was proud
Oh mama I really feel the pain
Cause ever since you left its not been the same
There's no sunshine and not even the rain
And no amount of joy here can take away the pain

[Hook: Iceprince]
I wish I could find you
Wish I could find you [x3]
All over again
I wish I could find you
Wish I could find you [x2]
All over again [x3]
I wish I could find you
All over again

[Outro: Blessing Zamani]
Hi I'm Blessing Zamani
I'm the last child of my family
Ice Prince is my elder brother
And Julie is my elder sister
I miss my dad and mum so much
And I wish I could find them someday
I also want to thank God for strengthening my brother
And making him to be who he is today
I'm praying to God to keep protecting, guide and bless me, my brother and my sister
