[Verse 1: Tholwana]
Everybody fooling with the rand
Everybody finna plan
Chillin' cus I'm doing my thang
Everybody doing their thang
Everybody doing their thang
I'm just doing my thang

[Pre-Chorus: Tholwana]
Let the hills get higher
Some good, some bad days might've
Have your own desire
All my people gotta burn their fire now
Where do we go?
Float there, out where
Cold waters flow
We go, we go, we go, we go, we go, we go

[Chorus: Tholwana]
Do you wanna rock my boat?
Waves crash, got the antidote
And do you wanna float in the ocean?
And are you feeling my vibe and emotion?
(Yeah)
Do you wanna rock my boat?
Waves crash, got the antidote
And do you wanna float in the ocean?
And are you feeling my vibe and emotion?
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Gemini Major]
Girl, you know you give me that feeling
Everytime I see you on a weekend
Rainy July
A lot for my sky
She's like a wave in the ocean
Fly on my deepest emotions
Girl you on top of the raid
We got some [?]
They wanna run up my race
They cannot keep in my pace
And everytime I enter the place
[?] tie lace
Where do we go?
Highway, [?]

[Chorus: Tholwana, Gemini Major & Both]
Do you wanna rock my boat?
(Do you wanna rock my boat?)
Waves crash, got the antidote
And do you wanna float in the ocean?
And are you feeling my vibe and emotion?
(Yeah)
Do you wanna rock my boat?
(Do you wanna rock my boat?)
Waves crash, got the antidote
And do you wanna float in the ocean?
And are you feeling my vibe and emotion?
(Yeah)

[Verse 3: Ice Prince]
Ice
Me, I'm just doing my thing
Steady grinding and the steadier I put my game
I used to hold some [?] under the rain
Now you can tell that my stories are not the same
I've been gone for a minute
I'm back now
And I'm putting my heart into it
Never gon' back down
[?] speculating that the boy [?]
I was on a low game
Yo, in the background
Now I see the fakes and the snakes that done cut-grass
Brought a stop behind your back
Now tell me, who does that?
I be on my [?] with some some shorties and [?]
While we ride in the Mustang
Yeah, if you believe in yourself, then
Nobody else in the world can ever equal your belt
Got a beat in your cheast
A middle finger to the rest
Just keep doing your thing
It's all good, it's all better
Tholwana!

[Pre-Chorus: Tholwana]
Where do we go?
Float there, out where
Cold waters flow
We go, we go, we go, we go, we go, we go

[Chorus: Tholwana & Gemini Major]
Do you wanna rock my boat?
Waves crash, got the antidote
And do you wanna float in the ocean?
And are you feeling my vibe and emotion?
(Yeah)
Do you wanna rock my boat?
(Do you wanna rock my boat?)
Waves crash, got the antidote
And do you wanna float in the ocean?
And are you feeling my vibe and emotion?
(Yeah)

[Outro: Gemini Major]
Rock my boat
Floating, oh yeah
Feelin' my vibe in the ocean
