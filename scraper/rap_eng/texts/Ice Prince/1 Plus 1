INTRO
J-Town, make the track go bang, Ghana and Naija

VERSE 1 (Ice Prince)
Yea, Ok now I'm caught in the matrix
Them boys hating, they starting to say shit
Me and my goons stay flayer in a secret
I'm working that body and doing the day shift
I paint that picture naked
Baby you bad but you better than eight chicks
I wanna know you like we kinda related
That's the only way we can carry on to date dear
Ok we try go on, no hotel baby but me im an icon
They throw me punches like Tyson
That only proves that itâ€™s my turn
J.Town my (what), Crown (what)
They say we add weight as pounds run (what)
Blowing that money around town man (what)
Tell a badman stay down man (what)

Cutting more cheques,getting more sex
Money on roids thats why I flex
Living like a movie I'm on set
