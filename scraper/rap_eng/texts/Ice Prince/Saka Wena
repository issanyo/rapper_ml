[Pre-Hook: Nadia Nakai]
This girl so hot, that’s why I’m tryna cool down
And wena you’re not, that’s why you gotta move now
This girl so hot, that’s why I’m tryna cool down
And wena you’re not, that’s why you gotta

Saka, saka, saka wena

[Verse 1; Nadia Nakai]
Flow so cold but I’m so frightening
All these basics just wanna fight me
'Cause ndi muhle aba fana like me
Plus I’m yellow bone and I’m so enlightening
Jonga, these hips don’t lie
All of them they can’t deny
All of them they ask me why
Never met a girl so fly
Swag on diba, raps on ether, verse on preacher, flow ziya chisa
Voice on speaker, bank on pizza, verse ziya biza

[Verse 2: Ice Prince]
I think Nadia Nakai you should date the boy
If you walk in my shoes you gon' shake the soil
You know, I’m from the west it’s the place with oil
And I’m still feeling the best, let them hate us all you know
Now back to the topic of the baddest
Niggas finna talking to niggas up in the cameras
Little rappers coming up and they losing their manners
I’m a cannibal I cut you up with a thousand piranhas
It’s okay, I been drinking, I been chilling around, I been cleansing
I been smoking, I been thinking
I been Instagram-ing, big pimpin’
You already know that I’m always ready
And haters wanna carry me I’m always heavy
You know that I can lean you down, got you all sweaty
I’m the only sexy motherfucker with the palm belly
Give you that raw jelly
And everybody that cross the line is gon' get it, uh
I been vocal way before Nelly
I been focused, been killing the main loopers
I can make you fly I know a little of R-Kelly

[Verse 3: Nadia Nakai]
Ntombazane remix I killed it with ease
I even took shots well my aim is to please
You might look like but you ain’t fresh as I’m is
You might house the floor but I got the keys like
Hai sana uwrong’o, hai sana uwrong’o
I kill every song though
Bring out my dark side, Lupita Nyong'o
Y’all mad at the fact that I’m back
With my style and the swag on attack
Like (shisa)
And I’m mad with the raps
And I’m strapped with a mack that’s a fact
Like [?] got my Kim K on
Gave birth to hip hop, I’m a crazy mom
Man I wish me and you was spilling food for thought
Now tell me, who the game waiting on?

[Hook: Nadia Nakai]
Saka, saka, saka wena
Saka, saka, saka wena
Saka, saka, saka wena
Saka, saka, saka wena
