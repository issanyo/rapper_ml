[Verse 1: Sarkodie]
Ice Prince, you know say you be my guy
Aboki you be my real nigga 'til we die
And I’m keeping it real ‘cause I no go fi lie
I pray Chineke go take Wizkid high

At the end of the day we sow good seeds
So we no dey stay local we sell overseas
Priceless; to my homie KaySwitch
Refuse to be broke, walahi stay rich
We never go fall, yeah they wish

Verse 3: Ice Price

Leave me alone or go kiss my face
See Halima that girl was up but I wake her up with my morning face

And one day Ice Prince told me big bro we’ll one day fly
Since then the models wanna come say hi
Somehow the fun stay piling
I’m in the best trio
Yes you know who else of the abokis came to hip hop’s rescue
Bless to my new nephew, the next dude
The heir to the hip throne we are best to
Macbad with Jesse, the best 3
Maradona, pele and messi
Brymo got leaks like pepsi
Pryse complete the team, you can’t test we
Aliyu and Dangote, that’s my guys
Genevieve and Rita Dominic my wives
Stacking chips you can’t share my fries
Never take my place till I die!

[Verse 5: Khuli Chana]
Where Khuli Chana dey, hunger dey waka
Le dibra tsak’ le dima tsak’ le kana ka mme waka

Ha ona le kwale osa di bala, I got you covered till I die…
