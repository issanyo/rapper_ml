[Intro]
Ice prince zamani
Nigeria you ready?


[Verse 1]
I’ve been through the rain
Been through the pain
Been through a lot of shit
Been through the same
I’ve seen a plan to fall on the tunnel causing the rain
I’ve seen it to the top and i seen it fun in the game
Critics they criticize me and putting dirt on my name
My friends turn haters, they putting curse on the fame
Spit in my dre shit and i spit i’m ah little wayne
And all i’m trying to do is just feed on my little grains
Like put a rap on this field and this haters tear it apart
These chains kinda heavy, i either wear it or not
These fans going crazy over the things that i pop
And then a nigga paid his bills from the hottest singles i drop
Last week i got a phone call
And here was my sister’s best friend say make i borrow am loan small
And if i tell her that i’m broke, that would be crazy
Cause for her mind my money long, i be like jay-z
And her text said “Ice, i hope you save me
School don dey close and guys dem wan parade me”
If i no provide her the radar, she might forsake me
Cause she thinks that i’m rich from a famous i’ve come and like me
But me sef gan
I’m trying to be stable
Find a girl from the moz and attract if i’m able
Finally go to the U.S and milk it like the cows do
So i can preach about it and put a smile on them, i’ll do that


[Hook]
A young kid from africa spit on your heart daily
Been to the prison, to see what the bars gave me
Shinning like the sun and i’ve been with the stars lately
Been through the fire, you see what the scars made me
Oh ohhhh ohhhh!
(Been to the prison, you see what the boss gave me
See what the boss, see what the boss gave me)
Oh ohhhh ooooohhhhh!
Yeah!
[Hook - Ruby Gyang]
All i see….(is stars and light)
Is stars and light (all i see)
All i see (all i see)
Is stars and light
Stars and light


[Verse 2]
Sometimes it feels cold like eight degrees
And sometimes the nigga getting J's for free
If i fall to the field, i’m not ashamed to leave
Cause sometimes a nigga need space to breath
Now they know my name o
I’m f*cking the same though
Now the niggas looking up to me
I’m like a rainbow
Walking in the desert until i’m watching the rain go
Cause niggas getting famous exactly just how the game goes
Blocka blocka blocka
The street they’re itching
And we just bought a chopper for the shits they speaking
Oh yes i pray for the bomba clad rasta who be standing my way
It’s different type of cloud that the boy cut from
And you don’t wanna go where the boy come from
Cause the boy drop ceiling when the boy drop bomb
He been killing rappers on the internet dot com
Now happy days gon’
All these rappers getting sulfurs like they kiss craze source
Me i’m spitting hot like a jew *** son
I still pray for my lord that i can be akon
So don’t p****
Cause i go a tiny temper, i was UK born
Oh you see the sparks i’m getting ignited
Jimmy jatt feel this, i’ll be more than excited
Yes…


[Hook]
Oh oh ohhhhh ohhhhh!
Oh oh ohhhhh ohhhhh!
All i see, all i seeeee
(All i see)
A young kid from africa spit on your heart daily
Been to the prison, you see what the boss gave me
Shinning like the sun and i’ve been with the stars lately
Been through the fire, you see what the scars made me
A young kid from africa spit on your heart daily
Been to the prison, you see what the boss gave me
Shinning like the sun and i’ve been with the stars lately
Been through the fire, you see what the scars made me


[Outro]
If there’s ever been a rap this fly
It had to be done by an M.I’s guy
If there’s ever been a rap this fly
It had to be done by an M.I’s guy
