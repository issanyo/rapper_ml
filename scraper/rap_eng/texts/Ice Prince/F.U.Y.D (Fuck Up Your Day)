No one can tell me behave
No one can tell me behave

[Verse 2 - Ice Prince]
Yeah
I started back in the day
Saving money for some Jays
Studio sessions at the bay with some crazy rappers that's ready to display
Now we flying all the way
Paris to LA
Lagos to pretoria
I'm sick and tired of these planes
Now hold up a second Dimplez let me switch it up real quick one time, bring the beat right back. You ready?
I'm 'bout to scare niggas
Tell 'em i deserve a chair nigga
Shawty tell me that she diggin my style coz I act like I don't really care nigga
And that's when I started to care nigga
I order champ and the beer nigga
I took her back to the hotel i wanted to bang but she wanted to chill nigga
I'm excited, i'm 'bout to get this pussy ignited
I'm 'bout to get this pussy on fire
Her best friend mad coz she wasn't invited
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day
Don't care what nobody say
I ain't playing with those games
You coming around and you better behave

[Chorus - Royal Empire]
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day
I'm 'bout to fuck up your day

[Bridge]
