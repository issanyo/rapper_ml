Chai!
Yes aii
They don't know
My mommy tell me say
Watch out for the snakes and watch out for the pythons
And jargo tell me say
Open up me soul, when the people turn the mic on
Zamani boy kill another one
Kicks with my louie and vuitton
Badman all of them around
Me take their words worth like ah dem quran
Charlie make i see space
Ati re the ball step
Make i introduce you to sammy, that be my jos friend
Rappers taking shots at me cause i'm killing i'm off them
Kpooyaka kpooyaka
Now this girl feeling like us fam
2015, na im be the question
My people dey anticipate who go be the next one
Well afterall, we know say allah dem go rig election
Upcoming artiste no fit afford money for session
See me i don't fear another man
Cuz if i don die today, i no go die tomorrow
Make dem open up my yarn
Cuz if i don cry today, i no go lie tomorrow
Jehovah don bless my ramadan
Put me on top my base na na na
Make dem open up my yarn
Put me on top my game oh lord!

And i wonder why
Some people dem thief money and dem ah carry dey go
I wonder why…
Some people dem ah sleep for bridge with no place to go
Politicians dem ah cover up the truth
We bringing up corruption in the youth
See the kind of money all of dem ah loot
Terrorist dem ah gather more recruit
Even if we diss them, shebi dem go listen
Before you know it, dem go say five billion is missing
And even if you suffer dem no go see am like big thing
Ask the people wey dey for jos, na we be victim
Zamani boy kill another one
And all their children instagram na louie and vuitton
See me no fear no badman, all of dem ah run
Government dey take their words but that one no be haram
See me i don't fear another man
Cuz if i don die today, i no go die tomorrow
Make dem open up my yarn
Cuz me i don cry today, i no go lie tomorrow
Jehovah don bless my ramadan
Put me on top my base na na na
Make dem open up my yarn
Put me on top my game oh lord!
They shoot ah magazine, ban the gate to youth
Na na na na na na rain fall down
They shoot ah magazine, ban the gate to youth
Na na na na na….kpooyaka!
They bring me down
Shebi dem go cure my craze
Get your juju make you carry am go
Jehovah dey surround my place
Yeah hey there
They call me ice prince zamani
Kids call me ish prish
They go like uncle ish prish
See me i don't fear another man
Cuz if i don die today, i no go die tomorrow
Make dem open up my yarn
Cuz me i don cry today, i no go lie tomorrow
Jehovah don bless my ramadan
Put me on top my base na na na
Make dem open up my yarn
Put me on top my game oh lord!
Okay
Me and my grip boyz
We no dey look face
And if you bite this omo
That one na tooth ache
See we are the warriors, we dey look up to 2face
But me and stickerboy na mostly hoodos we dey cook plate
Who gives a f*ck door; weak bar
Shebi na ice prince don dey become a big star
Shebi na meek mill don dey invite am come milly
How i go pay attention when niggas dey talk silly

Na na na na na na……sammy gyan!
Put me on top my game oh…
