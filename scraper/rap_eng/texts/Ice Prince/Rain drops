[Chorus]
Even when the rain don't drop in my hood
I still got a smile cause I know its all good
We gon' get it like eh eh eh eh eh [x2]
Even when the rain don't drop in my hood
I still got a smile cause I know its all good
We gon' get it like eh eh eh eh eh [x2]

[Verse 1]
Even when we're broke we know its alright
Ima still be in the club, Ima party all night
Ima still be with the boys talking about the last night
Ima still be catching fun with the girls on, skype
But I'm trying to getit right homie
I'm just trying to see the sun at the end of the night homie
Its all cheese and I'm tryna get a bite homie
I'm in the studio recording all night homie
Yeah, see life swings like a pendulum
They said life's a bitch, I found a friend in them
And when the rules go straight I try bending em
I'm only tryna ball homie, Ferdinand
So get your Femi Kuti on, blow your own trumpet
Cause nobody does it better with your own concept
I feel cool and I'm watching the snow blow
See life's going fast and I'm making my slow month

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They told me I can be the best if I work hard
And now I'm doing shows from Lagos to Johannesburg
Some times life go show like a hold up
I'm an example to the man home with no job
See you can be whoever
And you can be whatever
If I can get here, then you can do it better
I never say never
And I believe the weather
So if you act cool, Ima put on my sweater
You need more advice
Homie send me a letter, or maybe email
We can do this together
How I'm I making chedda
I'm shooting my bureta
If you got wings homie, I can lend you my feather
I know its really hard, sometimes its like a fight
But if you're winning from the heart then I salute your type
See you're a star, never let hay pollute your hype
Its all about you homie
The fruit is ripe

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
See life's like a photo nigga you gotta get your photo
You ain't got to drive nigga you gotta get your motto
Put yourself high, never see you on a low though
Get your sun, nigga show the world your logo
Yeah, homie you're all by yourself
So never let your life turn waste like a belt
The haters tryna block but you
You can make your laws
You can go from the patient to the one that got help
Bless
