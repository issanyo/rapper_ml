[Hook]
Bae coupe, bae couple
Bae coupe, bae couple
Bae coupe, bae couple
Bae coupe, bae couple
Bae coupe, bae couple
Bae coupe, bae couple
I need a hundred grand so I can buy bae a coupe
Bae coupe, bae couple
Bae coupe, bae couple
Bae coupe, bae couple
I need a hundred grand so I can buy bae a coupe

[Verse 1: Ice Prince]
Bae coupe, bae coupe
I need a hundrred grand so I can buy bae a coupe
And on the other hand a bullet to these lame dudes
I showered down the earth
It's time these cowards got their rain boots
They shoot, they shoot
And we been doing ey'thing that we can, they do
But stay true and hustle hard only remain you
F ahead and really we ain't talking if it ain't cool
Bae coupe, bae coupe
It's all I care about not what they do in they group
I'm shooting rappers and it's as easy as playing pool
So holler back before some class I'mma put you in same school

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Emmy Gee]
I'm with the red bone lady type, my strained fruit
Her body got the shape of a champagne flute
She your girl though, and I'm the type to bang
I break all the rules, don't be mad at the player though
I'm your lady's new recruit
Play the fast move, we was getting drunk off that Grey Goose
I feel like Adam eating the forbidden fruit
Your bae was loo though, I rock her ass to sleep
Jimmy Choos on, I barely use those, my dick is still my secret weapon
Like a breakfast package comes with a slice of bacon
Smoking on that loud while she banging to my ring tone
Remember when acted brand new
So I gave her the keys to her brand new coupe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ricky Rick]
My nigga I don't need no enemies
All I need is a substitute for this Hennessey
My life was crazy, remember mama was begging me
Now I'm begging mama like please this hundred Gs
Lifestyles of the rich and famous I've heard it all
F*** the money, my niggas is getting murdered off
In Kwamashu the violence had us fleeing like birds
Got to Jozi the system made us move to the burbs
These cars, my government needs stars
Don't tell me about Steve Jobs, my niggas need jobs
R.I.P to the nigga, no disrespect to the greats
But these f***ing iPhones is making my niggas late
Making my niggas stupid, they aspire to acquire
Now it's Empire, when I was young it was The Wire
But I guess that's what you want, what can I do
Round 2 thel' imali, go and buy a bae coupe
