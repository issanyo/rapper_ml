{Intro]
Oh oh oh

[Verse 1: WizKid]
I fuck her once and i let her go
And i don't let nobody know
Met the girl in Chicago
Fuck her with my song on a stereo
We smoke a spliff fat mind then
I tell her bye, fuck her once never twice
Tell her bye bye bye
The way she dance to my music
She make a nigga lose it
Baby girl do the Shmurda
Call me the murderer
I'mma take that pussy and murder that
Call me the controller
So, baby girl do the Shmurda
Call me the murderer
I'mma take that pussy and murder that
Call me the controller

[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuckin' like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em (Ice)
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

[Verse 2: Ice Prince]
Don't tell 'em shit, don't tell 'em nothin' na
I’m at the raddison, i pull up in the panamera

She just wanna hang, i'm on some grope shit
I'm from Nigeria, and she knows that’s some dope shit
And she don’t wanna cope with that broke nigga
Finna get his fame up
Acting like he 2Pac and all that
We the best mummy, i'mma hold you down
I'mma pull a Khalid on you
I'mma put up two-step and fallback (yea)
I’m on some real shit
And i can take you out of town with it, ah
We go to Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana
Every other stay, we never bend on my

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 3: AKA]
Shout out to Mandela
You living in the era of the real super mega
I’m a new slave so my chains got larger
Bars got bigger, so the planes got smaller
Thought the boss, silly ghost, Michael Jordan
Borders get crossed like plane at the border
Double cup caught up in the moment
Ass on dumb but the brain was [?]
Dig it, dig it, dig it
Stay close, i'mma about to blow any minute, shit
Dollar dollar bill on the roll now
Fast money but we chillin' in the slow lounge (Jo)
Jo’burg on the atlas
All gone, with 'em, bad bitch
Just pose for the cameras
OG kush turn to ashes
Damn

[Hook: Jeremih & (Ice Prince)]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you

Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
(Don't tell 'em shit)
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em

Don't tell 'em, (don't tell 'em shit) don't tell 'em
You ain't even, (don't tell 'em shit) don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em

[Bridge: Jeremih]

Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right right right

[Hook: Jeremih]
