[Hook]
Oleku, tell me something wey I no fit do

Mo ni ni mo ni ni, Odeji, Modeji
I hope you ready, cos it's oleku
She feeling the boy, she feeling, she feeling the boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Okay, I'm so interesting
It's why they say that I'm the next thing
So even on features I'm impressing
People do hate but I'm a flexing
Yeah, I learned the lesson
The doe mean shot, but I'm a chesting
I'm far from pop my pop is resting
My flow so bad my tongue is vexing
Yeah
No one is testing, I'm best by far is what I'm guessing
1 2 3, I win like wrestling
How can I loose I'm with the best team
Yeah, I'm the boy with the fire
DJ's gimmie more spin than a tyre
Seen it all, done it all sang in the
Choir
Feeling like I'm tenor here only go higher
Yeah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Okay, its so exciting
The game's been dull, but I'm igniting
Positive flow I'm so attracting
Whether freestyles or even writing - yeah!
I put my life in, the bread don't cut, I put
The knife in, my left hand weak, I put the right in
And take my bars from J to Brighton
I see the lightning, I know sometimes the rain is
Frightening, no matter how hard the seed is ripening
So when you hear Ice prince say hyping - yeah!
I don try plenty, I dey rap, I dey sing, I dey come M.C
It's too many songs and I'm never empty
Now you chop stone if you want tempt me - ah, ah!

[Hook]

Okay, I'm so contagious, and no one done this good in ages
I put my foot in hell, courageous
Too many verse like bible pages - yeah!
And I hit their playlist, so I can grow up from low
To apex, until my account is fat and shapeless
Too many songs but mine is latest - yeah!
So love or hate this, I'm getting my cake, I'm on the cake list
Beating my chest, I'm on the Ape list
You should be honoured and bow to greatness - yeah!
See my name's getting famous, my team's fire men you cannot flame us
Na Baba God work, you cannot blame us
It's in vain when haters try 'n aim us - yeah!
