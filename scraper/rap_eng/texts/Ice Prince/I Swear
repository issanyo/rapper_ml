You…oh na yea

[Hook: Ice Prince]
Raise the roof
Badder man here
Nobody badder than me i swear
If you no soji, have no fear
I spend money on the things i wear (X2)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
We got big money
We drive big cars
Err’where we go people know who we are
I say baby i am a star
I done came up from the bottom
All white v**
On my next ****, styling
Dance floor, passport; fly whip: nascar
Price: don’t ask for
Crib: paid cash for
I shine bright
Came from grime life
Story of my life
Money stacked, nine flights
Smoke what i wanna
Drink what i wanna
What the fuck you expect
I don came up out the condo
Raise the roof
Raise the roof
Iceprince, Montana, we the truth

[Hook: Ice Prince]
Raise the roof
Badder man here
Nobody badder than me i swear
If you no soji, have no fear
I spend money on the things i wear (X2)


[Verse 2: Ice Prince]
See
We no dey kick first
We no dey carry last
We don dey squeeze breast
Na we dey carry pass
We don dey teach them
Na we dey set class
And they been talk say na packaging, go dead fast
Shebi na one chance
I dey hin bus-stop
And if you para me, e go do you like gunshot
My haters fire me, and i promise i won’t stop
Now they call me die hard, i dey hustle till sun drop…eyba
Na we dey ball pass…eyba
Popping the best ace
I started from the bottom
Call me the next Drake
I am fucking on your TV
Omo na sex tape
And if na trouble you dey find, I dey my estate
Them say I stingy die
I no dey pay attention
I pass the test
I am getting A-mehn [Amen], prayer session
Abi na show money
Omo dem go fear me
Shebi na swaggu
2Chainz no go near me

[Hook: Ice Prince]
Raise the roof
Badder man here
Nobody badder than me i swear

[Verse 3: Ice Prince]
I don dey calculate
I don dey act film
I don rock versace
I don dey kack clean
I don dey leave change when i dey buy the flat screen
They don dey write beef for my mind, that’s the last thing….eyba
I don dey take bullet…..eyba
I don dey robocop
I don dey headline major events for boro club
I don dey carry bouncer wey dey wear Armani top
I be like ambulance now cos i dey carry corpse
Omo na red eye, and i no be cultist
Emi ni bad guy, aboki wey dey chop sheet
I am getting respect, enough props
And if you fuck with me, i go fire the bloodclat
Real nigga, Na me be cool cat
And all my record dey big like say na Toolz’s back
See i am always on fire, na me dey cook pass
If money no be topic, i no dey enter the group chat

[Hook – Ice Prince]
Raise the roof
Badder man here
Nobody badder than me i swear
If you no soji, have no fear
I spend money on the things i wear (X2)
