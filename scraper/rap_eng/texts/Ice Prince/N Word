[Intro]

[Verse 1: Ice Prince]
We don dey gather all the cheese, nigga
Big shot chilling overseas, nigga
Fast whips, automatic keys, nigga
So when we drive by, e dey be like the breeze, nigga
Look around my team, you know I'm ill, nigga
Surulere cats dey call me "real nigga"
I've been around the world, and it wasn't like free, nigga
Everyday and anywhere I hustle, I can't afford to be cheated, nigga
I'm pissed off, and I'm angry
Oops, I don't mean it like that
When I say "pissed off, and I'm angry"
I'm talking 'bout how I bring it right back
"Oleku" to "feeling my superstar"
Jude already said who we are
Too much on my books, my nigga, my next show might be Jupiter
Walahi
That's the word on the streets, nigga
I got my money and my goons, I call em "Gs", nigga
R.I.P Dagrin, truly, that's a real nigga
Must be all your prayers wey dey make some people feel niggas
Turn up
I no dey chill with all these crap niggas
Them go smile with you and then stab you for back, nigga
Say Zamani na wash, na me be wack nigga
The joke funny me die, I just dey laugh, nigga
Camouflage on my body, I'm just a Jos nigga
Chopping everyday, see my belly dey pot bigger
Life is beautiful, homie, me sef, I just figured
So when I see a hater, I don't give a fuck, nigga
Deep inside me homie, I'm taking those shots at her
Cuz' Twitter people these days connecting the dots quicker
And these days I be getting sick and retarded, nigga
I just got a full tank, and my engine just started, nigga
We don dey hammer overseas, nigga
Boy them blow a lot of trees, nigga
At a junction, they call me "real nigga"
Elegushi dey halla "Oshey", and they feel nigga
We don dey hammer overseas, nigga
Boy them blow a lot of trees, nigga
At a junction, they call me "real nigga"
Elegushi dey halla "Oshey", and they feel nigga
T-T-Turn up
They don dey talk, they don dey feel bigger
But na we dey chill with Trey Songz and them Big Tigger
Real Gs move in silence, we only think milla
Big man blowing sirens, I'm like a chinchilla
And obviously I don't give a hoot, nigga
I'm on a Jazzy beat and still ain't put a hook, nigga
The beat is toning down, it's a moment of truth, nigga
What else do you expect from an M.I recruit, nigga?
I'm always overseas, I'm like a boat, nigga
Broke records, my record was broke nigga
They claiming they balling and I'm getting the joke, nigga
E no pass all the Instagram wey them dey post, nigga

Boy them blow a lot of trees, nigga
Omota dey shayo, call me real nigga
Elegushi dey halla "Oshey", and they feel nigga

Boy them blow a lot of trees, nigga
Aboki dey halla, say "na real nigga"
Elegushi dey halla "Oshey", and they feel nigga
