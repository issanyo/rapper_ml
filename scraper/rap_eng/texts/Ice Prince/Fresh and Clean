[Hook: Ice Prince]
Everytime we roll up
Everything fresh and clean, everything fresh and clean
Everytime we roll up
Everything fresh and clean, everything fresh and clean
Say I’m about to blow up, ’cause I hustle everyday
I hustle for my daily bread
I see Jehova bless me, Ja guide me ya eh!


[Verse One: L-Tido]
Polo in my closet, ?? in my hot shit
Listen, don’t holler at us if money ain’t the topic
Royalty in my blood, loyalty for my squad
So I never ever betray my homie for a broad
?? on my wrist, four rims on my whip
I’m motherfucking embarrass you if we talking ’bout kicks
Henny in my cup, bitches on the up
From the bottom where the fridge was always empty as fuck
World on my plam, diamond on my arms
Since I blew up only strangers wanna hang like Saddam
YSL on my T, your honey on my D
She in club popping E and wanna F with a G

[Hook]

[Verse Two: L-Tido]
?? on the map, Alex on my back
My whole hood love me, hold it down to the max
Money on my mind, honeys on the line
We into getting some TLC but I ain’t got the time
Leader of the game, hustle in my vein
There’s levels to this and yu dudes ain’t on my lane
O’s on my cheque, gold on my neck
Only three things I need: that’s money, power, respect
Brand on the rocks, ?? on my eyes
If I like it, man, I buy it, don’t even look at the price
Jordans on my feet, ??
I’m speaking modest when I say Tido’s the hottest in the street
