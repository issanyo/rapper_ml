Chorus
[Ice prince]

They try to put me out but I’m topping my game
Walk by the streets and they calling my name
Nobody, I say nobody
Writing my raps all day by the corner
I don’t give a f’ck I say what I wanna
Nobody, I say nobody

They try to put me out but I’m topping my game
Walk by the streets and they calling my name
Nobody (test me, test me, test me)
I say nobody (test me, test me, test me)
Writing my raps all day by the corner
I don’t give a f’ck I say what I wanna
Nobody (test me, test me, test me)
I say nobody (test me, test me, test me)

Verse 1
(Ice prince)

I’m sitting where the lights gone glitter
They try to block the ends but I go through the slither
You should ask yourself why my shit sounds sweeter
And why the girls follow me on Facebook and Twitter
Cuz nobody test me, Baba God bless me
And when you look at me you’ll see real (cereal) like Nestle
I pull out my sunny glass and look in they dumb ass
Saw the finish line even though na me dey run last
See these haters try to dumb mine (why)
But baba God pass dem
They under ground like a plump line
Dem no dey combine
They getting some kind
They cannot Karate (correct) me even though they speaking chong-chin
Hallelujah, I’m getting my Moolah
My chilling is cooler now I am the ruler
Murder’cker  sue ya
And the next best in the microphone Nelson
Lyrical Van Helsing, Yeah

Chorus

Verse 2
[M.I]
I got advice for the up&coming, coming up quick
Don’t test me even if you got testis I’m a prick
First person wen go try me
That person go murd first
Nobody can test me, even if na blood test
There’s no contest
Who is the best please
They gotta confess
Hear me snipping them like Wesley’s
Yes me street like sesame
Better bless me
You don’t wanna vex me or upset me
I’m rocking these other dudes
Something like slow jam
Beef is like Ganja, Bring it and we smoke am
Gossip is like Garri, Bring it and we soak am
Only one kelly that I know, Kelly Rowland
Why will I diss dem
Give them cheap promotion
I think that they are so dry
I should give them lotion
But let them know that
If they wanna go there
Jagz gonna come thru
And bring MI 2

Chorus

Verse 3
(Jesse Jagz)
You cannot T.E.S.T me
J.E. Double S.E
Basically he lyrically jet li
Flow so incredibly
Choc Boys rising vertically
This is me testing me
Not in my terminology
Flow diabolically
On the Mic I be Hercules
Hailing to these rattlings
For the year 2 double 09 I
Double my money in time
So when wahala falla (follow)
See how I pop my collar
My commercial than okada
My music selling like gala
And you cannot touch me
Boy see my flow is automatic
Mother f’kers can't clutch me
But J Jagz is still the manual (manual)
Study me like I’m Samuel or the book of Eli
You cannot deny
Whatever we try becomes a new fly
We blaze amazing tracks taking you high
So ask the last person who tested me
I got so much talent that my father invest in me
