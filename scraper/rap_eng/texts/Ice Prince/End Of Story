End of story (x8)
[Ice Prince]
Yeah, story story
Clear for the mess not the ceremony
So popular, even access de stall me
I breed storm, you can go ask Kaobi
You no go blow that’s what the best had told me
My hand was too dirty for the best to hold me
I never saw sold, “sold outs” didn’t approve me
Until choc city took my hand up and hold me
Now I’m living like Jay Z, spending like diddy
Really that’s crazy, I’m repping my committee
I used to get bouncing for club in the city
Now I got a lot of body guards rolling with me
So don’t hate me, I’ll be paying my dues
Even if you hating on me I’ll be blowing your fuse
I’m still sipping that mike when I’m smoke the juice
And Ice Prince’s name is the only thing on the news
Say she never see
Never see a guy like me
Never see bad guy like me
Say she never see
Never see a guy like me
Never see bad guy like me
Say she never see
Never see a guy like me
Never see bad guy like me
Say she never see
Never see a guy like me
Never see bad guy like me

Ben Bruce once said my little boy is a fan
But now he looks at me like goddamn you’re the man
I smile cause it means that I’m doing the right thing
I gotta stay focused to stay on the right lane
I’m riding through the city, so fly with my sneaks on
If life’s not fair, walahi Ima bleach on
A lot of niggas be hustling for a hit song
If God gimme power, I swear I’ll put each on
And so that dude, can put another dude
I put my money to work, instead a couple of shoes
If don’t step on my hustle, then I won’t bother you
You gotta do it right cause there can be another you
You can go there if I can make it too
If you believe in yourself the you can shake it too
I no get two heads my friend
But when I enter the place the story de end
Say she never see
Never see a guy like me
Never see bad guy like me
Say she never see
Never see a guy like me
Never see bad guy like me
Say she never see
Never see a guy like me
