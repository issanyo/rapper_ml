[Intro: Loose Kaynon]
Yeah, Imma talk my shit for a lil bit
This CBN ting of ours, yessir
M, Jagz, Ice
Salut
Till we victorious, flow so glorious

[Verse 1: Loose Kaynon]
The thing about the grind is
You treat like these girls treat love you my nigga
You don't stop until you find it
They turn the short clock off
When I rhyme cause it is timeless
New God flow
Let me show you what divine is
You know where to find us
Movement so presidential
They pull their phones out try to vine us
Oh you mad cause your account is in the minus
While CBN stunting on you niggas never mind us

[Hook: Jesse Jagz]
This is what it sounds like when we rolling out
Girls call em out, the Choc boiz be out and
We burn down the flat, turn down for what?
Choc boiz be out
Summer time summer time
I love the way your body wine girl you body fine
Summer time nananien
Love the way your body wine baby am summer time
Summer time summer time
I love the way your body wine girl you body fine
Summer time nananien
Love the way your body wine baby am summer time

[Verse 2: Ice Prince]
Poof!
My nigga throwing out roof
Its military we getting ready to shoot, fuck it
Yeah, I brought the hammer out the booth
Its M and Ice and Jagz we spitting with Mr Loose
You know the history, nigga could not do ish to me
I brought the victory home my nigga make hits for me
And my epiphany made it out of resistance
See them n!ggas couldn't take me out
I was shooting from distance G
I never had it all from day one
So I only stick to my niggas from day one
My friends and brothers who knew me right from the crayons
I pray say we go hammer this year
My nigga Jaywon, fuck it!
And now you know how the story goes
Am riding in the ghost fuckin with the pros
And if they steady hating nigga pray on it
You already know it unfolds when the money goes Raaa!

[Hook: Jesse Jagz]
This is what it sounds like when we rolling out
Girls call em out, the Choc boiz be out and
We burn down the flat, turn down for what?
Choc boiz be out
Summer time summer time
I love the way your body wine girl you body fine
Summer time nananien
Love the way your body wine baby am summer time
Summer time summer time
I love the way your body wine girl you body fine
Summer time nananien
Love the way your body wine baby am summer time


[Verse 2: M.I Abaga]
Thank God for blessing both me and my brothers
Bring out the crucifix, bring out the chalice
No time for looking back, no time for malice
I'm blessed...
I always knew they will be round hating
Thats why I built a foundation
Now CBN stand gidigba know the ground shaking
We ground breaking like a jack hammer
The Jos grammer
Pull strings your bitch I'm calling Santana
The front runner, the dididi don papa
You do it, its wack
We do it, Its done, and its done proper!
We fuck you up more than a 100 shots ah
Whiskey, Remy, Vodka
International party rocker
And now we back in tandem
The man-dem, say gan them
Choc boiz a problem
How we gwan stop them?
We sitting in the Phantom
Bumping the Anthem
And some pretty chicks wanna collect the ransom
Cos they know that we handsome

[Hook: Jesse Jagz]
This is what it sounds like when we rolling out
Girls call em out, the Choc boiz be out and
We burn down the flat, turn down for what?

I love the way your body wine girl you body fine
Summer time nananien
Love the way your body wine baby am summer time
Summer time summer time
