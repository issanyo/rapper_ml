All of the girls them kiss and carress me
All of the girls them call me mr best thing
But my girl she's better than the best thing

I'm blingy blingy my man
I chingy lingy, I bad
I jinging linging
I pick the ringing
I finger linging that chair
I justin beiber that band
I piss the nigga that van
I took the shot
I ain't scared of shit
When I face the pistol I bang
Am too fly for myself
8 blocks on my shelf
Spending cash
Am full grown my nigga
Am bay testing my bluff
Am marcus
I'm called fame
My kick game is birthday
My nickname is insane
My crip game is Wale…ra
Fuck around the mic just get embarrassing….ra
Niggas getting pimples cause am back again

Am incredible
Fucking rap again
Them nigga trembling
Then they barking
Surfing the map again…ra

Some of them talk say I no dey sleep
Some of them talk say I no be crap and
Some of them talk say I don dey speak
