Dee-Money — Finish Line RMX

INTRO:
I tell my niggas we gon get it
I put that on my mama like the diamond necklace
For a homie like me, losing ain’t an option
An original popping off so I had to do a remake

[VERSE 1:Dee Money]
Okay I’m new maroon in my category
Guess why they hating on me
Nigga put no hand out take no favourites
They’re no shit for me
King shit, lil Nigga on some king shit
Big wheels, rode for deals
Seeing a Nigga with a big bitch huh
Holla, these rap niggas really ain’t shit to me
I came up and I dey fuck the game up
Change what and now shit ain’t me
Who you know be the youngest nigga
Got a record label in this industry
Got your favorite ex in that range rover
Took her back to the crib now it’s game over
Small boy danger
The girl dem are poom poom breaker
Lock off the rave say me better than them
Bad man try me a hundred shots at them
Praaaa
Swag just awesome
And they envy Cos I’m flyer than a falcon
I don’t jump on no band wagon
I just come thru in that G-wagon
Skiii
Fuck boys, all I see is Fuck boys
Lay their lives for this rap shit
And they turn thier back, some Fuck bullshit
Ghana with no DeeMoney
You know that shit sound wack
Keep talking smack and let my boys in black thru Like (blac-blac-blac-ra-ta-ta)

[VERSE 2:Paedae]
Do you wanna know if we better than these veteran rappers
That rap about things they never done
Just for relevance
We elegant oh flow so heavy
Call it and elephant, yet so holy
Like we’re in ramadan
God bless our motherland
Do all we can we ain’t settling for less
We wrestling who badder than the best
Dee Moneey, tell em we don’t joke we ain’t funny
It’s sunny where we from
We make all the work, work work dem a port
We no dey watch bugs bunny
Dead would be better better than a fella whos from the wu-tang era
Flow so clever
You never say never but I promise I would never ever play sekefedo
Or be a lame follower to a trend setter

[HOOK:J.Town]
So make you no dey envy brother man-a
You for dey hustle my buddy understand (work work)
Life no be easy so you for take a chance
And when the money come clear
Bans go make her dance
Say right here we ball
Right here we ride
Right here we grind
Homie till we die
Bans go make her dance
Say right here we ball
Right here we ride
Right here we grind
Homie till we die

[VERSE 3:Ice Prince]
I’m laced up and I’m feeling alright
Ace cups six packs on Ice
Yh, no be say na me holy pass o
Man dem just feeling alright
Dee moneey, these fuck boys still hating on a nigga
I’m out here still waiting on drigga
You know what they say my Nigga more money more hater
But amma put the breast in the hole like a fucking vibrator
They gonna shake, they gonna dance archada
They go dey vex I go dey top my radar
They go dey sweat I go dey drive Maserati
I go dey cruze I go be life of the party
And, back to the Genesis I am
That real G in the book
I be the rapper and I be the singer
Zamani king of the hooks

Nowadays when they see me dem craze
Look at my face and look at your face
It’s easy to differentiate
Abi shey you dey craze
Your mama your papa your sister your brother they’re looking at me
Versace and Gucci dey make you dey wanna go brooklyn on me
Say I am the catalyst, I am the battery
Fuck ridiculous
I am the character life is a clip
And we’re up in the cinemas
I call the Messiah, to fire the film has actually been in us
So now we be busting the flow and the fan is a actual zeal in us

[VERSE 4:Reminisce]
Te anybody loju mole when I pull up in a benz
Fuck with the same niggas omo no new friends
Shoutout sawon temi ni Brussels, Lu Ven
Keskila holla back maami oti pe
Fo lekun yen wole, pelu paa Liu Kang
Temole release e, oya show you can
Getting high in the booth
Dee moneey call in the troop

Spend some of that money then get more money
To ba possible maami wanna Fuck that money

HOOK:

[VERSE 5:M.anifest]
You for make bygones be bygones
Tell bystanders I be icon
From east to west I’ve been beast on this

Choc city prince got my ice on
Obi rene gen, obi no pito
Obi chini truck, obi su chi pijo

For envy success the best remedy
Eyo fa, eni nu eni
Eyo tipe neme, for a rap eni
Etode bia nemi yakupo din komo
Thanks for the vim
