[Refrain - Victoria Kimani]
I swear these hoes ain't got no ambition (ooh, oh)
They wanna take your man they on a mission (ooh, oh)
I know they hating on my ambition (ooh, oh)
Looking for blessers but they blessing's missing
Eeh, where my girls who graduated school? (Eeh)
Never follow but they set the rules (Eeh)
Spend more time in the office than on Instagram (Eeh)
Their bodies not the reason why they're in demand

[Verse 3 - Ice Prince]
Ahh
If I ever go to rest
Nigga put me on the ground
Now we sitting at the top
Though we started on the ground
You know when you make it big
Haters throw a hundred rounds
I just walk inside the club
And I put a hundred down
And nobody ain't telling me shit
I'm bae cracking I'm selling it quick
Face that you ain't on my list
Fake cats try diss my clique
I take that and your lady's lips
Ya'll kiss twice and you smell my dick
I did not come here to play, uh
I got more riders to spray, uh
I got a lot on my mind so I never ever smoke a regular jay, uh
I got some jays on my feet, uh
But that do not mean I'm a kid, uh
I gotta sleep on my twitter now
Coz I gotta handle my dreams

[Hook - Tweezy]
I got dreams I got ambitions
Just a youngin tryna get it
My ninja I'm on I'm in the game
Khathaza the whole city and the game
Ma nigga

Nisendleleni, Nisendleleni
I'm on the way, I'm on the way
Suk' endleleni, Suk' endleleni
