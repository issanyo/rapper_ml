Shey na wassup wassup
Na papa God put me ontop ontop
See Jehovah be my guide them I support support
So badman no need to fuck up fuck
Shey na wassup wassup
Na baba God put me ontop ontop
See Jehovah be my guide them I support support
So badman need to logoff logoff
[Ice Prince]
Choc boy, celebrating
And everyday my fanbase is elevating
Say we the best yes no debating
See badman die and we replace him
Omo right now we the main thing
We step on stage and the people fainting
They see my real colour I’m like a painting
And gone are those days we wear the same thing
No need for all the hating
The boys we salute the girls we dating
I no get time, I’m concentrating
Jehovah had me sign undertaking
Very necessary o
I’m shaking my belly o
All over your telly o
I’m blowing your stereo
Omo no de vex me

Remember say your chic de for house just de text me
Chai

Badman, shut up shut up
You see me for your street make you lock up lock up
My dogs will bite if you fuck up fuck up
Ice Prince and Tuface that’s wassup wassup
Yeah, no NEPA but we are shining
My Chris Aire flow is perfect timing
Since Olu and all did the signing

I feel blessed o
And nothing in the world fit test oh
They say Ice Prince is he the next
And Tuface tell them say yes

The music architect, I’m just designing
I make life better and sweet for rhyming
When you see me for your salute my rhyming

Every other nigga, so we just dey de flow
Rejoice bam make I wanna come and take am on the floor
Everybody know that father Lord is my forefather

Everybody know bad move (they know bad move)
Take it take it
