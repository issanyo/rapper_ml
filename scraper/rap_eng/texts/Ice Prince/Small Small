If no be say na God oh (x2)

If no be say na God oh (x2)

[Ice Prince]
Its for this time that they made Sheldon
Stepping in the place and they say welcome Even badman de say welcome
No be now you’re telling me sail on
No be me shaa, na God be the ultimate
Me I no get two heads na God make me fortunate
My brake’s no de work and nobody can be stopping it
I scatter the floor and my enemies are mopping it
And right now, me I’m counting profits
Flier than the rest, me I’m sitting in my cockpit
They say the got beef
Omo me I’m into porking
No wonder I be getting fatter, shooting like a rocket
They paying us bro, we no de cut neck
Cause even when the rain de fall, we de drop sweat
If you de hustle on your own, my nigga God bless
One day the sun go shine ontop your hostess

[Ice Prince]
Omo one day na one day
If God say na your turn, nothing can come near
I used to be in the shadow without a son yeah
And now I de make cat walk like say na runway
Whoever thought with my biro and paper
Will make headlines for Cairo and the states ya
Some of them been de say I get no style
My brother no be me, na God de raise my profile
No be God
We no de carry gun (x2)
Still on top, we de carry on
And if no be God, we for de be on
We still twenty something and making money Onh onh onh run
Everything, take turn

We know book, that’s why we de carry first
Everything you say, we be the best
Put your hands up, make you start to de onh onh onh
