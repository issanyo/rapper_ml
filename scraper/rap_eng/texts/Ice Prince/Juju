Badman

[Hook]
Every time I see myself
I de feel like say na juju de worry me
I no fit explain everything
I de feel what I feel like mumu de worry me (x2)
Somebody pray for me
Cause every little thing I do
And every little thing I try
Somebody pray for me
Badman envy the way
They wan make me cry (x2)

[Verse 1]
Okay
Yeah, I no fit chop food keep plate
Can't even ball cause my haters tryna deflate
Whatever I do, they search for the mistake
Some of them say that my album is worse than a mixtape (mumu)
Some of them smile, when they face me
Some of them swear with their lives how they hate me
(mumu)
Fake friends they pretend with their smileys
Yellow and white everytime they reply me
But that’s bullshit
Me I’m on some new shit
If you got beef for me, chop it up, deuces
Cause no time for you hater-ation
I got busy days going for the federation**
Number one homie
That’s me homie
If e de pain you go chop bee homie
I’m complete homie
Your whole street know me
I bring paint to the beat that's me Tony**

[Verse 2]
These days some people wey you call friends
Shook hand for your eye and they no send**
Life’s a bitch and everybody screws you
Hammer over nails to your head, Is how they do you
The more you grow up
And get more famous
The more they treat you like shit to your own anus
And if you fly too much, they turn terrorist
And if you try to shine too bright, they turn eclipse
Some of y’all really showed love way back
Damn, now you hating my success
How the fuck am I supposed to relate that
Huh
Am I supposed to be upset
But see homie
I got kicks so fly, Jet Li homie
I’ll be milking the game, no tea homie
Quit bothering the dog, so flee homie
You can’t feed on me
You ain't shit

[Verse 3]
I de ponder
Why e be say na me God de wonder
I started my career with a honda
Too fly and I’m never going under
So don’t bother

[Bridge]
Brother you see
If you wish me well, I go wish you well oh
Brother you see
If you wish me fire, then go to hell oh (x2)
