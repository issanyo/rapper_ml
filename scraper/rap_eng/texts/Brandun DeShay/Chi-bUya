Last time I checked we was up
Last time I checked we was up
Last time I checked we was up
Last time I checked we was up

Everything was all good just a week ago

[Verse 1]
Last time I checked we was up
Stress now bringing me down
Swear I didn't feel it before
Damn sure feeling it now
I been reminiscing the days
Youngin' growing up in the Chi
Summertime feeling the breeze
Make sure all the homies were dry
Chi Town, nigga, what's up?
West side I could be found
Galewood turning me up
Sunburbs calming me down
All day roaming the streets
Outside screaming, 'Whaddown'
Driveway, shooting some hoops
That was how we used to get down
Thug not getting enough
Girls not giving it up
Grinding for a couple of weeks
Stay gettin' into some stuff
Now I'm out here live on my own'
Big city buildin' my dreams
Every night I look to the sky
Praying God gonna believe in me like I do in he

Oh man, oh man
Oh man, oh man

[Verse 2]
Used to penny pinch till we plenty rich, nigga, this is it
Even if I had to play D, hope to pay D in the pain
I ain't backing down from this shit
I swear man, I ain't scared of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no heights, I ain't fearing no man
But I am terrified I am right
Took my little ideas, turn them to a big deal
Want like six mil, I'mma find out how the shit feel
Feeling sick still, all this working, had to skip meals
Want me pay dues and they fronted me a big bill
I swear what you see is what you get
Oooh, you ain't seen nothing yet
Been a couple months down from the stress
But you see me bounce back, thank God for the rest
