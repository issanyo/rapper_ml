[Intro/Bridge]
Give me the fame(x7)
I want the fame(x7)
Give me the fame(x7)
I want the fame(x7)

[Hook]
Hollywood
Big old house, Range Rovers, Diamond Rings
If you like that kind of thing
Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I be that young rhyme slinger
Keeping it G funk like it's '93
?
Rocking more black than Will Smith & Tommy Lee
I see all these cats for who they really be
When you high up they see defeat and get jealous and try to CBV
Dollar dollar bills could get you with R&B Singers
Dollar dollar bills could turn homies into Pachangas
Dollar dollar bills could make people feel like they bigger
I bet everybody with you, as long as you got them figures
But you all good, for it, Back home's, boring
And you got, bills, So you keep, touring
And now you obligated, ghost speakers your publicist
Telling you to say this, smiling know when you hate it
And you in a position that people would kill to be in
They don't even know the real, they only love what they seeing
Sometimes you gotta chill, sit back, be grateful
Tame the beast of fame or it just might break you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
So now you stuck in it, too much green ain't healthy for you
But you love, spinach, and the singing, women, and them free, clothes
And the transportation
The rooms and the hotels the labels pay for you to stay in
Suppose your friends don't pick up their phone, when they see your number
They anticipated heat, but you didn't see the summer
Bummer, you were supposed to blow but now your broke
Packing your bags and missing your soul
The end of the world and your looking for ?
Your just a has-been from the old days
You can't ride this new wave
The label took what you made
So best believe they're paid
You didn't make it far so your A&R ain't on your radar
Threw the deuces up like later
They are, focused on a new artist
Took your whole style, even your old beats
They made you a star, then they kicked you out the picture
Promised you would be richer, but look at how they did ya

[Hook x3]
