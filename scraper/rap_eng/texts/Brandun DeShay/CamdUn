[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
You know, a couple of years ago
Me and my cousin Ikey came together
With an equal hatred for kufis
And respect to Dipset
I felt this my opportunity to finally address this situation
Ya dig?

[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
Back to goofy, acting stupid, smack them kufis off their head
Pass the hookies, smash the roofie like I’m loony off the meds
Fresh to death like I passed away, ought like the pastor say
Fastest way, I get in for cheap like it’s matinee
Have a say, smacking some kufis was on my mind
Hope this here ain’t denying, homie loading the nine
That’s fine, it’s just there’s me now, you’re a G? Wow
Kufis coming off of their head like freestyles
And I ain’t making shit, taking shit, taking chips
Stuff go inside the potato like it was baking chips
I got gorillas, dude, like it was Lincoln Zoo
I holler “woo woo!”, them goonies come at you
With that steady power and devour, swear they wrong
When that [?] on (bap bap), glad he’s gone
Like it’s Gnarls Barkley, I’m like Charles Barkley
Number one under the sun, and no, I’m not the
Kooky kufi, lose your kufi
Leave your head cold like the movie smoothie
Got 2 G’s on me, not the type to pull the piece on me
Skating shank dudes put the fleece on me
And I’m too cold, you know that I’m on it, dog
You probably couldn’t stop this flow with menopause
I’m on that great bowin’, rain pourin’, ape showin’
Get your kufi knocked off like fake clothing
I’m the all gold tower like it’s eagle heat
Shit, it’s the all gold tower like it’s eagle feet
You’ll get your kufi smacked on the corner of Eagle Street
And if you step to me, dog, you know that he gon’ sleep
And I’m too cold, you can get your melon split
Constipated lifestyle, like I never gave an ish
You think you can beat me? You’re truly out your head
I let the toolie clap your legs, I bet the bullets knock the freakin’ kufi off your head
Nigga

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
Don’t take me seriously
I mean, I ain’t got nothing against kufis
Y’all even know what kufis represent and shit
But, anyways, it’s been a fun little mixtape
It’s like my own little version of Enemy of the State, whatever
Something super short
Um, ultra horrible quality, obviously, but I swear to God, though, I did, like, pretty much all of this
All, like, last night and then I woke up this morning, had to recharge and shit
And then finish the rest of the songs
So, um, yeah
Maybe at some point, I’ll redo it with better quality or something, though
But, yeah
I hope you enjoyed what I got so far
Um, this was a fun-ass tape
Like I said, this was just for fun
This just goes to show, man
I mean, rapping is really… I really do enjoy this
You see how quickly I was able to do this, like, I don’t know
I challenge somebody to bring out, you know, something just as entertaining in a short time
Besides Lil Wayne because I know he probably got it in him, I mean…
Yeah, so…
Damn, I guess that’s it, aight
