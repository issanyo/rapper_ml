Girl right where you are
We aligning the stars
Like it was destined we would do our thing, yeah
Take a drink, take a chance
Rosé romance
Pour up and pour out my heart, no shame, yeah
It's amazing what you can find, oh
Amazing what you find with your eyes closed
Fortune lead you to me with a blindfold
Call a fate or divine, I know it's a sign

Yeah
I know it, I know it's a sign

Caught a wave
In a daze
Believing every sign that was sent to me
Washing up
On my shore
Then you can came in my life, serendipity

Caught a wave
In a daze
Believing every sign that was sent to me
Washing up
On my shore
Then you can came in my life, serendipity

やっぱり (Yappari) x16

Oh, Serendipty x8

Caught a wave
In a daze
Believing every sign that was sent to me
Washing up
On my shore
Then you can came in my life, serendipity

Caught a wave
In a daze
Believing every sign that was sent to me
Washing up
On my shore
Then you can came in my life, serendipity

やっぱり (Yappari) x8
