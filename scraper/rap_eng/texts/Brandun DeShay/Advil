[Intro]
High, hi-high
High, hi-high, oh
High, hi-high
High, hi-high, oh
(Can't get this shit open)

[Verse 1]
Pain reliever, fever reducer
Ten to the head,does that make me a loser?
I took nine shots of that fifth
Gone, gone, gone
Eight hits of that spliff
Gone, I got
Seven reasons why I'm not sure of six things
On my mind and I'm comin' off this high five
Comin' off this high-igh-igh five

[Chorus]
Feel me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

[Verse 2]
Second verse, on my third beer
Kill all these voices that I feel I hear
Mob to the bride, I'm (keep, keep, keep)
Keeping the faith
I'm holding the fight, a hell of a night
It's a hell of a night

[Chorus]
Feel me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

[Verse 3]
Only when I'm alone
Only when I was on one, one
(One, one, one, one)
Live like I'm living today, live like today was my last one, one
(One, one, one, one)

[Bridge]
Falling from this high-igh-igh five
(Falling falling, falling falling)
From this high-igh-igh-igh
(One, one, one, one) oh

[Chorus]
Feel me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

[Outro]
All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real
All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real
(I know, But I prefer my eyes low)
