Uhhmmm

[Verse 1]

I really wrote this song for the cool kids
I ain't signed to Fool's Gold, but this fool is rich
You niggas ass milk cause you with the bullshit
Dr. Armbruster thought I wouldn't pull shit
True shit , senior year
Pulling pranks , made it clear
That Ted runs shit
In between lunches
My lines pack punches
My name no introduction
I don't hold grunges
Making love to my blunt bitch
Roll it , light it
Now she getting excited
All I touch gold , King Midus
And I got no plaques gingivitis
You ain't got swag , I don't like it
This one of my old tracks , I'm just psychic
High from high hat , high from high kick
High all day, be on that hype shit
Hypebeast , Hypetrak
Waiting on my shit
With my nigga Gino
Throwing in a mosh pit
Heard Ted a rapper , but he never drop shit
Chilling in the air kinda like a drop kick
But be easy bro , be easy
Keep em in line like a pair Air Yeezy

[Hook]

In Orlando Fl, it's a really nice day
In my driveway , roll a really nice jay
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
It's a dream sipping lean , now I'm sitting sideways
With your shawtay , she'll have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
Ted Massena
Brandun Deshay
Kicking my feet up
Yeah that's all day

[Verse 2]

Loving weed getting high
Me and my guy
We like Bender and Fry
We be all up in the sky
Gotta pair Jeremy Scott
Cause a nigga supa fly
And the coupe look like a pie
Tan on the outside , red in the inside
Told your chick "get inside"
Than I cuff her... FBI
It's okay she'll be fine
And shine fine...
And it's fucking payday
Everybody know that weed is the gateway
Smoking in the safe way
Let the bong rip like a beyblade
And I'm like baby , babyyyy
Driving in the 45 , but I'm going 80!
Uhhmmm
I'm stunting and they hate it
Real shit though
She get low to Diplo
We bump it in the whip bro
And it's just a strip show
Where I'm at, it be live
Honeys know I'm buzzing in this beehive

[Hook]

In Orlando Fl, it's a really nice day
In my driveway , roll a really nice jay
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
It's a dream sipping lean , now I'm sitting sideways
With your shawtay , she'll have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
Ted Massena
Brandun Deshay
Kicking my feet up
Yeah that's all day

...

Really nice day
Have a really nice day
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
Really nice day
Have a really nice day
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
It's a dream sippin' lean now I'm sitting sideways
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
It's a dream sippin' lean now I'm sitting sideways
Blow the smoke in your face
And have a really nice day
