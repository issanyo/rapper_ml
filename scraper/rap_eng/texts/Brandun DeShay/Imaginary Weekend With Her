[Chorus]
Baby, let's ride or maybe we'll fly
Ain't nothing like them summer nights, baby, that's right
Shampoo in the air like the wind in your hair
You've been waiting all day just hear me say
Baby, let's ride or maybe we'll fly
Ain't nothing like them summer nights, baby, that's right
Shampoo in the air like the wind in your hair
You've been waiting all day just hear me say
Baby, let's ride

[Verse 1]
It's the weekend, just out of work, though
Home sweet home, I'm hopping out of my work clothes
Probably about to shower for an hour to get rid of all this must
And such, I'm thinking about lust
So I called my girl, asked her, "What's the deal?" like Seinfeld
"I'm looking for a time killer, you could be in it"
She said she free after nine like weekend minutes
Said, "I'll call her back, first I got to handle my business"
Dropped the phone, hit the showers like after practice
Then I checked MapQuest to figure out the traffic
It's looking pretty good and I'm looking even better
Feeling so fly, just might grow feathers
And plus this dope weather, it's summertime shy
Might have to kill some time and hit Lake Shore Drive
Turned off all of the lamps and leave only the desk light
Hit Deondria up with a text like...

[Chorus]
Baby, let's ride or maybe we'll fly
Ain't nothing like them summer nights, baby, that's right
Shampoo in the air like the wind in your hair
You've been waiting all day just hear me say
Baby, let's ride or maybe we'll fly
Ain't nothing like them summer nights, baby, that's right
Shampoo in the air like the wind in your hair
You've been waiting all day just hear me say
Baby, let's ride

[Verse 2]
It's never easy just to get ready for a party when you're trying to look fly
You make up your mind
On a shirt and some jeans and you ask your self twice
"Do I really look tight?"
You change about nine times before you're finally satisfied
Now you're ready to make your entrance
I know the girls won't leave me alone, no interest
Or spark my interest, the party's in the park, I'll be there like benches
The party's pretty far, in fact, it's really far
Might as well took the car and drove to Mars
That's only hypothetically, I'm just being whimsical
Everybody waiting just to see me in the physical
The stars that are out tonight and the planets, all digital
And if I'm not visible, unforgivable
I only came to party, but they came to see me
Well, tell the ladies that I left, that's right

[Chorus]
Baby, let's ride or maybe we'll fly
Ain't nothing like them summer nights, baby, that's right
Shampoo in the air like the wind in your hair
You've been waiting all day just hear me say
Baby, let's ride or maybe we'll fly
Ain't nothing like them summer nights, baby, that's right
Shampoo in the air like the wind in your hair
You've been waiting all day just hear me say
Baby, let's ride

[Verse 3]
I honked twice, she's out the door, looking like a deity
Beautiful like the Pleiades, I wonder what she see in me
And then we speed off to the beach under the moonlight
Waiting for the sunrise (waiting for the sunrise)

[Outro]
It's beautiful, right?
You're beautiful
No, no, no
I mean it, for real
I mean...
I've been trying not to sound corny, though
But it's like...
I don't know, when I'm around you
It's like you inspire, like...
You inspire poetry, like...
I'm sure I could...
Make endless love songs about you
You're probably tired of all the songs I made about you so far
Oh well
We came a long way, huh?
I don't think many people have the stories magical as ours
Like, even I am still pretty amazed
Pretty amazing
It's pretty amazing
