[Chorus: Tommy Parker]
You might be the one that I'm looking for
So baby let's hit the floor
You know you make my heart stop
Let's see where this thing can go
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're it

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I wanna rock right now
I'm B. Rud and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But it's smart to leave your girl at home
I'm on and off the chain
Going through withdrawals like I'm off the c'aine
Psyche! I know what you like
Me on the mic
Plus DeShay beats
And a whole night full of free drinks
But I know what ya'll all been asking
How a kid so young so classic?
How the kid so dope with no coke?
How the North Face coat so fashion?
Well it's just my passion
With enough work, then I just might cash in
One fifty five on the dash, in the SLK
With the slate-gray paint, with a boo like Aladdin

[Chorus (2x): Tommy Parker]
You might be the one that I'm looking for
So baby let's hit the floor
You know you make my heart stop
Let's see where this thing can go
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're it

[Verse 2: Chill3D]
Man, I must've been out of my brain
'Cause hair and the nails with a body insane
Help the penetration of my mainframe
Caught in a daze, I'm just trying to maintain
She's a virus in my system
Got me sitting here, glitching, twitching
Feeling like I'm stuck in intermission
Lost in space and I'm in a new dimension
Man, 'cause it's the flashing lights
Got me thinking you the prototype
Let me get a drink I know you like
Now let's sway to the beat all night
Call me MJ baby, wanna rock with you
In a Led Zeppelin, Joe Cocker mood
Yeah, your lips send me up like Spock will do
You coming through, so make it so number two

[Chorus (2x): Tommy Parker]
You might be the one that I'm looking for
So baby let's hit the floor
You know you make my heart stop
Let's see where this thing can go
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're it

[Bridge: Tommy Parker]
I tried to find what's really right
What's best for me in my life right now, you could be the one
Just come and meet me up on the floor, work it here until you get sore
'Cause baby, you're it
I tried to find what's really right
What's best for me in my life right now, you could be the one
Just come and meet me up on the floor, work it here until you get sore
'Cause baby, you're it

[Chorus (2x): Tommy Parker]
You might be the one that I'm looking for
So baby let's hit the floor
You know you make my heart stop
Let's see where this thing can go
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're in control
'Cause baby, you're it
