[Intro]
Hey, baby. Just calling to see what you were doing. I just drove by your house and saw that the lights were on and assumed you were home. You're not- you wouldn't ignore my calls right? 'Cause if you are, you know I'll kill you. Just playing. Call me back, baby
I love you

[Verse 1]
Is it even real? (tell me)
If it don't kill you and leave fingerprints
Yeah, she waited on my will
Went through nine lives, I been dead
Saw Jesus on chill
Made me burn my whole Rolodex
Now we really tryna build
If I don't fuck it up before the sun set
I don't know where you lit up
First swipe on Tinder
Do you first class, went from thirst trap to Brita
Five-footer killer, I'm living in no villa
Got me losing hair, man, I'm turning into Krillin
All of my homies say "Let her go,"
She got me feeling like edibles
Both of us came from the barrio
Sing and dance on the Maury show
She be a freak and I'm dead in the head, fuego, yeah
You know I never regret til' the dust settles

[Chorus]
You kill me (you kill me)
We laugh, then we cry, and you kill me (you kill me)
We kiss, then we fight, yeah, you kill me
I hate that I love it, you love that I hate it
Don't kill me (you kill me), and I kill me
Yeah, I stick around
'Cause you be holding me down til' I start to drown
You kill me (you kill me)
Yeah, y-y-y-yeah, you kill me (you kill me)

[Verse 2]
I gave her keys to the whip and the deed to the crib
If I ever tried to leave, she'll put the keys to the whip
Court hearings, hoe earrings, tight jeans with the Timbs
From the streets, snatch the weave off a bitch
But the pussy's strawberries, and the sex is barbaric
Know that she ain't all there, but she'll be the pallbearer
Man, that's loyalty
Wrote like fifty songs about my chick
She getting royalties
Main muse and cause of all my stress was a ladykiller
My name rang through the town, on my Frank Miller
Like 300 body count til' I got with her
Always yelling in my face, I need a pop filter
She got melodies for days
My Norma Jean from Normandie Avenue
Abnormal with a Norman Bates attitude
If in the future, something happened and I died for you
It'd be you up on the evening news 'cause

[Chorus]
You kill me (you kill me)
We laugh, then we cry, and you kill me (you kill me)
We kiss, then we fight, yeah, you kill me
I hate that I love it, you love that I hate it
Don't kill me (you kill me), and I kill me
Yeah, I stick around
'Cause you be holding me down til' I start to drown
You kill me (you kill me)
Yeah, y-y-y-yeah, you kill me (you kill me)

[Verse 3]
Girl, we just hook up
Hanging to get pissed off
'Cause you say it's on then I tick you off
I act like we ain't down for eachother
But I'd be damned to see you down for another
I know that it sound so crazy
But the sex be so amazing
It's that love-hate all day
Love-hate all day, love-hate all day

[Chorus]
You kill me (you kill me)
We laugh, then we cry, and you kill me (you kill me)
We kiss, then we fight, yeah, you kill me
I hate that I love it, you love that I hate it
Don't kill me (you kill me), and I kill me
Yeah, I stick around
'Cause you be holding me down til' I start to drown
You kill me (you kill me)
Yeah, y-y-y-yeah, you kill me (you kill me)
