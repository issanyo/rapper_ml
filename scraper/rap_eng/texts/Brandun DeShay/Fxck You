[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
I've been looking for something I can believe in
There's no telling the day that I'ma be leaving
The sweet smell of victory's what I've been breathing
Let out a sigh, the fact that I'm even alive is a lifetime achievement
I heard somewhere that blessings come in seasons
Well, I'ma need to be blessed like I'm sneezing
Well, I'ma need to be the best for no reason
Before I turn my back on the rest, no treason
Before I blow like the trees in the breeze and
And kill the mold on the beat like a seasoning
All my Q's and P's and excuse me please
When I never smile, when I get cheese, I'll be cheesing
I'm like a whore, every night I'm on my knees and
Praying to the Lord that one day you'd stop teasing
I've got to keep it together like adhesive
I set a goal, least I can do is achieve it
Believe it

[Chorus]
Nothing that you can do or for you to say
Now I'm gonna fly anyway
I know I can
I know I am better than you
Nothing that you can do or for you to say
Now I'm gonna fly anyway
I know I can
I know I am better than you

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
You could plagiarize
In other words, take my word for it
I swear to God, I done heard it all
My music is achievers
It seem like Jesus to all you non-believers
I owe it all
To you, there you go again, Mr. Know-It-All
They came to see your show, of course I got to show it off
I got a little shine, but you don't even glow at all
Everyday is like a great day, hey, mazel tov
I flow like a super soaker with the nozzle off
So I'm all Holocaust while y'all all cotton soft
Even the greatest like autumn, dog, you gotta evolve
And prays like Pok√©mon cards, you got them all
AM radio niggas, they got a lot of talk
So I ain't hearing none of you naysayers, not at all
They got they floaties on and I'm yelling "cannon ball"
How you gonna get the picture if the Canon's off?
Get it?

[Chorus]
Nothing that you can do or for you to say
Now I'm gonna fly anyway
I know I can
I know I am better than you
Nothing that you can do or for you to say
Now I'm gonna fly anyway
I know I can
I know I am better than you

[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
Gonna say good morning to the world
And now I'm gonna say good morning to your girl
We had a good night, I got the goods, right?
I can tell by her skin, yo, she had a good life
But no Kanye and no T-Pain
I'm a Prince, cue the smoke and the purple rain
Searching for the rings like a young hobbit
Now they all on my jock like a young Bobbit
Lorena, this here is a no-brainer
Show the world vivid pictures, but I'm no painter
Physically and mentally the best
Trying to find myself with a mental GPS
I ain't meant to be the best, just the best that I can
Goddamn, the worth of you is one less man
Jesus was a rock star, I'm just one less fan
Better yet, I'm just one less stan
And I won this hand

[Chorus]
Nothing that you can do or for you to say
Now I'm gonna fly anyway
I know I can
I know I am better than you
Nothing that you can do or for you to say
Now I'm gonna fly anyway
I know I can
I know I am better than you
Nothing that you can do or for you to say
Now I'm gonna fly anyway
I know I can
I know I am better than you
Nothing that you can do or for you to say
Now I'm gonna fly anyway
I know I can
I know I am better than you
