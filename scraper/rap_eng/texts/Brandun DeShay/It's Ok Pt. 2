[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Thank you, Deondria

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
My vision’s so fucked, so my eyesight blurry
But I can see the future so clearly
Every time I wake up and wash my face up
Bags under my eyes, the hours I stay up
Pray on that one of these songs that I made
Would get me made, would give me maids
Chauffeurs and days in the sunlight
Me and my babe, I ain’t dreaming
It’s more towards reality I’m leaning
It’s really just a matter of time
Sometimes I cry and can’t even find a reason to rhyme
But that’s my reason to rhyme, that’s relieving the stress
I used to be a Stoop Kid, now I’m leaving the steps
I guess I finally had enough
With the hands of fate, I’ll call your bluff
Tough luck, nothing ever came easy to me
But I've been fortunate enough to find a reason to breathe
And that's a dream

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay and Eminem (sampled from "It's Okay")]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
They say I got a whole, whole lot of potential
But it's driving me mental
I'm praying every night that's this the shit that I'm meant for
My father had some dreams and he lent those to me
Now I turned them to reality
He potentially could have been, would have been
Fuck it, he should have been the shit that I am
But circumstance had other plans that allowed me to fly
So I grew up and I grew up to be someone he can rely
On and on, just returning the favor
Return like a [?] neighbor
We destined to labor, life is 'bout who out there slept
And who out there sleep, the dead get a lot of rest
All you can do is hope for the best
Take the good as it comes, try to hope for the rest
Trying over is a test, this whole life shit
You going over the edge, hold on to the vise-grip
That's my only advice, kid

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay and Eminem (sampled from "It's Okay")]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here

[Outro: Eminem (sampled from "It's Okay") & brandUn DeShay]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay (it's okay)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (it's alright)
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep (even though I can't sleep)
It's a long year, pretending I belong here (yeah)
It's a broke day, but everything is okay (it's okay)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (it's alright)
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep (even though I can't sleep)
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
It's a broke day, but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year, pretending I belong here
