[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
BrandUn DeShay on the rhymes
Masterminds one time
Yeah

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Dog, I’m a leviathan, my flow is personified
My whole persona fly, there’s no one that is higher than
Yeah, unless I get stoned writing this
Get it? Too bad I don’t write, spent too much time reciting this
Yeah, I’m off my mind, I need Vicodin
Getting high off of Einsteinium, enlighten kid
More enlightening than Vinci, turn this beat up
In the midst, me getting my dollars, coins, change, and pence piece
It’s nothing new to me, I’m unstoppable like a juggernaut
My flow is unorthodox, ascot socks
Cover my brain, I think hot, and it just smothers the flame
Dang, try to copy me, you get a paper jam
Sorry

[Hook: brandUn DeShay]
I’m the meanest (Yeah)
And I mean this (Uh)
What I mean is (What?)
I’m a genius (Get at me)
I’m the meanest (Yeah)
And I mean this (Uh)
What I mean is (What?)
I’m a genius (Get at me)
I’m the meanest (Yeah)
And I mean this (Uh)
What I mean is (What?)
I’m a genius (Get at me)
I’m the meanest (Uh)
And I mean this (Yeah)
What I mean is (What?)
I’m a genius (Get at me)

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Get at me, had the beats or the rhymes or the shows
If you could find me in the streets, it’s spending time with the hoes (Wow)
Excuse my French, I know you’re probably used to it
This beat is whipped with a cape, it’s super slick
I’m hard as shell, I’m on my King Koopa ish
Super ish, you’re waiting for my super switch
But I don’t got a kryptonite, full of weed, I say “no, no”
They hand me the blunt and I’ll pass, no Romo (Yeah!)
The same for the deals and the managers, no promo
My pace here’s I’m sprinting, not racing, no slow-mo
So don’t assume I’m a backpacker like most of these dudes
If you do, you’ll be looking like, “Oh no”
It ain’t hard to see the G in me, and by G
I mean genius, the Spirit Bomb, the world needs to believe in me
I’m seeing my music, this is MP3-D
Y’all always be one away from blowing up like C3
