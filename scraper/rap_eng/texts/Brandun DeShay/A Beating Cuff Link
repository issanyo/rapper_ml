[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
Have you ever in your lifetime
Had someone in it, they left for flattening your lifeline
The last one you think about at night time
The reason you smile, the reason why you writing rhymes
And if they ever left, you'd be heartbroken
Bad habits, start drinking, start smoking
Whatever deals with the stress the best
Whatever nulls the pain of that beating shit in your chest
But you had to find out the hard way: heartbreak
Start taking it out on your friends if they partake
You starting to wonder if you'll ever let a new one there
Vacationed your love, take your heart as a souvenir
There's only so much pain you can sustain
One woman, no one may refuse to play the game
Refuse to play the fool, you losing like too often
You's asleep until you rest in piece in a coffin
But you get a second chance in your lifetime
To bring your heart back to life, spike your lifeline
It's a good sign, y'all hanging like nooses
The way she makes your heart beat, it's abusive
Trust me, I know how you feel like a masseuse would
Relationships aren't tailor made like a should
Be, you let them all inside of your chest
Open your heart, and hope it's not cardiac arrest
Then the end, but in the end, it's just the end, it's not the end, it's when we maul
Until we all fall in love, fuck them all
I don't mean to sound cynical
Or am I insane? But do people in general have an imbalance of chemicals?
Maybe indecisiveness
Tell me, are we loving or we fucking? Cause I couldn't ask the pastor or the scientist
They like vitamins, ions, the anions, but
Maybe if my heart stopped beating, it wouldn't hurt this much
Huh
