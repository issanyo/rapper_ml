[Intro: Gnarls Barkley (sample)]
It's cool being the only one

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
(I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)
Yeah, and it ain't hard to tell
With rhymes like mine, it ain't hard to sell
I know y'all feel like it's hard as shell
But I don't need Pro Tools, I'm hard as nails
Get it? And my heart is clear
Intentions, they can be seen
But sometimes fiction, it can seem deep
And sometimes reality can be dream
And I see Tetris, everything falls in place
And now they call me the electric eclectic
And I done seen them fall from grace
Like Quidditch and Hexus
And y'all might have next, but I got present
And I'm the future, now that's presence
And I'm gifted, I'm like presents
And I'm blessed with it, so God presents
To you, the one and the only
I can't lose, so I win, but I'm lonely
Kim Jong couldn't feel this [?]
I wasn't born with the world, this owe me
Nobody owe me shit
You say I ain't great? Dog, are you sick?
On every single track, I put a hundred percent
Wait...
(I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
I feel like these arms, none of these arms
None of these arms can hold me
I feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one
One and only
I feel like these arms, none of these arms
None of these arms can hold me
I feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one
One and only

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Only one can win, only one can win
Instead of out, I’m flunking in
To music, [?] sunken in
Using crack music, abusing it
No more Dr. Seuss in it, balancing act
Juggling life, love, math, and rap
Wack, I’ll be damned if my life’s in vain
Dog, I’d rather put a knife to veins
Hypothetically, I used to say I want to be the best
Now I want to be the best
And being better than the rest
Filled with the Cleveland steamers, I had to get some shit up off my chest
I’m a Treble clef, tell these boys rest with all that, you sound like ish
Who sound like this
Composing to sample a song
But give him a Yamaha and he could do it on his own
This ain’t a game, but I do it in a zone
God sunkissed, so I can’t be crushed
This must be genius, I can’t be rushed
Too legit to quit, I can’t be touched
I can’t be touched, but I hope y’all feel me
Even in death, y’all niggas couldn’t kill me
Don’t ask me how, I’ll just say
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
I feel like these arms, none of these arms
None of these arms can hold me
I feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one
One and only
I feel like these arms, none of these arms
None of these arms can hold me
I feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one
One and only
I feel like these arms, none of these arms (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)
None of these arms can hold me
I feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)
One and only
I feel like these arms, none of these arms (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)
None of these arms can hold me (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)
I feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)
One and only

[Outro]
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace
