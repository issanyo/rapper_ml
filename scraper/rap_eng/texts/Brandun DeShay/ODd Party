[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I had straight A's like a flat chest
On my rap shit, I run the web like arachnids
All this from a black kid from the west side of Chicago
The only way that I know that I'll go is fucking full throttle
Now that's a cool motto
That's all I've ever known since I started this
Thinking what I'm gonna do, but I should put my heart in this
Gotta play your part in this play and I'm playing the lead
I find it hard to miss playing for keeps, it's deep
DeShay

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
You've never heard me out before
All the girls adore me now
Insane and wild, it's crazy how it all worked out for me
Now, all the girls know my song
And they wanna take me home
I'm staying wild, it's crazy how it all worked out for me

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Even [?], down for me or get up and leave
Girl, you can't even get a apple, this ain't Adam & Eve
I actually just had a vision I was stuck in a tree
And these hoes be sticking me out like some [?] in your mouth
When asked who they favorite rapper, I always pick down south
And in my city, I'm a star, so girls know who I are
I don't even front, I'm in the back of the car
Looking at the back of your girl, she backing it all

[Verse 3: Joon]
I'm trying to stay the same, learn the power of the game
Keep my feet planted on the ground
But it's kinda hard being down to earth when they drumming off the earth
Keep my head in the clouds
Guess I'm taking and break it on down, I smoke weed for the hell of it
If you ain't 'bout your business, [?] then partner, don't even email us
Haters, I can't stomach them
All of them can Humpty Dumpty off the face of the earth
[?] mind of Columbus

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
You've never heard me out before
All the girls adore me now
Insane and wild, it's crazy how it all worked out for me
Now, all the girls know my song
And they wanna take me home
I'm staying wild, it's crazy how it all worked out for me

[Verse 4: P]
Oh, my God
That chick was bad, did you see her, dog?
[?] slow, let it flow, ain't gotta press too hard
Nice to see you today, would you come out and play?
I got a First Class ticket to the sky where I say
So tell your man "bon voyage"
The world loves OverDoz. and where we go, the crowd [?]
Make us feel it in their hearts
Get them high like spaceships, yeah, we taking off
Everything you wishing for, baby, I'm your shooting star

[Verse 5: Kent Jamz]
These L.A. girls ain't as innocent as they may seem
Shit, before they tweet me, they gotta go through Cream
Even if they got a cute laugh, big old butt
I'ma be looking like a Scream mask, baby, what's up?
I'm cannot [?], harder to see
All the models with ass all part of your needs
If you roll with more Crips, then it's harder to be
My ash used to be kush, so it's harder to see

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
You've never heard me out before
All the girls adore me now
Insane and wild, it's crazy how it all worked out for me
Now, all the girls know my song
And they wanna take me home
I'm staying wild, it's crazy how it all worked out for me
