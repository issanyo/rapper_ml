[All Verses: BrandUn DeShay]
I want you
I, I want you to listen to every word so you know it’s about you
I scream, cause damn it’s been a rocky road
This might seem confusing but you got me though
We’ll be the last to laugh
But we can’t move forward until we move past our past
I think we got caught up
Playin’ handyman, now we puttin’ them walls up
Nevermind, Everytime the past was brought up
We would say the rudest things that we could’ve thought of
But everytime we would think of giving it all up
We end up right back where we started, without trust
We gotta do more than that
We gotta do better than
We gotta show the world how to love, let’s set a trend

This love is the hardest thing that I had to let go
Cause you the one who taught me to let all this shit show
Cause I wasn’t good and that, and probably never will
So whether I stay or go, you’ll probly be better still
I swear it’s not that I care less
I’m just honestly careless. .with your heart
I swear that all my intentions were good
I apologize for being a stick in the mud
On those days you only wanted my company
I find a way to spend the whole day reluctantly
And just to fuck you up, I turn around and say something sweet
And now we both smilin' and layin' so comfortably
And everything’s new like we shook hands
You know I’m a bad boy, but I’m a good man
Unpredictable like Chicago Weather
Built a time machine just to love you forever
And when I get the green, everything’s on me
Four words I never wanna say:
Long time no see
Cause missin’ you is bad for my heart
I feel like Lord Voldemort how I split my soul apart, heh, horcruxes

I know it’s tough when I don’t show love back
Bring up the old times cause you want more of that
And you deserve it, but pride is what makes me a man
I swear it’s killin me damn I can’t murder it
A smart girl knows how to love
A smarter girl knows who to love
I’m smart enough to know it’s you I love
And some day the world ain’t gun’ know what to do with us
They say misery loves company
And you lookin’ like you could use someone to talk to
Need a guide in life? I’ll be your walkthrough
It won’t change, I got you
But if it’s not too late
Not talkin’ bout the time, I’m talkin bout me n’ you
So if it’s not too late for us, there’s something that I’ve always wanted to do

I wanted to bring her flowers
I wanted to bring her flowers to her job and we can watch the sunrise
I wanted to bring her flowers
I wanted to bring her flowers to her job and we can watch the sunrise
Sunrise
