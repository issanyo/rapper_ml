Can anyone live with Eartha Kitt?

That's not for me to decide. That's for someone who decides to live with me to decide. Not for me

But are you willing to compromise within a relationship?

To compromise? What is compromising? Compromising for what? Compromising for what reason? To compromise? For what? To compromise. What is compromise?

If a man came into your life, wouldn't you want to compromise?

(Hahaha) Stupid. A man comes into my life and I have to compromise? You must think about that one again. (laughs)
A man comes into my life and you have to compromise? For what? For what? For what? A relationship is a relationship that has to be earned! Not to compromise for! And I love relationships. I think they're fantastic. But one thing I think that's great I think is, nothing in the world more beautiful than falling in love. But falling in love for the right reasons. Falling in love for the right purpose. Falling in love. Falling in love. When you fall in love, what is there to compromise about?

[Verse 1]
Ise' got to make this quick
I don't want to waste time
Make it faster, stronger, deeper
Pulled out with the passion rolled out
Roll out on the red carpet
Roll out the chariot
Friar, dancing
By the fire
Singing
I'm leaving, tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight tonight
Yeah
Haven't we been here before
Haven't you heard the end of the story?
It isn't over yet
Keep patience on the left side of your brain
Virtues are relative
No pain
(Alright)
