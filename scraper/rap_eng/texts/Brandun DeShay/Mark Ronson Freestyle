[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
My attitude is on slut because I could really give a fuck if you like me
I can't rhyme with y'all like the color of Hi-C
In Roman numerals, you should give me a high-V
Get it? Because "V" means five and
You come to Chicago, you can see me live and
If one of you niggas rap, you're going to see me laughing
I don't mean to be rude because that was me two years ago
Almost, y'all brag, I'll boast
Y'all swag, I'll floss because swag rhymes with fag but floss rhymes with cost
I paid that to be the boss
Now all my ex-girls talking about, "I dated that guy"
And all the haters still talking about, "I hated that guy"
I'm like the Wright brothers, dog, I created what's fly
And one day, no more waiting in line
I thank God for all the fans that I got
But all my fans are my friends or my fam, so I'll be damned if I don't take my friends to the top
Front row, friends in the box
Cause in time, keep an eye on me like the hands on the clock
I swear, y'all, I'm on the ball like the hands on the block
And I ain't lying, but I don't stand for the nonsense
I named my dick Magic, they wonâ€™t stay off my Johnson
Yeah, and if anybody knows Mark Ronson
Tell him to hit me up with a phone call or a email
Trying my best to spare these rappers like details
MySpace wankstas, fake like Lee Nails
They're spitting in the booth, but no Proof like D12
Rest in peace to him, and if you got it right, I'll do it
That means I'll do it right, I felt I need to recite
Or reiterate, almost quit in a fit of rage
Because I don't get a lot of love on my Twitter page
But I had a couple of girls in a john, Ritter-way
I had to get away, dropped the trash like litter day
I'm sure they'll come back to haunt me like karma
But mamma, when it does, I'll get to running like Obama
Then I'll get to winning like a Kenyan, fly-like opinion
Make the best decision, in my opinion
Money over bitches, that's a win-win
I thank 2Pac for his envisions on division
Now, listen, all jokes aside
I'm bringing the CC's to keep hip-hope alive
Clear!

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Now, I'm gonna shut up and let y'all get the free beat
You chop it, you got it
Holla
