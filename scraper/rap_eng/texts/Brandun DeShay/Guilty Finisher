Yeah, brandUn DeShay
Beatbox station, let’s go

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
This here could be destiny
I’m in a footprints left of me
Am I feeling you right now? Definitely
Hollering “A Bay Bay” like the Chesapeake
I try to not to let the speakers speak
‘Cause my actions so loud
I know these other guys act foul
But try not to trip ‘cause when I put in the script how they gonna act now
Wow, feel bad dropping this line
Nervous, you got me going out of my mind
Telling you about the guys that have waste your time
If you wanna go [?] like Optimus Prime
Well, I’ll be your beast if you want to be my beauty
I know I’m far from the saint-like [?]
But I just want to be your man
I’ll kiss you on the brain in the shadow of the train
Over the light of the full blue moon
Anytime you leave, it’s too soon
I can’t think of nothing better that me and you together
Oh, you too?

[Hook: Yah Sed]
Round and round and round we go
It’s hard to tell us, carousel is
Spinning high, fast and slow
When no one’s waiting while it’s spinning round

[Verse 2: Aris P!]
Can’t wait the moment of words will only take a second
I know I’m sad, least still blessed by your presence
Just by your essence, you put me in a trance
Be glad when God bless me to put me in your plans
Man, your voice is my favorite song when I hear it
In fact, the [?] in my tongue is a lyric
I’m obsessed with the spirit, trying to see the blame
Why you don’t know this? Even science can’t explain
How I feel, I would love to carry you away
Too afraid to talk, for the fear of scaring you away
So, I think about, “what should I say now?”
[?] situation just to play out
I keep telling myself, “some other time”
But hate seeing you walk away with some other guy
So, if I want to begin to finalize, then
I got to make a move to stop this fantasizing

[Hook: Yah Sed]
Round and round and round we go
It’s hard to tell us, carousel is
Spinning high, fast and slow
When no one’s waiting while it’s spinning round
