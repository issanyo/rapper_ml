[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
I’m just…
I was just wondering if…
I mean, it feels good, but…
This can’t be forever

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
We stand at the gates, seats twenty-six
I ask myself if I can get through this
Again and again
All I can see is you kissing me and you go in the flame
I watch it as it goes higher and higher
And I can see the tears in your eyes still
Even though you’re far away, I heard Usher say
He’ll give a penny for your thoughts like Hardaway
It’s just the hard knock life, like the Carter say
Anticipating your arrival like the Carter 3
I don’t know what got to me, now it’s your way
It’s like life ain’t the same and I miss the monotony

[Chorus: Sample]
One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four nights and then away
Both under influence
We had divine sense
To know what to say
Mind is a razor-blade

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
And they cut so deep
One more night and I might Freak…azoid
‘Cause I’m so blue, it might seem farfetched
But it’s hard watching the sunrise when you’re far watching the sunset
Two ends of the sky
But you’re always next to my
Heart, just don’t hit it like Benassi
It’d be me and you like Cassie
Think about it if you ask me

[Outro: Sample]
And you, you knew the hand of a devil
And you, kept us awake with wolves' teeth
Sharing different heartbeats in one night
