[Verse 1]
I think I might of knew in the beginning
Before you I thought how I never love
But now look how now I'm up in it
And don't lie I try [inaudible] catching all these feelings
Worn it out
Last one took your heart and tore it out
Had some fuckboys probably worn it out
But those days 'gon fade now we growing it out and I know

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Wait a minute I, got something to say I want to say aloud
Found the one, I'm sure that i wanna settle down with you
Oh baby
Got me so struck
Imma' hold it down to the end and i know
You put in time, you work it out, your on your grind, that's why no song ever rhymes without you

[Refrain]
Said something 'bout [inaudible] I just can't ignore
It's moments like this when my whole hand in yours
So while that I'm with you my best friend and more
There's no doubt I'm here baby
(Let's get it)

[Chorus]
The world can't take my place for you
I love how you do it
It feels like heaven was made for two
And I'm so into you
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my, baby

[Verse 3]
Got a feeling only Jay and Bey'll get it
What it's like to have love and no one fucking wit' it
It's no exaggeration or comparison with
I wanna' marry this chick
I been giving you the business like you inherited it
I get it pumping like a button on a brake light, late night, you can spread-eagle watch this tape flight
They might (pshh)
Try to hate us on the low
But deep down they know our relationship was goals

[Verse 4]
Just lay me down baby
Just a little more of the drink and I'll be gone so i wrap my arms around you I know you got me too
Lay me down baby
Maybe, it's meant to be how you got me

[Chorus]
The world can't take my place for you
I love how you do it
It feels like heaven was made for two
And I'm so into you
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my baby
That's my, baby
