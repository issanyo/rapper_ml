[Chorus: brandUn DeShay & Kanye West (Sampled)]
The world's screaming, "I miss you"
But I'm too fly, it's gonna take a Scud missile
Just to shoot me down
There ain't no shooting me down
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
When I was up, thinking about my future, just imagining
Watching superstars was like porn for the passionate
Asking if it's meant for me to be there and someday they'll be watching me
I possess the talent like apostrophe-
S, so you can probably guess that I'll be there in a year
Listening to this is like hearing history in your ear
At least it's three in the making, man, there's dreams for the taking
I snatch them up and watch them start waking, their alarm clock shaking
But it's too late, I already done made it, dude
Take my dreams and make them true and watch your dreams break in two
Make a move 'cause ain't nobody handing them out
â€‹brandUn is out and if it ain't raining, I won't stand in a drought
I gotta do what I can do best, I'm getting attention like I'm two breasts
I'll admit it, if I get it, we all get it
It's all written in the stars, I've been reading it
You need to be living it if you be-lieve in it, come on

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay & Kanye West (Sampled)]
The world's screaming, "I miss you"
But I'm too fly, it's gonna take a Scud missile
Just to shoot me down
There ain't no shooting me down
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
You can bring the whole world, still ain't no stopping me
The first DeShay to hit the stage, I represent properly
If he was still alive, I bet you this is what Pac would be
Got a buzz and I'm fly, but yet, there still ain't no swatting me
I bet they gon' copy me, I'm used to these posers
But real life is still life, I used to be posing
I got it in the bag, so yeah, I feel like a grocer
I just do what I'm supposed to
It's fake, I ain't cake, but yet, I got it like posters
I'm up the wall until I'm on posters
First inning, yet I feel like a closer
Not the best and the closest, a nigga got his eye on the road, so
Give me a call when it's over...
(Phone ringing)
So soon?

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay & Kanye West (Sampled)]
The world's screaming, "I miss you"
But I'm too fly, it's gonna take a Scud missile
Just to shoot me down
There ain't no shooting me down
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
The world's screaming, "I miss you"
But I'm too fly, it's gonna take a Scud missile
Just to shoot me down
There ain't no shooting me down
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
I'm feeling (high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker)
