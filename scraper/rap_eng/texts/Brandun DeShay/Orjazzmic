[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
She said, "I wouldn't kiss you even if you was the last man on Earth"
But what if I was the first?
What if the ones that you had in the past was really your worst and I was your best?
Tell me, how could you rest?
I'm sorry, I had to get that off of my chest
It just kills me to know you deserve much better
Don't mean to sound harsh, but I was taught
When you see a girl you want, then you need to go get her
I got your attention, that's half of the battle
I know you're feeling me, I can tell like a tattle
And honestly, it don't really matter to me
That your ass fat 'cause, girl, you look bad in jeans
Passionately, I love it with a passion
But I still love you, even without the fashion
You ain't high class, but you so high fashion and that's it
The reason why you got me, you got it

[Chorus]
Uh, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, for us

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Damn, girl
Everything I need, girl, you got it
You got hips and you got tits
You got wits and you got steez
But most importantly, you got me
You got me going and I don't know when I might stop
I'm trying to see where this can go when the lights off (turn the lights off)
I already got enough money in my pockets
So work, I be taking off like a rocket
And we could stick together like pocky and ride to the beach
Drowning in an ocean of sheets back at the crib
You can see the pad where I live
Don't pay me no mind while I admire your lips
The more you give for me, the higher you get
I ain't dope, I'm more like the high that you get
We could put my tape in and rewind it
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it

[Chorus]
Uh, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, for us

[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
We got about an hour to get intimate, an hour to get into it
An hour to get out of it before we get grounded, heh
I can hear the leaves whisper in the trees
Everybody's got a secret, but they're keeping it from me
But maybe I'm the secret and they're keeping me from thee
I'm the best kept secret, but the whole world peeping
I know that you can see it in my eyes, I see me in yours
Can you feel my heart? I see me in yours
Access grant you whatever you wish for, it's yours
I'm a lamp in the sand, boo
I'll on-demand you, learn to turn you on
It's a lot more fun without using the manual
I know it ain't much that I can't do, it's you
For doing can't do's, I can do it for you. for you
For real

[Chorus]
Uh, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, for us
Uh, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, its not the end, um
Um, for us
