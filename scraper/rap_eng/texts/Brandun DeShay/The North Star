[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
BrandUn DeShay
Milly
Troubled Youth
Yo, I feel, like, mad focused at the moment, like
I must have OD'd on some imaginary Vitaminwater
But, uh
I'm good right now
Yeah

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I'm 'bout-'bout-'bout to switch it up, yeah, I'm feeling it now
Confident, 'cause looking down isn't really my style
I tried rocking it for a while, it turned out [?] and plain
[?] if you know what I'm saying
The rap game's need a lyricist, they need me next
So they'll feed me checks until I kick back like a knee reflex
I guess, I got the demands so I'll supply them with the finest
Or the flyest
[?] Harlem Globetrotters, unless you're with them
When you're blessed with a face like this, they won't forget him
Like your first kiss, but this, see how it's more crazy
'Cause I'm before my time like a premature baby
Been more mature lately, talk to mature ladies
And frankly, a circle of squares is what shaped me
My raps going off the scale, you can't rate me
So hate me
What else can you do, right?

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
Actions speak louder than words and I ain't made a sound
I take action like verbs and got to make it out
I can't lose my way (Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out)
Actions speak louder than words and I ain't made a sound
I take action like verbs and got to make it out
I can't lose my way (Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out)
Lose my way

[Verse 2: Milly July]
Milly July
I fantasize, so I'm laying in the clouds
To be at the most high construction of the land
Current create the water, we label hurricane
Who's at fault for being not here [?]
[?] unclear, should I put it on my shoulder, walk into the fitness
Please be kind and keep feelings
In mind, ought the feeling, but we healing
My will to leave
And choking getting harder to ever breathe
I [?] to see if I can ever leave
I don't care how heavier it gets
I deal with it comes, go ahead and make yourself known
Left the goal of the baby, go home
And [?] that, you can't ask
Until you sleep where you [?] on mattress
And you creep when the lights aren't flashing
And you seek to the so-called mountain
And you drink from a so-called fountain

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
