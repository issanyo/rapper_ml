[Intro: Samples]
*instrumental*
Yay!
Do you want to hear it?

[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
Oh yeah
Now, I don’t know it all, but a couple things I do know
The music is a talent, you can’t plan it like Pluto
You got to thank God, but with more than a cool, though
If you can keep your money stacking better than a Juno
Be real, not pseudo, honesty’s the best policy
And honestly, there’s no one hotter than me, probably
Honestly, I can be a lot of things, anything
As long as I got my man God with me
Any dream can turn into reality, even when their hearts turn cold like Natalie
I never let it sadden me
And if you want battle me
I find a way to [?] past shield, then I eat them like it’s fattening
Tried to put the pressure on me ‘cause they want to flatten me
But all my tracks fat, so all they did was flatter me
I know when they be sampling, using throwbacks so they lateraling
So I can always tell like I’m tattling

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
And I don’t got to write ‘cause my freestyle’s great
But every time I write, I’m in a freestyle state
I never let my pen stop moving until I’m finished
And when it stops moving, then I’m finished
Like, I know this is God-given talent
Haters try to stop me but they only got the slip like balance
Never slip, my balance is right on the center
Whichever label that sign me, probably right on the center
And it’s all too common in these recent years
Though word of God could probably hardly reach the ears
Of the youth, and it starts in the booth
Cavity search but not the kind find in the tooth
Too many others know it all too well, in a box like a clothes line
The club fights the only time we take it outside
So I’m just praying that they feel what I’m saying like is real
Not only do they hear, but they feel
There’s a reason I’m singing this song, I’m not talking until my face turns blue
I’m talking until my [?] face turns blue
I know this much is true like [?]
But follow me, follow my moves and you can be the man too
