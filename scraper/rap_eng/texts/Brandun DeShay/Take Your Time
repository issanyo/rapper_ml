2 am I'm lying in my bed
Getting tired of lying to myself
Every day it's like another line
I say I need you but you need some time
It's you I wanna be together with
But you just wanna be together-ish
What's with all the hesitate
All this good love I got here waiting

And you know that my patience has been strong
But I won't be waiting for forever alone
It's time that we take a step and finally figure out
What this love is really all about
Friends just ain't friendly enough no

Take your time woah
(Take a breath) yeah (hold it count to ten)
Take your time
(Keep it in) woah (take a swim) yeah ([?]) oh

More of these emotions every day
More reasons why I try to stay
Why I find excuse why you can find a way
Sound like something mama say mama say mama sigh [?]
Girl I love you so much Ima take you so my favorite taco spot

Say [?] I shouldn't of give you my all
All those broken promises won't break my fall
It's time that we take a step and finally figure out
What this love is really all about
Friends just ain't friendly enough no

Take your time woah
(Take a breath) yeah (hold it count to ten)
Take your time
(Keep it in) woah (take a swim) yeah ([?]) oh

Take your time
(Take a breath) ill be right here
(hold it) make up your mind (count to ten)
(Keep it in)Taking your time (take a swim [?])
