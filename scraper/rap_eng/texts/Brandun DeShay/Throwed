[Intro]
Welcome to goldUn Child: 2
Yeah, y’all make sure y’all turn this shit the fuck up
Know what I’m saying?
All the way the fuck up

[Verse]
Back in Japan, I’m on track for them bands
And they in, passing hands like it’s stacks in demand
Fuck a check, I need my cash in advance
Trying to stack a stack, I can’t go back to my parents
Shake it fast, you make it clap but no hands
All this have me taking backers like, “damn”
But really in chance
Sitting there, wondering how the fuck she gon’ fit all that ass in her pants
I got bleach in my hair, now I’m gon’ Super Saiyan
And my hair match my chain
Don’t do no Oscars, my niggs act insane
Blow up cartridge, game eject, the same effect as crack on the range
Take a look at my DMs
Hoes wanna fuck with me, bros wanna BM
Treat your wifey like a hoe
She out here with me, getting low and she told you she was playing Pokémon GO
Oh, these hoes out here tripping hard
Honestly, can’t tell these chicks apart
Basic bitches think they fit the part
I only miss you when my dick is hard
Yeah, I moved to L.A., making Cali classics
I done fucked a few hoes out in Calabasas
Got it sold, but I don’t do no haberdashing
I pull up looking lit, but I’m glad you asked me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I’m throwed (we steady turning up)
With my niggas (we deep and we showing up)
And this liquor, too (we steady pouring up)
And it’s lit (yeah, we get it going up)
Yeah, I’m throwed (we steady turning up)
With my niggas (we deep and we showing up)
And this liquor, too (we steady pouring up)
And it’s lit (yeah, we get it going up)
Yeah, I’m throwed (we steady turning up)
With my niggas (we deep and we showing up)
And this liquor, too (we steady pouring up)
And it’s lit (yeah, we get it going up)
Yeah, I’m throwed (we steady turning up)
With my niggas (we deep and we showing up)
And this liquor, too (we steady pouring up)
And it’s lit (yeah, we get it going up)
