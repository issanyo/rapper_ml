[Verse 1: Lyricks]
Major impact
Y.O.X. moving I made your head crack
We all over the place
My new name is now "when'd you get back?"
JL don't stand for John Lee
It's short for Jet Lag
Bag weigh 'bout 60 pounds
Old clothes, man I left that
Fuck an uber
Mark in a Buick back where we left at
Grab a couple drinks in Flushing then rush down to LeFrak
I don't care when the next at
As long as they take care of the team
With couple green bottles some weed and the check fat
Underground king, money coming in like I'm Bun B
You're doing your thing when you see 4 seasons in one week
You know you on a streak when the rest weak
But you keep killing
Shot a video last week in the streets of East Village
Scold youngin', he ain't lowered the blunt as the cops passed
The "I don't give a fuck" mental' will only get you caught fast
You have be on point especially when you rock the YOX mask
Represent that next level shit, you must have forgot that

[Verse 2: JL]
I'm the moment they finally show you the monster's face
You're not gonna want to miss this
This is neither the time or the place for convincing
This is win-win's
Reinventing the methods we been did
Been this since
Clicking ink in the Kid Pix and getting my shit kicked
For sticking middle fingers up at the big kids
Fuck a lesson
I wasn't meant to be nothing but upper level
Everything thing uppin' the level of thinking ever since "Seven Rings"
Never predicted
Surviving in any conditions
An ox can roam around and keep going for any distance
So YOX can go on tour and then tour again in a blink
And make an album in the winter then tour again 'til its Christmas
This is what you wanted right?
That 9-5 sound
And you astounded
Cuz now you found some guys who finally done it right
We got a name that you'll be hearing a lot
Now welcome to the decade of the Year Of The Ox

[Verse 3: Lyricks and JL]
Yo
People gonna talk, I don't care so I let em carry on
We bout to be in the air, me and J are carrying a carry on
Drinking a perrier reclinin' the chair and we already off
Why's your hand in the air?
Cause I need a beer and a Evian
Your attitude gets shifted when your altitude gets lifted
They ain't mad at you cause you're gifted
They just mad they haven't did shit
It's a different kind of high while they shoutin' lines as you kick it
And its a different type of fly when you know your rhymes bought the ticket
STAY FLYING
International demand for the YOX
Landed in Canada still got Hawaiian sand in my socks
Still got 'em standing in shock
Still can't manage to walk
A still picture couldn't capture just how bananas it got
About as nutty as Buddy Love from the Nutty Professor was
Without a fuck to give about the damage it brought
And without a fuck to give about what anyone knows
Things are going where we said it would go
IT'S Y O X
