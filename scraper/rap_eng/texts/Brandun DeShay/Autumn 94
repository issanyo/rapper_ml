[Intro]
Three, two, one
Perfect score

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
It was the first day of school
Been waiting on this moment since 'bout '92
I hopped on the bus with my Barney backpack
First, latch full of snacks as I headed to the back
I look out the window as I see my mom tearing up
Her eyes watery, but my sinuses is clearing up
I hopped off the bus and we all line up
My last name made me last as we walked to the class
The last thing made me laugh was this chick in the front
Pink Power Rangers shirt that was dirty as uf
But the Power Rangers is cool, yeah, I'm digging it, too
Matter of fact, she's kind of cute, yo, I'm digging her, too
It's too bad that the cooties infected all of the cuties
Cause at show and tell, she brought Ninja Turtles, the movie
And then Total Recall, my favorite joints, you heard
We can have a playdate whenever she wants

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
We've been together since level one
You're player two, but you'll always be my number one
You're my number one
We've been together since level one
You're player two, but you'll always be my number one
You're my number one

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Now, a couple years passed, learned art, learned math
Ended up in gifted class because I learned to learn fast
And up in the seat right next to you
And at lunch, we'd trade Gushers and vegetables
Who'd have known I'd like celery sticks?
Now you got me eating carrots with peanut butter and celery dip
Then, after school, we're both playing Sega and ish
She had the controller, instead of three buttons, it's six
Two hours out of the day, it's Streets of Rage
Beating the game, I'm Axel, you're Blaze
Even though I looked like Skate, Saturday morning
I'm over your house, watching Batman and yawning
I'm thinking about passing out, you're thinking it, too
We both take a nap, does that count as sleeping with you?
Then we both wake up and the dream is over
I wake up in Illinois, you wake up in California
That's messed up, but...
I mean, you'll always be my number one
You're my number one
Yeah
We've been together since level one
You're player two, but you'll always be my number one
Yeah

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
We've been together since level one
You're player two, but you'll always be my number one
You're my number one

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
This isn't the end of the story
There's a lot more to it
Tomorrow, I'll see you again
