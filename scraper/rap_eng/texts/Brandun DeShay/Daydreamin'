[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]
Yo, while I daydreamed I came across a matrix glitch
Red pill or blue pill my conscious can't play with this
Took the red pill my world turned like a dreidel spin
I'm soon to blow up like yamcha versus the saibamen
I continue on this journey
I'm feeling like an alien round a bunch of Sigourneys
My future looking radiant, lately I'm feeling earthly
I feel that some hate me, debating, they not certain
I gotta couple dreams and I have a couple hopes
A double self esteem and some fans that say I'm dope
I started as a seed and I'm glad they see my growth
And the ones that doubted me is the ones that say we close
Yo people don't understand just blame your medulla
Labeled a loser made fun of cause I'm not a user
People on that bullshit but far from Carlos Boozer
The only one awake around these snoozers so I just

Uh, I wake up from my slumber, mind on wonder
Beautiful broad under my arm bright as summer
She coming close to a she wakes
Sun peeks through my window
Penthouse views, some louboutin house shoes I slip in em
Then slip out, routine then I dip out
Garage full of cars like a dealership I pick out
That iroc-z t-top like the dinosaur
My iphone beeps girl text me her vaginasaur
Wow, backin out manhattan streets full of peeps
Actin wild, fans packin, beats slappin, we stackin billboard hits
World famous on that top 10 countdown
Hot 97 really boutta get hot now
When grammys come around boutta have that on lock down
If he wasn't before shit well 2Pac back now
I lie down in my PJ seat right about now my alarm clock beeps
I been...
