[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Kanye said it's good to be home
Well, DeShay said it's good to be lone
And they say it's not where you from, it's where you at
So that's who you do it for
What the hell have you done?

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I'm from the Chi, that's the C-H-I
And that H-I mean we take them high, so high
I'd like to welcome you, this is where the rapper was born
And normal was killed, so I ain't had no twist to rebuild
Born, not raised, been here for just four years, but who cares?
Flyest thing out of Chicago since O'Hare
Oh, hell hath no fury like these streets, I'll bet it
It ain't nothing sweet, we diabetics
I ain't let it get ahold of me, I handled it first
Building a dream, but I had to write the manual first
Or the blueprint, depending on who you ask
Can show me my respect like I'm flying at half mast
I waited so late to get fly, now you're calling me red eye
Was seventeen before I made up my mind
So thank God that's finally made up
Nutritional facts, so now you know what we made of
Chi-town, stand up

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
And I'm repping it everywhere we go
Every city, every show
They know, they know
And I'm repping it everywhere we go
Every city, every show
They know, they know

[Verse 2: QuESt]
They built my city off the devil's face [?]
Immigration and Cubans and sexual intercourse
Tony Montana idolization
Scarface and [?] it's the blueprint
But let me give you my two cents: Miami Gardens is the city
Where everything is cool unless you dress a little pretty
The women be sadity, but under Creflo, we call them jones
Treat them to a drink or two, guarantee you take them home
Party and bullshit, lavish environment
Hustle and it's mandatory
So many cultures, it's hard to tell a single story
Yanks versus O's, jones versus hoes
Swear my city is cold
But the weather's immaculate
A city without a season at all
Word to Shawn, Chris, which we don't [?], we stack chips
Forward progression, never backwards
That's why...

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
And I'm repping it everywhere we go
Every city, every show
They know, they know
And I'm repping it everywhere we go
Every city, every show
They know, they know
And I'm repping it everywhere we go
Every city, every show
They know, they know
And I'm repping it everywhere we go
Every city, every show
They know, they know
