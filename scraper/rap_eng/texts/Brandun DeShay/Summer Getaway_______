[Intro]
여보세요?
Ayyy, whaddown?
자기야
완전 보고싶어
한국엔 언제와?
이번 자기 새로 나온곡 들었는데 완전 좋더라
집 가서 문자해

[Verse 1]
Got me a fix
Korean, she thick
Met on a trip
She's always wondering bout when
I'm bound to come in
She wanna commit
But she gon be missed
When I leave in fall
Pussy game, girl, it's A1
You keep it cooler than naengmyeon
Treat you like one of my "day ones"
Didn't wanna have to say nothing
But youre probably the best
Looking at you like a God in the flesh
I be feigning, oh, I gotta confess
Plotted on you, now I got you undressed
Buck wild, then we do it again
Busan, maybe two of your friends
Too turnt when we at Itaewon
You know I love it, 너의 모든 점
Why would you, why would you
Why would you front?
No gas, girl, you bad as you want
You say, "Ok, Ok..."
Is you ready?
Yea, yea

[Chorus]
You take my hand
We'll take a ride
Almost can taste those sherbet skies
I'll be looking forward to summer
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
I'm on a wave
You wanna ride
Feels like I've waited all my life
I'll be looking forward to summer
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)

[Bridge]
We gotta get away
We gotta get away
We gotta getaway
We gotta getaway
We gotta getaway
We gotta getaway
We gotta getaway

[Verse 2]
I just need one more dance
You show your feelings like On Demand
You wanting me to be your only man
Strolling through Seoul while we holding hands
'Know you're all mine, I don't wanna share
'Know you've got feelings you wanna share
Don't gotta wonder, I know it's there
Your love is rare like a Dragonair
Said, "Are you ready for difficult times?"
Got all these differences and all this distance now
Miles and miles
Oh yea
But I'll hold you down
I feel it in my bones
I been waiting so long
'Got everything that I've been wanting so bad
Fuck what them people be talking bout
Girl, we just gon have to work it out
You know that I won't be here for too long
But you wait...

[Chorus]
You take my hand
We'll take a ride
Almost can taste those sherbet skies
I'll be looking forward to summer
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
I'm on a wave
You wanna ride
Feels like I've waited all my life
I'll be looking forward to summer
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)
(I'll be..)

[Bridge]
We gotta get away
We gotta get away
We gotta getaway
We gotta getaway
We gotta getaway
We gotta getaway
We gotta getaway
