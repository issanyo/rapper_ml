[VERSE: DeShay at 5 years old]

I'm screaming "God, WYA?"
I look up in the sky, I know you staring back
Not sure the reason why you have me here, in fact
Rare and black, derelict, guess being blessed is where I lack
If all I got is my nuts, I'm lucky to have a pair intact
I'm having troubles at home, I'm starting trouble at school
That type of shit'll make it hard to fall in love, but its cool
Behind these glasses and these watery eyes, I hope I see the sign
Ain't one for wasting time, I rather let the blind lead the blind
While most of these niggas follow in line
I got my own mind, so I'm following mine
So fuck swallowing pride, I won't swallow shit
I rather kiss my brain with a hollow tip
This wisdom couldn't fall from Aristole's lips
I never learned the politics, never the model kid
Constantly out of it, daydreaming of being in a room with Pharrell gotta me constantly sick
Questioning God, now I gotta repent
It took a lot just to acknowledge the shit
I'm popping, now she wanna polish the grip
Bukake in a new Bugatti and dip
Finally got the key and now you fucking with a locksmith
Was a good boy, now he gone bad
Made it out alive and I ain't going back
Getting bored of boarding planes, storing bags
Fall asleep, I'm balling in a foreign Jag'
I hit the stage, I'm feeling highly elated
Foust my brother, feeling highly sedated
People prolly wondering how we related, nigga we made it!
We pulling bunnies like it's magic
We counting money and we laughing
But don't get it twisted, far from rich, but bougie bitches blowing kisses when we passing
Put that on the green like we golfing, she blew the top like a dolphin
Bury me with a bitch in my coffin
They won't ever see me often
I don't listen, why you talking?
I don't listen, why you talk?
These spineless niggas tryna walk?
They love when I fuck up a check
Spend it, then stashing the rest
Finna invest like a chest, yes
Nothing more, nothing less
Naruto said it the best, "Question your belief, it'll be over"
Never trip to finish last, cash in every single chip that on my shoulder
The city got me growing colder, I'm more than happy to admit
Wake up every morning, know I gotta get it
I'll be damned I'm dying with a Honda Civic
Found a fountain full of youthful water flowing from a spigot, got me vamping like a misfit
Thoughts to end it with my wrists slit
Get pushed out my mind, I don't wanna stop
Think it's over, when I know it's not
Fans that's feigning for some more to drop
Always stop me for the photo op
Haters prolly say it's Photoshop
4AM I hit the store and cawp
A couple Redbulls for the nights I wake up in a cold sweat
Dream of life, living no stress
I'll just work it out like a Bowflex
When my time comes and it's all said and done, wondering what I'm gonna find next
Know that even if I never get the cred, I'mma die knowing I'm the best

Well, either way...
And that's all that I got
