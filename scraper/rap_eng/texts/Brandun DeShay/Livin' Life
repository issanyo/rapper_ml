[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
We ain't your average rappers with pants sagging
Dappily damn ragging, happily fan-smashing
Nah, we them damn bastards passively playing happily
Saying actually stand with the shit that we love
At the same time, they saying we selling out
And yet, they on my dick, thank God that I'm well-endowed
Go crowning the well-endowed
Pessimist, you're exercised excellence
Just a estimate, but from my say, I move my best in this
Went from texting chicks 'til they fall asleep
To sexing chicks 'til they fall asleep
My, how things have changed, yet and still, I yell "FML"
Fuck my life 'cause it's getting raped by these poltergeists
Ghosts of the past, folks in my path
Turning the notes in my pad, they ain't even all that bad
Me and Ev4n Holt rode like a devil coat
So better hope your girl don't open throat like the letter O

[Chorus: Ev4n Holt & brandUn DeShay]
Got a nickel and a dime (feel like)
Actually stand with the shit that we love (feel like)
Still gotta day-to-day grind (feel like)
Doing everything that I please (oh, oh)
Got a nickel and a dime (feel like)
Actually stand with the shit that we love (feel like)
Still gotta day-to-day grind (feel like)
Doing everything that I please (oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Ev4n Holt]
Woke up, hungover from the night before
To a note outside of my door
"Dear sir, your 30 days is up, grab your stuff"
Just my luck, what the fuck?
This happens to me all the time
218? I'm 219, this isn't mines
Even though I barely got a nickel and a dime
I still gotta day-to-day grind
Behind MacBooks and Windows
Creased up three-piece suits and gym clothes
White T-shirts, Converse, and Timbos
Lies, they ending me
They ending me of self, no pun intended
It's like I'm at trial, no lawyer for the defendant
Playing D in the key, unable to defend it
Not knowing your test was extended to another day
You made mistakes, learn from them and keep moving
Cruising onto the next one and happily
On my way, taking my time, I'll make it gradually
You actually thought that I would give it up, right?
But I can't, I'm addicted to the fast life
Taking shots, rolling blunts like every night
Living nice up in Black man's paradise
Doing everything that I please, fuck the price

[Chorus: Ev4n Holt & brandUn DeShay]
Got a nickel and a dime (feel like)
Actually stand with the shit that we love (feel like)
Still gotta day-to-day grind (feel like)
Doing everything that I please (oh, oh)
Got a nickel and a dime (feel like)
Actually stand with the shit that we love (feel like)
Still gotta day-to-day grind (feel like)
Doing everything that I please (oh, oh)
