[Intro]
Hate me for being me
But I love it
Ha, I love it!

[Hook]
Not for nothin'
Thank God the past is somethin'
Tracks we bumpin'
A1, put nuttin' above it
Oh I love it, oh-oh-oh I love it
Oh I love it, oh-oh-oh I love it

[Verse]
Fuck with me
They say to be the man, takes bucks to be
I've always been the man though luckily
I do it for the family that stuck with me
Been through the smooth and the tough with me
We gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off cause I feel no lost
Know this is a luxury, I got love for these
Who gon' ride but they still they own boss
Rhymin' again wit' no sauce, blowin' they mind
They got heat, well I got about [?] in this rhyme
Cause on chief when I get up on beats
How I make 'em all [?], when I'm high, got em so intertwined
The flow and the grind
The condo will take it to the top
Ain't let me in, so I'm breakin' all the locks
Hard to believe, so I'mma take another route
[?] when I break the banks and I'm out
Smooth as a criminal
Show up with the girl that was nude in the centerfold
Far from my lane cause a nigga got game
Like a Japanese [?] women though
I'm 'bout to blow
Like a bitch that was picky until she found out 'bout my Wiki
She know I'm the shit, so she show off her titties
She so off the shit, she forget she was with me
Damn

[Hook]
Not for nothin'
Thank God the past is somethin'
Tracks we bumpin'
A1, put nuttin' above it
Ya'll was buggin'
Too cool , fully stubborn
[?]
[?], the crew was clubbin'
Oh I love it, oh-oh-oh I love it
Oh I love it, oh-oh-oh I love it
Oh I love it, oh-oh-oh I love it
Oh I love it, oh-oh-oh I love it

[Outro]
I love it
I love it I love it I love it, yeah
I love it I love it I love it, yeah
I love it I love it I love it, yeah
I love it I love it
