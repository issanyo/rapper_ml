[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
I told my dude Drake Johnson
Not THE Drake, obviously
Whatever, though
But I told him I wasn't gonna hop on this beat
But circumstances change

[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
Now I am on a 24-hour, dope beat diet
Spitting without writtens, I discourage you from trying it
Thinking you can rap like me, you're better off denying it
Flies on me because I'm on the shit, but I am on that fly shit
Get it? That fly shit, that shit that the fly did
They telling me I'm losing it, but I ain't trying to find it
Running laps around you niggas, I ain't trying to time it
Really, I'm just talking, coincidentally, it's rhyming
I seen the hands of fate, hmm, I'm in
Now do what I say like Simon or get maimed like a lion
Drinks is on the house, hell, I'm buying
I found this credit card outside
And it ain't mine, so why not?
Lupe's new pupils getting big, give me some eye drop
Whoa, did you not just hear that rhyme that I just dropped?
Go back and listen to that, like, 20 times
I got plenty rhymes
I did this in six hours, imagine what
I'll do for volume three, February is the release
So go and cop it when I drop that shit
I'll get the toilets stopped up
Bitch

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Man, fucking 4:30 in the morning
I'm having too much fun right now
And I... did I not mention that I produce?
So it's not just the rapping shit
Everything is easy
I swear, I was born to do this
And on that note...
