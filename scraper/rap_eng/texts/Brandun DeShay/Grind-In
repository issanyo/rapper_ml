[Intro]
So this what Brooklyn look like at it's finest, huh?

[Verse 1]
I used to suck at everything except rapping, I took advantage
Put problems on instrumentals and managed to make 'em vanish
She fronting yesterday but she wanna see me tomorrow
Shawty play me so much, my nickname was Grand Theft Auto
Plus my environment was real, I seen CJ's and cops
Looking for stars in foreign cars
Lord, they're tryna get me, it's all a trap I say
I'm just tryna feed my mommy with these raps I say
And these tracks I slay, walking, leaving my footmark
Instant history, just a tab away from your bookmark
So far we doing good for ourself, that's what these teachers say
They waiting for my year, I bet they never see the day
Futuristic, egotistic youngin with scriptured lyrics
Tryna be the God of rapping, no disrespect religion
I keep em rocking from Crenshaw to (?)
You had your time, now the clock is ticking
I mean taken, breaking radio stations, tell em play my joint
Then when we go pop and the celibate target, but I stays on point
Hip-Hop, word

[Hook]
Getting my grind, and my grind in, I'm getting it
Ain't nothing handgiven, we no longer children, we making a living

[Verse 2]
I used to suck at everything except faking, now I'm the realer one
Chicks going bananas, I never used to appeal to them
Television screen hold my images, I'm the champ who
Who changed the conditions I was living in
All them dudes was tripping it, tryna plot on taking what A had
Even if you cancel Freaknik you couldn't get the A mad
I'm focused, and Brooklyn's responsible for my concentration
And these tracks help me communicate with different races
Fire the shot, man your speech struggle
Can't find the words to describe the pain, we all need Ruzzle
My dedication on a hundred better get running cause you done it
Anything in front of something where you want it
I'm like y'all don't like y'all music, can't none of y'all touch what I be doing
Radio promoting all this trash, but you wonder why the fame is ruined
I know why, cause y'all ain't bumping the 'Stroster, or nothing like it
And that's cool, but it just ain't exciting
Bow down to the youngin that's catching wreck, I'm up next
Protect next before I excess and expect
Nothing less than the best of the rugged raw perfection
As I continue to progress in every single session
For real
