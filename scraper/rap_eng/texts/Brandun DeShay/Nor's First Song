[Intro: brandUn DeShay (sample)]
(Hold it now!)
Alright
Should be real simple now
Of course
Just
You already asked her out
So sit in the movie with her
Say hi, say something nice
Keep your hands to your pockets, man
Okay, here she comes
(Hold it now!)

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I usually think I’m the coolest, but now I think I’m the loser
It’s obvious that you knew this, but here we are at the movies
I didn’t think I could do this, went into this kind of clueless
But what the heck? I’m trying to live my life out to the fullest
But now it’s like, I’m trying to live my life out like a Buddhist
‘Cause I ain’t saying a word, but be one with the ruler
And all that I really know is that you’re living, no rove
And you’re not into the guys that rock the bullets
I’m at the end of the road, you’re two seats to the right
I should be sitting next to you, but it’s all on me
I don’t want to walk to the lows, I had to walk on my toes
‘Cause I think you might be a little taller than me
But yet and still, I feel like there could really be a chance
If I could turn from my friends and give you a chance
Looks like I’m gonna end this hype with my face in my hands
How to sneak a cue from Cupid, but nah that nigga is stupid
I’m sorry, I left before the credits could fly
Walked out of the movie theater and didn’t say bye
I couldn’t believe that I choked like I was some number one fan
Couldn’t even say “good night”, I just grabbed my friends and ran
So much for future plans, us building castles in the sand
‘Cause now it’s all over and I won’t get another chance
Damn, now I’m on my way home
That’s when I got a call on my phone

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
She says, “You might not be the coolest, but I swear you are the cutest
And I really like your music, I heard you on MySpace
D.O.A. really almost brought tears to my face
And I bet you were probably just giving me my space
When you sat so far, I could tell that you were nervous
So better than you try to touch on me like a pervert
But that was kind of rude, how you just walked out
It’s bad enough that you didn’t have nuts to talk about
Well, don’t beat yourself up ‘cause I’m not that mad
But this really was the most awkward date that I had
You lost a few cool points, but I got a few for ya
‘Cause you remembered that my name was Nor and not Nora
You remembered the fish and the dog that I have
Dr. Pepper is my fave and I love slow craft
So with that said, it’s getting late
Call me tomorrow around eight”

[Outro: brandUn DeShay (sample)]
(How you feeling right now?)
I feel like… a million bucks
(Is y’all there?)
Oh, I’m here
I’m ready to go
Lovely
(How you feeling right now?)
(Yeah me too)
