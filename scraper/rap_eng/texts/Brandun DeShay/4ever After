Ace: I hear ya baby, you ain't like all the others, when I’m near ya baby
Feels like something of another world, don't mind them ladies I ain't no Casanova, but if you got time I’ll change your mind, I need to

Prechorus: It don't take years to find, that old fashioned kinda love, I doubt that we're defined by dotted lines,  theres no fear in mind, just the thought of you is all I do and we're divine, my kinda life..

Chorus: Forever in the songs I sing, wherever you may go I'll be, whenever you feel lost I'll lead, in my happily ever after, you are my everything

Kero rap:
Everytime Im scrolling down my Instagram
They'll always be some guy who has the upper hand
But even though I know he got more money
More followers or stories thats more funny
I know I'm your king, you know you’re my queen
In our own world awake in a dream
And all of these jokes only we can laugh at
And all of your looks, got me shook, like an ass slap
#hashtag you so fine..you got my number you can count on me
‘cause out of 10 your a 9, and girl i’m the 1 you need

PRECHORUS

OUTRO:
Hey you, glad i'm your mcm
On your arm like a purse by mcm
Your heart melt like m&m’s
Around my arm you wrapped tighter than a young Eminem
Hah, i'm your mcm
On your arm like a purse by mcm
And I know...you heart melt like m&m's
Round my arm you wrapped tighter than a young Eminem…
