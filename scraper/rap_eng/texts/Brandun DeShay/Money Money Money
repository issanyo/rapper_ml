[ Verse 1 ]

Bitch I'm gone, and I ain't got no mother fucking money
But i got bout 3 playboy-boy bunny and
They quick to fuck a nigga for that-that dubby
Kenny Ken be far from a dummy, plus im all about my cheddar
( nigga you just said that you was broke )
Biiiiiiiiiiiiiitch whatever
Back it up, Uhaul truck, girl you got that ghetto stuff
You know I'm looking, peeping, masturbating while I be creeping
Could of thought ?? made me jizz all up in my jeans, know what I mean?
I'm super clean, super fly, rocking super ?? 'til i die huh, yo
You ain't never met a nigga this immature, I'ma immature whore
Can I get a girl with no flaws, no draws
And some tits that drag to the mother fucking floor
People tell me I don't take my music serious and my shit too explicit
Like you obligated to sit there and listen, nigga the comments and fake ass whispering
Yo, I don't get no pleasure from letters and bitches wearing sweaters
But I would do better with hipster bitches with Cosby sweaters
So get your Cosby on, and get that Hi-C up
And watch us broke niggas sit and count this money up

[ Hook ]

For the love of money
People will steal from their mother

For the love of money
People will rob their own brother

For the love of money
People can't even walk the streets
Because they'll never know who in the world they're gonna beat
For that mean, oh mean, mean green

Almighty Dollar!

Cash Money


[ Verse 2 ]

Lets talk about bricks, Kenny Rebel go the master plan
We work hard, play hard, just so we can advance money
So we can flip it like a back hand
75 in the hood, 25 in the stacks, 5.0. on the ass
So we gotta move fast, with the dirty money
