[Narrator]
In the final decade of the twenty-first century
Men and women in rocket ships landed on the moon
By 2200 AD
They had reached the other planets in our solar system Almost at once there followed discovery of hyper-drive
Through which the speed of light was attained
And later greatly surpassed
So at last
Mankind began the conquest and colonization of deep space

[Robby the Robot]
I am to transport you to the residence
If you do not speak English
I am at your disposal
With one hundred and eighty-seven other languages
Along with their various dialects and sub-tongues

[Commander John J. Adams]
You are a robot, aren't you?

[Robby the Robot]

I was-- Well, sort of bothered

[Altaira “Alta” Morbius]
Well, I didn't really want to see you

Well, it's you!
