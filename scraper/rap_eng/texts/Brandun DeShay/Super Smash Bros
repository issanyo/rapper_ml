[Verse 1 : Raz Fresco]

Green like luigi nigga
Unholy flow wrote it on a ouija nigga
Daughters, Sisters, Nieces fighting just to see these niggas
Rubbing on me but they ain't looking for no g-genie nigga
Fly like keep it E.T
I dont ever B-E-G
Girls on the B-E-D
Play em like a DVD
Catch me in the BBC
Beats give the D-D-P
These niggas here go and go .. ?
Yellowbone lemonade braws on some gucci shit
Get the camera drop it low kick game ludacris
Ever since I blew and shit my ho count numerous
Like Wendy how you doin bitch?
Foolish kicks goofy shit
Girls with fat ass love us super smash brothers
Dont pack gats I pack rubber spree stacks cut ya, You rap supper?
Fat bumper humper must attract clothes that track suffer
Mother fucker...

[Verse 2 : Brandun DeShay]

I tell em Raz you ain't gotta spaz to get em I got em
Peoples champ and these beats give the rock bottom
Slide right on em like the grace thet they fell from
Delivery is sweet see they face when the mail come?
Been doing hail mary's before I could learn huddle
Before I turn subtle I promise to earn double
So every track im on gotta come with a brass knuckle
So I drop it like a (PLOP) on top of a turn buckle
Lets go Raz Fresco and Shay is a tad special
Till we finish the next show and cash go in the escrow
Watch how that money pile be a witness to good business
And how I run the Shaq the be a witness to good fitness
But you get into to this then just wait we got a ton more
Me and Raz handing out bangers like gun stores
And ofcourse more niggas gon love it than gon hate
So haters can eat a dick sincerely Bran DeShay
