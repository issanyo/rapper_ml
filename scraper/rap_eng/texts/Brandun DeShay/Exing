[Verse 1]
Everybody play your part from the start in this game if you role play
Stickin' with your team you can be a king
More cake for the whole squad
The butter soft leathers in the Dodge
Viper with those headlight wipers
I don't need no change
Go pay the tab at the bar and come back with some of that dang Rose
You need a coach I'm Cus D'Amato
And if you ain't got no cup don't touch that bottle
She knowin' that she fly too
And I can't say bye to them thighs no matter how fuckin' hard I try to
She got a new boyfriend but we still sexin'
She don't call me as much but we still texin'
My shawty with the bubble butt
Butterflies bubble up in yo' gut
Fuck the rules lets make some moves
Its true I could try somethin' new
But I'm slidin' with my ex lately
Lets jet baby

[Hook:2X]
Ay baby
I see you just can't quit
I see you got a new nigga
But he just don't fit
So I said

[Verse 2]
Now you lyin' to your friends pretendin' we don't speak
Promised your man we was done we was over
You run to come over to the crib when you leave the club
You still got that wristband on your left hand
Right bricks, bracelets, yes ma'am lets jam
Like the printer when you overload it
And don't I go to work on that ass like I'm tryna get promoted
Ridin' in the Lotus
Friday I notice you the coldest
A Coca-Cola ain't poppin' quite like you are
Lite Brites in the brake lights, new car
I'mma watch it like Zeitgeist
I should've been cut you off but I keep slippin'
My homie had the same story but it seemed different
Its supposed to be me or you this time that slip
Shit maybe not this round
I learned my lesson baby next time around

[Hook]
