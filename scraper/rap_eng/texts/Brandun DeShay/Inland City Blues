[Hook: Price]
(I been makin' moves, tryna find a boo)
Ridin' in the Ub', Inland City Blues
She want Jimmy Choo's
I don't wanna lose
Breakin' all the rules Inland City Blues
Inland City Blues got me out here on a mission
I don't wanna lose my mind
I don't wanna be a victim no
(She want Jimmy Choo's
I don't wanna lose
Breakin' all the rules Inland City Blues)


[Verse 1: Oktane]
Ridin' by myself well, really not really
It's bangin' in the trunk make me feel like Big Willie
I'm silly with it I been really with it
Ride through Philly - NY
Player been fly, and can't fuck up
I text like "What up?"
She texts me "Shut Up!"
I said "Girl, quit playin' - Wassup ?!"
As I just breathe through my evenin'
I tried tell her love is easy, she make it hard
Everytime I'm out she think I'm cheating, let down your guard
God...
...Damn, every time I come in from outta town
It's something going down
I'm in NY, another part of town
Please stand by before I shut you down
Put down your phone, girl, and get off that Instagram
You mad about comments that girl just leaving
And truthfully girl I do not give a damn
I'm trying to make millions with my killers
You and you feelings, I'm feeling like "really fam?"
So I start puffin 'till I feel nothing
Just need a sub for my function and it's jumpin'
I got price on my right I hold the wheel with my left
I say "I'm going to the top you comin'? "Then get in steps
Because people get lost and I don't wanna lose my way
And I don't like loosin' people but girl I lose you today
So you better know that I been making moves

[Verse 2: Price]
Look
Starin' at street lights that I've been looking at since Talidays
Since the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter days
Thinkin' bout chicks that got away
And my niggas that's gone they got shot away (R.I.P.)
On my mind it's a lot today
25, black, with a lot to say
They want me to shut up and just ride away
But no this guy (No!) Oh no not this Price
5'9 but my heart tell me I'm 6'5
I let my nuts hang with my fist high
All the fake shit don't get passes on this side
See that'll get you slump 'round here
That'll get you jump 'round here
We don't fuck we punks 'round here
We don't fuck with Trump 'round here
Nah, it's the Inland City Blues
Most try and many lose
They lettin' crooked ass cops just break the rules
Where young kids gettin' popped don't make the news
But you wonder why they young boys take the .2
And kicks doors the ambition is get more
Daddy in pen so that fucked up his mental
Shells hit the window mommy yellin' out "Get low"
You know how that shit go,  you know how that shit go
Same old cycle, mama told me use my voice
That's the motherfuckin' reason that a real nigga spit for
To remind my youth (to remind my youth)
I gotta remind my youth (I gotta remind my youth)
That with enough creative minds combined
There ain't nothing you can fathom that we can't do
White girl in the front row
She like "Price could you sign my boobs?"
I'm like I would, but I'm too high
And that's off my path I'm tryna find my truth
Let's go
