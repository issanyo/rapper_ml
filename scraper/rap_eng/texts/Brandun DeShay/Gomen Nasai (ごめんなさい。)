[Verse 1]
I was going postal
Dummy like a Slowbro
Cheating, that's a no-no
Thinking I'd finesse her with the words though
Shawty hit me with the stunner like she fucking Stone Cold
Frequent flyer mileage, I had bitches out in Tokyo
She knew bout the hokey-pokey at the karaoke though
Thought shit was sweet just like candy
Now you cannot stand me
I played myself just like the rope-a-dope
You kept it real with me
How these hoes gon tempt me like this?
I can't let you go
Girl, I'm sorry, I know I ain't shit
Fed up with me, the ending was sure to come
Now I'm stuck watching two turning into one
If there was problems, why you didn't mention em?
Trees is your habit, now your ass crashing into one

[Hook]
Gomen nasai, oh
I didn't mean to make you cry, oh
I'm sorry 'bout the lies
Gomen nasai, oh
I didn't mean to make you cry, oh
I'm sorry 'bout the lies (gomen ne!)

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling so sick, no NeYo, need a medic
Why all the good times we hold, oh, we forget it?
I never ever was faithful, I let you tell it
You got me looking for love advising on reddit
And now I'm wishing we could reset it
You don't believe me now
You went from swimming in sheets to wanting to see me drown
I made mistakes once or twice, a hundred times
Even when I don't deserve it won't stop me from wanting mine
But ah...
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cuz I don't wanna be another example of when love gets trampled on and end up on Maury
But everybody is sorry and everyone lies
And nobody miss it until the well runs dry
So Imma let you cheat, we'll call it even, yo
Though I hate the thought, I'd hate it even more to see ya go...
Go!

[Hook]
Gomen nasai, oh
I didn't mean to make you cry, oh
I'm sorry 'bout the lies
Gomen nasai, oh
I didn't mean to make you cry, oh
I'm sorry 'bout the lies (gomen ne!)
