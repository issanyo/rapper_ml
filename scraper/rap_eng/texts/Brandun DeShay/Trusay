[Intro: Nakala]
This could be your favourite song
You and me we can't go wrong
Hit me up when you get home
I'll only give you what you want
Trust me

[Verse 1: Nakala]
Trust me I need you
Trust me I love you
All the time that you
I can't go without

This could be your favourite song
Can you be yea

[Chorus 1: Nakala]
This could be your favourite song
You and me we can't go wrong
Hit me up when you get home
I'll only give you what you want
Trust me
This could be your favourite song
You and me we can't go wrong
Hit me up when you get home
I'll only give you what you want

[Bridge: Nakala]
This could be your favourite song
You and me we can't go wrong
Hit me up when you get home
I'll only give you what you want

[Verse 2: Ace Hashimoto]
Your favourite song, put me on your playlist
I done heard lots of songs, but you are my favourite
I don't wanna come at you, baby, too strong
But if we not together, that'd be dead wrong
Thoughts in my head of your love, i'm too gone
I hear you all the time like my favourite song, yea
I don't wanna play you just like that
Words like "forever" don't seem that bad
Pull up to the crib when you off, allow me to turn you right back on
Oh, i been with the shits, top 10 with hits
Rock band with the licks, stop playing with the kid
Locked in, got a grip
No mystery, this could be love, not a chance i could miss

[Chorus 2: Nakala]
This could be your favourite song
You and me we can't go wrong
Hit me up when you get home
I'll only give you what you want
Trust me
This could be your favourite song
You and me we can't go wrong
Hit me up when you get home
I'll only give you what you want

[Outro: Ace Hashimoto]
