[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
They asked me, “What was the real reason I stopped writing?”
It’s ‘cause I’m getting so much paper, I’m gotta save  trees somewhere

[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
These dudes call themselves heavyweights, flamboyant
And now I’m looking at their future, that’s clairvoyance
BrandUn DeShay on the mic, so enjoy this
‘Cause I’ma be here for a while, that’s endurance
Why dudes looking for deals like coupons
While my rhymes refined like Grey Poupon
And in a word, hate’s all I heard
In school, I lose my cool like nerds
But then I grew up and sort of became a prep boy
All the best toys gave me a head like Pep Boys
Big, but now I’m becoming more conscious
My rhymes went from shallow lines to deep content
Even when I’m sleeping, I’m watching
I dream like a television screen
Oh, this is the scene where I ate whatever Tyler, The Creator create
Then regurgitate on the track and set up a plate
Hey, since success is the sweetest revenge
And my proof gonna be that First Class seat that I’m in
When I’m on my way to LA, recording some tracks
The rap messiah, feeling like Jordan’s back
In fact, I won’t judge, I’ma leave it to you
‘Cause they doubt what you say, but they believe what you do
And I’ll gladly prove to all of you people out there
So don’t move to throw on hold, keep it right here
Don’t confuse it with music, this is therapeutic for you to ‘spute it
‘Cause I’m the Rasputin of rap music
Restoring faith to the once great fans of the genre
Letting my mixtape just dictate my montage
No telling when I’ll blow, a bomb, no time limit
But in this time I’m given, I’ma rhyme while I’m living
And stop and look, then listen before the roads to riches
As long as it’s what I envisioned, I know my decision
Turn this rap game to a kitchen, the leakers get outed
‘Cause it’s too hot for them now, it’s getting less crowded
With turntables for a stove, frying pan for a pen
Yeast move like my prosperity, the booth is a den
FruityLoops for knives to cut the sample up
With Pro Tools for a sink to clean the sample up
Egg timers for metronomes and pads for a countertop
Cooking up classics, get it off the counter while it’s hot

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Uh, brandUn DeShay, Ace the Creator
From now until forever
