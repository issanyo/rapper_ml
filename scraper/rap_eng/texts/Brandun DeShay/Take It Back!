[Intro]
Let's take it back, take it back, (Take it back!)
I wanna take it back, take it back, (Take it back!)
Ch-ch take it back, take it back, (Take it back!)
I wanna take it back, take it back, (Uh!)

[Verse 1]
Uh, back to the days, we had something to look forward to
But now, patience is short, shorter than 4'2"
Midget-sized, how did her problems get digitized?
You mad over some shit I posted on Twitter, why?
Is it my tweets that got you go heated
Because you told me "I love you" and I retweeted
Should I have said it back?
Can we hop in the time machine? Can we set it back?
Oh wait, are you mad cause I wouldn't follow back?
But I'm the man, I can't follow if I wear the pants
In this relationship, "In a relationship"?
Why you want that on Facebook, 'cause people sayin' shit?
These Facebook walls is treated like Berlin
And break 'em down, this ain't the end of the world if
We ain't official when it comes to the online
Cause when it comes to our minds, you are on mine
Fuck all that cyber shit, girl, you the one I'm vibin' wit'
My ride-or-die chick and the one that I'm ridin' wit'
On the offline, you're always my baby
Man, relationships were so much easier in the eighties

[Outro]
I swear, I wanna (Take it back!), take it back, take it back
Ch-ch (Take it back!), take it back, take it back
I wanna (Take it back!), take it back, take it back
Ch-ch (Take it back!), ch-ch, uh
