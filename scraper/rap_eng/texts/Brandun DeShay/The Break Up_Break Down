I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour

[Verse 1]
To let you know, you had a good guy
The most favorite hello, the most hardest good-bye
The most honest would lie, say that "everything is cool"
When everybody sees the problem, everyone except for you
Or maybe is it you did? Hopin' things'll blow away
Pretend it doesn't exist, then everything'll go away
Watchin' a relationship float away
I thought it was a keeper, but it was just a throw away
I thought that I should keep her, the signs tell me to "Stop it!"
She was my hottest topic, but she just made me an option
I guess I should of listened when they was telling me, "Watch it!"
Knew love was never easy, when Stevie said its a rocket
I get my pen and I jot it, all the wrongs about you
Saw us slipping like house shoes, knew what we could amount to
But didn't, shit
Did this, to let you know you had a good guy
Knew it was finished, to let you know, it was good try

[Hook]
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour

[Verse 2]
Wish that you knew that you was the world to me
Woe is me, gave up the games, you had control of me
At first you were holding me
I blink, then there's a hole in me!
The better halfs the whole of me, now tell me what is holding me?
Its gone, and its my fault supposedly
I ain't perfect but you ain't who you supposed to be
Guess I made the fatal mistake of lettin' you close to me
Another past mistake I'm endurin' thats from the older me
I'm hurtin 'noticably, be lyin' if I weren't surprised
Thought you knew not to talk wit your mouth full, of lies
You said the last thing that you wanted to do was hurt me
Well damn, at least it wasn't the first thing
Be still my beatin' heart, not time to open just yet
Lessons once learned, so hard to forget
Was numb to it all before, but so far this regret
Has been prevelant, you dont gotta say it, it's evident

[Hook]
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour

[Verse 3]
Goodbye to all those late nights, goodbye to all the sexing
Goodbye to all your fake shite, goodbye to your impressions
Say goodbye to your dishonesty, goodbye to yo' deception
Goodbye to answerin' questions, goodbye to all your guesses
Say goodbye to that person you never thought would doubt you
Goodbye songs for you, hello songs about you
Say goodbye to everything you represent is what I oughta do
Goodbye to that face of yours, goodbye to the thought of you!
Goodbye to everything we had and everything it seemed
Goodbye to the word "love" and everything it means
Goodbye to your truths even though you seemed to stretch them
Goodbye to those lips of yours and every word that left them

[Hook]
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour
I don't love you
