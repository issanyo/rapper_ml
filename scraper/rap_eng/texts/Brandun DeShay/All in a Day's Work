[Verse 1]
Pardon my melody but I've been sober too long
Pass me promethazine, I need someone to lean on
Swear not to trust again, that's just my innocence
I fall in love too much, that's just my innocence

[Hook]
I've been searching for words that concur with the fact I'm salty
But the worst is behind, I'll be fine soon as I fall free
Long go the day's work
Crash in the wave
Too high that you can't surf
Trapped in the same curse
Run til your legs burst
Fall on your face first
All in a day's work
Fall free
Long go the day's work
Crash in the wave
Too high that you can't surf
Trapped in the same curse
Run til your legs burst
Fall on your face first
All in a day's work

[Verse 2]
Pardon my neglegence, but I just don't give a fuck
Stuck in my head again, closed minded won't open up
This is my enemy, but I need it to breathe
Want someone every night, that's just the Hennessy
Girls wanna have my baby, can't have my legacy
Flirting with Penelopes, cruising in their Toms
'nother DM from my ex, ask her what she really want
Never sleeping what is rest
But a friend that's long gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Hook]
I've been searching for words that concur with the fact I'm salty
But the worst is behind, I'll be fine soon as I fall free
Long go the day's work
Crash in the wave
Too high that you can't surf
Trapped in the same curse
Run til your legs burst
Fall on your face first
All in a day's work
Fall free
Long go the day's work
Crash in the wave
Too high can't surf
Trapped in the same curse
Run til your legs burst
Fall on your face first
All in a day's work

[Outro]
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
