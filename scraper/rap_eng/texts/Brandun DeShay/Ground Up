Gimme that lighter, fam
Joint canoeing like summer camp
There's money at my front door, should I invite him in?
Yeah? Just let him chill, get him a glass of water?
Tell him I'm his biggest fan, number one supporter?

Verse 1:
Police orders to sweep the street corners, if you speak to chief, tell him the money we keep on us
It's all ours you don't get a cut, fuck you
Weren't supposed to make it this far but we snuck through
(flexin' on who?)
Nigga I can wreck ya whole crew especially when yo main nigga says it's just you
That presidential day date bezel like ooh
That yellow gold middle and I'm through
I do it so good that stoop kid will leave his stoop no essence of youth
Never been a goof, where the loot at though
You lookin' at me stupid, what you do that for?

Chorus:
We built it from the ground up, swingin' for the stands then we hit the mound up
Lookin' for the man, baby well you found us
Flyin' on my way home soon, flight first class like homeroom
(x2)

Now I used to feel the pressure, but now I'm just impressive
King size bed, couple thousand on the dresser
I'mma eat these weaklings with thousand island dressing
And I keep ignoring calls from the girls that you be pressing
Infatuation with money, a borderline obsession with the shh
I'm a jugernaut, Bubble Moncler, who the Dougiest?
A double knot, tied around my money who you fuckin' wit?
I love my whole family, tattoo of the grammy
When I first started flowin' thought they wouldn't understand me
I didn't wanna catch the criticism from the band geeks
Talkin' bout I'm off key, keep a big stick and tread softly
That's something that my old G taught me
Avirex leather that my grandma bought
Niggas tried to get it but they couldn't get it off me
So get off me
Tell ya girl to get off these

Chorus:
We built it from the ground up, swingin' for the stands when we hit the mound up
Lookin' for the man, baby well you found us
Flyin' on my way home soon, flight first class like homeroom
(x2)
