[Verse 1]
Dear God, if your listening, I know you are
You're so far, I feel like I gotta yell up to the stars
All of my silent friends, don't seem like they getting answers
Frustration grows, it's like it's cancer of the soul
You told me to give all my problems to you
I can't carpool, but I got no problem following you
Just give me a sign, let me know I ain't miss my exit
I pray that you help me not to miss my exes
I pray that you help me not to fuck up the next shit
She stayed and I thank you for that shit
Cause God knows, you know that I'd be lost without her
It's bad enough the music ain't turn out to be what it was
In my eyes, just two years ago, it seemed so sacred
The deeper I get into this, the people get faker
I hate it, I thank you for my fans for real
Cause well, if not for them I prolly would've killed myself
So many nights I spent crying in my lonesome
Here with the same people years ago that killed your own son
I'm living with them but i'm living for you
Making the most out of this mission I've been given to do
Enlightening the world with my music, and I think that i'm doing it
Messages for my listeners, telling me to stay true to this
Telling me I saved their life, but in retrospect, they be saving mine
Waiting for my chance, imma stay in line
This frustration won't outweigh my patience
I got her and music, so I ain't mind waiting
For short, thank you for the sun and the rain
I learned joy, I learned pain, but you always remain
Even when I questioned your loyalty, you would bring more to me
Becoming a man, but keeping in touch with the boy in me
I know the future gon be brighter than this
It's about time I get this light bulb switched

[Outro]
Know the future gon be brighter than this
So get this light bulb switched
Sincerely Yours
