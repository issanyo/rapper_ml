[Verse 1: Ace Hashimoto]
Never say this now
Best if I stay
Let's get this out the way
That's the problem that built right now
Livin' life [inaudible]

[Chorus: Ace Hashimoto]
We can work it out
Don't rush what you wanna talk about
One thing can ruin what took a while
I'll admit i messed up
It's messed up
Nobody perfect but guess what
I'm here right now
I hear you now
I hate a lot its like [inaudible]
Can't let this magic disappear right now
[inaudible]

[Verse 2: Ace Hashimoto]
Like Barry Bonds bae you know it
This love ain't' no [inaudible] so baby don't blow it
I'm trippin'
What you got is different
Told me it's impossible
Then show you my persistence
[inaudible]
What you givin' me got me greedy
A life without you has no meaning
[inaudible]

[Verse 3: Ace Hasimoto]
But baby come on
Don't throw the bitches out
(Don't throw the snitches out)
Don't wake up let's break it down
(Don't let em break us down)
Been in this too long
Just gon' have to wait this out
And no use in restin' now
And don't go and take a bow
Been in this too long
Just gon' have to wait this out

[Verse 4: Ebhoni]
You want it now
(You want it now)
Oh you feel like you losing now
(You losing now)
So you twisted, manipulated, to get what you want right now
Your words do they hide your meaning?
Describe how you feel, to convey a message
Are you for real?
Your attempt to express, go on express
Your words, do they hide your meaning?
Cause' what I see, is not what I'm hearing
I wanna see it
I need to see it
To believe it
To believe it

[Coda: Ebhoni]
You've seen it, you want it
Talk your way into it, talk your way out of it
You want me to wait
Saying this time you'll change
Different? Are you for real?
Let's break it down
So we can work it out
So we can work it out
