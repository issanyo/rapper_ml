[Verse 1]
(I've fallen!) In love, and I don't think I wanna get up
Cruisin' through life on a banana peel, don't wanna slip up
I seen it and that shit sucks! I'd rather a sippy cup
Over a bottle, she holds the throttle and drives me so nuts
I mean so crazy, I'm thinkin' this may be love at first sight
She picked me up in her ma's truck, let me fuck the first night
I don't think that was too poor; other girls, I get too bored of
Quickly, we clicked like we were (?), oh lord
I'm all about the lick like two broads who just come up
Got no problem wiping all the cum up
She's definitely my number one summer love
A lot of niggas might put one a-bove
But not me, she's perfect as it gets
The way she work her hips when I'm hittin', yo, that's the shit
I be thinking about when I do a song for the ladies
I picture the way her that back bends like Mercedes
No, baby, I'm all good to go
I'll probably text her when I finish this song and let her know
Like, "You know I made a song for you
You ain't at home, is you?
Oh yeah? I'll text your phone when I'm on my way, peace."

[Verse 2]
Our conversation requires no concentration
No consentations of problems, eyes full of constellations
For this moment we waited, and so far, it's what I expected
You got the body and good golly, you hotter than Texas
So refreshin' the next step is, to see what you own
I got the lesson, the next test, we takin' it home
You know I'm far from a poet, I'm a star and she know it
So I told her to treat my dick like my cover and blow it
The head game exchanged to the bed frame
Take a look at us, right on the table, no free cable but we hookin' up
Remember when I wasn't so fresh? She gave no shits
And now I got her goin' like road trips
The whole flip of my traffic of all the baddest chicks
From average, since and the fact I'm packin', my swag's patented
Ravishin', yet rational, whatever you call it
I bet we all will say it's love but I can see that we fallin'
It's all good
