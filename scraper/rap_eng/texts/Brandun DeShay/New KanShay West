[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
Had to bring a friend along with me on this one
Merciless, everybody
And of course, I'm DeShay
Gonna kick it off first

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I'm so down like I'm supposed to be, down like I'm down on my knees
Hold the rosary, [?] stay close to me
Know I got a long road ahead of me
Go ahead, do your worst, it's only gonna better me
Got a girl head between my legs like a pedigree
It's easy just to let her leave, all I need is 88 keys just to breathe
But that is not an option
So while these rappers have their notepads and they're jotting
I'm bringing steady jogging, remembering the worst days
Lonely-ass birthdays, everybody want to see tomorrow like it's Thursday
I heard they was looking for a savior
I'm Jesus with a little bit of gold and a pager
We know that we major whole different stage, this is stadium status
Still can't believe they laughed at us
And now they laugh with us
And they ass-backwards
You know I'm that nigga
Nigga

[Verse 2: Merciless]
I'm the last hope, so I guess I am well
The Obama of this shit, I hope I prevail
But only time can tell
My destiny's in the stars like Orion's Belt
But these ain't even my songs, though, I just help
When I lay my pen down, it write itself
And every time I record, the mic just melts
This is the realest thing that I've ever felt
Yo, the music is inside me
Said come with me, just stay by me
So she played Whitney and I played Bobby
We painted the city red like a brand new Ferrari
So I got her to thank for all of this
A closet full of kicks and a fucking Maserati, bitch
This is absolute bliss
But sometimes, I'd like to sit down and reminisce
But remember when I was young, hit the wishing wells?
Wishing well, I hope that I get rich and well
Now I got more bars than a prison cell
And I get to see the world like killer whales
This is awesome
And running L.A. is so exhausting
You don't get it, then forget it, my lines is exquisite
No ribbon on my box here, boy I'm just gifted
Flow like O.J. Simpson, B-side kill it
Get on the track and just rip it
Like your cheap rubber, some tired-ass jeans
I'm the sickest nigga ever, there's no vaccine
I spit flames, my saliva is gasoline
So fucking hot that I carry a canteen
Yo, so would I care about a pro-hater?
Stay on my grind like Tony Hawk, pro skater
We're so out of this world like a space laser
We're senior students, we fucking major
Yeah, we fucking major
