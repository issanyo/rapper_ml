[Hook]
It's golden, it's golden
It's golden, it's golden
It's goooldennn, nahh-ahh
It's golden, it's golden

[Verse]
Playin' games at the park
Countin' stars after dark
Throwin' sand at the beach
Too much far from the streets
I'm gettin' high as a kite (Nahh, na-na-na)
Stayin' up all night (Nahh, na-na-na)
Spendin' time, havin' fun
You know what it is, just begun
It's golden

[Hook]
It's golden, it's golden
It's golden, it's golden
It's goooldennn, nahh-ahh
It's golden, it's golden

[Outro]
Nahh, na-na-na
Nahh, na-na-na
