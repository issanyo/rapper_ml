[Intro: Sample]
Again and again and again and again
Do it again, do it again

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Used to be the one in trouble
Now I'm in trouble when the beat is played
I've got to bring my family to the Grammy's
So there's no goodbyes when I greet the fame
When I'm bored, I play board games
If life's a game, that's surprising when you beat the game
Some people try to tell me: "Grow up"
But I sit and play while they beat the stage
I know it's my bed, I must lie in it
But I can't sleep when the sheets are stained
They say the streets are paved for gold
But those lost their way that the streets are paved
I'm stuck at a crossroad
But who dare would cross roads when the streets are rage
My soul wants to fly free
But it's locked behind the, keyless ribcage

[Chorus: Sample]
Again and again and again and again
Do it again, do it again
Again and again and again and again
Do it again, do it again
Again and again

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Long drives calls for dashboard confessions
Learn that you're a student, teacher's life lessons
Your mental health, kid, that's what's in question
Keep acting obscure, and you'll keep them guessing
Sometimes, I feel like sin is a blessing
They need the naked truth, so I'll keep them dressing
I wonder if she'll ever get the message
You can make mistakes, without making messes
Bad relationships end in exes
Oh, I guess there's no more hugs and kisses
I bet a lot of people didn't get it
Sometimes, less focus can help you see the image
Whoever said the sky is the limit
Must have never seen the stars, how could you forget them?
Seashells play the shore if you listen
But with my senses, I can see what I'm listening

[Chorus: Sample]

[Outro: brandun DeShay (sample)]
They say home is where the heart is
But for all of those who are heartless, when do they address it?
(Again and again)
