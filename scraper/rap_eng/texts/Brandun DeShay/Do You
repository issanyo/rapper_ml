[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Down on my knees, I pray to God
It must be easy ‘cause life is hard
I know this can’t, can’t be my life
My dreams, they won’t let me sleep at night

[Hook: brandUn DeShay (sample)]
Do what you want to do (Do now as I say, darling)
Be who you want to be (Not as I do)
Say what you want to say (See the way I play, kid)
See what you want to see (Now do as I do)
Dream what you want to dream (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
Fly where you want to fly (Not as I do)
Live when you want to live (Or you'll feel blue)
Die when you want to die

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay (sample)]
He reads, she reads, he writes, she writes
He raps, she don’t, now which one is right?
You get one life, my advice: do you
Find out if your dream can come true
(It's not possible to teach a kid
By preaching
When you do the opposite)

[Hook (2x)]
