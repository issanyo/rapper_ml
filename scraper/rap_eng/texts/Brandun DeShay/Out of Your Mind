[Hook]

Killing me softly
And I'm still falling
Still the one I need
I will always be with you
You got me hung on
Don't ever let me go
Say you realised your [?]
If you leave me out of your mind

[Verse 1 :Phil Ade]

When my Buck's up my hoe's down
Don't fuck up my mode now
We drunk up the whole crown
And fucked up the whole town
Got head in that new coupe
She wear it, no suit, whoop
No slide [?]
I'm crucial, that nice
Fuck you, and advice
Envy they got Phil, [?]
Hoes round me act right
Hoes round you act nice
We on that trap life
You smoke shit, no black ice
I'm gone, I'm faded
I'm out in Hollywood feeling like I made it
Right here, with us a ditty hoe
I'm acting interested, I'm tryna' see them titties though
You niggas know me, I'll drink til OD, I'm OC
I'm getting old, see me in a four seater both feet up
I'm an OG, I get that pussycat like Josie
Got a pocket full of cash now posie

[Hook]

Killing me softly
And I'm still falling
Still the one I need
I will always be with you
You got me hung on
Don't ever let me go
Say you realised your [?]
If you leave me out of your mind

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]

Cruising through this side like The Odyssey
Never want for modesty so if you here I'm coming to your town
T here's some shit that you gotta see
Balling's a policy
Knew if 'Pac could see me he'd be looking mighty proud of me
I got this, I fucking got this, I'm on the top this
Look at me, I'll fucking book a team with the dropkick
Bossin', you see me Saucin', you have to face it
Licking that X and what we cook up in the basement
Just saying, I must be crazy, not just batshit
Fuck her then she disappear like I'm doing magic
[?]
Talking about another day, bitch you never seen me
I'm sad, [?] mattress
Another me? No other matches
I'm a legend with the sight, I'm alright
I know they wanna see me fail, but not tonight
You must be out of your...

[Hook]

Killing me softly
And I'm still falling
Still the one I need
I will always be with you
You got me hung on
Don't ever let me go
Say you realised your [?]
If you leave me out of your mind
