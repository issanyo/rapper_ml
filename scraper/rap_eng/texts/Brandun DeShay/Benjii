[Verse:1 Gita]
Seated in dem sport car seats
Swisha sweet. I break and roll the weed
Up coasting towards a lux-ur-y shopping
Spree-uh, gotta trick or treat her, ME!
Skilled to cut dem pockets deep accounts
On R.I.P cha cha cha cha ching
Is the closet set? Cars on deck? Paris
First! London Next! I can show you how to
Flex with those Benjii's that you get, keep a
G sexy, fly, and fit get rid of that clingy hoe
You fuck'n wit! Can't ask fo'much won't settle for less
Hood rich, Cavali dress, bitch stay crisp
Cameras click, click wana come
Sip this hit it kiss it lick it keep the pussy thumping
Fellas want us Cinderella's. How we doing it
Pussy and the cooking and a nice
Lil tooshi wet'n wild crazy coochi
No dinners late night movies
Whatcha ya'll doing whatcha ya'll
Niggas thinking? If I had a bitch I'd show you
How to do it. Now do it, keep it pushing
Where the money moving?

Chorus 2X

Benji franklin gotta love dem dollas

All night, riding real nice, real nice

[Verse: Gita]
Better be somebody keeping me
Goody, goody
I'm hella naughty, naughty
Real chop shop
Hard body, cut up, wired up
Engine started strip joints
And fliest parties swigging off that
Black Bacardi. Sunrise's early morning's
Penthouse's fifty stories gat on chill
For dem killas on the field, scrilla in no boxes
Safe, cams, dogs just too watch it winter
Santiaga mobbing till dem federellis
Come and stop us!..... Big bucks
Big truck, my niggas gotta have toys to bust
What's love when you can just love lust
Golden cuffs dese oceans run deep as
Thousand dollar tinted celines that dro
Putting that ass too sleep, eat, sniff
Lick this one hundred per-cent cream
That off the market nani, squirting as
A tommy, smoother than a Maserati
Got that Al Green and you wonder why
They call me murder mami..


Chorus 4X

Benji franklin gotta love dem dollas
That you making
Whips on the coast seaside, west side
Real bad slick ass hoe
Bitch get by in a niggas G ride
All night, riding real nice, real nice
Riding real nice, real nice


Outro Hook 4X
Ooo baby
