[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Dang, you stone cold, Steve Austin to you
If all bets are off, I’m going all over you
I proved often I’m honest, I ain’t lying, it’s true
If I stand up for nothing, it’s ‘cause I’m falling for you
And I’m falling, falling and I can’t get up
Almost a year and I can’t get a “Hey, what’s up?”
But dang, that’s tough luck, no four leaf clovers
But we was meant to be way before these strollers

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
It’s destiny
Me and you, so fresh to me
Not to mention, especially
How you brought the best of me, the best in me

[Verse 2]
Baby, you way cool, cool as the waves and ish
Remember when we set sail in our relationship
Just me and you, a two-man crew set sail
Sprung a leak, but before we could sink, you just bailed
There’s only so much feeling a rhyme can instill
But you left me with some wounds even time couldn’t heal
You left me with some shoes that no one will ever fill in
No one who make me feel this way
Ever again

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
It’s destiny
Me and you, so fresh to me
Not to mention, especially
How you brought the best of me, the best in me

[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
There’s no way I’m gonna wollow in my sorrow
I still got dreams that I’ll be following tomorrow
You’re listening to this while I’m riding on my harrow
Zip-o, thinking about how much you suck, no nympho
Suck, no nympho, but this goes out to you
Who get high with no altitude
I’ll be busy doing what I’ll be set out to do
But what you’re out to do is be cool
You know that it’s destiny

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
It’s destiny
Me and you, so fresh to me
Not to mention, especially
How you brought the best of me, the best in me

[Verse 4: brandUn DeShay]
Honestly, who can deny greatness?
I ain’t taking sides, but you and I can’t shake this
This some good food for thought, we’re just gonna waste this
‘Cause that’d be insane, you’re an angel amongst men
If they hate you, then I'm a Satanist
You make my heart race, I wasn’t trained to be racist
Dang, what am I saying? I hate this
If I can find a pencil that big enough to erase this
I would, then rewrite it, ‘cause I can’t keep saying this
Baby, it’s destiny

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
It’s destiny
Me and you, so fresh to me
Not to mention, especially
How you brought the best of me, the best in me
