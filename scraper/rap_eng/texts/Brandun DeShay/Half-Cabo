[Intro]

(Aww)

Another night is full of sorrows
But there's another day tomorrow
Another night is full of sorrow
But there's another day tomorrow
Im'a show you how to get it right
Im'a show you how to get it right
If you trynna see the brighter side (Oh yup)
Just let it go and you can fly

[Verse]

24/7 365
I've been moving pushing numbers hope to see it before I die
I wish a muthafucka would try to tell me how to make a living
Just to make it to the top and show em how to make a killing
I know when you hating dawg but really u just hate yo self
I'm just trynna see it through another book upon the shelf
I appreciate the fact that all I perceive is progress
Cause if I was stuck in my ways - only leaving room for stress
I can't tell you what you need ain't trynna be no politician
People killing other people family fathers women children
And my brother Bhris got shipped he's fuckin with the military
God knows we some savages with the business and a secretary Smoking leaves and eatin meat sucking titties for the dairy
Man it all could be so bad if you ain't know how to moderate it Balance right till you get it right it and that talent buys
And you can come back home and you ain't even gotta lie

[Bridge]

Cause all that gold ain't glitter and all that good ain't wit us
Bet they want a brighter side with Jesus as my witness
Cause all that gold ain't glitter and all that good ain't wit us
Bet they want a brighter side with Jesus as my witness

I'ma show you how to get it right
Bounce right get it right (Fuck em though x2)
If you trynna see the brighter side (Oh yup)
You gotta let it go so you can fly away

[Outro]

But you know we need that (We need that x2)
And you know we need that (We need that x2)
But you know we need that (We need that x2)
And you know we need that (We need that x2)

But you know we need that rain to grow
And you know we need that pain to flow
But you know we need that rain to grow
And you know we need that pain to flow
