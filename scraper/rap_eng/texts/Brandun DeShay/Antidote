[Intro]
This nigga Korey said dropping jewels like the chain broke, nahmsayin'.That's all I really wanna do

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
I had a lot of role models, old niggas, doctors, dope dealers
It's funny cause it was the same thing to me
Cause money was the main thing we was trained to reach
Same thing they get paid a month, mothafucka I get paid a week
And I done had all kind of hoes, different girls from A to Z
My car is switching every day of the week, Yours can't get you from A to B
Without breaking down, locking up, I don't know no hoes that I can trust
That Polo on or Nautica, selling the phones was not enough
Roll the dice until we out of luck
Because coming from the bottom to the top is rough
The government be giving not a fuck
And neither should you, you got a crew and your crew is tough
Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each other's crutch
You lean on me, I lean on you, nigga I hold you up
Toothpick Clique or bust your head with a brick
Girl, I see you on top of me, just ride it like a jockey
She soaking wet, musta not known who you was stroking with
The coldest sex from the twenty-something, sort of older vets

[Hook: Brandun & Michael]
A wise old soul once told me "son come ask me what you wanna know"
These words won't last, this lifestyle's bad, this piece of mind the antidote
Gotta get that paper doe, gotta get that paper doe
Gotta get that paper doe, gotta get that paper
The world won't end, it's still gon' spin, some niggas will but we won't
Cause see I care, I wanna share, with you my mind the antidote
Gotta get that paper doe, gotta get that paper doe
Gotta get that paper doe, gotta get that paper

[Verse 2: Michael]
We be the lords, god, get a picture of him baby
In that Porsche Boxster, driving like he crazy
We be the lords, got hoes wanna have his baby
So of course I'm, smashing on the daily
And I got bands on top of bands, popping molly with my white friends
Sip a Tropicana, OJ and I'm okay
Now that AC feeling crazy coming up out of them vents
Dark shades, they be adding that tint, whole time we was tryna invent
While they bit, you can't prevent what's 'posed to happen, it's meant
Don't let me find out you sold your soul for the smallest percent
You sold your soul just for some gold and got a heart of cement
Oh yes, and we be kicking them hoes out that y'all kept
I'm keeping records of them plain broads y'all press
I guess this success is dependent on
Less of the stress, getting more of the women though
I'm gon' show you niggas how to progress and get along

[Hook]
