[Verse 1]
I'm pouring deuces in a cup
Just got my CCW
Im rolling up a blunt
Let me see what this bud will do
Im copping all this Neiman man
The shit you never seen it
Trying to copy off my team
Take a picture if you need it
Thats right
I bang bang bang
Skeet skeet skeet
My dick too tall
I dive too deep
Submarine
Fuck you mean
Never running out of steam
We only do designer drugs
These hoes show me all kind of love
All kind of hugs
We'd be selling dope if we could find a plug
Better believe it
And my bitch look like Aaliyah
Say goodbye to broke hello rich
Damn its good to see ya
We the clique
We the leaders
And I make her come quicker as delivery from Little Caesars
Better shake it when you see us, bitch
I can't believe that I tried to leave
When you came and you grabbed my hand
More fish in the sea
More sand on the beach
Same place where you got that tan
I got that Remy
Got them xans
Got them bars
Like I gotta a liquor license
Gotta be smart when you pick your vices

[Hook: Tennille]
When you kick it with livest guys
Says she sweeter than a haagen-dazs
So if you going you can take a ride
When you shake it baby take you time

[Verse 2]
She be looking for that almighty dollar
That Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada
And she got a lotta
Ass like cash in the atm
Crazy slim wasted but hella fat in all the right places
She used to rocking sneakers but now she on them heels
I say she graduated her diploma laminated
She say she believe in God she just dont go to church
She just believe in hearts
Because thats all youre worth
She never had a three way but shed be down to try it
She gotta a friend thats named Mariah that she says that shes been eyein
And big ups to my nigga Brian he supplyin all the downers
We be buyin over the counter
Pharmacist be lying
Believe him if you wanna
Corey got popped in Arizona
With a trunk of the smoke
Lets roll a blunt
And just hope
He'll be free by the time the album hit the racks
I need my nigga back
Open the door and hit the latch
