[Chorus]
I know the world is so cold
The world is so cold, but you can never shiver
You can never let them see you down
I know the world is so cold
The world is so cold, but you can never shiver
You can never let them see you down

[Verse 1]
There's no way you can go without a goal taking action
Whether it's your passion, not letting life pass you
By, but no matter what, there's always somebody laughing at your dream of owning Porsches
Tell them to hold their horses
Stop them in their tracks like a space bar, pause button
Pause, cousin, but whose dick is y'all sucking?
Y'all bugging on that insect ish
Because y'all don't never uff with a brother, that incest ish
It's obvious that this is my life, I'm invested everything that I owe
From the skin to the bow
This is all that I breathe
It's like the power of will, it's all in my will so you can take it all when I leave
I'll take a bow when I leave if this earth is a stage
Then my life is Broadway with Janelle Mon√°e
I'm feeling A-OK and you should be too when you're dealing with the lames
Try to keep it in your brain
And...

[Chorus]
I know the world is so cold
The world is so cold, but you can never shiver
You can never let them see you down
(They want to keep us, they want to keep us, they want to keep us down)
I know the world is so cold
The world is so cold, but you can never shiver
You can never let them see you down
(Down, down, down)

[Verse 2]
Down where they need me to be
But now I am done with rest like I ain't needing to sleep
My eyes are wide open, mind wired and focused
Future is about as clear as the lens in my bifocals
But I don't focus on the past or the present
When my ass hit eleven, I was past all the presents
Ain't like I ever meant it, we're growing up, just being a little bit different
It was a real big difference
And that's the type of shit that set me apart like a distance
I knew I was special like Olympics
But I ain't playing discus, my life is for real
Ambitions is getting skinny, looking like it's for real
But when I'm losing the weight, that means I'm tired of waiting
That means I fired the patience and then I hired to take it
As about as high as I'll take it, I don't need no weed
And I don't need no weed when I got me, me, me
You see...

[Chorus]
I know the world is so cold
The world is so cold, but you can never shiver
You can never let them see you down
(They want to keep us, they want to keep us, they want to keep us down)
I know the world is so cold
The world is so cold, but you can never shiver
You can never let them see you down
(Down, down, down)

[Verse 3]
I know a lot of people asking, "what it takes to be a legend like Neveral?"
You're going to have a couple of haters, trust me, I know, I have several
As long as you keep getting better
They will never ever, ever, ever, ever get on your level
So just let them talk as much as they want
Because all that talking they doing can never to the stuff that they want
So while they laying in bed, and they dreaming at night
You up, perfecting your craft, achieving at night
Trust me, I'm right
I know!

[Chorus]
I know the world is so cold
The world is so cold, but you can never shiver
You can never let them see you down
(They want to keep us, they want to keep us, they want to keep us down)
I know the world is so cold
The world is so cold, but you can never shiver
You can never let them see you down
(Down, down, down)
