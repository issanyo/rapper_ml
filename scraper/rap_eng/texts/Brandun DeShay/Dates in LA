[Intro]
Let me be your fire
Let me be your fire
You're my own desire
You are my desire
If you kiss me I won't tell
(If you kiss me baby, I won't tell)
Just meet me by the swings
In the park, after dark

[Chorus]
Girl all these dinner dates in LA got me thinking 'bout you
I never thought I'd be so sprung like
Texting you I'm on the way like everyday
And I'm down for you
But understand I got some things to do
I wanna make my heart a place for two
Oh can we do that?
Do that? Do that?
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Ain't this that feeling right here
That almost love feeling right here
Since you've been giving me these signs
I couldn't help but stick with you
You know that I've been down before the ride
What we got is historic might take some time
So just believe in us, 'cause we ain't fooling round
In love we trust

[Chorus]
Girl all these dinner dates in LA got me thinking 'bout you
I never thought I'd be so sprung like
Texting you I'm on the way like everyday
And I'm down for you
But understand I got some things to do
I wanna make my heart a place for two
Oh can we do that?
Do that? Do that?
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't like a thing 'bout my house, or my job
But when I get to stressing, I'll forget it with you
Yeah, yeah westay cooking
Mc' luvin me that's the motion
I hope you know who I'm thankful for

You gave me this new perspective
And drove it through my heart
Baby, now I see there's more than me
And you've been helping from the start

[Bridge]
I hope I don't make it sound like I'm selfish
I wanna give you a home in my heart that's certain
It's been a while now since I found a real one
I'm planning for a future, yeah if you 'bout one
I hope I don't make it sound like I'm selfish
I wanna give you a home in my heart I'm more than certain
It's been a while now since I found a real one
I'm planning for a future, yeah if you 'bout one

[Outro]
Let me be your fire
Let me be your fire
(Ba-ba-ba-ba na na)
You're my one desire
(Yeah yeah yeah)
You are my desire

And I'm down for you
But understand I've got some things to do
I wanna make my heart a place for two
Oh can we do that?
Do that? Do that?
Yeah yeah yeah
