[Verse 1]
Too many fine women in the world not to have one
Too much money in the world not to have none
So whats your excuse? I been hustlin for the past month
Beats, rap features, anything I can get cash from
Fundin a dream for sure ain't cheap
But no motion or slow motion damn sure ain't me
When that train stops this time, I'mma catch it
Picture it a Pokemon and I'm like Ash Ketchum
Funny but now I betcha that thinkin make me a legend
I'm steady Chi reppin, but never half steppin
I used to get in trouble in class for being so vocal
But now I'm more than local, fans comin by the boatload
A couple niggas hated I rapped they called me a lame and
Mad cuz I wasn't bangin, instead its dick im slangin
And now they chick I'm slayin, you laughin but I ain't playin
Now isnt that ironic, workin to be iconic, I'm on it

[Hook]
See a hunderd girls, get a thousand hugs, cuz I'm what?
World, world, world, world famous
They ain't gettin in unless they wit us, cuz I'm what?
World, world, world, world famous
I dont know who they are, but they know I'm a star
World, world, world, world famous
Don't remember names but I do remember faces
I'm world, world, world, world famous

[Verse 2]
See all my nigs, got me, all these he's watch me
On my stick, hockey, thats Asap, Rocky
See these nigs, not me, but these kids, copy
But I dont get mad, glad they finally found a real nig
Spittin real shit, gettin chicks and its ill shit
Still tense, wit rap
Even wit a big name shit still wack
Q-tip love, I get that, OF beef, I live that
Ridin Roun' Town, I did that, Racing stripes, did that
Locals Only, did that, beats so cold I can quit rap
But, I know that they need me, my fans they believe
Know im gon make it to the top like George did wit Weazy
Flow tight, so tight, like the jeggings on Weezy
My nigga, you can do it too, I tell em its easy
All you need is love, and a little dedication you will see that come
That lifestyle niggas livin, was not had given
Focus on your mission, which is money over bitches
And we winnin

[Hook]
