[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
The Super D3Shay

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I’m looking like success, so I guess I’ll go up and knock
I rap with no practice, the warmups is hot
Now my team’s going up, we so up it’s top
Matter of fact, we so fly, we show up in flocks
We roll up, then stop, let the cameras get a flash
Nineteen years old, let the youngin’s get a pass
Let them other people pass, let them pass away
They just mad we got in early like it’s matinee
And I ain’t have to say that this comes natural
And I ain’t have to stay because the cash is close
In the mall, we helicopters like Apache, though
Now that-that-that you know, tell her the one that you know
Let’s go

[Chorus: Matt Martians]
I’m searching for, I’m waiting for
I’m searching for... you
I’m searching for, I’m waiting for
I’m searching for... you

[Verse 2: Matt Martians]
I wish I could take a trip back into time
One would be yours and one would be mine
I’m so out of this world, not coming down
But I’m still searching for what can’t be found

[Chorus: Matt Martians]
I’m searching for, I’m waiting for
I’m searching for... you
I’m searching for, I’m waiting for
I’m searching for... you
