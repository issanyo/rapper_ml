[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
I'm tryna fuck before the bomb drops
Get to you before they build that wall
Party on to my heart stops
Before all of that cholesterol
They copping pistols, apocalypto
But I just want you to take that off
If they pull us over they can't hold us
We'll fuck in front of that racist cop
The world gone to shit
We just trying to get lit
24k handcuffs they arrest me Imma go flex
Take you back to my death bed
Treat every day like my last
I promise you Imma go slow
But my father told me live fast
Cause we might

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
I don't wanna die alone
If I don't get to see you girl then we might
Fuck like five times in a row
Baby have you seen the world
Cause we might die
It's the end of the world as we know it (We might die)
I just wanna get you naked see you throw it (We might)
Fuck all that money that I made (We might)
What's all that hard work without pay
We might die

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
The pussy the death of me
The pussy the life of me
Ebony, ivory
No type of weaponry
Could ever be rivaled
Nuclear missiles to rifles
Swear I'm a son of a gun
Went to the United Nations
America we love our guns
Imagine a world like John Lennon
Be my Yoko Ono during armaggedon
Where will I be in my last days
Hopefully Imma be all up in it
Smoky red skies baby let's ride
To the next life (Skrrt!)
Baby won't you light my fire
Let's watch the westside burn
We might...

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
I don't wanna die alone
If I don't get to see you girl then we might
Fuck like five times in a row
Baby have you seen the world
Cause we might die
It's the end of the world as we know it (We might die)
I just wanna get you naked see you throw it (We might)
Fuck all that money that I made (We might)
What's all that hard work without pay
We might die

[Outro: Dumbfoundead]
I don't wanna die alone (We might)
We might fuck like five times in a row
(Lately have you seen the world, yeah we might die)
It's the end of the world as we know it (We might)
We might
