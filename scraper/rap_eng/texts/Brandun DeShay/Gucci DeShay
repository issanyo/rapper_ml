[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
True story
I started this at, like, eleven-o’clock Chicago time
And I’m gonna do the whole mixtape tonight and
Go to sleep fucking exhausted
Yo

[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
This what you're all been waiting for, the spaceship has finally taken off
Space hoes in they space clothes, tell them take them off
Break them off proper on that KitKat shit
Smelling like success, get a big ass whiff
I’m the gift and my presence is the present
I’m guessing it's a lesson, my confessions to the reverend
I’m sorry I had to kill them, they don't pay me attention? I bill them
Since I was a chillun, I'd see them BMXs and steal them
A bad boy, just a tad coy, getting told on to the tabloids
Quiet, but my actions made loud noise
Now, more than ever, I crave attention, I’m ADD
At my last shows, I brought many hoes, like 80 deep
Skating cheap, cheap skate, my money stay in wallets
Until I cop Impalas, polish them big like Christopher Wallace
I honestly think I’m hotter than most of your favorite rappers
Turn them girls on like old people do Clappers
Dick so big, my girl thought it was a strap-on
It took fucking forever to find this beat just to rap on
Now it's on, I’m starting to get warmed up
Practice drills, rapping until I'm stacking mills, trying to get more bucks
Like Milwaukee's scouting couch, I’m trying to get more Bucks
These hoes full of drugs more than Lil Wayne's tour bus
I’m sure you know: super flow, super beats, Super 3
They used to call me super lame
What that make me, Superman?
Then call me Clark Kent, I get more ass than a park bench
Dirty toilet seat, don’t start shit
That’s a smart tip, if you want it, you should take it
Rap is love, don’t fake it, just make it

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
...And we'll keep it moving
Maestro?
