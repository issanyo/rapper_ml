[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Y'all is dead weight, less great, always getting second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dipping while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't Dicaprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwich's are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7" giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls want makeup, get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feeling like a hundred wars are going on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Acting like you fucking with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do, something that ain't tangible
Now I'm 'bout to hand it to the homie Michael Rocks, hear what he saying to you

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
Take a trip, took a molly out with Banco Populari
The word around the city is he sit in a Ferrari
I told myself I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party 'til my cardies get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her lock, then lost the key
Weed smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder then the Carter one
Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not saying it's coming soon, but I want the real show
Get me the treatment that you getting all the heels for
The shit they paying all the bills for
Man, I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for, by pictures
I'm feeling good, I'm peeling bills, I'm real as hell
I don't front, I roll blunts and papers
I don't fuck with fakers, your girl is asking me if I'mma take her
I'm straight though, you see, I'm booked up 'til April
That's mine, that's me, I take those, you tryna see some pesos
Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for
Stop acting like you can't go, you swagging to the ankles
I feel you baby, hopefully I look familiar maybe

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you will never ever get it because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holding the drugs
And you can never ever see her because

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land, and then the bags come
We walking on this planet seeking action
Break a girl's heart, sorry Miss Jackson

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you will never ever get it because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holding the drugs
And you can never ever see her because

[Bridge 2: Mac Miller]
And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top
And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top

[Outro: Mac Miller]
I'm so high, won't you think about that babe
On some other shit that tend to make me act crazy
15 thousand, blow it on clothes
6 in the morning, still sitting here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home
