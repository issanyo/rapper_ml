[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
I see what you want
I got you
Yeah

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
You want the fashion, right? You want the flashing lights?
You want the girls gone wild, you want them flashing, right?
Don't want to ask the price, you want a actress, right?
You want to be the one that everybody acting like
But tell me, dog, what in the world would you sacrifice?
Yo, I would give this all up, don't got to ask me twice
I dare anybody to ask me what my life is like
Full of hardships, it's hard shit like stalagmites
You see what I'm saying? I live the closed captioned life
If life was a plant, my plant will barely capture light
Photosynthesis, hope this ish would just last the night
Over in a day, hope that my hopes are asinine
A piggy bank for a brain, I got cash in mind
Walk around with chips on his shoulders, I'm trying to cash in mine
Tried to enslave my brain, but I got a mastermind
It's clear that I mastered mine
But tell me do

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
You want you the cars?
You want you the girls?
You want you the money?
You want you the world?
Well, good luck, homie
Good luck
Good luck homie
Good luck
You want you the cars?
You want you the girls?
You want you the money?
You want you the world?
Well, good luck, homie
Good luck
Good luck homie
Good luck

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
I'm just living my life, hitting like I'm even planning the fame
Got redshirted, that's probably why I ain't playing no games
You should be cuffed, come out with your two hands up
Y'all ain't playing for real, y'all want two hand touch
I follow my nose, I'm living on that toucan stuff
I'm like imagination, that shit that you can't touch
Take a poll on who would die for this, who stands up?
Just me, Radio Raheem, and you can't touch
It's tough for making music like this and it's hard to ration
For rapping, I'm sure even Christ admires my passion
I wonder what's my purpose, I sound like the lamest asking
But I known to wear my heart on my sleeve like the latest fashion
I just want to resume that music is whom saved my life when I was a zero
And now it's my turn to play hero
This music's got to burn, it's my turn to play Mir√≥
And peace like Buddha
Do

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
You want you the cars?
You want you the girls?
You want you the money?
You want you the world?
Well, good luck, homie
Good luck
Good luck homie
Good luck
You want you the cars?
You want you the girls?
You want you the money?
You want you the world?
Well, good luck, homie
Good luck
Good luck homie
Good luck
