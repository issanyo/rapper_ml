[Hook]
We all winners, grind til' the sun up
Young n' on the come up
Young n' on the come up
Work all Winter, just to spend on the Summer
Young n' on the come up
Young n' on the come up
We all winners, grind til' the sun up
Young n' on the come up
Young n' on the come up
Work all Winter, just to spend on the Summer
Young n' on the come up
Young n' on the come up

[Verse 1]
Ha, really you good?
All you fuck niggas, swear that you all on my nuts
Believe me it's true
I ain't worried 'bout you because I'm me as fuck
These guys was gassin' me up
While my comrades was passin' me up
[?], [?] off my beats
Say man, that ain't what's up
Turn all the lights down
These girls go in wild
Traphouse, no boys aloud
We cookin' the golden child
We bound to turn up while showin' out
I think I'm Rick James, bitch I'm on ya' couch
Had dreams of this win, come in large amounts
Ya'll seen what I seen, ya'll would cross 'em out
Then we bought the Benz, had to whip it like a whisk
Thousand dollar nigga' with a million dollar bitch
Shootin' for the stars 'til I like it, can't miss
My whole clique stuntin', we stuntin' the same shit
Show up to the party, already on the list
Make my home peace, we ain't gotta pay shit
Everybody hatin' on a nigga like Chris
You may not know me well, but you probably get the gist

[Hook]
We all winners, grind til' the sun up
Young n' on the come up
Young n' on the come up
Work all Winter, just to spend on the Summer
Young n' on the come up
Young n' on the come up
We all winners, grind til' the sun up
Young n' on the come up
Young n' on the come up
Work all Winter, just to spend on the Summer
Young n' on the come up
Young n' on the come up
