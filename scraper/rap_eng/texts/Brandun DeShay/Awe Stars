[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Take a look at me and they can tell I've
Rapping so long, I got more bars than cell blocks
Every interview, they asking if I want the deal or not
Asking if I sell lots
Nigga, is hell hot?
There go your answer, that pessimism's your cancer
Best to beat it like [?] beat it like Micheal Jackson
Most of these niggas lacking the skill it takes to make classics
They come to me, looking plastic, real hearts is made out of molasses
I'm hard and they looking plastic, please say I'm not the only one
Flyest nigga up in the club, ain't even twenty-one
Quit my day job to make a living off having fun
Making beats; better yet, made a killing, that's hella sweet
Guaranteed I'll bet I get that money, like, pronto
But trust me, I'ma get you in the end, Tonto
Don't play me like a console and we'll be all good
Todos, bien, let the games begin

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
If this XXL cover Obama, I'm the hardest of McCains
310, said it first, I'm just staying in my lane
Crashing into haters 'cause my speed is insane
Dreams on my brain, trying to scheme to make a change
To get cream and the fame and my team do the same
I'm alcohol on the track, yeah, the kid, the one to blame
I remember two years ago, they didn't know my name
Now these hoes scream me out like I'm putting them in pain
The young boy, I came to kill them again
Sorry rapper, I ain't really feeling you, man
Got the call from [?] I told him the weekend
Would be the best time, school on the weekdays
Schoolyard niggas, y'all suspended for three days
It's two types of niggas: real and fake
'Cause your bros turned sour when you talking 'bout cake
'Cause they can't be fair when you splitting up what you make

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
Okay, I rock these dope bands, but I make the game step up
Got that doctor money, I'm just trying to get my check up
Balling, balling, somebody call a ref up
View these boys in hindsight, think they need to catch up
People say I'm next up, [?] throw them up like [?]
Plus my clique's some animals and y'all boys just some Cheetah Girls
Gotta stay protected, dog, you know that it's a crazy world
When niggas put that hit up in your head like a pressing curl
Yeah, they repping hard, know how to play they cards
Handle the right like guards, they call me Charizard
Why? Because I spit that fire, your flow is like rims, it's tires
So I must detach your wires with this steel, I call it pliers
And your girl love me, dog, I am the best, man
Look at you like Wolverine, why? 'Cause you a ex-man
Got a lot of paper and you'll never take it from me
Yeah, this Rockie Fresh, bitch, and I'm busy getting money
Motherfucker
