[Verse 1]
Ay, See you and then trying something new
Now I don't want to tell you what to do
I just want to get what you want
Girl, I only want to put you on
Give you just a little taste
I slide through and pull up to your place
Giving me the go, I can not wait
Introduce you to some anim√©
I waited so long for this day
Go buy some boba and then come over [?]
And then we cut, cut like any [?]
I'm eating that pussy like gomei
All the realest, so talko got, you know the deal
Ay, she used to rave and pop the pills
Ay, I done turned out for real
Just tryna cut you, roll and chill
