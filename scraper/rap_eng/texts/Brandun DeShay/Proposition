[Verse 1]
Listen to me closely
I have a proposition for you
But when you get to know me
You'll find out I'm a cool guy
(Yes)
So we can take it slowly
I have so many things to show you
We can make a dream a reality
Cause' baby girl you're so fly, so fly

[Pre-Chorus]
Just take my advice and make a sacrifice
Where the treasuries of life can find you
In this world of crime you can choose to take your time
Let the pleasures of life just guide you

[Chorus]
There's no dreaming of this love cause' it's real
Lookin' for the signs from above to seal the deal
Now it's time you realised
You can my sweet lady
Relax, post, connect, go

[Verse 2]
With your permission I can get it started
Relax and enjoy the party
Let's go
To another planet or another dimension
I will take you there in submission
But don't play with my mind
You're one of a kind, girl
And you know I'm not like these other guys I'm in front of the line

[Chorus]
There's no dreaming of this love cause' it's real
Lookin' for the signs from above to seal the deal
Now it's time you realised
You can my sweet lady
Relax, post, connect, go

[Verse 3]

Making you mine by the time all the [inaudible] that's all i knew
(Okay)
Telling you leaving with me okay let's get [inaudible] and i thought i'd be
(Okay)
But listen up, since I, please accept this invite
Don't be unsure

[Chorus]
There's no dreaming of this love cause' it's real
Lookin' for the signs from above to seal the deal
Now it's time you realised
You can my sweet lady
Relax, post, connect, go
