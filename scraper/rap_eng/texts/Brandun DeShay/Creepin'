[Intro]
All day!

[Verse 1: OGSwaggerdick]
Six in the mornin', wake up, grab a Smuckers
Pat my mama on the head, tell her that I love her
Hittin' NY, got a show wit' my brothas'
Swore we was The Beatles by the way that they loves us
But uh - shit got crazy, crazy
Shorty hit my phone like, "Baby, baby
Why you gotta be so shady, shady?"
Hoppin' outta' town, actin' like I ain't your lady."
Excuse me girl, don't pick this fight
Cause this ain't what you wanna
Sho'nuf I'll leave your ass dead and broke on the corna'
Cause word around town that I'm hotter than a sauna
And bitches done sleepin' on me, like they out a coma
I'm just playin' baby, I'm just sayin'
Don't keep like tabs like Internet
You been the best, so fuck these hoes
I'm fuckin' up these commas
Yet, you thinkin' that I'm creepin'
So fuck it, this yo' weekend
But just walk through, no sleepin'

[Hook]
It's no sleepin', on the weekend
Get lost and we can fly off the deep end
Yessir, aye, and we gon' creep tonight
So when I hit you, take the late night flight
Just bust a move
It's no sleepin', on the weekend
Get lost and we can fly off the deep end
Yessir, aye, and we gon' creep tonight
So when I hit you, take the late night flight
Just bust a move

[Verse 2: BrandUn DeShay]
The young child is golden
I was destined to raise hell like the old men
I'm somewhere outta' Japan, feelin' like I'm on 10
Bathin' with some bad bitches in the onsen
Wit' some old friends
In the backstreet of Shibuya, you know you that nigga
When people actin' like they knew ya'
Shawty asked my name
I said, "DeShay, but what's it to ya'?"
She said, "You look familiar
Maybe you could join me for a couple drinks?
It wouldn't kill ya'."
I dig, I let the moment last a bit
Now I'm feelin' the vibe like an acid trip
Shawty bad, got that kind of ass you gon' miss
She kept it real
She said if I smash, she gon' snitch
Nowadays, they just see the flashin' gold wrist
Massive four fifths, stashin' whole zips
I pass 'em fast, gimme the cash and cold whips
Ready for that reunion like class in '06

[Hook]
It's no sleepin', on the weekend
Get lost and we can fly off the deep end
Yessir, aye, and we gon' creep tonight
So when I hit you, take the late night flight
Just bust a move
It's no sleepin', on the weekend
Get lost and we can fly off the deep end
Yessir, aye, and we gon' creep tonight
So when I hit you, take the late night flight
Just bust a move
