[Verse 1: brandun DeShay]
No more fallin' in love, please
Fell so many times that we got skinned knees
It's funny cause we wasn't even lookin' for love
Was thinkin' handshake, and that turned into hug
Was thinkin' friendship, and that turned into "Uh..."
I think we crossed the line, it's too late to go back (Take it back!)
You know we too great to go bad
Who else you gonna find with the same love for N*E*R*D
Under the stars (?)
You felt something unique
You said you feel like I'm someone you need
I want to be the one, our hearts will beat as one
As least friendships, but when we got done, things changed
Shit, at least we got closure
I miss us hanging out like indecent exposure
You say I'm no different from the rest
I made this decision for the best
Yet, you still say I'm selfish
I guess...

[Hook: Allen Ritter] (x2)
I know that you're fallin'
Fallin' in my love
I can't let you hit the ground, not now

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Ain't that about a bitch?
Not this song, you're the girl I'm gonna miss
Even when we say goodbye we wanna kiss
This couldn't be beautiful, I had to be true to you
So I couldn't lead you on, I'mma follow you
Follow my heart, but I let you take a part
So if you gonna keep it, treat it like a secret
Never let me know, but don't ever let me go
Suppose there'll be hope for the future
I hate to know that it was meant for me to lose ya
I hate to play to lose, but love is a losing game
If you go all in, hope it's not a losing hand
Chose to stand there, when I wrapped you in my arms
A kiss could be dangerous and I don't mean to do you harm
You say this hurt will make it better? Believe me
I know, but I wish that it was that easy
I gotta go...

[Hook] (x2)

I know that you're falling hard and fast (x2)

*chorus plays, slows down*

[Outro: brandun DeShay]
I know you can't lie for me
I'mma see you happy even if it's not for me
Just words... I love you...
