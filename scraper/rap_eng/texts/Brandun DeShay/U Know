[Verse 1: Astro]
Niggas know us from picking a figure role
With more figures women get lower
Or below us
You could blow us
Don, lines over your head, raps LeBron
Give me 96 seconds
And I'ma put my people on
'96 when I was born
'86 when I was thought of
Fam are in my grant
Like I snuck across the border
100 M's matter fact
[?] counting stacks
Asshole lack whole
Rap in his black soul
Capture this soul
[?] no capsule
Flow crack though
Violate em late em
Write while they degrade him
Let the bait debate 'em
He keep his words OG verbatim
We still catch wreck and shine in one 5
Sunshine make them have a grey day
Grade A Tribe the greatest
We gon get a whole lot of cheese
Point blank period let that bleed

[Hook: Nathaniel]
When we walk through your town
You recognize the sound, baby
We get down, baby
We get down
Started underground and now it's all around
And you know
You know, you know
When we walk through your town
You recognize the sound, baby
We get down, baby
We get down
Started underground and now it's all around
And you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2: Astro]
It's still Brooklyn
For them we haffi lick shot
Ghetto in the bag
I could Ziploc 6 blocks
Stack a pile of G's, no apologies
I keep the passion and tell them its the Pac in me (How
'bout it, G?)
The A B what they can't see
A nigga flee like he just left a robbery
You get the point
Joints that I knock out
They don't wake up, my rate's up
Watch me climb the ladder more than [?]
Take us to the prize
Michael Jordan with this rap shit
Play a cold beat and I widen their eyes
You're doing way too much
I'm cool when I'm in her
My energy too G for beginners
I've been a Don since Born
Couldn't beat us in the fetus
Continuous hits the game need us
Rock star block star, jumping on cop cars
Front and we muscle them
The gods, allahu akbar

[Hook: Nathaniel]
When we walk through your town
You recognize the sound, baby
We get down, baby
We get down
Started underground and now its all around
And you know, you know, you know
When we walk through your town
You recognize the sound, baby
We get down, baby
We get down
Started underground and now its all around
And you know, you know, you know
