[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
I’m feeling fresh like a dude with new clothes
A dude with two hoes is sweet like sucrose
Who kick it like Judo with an expert like to those
If they don’t like to flow, then I’m just like toodles
Who need for no more people against my strategy
Already got enough people mad at me
‘Cause I was born with the mentality that came, saw, and conquer
Cain and Abel, kill a brother, no problem
And no hesitation, no recitation
Dude, if my flow is food, then it’d be cooked Cajun
And this is cooked crack, but not for your nose
More like air shipping, don’t pick it like boogers from your nose
Dude, I used to rap from journals
Was dope, but I lacked delivery like DiGiorno
And now every track, I come hard like pornos
And ever since, I don’t take ish like urinals
Now look how I turned those
Haters to friends
Boys to mens
And I’m at the end of this road
And there’s enough strip left just so I could take off in a Learjet
Go from Chicago to Tibet
And make a pit stop in California
Say what up to Deondria, Tyler, and Tommy Parker
In my jet, you can guess, yep a game of Contra
On my Sega Mega Drive and I’m about to fly
And transform like Megatron
To a mega don
Make ways like a Megalodon
That’s the type of ish I’m on
BrandUn DeShay meets Odd Future and now I’m gone
