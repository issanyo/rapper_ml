[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
We all met at Sam's house about 10 P.M
Out of work, ready to party with some of our friends
Laughs and jokes and making phone calls
And Laura staying with me, she said no one's home
We've been best friends since we were sophomores
She was the one who inspired me to get out more
Here comes George with the things for the pregame, I don't drink much
But I'm not the DD, so more like a backup
Now we all vacate and head out of the basement
I heard someone call "shotty", I'm too late
Then we hopped in the backseat with four more
This SUV is only a four-door, this ride better be short
And here's Laura next to me, so close that we're Siamese
But she's texting me, and the text reads:
"Keep an eye out for me, try not to forget"
But I already made that vow from the day that we met
The streetlights shine the bluest light
But how could I find joy on the bluest night?
I might have to carry her home, I made a vow
If she falls sick, if she passes out
If only I was man enough to man up, we could be on her couch
Probably making out, instead I made a vow
Hopefully this leads to us one day writing vows
Now everyone's getting out
We pile up the doorstep, music is playing loud
Almost like a teen movie, how this is playing out
We crowd the living room, there's spilled beer
Amongst all of the madness, a few tears
Laura's dancing with who knows, and so is the rest of them
I'm not much of a dancer, I'm talking to Chelsea and a couple of her friends
Live for the weekend
The suburbs' pastime
And nobody asked why
I'm sick of the same beer I had since I got here
It's making my mom proud, I know that she's not here
I can't help but stare at Laura, the feelings, I wish I only knew
My feelings, I wish she only knew too

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
3 A.M. rolls around, the party is over
We all jump back in the Rover
Except there's only four this time
The other ones got rides and left earlier in the night
Laid out in the backseat, all I'm thinking is rest
But Laura, next to me, lies her head on my chest
Then like a reflex, I wrap my around
And...

[Sample: Bloc Party]
I figured it out
I figured it out
I figured it out
I figured it out
I can see it again
I can see it again
I can see it again
I can see it again
I can see it again
