[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Ahem, if I can have your attention for a moment
But I finally started living in the moment
If I offer you my hand and you take it, would you fold it?
Not much of a royal flush, but the least you could do was hold it
I really, really like you, I just don't want you to know it
Got the tongue of an idiot and writing of a poet
No wind for this relationship, so I resort to rowing
If the slipper doesn't fit then I guess I have to grow in…to it
Huh

But every day, she’s seen with someone else
And every night, she kisses someone new

[Hook: brandUn DeShay]
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
Just how I feel, I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
The way I feel, I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
Just how I feel, when I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
The way I feel, I can't let you go

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
I hope that what we have here is mutual
Even had a psychic read my palm just to show me what the future holds
I hope that in the future, I'll be holding you, no future hoes
You a know-it-all but there's a lot of thing that you should know
Now I opened up the floors, so I think that you should go
First, then tell me what's the deal like Howie Mandel
But how a man feels is hard to confess
Like sex I'ma have to cum correct, I guess
Huh

[Pre-Hook: brandUn DeShay]
But every day, she’s seen with someone else
And every night, she kisses someone new

[Hook: brandUn DeShay]
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
Just how I feel, I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
The way I feel, I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
Just how I feel, when I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
The way I feel, I can't let you go

[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
I know my chances are slim like Ethiopian kids
And you showed me love back, but I'm hoping you willing
I'm hoping I'm wrong and this could be a tangible dream
‘Cause baby, I can be the man of your dreams
But the difference is I'm really here
To never know what could've been is the only thing that I really fear
Most of these people got problems ‘cause they doing it wrong
So we got to get it right just to prove that it's wrong
You know?
So…

Just how I feel, when I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
The way I feel, I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
Just how I feel, I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
The way I feel, I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
Just how I feel, I can't let you go
I'm hoping you say yes if I let you know
The way I feel, I can't let you go
