Ain't no nigga that's fresher I swear I do it better
Hit my beat man crack my travel
Been a broke nigga, man that shit won't settle
Been a broke nigga, man that shit won't settle
Tryin to feed that fam, hey
Been a broke nigga, man that shit won't settle

I got dreams that hidden a lot, whipping off the top
People ask me what I got, hold up I forgot
Young gas niga with a mind full of goals
You stay about mine I don't mind none of these hoes
I'mma get my regardless, knew what didn't started
If this was the way see, I would probably party
Young gas nigga but I'm tryin to get that chatter
So you ask me any question I would tell you who is better
Pitting the whip, taking the sip
Tryin to get some of these bitches to death
It's young true, man you know what it is
Came through the party and I handle my bus
Sipping on some going handle the ..
Appoint me what the camera it is
So I go shine like a motherfuckin light
Tell them hoes seat down when I handle my buss

Hey, tell me when you wake up in the morning
Easy dollars get it from my father so I had to pop my color
Green like some colors, you ain't fresh don't even bother
My whole fucking life I had to wonder and re-powder
But I'm still here on my grind, why this feel wasting your time
Money is all on my mind and my bick is here on my side
Watch me get inside, Michael Jackson I'mma just lie
Hit high knows like Banjo, she Bonnie I'm her Clyde
But that's just a story, I've been fresh till this morning
I'm so high and I'm yawn it, came down in this storm in
And my bitch keep on calling me, I got dreams to rock for it
I just fuck till it's foreign, kill a piece got a car

[2 x Hook:]

That shit was tight
I follow that shit
Hey, ..
Hey, most dope
