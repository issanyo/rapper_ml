Flew to Japan why you talkin' shit?
I ain't got nothin' but love for you
Comin' out straight from the mud boy you
Better quit chippin' like [inaudible] told you
You niggas watchin' for slugs only
Hoes tried to chat me like mad times
She duckin' rubber like bath time
She want my baby won't have mine

Hope your locks changed on your doors
See me locked in it's your box [inaudible]
I am not playing with you hoes
Niggas treat me like Stevie Wonder would
Man don't see me but they know I'm there
Cold chill like a Polar Bear
Shoutout Krillin with the solar flare
It's a lot of hate to ingest
I heard a lot shit i ain't impressed
To the day i give this shit a rest
I gave all i could and nothing less
Ayo then she call me "man he fresh"
Cause' when they see me they say "man he fresh"
Every year they sayin' [inaudible] the next
When i finna' get the chance to flex?

[Chorus]
