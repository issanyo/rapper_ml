This decision hard
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
I never let 'em tear our love apart
The past we should forgive
I never really call you out your name
Or never say "I love you, girl" in vain
We know it's been a while
If we were in Japan, know what they say?
Probably hisashiburi desu ne
Been studyin' a lot
I'll be in Tokyo in the March
For 7 months, starin' at my watch
And all that I can do is think about the times that we shared
Missin' you, and wishin' you were here
But now we finally are
Your smile shinin' brighter than the stars
I hold you close to me cause you were far
But now you're in my arms
And all I wanna tell you girl is why
I'm so fucking glad by my side
Let's walk along the beach
The sand and the water start to meet
We feel the ocean crashin' at our feet
The day with the gods

[Hook]
The sun and the gold
The circle of life
There's stars just like diamonds
But nothing like your shine
The sun and the gold
The circle of life
There's stars just like diamonds
But nothing like your shine
