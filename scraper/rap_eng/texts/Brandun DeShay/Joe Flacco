Many selections, Some use pipes, others use injections

[Hook]
Smoke joints, I ain't worried 'bout tobacco
Duck texts let 'em pass like Joe Flacco
All I really need's friends, need's friends and
We do this every weekend, weekend, YEAH

[Verse 1]
Let me lay this beat real quick
What you think I can't flex on a slow beat
Watch the drop, then cop the watch
Now all these motherfuckers tryna compete

What it's like for a guy like me?
Work hard tryna make ends meet
By the end of the week, it's weak
Cause you right back, in the position you used to be

But, let me slow it down real slow
I just wanna let you know
That life ain't really that bad
In fact it's all gold

Don't sit around getting old
Go and get your paper, paper
Went around ain't doing shit for a young kid
Living around all these haters

Papers smoking, vapors choking, hope to see 25
Low-key zoning, floating, I don't know if I'm really alive
But it really is, I hate when they ask my ass like "Yo, what's up?"
I don't really know, just chill, this beat was never enough

[Hook (x2)]
Smoke joints, I ain't worried 'bout tobacco
Duck texts let 'em pass like Joe Flacco
Cause all I really need's friends, need's friends and
We do this every weekend, weekend, wassup?

[Verse 2]
I got a date with Destiny, she never hit me though
I really just sit around and listen to the radio
Talk shows, cause I don't like that Pop Shit, that KBS (fuck you)
I hate the cops, cause all they want to do is arrest you (fuck you)

I'm tryna buy a drop, I hope that shit impress you
They say that time is money, and it's funny
Cause I'm hoping that I'm not too late
I'm taking too long to get out the festival

I know that God blessed you
Will he come to my rescue?
I think it's good to party
You say you down to ride

They say they comfortable
But, I think it's bad to lie
You went to school to learn, earn money, probably read
I went to school and learned to leave, in turn I burned the weed

I rap for 1%, none of you average cats
I'm tryna battle rap, I'm getting drunk of magic hats
What kinda tag is that dog, do you even draw?
Are we all criminals? Do we all follow the law?

So don't judge me cause I'm arrogant, my shoes are musty
Still my crew got love for me, and all these groupies wanna hug me
Dressing up like a druggie, dog, I don't need your money
Gave you your album, you recoup, now get the fuck away from me

I mean I know you love me
That's why you won't drop my ass
Cause when they need a hit
I throw it to 'em like Stockton pass

I say this not to brag, I really mean it though
I A&R my own shit, You fuckboys don't hear me though
If you see me in Boston drinking bottles on the stoop
Smoke a joint with your boy, keep it real with the dude

Don't try and play me like an idiot, I know the prices
My life is beautiful, I only got a couple vices

[Hook]
