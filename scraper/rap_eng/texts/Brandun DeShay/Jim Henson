I never party
No time for celebration
You chasing liquor
Im chasing figures and bacon
I need money and meal
Not molly and a pill
I need time you needed a deal
The shit i hate to think but i still say it tho
I am high but im spraying low toward the radio
Jim henson all of yall are puppets
Interventions all of yall are sluggish
Add salt to the game
Assualt in the name
Of rodney , martin luther , jr , and reality kings
Some shit i tre to
Im as a hard as getting hard to fake boobs to gay dudes to date dudes
Diffucult at most
As spiritual as ghost
When i float in these quotes
Like the ocean flow smootha then most men

Pause

Pause

Pause

Play


I am god im forever you are not you are never
As clever as me whenever i speak similes on these beats
By deshay i eat any beat in my way just gimme a plate
And ill hit it out the park
I was afraid of a baseball
But im quick to spark in a park after dark
Hear the crickets when we burn
We made a right then made a left then made another right turn
On my speaker screaming out
Bleeding out like her wrists
Im tired of this shit
