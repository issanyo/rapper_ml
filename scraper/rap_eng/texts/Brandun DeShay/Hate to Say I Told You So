[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
Shaking hands like they knew us, grands like we blew up
Took a stand when they ran, now I'm the man like I grew up
Damn, yeah, I always knew that I could
Dog, I always knew that I would
Shaking hands like they knew us, grands like we blew up
Took a stand when they ran, now I'm the man like I grew up
Damn, yeah, I always knew that I could
Dog, I always knew that I would

[Verse 1: Von Pea]
Y'all hella augmented, ny bad, I mean mad
I forgot I'm [?] not O, asterisks
[?] asterisks, I ought to relax a bit
And stop writing for myself, nobody could catch me, shit
Slaving in the studio until I finally master it
Dream chasing nine years, I'm about to capture it
Pea's crazy ideas, people used to laugh at them
I was writing rhymes here and now there's fans rapping them
A African-American is President
And they was just hosing us and peppering, excellent
Now we more than half-right, trying to get the cash right
And I'm half [?] so my girl's only half white
Stop crying, that was a joke line
But I ain't playing when the crib need a cosign
I'm archaic with the big pen and dope lines
I done sweated y'all out and it ain't even showtime

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
Shaking hands like they knew us, grands like we blew up
Took a stand when they ran, now I'm the man like I grew up
Damn, yeah, I always knew that I could
Dog, I always knew that I would
Shaking hands like they knew us, grands like we blew up
Took a stand when they ran, now I'm the man like I grew up
Damn, yeah, I always knew that I could
Dog, I always knew that I would

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
I'ma keep it one hundred so I ain't have to write for this
My passion is like the lighter that ignites this shit
Forget a candle, nobody holds the lights to this
Hoping money come in this bitch and brings lives to this
But no miscarriages there, this future might be marajhin
Chasing the dream I'm owning more cars than I got garages
Hella people that fuck with me like I'm into menages
They got my back like massagers and keep me shining like polish
I promise I can see clearly, I don't need these glasses
I'm advanced like Game Boy and AP classes
I study, I'm always ready for what comes next
I'ma rise just as sure as the sun gon' set
I recognize I got dope lines like coke lines
And it's easy to see my future like it was smoke signs
While you [?], I'm trying to stack some with my songs
I be getting more love than Michael Jack-son

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
Now we shaking hands like they knew us, grands like we blew up
Took a stand when they ran, now I'm the man like I grew up
Damn, yeah, I always knew that I could
Dog, I always knew that I would
Shaking hands like they knew us, grands like we blew up
Took a stand when they ran, now I'm the man like I grew up
Damn, yeah, I always knew that I could
Dog, I always knew that I would
Shaking hands like they knew us, grands like we blew up
Took a stand when they ran, now I'm the man like I grew up
Damn, yeah, I always knew that I could
Dog, I always knew that I would
Shaking hands like they knew us, grands like we blew up
Took a stand when they ran, now I'm the man like I grew up
Damn, yeah, I always knew that I could
Dog, I always knew that I would
