[Verse 1]
This might come as sort of a surprise
But, I'mma have to put my two weeks in
I wanted this relationship to work
But this relationship is work
And we both know I hate doing that shit
So rather than waste time tryin' to find out what the hell is missin'
Like, for instance, this is missin' a bass line
We can both just call the thing off and find some new fling
Both of us can start giving all of our face time to
And it's true, lately I ain't been trying as hard
But you started this, so why not try this on for starts?
You're like the only one I'm textin' but you go through my phone
Always assumin' that I'm sextin' even though I'm alone
Now tell me that ain't wrong
You said you're buildin' up trust but it's been over six months
Now tell me that ain't long
Already cheated on me once, kind of lookin' like a dunce
But I stayed anyway
Not tell me that ain't strong
I mean, come on. Everybody told me to fall back
Cause what I'm dealin' with is all bad
Fortunate for you, I don't listen to none of my peers
So all that really great advice was fallin' on dead ears
I mean, you're everything I wanted: mentally and physically
The only thing I hated was your history. You gettin' me?
Couldn't take the walls down your exes made you put up
Hope some day you learn when to put your foot down and lift your foot up
