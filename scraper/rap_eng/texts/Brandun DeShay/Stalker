When On one date now she call me all the time

She say she can't resist the more i say no
A real life stalker man she won't let go (2x)

[Verse 1 - Hollywood FLOSS]

First lets get it straight I can hold my own weight
I don't need NO one setting up no blind dates
But my friend approached me like man I need a favor
My girl has a friend I want to see if you'd date her
Thought for a second said nah I'm good
He said too bad I told her you would
So you know my next question, how does she look
She has a great personality she reads books
Oh boy a loser lets get this over
Seconds later they tapping us on our shoulders
What takes me back was shorty was gorgeous
The type that only date lawyers who drive porches
Self esteem was low, but i see that all the time
Especially with models and girls who are dimes
I should of saw the signs but damn she was fine
Took my number down said call anytime

[Verse 2  - Hollywood FLOSS]

When on one date matter fact yesterday
Now my inbox got 30 messages to play
Attention was cute at first I admit
But texts every minute gets annoying as shit
What are you doing What are you up too
Can I see you You know that I love you
Tabs on my movement showing up announced
Arrived at my party saw you then bounced
Calling my work just to flirt on the clock
Broke into my house had to change my locks
Slashed my tires tried to start fires
Come to find out the girl had priors
I don't want to be with you had to say it nicely
Soon as I did the girl tried to fight me
Restraining order just in case
Gotta take precautions never to safe

Lesson learned dont go by beauty
Cause a messed up mind ain't worth the booty
And ya find yourself hiding out
Paranoid and scared in your own house
Change ya number you can't date
Cause she told facebook that you had Aids
And Make boundaries clear from startup
Or find yaself dealing with a real life stalker
