[Chorus]
Wakaru, Wakaru
We gon ask you, "who the fuck you talking to?"

Wakaru, Wakaru
We gon ask you, "who the fuck you talking to?"
Talking to
Coming round here like we rock witchu
Rock witchu
Nigga said, "Show ya right."
You don't wanna roll the dice

[Verse 1]
Deezy, where you been?!
Stacking yen, doing hella shit
On my Bryson Tiller tip
I'm back and I'm better bitch!
Shibuya, we hella lit
Chibuya, I represent
I school ya, no reprimand
Tabun? No, a definite
I'm out here making yen stack
32 bars on a J.A.M track
Dippin out the casa with Tsubasa, thats a syntax
While you losers follow in line
I'm going Bleach with the heat, tips hollow inside
OK, I play... Lyrically I'm the same
I'm going bleach with the beats, fuck with me and get stained
You might see me with some Gucci
Or Monica, no Belluci
But my X-Large fit with my Takeo Kikuchi
100% paid, 106 ways
I could ball on you niggas 106 days
I don't love em, I duck em, I do what a pimp says
I be stuck in my ways, I be stuck in my ways
Yeah!
The maverick cat in the habitat
Born half and half, the Afrocentric Asian be the aftermath
Oh, I had to laugh, yall goofy with the back-to-backs
Booth be like the tabernacs, writing raps til the tablet cracks
You doubt me like Yoshi in Smash
I'm going Master Roshi, riding Denentoshi and back
Or probably somewhere in Osaka, drinking saka, eating sushi
That's Supreme on my hat, but a nigga feel gucci
It's obvious that all this godliness gotchu probably pissed
No ollie shit when I pop up on you, that's a promise bitch
I'm honest with, every word I say, don't gotta politic
And wavy, my armada lit
Peace, now I'm outta this
(GONE!)

[Outro]
Yo, I been having a good time out here
You know what I'm saying
This my first time in Japan but it feel like I've been here before
You know what I'm saying
Me and Tsubasa, we with two honeys
You know what I'm saying
You might get lucky if you can get a meal
Or Tsutaya and Chill
Let's get it
