Yesterday I had a dream that I was in heaven
With a 2 11 and my girlfriend never stressin nigga
I’m just tellin ya, smokin on some shit that make you feel
Like it’s propelling ya
But my whole life I knew that shit would never measure up
So I stepped it up, ain’t no nigga had to lecture us
They knew I was focused on my shit and never messing up
Truth be spitting peace treaty nigga put your weapons up
Tryina get that new thang ...intersection up
Don’t be freshen up, keep it simple it’s all mental
When the people that’s gonn get you man
You know where they gonn send you
To the top, where problems does a lot
I hate the fact that niggas always wanting what you got
And to you niggas out there prolly wishing that I stop
I would never quit and bitch I put that on my pops
I go so fuckin hard cause nigga I ain’t gotta lie
So if it’s bout the money, you can call me on the dot, on the dot

[Hook]
I’m bout to show you something you ain’t never know
And when it comes to music we already gone
And shout out to the team and they be puttin on
If it’s really bout the money hit my telephone
Hit my telephone, go and hit my telephone
Hit my telephone
Hit my telephone, go and hit my telephone
Hit my telephone
Hit my telephone, go and hit my telephone
If it’s really bout the money hit my telephone

1-800-money, I play that it’s so funny
And if I get this paper, will these people really love me?
Cause when a nigga home all I really hear is fussin
Sadness, happiness ain’t even a discussion
I need some robitussin, or something
All these fuckin problems nigga I can barely function
Kendrick really told his whole story about Compton
So chill in Burgh, I'm really here to tell them people something
About us

Don’t be talkin bout that shit if you ain’t walking out that shit
And your whole style play like a walkman on your wrist
When a nigga get pay, best believe I’m poppin chris
And I’m rushing to the store like I’m bout to shop lift
And you know that it ain’t christmas but a nigga got gifts
And my whole float wave like a guitar grift
And my bitch she love to shake it like she got no dips
I’m just tryina be a legend so I got this here, bitch!

[Hook]
I’m bout to show you something you ain’t never know
And when it comes to music we already gone
And shout out to the team and they be puttin on
If it’s really bout the money hit my telephone
Hit my telephone, go and hit my telephone
Hit my telephone
Hit my telephone, go and hit my telephone
Hit my telephone
Hit my telephone, go and hit my telephone
If it’s really bout the money hit my telephone
