[Intro: Sample]
Why you drive so fast? Because I'm chasing a dream
And when I catch that motherfucker, I'ma rape it and leave, yeah
Why you drive so fast? Because I'm chasing a dream
And when I catch that motherfucker, I'ma rape it and leave, yeah
Why you drive so fast? Because I'm chasing a dream
And when I catch that motherfucker, I'ma rape it and leave, yeah
Why you drive so fast? Because I'm chasing a dream
Because I'm chasing a dream, because I'm chasing a dream, and yeah

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
At night, before I close my eyes
I close my hands towards the skies
I know I never chose this life
But while I got mine, I'm gonna hold this tight
I thank God for being here now
I thank God for being there then
I can try, but I will never know how
The earth still spins when every soul full of sin
But while we here
I'd like to take this time out to let them know that someone still cares
Let them know there's someone who still fears you
When you speak, Lord, someone still hears you
I know it seems like I strayed from my path, Lord
But you still give me everything I ask for
You know me better than I know myself
If not for my parents, then I'll owe myself

[Chorus 1: brandUn DeShay]
Just follow your dreams
Know that what you see is always more than it seems
Life is not about finding out what it means
Just find out what it means to you
And remember to... just follow your dreams
Know that what you see is always more than it seems
Life is not about finding out what it means
Just find out what it means to you

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
I know it might be hard to perceive
But when I'm awake, I see my dreams
At night, I find it hard to sleep
Inside, I know where I'm supposed to be
In life, you only get two options
Hooked on Rojo or toxins
Move towards one, the other one stops
Then you're forced to choose which one you'd push stock in
Because you can be the person that you should be
Or you could be the person that you couldn't be
You'll never find out what you would be
Until you've already become, but that's a good thing
In life, you're only promised one thing, that's death
So I suggest, while you're here, give it your best
Ain't nothing like living life with regrets
Before I die, I'm trynna live it 'til there's nothing left

[Chorus 1: brandUn DeShay]

[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
If you could take a trip through my mind
Then you could see the world through my eyes
Then you could see the stars in my skies
You would understand why I pray just to take flight
I give the feel of life right before sunrise
If only I can do it, man, just one time
Fly away and as soon as I touch clouds
I'll make a vow that I'm never ever coming down
I'ma fly around the world for a whole day
And at night, take flight out to the Milky Way
Galaxies around me, no way
I finally see, there's no bars to this cage
It's like this whole time, I could take flight
And everything I dreamed, it was real life
If you could build a dream, it could build you
No one can tell you what you can and what you can't do

[Chorus 1 (2x): brandUn DeShay]

[Chorus 2 (2x): brandUn DeShay]
And remember to... just follow your dreams
Know that what you see is always more than it seems
Life is not about finding out what it means
Just find out what it means to you

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
And remember to... just follow your dreams
Follow your dreams
