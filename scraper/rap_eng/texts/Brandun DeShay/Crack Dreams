[Intro]
Tostitos are the shit

[Verse 1]
I'd rather die than be your slave
Slit my wrist wide and take this stage
Wipe blood out my eyes and you just lay there
You think I'm crazy, I am

[Chorus]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high
I do
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high

[Verse 2]
I'm just a unicorn, come catch me
Strap me in chains until I bleed
You know I like it, that's why I stay here
Why should I fight it?
I won't, I won't

[Chorus]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high
I do
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high

[Bridge]
Drove in from my small town
Looking for some action
Thought I could curb the crazy
But I can't
I just crave the pain boy
I just love the thrill

[Chorus]
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high
I do
I love you like I love Crack-Crack
I do
I love you like I like to get high

[Outro]
I'd do, for you, anything
I'd do anything
