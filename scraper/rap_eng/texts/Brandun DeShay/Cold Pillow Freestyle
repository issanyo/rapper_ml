[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah...
I've been thinking about it, and...
Baby, it feels like...

[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
Maybe this is the test run
I know you see the sun in the sky, so let's run
Towards it, my feelings so anointed
I swear I'm so blessed when I'm next to you
I don't wanna do nothing like a vegetable
I couldn't cope, I hope you're not playing around with my heart
This ain't a game, but baby, just press start
Don't even think about pausing
You a beast, you should show me your paws and
I'm a beast, I could show you my claws and
No walking, just crawling
Only thing I want to hear is just roars and
All that, baby, you're all that, I'm so truthful
Your medicine, give you a spoonful
Or a mouthful, you can use me as a mouthpiece
I wouldn't think about doubting thee
I couldn't cope, baby, without ya
And now back to our regular sponsors: us
I hope that nobody would watch us
As we burn the city down like Contra
The difference is that I am more of a contractor, I build up what I explore
And I leave intact when I implore
And I'm more of an architect
Baby, you are the fresh
You too cool for school, that's why you dropped out
You solely won't dropped out, don't top out
When you hop in, you won't hop out
So what we rocking, while they rock out
Will I succeed? I do not doubt
Fuck a plan B, there's no plan me
No shades of grey, y'all, I don't guess
Be like a Treble clef and just rest
