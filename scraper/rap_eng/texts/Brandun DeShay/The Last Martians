[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
She said, “I wouldn’t kiss you even if you was the last man on Earth”
Well, how about the last Martian?
I feel so alone on this planet
Damn it, maybe it was Mars I was from
And I just missed the last starship
Honestly, it’s hard just breathing this air
They trying to say I got asthma they trying to getting my ass out and leave them from here
It’s Bran-DUN, not Bran-DON
So I’m not the one that you should be putting brands on
Is that too much to ask? If I told you all of my goals
You’d be growing old, so I’d done too much to brag
I feel like none of you people try half as hard as me
I seen your work, look at you Jerkers half-heartingly
Yawn, so how can you expect success?
This game is Chess, and you must expect what’s next
So just respect doing life blaze blunted
No matter what you do, you’re just not gonna cut it
Blaze blunted, you’re not gonna cut it
No pun intended

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
I don’t have young niggas to blast for me
You have to see me in person to realize me saying that’d be blasphemy
I’m guilty of getting the girls with the ashy knees
You know what I mean, they take ones like soda machines
‘The older, the meaner the world gets’, my mother would say
And more every day, I’m saying stuff my mother would say
I ain’t gonna be a teenager for long
I enjoy hot games and rocking chains like Razor Ramon
Every time you see me, I’m getting bigger, Raven-Symoné
I had a son, his name is Bart, I had to raise him alone
Been dropping all these hot bars, I’m amazed at this song
They pick ‘em up (what?), pick me up, taking me home
And that don’t mean that I’m gone, in case I do disappear
I’m going to always have a fan, so long as you in here
Me quitting, you tripping, bring back a souvenir
Ya dig?
