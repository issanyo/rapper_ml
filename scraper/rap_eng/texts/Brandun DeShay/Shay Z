[Hook: Sample {brandUn DeShay}]
Presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me {always wanted to rap on this track}
I'm out for presidents to represent me {I'm about to give it my full attention, being (?)}
I'm out for dead (fuckin') presidents to represent me {in the meanwhile...}

[Verse: brandUn DeShay]
It's been a pretty wild three years
But I'm still here, so let's give him three cheers
Like hip hip hooray, never let a whore lay down with him
Made sure to keep up with the ones that's down with him
Never let down all the ones that cheered him up
I don't drink, but I'm alcohol, I'm always in the cut
Playing low-key like I'm in the octave
But get out of line, I'll spank that ass like your first doctor
That wasn't too proper, but who gives a uff?
Because I've been looking for one to give, I've almost given up
Living up to the potential that I was given
Niggas thought these was writtens, couldn't believe I was spitting
Off the top, sort of, never wrote it down
But I pace around my room, just thinking for a while
But who gives a shit? All that matters is you love it
The level that you reaching, dog, I'm already above it
It was nothing, playing Smash Bros. with my cousins on the weekends
My life was like a movie with a weak end
Ain't nobody buying it when it come out to DVD
Nigga, please, I'll end this with a bang like a trigger squeeze
Sick of me, but this audio say
To my face and drool when I walk away
Shay will stay the same with the fame or lane
They tried blowing the cartridges, now I'ma change the game
