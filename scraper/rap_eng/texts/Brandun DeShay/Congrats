[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Nah, I don't love her
I got a lot of white girls back in the suburbs
So how could I just give that all up just for one girl?
Ain't nothing but a word, do you know what you want, girl?
Find it absurd, do you know what you want, girl?
Me and the thought of you, you're singing your song with me
You're up and you're down, but with me is where you'd ought to be
And after all the arguments, you still gon' be raw to me
I need you to talk to me
I need you to say something, baby
You won't catch me reading between the lines like a checkout
Twilight, how a nigga always got his neck out
Quick to tell a heffer get the heck out
You got my upmost respect, I hope you feel that way
And when we old as fuck, I hope it's still that way
We started from the ground up, I hope we're built that way
You make my heart go *BOOM*
I hope you feel that, babe
Congratulations

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
Out of all the contenders, I think I found us a winner
Let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand
Congratulations, congratulations
Congratulations, let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand
Out of all the contenders, I think I found us a winner
Let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand
Congratulations, congratulations
Congratulations, let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Okay, now I know what you're thinking: 'This nigga must be drinking
He going all in after only a weekend'
Go off the deep end, but I don't need a lifeguard
I just need to roll up my arm like some Right Guard
Right after a hard day, this fairy tale starts far away
But this is magic like Hardaway
I probably couldn't have found a harder way to fall in love
But fuck it, let the fish burn like Carter say
You got the very best part of me
You got my heart, so babe, let's play it smarter, K?
Don't make me hate this
'Cause all that shit that you tossed like an important call
I gotta take this
Praying to God she don't burn me like a blank disc
'Cause I'm a pro with the pain, on my Hank shit
The last level of the game, so we can't win
With no coins left, I can't wait to tell the boys this

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
Out of all the contenders, I think I found us a winner
Let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand
Congratulations, congratulations
Congratulations, let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand
Out of all the contenders, I think I found us a winner
Let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand
Congratulations, congratulations
Congratulations, let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Out of all the contenders, I think I found us a winner
Let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand
Congratulations, congratulations
Congratulations, let's hear it for the girl, let's give the girl a hand
