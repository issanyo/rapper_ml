[Intro: Ace Hashimoto]
All Day

[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
Death to the radio nigga, this is where that saga ends
Up out the line of David like I'm his son King Solomon
Spitting that cookoo-khakha and nigga, we ain't coppin' it
Words it like currency, all my fans here with it profited[?]
Spit it it's prosperous, UA no stoppin' this
Get in my way, my third eye aimed like I'm cocking it
Stay in your lane, the words I say move them continents
Issa the souvereignous hot flame-molten lava shit
All these fucking rappers acting actors, don't know how to act
Pull they cards, they cards were blank, I'm acing all these royal tracks
Putting kings up on the map, I'm matching Queens with all my Jacks
Laughing from a peasant to an empire aristocrat

[Hook 1: Issa Gold]
Build the Metropolis, call it Indigo providence
Build the Metropolis, call it Indigo providence

[Verse 2: AK]
Conscious since creation
A nigga had to come to a realization
Use to go to church 'til I found my place
Been up in this world and it can create to unfurl
It's human nature to pursue this paper
Can't know that knowledge, put yourself in the maker
So I lead the impoverished cause they struggle the hardest
And I came from the same place, stuck in the darkness
Don't fight the voices within
We all know right from wrong we ain't kids
I'm rooting for the light and fighting 'til the end
And my insight heighten minds like hittin' strands, uh
Like to tell you you ain't nothing of value
Try to compel you from the wisdom inside you
Hit the rebel and if you ever decide to
Wee wee mothafucka let me guide you, uh
Kill em with the flow, it's the Young Indigo
We worship around the globe, love potion in your ho
Blow 'dro 'til overdose still focus on my goals
Promoting golden souls I'm chosen I suppose
Spittin' straight facts til the coffin my home
When I'm on my way back to the source of my throne
Ain't no holding me, no controlling these cats
When your memory back then I take what I own

[Hook 2: Issa Gold]
Build the Metropolis, call it Indigo providence
Build the Metropolis, call it Indigo providence

[Verse 3: Issa Gold]
Sent to twist[?] I'm making moves
Chasing the cool breaking the rules
Animals can't bang with you
I'm floatin' like an angel, fool
Sour tokes you lost that hope
I'll make a fucking man of you
Your remote, control your zone
That's why you ain't a fan of you
Took it, Loca, leave the show
Lieutenant to Indigo
Don't fuck with no hoes
She on the low, you need to let it go
Toking all my smoke I'm blowing O's
She choking-choking though
Gold up on my soul like my cologne
You know that's medical
Praise to the [?] bow down like the Peasant folks
The holy young seminole lead the truth like we in a moat, let's go
Floatin' I'm on your coast 'bout to go kill another show
Blowing that killer 'dro in the back countin' centerfolds

[Hook 3: Issa Gold]
Build the Metropolis, call it Indigo providence
Build the Metropolis, call it Indigo providence

[Verse 4: AK]
Back on my shit again
Sour spliff probably sippin' Hen
Can't win just sittin' there, homie
Get up and grow a pair, uh
Came up from the gutter like I'm next to bow
But still know that my soul worth more than gold
I smoke O's 'til my limit then I'm comatose
But don't test your compearance nigga play your role, uh
Living in a dream but this shit is what it seem
My team rank supreme, we steam packs of green
Juice got the 'dro with wax who got the lean
Stoned like Jerome that's fact, get in my league
Killing this shit nigga follow my lead
Dream free mothafuckin' nigga looked what I reached
Not peaked but I hover over nigga like fee's
Light feed all my brothers, I'm a legend my G

[Hook 4: Issa Gold]
