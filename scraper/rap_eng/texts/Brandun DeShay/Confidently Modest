[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Three, two, one
Blast off

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like
Nah, I just think I'm better
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like
Nah, I just think I'm better

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
It's young Veggies, mister back for another one
I'm on top of illest, homie, better than the other ones
Another verse, another gun, never run out of bullets
I said I never run out of bullets
Only I can come up with some shit like this, they call me the underdog
But I'm never under y'all
I always ball hog, never pass, never pair
Mom told me to go to class, I did that, I did that
Fresh young man, I is that, I is that
I'm shining like a new tat
Cliche, flow sick, watch me spit it at you
You hating niggas go ahead and check my stats, dude
Swag high, because I'm feeling like I blew up
Hot shit, but bet sound better screwed up
Looking in that mirror, I'm facing my own enemy
Every time I do it, it's with so much intensity, so much intensity

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
I feel like, I feel like
I feel like, nah, I just think I'm better
I feel like I feel like
I feel like, nah, I just think I'm better
Up in that Vogue sweater, playboy like Hugh Hefner
Trying to get more cheddar, get, get more cheddar
Yeah, yeah, you betcha, yeah, yeah, you betcha
I don't need them drugs because I'm high off life

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Go fly a kite, Beirut's altitude is high as plateaus
Y'all dudes can't step in my shoes, y'all got flat toes
That goes for any artist, living or departed
Y'all gonna have to pardon me using the potty on your party
I shut that shit down like flush it, I'm sorry, it's my hobby
Hot shit, like shit end in the Mohave, had to drink in hot wasabi, you got me? You copy
That's the difference, you're a stencil
And I'm a pencil
Get it through your head
Not Prince Albert, at least get it before you're dead
That don't make you a pencil because they fill up up with lead
A lot of niggas write, but I'm coming off the top because I spit it like a pens
Dispenser, this is my life, so I live it
Niggas don't take offense anymore, I give it
With or without the status, yeah, I'm young, but I make classics
Mama said she wouldn't look at me behind the glass
Unless I was wearing glasses
Now my money straight and y'all wildin' full of faggots
Knew I wouldn't have it, bad kid, spoiled since birth
So my first words were "I gotta have it"
Turned excellence into a habit
Bags underneath my eyes, I won't rest until I have it
Turned excellence into a habit
Bags underneath my eyes, I won't rest until I have it
That's it, that's sick

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
I feel like, I feel like
I feel like, nah, I just think I'm better
I feel like I feel like
I feel like, nah, I just think I'm better
Up in that Vogue sweater, playboy like Hugh Hefner
Trying to get more cheddar, get, get more cheddar
Yeah, yeah, you betcha, yeah, yeah, you betcha
I don't need them drugs because I'm high off life

[Verse 3: LaVish]
You can catch me cruising down the highway
Zooming in my driveway, we made it for the kids like Tom did MySpace
Going for the dividends, something real different
I'm a smart guy, call me T.J. Henderson
Lights, camera, action, crack's for the addicts
I've been making hits, notice that I used past tense
Streetwear fashion, models named Jasmine
Let the haters hate because all they do is get laughed at
Who you thought was in the building?
It's OF, baby, take your mind to the ceiling
Forget the small talk, tell me where I'll catch my millions
And where they dress with their bodies like Serena Williams
So, if all your dreams enchanted
Rock star life, something like Lenny Kravitz
We don't do the stats, we just roll around with plastic
Always talking proper, you can call me Braxton

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
I feel like, I feel like
I feel like, nah, I just think I'm better
I feel like I feel like
I feel like, nah, I just think I'm better
Up in that Vogue sweater, playboy like Hugh Hefner
Trying to get more cheddar, get, get more cheddar
Yeah, yeah, you betcha, yeah, yeah, you betcha
I don't need them drugs because I'm high off life
