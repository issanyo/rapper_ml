[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
Let's set sail on our relationship
Across the seas on a gentle breeze
I can take you down like submarines
In our submarine, submerged in dreams
I take you down 2000 leagues
Past the starfish, sea cows, and reefs
And coral
Where we can explore all
The things underneath the bedsheets or sheets of sand
Hand in hand
Or fin in fin
We done made it through the thick and thin
So how a little bit of water gonna stop us?
We gon stop the water like stoppers
Deep sea divers stop and they watch us
They can't believe that we don't need to breathe
But what they can't see is we got clearance
Clearly we got gills like Scott Heron
But still

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
I can take you higher
I can take you higher
I can take you higher than this
Yeah, said I can take you higher
Said I can take you higher
I can take you higher than this, yeah

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Land ahoy! Now we back to hand in hand
As we crawl from the coast with our hands in sand
Sunrise look as sweet as a candy stand
I had to say it 3 times like the candy man
Conversation about as dry as the desert we in
I felt like desertin, like dessert with an n
But I said I wouldn't quit, I'd stick it out until the end
Looked around and found a stick and carved a heart in the sand
Then I felt a raindrop, two drops on my hands
Two turned into a few drops
"I think see an oasis, what did you spot?"
She said, "It must be a mirage. I see a suitcase and two cars! "
With no time to wonder, we ran down yonder
Tumbleweed roll like the thunder we under
Unlatch the suitcase and what did we see?
Opened it up and found two pairs of wings
So

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
I guess I can take you higher
I guess I can take you higher
Yeah, I can take you higher
I can take you higher
We could take it up higher
We could take it up higher
We could take it up higher and higher and higher

[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
The sweet smell of the atmosphere
Got me feeling a little bit weird
There's something in the air, oh wait, that's me
Now we so fly, literally
No carpets to fold out like centerfolds be
We close to the action like front row seats
No one in the world can get sick of this
You flying with Rudolph like St. Nicholas
The difference between us and them
Is like Prada and H&M
They got wax wings like Icarus
Even with wings your figure still significant
And I ain't learn that in chemistry
But we got chemistry and we got geology
I'll put a rock on your finger as soon as I get outta here
But the problem is that we exiting the stratosphere
Our wings fall from grace as we fall towards space
But

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
I can take you higher
I can take you higher
Yeah, I can take you higher than this
Wait, no
I said it ain't nothing higher
Yeah, I swear it's nothing higher
It ain't nothing that's higher than this

[Verse 4: brandUn DeShay]
Is this a dream or it used to be?
Cause somehow we don't even need suits to breathe
I caught a glimpse of the pleiades
Like an ocean of stars, but if not an ocean a see at least
And then we see a spaceship arrive
You close your eyes to shade the blinding light
We clutch our hands tight as we ascend
Been shooting at the stars, I hope we still friends
You look out the window and you grip my arm
As the ship moves to infinity and beyond
Even the Milky Way seems small and far
The big dipper just turned into one big star
But I look into the window's reflection, why?
Cause I can see the stars in your eyes
Even when we out of space or in outer space
When your hand's in mine, we never out of place
I told you I can take it up higher
I told you that I can take you up higher
