[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Welcome
Aris P!
​brandUn DeShay
It’s monumental right now
What you’re doing is kind of simple
Oh

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
DeShay in the house tonight
Mind out the box in some brand new Nikes
Girls is face down like there’s two, right?
This song ain’t got a hook, but I’ll bet you’ll bite
Rhymes off the hook, I mean off the chain
A small price to pay for going off the brain
Put down the pen and the pad, and ever since
I’ve been murdering beats, no evidence
I rhyme with so much elegance
Y’all bunch of rhymes can’t get like elephants
Y’all rappers on your period like elements
Bet you I can make you Bebop like Ella Fitzgerald
Clothes not fresh, they’re sterile
That’s why I spit a song and you feel it in your bones like marrow
Not much more I can tell you other than the world need hugs
And don’t do drugs

[Verse 2: Aris P! & brandUn DeShay]
In this place on the right
There’s some chicks I got to get by the end of the night
My shirt is so worthy, the chicks may bite
Chicks is so fly, they just may take flight
If you’re high enough, this won’t sound odd
I don’t smoke, but feel high enough to hide by God
And I don’t have a real type, brah
I just hope I’m not attracting these psycho broads
I’m on the 8 Mile like the staircase
Saw that these girls in a game of police, give me fair chase
Make me work for it, I’ll take the day shift
Even punch in early to work the grave shift
I’m feeling like holding this place
Girls falling for me like there’s a hold in this place
Straight taking over this place
Plus my rhymes are sick, I’m afraid you may catch a cold in this place
Ladies, listen, I can’t wait to feel your tongue
With my breath of fresh air, go ahead and fill your lungs
Hopefully you will let me fill your cup
Maybe the last thing I do before I fill you up
I’m kidding, at least a part of me is
Don’t want to sound rude, so pardon me miss
Sit back, kick back, and breathe, let the leaders lead
And I’ma keep killing this track, let the sticks bleed
There’s some fine young chickadees up in here
I’m looking for some Mayas and Tiffanys
I know these dudes too sick of me
I got the deals on the table and their girl is the centerpiece
For the guys, it’s a bummer
Your girl never did track, but I’m going to prove she’s a runner
If we stay hot like the majority of the summer
We’re bound to stand out like minorities in the suburbs

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
So, uh
If you don’t know right now
Uh, this is something that, uh, producers do
When they don’t have the track copyrighted yet
Which I don’t have this one, um, under ASCAP yet
So, uh, waiting on this check to come through on Friday
So I can pay to get the, uh, these CDs published
So I can make some more beats probably tomorrow or whatever
So I’m just going to talk over the beat so y’all niggas can’t rip it off and all
So, um
So being this the last track of the mixtape and all
Hope you, you know, had fun
Hope you hit me up
Keep your ear out for me
Sign off
Yeah
