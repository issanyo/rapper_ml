[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
I've only been around for, like
Two and a half years, really, doing this music thing, but
I've been around long enough to be able to tell the ones
Who are actually serious about this
Than the ones who just think they serious about this
But I'm letting y'all know, though
I gave my life to this, brandUn DeShay

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
I feel like these rappers really dinner than me
Killing tracks, it's the sinner in me
I feel like it's another nigga living in me
How the hell I'm supposed to sleep when I'm living the dream?
Make tracks like that, rap infinitely
Funny thing: I'm not a rapper, coincidentally
Aw, let them hear that, of course they gonna hate
Niggas wouldn't crack a smile with a porcelain face
Finally blacking out like the pores on my face
It's important to wait, F that, I'm impa...tient
I've got to bring light to the truth
Like back to the booth, like back to the fu...ture
Church, apocalypse, hand full of pocket lint
I ain't got scratch, so I got to itch
Y'all dudes blowing money like you guys rich
No, y'all blowing money like y'all got a dick

[Chorus (4x): brandUn DeShay]
You think you're gonna get it, but I know I got it
I don't even got to be modest, honest

[Verse 2: Ev4n Holt]
Before I even started rapping, I was destined to be [?]
[?] just a bad emcee
Better than most of these niggas, don't compare them to me
Unless they sold a million records or a legend-to-be
But that ain't happening 'cause niggas barely make it to three
I talk a hundred and you niggas pushing units for free
I'm selling mines out the backpack
Where admirations in making millions and talking on the all-red Blackjack
But past that, I'm trying to be in the office
Calling my own shots, not a regular artist
Up in the big screen, looking like Denzel
You know who I am, bitch, I'm Mr. All Hail
This nigga made it from nothing, a dollar and a dream
And turning after the sun is harder than it seem
My heart is still in the gutter, I do it for my fam
So I whip and flip shit like a thousand eight grams

[Chorus (8x): brandUn DeShay]

[Sample (7x)]
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
