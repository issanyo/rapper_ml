[Chorus: Q-Tip (Sampled) & brandUn DeShay]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (for real)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (I know
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (for real)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (I know
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (you really got me, girl)
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (really got me, girl)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I ain't really trying to play no games, girl, you bomb as hell
Your outfit's stupid fly, that's blonde as hell
I can tell we got chemistry, we bonding well
And I ain't only trying to hit, Barry Bonds as well
But I'm a different kind of guy; we all got wings
He a bug, I'm a bird, that's a different kind of fly
I'm looking in your eye and I can see that you like it
Sixteen bars and I ain't even have to write this
Some things just inspire, you seem to have that effect on me
I know we gon' last 'cause you the best fo' me
Saved the best for last, I know you know the saying
Think of this as closed captioning, see what I'm saying?
Usually, it's how I can call it
I'm the tower of Pisa, it just seem like I'm falling in love
But A: awesome, B: beautiful, C: creative
D: Damn, girl, you all of the above, I swear

[Chorus: Q-Tip (Sampled) & brandUn DeShay]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (for real)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (I know
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (for real)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (I know
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (you really got me, girl)
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (really got me, girl)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Told her I make rap songs, it ain't just for the club
Real street shit, it ain't just for the thugs
She said she heard 25th and how different it was
And that it's cool I'm from the hood, but I be switching it up
I said, "Yeah, miss, plus I could rock the stage
And I would love to be your friend if you unblock your page"
Leimert Park nigga, all across the stage
So let me get that high-chest so I can watch you, dang
That "Hard Work" single, it get lots of play
Trying to get my pockets fat, baby, watch your weight
Hey Susan
I really hope I meet you in Houston, I'm hooping
I mean, balling
And every girl that I meet in New Orleans, while I'm touring
I adore them
But I only came here to see Morgan, or was it Jordan?
It's not important

[Chorus: Q-Tip (Sampled) & brandUn DeShay]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (for real)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (I know
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (for real)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (I know
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (you really got me, girl)
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (really got me, girl)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

[Verse 3: TiRon]
It's the... well, can't quite describe it
But I can't hide it, can't quite deny it, no
You know the feeling you be feeling
When you feeling them, they feeling you? Beautiful
Wait, I mean special unless you object
See, I only see as touching 'til we suffering, succotash
Roll another, puff and pass, bring the ashtray
And I wouldn't trade this moment for the cash, fame, fortune
Fast lane Porsches, so gorgeous, I'm adoring if you only had a portion
More addictive than snorting
More addictive than smoking
No, this is not a opus
I'm just open to everything she got and what she hoping for
And for the record, I'm more than what I was before I met her and no
No, I could never ignore
That's why I message her so she know I'm thinking 'bout her
Like how sweet it is to be loved by you

[Chorus: Q-Tip (Sampled) & brandUn DeShay]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (for real)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (I know
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (for real)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (I know
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (you really got me, girl)
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized (really got me, girl)
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
