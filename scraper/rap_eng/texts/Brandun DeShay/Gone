[Verse 1: Mega Ran]
I hope there's no epithets in my epitaph
Perpetually twenty minutes late I would get to class
Just in time for the second half
Usually asked about black lives
And forced to speak on their behalf
I was the only speck of chocolate
In a big bowl of the opposite
Bout as far from the hood as I could get
They called it culture shock but I actually thought it was kinda sick
My roommate was a rich kid
He majored in golf, really golf - he's making six figures
I learned a lotta' valuable stuff
Like one fifty one is some powerful stuff
Tried to stay felicitous, wound up ridiculous
Slovenly, idiot robbed of all my innocence
My credit is impotent, now I can't get rid of it
But looking back, yo I wouldn't change a bit of it

[Chorus: Mega Ran & Sammus]
When I had it
Couldn't stand it
Used to rush it
Now I want it
But it's gone now
Yeah it's gone now
It's all over
Or is it?

When I had it
Couldn't stand it
Used to rush it
Now I want it
But it's gone now
Yeah it's gone now
It's all over
Or is it?

[Verse 2: Sammus]
I stood out like an outie as a townie
Yeah I went to college in my county
It kinda got me down
Because the out-of-towners always tried to clown me
Talkin’ bout they problems with my town
Like I was present at the founding
Shooot I dreamt about when I could finally leave
Cuz in the Ivy League everybody tryna' be
The next Zuckerberg, Gates, Jobs
I prefer great times
Over my pay stubs
So I said bye to New York and Wall Street
But got bored and balls-deep
In my feelings about missing my porch and mom’s treats
Yeah the herbs is always greener on the other side
And it's the worst when you're a teen you think you gonna die
If you don't get what you want when you want it
You think you need a whip and apartment, a gin and a tonic
The only thing you need is a team to convene and a screen with some Sonic, got it?

[Chorus: Mega Ran]
When I had it
Couldn't stand it
Used to rush it
Now I want it
But it's gone now
Yeah it's gone now
It's all over
Or is it?

When I had it
Couldn't stand it
Used to rush it
Now I want it
But it's gone now
Yeah it's gone now
It's all over
Or is it?

When I had it
Couldn't stand it
Used to rush it
Now I want it
But it's gone now
Yeah it's gone now
It's all over
Or is it?
