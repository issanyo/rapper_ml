First off
I want to apologize for the shitty recording of this track
The recording booth I put up
Got totally destroyed
But it's all good
The mic still works, so we still in check
It's all right, though
It's the last track, anyway, so
You might actually get to hear your name
Because I really at least want to personally thank everybody
I wish I could get EVERY-everybody to listen to the tape
But that's just not possible
So, for the people who I know, who helped me from the last one
You know, in no particular order
I just want to, first off, thank:
