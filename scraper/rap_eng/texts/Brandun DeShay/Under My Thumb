[Chorus 1: Sample]
Under my thumb
The girl who once had me down

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
So, this is where the story all begins
Just like most, they started out as friends
Then things changed
It's like the more they talked, the more that he was on her brain
As the conversations got deeper
And the meetings more and more frequent
Then she seen that this could be more
When he caught her alone
She wondered where he'd been
Not your average boy meets girl
These two were too perfect to be strangers
More like it's Boy Meets World
And they were the real Cory and Topanga
It used to be down to him
The difference in the clothes he wears
Down to her, the changes come
Now she's got him under her thumb
He told himself that he would be more of a gentleman than usually
Cause he used to be more of an ass and get more ass but he'd end up losin', see?
And with her, there was no way she'd let that fly
Even though he was black and attacks would do it
There was no way he would let her pass by
All because of love, no need to ask why
I could sympathize for this guy
Cause it's like he only needed one big mistake
And the one that he chose to make:
Moving too slow when time's at stake
Didn't let her know how he felt for her
Didn't let him know how she felt for him
And the way he acted, none of her friends could understand how she felt for him, but
It was only a matter of time, she started to see things differently
The dumb things he did, the dumb things he said, and consciously killed what was meant to be
It was down to me - I mean him - but now she only says "Hi" whenever he does first
Now it's goin' in reverse, the changes come
But she still has him under her thumb
It's down to her, but that just means that
It's up to him to get things on track
No longer under her thumb
She belongs under my arm

[Chorus 2: Sample]
Under my thumb
Well I, I can still look at someone else

[Verse 2: Marty Herson]
I'm on the
Cool team, tool means
That you do me instead of doin' you
And it's seldom seen creativity
Comin' straight from you, no, please don't fool me
And if he wasn't so busy checkin' me
He would've known what was under my thumb
The detonation button to her soul and being
Just by switching my style up
I used to say "I thought..."
She would say "Aha, yeah, you thought like Nelly"
Nelly thought she was makin' them
But a-ha-haha, she was really makin' illy
Now I don't need to think cause I know I'm makin'
(?)
Hold up, let me count my ones
My fives, my tens, my hundreds
Niggas see why I plummet
And I land after flyin' coach
I know I steal my tow
Gucci bags, but this
Might get you arrested, cause I
Get it from A-rabs, from Abdul
And Aladdin, I'm baggin' myself up and
I'm laggin' in that steez department
They say, "Look how the teacher talkin', he gay!"
So go ahead and plug me, okay
Or you could just bump me a few grades
Up and I'll get up out of this place
And a few years later
Hollywood would state:
"Do you know your way to San Jose?"
No, damnit, still tryin' to find my way
Home, where I'm from, where I long to be
Hopefully the ears of the red carpet streets won't get a hold of me
Hopefully the ears of the red carpet streets won't get a hold of me
