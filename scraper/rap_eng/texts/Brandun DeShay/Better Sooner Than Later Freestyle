[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
I’m the best, man, I did it
Went from fronting with it to stunting like my diddy
The Big Willie, Fresh Prince of my city
So thanks, but I had to save face like big titties
But do you get the meaning? It’s not dictionary
I seen it, then I dreamed it like it’s Pictionary
Forgot it, I had to find it inside of my mind
Couldn’t recall like star sixty-nine, it’s fine
Far from powerful, but [?]
The weakest in the room often speaks the loudest
They used to say that my beats was crowded
Six bars ago, I was the prince, but now he’s crowned it
Kind of sounding like it wasn’t a word
But I couldn’t do what I do if I wasn’t a verb
Hip hop the caged bird and y’all couldn’t make it sing
The wings ain’t make you fly and the crown ain’t make you king
And that brown would make you seem like the ish
But I’m all about the real and y'all all about the dealing
No longer making tracks or making love, so tell me how it feel
So tell me how it feel

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
A J Dilla fan
Got dope like the dealer man
Got green like the dealer man
I’m off this like dealer man
I’m spinning like ceiling fans
No homo like Killa Cam
I’m feeling this feeling, man
It feels great
I feel like they can’t hate, they can’t touch me
The MC Hammer that’s not rusty
Michael Vick, I’m hawk, a stick that can’t rush me
Walk around the mall with a chick that’s so busty
She hot, so they acting up, they mad as uff
Plus my flow is like an aqueduct
If y’all ain’t notice something, I’m from the Chi
But I’m so far from the Chi, I’m more closer to modest
Plus all of the hoes, see I’m the hottest
But that don’t mean nothing, I’m in a Cavalier
With a chick that’s bad as Hell
She’s riding shotty like she the cartridges
I’m on top of the game like the cartridges
She a love fool like the Cardigans
I told her it’s over and now she say she want to start again
But I don’t sweat her like a Cardigan
Heaven or Hell, I wear it well
I'm ill
I’m ill
Billionaire, yeah
