[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
The old me don't even know me
It's crazy

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
It was a good run while it lasted, old life, see you
New life, hurry in, I can't wait to meet you
Say goodbye to my car, feel bad I gotta leave you
But face it, nobody looking cool in a Kia
Me, I can't wait to see zeroes after the one
I mean, damn, there's so many zeroes after the one
Never late, but you'll see me with the latest
I'ma get it in 'til I'm a synonym for greatness
To be crazy to think it's a possibility that I've fallen
The way that I'm stacking, I'm screaming out, "All in!"
For those who ain't watching, I told them all, "Watch out"
And somehow, I still get no credit, drop out
Threw my CD in the trash, I laugh
Now my CD on blast, I laugh
I really can't help but feel great
It is funny the ones that still hate still ain't

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
Good morning, good evening
Good night, nice seeing you
Goodbye, goodbye, sayonara
Goodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow
Good morning, good evening (I'll be gone)
Good night, nice seeing you (I'll be gone)
Goodbye, goodbye, sayonara
Goodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow... maybe

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Adiós, amigos, from the grown-ups to niños
They gon' be screaming, "DeShay!" like it's the new lingo
The lingo, I'll bet, but I'm feeling like a zillion dollar check
'Cause I'm the one, but I'm followed by bunch of zeroes
He goes only where no one has gone before
I'ma cut at the blood clot, my nigga, I'm gonna sore it
If that went over your head, I told you I was gonna soar
My wings stretched, now tell me, what I look like, walking?
God taught me everything without talking
And yet and still, I follow His advice like I'm stalking
It, but the bulk of it lies in what's underneath
I'm constantly on crack like I live under cleats
At the point of no return, I ain't come with receipts
I swear I heard it before like these niggas on repeat
I swear I heard it before like these niggas on repeat
Y'all fly, huh? Well, bring the whole fleet for the fee

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
Good morning, good evening
Good night, nice seeing you
Goodbye, goodbye, sayonara
Goodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow
Good morning, good evening (I'll be gone)
Good night, nice seeing you (I'll be gone)
Goodbye, goodbye, sayonara
Goodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow... maybe

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
(I'll be gone, I'll be gone)
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow... maybe
(I'll be gone, I'll be gone)
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow... maybe
