[Intro: Ace Hashimoto]
I hear ya baby, you ain't like all the others
When I’m near ya baby, feels like something of another world
Don't mind them ladies I ain't no Casanova (no, no)
But if you got time I’ll change your mind, I need to

[PreChorus]
It don't take years to find
That old fashioned kinda love
I doubt that we're defined by dotted lines
There's no fear in mind
Just the thought of you is all I do [?] we're divine
My kinda life

[Chorus]
Forever in the songs I sing
Wherever you may go I'll be
Whenever you feel lost I'll lead
In my happily ever after
You are my everything

[Verse: Kero One]
Everytime Im scrolling down my Instagram
They'll always be some guy who has the upper hand
But even though I know he got more money
More followers or stories that's more funny
I know I'm your king, you know you’re my queen
In our own world awake in a dream
And all of these jokes only we can laugh at
And all of your looks, got me shook, like an ass slap
#hashtag you so fine
You got my number you can count on me
‘Cause out of 10 your a 9, and girl i’m the 1 you need

[PreChorus]
It don't take years to find
That old fashioned kinda love
I doubt that we're defined by dotted lines
There's no fear in mind
Just the thought of you is all I do [?] we're divine
My kinda life

[Chorus]
Forever in the songs I sing
Wherever you may go I'll be
Whenever you feel lost I'll lead
In my happily ever after
You are my everything (You are my everything)
