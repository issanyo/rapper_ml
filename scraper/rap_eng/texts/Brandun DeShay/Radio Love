[Verse 1: Matt Martians]
Never thought I’d all be into her
This girl on this planet called Earth
It’s so crazy when I cut the radio on
All I hear is her voice
If she plays the music that make me
Feel like I’m in a whole another world
If she’s fake, then I’d be peeved
‘Cause to me, she’s somebody that’s so special
And if she does get on air
I’ma do something I have no control

[Hook: Matt Martians]
I’m in love with the girl on the radio
Something can’t be right
Every time I call to request a song
I get scared and just hang up

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Yo, I fell in love with the girl on the FM
I still can’t believe it’s true
My friends calling me lame, I’m like “F ‘em”
You’re like religion, I’m believing in you
And you ain’t even all talk like the AM
You told me not to turn that dial
I tune in from the P to the AM
You’re like Ma$e, I can’t turn you down
And when I hear your voice on the airwaves
Doing the top ten most requested
It feels more air rape
It’s like my eardrums get molested
You’re blessed, kid

[Hook: Matt Martians]
I’m in love with the girl on the radio
Something can’t be right
Every time I call to request a song
I get scared and just hang up

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
She started out spinning my tracks
And we ended up bending some backs
