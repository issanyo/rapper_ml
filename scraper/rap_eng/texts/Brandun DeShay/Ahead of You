[Intro : Von Pea]
On behalf of Tanya Morgan, we would like to remind you
Unapologetically

[Verse 1]
Killing shit is how I make a living
And I speak for the once and future
Life is cool baby let me introduce ya
We all man colors no hints of fuchsia
Well, maybe the back catalogs furniture
Some sat with it and some slept, the nerve of ya
I rap ridic and throw 'bows at burglars
Who stole all they know, No thanks im courteous
Im sitting on 20s
Now that I got your attention again, gimmie
Please don't be surprised they listen to slim Biggie
Why niggas be shocked we went in?
We ain't playing around with it, I ain't counterfeit
Get it they now with it, It was bound to hit
More than the prestige, more than a Presley
Morgan the best we, already in next week
Ahead of you

[Chorus]
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
Already in next week, ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you

[Verse 2]
Ready? Here we go
Let's see if they follow the flow
I'm growing into what im fitted for
Fitted up, been in war
By the time they see im one of the best, I did it all
Wait I take it back, back to the o.p
Letting other brothers win, they need the dream
Let em see how it feels and build esteem
But get it now, one day ill seal the seams
Win the vote then build the moat
Reinstill the hopes of skilled approach
I'm Spike Lee with a 5D
Screaming you ain't gotta like me
We ain't playing around with it
I ain't counterfeit
Get it they now with it
It was bound to hit
More than the prestige
More than a Presley
Morgan the best she's already in next week
Ahead of you

[Chorus]
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
Already in next week, ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you
(On and on and three steps) ahead of you

[Outro]
Killing shit is how I make a living, bitch
(On and on and three steps)
(On and on and three steps)
(On and on and three steps)
(On and on and three steps)
