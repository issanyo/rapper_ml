[Verse 1]
It's the newly inaugurated hardly hated
Everybody love a player
Barbecue, Filet Mignon, Scallops on top player
Let's say a small prayer
Keep my cool Grey's greyer
My pool water's bluer
You just a captain save a Girl
What's up, what's the dilly?
I seen you feelin me at a couple shows
Cup a cup of that Rose mo
Next thing you know you comin out yo shell
See you can get comfortable
Just make yourself at home
Mi casa su casa
Don't worry bout the dishes baby
I can be Mufasa, you can be the Ms
I hate cats, but I can kiss your kitty
If you clip the whiskers
And we smoke that speaker system (Boom)
Aka that super loud
Dr. Dre and 50 had they time
You the future now
I'm just a fan of you
I'm handin you the mic girl
Hop on this bed and sing into it if you like girl
Sound check your vocals
Blowin up, you goin global from this room
Never local soundin like the house of [?]

[Hook]
You dealing with the man girl
Naw I ain't no Goofy
I know you just a fan girl
I know you ain't no groupie
We can switch roles
And you can be a star
If you don't get stagefright
When you performin with them stagelights
And you know my bed is the stage right?
No time to be polite
Get it girl take a bite, Alright
You know my bed is the stage right?
So spend a night or you can exit
Stage right

[Verse 2]
Ay, you havin fun ain't you?
Yo body talkin to me and conversation's great too
You at the club cause yo home girl's major
They say that you always workin
But tonight you a different person
You feelin free and you thinking
This must be more than that drink
Cause everytime that you blink
You gettin hotter lookin
Hopefully me and you can lock eyes
And I'm the right guy
"If I wasn't such a lady
I would give it to you right now"
That's what she said
But I was dead after that one though
I'm ready to go, r√°pido
So pull the car around
You think I'm on some star shit
But it's the other way around
I want your autograph and poster
A t-shirt (Get one)
If first course this good
Then I wonder what's for Dessert (I Wonder)
Got me standin in line waitin for seconds
Like me first
He on that sweet shit, G Levert, Keith Sweat
And Kells flow
But let me sit back and enjoy the show
