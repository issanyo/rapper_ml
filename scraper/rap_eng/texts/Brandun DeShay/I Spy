[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Now!
BrandUn DeShay, you’re hearing the soul clap
‘Cause most of the ish you’re hearing is so wack
You signed this guy? Your hearing is so wack
I’m doper than the heroin addicts on crack
Carry you on my back, got the whole Chi-town
City of 808s, got the love lockdown
Starting to feel right now, about time now
Only in my mind, but I’m on my way right now
See the place where I need to be
A vacay, catch waves like frequencies
And Mayday make beats quite easily
But they fade, they say there’s a beast in me
And you might make tracks quite decently
But my flow is dope increasingly
I’m straight, there’ll be no crease in me
But at least not feasibly
I know, I know

[Chorus: Tommy Parker & brandUn DeShay]
‘Cause I don’t know where else I need to go
No more further ado, from you to yours, I present to you
‘Cause I don’t know where else I need to go
No more further ado, from you to yours, I present to you
Go, go, go

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
Mike check, one, two, one, two
Grab your ladies, grab your crew
Don’t see how I rock this party right?
Y’all must be blind, I’m out of sight
Or out your minds, I must be right
Like Williams’ sons, I must be hype
Like polo shirts, I must be tight
Every time I rock the mic
That’s every time the world spins
I’m nuttier than squirrel ish
I know she ain’t a gymnast
But this track make your girl flip
I’m rhyming slow
So you catch my rhymes like the common cold
That gangsta ish is kinda old
Screw getting shot, let’s get some dough

[Chorus: Tommy Parker & brandUn DeShay]
‘Cause I don’t know where else I need to go
No more further ado, from you to yours, I present to you
‘Cause I don’t know where else I need to go
No more further ado, from you to yours, I present to you
Go, go, go
‘Cause I don’t know where else I need to go
No more further ado, from you to yours, I present to you
‘Cause I don’t know where else I need to go
No more further ado, from you to yours, I present to you
Go, go, go

[Bridge: brandUn DeShay]
Break it down
Break it down
Drums

[Chorus: Tommy Parker]
‘Cause I don’t know where else I need to go
‘Cause I don’t know where else I need to go
Go, go, go

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Stop
