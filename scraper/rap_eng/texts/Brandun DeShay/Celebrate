[Verse 1]
Thoughts of failure leave me more than shook
Desperation, yeah I know the look
Searchin' my soul within' every nook
Talkin' faith, I coulda' wrote the book
In the kitchen like I know the cook
I swear it, but this is what arrogance is
Aware I'm a wiz
Stick to the shit til' I'm getting toupee'd like I'm wearin' a wig
Fuck is ya'll niggas fightin' for
Champion like the Final Four
These fans be actin' like they found the Lord
You fools, this ain't even my final form
Turnin' up on you on every song
You sleepin', my GLO game is very strong
Bringin' them hits like I'm Barry Bonds
I'm milkin' the game like a dairy farm

[Hook]
Celebrate like a champion
We celebrate like a championship
Celebrate like a champion
We celebrate like a championship
Celebrate like a champion
We celebrate like a championship
Celebrate like a champion

[Verse 2]
Shh!
Kindly get off of my nuts
You niggas annoying as fuck
Worrying about what I'm doing, about who I'm screwing
It's apparent your movement is not moving
On the day I collect all the Dragonballs
All I'mma wish is a nigga would
And drama ain't rare, we done had 'em all
So watch it, fore' get your dad involved
Takin' a flick and I'm taggin' your bitch on the rag
Oh, you mad cause you flaggin' my shit
In the the party, you know I be swaggin' my fit
You impressed well just try not to brag on my clique
All my brothers who I built the dynasty with
Your bullshit be makin' my sinuses itch
Each morning I'm up tryna' find me a lick
Been patient, I know
Man, this time, this is it

[Hook]
Celebrate like a champion
We celebrate like a championship
Celebrate like a champion
We celebrate like a championship
Celebrate like a champion

Uh, huh, here we go
Celebrate like you on a roll
Celebrate like the money comin'
Celebrate like you comin' home

Celebrate like a champion

[Verse 3]
Uh, got the crack to make the fiends wait
Started this year on a clean slate
So gimme a dinner with Kendall Jenner
I'm like "God, I'm ready for my dream date!"
Fans fienin', I'mma let 'em wait
Doin' me, time to meditate
Been at the bottom, had to elevate
We all good, time to celebrate
I ain't fuck around like I'm celibate
Walk around feelin' hella' great
It's been 4 years since your last tape
Yeah I know nigga, I was hella' late
Be Deshay, be the man cause
He the real brand that the fans trust
So even if they try to ban us
They'll never ever slow my bands up
Let's celebrate!

[Outro]
Even though niggas finna hate
Focus on your own dinner plate
Blessings coming not a minute late
I know I'm shinin' cause I see the shade
I'm just focusing on gettin' paid
Dreams of standin' on the center stage
Lord knows it done been a wait
Now it's time for me to celebrate

Celebrate like a champion
We celebrate like a champion
We celebrate like a champion
We celebrate like a championship
Yeah, let's celebrate
