[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
This is about, like...
As classic hip-hop as it gets for my era and shit
You know
I'm gonna do some real shit on this one
Take a little breather
It's a true story
I learned my lesson
I'm sorry

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
There must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
I steady run through my mind, but shorter than finish line
What they fail to realize is I'm not that kind of guy
So I try to feed them lies when I look them in their eyes
Compliment them on their size, tell them I'm on the rise
Working with Kanye, Lupe, and Do or Die
Then tell them it's cool to rise, so why don't you come inside?
Then tell her I love her while lovemaking, then cum inside
Then later she let me drive inside her G35
Trying to come clean by telling her dirty lies
And telling her that she the shit, baby, you're native flies
Took her to expensive restaurants and made her buy
And somehow I made it by, funny she never tried
To ask for that cash that I owed her since last July
Trusting me as if I was the guy I idolized
And gave me more hype than a champion title fight
I guess there's more good women than men, percentage-wise
A lot of men get women because, really, they're killing time
I guess that's why a lot of girls say they ain't into guys
And focus on their view full-time to improvise

[Hook (2x): Sample]
We ball until we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
For the men who try to put your life in a vice
Pressuring you to get them implants and make you diet
Not saying it's not right, but do it at your time
Whenever you feeling that confident about your size
Because, baby, limit's the sky, you need to limit these guys
Shouldn't wear a disguise just to beat the truth in his eyes
He's going out every night? Try not to hold him tight
Especially if he ain't rolling right like loaded dice
Don't gotta give him fifty-thousand chances to show you right
Because honesty's the best policy, show you right
Love shouldn't be overpriced, shouldn't have to spend your life
Searching for something and end up with nothing, that's my advice
I guess there's more good women than men, percentage-wise
A lot of these guys making it hard to empathize
I guess that's why a lot of women say they get tired of guys
Guess we gotta lose them all first before realize

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Got niggas over here
Instant messaging me and shit
I'm trying to reminisce on my dark days and shit, whatever
They asking me about, "when the mixtape gonna drop?"
I'm still recording it and shit
It's all good, though
It's all good
Next...
