[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Ha, yeah
BrandUn DeShay
Volume: Two! For the Show
Listen

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
The dough I don’t got don’t mean squat like the Heisman
No violence to violins
Howdy-do? How are you? How high are you? I’m high as the stratosphere
Obviously the baddest here, this beat is a battlefield
And I’ve been praying for containment, how insane my brain gets
It’s more than entertainment like Cedric
Been doing everything a little bigger like Texas
And now I watch the pieces fall in place like Tetris
And now I watched you niggas fall from grace like [?]
And watched the stock plummet and watched you rise from it
The phoenix from the ashes, the teacher for the classes
The preacher for the masses, so lead them for the classless
Ali before the Cassius Clay, the champ without the belt
I made it to the ring with no help
Excuse me, you don’t got to choose me to win the title fight
But I’m gonna wear that championship belt so tight, damn right

[Chorus (2x): brandUn DeShay]
I’m finna go like the starting line
Let me show you looking at a star like a starting sign
Low-go, hold on, hold on
Got a hold on them, they can’t hold on

[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]
I’m next door like Mr. Feeny
Hoping that my skills open doors like Lamborghinis
Hoping to put my foot in the door, these niggas see me
Props to my moms and my pops and cousin Benny
‘Cause ever since a nigga was young and still teeny
Like everything they wished I’d become like I’m Jeannie
Y’all, you should’ve seen me at the Grammy’s
Only one album and the outcome? They was running out of awards that they can hand me
If that was called a dream, I live my life in jammies
‘Cause right now, no Super Bowl rings, my downs hand-me
So many thoughts run through my mind, I pulled a handy
And just as you guessed, I’m fresh, I pulled a Mannie
Damn, he done grown up so much
Used to didn’t cuss so much, but so what
These other rappers never switched gears, they so huff
I’m introducing who, where, when, and why ‘cause y’all know what

[Chorus (2x)]
