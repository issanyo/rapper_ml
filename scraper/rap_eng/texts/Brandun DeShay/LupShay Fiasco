[Intro: brandUn DeShay]
Yeah
We gonna keep it going
I'm over here losing my voice, but...
I still got a lot in me
You know?
Let's keep it going

[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Niggas with low expectations, it's easy to satisfy
Niggas with high expectations can't help to see the sky
Can't help but to see this guy, I'm shining like the light
At the end of the tunnel, my nigga, my hustle's Saint Peter's eye
Who need a ride? I'ma carpool to success
Or a harpoon to the chest to these hard dudes say they're next
And they clearly not, I'm next up, I got right now
Just turn them spotlights down, I'm shining bright right now
Well now, homie, I'm too hard, homie, you're too huff
All these plaques that I'ma have, I'ma need a toothbrush
Looking like a soldier, no crew cut, lace your boots up
Chicago made me stare hard, hard like Medusa
Now I'm used to them hood niggas and the ones siddity
Got me feeling like a windmill in this windy city
How pretty, you turned this disadvantage to advantage
Most of them couldn't manage, a toast to those who can handle it
Always knew I was special, why niggas was poking fun
I practiced my craft, now all my music's the smoking gun
I hope it's done in 2010 or be the genesis
Making love or making music, I'm just getting into it
Get into it

[Verse 2: Cameron Ryan]
If I could work but never shine, grind until the end is mine
I shine down on y'all, but y'all cursed, them forever blind
So who is this cooler kid on the course of cooler whips?
But he don't want the money, cars, clothes, or the groupie chicks
He just want one girl and the world to know the dude exist
He kicks down the door into the game, look how rude he is
That Midwest on my back, carry that heart on my sleeve
I just got one foot in the door, yet I'm trying to leave
Am I retiring? You know that pressure heavy
But still, I break these records like Katrina broke the levee
And I don't care if you spit fire because I ain't about to stop, drop, or roll over for no one
No, son
I won't stop a trap until my pocket rollers rotund
Watch me bring the game to a standstill as I slow run
Just like red light, red light, don't you see that red light?
They ain't saying stop when that red light is on your head, right?
What your bread like? If it don't stack up, pay it right
All them rhymes you previously spit just wasn't said right
You know I'm ill, though, but I ain't from that ill-go
And I ain't never shy, but these show that I will still hold
Down

[Outro: brandUn DeShay]
Down
Yeah
Cameron Ryan
Thank you for the tag team help, sir
You know I can't go the rest of this journey alone, so
Keep it moving
I don't even know what's next
All I know is...
Shit, I hope it's done soon
Man, I ain't gonna have no voice left by Christmas
