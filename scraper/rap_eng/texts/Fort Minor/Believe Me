[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

[Verse 1: Ryu]
I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like fun and games? Keep playing 'em
I'm just saying, think back then, you was like one of the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train

Just like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
And in your brain, like a maze you can never escape the rain
Every damn day is the same shade of grey

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hey, I use to have a little bit of plan
Use to have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right out of my hand
Now, I don't really even know who I am

Yo, what do I have to say?
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see
But it's not gonna happen with me

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me, unintentionally
That you would self destruct, eventually

Now, I'll be thinking like the mistake I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work 'cause it's really much worse
Than I thought, I wished you were something you were not
And now this guilt is really all that I got

[Verse 4: Tak]
You turn your back and walk away in shame
All you got is a memory of pain
Nothing makes sense and you stare at the ground
And hear my voice in your head when no one else is around

So what do I have to say?
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see
But it's not gonna happen to me

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
(I'll do what I have to do)
You're on your own now, believe me
(Whatever happens to you)
You're on your own now, believe me

(What do I have to say?)
You're on your own now, believe me
(Is not gonna happen with me)
You're on your own now, believe me
