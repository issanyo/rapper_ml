Y'all are not
Not re-ready
No
Not re-ready
No
We about to drop it steady
So
Do it like that
Do it like that

Now why's everybody so petrified?
What?
Petrified
What?
Step aside
And just drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!

Now why's everybody so petrified?
What?
Petrified
What?
Step aside
And just drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!

How you doing y'all
My name's Mike
I'm fluent with the new shit
I'm doing it all night
I like what I do
I do what I like
I can quit and get it back
Like I'm riding a bike
Like stop
Bring it back
Bring it back
We got that balance
Keeping us on track
That you get
When you're moving quick
With no slow
You stare like you don't care
But you do though
I know
You really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you're tough
But so phony
You and your boys
You don't know me
You really want to hold me
Show me homey
Let's get it over with for good
I got a friction addiction
I wish you would
Machine Shop rocking
When we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

Now why's everybody so petrified?
What?
Petrified
What?
Step aside
And just drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!

Listen
You are not ready
Like children and a building
You can't stand steady
It must be the beat so heavy
Causing panic attacks
Like a crack in the levy
Give you that Robert Plant
Dancing days are back
Feeling all in the track
And in fact
For those knowing the name
I'm back
With some brand new crack
We can do it like that
You really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you're tough
But so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really want to hold me
Show me homey
Tough talk doesn't mean a thing
Get over yourself
You know when we're up in the scene
It's Machine Shop rocking
When we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

Now why's everybody so petrified?
What?
Petrified
What?
Step aside
And just drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!

Now why's everybody so petrified?
What?
Petrified
What?
Step aside
And just drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!

Y'all are not
Not re-ready
No
Not re-ready

We about to drop it steady
So
Do it like that
Do it like that
Y'all are not
Not re-ready
No
Not re-ready
No
We about to drop it steady
So
Do it like that
Do it like that
Get up!

Now why's everybody so petrified?
What?
Petrified

Step aside
And just drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
Drop that
Come on!
