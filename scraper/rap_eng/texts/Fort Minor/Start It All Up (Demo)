Yo
Give me a second, I'll write about my pain for pages
I got a head full of frustrated phrases
So just bear with me as i get this out
You know the type of person that i'm talking about
These people who want to act like they've got your back
They never had your back, they just stab you in it
I never pretended i had it all together inside
I got insecurities and things that I'm trying to hide
And I could, never seem to get anything right
And I could, never seem to stop busting my fight
And I could, never seem to get it right with you
And I could, never redeem myself when i'm through
But sometimes, you know what? I just don't care
I'm gonna speak my mind and let everybody stare
This is the last time, I'm telling you real loud
You wanna tell me I'm wrong? let's do it right now

Start it all up, I'm ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got
Start it all up, I'm ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got

Give me a minute, I'll fill a newspaper with collumns
'cuz people saying that I got an additude problem
That I'm negative when I rhyme, I complain
Pessimistic all the time, in these lines
All the same, I just talk like this on a record and let it out
I just, cock back and let it all come flooding out
I just, say the things that I know I feel are real
I peel back the kin 'till the nerves reveal
You want to come with me? come closer to the speaker
You want to run with me? you're gonna have to dig deeper
You wanna let it all out, I'll show you how
You wanna tell me I'm wrong?, we can do it right now

Start it all up, I'm ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got
Start it all up, I'm ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got

Mike Shinoda
The most ferocious
Mike Shinoda
With or without an accomplice

Mike Shinoda
The most ferocious
Mike Shinoda

Start it all up, I'm ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got
Start it all up, I'm ready to go
All I need is a signal just to let me know
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got
