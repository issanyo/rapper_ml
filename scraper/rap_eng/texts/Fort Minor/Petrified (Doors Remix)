No-no-no-not not re-re-ready yo!
Not re-re-ready yo!
We 'bout to drop it steady, yo!
So do it like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that

Now why is everybody so petrified?
(What!)

Step aside
And just drop that
(Come on!)
Drop that

Yeah
How you doin', y'all?
My name's Mike
I'm fooling with the new shit
I'm doing it all night
I like what i do
I do what i like
I could quit and get it back like i'm riding a bike
Like stop
Bring it back
Bring it back

We got that balance keeping us on track
That ya' get when 'ya movin quick, with no slow
You stare like you don't care
But you do it though i know

I know
You really must be so lonely
Puffed up, lookin' tough, but so phony
You and your boys, you don't know me
You really wanna hole me? show me, homie

Lets get it over with for good
I got a friction addiction i wish you would
Machine shop rockin' when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

Now why is everybody so petrified?
(What!)
Petrified?
(What!)
Step aside
And just drop that
(Come on!)
Drop that
(Come on!)
Drop that
(Come on!)
Drop that
(Come on!)

Listen you are not ready
Like children in a building you can't stand steady
It must be the beat so heavy
Cos i'm panic attacks like a crack in the levy

Give you that Robert Plant
Dancing days are back
Feeling all in the track an' in fact
For those knowing the name
I'm back with some brand new crack
You can do it like that

You really must be so lonely
Puffed up, lookin' tough, but so phony
You and your boys, you don't know me
You really wanna hole me?
Show me, homie

Tough talk doesn't mean a thing
You know yourself you know when we're up in a scene
Its machine shop rockin' when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

Now why is everybody so petrified?
(What!)
Petrified?
(What!)
Step aside
And just drop that
(Come on!)
Drop that
(Come on!)
Drop that
