{The dude, he said, that, like, when we were making
The first Linkin Park record, he was like
"Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like
I don't know if it's maybe you should just be a rock band"
You know what I mean, like, trying to change us
Like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then he's like
"Oh, I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard"}
Before the first song that you heard me on
There were people already tryin' to get me gone
Tellin' me to quit rapping, just play the keys
That my band had a singer, they didn't need me
But my band had my back, so we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first but then the humor faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were to be good to be true, some were saying ghost
Writers were writin' all that we do, so we had to disprove it
We spelled it out to the detail, how we do it when we're makin'
This music, after that I made it a rule
I only do e-mail responses to print interviews
Because these people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said, something, fuckin' absurd
Oh, did I lose you at infer?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words
People used to infer that we were manufactured
Now, I've got the interviews on file which people said
"What, which number to dial?"
So now every enemy screaming insanity
All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me, bitch
{You believe that? Like, that's crazy, sounds crazy, right
You're like this point, at this point you figure, you hear that
And you're like, "That guy is out of his mind"
But honestly at that point, besides the fact that he wanted me
To just play keyboard, or whatever, he didn't want me rap
He was like, "Maybe Joe Hahn should, um, wear a lab coat
And a cowboy hat on, it's like when we play, I swear to God he's crazy
It was crazy", What's goin' on with the cowboy hat? Yeah
And later on he claimed that he wrote our all our songs
So that was, that was real nice}
