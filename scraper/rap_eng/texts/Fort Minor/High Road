[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Let's go, ya'll

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
These people are running off at the mouth
Trying to convince me that I'm running on empty
Trying to convince themselves
That the record with Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm making is a mistake
And I can't take this

Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks, I take facts and lay them out for the masses

You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playing
Start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying to be bigger than the bickering
Bigger than the petty name calling, under-the-breath talking

Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor, no patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away (bitches)

[Chorus: John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
You people are running off at the mouth
Trying to make me take myself off safety
Trying to make my friends turn their backs
On the team we built
Building up some mistaken information
And I can't take this

Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complain about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintaining my name, the same way I came up

You're gonna see that I'm not playing And Start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying not to mention the names of people
Who wanna siphon attention, you like the hype

But pretending you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout, no class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away, bitch

[Chorus: John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today

[Bridge: John Legend]
Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to breathe, breathe, breathe

Is anybody out there, listening?
'Cause I can't stand to keep this in
All I really want, I'll say it again, yeah, yeah
(Like that)

[Chorus: John Legend]
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today
