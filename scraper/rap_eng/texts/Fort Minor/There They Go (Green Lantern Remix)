Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, pleased to meet you
I go by the name of Sixx John
Of course you know Mike Shinoda
Yeah, uh oh, West Coast, let's go

One time
For my Machine Shop crew
And then it's two times
S.O.B. and L.P. too
And then it's three times
It's Mike and Sixx on the track
And then four times
When we come in through the back they're saying

Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go
Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go

Dangerous bitch, ya can't really hang with us and this
Everybody's so afraid of us, shit
Makes me wanna hang it up and quit
Dangerous bitch, ya can't really hang with us
Dangerous bitch, ya can't really hang with us and this
Everybody's so afraid of us, shit
Makes me wanna hang it up and quit
Forget about all the things you heard before
'Bout time that we're kicking down your door
Everybody's gonna hit the fuckin' floor
Please Mike don't hurt me anymore
I don't gotta have a secret lie or an alibi
Everybody knows why I'm here
Not just for some crack, get a bottle
Let's crack you over the head with a bottle of beer
So just listen up there powder-puff
Better believe that I'm not playing
You can love it, you can hate
But don't mistake it, everybody's saying

Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go
Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go

What you really wanna do is this
Just make believe that I don't exist
But you won't cause everytime you go to spit (Yo, check this)
I talk over you just like this (Shit)
It's annoying just for you
You could scream all day 'til your face is blue
I'm getting in your head and you know it too
And that's just me you don't know my crew (Machine Shop)
My man Sixx John understand though
The way that he flows, you can call him Rambo
Never missed a shot, never run outta ammo
Come out wit' heat like a goddamned commando
And add in S.O.B., Ryu, Tak, Vin Skully
Cheapshot and now you see, fuck with me? Nah, Sixx!

Oh no, uh oh, whatever you get when you see that door closed
I'm a bail through the back straight to the bar so I can act a fool
I figured you guys would get a little surprise
Your eyes wide when it's me and Mike Shinod'
I'm just plain ol Sixx John from the Nam district
This is not supposed, I still talk with awkward speech
I'm like a dog that's off his leash
Step out with a Fort Minor patch on a black tee
Niggas scared to walk these streets, I ain't trippin homie
Talk is cheap, acapella or we can walk on a beat
And if that ain't enough action
I got seventeen pages in this little magazine I keep

We got this place rocking beat knocking, non stoppin'
If ya'll all with it let me hear it now, yeah, yo
We got this place rocking beat knocking, non stoppin'
If ya'll all with it let me hear it now, yeah, yo

One time
For my Machine Shop crew
And then it's two times
S.O.B. and L.P. too
And then it's three times
It's Mike and Sixx on the track
And then four times
We do it like that, like that, like that, like that

Fort Minor
Better be ridiculous, how sick is this
Mike Shinoda
Better be ridiculous, how sick is this
Machine Shop
Better be ridiculous, how sick is this
Green Lantern
Better be ridiculous, you, you see him
