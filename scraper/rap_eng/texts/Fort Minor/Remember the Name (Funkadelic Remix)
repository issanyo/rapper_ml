You ready?!
Let's go!
Yeah!
For those of you that want to know what we're all about
It's like this y'all, come on!

This is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
And a 100% reason
To remember the name

Mike!
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard
Whether it's the beat or the mike
He feels so unlike
Everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact
That some people still think
That they know him
But fuck them
He knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality
And making some noise
Making the story
Making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down
Tak's picking it up
Let's go!

Who the hell is he anyway
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status
But still leaving them star struck
Humbled through opportunities
Given to him despite the fact
That many misjudge him
Because he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself
Now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help
Or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote
His will is beyond reach
And now when it all unfolds
The skill of an artist

It's just 20% skill
80% beer
Be 100% clear
Because Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that
He'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wrecking with
The Crystal Method's "Name of the Game"
Came back dropped Megadef
Took them to church
I like "Bleach" man
Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth
Now everybody be giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof
I heard he fucking with S Dot

This is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
And a 100% reason
To remember the name

They call him Ryu the Sick
And he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
Been a fucking an nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type woman want to be with
And rappers hope he get shot
8 years in the making
Patiently waiting to blow
Now the record with
Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime
His shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit
That comes out of this kid's throat

Tak!
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Making his way to the top
People think its a common owners name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym? No
He's living proof
Got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doing
Give a 100%

Forget Mike
Nobody really knows how or why
He works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note
And he writes every line
And I've seen him at work
When that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design
Is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key
Or speaks in a rhyme
And those mother fuckers he runs with
Those kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying
How do they do it

This is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
And a 100% reason
To remember the name
