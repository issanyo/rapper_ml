[Verse 1]
Coming to you live and direct from the town
It's the HideandSeekZoo
And I'm here to hold it down
Underground, it's the sound coming from the lost and found
Bet you've never seen a cat like me 'til now
Let's keep it brief
From a fan of the small talk
You better get to the point or I'll walk
It's all the same, and it's all in the game
I've been here for a while, but forgot why I came

[Verse 2]
Are you a dumb fuck with dumb luck
A copyrighted fuck up
Like what's up
Pack it like a dump truck
[?]
I'm the nicest, all show with no surprises
See my videos on your mobile devices
Wrote this out waiting for my cup of noodles
It's the HideandSeekZoo you can search me on the Googles
Flow kinda neat on these ill sounding beat
You can beat it on repeat and turn it loud until I'm in your street
Yeah yeah you can beat it on repeat and turn it loud until I'm in your street
'Til I'm in your street

[Verse 3]
Yo I'm taking a break on the syllables
[?] one, smoking a blunt, don't even front
Call you a cunt, I'm here to kick like a punt
I'm reaching different steaks, different food on my plate
And I'm living everyday not giving a fuck of what you say
And that's a fact, spit it in a rap, break it apart, bringing it back
And all these cats whack with all the shit that they lack
Yo, and that's the way it's gonna go
It's the HideandSeek Z double O
So spit a couple flows for those who don't know
I write a couple raps and do more than smoke dro
I do it all the time but I keep it on the low
But I still get around like these Vacaville hoes
Woah, that's a little too far
But so are these gangbangers that act so hard
I flow kinda neat on these ill sounding beat
You can beat it on repeat and turn it loud 'til I'm in your street
Yeah yeah you can beat it on repeat and turn it loud until I'm in your street, motherfucker
It's the HideandSeekZoo

[Verse 4]
Yo, I'm a true stoner, smoking marijuona
Put you in a coma in the middle of Oklahmoa
On the way to Gerardo's, first the Wells Fargo
Pull up to his crib like, "Get in the car, hoe"
I think I smoked my very first blunt when I was thirteen
My piss was dirt clean
Now I smoke the purp and greens
Never fuck with lean but I go green behind the scene, if you know what I mean, word
