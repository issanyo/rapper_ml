Yeah doe yeah doe
For the 19-95
This is young Ray Luv
Representin'
Got my L's held high
Aha
And the game dont stop
And the game dont quit
He he ha ha
And it goes a lil something like this

[Verse 1: Ray Luv]
Up a tree up a tree up a tree
Won't you take a ride with me
Mr. L-U-V up on Atlantic, Y-B-B
I got more chips than Doritos
I'm incognito, way too clean
I bet you never seen a
Rappin' misdemeanor
Got that game for your brain
Tape in your deck in your ride
Trying to soak up every word
Finna wreck, stay rewind
And got em sprung off the tongue
Thought you knew this game don't quit
Twenty-four forever hustlin'
I just keep on grindin' hits
Fiend for chips
Geared to get
Represent and uplift
Never trick never switch
Link Crew for the 90's bitch
Pop n' flip got the grip
Stay about yo mail young pimp
Watch out cause them gangsta hits
Possesses like The Exorcist
Get next to this leather
Even through the stormy weather
I prevail makin' mail cause I'm
Way too clever
My endeavor is to flip a meal ticket
And have you zap the young Ray Luv
When you kick it

[Chorus: Ray Luv & Mr. Gigalo]
Mr. Gigalo givin' mo'
Game than you can follow
Stickin' to the script servin' them hollows, haters swallow
Your prideAnd your girlie ride with Big Eddie
Cause I would do the same trick
I'm all about the fetti

[Hook: Ray Luv]
Take a ride with the Luvva Man
Take a ride with the Luvva Man
Ride with the Luvva Man
Take a ride with the Luvva Man
Take a ride with the Luvva Man
Ride with the Luvva Man

[Verse 2: Ray Luv]
Comin wit' it though
Givin mo'
Game that you livin fo'
Fresh up out of ninety-fo'
In the deuce triple-O
Can't nothin' stop this mackin' no
I'm taking what I'm lacking cause
Money motivates my mind when I'm stackin'
Got it crackin' like a street corner
I envision Ray Luv bustin' raps on a
Television rip a niche up in this rap game
Like an incision
Roll the dice like a crap game
Money's the mission
I just flip the game tell you all what happened to me
Tape in your deck and Mr. Luv up in the passenger seat
Bumpin' and blastin' the beat
That's what they lovin' from me
Why ain't they buying your tapes?
You ain't in touch with the street
You must be blind and can't see
I'm what you trying to be
They pop eject on your record
They push rewind when I speak
I take em high as a rocket
Mr. Dark Chocolate
I'm the man, fifty grand got two in my pocket
Thought you knew when I shocked that
I would blow up
Grew up with ballers a baby couldn't wait to grow up
About to sew up
The industry
Remember me
I got my eyes on the prize take a ride with the L-U-V

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Ray Luv]
I'm so cool call me Coolio
Cause when I hit the studio
The voyage is fantastic
Player haters drastically
Envious and jealous
That's what they hoes tell us
When they choosin'
That's why a dirty mack is always losin'
I'm cruisin' on Trues and
Vogues with the gold stripe
Folding bank roll from the hole in my windpipe
It's the Luvva Man baby you don't understand
Representin' once again, L-C to the end
Young hustlas international crack smugglers
Game jugglers
North Bay ballin' bubblers
Brother the game gets sticky like a Zig-Zag
Tricky player in fact
It's hard to keep it intact
At times you might think you gonna lose your mind
Just push rewind and soak the game up out of every line
And you gone find a young soldier back against the wall
In the game makin' mail off of all of y'all

[Chorus]

[Hook 4x]

Take a ride
