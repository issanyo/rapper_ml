[Scratched Intro]
("Here's a little story I got to tell")

[Verse 1]
Straight from the streets and the alleys of Cali, mo'
Hits and bits from the depths of the Vallejo
The highs to mids, here's a kid from the Rosetown
Nigga Ray Luv is at this with the dope sound
(Here to tell you a tale about a man and his money)
Young brother straight broke, ain't a damn thing funny
Girlies had stripes, Dickies slacks is how the macks stroll
Gold when he flex, his Rolex when he roll
Oh, damn how I wanted to live large
Private jet lease when Ray Luv is in charge
Hard is how I live my life
Thank God I never smoked the pipe
I need money, streets can't last me
And keep a eye out for brothers tryna blast, G
And in the past, I never planned on seein' the pen
It was a place I knew I never wanted to be in, my friend
I'ma clock, I knew it down deep in my heart
Hoes jock, I'ma do it 'cause I'm down from the start
I'm serious 'bout mine, more than just the same ol' song
'Cause I'm in there, and I'm out to get my money on

[Chorus]
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
Yeah, my money on
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
I'm out to get ma money on
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
My money on
(Check this out...)

[Verse 2]
1991 - the year Ray changed up
1992 - the year Ray Luv came up
I been around, now I'm headed to the top, player
Knowledge from Jah, but a street rhyme-sayer
Anyway, back to my struggle and my hustle
If you ain't got no clout or grip, you ain't got no muscle
I do not be the one, call me Mr. Assed-Out
Niggas planned to do me so I packed 'em and mashed out
Grandma's tryin' to keep me out the streets 'cause they after me
But she don't understand where I'm at, see
You know I, I pack a pistol when I hang, so out-run him
And if they pull a ho move, I won't hesitate to gun 'em
Goddamn! I'm mo' broke than I ever been
Rock bottom's new to me 'cause it's a place I've never been
My ace boon's locked up in a jail dome
Now my gat's got my back while I get my mail on
Daily I get calls from the P.D
Around the clock jockin' ass Santa Rosa police
Real about mine, more than just the same ol' song
'Cause I'm in there, and I'm out to get my money on

[Chorus]
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
Out to get my money on
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
Yeah, my money on
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
I'm out to get my money on
("Here's a little story I got to tell")

[Verse 3]
Now in '92, black, I'm back up on the scene
They know me in the Bay, now nationwide I'm stackin green
Cash M-O-N-E-Y, just wanted to make it
Never really had much but always used to fake it
Hung with the boys slangin' D, but no time for it
God had graced a plan for me and now in 1992 I know it
Police always sweat me: "Why do you gots a pager?
Where did you get this money, Mr. Young Black Teenager?"
Got it from your daughter, she came to my concert
Making my record platinum, wearing a Ray Luv t-shirt
Blame somebody, blame yourself
'Cause you give her the money, and she give it to somebody else
Me - now it's in my bank account
So Mr. Five-O, here's something to think about
And to you brothers, who used to talk drag when they see me
Now you wanna be me on 'MTV
Raps', the young black mack with the video
Kick it with the boys from the Rose, but you don't hear me though
On West 9th I began to strive
But I learned to be a playa in the 415
I used to dream of C.C.'s and Impalas
Now I want a Benz and ends to spend dollars
Yeah, 'cause I'm out to get my money on

[Chorus]
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
Yeah, ha ha, I'm out to get my money on
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
You know what, I'm out to get my money on
("Here's a little story I got to tell")
My money on
("Here's a little story I got to tell")

[Outro]
