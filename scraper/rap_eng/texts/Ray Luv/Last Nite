Drop that mang, drop that
Yeah doe
For the 1-99-5 ha ha
Last night
Yeah doe

Last night
Something about the sky being overcast
And the doja had me thinkin about times past
Let me see, when was it all cool?
April 15th, 1972
That's when Izza gave birth to me
And life gave the whole damn Earth to me
And everything was a struggle
Coz life ain't nathan but a hustle
I guess you could say I was raised on good rhymes
Corned rows, collared greens and episodes of Good Times
In the ghetto was the place to be for me
My moms yellin coz I'm never where I'm supposed to be
Out hanging with the big kids
When I shoulda stayed home like the rest of the tricks did
Coz an ass whuppin was vicious
But nowadays playa thats the things that I miss
Hanging out at the candy store after school
Waiting on the route 5 bus trying to be cool
Once in it's on to the back
To get your clown on with the rest of the baby macks
Guess it was then my love for music came about
Coz Earth Wind and Fire was gettin much play at my house
Take a blast to the past, right?
The dank took me there last night

Last night I lay in my bed (it don't quit y'all)
I took a trip on the other side (it don't quit y'all)
And I seen things I haven't seen (it don't quit y'all)
In a very very long time
Ah, ah, ah

Saturday afternoon
I'm on my way to the barbeque
Don't act twelve because it's only 2 [?]
Ain't seen most of my homies in ages
Now they all married and run around with babies
But it still feels real good
Coz back in the day we used to run our neighborhood
Snuck in the city pool
Ran around like a gang of fools
Lunch time, cut school
Head straight to the mall where the game's played
And I'd hook up with my crew at the arcade
Leanin on the wall, broke, took my first smoke
Of a Newport and I damn near choked
My ganddaddy used to tell me about the old days
Right before he passed away
When everybody kept they doors unlocked
And a neighborhood fight didn't mean getting shot
Broke as hell but really didn't matter about Christmas time
Coz they did what they had to to get me mine
I knew right then I had to find a way to
Get my money on coz I wanted to be a playa
At night I used to sneak on the late creep
Out my room window when mom and pops was asleep
On my way to go kick it
The days of a young G oh how I miss it
Coming up was my daydream
And to wear gold braids like my man on the A-Team
I looked deep into my past life
The dank took me there last night

It don't quit y'all (repeat through chorus)

[Hook]

Let's take a trip to the lake if you will
Shine up the gold ones I got a little time to kill
Hear the sounds of a dog bark
And it brings back the memories of days in the South Park
A few of the homies I grew up around
Is in the ground
Or locked down I guess that's why they don't come around
But I'll never let it kill me
Coz things are gonna get a little bit... (easier) feel me?
Early on in the game we was struggling
Rappin till I come up, full time hustling
But things done changed around this way
Lounge all day with some dank and Tangueray
Let's hit the freeway homie
Coz I just got my 350 tighted up an OB
Hit 580 like we used to
Back in '89 activators by the Juice Crew
I keep in touch just as much as I age
When I travel still reached by the beeps of my Skypager
Take a look to the past, fight
Yo Grimm we smoked about a quarter pound... [Mr Grimm] (last night, ha ha ha!)

It don't quit y'all (repeat until fade)

[Hook until fade]
