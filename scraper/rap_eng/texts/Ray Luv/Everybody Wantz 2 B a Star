I'm gon' do my thing

[ Chorus ]
Everybody wants to be a star
And live it up in California with the cleanest cars
Hot tub, fast women, pull baddest broads
Everybody got the same dream to have it all
Well I know that everybody wants to be the one
To get to blow the most dough and have the biggest fun
Space age cowboy with the biggest gun
Pop life in the spotlight - get you some
(Well I know)

Everybody wants to play the game
Get paid with fame, wrist lit, neck stay with chains
Porno flicks chicks, everybody callin yo name
Old friends done changed, hatin how you ball in the game
Video sets, Summer Jam, video sex
Radio shows, royalty checks, designer clothes
Rolls Royce with the suicide do's
The only dream you and I know
The promised land - ready to go?
Livin your life the way you always wanted to live it
MTV Cribs, Lamborghini without a blemish
Mr. Right Now, number one without a gimmick
Poised to perpetual ballin, nigga, without no finish
Bet you wanna see your face on the cover of a Rolling Stone
Or in the Source mag holdin a chrome
Tyra Banks tryin to blow up the phone
Can't even get in your house, player, teeny boppers surrounded your home
You know?

[ Chorus ]

Rent-A-Cop, fashion shows, TV spots
Got papparazzi chasin your Benz for blocks
With your and your friends shot, ( ? ) pop
Top-notch livin life on runways and movie lots
(Ooh, she hot) Even women be gettin they coochie hot
When they see you on Rodeo chargin the big mail
Attention, Fendi, Prada, Chanel
Dolce Gabana, pretty face for sale
You know

[ Chorus (2X) ]

What better way for you to get mo' fame, see mo' pay
First round draft NBA (But can he play?)
Shoot jays and fadeaways all day
Jokin with Ahmad, Rashad at the end of the game
You're livin the high life, ESPN highlights
Get checks of a fly type, sex with a fly wife
(I wish it was my life!) True, I bet that you do
And if was, nobody probably have it better than you
And almost no one had mo' cheddar than you
Mo' Gucci Coogi sweaters than you
Mo' hoochie groupie letters than you
If not this, then what else would you do?
(Push crack rock or yak or try to work fast food)
Don't make me laugh, dude
I'd rather go dancin at the Playboy Mansion
With June and July, gettin high with Marilyn Manson
No lie, you know that it's true
Which one are you, the wanna-be-a-star-too
And have your own car too
You know what I mean?

[ Chorus (2X) ]

Yeah though
It's that Westside
Straight up out the Lleyo
Link Crew Hustlers
Fem Diggle
Ray Luv
I'm doin it big
Like my little brother Mitch
That's how we doin it for 2K3
And we out
See ya
