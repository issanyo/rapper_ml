Deeper in the abyss
Some niggas at the surface
Just scratching
I'm white water rafting
In black karma fashion
Flexing God through the atoms
Intake light tree of life through the necklace
Niggas know we fresh with it
Mighty blessings sent to pedestrians
Feel the message
Through metal boxes
Unlock this
Hot shit, probably not
We got this, like milk
Never sip from a cow
Bite tits
While she wifing me down
The ice drips
Off ice picks
Don't matter what the price is
I value myself higher then any flight trip
First class, I was sitting in economy
Second class I was first place honorably
For real I'm like ahead of the game
Thats why I don't play much
Keep me outta your lane
Unless your wanna turn this into bumper cars
Got my monster trucks
Total up ya tonka cars
Willy wonka bars
This the golden one
Elevator up
See me when you see the sun
Yeah, see me when you see the sun
Hella haters guts
All over your mansion
Storm in with silencers
Ghost dog mannerisms
Twirl the gun like a nigga want some
Till you get all puffed up
Looking like a dump truck
You out of luck
Your jokes suck
Get the fuck off the stage, you're done

Hahahaha
