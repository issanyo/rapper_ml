[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

Chillin' with the henchmen you know what time it is...

Chillin' with the henchmen you know what time it is
Im in my prime like Optimus
We plotting for the win
I'm feeling optimistic
Grew up different, studying mystics
The older head threw me the lob I had to rip shit
Either stay on the job or show your true gift
See it open doors like the fortress
Crib next to the forest I was laying low
For a minute hibernating, I'm an animal
See a rapper turn into hannibal
This the lecture
See the minister tell em forgive me of my sins
It's like I can't help but stay sinister
Been on the victory lap
I'm still waiting for them to finish up
So I can move on to other things
Im done racing with you niggas like I'm Usian
Throw a lightening bolt if you ain't get it I'm a rap olympian

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm on the grind like a skateboarder
Flipping shit for the figures
Figure skating
Ha, Figure skating

[Verse 2 - The Koreatown Oddity]

Plus, we on the road like spinning dayton's
Been your favorite you can tell by these nigga's faces
All haters that don't take a hiatus
Working year round no paid vacations
Been bubblin' for a while
Swimming to the surface now
Grab the scuba gear dive right back down
Much deeper
No need to phone it in when I got god on speaker
And the signal is crisp, when I gotta reach em
I connect direct to the operator
While you stuck on hold, talking to that bitch that's automated
A lot of ya'll that think you are the greatest
Finna have your ego popped and your nogan deflated
You get a low score on rotten tomatoes
The way we see you act when you're not in the matrix
Until we cake up and are slaves to none
I taste my ancestor's blood on my tongue
And I'll spit it at you

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm on the grind like a skateboarder
Flipping shit for the figures
Figure skating
Ha, Figure skating

I'm on the grind like a skateboarder
Flipping shit for the figures
Figure skating
Ha, Figure skating
