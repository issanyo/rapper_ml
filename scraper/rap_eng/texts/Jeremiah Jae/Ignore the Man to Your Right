[Sample]
“One gold bar, worth approximately $5,000”
“We’ll see. If you’re right, I’ll pay with dollars. If you’re wrong I’ll pay you both with lead”

[Intro]
Yo, the story of man
Thought he had it all

[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
You ain’t fully focused, man
Cash sitting in hand
In grand ballrooms and all black stunnin'
They call 'em Black Remus
All about the cream and essentials
Supreme elegance, the best that life gets you
Watch the room talk under their breath
As he steps to the place like an S on his chest
Knowing that he really playing the vet
It's a dress hidden under his belt, he really hoeing himself
For the glow, what glitters is gold
To the good life, a champagne toast
Give a tip to the host, read the script, play the role
For the popular vote, to control the populous soul

[Hook: Jeremiah Jae]
Ignore the man to your right, it’s right in front of you
Something you gotta earn, love it or let it burn
Ain’t no concern, you gotta learn to live and let live
Before you in a urn and your time is in

[Verse 2: Homeboy Sandman]
I’ll never be apprehensive, I’ll never be apprehended
I pull jobs
It's something like a massage with a happy ending
I’m the teflon, untouchable
Calm, cold, comfortable
Moonshine gleaming off the baldy
Yo they got nothing on me
Steps undetected over distances
There aren't any fingerprints or witnesses
I will not be serving any sentences
There aren’t any photos
I move at night, there’s not even photosynthesis
I don’t belong in a cage
They’ll never take me alive and I’ma die of old age
They can’t catch so they can’t question
I’ve could teach a class in the clandestine
Plain and simple I’m long gone
Before the long law arm get to arm wrestling
That’s for the coppers and the cons
Peep the symbol on the Cons, homie
Greater than, less than

[Hook]
Ignore the man to your right, it’s right in front of you
Something you gotta earn, love it or let it burn
Ain’t no concern, you gotta learn to live and let live
Before you in a urn and your time is in
