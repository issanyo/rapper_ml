Mob(4x)

[Oliver the 2nd]

They running barefoot, chasing dollars
Lacking basic knowledge
I'm Jordan ballin', you Jason Collins
The mind of an ancient scholar
Sustain logic, when you place the product
Go against the grain, brawlic
Feel the pain often
Black Jungle is the gang
That's the main topic
Get it straight, like the switchblade
When a fade poppin'
Top dollar sage, your in-house out of place
Spit flame, bet his nickname hot lava face
I wake up every morning and I ask myself
Is life worth spittin' with my classic self
When pen press paper paragraphs will melt
Stereos corrode, when the passion felt
Yea this shit get crowded
Full court press, first B*tch get bout it
I'm high and a mess, tryna hear some volume
So, turn this shit up, till ya eardrums wilin'

[Jeremiah Jae]

Man shit get Crowded
When we Mob thru this shit
Yeah, shit get crowded
When we Mob thru this shit
Yeah, shit get crowded

[Jeremiah Jae]

Keep the Squad on, like Sean John
She got pom poms, and she sing along
808 drums, we the chosen ones
Heaven sent, holy smoke
Rolling up another blunt
Blowing on the loud, from the weed man
Taking shit, behind your twitter feed fam?
Haters get Mob'd, fresh death outfit
Turn ya face to a v neck
Real shit on the One
Get ghost in the dark, coming home on the bus
Niggas wilin, the folks stood smiling
Revenge is sweet, till the taste get sour
Focus on the flower
Get the doe rising till we sitting in a tower
Yea we on the horizon
When we mob thru this shit
Yea shit get crowded

[Jeremiah Jae]

Man shit get Crowded
When we Mob thru this shit
Yeah, shit get crowded
When we Mob thru this shit
Yeah, shit get crowded
