[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

You know we running this shit
Plane, train, cab, shit we bussin this shit
On that hustler shit
Chains, black hoodies, straight thuggin n shit

You know we running this shit
Plane, train, cab, shit we bussin this shit
On that hustler shit
Chains, black hoodies, straight thuggin n shit

[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

You gotta work if you really want it
Shits it's nothing if you really love it
I know it looks easy from the outside
It wasn't easy when the homie died
Do it for the city believe me
But I had to get away, I was falling to the dark side
Dead end streets, another homicide
Another day you survive
Always keeping an eye out gets tiring
They asking for your whereabouts
Niggas hiding out
We was riding out and we heard them sirens
We could've been there when the was firing

Niggas runnin and shit

[Pre Chorus]

You know we running this shit
Plane, train, cab, shit we bussin this shit
On that hustler shit
Chains, black hoodies, straight thuggin n shit

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

I know it looks easy from the outside
But its mad time, spent tryin find
Higher frames the mind fit
It's all design
You either write it or get written
These poems echo life times
We writing the new hieroglyphs
They really think we came from chimps
But I am evolving, see me go broke to rich
I ain't going back to this
Nigga scratching for the rent
Straight starving and shit
Ima put on the jersey
Finna ball in this bitch
The best kept secret
My body hosting talent
No Ryan Seacrest
Ain't tryin' be america's idol
But I'm tryin see them checks as far as Idaho
Hit the road, bring them bucks back
Track suit I'm runnin' over tracks
Don't be mad if I don't hit you back

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

You know we running this shit
Plane, train, cab, shit we bussin this shit
On that hustler shit
Chains, black hoodies, straight thuggin n shit

You know we running this shit
