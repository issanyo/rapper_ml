Show respect to the god
Or swollen neck from lam
What the hecklers want
My perspective is shark
Swimming in muddy swamps
Trying to get the jungle to spark
Put the fuse to the spoon
Pull the truck in reverse
Some ol' goon shit
Looney tunes, bitch
Shit straight out of the oven
The governor on the same script

Got the terminator fit
Burn a hater like a spliff
In the night he disappear
Until the sun is clear
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who the flyest of them all
She answered back like, "Baby, give it to me raw"
Beat the lion till u see the dog
Niggas lying when they said you the boss
Floss Dracula teeth
I'm Tommy Hearns with spectacular reach
8 hours, don't sleep
Just be mashing the beat

Cash rules, but I'm the ruler
You a consumer
Met the jeweler
Introduced him to the ankh
You flaunt we rock, you fell victim to the Ra
That's the sun god
My ghetto arkestra
The kettle hot enough to burn flesh
Perm wigs, curb taste
Hot grains catching oatmeal face
Bitter endings to your hotel stay
Black jungle at the finish
Why you so damn late?
