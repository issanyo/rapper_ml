[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
Don't come back Hercules
We're stonger without you
See, we ain't make believe
We're just stronger without you

Yeah we're stronger without you
X2

Hidden tricks found up your sleeves
Must have thought we'd be so stupid
Good way to help the ones in need
Now run along with your friend cupid

See, we ain't make believe
We're just stronger without you
So don't come back, Hercules
Cause if you do we'll find a cure

Yeah, if you do we'll find a cure
X4
Someday...
Hercules,you've been bullying us for too long
And I think it's time we express the right to defend
Yeah, so watch out

Better run for your life
We ain't playing around
No, no

So don't come back Hercules
Yeah, we're much stronger without you
See, we ain't make believe
We're just stronger without you
No hidden tricks found in our sleeve...
