[Chorus 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

Niggas must not got the memo
We been straight raw from the demo
Nigga had to change up the tempo
Niggas think shit is so simple
See me speed off whip it like devo
Smoking good now a nigga straight evil
Got the whole hood with me on beast mode
Got the scope with me looking through the peephole

Who that? Who that? Who that?
Don't open up that door
Don't let out that smoke
Uh, Niggas must not got the memo
My squad been raw since the get go
Nigga smoking on bomb like a missile
Bring the band out nigga no Phish show

[Pre Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Nigga squad on the rise it's official
In the vip nigga blowing on indo'
Ima Chi nigga no pretend though
I'll have ya bitch singing out like figaro, figaro
Nigga had to change up the tempo
When you hear the shots nigga get low
When you on the block better act right nigga
If not niggas hit your window

Nigga got a cup pull the Ac out
When it's all gone pull it back out
All niggas know how to act wild
Mask up pull the gat out
Nigga had to change up the tempo
When you hear the shots nigga get low
When you on the block better act right nigga
If not niggas hit your window

[Chorus 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

Niggas must not got the memo
We been straight raw from the demo
Nigga had to change up the tempo
Niggas think shit is so simple
See me speed off whip it like devo
Smoking good now a nigga straight evil
Got the whole hood with me on beast mode
Got the scope with me looking through the peephole

Who that? Who that? Who that?
Don't open up that door
Don't let out that smoke
Uh, Niggas must not got the memo
My squad been raw since the get go
Nigga smoking on bomb like a missile
Bring the band out nigga no Phish show

[Bridge - Jeremiah Jae]

Uh It's the same shit
Niggas play the same shit
Niggas on lame shit
Nigga got fame quick
But what happens when the flame ain't lit

It's the same shit
Niggas play the same shit
Niggas on that lame shit
Nigga got fame quick
But what happens when the flame ain't lit

[Pre Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Nigga squad on the rise it's official
In the vip nigga blowing on indo'
Ima Chi nigga no pretend though
I'll have ya bitch singing out like figaro, figaro
Nigga had to change up the tempo
When you hear the shots nigga get low
When you on the block better act right nigga
If not niggas hit your window
