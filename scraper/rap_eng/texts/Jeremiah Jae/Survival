[Verse 1 Jeremiah Jae]
The block is a war zone, it’s hot in the cold
The slightest snow got the book thrown at the good folk
Time moves slow, counting days out the window
The dream going correct that but the king live on
In a desert with a berretta, smoking on a Camel
Blood is in the sand, never made it to your hand
Maybe grands grown up, the Gs got the kids playing
Composition’s changing but still we never blown up
Still remain we, never startled at the stardom
Staring at the stars to remember where we started
Still near the bottom but I’m never going back
Started on the path that was ludicrous, you dudes crashed
Doubting my facility, Devil’s down eventually
Speaking ill will cause death and misery
Visual at the candlelight, songs at the ministry
The sound is sweet but they embed the scent of peace

[Chorus]
Outside niggas fighting in the streets
NIGGAS DIE over beef, it’s not sweet
Shorty gotta eat, money I gotta see
FREE I GOTTA BE, I WAS BORN A KING
Outside niggas fighting in the streets
NIGGAS DIE over beef, it’s not sweet
Shorty gotta eat, money I gotta see

[Verse 2 Oliver the 2nd]
You think this shit is easy, don’t you?
You think that being a mogul is more important than feeding the culture
That’s the type of ideology evil endorses
Gangsta holiday in Tahiti with Porsches
A couple hoes gorgeous, that was my ghetto portrait of progress
But hopeless moments we align to focus
Still the ones you rode with, brody, this the jungle movement
It’s kill to kill, the mights in lane to kill, a sidle circuit running through it
Dangerous lives, the stakes is high
Stainless knots, 45 gauges knives
What’s your weapon of choice - is it metal or God
I like to harness my chi niggas, sending my vibe
You a splinter in my side
At the epicenter of demise, self-centered all the time
I hope you find your freedom from the lies
Peace of mind wrapped around a ribbon in the sky

[Chorus X2]
