Yo
You know the deal
(?)
Disco
You ain't know

They ain't knowing the code
See me open the door and disappear in smoke
Despite the situation we grow
Maintain the rock outside in the cold
Fold money into clothes, keep the tool like a pro
Never leavin' with your ho
Tell 'em lips stay closed
Tell 'em lips stay closed
Never leaving with your ho
No
Get froze turn Solo out here movin' dolo
You barking like Tot, you can meet me in the dojo
Bars better, I'm barbaric as Frodo
My accapella's bringing in cheddar
I'm goodfellas with the squad logo
And better rude pushing global
Manifested we know where we headed
We taking over, I'm bringing the soldiers
Careful this shit is explosive
You overdosing, I got locomotives
Crazy visions living vida loca
Blowing smoke up
I'm holding the mic hostage for a million bucks in a white chaffeur
Just be happy I showed up
