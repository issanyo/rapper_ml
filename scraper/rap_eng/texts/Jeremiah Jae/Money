[Intro]
(Jeremiah talking to his girl)

Baby you can have all these material things
Cause all I've ever wanted, is right here in my dreams
I'm feeling so free now, I can do anything
You can have all this money, baby it's just make believe to me

[Verse 1]
Sittin' here, dreaming here so long
Now a nigga got his hopes up
It's so high
Don't give a fuck bout no one
So long
No more job, steady on vacation, sad truth
When he wake up, it's back to blues
Search for clues, that's money in the pocket
Loan sharks, eating you alive
But y'all sleep, sleep
What I gotta do to reach peace, peace
To the game and the streets, G
Never look back
Wait a minute how can I never look back?
Don't really know what's real, must be still sleep
Damn, this life is so deep

[Hook]
Looking out the window
Dreaming 'bout this money
Baby doll left me and that's all she gets from me
Ain't nothing left and these days ain't sunny
No smile on my face, just trying to get this money
