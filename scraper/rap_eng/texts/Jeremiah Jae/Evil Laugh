Carnivore eat rappers at the count of four
Damn, he no longer your favorite rapper anymore
Rap more than presents could hold
Thats why im somewhere making temperatures cold
You bold now with ya homie arounds
But ill make ya chick fold like papers in the envelope
In the study like professor griff
Holy mischief my whole squad a pan movement
Hold the hot pan stupid
These niggas like judas
Let them too close to affairs they act ruthless
You said that ain't the truth
Well then tell me what the truth is?
You got two seconds
Before u roofless
Like the coup is
Double deckers
Dismond Decker
Ill saw u who the rude is
No table manners
No food there
Just the goons that'll move when the goods there
All clear, shit we do all year
It dont change, only tables rearranged
Jimi hendrix raps
Set the macintosh to flames   
Got Jimmy Kimell in the back
That white crack

Like can't take it back
It's done, once you have a taste it's over
It's the first uhh.. First kiss
Yeah, We just running, RUN!
