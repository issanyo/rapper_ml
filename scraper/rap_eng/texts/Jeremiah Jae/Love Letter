[Verse 1:]
Cash straight to mash weight
Ass shake at a  fast pace
Overboard on the coast
Throw these losers off the boat
The code neva speak to the souls
We hold [?]
Ode to the negative love
Word to the format
Digital analog
Camouflage cross beta
Lost data
Toss to the vapors
She caught gabras
Don’t be mad love
You see these [?] pass like a politic
Gambino icepicks
Don’t gamble with these sharks
Something might slip
Deep into the ocean like it’s stolen

[Chorus:]
Lost it all but it still goes back
Through the pain and the anguish maintain alot
Lost it all but it still goes back
Through the pain and the anguish
Love letter you came at last
You came at last[x2]
Love letter

[Verse 2:]
Head on collision
Feds on a mission
Slugs fly for love crimes
They go to sentence
The code: never speak what you saw
Just make redance
Love letter neva got to love, at all
They done lost betta blues
You can’t run with betta shoes
Not even the mouth
El Capitan will find you
While you eat the soup, splash
Goes the hollow tips
Strange how the apple is hang from the smallest limb
Hate get you swallowed
Man these niggas give no fuck
Move like gambino
Stolen Mack trucks

[Chorus]
