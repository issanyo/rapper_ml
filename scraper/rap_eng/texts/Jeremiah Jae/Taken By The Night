[Sample]

[Verse 1]
When the sky turns black that’s when he’s back on the road
Fosho, let’s get to popping them locks and opening doors
The Range Rover, deranged souls, arcade mode
Arcadian on the coast, barbarian on the boat
We more mellow, unravelling cigarillos off that backwood
In the background, we in the room
Catch me lounging, profiling, they giving mean looks
I’m tryna build it, distill it, the liquor in 'em
They rather hate on me, they shining throwing shade on me
Remain a G, we’ll wait until the drama leaves
Catch a fade on the next train, don’t make a scene
Catch me clean or dirty in these cold streets

[Hook]
We can elevate it, make it at the same time
Ain't no basic limitations with your own mind
Tryna climb over the mountain, reach the other side
They said, “Don’t get taken by the night”

[Verse 2]
Ok, two villains on my side
One standing by the exit
Formulated plot, had my soldiers unsuspected
Jealous, zealous thoughts
The Ruggish Bone, I couldn’t shake it
Any second the whole place could turn hectic
Subtle scenery, bar mingling, grab a toast
Man I should roast these little half-brain vagabonds
Grab the llama, squeeze it through them, make it catacombed
Kick the table, bullets flying like a warzone
My squad rushing in the back, unloading golden caps
One nigga tried to make a dash for it and hit the gas
I’m popping back, I saw him crash, I think I hit the calf
He wobbled out, fell on the ground, that’s when I had to laugh

[Hook]
We get elevated, make it at the same time
And don’t place limitations, it’s your own mind
Tryna climb over the mountain, reach the other side
They said, "Don’t get taken by the night"

[Verse 1]
When the sky turns black that’s when he’s back on the road
For sure, let’s get to popping them locks and opening doors
The Range Rover, deranged souls, arcade mode
Arcadian on the coast, barbarian on the boat
We more mellow, unravelling cigarillos off that Backwood
In that background of the room
Catch me lounging, profiling, they giving mean looks
I’m tryna build it, I don’t pay attention to them fools

[Hook]
But we can elevate and make it at the same time
Ain’t no basic limitation, it’s your own mind
Tryna climb over the mountain, reach the other side
They said, "Don’t get taken by the night"

[Outro]
They said, "Don’t get taken by the night"
They said, "Don’t get taken by the night"
They said, "Don’t get taken by the night"
They said, "Don’t get taken by the night"
