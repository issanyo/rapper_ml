I'm stuck inside this psych ward
She always said I had a few loose screws
Guess they wasn't lying huh? whatever tho
Just know when I wake up, it's going down
I don't make up this shit for play
And i'm pacing to claim the crown
Ya'll got my head hurting now
Ya'll got my head hurting now

These are serious matters
Spoke thru delirious chatter
Take the spirit from rappers
And feel superior after
I appear with a pack of
Wild animals active
Keep Gatorade in the droughts
Fogo de Chao in a famine
How we market the magic
The impossible happen
My whole posture is swaggy
Your an impostor with panties on
Tryna copy the master
I'm so hot that i'm flammable
Toss the mic if my hand burn
Posted in this padded room
Getting my grub on
Fendi straitjacket chained ankles
The Love strong
I feel it like a cold needle, stuck in my numb arm
Gritty city, turn a millionaire to a slum dog
Getting good, bet I set it off
Like I said I would
You sorta soft, like some soft serve
Serve his girly raw
We turn it up
Hard to turn it down like, we've heard enough
Burning blunts wiling
Like when we heard what the verdict was
Seek and find, Godly motto
Free the mind, body follow
Jungle Squad, firing hollows
Hide ya wives, hide ya daughters
Analyze your being
Or personalities set the bar
Staring at the man in the mirror
Like have we met before?
