I wrote me a Holy Thesis
So demons get broke to pieces
Coastin' like costa ricans
In motion like motion pictures
Focused on solar systems
Ask Coto, he know the business
We out here, it's no to limits
Limitless know the business

Grew up in disorder
Caddy corner to Cadi's & Quarters
Candy paint, painted on the explorer
We salivate a proposals, just like we spose to
Vocals is sorta loco, go postal on homie Pro-Tools
Caught in the moment, bears lost in the forest
Hang it up, boy you boring
Your paragraphs ain't important
You ain't moonwalked the Sun
Sun-danced in the solars
My footwear is imported, compared to your pair of Jordans
We there with the paranormal
Spirits don't fear the mortals
Prepare to be consumed
If your anywhere near the portal
This is ghoule rap, for the abstract on sad soil
Whole team flame
Grab a match, add oil
Brain taking a bath from cultivating the craft
These lames making me laugh
Hearts breaking in half
Scars making a scab, ya numbskull
Tommy gun drum, play in a band
Who want what?

I wrote me a Holy Thesis
So demons get broke to pieces
Coastin' like costa ricans
In motion like motion pictures
Focused on solar systems
Ask Coto, he know the business
We out here, it's no to limits
Limitless know the business
