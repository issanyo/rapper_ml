[Intro - The Streetz]
Yeah, you already know
Been in this shit, keeping it raw from the jump
Niggas still don't know what's up
They don't know we shinning

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

They said if you ain't getting money why you rhyming for?
Do it for the love and you ain't getting dough
I can see it coming it's just moving slow
They said once you have it all, it's mo problems though
I just want the checks, I ain't tryin flex
Show the fam respect or we at ya neck
Grew around them crooks they was making threats
The hood you had to rep ain't no secrets kept

Somebody in the streets always watching
Somebody in the streets always watching
Being sweets not an option
No halloween but the mask on

[Verse - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm still after that raw dough
Follow the flow take it back to the G.O
I'm taking it back, I'm rap's repo
Man, my team's so G.I Joe
Army fatigues we warring in these streets
Trick or treat with the mask on, no halloween
Don't make a scene
Niggas ready with the steam
We tryin' live the dream
They don't wanna see it
All we know is cream rule everything around
Watching B.E.T tryin' make believe
You was on the screen
They was watching me
See we really kings I call her my queen
She a rider with the canon make Mariah sing
Throw a hater to the gators, catch you talkin mean
See me skating through the matrix, tryin' make the green
Niggas fakin' cuz they agents, I'm keanu reeves
Neo smoking on a fronto leaf
We are not the same, this a different league
So much loud up in my brain, I can't hear em speak
Tell them fools stay in your lane, better keep it G

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

They said if you ain't getting money why you rhyming for?
Do it for the love and you ain't getting dough
I can see it coming it's just moving slow
They said once you have it all, it's mo problems though

They said if you ain't getting money why you rhyming for?
Do it for the love and you ain't getting dough
I can see it coming it's just moving slow
They said once you have it all, it's mo problems though

I just want the checks, I ain't tryin flex
Show the fam respect or we at ya neck
Grew around them crooks they was making threats
The hood you had to rep ain't no secrets kept

Somebody in the streets always watching
Somebody in the streets always watching
Being sweets not an option
No halloween but the mask on
