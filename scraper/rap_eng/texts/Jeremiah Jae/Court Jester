So midevil the beagle regal
We jesus people
Play me cheap meet van peebles
Keep ya hands where the light stay
High like a kite damn
Sight seeing, rice krisy weed breakfast eating
The only thing i flame is the weed
But if you really cracking jokes
Put flames to ya V
Stay in position with feet
Dog you inches from peace
Not summer of love
More like colt 43
Add a couple of p's
Niggas stuffed in the brief
Flip the wig like beetoven
While the opera sings
Dog its nothing for the team to bust
Wet em up till the heater rust
Banging with the feeder and now we rolling of this hazel dust
My the lane is too kanevil
These people will see em hop truck
Make the buck, splash in a lush cut
You mad cuz we ruckus
Certified leaf cutters
