[verse 1]
Street signs decorate the landscape
Ain't no facade daily broken in the rubble
Some collect the rubbish
Like another man's treasure
Hunt, dust blowing in the wind
Make it hard to search

JP on the nameplate, covered in dirt
But like a phoenix I rise from defeat
Out the ashes
And climb into the seat
See the empty road
Black canvas, a lost soul

In a terry cloth fro with the golden crest
Pat your eye like a pirate, our watch
Still ticking like bomb threat
Straight smoke cloud the glass like a bomb hit
Fibers in you lens

[verse 2]
Metal versus metal
Thin slow hand
Blood cover my chest
Could it be the end?
Life flashes
Life and times of a villain
On a mass run
Sure it made a killing

Built an empire
The legacy will keep building
Blocks on my feet keep sinking
A stone face
Last slick upon the coke brick
One wish
Is that me seed be the death of you

[verse 3]
Morrisine avenue
Alimony settlement
Matrimony settled
Death do us part
Car parked on the hill
Tripping in the dark
11:30
Street lights flickering
Adding to the eeriness
Lifeless transitioning
Within the transmission
Like a faint whisper
Told me step into the light
A bright ending
Time shifting
Sweet melody I heard singing
In the distance the new me reborn
Sworn enemy
No rest of flesh has vengeance

Uh JP mothafucka
