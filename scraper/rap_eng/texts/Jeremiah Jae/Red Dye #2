I only like the color red when it's satin sheets
I only like the color red when it's blood
I only like the color red when it's the
Sun setting by the sea
I only like the color red when it represents love

I only like the color red when it's your soft stone eyes
And I see the same in mine
******************************************
I only like the color red when it's
Your cheeks being shot
I only like the color red when it's a strawberry
Or when it's a solo cup in July
I only like the color red when December is
Merry and the whole family's gathered around
Eating good for the night

I only like the color red when it's satin sheets
I only like the color red when it's blood
I only like the color red when it's a cherry stem
In a knot between the red lips of a woman
Resting gently on her tongue

Singing
Bloody sky
Bloody mother
Bloody hale

I only like the color red when it's in my dreams
Red flashing from the signals
See these high beams
I only like the color red blowing from her aura
I only like the color red when it's primary

Red dress and lipstick
I know she ready
On a canvas painting red rum melodies
I only like the color red when the sky's falling apart
I only like the color red in the shape of a heart

I only like the color red when it turns green
Birds singing flowers in your hair
In the red sea
I only like the color red in a murder scene
Or red dye #2
Red eyes on the move
I only like the color red in full bloom
And blood moon shining on
My red shoes
I only like the color red when I'm pulling teeth
I only like the color red when these guns squeeze
