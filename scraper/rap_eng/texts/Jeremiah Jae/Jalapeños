[Verse 1: Captain Murphy]
Bitch
What the fuck you think I'm here for?
This is how I live ho
It's just a fucking game girl
My life is Nintendo
I beat this game everyday
I beat this game everyday
I beat this game everyday

[Verse 2: Captain Murphy]
Try to find bitches love it when I'm fucking rough and stuff
Hate to see me drunk walking like I'm Snuffleufagus
Cut your fuss
Meant to be
Controlling thoughts, mentally
Plain to see my puppets, inner demons, and her fantasies
All must submit to the rule of Galactus
I'm the opposite of trill shit my minions in the millions kill
Laughing like a rabbit
I got the planet clutched still
X-pill up in my gut
Now it's time to find a slut
Trick her into drinking nut
Until the kids come bubble up
Double Dragon this is random, Captain fucking save 'em all
Bow your head and make a wish up on my swollen dragon balls
Catch 'em all
Pokemon
Captain known to choke a blonde out
Does she like it?
No doubt, even though she crying
Oh wow simmer down I only kinda mean it
Feel the same burn sucking on my jala-penis
The rap genius
