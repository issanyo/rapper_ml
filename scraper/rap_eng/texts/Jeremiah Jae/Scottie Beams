[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

We came up outta the street
We climbing up in the seat
We got the shooters in reach
We running we strappin' the cleats
I took the game like a thief
You dissing the squad you sleep
They acting hard they weak
I make them bars speak
Hop in the car creep
My niggas at large we deep
I got my name on the lease
I got yo bitch on a leash
Handle the work capeesh
We taking them flights east
You know we got it for cheap
Hit up scottie for the beam

[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

Enterprise I'm up in the seat
I got ties to the streets
I got ties to the church
My grandfather put in work
My grandmother was a G
Always kept it in the team
Started out as a dream
Then I realized I wasn't i was sleep
Had to take time building me
Myself yourself or they'll make you
Play yourself for them major keys
That's just something I can't do
They just made cuz we can't lose
Can't see cuz we outta view
Scottie beamin' get you out of body
I got bodies, hiding on the roof

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

We came up outta the street
We climbing up in the seat
We got the shooters in reach
We running we strappin' the cleats
I took the game like a thief
You dissing the squad you sleep
They acting hard they weak
I make them bars speak
Hop in the car creep
My niggas at large we deep
I got my name on the lease
I got yo bitch on a leash
Handle the work capeesh
We taking them flights east
You know we got it for cheap
Hit up scottie for the beam

[Bridge - Jeremiah Jae]

I got two bags on me holding narcotics
See the blue and reds on me like a shooting target
And I, can't slip  gotta keep walking
Thing on the hip, make em beam Scottie

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm thinking bigger my nigga
Fuck you and all your opinions
We came up out of the trenches
They never gave us a mention
Nigga this shit is colossal
I been underground like a fossil
I been in the lab check the catalog
I been in the kitchen with notta
You got squares in your circle like waffles
I'm Prince serving pancakes
To your main chick she'll swallow
No dinner date my mandate
I penetrate then vacate
I keep flowing like great lakes
You soft niggas like cup cakes
Im fucking ya bitch in the tossils

Hmm look at the time though
I gotta go and get mine hoe
Get back in line hoe
It took me a minute to get it
I been in the kitchen with the notta
Bitches like u are the father
Ima turn up in the Space Base
Ima tell Ras get the lighter

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

We came up outta the street
We climbing up in the seat
We got the shooters in reach
We running we strappin' the cleats
I took the game like a thief
You dissing the squad you sleep
They acting hard they weak
I make them bars speak
Hop in the car creep
My niggas at large we deep
I got my name on the lease
I got yo bitch on a leash
Handle the work capeesh
We taking them flights east
You know we got it for cheap
Hit up scottie for the beam
