[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]
It's cut throat, eyes on the bank load
After the gold done sank below sea, yo
Cold water, no boat, you freeze, post-mortem
Off course, couldn't handle the voyage
Close quarters, black water tide
The block is like the ocean when they paint [?]
Grew around the lake side
When they ride or die, you see pigs fly
Helicopter rides, see it all on Channel 5
She want Chanel, had to change the channel
Fuck around, leave you swimming in the English Channel
I'm watching BBC, smoking CBD
This is chemistry, my bio on the English Channel
All day re-runs, we don't play
I keep the golden egg, eyes like a Buddha head
Give you a red stripe, no beers
