[Verse 1]
Criminal mindstate, the villain is primate
The illest, most nihilist, venomous, high on this island I’m Gilligan
Forreala man, challenge the center man
Leave you choked, challenge of cinnamon
Send the soap channel to cope to the inner city hopeless
Less venomous thought, see the foes, give a cold stare
Criminal mind, subliminal mind games
The realest, most illest, no feelings inside him, nigga
Inside of a killer
Forreala man, you just a beginner, man
Leave you ghost, challenging veterans
Send the quote, scramble the dough
As the inner-city hopeless cameras caught on the news, it’s a cold tale

[Hook]
This the concrete some call home
Lost souls tryna get back on
Play the game, it’s no tic-tac-toe
To make a name it goes “get that dough”
This the concrete some call home
Lost souls tryna get back on
Play the game, it’s no tic-tac-toe
To make a name it goes “click-clack”, uh

[Verse 2]
Criminal mindstate, the villain is primate
The illest, most nihilist, venomous, high on this island I’m Gilligan
Forreala man, quiet the little man
Take a slice cut out the middle man
Send the trucks, harbour the bucks
To the inner-city go-getters, animals taught
Turn gorilla when it’s monkey business
Criminal mindstate, the innocent find faith
Delivered through villainous acts
Still in the center of crime rates
The bigger man, after the winner bread
Leaving crumbs after the dinner date
Send the cake, eat in they face
While the inner-city hope for to be in their place
Cause when it fades we all want war

[Hook]
