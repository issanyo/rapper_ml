[Sample]
He's dynamite, you know the type or reputation he has
I hated him more than I’ve ever hated anyone in my life

[Intro]
I’ve seen the highs and the lows
Some eyes still stay closed
Some eyes still don’t know
They out, lost in the cold

[Verse 1]
Tryna make it out snow, heart made of stone, bars made of gold
Lucy in the sky but eyes are on the boat
Tryna set sail, rise from the smoke
Life’s like a movie, they shooting like a show
Cut your role, pus on the floor
Run, lose the dope (Soldier)
No hope, cope with the lows
Can't boast when you broke (Soldier)
A toast say “here’s to the folks" (Soldier)
Hills in resorts
Cop bills, a pill to the poor–

[Hook]
Ain’t no use to cry
And when I’m down I hope you love me
It ain’t no use to cry
I’ll do my best to carry on
So ain’t no use to cry
I hope somebody up there loves me

[Bridge]
I’ve seen the highs and the lows
Some eyes still stay closed
Some eyes still don’t know
They out, lost in the cold

[Verse 2]
Tryna make it through the storm
Dark clouds overhead surround the throne
Bars made of stone, crown’s made of thorns
Walking back home, on the road the block is stove top
Make [?] soul drop
Get down like James Brown when them rounds go off
Big Dom is in the sky tryna grab 'em all
A [?] headed to the [?]
Eating carbs in the hood starved
Uh, she said she want a real love
Tried my best to give her the world

[Hook]
Ain’t no use to cry
And when I’m down I hope you love me
It ain’t no use to cry
I’ll do my best to carry on
So ain’t no use to cry
I hope somebody up there loves me

[Bridge]

[Hook]
