[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]

Been up and down on the road
Felt outta place in this world
Sometimes don't know where to go
I gravitate toward the whirlwind
My hand slippin'
To the homies I seem distant
Don't socialize over media I might delete it
Was bullied as a kid and Im sure it's worst now
For the shorties coming up, cause now they meme it
But they don't really mean it
Just tryin' get a laugh
But now when the people see em
They only think of that, see it's
So dark he can hardly see
And he's, so mad he can hardly speak
And it's, Pitch black when you walking through the streets
And the only light on's up high and outta reach
Told the teacher I had to leave
Started seeking something
Heard em say life is but a dream
So I don't need sleep, I'm laid back on trees
Lay crack on beats peace to G.O.D
Now we must proceed
To give you what you need

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Might not be when you want it
But it's still all me
Yeah It's still all me
Might not be when you want it
But it's still gone heat up
Yeah It's still all me
Yeah It's still all me
Might not be when you want it
But its right on time
I'm coming up and that's all on me
It's on me

[Pre Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Yeah, every night I'm up
Moving up, roll another blunt
Turn it up
Tune the world out
We in the zone now
Fill the cup
Roll another blunt, let's go way up
Turn it up
Tune the world out
We all alone now

It's just me and you, what you wanna do?

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Might not be when you want it
But it's still all me
Yeah It's still all me
Might not be when you want it
But it's still gone heat up
Yeah It's still all me
Yeah It's still all me
Might not be when you want it
But its right on time
I'm coming up and that's all on me
It's on me

[Bridge - KarenBe]

Every night I'm up
Roll another one
Every night I'm up
Looking for your love
Every night I'm up

Every night I
Roll another blunt
I don't give a fuck
I just want your love
Roll another one
I just want your love
Every night I'm up
I don't give a fuck
I just want your love
I just want your love
