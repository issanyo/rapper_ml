[Verse 1: Captain Murphy]
Been a long time coming, been lost in the night
Learned how to do the Dougie with the devil in the moonlight
Shit's right wherever we go
Long as we find two girls right after the show
Not what you thinking though
Be the certain kind of person hurting from the daily grind
Now join us in the search where we find true potential
Within us, invite them girls to dinner, and then it's
Conviction in my speech, all intense in this heat
Lead 'em to a place where my mind got molded
Tell 'em not to worry when we travel blindfolded
It's just for precaution, your new family is awesome
You're gonna love it here, drink another beer and listen here
Rolling through the woods on dub
All black hoodies, carry torches, banging the sub
Just like a set, so
Gather round the fire, we cast all our worth in
Blonde girl whispering in my ear that she's a virgin
Told her I could smell it

[Verse 2: Captain Murphy]
Never thought I'd smell the scent of innocence
Living in the city made my own mind my nemesis
Beyond the beyond, these sins of the flesh
I told her to undress so she could be blessed
It's a full moon, 1st June submission, we uphold tradition
Let the fire burn away the doubts in this mission
Take a step forward, she didn't even think twice
Cast in the fire, sing a song of virgin sacrifice

[Outro]
"Before the moment of death, the brand of Satan was burned in her flesh... (screaming) As an order of the house of Viga, this high court of the inquisition of Odaiba has found you guilty. By of the second born of the prince of Viga, answer to ash... that you will take from me! And I... I shall return to torment and destroy throughout the nights of time!"
