[Verse 1: Zeroh]
Welcome to set desert, where heads catch the metro
Black out on the bus, hologram transit
Dream sat in on the handrail when I stand at my advantage
Kicking the can it's stuck, this video go active
The man child manifest fat stats
Heavy bragging, combative, grams drag my lights out
Ache on that number eight until the suns of Jay
Shove in the flux vortex, text stunner
Rodney Mullen the fuck out for the fun of it
Yo, you've done enough
Yeah fun on us, won't none of this
Bust your bitch, biscuit to butter pits-
Grease your scotch, go out, hearts a skip and a jump
Back your ways up the boulevard
You make it look that easy-
Even the Pleiades believe in zins, with
Zenith reach, synchronize vibing with the highest me
Me arrive, it's that guy with the Midas reach
Feast your eyes, taste my light
