[Hook: Captain Murphy]
I'm a dog, I'm a freak
Rock a different beat every day of the week
Gotta get it tweaked over super raw freaks
Yeah, I'm a dog, I'm a beast, yeah
Your homies better ask about me
When I flip this shit it's similar to O-Z
Yeah, smoke an ounce and invade your house
Smoke an ounce and invade your house

[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
I'm in the living room, peeling blue crystals on the sofa
You feeling comfortable, I jump out and harass your guests I'm swag to death
Reborn where the Pharaohs are kept
They fill my body with preservatives, I move past the urban binge
You curd milk sour for cheese, I detergent-spin a verse and then dip it in diligence
The opposition desolate, instruments picked for the death of your reign
Collapsed in the time (Wayne enterprise)
With five synth lines, black jungle squad on that raw shit
I made her jaw twitch, but not from no sex or nothing like that
Although this one time, I caught her tryna fuck with my tracks
Had to punch her in the claps
As for you chumps stole my money for lunch,
Now we taking our money back and your honey out to lunch
(That's right bitch)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Captain Murphy]
Rap game Abe Lincoln, free slaves from your thinking
Open up your mind and feel the tingle in your spinal
I never thought the rage was primal funny one would look inside
In our reality you see the fantasies from Final
Suicide sometimes an option, knocking on the doors of Heaven's gate
Like every day's an ad for Kool-Aid ad and Kony made it great
Major flavor paid in favors fuck the label, save it
Where I'm from it doesn't matter what your name is, shit, shame I'm famous
Never shoulda gave me money, spend a lot of dough
On shit I think is funny, bought a bag of charlie now my nose is runny
Got the game all fucked cause we getting chummy
Running circles round a dying breed with the speed of 20 flying steeds
(Surprise) the kind of life I lead, catapulted
In the middle of an ocean hopin' that these bitches never notice me
Fuck the fame
When you hear that (hahahahaha) I bet you know it's me, fucker

[Verse 3: Jonwayne]
Alright, I'm a dog I'm a beast
There's times when I don't feel human being
Sometimes I feel I skipped that plateau
And went straight to taking rips from a man that governed pharaohs
We shouting at a burning bush
You could learn a thing or two from the book
Of course I talk about the one in which I write, brother
Engineering rhymes in the style of the Wright brothers
Fly to death
Got the whole city of angels under my breath, smell it
The cards are already dealt
No magicians at the table keep the sleeves to yourself
Soft to the brush, you think inside the box so much
That they're afraid to even give you a belt
...But they're not too worried about the welts
