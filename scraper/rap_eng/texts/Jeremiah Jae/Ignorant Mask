[K. Embry]
Hundred green glass tippin'
Brim make me swim for a lot of distance
If I could seek it I swear to keep it
Poppa's meek compared to poppa's reach
That girl too gone
Enter while its intertwinin'
You need a license on
The fence of the 19
Skirt speak to the casual, they damagin' books
So the truth shook its way
Where the scandalous crooks lay
Big eyes on all the youth
Little ones too
Breathe a breath for me
I'm feedin' off the energy
Lock down love, equal cemetery, carry all of this (yeah)
Cause all of us is hopeless
I don't know you
Therefore, I don't know you
Unapproachable emotions tangled into blue
Empty spaces I must grab 'em
Can't stand em for one thing
Let my pulse ring, temperature is too high
Gotta say goodbye to adolescence
Thought is still present
Hope is still present, shaking for the answer
Dancin' to a new beat, animosity
Changes like a new leaf, four old teeth
Hopin' for a couple of dollas
Retainin' years that age tried to swalla'
Counter epunchin'
I don't land as much
From tall heights supercedin'
Wear to breathe in, and overthinkin'

Surprise entrance
You know the vision triple twenty
Grab ya face honey
Straight through the velvet curtain
Climbin' over mountains boo
You need them new shoes too soon
We gonna wake up
Them diamond plugs seemin' more like designer crimes
Killer fashion, fast huntin' caught the lion print
Behind the whip
Held the mighty gate to paradise
And bigger skies even bigger minds
Times shoots through the roof
Hop in the coup, lets get a space
Far away from the desolate, miles high
She told me that she miss the normal life
Yo yo them days was pretty sunny but
My minds hunting

...we on the prowl
Finally made it
