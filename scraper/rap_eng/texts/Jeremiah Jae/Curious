[Verse One: Jonwayne]

My family builds like pig triplets
Armed with bricks, just the type you build homes with
No coke head shit
I hear folks boo my flow on the mic
Funny thing cause they're nowhere in sight
They must be damn good ventriloquists
So nice you might think Im writing in cursive
When I leak heat like a broken pipe in the furnace
Furnish the beat and hold the damn mic with a purpose
Serve and protect with earnest syllables, yo
I gotta surplus
My ducks in a row and my eggs in the basket
And let them hatch when Im seeking expansion
My ideas are massive and meticulous
Particularly when Im gripping
For pens to draw upon my own endless narrative
Raw and imperative, I dont shine
I glare like carrots in the wintertime air
The gems genuine
Colder than flightless birds in tuxedos
The penguin mangling verbs when the arm drops the needle

[Hook X2]
But cats whack
Robin more hood than the repo man
No robin hood, more like Serious Sam
No dull shit, only curious jams whether it's good or it's bad
I can say you never had what I had

[Verse Two]
[Jeremiah Jae]
You know I'm not the type to complain but lately it's the rain
Yeah the rain on my brain
Heater in the freezer I saw it all change
When the wintertime came
She got cold veins
Grow and attain
The Romain Lettuce
The same stress that is play baseball at Grand Cross
The dream sunny like the lakefront at south shore
Mouths in awe as the wonder-ball twirls
In the world niggas' brag about the course
On the [?]  grabbing nicks and dimes for sport
On the bike wintertime [?]
Like the villain got frost
Gotta get ahead while the living cost
[Cheep?] in these beats for free
Dog I'm not playing the beat
The foreground fades in the mist of a ry
Now peep the [sea?] game as you floating underneath
Find something underneath
Lime, swallow by the light
In the heat now you's try to paint yourself white
To many nigga's worry about impressions live life

[Hook x1]

[Verse Three: Zeroh]
When the now?
Fate, foreseen, facade, no foolish quest
Destined I move like, Be Here Buddhist
Found Sound, Under Sun Sol
Old Noonish cycle return soul
We're so clueless, Man, thinking back
I can't recall a goal that wasn't recordable'
Lokkin',lucky dis SX Double A Portable??
Tryin' to be social: Hopeless
Twist joint, love points focal
Po' man hopes to the south costal, Folks!
Take notice, Zeroh, Never novice
But nervous sometimes, cause my work is service
If you're not listen', then I ain't doing my job
Go over here dear, just toss me a lob Of info
I'll 360 full circle mass mental jam and cram it in
Like injera with [?] lentils, Got hands on my energy
Tuned in turnt' up caught static
Trying to make sense of infinity, fuck it
Let Go, We are whatever we can Be
At the time i don't care I swear
It's too damn hard to be real
I'm to odd to be chill, but what's that?
My axe and these facts mismatch ayo these-

[Hook x1]
