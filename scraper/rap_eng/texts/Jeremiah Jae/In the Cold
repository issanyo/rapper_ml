[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

In the cold, in the cold, in the cold, in the cold
In the cold, in the cold, in the cold, in the cold
In the cold, in the cold, in the cold, in the cold
In the cold, in the cold, in the cold, in the cold

[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

As the days go by and I am, all alone again
As the days go by and I am, all alone again
As the days go by and I am, all alone again
As the days go by and I am, all alone again

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

In the cold, in the cold, in the cold, in the cold
In the cold, in the cold, in the cold, in the cold
In the cold, in the cold, in the cold, in the cold
In the cold, in the cold, in the cold, in the cold

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

As the days go by and I am, all alone again
As the days go by and I am, all alone again
As the days go by and I am, all alone again
As the days go by and I am, all alone again

As the days go by and I am, all alone again
All alone again
