[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

I remember now...
I remember now...

When it's all said and done
I'm just tryin' get these funds
I'm just tryin' live my life
I'm just tryin' have my fun
And I'm gonna take my time

[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

Tell god thanks for the day
So many snakes on the way
I've made mistakes on the way
Feel like I give and they take
Guess it's better that way
I'm holding on please don't let em slip away
I remember now

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

When it's all said and done
I'm just tryin' get these funds
I'm just tryin' live my life
I'm just tryin' have my fun
And I'm gonna take my time

[Bridge - Jeremiah Jae]

They said patience is a virtue
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to not call you back
I know I'm hurting too
I don't have all the clues to the puzzle
Unlock the mystery to life
But if somehow we build
Then we'll eventually rise

I don't have all the clues to the puzzle
Unlock the mystery to life
But if somehow we build
Then we'll eventually rise

I don't have all the clues to the puzzle
Unlock the mystery to life
But if somehow we build
Then we'll eventually rise

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

Time moving slowly I'm just tryin keep up
You socializing everyday but you don't speak much
Shorty got a body that she putting on display
Big homie got them bars but he see em everyday
I been back in the back, pushing bars and beats for the pay
Till it's racks on them racks to get Lamborghini's for days
Catch you on the road, niggas paying you a visit
Im the realest nigga living word that's how I feel
From the south side we don't give a fuck about appeal
Write ya name down, nigga gave his life away for a deal
Bunch of yolo niggas given souls away for a mil
Spent it in the same day, tell me how do you feel?
Tell me how do you feel?
