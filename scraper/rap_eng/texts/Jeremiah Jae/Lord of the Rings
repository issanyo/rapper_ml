[Intro: Jeremiah Jae]
This the one, baker squad
Verse up, Dafi

[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
Yo I'm in it for the chicken
Popeyes, if you looking from a distance
I despise jealousy and cruel intentions
If you speakin’ ill about us, get a hospital visit
L.A. Confidential be twistin'
My vision hella different
The venom in your dissin', what you talkin’ about?
Big dogs barking the house
That MC's rough take a bite outta crime, nigga
DMC run the beat like a track meet
Cash from grease the currency is strange
Money on the brain, brain from the honey
It's funny, sometimes life has a strange way of formin'
Fortify the fortress, forty in the thirty-eight
Birdy in the safehouse
Courtesy of murder base
You fuckin’ sweet, you should eat a cake
I'm on the peak, got to see the lake

[Verse 2: Oliver the 2nd]
Stereo shredder, imperial rhythm, serial killa
Who think they more better
Give ‘em blues like Cynda Williams
Blaze a Spike Lee joint outside of the building
Grindin' like Anthony Mosley
Keepin' my mind on a million
Fuck any man that oppose me
Let ‘em all dance with the demons
Ima two-step with the angels
Either way god is a DJ
Been rocking rooms since sock and shoes(?)
Samiyam, no Dr. Seuss
Panoramic optic views, my third eye is incomparable
One fifth of Moscato, she pussy poppin’, remarkable
Tell her ball for ball, I'm a star with the Aristotle flow
Verse will rock the party like Paul Bacardi on all these hoes
No autographs, no articles
And never Instagram where the guala(?) goes
I shine like I got a glow
You light every time you spoke
In my mind, you’re a mynah, bro
On the rise like a spinal cord
My insides are kinda cold
Your insides vagina mold
Either die or design a clone

Verse up
