[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Hey (8x)

Tell me how you feel
We’re out on the field
Where the grass is real
Hundred dollar bills

Hey (8x)

Tell me what you see
Is it silver screens?
Nothings what it seems
Nothings what it seems

[Verse - Jeremiah Jae]

Running in the field come and catch me im up
Till the sun down catch a nigga in the dust
We be shinning in the ruff
Diamonds on my cuff
Master number on the clock
Working till the time’s up
Just another day
I be, I be
Surfing on the waves
Outside ya page, every night n day see same
New age, put ice in ya veins
Cave men, no lights in ya brain
I said

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Hey (8x)

Tell me how you feel
We’re out on the field
Where the grass is real
Hundred dollar bills

Hey (8x)

Tell me what you see
Is it silver screens?
Nothings what it seems
Nothings what it seems

[Post Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Running in the field come and catch me im up
Till the sun down catch a nigga in the dust
We be shinning in the ruff
Diamonds on my cuff
Master number on the clock
Working till the time’s up
