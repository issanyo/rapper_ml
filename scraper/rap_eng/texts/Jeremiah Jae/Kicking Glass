[Intro: Samples]
Being held in a maximum security section of prison
A prison
I thought I'd never get out of this prison
Kinda fucked up nigga
Now I have my own cozy cell
Had it been me lord I'd have killed that fool

[Verse 1]
Uh, don't play yourself
End up chasing your tail
Getting mail in a four-corner cell
Living hell
Cast a speaker spell
Kill the ill that you speak and tell
Runaround snitching on killers will get you [?]
On that open road
When lonely souls gravitate toward the krill
Congratulate you if you came out the real
Approaching tomorrow
[Focal?] on the sorrow
Many said give a little some try to steal
Caught you greasy believe won't be a next time
If it was me you'd be sleeping with a pet saw
You think it's easy don't you
You think this shit is cool

{Sample}
Had it been me lord I would have killed that fool

[Verse 2]
Don't play yourself
End up chasing your tail
High bail spend a night in a cell
Mental hell
No homies coming for you
They all lonely in the soil
Told you never try to fuck with my team
Cause we'll show you some things
Pull out the toolbox and reach for the pliers
Make a baritone sing like Mariah
Dumb canons make 'em separate
Lying in gutter
Motherfucker pick a date
I'll bring the Louisville slugger
Uh motherfucker

[Hook]
Caught you greasy believe me won't be a next time
If it was me you'd be sleeping with a pet saw
You think it's easy don't you
You think this shit is cool
{Had it been me lord I'd have killed that fool}
Caught you greasy believe me won't be a next time
If it was me you'd be sleeping with a pet saw
You think it's easy don't you
You think this shit is cool
You never learned your lesson
I'll take you back to school

[Outro]
Tried to shoot him x4
Had it been me lord I would have killed that fool
I'm not that nice
Well, I didn't see him since yesterday
Not since the cops was around
You um you didn't call him
Yeah, I called him but he ain't there
I - I gotta get in touch with him
He's got something of mine
