[Verse 1: Zeroh]
Sucker please
I don't have to grub on no government cheese
I'm just trying to flex my knees
Turned upside down, swinging on trees
Yup, my niggas don't listen
Urge in the purge the occurs then inferno
Thermodynamics seated planet ammo

Mark of despair, the boss in the flame
Gloss harsh you can fear but be sparse in appearance
Marks in the mirror, narcissist the arson
Fox interference, pardon the hearts, and transition
Perform a new sacred right
I will charge up my fingertips with  [?] and point that light
To the martian amidst, to the fathers that skipped, to the authors
Cause and affect
Fetch me the gi
Burning that's unsaid, bomb [?] sunset wars, dads best friend
Don't follow me, don't follow me
