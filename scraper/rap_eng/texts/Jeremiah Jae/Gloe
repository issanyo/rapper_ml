[Hook]
Look past the world and see the gloe
Look past the world and see that gloe
Look past the world and see it gloe
Look past the world and see the gloe

[Verse]
Beyond the mind shadows she and I will be united yes
This is the kind of notion that she couldn't even second guess
Connected intertwined defined but blinded by that silly gloe
You know that fucking thing you saw
Pretendin that you didn't though
Where the fuck I just said right?
This is in my head right?
How you plan to sleep tonight?
I'm looking over my shoulder now
This is fucking awkward
Now I'mma speak to a fucking doctor
And get a second opinion about that gloe and thing under my uhh
Despite the things you think you know
Proceed to touch the world and gloe

[Hook]
Look past the world and see the gloe
Look past the world and see it gloe
Look past the world and see it gloe
Look past the things you think you know
