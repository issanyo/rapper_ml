Jump squad
Doves on the roof
Uh
Yeah
Doves on the roof, doves on the roof
Gold star'll put dots on your coupe
You're not bullet proff
Pull the saw we don't gotta shoot
Or take it back to the roots
When it was all peace, all G in the hood
Just some young 'uns trying to do good
By the book, taught to stay away from crooks
When you saw him doing wrong don't look
Stay on the book, when they curse cover your ears
You in the wrong place, you ain't s'posed to be here
Stay clear cause it ain't so clean there
But we be where son told him beware
Didn't listen, we was flipping birds in the air
Trying to cop fresh pairs
To see the wiz, you gotta have flash and flair

Rough riders we out here supplying
Tough guy he fly, no he lying
Rough riders we out here supplying
We out here
