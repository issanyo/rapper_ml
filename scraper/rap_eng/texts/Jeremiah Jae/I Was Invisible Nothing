[Intro: Samples]
"Let's get this over with"
"What's the matter with you, you're jumpy as a cat"
"I know I'm scared, if you had any sense you'd be scared too"
"Let's [pose?] these trailers here"

[Verse 1]
Uh, niggas ain't talking 'bout shit
Scrawl money eat up
The street thugs cry and released doves
Fly in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Nah, it's Voltron nigga with the eagle in the front seat
Speak about [?] it's that sound of the jump-street
Hop in the truck set speeds with the mach-3
Rocks in the jaw drop
Cash in the warlock
It's a rough ride
Deez head eavesdrop
Rough ride on the boat
Catching speed drops
Fleeing hot pursuit
Channel 3 hot
Blowing up [ratings]
Turn up in Vegas
Play the odd for the wrist
End up in the cage
When that pen drip venomous a rap
Squad on the map nigga


[Hook]
Uh, trying to get it don't let the cops see
Invisible in a drop [V?]
Invisible on the block we
Trying to get it don't let the cops see
Invisible you cannot see
Trying to get it don't let the cops see
Invisible in a drop [V?]
Invisible on the block we
Invisible you cannot see ... me

[Verse 2]
Uh, niggas ain't talking 'bout shit
[Gaddafi?] in the party with a fifth
Dogs wanna sniff
Bitch want a gift but I don't trick
Butter on the fifth
Make butter soft
Etch gutter on the cloth
Quills write poems for the real never [?]
[Steel?] long as an arm
Peel bodies apart but still it's no resolve
I'm flying like [?] pilot
My empire be striking
See the brainstorm strong wins no losses
Went to indigo strong winds deep frosts and
We flossin'
Fuck your plaques nigga
Brush your teeth with that Reach give you caps nigga
Whitening so clean but it's dirty like crack nigga
Give you [rounds?] from the pound no dap nigga
Black squad on the map nigga

[Hook]

I think we should help him}
