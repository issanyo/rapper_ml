[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
Pop out the clip on these niggers, I hit your liver
Deliver the message
It ain't a text it's a tech weapon
None to be exact
Push your cat, black
Blackest operation push, pushing that white crack
House nigga coalition versus the field niggers
So divided, united we fall
Separated like a new born
Poppy, he couldn't deal with him
So we up and left
Followed in his footsteps and whip left
Bench press, flex and trying to leave the stress
Strap on a belt, make a brain mess
Ten metal face on the exit death
Boy walk on his empire, stay hard press
Tough talk when you soft nigga
That's far fetched
Handle bars grinding like BMX on a park bench
Dump from the side of a truck
Suffer the consequence
[?] [?] challenging my conglomerate

[Hook]
I see the stars
Climbing to the top while the mind stays marsh
I'm walking slow on a balcony
Watching the stars make a mockery
I'm starry eyed on the balcony
Watching the stars while they watching me
Champagne rains on the top while we move to the plot
Move a piece like monopoly

[Bridge]
Play their game like Hasbro
Many get your cash flow
Spaz on this assholes
Turn up till you burn up
Mash on the gas on that Cadillac converter
We just try to ride and stay fly
Hand glide, fall on the wayside
Turn up till you burn up
You're a money converter
To reign over the server

[Verse 2: Jeremiah Jae]
Pop out the fifth on this niggers, empty the rounds
Etch in the clip on a birdie and make a sound
Like imagine the fire blasting out of a dragon's mouth
The magic inside of him, masterizing a spell
The only Ls I take is [?]
Bootleg is selling them Ls
Who the lame in a chain gang
Running the same way with a slave name
Bang bang niggers get traded
Send in the raiders
Come in the crib raining shit like the [?]
Stole the jewel off the king when I shake his hand
Still the man like Aloe Blacc
Tell everybody that black jungle is on the fucking map
Yeah, we pass books like crack is pushed
In the score zone niggers giving looks and field chrome
Fell in like a sub trying to reach it, though(?)
Too many drugs on his head but he still getting funds

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Play their game like Hasbro
Many get your cash flow
Spaz on this assholes
Turn up till you burn up
Mash on the gas on that Cadillac converter
We just try to ride and stay fly x2
Turn up till you burn up x3
Mash on the gas on that Cadillac converter
We just try to ride and stay fly x2
