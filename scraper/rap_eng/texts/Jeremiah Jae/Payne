[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

All I wear is payne on my mind
I can't sleep I be high all the time
No 9 to 5, I'm on the grind
Was living check to check
Eating beans with the rice
Can't let em see you sweat I'm alright
But god know's sometimes I dont see the light
I feel it deep down inside
Stay on the search tryin' find

[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm making them waves
I'm making them moves
I'm taking the coup
Park around the back
Pull up with the map
Pull up to the bank
Park around the back
Bitch niggas talking all that shit throw em in the tank
Nigga smoking all that shit still put in work
Get ya feelings hurt
Throw em in the dirt
I got a bar for these niggas
I got a card for these niggas
I'll pull ya card, I'll pull ya card
I'm going harder my nigga

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

All I wear is payne on my mind
I can't sleep I be high all the time
No 9 to 5, I'm on the grind
Was living check to check
Eating beans with the rice
Can't let em see you sweat I'm alright
But god know's sometimes I dont see the light
I feel it deep down inside
Stay on the search tryin' find

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm going harder my nigga
I'm getting stronger my nigga
Nigga you soft in the middle
You'nt got bars nigga riddle
You'nt put dots on the map
You'nt put the squad on the back
Had to put the squad on the tracks
Show these 'lil' niggas how to rap
Wrapping up the pack then it's back rapping for the pack
See it goes in full circle
See these red dots hurt you
Leave a stain like bird poop
Now I need reimbursement
Ya body laying where the hearse is
This the part where the verse ends
Fade out close the curtain

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

All I wear is payne on my mind
I can't sleep I be high all the time
No 9 to 5, I'm on the grind
Was living check to check
Eating beans with the rice
Can't let em see you sweat I'm alright
But god know's sometimes I dont see the light
I feel it deep down inside
Stay on the search tryin' find
