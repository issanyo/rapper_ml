Doctor green thumb
The philosophy is to keep dust
Raw leaf burnt when we heat up
Make the kief sweat partials tetra
Mark of the beast brah
Haunted graffiti beef bud
Behind the pateo
Writing on the walls
On my keith rock addias on my feet
See the beach
While chemicals in reach
Wild animals, thought he was extinct
Move in a pack keep the raiders on deck
Make touch down
And spray a bunch of ants
With the raid, put em in a trance
Came in the game to anoint the name
Set a joint to flame
Burn it to the roaches end
Do it over
Half these rappers is throw up
Deadly food, send a plate to the chauffeur
He never showed up
Its cut throat like fetching a bubble coat
First come first serve
Get it while you smell the dope
And can inhale the smoke
We just sail the coast
We not telling jokes
Just reveal the Hoax
Walk on roads
My theme song on the phone
I had to kill the bad jokes
Shit was getting old
Shit was killing me slow
Pour the liquor for pro
God rest ya soul

Here go the return
Black jungle on that al burns
Bring the monsters out
Treat you like u a small child
And this is rated R
Dishes from the heart
Dinner at the boulevard
Ya fish is on the curb
Curb stomp a hater
The scene was absurb
Flip an alligator purse
Dark vador fur
Something different
We rock vintage
Vintage soul, like he came back
To finish business
Had the game on parol
Momma was a P.O
Daddy playing rhodes
I had to learn the G codes
Niggas speak a different language like ancient scrolls
Pay in gold
You playing a role
You fade out like the end of show
On to the next like hov
But dont forget the main road
Yellowmask, and the squad gold
King midas, baby grab hold
