[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm going back to my old ways
I thank god it's a new day
It's so hard tryin keep faith
When the path don't stay straight
Liv-livin on the edge
Tryin be still cause you walking on eggs
Workin don't beg
Real life feel like working no end
Why you gotta pay for the free-way
Big lines gotta wait for a steel tray
No meals on the block, how the food taste
Only skinny nigga know how to move weight
Wait, im going back to my old ways
I thank god it's a new day
Nubian on the old page
Higher self like I'm on planes

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm going back to my old ways
I thank god its a new day
It's so hard tryin keep faith
When the path dont stay straight
Liv-livin on the edge
Tryin be still cause u walking on eggs
Workin don't beg
Real life, feel like working no end
Why you gotta slave for a free-way
Big lines gotta do whatever he say
No thrills on the block, how the fish taste
Only real niggas went and got bitch made
I'm going back to my old ways
I thank god its a new day
Nubian on the old page
Higher self like im on planes
