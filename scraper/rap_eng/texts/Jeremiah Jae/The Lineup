[Sample]
“The questions I ask these suspects have been in a natural tone of voice, so do not pay too much attention to their answers as they often lie”
“Bring on the lying”
“Alright, alright, this way boys, move it up to the end of the stage. That’s it keep it moving, move it. Alright now turn and face front, hands to your sides. Look straight ahead.”

[Verse 1]
In the lineup, time’s up, niggas snitched
Pour the wine up, Last Supper, they take a hit
Now the time up, lie down without a fifth
Eyewitness on the stand, case dismissed
Anybody with the back speeding
Getting cheddar from the last season
Big wins, I don’t break even
Fast lane, I don’t brake neither
Back in the armory
Sean Connery honestly can’t fuck with me
Obviously we sick in the head
Ten grams of medicine straight to the head
Kept the spirit like K-Fed
Now I’m aiming with the crossbow, off with his head
Run the jewels and the Pro Keds
You don’t wanna run from the man for the street cred

[Hook]
In the lineup, time’s up, niggas snitched
Pour the wine up, Last Supper, they take a hit
Another time up, locked down without a fifth
Eyewitness on the stand, case dismissed
Anybody with the back speeding
Getting cheddar from the last season
Big wins, I don’t break even
Fast lane, I don’t brake neither

[Verse 2]
Black Duffy on the Wanted List
Barricaded gunmen, shots from the kingpin
Marinated but I’m seasoned
Uh, Mayweather in the Jag speeding
Marijuana in the blunt stay seedless
Transgressions to the overseers evils
Never stressing on the block, got defense
Step up, get drowned in the deep end

[Sample]
“Trouble, maybe?” “You know I don’t have to look for trouble, Jack, trouble comes to me”
