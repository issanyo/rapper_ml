[Isreal]
She said try to be a little more sincere when you rap
Putting up facades & acts
She said do ya history
Learn about your past
Open up your mind read a chapter of acts
Always talking how ya pockets filled up with cash
And how ya gun blast every time a hater pass
Ducking from the jabs, I had to hit her back Like
Bitch you wasn't with me hustling trees throughout the city
Fontucky it get grizzly
Couple niggas Tried to get me
Had to keep some Shit with me
Had the knife next To the sticky like right there in the whippy
I was like sixteen Thought i caught a body
Hit the chapel like Sistine
So you can just go ahead and Miss me
Tryna play ms.queen
When I was just all in ya mouth like listerine

[Jeremiah Jae]
Go and vent a load of stem off
Cinnamon and sweet, venison and cheese
Scent of venom in her dream
She love to fill the sting
The Hennessy and E
Combination of alphabets
Will end u with a Z
While you sleep
Suddenly wake, get flexed at a rapid rate
Im dapper jae, working it like we dont take holidays
Or vacate hallways
We stay posted get the blunt rolling
From zip lock bags
To bean color hash
You could call green man
Snap a carrot extract The raw elements
Stretch, revamp the watts, thru thick and thin we stay keeping it hot
Like we inside vans
Hot boxing the land
Top notch on a wonder beat
Its in the fam
Swaggitory, j crooks, black jungling books
Rapencypedia nigga my rap book
Yea
Stretch this shit like yoga stance
Yea, Black Jungle Squad
