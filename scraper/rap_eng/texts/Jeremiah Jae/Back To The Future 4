[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]
I'm still workin' towards peace
Free your thoughts that hold down your dreams
Freed my mind and I'm feelin' like a king
It's by design, got you followin' the trends
Mental conditionin' before you was 10
That black man, brown man, we just tryna win
But we really want a Benz
600 M & Ms
Ferraris, I'm sorry

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]
Pull up in that shit you've never seen before
It's Back To The Future 4
What you need? I got the answers fo'
What you need? I got the antidote
Why you jockin', boy? You just a hoe
I don't know you, boy, you gotta go
Pulled up in [?] in this nigga's throat
Pulled a finale, go and fuckin' blow
This is that dope so you don't have to smoke
Nigga took a hit, he lost control
