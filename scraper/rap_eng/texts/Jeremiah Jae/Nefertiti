[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

Days growing up pushing luck
Tryin' make it to the bus fore it pulls off
I know them niggas on it think they too hard
Tried to make Daffi duck
Couldn't run, the block get you young
Take you out get you drunk
Make you fall in love
For the first time see em shinning going dumb
Rolling up, never going down it seems
Until they got the drop on em waiting for the squeeze
She gets me everytime it's like I'm hypnotized

[Bridge - Jeremiah Jae]

She gets me everytime it's like I'm hypnotized
She gets me everytime
Swear I'm falling deep

[The Streetz]

Ayo it's finna be lit man
We up early in the streets man
It the Streetz nigga
Can't turn your back
I know you wanna go home
But we gotta make these moves
It's time to ride nigga

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

She was on her knees, sayin lord please
Don't let em slip away from my reach
Only son kept bringing them F's back
Starting hangin' round with them niggas that broke they snap backs off
To the east or the west
I wanna flex with em, get high with the rep
To the death wit em, ride till there's nothing left
Go and press with em, ride shotty with the tek
All it takes is one time, to get ya life on a
Stretch
Then it's here comes the one time
Now I'm runnin for my damn life
So many choices better pick right
Right?

[Chorus Vamp - Jeremiah Jae]

All I wear is Payne on my mind
I can't sleep I be high all the time
All I wear is Payne on my mind
I can't sleep I be high all the time

[The Streetz]

Ayo Daffi, wake yo ass up man
Ain't got time for sleep man
Shit we gotta go we gotta make these move man
It's time to take over shit man
I'm telling you shits about to be fly
Money hanging from the ceiling and shit
Taking this shit back from these corny niggas man
Puttin' these niggas in the dog house man on squad
