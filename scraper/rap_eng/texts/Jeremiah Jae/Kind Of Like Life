[Intro: Samples]
So they suspect someone is coming for him
How do I get him out of jail
You both walk out
Can you believe we are in danger
I doubt we'll get out of here alive

[Verse 1]
Uh Yeah
You know swag songs
Sing along
Looney Tunes rap
Space Jam face plant
Five finger slap
Sneak attack
[??] see it coming like cataracts
Cadillac's pull up
Niggas poke back
Get your face in a book
While the Ds take a look
Halfway crooks fully get shook (my nigga)
Uh, wet from the tears
Jet disappears
Inventory hijack
Combat ready to bite like the wombat
On that fall way back in the lawn chair
Chest hair fuzz like Tony with the arm brace
Arms race heirs got it locked like guitar case
Jungle race
You slow when the hares place
You niggas moving at a snail's pace

[Hook] x2
It's kinda like
It's kinda like life

[Verse 2]
Uh, Al Capone with the shell case
Make the turtle niggas shell break
Squad keep the fail safe
Air crash [that?] move weight
Handbags with dope in them
[Grab bags?] with bodies hitting
Raw writtens involved just ya'll +dissolved+ tripping
Lawless more order I move with the Sun soldiers
King Cobras
Empty bottles and soda cans
Trying to make it to the mountain to see the Holy Land
Cop gold like Napoleon
Roll around the podium
Carry the gold chromium
Yeah squad keep that real weight
Money bagging the steel safe
[?] popping like steel trays
[Lucifer?] like DEA
Man you niggas shouldn't feel safe
In the heart of the city it's land of the brave

[Hook]

[Outro]
Trying to make it out the maze
