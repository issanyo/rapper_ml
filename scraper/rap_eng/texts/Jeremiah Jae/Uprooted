[Verse 1]
My life as I know it is not the same: uprooted
Say goodbye to everything that I knew
Everyone that I grew, close to
Isn't here today, and when I think about those days I hope they remember me
Mama saying "life is all about change"
Rolling with the punches, now it's us against the rain
Up against the devil, why he playing all these games
Went from fitting in to now I'm swerving out my lane
From this point on I hit the autopilot
Forcing myself to solace(silence?)
Giving enough so that nobody think that I live in private
I'm just your average smiling kid but now I'm living violent
I never speak about it
I just convince 'em that it's not even possible
I do what I gotta do, and move how I gotta move
I'm trapped ain't no ever going back
Started down my own path
I ain't even do the math
Would you look at that:

[Hook]
Uprooted
Uprooted

[Verse 2]
At an early age I learned the habit of living for other's approval
Being my own me didn't feel true
My father never had the time to show me how to move
Opening his wallet to cop me some new shoes
But I don't need that, I need the feedback
On my jump shot, show me where I should release at
I quit the team, would you believe that
If he ain't showing me no time I shouldn't waste it too
I would've chased the moon
If you're gonna show attention for more than 10 minutes at a time I'm chasing relentless to carve a space in your vision
You say you gon' visit, but that's a lie
You left me high and dry
Now I'm feeling like I'm worthless
Searching for an answer: Why you call me at all?
Why you don't get involved?
This won't ever get solved
Situations revolve

[Hook]
Uprooted
Uprooted

[Verse 3]
17, looking for a remedy
The numbing source of all of my agony
Fell deep inside a temporary fix and birthed a beautiful soul
That was born from my anatomy
The truest form of happiness I've ever felt
When I gaze into her eyes I can tell, she holds the source of all my innocence
In an instant it was over with
Battling with differences over shit that's irrelevant
Fast forward now I'm praying to the Lord
Questioning the reasons on why he left me divorced
Living in my father's image
I'm looking at our stories and it ain't so different
My heart is unforgiving
Now it seems history repeats again
The biggest difference now is I'm on the opposite end
Thinking 'bout the pain that my daughter's holding within
Pray to God she never feels, uprooted
