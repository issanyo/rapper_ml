[Verse 1]
White rose in the castle, she wanna battle
Learn your lesson, I be-e aggressive
Grab your cheerleader, I'm sitting in a high chair like Caesar
Swipe the visa, I'm thinking greener
Like sun panels, you can't handle the sun's light
I breathe atoms
I'm in the Saturn trying to reach Saturn
With my fleet and we deep bandits
We on the street, see the Jeep vanish
My collect called collect, boss hog dialect
Show respect to the god or catch swollen necks
Monster thoughts, devils watch as we make a mark
I'm in the monster truck, squadded up, living large
But still not fab, dreams feel like Freddy
Nightmares out in the dark with no fetti
That's a no glow, gotta get the dope man

[Verse 2]
We politic the shit we throwing up
I'm like, "So what?" We go nuts
Posted up in a reaper tux
Cut deluxe get your lungs touched
Beside me, a couple reefer bombs
In the beaker jar
Too close to the god, catch cardiac
Running and shit, coming back
Gotta go
