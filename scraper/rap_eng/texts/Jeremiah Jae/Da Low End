[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

We finna ride to the low end
Chi town in the low end
Cruise around in the low end
Ride around in the low end
Lake shore drive to the low end
Friday night in the low end
Everybody down in the low end
Meet me in the low end

[Verse - Jeremiah Jae]

South side down on king drive
Cruise around yea she feelin right
Up town why you feeling down
Bout to turn it up turn it round
Bout to turn the whole city out
Bout to show you what it's really bout
Bout to show you what the gritty like

She wanna she them city lights
I wanna blow it back put one in the sky
Rolling down lake shore drive we in the zone
If we see cops on the side we don't slow
Yea it's like fuck po po's on this side
Tryin run up on the fam you might die
Tryin run up on the squad you might go
Six feet death my god rest ya soul

And you know where we going

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

We finna ride to the low end
Chi town in the low end
Cruise around in the low end
Ride around in the low end
Lake shore drive to the low end
Friday night in the low end
Everybody down in the low end
Meet me in the low end

[Bridge - Jeremiah Jae]

I wish you could see it, I wish you could see
I wish you could see
I wish you could be, I wish you could be here with me
Baby you should be, baby you should be who you wanna be
Cause they don't know a thing
They don't know a thing, they don't know a thing

I wish you could see it, I wish you could see
I wish you could see
I wish you could be, I wish you could be here with me
Baby you should be, baby you should be who you wanna be
Cause they don't know a thing
They don't know a thing, they don't know a thing

[Post Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Nah they don't know
We finna ride to the low end
Chi town in the low end
Cruise around in the low end
Nah they don't know, Nah they don't know
Ride around in the low end
Lake shore drive to the low end
Friday night in the low end
Everybody down in the low end
Nah they don't know, Nah they don't know
Meet me in the low end

(Nah) They don't know (12x)
