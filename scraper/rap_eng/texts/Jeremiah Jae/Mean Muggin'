[Verse 1: Oliver the 2nd]
Put the shine in your face like an eye doc
Rep the squad every day, homie, why stop?
See I was born cold, likely I'mma die hot
Baggin up in live spots ever since I tried pot
Took my very first hit back in 2000
Now it's nothing less than 2 pounds in my new housing
Sorta lit, cold chick, thought you knew about it
Only thing she brought, Vicky draws and a few blouses
Verso on the move, nothing you can do about it
Roll with double OGs, niggas too 'bout it
Get your crew pounded, then I guarantee
You dudes use the Youtube as your feud outlet
You just food out here
Full moon and it's wolves out here
Woop, woop, call the troops out here
Done fucked around and locked me with the realest spitting
Kitty gimmick, signed, sealed, delivered to your city limit


[Verse 2: Jonwayne]
You could snatch a grab-bag of galaxies and pull out a million
Planets and not a specimen can fuck with my rappin'
I must have got the foot of a rabbit inside the cannon
To damage your whole hood like a thousand birds crappin'
Captain, hand me the megaphone if you wanna see action
This ain't the land of relaxing, lavishly practicing
I bring death like taxes and leave heads in baskets
And the rest in caskets
It's kinda gruesome, but me and my hand can make a twosome
You know these rhymes recall because I knew son
And then he slipped the noose on with his loose arm and sang a new song
But I'm not trying to see the reaper
Unless you promise that I'm in the Beemer with Aaliyah
Bumping for eternity in two seaters
My ears bleed out the speakers
Keep your seat up when I'm speaking

[Verse 3: Jeremiah Jae]
You wide-eyed till disaster strikes
We move in the night, the moon bright, wolf bite
Shot down, rotting like an apple in the middle of the street
And your peoples didn't help you
Flames on the side of my whip
Everything my team touch requires strength
Fire to your dome, peace, higher up the ladder
[?]s we broke down, lines you can't cross
Hot bars, I ain't warming up a Kit Kat
It's click clack, no seat belt strap
I'm a creature, black features
It's not complete until I consummate the beat
Running till my feet ache
Living in the E-Age, information key [?]
We open doors to the key exchange
Rising up the pH scales
