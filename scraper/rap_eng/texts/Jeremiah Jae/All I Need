“What’s this?” “What?"
“In your pocket, that bulge-”
“Stay out of my pockets”
“Harry, it feels like a gun!”

“Where’s the money coming from?
Everybody says where’s the money coming from!”

[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
Big bills with the house on a hill
Fly rums, colored gazelles, all materials
Minerals, colorful stones, sage cover the home
To lamp in the zone and chill, no stress
Everyday get a check make a colorful mill
The feels ill, stay true to the real
Breathe deep, find peace in itself
Hand a pistol to Bill
All love in this bitch with no frills
No ills, roll around in a four-wheel
Guys will lay back in a force field, niggas chill
I need the red pill and a fresh deal before I etch ill
Need a sick fill, plenty henchmen
No penny pinchers, semis with the clip in
50s in a big quilt
Yeah, that’s all I need

[Verse 2: Gift of Gab]
Welcome to the wonderful world of Jae crime sprees
Common as the break of daylight at daytime see
Even when corruption blow up like napalm
Don’t attempt to be a hero, slow down and stay calm, people
Mafia attacks beg to live free
And in the crookedest of cities where cops, they get fiends
Who ignore the organized crime, Optimus P
You're locked away for thinking them thoughts, y’all could just be
Slaves, walking robots, never taught to go out
And question every rule they make like “what you talking about?”
Cause while the rich is eating cuisine that is not in your mouth
No running water flows out, no other possible route
But revolution is the answer and solution for the cancer
That is spreading like a plague, and infecting every day
So they kept him in their place with their weapons in their face
To pursuit the money has us all forever in a matrix
Walking sheep that've never went astray
They are cowardice so one-on-one you'll never get a fade
You would think if there was justice they would never get away
With it hitting in the trenches so you’ll never get to Jae
He is busy with his feet up, eating elegant souffle
See the temperament we represent is irrelevant, ok?
And it's hella been this way for the elements to change
Physical revolt no more talking and telling him to change
This is war
