[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

Trash man didn't get the trash today
It's all good I ain't got time to waste
Shorty trying floss on that minimum wage
He never seen the ocean but his hair got waves
Ready for another chapter tryin' turn that page
Uline safes holding the gold case
Youngin you just begun in, tryin' be like the greats
Save face, fore we tarnish your name
Throw the varnish on the wood grain
You sleep in the grave
Surprise niggas see me pull up in the wraith
Wrath of the beast I'm uncaged
Deliver that front page, read it and weep
You niggas sweeter then peach
I'm smoking cheeba where the scenery bleak
Palm trees and concrete
It's chicken and beef
Act tough niggas gritting they teeth
Throw the sign let em know that it's peace
We out deep in the streets
Everyday you just deep in ya sleep
Niggas know I'm nice
Rather be under rated than over hyped
My nigga I'm still growing
Tryin' show niggas put the pen wheel in motion
Been a broke nigga now I'm after the dough nigga
From the chi nigga so you know I'm a Go-in
Pass the work while it's snowing
Somewhere foreign
On the slopes snowboarding
You niggas boring
We out touring
Hella days in holland
Im dazed on the holiday feeling like a tourist
The clip and the magazine fit
Its not an article I'm aiming at ya wig
In the Gs5 the scope hid
Took sample back to lab
The process is mad scientist
Im focused on the craft
Taking aircraft trips
Bitch, you waving a white flag

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]
Fuck hoes, it's cut throat
Leave em on the side of the road
Fuck rap
I Got the product in my backpack

Fuck hoes, it's cut throat
Leave em on the side of the road
Fuck rap
I Got the product in my backpack

[Post Chorus - Oliver the 2nd]

Fuck hoes, it's cut throat
Leave em on the side of the road
Fuck rap
I Got the product in my backpack

[Verse 2 - Oliver the 2nd]

Time keep passin and guys keep asking
When Ima release aspirin?
Increase the peace, passion
Capeesh!
It's the beast baskin in beats
And I speak madness
Top form, they Art drawn on cheap canvas
We not norm
You throwing rocks at a wasp swarm
Then felt caught when it popped off
And just got gone
From mic checkin to lime sessions
The Mind stretchin
Fill a quartz banger wit live resin
U die stressin
Pressin all rhymers
Sexin all dimes
Pussy lip wit the pumps in my lap at all times
My Skull is a gold mine
I'm not a young lord, I'm a grown God
This Just a young face on an old guy
Pronoun Ver-so
SoCal local
Known round globe now
For profound vocal
What's the Lo down loco?
They Flow sound so-so
This that great rap
We lay that then play back slow mo
Bro bro
Fuck hoes, It's cutthroat
These tough quotes like boulders
Just crush bones oh
Fuck rap
I'm sellin sticky off of Snapchat
Half a thingy in the backpack
Green pastures
This work's what I'm getting back ta
These Niggas should
Simma down na
Like Donna summers backwards
Rappers
Swear they bring me laughter
Everything around me
Probably got it
Off of trap stuff

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]
Fuck hoes, it's cut throat
Leave em on the side of the road
Fuck rap
I Got the product in my backpack

Fuck hoes, it's cut throat
Leave em on the side of the road
Fuck rap
I Got the product in my backpack
