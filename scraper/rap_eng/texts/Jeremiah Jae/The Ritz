[Verse 1]
While you were balancin' quarters on your knuckle
I stretched the game on these rebels
Who stressin' the turn buckle
Movin' like ten [???] clowns in the bucket
Ya'll are kickin' the can in hopes that you can never function
Luck would have it if you didn't cross my path
These Bubba Gumps come cluckin' like the bubbles in the bath
Keep my trunk [???] tight
They never stumble on the wealth that I possess
Exorcist jealous when the crown fixed the dress
The crowds in distress
I unsheath the mic from the hole in my chest
Proceed to bring the moon to the crest, mic check
These messes are more trashy than the rest
I suggest you pull the [Pyrex?]
I spit mercury on burn victims
The salt is in the kitchen
I could kill ya' ego like a [Pernicus?] verbally
Rappers actin' like they Echoplex security
Especially when I'm takin' names and kickin' Coolio
I abuse the prose 'til it's purple and black and painted abstract
Preach magic, I beseech verbal addicts
If you can't count on ya' boy, I'm doin' backflips
I'm that sick

I put it on my momma'
Like I'm puttin' on the ritz


[Outro]
