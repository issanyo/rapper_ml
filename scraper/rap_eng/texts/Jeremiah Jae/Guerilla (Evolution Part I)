[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
You see, the gorilla, he likes to sit and watch everyone first cause he got to sneak up on them
Oh! Yea, yea, just watch out for that, just keep a little...
The point, the point isn't to scale him, just to scare him a little bit
Then we bed over and grab, just grab the money. And, you know, I'll meet you at the car
Yeah, alright, so alright on three
Well wait. What? (huh?) Well, what am I supposed to do, if he's coming like, after me
I mean there's that fall and just kinda lay there. Just lay there, you know, and just dream
That reminds me, I remember, I had a dream. I was real, real little, looking up at all the stars
You know man, what's up. Saw fucking Orion's belt. Just, what would we do, without it?
You know, the solar system I mean. So much bigger, piece it together
And my mom found me, on my way home. And my mom she was like, "Where you been?"
And, I didn't know, I was lost. I was one of them people. You know, it's like you a zombie or something
Your mind is awake, but only awake to certain things, like, like all the evils in the world
I saw a much larger primate, like King Kong. (Yeah, I've been there too.)
Anyway, you know, I guess this is like, this is like, you know, the beginning of it all
Like the ?
And I thought, I thought I was seeing some space ships, like, I thought, I thought I saw them
Like I knew them to be so real, and I dreamt about it and I swear dreams, like...
Man, dreams, I'm trying to tell you. Like it's either me, or it's you, or we're together...

"Why did you have that night to call them off?"
