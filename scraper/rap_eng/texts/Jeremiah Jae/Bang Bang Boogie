[Intro]
This one goes out to
Jeremiah Jae, Peabody on the beat
I know y'all see me checking all over, but I'm still inside

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been immobilizing hoes shit off the door head
Been a fan for the low stroke, tricking death god
Back tucking in more steps, than shinigami
Calm the fuck down, what's up now?
We out finna dream for the fourth [? dimension]
Fourth in dimensions, your intention, lower potential
Incremental then exponential experiment
The adventure been venting with tentacles [? licks]
Intricates, scien-tifical forces laying
But they one-fifth from the nearest in testimony
Bless the test with the best for you
But don't ever fade, I underestimate, of being vegetables
Spark your blood flow
No punches, none of these hoes can hold they lunches
Overcome hoes even hunches, hugging they O2
But they don't owe you, it's on you
My breath could be caps, collapse, we expand
Make sure black [? granite] look grand
I'm post star, post starting so, so-so so far
No bar, just ready set go and come home with a scar
I'm 0-4-4-7, so of course still sub-par
Attempt channel babel gats, rap Rambo [? Bishar]
Yes, yes

[Hook: x2]
And Imma bang-bang boogie
Sane playing hooky, with a fane [? tain]
Same game face painting Wookies
We ripped in these cream cookies
Backscene, take it in time, took bookies Nigga
