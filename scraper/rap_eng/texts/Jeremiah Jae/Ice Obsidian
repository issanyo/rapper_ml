[Hook x2]
This ice imperial shining brighter than Ariels
Icy hot for your stereo, cold heat in the barrels
Black Obsidian, blacker than hills meridian
Mission given like Gideon,
Squad thicker than Indians
Carried a torch like mobs pitching a fork
This guy putting in work, these bars written in dirt
You dig it; it’s from the Earth
I’m shovelling pots and bubbling
Heart of a thug, hustling dope
I’m a product of

[Sample]
Where the drumroll, numb skull?
