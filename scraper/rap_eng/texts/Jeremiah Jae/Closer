[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
Came close, came close
Contact baby let me lax your shoulders
Boulders, the weight as you try to elevate
Standing at the gate, behold the frail fate
In the system that makes you levitate
And used you for bait, can I have a cold shake?
The freezer burn blow me slowly awake to fail safe
At the point of, can't tell man
Living on the edge, of a brim, of a coffee stem
Gather up the stems make it knock like ninety ten
Tiny Tim and them the rag down, gentlemen
Sweet scented angel skin
But she tried to play me then on a seven inch
Got closer to the needle than I've ever been
Tryin reach the other side
See some close friends again
Stuck at hard times with benjamin
Empty feelings but caked up
Brought bad vibes to his woman friend
Will they ever see again
Maybe getting closer than you on that wanted poster
Draped up casino van, spent about fifty grand in five seconds
Damn your lifetime hectic, like tevo man
Replaying life's clutter fucker, I think you too close fam

[Verse 2: Zeroh]
Moving intimint
What existence for a minute getting
C-C-Critically physical, my being in space
To a state so I've been [?] [?] [?]
C-C-Conversational, disgrace, so sensational
Phonics like, try atomic water molecule innovation
Grew up fond of the [?] of faces on occasion
Yeah, prominentâ€‹ manifestations that I've suffered
Sacred abrasions, grazed by the sight
Friction afflicted, by trickery to fiction
A big cat in a curious position
Question and truth hold off the pigment decision
Chick, admitted, man I need some assistants
That, inhibition could be stifling, rifling
Through coke mechanisms, It's the rise of leviathan
The, body proprietor, my fire re-desire
Wrote emotions on my sleeve, it's no need to inquire
Transparency a goddess might admire, I won't hide it
And get closer, no separation, but we're divided
