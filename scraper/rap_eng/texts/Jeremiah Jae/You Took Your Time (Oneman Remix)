Now did you see me, I killed a man
They all stayed down, but he chose to stand
And girl, when did it hit you deep
To watch his mind seep
Across the pavement, beat down, slaps the meat
Each and every single one of your feet
That you will ever know
The limitations of a clone
They kept me on my throne
The silk space of time
Covered in a trace of slime
It's not here to appear for the tears
The mere hatred that flows through the years
The silent calm, washed violent charm
Held in the depths of a tyrant's palm
Expect the ides, to lay by his side
And bear with the sight of just another man's mind

I must mistake the high
Cool these breaks, these stakes will lie
I was not born to be taught
I was born to be exposed in the storm
And held awhile
In the hot heat in the mother
Sat by the feet of your lover
Feet down, decede one another
I dug through these graves to uncover
A pile of bones mixed with violent tones
Forced through the earth with these silent drones
I'll seek through time, evading the mimes
I'll breathe in time and of the guide's sign

You trust these snakes to die?
With all the ways you trace the climb
Go up the ladder, made from the latter
Made even sadder, but he born to an adder
I'm on the depth of a bridge
You took your time to plant a seed
A seed of hate, the plagues you played
So bear witness to the strength and states
You want to be the body of song
Are you strong across this glum
Pinnacle of crumbs
See these hands and see what they crave to be done
You are, you are this useless art that's gone too far
You are, you are
You are a body of song
You pave me down to the dirt and scum
Look what I've become
See these hands, these actions that I've done
Walk bear beaten down
Black blue brains out
This drain will be clogged
Let their brains be drowned
Walk bear beaten down
These Black beat brains out
These drains be clogged
These brains be drowned
