[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Cops outside the window
Niggas out to get you
I see em plot against you
Tryin' break the mental
They can never defeat us
This is too official
We got em asking for it
Keep it confidential
What's in the leaf is LA confidential
Passin' by waving feeling presidential
Chi resident peddlin' to the holy temple
Feel the vibration in your mental, we rocking with you

[Verse - Jeremiah Jae]

Summer school in detention
I was really up in hell, franciscan
In the kitchen all my niggas on a mission swimmin'
Ringing bells with the flow making new editions
On that Bell, Biv, Devoe, Gill, Bobby vision
Haters get the mob visit
Scoop with the night vision
Wrote this off something twisted
That shit confidential
I don't wanna talk about it
I speak through the pencil
The crew too official with it
We ain't blowing whistles
Still it's black and white
To these niggas it's day and night
You see the stripes I got the under armor on
But I don't play in golden state
Unless I'm getting cake, my niggas ball

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

Cops outside the window
Niggas out to get you
I see em plot against you
Tryin' break the mental
They can never defeat us
This is too official
We got em asking for it
Keep it confidential
What's in the leaf is LA confidential
Passin' by waving feeling presidential
Chi resident peddlin' to the holy temple
Feel the vibration in your mental, we rocking with you
