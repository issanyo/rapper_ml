[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm tired of playing games for our love
Everything is so undone
Arguing on the phone
Playing games all the time
Everything don't add up
I wonder if it's gonna be
Bells
I wonder if it's gonna be

[Verse - Jeremiah Jae]

Bells, might pull a shell
She says I stole her heart
Might go to jail
Oh well
Forreal never wanted
Forreal you can have that back
A bitch nigga want it
He a goner
She thought she heard bells
She throwing that rod, she ready to fish
She thirsty to sail
I thought we wouldn't fail
But she thirsty forreal
She couldn't starve, she couldn't wait
She gotta kill
Thought the lovin' was real
And we tryin' build
But she up in the Field
Looking for niggas to feel
Field, Field

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

I'm tired of playing games for our love
Everything is so undone
Arguing on the phone
Playing games all the time
Everything don't add up
I wonder if it's gonna be
Bells
I wonder if it's gonna be
