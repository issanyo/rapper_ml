78 get numbers straight
Pick ya fate or meditate at the golden gate
Gave and her choice
Its faith or hills
Be the way its apes on the hills
That love the designer hillfigures
Im golden era on that cypress hill
Chill, he wonder how it feel to kill
But went under with the wheel
When da wheely did a windmill
Check ya manners
Manly p rap profess vision to the planet
Sun im like the elder
Meet the heat pole
Jedi mink robe
Shit so fly, like im high on tape
Write pies and it bake
Top flight, remember them days of wild life
The jungle got gritty
Cause the animals bite
And its bout to get ugly 'for the end of the night
Bright lights u like a deer in the head lights
Get the numbers right

Ruin the game, put poo to the flames
You new to the game
You in it for the coup and the chains
We in it scoop the goop out ya brainwave
I maintain the grind then push to the mainlands
Takeover makeover
Rock it till the tape over
Play it over
Rappers get pushed over
Spit it to the free world
5 percent we multiply it ten fold
All the tens fold
Ends for the hydro
Grow like jack and weedstalk
Cross the garden D's gonna need more calk
This the outline
Ill show u how to do it
Live thru it, make ya own shit
Stick to it, kid bit had the shit twisted Thats forbidden
Numerous
Consumers caught the bootleg like the plague
Goose down, been thru many winters
You a sore loser
Boeing jet cruiser next
I throw a hex on the game after im finished
Evil sex. She had the horns
Medievil head
Dressing caeser
Fresh as jesus, white robes no wrinkles
