Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of intents
Aromatics and Incense
Cheifin' like an Indian
To new dimensions with hymns
A few synonyms
Feuds ending in blood pools
Gruesome images

With all that fairy rap
What you aiming at?
This ain't the main event
More like training camp
A small stash of product
For the fans asking bout it
Not for any asshole doubtin'
Frontin' on my classic content
Young Verso, the next ruler
Cats gon flock to the tune, like fresh tuna
Consume data, regroup, we too major
If you oppose the views i exude, i assume hater
Truth sayers, transcending on loop flavors
Embellishing in the fedi, you friendly like new neighbors
Fuck yo opinion, my flow is dominion
Fuck yo ambition, your boy on a mission

Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Black Jungle Squad Gang don't play, boy!
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Front and get ya mug shot, rearranged boy!
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Black Jungle Squad Gang don't play, boy!
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Any day, Every time, any place boy!

Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of intents
40oz and Fifths
Drinkin' like an Indian
To new dimensions with hymns
A few synonyms
Feuds ending in blood pools
Gruesome images

Sitting here kicking' this Raw
While you just pissin' me off
Oliver the 2nd, nigga i'm not the one!
So feast your eyes, on the beasty guy
This is dedicated to reefer pies and sneaker finds
Young Verso, the next ruler
Tats on the side of my shoulder, it's sketched moolah
Use to hit locomotives to see bitches
Now i send show promoters on weed missions
Some people gon think that we trippin''
I Hope I die & come back just to relive this
Fuck yo opinion, my flow is dominion
Fuck yo production, I choke hold a rhythm

Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Black Jungle Squad Gang don't play, boy!
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Front and get ya mug shot, rearranged boy!
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Black Jungle Squad Gang don't play, boy!
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang (Ay!)
Any day, Every time, any place boy!
