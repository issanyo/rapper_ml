[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
Magic moments, so close you can touch it
She want her name in them bright lights, at the opening
Looking down, in touch with the bottom
So many problems coming up to be young and hopeless
To pull up in the focus. Took his mama whip
Came back in a coffin. Dean's last trip
Now Hollywood smokie, the phantom on the move
The ghost in the rear mirror looking back at you
Whose dude, played in catch-22, trying make it out the life onto the movie shoot
Props where props is due, thought rich life was popping to soon
Popped out the womb, with the silver spoon
Feet gone, steady running til the street gone
Black and motivated, as seen on tv, dog
Rare sight, especially the nigga's skin tone
Prone to get it in, but so dark they couldn't see
Imagine that, and my nigga pitch-black like the screen off the 24 inch flat screen
Beam, It's either struggle or ball. Why you think so many brothers joined the league for?
It's like we got the same mother

So what now, when they turn the lights down and the world fades out?
What now, when they turn the lights down and you still ain't get it?

You say you did, but did you really? No
You're so committed, your favorite tv shows
You're like a page in it, ain't never read it though
Just like the drama, and all the happy endings so...

What now when they turn the lights down and the world fades out?
What now when they turn the lights down and you still ain't get it?
What now when they turn the lights down and the world fades out?
What now when they turn the lights down and you still ain't get it?
