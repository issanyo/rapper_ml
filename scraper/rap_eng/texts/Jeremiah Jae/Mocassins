My variety gets deployed, and
Something inside of me gets destroyed, man
Why you get off on stealing my joy? damn
Now society fills the void

Made me tougher than moccasin leather
Peace pipe with the pot in the center
Yeah i'm high, yeah i'm high
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better
I'm lying for saying i'm better
Yeah i'm high, yeah i'm high
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better

I was just 5 at the time
Why you and Pop wanna fight all the time
What's this crop on the side of the lawn?
Why he don't come when we go for a walk?
See he always told me to fight
You always told me ignore um
Entirely two different guides
Totally torn at the origin
See you couldn't know what it's like
I ain't even mad at you for it
We came up in two different times
And mine is the wildest recorded
Lots changed, a lot hasn't
Cold nights, breed hot passion
This raw energy bang
Quick withdrawal out my memory bank

My variety gets deployed, and
Something inside of me gets destroyed, man
Why you get off on stealing my joy? damn
Now society fills the void

Made me tougher than moccasin leather
Peace pipe with the pot in the center
Yeah i'm high, yeah i'm high
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better
I'm lying for saying i'm better
Yeah i'm high, yeah i'm high
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better

I was 18 at the time
Niggas got crispy for prom
And I ain't got credits to walk
Guess who ain't drinking tonight!!!?
See I was too focused on raps
You always told me ignore um
Entirely two different minds
Totally torn at the origin
See you couldn't know what its like
Pen and a pad & my homIEs
We grew up in two different times
Who was I to know you was phony
Lots changed, a lot hasn't
Cold nights, breed hot passion
This raw energy bang
Quick withdrawal out my memory bank

My variety gets deployed, and

Yeah i'm high, yeah i'm high
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better
I'm lying for saying i'm better
Yeah i'm high, yeah i'm high
But i'd be lying if I said I feel better
