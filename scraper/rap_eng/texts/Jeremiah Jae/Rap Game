[Chorus: Jeremiah Jae] x2
From hot kitchens
To the banquets
Deliver raw like he out here
Wit the cake mix
Take 6, matter fact take 10
St8 bang shit, buffalo rangers

[Verse 1: Oliver the 2nd]
Been known to spit that
Wild western shit
Fire rhyme cxllective shit
Shall remain the messengers, Yes!
Desert exodus
Your sunscreen gon fail, when shells thump ya
Guns ring like mademoiselles bell for butler
Tell a tall tale on the trail and feels weak
As he starts smokin' his heart broken, but still beats
And a man is not designed teary eyed, but still weeps
But luckily for me, I'm surrounded by trill peeps
That wouldn't pass a kleenex to my ass, off a lil sneeze
Let alone tears, we've never known fear
It's buckskin cause its cold now
Bitches like Backwoods, stop hittin' them hoes and they gon go out
Until you bring that flame back
Them desert fiends, found a needle in a haystack
Is this a dream, cause if it is dude it's hella lucid
Like whats the sense of having sense, If you don't ever use it

[Chorus: Jeremiah Jae] x2

[Verse 2: Zeroh]
Its the return to perfection of a slight kind
Two minds about grind splittin' sight lines
Heart apartheid, yin & yang candy crack
Balance at the handy
Breakin jaws where the raw hide
And take falls in spite of flawess
Bigger men synergistic blazay
Dehydrated goji bee pollen and agave topped raw cake
Booshie kid cuisine for ya swami
Smoke float approximately high as the
Quetzocal toast to the ghost in the trees
Rubber lippin', sippin' black iron tea
Deepenin the Bond, Word is sharp to the teeth
Custom Mouth Gaurds for the freaks..
Who Sport-Blaze Dark Forest trails trickin' limbs
(with) Buckets of Fresh Water From a Creek
And Beets that He Grew in the Jungle on the cheap

[Chorus: Jeremiah Jae] x2
