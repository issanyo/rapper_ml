Im in a paddle cell
No servicer
Just sum ether where the candle dwells
Point the finger at the people thru window
The chemist chop the leaf
Macintosh silver screen
The illusion of me been gone
Real as Its gets
Stan getz play the brass
Outta copper
Outta zip locked bags proper
No western doctors
And no pest believe we throw
Hibiscus flowers
Like disc old sport
Like how do i activate
And demonstrate the proper ways
When the system showers grenades on fresh plates
Chemical war, why u think i got the beaker for
Measure the pure
Serve it raw
Looks like you can use some
Either they kept it away
It never got used up
The medicine bruised her
Internal they say its cool
Follow the rules
Listen to the schools
But if mr teach
Taught em but he missed the P
When its time to apply mentally u get fried
And do be careful how they make u use ur time
And wheres the pennies
Foreal im working all day
And still ain't seen a mini van
Or at least the roof
Can't stop the leak, fuck the coup
Nuck if u buck
And suck it up like labor
Garden landscapers
Retarded odd favors
For a buck good luck
When u set sail
Nextel cover the cell
All for bills that burn in the hands of the rich
For snail fish
In trash bins
A poor mans dish

The world goes round and around

Appi-tight off, habit crossed paths
With the bigger ox
Lost trying scuffle thru times of the last shark
The mass in the mix
We're all victim to the loan sharkUh
So them grants ate u alive
You decide to put a tek to the sky
I mean text, read the message thru the light beam
Keep the light bulb going cuz the bite green
Like paper chase
While they vapor spray
And then inject veins
With more pain
And she was doing good till the hurricame
What a shame
What a reign they got
While rain stay in the hood
Like moneygram
And swishers
While you in the park trying make a swish cuz
Thats the only escape
Its sterilized grapes they chewing
Propane tanks to the face
Off to bank
Cough- laugh on the way

[Oliver's Verse]
Nigga y'all some peons
Ya main chick get peed on/throw it in her throat
Bust a ghost like Egon
If ya ain't get it, hit the rewind Biatch
Six Deuce wit the hunnid spokes how we ride
Real dude, stay true to my family
That's why I'll never need a goon on salary
It's just Guns & Butter Like Ving Rhames
Lil hood niggas cuffin' Tyrese Alize
Don't nobody want your punk ass bike cuz
My minds on my money and my money where my mind was
An lil mama on my arm, she a dime but
She'll never, ever, ever, intertwine with my funds
Tell em all the time that we timeless
So put away the hating on the side, just admire us
You r now deep inside the mind of the mindless
Jungle Squad and we deep on that vine shit/spit that Devine shit
That soul, we inclined shit/
Please just recline, sit
And shut the fuck up, get your mind lit
