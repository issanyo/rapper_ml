[Verse 1 - Jonwayne]
Yo
Swat these Gods out the sky like flies
And roll deeper than graves upon my USS Enterprise
I'm on the corner of the map
These legends will never die
Treat Los Angeles like international waters
Call me Baby Momma cos I birthed your style
So where's the alimony
I hope that's what you're about to show me
Me with my lightbulbs and you with your coconuts
Stayin' open across the dome of soaking the bud

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]
Ayo the ox stone, chopped limbs, top spending network
Guillotine knock off heads, make your chest hurt
Test the squirt gun, you're wet like spilt milk
Don't cry to [?] [?], my eye in alignment
Your face on the triangle, Jungle
Squad put mobs in rectangles
They rapper bodangles
Black face stack cake for the catalogue
You shit on the grass in a shack pushing cattle cars
Black mags pull up the pig, lookout
Shots through the lookout
Glocks roll, flocks south
While hundred sick and now street huntin'
Goodwill's LA, hood meals, liquor stores
All we want is guns and drugs
All they want is guns and drugs
Feel more green
Trying to feel more green

[Verse 3 - Oliver the 2nd]
Close your eyes and envision
We coincide with the rhythm
Despised by a critic, immortalised by the listener
Probably diminished, couldn't survive in the system
Where real wives men flourish and fools die there trippin'
Newport shorts smoke in the city breeze
I never hit Four Loko and shitty trees
The mic feel like a knife steel, gritty steeze
Catch a slight chill tryin' ice grill Mr. Freeze
I'm nice still like a nice pill, drift with ease
The finest piff to accompany the epiphanies
A lil jerk copped the purp on his payday
Take a hit let the piff surf on his brainwave
I rhyme with divine enchantment
Cyborg mind enhancement
Pandemic sized disaster
I shake up your faith, please revive your pastor
And dynamite light beaming blinding task force
Blaq, Blaq

[Verse 3 - Jeremiah Jae]
You not a cat, you a mouse
You a bird in a house
Get your sheet wet, smoking shipwreck in your home
Call the hoes, go for broke
Coastin' it now
Spend your whole pig piles round the roast stick pile
If the eye, now the whole thing highbrow
'Til it run outta gas
It's high high all the way to the class
Make a quick stop at the ATM
Make a Benz drop out of first class

[Verse 4 - Jonwayne]
Hop out that plane, make that vertigo dash
It's like our competition is learning to crash
I'm makin' a meal then I'm burning the cash
It's all about sending message
There's not a whole lot of us left that's going back to the essence
Three kings, golden incense
Fuck the peasants
Fuck your presence
Call me the indefinite crooks
These psalms are Horcruxes
Brains on crutches
I clutch the mic, enticing these ears like Dick Butkus
Rip 'em to shreds, with horse heads in the beds
Optimism is the definition of misled
You won't believe my meat is run this red
It's Jaylib philosophy
And Stones Throw shit is a part of me to the point of ungodly
But I've been a god since junior high, pinching asses and bumpin' that Young Gotti
Flow as molasses, cuttin' crop like tractors
Write my fuckin' squad's name at the top of that bracket
Blaq Russian, turnin' these other crews Prussian
Crush 'em
My boys'll turn somethin' into nothin'
Blaq Russian, turnin' other crews Prussian
Crush 'em
My boys'll turn something into nothin'
