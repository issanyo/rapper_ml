[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

Harpoon through the boat
Steal ya cargo
I’m from that
Golden coast where the flowers don’t grow
We hoping to hop in them largos
With the top off, pass a hater pull ya top off
Target on ya back, this practice
I use to keep the 4 in the mattress
In case them floor broads start cracking
In the middle of the night stay on sight
Take flight, this mighty as the heaven bright
Find me ahead of light
We moving ahead of time
So really this verse finished
I ran past the line
We winning, see it’s cut off
The ribbon to your happy ending
Back tracking, I been looking for the fucks giving
Count on my hands the ones I really fuck with
Money and grams 2 bitches i’m in love with
Sex, murder, and drugs
Nickle bags to quarters
To that street life, always seemed to keep me on tracks
Cuz if i was with them niggas it’d be no looking back
Love my family, love the homies, i’ll put the world on back
And the ones that hated on em
Get the most the love back
A love supreme, Coltrane with wild dreams
Fly beams

[Verse 2 - Jeremiah Jae]

I know what you thinking, it should be you in this picture
Only the strong survive, homie you're weak getting weaker
I been putttin in hours, I’m working over the meter
You see the stripes on my tee shirt, I’m too official, you bleacher
Report the news like a broadcast, If it ain’t hot then we storming
Im a like flood to your drizzle, Just take this verse as a warning
It’s global warming, whenever we touring
Reigning on the United Kingdom, stay retro in Jordan
Exploring that new terrain like it’s part of my DNA
On the map we go for days, Yea we came a long way
From the blacker side
The city where they battle over turf
From the same pack from back when they was scavenging the earth
We still on the expedition continue studies aboard
These thoughts be hella active sometimes my minds lost
Exhausted from pine, saucing to hard
Started the engine, Just Follow the henchman
Yea we on another mission
Give you 7 wishes, then you get the sentence
You the know squad relentless
Stay out the business or get the cutters out the kitchen
Hitting digits, flipping spliff's in the ash tre
Then roll up on ya bitch like a crap game
She felt the cosmic pimpin from a distance
