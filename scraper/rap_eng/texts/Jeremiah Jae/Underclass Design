[RL Verse 1]:
Motherfuck me
Horsefucker eat glue
True
I gradiate in six light hues

Vindaloo cubes
Respectability pant sag paneer
Perusing nude tubes
You socially infuse
With human capital
Charts

My startup is muscle
A smarmy tussle
Jostled out of memory foam
Rustled in the morning
Stuck and poke

Whereas prisoner aesthetics
Are dilemmas for neoliberal jokes
(hold up)

Swing porches to a branch
Emulsified
Yo, thick in pulp
Pulmonary tar for social entry
The club smokes

Say y’all are driftwood
Abstract masses with
Preference for your cous cous
And your vape flavors
(shit)

[Chorus]:
I said push my temple one more time
(x3)

Rank and file
Archive my underclass design

[RL Verse 2]:
I said push my temple one more time
Rank and file
Archive my underclass design

I said
Yo catalog my cattle prod
I’m analog with crackles
In my top end
Mid-side processed and
Passed out on a park bench
Recording half dreams to the ones
Whose strata has no end

As if classism were mutually exclusive
And saddled shins;
Equestrian when the best of ‘em
Equal gigabytes and sum

Per rule of opposable
Domain specied
Yeah that one

[Chorus]
(x2)

[Jeremiah Jae Verse 3]:
Motherfuck these boys
Send in the decoy 
I’m glowin' like Leroy 
Squad got that heat, boy
My name on the seat, boy
Read it and weep
Been sweepin’ ‘em
I need the rings so i can make it complete
 
Back to school
Act a fool 
How he move
Bend the rules 
Been in snooze now I’m loose
Broke thru see they fooled you
Got you thinking its FUBU
New school with the voodoo, on the brew 
Taking scoops of the root
Higher views no youtube 

Open heads, still I want the dead prez 
Hate the game, still I want the play, n the cred
Guess it’s just by design, underclass make em overstand 

[Chorus]
(x2)
