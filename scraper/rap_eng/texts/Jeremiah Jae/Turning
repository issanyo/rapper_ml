[Verse 1: Jeremiah Jae]
Can't break away, act brave cuz they pack away
A gold plated handle, bullet holes in the candle
Not a trace of love, the impact is facing up
Taste the rum
Numb if anything or something else become it
But what was once peace under the coven
Couldn't help but be destructive
Son of the sun it's the epilogue for Decepticons
Son of the puppet, punch kick fuck pushing buttons
Touch of the gunner
Watch my bullets sink deep in the son of the lone gunner
Over butter hot cutters
Baby papa from that gutter mothership
And copped a dust flower maybe we can twist
Visions of the myth
Niggas bathing in flames of piff
They rewrite scripts, so many dreams of yesterday
While balls of flame burn the city to waste, they haste
To the front of the line to show face
But she needed a taste, knees to the face

[Verse 2: Zeroh]
Wake yawn, stretch, walk, eat, beats, text, talk
Pace, pack, pew! damn I lost my house shoe
Start that song palming' the calm, I'm bout to
Personify intention ambish the hell out that how to
I dare you, awkward or lonely, I'll hug the fuck out you
Come bounce with the count conundrum
Throwing stones you can't bounce to
Trust enough could get ugly
Thus the clutch must doubt you
Force can't move dude, swipe no value
So sit still, watch me abandon...
Who? what?

To lunch while the body stands in..
Beat Soup whats up?

Camaraderie strands are rampant
Groove and such
I gotta be raw, Badass man
Just lose the crutch

So sit still, watch me abandon...
Who? what?

To lunch while the body stands in..
Beat Soup whats up?

Camaraderie strands are rampant
Groove and such
I gotta be raw, Badass man
Pop ooze the guts

And as summer comes to close
Coasting on my Ghost ship
Queen Marry roasted
Rings and roses
Mo' posies in the pocket
Never down, high doses
Dabbing' ashes off the rocket
Profit off a numbers, see seven for details
Got misread emails
Been tryna chop it up with Obst from the juice mag
I stress the coalesce, my best ain't too bad
But sun come in second to stupid niggas in do-rags?
No separation my nigga, I'm all people
Genie, Jafar, Kendrick Lamar and Lil' B too
This vegan eat seafood, chickens need to reboot
Read mo, moo, me, my, May
June, July, mad months
Tracks stack toward black fronts
Wrote more than half this shit taking a bad one
So funky man, it ain't even coo
Jae R for this one, you's a foo
Too hard, too strong man, but what can you do?
I haven't a clue, I'm just fucking with you
What am I turning into?
