The beat is on fire
Watch the Opus slowly retire
Into a tidal wave of slave type attire
The children play dress up and heavenly father confesses
He had a thing for small breasteses
Question is
What happens after set begins
The moon shines off of bare back chested woman's
Who wins?
The Peeping Toms or the swinger moms
Probably both
All you need is two Klingons
The perfect roomates like Larry and Leon
Told them be gone
Let bygones be by nah
Never catch him in the mist of two gods
The only way
Is if he ball like Lebron....
This is really wrong
Either I'm in the wrong room or that's two dogs
Goin' at it like lets play hide the rabbit
The hole gets deeper once you smash it
Attached to it like this is the best drink
Told this girl
After six weeks, he's a sex freak
She laughed, told him stop it
What's even more erotic
The fetish for munchkins and hobbits....
His favorite movie crash
Not the one with Ludacris
But blood and semen on the dash
The motor car mishap
Take a nap
And dream about Stacy Dash
You probably like who doesn't?
The catch that he caught his excrement in glove, of it
Baked something that taste like dud muffins
The aged mother after patties like Doug Funny
Mayonnaise stain on your dress shirt
Must of been Skeeter in the back of honker burger
You used to be best friends for life
Until you got the chance to sneak peek misses Valentine
This is for the pervs and the shy cons
This is not a anthem more like, do it on your own time
Like prime time sports
The only reason girls watch to see buff men in shorts
I guess we all guilty
Remember when I used to get geeked off Disney movies
A brunette dyke with lips like Snow White
Told her I was sleepy
Could I crash for the night?

Pervert
Gettin' all your nerves worked
You just a pervert
Gettin' all your nerves jerked
Pervert
