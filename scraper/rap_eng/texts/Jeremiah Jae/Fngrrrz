Love
Some people show it
And some really never know it
Smiles
Hold up man, I'm about to hit these
Trees
[?] shine bright and beautiful
In clear weather
Look up
But they don't seem as big

Remember the worst prison is you trapped in your skull
By your mind

I love you (Me llamo)
So can a n***** get some

Love
In this bitch
Some people show it

She pointed at me with her
Finger
Told me to come her with her

Whispered in my ear, "Can you fuck me with your
Fingers"
Man, pass the

Trees
[?] shine bright and beautiful
In clear weather
Look up
But they don't seem as big
As you
And me
Together
