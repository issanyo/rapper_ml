[Verse 1: SamSpacely]
Yo! ya’ll should know that still got it!
Stick metal through your mental to show I can “Steel-God” it
Get it?
That’s overheads. I hope I said what I had meant to say
If not then maybe I should walk a block and clear my brain (Uhh!)
Is this the mellow fellow you never say hello to?
Well hell this kid is hella dope you better tell the truth
Or tell your crew, cause you been sink like you been surfing
You'll resurface as soon as you certain you not worthless
But you see my purpose is not steal from these purses or kick it back where the purp is
It’s to unearth this murk shit(Uhh!)

You never heard of rape, yet somehow you regurgitate hate and raise the murder rate
Wait now I’m concerned to make money with you funny ass niggas cause you running into debt cause you dummy ass niggas

While my money is getting wet just like a cool bottle. Nigga, I’m moving full throttle!
That’s my new life’s motto. I get mines, I don't like lottos
You keep your hand out and never receive a handout
So If you wish to standout, when you see me you should stand down (down!)
I’m outstanding. SamSpacely. Just now landing
Shit I crashed into a mountain so I'm now stranded

But you can bet that I’ve never been one to sweat
When it comes to uncertain death, that don’t effect how I stay grounded
You know I sounded so astounding so I gotta round them
Gotta surround them like the rings around unbounded planet

So when you see us reach the zenith, it’s no dream
I’m a genius, I’m on Venus, show allegiance to my team
The only thing is we the meanest, show no weakness when we sting
But believe this. It’s a secret, you gon see it. I’m the king!
It’s funny how you know the kid be spittin' acid now
I guess the rap assassin flow will make ya ass sit down
