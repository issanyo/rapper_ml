[Verse 1]
Yahweh give me sight
Lost tribe in the night
Clyde with the Barrow
Climbing to the top of the heights, find light
Slave in the shelter
Raise on that delta
Bars that’ll melt ya
In 38 specials
Black, full V8
Hopping out the window
Make a splash like V8
And dash like B-Name
A posse on Broadway
Pom-pom blastin, Tony bring the cash in
Like Frank keep the magic
Fly over put the drugs in the casket
Death Valley, we fallin on dead fears
I’ll rally the troops and shoot beers
Few years, and we climbin
Chicago Heights I’m wild in my climate
Line ‘em up start firing
Squad in the wagon outside, keep your eyes peeled
Black windshield maneuver the big wheels
Sit on top of the hill, divide the big kill


[Verse 2]
Allah give me sight
The vision to do right
Judah with the tribe
Lying in the wild, looking for the bite
Night walker, looking through the blue blocker
She call the shots like Ma Barker
The stocks wouldn’t never catch me two-footed
Slow and wet, keep the liquor brewin’
We balloonin’ to the top, Montgolfier
Sipping Ocean Spray, feel the ocean waves
Feel the Winchester pump, 20 gauge
20 guards outside like St. James
Set the city to flame I’m burning sage
On the center stage, we don’t play
Live life on the edge we blow dryers
Make your hair stand up like weird science
Uh, line ‘em up start firing
Squad in the wagon outside, keep your eyes peeled
Black windshield maneuver the big wheels
Sit on top of the hill, divide the big kills
