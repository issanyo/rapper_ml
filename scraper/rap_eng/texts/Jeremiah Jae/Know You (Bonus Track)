[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

It's funny how it goes
I use to be the one that holds you
Never thought we'd let it go
Now I dont even want to know you anymore
When I pull up on the curb
I see you and I look away
We could've made it work
But It doesn't matter anyway anymore
It's funny how it goes
I use to be the one that holds you
Never thought we'd let it go
Now I dont even want to know you

[Verse - Jeremiah Jae]

Yeah it's funny how it goes
Reason I don't trust hoes
Thought we had something
Had something till it's gone
Remember when we up and hit the road
Remember spending months at ya momma home
Most dudes probably couldn't take the drama zone
I could see pass it
Nights full of passion
If love is a gift, probably should have left it wrapped up
In plastic, no prophylactic
We would practice
The magic, I know we had it
Like what happened
Guess we was going to fast now we crashing
When the money wasn't coming no laughing
Went from smashing to throwing glassing
I know I been savage
Cause I found out I wasn't really Ben Savage
New address, and a whole new agenda
I wonder when you said them words did you really mean em

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

It's funny how it goes
I use to be the one that holds you
Never thought we'd let it go
Now I dont even want to know you anymore
When I pull up on the curb
I see you and I look away
We could've made it work
But It doesn't matter anyway anymore
It's funny how it goes
I use to be the one that holds you
Never thought we'd let it go
Now I dont even want to know you

[Verse 2 - Trenttruce}

Your heart was mine
You're no longer on my mind
The flowers bloom and the crow's sing
It's judgement time
You crossed the line
I gave you chances
Go ahead and cry
You Know, You know
I gave you wings that you broke
Your insults are a joke
Now your left in the cold
Lost soul with nowhere to go
I never said I wouldn't let go
I never said I wouldn't let go

[Bridge - Trenttruce & Jeremiah Jae]

I'm a loner baby, I'm a rebel baby and I don't trust much
I'm a loner baby, I'm a rebel baby and I don't trust much yea
I'm a loner baby, I'm a rebel baby and I don't trust much
I'm a loner baby, I'm a rebel baby
I'm a loner baby, I'm a rebel baby and I don't trust much
I'm a loner baby, I'm a rebel baby and I don't trust much
I'm a loner baby, I'm a rebel baby and I don't trust much

[Post Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

It's funny how it goes
I use to be the one that holds you
Never thought we'd let it go
Now I dont even want to know you
