[Intro]
Yo, rap a little, Driver, go for it!

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Make a hole and behold my whole mind
For the black holes, holy wars to hole nine
A whole body who goes stale with all the old biscuits
For growth sales hold the mail cause I'm holistic
My smalltalk is a folktale of old mystics
Its dollar value is a smoke trail of old Plymouths
I found footing on the coattails of show business
For this airy hole's a hotel with ghosts in it
I ensured the expulsion of astral goo
And caused convulsions as addictive as tobacco chew
My lips are the volcano's rare mica
Blink at the sky and have a rainbow dimmed by
Sharing the notion I pinch a shaft of light
From every hole I'm a messy troll who spat on tykes
Your every hole is lined with the gold bands
And you must be a coke can and I must be a whole man
The b-burial plot is where you all grow corn
I'm a dust mite whose blood type is lowborn
But now my lips from which sherry o sworn(?)
And my personal warmth is set to snowstorm!
But now my lips from which sherry o sworn(?)
And my personal warmth is set to snowstorm!

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
I heard Kendrick Lamar's batman and Miley Cyrus
Likes to treat her microphone stand as if it's a large black man
They feed Tyson chickens liquid Viagara
Unemployed college grads would gentrify Africa
Hold up, there's breaking news about Lamar Odom
Coming through my 24 hundred barred modem
Thank you for letting me be myself again
Not European; I don't dig shows about elfin men
Revenge of the nerd rap tournaments; join us
As we drink on cheap beer and have to belch to win
Icecaps will melt your friends and my friends
Even the ones that eat raw food and do thigh bends
Might as well sucker punch Mike Tyson
Be a hood Heisenberg rollin' blunts full of Ricin
In Islamabad humming Hava Nagila
On a loudspeaker, quoting from Bhagavad Gitas
Rappers calling out names for other rappers to focus on
It's like an episode of Pokemon; Big Sean, I choose you!
I got a message for a lot of folks
You got two twitter accounts? Nigga I won't follow both
Nigga I won't follow both

[Verse 3: Jeremiah Jae]
Set fire to the bandstand with propane
Let my spirit rise come and ride on the soul train
This is so flame, wash it with a cold drink
In a fishbowl find remnants of your whole team
Yeah, stimulated by the cold dreams
Black streets where they pack heat and hold beef
Throw c's off the boat, make these hoes scream
Always knew I could be a product of the dope G
If I didn't know the history I wouldn't repeat it
Like the Jam of the Week rap about big tires
On my nose G, you rap like a minor
Chilling by your 'rents bed with the night light on
Terrified by the dark, I'm a black hole
And a lightbulb and an elephant in the pressroom
You a yang, no yin in the cesspool
Etched in the memory of teenage girls who
Act tribal, monkey see, monkey do
Off that white dust on that white bus to the zoo
No visitor, more like a resident
Welcome to the show, you have been selected
To fill that Hellfyre, Hellfyre black jungle all you rappers just plummet
