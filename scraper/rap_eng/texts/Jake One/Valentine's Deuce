[Intro]
Twenty men were found dead, filled with bullets in a garage on the slummier side of town. Reports said they were doing a drug deal and that there were no witnesses to who could've done it. The authorities have stated it was probably just a case of a bunch of low class drug dealers involved in a drug deal gone wrong. Back to Madison for the weather reports

[Hook x2]
Bitch I'm bustin' at him; bitch I'm bustin' at him
Pow Pow Pow, gotta shoot all of them mothafuckas

[Verse 1]
I suit up, it's nice out; deuce up, and Iced out
Had a couple of stalkers, gonna make me pull my knife out
Small time but no matter, gonna cut their lights out
Gamble with my life, then I gotta bring my dice out
So I gotta send fear to the heart of those who oppose me
The same ones who plot can't hide behind their rosary
I'm a changed man, who hides behind the same tan
The same cold eyes that hides behind the ray bans
Gotta cut out competition, and I know how to do it
Put em' in a line and fire up, ain't no ways to lose it
Dress up as the boys in blue, under a false arrest
Under the guise of selling coke, blood up on the walls and vest
Mac-11's won't do, sipping on a cold brew
But AK's are a good choice, chop you up, turn you into tofu
The angels stare down on me and all they do is weep
Close they eyelids, rest in peace, I pray to god you go to sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So the plan starts out fine enough, the diamonds in the rough
Know where they be going to, then they go to line em' up
When they open the garage doors more then was expected
It's hectic, bullet's flying, the plan is being dissected
So what am I supposed to do, a bunch of my boys killed
We got a rat in the house, cause we only employ skilled
I role with professionals who don't go to confessionals
And all of their backgrounds are very credible
Except one motherfucker who I wasn't one hundred with
And I'm a hunter, shit he better know who he's fucking wit'
I guess I gotta settle the score, for better or worse
It goes slow-mo with the fo-fo, better withdraw
Pull out every gun that I got just to salvage this shit
The motherfuckers try to run but I got piles of clips
I shoot through every single one, from bone to ligaments
This shit has gotten to be one unholy predicament

(Shells falling)
Oh shit!! The po's!! We gotta go Kane
[Aight, let's go]
(Steps of running)
