[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse 1]
Trippin' on some thoughts on my head
Straight from the dead, waking straight from the bed
In this place I call a home
But hell no, I want a throne full of gold up in Melrose
Got like 30 missed calls on my cellphone
Don't got friends, fuck around, or you die broke
And I, been balling since a zygote
No joke, feds want me in some jail clothes
Well, no, I'm in beastmode
And this Beastcoast kind of like a cheat code
And a main event shows what I need though
But for now, french toast what I eat yo
And for now, Imma kill it 'til the beat close
And God knows I'm on point like a free-throw
Jeez, please feed me, Im a fiend, I'm getting real sick of these nosebleed seats
No I can't see if it's not HD
And a nigga won't drink if it's not Fiji
Used to dream dreams of them G-Star jeans
But these Balmain seams lookin' pretty as a beach

[Verse 2]
Yo, but y'all some phonies y'all don't know me
Masked like Kobe, burn a tree with a brodie
Throwed off a 40, holy ghost holy holy
I'm Obie Wan Kanobi with the force that I'm holding
And I'm Lamar Odom with the crack that I'm spittin'
No I'm not smoking, no laughing, no joking, making money with the homies
Get my first check, spend it all on a rolley
The life that I'm molding, my eyes not closing, 'til my teeth shine golden
Nah I'm not bluffing, do my cards look folded
Yeah I'm the coldest in the hood, been frozen
Hook poet, Wrist spoken, this star write
Induced vines of 5 star, [?] the star vice
Admired like fresh blood to vampires, and
Y'all jealous, eyes greener as the star fire
They all jealous, young 20, he's just flyer get higher
Then a parachute on a pair of dudes, with a pair of boots
Cause I'm very cool, who know
All red shoes, SuWoo, Voodoo, might kill you and your crew too
Boo hoo, you can go cry to your mans
And I shoot bless me, achoo, thank you
And I'm all about my green, that's true
Like a fresh bowl of the wonton soup
If you act wrong, get a swanton move off the top rope, and that's no joke my dude
Drool, comin' from the mouth of a fool
Heart of a lion, but the mind of a bull
Shit, so you better dip, you can get dropped in the hood with a full clip
One sec, bang!
(Gunshot)
And that's it
