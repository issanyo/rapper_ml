[Hook:] (x4)
Are you ready for me
Are you ready for me
Are you ready for me
For my love

[Verse 1:]
All I'm asking baby, is to show some kind of sign
Whisper in my ear now, let me know that you be mine
I've been watching you now, watching you watch me all night
The way you move across the floor, got me going on my mind

[Hook:] (x4)

[Verse 2:]
Party's almost over, and the night is winding down
Devil on the shoulder, take a ride with me uptown
You got to be prepared now, better take it serious
If you make that magic move, baby there's no turning back for us

[Hook:] (x4)

[Verse 3:]
Just tell me what you wanna do now, come on you gotta let me know
Cause I'm as ready as I ever be, you gotta tell me so
Don't wanna push it way too fast now, cause baby we can take it slow
But if you ready we can groove it now, just say the word let's go (let's go)

[Outro:] (x4)
Are you ready for me
Are you ready for me
Are you ready for me
