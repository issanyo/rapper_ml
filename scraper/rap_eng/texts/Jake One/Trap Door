[Verse 1]
A-F-R-O is actually manifestin' the manic depression
Mad at the man who was rentin' the mansion after the spirits
Haunted, inhabited all of it, had the havoc enthrallin' it
Hands handlin', hack with a damn hatchet and saw at ya
Damn cranium, phasin' em like a player in stadiums
Makin' bangers with aliases, and aliens come
To take away and abduct the children, I'm tracin' a brush
Over a painting and such, most of you basically lunch
Fried chicken dinner, I'm bigger with a literal picture
A nigga fixin' to figure a minute or second out
Aminitive, sittin', spittin', and mixin' vision with wisdom
A miniature little clip is when the Wesson is out
Teachin' a lesson, I'm guessin', blessin' the messages, ending a sent
Text, and I get it, I'm the defendant who reppin' a red
Testament mission, I'm dead
Fendin' the livin', a bed
Spread, and I'm in it, you feminine
Admit it, bitch

[Verse 2]
A ruggish, thuggish bone like the Harmony zone
Get off of me, ho, I'm sluggish, I oughta be grown
An odyssey roamed to slaughter the apostrophe on
The comma-dey that I own, and I'm droppin' the drones
And all of the cops probably can call me the top criminal
Rock minerals, you feel ill when the artery shot
Call me your pops, bitch, poppin' this shit
Like pop rocks in this bitch, fuck it, I'm audible, shit
Dustin' off the honorable spit, I'm Apocalypse Now
Put my cock on your bitch's lips, I love the garglin' sound
She garglin' balls by the pound and all, and I'm off with the loud
You talkin' a lot for a while, and I'm on this common canal
Drop it, you oughta be (Shot) just for fakin' your life
I hope you die a horrible death and take your own life
Because a nigga like you does not deserve to breathe
Fuckin' air that I breathe, I'm fair, but I'm honestly greedy
Sharin' is never the meaning, caring is ever so greenery
Greenery's been there for me, since age sixteen
Facin' the fakest of fiends, they takin' my space and my dream
And chasin' my fame and my deeds and placin' they station on me
Let's get it goin'
You edible emcees, nothin' but main courses
Remain focused, the change strange, brain and torso
Specialize in torture, rested my contortion
Abide forces, testin' my lines like coke does
Clackin' the shotty mount, drawn army I swarm
Rackin' up body counts, like warm bodies in morgues
Defeatin' any emcee with an ignorance they conceive
And I'm droppin' bodies like niggas always do with they beats
Prime example, mantle smash you, flashin' forward, track absorbent
Mathematic coitus, flabbergasted whores are mad at A-F-R-O
Tormentin' for a second, forming edges, foreign rent
Is more intended, chore indented, quarter flippin' for a
Border-hoppin' Mexican, which is me
I'm Mexican and Black, Blaxican if you ask again
I rock the spot with the frame of a teacher
I shoot off the top like I'm Abraham Lincoln
Had the hat'll snap backwards, a man with a track at ya
I'm after the wack rappers, dinin' like fat bitches
Drag it out for the fact that immaculate raps suit ya
And dashin' to get a damn lap dance from a fat hooker
