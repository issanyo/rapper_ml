It seems like every time I do them good, they do me some dirt
And every time I show emotion, I just end up with hurt
So through time, I taught myself to be heartless
I'm better off in a casket, a simple forgotten carcass
A lot of hate in my heart, a fucking chip on my shoulder
I'm always watching my back, best friends is fucking me over
They call me "bro" but I know damn well that they snakes and some vultures..
Bitch like some hoes, who need some fucking dick and some closure
This world has gone to shit
And everyone inside disgust me, beautiful on the outside with actions that make them ugly
Drop to my knees and ask God, "Lord, do you really love me?..I know this life's a test but these people, they push and shove me, and the same people that talking shit are the same people that hug me!" and I do this for the "love" man fuck your fame and all your money

One, two
Yeah, one two

See, ever since I was a youngin' I had dreams of being something, a million fans screaming my name the crowd physced and jumping. I wasn't born to live a basic life, momma you have to face it. So dry your eyes one time I promise that your son gon' make it
But is my goal to make the cover of the XXL?
Or fuck a thousand hoes until my dick starts to swell?
Or make a million mistakes and make some songs called "Oh Well"?
Or glorify the drug game and put my people in jail?
And take full responsibility for a generation in cells
Cause all you fuckers influence the kids, with the stories you tell
While you fantasize like its heaven to be living in hell
Well, if thats the price of success, then man I'd much rather fail
