[Chino XL]
One more time, Tech
Uh, uh, uh
I'm trouble

Chorus: Tracey Lane
Everywhere I go
It seems like
Trouble keeps following me
Niggas, y'all better stop fucking with me
Cause I keep the heat
Right up under my set
Everywhere I go
It seems like
Trouble keeps following me
Homey, ya don't really want no problems with me
Cause I'm used to beef
And I'm from the streets

(Verse 1)
Chino is born with a feeling of anguish
Hate my primary language
Survive beef thick like Black Angus
Street famous, to wore your vest
Have you talkin' Through a Wire like you Kanye West
I'm the Puerto Rican sire with the fire lyrics
That been known to slap a nigga with my gun and my fist
And I been known to diss a nigga on my compact disc
But I gone a little smarter when the walls doing list
And yes
All I know is writing
On my tombstone write
Won't write shit, I'm incapable of dying
When I ain't implying, I stay prime
I whip yo ass, but you a homo, I'd be sentenced for a hate crime

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
The king of innovating, ventilating verbal data
These rappers, they keeping me so pissed, I got an empty bladder
Does it even matter that I flow good?
Off my head, like I'm surrounded by terrorists in black hoods
Smokin' blackwoods
You in my infrared
You wanna play The Godfather?
Marlon Brando's dead
Trouble followin' me
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me
It's Friday, I whip Devo's ass with a ten-speed
Mix-breed, made for beef, in war, you'll never win
You ain't fuckin' with a kid, you fuckin' with a veteran
Reach up under the leather and blast, bullshit, you right
I'm nice
I got suicide comittin' life
Spittin' right while you forcin' yours, just got a check
I ain't seein' so many zeros since the last Source awards

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
It's a damn shame you about to die at the top of your health
Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E. smuggled me an AK off the shelf
They say I look like The Rock, it's why I'm winnin' the belt
It's like a room full of pool tables, how much I'm felt
Bitches
Heads, Spreewell rims, how I'm spinnin' 'em
And women, please keep staring to a three minute minimum
The Porsche struck emblem flashy, can mammi get in?
Ah, depends like what old people shit in
I'm hear 'em whisperin', listen, you +Limp+ wristed
Do not horseplay if you softer than Seabiscuit/+Bizkit+
Don't risk it
With adequet acts to get swung
We ain't laughing with you, we laughin' at you like William Hung
(So where you from?) The home of Fu-Gee-La and Naught By
In Channel Live, Joe Buddens, Marc the 45
Queen La', Redman, Joe Pesci, Rah Digga
Wild niggas, crooked cops, Sopranos, scheming bitches
Fiending riches religious
Street scriptures
Everywhere I go is trouble
God is my witness

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Tracey Lane]
From the streets

[King Tech]
Come on...
Come on...
