[Intro]

You like that?

[Verse 1]
She met a fake nigga
But she don't mind cause he got 6 figures
Louis by the luggage
Five-star suite
Shawty so fine she ain't even gotta speak
Everything tailor made, everything clean
Skin tone Phillippines, bag by Celine
Shawty cause a killin when she pull up to the scene
This is Life goals, this a real life dream

[Bridge]
You like that baby?
Nah, relax

[Verse 2]
Now she on the beach
Fine wine sippin'
Her folks still broke but she smelling like a million
The views so appealing, the views so gorgeous
Shawty from the kasi but ride in a foreign
Shawty so fly, shawty just soaring
Came a long way from Morvite in the morning
Now she eating oysters, now she eating squid
Just cause you broke now you calling her a bitch, bitch!
