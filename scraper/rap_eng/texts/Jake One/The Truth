Y'all don't want it with the F-R-E nigga

Y'all ain't fuckin with them Jake One beats nigga

("Cause, cause we spittin the truth and nothin else")

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
All my real fans did you miss him? (miss him)
These youngins might not know 'em but they feel him (feel him)
Freezer starvin, I ain't stoppin 'til the meal ends (meal ends)
I'm as raw as pickin cotton with your bare hands (bare hands)
This is State Prop game, Roc-A-Fella fam (fam)
I'm your favorite flow-er's flow-er you can call him, and ask him (yeah!)
He'll tell you that he spit it like I spit it before
Listen fella, this Roc-A-Fella we invented the flow (that's right)
Was baggin dimes in my cellar (uh), when Nas had his tech in the dresser (uh)
Now I pass checks to bank tellers nigga (that's right)
Philly Freezer had a black Smith and Wesson (woo!)
When black Smif N Wesson started wreckin they shows (come on)
They was enterin the stage (yeah), I was enterin the stage too
You just start doin it, I did it before
Who you? Free original (original), I'm in the building with a hardcore vintage flow
I get the dough, I'm the truth

[Hook - Brother Ali] (sample from "At Night Time" by Johnnie Taylor)
(The truth is so plain to see)
You ain't fuckin with the R-S-E neither
(The truth is so plain to see)
And you ain't fuckin with that Brother Ali, believe it
(The truth is so plain to see)
And you ain't fuckin with them Jake One beats

("Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named, A-A-Ali, Ali")

[Verse 2 - Brother Ali]
Ah, Jake roll that beat out like a red carpet
I put that blood red target to your head, spark it
Directly out the ghetto marchin like I'm Rev. Sharpton
Bet I'm starvin like it's free breathe, his heads startin, look like I'm share croppin
Cooped up squattin in a studio apartment
Food stamps up in the pocket, mixin tuna with the ramen
Boosted a few bottles of baby food out the market
You ain't grew in this environment, so who are you to comment?
Hungry pacin in a bus station with my nuts hangin
But I never sold base, motherfuck Reagan (motherfuck Reagan)
Shit just wasn't in my upbringin (upbringin)
None of us is above scrappin my brother, so I don't judge nathan
Some of my buddies slanged it
Then one got taken out, toe tagged, fuck that, rather be butt naked
I say it real, I'm afraid of bein killed
Seein my kids raised in hell, me away in jail
In them homes, I been sketchin since I'm seven
Got collected by my brethren, now it's my profession
Big music industry and seldom gettin mention
But the few that do zoom in respect me as a legend
Fuck that, I'm a Reverend
The Philly Freezer with the Street Preacher settin up shop teachin the lessons
These are not just words, we tell you in the booth
That feeling you just got inside your stomach is our proof, that we the truth
