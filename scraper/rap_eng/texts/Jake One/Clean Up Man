[Young Buck]
Aiyyo you niggas done ate long enough
G-UNIT! OHH!

[Hook]
AYYY, I'm the clean up man!
It ain't too many niggas that can do it like I can
When them records ain't sellin and the stitches start tellin
Motherfucker they yellin - GET 'EM BUCK!!
Grindin grindin, I can make it happen
Cause I'm - grindin grindin, I ain't only rappin
Man I'm - grindin grindin, you know who to call
I be - grindin grindin, this is for my dawgs

[Young Buck]
What's goin on with the Unit these days? (let 'em know)
Well I'mma tell you e'rybody gettin paid
And I hear you niggas talkin, prayin on our downfall
Took a couple losses, still we some outlaws
Ya bitch still lovin my swag
We let you niggas eat, why the fuck is you mad?
I never left the streets, I really ran to 'em
And since I know they watchin me I let my man do 'em
Money, a house and a bad bitch
Way 'fore the rap game man I had this (niggas know)
You don't know about bein broke
Standin on the block sellin fiends soap
Holla at me

[Hook]

[Young Buck]
Let's sip the 'gnac for a minute
Shawty you feelin this then put your back in it (hey!)
I'm back in it in an all-black fitted
In an all-black tinted-up drop top Bentley
Like - AYYY! You know what it is (yeah!)
I got my own jewelry baby, this ain't none of his (okay!)
Just holla when you NEED ME
Show a nigga love when you SEE ME
I can carry the weight, 50 just put it on my shoulders
G-Unit is the gang, I'm a motherfuckin soldier
They thought it was over, he let me out the cage (hey!)
So now they got me standin on this goddamn stage, like

[Hook]

[Young Buck]
Before I leave let me put this on your brain
If rap stop today, I still do my thang
I bought a Benz way before I bought me a chain
Took my momma out the Bricks and bought a car in her name
Paid my nigga Head bond just to get him on the streets
Hope if I get locked up niggas do it for me
Keep the project lights on, payin e'rybody bills
All my homies dead, I'm takin care of e'rybody kids
And I got this, you can count on me
To come through, when the home team down by three
I'm gon' shoot, and even if a nigga did miss
I bet you next quarter I'll be back in this bitch, like

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Young Buck]
Yeah, y'know niggas out there
Nah nah, hold on
Y'know SOME niggas out there
Mighta thought the Unit was over or some shit
You niggas is losin your fuckin minds man, ha ha
Aiyyo man I got this shit right now, ya mean?
Get the FUCK out my lane, yeah
Y'know, that's why that nigga 50
That's why he got his feet kicked up right now
Ha ha, Sha Money I got you nigga
Straight up, so, oh yo
I'm expectin to be at the AWARDS this year!
Yeah...
