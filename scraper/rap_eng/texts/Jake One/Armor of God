Let me talk to him!
Let me talk to him!
Talk to me!

[Verse 1]
I’m from the era were we murk the bearer of bad news like Leonidas
And family don’t speak till tragedy reunite us
Scout to see who tightest and slay hordes
Who wanna test V.A. sword
I wanna meet the Fockers
No Gaylord
An angelic presence the delegates blessing
It’s hell against heaven
My flow is god’s relic in essence
Why in the fuck is you replicas testin
With a delicate pressin
I can blow you to maggot delicatessen
They restless til I’m soul clapped with no mercy
Till they witness the crown get hold captive and murk me
No industry flow active can hurt me
The upper echelons about effective as proactive to herpes
Instruct spit to keep niggas with chalk employed
The gods fully armored
Apology talk is void
What part beast you don’t understand
I write the sickest shit to hit white sheets since cross burning Caucasoid

[Hook]
V, a verse for all the fallen that left me
A, may the armor of god protect me
Kill everything thing that’s movin expect me
If you offended then I’m talking to you directly

[Verse 2]
Sick as an abortion activist germ biochemist
Strapped by yo clinic
Clappin’ clients with a grill that’s cryogenic
The ice that my tear ducts cry authentic enough to hypothermia what I
Breathe upon even freeze a pond
The game will never be fixed
Cause every new nigga heavily bricks
Or exploited like 70′s flicks
Machine and beast cleverly mixed so
Fuck around and get carried by six
Like the nuggets in 76
I’m a good fucka
A sick migraine cross contaminated with strychnine strains and click
Nines aimed
Split a soul three ways in an auction
You celebrity fit thugs weighing your luck and weighing your options
Subsequently no slugs can dent me
Spit freeze whatever rubs against me I creep like a stealth winter
Frost bitin shit till your health splinters
This is I, fill in you the blank lord and master bitch I’m self-centred

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Niggas want me to rehash beef with Twista till the targets destroyed
Run up on him at 106 & Park with the toy
Fuck all that, that’s a marketing ploy
In fact, I’m proud of what the nigga accomplished
Bark at cha boy
Envy breeds from not stackin right
Non packin pipe
Insecure non tough, tough actin tinactin types
You clients of panda pussy pimpin
The source of your extinction in existence is right here in black and white
Till I’m emancipated, I birthed terror that stans Al-Qaeda
Switch up, give a fuck if fans okayed it
All I got is my balls and my word
If the streets hold me to my word, we already know where your hands located
Your fears confirming my thesis
The time fabrics in permanent creases
Pressing the luck you weigh
When bucks spray, you lay
Uckfay ouyay
Want some positive shit?
Mother fucker play Lupe

[Hook]
