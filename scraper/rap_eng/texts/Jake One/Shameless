[Intro: Zini]
Yeah, can I talk about my struggles? Shit, before everybody get into what the fuck they been goin' through
Nigga, I done sold weed
Nigga to the stars, and just been broke right after
Like, you know how embarrassin' that is?
All my-everybody like "damn, nigga, you know all the celebrities, nigga"
And then I go home, to a mothafuckin' $800 apartment
Nigga that shit is trash
It's ya boy Zini
Ya know what I'm sayin', professional rapper friend, extraordinaire
Ya know what I'm sayin', I did been to the moon and back
On the label's budget nigga

[Chorus: Buddy & Guapdad 4000]
Yeah
Shameless, shameless (ayy)
Thought I told you haters
I don't wan' be famous
I'm tryin' get rich mothafucka I'm
Shameless, shameless
Yeah, talkin' 'bout stranger danger
I done seen stranger danger
Young niggas here still walkin' 'round
Shameless, shameless
Yup, still pullin' out gauges
These streets outrageous
Y'all niggas can't change it
Shameless, shameless
No, I don't wan' be famous
(Ayy) No, I don't wan' be famous (hol' up)

[Verse 1: Guapdad 4000]
I'm a young scamma, scamma, scamma, scamma
Ayy, of course I ain't wanna be famous
Now I'm the Ferragamo falcon, so I gotta act an anus
Yeah, ayy
Now I'm on everybody A-list
I ain't wanna be a rapper (ayy)
Now I'm on everybody playlist
Yeah, the Cloud, the Tune, and the Spotify
Scammed the fools and met the wise
I done copped the Tees and dotted i's
Met the wifey tight like a 5 twice
Wanna come through and ride me like a motorbike (vroom, vroom)
Still a ho, and I'ma be a ho 'til I'm ready to go and jump the broom, broom
So until then, I'm just tryna recruit my sidechick (I need anotha one)
Somebody to flip off my hip like sidekicks( aim me)
The spotlight glowed on me and changed my life
(Yo) So don't approach me on a bad day, and expect me to be not nice
Single life, so bruh that bitch is not mine (she not mine bruh)
Livin' a double life, you still can die twice
I come from eatin' microwave fried rice (yeah)
So now I ball nigga, in the mall like swipe, swipe
Yeah

[Chorus: Buddy]
Shameless, shameless (ayy)
Thought I told you haters
I don't wan' be famous
I'm tryin' get rich mothafucka I'm
Shameless, shameless
Yeah, talkin' 'bout stranger danger
I done seen stranger danger
Young niggas here still walkin' 'round
Shameless, shameless
Yup, still pullin' out gauges
These streets outrageous
Y'all niggas can't change it
Shameless, shameless
No, I don't wan' be famous
No, I don't wan' be famous
I'm tryin' get rich mothafucka I'm
Shameless, shameless

[Verse 2: Buddy]
Countin' my money in hundreds
Trackin' my money to double
Poppin' all around the bubble
I'm 'bout to fly out to London
I'm wylin' all out in public
I need my pay in advance
Amsterdam with me and my friends
Then I might head out to France
I got a bitch in Berlin
Get paid, set trends
Matsuhisa on a hump day
Jon & Vinnyâ€™s on a lunch date
I need Jordyn Woods on my dinner plate
In the game and I'm makin' plays (damn)
Made a milly before I dropped the tape
20k before I hit the stage
Niggas only live one way
Shameless, shameless
'Dat way
Magazines wit' my face on the front page
Packin' a suit case
Rolled outta Compton and got me a new place
Pop the champagne
Get outta my way, I been doin' my two-a-days
Nike campaigns
Big ads on the side of the freeway
Ballin' out wit' my teammates
And ya better believe it
Jeweler callin', I need money on 3-way
It ain't even my birthday
But I'm celebratin' because I'm worth it
I ain't gotta rehears shit
Niggas tryna be perfect
I ain't tryna be perfect, nigga I'm

[Chorus: Buddy]
Shameless, shameless (ayy)
Thought I told you haters
I don't wan' be famous
I'm tryin' get rich mothafucka I'm
Shameless, shameless
Yeah, talkin' 'bout stranger danger
I done seen stranger danger
Young niggas out here still walkin' 'round
Shameless, shameless
Yup, still pullin' out gauges
These streets outrageous
Y'all niggas can't change it
Shameless, shameless
No, I don't wan' be famous
No, I don't wan' be famous
I'm tryin' get rich mothafucka I'm
Shameless, shameless
