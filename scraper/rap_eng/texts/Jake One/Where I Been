In Miami doin it up for Will (yeah)
Or in a mall on a shopping trip
Tryin to add to my stable of kicks (of kicks)
Uh, yeah, see I move that way

Don't ask where I've been, you can ask where I'm goin
Best believe that I'm somewhere flowin
And I'm (flowin and I'm), doin what I love to do
And when it come out, trust me you'll love it too

The places I've been, the things that I've seen
And it's, quite rare that I get off a plane
And somebody don't know my name (uh, woo, uh)

That if you want it man the world is yours (yours)
So if I ain't in a booth, I'm tearin down a show
There it is, now y'all know
