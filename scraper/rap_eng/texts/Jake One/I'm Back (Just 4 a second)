What up?
Fasten your safety belts
It’s Copywrite, Cruise Control
Volume 1
Ready?

I’m back
Like I never left this bitch
But I dare me to exit, slip
To the left, had to go to the oh
Now check this shit
Got drunk but you know I never fear those mutts
Where are those mutts
Here are no such
And everybody wanna run up asking the same question
Here let me clear all those up, now
Time will tell, at the edge of the cliff
Where your rhymes have fell
Will let the hand on my spliff
From my diamond tell
Give a moment of sign
For the head to bail
They, through the valley
In the shadow of death
Get high off my breath
Crossing the land
With a cross in my hand
While I’m gathering strength
Yeah reaper in my cypher
I’m battling Death
And I ain’t sign no contract yet
My John Hancock only contacts cheques
You got one? Then here I’ll sign it
I think big, y’all narrow minded
Prepare to ride with me
I’m cruise control
It’s funny how for money
Some will lose their soul
Some lose 'em both
And gain not one
But then I got a question
Brain, got one?
Snakes
First spot one
From a mile away
I hit ‘em all with my smile away
They say keep your friends close
Keep your enemies closer
All my friends are a mile away
Quittin’ my bitch
Can’t spit it off
Get it like this
You hittin’ my miss
You don’t wanna risk that
And just for the record
I had to come back
But just for a second
