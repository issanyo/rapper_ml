Man the sofa cheap
The soap is not
Lift the pillow
I can hold a lot
Giving no receipts
Once the dope gets copped
Man the sofa cheap
The soap is not
Lift the pillow
I can hold a lot
Giving no receipts
Once the dope gets copped

[Hook]
No more waiting, for plug
Bruh I stay with it, Its all love
No more waiting, for plug
Bruh I stay with it, Its all love

[Verse 1]
Midnight on the hunt for her to get right
Cop a couple spit a couple of em cuppin
Every nut I got in this life
Good god you didn't teach him how to live right
I'm riding round lookin like i'm spose to
Hoe fucking with me she gon tell the whole crew
I don't wanna waste time I wanna get to know you
Know I got flavor
Know these other niggas tofu so true
Sit up on that
I Kick raps filled with passion trying to live up off that
My chick water in the desert need a sip off of that
Niggas gonna tell you what they want
Then tryna front about the juice
I'm living proof
Theres nothing new under the sun
Who the one wanted the gun
Boy you better aim right
Get mine take yours in the same night
It ain't right

[Verse 2]
She only wanna chill cause the vibe right
I only wanna chill cause her tribe fine
And she down to try anything I'm into
And I love it baby girl you keep it simple
Two whole years and he only getting better
20 more years, I might write myself a letter
Send it to me how you doing my nigga you know better
Made it out the storm other niggas couldn't weather
I'm just tryna set myself up for self help and self love no out source No handouts, just couches with big butts for pillows
Skin just like Stron'jay with hair just like willows
Need asians and white girls, latinas and still so
Fire to me, dios mio
And I'm sick of hoes daddy need a real meal
If its that dope to you, you should try it
If you need more baby you know I got it
