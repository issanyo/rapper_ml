[Intro]
1, 2, 3
You know I've been around the block a few times
Thought I had it all figured out
Then you walked in with them Christian Louis Vuitton
And that je ne sais quoi
Why, why

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hotter than July
Darling don't you know that I
I thought I had it all
Then I found you
I thought I had it all
Then I found you

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey
Lying here drinking
Ginger ale and Hen'
Ceiling fan is trying hard, now
Overtime again
Handed you my coldest bars
Trying with all my might
Wishing on my lucky stars, oh
Please don't say goodnight

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hotter than July
Darling don't you know that I
I thought I had it all
Then I found you
I thought I had it all
Then I found you

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey
Soon as I came across you
Looking so damn fine
Instantly my other prospects
Left them all behind
I thought there was no greater love
Than the one I had
Now you're the one I'm thinking of
Girl, I need you bad

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hotter than July
Darling don't you know that I
I thought I had it all
Then I found you
I thought I had it all
Then I found you

[Outro]
Aw, yeah
Oh, no greater
I'll find
Ooh, come on baby
Come on honey
No, greater
Whoa-oh
I'll find
Let's do it
Right now
Come on baby
No greater
Whoa-oh
I'll find
