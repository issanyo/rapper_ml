I wish I could make you feel how I feel right now
Most the time I’m facing fears or holding tears back how
Did this happen
I was the happy captain
Steering the ship away from disaster before it happened
Man this here ended tragic
You was my genie
I was just seeking a lil magic
Admired you like Aladdin I did
Do you wrong I admit it there ain’t no kidding
Sometimes I sit and listen my niggas say quit that bitching
They just be looking out for they brother they see the vision
I must be broken hearted cuz all I see is division
I just be reminiscing
Wishing that shit was different
Wishing I could erase my mistakes but it ain’t that simple
This whole thang been so detrimental
Fucked up my mental
Overly sentimental when I should be focused solely on music not what I been through
Bet you can’t name a nigga that know you better than I do
I bet you can’t
