[Hook x2]
I can't wait to get you home tonight
I just can't wait to get you home with me

[Verse 1]
Oooh
Sitting there
And the way I stare
You know I'm dreaming of a love affair
(I wanna take you there, I wanna take you there)
All night long
I fantasize
I'm undressing you with my eyes
(And that's no surprise, that's no surprise)
Don't you know that..

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Ooh I work all week
Just to make ends meet
I wanna get you in between the sheets
(I wanna feel the heat, I wanna feel the heat)
Ohh your hips don't lie
And your lips like wine
You know I think about you all the time
(You're always on my mind, you're always on my mind)

[Bridge]
We go out at night
Dancing in the lights
I wanna get you home and squeeze you tight
(I wanna love you right, I wanna love you right)
Girl- your dress so short
And your legs so long
I can't wait to get you all alone
(You really turn me on, you really turn me on)
Girl let's get the fuck up out of here
