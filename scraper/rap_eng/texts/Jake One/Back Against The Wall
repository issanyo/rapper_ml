[Intro: Eminem]
What the Fuck?
Hey yo Whoo Kid run that shit back
God damn!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Guess who's back motherfucker I’m back (yeah)
Guess who's back motherfucker I’m back
Yeah listen
Now I’m a do this like my life depend it on it
My kids and my wife depend it on it
Everything in life I wanted I own it
I can keep my feet up and relax if I wanted it too
But I’m back in the lab making my next murder move
Giving a murderer something to go and murder too
So they can celebrate when they're making the breaking news
Niggas hate when you’re elevating your making moves
A lots changed, the same game with different rules
Make a nigga cold hearted, niggas they got it losted
Niggas better be conscious, nigga better be softly
We ain’t taking no losses, bigger deals means bigger office
The blue steel keep them niggas off us
I blew the trial because I hung the jury
Shit look what them streets done done to me

[Hook: Sly]
In a stone cold world I’m living yeah
This is what you want yeah
What you make me
Got shoot to survive will I make it out?
Got shoot to survive should I burn it down?
Back is the wall I’ma get it off
Streets teach no mercy
Look what it created a murderer
Just like the DJ when I turn it up
Back against the wall I’ma get it off

[Verse 3: Slim The Mobster]
Yeah I’ma get it off like kobe at the buzzer
Take it back to the gutter turn powder in the butter
Watch the money pile up I’ma certify hustler
And I will go out the G way boy what you expect
Oh money one of them freeway boys
I make bundles off of bundles ran the ball never fumble
Playin’ in the convict jungle apply pressure till they crumble
A quarter pound of the hundo, fuck around and my gun go
Clip tall as the jungle, my Uzi weigh a ton though
Introducing my young ho to taking bags out the Louis store
Brand new convertible she probably never seen before
Oh yeah I'm leaning low Niggas know I'm scheming though
And put bullets wherever that the Beamer go
Blew a few hundred thousands for my new jewellery
Look what the streets gone done to me

[Hook]
