[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Like we don't hurt?
Like we don't see no evil?
Like I don't know no pain?
Like we ain't tryin' to be equal?
We at peace
Y'all the ones that's gon' make this shit lethal
And the leaders we see fit, the same ones that we see through
Same puppet tryna tell me "Brother, I used to be you"
And the better you mesh, are the better they see you
I better write 'til I'm purple
I better rhyme 'til my feet blue
You got a Benz in the burbs for your silence
And look we do not want no parts
We do not want no parts
Nigga I do not want no parts
Like we don't hurt?

[Hook]
La la la, la la yeah
La la la, la la
La la la, la la yeah
La la la, la la

[Verse 2]
I heard
In a couple years my flavor won't matter
My art, it can't save me
My people gon' chatter
That piece of paper I neglected, yeah
That and the fact that I just do not give a fuck about anything that's gon' stack up
But I'ma always be myself, that's still forever
Always be a blunt away from piecin' it together
'Cause all my problems, all your problems
All we are is headed to the future
So I pacin' through nature
Try to climb out of this stupor
Y'all do the most
But the love inside your pocket won't last
All post and all hope that we not maturing too fast
I stare her right in the eyes
I tuck and puff, try to pass
No luck, we fuck then wake up
No tellin' where we gon' land
I don't want no parts
Of being lonely
Nigga we do not want no parts
Like we don't hurt?
Yeah

[Hook]
La la la, la la yeah
La la la, la la
La la la, la la yeah
La la la, la la

[Bridge]
Ends up, never stand down
Even if I'm [?] inside my pants now
It's all love
We all one
One love
One drum
Help us lord, we all under attack
I pray I not become another stat
I pray but have a hard time at that
Hopin' all my future kids..
Wind up on our back, splat

[Chorus] x2
La la la, la la yeah
La la la, la la
La la la, la la yeah
La la la, la la
