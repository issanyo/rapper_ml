[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Guess what? I'm rich
Two bitches, and a coupe
One black, one white
So much money, I don't know what to buy
So many bitches, and a couple of them bi
Diamonds on me like stars in the sky
Put her in Chanel, I'm a nice kinda guy
Just stack and flip it, watch the money multiply
Guess what? I'm rich
Two bitches, and a coupe
One black, one white
So much money, I don't know what to buy
So many bitches, and a couple of them bi
Diamonds on me like stars in the sky
Put her in Chanel, I'm a nice kinda guy
Just stack and flip it, watch the money multiply (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Trill Sammy]
Guess what? Ima' leave these (?) guessin'
No interviews, I don't like questions
Lotta' bad bitches all in my section
OG gas, so strong, no restin'
Guess what? Ima jump in that coupe, start racin' (skrr, skrr)
Won't fuck that bitch if she basic
Mix that lean with that Sprite, I taste it
Don't got a type, I'm in love with all races
Your bitch, I'm all in her mouth just like braces
(?) hunnids', I'm countin' up faces
Balenciagas for every occasion (Trill!)

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Guess what? I'm rich
Two bitches, and a coupe
One black, one white
So much money, I don't know what to buy
So many bitches, and a couple of them bi
Diamonds on me like stars in the sky
Put her in Chanel, I'm a nice kinda guy
Just stack and flip it, watch the money multiply
Guess what? I'm rich
Two bitches, and a coupe
One black, one white
So much money, I don't know what to buy
So many bitches, and a couple of them bi
Diamonds on me like stars in the sky
Put her in Chanel, I'm a nice kinda guy
Just stack and flip it, watch the money multiply

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Guess what? I'm gettin' money
But, you already knew that
Smokin' kush back to back like I grew that
Goons bust when I tell 'em to go shoot that
Diamonds in my teeth look like stars in the Wraith
A-A-Audemar on me, diamonds jumpin' out the face
Cuban link chain, got me cold like the case
Pinky ring on, not a stone out of place
Guess what? One strap
Twin Glocks, siamese
Two bitches, one me
And you a snake, GG

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Guess what? I'm rich
Two bitches, and a coupe
One black, one white
So much money, I don't know what to buy
So many bitches, and a couple of them bi
Diamonds on me like stars in the sky
Put her in Chanel, I'm a nice kinda guy
Just stack and flip it, watch the money multiply
Guess what? I'm rich
Two bitches, and a coupe
One black, one white
So much money, I don't know what to buy
So many bitches, and a couple of them bi
Diamonds on me like stars in the sky
Put her in Chanel, I'm a nice kinda guy
Just stack and flip it, watch the money multiply

[Outro: Trill Sammy]
Guess what, guess what
Guess what, guess what
Guess what, guess what
Yeah, I do rich nigga shit when I'm bored
Nigga 6'2, but I don't play sports
Guess what, guess what
Guess what, guess what
Guess what, guess what
