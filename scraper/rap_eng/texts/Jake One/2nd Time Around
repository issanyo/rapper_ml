[Intro]
Second time around, hey
Second time around
Second time around, ho
Second time around
Second time around, hey
Second time around
Second time around, ho
Second time around, hey
Second time around
Second time around, ho
Second time around
Second time around, hey
Second time around
Second time around, ho
Second time around

[Chorus]
I think it's gonna be better
The second time around (second time around)
I think it's gonna be better
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 1]
I felt a super sensation
From the second I laid eyes on you
Never gave into temptation
‘Cause I didn't want to lose my cool
Then the sparks, they flew
Nothing we could do
But the aftershock was much too strong
If we start as friends build it up again
Maybe we can make it through
Longer lasting brand new

[Chorus]
I think it's gonna be better
The second time around (second time around)
I think it's gonna be better
We can work it out
We can work it out
I think it's gonna be better
Oh, the second time around (second time around)
I think it's gonna be better
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2]
I had my standard rotation
I was satisfied to get back to
Forget about our relation
Keep it pushin’ down the avenue
Then a late night call mixed with alcohol
We connected right where we left off
If we start as friends build it up again
Maybe we can make it through
Longer lasting brand new

[Chorus]
I think it's gonna be better
The second time around (second time around)
I think it's gonna be better
We can work it out
We can work it out
I think it's gonna be better
Oh, the second time around (second time around)
I think it's gonna be better
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Refrain]
Second time around, hey
Second time around
Second time around, ho
Second time around
Second time around, hey
Second time around
Second time around, ho
Second time around

[Chorus]
I think it's gonna be better, ooh
The second time around (second time around), oh
I think it's gonna be better, ooh
We can work it out
We can work it out, oh
