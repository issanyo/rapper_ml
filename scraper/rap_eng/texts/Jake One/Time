[Verse 1]
I'm like turned back, back in traffic, how did they stop in a row?
There's been worse nights, I admit that, cause at least I'm with the bros
There are people with no people, who just livin' on the go
And tummy starving hungry cause they money bucks is low
What a wonderful day it is, woke up and I made some breakfast
Gonna post up on the sofa, all up in this air condish-nin
Like, I enjoy these moments more than you can tell
I'm on a mission like a Mormon to absorb life while I'm here
Born with a bomb strap to my Huggies cause they know my shit would blow
Compared to y'all I'm Jesus, Father, swear I ain't no average Joe
Fans be all up on these toes, and man that shit too real
I learned to live my life, and not get caught up in biz
So now I'm driven by fear, because I need to succeed
I swear to God I won't fail, I'll never fall on my knees
It's easy to see, that I'm blessed from the other side
But if you wonder why I feel some-type-of-way then please let me be
Grouse

[Hook]
This that vibe shit, close your eyes shit
This some live life, then you die shit
Yeah (yeah) I know the way it goes
So I ain't surprised when
They tell me life's not fair around here
But homie, it's your time to make it
They tell me life's not fair around here
But homie, it's your time to make it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel worthless, sunshine through the curtains
Umpire with no eyes, or a mink that is furless, yeah
My purpose is to do what I love
Head in the game making sure I'm not a juvenile punk
Lucrative young loser with stupid music that sucks
Is what I'll never be, so tell me what the hell am I doing wrong?
I'm allowed to be sad, and that's why I actually wrote this song
I don't care if you got it worse than me, cause that is not my problem
I'm mobbin' up with my homies, steppin' up in the game
My perspective changes through verses, verbally just insane
My thoughts are scrambled, often lost in different channels
I can handle all these panoramic views up in my head, bro, I don't know ( I don't know) , I don't know
It's a blessing in disguise, so I'm happy on the low
You can see it in my eyes with the way I got that flow
I be on some different shit, opposed to anyone you know
Hold up, it's like

[Hook]
This that vibe shit, close your eyes shit
This some live life, then you die shit
Yeah, (yeah) I know the way it goes
So I ain't surprised when
They tell me life's not fair around here
But homie, it's your time to make it
They tell me life's not fair around here
But homie, it's your time to make it
