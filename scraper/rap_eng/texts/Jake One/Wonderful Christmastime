[Verse 1:]
The mood is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight (tonight)
And that's enough

[Hook:]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 2:]
The party's on (all night long)
The feeling's here (right here)
That only comes (around)
This time of year

[Hook:]

[Break:]
Ooh, the choir of children sing their song
Ooh, they practice all year long

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
The word is out
About the town (all around)
To lift a glass
Ahhh don't look down

[Hook:]

[Verse 4:]
The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight (tonight)
And that's enough

[Hook:] (x2)
