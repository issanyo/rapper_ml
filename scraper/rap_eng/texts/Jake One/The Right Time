[Intro:]
Shining like a light in the nighttime, loving everything that you got
Thinking that tonight be the right time, to take this party to the next spot

[Verse 1:]
I got you on my mind (on my mind)
Can't stop thinking 'bout you all the time (all the time)
Na-na-na-na-na-na
It happened all so fast, I want to make it last
Na-na-na-na-na-na
So if you want me too, then maybe say 'I do'
I give it all to you

[Hook:]
Shining like a light in the nighttime, loving everything that you got
Thinking that tonight be the right time, to take this party to the next vibe
Shining like a light in the nighttime, loving everything that you got
Thinking that tonight be the right time, to take this party to the next vibe

[Verse 2:]
No one has ever loved me, the way you do
I'll never find another one like you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Shadow me with your love, oh I can't get enough
Na-na-na-na-na-na
So if you want me too, then maybe say 'I do'
I give it all to you

[Hook:]

[Break:]
Allright okey, I never felt this way
Okey allright, let's get it on tonight
Allright okey, I never felt this way
Okey allright, let's get it on tonight

[Hook:]
