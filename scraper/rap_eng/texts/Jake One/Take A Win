[Verse 1]
I hit her with that one-hitter quitter, I ain't talking 'bout a swisher
Talkin' bout what I deliver by her liver, ya'll know who the fuck is with her
Tell that broad they call a sitter, have her actin' extra chipper
Blame it on the extra liquor that was fillin' up my sipper
Don't believe me want the proof nigga that's who I got the picture
Now I'm rollin' in my whipper, cellie blowin' up my hipper
Lakeridge, skyway, RB, Beacon Hiller
Central District I consider where they born and bred them getters
Lots of cats be actin' bitter probably cause they raps is litter
All they albums be like filler, all my tracks I be a killer
But, um, who I rather post up with my crew and sip a Miller
Now we going out for dinner laughing while the scallops simmer
Thought that I was checking messages but I was on my twitter
Pockets fatter from the tunes I made because my pants are slimmer
Ask your mans if I'm a winner, bet they tell you I'm a spitter
Someone ever tell you differently then ask 'em how you figure

[Hook]
We out here every day trying take a win
When the sun goes down then we out again
Do the same every day it's the state we in
It ain't just today, it's the way we've been
It's hard, but if you need it and you want it
Then I got that game for sale
It's just what we do

[Verse 2]
I be writing songs in my head - still my bank account's in the red
Workin' nine to five cause this rap shit won't keep me fed
Till I hit the jackpot, I'm in the kitchen cookin' dope shit like a crack spot
Ya'll niggas don't stack guap
I'm staring at the cascades, that's my backdrop
Now tell me why these cats got the nerve to spit wack shit
Maybe a reality check will make them react quick
Maybe they don't notice the focus that I react with
And if you don't know why I'm the dopest I re-enact it
I'm so low-pro you'd think it was just a tactic
But this is how I'm liven' go 'head and ask those I stack with
I'm so West Coast that's why I love the ocean
Green trees cool breeze and fire we smoking
And I don't even blow but I love the scent
Of the strong Ganja, pardon me while I conjure
Memories of hella fees I used to conquer

[Hook x2]
