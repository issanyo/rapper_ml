[Intro]
Super!
I see you makin' hella noise, but I ain't enthused
Feed me Don, Don, Don, Don Perignon

[Bridge]
Gotta be in a rush, I can't be runnin' out of time
What you mean what's on my mind?
Federal Reserves on my mind
I got the plug online
Go crazy lavish, put the spaceship on Davins
Compellin', you can hear the guns yellin'
I can't take no vacations, I can't lose
We poppin' mollies and they watchin' like parole

[Verse 1]
I see you makin' that lil' noise, but I ain't enthused
Kidnap, no flinch, I'ma set back and reminisce
Fuck that bitch, got a love for water whippin'
Zone 6 nigga ridin' in a V12, that's too Venice
I don't wanna show â€˜em no slack, I gotta get me a sack
Takin' their clean batch, still fighting my demons
I'ma drop my top, get some, I mean this
Shawty give me that mouth while I make a scene with (super sloppy)

[Chorus]
Who knew I'd get this much attention?
Be cool before you get put on suspension
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Monica Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on jet-skis

[Verse 2]
I'm gettin' frustrated and all for us
You see I bought the Bentley truck for us
I put in some hours every single night
Somewhere in the clouds, done lost sight
Khaled put a whole nigga on ice
Fucked on a gold digger more than twice
For the crazy bitches, glance shiesty
Had a crazy wrist, I didn't ice it
I'm infatuated with shinin'
I'm infatuated with shinin' (on my line)
I'm infatuated with shinin'
Give you motivation at its finest

[Chorus]
Who knew I'd get this much attention?
Be cool before you get put on suspension
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Monica Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on jet-skis

[Post-Chorus]
Go crazy, lavish, put the spaceship on that Davins
Compellin', you can hear the guns yellin'
I can't take no vacations, I can't lose
We poppin' mollies and they watchin' like parole

[Outro]
Gotta be in a rush, I can't be runnin' out of time
What you mean, what's on my mind?
P.I.M.P., gettin' that Monica Lewinsky
Chain on freeze, wrist on jet-skis
