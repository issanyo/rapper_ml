[Hook]
Yeah! Ay when you see me, salute
Me like a general I'm leading the troops
I make this G shit look so easy to do
And when you see me salute
Commander-in-chief you can see I'm the truth
It don't matter whether the streets or the booth
When you see me salute
And when you see me salute
When you see me salute
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute

[Verse 1]
Raise your right hand to your hairline
Stand that attention hold it there until you're recognized
Once I return the salutation then itâ€™s at ease, as you were, no conversation
Well, and lets just sayin' what it do G
Decorated 5-star general a true G
Made it fresher off the battlefield
Rep it for my niggas in the battle still
Yea with more stripes then a jail suit
Been in the lead, trail who?
When I fail, through bitches standin their cells
Takin pictures wit their cells
And let me tell you som'n 'bout a playa
Put me anywhere in any jail
And I shall prevail
And if another man survived I shall as well
Now fuck rap got swag for sale
You crossed my path in air Brazil

[Hook]
Ay when you see me, salute
Me like a general I'm leading the troops
I make this G shit look so easy to do
And when you see me salute
Commander-in-chief you can see I'm the truth
It don't matter whether the streets or the booth
When you see me salute
And when you see me salute
When you see me salute
Yeah!, you ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute

[Verse 2]
I abstain from the nonsense
Remain conscious
The idiots make idiotic comments
A convict wit a conscious
You lack moreals I can see your principles
And not what mines is
So I guess what makes me special
Just to get from the curse
Like shit to get you rich at first
So put your dick in the dirt
That's why I don't gotta be the greatest of all time
As long as I keep it real in all my rhymes I'm fine
I ain't lying, give me mine and I'm satisfied
I'm just happy I got to make before my daddy died
And all things considered
Every time destiny called king delivered
None iller a young heart wit a old soul
Some hot hoes and a cold flow
And as far as keepin it real go
Home when you need me
Don't forget the proper way to greet me

[Hook]
Ay when you see me, salute
Me like a general I'm leading the troops
I make this G shit look so easy to do
And when you see me salute
Commander-in-chief you can see I'm the truth
It don't matter whether the streets or the booth
When you see me salute
And when you see me salute
When you see me salute
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute
