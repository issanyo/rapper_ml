[Verse 1]
Who dat? The way you walk, so pulled back
I get it, you work from fitted to snap back
Got the every weekend used to rock the backpack
Get it who you want it when you like it half back
Ooh ooh, smelling like [?]
Ooh ooh, black and white, you so clean

[Pre-Hook]
The way you do girls dirty, life is real
Death to the fake, shit's how I feel
Take how you take it, seen a lot of cases
Ugly truths, be on pretty faces [?]

[Hook]
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
When you see me walk on by, walk on by
Haha, you ain't gotta lie
The whips so clean and he fit so clean
Hit the scuffle on the ground because
The kicks so clean
But I know it real, way you look at me
You kinda made me feel, you know you real (dirty)

[Verse 2]
Thats almost never true
I dont know how to say that i never do
And you could make me a better, do
Let me take you out tonight and put you in a better mood
(nice) you know what to say
You don't wear your socks twice before you throw them away
You drink single malt with ice, you don't know what you got
I'm not saying that I love you I just notice a lot
You, clean

[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah
Uhh, Brand dragon, (yeah!)
And snapping (thus), and packing (thus)
And platinum recipient
A hand clapping
I got receipts, from transactions
I was fighting cases, flying spaceships
Buyin' chocolates, might chime a waitress
Knock the fucker down to get off that wait-list
And get first in line, I be jumping places
You too good for me
Cuz you a women blessed [love]
All that tax-free made me a fucking mess
Still ain't shit babe
I do you wrong
Nikki Jean, whats going on!
