[Verse 2: MC Enoch]

I must be dreaming because everything that I'm seeing
Got me seeming to believe that our freedoms what we're receiving
It's not something you can dream because the greedy will leave you bleeding
Pleading all you want will have your ass fienin until you feed in
So you got to dig your cleat in impeding and plant the seed in
To proceed a new agreement succeeding on those retreating
So we got to start depleting those leading and we're stampeding
To our meeting and our greeting is nothing short of a beating
Because we're past the point of tweeting we're blasting a fascist treaty
And passing cash to the needy while splashing up some graffiti
So just competing it guarantees our defeating
No matter how much they cheating we're taking all that we're needing
And then proceeding to see that we'll be completing
All these things we've been beseeching to people that needed teaching
It only deepens but victory steady sweetens
So grab hold of your allegiance and pray that your ass is dreaming
