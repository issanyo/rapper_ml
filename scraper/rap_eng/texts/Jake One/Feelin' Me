Chorus:
She feelin me my my
My energy
I, I
Just own the beat when I load the beat I I
Keep feelin me my my
My energy
I, I
Wanna own the beat cuz I load your beat and I go to peace

Hook:
Vibin on your stereo image you get to me
You got me thinkin bout you too much
Bringing out a part of me I'm never part of too much
Open inside- you get to me

Verse 1:
Can't reset my code set to blow unprotectable
So hot- burnin whole the block
You turkeys who know that
I'm Tyson in the ring remember one time
I brought the punch line and knocked you out I've eatin out entire lunch lines (proph)
Mmm hungry
Keep a bib on
Looking out for shit that I can spit on I fit on the
News eye list of dudes who spew like this if I'm full physic I'll move my crew like this
To my new tight crib
My California pad
Prolly Hollywood in 2020- vision that
Don't hustle for your first name
Hustle for you last
On the edge I'll keep on surfin
Comfort zone and past
And behind me
I,  bid insecurities bye
Then I ride the bass wave and get a purity high
Throw the nug out
Could it be the beat is surely my high
For lack of better words we build each other's vibe

Chorus:
She feelin me my my
My energy
I, I
Just own the beat when I load the beat I I
Keep feelin me my my
My energy
I, I
Wanna own the beat cuz I load your beat and I go to peace


Verse 2:
Breathe deep and I'm knee deep in a sweet heap of your pheromones
Though I don't really know where I going
I'm deeper than baritones in the zone at the lab injectin heroine
It's the drug of you and I collbain each and every song
To make this very slow jam and make there lips say o dam
How the prophet always know the way to flip the flow and
Rob your whole clan givin me dollars for my showmanship but your
Carrots better suited for snow man dicks
If the
Money been your motive I so damn wish
You could get a billion and then go bolistic
I know to get you sold on this
Yes I know to get you sold on this
Yes I know to get the soul all rich
You must flow
From moment to moment
To moment to moment
Keep your head on straight through this bass at this very pace
Just keepin us focused
It's how I stay focused
Open inside- you get to me
(Can't reset the code, stick around and watch the prophet blow)
It's how I stay focused

Hook:
Vibin on your stereo image you get to me
You got me thinkin bout you too much
Bringing out a part of me I'm never part of too much
Open inside- you get to me

My love
You been the juice you're the juice that got me drunk
Gimmie the bomb bomb bomb
Gimmie the Oo gimmie juice I need your love
