[Verse: Grade Aplus]
They throw shots but they never land I'm pretty boy Floyd
Grade A slash yo main dame's boy toy
Bustin for them Mr. Burns bucks bitch Ahoy hoy
Niggas lookin super salty shouldn't give that boy soy
Sauce wit his rice U know his pressure be high
Especially when he see the #100Trill steppin inside
Sounding like 100 Mill when i step the mic
But 100 bills nigga so much pressure in life
Move pussy fore a nigga make a mess of ya life
Leaving wit some new pussy if i step to a dyke
Nah im lying, i don't be steppin up to shit
They be steppin up to me then i bless em wit the dick
Now go in peace bitches
And if U coming back then bring riches
I know you hate me so wavy you get the sea sickness
Free Max B, these cats be
Biting never giving niggas they credit & thats ho shit
No shit? nah i know shit, cause i heard yo shit
It sounded like my old shit
I seen niggas do less than that & get they dome split
Licky that we rappin not trappin could get ya home hit
Cause if my niggas woulda made a call
Somebody's drawing a weapon & then earasing yall
I'ma PlayStation pussy eating cool ass nigga
Don't make me flip into that 2pac nigga & get reckless

[Hook Grade Aplus]
#100Trill in the front
They trying to see us in the back tho (never)
Murdawoods niggas in this bitch
They think we don't know how to act joe (we dont nigga)
Cain't look me in my eye (pussy)
But wanna give a nigga dap tho
This rap shit is so phoney (hell yeah)
But every rapper know how that go
