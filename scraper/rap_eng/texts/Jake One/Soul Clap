[Intro: [?]]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, the heart, the heart, the heart
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, the heart, the heart, the heart

[Verse 1: [?]]
I couldn't care less about what you brothers be drivin'
So I'm gonna tell you a little about what I've been
Strugglin' [?] for pay that's little more
Than minimum wage, caged birds singing away
I feel [?] send it away
Holding onto the promise that the present hour is soon to relay
But I still remain a slave to the flesh [?]
[?] when your heart and soul have been vandalised
[?] handle mine
And I see your bullshit without a candle shine
In the middle of dark where people practice the art
Of nothing less than overcoming the stresses of life
It's like a vice, applying pressure to mics
We get squeezing, all act like we ain't needed advice
But it's all in our nature so I'm knowin' that it's real for ya
So here's another soul clap to show I'm here for ya

[Hook: [?]]
Can I get a soul clap for all the brothers on lockdown
The brothers on rocks now, with you holdin' the spot down
Can I get a [?] for all the ladies who stand up
To [?] don't need a man, what?
Can I get get a soul clap for anybody out to get it
If you hustlin' [?], walk about it, don't spit it
We puttin' the soul back, back together again
And soul clap for women and men

[Verse 2: [?]]
I walk my soul on the surface, lurking through cracks and crevices
[?] they got brothers trapped, worshipping serpants
[?] pennies, searching for curses in my verses
But God bless, I manifest, I put this fist to your chest
And represent till my flesh is at rest
And when I exit, resurrect through my seeds, connect the words that bleed
The ink from the pen wrote on the pad
That's word to my mums and dad, best believe I'ma finish this for y'all
I got my mind and my physical, spiritual law
Guiding light on the path through the world system
As I spit these lyrics released from my vocal structure
Attack the mic like a vulture, [?] like greek statues
When I smash through the streets with the m-i-c
In my hands, more players [?] my ascention like that ribbon in the sky
I'm living just enough to get by, Lord I try

[Hook: [?]]
Can I get a soul clap for all the brothers on lockdown
The brothers on rocks now, with you holdin' the spot down
Can I get a [?] for all the ladies who stand up
To [?] don't need a man, what?
Can I get get a soul clap for anybody out to get it
If you hustlin' [?], walk about it, don't spit it
We puttin' the soul back, back together again
And soul clap for women and men

[Verse 3: [?]]
Yeah, momma was good to me, daddy was great too
Growing up was nurishing, helped me to grow like steak do
I'm in the lake [?], but I'm trying to paddle back
High tide [?] rowin' [?] cadillac
I'm really [?], but I keep my hopes high
Reachin' for my dreams as I travel, watchin' 'em flow by
I feel so sad, it's real [?]
Either got you stuck in the city or they blastin' ya
Case is pendin', all these cops harrasin' ya
Survive in my country or it's back to Africa
[?] they want the blood like Dracula
Hot spots downtown, [?] up
[?] packing up, since you told me I'm cracking up
Head high, look to the sky, ayo that's wassup
Soul clappin' just another brother that's rappin'
Like I told you before, it's time for some action

[Hook: [?]]
Can I get a soul clap for all the brothers on lockdown
The brothers on rocks now, with you holdin' the spot down
Can I get a [?] for all the ladies who stand up
To [?] don't need a man, what?
Can I get get a soul clap for anybody out to get it
If you hustlin' [?], walk about it, don't spit it
We puttin' the soul back, back together again
And soul clap for women and men
