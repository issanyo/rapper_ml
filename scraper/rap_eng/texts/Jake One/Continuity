Thoughts rumblin’
Overseer’s is tumblin’
Town is talkin’
I’m walkin’
And sportin’
Soul as a comforter

On my shoulders
Metaphoric
I told ya
That lyrics are from spirit
Ain’t hear it
I made clearer

Now
Catch a look at the brow
If see that thing is raised
Then I’m makin’ em proud
If you see that thing is down
Then they making sound
If that shit is still steady tell that figure get ready

Enclosed wit some flows
That are set
To go
I’m imposed by some foes
That are quick to fold up
Know the approach
Ain’t just for show

I been overlooked
You guessed
Ima explode
Implode
Beyond measure

Ruler of wave that’s coming
At 12
Envisioned inchin’
Now I’m raved by public

Take notes
In full description
And hope
The past always pass
And don’t a scratch

Noted that I’m focused
Orgami spitta
Figures hopeless
The way I mold my motives
Fold these figures inta holstas

Posturize the image
That’ll later make me known as
A superficial soldier
With the goals of super novas

Uh
Mind twisted
Middle finger lifted
For the Folk Fiction Figures wit a witty remark

Go hard in light
Not a peep in the dark
And when the crowd steps in
Battered speech is re-taught

See the remorse
A few hours later
Manner over matter
Understandin’ imitators
Blinded by the glamour
So they pampered by nation
Role call
Let em know this art sacred

Face it
We live in a free world
Where figures tend to re-hurl
Substance on a referral
Changin’
Audible
I order to order figures
Pause with gander
Cut the slander
Start to listen

Print ain’t carbon
Bombin’
So I leave my mark
So the past know the present
And the future will talk

Bout the legacy that’s left
Discussion of best
Want my name in the topic
Everlasting effect

Tone
Oh that nice figure
Charter of a legend
So deceptive with the hintin’

Lootin’ is secluded
Think the movement easy pickin’
Reality
Formation could result in a tragedy

Do I have to be the greatest?
Was Jordan only happy cause he drafted in the 80’s?
Is Tiger in the Master’s cause he wanna win it maybe?
Crazy if you think it, see my vision isn’t tainted
