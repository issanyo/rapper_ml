[Verse 1]
I'm a rapper for hire
Call it crap or call it fire
I'm just here to inspire
Wanna blow up like you cut the wrong wire
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
I did nothing to differ from the stereotypes of rapping teens
But so it goes
Designer clothes
I hope Geoffrey Beene loves the fucking promo
Met a girl named Denapholi
She didn't know the half of me
That thought she was the one
Now it's over, done
Feelings were mixed, shouts-out to Emp
Denapholi's the kind of girl that only listens to Future and likes hemp
But so it goes
Another rant video
Now the kids at Wilmo hate me once more
Everybody hit the floor
This fucker's loco
Even though he's white like CoCo
Blasting Genesis mixed with Sussudio

[Bridge]
But so it goes
But so it goes

[Verse 2]
Call me a fucking joke, that's a weak attack
I am a fucking troll, though, you heard the bonus tracks?
Mom's making me feel bad for not being aerobic
Remember when artists you dickrode weren't openly transphobic?
Rap became strong when Chance came along
And sang his silly love songs that made our dicks long
My tracks belong in the trash, I'm really a filmmaker
Just watched the shit I did in 2012 on Movie Maker
Eating that spadinner, I was a breadwinner
Now I'm a new school rapper who can't say...
Ended up a Clipper and not a Laker
I'm immature, got the scissor hands like Kathy Baker
That's thanks to Ken Doll and Jake, they're my bros
We bonded over calling each other fags and quoting Bo

[Bridge]
But so it goes
But so it goes

[Verse 3]
Senior year's coming up, got a lot on my plate
Everybody wants to know what decisions I'll make
Should I chase Dragone again? She dumped John
Or will I be lonely after school on the John?
Seems like there's more cons than pros
I wanna fucking know when I'll get the time to produce a mixtape for CeeTo
But so it goes, you mofos
There's no girls of my kind left, there's only bimbos
My parents bug me about getting my license
But they're having multiple jobs, so their panic makes sense
Fair use ain't shit, so no revenue to boast
CeeTo's gone, I didn't love him like a brother, but I'll miss him most
Now I'm a ghost
Now I'm a ghost

[Bridge]
But so it goes
But so it goes
