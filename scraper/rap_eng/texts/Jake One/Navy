[Verse 1]
It's all love at the court yes
Drunk talk, cold brews on my door step
All the cash in the sky I'm tryna touch that
Shooting for the stars 'til they bust back (blap blap)
Double tappin' thirst, liking all that ass when
Hashtagged that ass out, please go on yourself
You see this nigga not so healthy, not so much that you can tell me
And my money problems, problem probably need a fucking pale G
I wrestle with my thoughts, got caught up
Might fuck around and hit rock bottom
To live and die where I belong
To live and lie with who I want
And then go write about my wrongs
I'm spending time 'n going broke
And fuckin' wit you is all I know
We either gon' fight or imma poke
It's time I climb up out the boat

[Hook]
I don't wanna drown wit you
I don't swim good, I'm not fit for the navy, aye
I don't wanna drown wit you
I don't swim good, I'm not fit for the navy, yeah
So I just sway here, in the water, in the water
Might be safe here, in the water
I don't wanna drown wit you
I don't swim good, I'm not fit for the navy
