[Hook:]
Lost lover, won't you come on back to me
Lost lover, with you I'm in ecstacy

[Verse 1:]
Far too many lonely nights without you girl
Wondering where you out tonight in the cold, cold world
Don't you know that I want you in my life
Don't you know that I need you by my side, all the time

[Hook:] (x2)

[Verse 2:]
What we had was oh so right, can't forget your love
Tossing in my sleep at night, I need your touch
Don't you know that I want you in my life
Don't you know that I need you by my side, all the time

[Hook:] (x2)
