Thank you for listening you three tracks into this
Now its about to get pessimistic and promiscuous
I knew little SoV when he was rapping like shit
Now he rapping like, shit
You don't need to tell yo back story my man
You like the Batman movies we don't wanna hear what happened again
Everybody knows what you was rapping like then
It's all good you just had no essence
I think you learned your lesson
Man I swear i hate interludes
I swear I hate a interlude
Interludes is what rappers do when they can't drop a album that's smooth
So they spit some shit which isn't new
Flowing just as bad as they albums do
They must think it's just gone connect perfectly right out the blue
Why is this a misconception of what interludes do?
Don't get me misconstrued
There is such a thing as a dope interlude
But These Days got as much love as Snoop bitches do
Y'all want fake deep music to vibe to and ignorant vibrations to ride to
Now mind you it's local artist in your city with that real shit tryna supply you
I know I do
I swear I hate interludes
