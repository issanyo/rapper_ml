[Hook:]
They say two wrongs don’t make a right
But it feels so good tonight
They say two wrongs don’t make a right
But it feels so good tonight

[Verse 1:]
I know we all make bad decisions
I know, I know we make mistakes sometimes
But when I'm holding you and we're kissing
Oh girl, I get a feeling I can't describe

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Baby, what the hell are we both doing (come on)
I've got a woman, you got a man (what kind of fool you think I am)
And these endavours that we're pursuing baby, you know
Well, the shit might hit the fan

[Hook:]
