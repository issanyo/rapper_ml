Stepping in the puddles of another truth
My acid rain stained rubber boots
Stepping in the puddles of another truth..

[Verse]

Favor of God to the souls growing through infantile stages
You're blessings, seeds, trees… crops, stocks, investments
I bleed on this canvas for your namesake
Painstakingly ancient manifestations, of poetic rhymes
Spoken in your honor, as you navigate the spirit life
A solemn prayer as you blow your fist, to roll the dice
The voodoo mothers protect your slumber from poltergeist
The rhymes flow, so sonically and sublime
Like tonic-tequila-lime poured up over ice
Let the record spin
I’m a walking selection of Black African diaspora hymns
70's soul stirring samples and burning candles
Half Baldwin, a quarter Farrakhan -- running a marathon
Another quarter made my spirit lessen
I was petrified to realize America had gentrified our essence
Costs rose, we sold, they took hold to erode the message
I can feel the rain falling, precipitation, weather I can or not
Cloudy thoughts, the decision making is so distraught
Discrimination and trigger happy policing
Lives taken... taken... taken... Liam Neeson
Prison petitions and wickedness kicked by 1 percenters
Perverted clergy pimp religion for every incentive
Metal machines by the lever squeeze of a neighbor
Plow many trees from these acres
Turn many seeds from Creators to Ghosts
The way I float every note that I wrote so notably
Got soldiers on each coast, on their planes, boats, to be close to me
Capitalism still killing all my niggas off
A lack of wisdom confuses VALUE for what it costs
And I’m misused, yet confused
On how to unearth this worth, when I can’t skew my views from the news
Scouring filth, I’m showered in guilt
Every time I spend a dollar in that system where the powers get rich
I know I’m hated by you
My dick is black, enormous and not intimidated by you
My faith is empowering, towering over all your idols
To stop the rise of Black Messiah before arrival
Fuck it I hate you, I won’t debate you or stand beside you
I'm feeling Blue so I channel Heru within my spirit
The Nazarene seen fleeing through the halls of kemet
This is more than a vision, I abhor your decisions
This a War of Attrition
It is written in ancient code, by those cloaked in robes whose souls opposing omission
Your wickedness is a disease taken hold of your bones, and I pray for remission
I pray for remission... I pray for remission
For the men, women and children, repeatedly mistreated by policing divisions
I'm Colin Kaepernick, seated in pleated pants, my stance damning your decisions
No fuck it, I am Othello in yellow gold Cuban links with a Moorish ambition..
