[Verse 1]
The devil thought he had me, I was on back burners
Moonwalkin' fast, y'all respect my journey
Evil tappin' in like the Feds was watchin'
No album, no dope, I was all out of options
I'd rather rob than get a job, don't insult me
Remember it was nicks and dimes in '03
I was doing bad so I took your bag
Tables turned, lessons learned, karma come back fast
Flipped off that bitch, milly rockin' the wheel
200 thousand in the bank, straight to hospital bills
Momma still got the shakes, prayin' I'm all right
Dreams of enemies in the lobby when I hit the lights
So many niggas be wishin' they was you bro
Same niggas that hit you with that, "I love you bro"
Tread softly, see the snakes comin', I pop 'em off me
Nigga, my life costly

[Chorus]
Bitch, where?
Tell me you a real one, bitch, where?
Tell me you gon' kill some, bitch, where?
Say you in the field, huh? Bitch, where? (erehw, hctib)

[Verse 2]
Battle scars and tribulations, downfalls from the situations
I bounced off with dedication, accounted for my participation
Gettin' pounds off, gettin' rounds off, gettin' blocks back I facilitated
When I sound off, you a groundhog, that's a casket and a pillow waitin'
Magic in a dope spot, four chickens, that's Popeye's
More spinach, that's Popeye, four women sippin' Mai Tais
I'm a cold nigga, free my guys, free P.I., free Pooda May
Free Shooter Ray from the five line
We gon get money or die tryin'
Jay Rock and I'm back, bitch, watch out, blow your back, bitch
Be cool, yeah, relax, bitch, I'm only speakin' facts, bitch
I been through the bullshit to the pulpit up shit's creek
Been a nuisance to my OGs, got a new sense 2018
Put that on the bloodiest, whip clean on the bloodiest
Bitch cling on the bloodiest, pull up, I'ma fuck with it
Slide in for the tape deck, got a best friend, she say less
Fake threats, I'ma fade that, either pay checks or I pay debt

[Chorus]
Bitch, where?
Tell me you a real one, bitch, where?
Tell me you gon' kill some, bitch, where?
Say you in the field, huh? Bitch, where? (erehw, hctib)

[Outro]
Lock and loaded, I control it, rock and roll it
Don't you notice, I'm the coldest?
Lock and loaded, I control it, rock and roll it
Don't you notice, I'm the coldest?
Lock and loaded, I control it, rock and roll it
Don't you notice, I'm the coldest?
Lock and loaded, I control it, rock and roll it
Don't you notice, I'm the coldest?
