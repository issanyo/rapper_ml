[Bridge]
It's good to be home, waiting, forever a day
When we get alone, it's never a waste
I'm good with the pen, she said no you're great
And I wanna be yours, like everyday

[Hook]
All these songs I'm making, play for you on purpose
We all night long getting wasted, but the hangover was worth it
The hangover was worth it, that drank we on was working
We all night long get wasted, but the hangover was worth it
Ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya ya

[Verse]
Talk my shit when I don't have to, one nose ring and she wanna tattoo
Got a lot of fake friends and they all act cool
Girl I want that thing when I come back through
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Oh shit, I wonder what you call this
Wake up in the morning feeling tossed
Gotta be to work, but forgot to call the boss
Fuck that nigga, he don't give you want you want
You that good, you that bomb, you that nug in my bong
You get off and we get home, its all the same in the morning ya

[Bridge]
It's good to be home, waiting, forever a day
When we get alone, it's never a waste
I'm good with the pen, she said no you're great
And I wanna be yours, like everyday

[Hook]
All these songs I'm making, play for you on purpose
We all night long getting wasted, but the hangover was worth it
The hangover was worth it, that drank we on was working
We all night long get wasted, but the hangover was worth it
