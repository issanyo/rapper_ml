[Chorus: Choklate]
So long as the sun
Shows up to play each day, keep goin’
No matter if I make my mark or fail
Just keep goin’
Even though we set the standard
High, so high
We still ain't reached the sky
So there’s nothing to do but keep goin’

[Verse 1: Chali 2na]
Hey, now that my rough past life is finished
I'ma break glass and push past the limits
Friendship shared between cats diminished
Now I'm movin' like I just got my bus pass replenished (keep goin')
No road block can hold [?] I protect my whole block
Like a leprechaun and his gold pot
And I'm not gonna stop 'til I reach what I perceive as the top
No matter the obstacle, I gots to keep goin'

[Chorus: Choklate]
So long as the sun
Shows up to play each day, keep goin’
No matter if I make my mark or fail
Just keep goin’
Even though we set the standard
High, so high
We still ain't reached the sky
So there’s nothing to do but keep goin’

[Verse 2: Chali 2na]
This is a race to waste nature
In the pursuit to chase paper
Leavin' the loot you play it safe as you chase the undertaker
Never gave praise to the creator who made you (keep goin')
I was hit with hardships
Practice, now I'm tight as a lit cigar tip
And I spit some bizarre shit over big guitar riffs
And hit the target on some shot in the dark shit, but
Love can make your heart rather see through
Delicate 'til it defeats you, raw edict lethal
My hustle reflects my people
When I speak, you get lifted as heat in D2

[Chorus: Choklate]
So long as the sun
Shows up to play each day, keep goin’
No matter if I make my mark or fail
Just keep goin’
Even though we set the standard
High, so high
We still ain't reached the sky
So there’s nothing to do but keep goin’

[Verse 3: Choklate]
Somebody asked me how I was doin’
"I'm fine, things [?]
Ain't nothing wrong or right about it
Turn on the light and please shine bright
That star out there is the [?]
And even when you don’t do
What you should, pull yourself back
And keep goin', keep goin'

[Verse 4: Chali 2na]
Draft the plan, set the standard
Before those with jealous intent test your manhood
Never get your hand’s dipped in slander
Even under pressure come fresher than canned goods
Man, listen, what you think, I’m supposed to just give in?
Stressed, never come out those just sit in?
Asleep, snoring, rather be flowing or be keep goin'
Knowing that I sow what I reap, but I got to keep goin'

[Chorus: Choklate]
So long as the sun
Shows up to play each day, keep goin’
No matter if I make my mark or fail
Just keep goin’
Even though we set the standard
High, so high
We still ain't reached the sky
So there’s nothing to do but keep goin’

[Outro: Choklate]
Hey, hey
Hey, keep goin'
It don’t matter where you are, keep goin'
I fell on my face today
It don’t matter much, I’m'bout to play
Heep goin'
