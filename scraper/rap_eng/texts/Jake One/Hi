HI!! And stay that way
This is "Jake One"
And like the {fuckin} Avril I'm tellin you to hear this
I want all you little kids
To go out and steal money from your grandmother's brassiere
To take it from your grandfather's underwear
From your mother's purses
And from your father's pants pocket
If you're a little older
I want you to go and take it from the whore on the corner
Bust the junkie, or a pusher
And buy the {fuckin} records, that's on "Rhymesayer"
Alias, Scratch Records, or the Soup
Formerly the Soup Label
It's available on tapes... uhh {*laughter*}
Tapes and records, and newspapers
