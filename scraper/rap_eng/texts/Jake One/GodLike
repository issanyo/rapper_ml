Damn... Im just tryna find the right niche
Lay my voice down
Nice pitch better grip for bicyclists
And nuk roll like big boulder
Moutaintop headshop leanin on my left shoulder
Shit and all this tanglin brain cords
We godlike on skateboard
No excuses while i pay for it
Dedication current state form
Ill insure that like im state farm
Well tamed like my Lyrics behind a snake charm
Better focus yea Ill stay warm
It seems I know what I need
Just my microphone box nice bong and some weed
Stage one see me grow from a seed
To forest fulla trees far as eyes they could see
Honestly I just want it to be
The overall occuring theme happy obviously

(I want music on this mind
Music on my mental
Yes I fuck bitches
Make love to instrumentals)X4

Said id feel alot better cheesy cheddar to swiss
Lyrisist i twist my blunts gon smoke better than this
And me i seem to be lazy
Ain't it crazy to think
Lil andre half black'll flow leaky kitchen sink
I'll find the perfect place to dwell live as well as i would think
Wanna get out and sail say it smells like the beach
Growin slowly like a whale soon my tail is what i'll breach
Im long gone not deceased I like serenity peace
And why you into me feast your eyes on this rapping beast
My most favorite beach with intoxicated beats
Smooth sailin with the winds calm blowin me far
But at a slow pace patient cuz im nothing but raw
I smoke blaz√© blah laizzaifairre copin wit matters
Rattattatas they scatter pigs feed em ain't nothin but fatter
My daddy always fuckin told me dont take them wooden nickels
From them niggas or them bitches always thought this was ficticious

Til this
(music on my mental
Yes I fuck bitches
Make love to instrumentals)X4
