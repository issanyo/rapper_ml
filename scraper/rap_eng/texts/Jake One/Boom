[Verse One]
I've been smoking marijuana J's all day
Thinking "Good God Almighty, I've been smoking all day."
Now I'm high, thinking "Shit, I should write a couple raps."
Now I'm high, thinking "J's got some mahfuckin' blaps."

Yeah, yeah you heard it right
I fist fight with socialites
I run around with socialists
You Masa, you my A-Alike
I hear fight 'bout to pop and I'm always down for a scuffle
Put that pistol back before you make mad in this mahfucka
Old school heads say I'm dope (Aye, you dope)
New school heads sayyyyy, "I don't know rap music but your ass movement"
We the mass movement
Working class southern Cali shit
Ooooow
And booming and booming on that bass drum supplied
By that Jake One guy homie, fuck one time
When you say it in a song it ain't nearly quite as strong
As when you say the same thing with a rifle in your arm

[Hook]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, someone turn me up (turn me up)
Ayo, ayo, someone turn me up (turn me up)
Ayo, ayo, ayo, someone turn me up (turn me up)
Ayo, ayo, ayo, Jake turn me up
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick boom
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick  boom

[Verse One]
Yeah, yeah, you might've heard I've been at it few years
I was there when the Alitron on Vermont burned
I've earned the reputed reputation of a guy
Who ain't shy
Tell a rapper to his face I don't like
And like what you 'bout to do?
Make a diss rap for me?
While your home girl opening my disc wrap for me
Writing on her CD, "Peace, serve the people please."
Read books, when I'm done they get used to break weed
Then we break it down, build it up, talk about it
Dialectic rhetoric, fuck it
(Homie let's be 'bout it, 'bout it)
Bout the time we get recognized, bunch will organize guys
With my brothers, sisters and my family at my side
I don't know, I do know that I've been poisoned since my school lunch
Rather have a million comrades than a million bucks
Rather help care be for everyone than for some
It's that working class southern Cali shit homie
Ooooow
And booming and booming on that bass drum supplied
By that Jake One guy homie, fuck one time
When you say it in a song it ain't nearly quite as strong
As when you say the same thing with a rifle in your arm

[Hook]
