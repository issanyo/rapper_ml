[Intro x2]
Send your boy your naked photo, photo
Let me show you how to L.O.N.O., L.O.N.O
I’m ‘bout to shower know you got me, got me
That body looking so godly cause lord knows

[Pre-Hook x2]
Time gon’ stop
Then my eyes gon’ lock
And my lips stay sealed
I can find no words
Got to shoot my shot
I don’t care who watching

[Hook x2]
Wassup girl, I want y’all
Come in
Wassup girl, I want y’all
What they say now
Wassup girl, I want y’all
Come in
Wassup girl, I want y’all
What they talking 'bout

[Verse 1: Dave B]
She frequent fly and never trip
I sneak in a piece of mind, she let ‘em whip
Let that boy cook
Wonder what you got a taste for
What’s the hold?
Wonder why I got to wait for
Send me something good when your flight land, baby
Bend it over for me on the night stand, baby
I’m in love with the slow-mo
I’ve been patient all day but you already know though, nasty
I don’t understand why they tripping if you ask me
Told you I was trouble if you heard me on the last beat
Wonder what you have but I be running where the cash be
Smoke a nigga, have your friend never try to match me
Cool
And I know you want to run
Know you like the sun when I wake up to your bun
Send that to me like you love me
Only one really ain't an option, option

[Pre-Hook x2]
Time gon’ stop
Then my eyes gon’ lock
And my lips stay sealed
I can find no words
Got to shoot my shot
I don’t care who watching

[Hook x2]
Wassup girl, I want y’all
Come in
Wassup girl, I want y’all
What they say now
Wassup girl, I want y’all
Come in
Wassup girl, I want y’all
What they talking 'bout

[Verse 2: Dave B]
It’s cool to kick it
It’s nice when you here but it’s better to miss it
Then visit
I hate y’all and I love that
Fuck rap, where’s Tom, where the nuggs at?
Told her the bed spread is ready
For Netflix and heavy
Them double D’s is right
That Ed, Edd & Eddy
You came for a sin
She left, broke the levee
Thirst is not fiction
Them niggas ain't been ready
I don’t get it, prolly never will
Shae butter beauty, baby
How it'd better feel
You city niggas hate to love me
Know I’m better still
Got a better queen
And she hella real
All day...
All day...

[Pre-Hook x2]
Time gon’ stop
Then my eyes gon’ lock
And my lips stay sealed
I can find no words
Got to shoot my shot
I don’t care who watching
