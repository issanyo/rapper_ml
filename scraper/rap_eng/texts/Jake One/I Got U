[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
Baby I feel so good inside ‘cause I got you, yeah I got you
Baby I feel so good inside ‘cause I got you, yeah I got you

[Verse 1: Mayer Hawthorne]
I feel so lonely for a long, long time
I never ever thought that I would find someone to hold me
Someone who cares
When I stare into your eyes it sends me flying in the air

[Pre-Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
It’s the touch that lifts me up and turns my life around
Your love just takes my feet right off the ground (Nothing can get me down ‘cause)

[Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
Baby I feel so good inside ‘cause I got you, yeah I got you
Baby I feel so good inside ‘cause I got you, yeah I got you

[Break: Mayer Hawthorne]
You are the one for me, so glad I got you girl
And I’m the one for you
You are the one for me, so glad I got you girl
And I’m the one for you

So glad I got you girl, it feels so real

[Verse 2: Mayer Hawthorne]
I can’t believe you got me sprung this way
You got me saying things I’d never say
It sounds so crazy, but it’s true
Whether with you or without you all I think about is you

[Pre-Hook: Mayer Hawthorne]
It’s the touch that lifts me up and turns my life around
Your love just takes my feet right off the ground (Nothing can get me down ‘cause)

[Hook:Mayer Hawthorne ]
Baby I feel so good inside ‘cause I got you, yeah I got you
Baby I feel so good inside ‘cause I got you, yeah I got you
