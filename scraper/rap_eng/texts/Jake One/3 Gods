[Verse 1: Slytedge]
The Misadventures of Adventure Time
If we talking extensions u better mention mine
Gloc 9 sending tension down ya spine
Lil wayne sipping on syrup like he's f****** Aunt Jemime
Yo I heard through the grape vine that people tryna make wine Meanwhile I'm out here grinding tryna' make mine
Ain't with a penny or nickel chick im with a straight dime
Costing me 10 cents per blow and this her 8th time
I guess it costs to be the boss sometimes plus that ass fine
Breaking all the laws guess someone had to pay the ass fine
But yo girl's booty ain't as fine and that's fine
This tape's the first step to my destiny
The first step to the top crown
In other words dont mess with with me(cuz we kings)
Clearly I'm spitting to be the best MC
NYC or NJ has ever seen, after Biggie,Nas,and Jay-Z
I'm influenced heavenly, my melody's like kenny G
Flow like Kevin G, Kendrick told me I got the recipe
I eat well, my feet smell
Talking shit I'll pop you in ya mouth
Then ask you how ya teeth feel
I will kill,any other faggot tryna f*** with me
Custody ,I'll never see, one lie and you've lost trust in me
Blast this shit through my black bose speakers
As my money grow stronger, enemies grow weaker

Damn!
Gametime
You got this J

[Verse 2: pOVERTY]
Been goin' hard since my PBJ game
Only took one selfie and got mad fame from it
But you still see me on the street spittin in a bucket
That's cuz it's the shit, I'm never gonna quit it
Hear my voice you know I just lit it
Imma hit it gimme a sec I'll spit it in a minute
Peep me chillin in the Maybach
Maybach, caught a bitch with a great rack
I got stacks, no packs
I smack these tracks
I don't play lax, but I lax
That's re-lax
This rappings outta sacks
I attack yo' fake plaques while I'm spittin' these asscracks
Smoke crack, no fact
Eat others like they snacks
Put em in a casket
Shoot em like a basket
Smack em like a racquet
Yo' bitch ratchet you know I smashed it
But I keep it secret like... wait what?

[Verse 3: 711kid]
Y'all thought I was joking!

Lady killer like I'm Cee-Lo
Green, just like my kilo
Got my pimp suit on look like bigpapifilo
Got a scar on my face like I'm Al Pacino
Spongebob and I in Shell City at the clams casino
Have a hick on my neck
And my dicks just as wet
Cuz I just knocked it out the park like the Great Bambino
I stay kinda angry
Kids wanna hang me
But I'm at the climax and they still rising action frankly
Played all my cards not gonna break my neck
Stats ain't gonna drop
Now I'm on the Upper Deck
And all my music Topps
I dropped all of my shit quick
"It'll only take a couple months"
Just like my rapping funds
Couple thousand on the whip?
Boy you need to cool it
Got a 9 on my hip
Now who got the cool shit
Snap necks like they pencils, girl with eyebrow stencils
I'll see you in the back, get you twistin' like a pretzel
Scribbles in my notebook
Dribble like I'm Westbrook
Sell my old stuff to get a new look
Make sure to never follow by the book

Yeah , what's up?
Play like I'm Kyrie
Say hi to Kylie, don't really talk but I'm tryna keep it rhyming
Chase, J, and me?
That's like biggie, nas, and pac
When 3 legends get together we can shut down the whole block
Don't look with your hands I seen you actin' dirty
I know you want my shit, I'm fly just like a birdy
Sleazy motherfucka that make people wanna mock
She actin' as a dick sucker, give Courtney the Cox
Dealers slanging crack, I ain't talkin' no smack
I'll use my kind words, hows damn funny is that?
If I got off here, would I miss the train?
That would take on the path to get in another lane?
Sugar just like the cookie
I won't fuck with no Snooki
New to the game not a veteran
I'm better than half of these bitches up on Letterman

[3 boy...]
