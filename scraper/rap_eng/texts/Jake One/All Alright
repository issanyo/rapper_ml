[Hook]
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright

[Verse 1]
And I got the call soon as the day hit night
As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside
I stopped the car and came outside
Cause I know that tone
I remember the first time
We wished upon parallel lines
Waiting for a friend to call
And say they're still alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I've given everyone I know
A good reason to go
I was surprised you stuck around
Long enough to figure out

[Hook]
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright

[Verse 2]
And now all my loves that come back to haunt me
My regrets and texts sent to taunt me
I never claimed to be more than a one-night stand

[Pre-Chorus]
I've given everyone I know
A good reason to go
But I came back with the belief
That everyone I love is gonna leave me

[Hook]
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright

[Bridge]
And I know, ohh no
You've fallen from the sun
Crashing through the clouds
I see you burning out
And I know, ohh no
That I put up a front
But maybe, just this once
Let me keep this one

[Hook]
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright

And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
