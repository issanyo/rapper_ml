[Hook]
I glow, I shine, I flicker
I streak, I sparkle, I gleam, I glitter
I glow, I shimmer, I flare
I flash, I floss, I glisten, I glare
I glow, G to the L to the O, W
I'm coming through on the low
I glow, I shine, I flicker
I streak, I sparkle, I gleam, I glitter

[Verse 1]
You can't stop me from shining
Extreme and bright, it seems I write beams of light
I spit it out and watch a star from the block glide
Each bar of it is like carbon monoxide
You can't handle the glare
You look between ya hand and you'll stare at the man in red animal hair
You tryna front like your rhyming ain't cut like a diamond shape
Dominate with timing who I got to accommodate?
Feel in charge of killing squads, still the Sarge and General
Fiending to blow a minimal of a million large
Illuminate, make you vomit, word to Muhammad
Islamic, my pens blowing like comets when I palm it
Jotting down lines that conceal electricity, leaking
Thinking with light bulbs over me blinking
I just begun to pot the running spot, stun you not
Like I shot a hundred watt, son is hot

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Create an illy scene, here's what I really mean
I make the whole city glow like the video for Billie Jean
Posses it, I was destine to be florescent, you less slick
Guess it's just the finesse that you blessed with
Got correct lines to do what effect's mines
The kind that eject fine, electronic music
When I, blaze the art, split your small brain waves
Apart with grace because I'm laser sharp to faze ya
I know you saw the flow slaughtering
You switched to flame to melt, the same as throwin' water on a witch
I'mma live wire for hire, fire you an entire splurch
So jump up and get blew out like fire works
I clearly glow, electrifying as Mysterio
Theories show, materials blow inside the stereo
I'm nasty, heads just send me to be flashy
Cash me, out amounts, I'm 'bout cashin' the last G, I glow

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
The midwest in the building
We shining from here to St. Louie back to Chicago
I flow, I'm so pro
I could go fast go slow for you hoes no
Watch me, if you livin' Islamic or Christian
You are now about to witness the strength of knowledge and wisdom
I'm never outta position
I play my position above backboard, El and Royce is back for more
Plaques nigga, this shit a breeze
All the Mark K parve to chill the sleeves
Five finger shoppin' at Louie, get up the sprees
Dorado in the air, I'm 'bout it, give up to speed
Get's my stray on, my mistress I spray on
Watchin' the Pistons at the same floor they play on
Play on, we on the wood nigga pray on
Physically good in the hood, niggas in the hood be like, "They on"
Yeah, God lit a fuse with me
And you the best rapper is just news to me
The rhyme potent, this nine toting, best rapper from the D
Since the death of the late great DeShaun Holden
