[Verse 1]
When I met you last night baby, you looked oh so lovely
I wondered if I got to know ya, if you might be the one for me
Next time you're feelin' kinda lonely
Just pick up the phone and give me a call
And you can be my special lady
And I promise baby, we can have it all

[Chorus]
Cause I have never met a girl
Quite like you in the whole wide world
Oooh because
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ooh now that we got our thing in motion
Never gonna slow it down
I'll give you all my devotion, till we're six feet underground
Cause you give me all the loving, all the loving that a man can take
And if you're feeling tired baby, just lay back and I'll give you a taste

[Chorus]
Cause I have never met a girl
Quite like you in the whole wide world
Oooh because
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none, yeah

[Bridge]
Oooh and in the game of love, to steal my heart
Girl you know you're burning up the charts
You're rising to the top
And in no time, you leave the other girls behind

[Chorus]
Cause I have never met a girl
Quite like you in the whole wide world
Oooh because
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none
You're number one, second to none, yeah
