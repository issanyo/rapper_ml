[Intro - Freeway]
(Aaaaaaah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Aaaaaaah)
(La-da-daaaaa)
Uh, uh
(Yeah, yeah)
(Aaaaaaah)
(No more cymbals man)

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
Uh, she like something out of Maxim, the real Swimsuit issue
Told her I miss you, I'll be back soon
Hold the spot down until I'm back home
Her girlfriends downstairs, her little nephew in the back room
But I don't mind cause she, on her job
And she, drive a nigga wild when she slob the knob
And she, throw it back when I hit her from behind
Every time, that's why I had to make her all mine, yeah

[Hook - Sample from "Mary Jane" by Rick James] (Freeway)
She makes me feel alright (she do)
She makes me feel alright (yes she do)
She makes me feel alright (she do)
She makes me feel alright (woo!)

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I had plenty chicks, big booty, one skinny chicks
Spanish mamis that don't hardly speak the lang-o-uage
She always yellin "Papi Chulo", while we at it
Then she ask me if she teach me Spanish, will I teach her Eng-a-lish?
Don't be ridiculous, ya know I'll teach ya
She say "Who's bicho? What that mean? Who's ding-a-ling is this?"
I told her "get it right, it's yours"
Her coochie so tight, every time I hit it, hit walls
Hit it all night, hit it more in the morn'
Flew her in like a kite, even hit it on tour
Hit in on the sofa, hit it on the floor
But told my new chick her coochie not addictive like yours
Right on, Freezer get his nighty-night on
After I beat it up, she put me to sleep like s'mores
Light snores, then she wake me up to back rubs
And I'm back up, fin' to beat it up once more
Now once more, Freezer was once a whore
Now she got me locked, Bush approach - shock and awe
She hit the supermarket and food shop and all
Then she top me off, swallow the whole cock and all, yeah

[Hook] - without "woo!" at the end

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
I think I like her cause she make me laugh, make me smile
Go through her act because she know she got that snapper-pow
Oh, you don't know about that snapper-pow?
That's that action that pull you back in when you backin out
She grab the burner, said she thuggin out
She say "you think we gonna be Ike and Tina Turner? Boy, you buggin out"
I told her "I love you, I'll never hit you
Except for in your coochie and your mouth"
She said "cut it out"
We actin out, playin cat and mouse
I still snap, she come to the flat unannounced
Unless it's trench coat, no clothes underneath
She hold me down, stash O's at her mother's house and her brother's house
We maintainin, she said "I ain't complainin but you need to find another route"
I said "another route?"
She said "yeah nigga, another route, another way for you to gain payment"
This is so heinous, it's a shame ain't it?
I still had to move them things when I became famous
I got my babe with me and we are game changin
We about to tear up the lane, you better clear it out

[Hook]

[Outro - Freeway - talking] - w/ ad libs
Okay, Freezer
Uh huh, yeah
Behind every good man, it's a strong woman, it's
Y'all know, you know the saying
You see, you see Barack, you see he got Michelle in the background
Ya know what I mean?
You see how it's goin down, we doin it real big, ya know what I mean?
That's how it's goin down this year and the years to come
We on our shit niggas
