[Intro: Danny Brown]
I could never be your friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is
I could never be your friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is

[Chorus: Portugal. The Man]
But i can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
You ain't got nothin on me
You ain't got nothin on me
Hell no we ain't homies
Smoke that kush all by my lonely
I can't trust none of these niggas
All for self my nigga go figure
If you ain't bout them figures
Then no i can't get whitcha
But you ain't gettin salvation
Magazine and that pistol
And another way that you trippin
You ain't gettin subscriptions
Thats what I stay to myself
Everyone they care for theyself
If you ain't helpin my wealth
Then its best that you just step
I just smoke and drink til i pass out
Everybody wanna hand out
Got bandz on me no cashin out
Stay low key like a stash house
Drivin round with them racks out
Make the girlfriend tap out
With her back out till she blacked out
Now she comin back like a crack house
I could never be yo friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is
I could never be yo friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is

[Chorus: Portgual. The Man]
But i can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

[Verse 2: Portugal. The Man]
Your mama's got nothing on me
Your daddy's got nothing on me
And the world that sleeps in its lunacy has got nothing on me
No stars got nothing on me
Your son's got nothing on me
And the fool who sees it's the thief that leads has got nothing on me
You know it's not because the light here gets brighter
And it's not that I'm evil
I got a friend in the devil
But I can't even be your friend

[Chorus: Portgual. The Man]
But i can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

[Outro: Danny Brown]
I could never be yo friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is
I could never be yo friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is
