Woke up to the
Yo i’m cousin frankie and I

Woke up to the sun with the praises
Prayed for today
I’m feeling great on occasion
Matter fact amazing
Tides with the bass dawg frankie with the statements
And we looking for some change
Flipping records in the basement
I’ve been waiting
Ine wanna be impatient
But the troubles pilling up to the ceiling from the pavement
I’ve been pacing working steady on the basics
But they’ll hit us with the papers if we miss another payment
Mad patient
Never am i lagging
I’ve been slipping  i’ve been lying
I’ve been swimming,  i’ve been writing
I’ve been buying from niggas who got the scales like a dragon
Smoking like a cabin, pants steady sagging
Education is the key mother nagging
But i see education as the key to a station wagon
I pray the tape is banging, all year
If you bout to start the swim lil nigga start here
