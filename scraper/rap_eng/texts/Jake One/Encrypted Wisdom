Napoleon Da Legend [verse 1]

Show me who’s successful who behind em benefits
Put a mirror to they face notice em get sensitive
Everything you know about rappers I’m the anti-thesis
I’m what happens when you mix the soul with some arithmetics
Made music selfishly mixtapes is infamous
Soon to be litmus test for other lyricists
Broke down the system refusing to be victimized
That’s Signifies I stand by my brothers like I’m sigma phi
Epsilon High echelon spit til my breath gone
Then You can send the contract and now let’s it get it on
Smif-n-Wesson song next level lexicon
Standing next to devils that pentagrams is a hexagon
Like the shape of France I don’t wanna slave for bands
Carved a path and built my temple I don’t need to make a band
Started to read speaking like a educated man
Smuggling contraband through an entertainment brand
I got a greater plan currency is trading hands
Paint a picture on ya wall without having na spray a can
Graffiti rhyme scheme nerfitti mind reader
Holding the down the fort like Hotel Rwanda Don Cheadle
Got em addicted heroin needles on the vinyl
Final call peep my word like it’s on the Bible
Speech is homicidal sub-consciously I travel
Divine geometry that sub-atomically attract you
Deuteronomy the second law mood swings
Like wrecking balls These rappers gassed up on ethanol
Part of me is Escobar nah I don’t connect with y’all
Doing squats my legs are sore taking baths with epson salt

Nejma Nefertiti [verse 2]

Nefertiti Adirondack flow you already know
I’m too futuristic and advanced for ya’ll to catch me though
Where intellectual meets the ghetto I’m flexible
Freedom fighter stance this injustice unacceptable
Not to the right of you
Not to the left of you
On another level, so much more impeccable
Legendary like Napoleon multi dimensional
Revolutionary unforgettable professional
You lacking common sense and consciousness it isn’t sensible
Far beyond the usual volume 10 times the decibels
I am exceptional sexually irrepressible
They couldn’t take my soul when I did 5 up in correctional
I’m too respectable to deal with ya’ll unethicals
They ask me what my secret is I eat my vegetables
Dope fiend rap Donald Goines you susceptible
Smacking on them veins my word form injectable
Commemorative mint condition a real collectible
Going up in herstory undeniably ineffable
I am the Tao of lyricists there’s none identical
Ride the beat like a super shero it’s all intentional
You talking too much shit while grabbin on ya genitals
Homophobe behind doors a bonafide homosexual
Anything you do I do it better on my menstrual
Keep it 100 like a perfect score on a test in school
Not impressed with you annihilate a sesh or two
Trifecta personal Venus grace a perfect pentacle
Across 5 points 6.7 mill authentical
Abundance only is my new mantra plentiful
