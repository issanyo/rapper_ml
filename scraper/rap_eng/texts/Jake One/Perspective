[Intro]
Uh, oh yeah
Man I feel real good right about now, hahaha
I go by the name o' Grynch
I'd like to welcome y'all to Perspective
Ay yo [?] good lookin' out
My man Jake One on the [?], let's go, uh

[Verse 1]
The first day o' the rest of my life
It starts now, break's over
Time to step to the mic
I ain't been sleepin' very good
Man I been restless at night
Been wide awake up in the darkness
Get this [?] with some light
It's time to get it right and start alignin' the stars
And spend less time at the bar
Instead of rhymin' these bars
Been climbin' real far
Damn it's been a year since my first show
And I the released the first row
Know just how each verse go
[?]
But I don't do it for vanity
See a lot of cats that do and end up losin' they sanity
I just believe in what the music can go do for humanity
It's a cold world but it can help us through this calamity, you see
I used to only care about bein' the best and see
Now I care more about if people can connect with me
Thirsty rappers, hands down
Wanna shout so desperately
Will sell they soul for props and worry 'bout they family secondly
This rap game is a circus, is it worth it?
Nothin's perfect but I swear the jealousy, it hurts it
[?], hostile enviroment
If I could afford the top spot with a sense of entitlement
My cats are 'sposed to bow down with all you spit
The four words I live by: "Nobody owes you shit", look
I started with a boombox, just rappin' in my basement
My dream I started chasin', then I got complaints and
I got my honda back to sound, pros no cons
I rapped for oh, so long, then came that Volvo song
I heard a lot of folks try to say it isn't hip-hop
The fuck gives you authority on what is and is not?
Yeah I'm just tryna do my thing
Cool if I'm gettin' some props
I'm talkin' Billboard when I say I'm tryna get to the top
And I appreciate if you like what I spit in a verse
And y'all I love this rap shit but need my happiness first

[Hook] x2
Tryna' get perspective
I been all away and I ain't tryna switch directions
But where I'm at now, and where I'm goin' be, see
At the end of the day it's all me, it's all me
