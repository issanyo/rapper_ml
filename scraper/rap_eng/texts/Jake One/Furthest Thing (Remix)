They say I talk too much
I just chill and record
But I bet they listen now if they didn’t before
Been 'round the track and back
Practicing lyrical acrobatics
Way past a magic trick I composed like four scores
And seven years ago, Lincoln up at my Bar Mitzvah
With shiksas, ‘cus Rivkah, was getting too vanilla
This beat’s bananas, and I am a gorilla
Got this killer flow, trigger finger gripped around my pen tho
I’m dope as fuck, never let myself believe it
I don’t need to reach your goals always been an overachiever
Left the bar behind to start and try competing with myself
I make stars align ‘cus I’m inclined to try and harness the 12
Signs of the zodiac, retrograde I throw it back
Young Gemini, fuck with me? see how my clone reacts
See I’m a nice guy, there’s no opposing that
But my bad cop put you under arrest like cardiac
Ha, coronary degraded
Left your brain in the basement
While I’m up here in a spaceship
Now I’m planting seeds of creation it was time to invert
Jumped up, tried to reach the heavens now I’m in the dirt
Rise to the top, my hop’s insane
I’ve got this beanstalk to blame
Shot me right to this height no stop
This is not a complaint
But I got too hot, fuck homeostasis
Shot in the dark, ball’s in the park
But I’m rounding the bases
Racing the clock, but I stay pacing
No use in wasting my breath
I’ll meet you at the finish line where I’ve been waiting
In layman’s terms I aim to be better than the best
Snatch the throne rip it to pieces then I lay it to rest
Yes Lord
