[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Let me tell you how I feel
This the same life I dreamed about when we was kids
And since I got a couple M's
I ain’t gon’ preach to ‘em, but let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I say they know that I’m a loose screw, pockets on that Bruce Bruce
Nigga lose it all, bitch act like she never knew you
So I don’t catch feelings baby, I just keep it neutral
Let her stay a couple nights, I hit the road, I’m through with you
These niggas amateurs, fuckin’ on these models and these actresses
I keep it under wraps cause
Bitches runnin’ game and I know they ain’t slick
She gon’ meet a ball player and do the same shit
I swear this shit is hard, gotta watch for these niggas and these broads
Ain’t no friends turn frauds
Still waiting on the day a nigga try to pull a card
Loyal to this thing of ours, my youngest down to risk it all
Been a young star, back to back in them cars
In the streets my life was hard so every day I thank God
All praise to Allah, blessed we made it this far
Studied the attraction law, she want me to hit it raw

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Now let me tell you how I feel
This the same life I dreamed about when we was kids
And since I got a couple ills
I ain’t gon’ preach to ‘em, but let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
I remember trappin’ all winter
Know I kept it killer, January to December
I was in the trap all day gettin’ faded
Boomin’ like Metro til it got raided
Learn the rules to the game ‘fore you play it
They gon’ ask you, better not say shit
Cause what you say gon’ be used in the court of law
He wasn’t built, got in that room and he told it all, damn
Thought that was your friend right?
He should help you do that ten right?
He was with you smilin’, riding in your Benz right?
You was on top, but that shit ain’t air right
Out witnessing the judge’ll lose you
He ain’t even send you money for a pack of noodles
Thought he was real but he fuckin’ fooled you
Different hood, same story, it’s the fuckin’ usual

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Now let me tell you how I feel
This the same life I dreamed about when we was kids
And since I got a couple M's
I ain’t gon’ preach to ‘em, but let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em

[Verse 3: Common]
Pyramids and stars on garages
The Gods is plugged in the streets catching charges
He used to serve from the crib and his daddy was the sergeant
Black Life Matters, before we was marching
My squadron stretched from 87th to the 9, real niggas on the grind
With the power to refine, Know good wine and crime
Expensive watches and niggas doin’ time
Everybody wanna shine, the young stars aligned with us
We used to fuck they babysitters, now these young niggas is hittas
On the streets they deliver
I was that nigga that rolled up and smacked niggas
Now I yell “Free Allah, bless the trap niggas!"
Cop lights backlit us, the spotlight
Made niggas wanna clap niggas, Black bigger lifestyle
From Rothschilds to White Owls, livin’ for the right now
My niggas never lied down
Don’t sleep on my city, we keep it a buck fifty
That’s why I fuck with Bibby, hear me?

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Now let me tell you how I feel
This the same life I dreamed about when we was kids
And since I got a couple M's
I ain’t gon’ preach to ‘em, but let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
