[Verse 1]
Tell me the truth
Baby girl, who else been with you
It's gon' come to my attention either way, yeah
And I understand
Baby girl, we all had a past
I'd much rather hear the truth come straight from you

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I love you
It'd be just for you
So when I'm touching you
Can I trust in you?
Can I trust in you? Oh babe

[Chorus]
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are confessions of a new lover
True colors, true colors

[Verse 2]
What's done is done
Now that I'm the only one
If you tell me I'll accept what you've been through, oh yeah
And I don't believe all this inconsistency
I've been hearing different stories about you

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I love you
It'd be just for you
So when I'm touching you
Can I trust in you?
Can I trust in you? Oh babe

[Chorus]
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are confessions of a new lover
True colors

[Bridge]
Baby, show me you're a keeper
It's been hard for me to keep up
You've been tryna keep me in the dark
But baby girl, I see you
Baby, show me you're a keeper
It's been hard for me to keep up
You've been tryna keep me in the dark
But baby girl, I see you

[Chorus]
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are confessions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
