This the only time you gon' see me like this

So you enjoy that shit~!
You enjoy this shit right here
I don't care
I don't care about shit
You dealin with it now
Bring that shit way down please!
Now who cares about that damn shit I recorded?
Now look at it, they bought the album to hear the thing
Now who gives a shit?
Bring it down please (let me talk)
Way down, just, slow it down, and make it funky
Like we always wanted it to be
{DO IT!}
