[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen
On the piano tonight, to my left, your right
Is Jake One
And I am...

[Verse]
Big, bad, body rocking, failure is not an option
I been grinding 9 to 5 like Dolly Parton
Art for talking, make them lean like oxycontin
Not for nothing but the dream sequence kind of vibrant
No, I'm not a prophet nor am I proselytizing
My assignment, to take my little light and shine it
They can not define it so they want to water it down
Got to colonize ground and commodify it
Put you on a diet of this honest pious
Modest live wire writer piping loud enough to start a riot
Heart of a lion, both eyes open wide
Soul in overdrive, you duly notified
Bonafide North Side, alma mater
Yeah, my momma might have got us out of there
Still though my heat is near
Home base Mosque is there, took my Shahada there
When I'm out of here, I swear to God I drop a tear
Nothing is new under the sun
And so I'm doing what's been done
By those who trooped though and proved it can be won
Truth is that these musicians grew me as their son
So you're a philosopher, my uzi weighs a ton
The fluid native tongue, the true creative hum drum
Blessed it in that melting pot, the two became as one
Recognize an old soul with new school influences
Soothing music oozes through him like he blew a kiss
Jinn really do exist, I submit the proof is this
Truth is the broken heart is harder than the human fist
I'm too committed for that superficial foolishness
Got to wear the shoe that fits even if it's a crucifix
Wallace you are truly missed, pardon all your human sins
My douer is you living the garden and it's purely bliss
We still bear the fruit of his Houda that was beauty kissed
Before Gabriel pick up that horn up and play that tune of his
You won't let the humans live, let the humans love
Let us never dictate who is below and who is above
Let he who lives without sin cast the first stone
Most high hung up the phone, hear the dial tone
