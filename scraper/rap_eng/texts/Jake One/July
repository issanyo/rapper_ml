[Intro]
You know I've been around the block a few times
Felt like I had it all figured out
Then you walked in with them Isabel Marants
And that je ne sais quoi
And just threw a wrench in my whole situation

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hotter than July
Darling don't you know that I
I thought I had it all
Then I found you
I thought I had it all
Then I found you

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey
Laying here drinking
Rum and coke and lime
Ceiling fan is trying hard, now
Working overtime
Handed you my coldest bars
Trying with all my might
Wishing on my lucky stars, oh
Please don't say goodnight

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hotter than July
Darling don't you know that I
I thought I had it all
Then I found you
I thought I had it all
Then I found you

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey
Soon as I came across you
Looking so damn fine
Instantly my other prospects
Left them all behind
I thought there was no greater love
Than the one I had
Now you're the one I'm thinking of
Girl, I need you bad

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hotter than July
Darling don't you know that I
I thought I had it all
Then I found you
I thought I had it all
Then I found you
