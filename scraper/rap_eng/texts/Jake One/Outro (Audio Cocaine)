[Verse]

Catch me at the right time
I could prolly front you a kilo
Speaking in codes
They phone tapping
But don't know our lingo
Hopped off that porch
I had no choice
Word to Johnny Cinco
Audio Cocaine
I'm moving pianos
Out the bando
Niggas wanna plot on me
They tryna put that red dot on me
Just to see if I got that knot on me
Catch me slipping me
Man I hope they don't
Stay on my PQ's
So better yet I know they won't
For keepsake
Let me knock on wood
If a nigga could
Then he prolly would
Never will I chase a chick
Before I chase comma
Word to Chance
We gone this paper
Put that on my mama
