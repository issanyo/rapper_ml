Buh uh, ladies and gents, the Mercedes, the Benz
I get 80 percent of a major event
Better go, better go let it go, I set it for yo, pathetic flow
You don't know what you headed for (huh!)
From no riches to breaking down blunts with bitches
And funny niggas still act like they want the business
While you better make a run for the gun store
You know me as god's child setting your soul free
The poverty stricken, Wallabee kicking, top quality spitting
Make them all holler "he hitting" (huh!)
I get lustful over the knowledge I desire so
I expect of my women what a college may require
Well-trained (huh!) Impalas by the fire
So when I come around, acknowledge that I'm fly-er (huh!)
I'm the west coast rapper with the best flow
And who gon' protest that? I'm too fresh

That a way! in Manhattan at a matinee
Michigan, with a chick again, Alize
Let's go to Mexico, checks to blow
Off that, very special, the extra o
We off to Miami, with my family
And I give you the business while sipping the privelage
Then scoop to East Oakland where all my niggas hear me
Light green smoke then sipping on remy
It's on me, cash, and Dame Dash
Sipping on army with bitches on Harleys
Or esaurito with my good friend del
And all we ever drink is white zinfindel
Now check it out
