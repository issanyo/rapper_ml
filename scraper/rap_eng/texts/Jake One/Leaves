[Hook]
I can get ya what you need, I’m a goner
With the wind like leaves in the autumn
Money hoes greed, that’s the motto… I follow
Pop-pap-pa-rah, dah-da-rah
Dah-dah-dah-rah
Pop-pa-rah, dah-da-dah-rah
Pop-pa-rah pom

[Verse]
Pursue a proper passion
Push the margin past, put the world up on yo back, bwoy
Ain't no user guide for being black, or a student
Or gay, or just caught up in the trap
Bought a million kicks and not one of them made you faster
So much for the bitches, not one of ’em made you master
The word ain't got advice, but I’m tryna find it with mad skill
So you found a light, used to purl up inside the half shelf
Always something that they need you to know
I ain’t needed it tho
Fuckin’ niggas up on his feet for bein’ the moment
Just zonin’, meet my cojones, ’em lazy niggas said no
Sign for revival, just might miss your blessing
Flow so nice, man, it’s kind of ascension
Pulled from my vice, got my mind over mentions
All this advice like I like the prescription
Sway like the best in my grade
I don’t think they got a glove yet for catching a fade
I don’t think they got love fo’ niggas lackin’ their faith
You ain’t the pusher, you the plug, nigga, get you some weight

[Hook]
I can get ya what you need, I’m a goner
With the wind like leaves in the autumn
Money hoes greed, that’s the motto… I follow (Hey!)
Pop-pap-pa-rah, dah-da-rah
Dah-dah-dah-rah
Pop-pa-rah, dah-da-dah-rah
Pop-pa-rah pom (Hey! Listen!)

Pop-pap-pa-rah, dah-da-rah
Dah-dah-dah-rah
Pop-pa-rah, dah-da-dah-rah
Pop-pa-rah pom
