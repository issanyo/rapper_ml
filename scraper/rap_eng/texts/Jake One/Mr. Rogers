It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood
I’m feeling good I’m feeling great, just the way I should
And I ain’t with the drama, no used in getting bothered
Cause it’s a beautiful day, call me Mr. Rogers
It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood
I’m feeling good I’m feeling great, just the way I should
And I ain’t with the drama, no used in getting bothered
Cause it’s a beautiful day, so call me Mr. Rogers

[Verse 1: Grynch]
This is real, not The Neighborhood of Make-Believe
I’ma take you round my way and tell you about some things I see
I walk about the spot, look at the Volvo
Nah, I ain’t bout to roll today, I’m on my stroll yo
The sun is shining so I’m rocking some shorts
I walk to the north, a few blocks and stop at the park
I take a deep breath, yeah the air is deep fresh
I used to kick it here in junior high, to get high with my dudes and vibe
Before that, it's where little me played little league
Reminiscence for a sec, them days they were the shit to me
And yo they still are, now it’s time to keep moving
I’m walking down the hill, bumping beats to make it soothing
Once I hit the bottom, I left the 24th
Seen a couple kids and the ice cream truck they running towards
It’s funny y'all, I did the same thing, I feel alright
And I ain’t worried about a damn thing, I tell you why

[Verse 2: Grynch]
At the top of 24th, a right on 85th
I feel it in my soul, for sho' today’s the shit
So I can let it pass me bye, I gotta savor it
This is the kind of day a lot of folks could only pray to get
So I just walk from the east, headed down the street
See my dude roll by, since way back, been down with me
And now I’m headed to the Garden, that's Golden
Summer time, there I kick it in the park with the homies
Chilling by the beach, I peep my surroundings
As I look around, I see the mountains in the distance
And the Puget Sound
I love my town really, what can I say yo?
My lunch for today yo, a sandwich at Paseo
Grubbin' in the sunshine, taking time to unwind
No drama clouding my mind, truth be told, I’m fine
Ain't nothing gonna change it, yep I feel alright
And I ain’t worried about a damn thing, I'll tell you why

Mr. Rogers:
There’s something very mystical and wonderful
About how music can touch us
You know, it's elemental
And I think
This must be what heaven is like
