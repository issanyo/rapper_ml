[Verse 1]
Living in a time where life is cyber
You the type to think that everything you pry is your two cents up in a cypher
You just need to quietly admire my desire
Get inspired by a higher form of life or just retire
A riot's only fire, it's the ingredients inside of you
Wood you, tiger I'm Mike Tyson, I'm iron
Meaning you say you would, when I only say that I am
And my universe is only too adverse, there's no trying
Sci-fi pioneering, scientific tie-in
A falsified environment, you save your life with a right click
You dogs high and mindless on the mic and when I'm lying
You can stop me then, you're not even excited to recite it

[Verse 2]
Worlds colliding, your rhetoric is silly
And I ain't hustling, I'm building, ain't a thing that's built quickly
Could only be, dim see, you could dress it up pretty
But a weak foundation, I could break you with my pinkie
Sniffing up all the blow, getting your body swole
But I look inside your eyes and I can know your hallowed soul
Lying to yourself from the moment you press go
You brought it on your own, you're only known for what you own, yah
Chain is gorgeous, but you didn't make it
And your drugs are flawless, but you didn't create it
Then your clothes are immaculate, but you were born naked
We all die, our legacy the only thing we take with

[Verse 3]
Listen now, we're living through this digital age
Even though you ain't locked up in no physical cage
Still gon' need to see your way all through that mental maze
Each new innovation puts us deep inside a case
Picked up all the scriptures and I flipped through every page
Looking for some proof that these are not the end of days
Every single sacred relevation's been displayed
Only thing that ain't been happened yet, the dead have not been raised
You forever passing, 'til my paths are made of passion
My intoxicated, toxic break your thoughts you couldn't fathom
You gon' get the gat [?], you earned it, up up and at 'em
Like the first man on that planet, out the bad shit that done happened

[Verse 4]
I'm doing really really well, living in a minute in hell, like it's a citadel
Where the million listeners under my spell, so they couldn't even tell
Anytime the ignorant prevail, I skip bail and and end up tipping the scale
That rude truth still get telled, keep on lifting up, prevail
My soul, too gold, too broad to fail and it isn't for sale
Even with the pressure to prevail, I shall not crack like the Liberty Bell
And in the days and months to come, I say it once so listen up well
Y'all are selling nature heaven for a digital hell
