I’ve been out here on the grind
I haven’t had the time to say hello
(I don't have time)
But you stay on my mind
And you’re still looking fine
Got to let you know
(Still looking fine)

Looking at your picture
And I can’t wait
To be with you
And now it’s time to play

And I’m back in town
I want to dance tonight
I want to feel alright
And I’ve still got your number
And I’m back in town
I want to dance tonight
I want to feel alright
So call me on the under babe

I’ve been all around the world
Seen a lot of girls
Never one like you
(No one like you)
And I know it’s been a while
But answer when I dial
And I’ll come right through
(I’ll come right through)
We can have a toast to this interim romance
(Short term romance)
And we’ll make the most of what little time we have
(The time we have)

Looking at your picture
And I can’t wait
To be with you
And now it’s time to play

And I’m back in town
I want to dance tonight
I want to feel alright
And I’ve still got your number
And I’m back in town
I want to dance tonight
I want to feel alright
So call me on the under

Reservations cast aside
‘Cause we only have tonight
And before our time is through
Want to take a chance on you

And I’m back in town
I want to dance tonight
I want to feel alright
And I’ve still got your number
And I’m back in town
I want to dance tonight
I want to feel alright
So call me on the under babe
