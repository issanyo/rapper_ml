[Chorus:]
It's so good, it's so good
It feels so good to me
It's so good, it's so good
I don't wanna stop now
It's so good, it's so good
It feels so good to me
It's so good, it's so good
It's where I wanna be

[Verse 1:]
Something about it feels so right
So certain that I can't refuse it
It's got me holding on so tight
And I don't ever want to lose it
Ooh I can't get enough
No I can't get enough
Of the magic touch thats sure to make you go high
I can't get enough
No I can't get enough
Of the magic touch thats sure to make you go high

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Ooh I feel it burning up so hot
That sweet sensation that you're sending
I'm gonna give it all I've got
And make that magic never ending
You know
I can't get enough
No I can't get enough
Of the magic touch thats sure to make you go high
I can't get enough
No I can't get enough
Of the magic touch thats sure to make you go high

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Oh just come close to me
Don't stop it no
Like it's supposed to be
Don't stop it, go
