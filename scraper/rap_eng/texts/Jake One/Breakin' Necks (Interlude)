[Intro]
Good weed, good rollies
Moon blow
You know it

[Hook]
Saint Laurant, baby Mom
Breakin hunnids, breakin necks
Breakin hearts, breakin bank
Wear a brace, breakin necks, yeah
Breakin necks, breakin backs
Get a brace, breakin necks
Breakin heart, breakin bank
Breakin break, breakin necks

[Verse 1]
And if I do have you
And you deceive me, I'm a be clear on this, I'm a call you the sweetest amnesia
Cause if I bag you, I'm a have you And if I have you
I'm a tag you, and if I tag you, I'm a take you and if I take you I'm a taste you
And if I taste you I'm a eat you and if I eat you, you know more
And so for what I no longer wanna know y'all
And if the show must go on, I'm still the fuckin bomb
I'm a forever do mine...  Boom, I better do yall
Or walk

[Hook]
