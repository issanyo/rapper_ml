[Chorus]
No matter what your circumstance, just turn and watch the dance
The movement puts you in a trance, just turn and watch the dance
Forget about that dull romance, just turn and watch the dance
You may not get another chance, just turn and watch the dance

[Bridge]
Just watch the dance now, watch the dance now
Just watch the dance now, watch the dance now
Just watch the dance now, watch the dance now

[Verse 1]
There's something about the way she does it
A recipe that's guaranteed to turn you on
And always got you thinking of it

[Chorus]
No matter what your circumstance, just turn and watch the dance
The movement puts you in a trance, just turn and watch the dance
Forget about that dull romance, just turn and watch the dance
You may not get another chance, just turn and watch the dance

[Break]
She's got my undivided, it's got me so excited
Just turn around again and play me like a violin
She pick it up and drop it, I'm reaching for my pocket
No women, no regret, she'll take what she can get

She's got my undivided, it's got me so excited
Just turn around again and play me like a violin
She pick it up and drop it, I'm reaching for my pocket
No women, no regret, she'll take what she can get

[Verse 2]
She's got you smelling like her favorite perfume
She knows it over, you can see it in her smile
And now there's nowhere else to turn to

[Chorus]
No matter what your circumstance, just turn and watch the dance
The movement puts you in a trance, just turn and watch the dance
Forget about that dull romance, just turn and watch the dance
You may not get another chance, just turn and watch the dance
