[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
Can't live without the greats
Can't live without the greats
I can't live without the greats
Eat before I say my grace
But I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't live without the fucking greats

[Verse 1]
I can't live without the greats
All of those that inspired you that are great, to be great (yeah)
I can't live without the greats nigga (yeah)
Eat before you say your grace
Haters in your face, they can't live without the greats
Cause your, great

[Verse 2]
They can't live without the greats
They compare, you debate, no return or rebate
They blow your head up, paparazzi shoot, you deflate
Only kin to your relatives, other niggas can't relate
So they hate

[Verse 3]
They can't live without the greats
I'm moving states to states
My state of mind is outer space
Moving weight, the flame got a fire rate
Niggas pointing fingers like King Kong on Empire State
I see ’em in my rearview tryin’ catch up, I Andale
I’m a lyrically physics
Calculate and I calibrate
Worth no procrastination, move up from ade-quate
