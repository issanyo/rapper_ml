[Verse 1]
Turnpike hustler the best out
Yall niggas shitty like the motherfucking rest stop
Flyin up 90 on my way to the Chi
Ain't gotta say I'm from Cleveland they can see it in my eye
They can see it on my arm Im rockin' it 'til I die
Just let me smoke my kush, just let me live my life
Just come to all my shows you hoes learn to comply
You come home with me just know we cutting all night, now
Glockbustas, St. Clair, Olympic rock pushers, old schools that swing doors on all you cocksuckers
Been makin' noise, how the fuck could you not hear us?
Ahead of you haters like this Lex don't got mirrors (gone)
[?]
He made it out of that hell hole, miraculous, Cadillac, Infiniti, Benz, and Acura's, Chevrolet with them catpillars comin' after you

[Hook]
Whip game so dangerous shit ought to be a crime
No wonder police behind me all the time
Swag so cold this shit ought to be a crime
No wonder lil' mama be calling all the time
Whip game dangerous it ought to be a crime
No wonder police be staring all the time
Swag so cold this shit ought to be a crime
Step out and pull hoes everytime

[Verse 2]
Uhh, back up in this bitch just like I never left
Hoes stop, pause drop, jaws take another breath
Bitches gaspin' for air there's too much swag up in here
P-o-l-o cologne, just a dab of that there
24's on them, sitting back in the chair
Told my nigga Big Duke put the grass in the air
At the airport tryna sneak the grass in the air
Was in the A-town now we back in the Clair
(nigga) Getting mine hope you didn't mind
Out here they catch you sleeping and it's sleeping time
In these raps over these beats, call it killing time
Patron in the zone, I call that feeling fine
Nigga Im the only young nigga you wanna find
Kicking ryhmes like I'm still livin' in the beginning time
Then I shine, my niggas hustle, forever chasing paper
Servin kush by the acre [?]

[Hook]
Whip game so dangerous shit ought to be a crime
No wonder police behind me all the time
Swag so cold this shit ought to be a crime
No wonder lil' mama be calling all the time
Whip game dangerous it ought to be a crime
No wonder police be staring all the time
Swag so cold this shit ought to be a crime
Step out and pull hoes everytime
