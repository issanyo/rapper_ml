[Verse 1]
Last night I tried a little Adderall
It was working for a while
Until I thought about your smile
I got that fire cali medical
But it never gets me high
Baby only you know why
Cause darling

[Chorus]
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you
Can help me
And I can't get enough
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you (only you)
Can help me (you can help me)
And I can't get enough

[Verse 2]
I sip that ginger ale and Hennessy
But every drink inside my glass
Just makes me think about the past
I tried that MDMA ecstasy
And it only brought me down
But know whenever you're around
I know that

[Chorus]
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you
Can help me
And I can't get enough
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you (only you)
Can help me (you can help me)
And I can't get enough

[Bridge]
It's like you're made inside a laboratory
Just for me
It's like you're made inside a laboratory
Just for me
It's like you're made inside a laboratory
Just for me
It's like you're made inside a laboratory
Just for me
Ooooh girl the only one I was is

[Chorus]
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you
Can help me
And I can't get enough
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you (only you)
Can help me (you can help me)
And I can't get enough

[Outro]
Only you, you can help me
Only you, you can help me
Only you, you can help me
