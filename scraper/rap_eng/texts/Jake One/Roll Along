[Verse 1:]
Hmm, you know you got that certain something
The way you steps, the way you move from side to side
I sure can put no one above ya
The way you smile, you know you really drive me wild

[Hook:]
When I dance with you, I can't control myself
If I can't have you, I don't want no one else
Well I try to get you off my mind
To get you off my mind, to get you off my mind
Oh but I, I can't leave you behind
I can't leave you behind, I can't leave you behind
And as long, we must be apart
As long as we're apart, as long as we're apart
I will roll, along, all along
With a hole inside my heart

Ooh, I keep on rolling babe (x3)

[Verse 2:]
I wish that night could last forever
It's been so long, but I think about it everyday
You know no one can do it better
I can't move on, all these feelings just won't go away

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
I've been waiting for you all my life
Till we can be together
I've been waiting for you all my life
Till we can be together
I've been waiting for you all my life
Till we can be together
I've been waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
