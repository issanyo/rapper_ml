[Verse 1: Freeway]
Hello world, this my PSA
I know I said a lot of things that I ain't need to say
But today is a new day
And you know I rep my city, I'm in green and gray
Flyer than the sky, I'm a solar system
Call Diamond Supply when I need a lay
I wonder why they lie when they know we listening
If he was alive, what would Jesus say?
Some Jewish, some Muslim, and some Christian
One nation under God, we gon' make a way
They trying to build a masjid next to Ground Zero
Y'all need to stop being weirdos, let them people pray
Hey, stupid is as stupid does
How can a educator burn books?
We were innocent kids turned crooks
Now we trying to make it to the straight way
You could call me Straight Way
Shout out to the homie Stray A
And the other homie Spook doing a lot of days
Held without bail, that's a lot of strain
Used to be in Harlem with l's, that's a lot of haze

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
Back to do it again
Same old thing on a different day
Early
From the 2-1-5
That good that'll take you high
Oh, I'm back to do it again
Here I'll stay, and I'm still here, baby
Early
Let me take you, take you high

[Verse 2: Freeway]
One of the best people that ever did it
Though I made some rash decisions that was quite foolish
Fab say he the best that ever Twitted
Well, I'm the hottest spitter that ever Googled
Keep it plain and simple so I don't lose you
Gotta follow rules if you gon' play
Gotta do the job right if you want pay
In other words, get it there if you gon' move it
When He remove your breath, what you gon' do then?
When it's time to meet Him, what you gon' say?
Freezer work hard like every day
Even the Grim Reaper's on they job doing
I can't wait to start my own movement
Freezer got that good music like Kanye
Only difference is, I really used to grind yay
I was out hurting my people, that was so stupid
Exclusive, Slay Flex Clue shit
Freezer on a mission for redemption with the music
Child of the ghetto, look how talented our youth is
Jay-Z babies, we just following the blueprint

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freeway]
You could be speaking through your music, you so clueless
You could be giving them the news on YouTube
You can give it to 'em raw on World Star
Ain't no people from the ghetto on the real news
We move around the world while the world moving
You trying to fill my sneakers, that's some large shoes
Want to kill your own people, that's a harsh move
Icebox where it used to be, his heart ruined
Crazy thing about it is we all human
All eat, all defecate, and all bleed
You better moved at Godspeed
First save yourself, then save your children
That's what you need to do, that's what I'm doing
Hope you get the message, flow precious like the ruins
I'm Bilbo with the flow because I'm known to get to it
Fishing rod flow cause the flow bait you in
These other rappers stink, they material is fake
And the mister eating Frosted Flakes, they became truants
Jewelry fake, story fake, what are they doing
Leave it up to us to continue bringing the trueness
Shit!

[Hook]
