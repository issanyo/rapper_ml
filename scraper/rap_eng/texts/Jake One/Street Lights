[Hook]
The street lights just came on (x4)

[Verse 1: Grynch]
Yes sir, just trying to live my life before my time expires and
Balance what I truly need and all my desires
Who I admire, those not scared up in the line of fire
Motivated to succeed I's focused on climbing higher
But some don't now they ghosts up on the corner man
Gone without no warning damn they never reached the promise land
Now a mothers more than fam got ribe like a sonic fans
Time flies seems like yesterday she seen a sonogram
At times it's hard to stand in the end just hold your own
This food right here is for your dome for times you feel so alone
Gotta choice of going home and so you go and rome
And even if you do right evil folks still be throwing stones
I pour a drinking and reminisce about all the summers past
And pours some for the dawgs that have past, the miles on the dash
Our clock went fast you were right from the start
I hope this verse can be a light in the dark like the street lights

[Hook]
The street lights just came on like (x4)

[Verse 2: Grynch]
One time, just trying to live my life before I leave this earth
And I burn to ashes or my body sent to sleep in dirt
Thinking bout' the people first cause some go and delete they worth
I hope that on the other side the sufferers are reimbursed
But who knows? Am I wrong to question God's existence
Been losing my religion from a view that has cause division
Don't blind your vision try to see within the time you're given
Don't mean everybody but some write spending their lives just sinning
And lies they're swimming so on that note i'm on the fence
Until that comet says it come when it all makes sense
Blame my mind don't blame my heart just trying to make my mark
On this world before i'm gone time to crack this makers mark
I pour a drinking and reminisce about all the summers past
And pours some for the dawgs that have past, the miles on the dash
Our clock went fast you were right from the start
I hope this verse can be a light in the dark like the street lights
