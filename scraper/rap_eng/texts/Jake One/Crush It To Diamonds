[Intro]
This is Soul Khan of the Brown Bag Allstars
Tomorrow’s a legend day
So we gon’ make history right now
All over your face
Motherfucker
(Let’s get it poppin’)


[Verse 1]
Ayo, I’m sharper than thumbtacks
You gargle the nutsacks
Of any dude that acts hard that’s charged of the gun rap
It’s a man’s world, but the fathers and sons act
Like they can’t choose between the heart or the stomach
Well pardon my dumbass
I’m just a witty youngin’, wildin’ out like Jimmy Dugan
Silly drunk, and titty suckin’
Put on for my city, son, it didn’t give me nothin’ but bad lungs
And cats frontin’ like my shit ain’t bumpin’
You are what you eat, then I’m falafel and puss
Catch provocative looks
Like Moses when he told him that he talked to the bush
I’ve seen skies burst into flames and lives worsen
‘Cause P seems harder to find then fly virgins
This Brown Bag approved
The illest on the planet, damn it, I am not amused
These elevator music makers never made it through the maze of [?] jealous traitors
Time to show and prove


[Hook] x2
There’s poise in the hustle in my environment
The boy in the bubbles, now a man on fire, shit
Today makes me want to raise my tired limbs up to the sun and crush it to diamonds


[Verse 2]
When I rap, all beats be like scantron cheats
‘Cause I’m thoroughly bubbling but I [?] needs
The family stone, grabbing it slow by the memories
You dramatically moan. Where’d my sanity go?
On the corner of suck this and clean your face up
Face like Bill Gates but I smear your makeup
Life like hopscotch and I’m playing with landmines
The way this man shines gives the planet a tan line
Can’t wax on, then get out the dojo
Ladies leaving stains on the couch like Soul Glo
The scene and the culture need a reupholstering
Fuck that
We really just need [?]
Heart of a God, but my arteries clogged
With chunks of MC’s so I’m starting to jog
If this exercise ain’t gonna rectify
I’ll inject your hive with my insecticide


[Hook] x2
There’s poise in the hustle in my environment
The boy in the bubbles, now a man on fire, shit
Today makes me want to raise my tired limbs up to the sun and crush it to diamonds
