[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
It’s all a test
It’s like
It’s almost like an experiment
God’s experiment
When are we gonna understand
That we are put on earth to love
That’s all it’s about
Everybody wanna to figure out
How complicated life is
Break it down
This is what I truly think
War gon keep going on
Frustration gon keep going on
Anger gon keep going on
Until we finally come back down to the
Simplest word
Love


[Verse 1: Peter Labeaud]
What does it mean to preach
What are the preachers not preachers
What does it mean to die of thirst
With a glass of what if your hands
Wishing it can quince the worlds thirst
What is it I’m not getting
When sitting in front this church
Feeling cursed as I burst into flames
Rehearsing a verse
While you reciting they verse
Been told you we don’t wanna hear that weak shit no mo
You swim good but you’ll still drown
Don’t say drown with me
I’m not Sam Smith
I can’t stay with you
Can’t tip toe, kick in the door
Wave in the four four
Fuck your litigation, litigation
I’m penetrating ‘till I’m DDT
And yo son and daughter look up to me
But I’m not role model, what’s a role model
And when Hennessy and novocaine don’t numb the pain
Do you give in, do you say fuck these dreams and being all that I can be?
I ain’t shit never gonna be shit
That’s a question to ask yourself
Be real with yourself

[Hook: Peter Labeaud & Dylan Derish]
I’m back up in my ways (Back up in my ways)
Back up in my ways
Back up in my way (Back up in my ways)
Will I ever be (Will I ever be)
Will I ever be
Yeah


[Outro: Mehkai Orion]
One of my biggest dreams is, you know
Making a difference for my family
Making a difference for the community
My brother and sister gotta grow up in
I wanna be apart of something like that
I want my music to be universal
Like, I wanna be able to reach people, you know
Give people something they can vibe to
Something they can party to, you know
Music to think about and raise your kids off of if you wanted to, you know
‘cause it’s bigger than just laying down a sixteen and not saying anything worth taking from it, you know
And I think that’s what it means to “Walk on Water”
Being you, No matter where you come from
Especially for me coming from Chicago, you know
Being yourself, accepting who you are
And loving who you are and giving guidance
I think, Once you figure out that
You can do anything with it and that’s real talk, you know
And that’s how I feel about that
