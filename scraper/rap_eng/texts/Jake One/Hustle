Hustle Lyrics

Intro:
Hustle hustle hustle oo oo x2 (yeah yeah yeah background)
Can you hear me?
Hear me out, hear me out y'all

Verse 1:
The cleanest style with dirty beats on the file I got you yakkin up bile been very ill for some while
Said I got that flow and I know been swimming the Nile for so many fuckin miles defying these crocodiles
I'm every inch on the dial so versatile I put these people on other shit- take a hop on the pile
Don't need that calculus do the math I'm immaculate craft a kick a clap a hat and then a melody matchin it I told you I was Dracula when it came to this niche I'm bound to get that cake and then sink my teeth I'm the back of it
Run it down in the sewers acing a marathon- Underground prodigy proph3cy hit the finish line
Way before you- but surely I assure you- I'm more than paranormal please don't compare me to mortals
Scramble samples and cook a beat on my panel
Then i scortch a sixteen bars- hot as our mantle
Credit idols eventually that I'll meet ima breath this heat that I speak if you hear it hit me a tweet and I know my lyrics are deep as my meat inside of a freak coulda let me skeet on the sheet but she seperated her teeth- Knew that anything I produce is known to be sweet
Strap my con-verse on my feet- after beat I ain't got a lot time of time on my hands- so understand- I ain't joinin fraternity man- I got a plan

Chorus:
Hustle hustle hustle oo oo x2 (yeah yeah yeah background)
Hustle

Verse 2:
How many more syllables I gotta rhyme together to make em mention i'm better than any rapper with cheddar
Lemme make it known  i been restricted to letters that you abuse your records I never delt with borettas
Skin color and weapons just ain't in my preference- so If thats what your lookin for look another direction
Know what I'm sayin- i'm high minded and topical like a bottle of hemp on your follicles fake rappers
I'm just another obstacle another hot summer without a popsicle pain in the ass audiological
With  drive of several cylinders hittin optimal speeds- My tank is droppin to E- still gassin
Runnin outta air gotta breath  Ill gasping he want it just as bad as he wanna live ask him
Humpin in the back of this bitch and He still lastin- guess He gave a fuck about about blowin up in his passion
Plus i'm meaner than misdimeanor reactions- Once i bump it up from infraction on this faction
It's the year I'm declaring ultimate action- gimme that award I'm a warrior for my past shit
Let my story unravel a little past his
Ill narrate it but I might make a few classics
In the process supply my fuel and ill lock it inside my chamber then cock it pop it and hit ya back on the dotted

Bridge:
True, No lie ya'll
This is all for (background yeah yeah yeah...)
You
Hustle, hustle, hustle


Verse 3:
And With a pen I can penetrate any soul- emphasizing my struggle in bold- I got goals but
It's so cold up
In this globe bruh
Feel like some of my homies turnin to cobras
Straight snakes- I play my newest shit for ya
And I swear it a put you into euphoria
But when it's over you down play like it ain't and I need support from these people put confidence in my tape
Maybe it hits a little deeper than me maybe you afraid of your future but see me sailin the seas
And Cuz I'm hot this is true up to a degree but my team should know who they are you'll be on the tour guaranteed
Poppin bottles while woman poppin with their pussies we bring em back to the telly and famous amous their  cookies
I won't get too far ahead of myself it's a patient ride for the wealth if you couldn't already tell I'm about that

Chorus:
Hustle hustle hustle oo oo x2 (Yeah yeah yeah background)
I've been on this hustle everyday (Every single day)
