[Verse 1: Slav]
With mo money come problems
And to solve em, it cost money
But how he gonna solve em when his pockets dust bunnies
When his mama was a base head
And daddy was a dummy
Hopping from house to house
Like they was the Easter bunny
Some people from the outside laugh
But it ain't funny
Coming from the part of Philly where it ain't always sunny
So he ask himself, "do you wanna live in a house that's so rummy? Do you wanna be that sorry kid with no money?"
So he picked up a pen and he grind
Making his rhymes so refined
And in the process
Sounds like nonsense
Changing the views of all man kind
While his mama didn't listen
And daddy was doing time
He had to hustle cuz they struggled to pay the payments on time. But got offered a deal and he signed
Watched his bank account incline
Now he countin' all his money, just to pass the time
He got his folks out the hood, no more working full time
Mama got clean and daddy had stopped banging a 9
Rockin' everything, from Gucci to Calvin Klein
Only dropped a fucking single and he already in his prime
Was in the dark his whole life
And now he's ready to shine
Cuz he kills it on the mic but he ain't causing no crime
As a kid with no money, asking, "who stole from me?"
Now he's balling like Kobe getting that pro money
When asked, "what's your goal in life, with all that money?"
He replied, "It's simple man, just to make mo money."
