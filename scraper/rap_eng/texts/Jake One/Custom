[Hook]
Yah
No more trouble cruising
Got a new bike
Paint job, custom, make you feel
To not
Inhale, heaven sent, angel
Of mine
Let's go get away, yeah
No-no-no, floating away, yeah-yeah

[Verse]
Money, money all on my mind
Homie is starting
We've been strolling around all the time
Don't get to park it
Payday got me feeling like
Bottled in your apartment
Soon as I let you off on the bed
We tryna start shit
Find something, I love it
I keep my mind running
Time's nothing, non-existent, love
I'm equipped with more cents than a meter
Be damned, want me when I caught
Bring my t-shirts, make room for what I'ma leave
Then I'm off girl
You got to get your ones up and your fun up
One puff get your lungs stuck, nigga what up
Bu-bu-bu-busting through the traffic, I'm a monstah
When isn't rocking the bike, pull up in my mom car
Long story, short conversations, close encounters
Long awkward silence
May not have the words but
The bong packed with knowledge
This song filled with passion
Sip it and get in like it
Rich, I'm the nigga, I am
Pa-pay attention mami

[Hook]
No more trouble cruising
Got a new bike
Paint job, custom, make you feel
To not
Inhale heaven sent, angel
Of mine
Let's go get away, yeah
No-no-no, floating away, yeah-yeah

[Outro]
Aye
La-la-la and another one
You can play the victim but to us you just a customer
All the shit you talking, won't you tell me what you running from
