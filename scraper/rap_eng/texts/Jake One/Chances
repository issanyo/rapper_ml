Chances... Right?
Okay

[Verse: Just]
These days it isn't even that I'm sad
It's that I don't find the "whys" on why I should be glad
Like all these other rappers rambling about this money
That to me it's pretty obvious these posers never had
Just, money, to fill dozens of bags
Or, just enough for me to buy that truck for my dad
It's, close enough for my mother to drop all the nagging
But not enough for my homies to have stopped all their bragging
I am!
Not sick,  actually I'm somewhere I go out of topic
Like my life seems so dark my friends think I'm gothic
As black clothing starts consuming my closet
And it's grown so much I fear its to late to stop it
Should I, drop it?
And change for fame and a profit?
If I'm saying anything that isn't Justin it's toxic
I've, seen so much, so why cover my sockets
I'm only able to do this when aware and I'm conscious
See, nowadays it's way more than stringing rhymes
Because I'm usually tied down to what is always in my mind
Like...Money, music, future, and the time
That everybody seems to waste though I ain't waisting mine
She says Justin you're just blinded
I say just know you're the fold
And I say Just know you're the fold
I say Just know you're the fold

[Outro: Just_J]
Yeah, Chances
