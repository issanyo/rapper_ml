[Andrew]
Crazy's an understatement
I hear more voices than a stadium
A grown man who lives inside his on cranium
Only God can judge me and I guess I’m entertaining him because I'm still alive and more atomic than uranium
I'm straining my creative muscles trying to imagine
Any sort of medication that elevates the madness that I feel within myself
It’s nothing short of synaptic
The AVALANCHE case file simply reads: Basket
Step aside peasants and make way for the headline
We came to tell you ghost stories right before bedtime
Don't you pour a glass of milk and don't you slip into those PJ's
We'll wake you right up with more airhorns than a DJ
These days rapping as an art ain't significant
Even my gramps raps and it sounds no different than so called artists with their preschool vocab
So we left the game and started living like some nomads
Oooooh, AC made me so mad
He told me to wait my turn. I want to spit so bad
Hey, actually I guess my verse was first
This beat came with Jake One but now it leaves in a hearse!

{Son Anthony}
Oozaru form had them praying for tomorrow
Throwing tantrums like a toddler over beats that I had borrowed
Cos I'm critical of my own
Somewhat shy but that's so wide known
I should the take note from others to leave forthright writings siloed
I know it’s tough because the moods I use are sustenance
For the core of this world that I’ve created out of nothing
Power moving using gun flint
Come get hunted if you want it
Drew and I we keep it banging like a drummer with their drum sticks
Confront me for my lies if you will, but if the times there
And don't be surprised if it dies on the vine
So why not can it? (Why?)
It’s canon if I say there's claim to them
My landmines make you watch your step like it's Jainism
"It's alive!" is what the doctor shouted at me
As I came into the world from out the snatch that 9 months housed me
I plotted there
Jotted a few thoughts to animate later
Now I’m able to enable the steps
Adept in fables and stress
I stay in stables to rest because my face resembles those that are exploited for bets
We're merely toying with death while we're enjoying our breaths
What I've destroyed left the ash used for anointment at mass
It's more poignant than that
Now let me sharpen my sword so it is pointy for stabbing at the all forces opposing
Appointed a high knight of the realm with no horse
Was once a noblemen converted to a solider for war
And that's life
