[Intro: Angel]
I gotta new hideout
Angel
Baby we can ride

[Verse 1: Angel]
Baby let's ride out, get lost till we can't see signs that's heading to London, no more
I'm getting so tired
It's like all the hates and chit chats getting me fired (up more)

[Bridge: Angel]
No I don't wanna put up no longer
I'm building up my future
I don't wanna have to go crazy tonight
Don't wanna take no wrong roads
End up sitting behind those closed doors
So if I stay it can get crazy tonight

[Hook: Angel]
(oh no) No, don't wanna be here for another minute
(oh no) 'Cause this relationship's just [?] any minute
(oh no) And we both need some space to breathe for a minute
(oh no) So baby, let's get up and out of here
Out of here baby out of here [x4]

[Verse 2: Iyanya]
Let's ride out (Let's ride out)
I know a better place for nobody
Just you and I, timeout
Just let me take you to the hideout
Whatever happens here, I promise you, babe
No one's gon' find out, baby
Can you keep a little secret?
Girl, free up your mind
Get off the line
I got the remedy, you could be mine
I got your time, you're so divine
You're truly the baddest, but you be fine, now
I'll find out later
You're the special one, I came here to let go

[Hook: Angel]
(oh no) No, don't wanna be here for another minute
(oh no) 'Cause this relationship's just [?] any minute
(oh no) And we both need some space to breathe for a minute
(oh no) So baby, let's get up and out of here
Out of here baby out of here [x4]

[Bridge: Angel]
Out of here baby out of here
Out of here baby out of here
Out of here baby out of here
Out of here baby out of here
Out of here baby out of here
Out of here baby out of here
Out of here baby out of here

[Outro]
Turn the lights out
