It's Iyanya
Ah…Lord have mercy
Mr Chiddo…eh eh eh
I see some of them want me to fall
Everyday, me I grind, me I toil
They see nothing at all
Cos my "G" has done it all
I see badman want me to dull
Everyday, me I chill, me I ball
My bills, I'm paying in dol(lar)s
Cos my "G" has done it for me
Everyday
Me the don dada
All of them father
Hustle my way to the top with no ladder
Going in harder
No one else badder
I am young and getting it
Young and getting it
While I step in the club, drinks up
Cos they feeling it
I am young and getting it
The streets say na me bad pass o
Eh…if you're holy make you cast a stone
Before ya judge me, think your own
Making money from zone to zone
And that's why
I see some of them want me to fall
Everyday, me I grind, me I toil
They see nothing at all
Cos my "G" has done it all
I see badman want me to dull
Everyday, me I chill, me I ball
My bills, I'm paying in dol(lar)s
Cos my "G" has done it for me
Iyanya…
I see God's blessings upon ya
Like it's upon me
So when the haters try to push upon me
They cannot harm me, i got an army
I got money in the bank, full of ********
Which is every time I am in the club, do you hear what i'm saying
See me running over this track is not a game
Trying to test your money with my own? it's not the same
I collect money like toll
Career taking off like girls on the stripper pole
Private trips everywhere, me I am on a role
Who knew one day, life would ever be this cool It's a-mavin, i mean amazing
I never gave in
Now they are gazing
Jehovah save him, whoever says him, please just bless him cos he's just hating on me
And that's why
I see some of them want me to fall
Everyday, me I grind, me I toil
They see nothing at all
Cos my "G" has done it all
I see badman want me to dull
Everyday, me I chill, me I ball
My bills, I'm paying in dol(lar)s
Cos my "G" has done it for me
Thank God for the elevation
Everynight is a celebration
I'm busy touring all around the nation
Big ups my fans, appreciation
I am young and getting it
Young and getting it
While I step in the club, drinks up
Cos they feeling it
I am young and getting it
The streets say na me bad pass o
Eh…if you're holy make you cast a stone
Before ya judge me, think your own
Making money from zone to zone
And that's why
I see some of them want me to fall
Everyday, me I grind, me I toil
They see nothing at all
Cos my "G" has done it all
I see badman want me to dull
Everyday, me I chill, me I ball
My bills, I'm paying in dol(lar)s
Cos my "G" has done it for me
My "G" has done it for me
Done if for me
Nothing can run me down
Down yea…uh yea
My "G" has done it all
Done it all
Thank God for the elevation (elevation)
I am young and getting it
Young and getting it
While I step in the club, drinks up
Cos they feeling it
I am young and getting it
