[Intro: Iyanya]
It's Iyanya
"Did you wanna run again?"

[Verse 1 – Don Jazzy]
Up to something, no be small-thing
Check my melody, stop the dulling
Talk to my baby, wait, I'm coming
Me and Iyanya, we're up to something
Artistes don boku, richy-richy naa-ni
Bigger than Mavin? Don't be funny
Dem dey feel me, from Okoko'maiko
Down to Asia, Colombia calling
If na for money, we get am plenty
Ask me for money, whenever you see me
Another reason, when dem go dey feel me
And dem go dey twale, when I show for TV

[Bridge: Don Jazzy & Iyanya]
 (ooh-ooooh-ooh-oh!)
Who do this thing wey dey make dem say-aaay?
 (ooh-ooooh-ooh-oh!)
Who give dem wetin wey dey make dem say-aaay?

You know we get the master-plan, to make the money pile up
Look what you made me do
You know they say we never die, we multiply
Look what you made me do

[Chorus: Iyana]
Up to something, no be small-thing
The Bank is calling, more money piling
This na sure thing, we are balling
So exciting, nwa'nne iwa ta'go

"Mavin!"

[Verse 2 – Iyanya]
Some people just dey make mouth
But their money na audio
We no dey see am at all o
We're getting moolah, but we can't shout
Na why your baby dey call o
No messy, we still dey balling
We no dey force .. 'cos still, we run it
We call shot, keep it on a hundred
And, go tell your Bank, to come borrow money
And, tell your girls, it's time to come jolly "yaay-yaay"
Don't show up, if you ain't gat money
Paid my bills, so when you're paying, cash only
Out of the road, so we stepping out the jet
Everybody feeling good, giving glory to the Most-high
The money long, so we burn, till the sun-down
Na celebration, we dey 'pon it all-night
Some people, they just dey hate, dem wan turn-off we light
But you know for Mavin, no shaking oh

[Bridge: Don Jazzy & Iyanya]
 (ooh-ooooh-ooh-oh!)
Who do this thing wey dey make dem say-aaay?
 (ooh-ooooh-ooh-oh!)
Who give dem wetin wey dey make dem say-aaay?

You know we get the master-plan, to make the money pile up
Look what you made me do
You know they say we never die, we multiply
Look what you made me do

[Chorus: Iyana]
Up to something, no be small-thing
The Bank is calling, more money piling
This na sure thing, we are balling
So exciting, nwa'nne iwa ta'go

"Mavin!"

[Verse 3: Dr. Sid & Iyanya]
No time for no dulling on the way up
Plenty durty fit to cause you plenty hold-up
As you can see, Don Jazzy got me turnt-up
And nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

To, to Tooban, I be running every city
All the fine girls, steady-ringing at we Celli
Hot-stuff, now we gbo'na feli-feli
And when you hear the bass, feel the rumble, na your belly

It's been a long-time coming "no be mai-mai"
When you hear the music, keep it trending "no be mai-mai"
Money stacked-up, to the ceiling "no be mai-mai"
You making noise, all we do, window-spending
"no be mai-mai"
The people sweating, they feel the heating
We in the kitchen, the something cooking
No baking-soda, the game is over
We sitting on top, iwa'nne iwa ta'go

[Bridge: Don Jazzy & Iyanya]
 (ooh-ooooh-ooh-oh!)
Who do this thing wey dey make dem say-aaay?
 (ooh-ooooh-ooh-oh!)
Who give dem wetin wey dey make dem say-aaay?

You know we get the master-plan, to make the money pile up
Look what you made me do
You know they say we never die, we multiply
Look what you made me do

[Chorus/Outro: Iyana]
Up to something, no be small-thing
The Bank is calling, more money piling
This na sure thing, we are balling
So exciting, nwa'nne iwa ta'go
