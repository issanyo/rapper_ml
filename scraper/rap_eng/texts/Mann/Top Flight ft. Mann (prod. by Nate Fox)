Chorus:

I’m high
Got the police watching my ride
Got the coldest chick by my side
We on that lit shit all night
Poured up and rolling up, Top Flight
Now it’s 30 minutes ‘for my flight
Tryna push it to the limit but oh
I just might not make it, uh
I just might not make it, uh (it’s Juñor)
I just might not make it, uh (it’s Yump)
I just might not make it, uh (and Goldie, Nate drop that shit for me)

Junor Verse:

I be that omen
Give it a lick and I'm zoning
Gimme that shit in the morning
Keeping me lifted
When I'm feeling gifted

Been feelin important
Mean I'm feelin imported
I'm just here to free minds, fuck a milli
I be smoking king size, fuck a billi

When I, inhale new me
And I, exhale bullshit
You see my halo when you smokin with them cool kids

A cup of pain relief I’m floatin
Been silver surfing through til morning

Mannnn, i ain't lieing I just got the fire
I just got the desire to get mine
Diet fibre through the minds I been vibing, desiigner to Zion I get mine

These streets and I get mine
Pussy lives are gon get nine

If I don't make it Im just fading away in abyss with a bitch and a peace sign

Chorus:

I’m high
Got the police watching my ride
Got the coldest chick by my side
We on that lit shit all night
Poured up and rolling up, Top Flight
Now it’s 30 minutes ‘for my flight
Tryna push it to the limit but oh
I just might not make it, uh
I just might not make it, uh
I just might not make it, uh
I just might not make it, uh

Mann Verse:

The most potent with it i’m over lifted
Sober living that’s no existence
I don’t know my limits
I need oprah millions
I’m often drifting, i’m open with my thoughts
Did i mention, i be often lost in dimensions
I’ve been having thoughts in my mentions
Talking’ bout, i been talking to their spirit
Don’t even knock it till you hear it
Nowhere near it
Other niggas off, keep my fingers crossed
I don’t see a loss and i don’t see the law
I be screaming peace, we don’t need a war
That’s why i’m tryna enlighten people for
Look inside and you’ll see the source
We are god baby we the lord, i be on tour, (see me go)
Tryna spread the message but I’m with the extras (yah yah)
So i’m getting litty, all in your city i’m living wreckless (i’m getting litty now)
I’m tryna turn up and have a convo while the ganja burn up (while the ganja burn up)
I ain’t like these niggas, better pay attention and you might just learn somethin

Chorus:

I’m high
Got the police watching my ride
Got the coldest chick by my side
We on that lit shit all night
Poured up and rolling up, Top Flight
Now it’s 30 minutes ‘for my flight
Tryna push it to the limit but oh
I just might not make it, uh
I just might not make it, uh
I just might not make it, uh
I just might not make it, uh
