[Intro]
Winning, winning, winning
It's the way I survive
Winning, winning, winning
Put your hands in the sky
Winning, winning, winning
Let 'em know that we fly
Winning, winning, winning
'Till the day that we die

If you winning throw your double-U's up
If you winning throw your double-U's up
Throw your dubs in the sky
If you winning throw your double-U's up
If you winning throw your double-U's up
Throw your dubs in the sky

[Verse 1]
Valleys and peeks, ups and downs in life
It won't hurt you if you know how to handle it right
I been trough the fire, and fly through the flames
It didn't break me, no, it made me go hard in the paint
And giving up is not an option: what my mama thought me
So when I'm doing what I do, it's gon' be hard to stop me
I remember it, like it was yesterday
When my little crib, burned down in West LA
Man I was devastated, but I never gave up
I had to work harder to get my mama new neighbours
Have my eyes on the prize, so gots your favour
Now I'm almost famous, and we came up

[Hook]
Cause I'm doing it, on the major scale
And I refuse to take a L, no
Yeah we doing it, on the major scale
And we refuse to take a L
Cause we

Winning, winning, winning
It's the way I survive
Winning, winning, winning
Put your hands in the sky
Winning, winning, winning
Let 'em know that we fly
Winning, winning, winning
'Till the day that we die

If you winning throw your W's up
If you winning throw your W's up
Throw your dubs in the sky
If you winning throw your W's up
If you winning throw your W's up
Throw your dubs in the sky

[Verse 2]
Overcame so much over the years
Sit back, open your ears
Something I want you to hear
Everyday we celebrate, because we are here
Another day having faith, the trophy is near
M-A-double-N
No stranger to struggling
Grew up single mother in
A city fill of Devils in
The sky. But I've never been described unintelligent
I don't let the Devil win
I hope that I set a trend
It has been a hell of a ride
No, I'm never surprised
When I die, I can say I lived a hell of a life
I was told as a child that the limit's the sky
Now this feeling that I'm feeling, it just can't be described
